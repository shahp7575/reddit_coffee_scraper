Struggling to concentrate, remember details, or stay sharp throughout the day? If your mind feels foggy or drained, it may not be your fault — it may be a sign that your **mental performance needs structured support**.

Recently, many people have started turning to a new brain-support approach designed to naturally boost **clarity, focus, memory, and daily mental energy**.  
 Full details here:

[ **Go Directly to the Method**](https://www.sattrek.com/1421-2/)





# Why So Many People Are Struggling Mentally Today

Modern life places enormous pressure on the brain:

* Constant screen exposure  
* Multitasking and overstimulation  
* Work stress and emotional fatigue  
* Poor sleep cycles  
* Nutrient gaps in daily diets  

Over time, this leads to:

* Persistent brain fog  
* Difficulty concentrating  
* Slow recall and forgetfulness  
* Afternoon mental crashes  
* Irritability, mood imbalance, or low motivation  
* Feeling mentally “tired” even when physically rested  

If these symptoms sound familiar, you’re not alone. More people are now choosing natural cognitive-support solutions instead of relying only on caffeine or temporary stimulants.

# What This Brain-Support Method Offers

This new formula was created to support mental performance in a complete, balanced way:

* Improved mental clarity  
* Reduced brain fog  
* Better focus and concentration  
* Enhanced memory and recall  
* More stable mental energy throughout the day  
* Support for mood balance and mental resilience  

It’s not marketed as a miracle pill — it’s designed as a **science-inspired support system** for natural brain function.

Full breakdown available here:

# Who Could Benefit From This Approach

This mental-support method may be helpful if you:

* Struggle to stay focused at work or school  
* Forget small details, conversations, or names  
* Wake up feeling tired or mentally heavy  
* Rely on coffee but still feel sluggish  
* Want to maintain long-term mental sharpness  
* Experience mood dips or afternoon fatigue  

If this sounds like what you’ve been dealing with, exploring a natural support system might be the missing step.

# Important Things to Know

* This is **not a medical treatment**; it’s a natural supplement designed to support performance.  
* Individual results vary; consistency matters.  
* Best results occur when paired with good sleep, hydration, and stress reduction.  
* If you have medical conditions or are on medication, consult a professional before adding anything new.

It’s a small, welcoming coffee shop with plenty of natural light and a relaxed vibe. Good space for working, reading, or just taking a break. I tried their Monroe Signature Creme Cold Brew (caramel, toffee, marshmallow) and it was *really* good — sweet without being too heavy.

If you’re local or passing through Lancaster, it’s definitely worth checking out. I’m trying to highlight more small businesses around South Central PA, so if you have any favorites, I should visit next, I’m all ears.

I was still not able to respond to anything she was saying. 1 or 2 days later she called me, i picked up. she started crying, couldn't say a word clearly, i was waiting for her to calm down and tell me what happened that day which made her do all this. She started with I'm not able to tell you what happened, i insisted then she said that she went on a coffee date with a guy from her university, had a good chat then on the way back that guy tried holding her hand and ""she didn't resisted"" her exact words. The guy asked her for another date, she refused and went back home. according to her when she started feeling guilty for what she did and then she texted me that she doesn't wanna continue this relationship. She asked me why didn't I contacted her in this period of time and why didn't i asked her for the reason of breakup. My thought was if someone has already made up her mind then does that even matter to ask for it. Now the thing is she told me all of this and just wanted me to know what happened that day. My confusion is what should i do here? she came back to me with all this and asked me what to do now? i told her u already broke up with me, no? she said i did what felt right to her at that time. I Love her so much at the same time i am not able to digest this feeling that she fancy someone while being in relationship with me. I asked her what would've u done if the roles were reversed, she told me that she wouldn't continue the relationship. She also said that she can't continue the relationship with this guilt. my conscience is split between the two, one doesn't want her to go the other one says let her go. that's all, what are your thoughts on this.

Have more than a decade of experience and I’m actually good at my work, but the moment I’m in a meeting with more than 2 people, my voice starts shaking. Presentations make me extremely nervous, to the point where I can feel my throat tightening.When out even something as normal as ordering a coffee feels or a meal like a task because I’m such an introvert.

All of this makes me doubt my own calibre. I’ve had my share of difficult experiences growing up, so my self-respect and confidence have taken a hit over the years. I also struggle to accept compliments, whether it’s at work or personally, I just freeze up or deflect.

I really want to be more confident and articulate, not just for my career but for my own peace of mind.
For the women here who’ve dealt with similar issues , how did you work on your confidence? Did anything actually help?
Would love to hear your experiences, tips, or even small daily practices.

No one ever told me it was “wrong” — it was just one of those habits you inherit in a kitchen and never question.

Recently someone told me you should always use cold water when the water will be consumed. I looked into it a bit and, beyond the plumbing side, a lot of people say:

* Cold water gives more predictable taste
* Less scale buildup inside the kettle
* More dissolved oxygen → cleaner flavor (especially for coffee/tea)
* Hot water may shorten kettle lifespan if there’s extra sediment/minerals

What surprised me was seeing the manual of my Saki stainless-steel kettle literally say “use cold drinking water only.” Not in a dramatic or marketing way — just as a quiet guideline — but it made me rethink the habit I’ve had for a decade.

So I’m curious from a kitchen/appliance perspective rather than a purely plumbing one:

Do you always start with cold? Sometimes use hot? 

Have you noticed scaling differences? Any taste differences?

Does plumbing setup (old vs new) matter here?

Not panicking — just realizing that I’ve been doing the same thing forever without thinking about the *kitchen implications* of it. Curious what the practical consensus is among people who actually care about how things work in the kitchen.",1,1765282593.0,KitchenAppliances,1,1.0,False

1pi5sz7,https://i.redd.it/m697vpb5666g1.jpeg,I'm going to do things with my friend and I need advice (part 2),"Yesterday I made this post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/s/Ui5FcCjuLO

About 24 thousand people saw it and I got plenty of wonderful replies so I figured I'd make a follow up to explain what ended up happening.

Please read the first post and my replies for the build up, but tldr: me and my closest friend decided last night to try doing some intimate things together for the first time in our relationship.

So, here's how the night went, he came over last night after having a really rough night playing playing in his pool league, people were really rude to him so he was pretty bummed out. After a big hug and making some coffee he cheered up pretty quick and we started playing Balatro on the tv, when it was his turn I started to cuddle under his arm, he had a very good run in the game and we were laughing and teasing eachother loudly, it was honestly very very sweet.

When he won the game I kissed him on the cheek for the first time that night, we put some YouTube videos on the tv and occasionally I'd come up, he'd lean his head towards me and I'd kiss his cheek again and again. This happened about 4 times then I just asked him if I could kiss him, he looked at me and we very gently kissed eachother.

It was honestly really really nice, we held the kiss for a few seconds and he complimented how gentle I was after.

We went back to cuddling and held hands, again for the first time, we ended up holding hands for the rest of the night.

I'd occasionally come up from cuddling him to either kiss his cheek, kiss his lips or his neck (the last I thoroughly enjoyed) I licked his neck once and that made him laugh quite a bit :3

I asked him if there was anywhere I could bite him, he said not his neck because he has work but offered me his arm, and I gently nibbled up his arm to his fingers while we were cuddling, he didn't react to this but he allowed it and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

At this point it was around 1am, I asked him if he was enjoying everything that was happening and he said yes, I brought him to my room and was going to ask if we could stay in here but just as fast as I brought him there he kinda wandered out so I didn't press it.

On the couch we ended up kissing more while cuddling, even made out twice which was reaaaally great. By the end of the night we had switched positions and his head was on my chest and I was running my fingers through his hair.

He told me he was just really tired and he'd like to do more with me when he has more energy, so he's planning on coming over later today moreso during the day than at night for that.

Long story short, we ended up cuddling a lot, we touched eachothers thighs, chests and backs, held hands, kissed and made out, I bit his arm and fingers, and laughed aaaaaaa lot together :)

The only thing that made me nervous was I asked I could sit on his lap and kiss him and he said no, he said I was pretty excited and he was very tired so again, he wants to come over today while he has more energy. I read this as not a rejection but ""let me have an opportunity to match your energy"" kinda thing.

He was over at the house for 4 hours from 10pm to 2 am and he hugged and kissed me goodbye before he left. He even texted me when he left which is pictured above.

Overall I'm very happy with how everything went. I think for our first time we took things very slow and there was plenty of communication. I did mention to him that I talked to ""people on the internet"" about him coming over tonight and the general consensus was to talk things over and take things slow, so I did.

Thanks for reading :) I'll reply in the comments and when he comes over I'll be sure to make a follow up to that as well hehe",2,1765282147.0,bisexual,0,1.0,False

1pi5rw0,https://v.redd.it/xh57qenl566g1,A tool for getting a quick map out of your solution,"# 🚀 Just built a C# tool that saved me hours - thought I'd share!

Hey fellow devs! 👋 I just finished a side project that's been a huge time-saver for me and wanted to share it with the community.

# Meet SolutionScanner 🛠️

Ever find yourself staring at a massive C# solution thinking ""what's even in here?"" 🤔 I built a simple Windows app that scans through your entire solution and gives you a clean breakdown of everything:

**What it does:**

* Finds all your .cs files (even in subfolders)
* Shows you every class, method, property, enum, etc.
* Organizes everything in a nice tree view
* Lets you export as text or JSON
* Has syntax highlighting because pretty code is happy code ✨

**Why I built it:**  
Last month I inherited a legacy project with a lot of files. Instead of manually digging through everything, I built this tool to give me a bird's-eye view. Ended up saving me like 3 hours of ""wtf is this code"" moments 😅

**Cool stuff it does:**

* One-click scanning of entire solutions
* Click on any file to see its contents
* Copy everything to clipboard with one button
* No installation needed - just download and run
* Completely free (obviously)

**Who might find it useful:**

* You're new to a codebase and need to understand it fast
* You're documenting your own project
* You're preparing for a refactor
* You're just curious what's in that old solution folder

# Try it out if you want! 🎯

**GitHub:** [https://github.com/tsgiannis/SolutionScanner](https://github.com/tsgiannis/SolutionScanner)

No pressure, but if you try it and like it, a ⭐ on GitHub makes my day! Even if you don't, hope it inspires someone to build their own useful tool.

**Tech stack:** C# WinForms, .NET , some regex magic, and way too much coffee ☕

Built by a fellow developer who spends too much time in Visual Studio,  
John

**TL;DR:** Made a free tool that scans C# solutions and shows you what's inside. Might save you some time. Check it out if you want: [https://github.com/tsgiannis/SolutionScanner](https://github.com/tsgiannis/SolutionScanner)",2,1765282045.0,dotnet,3,0.67,False

Any cleaning or maintenance tips?,"So I finally caved and replaced my Bissell after one too many saturday mornings after a pasta night picking hair and mystery gunk out of a roller that somehow smelled like wet dog (we don't even have a dog). The final straw was when my feet literally stuck to the floor after cleaning. like... what's even the point then?

Decided to try a vacuum/steam combo this time. first use felt a little like cheating when watching this dried coffee spill disappear was weirdly satisfying.

The self-cleaning thing is neat. I was skeptical, but after I finished, i just let it run and all the nasty water drained out while it cleaned the roller itself. didn't have to touch anything. Which is good because I'm lazy and that's usually where I give up on maintaining stuff.

Floors actually feel clean now instead of that weird sticky-clean feeling.

Anyway, I'm trying to figure out how not to ruin this one:

For people using steam cleaners regularly: have you noticed it doing anything weird to your floors over time? I've got tile and luxury vinyl, and I'm paranoid about warping or dulling or whatever else can go wrong.

Maintenance-wise, what actually needs attention? The roller cleans itself, but I'm assuming there's other stuf like filters? tanks? random parts that'll clog up if I ignore them?

And the cleaning solution question, is adding anything to the water a terrible idea? I keep seeing people say ""just use water"" but also... my floors get gross and I want them to smell nice.

I have a track record of destroying appliances by either over-maintaining or under-maintaining, lol. so any actual advice would be great.",2,1765282011.0,CleaningTips,0,1.0,False

My dad is a retired mechanic and he made sure both his daughters could change a tire, check fluids, even do basic maintenance. My younger brother is 22 and can barely pump gas, but he came with me today because he was in town and we were getting lunch after.  

I brought my car in because I heard a weird knocking, told the guy at the desk what model I drive, what work was done last year and what I thought it might be. He nodded, then turned to my brother and said ""So what do you think, man."" My brother literally went ""uhh I dont know, its her car"" and laughed. The mechanic kept explaining things to him anyway, totally ignoring me, even when I answered questions he directed at my brother.  

After ten minutes of this I just said ""Hey, can you please talk to the person who actually owns and drives this car. He is just here for the free coffee."" My brother almost choked trying not to laugh. The mechanic looked annoyed but finally started looking at me when he spoke.  

I feel a bit petty for calling it out, but I also left thinking about how many women just let that slide because they dont want to be ""difficult"". Curious how you all handle stuff like this. Do you just take the info and leave, or do you push back when people talk around you about your own life.

By contrast, the coffee culture, especially in urban areas, feels fast-paced and sometimes overly commercialized, losing its connection to tradition.

1pi5mbf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bradic/comments/1pi5mbf/how_to_care_for_cashmere_the_complete_guide_to/,How to Care for Cashmere: The Complete Guide to Making It Last Decades,"You've invested in quality cashmere. Maybe it's a luxurious sweater, a beautiful cardigan, or an elegant coat. You love how it feels, how it looks, how special it makes you feel when you wear it.

Now comes the crucial question: how do you care for it properly so it lasts years, or even decades instead of falling apart after one season?

Cashmere has a reputation for being delicate and high-maintenance. The truth is more nuanced: cashmere is durable when cared for correctly, but unforgiving when mistreated. A few simple mistakes can ruin even the most expensive piece.

This comprehensive guide will teach you everything you need to know about cashmere care, from washing and drying to storage and repair. Follow these practices and your cashmere will remain soft, beautiful, and wearable for 10, 20, even 30+ years.

 

# Understanding Cashmere: Why It Needs Special Care

Before diving into care instructions, understanding cashmere's unique properties helps explain why certain care methods work and others damage it.

# What Makes Cashmere Different

Cashmere fiber comes from the soft undercoat of cashmere goats. Unlike sheep's wool, cashmere fibers are:

Finer: Cashmere measures 14-19 microns in diameter versus wool's 25-45 microns. This fineness creates incredible softness but also makes fibers more delicate.

Smoother: Cashmere has fewer scales along the fiber shaft, giving it that silky feel but also meaning it doesn't felt as easily as wool (both advantage and disadvantage).

More elastic: Quality cashmere stretches and returns to shape beautifully when treated well, but loses this property when damaged.

Temperature-regulating: Cashmere's structure traps air for insulation while wicking moisture, making it comfortable across seasons.

Protein-based: Like wool and silk, cashmere is a protein fiber. Harsh chemicals, heat, and agitation break down these proteins, permanently damaging the fabric.

# What Damages Cashmere

Understanding your enemies helps you avoid them:

Heat: Breaks down protein structure, causes shrinking and felting  
Agitation: Causes fibers to tangle and felt together  
Harsh chemicals: Degrade protein fibers  
Moths: Eat protein fibers (cashmere is their favorite)  
Improper storage: Stretching, creasing, or compressing damages shape  
Overwashing: Strips natural oils and weakens fibers  
Hanging: Gravity stretches out shape over time

Every cashmere care practice aims to minimize these threats while keeping the garment clean and fresh.

 

# How Often Should You Wash Cashmere?

This is the first and most important rule: wash cashmere as infrequently as possible.

# The Washing Schedule

After every wear: Never. This is too frequent and will wear out your cashmere quickly.

After 2-3 wears: Only if visibly soiled, stained, or you've sweated significantly in it.

After 5-7 wears: The standard for most people under normal conditions.

After 10+ wears: Possible if the garment hasn't been worn against bare skin (e.g., a cardigan worn over other clothes).

Before storage: Always wash before putting away for the season, even if it seems clean. Body oils and invisible stains attract moths.

# Why Washing Less Is Better

Every wash cycle causes some fiber degradation:

* Friction loosens fibers, leading to pilling
* Water swells fibers, weakening their structure
* Movement causes fibers to migrate and tangle
* Repeated wet-dry cycles gradually damage proteins

Washing when truly necessary preserves your cashmere's integrity far longer than washing after each wear.

# Between-Wash Refreshing

To extend time between washes:

Air it out: After wearing, lay your cashmere flat or hang briefly (not long-term) in a well-ventilated area. Fresh air removes odors without washing.

Spot clean: Address small stains immediately with a damp cloth rather than washing the entire garment.

Steam it: A handheld steamer refreshes cashmere and removes wrinkles without full washing. The moisture helps reshape the garment.

Freeze it: For odor removal without washing, place your cashmere in a sealed bag in the freezer overnight. This kills odor-causing bacteria.

 

# Hand Washing Cashmere: The Best Method

Hand washing is the gold standard for cashmere care. It gives you complete control, minimizing agitation and ensuring proper treatment.

# What You'll Need

* Clean sink or basin
* Cool or lukewarm water (never hot)
* pH-neutral detergent or specialized cashmere wash
* Clean towels
* Flat drying space

# Step-by-Step Hand Washing Process

Step 1: Prepare the Water

Fill your sink or basin with cool to lukewarm water (max 30°C / 86°F). Hot water causes shrinking and felting.

Add a small amount of detergent:

* 1-2 teaspoons of cashmere wash, or
* 1 teaspoon of pH-neutral detergent (baby shampoo works in a pinch)

Mix until dissolved. Less is more, excess soap is hard to rinse out.

Step 2: Submerge the Garment

Turn your cashmere inside out (protects the outer surface from friction).

Gently submerge it in the water, pressing down lightly to ensure it's fully saturated. Don't wring, twist, or agitate.

Let it soak for 10-15 minutes. This loosens dirt and oils without aggressive action.

Step 3: Gentle Cleaning Motion

Very gently move the garment through the water with a soft squeezing motion, like you're kneading dough extremely gently.

Focus on areas that contact skin directly: collar, cuffs, underarms. Gently squeeze these areas to release oils and dirt.

Never:

* Rub fabric against itself
* Twist or wring
* Scrub vigorously
* Pull or stretch

Total active washing time: 2-3 minutes maximum.

Step 4: Drain and Press

Drain the soapy water.

Gently press the garment against the basin sides to remove excess water. Don't wring or twist, just press.

Step 5: Rinse Thoroughly

Refill the basin with cool, clean water.

Gently move the garment through the rinse water to remove all detergent. Residual soap attracts dirt and makes cashmere feel stiff.

Drain and press out water again.

Repeat the rinse process. Most cashmere needs 2-3 rinses to remove all soap.

You'll know rinsing is complete when the water runs clear with no suds.

Step 6: Remove Excess Water

Lay a clean, dry towel flat.

Place your cashmere on the towel and roll it up like a burrito, pressing gently as you roll. This absorbs significant moisture without wringing.

Unroll and transfer to a fresh dry towel if the first one is very wet.

Your cashmere should be damp but not dripping at this point.

# Common Hand Washing Mistakes

Using hot water: Causes immediate shrinking and damage  
Too much soap: Hard to rinse out, leaves residue  
Vigorous rubbing: Causes felting and pilling  
Insufficient rinsing: Soap residue attracts dirt  
Wringing out water: Stretches and distorts shape  
Hanging while wet: Weight of water stretches garment

 

# Machine Washing Cashmere: When and How

Many people successfully machine wash cashmere, but it's riskier than hand washing. If you choose this method, take extreme precautions.

# When Machine Washing Is Acceptable

Machine washing works best for:

* Sturdy cashmere pieces (not delicate lace or very fine knits)
* Two-ply or heavier cashmere (single-ply is too delicate)
* Garments you wear very frequently and need practical care
* When you absolutely don't have time for hand washing

# How to Machine Wash Safely

Step 1: Prepare the Garment

Turn inside out and place in a mesh laundry bag. This protects from excessive agitation.

Step 2: Machine Settings

* Cycle: Delicate, hand wash, or wool cycle only
* Water temp: Cold (30°C / 86°F maximum)
* Spin speed: Lowest possible or no spin
* Detergent: Small amount of pH-neutral or wool-specific detergent

Step 3: Never

* Use regular wash cycles
* Use warm or hot water
* Add fabric softener (coats fibers)
* Wash with heavy items (jeans, towels)
* Overfill the machine
* Use regular high-spin speeds

Step 4: Remove Immediately

Take cashmere out as soon as the cycle ends. Don't let it sit in the machine, this can set wrinkles and cause odors.

# Machine Washing Risk Assessment

Even with precautions, machine washing carries risks:

* Higher pilling likelihood
* Shape distortion potential
* Faster fiber degradation over time
* Risk of felting if machine overheats or agitates too much

Verdict: Hand washing is always safer. Save machine washing for when absolutely necessary.

 

# Drying Cashmere: The Most Critical Step

How you dry cashmere matters more than how you wash it. Improper drying ruins garments permanently.

# The Only Safe Method: Flat Drying

Step 1: Reshape Immediately

While your cashmere is still damp, gently reshape it to its original dimensions. Smooth out wrinkles, align seams, check that sleeves are symmetrical.

Cashmere is most pliable when damp, this is your opportunity to restore proper shape.

Step 2: Lay Flat on Dry Surface

Place a clean, dry towel on a flat surface away from direct heat and sunlight.

Lay your cashmere flat on the towel in its natural shape:

* Sleeves extended naturally (not folded)
* Body smooth and unwrinkled
* Neckline shaped properly

Step 3: Flip Halfway Through

After several hours, flip the garment over and replace the damp towel with a fresh dry one. This ensures even drying and prevents moisture being trapped underneath.

Step 4: Allow Full Drying Time

Complete drying takes 24-48 hours depending on:

* Thickness of the cashmere
* Room humidity
* Air circulation

Never rush this process. Wearing slightly damp cashmere can cause it to stretch out of shape.

# Drying Location Matters

Good locations:

* Spare bedroom with good airflow
* Guest bed or unused table
* Drying rack with a towel on top (if rack is flat and stable)
* Clean floor space with towel underneath

Bad locations:

* Near radiators or heaters (heat damages fibers)
* Direct sunlight (fades colors and weakens fibers)
* Humid bathrooms (prolongs drying, risks mildew)
* Draped over chairs or racks (creates permanent creases)

# What Never to Do When Drying

Never hang wet cashmere: The weight of water will stretch it out permanently, especially in the shoulders and sleeves.

Never use a dryer: Even on low heat, dryers cause shrinking, felting, and damage. One dryer cycle can ruin cashmere permanently.

Never dry near direct heat: Radiators, heating vents, hair dryers, all cause shrinking and damage.

Never rush the process: Impatience leads to mistakes. Let it dry fully, naturally.

 

# Removing Stains from Cashmere

Stains happen. Treat them quickly and carefully.

# General Stain Treatment Principles

Act immediately: Fresh stains are easier to remove than set stains.

Blot, don't rub: Rubbing pushes stains deeper and damages fibers. Gently blot with a clean cloth.

Work from outside in: Prevents spreading the stain.

Test first: Try any stain treatment on an inconspicuous area first.

When in doubt, dry clean: Some stains (ink, red wine, oil) need professional treatment.

# Common Stain Solutions

Water-based stains (coffee, tea, juice):

1. Blot immediately with clean, damp cloth
2. Mix tiny amount of pH-neutral detergent in cool water
3. Dip clean cloth in solution and gently dab stain
4. Blot with clean water to rinse
5. Press with dry towel to remove moisture
6. Air dry flat

Oil-based stains (makeup, food grease):

1. Blot excess with paper towel (don't rub)
2. Sprinkle cornstarch or talcum powder on stain to absorb oil
3. Let sit 30 minutes to several hours
4. Gently brush off powder
5. If stain remains, hand wash the entire garment
6. For stubborn stains, take to professional dry cleaner

Protein stains (sweat, blood):

1. Rinse immediately in cold water (never hot, this sets protein stains)
2. Soak in cool water with enzyme-based detergent for 30 minutes
3. Gently hand wash following standard process
4. If stain persists, try white vinegar solution (1 part vinegar to 3 parts water)

Ink:

* Don't attempt home treatment
* Take to professional dry cleaner immediately
* The longer ink sits, the harder it is to remove

# Stains to Never Treat at Home

Some stains require professional expertise:

* Red wine (very difficult to remove without proper chemicals)
* Ink or permanent marker
* Paint or dye
* Large or complex combination stains

Attempting DIY removal on these can make stains permanent. Professional dry cleaners have specialized treatments that work.

 

# Dealing with Pilling

Pilling (those annoying little balls of fiber on the fabric surface) is cashmere's most common complaint. Here's how to handle it properly.

# Why Cashmere Pills

All cashmere pills to some degree. Pilling occurs when:

* Short fibers work loose during wear
* Friction (from bags, seatbelts, friction against other fabrics) tangles loose fibers
* The garment is new and initial loose fibers are still working out

Important: Quality cashmere pills primarily during the first 5-10 wears, then stabilizes. Cheap cashmere pills continuously forever.

# Normal vs. Excessive Pilling

Normal pilling:

* Concentrated in high-friction areas (underarms, where bags rest, inner elbows)
* Happens mainly during first several wears
* Significantly decreases after initial period
* Easy to remove

Excessive pilling (indicates poor quality):

* All over the garment, not just friction zones
* Continues heavily after 15+ wears
* Returns immediately after removal
* Never stabilizes

If you're experiencing excessive pilling, the cashmere quality is likely poor, not your care routine.

# How to Remove Pills Correctly

Use the right tool: A cashmere comb (fine-tooth comb designed for delicate fabrics) or electric fabric shaver designed for delicates.

Never use: Scissors, razors, tape, or harsh fabric shavers. These damage the underlying fabric.

Proper technique with cashmere comb:

1. Lay garment flat on table
2. Hold fabric taut with one hand
3. Gently comb in one direction with light pressure
4. Don't press hard or scrape aggressively
5. Work section by section
6. Comb away from yourself (easier control)

Proper technique with fabric shaver:

1. Lay garment flat
2. Hold fabric taut
3. Use shaver on lowest setting
4. Move in gentle circular motions
5. Don't press hard against fabric
6. Empty shaver frequently so it works efficiently

Frequency: Remove pills as they appear. Regular light de-pilling is better than infrequent aggressive sessions.

# Preventing Pilling

While you can't eliminate pilling entirely, you can minimize it:

* Reduce friction (avoid wearing backpacks directly on cashmere)
* Wash less frequently (friction during washing causes pilling)
* Turn inside out when washing
* Don't wear the same piece consecutive days (let fibers rest)
* Store properly to avoid fabric rubbing against itself
* Buy quality cashmere with longer fibers (36mm+)

 

# Storing Cashmere: Daily and Seasonal

Proper storage prevents damage, maintains shape, and protects from moths.

# Daily Storage (In-Season)

The golden rule: Always fold, never hang.

Hanging cashmere (even for short periods) causes:

* Shoulder bumps where the hanger sits
* Stretching in the shoulders and sleeves
* Distorted shape over time
* Gravity pulling the garment out of proportion

How to fold cashmere properly:

Method 1: Basic fold

1. Lay flat face-down
2. Fold one sleeve across the back
3. Fold the other sleeve across
4. Fold in half vertically
5. Fold in half horizontally
6. Store on shelf

Method 2: KonMari vertical fold

1. Lay flat face-down
2. Fold vertically into thirds (bring sides to center)
3. Fold sleeves down along the fold lines
4. Fold in half or thirds horizontally depending on drawer depth
5. Store standing vertically in drawer

Storage locations:

* Shelves in closet
* Dresser drawers
* Dedicated sweater storage
* Under-bed storage boxes (with moth deterrent)

What to avoid:

* Hanging (causes stretching)
* Cramming too tightly (creates permanent creases)
* Storing in plastic (cashmere needs to breathe)
* Leaving in direct sunlight (fades colors)

# Seasonal Storage (Off-Season)

When storing cashmere for months, extra protection is essential.

Step 1: Clean Before Storage

This is critical. Moths are attracted to:

* Body oils
* Food residue
* Perfume and lotions
* Any organic matter

Even if your cashmere looks clean, wash or dry clean it before storage. One microscopic food stain can attract moths that destroy an entire collection.

Step 2: Choose Proper Storage Container

Good options:

* Breathable cotton storage bags
* Cedar chests
* Cardboard boxes (clean, dry)
* Canvas storage boxes

Bad options:

* Plastic bins (trap moisture, prevent breathing)
* Vacuum-sealed bags (compress fibers, create permanent creases)
* Damp basements or humid attics (mildew risk)

Step 3: Add moth deterrent

Moths are cashmere's worst enemy. Protect your investment with:

Cedar: Cedar blocks, balls, or sachets naturally repel moths. Replace annually as scent fades.

Lavender: Dried lavender sachets repel moths and smell pleasant. Refresh annually.

Herbal sachets: Combinations of rosemary, thyme, cloves, and lavender work well.

What not to use: Mothballs (toxic chemicals, terrible smell that permeates cashmere).

Step 4: Store in Cool, Dark, Dry Location

Ideal conditions:

* Temperature: Cool (below 24°C / 75°F)
* Humidity: Low (moths thrive in humidity)
* Light: Dark (prevents fading)
* Air circulation: Some airflow prevents musty odors

Good locations: Main closets, under beds, clean basements (if dry), climate-controlled storage

Bad locations: Hot attics, damp basements, garages, direct sunlight areas

Step 5: Check Periodically

Every 2-3 months during storage season:

* Open containers to air out briefly
* Check for moth activity (tiny holes, larvae, webbing)
* Replace moth deterrents if scent has faded
* Refold to prevent permanent creases from forming

 

# Fighting Moths: Prevention and Treatment

Moths cause more cashmere damage than all other factors combined. Take them seriously.

# Signs of Moth Damage

Early warning signs:

* Tiny holes appearing in cashmere
* Small white larvae in storage areas
* Webbing in corners of drawers or closets
* Adult moths flying around closet (the damage is already done)

Important: The adult moths you see don't eat clothes, their larvae do. One female moth can lay 50+ eggs, which hatch into larvae that feast on your cashmere.

# Moth Prevention Strategy

Clean everything: Moths need food (body oils, food residue). Clean clothes don't attract them.

Use natural deterrents: Cedar and lavender repel moths but don't kill larvae. They're prevention, not treatment.

Regular inspection: Check stored cashmere monthly during storage season.

Freeze new items: When buying new cashmere, place in sealed bag and freeze for 48 hours to kill any potential larvae before introducing to your closet.

Vacuum storage areas: Regular vacuuming removes moth eggs and larvae from closet floors and shelves.

Maintain low humidity: Moths thrive in humidity. Use dehumidifiers if needed.

# If You Discover Moths

Immediate action:

1. Remove all cashmere: Take everything out of affected area
2. Inspect each item: Look for holes, larvae, webbing
3. Freeze everything: Place all cashmere in sealed bags, freeze for 72 hours (kills larvae and eggs)
4. Wash all items: Even pieces that look undamaged
5. Vacuum thoroughly: Every corner of closet, drawers, shelves
6. Wipe down storage areas: Use vinegar solution or mild cleaner
7. Replace storage containers: Old ones may have eggs
8. Add fresh moth deterrents: New cedar, new lavender
9. Monitor closely: Check weekly for several months

Damaged items:

* Small holes can sometimes be repaired professionally
* Extensive damage usually means the piece is unsalvageable
* Don't store damaged items with undamaged ones (might have remaining eggs)

 

# Repairing Cashmere: When and How

Quality cashmere is worth repairing. Small damage doesn't mean discarding the piece.

# Repairs You Can Do Yourself

Small snags:

* Use a crochet hook or needle to pull the snag to the inside
* Gently work the fabric around the snag to even out tension
* Never cut snags (creates holes)

Loose threads:

* Trim close to fabric with sharp scissors
* Don't pull (unravels further)

Minor pilling:

* Use cashmere comb as described earlier
* Regular maintenance prevents buildup

# Repairs for Professionals

Holes:

* Small moth holes can be invisibly rewoven
* Professional reweaving costs €20-50 per hole
* Specialized services can make holes completely disappear

Significant unraveling:

* Needs professional reknitting
* Complex but possible for valuable pieces

Resizing:

* Cashmere can sometimes be taken in or let out
* Skilled tailors who work with knits can do this

Where to find repairs:

* Dry cleaners specializing in alterations
* Specialized textile repair services
* Knitting shops sometimes offer repair services
* Search ""invisible reweaving"" or ""moth hole repair""

Cost-benefit: If you paid €500+ for quality cashmere, spending €30-50 on professional repair makes sense.

 

# Dry Cleaning Cashmere: Pros and Cons

Dry cleaning is an option, but not always the best one.

# When Dry Cleaning Makes Sense

Good reasons to dry clean:

* Difficult stains (ink, red wine, oil)
* Heavy coats or structured pieces that are hard to wash at home
* Garments with embellishments or complex construction
* When you absolutely don't have time to hand wash
* Before seasonal storage (professional cleaning removes all oils)

When hand washing is better:

* Regular maintenance cleaning
* Lightweight sweaters, cardigans, scarves
* When garment isn't visibly soiled
* To save money and maintain control

# Choosing the Right Dry Cleaner

Not all dry cleaners handle cashmere well. Look for:

Green flags:

* Specializes in delicate fabrics
* Asks questions about the garment
* Inspects items carefully before cleaning
* Uses gentle, cashmere-appropriate processes
* Has good reviews specifically for delicates
* Charges premium prices (skill costs money)

Red flags:

* Uses harsh chemicals
* Treats all items the same way
* Doesn't inspect for damage before cleaning
* Suspiciously cheap prices
* Poor reviews mentioning damaged delicates

Questions to ask:

* ""Do you specialize in cashmere and delicate fabrics?""
* ""What cleaning process do you use for cashmere?""
* ""Do you hand-finish cashmere or machine press it?""

Frequency: Even if you dry clean, limit to 1-2 times per season maximum. Chemicals still stress fibers.

 

# Cashmere Care by Garment Type

Different cashmere items need slightly different care.

# Cashmere Sweaters and Cardigans

Washing frequency: Every 5-7 wears  
Method: Hand wash preferred, gentle machine wash acceptable  
Drying: Always flat  
Storage: Folded on shelf or in drawer  
Special notes: De-pill underarms and cuffs regularly

# Cashmere Coats

Washing frequency: 1-2 times per season maximum  
Method: Professional dry cleaning recommended (home washing is difficult due to size and structure)  
Drying: If hand-washed, requires multiple towels and 48+ hours  
Storage: Needs larger storage area; hang briefly to air out, then fold for long-term  
Special notes: Check pockets before cleaning, spot-clean when possible

# Cashmere Scarves

Washing frequency: Every 10-15 wears (worn over other clothes)  
Method: Hand wash is easy due to size  
Drying: Flat on towel, dries quickly  
Storage: Fold gently or roll loosely  
Special notes: Fringe requires extra gentle care

# Cashmere Dresses

Washing frequency: After every 2-3 wears (in contact with skin)  
Method: Hand wash, be extremely gentle with any bias-cut pieces  
Drying: Flat, reshape carefully while damp  
Storage: Fold carefully or roll to prevent creases  
Special notes: Pay attention to underarm areas and any areas that contact skin directly

# Cashmere Accessories (hats, gloves)

Washing frequency: Several times per season  
Method: Hand wash, very gentle  
Drying: Stuff gloves with tissue to maintain shape; reshape hats while damp  
Storage: Fold or lay flat (don't compress)  
Special notes: Accessories show wear quickly; maintain regularly

 

# Creating Your Cashmere Care Routine

Consistent care is easier than emergency interventions. Build these habits:

# After Every Wear

* Air out for 30 minutes before storing
* Check for stains and treat immediately
* Fold properly (never hang)
* Use garment brush to remove surface dust and lint

# Weekly (During Active Wear)

* Inspect for pilling and remove as needed
* Check for loose threads or snags
* Verify moth deterrents are still fragrant

# After 5-7 Wears

* Hand wash following proper technique
* Allow full drying time
* Reshape carefully before storing

# Monthly

* Rotate pieces to even out wear
* Check stored items for moth activity
* Refresh moth deterrents if needed

# Seasonally

* Deep clean all cashmere before storage
* Inspect each piece thoroughly
* Clean storage areas
* Add fresh moth protection
* Update care supply inventory

# Annually

* Assess condition of each piece
* Repair any damage professionally
* Replace worn items
* Donate pieces you no longer wear (don't let them languish)

 

# Cashmere Care Supplies: What to Keep on Hand

Stock these items for proper cashmere care:

Essential:

* pH-neutral detergent or cashmere wash
* Clean white towels (for drying)
* Cashmere comb
* Cedar blocks or lavender sachets
* Mesh laundry bags (if machine washing)

Helpful:

* Fabric shaver (electric, gentle setting)
* Handheld steamer
* White vinegar (for stubborn odors)
* Soft brush for lint removal
* Storage boxes or cotton bags

Nice to have:

* Sweater stone (natural pumice for pilling)
* Wool balls (for dryer, though you shouldn't use dryer)
* Garment spray for refreshing between washes

Total investment: €40-80 for complete care kit that lasts years

 

# Common Cashmere Care Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

Learn from others' errors:

# Mistake 1: Hanging Cashmere

Problem: Creates shoulder bumps, stretches garment  
Solution: Always fold, use shelves or drawers

# Mistake 2: Washing Too Frequently

Problem: Accelerates fiber degradation  
Solution: Wash only when truly needed (every 5-7 wears)

# Mistake 3: Using Regular Detergent

Problem: Too harsh, strips natural oils  
Solution: Use pH-neutral or cashmere-specific detergent

# Mistake 4: Machine Drying

Problem: Causes immediate shrinking and damage  
Solution: Always air dry flat

# Mistake 5: Ignoring Small Damage

Problem: Small holes become large holes; minor pilling becomes matting  
Solution: Address issues immediately

# Mistake 6: Storing Dirty Cashmere

Problem: Attracts moths, sets stains  
Solution: Always clean before storage

# Mistake 7: Using Fabric Softener

Problem: Coats fibers, reduces softness  
Solution: Never use fabric softener on cashmere

# Mistake 8: Aggressive Pilling Removal

Problem: Damages underlying fabric  
Solution: Use proper tools with gentle pressure

# Mistake 9: Storing in Plastic

Problem: Traps moisture, prevents breathing  
Solution: Use breathable cotton bags or boxes

# Mistake 10: Giving Up on Damaged Pieces

Problem: Discarding repairable cashmere  
Solution: Investigate professional repair options

 

# The Long View: Cashmere as a Lifetime Investment

When properly cared for, quality cashmere lasts 20-30+ years. Some vintage cashmere is 50+ years old and still beautiful.

This longevity transforms the economics:

€500 cashmere sweater worn 100 times over 15 years = €5 per wear

€100 cheap sweater worn 30 times over 2 years = €3.33 per wear, but replaced 7 times = €700 total

The properly cared-for quality piece costs less and provides better experience.

Your cashmere care routine is an investment in:

* Financial value (making your purchase last)
* Environmental responsibility (fewer replacements = less consumption)
* Personal satisfaction (wearing beautiful pieces that stay beautiful)
* Wardrobe coherence (pieces you keep become wardrobe foundations)

The time spent caring for cashmere (maybe 90 minutes per season per piece) pays dividends in years of continued wear.

 

# Final Thoughts: Care Creates Value

Cashmere isn't inherently high-maintenance. It simply requires different care than cotton t-shirts or synthetic fleeces.

Once you establish a routine, cashmere care becomes second nature:

* Hand wash every 5-7 wears (20 minutes)
* Dry flat overnight (no active time)
* Fold for storage (30 seconds)
* De-pill occasionally (5 minutes)
* Clean before seasonal storage (once yearly)

That's it. These simple practices preserve your investment for decades.

The cashmere pieces you care for properly will be with you through life changes, seasons, years. They'll become trusted wardrobe foundations you reach for again and again.

That's worth learning to care for properly.",1,1765281554.0,Bradic,0,1.0,False

That's something I have to do later in the day. 

So I just prioritized at the very least getting myself ready, packing a healthy lunch/breakfast. And making sure I look good in the morning. I set a stop watch with everything and that helps me stay on task and on time. With everything I gotta do. It's been working so far. 

-------------------

Wake up. 
-Drink some water....... 2 min
-Set coffee maker....... 3 min
-Go to the bathroom and shave/brush teeth/groom yourself/ moisturize..... 15 minutes
-possible shit taking........ 15 min
-get dressed, get everything together, deodorant, cologne....... 10 min
- take dog out......... 10 min
- take out and clean lunch box and it's contents/ pour your coffee....... 15 min
Should all take 1 hour and 10 min max and then have 20 extra minutes to go to work. 

I need to wake up and hour and 30 min before work.

I have a 10 min commute to work but I usually work 12-14 hours so not much time to cram more shit into the morning especially with kids.

The open air "" bus"" has steep narrow steps, and is impossible to safely enter with a walker . The medicinal garden experience at El Gallo was worth the price of the tour itself.
Lunch was a traditional Dominican Republic meal, cooked over open air fires-- stewed chicken, rice , beans, fruit, juices, coffee, herbal teas. As good as anything served on the ship.

And look—right there is the local brewpub that has excellent food (and beer), where my wife and I frequently ate over the summer. I already felt guilty, but I walked through the doors anyway and sat at the bar, thinking the fun of a nice lunch and beer while reading a book on my phone would make up for it.

Guess what? IT WASN’T FUN AT ALL. I ate too much and didn’t even really enjoy the two beers I had. The most enjoyable part was reading my book, which I could have done at home! I felt physically and mentally bad afterward. 

Oh AND that tricksy little voice of shame in my head was “you can’t reset your counter and post about this on reddit, everyone will know you’re a failure!” 

Well, I’m kicking that little voice to the curb, and I think I’ve finally made the connection that it isn’t the alcohol that was the fun part of going out and doing things. Next time I am tempted to just have a couple (gateway to full blown relapse), I’m going to try to remember this experience.

If your wedding is in summer, choose mountain regions.  
If it's monsoon, Kerala and Goa become incredibly beautiful.

# Why Your Honeymoon Should Be Planned, Not Random

# Final Thoughts

India has everything—snow peaks, tropical beaches, palaces, islands, jungles, spiritual towns, and private hideaways.

Started as a simple market cap comparison tool has evolved into a full meme coin tracking platform with a focus on community.

We **bootstrapped** Capitoday from day one. The love and support from this community has been incredible, and without you, Capitoday simply wouldnt exist. ❤️

To be transparent: all costs such as servers, APIs, backend tools, marketing, and most importantly, our time have been covered out of our own pockets. It’s been over a year since we launched the full platform, and thanks to your support, we have seen solid traction. Naturally, as the platform grows, we need to scale.

We believe it’s time to monetize Capitoday so we can continue building and delivering even more cool features for the community. Currently, we’re exploring a few monetization ideas:

* ✅ **Verified Coins:** Coin teams can claim and manage their coin page initially, with more tools for dev teams planned in the future.
* 📢 **Banner Ads**
* 🎯 **Promotional Campaigns**
* ☕ **Sponsorship Program:** Individuals or communities can support Capitoday through  contributions (think “Buy Me a Coffee” style).

We also plan to open an **invite-only Telegram chat** for power users, where we can discuss ideas and get direct feedback. We’ll share more details about this in the next post.

some short term plans to improve and expand the current platform status

* **Increased data aggregation** to track more coins and metrics
* **Community-specific custom features**
* **Near Real-time data updates** for faster insights
* **Telegram bot** to interact with the platform directly
* **Increased server resources**

We’d love your feedback 🙏. What do you think about these ideas?

My guy is 5,5 months old and he LOVES the couch and his bed / cave. He doesn't like his crate all that much, he just tolerates it, even if we make it the best place ever, lickymats, kongs, chews, breakfast, always fed in his cage, toys are tossed in the cage, small bites of candy is tossed in there every day. I just think he's a pup that doesn't like the cage... 

We've been trying for 10-20 minutes alone with the living room and hallway. So far so good at least :) He was quicker to get used to the free roaming, than his cage time.

First 10 minutes he barked for 8 minutes, then got on the sofa and looked out for 2 minutes. Next 10 minutes he barked for like 5 minutes, then went to his cave and just looked around. Next 10 minutes there was no barking, just in his cave, looked around, lied his head down for around a minute, then went to the sofa and lied down, looking outside for 5 or so minutes. Next time we tried 20 minutes, he chewed his pig ear for 10 minutes, the he jumped on the sofa and looked out for 10 minutes, lying down the whole time. Looks like he loves looking out, he can't do that in his crate.

  
I was just thinking if 5 month old is too young to free roam for a few hours? You who let your dog free roam the house, at what age did you trust him?

1pi594d,https://www.reddit.com/r/learningfrench/comments/1pi594d/looking_for_a_structured_mostlyaudio_french/,"Looking for a structured, mostly-audio French program that actually teaches grammar","
I’m looking for a structured, mostly-audio French program that actually teaches grammar in a clear, progressive way. I still plan to use multiple resources on the side (Anki, native content, etc.), but I want one main program that gives me a roadmap so I know what stage I’m in, what concepts to learn next, and how the foundations stack.

Right now, I’ve been going through the Coffee Break French podcast, and honestly, it’s not bad. Season 1 is super basic, but once you get into Season 2, they start explaining conjugations and grammar concepts in a way that actually makes sense. It’s probably the first audio resource I’ve found that really teaches grammar instead of dancing around it.

That said, I’m wondering if it’s worth paying for something more structured or more complete. For example:
	•	FrenchPod101 (are the paid levels actually good, or just a huge library of random lessons?)
	•	French Today’s À Moi Paris method
	•	Anything else that’s audio-heavy but still grammar-focused and progressive

Or should I just stick with the free Coffee Break French audio and supplement it with other grammar explanations when needed?

For context:
	•	Vocabulary isn’t my bottleneck
	•	Pronunciation also isn’t the issue
	•	My main weak spot is grammar, and I’m at the stage where learning it through audio-focused explanations would help a lot.

So if anyone has actually paid for these programs — or found one that’s clearly better structured than CBF — I’d love to hear whether the upgrade is worth it.

Thanks.

1pi5762,https://i.redd.it/p2d9olzyz56g1.jpeg,Christmas Came Early - Hoop Rao Filters (and Drop Coffee Advent Calendar),"So after watching James's video and almost simultaneously seeing a video on Instagram from Scott Rao about the Hoop, I pulled the trigger and ordered the custom filters, and they arrived today. I've been using the Hoop for a few years now, and after the included filters ran out, I've been using AeroPress filters exclusively, and I've found these to work fairly well. The quality of the brews have been acceptable but not outstanding, and I've been grinding fairly coarse, and brew times have hovered around 5 to 8 minutes for a 300ml brew.

And I've actually never bothered with custom filters for any other brew method. E.g. I've been using the stock V60 filters forever, and my expectations were quite low for this to have a noticeable effect (felt like an avenue for diminishing returns). 

However, I just brewed the coffee in the picture. (Side note, this is the wonderful advent calendar from Drop Coffee with a new coffee every day.) 

So it was the first time I brewed this particular coffee, and I brewed 18g of coffee in a 1 to 16 ratio, grind size two clicks courser than a single cup V60 on my Fellow Ode 1 with Gen 2 burr set (which is roughly where I'm at with a larger V60 brew). Rao filter rough side up. With gentle crust breaking with a WDT tool resulting in a drawdown time of 3 minutes 30 seconds… and the results were phenomenal!

It tasted like high-clarity, properly well-executed V60 brew, and not at all the time/effort compromise that's been my view of the Hoop. 

So, even before this filter paper, I've actually really enjoyed the Hoop, especially for busy mornings, or times when it just didn't suit to be standing over the kettle and doing a manual brew for a few minutes. But, as James noted, a stalled brew has been an issue. But, after trying these filters, I can really second what James and Scott have been saying around the Hoop. It's a very competent brewer out of the box, but this makes it an excellent one. I highly recommend anyone with a Hoop to try these filters out. I was able to get mine from this store: https://fiftybeans.cz/en/products/paper-filters-ceado-hoop-scott-rao and had them shipped to me in Sweden. 

My one remaining negative thing about the Hoop is the fact that it doesn't sit level on most carafes. I personally have only one carafe that it sits properly on, and while it can sit properly on most mugs, that really requires you to have a small brew volume to be able to not dip the bottom in the brew at the end of the drawdown. I have been thinking about making a custom 3D print to solve this, and if anyone else has a solution, please share it. If anyone else would be interested in such a 3D print, I might share it here as well.

It’s a good tool to have in the toolbox, but best used responsibly and with intention. For me, its shadow came in the form of a dependency which I was able to shake once I respected the plant, seen what it could give, and also what I it could take away. I found it to be a very root chakra based plant, great for doing physical stuff and getting shit done, possibly being a great alternative to ADHD meds. It’s great for getting into the body and doing mental scans of it, but it’s not good for blasting off from the body. I don’t have good creativity, imagination, or visualization on this plant as I do with marijuana, so I assume it creates an energetic discrepancy in the sacral chakra maybe? I don’t find that it heightens the brow or the crown chakra any—it’s a very 3D plant for the most part—but my dreams have been nothing but incredible on it. I am talking about instant lucidity in dreams, it’s almost like it is a cheat code; even better when taking a melatonin with it. I don’t know how this can be possible if it is “apparently” part of the coffee family and a partial opioid. I heard both opiates and caffeine inhibit R.E.M sleep, so I guess kratom being a great dream journeying tool in my experience just adds to the allure and mystery of the plant.

Just wondering if anyone else can share their experience with kratom. I did demonize it for a bit when it took a hold of me, but it was 100% the fault of my addictive personality coupled with my lack of experience in seeing the spiritual nature of plant medicines. The negative relationship I had with kratom during the dependency phase was really no different to how I treated weed in my teens and early 20’s. These things have to be used for their benefits as tools, not them using you. All plants and drugs can give and take away.",2,1765279285.0,Shamanism,2,1.0,False
1pi4yni,https://www.reddit.com/r/Miscarriage/comments/1pi4yni/struggling/,Struggling,"Hey all, this is my first post. Mentioned of s/h.

I miscarried at 7 weeks and 2 days and it’s been around 2 weeks and I’m struggling.

For background I’d been with my partner maybe only 2 months when I found out I was pregnant. He’s got 2 kids of his own (going through a divorce and due to multiple different factors out of his control he currently isn’t able to see his kids so I’m not around the kids).
We talked about me keeping the baby but due to him going through his own issues and the fact that we hadn’t been together that long we both knew it more than likely wasn’t the right decision.
As I started towards booking to get an abortion (I’m from UK) my mind started to change and I felt so protective of my baby. I found out I was pregnant at only a couple of weeks but I already felt protective. 
In the end I got the tablets and they sent me home with them and I was sat with my partner and while he was supportive and said he would stay with me no matter what I knew that he didn’t want me to keep it and I knew myself it probably wasn’t the right choice. 
It took me to the next day after multiple breakdowns I took the first tablet. 
Immediately after I regretted it and broke down and ran upstairs to make myself sick and I got the tablet out.
Before this I had bled a few times but it was small amounts and I thought it was just the standard bleeding you can get when pregnant. When I collected the tablets for the abortion they also did a scan and said the baby was healthy- I even got to take a picture home of the scan.
But I wouldn’t be making this post if it was. 3 days later I went to the toilet and I can only describe it like a plug coming out of me- a large palm sized clot passed and I broke down again- shouting for my partner and we called 111 (non emergency number) and they told us to go to the hospital immediately.
At the hospital I passed another large hand sized clot and in the end they said I was miscarrying and the pregnancy wasn’t viable anymore. They kept me in overnight as I was bleeding and passing large clots.
I didn’t cry then. I just felt numb. And every day since then I have just felt so numb. 
The other day my partner wanted to meet one of his friends who recently had a baby. We went to a coffee shop and as I was waiting for my order I looked over and saw him holding the baby. A little girl. I broke down again.
His friends questioned why I wasn’t sitting with them and he passed the baby back then came and asked what was wrong. I explained and he couldn’t apologise more. I explained he did nothing wrong and that I would go home so he can see his friends but he demanded he leave with me. I felt so embarrassed. It was the first time I met his friends and I feel like they’ll hate me already. 
I just saw him holding that baby and all I could think was “that was supposed to be us”.
I just don’t know what to do. I just want my baby back. Every time I go to the toilet it’s a reminder that my body failed. I’m still bleeding- while not heavy anymore it’s still there.
I keep switching between feeling so numb and just wanting to end it all. I have depression already but this had made it 10x.
Not long after we came back from the hospital I self harmed on his kitchen floor with a razor I found. All I could say was that “I wanted to bleed and it be on my terms”.

Pini Althaus saw the signs. In 2023, he left the company he founded, USA Rare Earth, to develop critical minerals mining and processing projects in central Asia, after realizing that the U.S. will need all the international help it can get to end China’s supply chain dominance.  
  
“I realized we only have a handful of large critical minerals projects that were going into production between now and 2030,” Althaus, chairman and CEO of Cove Capital, told *Fortune*. “I understood that we’re going to have to supplement the United States critical minerals supply chain with materials coming in from our allied and friendly countries.”  
  
Over a series of decades, China built up its [stranglehold on much of the world’s critical minerals supply chains](https://fortune.com/2025/11/17/us-aims-breathe-easy-china-chokehold-rare-earths/), including the[ 17 rare earths](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/battle-rare-earths-whos-got-130000997.html), used to make virtually all kinds of high-performance magnets and parts for vehicles, computers, power generation, military defense, and more. The rest of the world deferred to Beijing in exchange for cheap prices.

Amid an ongoing tariff war with the U.S.—and a temporary truce—the Trump administration is racing to build up domestic mining and processing capabilities, while also developing the global partnerships necessary to eventually undermine China, which controls 90% of the world’s rare earths refining.

In October, Trump inked a deal with Australia for both countries to invest $3 billion in critical minerals projects by mid-2026. Australia is home to the largest publicly traded critical minerals miner in the world, Lynas Rare Earths. Trump then signed a series of bilateral critical minerals deals in eastern and southeastern Asia, including Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Cambodia. The U.S. also has new deals with Ukraine, Argentina, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Kazakhstan, and more.

Althaus is specifically developing mining and processing facilities for tungsten—a heat-resistant metal used in electronics and military equipment—and rare earths in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. He sees the most potential in former Soviet Union nations in central Asia.

“The Soviets spent many decades exploring and developing mines. Many of their databases have been left and are quite meticulous,” Althaus said. “This gives companies looking to develop projects in central Asia a jumpstart compared to what would be here in the United States, where most of the opportunities are greenfield—very early stages, very high risk, and very little appetite for investment.”

In November, the Ex-Im Bank offered Cove Capital a $900 million financing letter of interest for the $1.1 billion Kazakh tungsten projects. A separate letter of interest was received from the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation.

Jeff Dickerson, principal advisor for Rystad Energy research firm, said only a long-term, coordinated effort—essentially a “wartime” approach—both domestically and with international partnerships can lead to success. But it cannot be done without new projects with foreign allies. “The challenge is that the U.S. doesn’t have a strong pipeline of mature mineral projects that are shovel ready,” he said. 

“The cycle of China extracting concessions on the back of mineral geopolitics and weakening the U.S. strategic negotiating position will likely continue without a coordinated, long-term response during the current moment of heightened attention to critical minerals,” Dickerson said, questioning whether the U.S. will maintain a concerted focus for years to come.

# New emphasis

The Trump administration is increasingly making financial partnerships with critical minerals developers—even becoming a majority shareholder of U.S. rare earths miner MP Materials—and offering deals for floor-pricing mechanisms to offset China’s recurring dumping practices that aim to eliminate competition.

A native Australian turned New Yorker, Althaus is, naturally, a big fan of this approach. Chinese price dumping has crippled global competition and scared away potential investors, he said.

“By providing a price floor, it removes the question marks; it removes the instability; it removes the most significant risk in funding a project that’s about to go into production,” Althaus said. “It creates a predictability where you can take geology all the way through to profitability. I think there should be a global effort to create transparent markets and prices for the key critical minerals.”

Critical minerals are increasingly included in U.S. negotiations for all foreign deals. In the tariff agreement with Indonesia, for instance, the Asian nation agreed to lift export bans on nickel. The White House leveraged its military support for Ukraine by demanding the rights to its critical minerals in return. And the recent U.S. bailout of Argentina included a partnership on critical minerals mining.

In addition to its strategic defense location, rare earths are even a reason Trump continues to show interest in annexing Greenland from Denmark.

Veteran geologist Greg Barnes, who founded the massive Tanbreez mining project, which remains in development, briefed Trump at the White House during his first presidential term. This year, Critical Metals acquired 92.5% ownership of the Tanbreez project.

Critical Metals CEO Tony Sage is keen to supply the U.S. with desired rare earths, and the company recently received a letter of intent for a $120 million Ex-Im Bank loan. The goal is to start construction by the end of 2026.  
“There’s an absolute need to make sure that more than 50% of the supply of these heavy rare earths come from outside of China—mined and processed outside of China,” Sage told *Fortune*.

Regardless of any long-shot annexation bids, Sage said Greenland can and should be a key ally to the U.S. for critical minerals. “They definitely don’t want to be part of the U.S., but I think they’ll be pro-U.S.,” he said.

For his part, Althaus said he sees all the international deals as progress, and not as competition for his Cove Capital.

“I think it’s a positive, and I think we’ll start to see a lot more happen in the coming months in terms of the U.S. and collaboration with other countries.”

# Dec. 8th, 2025~Reinventing America’s critical minerals supply chain

[Reinventing America’s critical minerals supply chain - MINING.COM](https://www.mining.com/reinventing-americas-critical-minerals-supply-chain/)

https://preview.redd.it/vqz8a41pr56g1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b39acbbad58aea2c53fcbc03470cb33a94425eb

It’s no secret that the Trump Administration has been looking to expand America’s critical mineral supply, with a specific focus on reducing reliance on imports and strengthening domestic production.

One of the top among multiple administrative initiatives is the “One Big Beautiful Bill” (OBBB), which allocated $7.5 billion to the industry. This bill presents an unprecedented opportunity for companies seeking to contribute to the country’s domestic supply chain of critical minerals – a positive move for grid infrastructure, storage solutions and electrification projects that rely on the availability of critical minerals downstream. However, what’s outlined in the bill will only get these projects so far. The tricky, and often overlooked, part of funding projects is ensuring that the money is allocated to the right place.

# Investing in critical minerals is a power play

The $7.5 billion is a historic public investment in materials extraction and processing. The OBBB targets the securing of raw materials — specifically, critical minerals such as copper and rare earths — that many utilities in the US rely on. Scaling the technologies needed to mine, process and refine critical minerals is often easier and more cost-effective than those required in the semiconductor industry, opening the opportunity for many companies to benefit from this new source of revenue.

Additionally, the US Department of Energy (DOE) recently announced $1 billion in funding for five major initiatives, including lithium, nickel, rare earth elements, gallium and graphite, marking an instrumental next step in achieving American self-sufficiency. However, the reality is that it’s only a step. The money rightly aims at minerals essential for manufacturing key technologies; yet the real measure of impact will depend on where it is specifically invested. Targeting processing, recycling, or demonstration projects would make the funding far more effective in strengthening overall mineral use in the US.

The key will be to nurture new technologies that can win the future — those that can produce economically over the long term while modernizing the industry’s operations.

Funding should not be reinforcing legacy approaches that simply expand extraction or production capacity. To make the biggest impact, it should prioritize new innovation solutions that change the equation entirely: advanced refining techniques that use less energy and water, circular processes that recover critical material from waste, and digital tools that make extraction and processing more efficient.

These types of projects will deliver long-term impact while also reducing environmental impact, which will give the US a competitive edge in an increasingly sustainability-driven global market. They must also avoid the environmental liabilities that have led to the shuttering of operations in the past.

# Strengthening the middle of the supply chain

While access to resources is often seen as the bottleneck, the US already has substantial critical minerals right underneath our feet. Arizona, for example, alone, holds 71% of the nation’s copper and large amounts of other critical minerals.

To effectively direct funding for critical minerals, it’s imperative to understand where the money can be allocated and what efforts are already underway to improve specific aspects of the supply chain. The processes that stand to benefit most are those in the middle, including:

* **Extraction:** One of the major challenges the US faces today is that while it has large reserves of copper, lithium and rare earths, it’s not extracting them effectively. Take graphite, for example, a material essential to grid storage systems. In 2024, the United States imported around 60,000 tons of graphite to meet a consumption of 52,000 tons, with none of the graphite used being domestically produced. This dependence leaves the graphite supply chain extremely vulnerable. To solve this and reassure the US’ ability to secure graphite, there needs to be more focus on effectively determining what’s in the extracted ore. This can be achieved by investing in exploration methods that identify high-value deposits and funding research and development on recovery techniques for low-grade graphite.
* **Refinement:** Extracted ores must be refined to remove impurities and additional unwanted elements. This process transforms raw materials into high-purity outputs that can be utilized by manufacturers. Although the US can extract minerals, most of the time they are sent overseas to be refined, leaving the US in a vulnerable position. Today, China controls 90% of global refining capacity for rare earths, which gives it significant leverage over supply chains for clean energy and defense. With the obvious risk of relying too heavily on China for a critical piece of the process, the US needs to expand its own refining infrastructure. Luckily, this has already begun with Ucore’s rare earth facility in Louisiana and USA Rare Earth’s acquisition of LCM to expand metallization and strip casting. However, refining doesn’t just have an availability problem; it also has an energy problem. Aluminum smelting and copper refining, sectors where the US has significant expertise, require vast amounts of electricity. The same electricity powers businesses, households and the fast-growing data centers throughout the country. By investing in refining processes, the US must ensure that funding supports organizations committed to energy-efficient practices, as well as solutions that can help power these facilities for the long term.
* **Processing:** Processing happens when the refined minerals are put through a series of operations to turn them into ready-to-use products like battery-grade lithium or high-strength aluminum alloys. However, the US is starting to see momentum with the newly built processing facilities in Idaho, which are now refining high-grade ore from Montana’s Sheep Creek deposit for domestic use, as well as the two new DOE lithium processing projects that are advancing lithium refinement. These two examples are just the start of what’s to come — and companies looking to help innovate, power, and restore processing plants on US soil have an advantage when it comes to future grants and contracts.

# Where policy meets reality

The OBBB offers a rare opportunity to align national funding with the needs of industries that depend on critical minerals, with utilities being one of the most important of them.

Execution is everything here — without a clear understanding of the real bottlenecks and the potential of new technologies, billions of dollars could be spent on a project that only addresses some constraints. Not only do these projects need to be directed to the most critical areas, but they also need to provide high-quality, enduring solutions. That means having knowledgeable experts to guide government decisions, so that funding strengthens the supply chain in ways that allow industry to have confidence that the emerging supply base can sustain itself over the long term.

The stakes for utilities couldn’t be higher. Every transformer, transmission line and storage system depends on a consistent supply of high-quality materials, which is why aligning policy and investment is essential in securing the grid’s future. That alignment must favour new solutions over legacy projects. With federal funding supporting solutions that address the problems of efficiency, digitalization and sustainability, utilities and manufacturers can adopt cleaner, smarter methods that use energy more resourcefully and strengthen domestic capacity in the process. If done right, it can transform today’s supply chain risks and energy pressures into tomorrow’s competitive advantage.

# Dec. 8th, 2025~The next frontier for critical minerals

[The next frontier for critical minerals – Oil & Gas 360](https://www.oilandgas360.com/the-next-frontier-for-critical-minerals/)

*There is a rising global interest in extracting much-needed critical minerals from the Arctic to meet the growing needs for various metals and minerals. However, environmentalists are concerned about what impact the exploitation of vast untapped reserves in the region might have on wildlife and the environment. Despite potentially holding huge reserves of critical minerals, several countries have previously avoided mining activities and other invasive actions in the Arctic due to its fragile nature and the wide array of unknown challenges to development.*

https://preview.redd.it/p4zxo3c2s56g1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa6cb58459c49327ac7a094db951cca5b6491a74

Several countries around the globe are looking to develop their critical mineral mining and refining capacity to counter China’s dominance in the market. This has led some powers to look to the north to access vast untapped resources, with five in particular – Russia, Canada, the US, Denmark, and Norway – asserting their claims and [advancing their strategic interests](https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2025/05/11/the-arctic-imperative-russian-national-identity-resource-politics-and-geostrategic-power/) in the region.

“The Arctic is seen as a source of a lot of different raw materials, not only oil and gas, but a lot of strategic materials and rare earths… Greenland, right now, is a repository of a lot of base metals, precious metals, gemstones, rare earths, uranium … it’s all there. The problem is that up until recently, it was seen as completely unviable to actually mine them,” the associate professor at the Arctic University of Norway in Tromso, Marc Lanteigne, [stated](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/20/rare-earths-the-race-for-the-arctics-critical-minerals-is-heating-up.html).

“But with climate change and the ability to navigate the Arctic Ocean much more frequently, especially during the summer months, Greenland is starting to be looked at much more carefully as a potential alternative source for a lot of these strategic materials to China,” Lanteigne added.

Greenland’s landscape is rapidly changing in response to global warming, with ice sheet and glaciers melting and leaving behind wetlands, shrubland, and bare rock. This means that accessing critical minerals that were previously extremely difficult to reach may now be possible, which is driving greater international interest in the region.

Earlier this year, United States President Donald Trump suggested that [the U.S. might take ownership of Greenland](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/14/greenland-critical-minerals-are-big-part-of-donald-trumps-fixation.html), stating upon his inauguration in January that U.S. ownership of the autonomous Danish territory is an “[absolute necessity](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-says-ownership-greenland-absolute-necessity-rcna185197)” for “national security and freedom throughout the world.” Greenland’s Prime Minister Mute Egede quickly responded to Trump by saying the Arctic island is “[not for sale](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c791xy4pllqo)”.

In October, the Trump administration discussed the possibility of [purchasing an 8 percent stake in Critical Minerals Corp.,](https://www.reuters.com/business/trump-administration-eyes-stake-company-developing-greenland-rare-earths-mine-2025-10-03/) which would provide the U.S. with a direct interest in the largest rare earths project in Greenland. This follows other moves by the White House aimed at increasing the U.S. critical mineral mining and processing capacity to counter Chinese dominance.

The Toronto-based mining and exploration firm Amaroq is currently developing projects in Greenland, aiming to exploit the country’s rare earths. Amaroq [confirmed](https://www.londonstockexchange.com/news-article/AMRQ/west-greenland-hub-germanium-gallium-and-other-strategic-minerals-confirmed-at-west-greenland-hub/17320502) the discovery of commercial levels of germanium and gallium, which are widely used in electric vehicles and semiconductors, at its west Greenland hub in November.

Canada is pursuing greater Arctic investment to enhance its mineral mining capacity, looking to Ottawa to develop a national project. Prime Minister Mark Carney’s new nation-building agenda could encourage more critical minerals, infrastructure, and defence development in the country’s Arctic region, particularly in response to Canada’s increasingly strained relations with the United States.

Part of Carney’s potential nation-building activities is a “Arctic Economic and Security Corridor”, which could mean the [development of a road and port network](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/26/inside-canadas-new-arctic-ambition-this-is-not-a-no-mans-land-00615511) linking communities, aimed at driving economic development and supporting the Canadian Armed Forces in the North, with a focus on critical minerals development.

Meanwhile, Russia is exploring its Arctic potential, as it holds approximately 40 percent of the total land area beyond the Arctic coastline and is home to almost three-quarters of the Arctic population. In 2020, Moscow announced its “Arctic 2035″ plan, which includes infrastructure financing, economic expansion, and strategic importance for national security in the Arctic region. Russia is currently constructing a new nuclear-powered icebreaker ship to access Arctic waters.

The Scandinavian energy superpower Norway has also shown interest in developing its Arctic assets, announcing plans last year to [mine the seabed](https://www.mining.com/norway-forced-to-pause-arctic-seabed-mining-plans/) in Arctic-reaching territorial waters. However, development was halted after the small left-wing environmentalist group, the Socialist Left Party (SV), secured a deal to delay the initiative in return for its support for the national budget. The government had planned to issue its first deep-sea mining exploration licenses in early 2025, a move that attracted widespread [criticism](https://oilprice.com/Metals/Commodities/What-Does-Norways-Approval-of-Deep-Sea-Mining-Mean-for-the-Rest-of-the-World.html) from around the globe.

As the race for countries to expand their critical mineral mining capacity hots up, governments worldwide are considering developing operations in previously untapped regions of the world, with little regard for the potential environmental repercussions. Many countries are increasingly concerned about strengthening their energy and resource sovereignty in the face of trade wars and other growing geopolitical tensions.

The last 72 hours quietly rewrote the entire NioCorp story. EXIM Bank didn’t show up in Nebraska to record a ceremonial clip — the Chairman flat-out said Elk Creek is **“Exactly the type of project EXIM was always designed to support.”** EXIM does not issue statements like that on camera, in front of a Governor and a U.S. Senator, unless financing is effectively at the finish line. ***Senator Fischer’s presence only amplified the signal: she sits on Strategic Forces and has deep ties to critical-minerals policy.*** When EXIM is the capital, Fischer is the political spine, and DoD is the end-market, you’re looking at a project being positioned as a national security anchor, not a speculative mine.

NioCorp’s acquisition of FEA Materials’ Scandium-aluminum IP is the second seismic shift. For the first time in U.S. history, a **fully domestic, DFARS-compliant, mine-to-oxide-to-alloy scandium chain** exists within U.S. borders. Not Rio Tinto, not foreign intermediaries — this is a complete U.S. supply platform. This is the same model the Pentagon used to build the Titanium industry in the 1950s. Scandium is now following that template, **and NioCorp owns the only IP and resource combination capable of delivering it at scale!**

What most investors still haven’t grasped is that Scandium is just the first domino. Once EXIM funding is finalized — with UK and German ECAs likely co-participating — NioCorp can begin DFARS-qualification for its entire suite: niobium superalloys, titanium precursors (TiCl₄ → Ti metal), and REE magnet oxides (NdPr, Dy, Tb). Every one of these materials feeds U.S. fighter jets, hypersonics, missile systems, EV motors, and next-gen magnet factories. This isn’t a mine; it’s the backbone of a rebuilding American industrial base.

And now the timing catalyst is here: **Mark Smith presents at the RedChip “Race to Onshore Critical Minerals” conference on Dec. 10 at 11:00 AM ET.** After the EXIM video, Fischer’s appearance, and the Sc-Al IP announcement, this is the perfect platform for forward-looking commentary on financing, alloy manufacturing, REEs, and construction timelines. **The market is still asleep, but the U.S. government isn’t — and Elk Creek is being positioned as a multi-metal national security asset right now.**

***This is how you rebuild U.S. materials sovereignty —*** not one metal at a time, but with a single project that brings SEVEN critical minerals into four critical defense mineral chains back onshore at once!

**When the dust settles, Elk Creek won’t be “a mine.” It will be a cornerstone of the U.S. national security ecosystem.**  
The U.S. is signaling it. EXIM just confirmed it. And the global critical-mineral bottleneck is about to meet its first American challenger in decades.

We met in college and have been together for 3 years now. He is mostly a great boyfriend and makes me feel loved. But he has a really weird habit of not sharing certain details of his life with me and sometimes outright lying to me about them.

We have recently joined preparatory classes to prepare for graduate school applications. My classes are from 9 AM to 11 AM every day, and so are his, but we do not take them at the same institute. He joined a little later than I did because he wanted to find the right classes for himself.

When he finally decided where he would study, I asked him the name of his institute, and he hesitated to tell me, tried to brush it off, and acted like he did not remember the name, but finally said it was ""Lexis Institute"" and that it was within walking distance of 20 minutes away from where I study. I was really happy, excited, and supportive towards him.

However, for the past few days, things have been a little weird. The other day, I accidentally saw his institute's notebook cover and noticed that the name of the institute was ""Nexus Institute"" instead. But I did not think much of it because maybe I misheard him? Still, weirder things are going on.

After our classes end, he always comes to pick me up, and we have coffee or lunch together while talking about the day and how each of our classes went. Now the thing is, he never lets me pick HIM up, and if I suggest meeting halfway so as not to trouble him, he refuses, saying he would rather meet me at my building, and he reaches there really quickly, like it does not take him more than 10 minutes to reach me after his classes end, where it should take 20 minutes.

Until today, I had not thought much of this, but somewhere it did feel unfair to me that although he has already been to my building, the library I study at, and has even waited for me right outside my classroom with a glass door, I do not even know \*exactly\* where his building is. I am completely transparent to him about everything, but when it comes to him, certain things he does/says are very vague, and it feels like he is hiding something.

The major issue: today, as I was walking towards my classes, I noticed a billboard for ""Nexus Institute"" right next to my building. That's his institute. So his classes are in the building right next to mine, not 20 minutes away, and he has been lying to me about it for the past few weeks. Every day that I asked him if I could come visit him instead, and he'd hurriedly said no; he was not being chivalrous, just shady.

I was shocked when I saw the billboard, and I got through the entire class in a state of overthinking, feeling betrayed, and doubting everything. But why would he even lie about something so little?

Although this is not the first time. A few months ago, he had joined an internship and did not tell me until a month had passed. I had to hear about his internship from a mutual friend who happened to see him there before I got to hear it from him. I still have not brought it up to him that I already knew, but how much can I shove under the rug just to keep the peace?

He has an inherent nature of keeping things to himself. He even asks me not to share too much of my life with anyone, even my closest friends, because you never really know the intentions people really have. But the fact that he also applies this to me, his partner, and actively lies about things in his life, feels like a betrayal. AIO? Should I bring it up to him, and how?

Do I straight-up ask him about it, or wait and see how long he can keep this charade going?",7,1765278822.0,AIO,7,1.0,False

According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Coming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Can you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Can anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?"" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Check it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can't just decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Couple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me. You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today! - Today's the day. Come on! All the good jobs will be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Congratulations! Step to the side. - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first? - No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry? Barry! All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? - I'm going out. - Out? Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life. You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello? Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted. It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up. Really? Feeling lucky, are you? Sign here, here. Just initial that. - Thank you. - OK. You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain. So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats. Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us. Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada! - That's awful. - And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans! All right, launch positions! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Black and yellow! Hello! You ready for this, hot shot? Yeah. Yeah, bring it on. Wind, check. - Antennae, check. - Nectar pack, check. - Wings, check. - Stinger, check. Scared out of my shorts, check. OK, ladies, let's move it out! Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers! All of you, drain those flowers! Wow! I'm out! I can't believe I'm out! So blue. I feel so fast and free! Box kite! Wow! Flowers! This is Blue Leader. We have roses visual. Bring it around 30 degrees and hold. Roses! 30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around. Stand to the side, kid. It's got a bit of a kick. That is one nectar collector! - Ever see pollination up close? - No, sir. I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one. See that? It's a little bit of magic. That's amazing. Why do we do that? That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us. Cool. I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow. Could be daisies. Don't we need those?  that visual. Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move. Say again? You're reporting a moving flower? Affirmative. That was on the line! This is the coolest. What is it? I don't know, but I'm loving this color. It smells good. Not like a flower, but I like it. Yeah, fuzzy. Chemical-y. Careful, guys. It's a little grabby. My sweet lord of bees! Candy-brain, get off there! Problem! - Guys! - This could be bad. Affirmative. Very close. Gonna hurt. Mama's little boy. You are way out of position, rookie! Coming in at you like a missile! Help me! I don't think these are flowers. - Should we tell him? - I think he knows. What is this?! Match point! You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it! Yowser! Gross. There's a bee in the car! - Do something! - I'm driving! - Hi, bee. - He's back here! He's going to sting me! Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze! He blinked! Spray him, Granny! What are you doing?! Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable. I gotta get home. Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain. Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down! Ken, could you close the window please? Ken, could you close the window please? Check out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out. Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this. What was that? Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes! That is diabolical. It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies. What's number one? Star Wars? Nah, I don't go for that... ...kind of stuff. No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds. When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say. There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out. I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it. I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me. Wait! Stop! Bee! Stand back. These are winter boots. Wait! Don't kill him! You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me! Why does his life have less value than yours? Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement? I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling. My brochure! There you go, little guy. I'm not scared of him. It's an allergic thing. Put that on your resume brochure. My whole face could puff up. Make it one of your special skills. Knocking someone out is also a special skill. Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks. - Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night? - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever. - You could put carob chips on there. - Bye. - Supposed to be less calories. - Bye. I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something. All right, here it goes. Nah. What would I say? I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human. I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to. Oh, I can't do it. Come on! No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't. How should I start it? ""You like jazz?"" No, that's no good. Here she comes! Speak, you fool! Hi! I'm sorry. - You're talking. - Yes, I know. You're talking! I'm so sorry. No, it's OK. It's fine. I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed. Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting. This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee! I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me. And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised. That was a little weird. - I'm talking with a bee. - Yeah. I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me! I just want to say I'm grateful. I'll leave now. - Wait! How did you learn to do that? - What? The talking thing. Same way you did, I guess. ""Mama, Dada, honey."" You pick it up. - That's very funny. - Yeah. Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with. Anyway... Can I... ...get you something? - Like what? I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Coffee? I don't want to put you out. It's no trouble. It takes two minutes. - It's just coffee. - I hate to impose. - Don't be ridiculous! - Actually, I would love a cup. Hey, you want rum cake? - I shouldn't. - Have some. - No, I can't. - Come on! I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms. - Where? - These stripes don't help. You look great! I don't know if you know anything about fashion. Are you all right? No. He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison. He finally gets there. He runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on. And he says, ""Watermelon? I thought you said Guatemalan. Why would I marry a watermelon?"" Is that a bee joke? That's the kind of stuff we do. Yeah, different. So, what are you gonna do, Barry? About work? I don't know. I want to do my part for the hive, but I can't do it the way they want. I know how you feel. - You do? - Sure. My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist. - Really? - My only interest is flowers. Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan. Anyway, if you look... There's my hive right there. See it? You're in Sheep Meadow! Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond! No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once. - Why do girls put rings on their toes? - Why not? - It's like putting a hat on your knee. - Maybe I'll try that. - You all right, ma'am? - Oh, yeah. Fine. Just having two cups of coffee! Anyway, this has been great. Thanks for the coffee. Yeah, it's no trouble. Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life. Are you...? Can I take a piece of this with me? Sure! Here, have a crumb. - Thanks! - Yeah. All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not. OK, Barry. And thank you so much again... for before. Oh, that? That was nothing. Well, not nothing, but... Anyway... This can't possibly work. He's all set to go. We may as well try it. OK, Dave, pull the chute. - Sounds amazing. - It was amazing! It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life. Humans! I can't believe you were with humans! Giant, scary humans! What were they like? Huge and crazy. They talk crazy. They eat crazy giant things. They drive crazy. - Do they try and kill you, like on TV? - Some of them. But some of them don't. - How'd you get back? - Poodle. You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see. You had your ""experience."" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal. - Well... - Well? Well, I met someone. You did? Was she Bee-ish? - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you! - No, no, no, not a wasp. - Spider? - I'm not attracted to spiders. I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can't get by that face. So who is she? She's... human. No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law. - Her name's Vanessa. - Oh, boy. She's so nice. And she's a florist! Oh, no! You're dating a human florist! We're not dating. You're flying outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite! She saved my life! And she understands me. This is over! Eat this. This is not over! What was that? - They call it a crumb. - It was so stingin' stripey! And that's not what they eat. That's what falls off what they eat! - You know what a Cinnabon is? - No. It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up... Sit down! ...really hot! - Listen to me! We are not them! We're us. There's us and there's them! Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning? There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me! You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee! - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee. Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! There he is. He's in the pool. You know what your problem is, Barry? I gotta start thinking bee? How much longer will this go on? It's been three days! Why aren't you working? I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about. What life? You have no life! You have no job. You're barely a bee! Would it kill you to make a little honey? Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you. Martin, would you talk to him? Barry, I'm talking to you! You coming? Got everything? All set! Go ahead. I'll catch up. Don't be too long. Watch this! Vanessa! - We're still here. - I told you not to yell at him. He doesn't respond to yelling! - Then why yell at me? - Because you don't listen! I'm not listening to this. Sorry, I've gotta go. - Where are you going? - I'm meeting a friend. A girl? Is this why you can't decide? Bye. I just hope she's Bee-ish. They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena? To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream! Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering. A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events? No. All right, I've got one. How come you don't fly everywhere? It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster. Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right, your turn. TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane! You don't have that? We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease. Oh, my. Dumb bees! You must want to sting all those jerks. We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us. So you have to watch your temper. Very carefully. You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion: Anger, jealousy, lust. Oh, my goodness! Are you OK? Yeah. - What is wrong with you?! - It's a bug. He's not bothering anybody. Get out of here, you creep! What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular? Yeah, it was. How did you know? It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit. You've really got that down to a science. - I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue. - I'll bet. What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this? How did this get here? Cute Bee, Golden Blossom, Ray Liotta Private Select? - Is he that actor? - I never heard of him. - Why is this here? - For people. We eat it. You don't have enough food of your own? - Well, yes. - How do you get it? - Bees make it. - I know who makes it! And it's hard to make it! There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing! - It's organic. - It's our-ganic! It's just honey, Barry. Just what?! Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing! You've taken our homes, schools, hospitals! This is all we have! And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this. I'm getting to the bottom of all of this! Hey, Hector. - You almost done? - Almost. He is here. I sense it. Well, I guess I'll go home now and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around. You're busted, box boy! I knew I heard something. So you can talk! I can talk. And now you'll start talking! Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier? I don't understand. I thought we were friends. The last thing we want to do is upset bees! You're too late! It's ours now! You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword! You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio! Where is the honey coming from? Tell me where! Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms! Crazy person! What horrible thing has happened here? These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now they're on the road to nowhere! Just keep still. What? You're not dead? Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed? To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here. I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off! I'm going to Tacoma. - And you? - He really is dead. All right. Uh-oh! - What is that?! - Oh, no! - A wiper! Triple blade! - Triple blade? Jump on! It's your only chance, bee! Why does everything have to be so doggone clean?! How much do you people need to see?! Open your eyes! Stick your head out the window! From NPR News in Washington, I'm Carl Kasell. But don't kill no more bugs! - Bee! - Moose blood guy!! - You hear something? - Like what? Like tiny screaming. Turn off the radio. Whassup, bee boy? Hey, Blood. Just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see. Wow! I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it. I mean, that honey's ours. - Bees hang tight. - We're all jammed in. It's a close community. Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own. - What if you get in trouble? - You a mosquito, you in trouble. Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack! At least you're out in the world. You must meet girls. Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly. Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito. You got to be kidding me! Mooseblood's about to leave the building! So long, bee! - Hey, guys! - Mooseblood! I knew I'd catch y'all down here. Did you bring your crazy straw? We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit. What is this place? A bee's got a brain the size of a pinhead. They are pinheads! Pinhead. - Check out the new smoker. - Oh, sweet. That's the one you want. The Thomas 3000! Smoker? Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar. A couple breaths of this knocks them right out. They make the honey, and we make the money. ""They make the honey, and we make the money""? Oh, my! What's going on? Are you OK? Yeah. It doesn't last too long. Do you know you're in a fake hive with fake walls? Our queen was moved here. We had no choice. This is your queen? That's a man in women's clothes! That's a drag queen! What is this? Oh, no! There's hundreds of them! Bee honey. Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale! This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something. Oh, Barry, stop. Who told you humans are taking our honey? That's a rumor. Do these look like rumors? That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos. How did you get mixed up in this? He's been talking to humans. - What? - Talking to humans?! He has a human girlfriend. And they make out! Make out? Barry! We do not. - You wish you could. - Whose side are you on? The bees! I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night. Barry, this is what you want to do with your life? I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees! Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked your hands were still stirring. You couldn't stop. I remember that. What right do they have to our honey? We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever! Even if it's true, what can one bee do? Sting them where it really hurts. In the face! The eye! - That would hurt. - No. Up the nose? That's a killer. There's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters. Hive at Five, the hive's only full-hour action news source. No more bee beards! With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk. Weather with Storm Stinger. Sports with Buzz Larvi. And Jeanette Chung. - Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble. - And I'm Jeanette Chung. A tri-county bee, Barry Benson, intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey, packaging it and profiting from it illegally! Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King, we'll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book, Classy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon. Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson. Did you ever think, ""I'm a kid from the hive. I can't do this""? Bees have never been afraid to change the world. What about Bee Columbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus? Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans. We were thinking of stickball or candy stores. How old are you? The bee community is supporting you in this case, which will be the trial of the bee century. You know, they have a Larry King in the human world too. It's a common name. Next week... He looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots... Next week... Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest even though you just heard 'em. Bear Week next week! They're scary, hairy and here live. Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish. In tennis, you attack at the point of weakness! It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81. Honey, her backhand's a joke! I'm not gonna take advantage of that? Quiet, please. Actual work going on here. - Is that that same bee? - Yes, it is! I'm helping him sue the human race. - Hello. - Hello, bee. This is Ken. Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe. Why does he talk again? Listen, you better go 'cause we're really busy working. But it's our yogurt night! Bye-bye. Why is yogurt night so difficult?! You poor thing. You two have been at this for hours! Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help. - Frosting... - How many sugars? Just one. I try not to use the competition. So why are you helping me? Bees have good qualities. And it takes my mind off the shop. Instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now. Those are great, if you're three. And artificial flowers. - Oh, those just get me psychotic! - Yeah, me too. Bent stingers, pointless pollination. Bees must hate those fake things! Nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done. Maybe this could make up for it a little bit. - This lawsuit's a pretty big deal. - I guess. You sure you want to go through with it? Am I sure? When I'm done with the humans, they won't be able to say, ""Honey, I'm home,"" without paying a royalty! It's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan, where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history, we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak. What have we gotten into here, Barry? It's pretty big, isn't it? I can't believe how many humans don't work during the day. You think billion-dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers? Everybody needs to stay behind the barricade. - What's the matter? - I don't know, I just got a chill. Well, if it isn't the bee team. You boys work on this? All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding. All right. Case number 4475, Superior Court of New York, Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry is now in session. Mr. Montgomery, you're representing the five food companies collectively? A privilege. Mr. Benson... you're representing all the bees of the world? I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we're ready to proceed. Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my grandmother was a simple woman. Born on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us. If we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines, just think of what would it mean. I would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches! Talking bee! How do we know this isn't some sort of holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry? They could be using laser beams! Robotics! Ventriloquism! Cloning! For all we know, he could be on steroids! Mr. Benson? Ladies and gentlemen, there's no trickery here. I'm just an ordinary bee. Honey's pretty important to me. It's important to all bees. We invented it! We make it. And we protect it with our lives. Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take it from us 'cause we're the little guys! I'm hoping that, after this is all over, you'll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have but everything we are! I wish he'd dress like that all the time. So nice! Call your first witness. So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have. I suppose so. I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron! Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms. Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term. I don't imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you? - No. - I couldn't hear you. - No. - No. Because you don't free bees. You keep bees. Not only that, it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey. They're very lovable creatures. Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear. You mean like this? Bears kill bees! How'd you like his head crashing through your living room?! Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows! OK, that's enough. Take him away. So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me. - Where have I heard it before? - I was with a band called The Police. But you've never been a police officer, have you? No, I haven't. No, you haven't. And so here we have yet another example of bee culture casually stolen by a human for nothing more than a prance-about stage name. Oh, please. Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting? Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting. Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner! That's not his real name?! You idiots! Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005. Thank you. Thank you. I see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome with a churning inner turmoil that's ready to blow. I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime? Not yet it isn't. But is this what it's come to for you? Exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don't have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir? Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now! This isn't a goodfella. This is a badfella! Why doesn't someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?! - Order in this court! - You're all thinking it! Order! Order, I say! - Say it! - Mr. Liotta, please sit down! I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that. I think the jury's on our side. Are we doing everything right, legally? I'm a florist. Right. Well, here's to a great team. To a great team! Well, hello. - Ken! - Hello. I didn't think you were coming. No, I was just late. I tried to call, but... the battery. I didn't want all this to go to waste, so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free. Oh, that was lucky. There's a little left. I could heat it up. Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever. So I hear you're quite a tennis player. I'm not much for the game myself. The ball's a little grabby. That's where I usually sit. Right... there. Ken, Barry was looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill. You think I don't see what you're doing? I know how hard it is to find the rightjob. We have that in common. Do we? Bees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out. That's just what I was thinking about doing. Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was all right. I'm going to drain the old stinger. Yeah, you do that. Look at that. You know, I've just about had it with your little mind games. - What's that? - Italian Vogue. Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages. A lot of ads. Remember what Van said, why is your life more valuable than mine? Funny, I just can't seem to recall that! I think something stinks in here! I love the smell of flowers. How do you like the smell of flames?! Not as much. Water bug! Not taking sides! Ken, I'm wearing a Chapstick hat! This is pathetic! I've got issues! Well, well, well, a royal flush! - You're bluffing. - Am I? Surf's up, dude! Poo water! That bowl is gnarly. Except for those dirty yellow rings! Kenneth! What are you doing?! You know, I don't even like honey! I don't eat it! We need to talk! He's just a little bee! And he happens to be the nicest bee I've met in a long time! Long time? What are you talking about?! Are there other bugs in your life? No, but there are other things bugging me in life. And you're one of them! Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night... My nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster! Goodbye, Ken. And for your information, I prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners made by man! I'm sorry about all that. I know it's got an aftertaste! I like it! I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me. I couldn't overcome it. Oh, well. Are you OK for the trial? I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas. We would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand. Good idea! You can really see why he's considered one of the best lawyers... Yeah. Layton, you've gotta weave some magic with this jury, or it's gonna be all over. Don't worry. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they don't like about bees. - You got the tweezers? - Are you allergic? Only to losing, son. Only to losing. Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you what I think we'd all like to know. What exactly is your relationship to that woman? We're friends. - Good friends? - Yes. How good? Do you live together? Wait a minute... Are you her little... ...bedbug? I've seen a bee documentary or two. From what I understand, doesn't your queen give birth to all the bee children? - Yeah, but... - So those aren't your real parents! - Oh, Barry... - Yes, they are! Hold me back! You're an illegitimate bee, aren't you, Benson? He's denouncing bees! Don't y'all date your cousins? - Objection! - I'm going to pincushion this guy! Adam, don't! It's what he wants! Oh, I'm hit!! Oh, lordy, I am hit! Order! Order! The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins! I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction! You see? You can't treat them like equals! They're striped savages! Stinging's the only thing they know! It's their way! - Adam, stay with me. - I can't feel my legs. What angel of mercy will come forward to suck the poison from my heaving buttocks? I will have order in this court. Order! Order, please! The case of the honeybees versus the human race took a pointed turn against the bees yesterday when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery. - Hey, buddy. - Hey. - Is there much pain? - Yeah. I... I blew the whole case, didn't I? It doesn't matter. What matters is you're alive. You could have died. I'd be better off dead. Look at me. They got it from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich. Look, there's a little celery still on it. What was it like to sting someone? I can't explain it. It was all... All adrenaline and then... and then ecstasy! All right. You think it was all a trap? Of course. I'm sorry. I flew us right into this. What were we thinking? Look at us. We're just a couple of bugs in this world. What will the humans do to us if they win? I don't know. I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn't sound so bad. Adam, they check in, but they don't check out! Oh, my. Could you get a nurse to close that window? - Why? - The smoke. Bees don't smoke. Right. Bees don't smoke. Bees don't smoke! But some bees are smoking. That's it! That's our case! It is? It's not over? Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere. Get back to the court and stall. Stall any way you can. And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub. Mr. Flayman. Yes? Yes, Your Honor! Where is the rest of your team? Well, Your Honor, it's interesting. Bees are trained to fly haphazardly, and as a result, we don't make very good time. I actually heard a funny story about... Your Honor, haven't these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court's valuable time? How much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on? They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients, who run legitimate businesses. I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case! Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery's motion. But you can't! We have a terrific case. Where is your proof? Where is the evidence? Show me the smoking gun! Hold it, Your Honor! You want a smoking gun? Here is your smoking gun. What is that? It's a bee smoker! What, this? This harmless little contraption? This couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a bee. Look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, ""Smoking or non?"" Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted to smoke machines and man-made wooden slat work camps? Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man? - What are we gonna do? - He's playing the species card. Ladies and gentlemen, please, free these bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! The court finds in favor of the bees! Vanessa, we won! I knew you could do it! High-five! Sorry. I'm OK! You know what this means? All the honey will finally belong to the bees. Now we won't have to work so hard all the time. This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson. You'll regret this. Barry, how much honey is out there? All right. One at a time. Barry, who are you wearing? My sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants. - What if Montgomery's right? - What do you mean? We've been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years. Congratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement? First, we'll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps. Then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with, every last drop. We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a filthy, smelly, bad-breath stink machine. We're all aware of what they do in the woods. Wait for my signal. Take him out. He'll have nauseous for a few hours, then he'll be fine. And we will no longer tolerate bee-negative nicknames... But it's just a prance-about stage name! ...unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products and la-dee-da human tea-time snack garnishments. Oan't breathe. Bring it in, boys!

Does it actually help?,"I’ve been reading and hearing a lot about the London AS Diet lately  basically a diet where you avoid starchy foods to see if inflammation or flare-ups reduce.

I’m not recommending anything…
I’m just genuinely curious because many AS warriors online talk about it.

Here’s the simple version of what the diet says:


✅ Foods people say are okay:

Chicken, fish, eggs, tofu

Spinach, cucumber, carrot, capsicum, broccoli, mushrooms

Green grapes, melon, kiwi, jamun, coconut, apple

Walnuts, pine nuts, lightly boiled almonds

Tea, coffee, herbal tea


❌ Foods they avoid:

Wheat, rice, oats, barley, corn

Potato, sweet potato, beetroot, pumpkin

Pulses/lentils (dal), chickpeas, beans

Dairy

Peanuts, cashews

Raisins, dates

Green banana

My thoughts:

Honestly… this list feels very strict.
And I know every AS warrior’s body reacts differently.

But I’m curious:

Has anyone here personally tried this diet?

Did it help with pain or stiffness?

Did you feel no change at all?

Was it too hard to follow?


You can share even a small experience
it might help.

I'm using the ES701EU for months now, and am very happy with it. However, I have one issue with it that is really annoying.

When the coffee flows from portafilter it sometimes splatters a bit to the outside. 

This isn't a problem for bigger cups, but it is quite annoying for single dose(less flow also) smaller espresso cups. 

 I almost used metal files to modify the portafilter holes a bit, but before I go and try/go that route(eind result would probably be worse then it is now 😆), maybe someone knows how to solve this in a better way.

Thank you in advance.

1pi4mq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/geneva/comments/1pi4mq8/anyone_in_geneva_into_niche_perfumes/,Anyone in Geneva into niche perfumes?,"Hi everyone,

My colleague and I are exploring the idea of organizing a small niche / independent perfume pop-up in Geneva, something curated and focused on artistic, hard-to-find perfume houses.

We’re talking about brands that usually aren’t available in Switzerland, and that lean more towards craftsmanship, storytelling, and unique compositions rather than mainstream releases.

Before we go any further, we wanted to get a sense of the local interest:

Would people in Geneva be excited about a weekend pop-up where you could discover and smell a selection of independent perfume houses?  
  
(Small cocktails / coffee element included)

We’re in early stages right now (collecting feedback before planning the location and date), so any thoughts are genuinely helpful:

* Would you attend something like this?
* Preferred neighbourhood?

1pi4lot,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pi4lot,🛒☕🎄 Tournée des popottes sur les marchés du Grand Sud-Ouest Parisien : chronique d’un samedi matin de décembre,"▪️ Il est 7 heures du matin ce samedi de décembre, et déjà la place de la Libération à Rambouillet s’anime. Dans la pénombre, les commerçants ambulants achèvent l’installation de leurs étals sous la lumière des lampadaires. C’est l’heure magique, celle où tout se joue, où les conversations vont bon train autour d’un café fumant du foodtruck d’Arlo’s Coffee. Pour qui veut prendre le pouls de la ville, comprendre les enjeux du territoire, saisir l’air du temps, c’est ici et maintenant que cela se passe.  
  
🔹 Le marché de Rambouillet : un observatoire de la vie locale  
  
▪️ Levés depuis plusieurs heures, rôtisseur et rôtisseuse, boulangère, marchands de primeurs, producteurs et éleveurs, fromagère, poissonnier, vendeuse d’huîtres, charcutier, boucher, torréfacteur, traiteuse… tous sont déjà au milieu de leur journée de travail. Ces professionnels incarnent le commerce de proximité, celui qui résiste à l’uniformisation des grandes surfaces et maintient vivant le cœur des villes.  
  
▪️ Mais le marché n’est pas qu’un lieu de commerce. C’est aussi un espace de sociabilité où se croisent une humanité bigarrée : foodtruckeuses libanaise et vietnamienne, vendeuse de bières, apiculteur, spécialiste du cookie, marchand de casseroles, placier bien sûr, mais aussi clients matinaux, présidents d’association, candidats aux élections, élus de la République, et même quelques habitués qui préfèrent éviter la foule de la mi-matinée.  
  
▪️ Ce moment particulier constitue un véritable observatoire de la vie locale. On y papote, on y échange des nouvelles, on y commente l’actualité. C’est le lieu névralgique où circule l’information informelle, celle qui ne figure pas encore dans les journaux mais qui dit beaucoup de l’état d’esprit d’une communauté.  
  
🔹 Le Lys : poste d’observation privilégié  
  
▪️ Après ce premier tour du marché, direction Le Lys, institution rambolitaine posée juste en face de la place. Joseph, Sandrine et Marc y maintiennent une tradition d’accueil qui fait de cet établissement bien plus qu’un simple bar-brasserie : un lieu de rencontre, de discussion, de vie.  
  
▪️ L’hiver, la petite table ronde collée à la vitre offre une vue imprenable sur la terrasse, l’hôtel de ville et le marché. De ce poste d’observation, on embrasse d’un regard toute l’effervescence de la place de la Libération. Chaque décembre, le rituel est le même : immortaliser la crèche de Noël que Joseph élabore avec fierté. À la fois directeur artistique, concepteur et réalisateur, il se renouvelle chaque année, mêlant inspiration chrétienne (la crèche traditionnelle avec l’Enfant Jésus, l’âne et le bœuf) et influences laïques (santons de Provence, décorations glanées tout au long de l’année).  
  
🔹 Rituel du samedi matin : omelette, café et presse  
  
▪️ Vers 8h30, l’heure est au petit-déjeuner : omelette-salade généreuse, grand café et verre de blanc bien frais. Puis vient le temps de la lecture avec l’expresso, le croissant et les journaux achetés dans les kiosques du coin. C’est le moment de la revue de presse, celui où l’actualité locale et nationale se mêle aux observations de la matinée.  
  
▪️ Et parfois, la tentation est trop forte de prolonger cette chronique matinale par un article. C’est ce qui s’est produit samedi dernier avec la publication en direct depuis Le Lys de l’article “Matillon repart, Balkany revient (presque) : un samedi au Lys”. L’occasion était trop belle de mettre en perspective deux campagnes municipales que tout oppose : d’un côté Rambouillet, ville tranquille presque provinciale, où Véronique Matillon annonce sa candidature à sa propre succession ; de l’autre Levallois-Perret, ville bourgeoise de l’ouest parisien, où le très médiatique couple Balkany, empêché de se représenter, soutient la candidature de Jérôme Gauliard, figure connue de la Vallée de Chevreuse toute proche.

🔹 Le périple dominical : Clairefontaine, Saint-Arnoult, Bonnelles  
  
▪️ Le temps file à une vitesse folle. Le lendemain dimanche, dès 8 heures du matin, le périple reprend à travers les marchés et les cafés de Clairefontaine-en-Yvelines, Saint-Arnoult-en-Yvelines et Bonnelles. Chaque commune a sa personnalité, ses habitués, ses commerçants fidèles. Ce tour des marchés dominicaux permet de prendre la mesure de la diversité de ce Grand Sud-Ouest Parisien, à la fois rural et périurbain, ancré dans ses traditions et tourné vers l’avenir.  
  
🔹 Détour aux Bréviaires : marché de Noël et littérature jeunesse  
  
▪️ L’après-midi, détour final au marché de Noël des Bréviaires. L’occasion de retrouver Virginie Allaghen, influenceuse média de la première heure, transformée ce jour-là en véritable renne de Noël avec son pull rouge festif. Accompagnée de son “lutin préféré”, elle tenait un stand XXL pour promouvoir “Artur et l’Étoile Bleue”, ouvrage signé Michel Cavard.  
  
▪️ Ce dernier, influenceur média à la voix reconnaissable entre mille, correspondant du GSO News en Vendée et commentateur star de la Transat virtuelle “Forum de l’Info”, a même bénéficié d’une dédicace de Francis Lalanne en préface de son livre. Un cadeau idéal à glisser sous le sapin, qui témoigne de la vitalité créative de la communauté du GSO Parisien News.  
  
🔹 Entre virtuel et réel : la complémentarité des espaces  
  
▪️ Après une année entière à animer les émissions de streaming live sur la chaîne Totale Impro 2.0 sur Twitch, YouTube, LinkedIn et Facebook, ces moments d’immersion dans le monde réel des marchés constituent une respiration essentielle. Le virtuel et le physique ne s’opposent pas, ils se complètent. Les rencontres de visu enrichissent les contenus numériques, tandis que la diffusion en ligne prolonge et amplifie les échanges de la place publique.  
  
▪️ C’est cette double présence, à la fois dans les pixels des réseaux sociaux et sur le pavé des marchés, qui fait la richesse du journalisme de proximité tel que le pratique le GSO Parisien News et ses influenceur·euses médias. Être là où bat le cœur de la cité, écouter, observer, raconter. Puis partager, diffuser, créer du lien au-delà des frontières physiques.  
  
🔹 Ceux qui font vibrer le territoire  
  
▪️ Les photos jointes à cet article témoignent de cette vie locale foisonnante. On y retrouve les figures emblématiques de nos marchés et commerces, ceux et celles qui, par leur présence fidèle et leur passion du métier, font vibrer le Grand Sud-Ouest Parisien. Commerçants ambulants, producteurs locaux, artisans du goût, créateurs en tous genres : ils sont les véritables acteurs de ce territoire vivant.  
  
▪️ En cette période de fêtes, où les discours sur la désertification commerciale et la crise du commerce de proximité saturent l’espace médiatique, ces tournées matinales rappellent une réalité plus nuancée. Oui, les centres-villes vivent des transformations profondes. Mais non, tout n’est pas perdu. Partout où subsistent des liens, de la convivialité, un esprit de communauté, la vie locale résiste et se réinvente.  
  
▪️ Les marchés de Rambouillet, Clairefontaine, Saint-Arnoult et Bonnelles en sont la preuve vivante. La communauté GSO News ne s’arrête pas là : à vous d’amplifier le mouvement ! Devenez acteurs de l’info locale, multipliez les tournées des popotes dans vos communes, et transformez-vous en influenceurs média engagés.

1pi4b8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pi4b8d/the_wreck_of_the_jonathan_winewater/,The Wreck of the Jonathan Winewater,">\[Introduction: 

>Among the many tales of tragedy and heroism on the Great Lakes, none are more famous than the wreck of the taconite ore hauler SS Edmund Fitzgerald on November 10th, 1975. 

>

>Rightfully so, as she was the most well-known ship on the lakes, if a ship can be a celebrity, she surely was, and her loss is still felt in the region today. 

>

>Being familiar with the region myself, I was well aware of her sinking and the facts that surrounded it. Among them, repeated in media from documentaries to newspapers to internet videos, is the assertion, given as fact, that she was the last big ship to ever sink on the Lakes. 

>

>Lakes which had lost ships at an alarming rate for their entire history to that point. This, it is said, was because of the changes made to the industry after her sinking. 

>

>So imagine my surprise when, while researching for a book I was planning to write on the Lakes and their many ghost stories, I found that she was not in fact the last large ship to sink beneath their waters. 

>

>It started in May of 2020 when I stumbled across an old newspaper obituary that read “Otto Fredrik Carlsen, age 49, of Gary, Indiana, passed away tragically on January 3, 1977, in the line of duty as First Mate aboard the SS Jonathan Winewater, which was lost during a severe winter storm on Lake Superior.”

>

>These words set me on a quest to learn everything I could about the Jonathan Winewater, as it seemed to me that it had been forgotten to history, and soon I abandoned my plans to write about ghost stories at all. 

>Learning anything other than that the ship had existed was surprisingly hard, but eventually I was able to put together this much information. The SS Jonathan Winewater was launched in 1960, owned by the now-defunct Maryland-based company Winewater International and named for its founder.

>

>The Winewater was in all respects a typical ship of the period, without anything of note to set it apart, anything that is except the fact that its sinking seems to have been almost deliberately ignored. 

>

>Excepting a handful of obituaries for the crew and a single line in an Erie, Pennsylvania, Newspaper, the Lakeshore Star, there was no coverage whatsoever of the tragedy. Similarly strange was that the owners, a successful and seemingly stable company, would declare bankruptcy soon after, citing the loss of a major investor in connection with the wreck.

>

>The coast guard had been only slightly less quiet after the accident, saying only that the ship had been found beached in two pieces on the Canadian coast and was being scrapped by the owners. 

>

>When trying to find pictures of this wreck washed ashore in Canada, I found none. Why was this? I was hooked and smelled a cover-up here, so I began to dig deeper. 

>

>However, after years of researching and interviewing people connected to the tragedy, I barely knew more than I had at the start.

>

>Oh, I understood the crew better and knew more particulars about the design of the ship. I even eventually found a single picture of the wreck, in, of all things, a tiny German-language newspaper from North Dakota, “Der Prairie Zeitung,” a small and grainy black and white shot taken from a cheap camera. 

>

>But I knew nothing more about why the ship had sunk, what had become of the remainder of the wreck, or anything concrete with which to write a book; at most, I had a chapter. Disheartened, I gave up and moved on to new things, that is, until a chance encounter with an old acquaintance whose son was serving in the Coast Guard, where he was heading a project to modernize their archive system and transfer much of it to digital storage gave me an in. 

>

>After a few more months of meetings and explaining the idea behind my book to various important people, I was finally given access to the archives, where I found… nothing. 

>

>At least at first. After two weeks of searching and just when I was about to give up for a second time, I found a file at the bottom of a box I had overlooked. It was thinner than most and slightly water-damaged from improper storage, but the words on the tape still clearly read “Winewater”

>My heart jumped for joy when I saw that, but dropped again when I saw how little was in the folder. Two sheets of paper and a small notebook were all it contained.

>

>The papers were both identical copies of an unusually poor quality report on the wreck, far shorter and less detailed than was usual for Coast Guard reports, that told me nothing I had not already known. 

>

>The small book, however, a pocket notebook, was more than I could ever have bargained for. Allegedly written by the ship’s cook, what follows is one of the most inexplicable accounts I have ever read. I post it here in the hope that someone will be able to make more sense of it than I have, or perhaps just to prove to me that it is fake, a hoax, or a lie. 

>

>When the SS Jonathan Winewater left port on December 31, 1976, it had 16 people aboard, comprising 15 crew members and 1 passenger. Sixteen people, but if these final words of Ship’s Cook, Thomas Faegan, are to be believed, only fifteen souls. \]

**The Wreck of the Jonathan Winewater:**

I know I am to die, so I write this accounting of our fate that the world might know there are things its philosophy has never dreamed of. Things older and darker than man wishes to imagine 

I am, I suppose, the captain of the bulk carrier SS Jonathan Winewater, but only by the virtue of my own Irish Luck. The rest of the crew are dead, leaving me alone, the ship’s cook, and all but retired to hold her helm. And hold it I shall, until my watch ends wherever I may find a shore, even if they are the shores of hell. 

Sitting on the table next to me is a length of rope. When I have finished penning this account, I intend to tie my hands to the wheel and steer her true for as long as my strength holds. Not long, I fear, the pain of my broken leg is gone now, and the cold is already sapping my strength.

I hear her calling me. The witch of the lakes, her banshee howl in the screaming of the wind through wires, tells me I am damned. I would welcome her. What better fate for a sailor than to perish with his ship? 

I am old, and leave no one behind to mourn; if it weren’t for the thing I believe to be aboard, I would accept my fate with a smile. But I fear for what will happen if it gets ashore. Still, I was the cook on her maiden voyage seventeen years ago, and if there is a chance I can still save her, I must try! 

If any should find this and read it, then I pray you will see it as more than the insane ramblings of a broken man, and take its warning. God save you all. 

We left the port of Erie on New Year's Eve 1976, bound for Thunder Bay, with fifteen souls aboard, a skeleton crew to her regular complement of twenty-nine, myself a last-minute addition to the roster.

I had been retired five years when I received the call from Captain Leclerc, my old shipmate, asking me to cover for Teddy, the young man I had trained to replace me, what seems now a lifetime ago when I finally left the lakes. The Winewater had to make one final unscheduled run this season on short notice. But Teddy was getting married that weekend, and so could not sail. 

Leclerc, knowing I loved the ship I had left behind, and that I was not in the best of situations financially since my divorce, gave me a call and asked if I wanted to take one last cruise with him on my old ship. My answer, of course, was “yes”.

The pay was unheard of, double pay and a potential bonus beyond that. But I would’ve sailed for free, if asked, retirement did not suit me.

I confess I am one of the last of that old breed of sailors whose wife is the water, and whose child is the deck beneath his feet. It made me a terrible romantic and a worse husband. Worst of all, it made me happy. 

When I arrived aboard her, I asked Leclerc what we were hauling this late in the season, and his answer confused me more than not knowing had. 

Our hold was to be empty except for a small load of ballast to keep her stable. And instead, we were to haul a cargo of forty-five wooden boxes, and not ask questions. 

He seemed as confused as I, and anxious to be making such a run this time of year,  this route was never safe this late in the season. But the request had come from the owners themselves, a favor to a Shareholder, he said. 

An aging and wealthy European, the Countess DuCharme, who would be coming aboard before we sailed. In more than fifty years with the company, I had never heard of such a request. Still, our pay made it worth it to all aboard, and I felt the call of the lakes. 

Around midnight the night before we were to sail, I made my way to the galley to check our supplies and add some of the special ingredients I had bought to the refrigerator. Planning to pull out all the stops and treat the crew to something special this run; it only seemed right. 

Because I had come in so early, I was there when the cargo arrived, two large trucks marked with the Winewater International logo. 

I watched with casual interest as the Longshoremen loaded crate after crate aboard on pallets, several at a time, and wondered idly how they intended to secure them, as we were not designed for that type of cargo, being an ore hauler. I would later learn they were stowed in out-of-the-way corners of the engineering deck.

I was struck by the speed and efficiency with which they loaded them. I had never seen longshoremen work so fast. It's an old joke that they would get in trouble with their union if they did a job without taking at least three breaks. Today, however, they moved as if they wanted the job done as soon as possible, something that I found to be strangely unsettling. 

What stood out to me about the boxes, however, was what they looked like. Simple wooden crates about seven feet long by two feet wide, they resembled nothing as closely as they did coffins. 

Perhaps they were, the thought made me shudder, but it would have explained the Longshoremen’s attitudes. So I resolved to be there when the Captain welcomed the consignor aboard, so that I could get a look at her. 

When she arrived, we were all surprised. We had been told to expect an elderly woman, but the girl who boarded just before sunrise couldn't have been more than 20. 

She wore a long, conservatively cut dress made of some expensive black fabric I can’t name. On anyone else, it would've seemed like a costume; it was so old-fashioned. But she carried herself with such confidence that it barely registered as unusual.

She walked with surprising speed, given the dress, up the gangplank, but stopped still before stepping through the hatch, her eyes darting to the Captain as she asked, “Permission to come aboard?” in a soft, faintly accented voice.

Taking the Captain’s arm as she stepped over the bulkhead, she told us she was the “Countess DuCharme’s granddaughter” and that her “Dear grandmother” had taken suddenly ill and could not join us. She showed the captain papers that said as much and that she was empowered to act as the Countess’ agent, and the captain nodded sympathetically. 

Things were so strange as they were that we didn’t question this as much as perhaps we should have. In truth, the others were all upset at the overtime and wanted only to be done and home with the money from this run in their pockets. So they shrugged and welcomed her aboard. I alone voiced questions, and these later, while alone with the captain. 

As she passed me in the hall, I caught a faint hint of what I took to be an unusual perfume, floral and slightly metallic. It was unpleasant, but I don’t, as a rule, question taste. Her dress was unusual, too. 

Outside in the harsh dockside lighting, I had taken it to be all black, but as she passed close to me, I saw that it had a strange swirling pattern all over it in a very thin red thread, so dark it could only be told apart from the black when the light caught it as she moved. 

The effect was mesmerizing, and I realized I was staring, which embarrassed me, of course, since I did not want her to think I was leering. Still, I found it hard to look away as she passed. 

As soon as she was aboard and had handed her bags to The Kid, as we collectively called any of the cadets from the maritime academy who did their internship on the Winewater. She turned to the captain and asked to see the cargo. Having work of my own to do to get ready for breakfast, I left then and returned to the galley.

Around twenty minutes later, Leclerc ducked into my galley and told me not to worry about cooking for our guest. I asked why, and made a joke about how I hoped she hadn’t gone overboard.

We shared a small laugh before he explained that she had been exhausted after several days of near sleepless travel and had elected to just go to bed. 

I shrugged, one less mouth wouldn’t change the calculus of the kitchen all that much, but before Leclerc could leave, I told him to stay a minute while I asked him some questions. 

First and most important was; if those boxes had truly been what they looked like. Because without a doubt, they looked like one thing and one thing only. 

He shook his head and said no. While down with DuCharme to inspect them, he had glanced at the customs paperwork stapled to them, which included a manifest saying they were boxes of dirt being shipped to a university laboratory in Alaska, and that they had come from East Germany. 

This was strange enough, but Leclerc assured me that all the papers had been in order, and reminded me we were instructed not to ask questions. He said that the owners had vouched for her and made it clear we were not doing anything illegal, but that the secrecy was necessary. 

Unsure of this myself, I remarked that “We have dirt in the states,” but the Captain just told me not to worry about it. It is an old man’s job to worry, and I told him as much, but pushed things no farther. If only I had, if only!

None of the crew saw our guest for the rest of the day until after dinner, when the Captain, myself, and a few of the other old hands were sitting in the mess hall having coffee and playing cards. She came in so quietly that it took her clearing her throat for us to notice her. 

The Captain was apologetic over her having missed two meals, and I offered to make her something, but she refused, saying she was on a special diet and had pre-packaged meals in her room. Eventually, the Captain did convince her to have a cup of coffee with us at least. 

I thought he was being a bit pushy, but I sensed he wanted to get a read on her, given how generally strange this was. She made polite small talk but told little. I noticed she did not appear to enjoy her coffee, only taking a few small sips and then setting it aside. 

The weather the next day was calm as we made our way through Detroit and into Lake Huron, but by the evening, as we were passing by Manitoulin Island, the National Weather Service was warning of a storm brewing ahead of us.

With any other Captain, I would have feared to sail against a storm this late in the season, but Leclerc was to these lakes what Nelson was to Trafalgar.  While some of the less experienced crew were clearly nervous, I never feared. Younger than me by about twenty years, I had been cook on the Allan W. Chambers when he was just a rookie, and had taken him under my wing for a time. We had lost touch for a few years after that, until he became captain of the Winewater in the late sixties, where we renewed our friendship.

He was one of the very few truly good captains I ever knew, and could brave any storm. To whoever is reading this, he would have braved this one, too. If it were not for that thing. Let the record show, when this is investigated, that if he could not save our ship, no man alive or dead could have. And on that I stake my reputation!

For Breakfast that morning, I made the crew steak and eggs with a side of hash browns, and for our engineer, a short, broad man from Alabama known simply as Bubba, a pot of grits.

We all ate and talked with obviously high morale, despite the grumbling about more time away from home from most of the men. A few of the younger men pestered me for stories from the old days, which I was happy to tell.

Then someone suggested The Kid grab his guitar and sing us a song. We all had work to do, but the captain seemed in no hurry and told him to go ahead. He played an old love song and sang with a clear, sweet voice. 

That was just two days ago, but now I cannot even remember the song, so much sorrow has come since.

By lunch, we were steaming north through Huron, hugging the Canadian side of the line with the coast of the Bruce Peninsula visible through a light fog to starboard. 

The Countess’s Granddaughter stayed in her room most of the day; however, around seven PM, as we were beginning our approach to the Soo Locks at Sault Sainte Marie. I stepped out on deck to smoke and saw her standing up by the bow, head tilted slightly down, as if in prayer. Despite the apparent innocence of this act, something about it struck me with a feeling of dread I could not explain. But this only lasted a moment, as she turned and began walking back in my direction, and the effect was gone. It’s only now that I think back, I realize that she had no shadow. 

I had terrible nightmares that night, of distant eyes red as the fires of hell watching me wherever I went, and woke up covered in a cold sweat several times. 

We traversed the Soo Locks around noon on the second, passing into Lake Superior for the final leg of our journey. By then, the weather had already begun to turn, and I could feel an unease in the air. 

Walking to my cabin that afternoon to retrieve a book I had been reading, I passed DuCharme speaking with The Kid in the hall. While not against the rules, Cadets speaking with VIPs had been known to put their feet in their mouths before, causing problems for the entire crew and their young careers. 

So, taking it upon myself, as the ship’s grandfather that I was, I interjected myself to make sure everything was alright. DuCharme gave a small laugh, instantly seeming to read what I was doing, and said she had been asking The Kid about his family, just passing the time. Not unusual, as they were similar in age. 

That said, something seemed wrong to me, so I took The Kid aside, telling her I needed his help and questioned him. He had a weird look about him, slightly glassy-eyed and vacant, which I thought may just have been the result of the ship’s rolling motion. Which can affect men with a weak inner ear, almost like alcohol, after enough time. 

Still, I didn’t truly believe that to be the case; I could not explain why. He shook himself, seeming to throw off some fog, and blinked at me before he seemed to get his mental feet under him. But corroborated her story that they had just been having a casual conversation. 

I wanted to push farther, but didn’t really have a reason to do so, so I dropped it. Of course, now I wish I hadn’t. 

The weather continued to get worse, the wind picking up to a constant whine and a bitter cold slowly creeping in, until by sunset we were sailing through a storm. The ship rolled on the waves as we steamed towards our destination, which by the charts was about another day from where we were. 

At dinner, Carlsen, the mate, told me in confidence that Leclerc was considering putting in somewhere to wait out the storm despite the risk that would pose to the bonuses we had been promised for a speedy delivery. 

That night, the first tragedy of our voyage would strike, but nobody would realize until the next morning. 

I was in the galley discussing the day’s menu with the captain when Bubba stuck his head in through the hatch, looking worried. He asked if he could have a minute of the captain’s time, and Leclerc nodded, asking him, “What's up?”

The Kid wasn’t in his bunk when Bubba, his roommate aboard, woke up, already unusual as Bubba was the early riser of the pair. It instantly became more worrying when Bubba told us his boots were still next to his bed, where he’d taken them off the night before. 

Leclerc quickly organized a search of the ship, but we found no trace of him, and soon it became obvious that he was not aboard. Neither was DuCharme, which, while worse, did not upset the crew nearly as much. 

As soon as the search was finished, Leclerc ordered everyone not doing crucial work to gather in the mess hall to report on whether they had found anything. 

Bubba said he had returned to the Cabin he shared with The Kid to look for any clues as to where he might have gone and, looking closer than he had before at The Kid’s bed, found two small bloodstains on his pillow. Not enough to mean anything serious. 

Just two drops, which he said he would not have mentioned except for The Kid being missing. 

Questioning the crew, nobody had seen anything.

Red, a large Irish deckhand, stumbled in, then, looking pale, when asked what was wrong, he swallowed and seemed for a moment unable to speak. Then gathering himself with some effort, he admitted he had seen two figures walking slowly along the deck the night before, writing it off since he only glimpsed them for a moment during the storm. He described how, for a moment, he had seen them like shadows, then the storm had seemed to almost bend around them, and they were gone. 

At this, a tragic picture entered my mind unbidden, and I remembered how the kid had been talking with DuCharme, and at once the possibility became clear to me. 

If the two young people had taken to each other and decided to meet in secret on the deck, any number of fates could have befallen them. I knew the kid had been reprimanded for not wearing his safety line before, and if he were with a woman? It all seemed a disturbingly real possibility to me. 

Going on, he stated that part of the reason he hadn’t told anyone was that when he glimpsed the other figure. Their eyes had been glowing a deep red, like distant taillights on the interstate. 

Leclerc grew angry, a rare sight, and berated him for not reporting this. We were all upset, we’d liked The Kid, a miracle in and of itself for a cadet aboard a laker. And to lose a passenger overboard might be enough to ruin the careers of all aboard. 

But we didn’t have time for recriminations, and Leclerc knew it, even as this meeting we going on, we could all feel the storm growing worse. 

Some of the men accused Red of having been drunk, which he denied, and for my part, I believe him. A Storm can do funny things to the eyes; the swirling patterns of rain or snow blowing about make unusual shapes sometimes. Such a momentary hallucination, while strange, was not out of the realm of believability. 

Based on when Red claimed to have seen the two figures, we knew that if true, they must’ve gone overboard hours before. Still, we had to try and help somehow.

Leclerc ruled to our dismay that we were unable to safely turn around with the waves knocking us about as much as they were. And no happier than the rest of us, he resigned himself to call a report into the Coastguard’s Group Soo back at the Locks, and pray. 

As the long day dragged on, the accident casting a cloud of gloom over the men, the storm grew worse and worse until twenty-foot waves were pounding the Winewater, tossing us around like a rubber duck in a child’s bath. 

A few years ago, when the Fitzgerald sank, the papers reported the storm had been of a sort only seen every thirty years; this may be true. But the storm that day must’ve been almost as bad, for the waves were rising like buildings, or the walls of a canyon, before pounding down on the deck. 

Tragic as the losses were, every man aboard knew that we had to work hard to save ourselves, or we could easily join them. 

When the big waves hit in the really bad storms, you’d think man had sinned so bad that The Almighty was going back on his word to Noah and trying to drown us anew. More water than you’ve ever seen will rise like a monster from the deep and pound down, covering the deck of your ship. 

Then just when you think it’s all over and she’s sure to sink. She’ll pull up again and shake off the water like an old dog. It’s a terrible and beautiful thing to see. 

This was such a storm, I saw men I knew to have no patience for religion pray as the ship shuddered beneath their feet. We rode the wild rollercoaster ride for what felt like days, though it cannot have been more than an hour, before something shifted and we felt things growing calmer, almost imperceptibly, around us. 

There were no cheers or shouts at this, only a calm thankfulness masked by bravado. That itself was short-lived. I made a pot of coffee for was the bridge crew once the worst of the storm seemed done and climbed to the pilot house to give it to them myself. 

As I made my way through the belly of the ship, an eerie silence seemed to have fallen on it, the sorrow of the men at our losses, almost a physical presence in the air. 

It was in that silence that, for a moment, I thought I heard the sound of light footsteps behind me, and could have sworn I smelled her terrible perfume.

But it was all in my head, as when I turned, I saw only a key in one of the cabin doors, with the other keys on its chain tapping against the metal bulkhead as the ship rocked back and forth, making the sound I had heard.

Odd that it was left there, but an ultimately meaningless detail, a simple item overlooked. As we, to our shame, had overlooked the missing people until it was too late. 

Telling myself to get a grip, I turned and continued on my way. 

I soon realized, even through the harsh movement of the ship, that we were listing slightly to port, and I prayed aloud that we were not taking on water. 

As I climbed to the pilot house, I heard a pained sound, like a wounded animal rendered metallic, and the ship seemed to shudder beneath me. Rushing to a porthole, I watched in horror as the wire safety railings along the deck drew taut, then snapped as the boat hogged beneath it. 

Whether in the storm we had struck something, or the waves had simply been too much, I do not know, but I realized at once that the ship’s back was breaking and soon she must come apart, and drown us all. 

Staring in horror, I could see the seams between the plates of the deck starting to strain, as a rivet sheared loose, and one of the hatches to the hold buckled, then fell in. This itself could kill us by allowing enough rainwater in to sink her under it’s weight. 

Bursting into the pilot house, Leclerc was already well aware of our peril and was shouting orders into a radio. We had but one option to try to save the ship, and it was a desperate gambit. 

We had to physically pull her back together; it had been done before, but it had been tried far more often than it had worked. Leclerc’s desperate orders were to run out the lines from our aft winch and anchor them to the back of the pilot house’s superstructure, then reel it in as tight as we could. 

If it worked, it might buy us a few more minutes; if it failed…

Not pausing to question, I ran out into the storm myself to assist. Five of us wrestled the massive woven steel line from the winch with strength born of desperation. Feet sliding on the frozen deck and wind pushing us like paper dolls. 

I still can’t say how we did it, but we did, and when the line was pulled in, we cheered so loud the sound could be heard over the wind itself. 

How bitter the despair of doing the impossible only to see it fail. 

Just as we had saved the ship, a horrified cry came from someone on deck, who I am not sure. And all on deck turned to look, transfixed at the wall of water moving towards us. 

Old as I was, and having seen much and more on these lakes, I was the first to shake off the frozen panic. Running for the pilot house, I had almost made it when the rogue wave struck, taking my feet out from underneath me with a hammering blow. 

A monster of a wave, the largest I have ever seen, caught her square on her flank, and the entire ship tilted so far I felt sure she must capsize as I clutched desperately to the railing of the pilot house stairs. 

The green water freezing and hard as stone slammed over me, and I knew in that moment I was dead. For a seeming eternity, I was within the wave as it washed over the deck and pressed like an elephant’s foot on my chest, leaving me twisted and battered against the stairs. 

Staring desperately around the deck, I saw someone's hand pale and white and glittering with frozen spray, grabbing tight to the damaged railing on the side of the ship.

For a mad moment, it looked as if they might pull themselves back, but mercy had long abandoned this ship, and I watched as the railing itself gave way, dropping into the lake below.

Taken, with the others, by the witch of the lakes, down to the halls of her ice water castle beneath the surface, and gone forever from the world of the living. 

Slowly, the ship, almost on its side, began to right itself with a groan that I felt more than heard.

Without thought, I found myself climbing, more crawling up the stairs, my leg shooting icy lines of fire through my body with every movement. It was broken, some part of me knew at once. Then something was grabbing me under my arms and lifting me up, as I blacked out. 

When I came to, moments later, I was in the pilot house with Leclerc kneeling over me, shouting something. I tried to breathe and found myself coughing lake water onto the deck. 

The whole world seemed to spin around me, and the air was as thick as oil as I forced myself to my knees and looked at what was left of the pilot house. There was blood everywhere, and Carlsen, a big Swede who seemed almost invincible, like some Viking god of old, was dead, his throat torn out by a shard of glass from the smashed windows.

The freezing rain blowing in through the windows made his blood run in awful swirling patterns on the floor, and unbidden, my mind was drawn back to my first meeting with DuCharme. 

A broken coffee mug lay on the floor, rolling back and forth, back and forth as the ship rocked. It left a red track behind it in the blood, like a tally mark counting the minutes. 

Trying to make my eyes focus on Leclerc, I saw that he, too, was wounded, a large cut along his shoulder was turning his shirt crimson, and his arm hung at an odd angle, dislocated. 

The first words I was able to force out from between my frozen lips were a question, almost a prayer or an invocation. “Did the line hold?” And it had! It had!

The ship, while wounded, perhaps mortally, was not dead yet, and hysterically, I laughed, taunting the storms and the lake, the witch of the wind and water that I had warred against every day of my working life had not taken me yet. 

After doing what little he could for my leg, Leclerc rose and walked to the wheel, grabbing the mouthpiece of the radio to call out our distress. 

No signal, the wave had smashed the radio equipment into useless scrap and thrown it away like a child in a tantrum, discarding a broken toy.

If it were possible for Leclerc’s face to grow more pale than it already was, it did then, but always quick on his feet, he dropped the radio handset and grabbed the ship’s phone to call down to engineering. 

Leclerc started to demand a report, clinging to professionalism, then, realizing how pointless that was, almost shouted into the phone, begging Bubba to answer just to say he was alive. 

After a long moment, he did, his drawling voice crackling out of the speakers. He reported one man down with a head injury, but that everyone else was still able to work. 

From fifteen, we were down to seven men. What curse was on our ship, I asked myself? What reason was there for so much horror to befall such good and honest men? 

A little of the tension leaving his body, Leclerc waved me over, and, gritting my teeth, I stood and limped to his side, grabbing the wall to keep upright. He told me to hold the ship steady while he spoke with Bubba, saying that if we just kept going in a straight line, we would reach safe harbor in under two hours.

Before everything had gone to hell, he and Carlsen had found an old ghost town, Whitby Junction, on the Canadian coast with an abandoned harbor that should have enough shelter to keep us safe. 

Leclerc spoke urgently with Bubba for a few minutes, then someone yelled something on the other end, and we both heard Bubba loudly ask them to repeat what they had said. 

The Captain tried to get him to say what was going on, but nobody responded for several minutes. Then Bubba’s voice came over the line again, more worried than before and also clearly confused. He shouted that one of the boxes had fallen and broken open when the wave hit the ship, and a body was hanging out of it in a pile of dry dirt. 

I had been right to think they were coffins, but there was no satisfaction in that.

Then there was another shout, and a voice full of disbelief, saying, “He’s alive, no, he can’t be!” We listened as he ordered someone to help whoever had been in the box, and his voice muffled by the phone, so I could not say which one of the men could be heard starting to ask a question. 

We heard the words “Is he wearing a-” before a loud scream filled the line, and we heard Bubba shouting, “Damn it, keep him back!” 

The line went dead. 

Stupidly, I wanted to ask what the person in the crates could have been wearing to even be noticeable in the situation, as if that mattered.

Leclerc and I stared at each other for a long time, the looks of horror and disbelief on our faces overpowering our pain and sorrow, and exhaustion. 

My mind raced, unsure, unable to comprehend what we had just heard. Leclerc took it harder if that was possible. I watched his whole body begin to shake, then his face a mask of pain and concentration, he forced himself to be calm. 

Finally, with shaking hands, Leclerc told me to stay at the helm, announcing that he had to go below and see what had happened. 

I tried to argue with him, to tell him that he needed to remain here at his post, but looking at his face, I could tell there would be no talking him out of this plan. 

Still, I couldn’t let him go alone. I pleaded for him to send me and stay behind himself; he had a wife and kids at home, but there was no way I could navigate the stairs and ladders on my leg, and we both knew it. 

Begging him to take the helm for one more moment, I limped across the pilot house to the emergency locker. If I could not go with him, then I would not let him go unarmed. 

When I held out the flare gun for him to take, he softly laughed. I think we both knew it would be of little use. Still, he nodded and thrust it into his belt before offering me his hand.

I took it, grasping firm, a lifeline. As he turned to leave, he paused for a moment, letting his eyes take in the pilot house for what we both knew was the last time, a king surveying his kingdom as the barbarians were at the gates. Then he spoke, very quietly but with enough force to be heard over the wind and rain, “Cookie,” he said, “The ship is yours.” Then he was gone, his silhouette fading into the haze beyond the doorway. 

I won’t be able to slow the Winewater with the engine crew gone, so my only chance is to beach her. If anyone is reading this, know we held our own and tell the families of the dead their loved ones died like sailors, every one of them a credit to his profession. 

The wind is dying now, and the rain has started to fade. Distantly, I can make out the form of the coast. Leclerc said the town was abandoned, but I can see a light. I won’t question it; all I can do is thank God it is there, and pray it is not another bad omen. 

Now I tie my hands and hold her true. Goodbye to you all.

>\[These chilling final lines were written in a much rougher hand, seemingly added later\] 

Rain is gone.

I just saw the glow of the captain’s flare coming from down on deck and heard the splash of someone going over. 

I hear them on deck, footsteps, dozens of them, and I can smell her perfume coming up the ladder from below. I should have let her sink. God save you all. I cannot stop her from reaching the shore. I am sorry, I am sorry!",2,1765276885.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

I’m looking into buying my first espresso machine, although I do like a good coffee I wouldn’t call myself an aficionado and have no experience with making espresso or these machines at all, so I need your help and experience!

Since my budget is quite limited (max. 200€ prefer lower), I plan on buying second hand and after some initial research have found good reviews as well as listings for these two machines. (mint Gaggia classic for \~200€ or mint Delonghi Arte for \~100€)

What are your experiences with these machines? Would you recommend them?

Are there any pros/ cons I should know about for these two machines?

The Gaggia seems to be build to a higher quality (less plastic parts - more metal), is it worth roughly double the price?

Is either of these a good choice or is there another machine you think I should consider?

Thanks in advance! <3





more information/ thinks to potentially consider:

My partner and I primarily drink cappuccino as well as latte and I would also like to use the steamer to prepare milk tea - so a good milk steamer is important. (In case that matters, we will be using vegan soy milk.)

I plan on using this machine for a long time and would like to be able to repair it if something breaks, therefore repairability and part availability would definitely be a plus. (parts seem to be available for both?)

I know the Gaggia classic could be upgraded/ modded in the future (Gaggiuino/ Gaggiamate), although I’m unsure if that’s something I need but I guess having the option is always nice.",1,1765276428.0,espresso,1,1.0,False
