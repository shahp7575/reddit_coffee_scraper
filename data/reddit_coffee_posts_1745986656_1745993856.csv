Later that week, we went to get coffee, and I thought we had a nice time. I will admit it was a little awkward, but we talked for like 2 hours straight and made each other laugh and shared similar opinions about certain things, and she had some very interesting things to say. The point is I liked talking to her, and I also think she is very cute. We didn't like hug, hold hands or anything and then I just kinda waved goodbye, but like in a way an idiot would (unintentionally). Over the weekend, I had to go out of town, but I tried texting her a bit, and I wouldn't say the responses were dry, but a conversation was just not going to happen from that.

I'm 20 years old, and I don't know how I am still struggling with this.

# Best Glass Drinking Straws 2025: Eco-Friendly & Stylish!

The glass drinking straw is rapidly becoming a staple in households and businesses alike, replacing disposable plastic straws with an elegant and eco-conscious alternative. As environmental awareness grows, so does the demand for sustainable products. Glass straws offer a durable, reusable, and visually appealing solution to reduce plastic waste, making them an increasingly popular choice for environmentally conscious consumers. This review explores the best glass drinking straws expected to dominate the market in 2025, focusing on their features, benefits, and overall value.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The glass drinking straws available in 2025 boast several key features that set them apart from traditional plastic straws and even some of their early glass counterparts.

**Durable Borosilicate Glass:** The use of borosilicate glass is crucial for the durability and safety of these straws.

Borosilicate glass is known for its resistance to thermal shock, meaning it can withstand sudden temperature changes without cracking or shattering. This makes it ideal for use with both hot and cold beverages. It's also less prone to breaking than standard glass, ensuring a longer lifespan and reducing the risk of injury.

**Variety of Sizes and Shapes:** Modern glass straws come in an impressive array of sizes and shapes to suit different drinks and preferences.

From short, straight straws perfect for cocktails and juice glasses to long, bent straws ideal for tumblers and larger cups, there's a glass straw for every occasion. Some straws also feature decorative elements, such as swirls or colored accents, adding a touch of personality to your drinkware. The inner diameter varies, accommodating everything from water to smoothies.

**Easy to Clean:** Hygiene is a top priority, and glass straws are designed with easy cleaning in mind.

Most glass straws are dishwasher safe, making them incredibly convenient to clean. They are also non-porous, which means they don't absorb flavors or odors from previous drinks. Many sets include cleaning brushes designed specifically for glass straws, allowing for thorough cleaning of the interior.

**Environmentally Friendly:** Glass straws are a sustainable alternative to single-use plastic straws.

By choosing glass straws, consumers significantly reduce their contribution to plastic waste. Unlike plastic straws, which can take hundreds of years to decompose, glass straws can be reused indefinitely. When they eventually reach the end of their lifespan, glass straws can be recycled, further minimizing their environmental impact.

**Heat and Cold Resistance:** The ability to handle both hot and cold liquids safely is a significant advantage.

This resistance allows users to enjoy hot coffee, iced tea, and everything in between without worry. High-quality glass straws are designed to withstand extreme temperature variations, preventing them from cracking or shattering when exposed to hot or cold beverages.

**Stylish Aesthetics:** Glass straws add a touch of elegance and sophistication to any beverage.

Their sleek, transparent design enhances the visual appeal of drinks, making them perfect for entertaining guests or simply enjoying a refreshing beverage at home. The clarity of the glass allows you to see the contents of your drink, adding to the overall drinking experience.

 ## Core Benefits

Using glass drinking straws offers several compelling benefits that make them a worthwhile investment for any consumer.

**Reduced Plastic Waste:** Choosing glass straws is a practical way to reduce your environmental footprint.

By replacing single-use plastic straws with reusable glass straws, you are directly contributing to a reduction in plastic waste that ends up in landfills and oceans. This small change can have a significant impact over time, especially if more people adopt this eco-friendly practice.

**Enhanced Drinking Experience:** Glass straws offer a superior drinking experience compared to plastic or metal straws.

They are smooth and comfortable to use, and they don't impart any unwanted flavors or odors to your drinks. The transparency of the glass allows you to appreciate the color and texture of your beverage, enhancing the overall sensory experience.

**Cost-Effective:** While the initial cost of glass straws may be higher than plastic straws, they are more cost-effective in the long run.

A single set of high-quality glass straws can last for years, eliminating the need to constantly purchase disposable straws. This not only saves you money but also reduces waste, making it a win-win situation.

**Healthier Option:** Glass straws are free from harmful chemicals that can leach into your drinks.

Unlike some plastic straws, glass straws are made from inert materials that won't react with your beverages. This ensures that you are not consuming any harmful chemicals or toxins when you use a glass straw.

**Versatile Use:** Glass straws can be used with a wide variety of beverages, hot or cold.

From smoothies and juices to coffee and cocktails, glass straws are suitable for almost any drink. Their durability and temperature resistance make them a versatile option for any occasion.

 ## FAQs Section

**Are glass straws safe to use?**

Yes, glass straws made from borosilicate glass are generally safe to use. Borosilicate glass is known for its durability and resistance to thermal shock, making it less likely to break or shatter during normal use. Always inspect your straw for chips or cracks before using it.

**How do I clean glass straws?**

Glass straws can be cleaned in the dishwasher or by hand. For hand washing, use warm, soapy water and a cleaning brush specifically designed for straws. Rinse thoroughly after washing.

**Can glass straws be recycled?**

Yes, glass straws can be recycled along with other glass products. However, it's essential to check with your local recycling facility to ensure that they accept glass straws, as some facilities have specific requirements.

Took 2 Years, but it finally clicked.","About two years ago, I decided to start having a coffee every morning. At that time, my primary goal was to soak in all the amazing benefits that black coffee offers, benefits that are backed by modern science. 

Over time, I slowly acquired a taste for it, although I could never detect any of the tasting notes mentioned on the coffee packs. So like everyone else here, went down the rabbit hole, buying one piece of equipment after another. I started with a French press (which I broke, good riddance), then moved on to an AeroPress, a V60, a South Indian filter coffee maker, and eventually a Moka pot. About a year ago, I also bought a Timemore C2 grinder which is the best upgrade ever.

Despite trying so many brewing methods and beans, I could never taste the specific flavors the packs promised. I could tell the difference between light, medium, and dark roasts, and I could recognize subtle variations between different roasters but never the actual tasting notes.

Until two weeks ago.

I picked up a medium-light roast from Boojee, and the pack said ""tasting notes: rose."" And guess what? I could actually taste the rose. I took a few more sips to make sure I wasn’t imagining it. But no—I really could taste it. THAT was a revelation.

I made it to the next level, guys. I finally made it to the coffee scene. 

So what changed?

I played around with the coffee-to-water ratio. My usual ratio is 1:15, but this time I tried 1:13. I was making an iced pour-over, but with a twist. Instead of brewing  over ice, I made a hot pour-over with the 1:13 ratio, popped it into the freezer for 15 minutes, then took it out and added 50–60 grams of ice.

And just like that—there it was. Rose. I dont even like the rose flavor in anything. No Rooh Afza, no rose flavored drinks or paan or anything. But able to get the tasting notes as in the coffee, yes please. love the rose. ",10,1745992975.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False

I am not allowed to express any emotions in my house, and I don't have friends unfortunately. So, as a coping mechanism, I am trying reddit to make me feel better so that I can go back to grinding. I will keep this short.

I woke up this morning and when I sat to revise and write notes for a book that I was reading on business, I saw that my sister (16 F) had printed over a full page of notes. It took me at least 4 hours to write that page and it contained the knowledge and my thoughts of different topics on that. This is also frustrating because I am trying to change my sleep schedule from sleeping at 3 am to sleeping at 10 pm and I am finding it very frustrating. I slept at 10 for 2 days, then suddenly, I couldn't sleep even at 2 am the next day. So, sleeping at 10 pm is very important. But at night, she came into my room, opened my computer to make copies and started making so much noise like banging the extra chair that I woke up. Which thankfully didn't affect my sleep that much and I had a good 10pm-6am sleep. But this reminded me how during my jee exam, my father came into my room early in the morning, opened my computer and started making noise that I woke up 2 hours before I was supposed to. And because I was nervous for the exam, I didn't sleep on the time I was supposed to, and I only had 5 hours or sleep instead of intended 8 hours. I did some damage control by drinking coffee and stuff. I wasn't sleepy in exam, but I can't say about how much it affected my mental ability.

Back to today, she also took all the a4 sized sheets that I use to write my notes of books so I can't write anymore as all of them are finished. I don't know how she used like 30 pages in 1 single night. Now, if that wasn't enough, I was already pretty frustrated last night.

So, I have started working in MC D as a way for me to step into the real world and to understand the business things like inventory management, efficiency, employee management etc. So yesterday was my second day. I went from sitting 12-16 hours a day on my chair for studying and looking at my pc to standing nonstop for 4 hours. I was exhausted. They give 1 free meal to workers for lunch but because first 2 shifts are half shifts, I had no lunch, but I instead got the meal for home. So, I was very very tired after standing and working for 4 hours and very hungry. But I had to give half of everything to my sister because what's mine is ours and what's hers is hers. If that wasn't enough, my grandmother whose, not exaggerating, whole personality is how awesome 'old times' were and how today people are even breathing, walking and talking wrong (yes she said that), and the same person who reacts like a phobic to anything that is home made but is bad for her health like Maida or fried stuff called me from her room and scolded me to sit with her while I ate because I don't give enough time to her then didn't even speak to me at all but ate like half of my already half of a very small burger and ate some of my fries as well. Like I hear so much bs related to how much unhealthy food today's people are eating but then she comes and when I am about to eat something tasty after working non-stop for 4 hours, takes my food and then say that I should buy 2 burgers instead of 1 next time and then not even mention all this to anyone. But I can't say anything about this to anyone because remember? I am not allowed to express any kind of emotions in this house.

My life doesn't suck this much usually, and I am very optimistic about the future. But all this coincidentally happened at the same time which is making it harder for me to ignore all this and focus on things that matter. Writing all of this already makes me feel better. Please don't give me advise like leave your house, its toxic because yes, it is and yes, I am leaving it when I will go to college (3 months later). But I would be very grateful if you guys show some kindness and say a few words.

I am very grateful to all those who gave time to read this whole post. Thank you.

PS: I said I will keep this short. But this is not short lol. Also, if someone is interested, the book is The Personal MBA.

This is going to be messy. This is not how I usually communicate when I’m trying to get a point across. I have ADHD, so I’ve worked hard to cope with that. But this… this is a raw cry. I didn’t even do myself justice. There’s so much more. But it’s a reflection of the chaos I feel.

Let’s start here: no, I don’t have any judgment prophecies for you. Sorry not sorry—if that’s what you expect from a prophet today, you might want to check your expectations.

The prophets of the Old Testament had a clear theme: some came with grace, some without, but always to reestablish the covenant of the Law—to call the people back to repentance, obedience, and sometimes to declare judgment over nations that had rejected God.

But now? We have a new hope. A new covenant entirely. I do believe prophets are still around, part of the five-fold ministry. And I believe God is herding His sheep like crazy right now.

And man… this message reflects the chaos in my brain. Like I said, ADHD. But the awareness, the weight of being caught up in what God is doing—it’s overwhelming sometimes. I pick up on things so quickly. I recognize spiritual blasphemy like a heartbeat—when something claims to be of Jesus but it’s not. Verses shoot into my head that I don’t even remember studying. They’re just there, embedded like swords wrapped in grace.

I’m experiencing so many inner miracles I can’t explain. One moment I’m trembling over what I’ve discovered in the Word, the next I’m on my knees in awe, begging Jesus to just step on me because His presence burns my flesh. I feel ruined—like Isaiah. Undone.

I’ve been in the Word like a scientist, desperate to get it right. The pages practically flip themselves. I connect dots I didn’t even know were there. And somehow, the exact teaching or word crosses my path that confirms what I’m seeing. I’m being called to pray—and now I actually obey. When I used to pray to want to pray. When I prayed to want to want Him. Before I even read the “why do I do what I hate” verse in Romans, I was crying out the same question. And now?

Guys. This is all I do. I didn’t choose this life in an intentional, pre-planned way. But here I am.

I’ve always wanted to be someone God used in big, meaningful ways. But I’ve lived far from that calling in a lot of my personal struggles. And I’ve always known that people truly used by God don’t fake it. It’s deep. It’s costly. It’s close. And man, the cost is costing right now.

My life is a mess. No job. No home (staying with a deacon). Rejection everywhere. And all I can focus on is the Lord. It’s like this sudden upheaval has made everything but Him feel irrelevant. But also providence has come from every corner. Money, food, my car somehow still being here cause I miraculously make payments… random healing? Random AILMENT? SURPRISE SIN? NEVER have I EVER struggled with prom but guess who keeps trying o make a surprise appearance in this season man 😭. 

Is anyone else going through this? Last year I was dead set praying for a husband. And I still desire one… I’ll be honest— it’s in a whole NEW way though!

I wake up, listen to the Bible, journal, nitpick Scripture like my life depends on it, eat, watch teaching videos to dig deeper, and everywhere I go—someone’s home, a coffee shop, church—intense conversations happen. I can’t even chill in social settings. I grieve the Garden of Eden like I lost it personally. I ache to touch Jesus’ face like I’ve touched it before. I’ve started fasting—real fasting, when I used to avoid it because of an ED. And somehow, even my family and friendships are shifting. my desires. My brain. My understanding of Jesus, the Trinity, the Word , Jesus again, adding to this thing, and wait— I wasn’t done exploring that, it’s so much. 

I’ve always felt like I was being chased by both God and the enemy. Even in my rebellion, it felt like Jesus started chasing me harder. He never once did that thing where He lets you run off for a while and figure it out. There’s always been an urgency in my life. And now? It’s all about God. My whole day revolves around Him.

But listen—don’t get me wrong. I still sin. And sometimes I miss the days when I could just see the sin I was choosing to engage in. Then I started seeing the sin I allowed. Then the sin that was wrapped in trauma and grace. Then the sin no one sees but it’s still there. And now I’m seeing sin that I can’t fix. That no therapist or self-help can fix. Just brokenness. And I thank God He doesn’t show me the full picture or I’d probably die of shame.

It’s all changing. Day by day. In ways I can’t explain. And not being able to explain it drives me insane. It’s like I want to vomit from how much I can feel but not articulate.

Again—I did not choose this. If this post is annoying to read, you’re probably just annoyed with Jesus and I kinda hope that embarrasses you. This started a few months ago, after a really painful work situation. I prayed a couple big prayers—and something shifted.

So please, pray for me. I’m praying for you guys. Maybe you’ll see a book from me someday. Maybe I’ll show up at your church—or you at mine. Maybe we’ll just worship together in heaven.

But I love you. My brothers and sisters in Christ.
Remember the Cross.
Remember Who called you. Who weeps over you. Who lives in you.
In light of the fulfilled covenant… cling to Him.

So I built [**ihaveanidea.app**](http://ihaveanidea.app) to fix that.

## Polar Camel vs. The competition: Yeti and RTIC

The Polar camel frequently enough finds itself compared to industry giants like yeti and RTIC. while all three brands offer insulated stainless steel water bottles, there are key differences that set them apart.

   **Price:** The most significant difference is price. Polar Camel water bottles are generally more affordable than Yeti and RTIC, making them a budget-friendly alternative. This doesn't necessarily mean a compromise in quality, but rather a different marketing strategy.

   **Performance:** In terms of insulation performance, the differences are often negligible for everyday use. All three brands excel at keeping drinks cold and hot for extended periods. However, in extreme conditions, Yeti and RTIC might offer slightly better performance due to their more robust construction and advanced insulation technologies.

   **Durability:** Yeti is often considered the gold standard in terms of durability, known for its virtually indestructible construction. RTIC also offers remarkable durability.While the Polar Camel is durable, it may not be quite as resistant to extreme abuse as its more expensive counterparts.

   **Brand Recognition:** Yeti has established itself as a premium brand with a strong following. RTIC has also gained significant brand recognition. Polar Camel, while growing in popularity, might not have the same level of brand prestige.

**In summary:** If you prioritize top-tier performance and brand recognition above all else, Yeti might be the best choice. If you're looking for a great balance of performance and price, RTIC is a solid option. And if you're seeking the best value for your money without sacrificing essential features, the Polar Camel is an excellent contender.

I like the fact that this sub advocates for a more personal and meaningful discourse regarding camping. In my new attempt at detail, I’m sharing my personal notes about the campout that I hope satisfies the mods.

Palomar overnighter
April 28-29 2025
Miles hiked: 18.76
Elevation gain: 2,952 
Numbers accumulated from two major hikes observatory and Love Valley

Departed home around 7:45 and decided on taking Nate Harrison Grade road. Beautiful change in biomes as you ascend as always. Great flower showings of grape soda lupines and wooly Indian paintbrush. The mountain had a fair amount of low clouds, but cleared up by mid afternoon.
Decided it best to set up camp prior to the big hike. So happy to be camping in Palomar instead of a day trip.
Set off to find the “trail” visible as a red dotted line on the CalTopo app. After some bushwhacking the trail was found. It was a challenging .08 mile trail that wasn’t traveled well. Deep oak leaves made travel a chore. Followed the large wood piles and knowing the general direction of Fry Creek helped here.
Connected to Fry Creek to Observatory Trail, traveling through Cleveland National Forest. Took picture of campsite wife and I stayed at one buggy summer with our dog Cooper and long before kids.
Smell of pine hit me after leaving Observatory campground. A nice breeze stirred up the wonderful mountain pines. Tons of birdsong from acorn woodpeckers, various jays, ravens and so many others.
Walked up to the Hale telescope viewing area because you have to.
Enjoyed lunch and a cup of coffee courtesy of my new and first JetBoil; what a great product. Did some stretching and headed back to camp. 
The trail seemed new and refreshing with the change in light. I was happy that it was mostly downhill.
Got back to camp extremely grateful to the CalTopo app for saving my bacon in finding the trail. Hike from Palomar Mountain State Park to Observatory and back: 10.85 miles 2,184 of elevation gain
Organized gear and campsite upon return. Glad that I had prepared the firewood in the pit and pitched the tent prior to the hike.
Cracked a delicious helles beer from Eppig Brewing in SD and walked around Doane Pond during sunset.
Turkeys came through camp
Explored campground fully
Had a great fire and enjoyed the PEAK brand backpack meals immensely. Chicken coconut curry, peach cobbler, and biscuits and gravy were enjoyed.
Turned in at 10pm after a bit of stargazing.

4/29

Chilly 39 degree morning leaving camp at 7am to head to Love Valley trailhead on Palomar east grade road.
Hiked 4.7 miles through grasslands and large oaks similar to Santa Ysabel West. Lake Henshaw was covered in low clouds at the start of the hike only to clear on the return. It had a mild showing of flowers and was mostly double track, but it did have its beauty.

Gear:
05 Lexus LX470 “landcruiserish” as some say.
REI passage 1 person
REI +20 zephyr bag
Klymit air mattress 
JetBoil Flash
Mystery Ranch Scree 32 backpack 
Altra Olympus 6 shoes
Mountainsmith Andesite poles (top of my cork handle fell off, gotta research replacement part/process)

Final thoughts:
Must have a back up battery pack for these longer hikes. DO NOT run the hike on the watch. 
First time with the Black Diamond STORM-R headlamp. Didn’t think I needed a manual, but PLEASE tell me there’s a way to stop the blue lights from flashing in my face every time I turn the thing off!!! I usually run red in camp so as not to blind your fellow camper, these blue ones destroy my night vision.
Altra Trail gaiters worked fantastic, zero rocks! This was my first hike with them and I feel like a boneheaded for not using them earlier.
Altra Olympus shoes performed excellent. Feet felt good considering the mileage.
Free Fly apparel “elevate” hooded shirt was a bit warm, but excellent comfy fit for such a long sweaty hike. I’m 250lbs 6’3 and it can still cover my stomach when I reach up. It is more of a loose/relaxed fit shirt.",25,1745990992.0,camping,0,0.97,False

Most days making two cups of coffee, with some days up to 5 cups.

I have loved making coffee with this machine up until recent where I am now experiencing the following issues with steaming my milk:

\- Steam pressure is extremely inconsistent. Some days it whips up a beautiful milk texture, and some days the steam wand just spits out water and just makes the milk bubble up terribly. Please note, I previously worked as a barista for 7 years, so I am confident with my coffee making skills

\- If the steam pressure turns out well for the first cup of coffee, it encounters the above problem for the second cup

\- I have noticed that when there is excessive steam coming out from my drip tray when steamining the milk, I will experience the problem above

I have attempted to have this fixed by a technician 3 times but each time have been advised there isn't anything wrong with the machine.

I'm now at a point where I'm ready to replace the machine due to inconsistent coffee results.

I'm tossing from Breville between repurchasing the Barista Pro (as I have really enjoyed using it and find it very easy to use), Bambino Plus + a grinder, Dual Boiler. I am also open to any other options that is under $1200AUD for machine and grinder.

I have enjoyed everything about the Pro until the steam pressure started to play up.

We have a great emotional connection — lots of laughs, deep talks, and a natural chemistry.

She’s in a relationship, but she barely talks about her boyfriend. She mentioned once that “things are complicated this year.”

We’ve spent time alone together many times after work, but recently, for the first time, we spent a weekend afternoon together — just the two of us. We grabbed coffee, took a long walk, and relaxed at a park.

During that afternoon, there were small but noticeable signs of physical closeness — we were walking very close together, and I even touched her forehead playfully. It felt very natural and more intimate than usual.

Right now, we’re both traveling separately (I’m abroad, she’s traveling too), but we stayed in touch during our vacations.

One thing that stuck with me: she spent her birthday alone while traveling. When I asked if her boyfriend was with her, she just said, “It’s complicated this year,” and quickly moved on.

We’re both coming back this weekend.
I want to suggest meeting up again, but I’m not sure how to approach it !

don’t want to stay stuck in the “safe friend” role, but I also don’t want to make her feel uncomfortable or pressured because of her situation.

One thing I can’t shake off: she spent her birthday alone during her trip. When I asked if her boyfriend was with her, she just said, “It’s complicated this year,” and changed the topic.

It was in another city and the first interviews were remote.

I don't have much work history and I have an odd history (took a few gap years after uni and went back to college) so I'm older than most entry level job seekers. And my resume is empty, I've only put my most recent education there.

My first interview there was with an engineer. He asked me how old I was and I had to explain my history. Surprisingly the rest of the interview went well and he scheduled me for a second interview.

Second interview was with him, another engineer and a HR-Management type person.

The 2 engineers asked me some tech questions and my future career aspirations. My aspirations are a 100% match with the role in question. They both seem satisfied.

Then the HR person starts talking and asks me how old I am. I again explained my history and then HR asked me why I didn't work after uni and who was paying for my rent and groceries. I said I was living with my family and they asked me what my family did for a living.

HR ended the interview later with ""thank you for your time. We will let you know the results in a week"".

I thought I blew my chances. So a week later I asked for an update, and they told me to send them references. I then asked my teachers and ex classmates for reference letters and they all wrote well written letters.

I send the company the letters. They then tell me they will look into it next month.

A month later, one of my references tells me that they contacted him. So he sets aside time from his schedule (in the middle of his workday) to do a phone call with them.

A week later, I ask the company for an update and they say ""We'll get back to you in a month"".

Next month, they call me and tell me they are in my city and want to meet. So we set up a meeting at a coffee shop.

In the coffee shop, I meet HR person. They do some casual chit chat and tell me about the job - the annual income, probation period, etc. and tell me they will send me an offer letter next month. During that same meeting, they again ask me ""what does your mother do?"", ""what does your father do?"", etc. trying to find out about me as much as possible.

I wait for a month, but I never get an offer letter. I thought there were delays so I decide to wait more time.

After another month, I get worried. So I reached out to them for an update and they tell me ""you never followed up after our meeting so I thought you were not interested"".

I then confirm I am interested and HR later pulls me into a video call.

During the call HR says ""why didn't you follow up? Because of that, I had to hire someone else""

In that exact same call, they say ""you know when I visited insert city name, I left a laptop for you in my friend's house. So when you start your job, that laptop will be delivered to you!""

They then say ""my project has been delayed so I cannot hire you now. Give me one or two months and I will let you know then"".

A month later, they send me a mail saying that their project has been rejected so they cannot hire me.

Many months later on LinkedIn, I found out that they in fact had hired someone else at exactly the same time they told me the project got cancelled.

So I'm guessing their ""project delayed"" story was just a lie to buy more time and find another candidate and use me as a backup.

## Key Features Analysis

The quality and performance of an HP laptop battery replacement are heavily influenced by its technical specifications. Careful consideration of these features is essential for ensuring a reliable and lasting power source for your laptop.**Battery Type:**

Most HP laptops utilize lithium-ion (Li-ion) or lithium-polymer (Li-Po) batteries. Li-ion batteries are known for their high energy density and relatively long lifespan, typically lasting for several hundred charge cycles. Li-Po batteries, on the other hand, offer greater flexibility in terms of shape and size, offering further improved energy density allowing for thinner and lighter designs. Both types are generally safe when manufactured according to industry standards, but it is crucial to choose batteries from reputable brands with established safety protocols.

**Voltage and Capacity:**

The voltage of the replacement battery must match the voltage of the original battery.Usually, this is either 10.8V or 11.1V for older models, and 14.4V or 15.4V for newer models. The capacity of the battery, measured in milliampere-hours (mAh) or watt-hours (Wh), determines how long the laptop can run on a single charge. A higher capacity translates to longer battery life, but it may also result in a slightly larger and heavier battery. It's critical to select a battery with a capacity that meets or exceeds the original battery's specifications for optimal performance.

**Cell Quality:**

The quality of the individual battery cells within the pack significantly impacts the overall performance and lifespan of the replacement battery. High-quality cells from reputable manufacturers, such as Samsung, LG, or Panasonic, tend to offer greater stability, longer cycle life, and better resistance to heat and overcharging. Using low-quality cells can result in reduced battery life,increased risk of failure,and potential safety hazards. Reviewing customer feedback and product specifications which may indicate cell origin is significant.

**Safety Certifications:**

look for batteries that have undergone rigorous testing and have been certified by self-reliant third-party organizations, such as Underwriters Laboratories (UL) or CE marking. These certifications demonstrate that the battery meets established safety standards for electrical safety, fire resistance, and other potential hazards.Avoid batteries that lack proper safety certifications, as they may pose a risk of overheating, exploding, or causing damage to your laptop.

**Smart IC Chip:**

Many modern HP laptop batteries include a smart integrated circuit (IC) chip that manages battery charging, discharging, and thermal control. This chip is crucial for preventing overcharging, over-discharging, and overheating. The smart IC chip also communicates with the laptop's power management system to provide accurate battery level readings and optimize power consumption. When choosing a replacement battery,ensure that it includes a compatible smart IC chip to guarantee optimal performance and safety.

## Core Benefits

Replacing your HP laptop battery rather than purchasing a new laptop presents several compelling benefits that make it a worthwhile investment.

**Extended Laptop Lifespan:** Replacing the failing battery restores the laptop's full operational capabilities, enabling you to continue using a perfectly functional computer for significantly longer.

**Cost savings Compared to new Laptop:** The cost of a replacement laptop battery is significantly less than the cost of purchasing a new laptop.High-quality replacement batteries frequently enough cost between $30-$100, while a new laptop can easily cost several hundred to over a thousand dollars. Replacing the battery is also often cheaper than having a failing battery professionally serviced.

**Environmentally Responsible Choice:** Extending the life of your HP laptop by replacing the battery reduces e-waste,contributing to a more lasting environment.Manufacturing new electronics requires significant resources and energy, and disposing of old ones often involves hazardous materials. By replacing a single component, you reduce the demand for new devices and minimize the environmental impact associated with electronic waste.

1kb8mlr,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1kb8mlr/mf_smoke_signals/,[MF] SMOKE SIGNALS," 

Chris Whitman lit his eighth cigarette before noon, the flame dancing in the trembling cup of his hand. Smoke slithered through the cracks in the kitchen window as the bitter aroma of scorched tobacco mingled with burnt coffee grounds. His fingers, yellowed and trembling, moved with muscle memory—tap, flick, drag, exhale.

Three packs a day had turned into four. Then five. On bad nights—six. Sleep became an old friend that forgot to call. Caffeine and nicotine were his new gods, demanding sacrifices in ash and hours of rest. His apartment, once modest and clean, now looked like the aftermath of a fire no one bothered to report. Ashtrays overflowed like miniature volcanoes, and the walls had turned the color of dying teeth.

Chris hadn’t slept in nearly four days.

It started small. A missed nap here, a late night there. But now the nights had turned hallucinatory, the dark filled with whispers and twitching shadows. The ceiling fan had started speaking in riddles. The coffee machine laughed every time he pressed brew. His reflection in the microwave smirked when he wasn’t looking.

“Still awake?” it would ask in a gravel voice. “Still smokin’, cowboy?”

Chris chuckled through a hacking cough and lit another.

But by day five, reality buckled. The rooms stretched longer than they were. His hands shook so violently he could hardly hold his lighter. Time stuttered, skipped, reversed. He’d walk into the kitchen to pour a cup of coffee only to find it already poured, steaming as if he’d just set it down.

And still, he smoked.

He tried to sleep. He lay on the couch, eyes squeezed shut, willing his brain to shut off. But as soon as he closed his eyes, he saw them—cigarettes walking on matchstick legs, chanting, “One more, Chris. Just one more.”

He jolted up, sweat slicked and heart racing, and lit another.

On the sixth day, Chris collapsed.

He woke on the bathroom floor, cigarette still burning between his fingers, leaving a charred kiss on the tile. His chest felt like it was being crushed from the inside. Every breath rattled like a maraca in a coffin. He clutched his ribs. Something inside him had ruptured. Still, he dragged himself to the living room for one last smoke.

Then the world fractured.

Everything went black.


A beeping pierced the silence.

Chris opened his eyes. Or tried to. One was swollen. The other fluttered open like a moth's wing. Everything was white. Blurred lights overhead. A sterile ceiling. The unmistakable scent of antiseptic.

Then the pain hit.

It screamed in his chest, sharp and deep, like something had been hollowed out and filled with knives. A tube jutted from his mouth, humming. Machines beeped around him in rhythms he couldn’t follow.

A voice nearby said, “He’s conscious.”

Another: “Collapsed both lungs. Severe nicotine toxicity. We almost lost him.”

He wanted to speak, to ask where he was, what had happened, but the machine spoke for him. The reality of it sank in like cold water. It wasn’t a hallucination. He wasn’t in his apartment, or his nightmare, or inside a cigarette-induced fever dream. He was in a hospital bed, tethered to machines that breathed for him.

A nurse leaned over him. Her face was tired, but kind. “You’re lucky to be alive, Chris. Your lungs gave out. Chain smoking that much… it’s a miracle you even made it here.”

Tears welled in his eyes. His body was broken. His mind, fractured. The cigarettes had consumed everything—his time, his sanity, his body.

And now, finally, they were gone.

For the first time in years, there was no smoke.

Just air.

And the distant sound of his own heartbeat—steady, slow, and beautifully alive.

I’ve been attending nondenominational churches for 4 years now. In hindsight, these churches are a perfect “starter kit” for Christians, and I’m just now realizing it. At first, it started out as a great journey as I was really transforming my life and felt goodness when attending service. But I just can’t stand the cliques, the rock music, the QR codes to sign up for groups and to volunteer to serve coffee. I feel so judged by a bunch of people in groups that I’m in, since I’m not part of their “inner circle.” This sounds pretty judgmental on my end, but I feel like the people im surrounded with are just involved with church to have status, a friend group, and to feel superior in a way. I’m not trying to vent, but I’m on my last straw. I’ve been so drawn to Orthodoxy in recent months, but I’m almost too nervous to even attend Divine Liturgy since I essentially have no idea what’s going on due to my Protestant background.

Daylight bleeds through the windows.
Jack walks into the quiet marble halls, his bag over his shoulder, bruised but breathing.

He finds Safe Deposit Box #602.
Opens it.
Inside:

A passport

A burner phone

And the cash.
Stacks. Clean. Untouched. The weight of everything he fought for.


Jack smiles — not wide, not smug — but relieved.

He takes the money.
Leaves the passport.
No more aliases.

> He’s earned a name now. His own.

Scene 2: One Month Later – Baja Coastline, Mexico

Aerial drone shot.

Waves crash.
A black-on-gold Porsche 911 is parked beside a modern beach villa.

Inside, Jack pours coffee.
Sunlight.
Peace.
He looks out at the waves — no sirens. No screeching tires.

Just air.

Scene 3: That Night

Jack is tuning the Porsche when headlights appear.

Not one.
Not two.
Five cars.
All iconic. All familiar.

The player from Underground 2 (wearing a Bayview jacket)

The Most Wanted BMW driver (scar on his cheek, calm energy)

The female street queen from Carbon (Neon City survivor)

The slick agent-turned-street-racer from Undercover


And they all smirk.

The BMW driver tosses Jack a beer.

Scene 5: The Cliffhanger

As they race back to Jack’s villa,
a black Dodge Charger SRT watches from a hill above.

Advice?,"Hey everyone, I (20M) have been spending more time with a girl I met through my college job - let’s call her K (21F). She’s cool, kind, funny, and I think I might like her. I just don’t know if the feeling’s mutual or if I’m stuck in the “good friend” zone.

Some quick background:

* She’s recently gotten out of a bad relationship and a short rebound one. She’s told me she has trust issues now, but wants to be in a relationship eventually.
* She’s invited me to hang out with her and her friends a few times. We even went clubbing and she was super affectionate — dancing with me, holding hands, touching my face, laying her head on my lap, and playing with my hair. She even said, ""I look like such a pookie"" and that kind of made my night lol.
* Recently, we grabbed coffee and a dessert together. It was more lowkey but personal — we talked about relationships and trust and laughed a lot.
* She also invited me to her friend’s birthday next week.
* I mentioned checking out a cat café (we both like cats) and she seemed interested.
* When we parted ways, I said “we should do this more often” and she said “yes.”

I talked to my guy friends — some think I should “make a move fast” before I lose the chance. They have told me I’m moving too slow and risk getting stuck in the friend zone. One even suggested a whole plan to escalate things physically over dinner and drinks next weekend, but that doesn’t really align with how I want to approach this.

I want something that grows naturally and respectfully. At the same time, I know that staying too neutral forever might confuse things.

My questions:

* Does this sound like romantic interest or just friendly closeness?
* Is it okay to ask her out to dinner one-on-one soon?
* How do I make things clearer without being too forward?
* How do I move forward without overwhelming her or sabotaging what we’ve built?

I’m still figuring this stuff out, so any advice would help.",2,1745988927.0,youngadults,1,1.0,False

We worked in a restaurant, and truthfully it wasn’t love at first site. If anything I felt lonely one day and happened to notice at a glance that she was actually, really very pretty. Like finding a half dollar when you’re going through a penny jar. Like, how did you get here? 

She was so different to me, too. She was from New Jersey, but you couldn’t hear it unless she was drunk. And beautiful. I mean of course she was, right? Wouldn’t make sense to lose every inch of your mind over somebody you wouldn’t look twice at. She was brunette with light brown eyes, standing at five-foot nothing with a button nose and almost vampiric canines. But she was kind. Like downright, sincerely kind to anyone she met. And I think that’s what broke me the most. 

We were working in a fucking restaurant of all places. If you want to find some of most careless, reckless, messiest people, just work in a restaurant and listen more than you talk. But here she was, of all the places. Kind, well read, funny, beautiful, and all with this air about her like she had no idea how absolutely perfect she was. So of course I flirted with her every minute that we were at work. I texted her often, and went out of my way to make her laugh, or put a coffee at the hostess stand with her name on it whenever she wasn’t looking. Not sure why I thought it was a good idea, but I actually sent her flowers at work without putting my name on them. Just a lyric from a song we both loved. As much as someone could argue it wasn’t, I still find that gesture to be absolutely pathetic. It made her smile though, and that’s all I really cared about. 

Despite her living with her boyfriend of five years, we kissed at a party. I apologized the next day. I said I was drunk. She said she wasn’t, and in that moment I was fucking finished. There could not have been an engine or animal strong enough in this world to pull me back towards sensibility. I was obsessed. I checked the schedule every week at work to see when we would work together, and for some reason washed my hair twice on the days we did. I researched everything about her that I could glean from her Facebook page. As crazy as it sounds I even read up on her hometown, because I needed to know every single thing about her. I was in a band at the time, and would invite her to every show. She actually came once and I was like a child when I saw her from the stage. I’m embarrassed to admit it, but I was.  

I wish I could say we got together in the end. But after sneaking dates on our lunch breaks, stealing kisses at work outings, and making out in dark corners til our lips fell off, we just faded out really. Well, she faded out. I fucking exploded. 

I knew that this was a fling to her. Excitement and heart pounding moments to keep her alive while her boyfriend shat the bed on what was the opportunity of his life time. He was just a shit boyfriend, really. And she got to feel as wanted and valued as she deserved to feel. But I was truly and thoroughly tortured in the end. I needed it to be more. I needed it so bad I could physically feel it weigh me down like a Mack truck that had gone in to the river. I was a house on fire, and as bright as the flames got I was still burning down. I drank every night, wishing I had her to climb in to bed with. I did all the drugs, knowing I needed to feel like I felt when I was with her, all the time. Life was fucking awful when she wasn’t around, just because she wasn’t around. It was like having God let you sit on a cloud in heaven for a few hours a day, only to find that when you’re back on earth you really can’t help but notice the mind-numbing mediocrity of it all, sans her. 

I almost crashed my car twice, after falling asleep behind the wheel, drunk and high. It was actually the same tree both times, which is too fucking weird for my taste. I got a DUI and didn’t even try to argue with the arresting officers. I was just broken in every part of me, because I knew I wasn’t the man she would choose for life; just for those moments where she let me sit on a cloud. And so one day she just didn’t respond. And the next day she didn’t respond either. And I resumed my downward trajectory. 


A few months later I was getting out of rehab, when I got a call from a friend, Jonah. I had recorded music with him in the past. Original songs, which of course were almost all about her. He wanted to record again and get a band together. I said yes, and went to work writing new material which, you guessed it, was about her. In my writing process, I naturally looked her up. She was engaged. I guess someone else finally saw what I saw. It was bound to happen. So I wrote what I felt and the music was good. We played around and actually got a following. The next year we tagged along on a tour with another friend’s band who had found some regional success, and our fan base got bigger. Every night I would find myself in a new city singing about her, and she didn’t have a clue. She was off pursuing her dream to work in film production, engaged, and not thinking about me at all. She was working on movie sets all over the country, and I was touring with my band. She was filming people’s stories, and I was  writing songs, just doing my best not to actually use her name. It was tough, but I did it. 

After our second tour, we got signed to an indie music label. We inked a contract for a studio album, and three music videos, with a tour to come afterwards. We recorded the album, which I titled “Cato”, her middle name. I mean what the fuck kind of a middle name was that? Goddamnit she was so fucking unique, and I couldn’t not acknowledge it somehow. 

Anyway. We talked to the production company who would film our first music video, and got it scheduled for a three day shoot. I had never done anything like it and didn’t really care about music videos, but the rest of the band was stoked, so fuck it, right? We showed up to the our first meeting with the director, and his assistant director shortly after finishing the album to discuss logistics and get to know each other. I walked in their office with the band, some fluorescent lit space with cheap furniture that looked like a it had been put there by a staging furniture. The receptionist took us to the conference room and there she was, sitting next to the director. Turns out she was the AD, Assistant Director, for the project. I fucking lost all use of my mouth and vocal cords while she stared at me like someone had just walked a dead man in to the room, all “Weekend at Bernie’s”. We had an insanely awkward meeting, agreed on a direction, and I went back to the band’s van ready to puke in my hat. We had to start shooting the next day because these things do cost money, and somehow I was supposed to act like everything was fine. I got through the three days of shooting with my psyche in tact, but it was like a dream that lasted 72 hours, and I just wanted to wake the fuck up.

She finally confronted me at the end of the third day and asked if the song was about her. I told her they all were. She turned more red than I’d ever seen her, while she looked at her shoes like somebody had written the Rosetta Stone on them. We didn’t say anything else. She just walked away and I stood there in complete dissociation for at least a solid ten minutes. 

The next music video was going to be a compilation of footage from us playing shows in three cities and all the moments in between. It was just a crew of four people getting footage while following us around in our daily routine, so they could send it back to the production company who would cut it up in to an actual video which our song would play over. I was relieved she wouldn’t be there, as it wasn’t the kind of thing that requires the assistant director to be present during shooting. 

The crew met us at the first venue to film our candid moments while getting ready for the show, and then the show itself. When they walked in to our green room, she was the last one through the door, holding a camera and tripod. I wanted to hide in the couch cushion, but the laws of physics wouldn’t let me. I walked out after a few moments to collect myself outside. While doing some breathing and trying to stave off a heart attack, she walked out and we looked at each other in still silence. She told me she had to come, not for her job, but because she couldn’t stop thinking about me. I was stunned and poorly, mouth open and confused as shit. She walked up to me so fast she was almost running, and kissed me for the first time since I had gone to rehab. We spent the next six days together. We slept together. We didn’t leave each other’s side except for when she needed to call her fiancé. I couldn’t give a shit about him, as long as she came back to me. 

After we wrapped the last day of shooting, I asked her to come with me for the next few tour dates and she agreed. She’d take a few days off and tell her fiancé she needed to keep getting footage. 

We couldn’t stop. We barely slept. The lines of things were dancing in my vision from lack of sleep, but I’d didn’t want to sleep because I couldn’t be sure she would meet me in my dream that night. 

Then, one morning she was gone. She left a note saying she was sorry, but that it was a pipe dream. She had worked hard to build the life she had and it just didn’t include me. 

I never recovered from that. The next album was called “Cato Leaving” and I quit the band after we finished recording it. I’d tell you where life took me after that, but truthfully it doesn’t matter. Between moments at work or with my family, I’m just staring at pictures of her, stalking her social media, and doing my best not to forget. I have to keep her in my mind and memory, it’s the only place I can hold her anymore. ",1,1745988660.0,ObsessiveLoveStories,0,1.0,False

1kb8aul,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Various_Curve_6404/comments/1kb8aul/the_silence_on_redfield_road/,The Silence on Redfield Road,"# The Silence on Redfield Road""

On a quiet street in the town of Hollow Creek, something changed forever on the night of August 17, 2019.

Redfield Road had always been the kind of place where people left their doors unlocked, where neighbors nodded politely and kept to themselves. So when 42-year-old Melanie Grant was found dead in her living room—coffee cup still warm, front door slightly ajar—it didn’t just shock the community. It fractured it.

Melanie was a local schoolteacher, known for her quiet nature and deep love for literature. She lived alone, had no criminal record, and no known enemies. The idea that she was murdered in her own home felt impossible. Yet there she was—slumped over on the sofa, a single stab wound below the rib cage. No signs of forced entry. No valuables taken. Nothing disturbed—except her silence.

The investigation began the following morning, after her colleague and close friend, Rachel Dunn, called the police when Melanie didn’t show up for a Saturday workshop. Detectives quickly ruled out robbery. There were no fingerprints on the weapon—a kitchen knife, wiped clean and placed back in the drawer. It was almost surgical, precise.

Suspicion first fell on her ex-boyfriend, Thomas Reid, a local handyman with a rough past. They had split a year earlier after a short, rocky relationship. He admitted to stopping by her house a few days before her death, claiming he wanted to ""check in."" But his alibi—security footage showing him at a bar during the time of death—checked out.

Then came the detail that changed the case.

One of Melanie’s neighbors mentioned seeing a car parked near her house late that night. A blue Honda Civic—windows down, engine running, driver inside. Police traced the vehicle to a 19-year-old named Evan Merrill, a former student of Melanie’s.

Evan was quiet in school, often kept to himself. Melanie had once mentored him through a difficult semester and even helped him apply for community college. They had stayed in contact loosely, mostly through email. But something had shifted. Investigators later found a journal in Evan’s room filled with entries about Melanie—some respectful, others obsessive, almost delusional.

Under questioning, Evan broke.

He claimed he had gone to visit Melanie to “talk about something personal,” but said they argued, and he “just snapped.” There were no signs of a struggle, but he confessed to stabbing her once in the side, panicking afterward, and trying to make it look clean. He left her there, alone, and drove off into the night.

Evan Merrill was arrested and charged with second-degree murder. He was sentenced to 23 years in prison the following year.

To this day, some in Hollow Creek still leave flowers at Melanie’s gate. Her death was more than a tragedy—it was a reminder that even in the quietest towns, the people we least suspect sometimes carry the darkest truths.",1,1745988506.0,u_Various_Curve_6404,0,1.0,False

I’m not pursuing it at the moment. Very honestly I rarely think about life with a spouse, so I wouldn’t say I’m over here “burning with passion.”

I knew something was wrong from the moment I woke up - she wasn’t there on my pillow next to me. I was in a rush and started my day like I usually do by making a coffee and working at my desk. Once again I noticed that she wasn’t sitting on my lap. She usually jumps up giving me a head nuzzle on my desk to make herself known before settling down.

Concerned I went upstairs to find her asleep in our bed but something looked off and I immediately knew. Total lethargy and didn’t eat anything even her favorite treats. I took her outside under my arm and it really hit me that this was the beginning of the end.

I had her since the start of my early adulthood in 2007 and she was there for all of mine and our family’s journey - getting married , welcoming our three boys, and tolerating our moving around till we settled. Every evening she would lay on my chest as if to tell me it’s time for bed. We had an unbreakable routine and I’m struggling. It’s been rough this evening crying all night between my wife and I. The only thing she did tonight was purr after getting to lick the juice from the kozy shack flan. I dread tomorrow losing the sweetest most affectionate kitty I ever had.

Our dog was my mom’s best friend. She was her soul dog, guarantee. No other animal will touch her heart the same way. 

Mom and I have different ways of grieving. I did a lot of pre grieving, and six months later I’m ready for another pet. My mother is still getting hit in waves. Right now, she’s going through it again because my parents just bought a house with a yard. We’ve been living in apartments/condos for a few years now, and she feels guilty that her dog was deprived of a yard. She really wanted to buy a house bed for we said goodbye, but that didn’t happen. Tonight, she told me she keeps imagining her sitting on the back deck with a cup of coffee and her dog, but said “but she’s just ashes” and that killed me. 

She’s still questioning whether or not she did the right thing by putting her down, even though she had a necrotic ruptured tumor and she’s was clearly uncomfortable despite her smiles. 

 I understand that grief is an individual journey. But is there a way I can help my mom work through this guilt she keeps putting on herself. It was not her fault she had the tumor. It wasn’t her fault that it ruptured… I believe it was absolutely the right choice to say goodbye. But this new thing she’s feeling is she should have bought a house for the dog sooner.

On my birthday, he found out last minute, called me, and asked to join me for coffee. We ended up talking till 4 AM. That kind of set the tone—deep, meaningful conversations, lots of laughs, and eventually some intimacy.

Since then, we’ve met a few more times, and every time we’re together, it feels natural and emotionally connected. But between those moments, he’s distant. He rarely texts first, keeps things surface-level, and I feel like I’m always the one reaching out.

I addressed it on a call—told him it’s confusing to feel so connected in person but completely disengaged otherwise. He said he’s a “difficult person,” takes things slow, and has pushed people away before. I told him I need clarity—because I don’t want to be stuck in a confusing, half-hearted dynamic. He said he understood and didn’t want to leave me uncertain.

But not much has changed. Plans get pushed, effort feels lopsided, and honestly, I’m tired of doing all the emotional work so early on.

Has anyone else experienced this kind of imbalance? How do you tell if it’s just their communication style or a sign they’re not emotionally available? At what point do you stop trying and step back?

TL;DR: Things started great with a guy—deep convos, strong in-person connection—but now he’s distant over text and inconsistent. I’m doing all the emotional lifting and unsure if he’s just slow-moving or emotionally unavailable. Not sure if I should keep trying or step back.

I’m in my late 30s and from the age of 18 I feel like I’ve been stuck at level 5 and unable to move forward for many reasons, yet can’t narrow down the exact reasons. I’m too burned out to write paragraphs so I wrote out my issues in bulleted lists.

* Unable to read books and enjoy it
   * Fiction and non-fiction
   * No dedicated reading space or refusing to make one
   * The back and forth with a Kindle and iPad to read
   * No time
* Unable to study new skills
   * Feeling list what to do for my stuck IT career
   * A lot of uncertainty within me
   * Irrational fear what I learn will cause a detrimental butterfly effect against me
   * Recently looked into Bookkeeping side hustle, those studies stopped a few months ago for a big IT data project with work.
* Can’t break away from YouTube
   * Used constantly during work (I WFH, using it as background noise, but also on all the time outside work)
   * Constant current events and random interests playing (too many to list)
   * Escape from adulting, looking for exit
* Unable to enjoy other streaming services (Netflix, Paramount+, etc.)
   * All Youtube, all the time
   * Some Twitch just for MST3K
* Unable to search and land new job
   * Degree stigma? (ITT graduate :( not my choice )
   * IT too competative
   * Uncertainty if I’m unhireable despite a decade of experience
   * Very cautious of paid career counseling
* Unable to workout consistantly
   * Burned out mentally from day job
   * Did complete 200h YTT years ago but regressed hard to usual habits. Haven't reviewed my notes and yoga books ever since
* Fearful of mother
   * Doing anything to level up feels like a betrayal or possible disownment from her
   * What she trusts must work for me (her belief) never letting me make my own choices
   * Lost my father a decade ago
* Fearful of others
   * I level up and it could turn into a death threa to them (crippling irrational fear)
   * No life, quiet, judged to be and act something different.
* Unable to mentally recover/switch mind out of day job.
   * No matter how good I am and get great compliments, I’m still fearful of getting fired or be a victim of a life-threatening situation  (another crippling irrational fear)
   * I have a critical position in the company. Mentally burned out by the second day of the work week.
   * Spend more time de-steaming my mind at coffee shop watching YouTube, eating out, up until bed. Meditation or journaling hasn’t worked, even being inconsistant from it.
   * One really bad days after work I take a 1:1 5mg CBD/THC gummy and clunk out for the rest of the day. Happens two to three times a month.
* Unable to think positive thoughts
   * Super overactive imagination, a TV set consistantly flipping channels and no off button, irratioanl fears hijacked it
   * Tried four therapists for the past decade, none worked

I adore your city. There is an entire network outside my door. A gym, grocery store, bars, restaurants, music, 30 bookstores, coffee shops all within walking distance of my home. Portland is fucking cool. 

But I need you now. Where can I find a proper 10pc? I don’t need all flats but I’d love that. I don’t need lemon pepper, but I’d take it. I do need a proper 10pc bone-in, mild, wet with blue cheese. I need it. Need. 

If I can’t find it, I’m getting on a plane on Friday and going to either Atlanta or Buffalo. I don’t want it to come to that so, if you can help me - please educate me. Guide me. Instruct me. Lead me. Shepard me unto the ways of Portland’s poultry arts 

I need some crispy ass wings STAT. I watched my lovely friend eat some buffalo cauliflower nonsense earlier today with ranch and I desperately need to cleanse my soul with GREASE.

Help me. 

**EDIT**

I’m going to Jerry’s Tavern. Then to Tinker Tavern. Thank you for showing me the way and leading me to my new Guru(s), PDXWingGuys on IG ",47,1745986829.0,askportland,75,0.84,False

I've tried a couple CBD oils and found humancology blue seems to be the only oil I've tried that actually does anything noticeable.I find it helps with the grogginess side effects after using only THC.Kinda like a strong coffee.I gave up on CBD because of the cost versus the effects of CBD oil.And the blue can make anxiety symptoms feel worse.I was thinking of trying CBD for day use again especially while on a tolerance break, using THC 24/7 most likely causing me tolerance issues.If you use CBD or use for tolerance break what CBD oil or product do you recommend?",0,1745986730.0,MedicalCannabisOz,3,0.5,False
1kb7tpj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogfree/comments/1kb7tpj/he_doesnt_drink_tap_water/,He doesn't drink tap water,"Last year a girl I was interested in brought her dog over to my house. She asked me to get him some water so I got a bowl and filled it from the kitchen sink. 

She said he doesn't drink city tap water.

I drink the water. My neighbors drink the water. I make tea and coffee with the unfiltered water. I don't have a filter. 

Her dog also runs away every chance it gets. I've been witness to it run away 4 times. It completely  ruins the whole evening bc she has to rush out and try to find it. She has an ""all hands need to help"" type attitude about it too, and gets offended when you don't want to help. It got run over by a car and she spent $7k to get the leg fixed. It's too much. 

I've met some awesome dogs in my life. Chances are I'm gonna hate yours. ",21,1745986728.0,Dogfree,4,0.96,False

For owners of these businesses, or food industry in general, when it comes to the packaging for what you sell i I’m curious about the following: 

do you use multiple vendors depending on 
pricing? Or Do you find value in having a good relationship with 1 vendor? 

How much time do you typically spend managing your inventory and re-ordering?

Do you care more about cost or quality or a mix of both?

Any other thoughts and feedback I’m curious to hear!",1,1745986677.0,smallbusiness,2,1.0,False
