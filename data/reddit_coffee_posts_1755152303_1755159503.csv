They say coffee is just an excuse for two people to sit down and get to know each other... and I‚Äôm here for exactly that... I‚Äôm looking to meet someone in Mumbai who‚Äôs up for a relaxed coffee date... nothing overcomplicated... no awkward formalities... just two people and a good brew...

I‚Äôm a mix of sweet and strong... kind of like the perfect latte... I love caf√© hopping... from the little hidden corners with fairy lights to the buzzing spots where the barista knows your name... Bonus points if you can suggest a place I haven‚Äôt been to yet... and there aren‚Äôt many...

If you‚Äôre the kind who can keep a conversation flowing... from ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your go-to coffee order?‚Äù to ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your wildest travel story?‚Äù... we‚Äôll get along just fine... I love people who can make me laugh... aren‚Äôt afraid to be themselves... and can handle a little playful banter... Life‚Äôs too short for boring small talk... right?...

What‚Äôs in it for you?... Well... good company... a partner in crime for trying new caf√©s... and someone who might just remember exactly how you take your coffee after the first meet...

So... if you‚Äôre a decent human... have a sense of humor... and believe coffee tastes better shared... slide into my DMs... Let‚Äôs pick a day... find a cozy spot... and see if we click... Worst case?... We both walk away having discovered a new caf√©... Best case?... We find ourselves planning the next coffee before we‚Äôve even finished the first one...

Im just not sure if these are reasonable deductions or not as I feel like the amount is ridiculous compared to the problem. Also i didnt transfer the bond through RBO it was just a bank transfer. 
at first she sent me these

Rangehood greasy: $250 
Coffee table damage (charged at 50% of value): $114.50 - this one was damaged from hot cups probably so seems fair. 
Ensuite damaged Mixer tap repair: $120
Carpet was not cleaned properly: $220

And then after sending her few emails. 

1) carpet cleaning fees will be $110
2) You arrange cleaner re-attend the property to undo the rangehood 
And the coffe table and ensuite remains the same 

The carpet is just in the entrance cause its beige and there is carpet in the entrance so I feel like it should be normal fair wear and tear ? And there was also some black marks before I came which is why she said again 110 instead of 220. The pictures is the before and after

And the ensuite tap was the shower handle it fell off and I sent her an email 2 weeks before end of lease for repair which i received no respond to. 

What do you think about it specially the carpet?

1mpu8dj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mpu8dj,I put mustard on vintage sewing scissors??,"I thrifted a vintage pair of sewing scissors and cleaned it with a sponge in hot dish soap water. After getting all the rust off, I was reminded of the practice of artificially creating a patina (that aged steel look) on knives. It's actually both decorative and protective against rust (these are not stainless steel). After looking up options, mustard appealed to me the most as there's no heat involved, or strong chemical (like white vinegar) or smell (vinegar, coffee, etc), and really cheap and simple. The ability to create a less uniform patina (like a hot vinegar dip would create) appealed to me, and in the pictures you can see the final results.

The process was simple. Clean with dish soap, scrub with a sponge and steel wool to get rid of rust and years of dirt. Then, dry properly and apply a thin coat of mustard. After repeating it twice, I did a final soap cleaning, dried, and coated them in sewing machine oil. Now to get it sharpened.

I have little frame of reference though. Sounds nice, but uh.. here, let me just tell you.  


I tell her I'm going to make oatmeal, she immediately pulls up her little step stool to the countertop. She points me to the oatmeal box, then insists on pouring it in herself. I let her (scoop out the excess), then she insists on pouring the milk, so she gets to do that too.  
While that's heating on the stove, I start on preparing the moka pot for coffee. She wants to wash it (I do that quickly myself), but she then wants to blend the coffee (tries but asks me to do it when it's hard) and she wants to scoop the coffee into the pot. I let her. She spills some coffee grounds and immediately asks for the sponge to clean it up. She cleans it as well as she can (not very well) and I do the aftermath.  
While we wait for the coffee and oatmeal she grinds some pepper to put in the food, but at my suggestion wants to (and gets to) put cinnamon in it instead. She insists on stirring too.  
At the table she asks for a yogurt, she gets it, and wants to feed me a few spoonfuls. Sure. Then she spills, and immediately grabs the rag to clean up the mess before I can.  
I go to the bathroom, she follows and gets me some toilet paper, tells me she'll wipe my butt. ... Thanks darling, but I'm gonna draw the line about there.  
When I try to get her dressed, she insists on doing it herself. Okay. Takes a million years but it's getting better.  
When *I* try to get dressed afterwards, she insists on putting my underpants on me. ... I maybe should have said no but... eh? So my two-year-old tells me to put one leg in and then another, and now I'm dressed by my toddler.   


So this is what my morning was like. It's great and lovely and tiring and a serious test of my patience but I'm trying to give it as much room as I can because this also feels really valuable and precious.

1mpu2iw,https://i.redd.it/l03d8s09sxif1.png,How does this lighting plan look - open plan kitchen living dining.,"Please be kind - I'm a complete amateur! I've also made up this drawing so no idea if it would make sense at all to an electrician :-)

This is for an extension to an older property. Pretty standard 'box on the back' - but facing north (Aus) so heaps of natural light through the day. 3m high ceilings and large north facing windows. 

I'm trying to modify the lighting plan that our builder has proposed as included which has a grid of about 8 pancake downlights across the ceiling. 

I know this is going to be a massive variation and cost, but light is really important to me and I'm very sensitive to light and the mood it creates. I also hate glare. 

One limitation is that we don't have furnishing yet - except a dining table. And with the cost of this plan we might be sitting on milk crates for quite a while! 

In this plan I've planned: 

* kitchen lighting: 
   * linear LED pendant over island (high CRI 3000K/60W/3030lumens) [Alby 2.2m LED Colour-Shifting Pendant in Walnut with Bronze Details | Beacon Lighting](https://www.beaconlighting.com.au/alby-led-2200mm-pendant-in-walnut-with-bronze-details)
   * dimmable LED strips under wall cabinets (Hafele - installed by joiner, good specs)
   * three additional downlights ([Podean GU10 Dish Tilt Frame Only Recessed Cut Out 94mm Downlight in White | Beacon Lighting](https://www.beaconlighting.com.au/podean-gu10-dish-tilt-downlight-frame-only-in-white?srsltid=AfmBOopELavw3h2mXUXjMu3mLwchBxSVDc9FxUpYWSkTn2yKIyx7e0Iw)) \*not sure of best positioning, to provide more ambient light. 
   * One directional spot to open decorative shelving/coffee station. 
* living and dining area: 
   * two uplighters to wash ceiling with indirect light : [Mona II LED Colour-Shifting Wedge Wall Bracket in White | Beacon Lighting](https://www.beaconlighting.com.au/catalog/product/view/id/23957/s/mona-ii-led-wedge-wall-bracket-in-white/). spaced along back wall. 
   * One pendant for over dining table (probs a lantern-style/ opal glass or linen for diffuse light).
   * two recessed downlights ([Podean GU10 Dish Tilt Frame Only Recessed Cut Out 94mm Downlight in White | Beacon Lighting](https://www.beaconlighting.com.au/podean-gu10-dish-tilt-downlight-frame-only-in-white?srsltid=AfmBOopELavw3h2mXUXjMu3mLwchBxSVDc9FxUpYWSkTn2yKIyx7e0Iw)) over sofa area. **I don't know where to position these to be useful but not create harsh shadow. Should I be going for wider beam and spread, or more directional?** 
   * two additional recessed downlights over the dining table for when it is being used for board games/homework/craft etc. 
   * One small up/down lighter mounted on the wall to bring light into the far corner. 
   * two lamps to be used near dining table and then by sofa for soft light and reading.

Questions: 

**Is this crazy bonkers overkill?** 

**Does this look very very expensive in labour and material (not including fixture costs)?**

**Is there zoning,switching and cuircuit things I should consider?** 

**Can you see any areas that are going to be really dull - and does that matter?**

**Is this too much lighting?**

**Is this not enough lighting?**

**What else should I consider?** 

**Do i get dimmers on all or just some zones?**

1mpu0dv,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1mpu0dv/3_days_smokefree_cold_turkey_some_insights/,3 days smoke-free. Cold turkey: Some insights,"I (27F) have been chain-smoking for 13 years. This is my second serious attempt at quitting. This time, I‚Äôd rather not even call it an ‚Äúattempt‚Äù.
I want it to be a fact. I want to say: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a smoker.‚Äù 
But now on day 3/4, there‚Äôs a nagging little voice whispering: 
‚ÄúAre you sure about that? Are you seriously never going to have another cigarette?‚Äù

I‚Äôm really trying to stay strong and remind myself that this is the addiction talking. That voice isn‚Äôt me, its not what I want. It‚Äôs the voice of a junkie, of an addict desperate for their next hit.

The first 2 days went okay because I decided to quit cold turkey. That made me mentally brace myself, anticipating that the first few days would feel like drug withdrawal, even exaggerating the ‚Äòpain‚Äô to come. Let‚Äôs embrace the struggle and feel like Rocky or Goggins. Strong and resilient. I felt powerful. Pain is inevitable, suffering is optional. By bracing myself like I would be cut by a thousands knives, quitting smoking was just not as bad. 
I also take comfort in the fact that nicotine leaves your body after 3 days. Maybe it‚Äôs a placebo effect, but let‚Äôs also assume that it gets easier then. Let‚Äôs just pretend! 

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs been helping me so far:
	‚Ä¢	Whenever I feel a craving, I try to smile and feel happy. Why should a craving be a bad thing? It means I can grab another cinnamon gum which I quite like and take a small break. 
	‚Ä¢	I keep telling myself that everything is exactly the same. I just have an extra free hand now. Gaslighting myself works better than sinking into sadness and frustration.
	‚Ä¢	I let myself keep my old smoking rituals, just without the cigarette. In the morning, I sit outside with my coffee and breathe slowly and deeply. It feels almost as satisfying as a cigarette. I try to be happy with ‚Äúless‚Äù because it‚Äôs still ‚Äòsomething.‚Äô
	‚Ä¢	I check in with myself about why I want a cigarette: Stress? Breathe deeply and find the tension in my body. Jaw? Relax it. Hands? Squeeze and release them. Need a break? Sit down for 5 minutes with a tea. After a meal? Go for a 10-minute walk. Reward for boring chores? Go get a nice drink or snack.

For me, it helps not to feel like my whole life is upside down. Overall it‚Äôs going well, but yesterday (day 3) and today (day 4) I can really feel that addiction voice gnawing at me. In those moments, it‚Äôs hard to remember why you quit in the first place. If it‚Äôs this hard, why bother, right? But I won‚Äôt give in.

I‚Äôm not thinking about ‚Äúa life without smoking‚Äù because that would make me crack from despair. I‚Äôm only thinking about today. 
Right now, I‚Äôm not smoking. 
Right now, I‚Äôm not a smoker. 

Sometimes in life, you don‚Äôt get what you want. You don‚Äôt get the job, your partner leaves you, someone you love dies. 
You can‚Äôt just decide to undo it. You can‚Äôt wake up on day 5 and say, ‚ÄúOkay, I miss my ex too much, let‚Äôs undo their choice and get back together.‚Äù 
You can‚Äôt go to a 24/7 store and ask: ‚ÄòMy dead grandma and a lighter please.‚Äô 

Sometimes you can‚Äôt get back what you lost. I‚Äôm trying to see smoking in the same way: it‚Äôs not a choice anymore. It‚Äôs reality. 
My job now is to accept it and work through it with a lot of self-love. 
When we lose something or go through pain, we have to be kind to ourselves, to support ourselves. Sometimes we fail at that, and what happens? We fall into the darkest hole.

Not today. Today, we‚Äôre going to support ourselves. We‚Äôre going to carry ourselves. We‚Äôre going to be our own hero.

Sorry if this all sounds a bit messy. I just wanted to share how it feels for me and what‚Äôs helping so far. Mental strength seems to work best for now. I know it‚Äôs hard, but let‚Äôs tell ourselves it‚Äôs actually not that bad. We can do this. 
In the end, everything stays the same‚Ä¶ you just have one extra free hand. How nice!

1mptwjt,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1mptwjt/right_before_our_mating_ceremony_his_regret_my/,"Right Before Our Mating Ceremony | His Regret, My Throne","Right before our Mating Ceremony, my mate, Alpha Damien, told me he had to temporarily mark an Omega from our pack, Seraphina.

He claimed she had the Moon Sickness and would die if he didn't mark her.

I fought him on it, but the next day, he moved Seraphina right into the penthouse of the Pack House.

The suite meant for the future Luna.

My suite.

To calm me, he even got on his knees, his eyes red as he promised, ""Once she's safe, I'll remove the mark. You'll still be my only Luna.""

But then, Seraphina found me, a medical report in her hand.

Six weeks pregnant.

They'd already held their marking ceremony long before Damien ever came to me.

My heart shattered into ash.

My pen dug into the calendar, carving a vicious X over the date that was supposed to be our Mating Ceremony.

Then, I opened my laptop and replied to the email from the European Laurel Healers' Guild.

""I accept your invitation. I leave on the day of the Mating Ceremony.""

Chapter 1

Right before our Mating Ceremony, my mate, Damien, said he needed to mark another she-wolf, Omega Seraphina‚Äîthe one who‚Äôd supposedly saved his life.

""I have to give Seraphina a temporary mark. She's dying, Isla. The Moon Sickness is eating her alive.""

Damien‚Äôs gaze was heavy on me.

I stopped mixing the moon petal elixir in my hands.

It was for our Mating Ceremony, said to make the mate bond even stronger.

And now, he wanted me to accept him marking another woman.

My fingertips started to tremble.

""Are you fucking kidding me?""

""It's the only way to save her."" Damien turned away, unable to meet my eyes.

Those deep blue eyes I once loved were now a storm of conflict and chilling resolve.

""I owe her my life.""

""I don't care what you owe her!"" My voice went sharp. ""A mark is sacred, Damien! It's supposed to be for us‚Äî""

""One month,"" he cut me off, his eyes bloodshot, a flicker of confusion in them as if he genuinely couldn't understand my resistance.

""I promise, I'll remove the mark right after the ceremony. She'll live, and you'll still be my only Luna.""

I stared at him, my jaw tight. ""I don't agree. Unless you want to cut our mate bond.""

Damien's eyes finally turned to ice. ""This isn't a request, Isla. A life is at stake. Don't make me force this.""

He promised, ""It‚Äôs just a temporary mark. It won‚Äôt affect our bond. In a month, everything will be back to normal.""

Then he stormed out, slamming the door.

His Alpha scent, thick with anger, clung to the air long after he was gone.

The next day, I was standing at the entrance to the Pack Headquarters when a long, black sedan pulled up.

My whole body went numb.

Damien got out of the passenger seat and gently helped a delicate, fragile figure out of the car.

Seraphina.

She looked so pale, like a strong gust of wind could knock her over.

Damien's arm was wrapped around her waist, a protective gesture that sent a wave of nausea through me.

""Watch the steps,"" he said, his voice so gentle it made me want to scream.

It was a tone he had never once used with me.

I watched them walk into the building and get on the elevator.

Headed straight for the top floor.

For the luxury suite reserved only for the future Luna.

My suite.

Three hours later, Damien came back to our apartment.

I was waiting for him on the sofa, a cup of cold tea clutched in my hand.

""Is she settled in?"" My voice was so calm it scared me.

Damien took off his jacket. ""The pack healer said she needs a quiet environment.""

""So you put her on the top floor.""

""It has the best facilities,"" he said, avoiding my eyes. ""It's just temporary.""

I stood up and slowly walked toward him.

""Damien, where were you last night?""

He froze for a second. ""Dealing with a border dispute. I told you.""

""All night?""

""It was more complicated than I expected.""

I stepped closer, close enough to smell the scent of another she-wolf on him.

The commingled scent was a poisoned needle, stabbing straight through our mate bond.

A sharp, tearing pain ripped through my soul, and I almost buckled.

It wasn't just Seraphina‚Äôs scent. It was deeper, more intimate.

The kind of deeply blended scent that only comes from a true Mating mark.

He had lied.

He wasn't dealing with a border dispute last night.

He was performing their marking ceremony.

And now, he was still trying to get my permission for something that was already done.

""Do you even still need my permission?"" I took a step back, fighting the tears welling in my eyes.

""You have to understand, Isla. A life is at stake."" Damien moved toward me, trying to take my hand.

""You're my fated mate,"" he insisted, as if that explained everything. ""You should be on my side.""

I yanked my hand away. ""I need more time.""

""There is no time. She won't last much longer.""

Just then, the elevator to the penthouse opened.

Seraphina stepped out, draped in a white silk robe I'd never seen before.

Her cheeks were flushed with a sickly pink, but her eyes were bright.

She walked straight to Damien and leaned against his chest.

""Thank you, Damien,"" she said, her voice weak but sweet, her eyes fixed directly on me.

""I feel so much better already.""

Chapter2

I didn't sleep all night.

After Seraphina retreated to the penthouse, Damien followed her up.

""She needs someone to look after her,"" was the only explanation he gave.

I sat in our empty apartment, the memory of that mark‚Äîits scent‚Äîreplaying over and over in my mind.

The tear in our bond throbbed, a constant, agonizing reminder.

Then it hit me.

Three weeks ago.

That night.

Damien had said he was going to handle a border dispute and didn't come back until the next morning.

That night, I lay in bed, fighting back waves of searing pain that tore through our bond.

I thought something was wrong with me, or that Damien had been hurt in the conflict.

I only breathed a sigh of relief when he finally returned.

His clothes had the faint scent of laurel leaves on them.

The sacred incense burned only during a Mating Rite.

I'd even asked him, ""Did you go to the Sacred Grove?""

He'd said, ""Just passing by.""

It never even crossed my mind that he would betray me. Betray our fate.

Now I understood.

He had already marked Seraphina that night.

And I, like a fool, had been sitting here worrying about his safety.

At dawn, my phone buzzed.

An encrypted email.

From: The Laurel Healers' Guild.

""Dear Miss Isla, we formally invite you to participate in our research initiative on Ancient Life Energies. This is the highest honor for a healer and the perfect place for your talents. Should you be interested, we hope for a response within the week.""

I stared at the screen.

This was the opportunity I had dreamed of my entire life.

It was also my only way out.

Damien walked in just as I was packing my things.

""What are you doing?""

""Packing my herbs,"" I said without looking up. ""Since the penthouse has a new occupant, I don't want to be in the way.""

""Isla, listen to me‚Äî""

""There's nothing to say."" I stood up and looked him dead in the eye. ""The Mating Ceremony,"" I stated, my voice dangerously calm, ""is off.""

The color drained from Damien's face.

""You can't do that.""

""I can,"" I said, turning back to my packing. ""I refuse to mate with an Alpha who has already marked someone else.""

""I told you, it's temporary!"" he yelled, grabbing my arm. ""I'll remove the mark in a month!""

""And then what?"" I shook him off. ""You think I'll ever trust you again?""

Pain flashed in Damien's eyes. ""She's dying, Isla. I can't just stand by and watch her die.""

""Why?"" I demanded. ""Because you owe her? Owe her for what?""

Damien fell silent, his lips pressed into a thin line.

""If you won't tell me, then we have nothing to talk about."" I walked toward the door.

""Wait!"" Damien scrambled after me, his powerful frame dropping to one knee before me. ""I promise you, in one month, I will give you the grandest ceremony this continent has ever seen. Every pack in North America will be there to witness it.""

I looked down at him, kneeling.

It wasn't pity I felt, but a bitter sense of absurdity and injustice.

Were our five years together, our fated bond, really going to end over a lie?

Was I really going to give up this easily?

In that moment of hesitation, the elevator doors opened.

Seraphina stepped out.

Seeing Damien on his knees, a fleeting, triumphant smirk touched her lips.

She walked right up to me and deliberately handed me a file folder.

""Isla,"" she said, her voice soft. ""I know you're a healer, too. This is my medical report. Could you take a look? Damien's Alpha energy is so powerful. I've been recovering so well since the marking, but... there's been an unexpected side effect. I'm a little scared.""

I took the report, my eyes scanning the data.

As a top-tier healer, I spotted the discrepancy immediately.

Six weeks pregnant.

But Damien had only completed the marking less than three weeks ago.

The dates didn't add up.

I looked up, my gaze cold, and handed the report to Damien.

""Congratulations,"" I said, my voice dripping with ice. ""It seems this 'side effect' began long before the 'temporary mark'.""

Then, without a second glance at his shocked and questioning face, I walked back into my room.

I looked at the calendar, at the bright red circle around our Mating Ceremony date.

It was now my departure date.

The countdown: thirteen days.

I opened my laptop and clicked reply.

""I accept your invitation. ""

Chapter3

That night, Damien didn't come back to our apartment.

I knew where he was.

The next morning, I opened the pack's secure network.

The top post was a new update.

Alpha Damien had ordered a hundred thousand dollars' worth of rare supplements for Seraphina.

Blood Ginseng, Moonlight Fungus, and Starfruit‚Äîthings only needed during a werewolf pregnancy.

The comments section exploded.

""Is our Alpha going to be a father?""

""But isn't Isla his Luna?""

""I heard that Seraphina girl moved into the penthouse.""

""Isn't the Mating Ceremony next week?""

I shut my phone off.

At noon, I met my best friend, Chloe.

""You what?"" Chloe's voice was so sharp it nearly shattered her coffee cup. ""You're calling off the ceremony?""

""That's right.""

""Are you insane? He's your fated mate!""

""Fated mates don't mark other women right before their ceremony,"" I said, calmly sipping my coffee. ""And they certainly don't get another she-wolf pregnant with their pup.""

Chloe gasped. ""A pup?""

I showed her the photo of the lab report on my phone.

""That scheming bitch!"" Chloe slammed her hand on the table. ""She played you!""

""Probably,"" I shrugged. ""But it doesn't matter anymore.""

""Isla, you can't just give up. Damien loves you.""

""Loves me?"" I gave a bitter laugh. ""Does someone who loves you mark another woman behind your back?""

Chloe fell silent.

""I've already accepted the invitation from the European Healers' Guild,"" I said, standing up. ""I'm leaving tomorrow.""

""So soon?""

""If I stay any longer, I'm afraid I'll do something I regret.""

At eleven that night, I got back to the apartment building after an herb exchange.

The gathering was a success.

I‚Äôd met several healers from Europe, including a few Alphas I‚Äôd never seen before.

When the elevator doors opened, Damien was standing there.

His eyes were cold, his nostrils flaring slightly. ""Where were you?""

""An herb exchange.""

""With who?"" he pressed.

""Some colleagues.""

Damien stalked towards me, like a predator closing in on its prey. ""Don't lie to me. I smell another male's scent on you. An Alpha's.""

""So what if you do?""

A dangerous light flashed in his eyes. ""Get away from me, and wash that scent off you.""

""You don't get to order me around.""

""I'm your fated mate!""

""No, you're not,"" I said, pushing past him. ""You're Seraphina's.""

I walked towards our apartment, Damien following close behind.

But instead of arguing, he went straight to the armchair by the fireplace, sat down, and closed his eyes.

I knew what he was doing.

The mind-link.

His expression softened, and I could feel the murmur of his thoughts through our strained bond.

The pup is going to be so strong, so healthy.

The pup.

He was already looking forward to it.

I turned to go to my room.

""Isla.""

His voice stopped me.

""There's something about the ceremony I need to talk to you about.""

Chapter4

I stopped and turned, my face a cold mask. ""What is it now?""

""It's about the Rite of the Moon Spring."" He opened his eyes, and those deep blue pools held an undeniable command. ""I need to postpone it.""

""Why."" It wasn't a question.

""Seraphina's pregnancy is unstable. The healer said the pure energy of the Moon Spring would be good for her. So...""

He paused, as if searching for the right words. ""I've decided it's better if she has it.""

Let her have it.

He said it so casually, as if he were just rescheduling a meeting.

That was the highest honor for a Luna, to receive the pack's blessing.

It was the sacred moment we had dreamed of together.

My heart was numb.

I couldn't even feel the pain anymore.

I answered in the calmest voice I could manage. ""Fine.""

My calmness seemed to unnerve him. ""You... don't have anything else to say?""

""No.""

""...Good."" A flicker of relief crossed his face, as if he'd expected a bigger fight.

He then continued, his tone all business. ""I'm taking Seraphina to a private retreat in the Rockies. Handle the ceremony preparations. Don't bother me with the details unless the world is ending.""

He cut the link.

I walked out to the balcony.

It used to be my herb garden, filled with rare plants I'd cultivated for the future of our pack.

I had imagined using these herbs to heal our people, to protect our home.

Damien had never set foot out here.

He said he wasn't interested in ""all these flowers and weeds.""

Now, they had lost their meaning, too.

I started working, one by one, uprooting the plants I had so carefully nurtured, the sharp snap of roots and the damp scent of earth filling the air.

It was a funeral for a future that was now dead and buried.

Each one represented a betrayed hope.

When the last Stardust Bloom was in its box, I took out my phone and opened the calendar.

On the date I had marked countless times for the ""Rite of the Moon Spring,"" I drew a heavy, red X.

The countdown: twelve days.

Chapter5

Over the next week, my phone was flooded with notifications.

Seraphina's social media was on fire.

A picture of her lying in a bed at a luxury resort in the Rockies, Damien sitting beside her, peeling an apple.

Her in a hot spring, with Damien on the edge, holding a towel ready for her.

Her during a prenatal check-up, Damien holding her hand tightly.

Every photo had the same caption: ""Thank you, Damien, for taking such good care of me. I've never felt so safe.""

I didn't need to read the comments.

""The Alpha is so good to her.""

""Now that's what true love looks like.""

""What about Luna Isla? We never see her.""

""I heard she's busy with her career.""

I turned off my phone and went back to packing.

On the third day, I drove to my parents' house.

""Isla?"" My mother opened the door, surprised. ""What are you doing here?""

""I need to talk to you both.""

In the living room, my father put down his newspaper and looked at me.

""What is it?""

""I'm going to Europe.""

""For a vacation?""

""For work. The Laurel Healers' Guild invited me to join a research project."" I took a deep breath. ""I might be gone for a long time.""

My mother's face fell. ""What about your ceremony?""

""It's been postponed.""

""Postponed?"" My father frowned. ""Why?""

""Damien has some things to take care of,"" I said, trying to sound calm. ""We thought it would be better to hold it later.""

My parents exchanged a look.

""Isla, don't lie to us,"" my mother said, her voice gentle but firm as she took my hand. ""We're your parents. We can see the pain in your eyes. Tell us what he did.""

I closed my eyes. ""It's nothing, Mom. I just want to learn more while I'm young.""

""Does Damien agree with this?""

""He's very supportive of my career.""

Another lie.

My father was silent for a long time before finally nodding. ""If it's for your career, we support you.""

""But you have to stay in touch,"" my mother said, her eyes glistening with tears. ""And take care of yourself.""

After leaving my parents' house, I texted Chloe.

""Can you come help me pack?""

An hour later, Chloe was at my apartment door.

""My god, what happened here?"" she asked, staring at the empty living room.

""I'm moving.""

""Moving where?""

""Switzerland.""

Chloe sat on the couch and studied my face. ""Okay. Now tell me the truth. What the hell happened?""

I told her everything.

From Damien demanding to mark Seraphina, to the pregnancy report, to the canceled Rite of the Moon Spring.

When I finished, the living room was dead silent.

Chloe's face grew darker and darker.

""That bastard!"" she suddenly exploded. ""How could he do this to you?""

""He had his reasons.""

""What reasons? Life debt?"" Chloe stood up and started pacing. ""Even if he owed her his life, he has no right to trample all over you like this!""

""Chloe‚Äî""

""No, I won't accept this!"" She spun to face me, her eyes burning. ""Five years ago, on the Blood Moon, you nearly tore your soul in half to save him from a rogue attack! And now he has the audacity to remember only her so-called 'kindness'?""

I looked away, saying nothing.

Chapter6

Five days until the ceremony.

I walked into the Pack Council chamber, dressed in a black power suit.

All the Elders were waiting for me.

""Isla, are you certain about this?"" the Head Elder asked, his voice grave.

""I am."" I placed the formal request on the table. ""I am petitioning to suspend the Mating Ceremony.""

The chamber fell silent.

""Why?"" the Second Elder asked.

""Personal reasons.""

""Personal reasons?"" the Third Elder stood up. ""This is about an alliance between two powerful families!""

""That's your concern,"" I said, turning to leave. ""My decision is final.""

Furious discussion erupted behind me, but I didn't look back.

When I got back to the apartment building, I saw the familiar black sedan.

They were back.

The elevator doors opened, and Damien and Seraphina were standing inside.

Seraphina looked well, a healthy flush on her cheeks.

Damien's arm was still wrapped protectively around her waist.

""Isla?"" Damien's eyes widened in surprise when he saw me. ""Where have you been?""

""Taking care of some business.""

We rode up together in a tense, suffocating silence.

""You cleared out the herb garden?"" Damien asked as he pushed open our apartment door and saw the empty balcony.

""Gave it away.""

""Why?""

""I don't need it anymore.""

Damien frowned but didn't press further.

Seraphina walked onto the balcony, feigning surprise. ""Wow, it's so empty. I bet it was beautiful before.""

""It was fine.""

""Isla, I'm so grateful for your understanding,"" Seraphina said, turning to me, a strange light in her eyes.

""Why don't we all have dinner together tonight? I'd love to thank you properly.""

I just stared at her.

Seeing my coldness, Seraphina's expression immediately changed, her eyes welling up with tears.

""Did... did I say something wrong?"" She turned to Damien, her voice trembling. ""I just wanted to show my gratitude...""

Damien's face instantly darkened.

""Isla,"" he growled, his voice laced with the Alpha command. ""Control yourself. Seraphina is our guest. You are making her uncomfortable.""

I looked at him calmly. ""Fine.""

At dinner, the nutrient broth arrived.

Damien had ordered it specially for Seraphina.

I recognized the scent immediately: Heart-leaf, an herb whose properties only activate for a she-wolf bonded to the Alpha who serves it.

He served a bowl and handed it to me. ""You should have some too. It's good for you.""

I took the bowl and sipped.

A foreign, repulsive energy instantly warred with my own.

My body recoiled, the rejection a physical, agonizing proof of his betrayal.

Damien froze.

He had forgotten.

That herb no longer worked for me.

My phone rang.

Ignoring Damien, I stepped out onto the balcony, sliding the glass door shut behind me before answering in a hushed voice.

""Miss Isla? This is the secretary from the Laurel Guild. Your flight has been confirmed.""

""Good,"" I said, my voice steady despite the turmoil inside me. ""The ceremony is off. I'm ready to leave.""

Just as I hung up, a deep, commanding voice came from behind me.

""Who's leaving?""

Chapter7

I spun around. Damien was standing just outside the balcony door, his eyes like chips of ice.

The lingering pain from the energy clash had made me forget‚Äîan Alpha‚Äôs hearing could cut straight through walls.

Thank the Goddess, he hadn‚Äôt heard everything.

""A healer friend of mine,"" I answered calmly , stepping past him and back into the dining room. ""She's going to South America to study new herbs.""

Damien walked over and sat back down. ""Which friend?""

""You don't know her.""

""Her name.""

""Why should I tell you?""

Seraphina coughed softly from the side. ""Damien, don't be so hard on Isla. A girl's secrets are important.""

Her words seemed to calm him down.

""Sorry,"" he said to me, though his eyes were still full of suspicion.

But he didn‚Äôt press further, seeming reluctant to sour the mood any more.

His gaze softened as he turned to Seraphina, pulling a beautiful box from his jacket.

""What's that?"" Seraphina asked curiously.

""It's for you.""

Inside was an obsidian pendant, carved with intricate runes.

I could read them clearly: Damien & Seraphina, Forever Bonded.

""It's gorgeous!"" Seraphina exclaimed, putting it on. ""Is this a mate's token?""

""Mmmhmm."" Damien fastened the chain for her. ""I've infused it with my Alpha energy. It will protect you and the pup.""

He took out his phone and snapped a picture of her in the mirror.

""Smile.""

She beamed like a child, her eyes shining with pure happiness.

Damien immediately sent her the photo with the caption: My precious one.

""It suits you,"" I commented.

Damien looked at me, a flicker of distance in his eyes.

The next afternoon, I went to the werewolf-exclusive apothecary to buy some last-minute travel supplies.

As I reached the door, I heard a familiar voice inside.

""Check the heartbeat again.""

It was Damien.

Through the glass, I could see Seraphina lying on a treatment bed, with Damien standing nervously beside her.

""Everything's normal,"" the pack healer said. ""The pup is very healthy.""

""Thank you,"" Damien said, taking Seraphina's hand. ""The healer says the pup will be very strong.""

I turned to leave, but the chime of the door gave me away.

""Isla?"" Seraphina called out from inside. ""Are you here for herbs too?""

""Just passing by.""

""Wait, we can leave together,"" she called back to Damien. ""I'll be right out.""

Ten minutes later, they came out together.

""How are the ceremony preparations going?"" Seraphina asked innocently. ""I hear it's going to be huge.""

""The ceremony will proceed as planned,"" Damien answered for me. ""It's just been delayed a bit.""

I looked at them and said nothing.

""Isla, I know you must be feeling hurt,"" Seraphina said, stepping closer to me. ""But I hope you don't give up on Damien. You're the one he truly loves.""

Her voice was sincere, her eyes brimming with tears.

""I don't deserve such a good man. You're his fated mate.""

Onlookers on the street started to whisper.

""That girl is so kind.""

""She's willing to suffer for someone else's happiness.""

""Why does that Isla woman look so cold?""

I turned and walked away.

""Isla!"" Seraphina called after me. ""Please don't misunderstand, I really don't want to take him from you!""

She ran up, trying to grab my arm.

""I know you're angry, but please, just give us a chance to explain‚Äî""

""Let go of me,"" I said, shaking her off.

The moment my hand made contact, she didn't just stumble.

She threw herself sideways with a theatrical gasp, aiming directly for the ancient laurel tree.

Laurel trees have a repulsive energy to weaker werewolves; she should have known that.

""Ah!"" she screamed, slamming hard against the trunk before collapsing to the ground in a heap.

""Seraphina!"" Damien roared, rushing to her side.

He saw her on the ground, then looked at my outstretched hand, and his eyes blazed with a fury I had never seen directed at me.

""What the hell did you do?!"" he roared, dropping to his knees beside her. ""How could you attack a pregnant she-wolf?!""

""I didn't‚Äî""

""Enough!"" Damien cut me off. ""In front of all these people, you will apologize to Seraphina! Now!""

Chapter8

""I'm not apologizing.""

My voice cut through the murmuring crowd.

Damien froze. ""What did you say?""

""I said, I am not apologizing."" I pointed to a nearby building. ""There's a security memory crystal on that building. It records everything. Shall we review the footage?""

The color drained from Seraphina's face.

""No... don't bother,"" she said weakly. ""It was probably just an accident...""

But her words were cut off by a pained groan.

""The energy backlash!"" She clutched her chest, her face turning even paler. ""The laurel tree's repelling energy is too strong!""

Damien immediately scooped her into his arms. ""Hang on. I'm taking you to the healers.""

He sprinted across the street to the healing center without a single glance back at me.

The crowd began to disperse, but the whispers continued.

""That Isla is so cold-blooded.""

""The poor girl is pregnant and hurt, and she won't even say sorry.""

""No wonder the Alpha prefers the gentle one.""

I stood there, staring in the direction of the healing center.

Then I turned and walked away.

The next day was the final day before the ceremony.

In the morning, I shipped all my luggage.

All that was left was a small backpack with my essentials and my plane ticket.

A three o'clock flight.

At ten that night, Damien finally returned.

""How is Seraphina?"" I asked.

""Stable,"" he said, his voice frigid. ""The pack healer said if she hadn't gotten there in time, she could have lost the pup.""

""That's good.""

Damien stalked over to me, the anger still simmering in his eyes.

""At the ceremony tomorrow,"" he commanded, his voice leaving no room for argument, ""you will make a public apology to her.""

""What ceremony?""

""Our Mating Ceremony."" He frowned. ""Did you forget?""

I looked at him and suddenly wanted to laugh.

""You really think there's going to be a ceremony?""

""Of course there is. I've already informed all the Elders."" Damien's tone grew impatient. ""For the sake of the pack's honor, you need to be the bigger person.""

His phone suddenly rang.

""Damien, I'm not feeling well,"" Seraphina's voice came through the speaker. ""Can you come be with me?""

Damien shot to his feet. ""I'm on my way.""

He grabbed his jacket and headed for the door.

""Nine a.m. tomorrow. Don't be late,"" he commanded without looking back. ""The ceremony will proceed on time.""

The moment the door clicked shut, I let the silence settle.

Then, I spoke the words into the empty room, each one a final, liberating vow.

""I, Isla, reject you, Damien.""

He was already gone.

I waited until morning.

Sitting at the dining table, I took out the calendar marked with the ceremony date.

With a red pen, on today's date, I wrote:

The Bond is Rejected.

Then I grabbed my suitcase and walked out of the place I had once called home.

On the way to the airport, I sent a single text to the Head Elder.

Initiate the Severing Ritual. The Mating Ceremony is canceled.

By 9:30 a.m., my plane was in the air.

Below me, the city‚Äîthe pack, my past, him‚Äîshrank until it was swallowed by the clouds.

I pictured Damien in that moment.

He would have arrived at the sacred altar by now.

Dressed in his finest robes, waiting for his bride.

1mptw2j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Witch/comments/1mptw2j/do_i_need_to_cleanse_my_energy/,do i need to cleanse my energy?,"hello everyone, i am not very familiar with witchcraft or this sub so i hope this is not inappropriate. i thought this would be the best place to ask for this topic.

i have a tarot deck that i occasionally use for fun, i dont think i am good enough at getting the meaning from the cards to offer and trustable readings but it's fun either way. however, something happened recently that worried me a little bit.

i was out with my mother and my brother and offered them readings (i try to do as many readings as possible so i can learn better by experience). however, i noticed that on all four readings I've done that day (two for my mom‚Äî one being a yes/no one, one for my brother, one for myself). maybe this is because i am just not great at readings but they all came out extremely negative. i tried really hard to view them in a more positive light but i just couldnt make it. and they were all about very seperate different things so it seemed a bit off to me that all of those things would be so negative.

as a sort of confirmation of my thoughts, my mom and i went to visit her friend yesterday and they had coffee ground readings there (since those are really prominent and important in our culture). and what do you know, my mom's reading said almost the exact opposite of one of my readings, saying she would have abundance and some money coming in soon.

i also generally feel very drained and lethargic after any kind of work that interacts with energies (tarot readings, other readings, loa, manifestation, etc). i am not very experienced with these kinda stuff so i could be wrong, but sometimes i worry that there is some kinda bad spell or energy on me that i need to find a way to ward off or cleanse. (i also have an ex-friend who i know placed / tried to place negative spells on others, so that's adding to my worry as well since we no longer are on speaking turns.)

from what I've said, do you think that's true? and if it is, what can i do to help with this situation? thank you for reading this long post and also for replying. have a wonderful day!! 

tldr: I've had some stuff happen to me recently that made me feel like i might have a lot of negative energy on me or some sort of bad spell put on me maybe. so I'm asking if that is indeed the case and if it is what i can do to change it.",2,1755156790.0,Witch,1,1.0,False

‚ÄúI wrote a letter on a nothing day/I asked someone, ‚Äúhey could you send my letter away?‚Äù/‚Äúyou are too young to put all of your hopes in just one envelope‚Äù ‚ÄîBelle and Sebastian ‚ÄúIf she Wants Me‚Äù

Good day/evening to wherever you might be right now! As I write this it is very early in the morning. A time I occupy frequently given my odd work schedule. Please forgive me in advance, I‚Äôm in an interesting headspace, so this might come off a little strange. 

Let me try and describe my personality. I‚Äôm quiet, introverted, shy, a deep thinker, and someone who loves deep conversations. I can be overly analytical at times. I‚Äôm someone who feels the death of god reverberate through my soul (I told you this might get strange). I‚Äôm also polite, kind, and I love to laugh. So, please don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm more serious than I sound. I do have a tendency to be melancholic, though. (I mean, who doesn‚Äôt love a touch of melancholy?) 

My physical description will be shorter. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô5, brown hair, bluish green eyes, occasionally I wear glasses. Normal weight for my size. I‚Äôm happy to exchange pictures once we are both comfortable with each other. 

I love to read (literature, poetry, history, philosophy), write poetry, discuss films/tv series, wander art galleries or hiking trails, and drink too much coffee. My favorite writers are Chekhov, Milan Kundera, Kafka, and Fernando Pessoa. I love sharing music. My favorite musical artists are Okkervil River, Bright Eyes, the National, the Mountain Goats, Phoebe Bridgers, and Leonard Cohen. I‚Äôve been trying to watch more films. This past weekend I watched ‚Äúthe Silence‚Äù, ‚Äúthe Seventh Seal‚Äù, and ‚Äúthe Trial‚Äù. 

In terms of a potential partner, an emotional connection is important to me. I‚Äôm looking for my best friend. Someone to enjoy life with. Explore the world. Someone who loves deep conversations and wants to cuddle while we watch movies over a long weekend. Maybe if you are a little more extroverted than I am you will even end up pulling me out of my shell a little bit. But I‚Äôm ready for fall and it would be great to find someone who loves being outside in the fall. 

If anything I wrote resonated with you, please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out. I would love to hear all about your favorite film. The last song you listened to on repeat. The painting that managed to catch your feelings perfectly. The poem you return to frequently. The book you still think about years after you‚Äôve read it. Or the thoughts that keep you up at night (isn‚Äôt insomnia the best?) 

Any sort of relationship takes time to develop. I‚Äôm not against the idea of relocating, but I should note it would take me a while to be able to do that. I‚Äôve made posts before and I‚Äôve gained some wonderful friendships from them. So if that‚Äôs all that comes from this it will not be a loss. Given my work schedule I may not be able to reply immediately. I apologize in advance. I hope everyone finds who they are looking for. I know how lonely this process can be.

And honestly? I was kinda here for it‚Äîuntil I realized I was the main character in this disaster movie.

My boyfriend Miles was doing his usual thing: arm around me but scrolling TikTok, basically treating me like human furniture. The whole setup screamed ‚Äútrying too hard‚Äù‚Äîstolen beakers from chem class filled with flat Sprite, those cheap LED strips everyone orders off Amazon, and music so low you could barely hear it over everyone‚Äôs performative giggling.

‚ÄúBro, this is so aesthetic,‚Äù someone whispered, probably filming for their private story.

I was already feeling weird‚Äîthat chest-tight, can‚Äôt-breathe thing that happens when you‚Äôre pretending everything‚Äôs fine but your body‚Äôs like ‚Äúma‚Äôam, we are NOT fine.‚Äù But whatever. Smile, laugh at the right moments, don‚Äôt be the buzzkill. Standard operating procedure.

Jaylen looked half-dead but still chaotic as hell. ‚ÄúTruth or dare, my guy?‚Äù

Everyone leaned in like this was the Met Gala reveal or something. Miles barely looked up from his phone. ‚ÄúTruth, I guess.‚Äù

And Jaylen‚Äîsweet, stupid Jaylen‚Äîgrinned like he‚Äôd just discovered fire. ‚ÄúSo are you two finally gonna hook up tonight or what?‚Äù

The laughter hit different. Not the good kind. The kind that makes your skin crawl and your stomach drop to your literal ass.

I opened my mouth to deflect‚Äîclassic Zoey move‚Äîbut Miles beat me to it.

‚ÄúI dunno, ask her. She‚Äôs still saving it for marriage or whatever.‚Äù

The room exploded. Not cute giggles anymore. Full-on cackling. I felt my soul leave my body and hover somewhere near the ceiling, watching this train wreck in real time.

‚ÄúExcuse me, what the actual fuck?‚Äù My voice came out all breathy and weird.

Miles didn‚Äôt even blink. ‚ÄúCome on, Z. Don‚Äôt act shocked. We‚Äôve been together for two years. At some point you gotta stop being scared of your own body.‚Äù

Dead silence. The kind that makes your ears ring.

Amber Mays‚Äîbecause OF COURSE that pick-me girl was there‚Äîsmirked from her little spot on the floor, looking like she‚Äôd been waiting her whole life for this moment. Girl probably had her whole strategy planned out. I know she‚Äôs had her eye set on Miles for a while now.

I stood up so fast I got dizzy. Everything felt wrong‚Äîmy hands, my legs, the air itself. Like I was underwater but also on fire. I just knew I had to get out before I completely lost it in front of everyone.

Miles followed me into the hallway, his footsteps echoing off the lockers like some horror movie soundtrack.

‚ÄúZoey, wait up,‚Äù he called out, casual as hell. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean to embarrass you.‚Äù

I whipped around so fast. ‚ÄúThen what the hell WAS that?‚Äù

He ran his hand through his hair‚Äîthat thing he does when he‚Äôs about to say something that‚Äôll ruin my entire week. ‚ÄúI just‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt keep doing this anymore.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoing what exactly?‚Äù

‚ÄúWaiting for you to grow up.‚Äù

The audacity. THE AUDACITY.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still acting like we‚Äôre in middle school,‚Äù he continued, like he was explaining basic math to a toddler. ‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs rules and college apps and five-year plans. I need someone who‚Äôs actually fun.‚Äù

I stared at him. Actually stared. ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre dumping me because I won‚Äôt sleep with you?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he said, and somehow this was worse. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm dumping you because you‚Äôre boring, Zoey. You‚Äôre safe. And I‚Äôm over being safe.‚Äù

He turned around and walked away like he hadn‚Äôt just nuked my entire existence. And when I looked through those glass doors? He was already next to Amber, whispering in her ear like I‚Äôd never existed.

Two years. TWO YEARS. I helped him write his college essays. I went to every single one of his lacrosse games, even the away ones that were like three hours in his mom‚Äôs minivan. I gave him everything except the one thing he decided was the only thing that mattered.

I don‚Äôt remember walking to the courtyard. One second I was staring through those doors, the next I was sitting on a freezing bench with a crumpled flyer about senior pictures stuck to my shoe. ‚ÄúCapture the moment!‚Äù it said. Yeah, I‚Äôd like to capture this moment and delete it from existence, thanks.

My phone was dead‚Äîobviously‚Äîand my hands were shaking like I‚Äôd had twelve Red Bulls. I folded myself into a little ball and tried not to think about how I was gonna face everyone tomorrow. How I was gonna survive the group chat blowing up. How I was gonna explain to my mom why Miles wasn‚Äôt coming to family dinner anymore.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got that haunted look. Long night?‚Äù

I jerked my head up so fast I saw stars. Some guy was there‚Äîleaning against the bench across from me like he owned the shadows, hoodie slouched just enough to hint at sharp collarbones, one hand deep in his pocket, the other holding a bag of pretzels like it was a cigarette in a noir film. The streetlamp carved gold out of his cheekbones. His eyes flicked up, slow and deliberate, and locked on mine.

It was like being hit by a song I didn‚Äôt know I loved yet.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

He tilted his head, smiling‚Äînot sweet, not safe.

‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù he said, completely unbothered, ‚Äúgirl alone in the dark, emotional damage at peak levels. Very indie music video vibes. All you need is a cigarette and some pretentious caption about how love is dead.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo I know you?‚Äù I squinted at him through the dark.

He stepped forward just a little‚Äîclose enough that I could catch the trace of something expensive on his hoodie, something unruly and male and magnetic. His mouth curved.

‚ÄúNot yet. Chase Donovan.‚Äù

Oh. OH. That Chase Donovan. The one teachers sighed about and girls got reckless over. The one who‚Äôd been in more fights than classes last semester, who wore bruises like accessories.The one with the family scandal, the broken-home mythology, the brother-shaped silence nobody ever explained.

The one Amber has been feverishly obsessed with before she finally gave up and switched to Miles.

He wasn‚Äôt just hot. He was dangerous like a secret you¬†*want*¬†to get caught keeping.

He tossed a pretzel onto the bench next to me. ‚ÄúWant one?‚Äù

‚ÄúDo I look like I want a pretzel right now?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou look like you need something.‚Äù

‚ÄúI need everyone to leave me alone.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been alone long enough.‚Äù

The words just hung there, heavy and unwanted. I could‚Äôve told him to fuck off. Should‚Äôve, probably. But there was something about the way he said it‚Äîno pity, no weird savior complex. Just‚Ä¶ observation.

‚ÄúDo you always ambush girls when their lives implode?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúOnly the interesting ones.‚Äù

I let out this bitter laugh. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt even know what happened.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt need to,‚Äù he shrugged. ‚ÄúWhatever it was sucked. You‚Äôre radiating damage.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat obvious?‚Äù

‚ÄúTo me.‚Äù

I looked away because his honesty was making my chest feel weird. Everything felt upside down. Like gravity had stopped working properly. But somehow he didn‚Äôt feel threatening. He wasn‚Äôt trying to fix me or comfort me or feed me bullshit about how everything happens for a reason.

‚ÄúYou ever think maybe ‚Äòsafe‚Äô is just code for ‚ÄòI‚Äôm too lazy to actually see you‚Äô?‚Äù he asked, voice quieter now.

My throat burned. I didn‚Äôt answer, but I didn‚Äôt tell him to leave either.

He didn‚Äôt push. Just stood there, patient and still, like he had nowhere else to be. Like watching me fall apart was somehow interesting instead of pathetic.

‚ÄúGuess I‚Äôll let you get back to your melancholy,‚Äù he said, voice low and lazy, but not unkind. ‚ÄúSee you around, heartbreak.‚Äù

And then he turned‚Äîno fanfare, no second look‚Äîand strolled off like he hadn‚Äôt just cracked something open in me I‚Äôd been duct taping shut for weeks.

I hated how much I wanted him to stay.

Chapter 2

Everyone knew. And literally no one had the balls to say anything.

That was the part that gutted me‚Äînot Miles being a cheating asshole, not Amber‚Äôs smug little victory lap, not even the whispers that followed me like a bad soundtrack. It was the silence. The way people I‚Äôd shared inside jokes with suddenly developed fascinating interests in their shoes whenever I walked by.

‚ÄúHey Zoey‚Äî‚Äù Danica started at my locker, then saw me actually look at her and noped right out. Just pivoted and speed-walked down a hallway she‚Äôd never used in her life.

Grace managed a weak wave before studying the floor like it held the secrets of the universe.

I wasn‚Äôt even mad at them. How do you comfort someone whose boyfriend dumped them for being ‚Äúboring‚Äù in front of half the senior class? There‚Äôs no Hallmark card for that level of social annihilation.

By lunch, I was operating on pure spite and caffeeria coffee. Sat at our usual table like nothing had changed, except now I was basically invisible. The soccer guys were whispering and snickering too loud‚Äîprobably not about me, but paranoia doesn‚Äôt really care about logic.

I dumped my untouched sandwich and left. The sound of it hitting the trash echoed louder than any conversation I‚Äôd had all day.

At home, Mom ambushed me with her daily agenda. ‚ÄúScholarship forms are due Friday. Also, Mrs. Byrne says you‚Äôre slipping in calc.‚Äù

No ‚Äúhow was your day?‚Äù No ‚Äúyou look like someone ran over your dog.‚Äù Just deadlines and disappointment.

‚ÄúGot it,‚Äù I said, grabbing a water glass with hands that wouldn‚Äôt stop shaking.

‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt forget‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI said I got it.‚Äù

She blinked at my tone but kept going. College apps, practice schedules, GPA maintenance. I took my violin upstairs and pretended to practice while my life crumbled in 4/4 time.

By next morning, I was running on fumes and fury. Everything felt too bright, too loud, too much. My skin was crawling and my thoughts were screaming and I couldn‚Äôt keep pretending this was fine.

English class. Mrs. Reynolds clapped her hands and announced group projects, her voice way too chipper for a Monday morning.

‚ÄúPairs will be assigned‚Äîno swapping. I want new ideas, new perspectives. First up: Amber Mays and‚Ä¶ Zoey Hale.‚Äù

My stomach dropped. I didn‚Äôt even get a chance to process it before Amber turned around, locked eyes with me, and laughed.

Actually laughed.

Then she leaned into Miles, her grin sharp, dismissive‚Äîlike I was background noise. Like this entire class had just become one long, slow nightmare.

Something snapped.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not working with her.‚Äù

Mrs. Reynolds paused mid-sentence. ‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù

‚ÄúI said I‚Äôm not fucking working with her.‚Äù My voice was shaking but I couldn‚Äôt stop. ‚ÄúShe can plagiarize off someone else for once.‚Äù

Dead silence. Then nervous laughter. A few gasps. Amber‚Äôs face twisted like she‚Äôd tasted something rancid.

‚ÄúMiss Hale, hallway. Now.‚Äù

I stood up so fast my chair scraped the floor like nails on a chalkboard. Grabbed my bag, walked out, and didn‚Äôt look back.

Mrs. Reynolds followed me with that teacher voice‚Äîdisappointed but not surprised. Handed me a detention slip like it was my diploma.

‚ÄúRoom 107. After school.‚Äù

I‚Äôd never had detention in my life. Honor roll, perfect attendance, the works. And now here I was, holding a pink slip like a participation trophy for emotional breakdown.

The detention room smelled like dry erase markers and industrial cleaner. Fluorescent lights buzzing overhead like angry wasps. I dropped into a desk by the window and tried not to think about how I‚Äôd explain this to my parents.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre early.‚Äù

I looked up. Of course. Chase Donovan, feet propped up on a desk, black nail polish chipped, watching me like I was his personal entertainment.

‚ÄúYou again,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúYou make a habit of public meltdowns, or was that a limited engagement?‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt plan it.‚Äù

‚ÄúBest explosions never are.‚Äù He shifted in his seat, studying me. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre just overdue.‚Äù

I stared out the window. Everything looked wrong‚Äîthe parking lot, the trees, even the sky seemed off-color. Like someone had adjusted the saturation on my entire life.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not like this,‚Äù I muttered.

‚ÄúLike what?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis.‚Äù I gestured at the room, at myself, at the general disaster of my existence. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt do detention. I don‚Äôt cause scenes. I follow rules.‚Äù

‚ÄúCongratulations. You‚Äôre evolving.‚Äù

I should‚Äôve felt ashamed. Should‚Äôve been mortified. But underneath all the hurt and humiliation, there was this tiny spark of something that felt like‚Ä¶ relief? Like I‚Äôd finally stopped holding my breath.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what they‚Äôre saying about me,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúYou will,‚Äù Chase replied, not unkindly. ‚ÄúJust not today.‚Äù

I looked at him‚Äîreally looked. He wasn‚Äôt judging or pitying or trying to fix me. He was just‚Ä¶ there. Waiting. Like he‚Äôd been expecting this version of me all along.

That‚Äôs when it hit me. He had seen this coming. Had seen me coming apart before I even knew I was breaking.

And now I was stuck with him in detention.

Chapter 3

Detention moves like expired honey. Thick, sticky, pointless. I‚Äôm tapping my pen against the desk like it‚Äôs morse code for ‚Äúget me out of here,‚Äù but the only person receiving the message is myself, and I‚Äôm already over it.

Chase hasn‚Äôt budged from his corner throne‚Äîfeet up, hood doing that half-mysterious thing, radiating the kind of confidence that should be illegal at eighteen. I keep stealing glances like some stalker freshman, which is mortifying but apparently unstoppable.

No teacher. Just us and the world‚Äôs loudest clock, marking time like it‚Äôs personally offended by our existence.

‚ÄúYou always this wound up, or am I just exceptionally gifted at making people uncomfortable?‚Äù

I whip around. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not wound up.‚Äù

He doesn‚Äôt even bother arguing. Just grins like he‚Äôs already won a bet I didn‚Äôt know we were making.

‚ÄúYou always this cocky?‚Äù I fire back.

‚ÄúOnly when I‚Äôm correct.‚Äù

The audacity. I look away before I say something that gets me another detention. He‚Äôs not like anyone in my orbit‚Äîdoesn‚Äôt perform for attention, just commands it like gravity. Makes me feel off-balance and weirdly visible at the same time.

Silence stretches between us, but now it‚Äôs different. Electric. Like the air before a storm that might destroy everything or water the garden‚Äîyou can‚Äôt tell which.

My brain won‚Äôt shut up. Miles and Amber on repeat: her glossy smile, his casual cruelty, everyone laughing like my humiliation was the evening‚Äôs entertainment.

‚ÄúYou ever want to just‚Ä¶ burn it all down?‚Äù The words escape before I can stop them.

Chase tilts his head. ‚ÄúDepends what we‚Äôre torching.‚Äù

‚ÄúEverything. Everyone.‚Äù

He leans forward, interest sparking. ‚ÄúWhat would that look like?‚Äù

‚ÄúFake dating you.‚Äù

The sentence detonates in the space between us. My heart slams against my ribs like it‚Äôs trying to escape the scene of the crime. I want to rewind, delete, pretend I‚Äôm having an aneurysm instead of a revelation.

Chase blinks. Slow. Deliberate. ‚ÄúCome again?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou heard me.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou want to fake date me.‚Äù He says it like he‚Äôs reading ingredients off a particularly suspicious energy drink.

I nod, cheeks blazing. ‚ÄúTo mess with them.‚Äù

He studies me like I‚Äôm a social experiment gone rogue. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs unhinged.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs genius.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs both.‚Äù He laughs‚Äînot mean, just surprised. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre actually serious.‚Äù

‚ÄúAmber‚Äôs been obsessed with you since freshman year. And Miles?‚Äù I lean forward, momentum building. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll absolutely lose his shit watching me with the one guy who actually makes him feel small.‚Äù

‚ÄúI make him feel small?‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease. You know exactly what you do.‚Äù

Chase doesn‚Äôt deny it. Just smirks like I‚Äôve finally said something interesting.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm done being the good girl,‚Äù I continue, words tumbling out like I‚Äôm confessing to a crime. ‚ÄúDone being safe, boring, forgettable. I want chaos. I want revenge. I want them to choke on their own smugness.‚Äù

‚ÄúRevenge, huh?‚Äù He kicks his feet down, sits up straighter. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs in it for me?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù

‚ÄúEntertainment. And you‚Äî‚Äù he points at me like I‚Äôm evidence in his case, ‚Äú‚Äîare about to be very entertaining.‚Äù

My stomach flips. ‚ÄúThis is insane.‚Äù

‚ÄúCompletely.‚Äù He stands, all lazy confidence and dangerous energy. ‚ÄúWhich is why it‚Äôs perfect.‚Äù

I grab my bag, hands shaking slightly. ‚ÄúGround rules?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo rules. That‚Äôs the entire point.‚Äù

We walk toward the door together, and everything feels tilted‚Äîthe hallway, my heartbeat, the fundamental laws of who I thought I was. This isn‚Äôt me. I don‚Äôt make impulsive decisions with boys who collect detentions like trophies.

But maybe that‚Äôs exactly why it feels so right.

At the exit, Chase stops. ‚ÄúYou sure about this, Hale? No take-backs once we start the show.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm terrified.‚Äù

His grin spreads slow and wicked. ‚ÄúEven better.‚Äù",1,1755156645.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

As the topic title suggests, I was (maybe still am?) a 33-year-old child, not an adult. Over the past year, I‚Äôve been running away from responsibility for my life. Instead of actually dealing with it, I just analyzed the past and possible future, unable to move forward or take any action. And so the days, months, and a year went by ‚Äî and what did I do for myself? Very little.

Of course, like most of you, I grew up with the NES system, where Super Mario and so on stole my attention. You know the drill. Then came PC gaming and GTA 3, and later I had an Xbox and a PS4. Everything that reminded me of gaming I either sold, broke, or gave away ‚Äî my gaming PC went to my dad. And as if that wasn‚Äôt enough, I escaped into browsing the internet, drinking excessive amounts of coffee, watching pornography, isolating myself‚Ä¶ It just became routine. That‚Äôs the worst part. And habits‚Ä¶ well, they‚Äôre a damn iron shirt.

So what about this realization? It can‚Äôt just be about crying over spilled milk. You have to take responsibility for your life. Deal with things immediately instead of putting them off. You also need to look at your main problem ‚Äî the root of everything. I have to admit, my problem is laziness and fear. I don‚Äôt want this text to be too general.

My mom used to tell me: *‚ÄúGet yourself together already. You‚Äôre 33, single, and living with us in the house. You‚Äôre unemployed right now and time is slipping away.‚Äù* And she‚Äôs right.

I see much younger people who already have families, cars, apartments, or houses. I have nothing but myself. Oh, and I also have a laptop where I replaced Windows with Linux. Great‚Ä¶

Don‚Äôt be like me. Deal with it right away. Because years will pass and all you‚Äôll be left with is a hole in your chest and nothing of value.

The basic idea is that one of the hotel clients mysteriously vanished in the night. Here‚Äôs the characters we have so far:

The Detective. He takes his job seriously, but can be a bit awkward and silly in his earnestness. Age maybe mid 30s. 

The Superintendent. (We don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs the right rank, it‚Äôs just what our teacher said.) He‚Äôs the assistant of The Detective, and mainly takes notes and makes tea/coffee. He‚Äôs not very good at his job, although he‚Äôs a loveable guy. Age early 30s. 

The Maid. She works at the hotel and is one of the interviewees. She‚Äôs secretly behind the disappearance, and is working with The Businessman. Age late 20s. We chose the name Rosa, but we still need a surname. 

The Maid‚Äôs Son. We haven‚Äôt decided much about him yet, but he‚Äôs about 6 years old and part of her ‚Äòtouching backstory‚Äô. His father is The Businessman (who doesn‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ I think.) I really like the name √Ångel, but my friend isn‚Äôt convinced. Thoughts?

The Businessman. Colleague/lover/partner in crime with The Maid. Age maybe late 30s. We like the name Raoul. 


That‚Äôs all we have so far. Would love to see your suggestions :)

Every time a women tried to approach me I ""rejected"" but not because I mean it, some of the girls i really liked, but because I wanted to avoid the interaction as much as possible. 

For example I was approached by a girl at my gym and I was shocked, so shocked that I forgot to remove my earbuds and she noticed that she said maybe remove the buds so we can speak. She tought i rejected her so bad she don t even look at me now, but I liked her and i wanted to invite her to coffee but i just couldn t...

I don t know what to do... I cannot make eye contact with women. When some girls look at me, i feel very uncomfortable and i avoid the contact. Maybe i should try see a doctor for anxiety pills. I never approached a women in real life.

It never feels like there's enough stuff that captures the cosy vibes, and it's instead become an excuse for Build-A-Bear to use cheesy phrases and unfitting colours.

Now, I will say that a handful of items from the past few years have impressed me. The aran knit jumper, that v-neck shirt they did in the nice shade of green, the checkered button up shirt they did with the real buttons, and the blue varsity jacket all impressed me and made me want to buy them. It's just a shame that I haven't been able to build any outfits from just stuff in that collection to suit my bears.

When they made the blue varsity jacket, I was really hoping they would make a red one. I can think of at least 3 bears in my collection that would pull it off super well. Cut to this year, and they make a *pink* one!? Come on, there's plenty of pink stuff. I will say that one item caught my eye this year, and that's the jeans with the star print on them. They remind me of a pair of jeans I once had.

I'm sure these sorts of things really appeal to some folks, but they do nothing for me. I'd just love some more subtle, casual stuff for my bears. I don't need any of these ear bows, glittery jeans, or shirts that talk about coffee. It would be really nice if I could have my travel buddy match my style. I've been able to do this a couple of times, but not as much as I'd like.

I know this will probably just sound like whining to some, but I just wanted to get it off my chest. All I've wanted from Build-A-Bear for the past several years is more casual styles that don't lean too far into the cutesy or cheesy side of things, only to get the odd item that kinda fits what I'm looking for.",7,1755156076.0,buildabear,1,1.0,False

She didn‚Äôt look like she was trying to turn heads but mine did.

Our eyes met for barely a second.

For the next week, I saw her there almost every day. The kadai became my stage to watch her. I was on leave for a week, then had night shifts. Two whole weeks.

The kadai was busy, people crowding near the tea master. She was handed tea but frowned, wrong order. She wanted coffee. I was right behind her. ‚Äú If its untouched,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take it, you get your coffee.‚Äù She looked up, surprised, then smiled faintly. ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù And walked away with her coffee.

She looked at me, and I gestured to the space near me. She moved over slowly. ‚ÄúWhere do you work?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúThis building. Sixth floor.‚Äù Pointing to my office Building

‚ÄúSecond floor,‚Äù I replied.

We finished our drinks, walked back together. She worked in a service company, also stuck working on holidays.

As we reached the lobby, she asked casually, ‚ÄúLunch plans?‚Äù ‚ÄúBrought mine from home. Will be eating alone.‚Äù ‚ÄúCome to seventh-floor common area. We can eat together if you want.‚Äù

¬†At lunch, she was already at the table, scrolling her phone. When she saw me, she quickly locked it but I caught a glimpse of her wallpaper. Her own picture.

‚ÄúNice pic,‚Äù I said. She gave a small, shy laugh. We talked about work, then about life.

¬†Both of us admitted our weekends were spent on chores. She asked for my Instagram handle, sent a follow request instantly. By the time we finished lunch, we agreed that we would to chat there.

Around 4 pm, my phone buzzed. ‚ÄúWhat time do you leave work?‚Äù ‚Äú4:30 to 5.

Why?‚Äù

‚ÄúFavour‚Ä¶ drop me at EMU station?‚Äù I agreed.

¬†It was on my way.

When I asked where she stayed, I realised her place was actually not far from mine. But Didn‚Äôt want to sound pushy.

At 5, we walked out together. We reached my bike. She climbed on without hesitation

t a red light, I glanced at her in the mirror.(Like the one in tamil movies) Her eyes were elsewhere.

When we neared her stop, I slowed. ‚ÄúThis is fine?‚Äù I asked. She nodded but didn‚Äôt move immediately. Then, with a small smile, she said Byeee ¬†.

¬†

The next day, her message popped up:

‚ÄúSame like yesterday?‚Äù I reacted with a üëç and typed: ‚ÄúSame time.‚Äù

During the ride in traffic, I mentioned that the next day was my day off. She said she had to work and asked if I had any plans.

‚ÄúLoads of laundry,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúSix white uniform shirts. Gonna be a tiring day.‚Äù

She groaned. ‚ÄúWorst chore ever. I don‚Äôt even have a washing machine‚Ä¶ all by hand.‚Äù

I laughed. ‚ÄúMy place is less than a kilometre from yours. If I am home, you can use mine.‚Äù

¬†When I dropped her off, she smiled, said ‚ÄúBye,‚Äù and started walking.

¬†

At 11 PM, my phone buzzed. ‚ÄúCan I use your machine tomorrow?‚Äù

¬†I asked, ‚ÄúHow? You‚Äôre going to office.‚Äù

She replied with a laughing emoji: ‚ÄúLeave potutain.‚Äù

The next morning, I was up early, tidying the hall, clearing the laundry pile, making space.

At 9:30, the bell rang. She stood there in a simple cotton salwar, hair loosely tied, carrying a large bag of clothes.

¬†Without the office crowd, she looked‚Ä¶ softer. More at ease. I took the bag from her and led her in.

‚ÄúMachine‚Äôs in the kitchen. As the drum filled with water, she stood close, shoulder brushing mine.

We talked, about nothing in particular but her gaze lingered longer now.

When the wash cycle started, she followed me to the sofa, sat cross-legged, and patted the space beside her.

¬†‚ÄúDon‚Äôt sit so far. I don‚Äôt bite.‚Äù Our knees touched as I sat.

She showed me a reel on her phone, leaning close enough that her hair brushed my cheek. The faint scent of coconut and jasmine filled my senses.

At some point, she lowered her phone and looked at me. ‚ÄúYou really didn‚Äôt have other plans today?‚Äù ‚ÄúJust laundry,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAnd lunch with you.‚Äù

¬†Her smile deepened. Her hand rested on my knee, light but deliberate said asked ‚ÄúIs it ??

That was all it took. I leaned in slowly, brushing her lips with mine.

She kissed back, matching my pace unhurried, tasting, testing. Her hand moved higher on my thigh. Mine slid to her waist, feeling the warmth of her skin through the thin cotton.

The kiss deepened. Her lips parted slightly, and I tasted the faint sweetness of her breath. She let out a sigh as my thumb brushed the edge of her kameez.

When she swung a leg over and settled into my lap, the shift was natural. Her knees pressed into the sofa cushions, our bodies aligned now.

My hands explored her back, the soft curves under the fabric, while her fingers curled into my hair, guiding my mouth to hers again and again.

Her hips moved just enough for me to feel her heat through the layers of clothing. The rhythm was, slow, teasing every small movement making me want more.

I let my hands slide under her kameez, palms warm against bare skin now, tracing up her spine. She shivered, breaking the kiss just to breathe against my cheek.

‚ÄúThe machine‚Äôs going to finish soon,‚Äù she whispered.

¬†I smiled. ‚ÄúLet it.‚Äù

Her smile was almost wicked. She took my hand, stood up, and without a word, led me toward the bedroom.

My room was simple, a bed with a folded bedsheet, sunlight filtering in through half-drawn curtains, the faint scent of jasmine from her hair.

She let go of my hand only to turn and face me, her back to the bed. I stepped forward until the space between us disappeared. I kissed her again, with no reason to hold back.

Her hands slid under my t-shirt, fingertips grazing my stomach before moving up to my chest. The feel of her nails on my skin sent a small shiver up my spine.

I let my hands explore her waist, sliding slowly up her sides, feeling her breath quicken. My thumbs brushed just under the swell of her breasts through the thin cotton of her salwar kameez.

She inhaled sharply but didn‚Äôt stop me. I lifted her kameez slowly, revealing a flash of her bare midriff. Her skin was warm, soft under my palms. As I moved the fabric higher, she raised her arms slightly, allowing me to pull it off completely.

Underneath, she wore a simple, faded bra, but the sight of it on her felt intimate in a way that made my pulse race. I kissed her collarbone, trailing down the line of her neck, tasting the faint salt of her skin.

¬†Her hands went to my t-shirt, tugging it up. I let her remove it, her eyes scanning my chest briefly before she stepped closer again, her bare stomach pressing against me.

I unclasped her bra slowly, watching her eyes the whole time. When the straps slipped from her shoulders, she didn‚Äôt look away and she stood there, letting me see her, felt more erotic than anything rushed.

I cupped her breasts gently, thumbs brushing over her nipples until they tightened under my touch. She let out a sound half sigh, half moan as I lowered my head and took one into my mouth, teasing it with my tongue while my other hand caressed the other breast.

¬†Her fingers tightened in my hair, her hips shifting against mine. I knelt slightly, my lips travelling down her stomach, stopping at the waistband of her salwar bottoms. I looked up at her, giving her one last chance to tell me to stop.

She bit her lower lip and nodded faintly. I hooked my thumbs into the waistband and slid the fabric down slowly, revealing a plain cotton panty. Even through it, I could see the slight dampness where her arousal had soaked the fabric.

¬†I pressed my mouth softly against her, feeling her tense slightly before she relaxed into it. My hands caressed her thighs, moving upward in slow, deliberate strokes. When I finally slid her panties down, she stepped out of them, standing bare before me. I kissed the inside of her thighs first, teasing, making her wait.

She let out a low, impatient sound, her fingers tightening in my hair again.

¬†I let my tongue find her, long, deliberate strokes that made her hips move involuntarily. Her breath grew heavier, one hand braced against the wall for balance.

I alternated between slow licks and quick flicks, listening to the changes in her breathing. When her thighs began to tremble, I pulled back, standing to kiss her again, tasting her on my lips.

She pulled me toward the bed. We lay down, her back against the mattress, me above her. My hand slid down between us, fingers finding her already wet and ready. I teased her entrance with circles, then slid one finger in, then two, curling them just right. Her eyes fluttered shut, her hips rising to meet my hand. I kissed her deeply, swallowing her moans.

When I finally positioned myself at her entrance, she opened her eyes again, looking right into mine as I pushed in slowly, inch by inch, until I was fully inside her. We moved together at an unhurried pace at first each thrust measured, deep, and deliberate. Her nails raked lightly down my back, her legs wrapping around my waist to pull me closer.

The sound of our bodies meeting, the faint creak of the bed, her soft moans filling the room it all blended into a rhythm that built naturally, steadily.

When I quickened the pace, her breath turned into short, urgent gasps. I felt her tighten around me, her whole body tensing before she let out a deep, shaking moan as she came, clinging to me.

For a moment, we just lay there, bodies pressed together, the only sound our uneven breathing. I kissed her forehead, and she smiled tired, satisfied, still holding me close. ‚Äú

Thursday arrived with a soft hum that sounded like a thousand tiny alarms all set a second too early. The building seemed to anticipate it‚Äîthe lights flickered like a heartbeat, and even the shadows I had been watching at noon seemed restless, stretching in ways that made my stomach turn and my coffee taste worse.

I sat at my desk, watching the clocks tick erratically, and wondered if I had somehow skipped the first three days or if time itself was mocking me. Maris appeared as if she had materialized out of the fluorescent air.

‚ÄúReady for Thursday?‚Äù she asked, her blazer-patterned calendars jostling as she moved. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the day you either impress everyone‚Ä¶ or get mildly cursed by destiny.‚Äù

I swallowed. ‚ÄúMildly cursed sounds safer.‚Äù

She smiled knowingly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre new. You‚Äôll learn.‚Äù

Then she handed me a folder labeled: ‚ÄòTasks That Don‚Äôt Exist Yet‚Äô. I opened it to find a list of things that made no sense:
	1.	Staple yesterday to tomorrow.
	2.	Whisper your name to the coffee machine.
	3.	Argue with a shadow until it agrees with you.
	4.	Introduce yourself to the time-traveling hamster.

I blinked. ‚ÄúThese aren‚Äôt‚Ä¶ real tasks, are they?‚Äù

Maris shrugged. ‚ÄúDepends on your definition of real. Also, you have to finish them before lunch.‚Äù

Lunch. The concept seemed irrelevant here, but somehow it was also critical.

‚∏ª

Meeting the Hamster

I walked over to Vera, who was crouched by a small cage in the corner. Inside, a golden hamster with tiny goggles ran furiously on a wheel.

‚ÄúMeet Galileo,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs trained in temporal navigation. Also, he‚Äôs incredibly judgmental.‚Äù

I leaned closer. The hamster paused mid-step and stared at me. Then it squeaked as if saying: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre late.‚Äù

I nodded nervously. ‚ÄúRight. Sorry. I‚Äôll‚Ä¶ do better.‚Äù

Vera smiled. ‚ÄúGood. Thursday is the day he tests new recruits.‚Äù

‚∏ª

The Coffee Conspiracy

Nolan appeared beside me, muttering to the office plants. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not just plants,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre monitoring caffeine intake. If you drink too much copier coffee, the files get rewritten.‚Äù

I glanced at my cup. The coffee hadn‚Äôt changed in flavor‚Äîit was still burned toner and regret‚Äîbut now I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was safe. I sipped cautiously and tried to focus.

‚∏ª

Confronting Julian

Julian appeared with that same irritating smile. ‚ÄúI see the shadows told you about the coffee,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOr maybe you figured it out yourself.‚Äù

I shook my head. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just trying to survive Thursday.‚Äù

He laughed, a sound like tiny wind chimes in a storm. ‚ÄúThursday doesn‚Äôt want you to survive. Thursday wants you to participate.‚Äù

I nodded. Sort of. Maybe.

‚∏ª

The Tasks

By noon, I had stapled invisible documents, whispered my name to the copier, argued politely with a shadow, and bowed to Galileo. Exhausted but oddly proud, I returned to my desk.

A note appeared on my keyboard:

‚ÄúCongratulations. You didn‚Äôt break anything. Yet.‚Äù

Maris appeared once more, smiling like a teacher who had just graded an impossible test. ‚ÄúSee? Thursday isn‚Äôt so bad. Tomorrow, you start figuring out why all of this exists.‚Äù

I stared at her. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

She winked. ‚ÄúPatience, Employee #2937. Time doesn‚Äôt exist here, but the lesson does.‚Äù

‚∏ª

By the end of Thursday, I realized something: this office was less about the work and more about surviving the surreal. And somewhere, in a corner I hadn‚Äôt noticed before, a new shadow waited, pulsing, watching me, as if ready to teach me the next lesson.

Been working on embracing singledom during that time, and part of that means shutting down anything that looks like it's going romantic.

Some time ago one of my friends invited me tk a gathering at his place. Recently been taking space for myself so I declined, but he was super insistent so I figured why not. While there he brought me over to this woman who I only knew from him mentioning her name as ankther friend of his and said we should be friends. It felt a lot like he was trying to set up a romantic thing and I was annoyed, but whatever, figured it wouldn't hurt to shoot the shit for a bit. It was a nice chat and she asked for my number before I left so I gave it to her. She then texted a few days later asking to grab coffee and continue the conversation. At this point i agreed to go but made very clear that this was gonna stay completely platonic because I ain't boyfriend material. She seemed to understand that.

We hung out a few more times after that and everything was fine, no complaints. But then she called me one night and said she'd like to take things to a romantic level. I told her again that I enjoy her company and she's a whole heap of fun, but that BFGF was outta the question. Again, she seemed to accept that and I figured the issue was put to bed, but then she asked again and was more insistent this time stating she really feels for me. At this point I said maybe it'd be better to take some time away from each other so she could cool her head.

Next thing my original friend who introduced us hits me up asking why I won't date her when it seems like there's a spark there. Maybe there is; she's a nice woman who's fun to hang with and I see why she'd be getting ideas in her head, but it ain't gonna end well. I fuck up every relationship I been in so far even when I do everything right, so better to nkt engage at all. It's created this awkward dynamic in the friend group where it feels like she and I can't be at the same parties or else there'll be that weird tension.

It was uttered casually over coffee by a friend: ""If you want something modern yet calming, this might just be the place.'' I gave hardly any heed to it then, but after a few days, I had to satisfy my curiosity and go see it myself!

Entering Greater Noida, everything felt very different‚Äîwide roads and well laid-out sectors‚Äîand in general, an attitude toward order is pretty rare in most cities. Approaching Sigma 3, I could notice the greenery along the road, the pretty-low buzz of a growing and serene place.

[Godrej Sigma 3 Greater Noida](https://preview.redd.it/su2c0rv8qxif1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ebb69cd083eae4bc1d8bdb511e01304238d65169)

**What Was I Expecting?**

I wasn‚Äôt entirely sure. Was it going to be another standard residential project with a few flashy amenities? Or would it be something that actually lived up to the Godrej name?

Honestly, Godrej Properties has a reputation for balancing quality construction with modern lifestyle needs, so the bar was already high in my mind. But Sigma 3 had a certain mystery to it ‚Äî a mix of convenience, location, and understated elegance.



**The Location Advantage**

One of the first things that struck me was the super strategic location. Sigma 3 is neither in the heart of chaos nor restrictively cut off from the remaining city. Metro connectivity, easy access to the Yamuna Expressway, and proximity to educational institutions and shopping complexes make it a perfect concoction for peaceful living with all things called urban convenience.

Such is a location that, after a hard day, one feels like having entered an alternate reality-a slightly quieter, greener and more peaceful one.



**First Steps Into the Project**

As I walked through the gates of Godrej Sigma 3, I was greeted with open areas, landscaped gardens, and the comforting sounds of water flowing gently through several outcroppings. I'd been welcomed by a rush of fresh air, as if the air was liberated from a very stuffy promenade of corridors or tightly enclosed buildings.

The architecture was beautiful, almost contemporary, but not unfamiliar-the giant balconies, consciously designed interiors, and layout oriented towards maximum daylight and privacy, all these constraints conceptually screamed from their planning.



**So, What Makes It Special?**

Here‚Äôs where my personal observations turned into genuine admiration. Sigma 3 isn‚Äôt just about giving you an apartment; it‚Äôs about giving you a complete living experience.

* Green Landscapes Everywhere ‚Äì Instead of endless concrete, there are trees, walking paths, and shaded corners where you could imagine reading a book or just unwinding.
* Amenities That Actually Work For You ‚Äì Top-notch gym, swimming pool that isn‚Äôt crammed with families, a community hall for get-together events, and play areas: all to be used in routine life without promises made solely in bulging brochures.
* Assuring Security, Not Suffocating‚Äì Gated access and professional management instill confidence without making you feel as if you are living in a fortress.
* Queer Designs‚ÄìEach apartment is positioned for ventilation and sunlight.



**The Lifestyle Element**

One of the balconies practically invites you to imagine evenings here - warm lighting from the landscaped pathways, neighbors gabbing in the common areas, kids darting around without a care in the world. This is not just a residence in four walls and a roof but rather an entry into a beautiful, safe, and engaged neighborhood.

Working remotely? This may become an unparalleled type of convenience for the resident's stress relief throughout the day.



**Questions That Crossed My Mind**

As I pondered, several questions arose:¬†

1. Would it be convenient enough for commuting purposes?
2. Will this be a viable potential investment for your future?
3. Would facilities still feel fresh and well looked after in five years' time?¬†

Following these considerations, I realized that the Sigma 3 ticks quite a number of boxes - with the location being good enough to feel connected, build quality indicating longevity, and the brand element providing a level of trust that is difficult to put aside.¬†



**The Godrej Signature Touch**

There‚Äôs something about projects by Godrej Properties Greater Noida ‚Äî they carry a certain assurance of quality and a vision for sustainable, future-ready living. Sigma 3 is no different. You can see it in the way green spaces are preserved, how congested layouts have been avoided, and how the amenities encompass all age groups.



**Why It Feels Like Home**

In the end, the whole experience came down to the ambiance. I didn't feel like I was going to ""a project;"" it felt like I was going home to a pre-existing neighborhood filled with warmth and comfort. And there is a feeling of balance - it's modern enough to feel luxurious, but still grounded enough to feel like it belongs.



**Final Thoughts**

If there has ever been a place you envisioned living in a convenient meets calm situation, then Godrej Sigma 3 Greater Noida might be worth taking a look at. It's not just about owning property; it's about upgrading your everyday experience. There are so many aspects that we liked from the quiet, to the utility, to the indoor and outdoor layout, to the brand - everything here is more than just a home.

Sometimes you just ""click"" with a place the first time you see it. That is how I felt about Sigma 3.

Chapter 1 - The Final Breaking Point

Juliet Alvarez had been raised since childhood to become the Freeman family's daughter-in-law.

At twenty, she married Maddox Freeman.

By twenty-two, she gave birth to their son, Kayson.

Kayson took after his father‚Äîquiet, reserved, never seeking her affection.

Last night, for the first time, he approached her on his own: ""Mom, Aunt Arielle is sick and might die. Her wish is to marry Dad. Can you divorce him, please?""

At that moment, she lost all hope for both father and son.

Fine. She would give them what they wanted.

...

At breakfast, she slid the divorce papers across the table to Maddox, laying out her terms.

""I‚Äôve thought about what Kayson said all night. If he loves Arielle that much, then I agree to the divorce.""

""I‚Äôll also give up custody of Kayson and walk away with nothing.""

""The marital assets can be transferred to his name‚Äîconsider it child support.""

Maddox set down his coffee, frowning as he glanced up. ""Were you talking to me just now?""

She noticed the blinking Bluetooth earpiece still in his ear. He hadn‚Äôt heard a word.

A familiar wave of exhaustion washed over her. Every conversation with him ended like this‚Äîutter dismissal.

Like when he came home every night lately, reeking of another woman‚Äôs perfume.

She had asked once, ""Who have you been with?""

Maddox had only replied, ""A friend,"" without even looking at her.

She sometimes wondered if, after five years of marriage, he even remembered her name.

She was done suffocating in this life.

Flipping to the last page of the divorce agreement, she pushed it toward him. ""Sign it. Won‚Äôt take more than a minute.""

Maddox gave her a sharp look but barely skimmed the document before Kayson bounded over.

""Dad, are you and Aunt Arielle playing golf later? I want to come too!""

As Maddox stood, Juliet grabbed his wrist.

""Sign.""

For once, he actually looked at her, surprise flickering in his eyes.

She supposed he wasn‚Äôt used to his obedient wife suddenly growing a backbone.

Kayson tugged at his sleeve. ""Hurry, Dad! If we keep Aunt Arielle waiting, she‚Äôll make you carry her again!""

""Fine.""

Without another glance at the papers, Maddox signed.

Father and son walked away without looking back.

She didn‚Äôt know if his careless signature was blind trust or sheer apathy.

Picking up the pen, she signed beside his name.

The only two times their names would ever stand side by side‚Äîfirst on their marriage certificate, and now here.

A tear splashed onto the page.

She wiped it away quietly before mailing the papers to her lawyer.

Upstairs, she packed her belongings, only to realize her closet was full of clothes she never chose.

No one remembered the Juliet before sixteen‚Äîthe one who loved skydiving, street racing, laughing loud and free.

But after marrying Maddox, she had been molded into the perfect Mrs. Freeman‚Äîgentle, poised, smiling just so.

The Freemans wanted a trophy, not a person.

And even after sacrificing herself, she earned no respect‚Äîonly mockery from Maddox‚Äôs friends.

They called her phony, said Arielle was the better match.

Chapter 2 - Breaking Free from the Gilded Cage

Juliet Alvarez rushed to the bathroom and vomited.

After wiping her mouth, she lifted her face and stared at her reflection in the mirror‚Äîstill flawless, still picture-perfect.

At that moment, she knew with absolute certainty that divorcing him was the right choice.

She refused to suffocate in the gilded cage of being ""Mrs. Freeman.""

She wanted to break free, to finally be herself again.

She dug out an old dress from before her marriage and called her best friend, Amira, to pick her up.

The Freeman estate had never felt like home.

And the Alvarez family? They‚Äôd married her off to Maddox Freeman and then washed their hands of her.

Amira arrived quickly but frowned when she saw Juliet waiting outside.

‚ÄúYou actually have time to hang out? I thought you were spending your birthday with your husband and son‚Äîyou booked that fancy restaurant weeks ago.‚Äù

Juliet froze, then checked her phone.

Sure enough, she had reserved a table and even sent Maddox a reminder about their plans.

He hadn‚Äôt replied.

Did it sting?

Maybe once. But now? She felt nothing.

They drove to the restaurant anyway, but when they arrived and gave the reservation number, the manager awkwardly offered compensation.

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, I‚Äôm afraid the restaurant has been privately booked tonight‚ÄîMr. Freeman reserved it for his wife‚Äôs birthday celebration. We‚Äôll refund you double for the inconvenience.‚Äù

Amira smirked and pulled Juliet forward. ‚ÄúNo refund needed. The ‚ÄòMrs. Freeman‚Äô you‚Äôre looking for is right here.‚Äù

But as they stepped inside, cheerful laughter greeted them.

There, at the center of the room, Maddox and Kayson were celebrating Arielle Wallace‚Äôs birthday.

Maddox raised his glass. ‚ÄúTo your health and happiness.‚Äù

Kayson grinned. ‚ÄúI hope all your wishes come true, Aunt Arielle‚Äîespecially the one where you marry Dad and become my mom.‚Äù

Juliet watched as the three of them sat together, their joy painting the perfect family picture.

Maddox‚Äôs gaze never left Arielle.

Kayson, ever the doting son, pulled out Arielle‚Äôs chair, poured her coffee, even tied up her hair.

Five years of marriage, and Maddox had never once remembered her birthday, let alone celebrated it.

Ten months of pregnancy, nearly dying in childbirth‚Äîand her own son had never so much as handed her a glass of water.

Amira bristled, ready to march over and give them a piece of her mind.

But Juliet stopped her.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt bother,‚Äù she said quietly. ‚ÄúI already signed the divorce papers.‚Äù

Amira immediately took her home. Juliet didn‚Äôt shed a tear‚Äîbut Amira did.

She hugged Juliet tightly, cursing Maddox as a cold-hearted bastard and Kayson as a spoiled brat.

‚ÄúFor five years, you gave them everything‚Äîno career, no friends, nothing for yourself.‚Äù

‚ÄúEvery time I dragged you out for some fun, Maddox would call, and you‚Äôd rush home like a lovesick fool to make him his damn cocktail.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen Kayson was teething, you stayed up night after night, holding him while he screamed.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd this is how they repay you? Juliet, I know you‚Äôre hurting. Just let it out.‚Äù

Juliet took a long swig of whiskey and leaned back on the couch.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Cry?‚Äù

She couldn‚Äôt.

But she had cried before.

When Evangeline Freeman drilled endless etiquette rules into her, and Maddox turned a blind eye to her exhaustion.

When she waited in the snow past midnight for him, only for him to ghost her without a word.

When Kayson spiked a fever in the dead of night, and Maddox hung up on her.

Chapter 3 - Breaking Free from the Cage

But they never saw me.

Five years had passed. I should have moved on by now.

After a night of heavy drinking, I fell into a deep sleep.

Early the next morning, my phone rang‚ÄîMaddox Freeman‚Äôs name flashing on the screen.

His voice was rough with sleep. ""Where‚Äôs the watch I wear on Mondays?""

Muscle memory kicked in. ""Top drawer of the walk-in closet.""

""And the cufflinks that go with it?""

""Second drawer down.""

Only after the exchange did it hit me‚Äîwe were getting divorced.

No more early mornings spent laying out Maddox‚Äôs suits.

No more midnight waits with a bowl of chicken noodle soup warming on the stove.

Had he even noticed I‚Äôd moved out?

I kept my tone polite but distant. ""Have the housekeeper reorganize the closet. She can help you find whatever you need.""

""We‚Äôre finalizing the divorce soon. You shouldn‚Äôt be calling me about these things.""

A pause. Then a noncommittal grunt from Maddox.

Through the phone, I heard a drawer slide open.

I was about to hang up when his voice cut in again.

""Make clam chowder for lunch this week and bring it to my office.""

The line went dead.

Once again, my words about the divorce might as well have been whispers in a hurricane.

How do you explain that feeling?

Like shouting into the void and hearing nothing but your own echo.

My hands shook as I drew a steadying breath.

Without hesitation, I blocked Maddox‚Äôs number.

After a moment, I blocked Kayson‚Äôs kindergarten teacher too.

But I forgot about Evangeline Freeman.

Which was why, when I finally left my apartment for lunch, she intercepted me in her town car.

A stack of photos hit me in the face‚Äîeach one showing Maddox and Arielle Wallace in compromising positions.

""You‚Äôve failed me. I‚Äôve been shaping you since you were sixteen.""

""Juliet Alvarez, ten years, and you still couldn‚Äôt keep your husband‚Äôs interest.""

""Had I known you‚Äôd be this incompetent, I would‚Äôve overlooked Arielle‚Äôs bastard status. She would‚Äôve made a better match for Maddox.""

The photo corners left paper cuts on my neck, tiny beads of blood welling up.

When the Freemans selected me as their future daughter-in-law, the whole city thought I‚Äôd won the lottery.

But at sixteen, I lost my autonomy‚Äîmy entire existence reduced to becoming Mrs. Freeman.

The weight crushed me. In college, I rebelled hard, starting a reckless fling just to provoke Maddox into calling off the engagement.

He never took the bait.

My father shipped me off to finishing school before sunrise the next day.

Though married only five years, I‚Äôd been trapped for a decade. Enough.

I met Evangeline‚Äôs gaze head-on. ""The divorce papers are signed.""

""No alimony. No custody demands. If you‚Äôre dissatisfied, find Maddox a more suitable wife.""

I reached for the door handle.

Evangeline‚Äôs composure cracked. Her manicured claws dug into my wrist like talons.

""Juliet Alvarez, how dare you!""

I turned slowly‚Äîand smiled.

""There‚Äôs nothing I wouldn‚Äôt dare. Being ‚ÄòMrs. Freeman‚Äô was never my dream.""

For the first time, I rolled up my sleeve, revealing the jagged scars mapping my forearm.

Evangeline recoiled from the raised, wormlike marks.

I traced them gently, still smiling.

""Every time I felt caged, I cut myself free.""

""Know what I‚Äôve been screaming in my nightmares for ten years?""

Locking eyes with her, I enunciated every word:

""I was begging... for someone to save me.""

""But now I know‚Äîthe only savior I need is myself.""

""Freedom isn‚Äôt given. It‚Äôs taken.""

Calmly, I opened the door and stepped onto the sidewalk.

Chapter 1 - The Final Breaking Point

Juliet Alvarez had been raised since childhood to become the Freeman family's daughter-in-law.

At twenty, she married Maddox Freeman.

By twenty-two, she gave birth to their son, Kayson.

Kayson took after his father‚Äîquiet, reserved, never seeking her affection.

Last night, for the first time, he approached her on his own: ""Mom, Aunt Arielle is sick and might die. Her wish is to marry Dad. Can you divorce him, please?""

At that moment, she lost all hope for both father and son.

Fine. She would give them what they wanted.

...

At breakfast, she slid the divorce papers across the table to Maddox, laying out her terms.

""I‚Äôve thought about what Kayson said all night. If he loves Arielle that much, then I agree to the divorce.""

""I‚Äôll also give up custody of Kayson and walk away with nothing.""

""The marital assets can be transferred to his name‚Äîconsider it child support.""

Maddox set down his coffee, frowning as he glanced up. ""Were you talking to me just now?""

She noticed the blinking Bluetooth earpiece still in his ear. He hadn‚Äôt heard a word.

A familiar wave of exhaustion washed over her. Every conversation with him ended like this‚Äîutter dismissal.

Like when he came home every night lately, reeking of another woman‚Äôs perfume.

She had asked once, ""Who have you been with?""

Maddox had only replied, ""A friend,"" without even looking at her.

She sometimes wondered if, after five years of marriage, he even remembered her name.

She was done suffocating in this life.

Flipping to the last page of the divorce agreement, she pushed it toward him. ""Sign it. Won‚Äôt take more than a minute.""

Maddox gave her a sharp look but barely skimmed the document before Kayson bounded over.

""Dad, are you and Aunt Arielle playing golf later? I want to come too!""

As Maddox stood, Juliet grabbed his wrist.

""Sign.""

For once, he actually looked at her, surprise flickering in his eyes.

She supposed he wasn‚Äôt used to his obedient wife suddenly growing a backbone.

Kayson tugged at his sleeve. ""Hurry, Dad! If we keep Aunt Arielle waiting, she‚Äôll make you carry her again!""

""Fine.""

Without another glance at the papers, Maddox signed.

Father and son walked away without looking back.

She didn‚Äôt know if his careless signature was blind trust or sheer apathy.

Picking up the pen, she signed beside his name.

The only two times their names would ever stand side by side‚Äîfirst on their marriage certificate, and now here.

A tear splashed onto the page.

She wiped it away quietly before mailing the papers to her lawyer.

Upstairs, she packed her belongings, only to realize her closet was full of clothes she never chose.

No one remembered the Juliet before sixteen‚Äîthe one who loved skydiving, street racing, laughing loud and free.

But after marrying Maddox, she had been molded into the perfect Mrs. Freeman‚Äîgentle, poised, smiling just so.

The Freemans wanted a trophy, not a person.

And even after sacrificing herself, she earned no respect‚Äîonly mockery from Maddox‚Äôs friends.

They called her phony, said Arielle was the better match.

Chapter 2 - Breaking Free from the Gilded Cage

Juliet Alvarez rushed to the bathroom and vomited.

After wiping her mouth, she lifted her face and stared at her reflection in the mirror‚Äîstill flawless, still picture-perfect.

At that moment, she knew with absolute certainty that divorcing him was the right choice.

She refused to suffocate in the gilded cage of being ""Mrs. Freeman.""

She wanted to break free, to finally be herself again.

She dug out an old dress from before her marriage and called her best friend, Amira, to pick her up.

The Freeman estate had never felt like home.

And the Alvarez family? They‚Äôd married her off to Maddox Freeman and then washed their hands of her.

Amira arrived quickly but frowned when she saw Juliet waiting outside.

‚ÄúYou actually have time to hang out? I thought you were spending your birthday with your husband and son‚Äîyou booked that fancy restaurant weeks ago.‚Äù

Juliet froze, then checked her phone.

Sure enough, she had reserved a table and even sent Maddox a reminder about their plans.

He hadn‚Äôt replied.

Did it sting?

Maybe once. But now? She felt nothing.

They drove to the restaurant anyway, but when they arrived and gave the reservation number, the manager awkwardly offered compensation.

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, I‚Äôm afraid the restaurant has been privately booked tonight‚ÄîMr. Freeman reserved it for his wife‚Äôs birthday celebration. We‚Äôll refund you double for the inconvenience.‚Äù

Amira smirked and pulled Juliet forward. ‚ÄúNo refund needed. The ‚ÄòMrs. Freeman‚Äô you‚Äôre looking for is right here.‚Äù

But as they stepped inside, cheerful laughter greeted them.

There, at the center of the room, Maddox and Kayson were celebrating Arielle Wallace‚Äôs birthday.

Maddox raised his glass. ‚ÄúTo your health and happiness.‚Äù

Kayson grinned. ‚ÄúI hope all your wishes come true, Aunt Arielle‚Äîespecially the one where you marry Dad and become my mom.‚Äù

Juliet watched as the three of them sat together, their joy painting the perfect family picture.

Maddox‚Äôs gaze never left Arielle.

Kayson, ever the doting son, pulled out Arielle‚Äôs chair, poured her coffee, even tied up her hair.

Five years of marriage, and Maddox had never once remembered her birthday, let alone celebrated it.

Ten months of pregnancy, nearly dying in childbirth‚Äîand her own son had never so much as handed her a glass of water.

Amira bristled, ready to march over and give them a piece of her mind.

But Juliet stopped her.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt bother,‚Äù she said quietly. ‚ÄúI already signed the divorce papers.‚Äù

Amira immediately took her home. Juliet didn‚Äôt shed a tear‚Äîbut Amira did.

She hugged Juliet tightly, cursing Maddox as a cold-hearted bastard and Kayson as a spoiled brat.

‚ÄúFor five years, you gave them everything‚Äîno career, no friends, nothing for yourself.‚Äù

‚ÄúEvery time I dragged you out for some fun, Maddox would call, and you‚Äôd rush home like a lovesick fool to make him his damn cocktail.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen Kayson was teething, you stayed up night after night, holding him while he screamed.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd this is how they repay you? Juliet, I know you‚Äôre hurting. Just let it out.‚Äù

Juliet took a long swig of whiskey and leaned back on the couch.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Cry?‚Äù

She couldn‚Äôt.

But she had cried before.

When Evangeline Freeman drilled endless etiquette rules into her, and Maddox turned a blind eye to her exhaustion.

When she waited in the snow past midnight for him, only for him to ghost her without a word.

If you like acoustic stuff that sounds like it could‚Äôve been written on a rainy Sunday arvo with too much coffee (or not enough sleep), you might vibe with it.

Chuck me your thoughts. Good, bad, ‚Äúmate this sucks‚Äù it‚Äôs all welcome. Might even play it live if anyone actually likes it.

I got a Breville (UK) Barista Max and after 3 years it has stopped working properly. I have tried to fix it but customer service just gave me a discount instead of solutions. I have had a specialist come and check it and I was billed a bit more than expected so I am looking to sell my Breville for parts and change to Sage.

My research has taken me to two options: Barista Pro and Express Impress. I think I am leaning towards the Barista Pro because it seems to be faster and cheaper to run and overall seems that it's better but unsure about the screen as I don't need it, so I wanted to get people's thoughts first.

After lots of trial and error, I developed this 5-phase framework that has the potential to turn new hires into top performers. 

\------------------------

# 1. Foundation (1-2 weeks before start date)

**Purpose:**¬†Build excitement, remove admin friction, and make the new hire feel part of the team before day one.

* **Personalised welcome message**¬†from their direct manager or CEO (not HR) sharing genuine excitement about their arrival
* **Checks:**¬†Mandatory compliance checks completed early (DBS check in the UK)
* **Complete equipment package**¬†delivered 3-5 days early: laptop, noise-cancelling headphones, ergonomic mouse, ergonomic keyboard, wrist/arm rest, laptop stand, and branded welcome items (notebook, water bottle, or local coffee voucher)
* **Digital welcome pack**¬†containing:
   * Employee handbook with remote work policies
   * System access instructions with temporary credentials
   * Tool download links and installation guides
   * First two weeks‚Äô schedule with clear expectations
   * A communication map,¬†explaining the chain of communication (e.g., who to contact, when to DM or email, and when to use video calls).

**Additional:** 

**Video Introduction:**¬†Send a short video from the team introducing themselves and welcoming the new hire.

# 2. Connection (Days 1-14)

**Purpose:**¬†Help them feel part of the team quickly, close knowledge gaps, and remove first-week barriers.

* **Administrative efficiency:**¬†Complete all HR tasks within the first 2 hours, not spread across days
* **Strategic introductions:**¬†Schedule 30-minute coffee chats with each immediate team member, including their working hours to build awareness
* **Buddy assignment:**¬†Pair them with a peer (not manager) who‚Äôs been with the company 6-18 months and shares similar interests or background
* **Knowledge repository access:**¬†Curate 5-7 essential documents/wikis they need immediately, not everything at once
* **Support system clarity:**¬†Create a simple escalation chart showing who handles what (tech issues ‚Üí IT Slack channel, project questions ‚Üí buddy, urgent matters ‚Üí manager)

# Additional:

**Trivia Session:**¬†Host a ‚Äú*Getting to Know You*‚Äù trivia session where team members answer light, fun questions about themselves ‚Äî this breaks the ice better than just job role summaries.

# 3. Momentum (Weeks 2-3)

¬†**Purpose:**¬†Enable the new hire to deliver meaningful work while ensuring clarity, structure, and support.

* **SMART deliverables:**¬†Define 2-3 specific, measurable tasks with clear success criteria and realistic deadlines
* **Transparent progress tracking:**¬†Use visual project management tools (Asana, Monday, or Trello) where everyone can see task progression
* **Quality standards documentation:**¬†Create ‚ÄúDefinition of Done‚Äù templates showing what excellent work looks like in your organisation
* **Priority framework training:**¬†Teach your company‚Äôs specific prioritisation method (OKRs: setting ambitious goals and tracking progress, RICE scoring: data-driven prioritisation of features or initiatives, or MoSCoW: aligning stakeholders on essential versus optional features) through real examples
* **Ownership mindset:**¬†Assign one small project they can fully own from conception to completion

# Additional:

**Shadow Sessioning:**¬†Schedule 2-hour virtual sessions where new hires observe experienced colleagues handling real work scenarios such as client calls, problem-solving, or strategic planning.

# 4. Integration (Weeks 3-6)

**Purpose:**¬†Establish a cycle of continuous improvement, support, professional development & influence.

* **Role mastery roadmap:**¬†Create a 90-day learning path with specific milestones and competency checks
* **Cross-functional exposure:**¬†Introduction to 2-3 other departments through structured ‚Äúlunch and learns‚Äù
* **Personalised development plan:**¬†Combine role requirements with their career aspirations and learning preferences
* **Remote work optimisation:**¬†Offer coaching on workspace setup, time management techniques, and digital wellness practices
* **Cultural integration:**¬†Share unwritten rules, company traditions, and team dynamics that aren‚Äôt in the handbook

# Additional:

**Reverse Mentoring:**¬†Have new hires share insights from their previous company or industry, positioning them as contributors to organisational learning from week one.

# 5. Evolution (Month 2 onwards)

**Purpose:**¬†Establish a cycle of continuous improvement, support, professional development & influence.

* **Structured check-ins:**¬†Weekly 15-minute progress reviews transitioning to bi-weekly, then monthly strategic development conversations
* **Obstacle elimination:**¬†Proactively identify and remove barriers through regular ‚Äústop, start, continue‚Äù feedback sessions
* **360-degree feedback:**¬†Collect input from peers, stakeholders, and direct reports (if applicable) every quarter
* **Personalised learning ecosystem:**¬†Curate learning paths using platforms like Coursera for Business, MasterClass for Business, or internal knowledge sharing sessions
* **Wellbeing support:**¬†Provide mental health resources, fitness stipends, and encourage work-life integration practices

# Additional:

**Growth Portfolio:**¬†Help each employee build a digital portfolio showcasing their achievements, learnings, and contributions, serving as both motivation and career development tool.

## Key Features Analysis

Hello Mello lounge pants boast several key features designed to enhance your lounging experience.

**Material Composition:**

The most notable aspect of Hello Mello lounge pants is the fabric they are crafted from. These pants are typically made from a blend of polyester and spandex. This combination results in a material that is incredibly soft to the touch, offering a gentle feel against the skin. The polyester provides durability and helps maintain the shape of the pants even after repeated washing, while the spandex adds a necessary element of stretch. This stretch is crucial for allowing freedom of movement and ensuring that the pants adapt comfortably to various body shapes and sizes. The breathability of the fabric,although not as high as natural fibers like cotton,is still adequate for indoor lounging and relaxing.**Elastic Waistband with Drawstring:**

Comfort is paramount in lounge pants, and Hello Mello addresses this through a soft elastic waistband. The wide elastic band sits comfortably on the waist without digging in or causing discomfort. Furthermore, the addition of a drawstring allows for a customizable fit.This feature is especially useful for individuals who prefer a more secure feel or who fluctuate in size. The drawstring is typically made from a durable and soft material that complements the overall comfort of the pants ensuring it doesn't irritate the skin when tied.

**Variety of Prints and colors:**

Hello Mello offers an extensive range of prints and colors, catering to diverse tastes and preferences. From classic solid colors to playful patterns, there's a design to suit every style. This variety allows consumers to express their personality even during moments of relaxation. Weather one prefers vibrant floral patterns or muted geometric designs, Hello Mello provides options for both bold and subtle styles.The prints are typically applied using high-quality printing techniques to ensure that the colors remain vibrant even after multiple wash cycles.

**Relaxed Fit and Tapered Leg:**

The design of Hello Mello lounge pants focuses on a relaxed fit that allows for unrestricted movement. The pants are designed to drape loosely around the legs without feeling baggy or shapeless. The tapered leg adds a touch of style,preventing the pants from looking overly casual or sloppy. This subtle tailoring allows the pants to be worn not only at home but also for casual outings, such as running errands or grabbing coffee. The relaxed fit promotes breathability and prevents the fabric from clinging to the skin, making these pants ideal for warm weather lounging.

**Pockets:**

A practical addition to Hello mello lounge pants is the inclusion of side pockets. These pockets are large enough to hold a phone, keys, or other small essentials. This feature adds a layer of convenience, allowing wearers to move around the house without needing to carry a bag or purse.The placement of the pockets is carefully considered to ensure that they don't add unnecessary bulk or disrupt the overall silhouette of the pants. Reinforced stitching around the pockets enhances their durability and prevents them from tearing or sagging over time.

Husband suddenly dressing differently and constantly on work calls,"My husband (34M) and I (36F) have been married for 8 years with 3 kids. He works in tech from our home office. Our relationship has always been solid. Usually he'd wrap up work by 6 and spend evenings with the family, maybe catch up on some emails after the kids went to bed.

For the past few months, he's been taking these ""urgent client calls"" that go until midnight or later. Like, way past normal business hours. Before this, he was pretty strict about work-life balance and would rarely take calls after 8 PM. When I walk past his office, I can hear him talking in this lower, more animated voice than his usual work tone. The door is always closed now, which never used to happen.

Recently he's also started caring way more about his appearance. New cologne, fitted button-downs instead of his usual polos, and he's been hitting the gym religiously - says it helps him ""focus better for these demanding new projects."" He's even started using some kind of hair product that makes everything smell really strong and expensive.

He's also begun taking these solo coffee runs on weekend mornings, always with his phone, saying he needs to ""mentally prepare for the week ahead."" Usually takes about an hour and comes back with just one coffee - his own.

When I ask about these new work demands, he gets vague about which clients are requiring so much attention and says I ""wouldn't understand the technical aspects anyway."" He's never dismissed my questions about his work before.

Something just feels different about his whole energy lately. I don't want to be controlling or paranoid, but the late-night calls, the sudden interest in looking good, the secretive phone behavior...

Dawn wouldn't break for another hour, but I needed those charity gala files before Ryan woke. Twelve years of marriage had taught me how to move silently through our shared spaces, becoming invisible when necessary. The skill had served me well as Ryan's affairs multiplied from one to ninety-nine.I froze at the sound of laughter from the entryway‚Äîa woman's voice, high and triumphant. My hand trembled on the doorknob as I pushed it open just enough to see through the crack.Ryan stood there, his back to me, his arms wrapped possessively around Ashley Morgan's waist. Her rounded belly pressed against him as he bent to kiss her, his fingers tangling in her glossy blonde hair. The same fingers that hadn't touched me in months.""Welcome home, baby,"" he murmured against her lips. ""Your new home.""Home. The word pierced me like a shard of ice. This penthouse‚Äîthe one I had decorated, maintained, and turned into a sanctuary‚Äîwas now being offered to mistress number ninety-nine.I should have left then. Should have closed the door and disappeared. Instead, I pushed it wider and stepped inside, my presence announcing itself with the soft click of the closing door.Ryan didn't even have the decency to look surprised. He turned, his arm still around Ashley, his expression merely annoyed at the interruption.""Sarah."" My name on his lips sounded like an afterthought. ""I thought you were at the Hamilton fundraiser until noon.""""I needed the donor files,"" I said, my voice steadier than I felt. ""I didn't realize we had... company.""Ashley's red lips curved into a smile that never reached her eyes. ""Not company, Sarah. Family."" Her hand caressed her swollen belly in a deliberate gesture. ""We're going to be a family now.""Ryan guided her toward our living room‚Äîthe space where we had once entertained friends, where I had nursed him through the flu, where he had promised me forever. Now he led his pregnant mistress to my favorite armchair as if I were merely a houseguest overstaying my welcome.I followed them, some masochistic impulse preventing me from fleeing. Ashley settled herself comfortably, reaching for a small shopping bag on the coffee table. The distinctive robin's-egg blue of Tiffany's.""Show Sarah what you got me, Ryan,"" she purred, pulling out a black velvet box.Ryan's eyes flickered to me, then away. Not guilt‚Äîjust irritation at my presence during what should have been their private moment.Ashley opened the box with manicured fingers, revealing a diamond-encrusted lingerie set that sparkled obscenely under our recessed lighting. ""Isn't it divine? For after the baby comes."" Her eyes met mine, cold and calculating. ""Ryan says I'll still be beautiful then. Unlike some women who just... let themselves go.""She ran her gaze over my body‚Äîthe body that had grown gaunt from sleepless nights worrying about Ryan's company in the early years, the body that had been deemed insufficient by the man I had sacrificed everything for.""I need to get something,"" I whispered, turning away from them.I moved through our bedroom into the massive walk-in closet Ryan had installed when his first app went public. My fingers trembled as I pushed aside his tailored suits, reaching for the back corner where my things were increasingly crowded out. There, shrouded in yellowing plastic, hung my wedding dress.I touched it through the plastic, remembering how Ryan had insisted on accompanying me to select it, breaking tradition because he couldn't bear to be separated even for a day. ""It has to be vintage,"" he'd said then, his eyes warm with love. ""Something timeless and elegant. Like you.""Now it hung forgotten, pushed aside for Armani and Brioni, just as I had been pushed aside for younger, newer models of womanhood. In that moment, looking at the physical evidence of what we had once been, something crystallized within me. A resolve that had been forming for years but had never fully solidified until now.That night, after Ryan had taken Ashley to ""their"" new condo‚Äîanother trophy property in his collection‚ÄîI sat in the dark of our bedroom with my laptop. My fingers moved swiftly over the keyboard, transferring funds into accounts he knew nothing about, accounts connected to my family's vineyard in Napa Valley.The place I had abandoned for love. The place that would now become my sanctuary.

Chapter 2The morning light streaming through the kitchen windows was too bright, too cheerful. It mocked me as I stood at the counter, sipping my black coffee and pretending to care about the financial section Ryan was reading. He‚Äôd barely spoken to me since yesterday‚Äôs spectacle, not that I‚Äôd expected him to.‚ÄúUgh,‚Äù Ashley‚Äôs voice cut through the silence, saccharine sweet and edged with feigned distress. ‚ÄúSorry, guys. Morning sickness is the worst.‚ÄùI didn‚Äôt turn. Didn‚Äôt dare. My hands tightened around the mug, the ceramic biting into my palms.‚ÄúBabe,‚Äù Ryan murmured, already sliding into the chair beside her, ‚Äúdo you need some ginger tea? Or crackers? Anything?‚Äù‚ÄúNo, no,‚Äù she waved a hand, her diamond tennis bracelet catching the light. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably just...something I ate.‚ÄùMy spine stiffened. Something she ate.‚ÄúOr maybe,‚Äù she continued, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper, ‚Äúsomeone‚Äôs trying to hurt the baby.‚ÄùThe room tilted. I set my mug down carefully, the thud of ceramic on marble echoing in the sudden silence.‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù Ryan asked, his voice low and dangerous.Ashley‚Äôs eyes met mine, wide and innocent. ‚ÄúI was going to tell you last night, Ry, but I didn‚Äôt want to upset you. Someone‚Äôs been tampering with my prenatal vitamins.‚Äù‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Ryan‚Äôs chair scraped back as he stood, his gaze snapping to mine. ‚ÄúSarah‚Äî‚Äù‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be ridiculous,‚Äù I cut in, my voice steady despite the storm brewing in my chest. ‚ÄúWhy would I‚Äî‚Äù‚ÄúBecause you‚Äôre jealous!‚Äù Ashley cried, her face crumpling into theatrically devastated lines. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre bitter and alone, and you resent the fact that I‚Äôm carrying Ryan‚Äôs child!‚ÄùThe words hit like a physical blow. I opened my mouth, but nothing came out.‚ÄúIs this true?‚Äù Ryan demanded, his eyes blazing with fury. ‚ÄúDid you touch her vitamins?‚Äù‚ÄúOf course not!‚Äù I shot back, my hands curling into fists. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even know where she keeps them!‚Äù‚ÄúLiar!‚Äù Ashley spat, her voice trembling with manufactured outrage. ‚ÄúI saw you snooping around the guest suite yesterday! You‚Äôve always hated me, but this‚Äîthis is a new low, Sarah!‚Äù‚ÄúEnough.‚Äù Ryan‚Äôs voice silenced us both, his tone cold and final. ‚ÄúGet out of my sight, Sarah. Now.‚ÄùI stared at him, my chest heaving. ‚ÄúRyan, I‚Äî‚Äù‚ÄúI said get out!‚Äù he roared, slamming his fist on the table. The sound echoed through the kitchen, making Ashley jump.‚ÄúOkay, okay!‚Äù she soothed, placing a hand on his arm. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt upset yourself, baby. For the sake of our little one.‚ÄùI turned on my heel, my legs trembling as I made my way to the study. The door slammed behind me, the sound reverberating through the penthouse.‚ÄúSarah.‚ÄùI spun, my back pressed to the door as Ryan stormed into the room. His eyes were wild, his jaw clenched tight.‚ÄúWhat the hell do you think you‚Äôre doing?‚Äù he snarled, advancing on me. ‚ÄúEndangering my child? My heir?‚Äù‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt touch her vitamins,‚Äù I whispered, my voice breaking. ‚ÄúYou know me better than that.‚Äù‚ÄúDo I?‚Äù he sneered, stopping inches from my face. His breath was hot against my skin, smelling of coffee and something bitter. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been acting strange for weeks, Sarah. Erratic. Paranoid.‚Äù‚ÄúParanoid?‚Äù I echoed, a hollow laugh escaping me. ‚ÄúYou bring your pregnant mistress into our home, flaunt her in front of me, and I‚Äôm the paranoid one?‚ÄùHis hand shot out, gripping my chin with bruising force. ‚ÄúWatch your tone,‚Äù he growled. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not in a position to lecture me.‚ÄùI met his gaze, searching for a glimmer of the man I‚Äôd married. The man who‚Äôd held me close on our wedding night, promising to love me until death parted us. But all I saw was a stranger‚Äîa cold, calculating narcissist who saw me as nothing more than an inconvenience.‚ÄúGet out of the kitchen,‚Äù he ordered, releasing me with a shove. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want her upset.‚ÄùI stumbled back, my fingers brushing the door handle behind me. ‚ÄúAnd if I refuse?‚Äù‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt,‚Äù he said, his confidence absolute. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve spent twelve years bending over backward to please me. I doubt that‚Äôs going to change now.‚ÄùThe words stung, but not as much as they should have. Something inside me had shifted, like the first crack in a frozen lake.‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right,‚Äù I said softly, my voice barely above a whisper. ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt change.‚ÄùHis smirk faltered, replaced by a flicker of unease. He opened his mouth to say something, but I turned away, walking out of the study and leaving him staring at my back.

Chapter 3I sat on the edge of my bed, staring at the locked door that had once been merely decorative in our marriage. Now it was my only barrier against the accusations swirling through our penthouse. My fingers traced the edge of my phone, contemplating who I could possibly call. After twelve years of putting Ryan first, my own social circle had withered to acquaintances who were really his friends, his business partners, his admirers.A soft knock interrupted my thoughts.""Mrs. Crawford?"" Maria's voice was barely audible through the door.I rose quickly, hope fluttering in my chest. Maria had been with us for over a decade. She'd witnessed the gradual erosion of my marriage, had seen me retreat further into myself with each of Ryan's affairs. If anyone in this household knew the truth of who I was, it would be her.""Maria,"" I said, unlocking the door with trembling fingers. ""Thank God. I need your help to‚Äî""The words died on my lips as I took in her appearance. Maria stood rigid in the hallway, her usually warm brown eyes fixed somewhere over my shoulder. In her hands, she clutched an empty prescription bottle‚ÄîAshley's prenatal vitamins.""Maria?"" I whispered, a chill creeping up my spine.""Mr. Crawford asked me to come,"" she said, her voice unnaturally flat. ""He wants to know if I saw anything... unusual.""Behind her, I could see Ryan standing at the end of the hallway, arms crossed, watching our interaction with cold calculation.""You know I would never do something like that,"" I said, searching her face for any sign of the woman who had once left fresh flowers on my nightstand each morning. ""Maria, please.""She finally met my eyes, and what I saw there made my blood run cold. Not hatred or anger, but something worse‚Äîpity mixed with resolution.""I saw Mrs. Crawford in the kitchen early this morning,"" she said, her voice carrying down the hallway to where Ryan stood. ""She was... doing something with Miss Morgan's vitamins.""The lie hung in the air between us. I stared at her, uncomprehending. This woman who had witnessed my suffering, who had silently supported me through years of humiliation‚Äîshe was betraying me now when I needed her most.""That's not true,"" I whispered, my voice breaking. ""You know that's not true.""Something flickered in Maria's eyes‚Äîregret, perhaps, or shame‚Äîbefore she looked away again. ""I'm sorry, Mrs. Crawford. I know what I saw.""Ryan approached then, placing a proprietary hand on Maria's shoulder. ""Thank you, Maria. You can go now.""She nodded, still avoiding my gaze, and turned to leave. As she walked away, I noticed a slight tremor in her hands, the only indication that her betrayal had cost her anything at all.Ryan's face was a mask of righteous anger as he pushed me back into the bedroom. ""You're staying in here until I figure out what to do with you.""The door slammed shut, the lock clicking into place from the outside.""Ryan!"" I pounded my fists against the solid wood. ""This is insane! You can't just lock me in here!""Silence answered me. I pressed my ear against the door and heard the murmur of voices‚ÄîRyan and Maria. I couldn't make out their words, but the tone was clear: my fate was being decided without me.After what felt like hours but was probably only minutes, I heard Maria's footsteps approaching again. I stepped back from the door, composing myself.""Mrs. Crawford?"" Her voice was softer now, hesitant. ""I've brought you some tea.""The lock turned, and she entered with a tray, her eyes still unable to meet mine.""Why?"" I asked simply.Maria set the tray down with shaking hands. ""Some things are more important than the truth,"" she whispered, so quietly I almost didn't hear her.Before I could respond, she was gone, locking the door behind her.I waited until her footsteps faded, then immediately moved to action. The bedroom door was locked, but Ryan had forgotten about the connecting door to my study‚Äîa room he rarely entered anymore. I slipped through it, my mind racing. I had minutes, perhaps, before someone realized I wasn't where I was supposed to be.In the study, I grabbed my personal laptop and phone, then quietly locked the study door from the inside. My fingers flew across the keyboard, accessing accounts Ryan knew nothing about, making calls to people who owed me, not him. I had been planning my escape for longer than I cared to admit, but now the timeline had accelerated dramatically.As I worked, a bitter realization settled in my chest: Maria's betrayal had severed my last tie to this life. There was nothing left for me here but humiliation and false accusations.It was time to disappear.",1,1755154442.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

1mpt6en,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndianWomen/comments/1mpt6en/i20f_am_burnt_out_due_to_my_problems/,I(20F) am burnt out due to my problems.,"

I am going through a lot of things at once, which are all interconnected. 

I had an extremely rough breakup 5 months ago. I am seeking therapy for that now. I am fine now, but it made me start smoking daily. I have type 1 diabetes. My diet has never been perfect, this affecting my diabetes. Pair my habit of impulsive and binge eating with smoking, I have started to have health issues that didn‚Äôt exist before like nerve related issues, chest pains, stomach discomfort, jaw pain, circulation issues in legs. I have carpal tunnel issues too due to my messed up posture. Holding my phone hurts and my arms feel numb. 

I am in my last year of college. Never did any internships, never developed my skills, I have nothing to add on my CV despite me being aware that I have a lot of potential. It‚Äôs just I have no motivation to do anything anymore. No motivation to effectively manage my diabetes, which included fixing my eating patterns. My routine is messed up. I sleep late and procrastinate sleeping. I am always drinking coffee. I‚Äôve no motivation to work for my career.  I don‚Äôt put any effort in my studies or regularly attend college. Going to college gives me depression. I have no good friends there. My social circle is small but I am very comfortable with them, but I am an extrovert and feel that I should be having more friends, but I hate the prospect where I am getting annoyed by them. 
I am not a productive person, I just want to stay at home, do nothing, be on my phone, do whatever I want to do, avoid difficult tasks and just be comfortable at all times. I know that I am ruining myself but I have no energy or motivation to do something productive for myself. I am a Psychology student and I clearly understand all of this and I am very self aware. I listen and read topics of psychology. I am always trying to improve myself by listening to podcasts, reading books, watching YouTube videos but I never seem to implement all of that knowledge in my daily life.

1mpt5td,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mpt5td/every_night_when_i_fall_asleep_i_die/,"Every night when I fall asleep, I die.","It started without warning.  
No trauma or sickness. No bargain struck in a desperate moment. One night, I simply closed my eyes in bed and woke somewhere that wasn‚Äôt my room. Since then, it has happened every single night.

I don‚Äôt dream anymore. Sleep isn‚Äôt a slow drift into warmth or a dark embrace. It‚Äôs a violent extraction. The moment my head sinks into the pillow, I feel it. Something inside me tears free, like my bones are being wrenched from my flesh but without the mercy of unconsciousness. My chest convulses as though someone is reaching in and scooping out everything that makes me me. There‚Äôs a sound that comes with it too, but it‚Äôs not a sound you hear with your ears. It‚Äôs a tearing scream that comes from inside your skull. My whole body is left behind in bed, still and useless, while whatever is left of my mind gets pulled into the dark.

That‚Äôs where I see him.

Death.

At least, that's who I assume he is. No other explanation would make sense. He is shaped like a man, but he‚Äôs too tall. His head always bends forward slightly, as if the ceiling of the world itself is pressing down on him. His body isn‚Äôt shadow. It‚Äôs the absence of anything alive or warm. Looking at him feels like looking into the moment before the universe was born. His form ripples and shifts with things I can‚Äôt describe without sounding insane. There are swirls of smoke that move like galaxies, sparks like newborn stars flashing into existence before dying in cold silence. The edges of him blur and sharpen in a rhythm I can‚Äôt follow, like he is both here and somewhere infinitely far away.

He doesn‚Äôt speak. He just walks. And I have no choice but to follow.

The place he leads me to is never the same. Sometimes it‚Äôs a ruined city where the wind carries voices I almost recognize. Sometimes it‚Äôs an endless plain of bone-white dust beneath a black sky. Sometimes it‚Äôs somewhere worse, somewhere that feels like it‚Äôs looking back at me.

I remember every single one of them, writing them all down. But the following entries I‚Äôve written down are the ones that mattered most. I‚Äôll number them by which night it was in order. How many times I‚Äôve walked in Purgatory with Death.

(1.)

The first time it happened, I didn‚Äôt understand where I was. I thought I was in a dream if not for the crystal clearness of everything I was experiencing.

I woke standing on something that looked like glass. Not smooth glass, but thick panes that had cracked in jagged webs. Through the gaps beneath my feet, I could see what looked like an ocean turned upside down, suspended above nothing. It churned without sound. Waves rolled over one another and then folded inward into spirals that sank into black holes. Every so often, something moved beneath the water. I only caught glimpses, but they were large enough to darken entire stretches of the sea at once.

Death stood beside me. He was watching the horizon, though there was no sun, no moon, and no sky. Just a band of pale light in the distance, like dawn frozen in place. ‚ÄúWhere are we?‚Äù I asked.

He didn‚Äôt answer.

The glass stretched endlessly in all directions, broken by holes where entire sections had fallen away into the void. Far off, I saw the twisted remains of buildings balanced at impossible angles. Some leaned so far they seemed on the verge of falling into the abyss, yet they never moved.

We started walking. My footsteps made no sound, but the glass trembled faintly under my weight. Death never looked at me.

‚ÄúWhat is this place?‚Äù I asked again. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs happening to me?‚Äù

This time he slowly raised his arm and pointed toward the horizon. I didn‚Äôt see anything there but that pale strip of light, yet the moment he pointed, a cold pressure began to build in my skull.

After a long stretch of walking, I noticed shapes moving at the edges of the broken glass paths. At first I thought they were people, but they were too thin. Their bodies swayed like they were made of cloth filled with water. They had faces, but not the way humans do. Their eyes were just pits, their mouths narrow slits that didn‚Äôt open. None of them made a sound.

One came close enough for me to see its skin. It was translucent, like the thin membrane of an egg. Something writhed beneath it, pressing out against the surface as if it was trying to escape.

‚ÄúWhat are those?‚Äù I whispered.

He didn‚Äôt respond. He didn‚Äôt even look. He just kept walking, and I had no choice but to follow.

We reached the edge of the glass path where it broke into shards. Below was nothing but the upside-down ocean, stretching into forever. Death stopped there. He didn‚Äôt point this time. He just stood, looking down, and I felt something in my chest begin to pull. The pressure grew until I couldn‚Äôt breathe, and then, just like that, I was back in my bed.

It was morning. My body was drenched in sweat. But the taste in my mouth was the strangest part. Salt water.

¬†

(3.)

I woke standing on a road the color of burnt bone. The dirt was fine and dry, yet it seemed to cling to itself in a way that reminded me of ash mixed with oil. When I shifted my feet, it did not scatter like normal soil. Instead, it crumbled apart in sticky, slow-moving clumps, almost reluctant to be disturbed.

The air was heavy. Not just thick, but oppressive, as if something unseen was pressing down on my lungs and ribs. Each breath felt like drawing in lukewarm water that left a faint metallic taste on my tongue. It was quiet here, so quiet that I could hear the faint grind of my teeth when I clenched my jaw.

The road stretched ahead and behind in a perfectly straight line, dividing an endless expanse of black grass. The blades were long and thin, swaying even though the air around them was completely still. They shimmered faintly, as if absorbing the faintest glimmers of light from somewhere I could not see. When I looked closely, I thought I saw tiny motes drifting upward from their tips, vanishing before they reached my knees.

Above was a sky that made my head ache. At first glance it was dark, but not the kind of darkness you get from night. It was deep, layered, constantly folding in on itself. Shapes formed in that shifting void, swirling spirals, jagged arcs, patterns like constellations that almost made sense before collapsing into something alien. The folds of the sky moved in slow, deliberate motions, like the world above me was a living thing breathing in long intervals. Sometimes the stars that flickered between those folds appeared to be arranged in human shapes, sometimes in geometric patterns, and sometimes in things I did not have words for. The longer I stared, the more I felt my thoughts slipping sideways.

Death walked ahead of me, his form swallowing every bit of light from the road. The absence that made up his body seemed to drink in the sky‚Äôs shifting light, making the galaxies inside him burn brighter for brief moments before winking out. He did not look back, but I could feel the pull of his presence guiding me forward.

We had been walking for what felt like hours when I saw them.

Off to the right, far from the road, stood a lone tree. Its branches were bone-white and bare, each one curling upward in a way that made it look like a frozen scream. Beneath it huddled a group of figures. They were moving, but not toward us. Even from a distance I could tell something was wrong. Their bodies were red and wet, strips of flesh hanging loose like clothing torn to shreds. Their faces were exposed muscle and sinew, and they clawed at themselves with hands slick with blood. Each motion tore more of their own tissue away. They made no screams, only low, constant moans that seemed to sink into the air like smoke into cloth.

I stopped in the road and stared.

‚ÄúWhat are they?‚Äù I asked.

Death did not respond.

One of the figures lurched, its head twisting unnaturally far in my direction. There were no eyes, just dark, hollow sockets that glistened faintly. The mouth opened and shut, but the moaning did not match the movement. It was as if the sound was leaking from the air itself.

Something pulled at me. Not physically, but in a way that made my chest feel tight, as though the tree itself was drawing me toward it. Without realizing it, I stepped off the dirt road, my foot sinking slightly into the black grass.

The second my shoe touched the blades, an arm like a wall of darkness moved in front of me.

I froze.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I asked.

Death turned his head toward me, his gaze sinking into my mind like a cold current. His voice, when it came, was low and hollow, vibrating through my bones rather than my ears.

‚ÄúThey are not for you.‚Äù

I looked back toward the tree. The flayed figures had stopped clawing themselves and now stood still, all of them facing me. Even without eyes, I could feel them watching. The black grass seemed to twitch beneath my feet.

I wanted to ask more, but the pressure began building in my chest again, sudden, sharp, and inescapable. The tree, the grass, the figures blurred into one smudge of black and red as my vision tunneled.

Then I was in my bed.

My sheets were damp with sweat. When I swallowed, my throat burned as if I had been screaming for hours. I think I had been.

(7.)

This time, I woke standing in water.

It was shallow, only a few inches deep, but it stretched forever in every direction. The surface was perfectly smooth, and every step I took sent ripples racing outward until they faded into the horizon. There was no wind, no sound of waves, just the constant, delicate slap of water against my ankles as I moved. The ground beneath was solid, but I could not see it through the endless, mirrored expanse.

Above me was an ocean.

Not clouds, not a sky, but an actual ocean suspended overhead. The water churned and twisted far above my head, lit by shifting streaks of sunlight that seemed to come from nowhere. I could see shapes moving in that vast ceiling of water. Some were long, gliding in serpentine motions, their bodies too large to measure. Others drifted lazily, their bodies bulbous and fringed with translucent tendrils that pulsed faintly like they were breathing. Now and then, something enormous would pass overhead and block out all the light for a moment, and I would see only a silhouette so strange I could not begin to put words to it.

Death was beside me, walking through the shallow water without leaving any ripples at all.

‚ÄúWhy is this happening to me?‚Äù I asked him.

He didn‚Äôt answer. His head tilted slightly toward the distance, but he kept moving.

I tried again. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not going to tell me, then I guess I‚Äôll just talk to myself.‚Äù

And I did.

I talked about how many nights it had been. How my waking hours were starting to feel more like the dream. How I‚Äôd stopped telling anyone about my nights because no one could understand. I talked about the places he‚Äôd taken me, the things I‚Äôd seen, and the growing suspicion that there was a reason for all of it. My voice felt too loud in the stillness, and yet Death didn‚Äôt seem to mind.

We walked like that for what felt like hours. The water was cold, but it never got any deeper. The horizon never changed. The creatures above us swam on, unaware or uncaring that we were beneath them.

Then I saw something on the horizon.

At first it looked like a dark smudge moving slowly toward us. As it grew closer, I realized it was a ship. A massive, weather-beaten galleon, the kind I‚Äôd only seen in history books, floating upside down in the ocean above us.

No, not upside down. The ‚Äúsky‚Äù water didn‚Äôt have an up or down. It just was.

The ship was from another time, its wood blackened and rotting, its sails torn into long, fluttering ribbons. Large sections of its hull were missing, exposing broken ribs of timber. It should have been sinking, but instead it glided forward like it was caught on an unseen current.

I thought at first it was dragging a normal anchor.

It wasn‚Äôt.

Beneath it, tethered to a massive chain of rusted iron links, was a cluster of human bodies. Dozens of them, maybe more. They were alive, their chests rising and falling in slow, labored breaths. Each one was bound to the chain by their necks, their wrists, their ankles, so tightly that the iron had cut deep into their flesh. Their skin was pale and waterlogged, their eyes open but empty, gazing at nothing as they were pulled along.

The chain dragged them across the shallow water, scraping their bodies over whatever lay beneath. I could see some of them twitch when they hit something sharp, but none of them screamed. The ship passed directly overhead, the chain rattling faintly as it went on. It did not speed up. It did not slow down.

We stood there and watched it move past us, the trail of bodies stretching behind like a grotesque comet tail.

I don‚Äôt know how long we watched it. It might still be moving somewhere out there, dragging those bodies until there‚Äôs nothing left of them to drag.

Death turned and kept walking, and I followed. I didn‚Äôt talk anymore after that.

¬†

(13.)

Something is wrong with me.

It‚Äôs been creeping in over the last week, but today was the worst. I‚Äôve been tired before, long shifts, bad sleep, but this is different. My body feels hollow, like I‚Äôve been hollowed out with a dull spoon. My legs shake when I stand too long. My hands cramp when I try to write.

I barely made it halfway through work today before my boss stopped me in the hallway. She didn‚Äôt even ask if I was okay. She just said I looked pale and sick, and that I should go home before I dropped dead in the lobby.

I‚Äôve had three nosebleeds in the past two days. I almost never get them, maybe once every few years. The last one came out of nowhere while I was making coffee, and the taste of iron wouldn‚Äôt leave my mouth for hours.

I‚Äôm starting to wonder if these nights with Death are bleeding into the days. If some part of me is actually dying, piece by piece.

When I fell asleep tonight, the pull came faster than usual.

The place I woke in was open. Not like a field, not like a plain, but an expanse so vast that I couldn‚Äôt even tell where the ground ended and the horizon began. The surface beneath my feet was black stone, fractured in spiderweb patterns, each crack faintly glowing with dim blue light. Above us, the sky was filled with slow-moving clouds that glowed from within, like storm fronts lit by distant lightning.

Death stood a few steps ahead, already walking.

I caught up to him quickly. ‚ÄúIs there a reason you keep showing me all of this?‚Äù I asked.

He didn‚Äôt look at me, but he nodded once.

That answer was worse than silence. It confirmed something I‚Äôd been afraid to admit to myself. There is a purpose.

‚ÄúWhat is it then?‚Äù I pressed. ‚ÄúWhy me? Why these places? What am I supposed to do with any of this?‚Äù

His head turned slightly, and when he spoke, his voice was the low rumble of distant thunder.

‚ÄúIt is not yet time for you to know.‚Äù

The heat in my chest was sudden. I was tired, tired of waking in strange worlds, tired of walking without answers, tired of feeling weaker each day.

‚ÄúOf course it‚Äôs not time,‚Äù I muttered, my voice sharper than I meant it to be. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs never time, is it?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt reply.

I stopped asking questions.

We walked on in silence for the rest of the night. The cracks in the stone seemed to pulse faintly with each step we took, like the ground itself had a heartbeat. Somewhere far off, I could hear what sounded like water dripping into an endless pit.

When the pressure in my chest returned, I let it take me without fighting it.

Back in my bed, my nose was bleeding again.

¬†

(19.)

My body is failing me faster than I can keep track of.

I am exhausted all the time. My legs feel like they might buckle under the smallest weight. My hands cramp just lifting a pen. My vision flickers, and sometimes I see things that I know aren‚Äôt there, yet they feel solid. I could have sworn the mailman was missing his eyes today, standing at my doorstep with nothing behind his lids.

The worlds I walk through at night are seeping into my days. Shadows move across the walls where there should be none. Faces appear in reflections, and I catch them only for a moment before they vanish. My nosebleeds have become relentless, coming every couple of hours, each one leaving the taste of iron thick in my mouth.

I went to bed tonight determined to confront Death. I refused to move until he answered some questions.

We arrived in the blackened plains without sound, but this time he did not walk. For the first time, he stopped, standing motionless and waiting. I could feel the pull of the landscape, but I did not move.

‚ÄúWhy are you showing me all of this?‚Äù I asked, my voice steadier than I felt.

His head tilted toward me. When he spoke, the words were slow, deliberate, and impossibly calm.

‚ÄúTo prepare you.‚Äù

I frowned, pressing further. ‚ÄúFor what?‚Äù

He said nothing. He only stood there, impossibly still, his form swallowing light around him. The answer was implied, clear, and yet I dared not say it aloud.

I swallowed hard and tried another question. ‚ÄúWhy is my body getting worse in the real world? Why am I falling apart?‚Äù

He remained silent. Not a nod, not a gesture, only the weight of his presence. The answer again was implied, as if my own failing body and these walks were connected in ways I could not fully comprehend.

I exhaled slowly, letting the tension drain out of me. My chest ached, my muscles trembled, and my head throbbed, but I understood enough.

I walked with him.

We moved through the dark plains together. The windless air pressed against me. The ground beneath our feet was cracked and uneven, pulsing faintly with an inner glow. I spoke occasionally, but only to fill the silence, knowing he would not answer.

And yet, even without his words, I felt it. The reason, the purpose, the inevitability. Each step with him is shaping me, marking me, preparing me for something I cannot name. I do not want to know yet, but part of me knows I already do.

When I awoke, my body felt worse than ever. My nose had bled again. My muscles ached. My vision wavered. And still, I cannot stop.

¬†

(25?)

I don‚Äôt know what day it is anymore. The hours of sunlight blur into one another, and the nights follow the same pattern, slipping past me in shapes I can barely name. At first, I could remember every night clearly, because each one was unique, strange, terrifying in its own way. But now, I have seen all manner of things, horrifying, beautiful, impossible, and the memories overlap like wet paint running together. I am not even sure if this is the twenty-fifth night, or if I have been walking longer than that.

My body continues to fail me. Each day is heavier, each step slower. My vision flickers constantly, and the hallucinations that haunt me when I am awake have grown sharper, more frequent, more detailed. They are not random anymore. I recognize them for what they are: the fates I have witnessed on the walks.

I see glimpses of them everywhere. Faces twisted by pain, bodies suspended in impossible ways, signs of punishments that do not belong to this world. Flayed skin hanging from skeletal frames, limbs bent backward until they snap but never stop. People drowning in shallow pools of water that never stop rising, gasping endlessly as the water fills their mouths, noses, eyes. Bound to red-hot iron cages that sear without ever cooling, screaming silently for eternity. Hung by man-sized fish hooks through the neck and dangling with others like wind chimes, swaying with an invisible breeze. Bodies sewn together into grotesque patchwork, forming moving walls of flesh. Limbs twisted into knots that defy anatomy, faces pressed flat against stone as if to memorize their own torment.

I have begun to feel something I never expected. I can almost see it. Not in full, not with certainty, but I can glimpse the shape of someone‚Äôs fate before they reach Purgatory. The curve of a spine, the tension in their hands, the way they breathe, it all hints at what awaits. I see it in brief flashes, in moments when the world is quiet and the shadows press closer. It terrifies me more than the walks themselves because it is mine, too, and there is no one to guide me through it.

I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can last like this. My body weakens every day. My nose bleeds without warning, my muscles cramp at the smallest effort, and my mind is fraying at the edges. Yet I still walk. I still follow him, even though I know that the horrors I see are only the beginning, and the ones that await are worse than I can name.

Every night brings more. Every night I see more of what lies beyond. I am learning the patterns, the inevitabilities, and with each step, I understand that Purgatory is not only a place. It is a truth, and one day it will catch me fully.

¬†

(??.)

I can barely remember how long I have been walking. Time stretches thin, bending around me like a fragile pane of glass, and the days and nights are one long, continuous motion of shadow and silence. My body is failing faster now. Every movement makes my head and chest ache.

We walked for hours without a word. The ground beneath us was uneven, blackened stone that seemed to pulse faintly with a light of its own. The air pressed close, heavy with the smell of wet iron and ash.

Finally, I could not hold back the question. ‚ÄúAm I going to die?‚Äù I asked.

Death stopped, which is rare. He does not often pause, but now he did, turning his impossible form toward me. His voice, low and hollow, rolled through the stillness.

‚ÄúPerhaps. Someday.‚Äù

I swallowed, my throat dry, and whispered, ‚ÄúI imagine it will be soon, with how fast my body is declining.‚Äù

He did not answer. I forced myself to ask another question, even though I could feel the weight of his presence pressing down harder with each word.

‚ÄúDo I really see it? Can I see people‚Äôs fates in the real world, like it feels like I can?‚Äù

For a long moment, he said nothing. The stillness stretched between us, the black stone and shadow pressing against my chest. Then, finally, in a single word that cut through me like ice, he spoke:

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

The word echoed in my mind, settling deep in a place I cannot reach. My stomach twisted. My hands clenched at my sides. It was not just a confirmation. It was a warning.

I wanted to say more, to ask what it meant, but I could not. I swallowed and followed him, each step heavier than the last, the silence now full of an understanding I did not want, yet could not escape.

¬†

(The last night.)

I do not know how many nights it has been. I do not know if the days even exist anymore. Every moment of my life feels like part of the same endless walk, and the nights have begun to feel like the only reality I can trust.

Tonight was different.

For the first time, I had a full conversation with Death. Not a nod, not a wordless gesture, not a cryptic answer. A conversation. I asked him, again, why this is happening. Why I am being shown all these things, why my body is breaking down, why my mind is fraying with every passing day.

He did not answer with words at first. Instead, he pointed ahead. I followed him across cracked black stone that pulsed faintly beneath our feet, until we reached the edge of a pit.

It was impossible. The darkness yawned below us like an ocean with no bottom. I could not see the end, and my mind struggled to comprehend the depth. Even the air around it seemed heavier, drawn downward as if the pit were pulling the world into itself.

‚ÄúThis is what you have been walking towards,‚Äù Death said.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I asked, my voice shaking.

‚ÄúYou will find out soon,‚Äù he replied.

I stood at the edge of the pit, my chest tight, the blackness below endless.

‚ÄúWhy did you lead me here?‚Äù I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

Death turned to me, his impossible form shifting with the depth of darkness and stars within him. For a moment, I felt as if he was looking not at my face, but straight into my eyes, into the core of me.

‚ÄúIt was your choice to follow,‚Äù he said, his voice low and certain. ‚ÄúI am simply the guide.‚Äù

I swallowed hard, staring down into the void. My legs trembled. The weight of inevitability pressed on me. There was no arguing, no bargaining, only the truth of what I had chosen, knowingly or not, and the path that lay before me.

I looked into the unending void, my stomach twisting. ‚ÄúWhat happens if I fall?‚Äù

He tilted his head, a movement that seemed impossibly slow and deliberate. His body radiated nothing but emptiness and stars, a universe contained in black. ‚ÄúYou will not fall,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBecause you will step in.‚Äù

I swallowed hard. My hands were trembling. My chest ached. The pull of the pit was stronger than anything I have felt, a pressure that threatened to drag me into itself even before I moved. And yet, I knew he spoke the truth. I would not fall. I would step.

I do not know what waits at the bottom. I do not know if I will survive what comes next, or if I will be changed beyond recognition. But I know I will step.

And then, perhaps, I will finally understand.

Even as I write this, I can feel it. My fingers are growing cold with the touch of death, the weight of him pressing into me through the screen, the keyboard, through the air around me. I write not because I think it will save me, not because I can fight what is coming, but because I need someone, anyone, to know. To know that this exists, that it waits, that I have seen it.

All day I have seen him. Not in dreams, not in walks through impossible lands, but here, in the waking world. Just out of reach, always near, waiting. I cannot close my eyes without seeing the shadow of him sliding across the corners of rooms, leaning over strangers, brushing past passersby in silence. It is not that they cannot see him. It is that he does not allow them to see, only me.

I have been seeing the fates of others for weeks now. I can glimpse them in the twitch of a hand, the curve of a spine, the way someone breathes, and it chills me to know what waits for them. But when I look at myself, there is nothing I can measure, no form I can define. Only infinite dark. Beautiful, impossible dark filled with swirling infinities of new and dying stars, galaxies of smoke and shadow birthing and dying within themselves. A universe contained in a single absence of light, and it is me.

I know tonight I will step into the pit. I know it as surely as I know that the air presses heavier on my chest, that my legs shake beneath me, that my body is failing. This is not a choice. It is inevitability.

I do not know what awaits at the bottom, but I know it will be the answer. I know that what comes next will be the culmination of every walk, every sight, every whisper of Death in the dark. And still, I am not afraid, not fully. There is a strange comfort in knowing the shape of what is to come, in knowing that I will finally see it.

Tonight, I will step.

And perhaps, after that, there will be silence.

No trauma or sickness. No bargain struck in a desperate moment. One night, I simply closed my eyes in bed and woke somewhere that wasn‚Äôt my room. Since then, it has happened every single night.

I don‚Äôt dream anymore. Sleep isn‚Äôt a slow drift into warmth or a dark embrace. It‚Äôs a violent extraction. The moment my head sinks into the pillow, I feel it. Something inside me tears free, like my bones are being wrenched from my flesh but without the mercy of unconsciousness. My chest convulses as though someone is reaching in and scooping out everything that makes me me. There‚Äôs a sound that comes with it too, but it‚Äôs not a sound you hear with your ears. It‚Äôs a tearing scream that comes from inside your skull. My whole body is left behind in bed, still and useless, while whatever is left of my mind gets pulled into the dark.

That‚Äôs where I see him.

Death.

At least, that's who I assume he is. No other explanation would make sense. He is shaped like a man, but he‚Äôs too tall. His head always bends forward slightly, as if the ceiling of the world itself is pressing down on him. His body isn‚Äôt shadow. It‚Äôs the absence of anything alive or warm. Looking at him feels like looking into the moment before the universe was born. His form ripples and shifts with things I can‚Äôt describe without sounding insane. There are swirls of smoke that move like galaxies, sparks like newborn stars flashing into existence before dying in cold silence. The edges of him blur and sharpen in a rhythm I can‚Äôt follow, like he is both here and somewhere infinitely far away.

He doesn‚Äôt speak. He just walks. And I have no choice but to follow.

The place he leads me to is never the same. Sometimes it‚Äôs a ruined city where the wind carries voices I almost recognize. Sometimes it‚Äôs an endless plain of bone-white dust beneath a black sky. Sometimes it‚Äôs somewhere worse, somewhere that feels like it‚Äôs looking back at me.

I remember every single one of them, writing them all down. But the following entries I‚Äôve written down are the ones that mattered most. I‚Äôll number them by which night it was in order. How many times I‚Äôve walked in Purgatory with Death.

(1.)

The first time it happened, I didn‚Äôt understand where I was. I thought I was in a dream if not for the crystal clearness of everything I was experiencing.

I woke standing on something that looked like glass. Not smooth glass, but thick panes that had cracked in jagged webs. Through the gaps beneath my feet, I could see what looked like an ocean turned upside down, suspended above nothing. It churned without sound. Waves rolled over one another and then folded inward into spirals that sank into black holes. Every so often, something moved beneath the water. I only caught glimpses, but they were large enough to darken entire stretches of the sea at once.

Death stood beside me. He was watching the horizon, though there was no sun, no moon, and no sky. Just a band of pale light in the distance, like dawn frozen in place. ‚ÄúWhere are we?‚Äù I asked.

He didn‚Äôt answer.

The glass stretched endlessly in all directions, broken by holes where entire sections had fallen away into the void. Far off, I saw the twisted remains of buildings balanced at impossible angles. Some leaned so far they seemed on the verge of falling into the abyss, yet they never moved.

We started walking. My footsteps made no sound, but the glass trembled faintly under my weight. Death never looked at me.

‚ÄúWhat is this place?‚Äù I asked again. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs happening to me?‚Äù

This time he slowly raised his arm and pointed toward the horizon. I didn‚Äôt see anything there but that pale strip of light, yet the moment he pointed, a cold pressure began to build in my skull.

After a long stretch of walking, I noticed shapes moving at the edges of the broken glass paths. At first I thought they were people, but they were too thin. Their bodies swayed like they were made of cloth filled with water. They had faces, but not the way humans do. Their eyes were just pits, their mouths narrow slits that didn‚Äôt open. None of them made a sound.

One came close enough for me to see its skin. It was translucent, like the thin membrane of an egg. Something writhed beneath it, pressing out against the surface as if it was trying to escape.

‚ÄúWhat are those?‚Äù I whispered.

He didn‚Äôt respond. He didn‚Äôt even look. He just kept walking, and I had no choice but to follow.

We reached the edge of the glass path where it broke into shards. Below was nothing but the upside-down ocean, stretching into forever. Death stopped there. He didn‚Äôt point this time. He just stood, looking down, and I felt something in my chest begin to pull. The pressure grew until I couldn‚Äôt breathe, and then, just like that, I was back in my bed.

It was morning. My body was drenched in sweat. But the taste in my mouth was the strangest part. Salt water.

¬†

(3.)

I woke standing on a road the color of burnt bone. The dirt was fine and dry, yet it seemed to cling to itself in a way that reminded me of ash mixed with oil. When I shifted my feet, it did not scatter like normal soil. Instead, it crumbled apart in sticky, slow-moving clumps, almost reluctant to be disturbed.

The air was heavy. Not just thick, but oppressive, as if something unseen was pressing down on my lungs and ribs. Each breath felt like drawing in lukewarm water that left a faint metallic taste on my tongue. It was quiet here, so quiet that I could hear the faint grind of my teeth when I clenched my jaw.

The road stretched ahead and behind in a perfectly straight line, dividing an endless expanse of black grass. The blades were long and thin, swaying even though the air around them was completely still. They shimmered faintly, as if absorbing the faintest glimmers of light from somewhere I could not see. When I looked closely, I thought I saw tiny motes drifting upward from their tips, vanishing before they reached my knees.

Above was a sky that made my head ache. At first glance it was dark, but not the kind of darkness you get from night. It was deep, layered, constantly folding in on itself. Shapes formed in that shifting void, swirling spirals, jagged arcs, patterns like constellations that almost made sense before collapsing into something alien. The folds of the sky moved in slow, deliberate motions, like the world above me was a living thing breathing in long intervals. Sometimes the stars that flickered between those folds appeared to be arranged in human shapes, sometimes in geometric patterns, and sometimes in things I did not have words for. The longer I stared, the more I felt my thoughts slipping sideways.

Death walked ahead of me, his form swallowing every bit of light from the road. The absence that made up his body seemed to drink in the sky‚Äôs shifting light, making the galaxies inside him burn brighter for brief moments before winking out. He did not look back, but I could feel the pull of his presence guiding me forward.

We had been walking for what felt like hours when I saw them.

Off to the right, far from the road, stood a lone tree. Its branches were bone-white and bare, each one curling upward in a way that made it look like a frozen scream. Beneath it huddled a group of figures. They were moving, but not toward us. Even from a distance I could tell something was wrong. Their bodies were red and wet, strips of flesh hanging loose like clothing torn to shreds. Their faces were exposed muscle and sinew, and they clawed at themselves with hands slick with blood. Each motion tore more of their own tissue away. They made no screams, only low, constant moans that seemed to sink into the air like smoke into cloth.

I stopped in the road and stared.

‚ÄúWhat are they?‚Äù I asked.

Death did not respond.

One of the figures lurched, its head twisting unnaturally far in my direction. There were no eyes, just dark, hollow sockets that glistened faintly. The mouth opened and shut, but the moaning did not match the movement. It was as if the sound was leaking from the air itself.

Something pulled at me. Not physically, but in a way that made my chest feel tight, as though the tree itself was drawing me toward it. Without realizing it, I stepped off the dirt road, my foot sinking slightly into the black grass.

The second my shoe touched the blades, an arm like a wall of darkness moved in front of me.

I froze.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I asked.

Death turned his head toward me, his gaze sinking into my mind like a cold current. His voice, when it came, was low and hollow, vibrating through my bones rather than my ears.

‚ÄúThey are not for you.‚Äù

I looked back toward the tree. The flayed figures had stopped clawing themselves and now stood still, all of them facing me. Even without eyes, I could feel them watching. The black grass seemed to twitch beneath my feet.

I wanted to ask more, but the pressure began building in my chest again, sudden, sharp, and inescapable. The tree, the grass, the figures blurred into one smudge of black and red as my vision tunneled.

Then I was in my bed.

My sheets were damp with sweat. When I swallowed, my throat burned as if I had been screaming for hours. I think I had been.

¬†

(7.)

This time, I woke standing in water.

It was shallow, only a few inches deep, but it stretched forever in every direction. The surface was perfectly smooth, and every step I took sent ripples racing outward until they faded into the horizon. There was no wind, no sound of waves, just the constant, delicate slap of water against my ankles as I moved. The ground beneath was solid, but I could not see it through the endless, mirrored expanse.

Above me was an ocean.

Not clouds, not a sky, but an actual ocean suspended overhead. The water churned and twisted far above my head, lit by shifting streaks of sunlight that seemed to come from nowhere. I could see shapes moving in that vast ceiling of water. Some were long, gliding in serpentine motions, their bodies too large to measure. Others drifted lazily, their bodies bulbous and fringed with translucent tendrils that pulsed faintly like they were breathing. Now and then, something enormous would pass overhead and block out all the light for a moment, and I would see only a silhouette so strange I could not begin to put words to it.

Death was beside me, walking through the shallow water without leaving any ripples at all.

‚ÄúWhy is this happening to me?‚Äù I asked him.

He didn‚Äôt answer. His head tilted slightly toward the distance, but he kept moving.

I tried again. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not going to tell me, then I guess I‚Äôll just talk to myself.‚Äù

And I did.

I talked about how many nights it had been. How my waking hours were starting to feel more like the dream. How I‚Äôd stopped telling anyone about my nights because no one could understand. I talked about the places he‚Äôd taken me, the things I‚Äôd seen, and the growing suspicion that there was a reason for all of it. My voice felt too loud in the stillness, and yet Death didn‚Äôt seem to mind.

We walked like that for what felt like hours. The water was cold, but it never got any deeper. The horizon never changed. The creatures above us swam on, unaware or uncaring that we were beneath them.

Then I saw something on the horizon.

At first it looked like a dark smudge moving slowly toward us. As it grew closer, I realized it was a ship. A massive, weather-beaten galleon, the kind I‚Äôd only seen in history books, floating upside down in the ocean above us.

No, not upside down. The ‚Äúsky‚Äù water didn‚Äôt have an up or down. It just was.

The ship was from another time, its wood blackened and rotting, its sails torn into long, fluttering ribbons. Large sections of its hull were missing, exposing broken ribs of timber. It should have been sinking, but instead it glided forward like it was caught on an unseen current.

I thought at first it was dragging a normal anchor.

It wasn‚Äôt.

Beneath it, tethered to a massive chain of rusted iron links, was a cluster of human bodies. Dozens of them, maybe more. They were alive, their chests rising and falling in slow, labored breaths. Each one was bound to the chain by their necks, their wrists, their ankles, so tightly that the iron had cut deep into their flesh. Their skin was pale and waterlogged, their eyes open but empty, gazing at nothing as they were pulled along.

The chain dragged them across the shallow water, scraping their bodies over whatever lay beneath. I could see some of them twitch when they hit something sharp, but none of them screamed. The ship passed directly overhead, the chain rattling faintly as it went on. It did not speed up. It did not slow down.

We stood there and watched it move past us, the trail of bodies stretching behind like a grotesque comet tail.

I don‚Äôt know how long we watched it. It might still be moving somewhere out there, dragging those bodies until there‚Äôs nothing left of them to drag.

Death turned and kept walking, and I followed. I didn‚Äôt talk anymore after that.

¬†

(13.)

Something is wrong with me.

It‚Äôs been creeping in over the last week, but today was the worst. I‚Äôve been tired before, long shifts, bad sleep, but this is different. My body feels hollow, like I‚Äôve been hollowed out with a dull spoon. My legs shake when I stand too long. My hands cramp when I try to write.

I barely made it halfway through work today before my boss stopped me in the hallway. She didn‚Äôt even ask if I was okay. She just said I looked pale and sick, and that I should go home before I dropped dead in the lobby.

I‚Äôve had three nosebleeds in the past two days. I almost never get them, maybe once every few years. The last one came out of nowhere while I was making coffee, and the taste of iron wouldn‚Äôt leave my mouth for hours.

I‚Äôm starting to wonder if these nights with Death are bleeding into the days. If some part of me is actually dying, piece by piece.

When I fell asleep tonight, the pull came faster than usual.

The place I woke in was open. Not like a field, not like a plain, but an expanse so vast that I couldn‚Äôt even tell where the ground ended and the horizon began. The surface beneath my feet was black stone, fractured in spiderweb patterns, each crack faintly glowing with dim blue light. Above us, the sky was filled with slow-moving clouds that glowed from within, like storm fronts lit by distant lightning.

Death stood a few steps ahead, already walking.

I caught up to him quickly. ‚ÄúIs there a reason you keep showing me all of this?‚Äù I asked.

He didn‚Äôt look at me, but he nodded once.

That answer was worse than silence. It confirmed something I‚Äôd been afraid to admit to myself. There is a purpose.

‚ÄúWhat is it then?‚Äù I pressed. ‚ÄúWhy me? Why these places? What am I supposed to do with any of this?‚Äù

His head turned slightly, and when he spoke, his voice was the low rumble of distant thunder.

‚ÄúIt is not yet time for you to know.‚Äù

The heat in my chest was sudden. I was tired, tired of waking in strange worlds, tired of walking without answers, tired of feeling weaker each day.

‚ÄúOf course it‚Äôs not time,‚Äù I muttered, my voice sharper than I meant it to be. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs never time, is it?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt reply.

I stopped asking questions.

We walked on in silence for the rest of the night. The cracks in the stone seemed to pulse faintly with each step we took, like the ground itself had a heartbeat. Somewhere far off, I could hear what sounded like water dripping into an endless pit.

When the pressure in my chest returned, I let it take me without fighting it.

Back in my bed, my nose was bleeding again.

¬†

(19.)

My body is failing me faster than I can keep track of.

I am exhausted all the time. My legs feel like they might buckle under the smallest weight. My hands cramp just lifting a pen. My vision flickers, and sometimes I see things that I know aren‚Äôt there, yet they feel solid. I could have sworn the mailman was missing his eyes today, standing at my doorstep with nothing behind his lids.

The worlds I walk through at night are seeping into my days. Shadows move across the walls where there should be none. Faces appear in reflections, and I catch them only for a moment before they vanish. My nosebleeds have become relentless, coming every couple of hours, each one leaving the taste of iron thick in my mouth.

I went to bed tonight determined to confront Death. I refused to move until he answered some questions.

We arrived in the blackened plains without sound, but this time he did not walk. For the first time, he stopped, standing motionless and waiting. I could feel the pull of the landscape, but I did not move.

‚ÄúWhy are you showing me all of this?‚Äù I asked, my voice steadier than I felt.

His head tilted toward me. When he spoke, the words were slow, deliberate, and impossibly calm.

‚ÄúTo prepare you.‚Äù

I frowned, pressing further. ‚ÄúFor what?‚Äù

He said nothing. He only stood there, impossibly still, his form swallowing light around him. The answer was implied, clear, and yet I dared not say it aloud.

I swallowed hard and tried another question. ‚ÄúWhy is my body getting worse in the real world? Why am I falling apart?‚Äù

He remained silent. Not a nod, not a gesture, only the weight of his presence. The answer again was implied, as if my own failing body and these walks were connected in ways I could not fully comprehend.

I exhaled slowly, letting the tension drain out of me. My chest ached, my muscles trembled, and my head throbbed, but I understood enough.

I walked with him.

We moved through the dark plains together. The windless air pressed against me. The ground beneath our feet was cracked and uneven, pulsing faintly with an inner glow. I spoke occasionally, but only to fill the silence, knowing he would not answer.

And yet, even without his words, I felt it. The reason, the purpose, the inevitability. Each step with him is shaping me, marking me, preparing me for something I cannot name. I do not want to know yet, but part of me knows I already do.

When I awoke, my body felt worse than ever. My nose had bled again. My muscles ached. My vision wavered. And still, I cannot stop.

¬†

(25?)

I don‚Äôt know what day it is anymore. The hours of sunlight blur into one another, and the nights follow the same pattern, slipping past me in shapes I can barely name. At first, I could remember every night clearly, because each one was unique, strange, terrifying in its own way. But now, I have seen all manner of things, horrifying, beautiful, impossible, and the memories overlap like wet paint running together. I am not even sure if this is the twenty-fifth night, or if I have been walking longer than that.

My body continues to fail me. Each day is heavier, each step slower. My vision flickers constantly, and the hallucinations that haunt me when I am awake have grown sharper, more frequent, more detailed. They are not random anymore. I recognize them for what they are: the fates I have witnessed on the walks.

I see glimpses of them everywhere. Faces twisted by pain, bodies suspended in impossible ways, signs of punishments that do not belong to this world. Flayed skin hanging from skeletal frames, limbs bent backward until they snap but never stop. People drowning in shallow pools of water that never stop rising, gasping endlessly as the water fills their mouths, noses, eyes. Bound to red-hot iron cages that sear without ever cooling, screaming silently for eternity. Hung by man-sized fish hooks through the neck and dangling with others like wind chimes, swaying with an invisible breeze. Bodies sewn together into grotesque patchwork, forming moving walls of flesh. Limbs twisted into knots that defy anatomy, faces pressed flat against stone as if to memorize their own torment.

I have begun to feel something I never expected. I can almost see it. Not in full, not with certainty, but I can glimpse the shape of someone‚Äôs fate before they reach Purgatory. The curve of a spine, the tension in their hands, the way they breathe, it all hints at what awaits. I see it in brief flashes, in moments when the world is quiet and the shadows press closer. It terrifies me more than the walks themselves because it is mine, too, and there is no one to guide me through it.

I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can last like this. My body weakens every day. My nose bleeds without warning, my muscles cramp at the smallest effort, and my mind is fraying at the edges. Yet I still walk. I still follow him, even though I know that the horrors I see are only the beginning, and the ones that await are worse than I can name.

Every night brings more. Every night I see more of what lies beyond. I am learning the patterns, the inevitabilities, and with each step, I understand that Purgatory is not only a place. It is a truth, and one day it will catch me fully.

¬†

(??.)

I can barely remember how long I have been walking. Time stretches thin, bending around me like a fragile pane of glass, and the days and nights are one long, continuous motion of shadow and silence. My body is failing faster now. Every movement makes my head and chest ache.

We walked for hours without a word. The ground beneath us was uneven, blackened stone that seemed to pulse faintly with a light of its own. The air pressed close, heavy with the smell of wet iron and ash.

Finally, I could not hold back the question. ‚ÄúAm I going to die?‚Äù I asked.

Death stopped, which is rare. He does not often pause, but now he did, turning his impossible form toward me. His voice, low and hollow, rolled through the stillness.

‚ÄúPerhaps. Someday.‚Äù

I swallowed, my throat dry, and whispered, ‚ÄúI imagine it will be soon, with how fast my body is declining.‚Äù

He did not answer. I forced myself to ask another question, even though I could feel the weight of his presence pressing down harder with each word.

‚ÄúDo I really see it? Can I see people‚Äôs fates in the real world, like it feels like I can?‚Äù

For a long moment, he said nothing. The stillness stretched between us, the black stone and shadow pressing against my chest. Then, finally, in a single word that cut through me like ice, he spoke:

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

The word echoed in my mind, settling deep in a place I cannot reach. My stomach twisted. My hands clenched at my sides. It was not just a confirmation. It was a warning.

I wanted to say more, to ask what it meant, but I could not. I swallowed and followed him, each step heavier than the last, the silence now full of an understanding I did not want, yet could not escape.

¬†

(The last night.)

I do not know how many nights it has been. I do not know if the days even exist anymore. Every moment of my life feels like part of the same endless walk, and the nights have begun to feel like the only reality I can trust.

Tonight was different.

For the first time, I had a full conversation with Death. Not a nod, not a wordless gesture, not a cryptic answer. A conversation. I asked him, again, why this is happening. Why I am being shown all these things, why my body is breaking down, why my mind is fraying with every passing day.

He did not answer with words at first. Instead, he pointed ahead. I followed him across cracked black stone that pulsed faintly beneath our feet, until we reached the edge of a pit.

It was impossible. The darkness yawned below us like an ocean with no bottom. I could not see the end, and my mind struggled to comprehend the depth. Even the air around it seemed heavier, drawn downward as if the pit were pulling the world into itself.

‚ÄúThis is what you have been walking towards,‚Äù Death said.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I asked, my voice shaking.

‚ÄúYou will find out soon,‚Äù he replied.

I stood at the edge of the pit, my chest tight, the blackness below endless.

‚ÄúWhy did you lead me here?‚Äù I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

Death turned to me, his impossible form shifting with the depth of darkness and stars within him. For a moment, I felt as if he was looking not at my face, but straight into my eyes, into the core of me.

‚ÄúIt was your choice to follow,‚Äù he said, his voice low and certain. ‚ÄúI am simply the guide.‚Äù

I swallowed hard, staring down into the void. My legs trembled. The weight of inevitability pressed on me. There was no arguing, no bargaining, only the truth of what I had chosen, knowingly or not, and the path that lay before me.

I looked into the unending void, my stomach twisting. ‚ÄúWhat happens if I fall?‚Äù

He tilted his head, a movement that seemed impossibly slow and deliberate. His body radiated nothing but emptiness and stars, a universe contained in black. ‚ÄúYou will not fall,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBecause you will step in.‚Äù

I swallowed hard. My hands were trembling. My chest ached. The pull of the pit was stronger than anything I have felt, a pressure that threatened to drag me into itself even before I moved. And yet, I knew he spoke the truth. I would not fall. I would step.

I do not know what waits at the bottom. I do not know if I will survive what comes next, or if I will be changed beyond recognition. But I know I will step.

And then, perhaps, I will finally understand.

¬†

Even as I write this, I can feel it. My fingers are growing cold with the touch of death, the weight of him pressing into me through the screen, the keyboard, through the air around me. I write not because I think it will save me, not because I can fight what is coming, but because I need someone, anyone, to know. To know that this exists, that it waits, that I have seen it.

All day I have seen him. Not in dreams, not in walks through impossible lands, but here, in the waking world. Just out of reach, always near, waiting. I cannot close my eyes without seeing the shadow of him sliding across the corners of rooms, leaning over strangers, brushing past passersby in silence. It is not that they cannot see him. It is that he does not allow them to see, only me.

I have been seeing the fates of others for weeks now. I can glimpse them in the twitch of a hand, the curve of a spine, the way someone breathes, and it chills me to know what waits for them. But when I look at myself, there is nothing I can measure, no form I can define. Only infinite dark. Beautiful, impossible dark filled with swirling infinities of new and dying stars, galaxies of smoke and shadow birthing and dying within themselves. A universe contained in a single absence of light, and it is me.

I know tonight I will step into the pit. I know it as surely as I know that the air presses heavier on my chest, that my legs shake beneath me, that my body is failing. This is not a choice. It is inevitability.

I do not know what awaits at the bottom, but I know it will be the answer. I know that what comes next will be the culmination of every walk, every sight, every whisper of Death in the dark. And still, I am not afraid, not fully. There is a strange comfort in knowing the shape of what is to come, in knowing that I will finally see it.

Tonight, I will step.

And perhaps, after that, there will be silence.",8,1755154122.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

Curled up with feet in the chair or sitting with one leg underneath me and the other bent upwards? ‚ÄúGet your feet out of the chair, NOW!‚Äù ‚ÄúYou are a lady, stop siting like that. Close your legs, NOW.‚Äù

The whole feet in the chair thing and farting (IN PUBLIC) and picking her nose (IN PUBLIC BUT MAINLY IN HER CAR) has gotten progressively worse and worse however.

Whether we‚Äôre home, visiting  someone, going out to eat, at the doctors ect she will literally take off her sandal and sit with one leg and foot under her.

How is *THAT* comfortable. She destroyed one of our sofas because she refused to sit normal in it.

She also props her feet up on things in front of her, such as a coffee table or a chair in front of her. She actually does this IN CHURCH too.

Whenever she picks her nose, her boogers sometimes hit me. Occasionally when she exhales from her nostrils (she does this on purpose) her snot hits me. 

Her farting in public makes people scuttle away from her like crabs the moment they smell it.

1mpt06k,https://www.reddit.com/r/OT42/comments/1mpt06k/reese_talks_about_protests_and_how_terrifying_it/,Reese talks about protests and how terrifying it was to be Aaron's double agent,"In tonight's stream, Reese talked about how stressful it was to be Aaron's double agent for months after she called the Aftermath Foundation for help. She spoke out against protesters who yell at or attack Scientologists, and she discussed that she's having a hard time dealing with some of the things she's learning about L. Ron Hubbard.  
  
A superchatter tells Reese that not even God can change what happened to her, but she can grow with God guiding her now. Reese gets teary-eyed and says that's really impactful. She reads that message twice, adding it gives her hope because she's afraid she's never going to change and she often wonders what if she never improves. ""I don't want to think like a Scientologist,"" she says. ""I fucking hate it.""   
  
A chatter tells Reese that sometimes he sits outside the Boston org with a sign telling Scientologists their doubts are valid. He says he can't understand why some protesters yell at and harass Scientologists. Reese says she doesn't understand that either. ""I think it's fucking awful,"" she says.   
  
A lot of ex-Scientologists must feel the same way about how Aaron has been behaving at protests for the past few months because so many of them have stayed silent and have said nothing to support him since his arrest for throwing a lot of Holi powder directly at a Sea Org member.   
  
It's incredibly powerful to tell Scientologists their doubts are valid, Reese says. She reminds her audience that Scientologists are human beings who are trapped. ""If it were easy to get out, I'd have my family back,"" she says, referring to two of H's grandparents and her father. ""... Yelling always shuts people down.""   
  
She tells about being on course for a couple of years when the Anonymous protests were happening outside of the Kansas City org. Every time those protests reinforced Reese's belief that the outside world is dangerous, she says. It doesn't help Scientologists or save them when protesters are scaring them, yelling at them or attacking them, she says.   
  
She remembers seeing the Anonymous protesters in masks holding signs that read It's A Cult and thinking that she was glad she was safe inside the org and that Scientology's teachings about the outside world were right.

Reese says she thinks she's losing weight because she's not eating a lot due to her pancreatitis. It's not healed yet but the hydrocodone is helping, she says. I think she's talking about healing to try to convince some Christians in her chat that she actually believes God will heal her even though her doctor said she would be in severe pain for two or three weeks.   
  
""I haven't had coffee in like a week now,"" she says. She gets sweaty from the pain, she says, adding that she's scared to go back on Rybelsus if that's what caused the pancreatitis.   
  
Reese is wearing overalls she got during the Nashville meet-up. She got another pair in a different color and claims they weren't expensive. One of Reese's fans who was at the Nashville meet-up said that Reese didn't pay for anything herself that weekend aside from her own coffee. Reese spent a lot of time that weekend shopping with her fans and whenever she would say she was thinking about buying something, one of her fans would jump in and buy it for her.  
  
A chatter asks if Reese is going to sell some of her stuff in a booth at Southern Goods Mercantile and Reese says she's not sure she's allowed to have a booth in there. That's weird because she said this weekend that the owner invited her to have a booth there. She says she and her mom went there today and the store was really full.   
  
She says she loves clothes from Eileen Fisher and she claims that she found a lot of Eileen Fisher stuff at a thrift store in Kansas City.   
  
She claims her health insurance sucks ""and I'm about to get hit up with a huge bill from that stupid ER last week."" In September, Reese said she has Blue Cross Blue Shield insurance. ""**I have really good health insurance**,"" she said then, adding that her insurance plan even helps her pay for her therapy sessions.   
  
Reese is lying that she has horrible health insurance because she's hoping that fans will feel worried enough to send her superchats or just cash. Instead of buying so much stuff she doesn't need, Reese should have an emergency fund that she could dip into for unexpected medical bills and car repairs she has complained about. Maybe Reese does have an emergency fund, but she'll never tell that to her viewers. She wants fans to pay for as much stuff for her, H and her pets that she can convince them to fund.

One of her biggest fans who has already gifted five memberships in this stream sends a superchat asking Reese if she's still going to get her Outshine the Fox tattoo. Reese says she plans to get it next week and that she had an appointment to get it done on the same day she went to the emergency room last week.   
  
She claims she was going to try to keep her tattoo appointment that afternoon after she went to the ER in the morning, but the tattoo artist told her that he didn't want her coming into the shop if she was really sick.   
  
Reese dramatically emphasized last week that she was in so much pain at the ER she was curled up in the bed hysterically crying and she questioned why the doctor would release her when she was still in so much pain. Now she's saying that she would have gone back to the tattoo shop that afternoon. That is highly suspicious and doesn't make any sense. She claimed last week she was in so much pain that she hadn't slept in two days by the time she went to the emergency room.   
  
""You guys all gave me birthday money for that so I'm gonna put it toward it,"" Reese says. Fans have been giving Reese money for that tattoo since she started talking about it on Halloween. On her birthday stream last month, Reese got a little over $1,106 in superchats. Some superchats came in immediately and Reese said she would probably put some of that money toward her tattoo. Before her birthday, Reese had already received more than $226 in ""tattoo money"" superchats. It's highly likely that more fans have sent Reese private donations for the tattoo.

Reese says she's adding ""4 4 4"" to the top of the tattoo because to her those numbers mean that God and angels are all around her. She adds that she's worried about getting this tattoo because she doesn't want to look like she has too many tattoos. A chatter suggests that Reese should ask her doctor if this is a good time to get a tattoo and Reese says she'll ask about that at her follow-up appointment.   
  
Reese is continuing to have doubts about this tattoo but she's adding to it. That should make the apprentice who's doing her tattoo and the tattoo shop even more concerned about having Reese as a client.   
  
She asks her fans if it's cool with them that her Outshine the Fox tattoo would cover her entire upper arm. She says she's nervous because this is going to be a painful tattoo to get and it's bigger than any of her other tattoos. She shows a tattoo of cherries she got on her back when she was 18 and says she thinks it's stupid.   
  
There's a Biblical tattoo she also wants to get, Reese says. She's talking about getting a Bible verse tattooed on her side and then says she can't remember exactly what it said. It's what was inscribed on a necklace that her Bible superchatter sent her for her birthday, she says. Reese says she already finds her mom staring at the Fred tattoo she got on her other arm so she's nervous about getting her Outshine the Fox tattoo.   
  
Reese says Knife Hoarder is totally out of her league and she hopes that God will do what he thinks is best in Knife Hoarder's life. She claims that she feels bad for him. All of the criticism about her means less than nothing to her now, she claims.   
  
Reese says she thinks there's a lot about her Scientology upbringing that she's in denial about. She repeats a lot of what she said yesterday and says she thinks it's creepy now that Scientologists just refer to ""the body.""  
  
""Get the body off that couch. Tell the body to get moving. That's how we talked,"" she says. Scientology dehumanizes people, she says. Reese says she thinks it's going to take years and a lot of therapy for her to deconstruct from all of the Scientology language and beliefs.   
  
She's comparing how Scientology dehumanizes people to scenes from Silence of the Lambs. Reese says that was her favorite movie growing up and she would watch it over and over again along with George Carlin comedy routines. Hannibal Lecter was her first crush, she says. ""I liked how much he was in love with her,"" she says, adding that she found him comforting instead of creepy.   
  
Reese says she's never taken her health seriously and emphasizes how much she's still a Scientologist when it comes to that subject. ""Knock it off,"" she says. ""I also feel like I don't put a lot of value on doctors.""   
  
She says she still has a hard time dealing with the fact that L. Ron Hubbard was taking drugs himself while he was requiring other people to do hours of auditing and Purifs for cough drops. A friend told Reese this morning that all of her training about her health comes from LRH. Reese says Scientologists were told he was a doctor. Her friend reminded Reese that LRH wasn't a doctor and she needs to stop thinking of him that way.   
  
Neither Scientology nor her dad taught her to value or protect her own body, she says. Reese got treated by a Medical Liaisons Officer her whole life and those people have never had any medical training, she says, adding that she had never thought about that until today. ""It's such a fucking disservice"" to all Scientologists, she says.   
  
Reese was indoctrinated to believe that going to a medical doctor is dangerous, she says, adding that she's just realizing now how many things she has been taught were all lies. She mentions how much Scientology and the Aftermath episodes turned her life upside down when she first watched them.  
  
Explaining Scientology to outsiders is really hard to do, she says. A fan says that Reese was medically gaslit, emotionally abandoned and spiritually abused for 37 years and she's proud of Reese for not giving up when she learns truths. ""That is very validating and it's so true,"" Reese says. ""And it's not just me. It's all of us who were Scientologists. I hate all that time that I lost."" She adds that it gnaws on her daily and she feels terrible for all the people who are still in Scientology.   
  
When her friend said today that LRH wasn't a doctor, Reese got defensive and said ""Yes, he was."" She says she's not ready to accept the truth about LRH because she worshipped him for almost her entire life. That's a contradiction because in some streams, Reese has made a real point to say that she never worshipped LRH like many other people did and she always thought it was weird when people would clap for his picture.   
  
Reese asks if anyone knows what PTS means and then seems very surprised that so many of her chatters know quite a bit about being a Potential Trouble Source. Maybe she's forgotten that a lot of her fans came from Aaron's channel and they have watched documentaries like Going Clear and Scientology and the Aftermath. They've learned a lot about Scientology.   
  
Reese explains PTS means you're a liability to the entire group because you're connected to a suppressive person and you pulled in whatever illness or accident happened to you. ""It's awful. It's all your fault,"" she says. When she was growing up, all of the adults around her smoked, she says, and they would walk around saying they weren't going to get sick because they weren't PTS.   
  
Reese brings up how David Miscavige talked about LRH's body when he announced that LRH had died and that LRH had research to do outside of the body. That's how little Scientologists care about death and people taking care of their bodies, she says.

Reese says her audience doesn't seem to love it when she talks about Scientology and that's probably because there are so many other channels talking about it. Her Scientology streams don't get a lot of views, she says. Some of her older streams about Scientology actually did get a lot of views but a lot of those viewers have left her channel in the past year because they saw how badly she treated friends and that she lies and manipulates money out of people.  
  
She says she still has a hard time talking about the cult because she's remembering things that are hard to deal with. She never believed it when the Anonymous protesters said Scientology is a cult, she says.   
  
When a chatter tells Reese she thinks her necklace is changing color, Reese says she really likes that necklace and she just got it recently.   
  
Reese says it's so scary for Scientologists to think they might be PTS that she's seen people say hundreds of times when they get the sniffles or look like they might have a fever that they just have allergies.   
  
The Kansas City org kept a pack of cigarettes in LRH's office there because people there genuinely believed he was coming back, she says. She's not willing to accept that LRH was a drug addict, she says, asking how people know that's true. She's also wondering about what she's been told about LRH practicing black magic.   
  
Reese really should read books like A Piece Of Blue Sky by Jon Atack. She should learn from people who know a lot about it instead of from fans who are just giving her bits and pieces of things that they've heard. Reese says it's hard for her to wrap her mind around the idea that LRH did a bunch of dark, Satanic stuff.  
  
Some of Reese's fans say they don't watch any SPTV channels anymore because there's too much drama. Reese says she's never watched other channels and she's just glad to stay the eff out of the drama.   
  
Another chatter recommends that Reese read Bare Faced Messiah. Reese says she has that book. ""I started it. I just never finished it,"" she says.   
  
Reese retells the story of accidentally putting bleach on her dad's Grateful Dead shirt when she was doing the laundry at 6 years old. Her dad put her in lower conditions and made her write up her overts and withholds for eight weeks, she says.   
  
A chatter asks what Scientologists think about people with special needs. Reese says people with disabilities and special needs are treated like degraded beings by Scientologists. She remembers seeing someone in a wheelchair in Omaha and her dad would get angry anytime he had to be around that person. He would call them disgusting. Reese thinks they had cerebral palsy and she recalls her dad telling her that he didn't think there was even a thetan in that person's body.   
  
Reese says she believes karma will come to her father and that's how she's able to sleep at night after how abusive he has been to children and how disrespectful he is to women. She starts talking about his wife, saying that she's Hispanic and is not American. ""He would say really demeaning things to her,"" she says.   
  
She says she finally feels chosen because she's been chosen by God. That's a warm, soft feeling, she says. Even more people are starting to put Bible verses in Reese's chat.   
  
Her advice for Scientologists who are under the radar is that everything Scientology tells people is a complete lie. It's not scary out in the real world but it's a tough transition if they have to lose their family and their jobs, she tells them. ""You gain so much more when you come out to planet Earth where the people are kind. They help. They want to help. It's just a whole new lifestyle, "" she says.   
  
Reese hopes a lot of ex-Scientologists will find God because that's really helped her, she says. She's getting more superchats about God too.   
  
It took Reese weeks to reach out to the Aftermath Foundation for help and she only did that after watching the whole Scientology and the Aftermath series three or four times, she says. Reese says she knew once she called, there was no going back.   
  
She says she spoke with the Aftermath Foundation for six months before she was outed. The truth is that Reese was only speaking with Aaron. Mike Rinder said in his final videos that Aaron never told any of the other board members that Reese had reached out for help, and Mike was very concerned by how Aaron had handled Reese's situation.   
  
Those six months of being under the radar and talking to Aaron really effed her up mentally, she says, because pretending to still be a Scientologist was hard work. Reese seems to be trying harder not to use the word ""fuck"" as much as she used to. She was talking to her former in-laws and other Scientologists all the time ""and it was fucking terrifying,"" she says.   
  
It's so weird that she's referring to Aaron as the Aftermath Foundation now when she's never done that before. Maybe she's just afraid to say Aaron's name on her channel because if she says anything he doesn't like, he might do a livestream about it.   
  
Aaron convinced her to be his double agent, but he should never have put that kind of pressure on her just to use the information she gave him as content for his channel. Other board members of the Aftermath Foundation would have been extremely careful with her personal information and they wouldn't have pressured her like Aaron did.   
  
She says she couldn't sleep at night during those months when she was Aaron's double agent and she was terrified that someone was going to find out, so when Aaron did out her, she was like ""Oh shit.""  
  
Reese claims she's not comfortable telling lies. ""Playing a double agent like that was absolutely one of the hardest things I've ever had to do,"" she says. On top of that, her marriage to Jeff was bad. He was in the Jesters and she had to play a happy wife when she was around other people, she says.   
  
She reached out to the Aftermath Foundation on July 5, 2022. Aaron called her back, she says.   
  
Reese says she kind of wants to play the secret recordings she made of phone calls with Scientologists again. She's already replayed some of those. Reese really pressured Aaron to do streams with her and Natalie where they would all react to those phone calls again. Aaron showed no interest in that. Reese kept pushing Aaron about that when she agreed to come back onto his channel after a long absence. Agreeing to do that stream with Aaron caused Tommy to break up with her.   
  
Reese thinks she will have much bigger platforms and that YouTube will be just a tiny portion of her outreach about Scientology's dangers, she says.",6,1755153648.0,OT42,1,0.88,False

But today he crossed a line and I told him I don‚Äôt want to be friends with him over it but I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm overreacting. 

I went out for coffee with a different friend (we will call her Melissa) who I‚Äôve been friends with for my whole life and we definitely aren‚Äôt romantically interested in each other, when Doug texted me asking where I was so I told him I was at a cafe. He immediately launches into ‚Äúhow‚Äôs your date going?‚Äù So I said good because I thought we were joking around and he told me not to text during my date because it would make him (the ‚Äúdate‚Äù) upset and he made a joke about me looking for sex. I told him that Melissa didn‚Äôt appreciate being misgendered 
To which he told me he ‚Äúratted‚Äù me out to my roommate/ex (who will be called Gary) about me being on a date with Melissa. He didn‚Äôt say much after that except asking if me and the date were back home. I just chalked it up to it being a weird joke. 

Jump to a couple hours later, I meet up with Gary to get dinner and we go home. And I asked to see what Doug had sent him when he supposedly ratted me out. The texts between them felt really rude and Doug was acting like I lied about Melissa and was talking about how I was on Tinder all the time (true but I almost never actually meet up with anyone on there) and how I was going to make Gary buy me dinner after my date? And a few other rude things that made it sound like I was using Gary because I currently don‚Äôt have a steady cash flow, he‚Äôs been helping but I‚Äôm actively looking for another job to pay him back. 

Sorry if this all very confusing but I‚Äôm also really confused too because it seems like he just created this story in his head to be upset at me and try to cause drama in my household but I can‚Äôt figure out the reason. So am I overreacting for telling him I didn‚Äôt want to be friends anymore after the way he talked about me behind my back and for being weirdly obsessed with my dating life?

I was recently ""fired without just cause"" from my full time job. I received severance and am moving on, but I really loved my job and my coworkers, so losing it has been difficult and stressful, and honestly just really sad. I excelled at my job and it brought me a lot of joy overall. I was paid well, appreciated by my coworkers and clients, and the job itself was the perfect fit for me. There were so many boxes that it checked! The only real downside; however, turned out to be a big one - the boss - who also happened to be one of my closest friends, for a time. 

I live in a somewhat small community and was casual friends with the boss/owner, whom I'll call Donna, when I was hired, but we quickly became really close friends after I started working there. She called me her [sidekick] and we worked very closely together, more so than anyone else on the team. Because of this, she sung my praises when she was in a good mood, but she was also harder on me and more critical and abrupt towards me than anyone else (aside from her husband, who also worked there and was often blessed with her backlash). I am usually a very kind and loving but emotional person with a big heart who cares deeply, whereas Donna was almost the total opposite - so we were an odd pairing and it confused people who really know me and knew of Donna's reputation, but I thought we got along well more often than not (so long as I kept my mouth shut and did everything on her terms, both as her employee and as her friend). She behaved as if I was lucky to be chosen by her because she didn't open up to and spend personal time with many people. She had a history of not only burning bridges (both personally and professionally), but nuking them - and joked about how spiteful and vindictive she could be. She regularly told me I had to keep our personal relationship and our professional relationship separate, but what she really meant was that I couldn't hold it against her as my friend when she treated me poorly as my boss - the lines were always blurred ALL the time otherwise, in many many ways on both sides, and our lives became very intertwined both in the office and outside of it, even in the community with volunteer work and such, where she was also ""above"" me in our roles, and I was more like her [personal assistant] in all things, as she liked to say. My colleagues, friends, and family all made several comments to me of concern about this over time, but I made excuses for her a LOT, even when I'd been brought to tears by how she'd spoken to me. I knew she had a very difficult upbringing and experienced a lot of trauma in her life previously, before she started her business and became successful, so I would tell them she didn't really mean it and I tried not to take it personally. I know that wasn't an excuse, but people are complicated and complex and I try to give the benefit of the doubt when I can. She could be really fun and enjoyable to be around when she was in a good mood and things were going her way, and she could also be very generous and attentive when she wanted to be (again, on her terms), but otherwise she was snappy, intense, extremely moody with severe swings, insensitive, condescending, acted as if she knew everything and everyone needed her but she needed no one, so you'd better stay in your place. Everyone else knew from experience to keep their distance from her - as a boss and as a friend - and not make waves to avoid the inevitable, but my job was specifically tied to her/hers and we became so close that I loved her despite these issues and looked for the good in her, instead, and I believed her when she many times told me she loved me and would stand by me and not let me go. She had been abandoned so many times by so many people over the years and repeatedly asked me to never leave her and told me I was the best (job title) she'd ever hired by far and she didn't know how she'd gone all these years without me - as both her employee and her ""best"" friend, etc. She told me I was ""the embodiment of agape love"". I would promise her that I was loyal and wasn't going anywhere, and was very vocal about how much I loved my job and appreciated everything that came with it. My husband was always worried that things wouldn't end well, because he knew I couldn't emotionally handle being whiplashed ad nauseam, but I was so stupidly trusting and believing of her love bombing when things were going well that I'm ashamed to admit I cowed down when things weren't, to avoid the blowup I'd witnessed on numerous occasions. And eventually the time came when I couldn't do it anymore.

As her employee, obviously I did my job the way she wanted, it was her company and she had every right to tell me what to do and how to do it (in an appropriate way) while I was being paid, and I have no doubts that I did a GREAT job, but she treated me like this in every facet and was sometimes oddly possessive/jealous. She would get angry with me and call me unprofessional for being ""overly friendly"" with my coworkers and ""crossing a line"", when I was just trying to be kind to people. For example, after I'd worked there for a very short time, I saw on the team calendar that it was the working anniversary for two of our coworkers, so I sent a friendly ""Happy Anniversary!"" message in the team chat, which everyone responded positively to - including her husband - but Donna was NOT happy. She tore a strip off of me, saying that I was overstepping, that this type of thing was her job, not mine. I apologized. A few months later, I bought each of my coworkers a very small trinket for their desk with a little personalized card (like the business card size ones you get with flowers) to express my appreciation for them and working so well with them, because they were all such great people and we all got along so well and I was really thankful for that. Donna was so upset by this that she continued to bring it up in conversation for over a year afterwards, even though I never did anything like that again after her reaction. She told me it was inappropriate and unprofessional, that she is paying me money to spend on my own family not on my coworkers, buying gifts for coworkers is not acceptable, and if anyone is to be giving co-workers gifts of appreciation it should be her, not me. I should mention that I had an older coworker who gave beautiful and thoughtful gifts to me and other coworkers many times, both before and after this situation, and it was never an issue for her.

After I'd been at this job almost 2 years, I took a vacation, my first vacation in nearly 12 years. Before I left, I scheduled an email to our small but close and casual team, to be sent while I was away, telling them I missed them and hoped they were having a great week and I looked forward to seeing them upon my return. Maybe that might seem a bit weird to some people, but I genuinely cared about and appreciated my co-workers and enjoyed working with them, and this was far from a corporate work environment!

Donna showed up at my house unannounced the morning after I returned from vacation with Starbucks in hand. It's important to note that I had just declined a coffee date with her that same morning, explaining I was too busy catching up on things at home after returning from my trip, and told her I'd see her at the team work lunch we had scheduled later that day even though it was a day off. She invited herself inside my home, ""jokingly"" chastised me when I didn't offer her a joint - at 9am (it's legal here and we both smoke it, but she does it MUCH MORE heavily than me and throughout the day every day, even while driving or working, whereas I typically only do it occasionally before bedtime), so I prepared one for her that she partook in alone, and then she proceeded to to lecture ME about respecting people's boundaries, and telling me the email I had sent was inappropriate and unprofessional and not welcome in her office. She told me that my coworkers don't like me as much as I like them, they don't want to be my friends, that I ""love r*pe"" people by forcing my friendship on them, my email was ""cringe"" and others had approached her in private to tell her it made them uncomfortable (which I don't believe actually happened), and that I needed to respect their boundaries. For clarity, my coworkers had NEVER expressed any of these said boundaries to me and everyone had always been very friendly and open with me, telling me about their lives and sharing personal details and caring about mine in return, we were all ""friends"" on social media, and they and they all at one time or another told me they appreciated me and were always kind and welcoming to me. 

I should've stood up for myself then and there, but I was put on the spot and insulted in my own home, my safe space, and tend to avoid confrontation. I told her that - as my employer - if she didn't want me to send emails like that through work then I certainly wouldn't do it again, but admitted that - as a friend - how she worded that felt really harsh and I started to tear up. She rolled her eyes at me and told me not to be so sensitive, and compared me to a child. 

A few weeks later, the situation exploded in a way I never expected. For context: I have two young special needs children who often struggle behaviorally. For the most part, Donna was always impressively accommodating and understanding when I needed to leave work early or work from home on days where my children needed extra care, which was one of the greatest things about my job. She was well aware of my situation when I was hired, and always told me that being a Mom came first, and she was happy to help me find a work-life balance - even if that meant working less hours in the future, we would always figure it out, and she would do what was needed to keep me, even though she admitted to wanting even more of me (in a work related sense). 

At the end of the school year (June), my kids were having an especially difficult time, and following a particularly violent outburst from my youngest, I began to feel very guilty and that I might be failing my kids, that my working full time was too much for them, and the days they spent in care were too long, so I decided to do some math to see if we could afford for me to work less. I was shocked to find out that we'd actually SAVE money if I worked less (due to childcare costs and other things), so I texted my three closest friends sharing that information, and Donna was one of them. She and I texted all the time, even on days where we worked together all day, and we often video chatted in the evenings and hung out a lot together as friends  in our downtime. She often joked about how much time we spent together in every aspect of life. She was very aware of the details about my children and how stressful it could be, and knew all about this most recent incident. She often commented that she didn't know how I did it. 

She responded to my text saying she wasn't sure what to say to that. I realized she misunderstood my message and explained that I was just musing to a friend, I wasn't actually asking to reduce my hours and if I were to officially request that I would do so formally to her as my employer. She didn't respond. I was simply surprised to discover I could save money by working less so that I could give more time to my children, and reached out to the 3 friends I was closest to, to express that. I hadn't made any decisions at all, at this point. 

The next day at work, she had taken the morning off for an appointment, but her husband came into my office and told me that Donna told him that I said working for them was costing me money. I told him that I most certainly did NOT say it like THAT and didn't mean it like that, but I had done some math after an extremely difficult few days with my children's behavior because I was concerned they needed me present more than I had been since returning to work (I had been a stay-at-home Mom for almost ten years prior to this job). He said something along the lines of they wanted me to do what was best for my family and would try and support that, and I thanked him. After he left, I began to overthink it and grew more concerned that Donna was angry and how my message was clearly misunderstood and being worded/twisted into a very different meaning, but was hopeful at the expressed support, so I also started thinking about the idea of working less in more detail, and started to brainstorm some ideas. I went to his office and told him I might have an idea that would work for all of us, but I needed to crunch some numbers first and discuss it with my husband. He told me sure and to let them know, and then shortly later he left the building. 

Soon afterwards, Donna started sending me text messages. Her husband had obviously spoken with her, and she was LIVID that he ""betrayed her trust"" by talking to me about this and bringing this issue into the workplace, said that it wasn't his business or his place and he had no f-ing right to do that after I'd told her this as my friend. She apologized, she vented, called him a dumba** and an f-ing ""turd"" and a ""useless f-ing ass"", and said she was so f-ing angry with him she could f-ing punch him. She said ""this is why women are better"" and ""sometimes [men] just [aren't] worth it, f-ing d*ckfaces"". I told her I didn't think he meant any harm by it and I wasn't upset, it was a strange dynamic with all of us sometimes and can be difficult to keep work and friendship separate, I was just concerned she was angry with me. She told me that was not the case and she understood where I was coming from, that is a normal reaction and she's sorry I thought she was super upset, and he caused ""unneeded stress because he's always wanting to help where he is not wanted it or needed"" and he is a ""terrible f-ing communicator"" who ""doesn't have friendships nor has he ever had a [real] job so he doesn't know how to act"" and it's ""f-ing ridiculous"". I told her I was sorry if my text message wasn't tactful and caused a misunderstanding. We went back and forth, she brought up her abandonment issues again, I assured her that I loved my job (and her) and wasn't going anywhere, and that I really needed to think about it before I actually asked for reduced hours, and if I did that it wouldn't be until September anyway, which was over two months away at this point. She told me that there was no rush or urgency, the right decision was never the impulsive one, and we could table it for another time so that we could brainstorm together and come up with something that would work but if I need changes sooner to let her know, she wanted me to find balance so I could be at my best and she was happy to help me find that balance. When she arrived at work a while later, she came to my office and we discussed it more and repeated a lot of what I've already described, including me apologizing to her again for causing any issue by sending that initial text message. We agreed to put a pin in it and everything seemed ok and we carried on with our work day as usual.

The next morning, I had a medical appointment for my child before coming into work, and she texted me saying that she wanted to add [one of my job duties that required a lot of walking] to the list of things to consider reducing. I have been dealing with a knee issue for over a year that had progressively gotten worse, and I had recently been instructed by one of my medical professionals to start using a cane. She didn't like seeing me walk around and approaching clients with a cane, and said I was obviously in pain and she felt I was moving more slowly because of it and that was not cost effective for them. She said this was part of the job that she used to do and really enjoyed doing, so she would be happy to take it back on. I wasn't *actually* taking extra time by using a cane, but I WAS in pain, so I agreed to discuss it.

When I arrived at work, she was visibly very upset about something. I tried talking to her and asked if there was anything I could do, but she said she didn't want to discuss it with me. She did; however, tell me that she wasn't comfortable with leaving things ""in limbo"" and thanks to her doofus husband (who was sitting right there) for bringing it up at work, we needed to settle my working situation right away, that he had forced her hand. I reminded her that we had agreed to wait, that I hadn't actually asked for anything yet, but she said that was no longer an option. I went to my office to begin my work day and soon later she stormed out of the building without saying goodbye to anyone, muttering to our colleague at the front desk that she would be working from home the remainder of the day. That's when the emails started. 

She initially sent an email to both me and her husband, saying that we needed to figure this out as soon as possible and she wasn't happy with the timing but she had no choice, and it needed to be done in writing between the three of us to avoid misunderstanding since we were all involved in it now. She offered a proposed new hourly arrangement. I responded that I hadn't even talked to my husband about this yet, and once I had a chance to do that I could write up a proposal that would begin in September, but if she needed to work this out now then here was my idea so far, and I gave her some details of what I had thought about in the short time since I brought it up. She responded that she wanted the reduced hours to begin as soon as possible and not wait until September. I explained that my children were already registered and paid for summer camp, so I didn't need reduced hours until school started again, and working less immediately would hinder us financially. She said she would prefer it began immediately and said she would not elaborate on her reasons why. 

This was all really overwhelming for me and after many emails from her about all this I was having a lot of anxiety and difficulty concentrating on my work, so left earlier than usual that afternoon, which was not unusual in our office, we were always told we could be flexible with our working hours so long as we got the important things done, and others did this type of thing all the time. 

I emailed her that evening agreeing to the proposed new schedule we'd discussed that afternoon (after having the chance to discuss it with my husband). It was 7 hours less work a week than I had been working, but had some remote hours worked in, and I offered to do extra time from home when needed (this is an office environment where we are open to clients 4 days a week between 830-430, but a lot of my job was on the computer and could be done remotely from home when necessary, even though the preference was for it to be done in office, it was very common for any staff member to work from home). 

The next morning, I woke up to an email she'd sent me around sunrise. She's typically a night owl who sleeps in as late as possible, so her emailing me at that time of day was not a good sign. The email basically said that these reduced hours will work for the summer, but come September my hours will need to be reduced even more so she can hire someone else to split my job in half. She went on to explain that I was putting her in hardship and she needed to do what was best for her business, and that me doing this was very hurtful and stressful, and she couldn't be expected to make all these sacrifices for me and ""pick up the slack"" by doing a part of my job (due to my knee issue) (which was entirely her idea, not mine) only to better my situation because of my choices. 

I suddenly felt really scared about my job security and was overcome with all the stress I'd been dealing with the last couple months, and unfortunately I suffered a major panic attack. I'm talking sobbing uncontrollably, drooling on the floor, pupils dilated, hyperventilating panic attack. My husband witnessed this and was very worried about me. Once it was over, I quickly developed a very painful migraine and had to message our team chat that I was staying home from work because of it - which is how everyone ""called in"" sick and what we were instructed to do. Donna replied but deleted the message before I could see it. My husband also took the day off to stay with me so I wasn't left alone in that state. And later that day our youngest child had another serious incident at school. That evening, she messaged me to ask how I was doing and said she was there if I needed to talk and she couldn't imagine how overwhelming things must get [for me] sometimes.

The next day at work was tense and awkward. She emailed the entire team announcing my new hours effective the following week and the she was to be taking over [my job duty regarding my knee] moving forward. I reiterated that I was capable to continue doing this aspect of my job - and you should see the overly-official ChatGPT super-HR themed response I got to that! üòÜ Not to mention the whispering I could hear through the wall immediately following my email (her and her husband's shared office was next door to mine). I kept my head down and did my job and went home for the weekend. I posted on my personal Facebook about my panic attack due to stress, as a way of bringing awareness and support to Mental Health, telling others they were not alone if they also experience anxiety or depression. Donna ""loved"" my post, and texted me telling me that she wanted me to know she was thinking of me and she adores me and is always always there for me if I want to talk, and that she loves me. 

I was flabbergasted. I didn't want to respond, but I also didn't want to say nothing and cause further conflict. I messaged back thanking her but saying that I wasn't really sure how to respond because after everything that had happened that week I was feeling hurt and backed into a corner, and I understood if she was feeling hurt as well and I had apologized to her previously, but that I felt some damage had been done to our friendship because it felt like things had escalated and gotten out of control. I told her it was something I think we needed to discuss at another time, but I wasn't in a the right space for it right now, but didn't want to give her the silent treatment, either. She replied and said she disagreed, we needed to talk about it and we needed to talk about it tonight. She said that she would not continue this way for very long, that I started all this by sending an unprofessional and hurtful text message and how could I expect a positive response. She said I caused this mess and she does not often experience daily drama and was not about to start now, so communication was not too much to ask, and she doesn't recall hearing an apology from me. She said she had been nothing but flexible and understanding to me, that my text message was not kind, unprofessional and undeserved, that she had asked for a pause and when that didn't happen she tried to work out a plan, etc etc etc. the text messages just kept coming, one after the other. I told her I was sorry I couldn't talk about it right now, I felt like I was going to have another panic attack and needed to turn off my phone. 

The next morning, I woke to an email she had sent me in the middle of the night. She apologized for the way things had gone lately, said our new arrangement felt like a lose-lose situation and she believed in win-win deals, said that it would require a lot of unpacking at a later date, and asked if there was a way we could reach a compromise for now. She said she was sorry she insisted I reduce my hours right away, but my 'random text in the middle of June' was painful and felt like a slap to the face. She continued to word that text in the misunderstood way, and went on to basically say how much of an inconvenience I was causing her, so I shouldn't reap all the benefits, so to speak. She offered some alternatives. 

Later that morning, she sent me a personal text message saying that it was important that I knew that even when we are having a disagreement she still cares about me very much. She said that she's not good at being a friend or being supportive, especially in times of conflict, but still wants to be there for me if I need to talk. She concluded by saying she hopes I get lots of rest this weekend and she is sending me all her love. 

I tried my best to respond to the email but was busy caring for my children. I explained that I didn't have time to address everything at the moment, so would try to send a more detailed response later that weekend. I said I hoped we could come to an arrangement that would work for both of us by compromising, as she had offered. I explained that my main priority was being more available to my children after school, when they seem to struggle the most, and gave a detailed response on a working arrangement that could potentially work better for both of us. I reiterated some things I felt were important. 

(Btw I'm paraphrasing a LOT of this very long story to try and save time, but have loads of screenshots of nearly everything).

I saw her later that day while I was dropping my child off at camp. She gave me a big hug and told me again that she loves me. My other child started having a meltdown so I had to leave. She hadn't yet seen my email response from earlier.

Later, she responded to my email saying she was very happy with it and it felt like a better compromise and win-win for us both. 

At this point, it felt like the work hours situation was resolved but the misunderstanding and twisting of things and how she had been treating me was not, and I didn't think I could go back to being her friend if those weren't also addressed, since our work life and personal life were so intertwined. Sometimes I think back on what happened next and wish I would've just left it alone. Other times, I'm glad I spoke up and attempted to defend myself. Someone close to me told me that even if I HAD just left it at that, it would only have delayed the inevitable. 

Later that weekend, I sat down and wrote a LONG email response going over what had happened in an attempt to explain where I had been coming from and why I had felt so stressed and hurt, and to clear up any leftover misunderstanding. I was genuinely hoping for peace and amicable resolution by getting it all off my chest, in a respectful way. I told her that I didn't expect a response over the weekend, or at all if she didn't wish to discuss it further, but it was important to me that they knew my truths, as both my close friends and employer. I also asked a couple questions about what certain things related to my job would look like moving forward. She responded (addressing me by my given name and not the nickname she always called me - which is never a good sign!) and said that her and her husband had nothing further to discuss regarding this matter. She thanked me for the clarification, but said the hours were already agreed upon, so to please try to enjoy my weekend, this is been resolved as far as they are concerned. 

... But was it?

The following Monday morning, I had to stay home sick - really bad timing, I know!! But trust me when I say that it was not within my control and I needed to stay very close to my bathroom that day. üò≥üöΩ

The next day, while at work, she sent me a message on the work chat that we needed to have a discussion and to tell her when I was ready for that. I replied that she could come to my office whenever she was ready. I won't get into the whole 1/2 hour conversation, but it started with her asking me if I was still planning on working my hours and doing my job. I was confused. She said I didn't seem like I'd been coming into work much lately. I was still confused and asked if this was about me calling in sick the day before. It was, and she clearly didn't believe I was actually sick. I assured her that I had been. She asked if I planned on fulfilling my hours moving forward. ü§® Of course I did. Then she brought up my final email and wanted to know why I sent it after things were resolved and why I included her husband in the email, telling me it was very unprofessional and inappropriate. I told her I felt it was important that I clarify things and not allow the misunderstanding from my initial text message to continue, and she'd previously told me she wanted it in writing between the three of us. She argued with me. She told me I was causing daily drama in my ""manic"" state (I have an anxiety disorder, I have never in my entire life been in a MANIC state) and she had to tip toe around me to avoid offending me all the time, again telling me I'm unprofessional and comparing me to a child. I told her that was really ironic and it felt to me like she was projecting, because I could say the exact same thing to her and I'm not the only one who feels that way, and eventually asked did she consider telling me that I ""LOVE R*PE"" people to be a professional way to behave as an employer? She claims she said that to me as a ""friend"", not an employer. Things went back and forth for a while and she told me that her husband told her I'm ""fucking lying"" about my initial text message, that I sent him into a depression over all of this, that I blew up our friendship, and I should take the rest of the week off. I asked her if that was a paid leave. She said oh, right, then consider this your two weeks working notice instead. She then huffed out of my office out saying ""sorry this has been such a horrible place to work and I've been such a terrible person to work for!"" üôÑ

She quickly sent an email to the entire team (except for me) telling everyone that effective two weeks from now I would no longer be working for the company and ""This decision was made after careful consideration and is in line with our commitment to maintaining a productive and positive work environment... and I want to assure you that our focus remains on supporting one another and continuing to move forward as a team. It has also been brought to my attention that some team members may not feel comfortable speaking with me directly due to fear of repercussions or concerns about being treated unfairly or harshly by me. This is something I take very seriously and I apologize if that continues to be the case. I‚Äôve worked hard to foster an environment where open and honest communication is welcomed and encouraged, and I want to remind everyone that my door is always open. If you have questions, concerns, or simply want to talk, I am here to listen. Please feel free to speak with me directly and confidentially. I apologize for any negativity this creates in our normally peaceful office and I sincerely thank you for your professionalism and continued commitment during this time of transition."" 

COMPLETE DELUSION, IMO.

After this email was sent, one of my co-workers immediately went home sick. A private meeting was held between Donna and another staff member considered management. Immediately afterwards, Donna came back to my office and told me that there had been ""chatter"" so my staying two weeks wasn't going to work out and I needed to leave immediately. Truth be told, I'd already packed up my stuff! I knew there was no way she'd be mature enough to work alongside me amicably for the next two weeks.

She had blocked me on social media by the time I reached my car. She sent me my final paycheque, including severance, but made an error and then another error, so there was still some back and forth emailing to resolve it. She posted on our local Mom's Group that same afternoon that she was looking to hire someone ""drama free"" to fill my position, in a community where many people fully knew I was the one she was referring to. She also posted a gift that she'd bought for me (but hadn't given to me yet) for sale on Marketplace, saying it was no longer needed. A few days later, she removed me from a local social group she started as a side business venture that I had a paid membership for. There were a few other things that happened, but this story has been way too long already!! Thanks so much for reading this, if you've made it all the way through! üòÜ

ANNA

I glance at the clock beside my bed. Three a.m. Christ, I love my baby daughter, but I wish she‚Äôd sleep for more than an hour at a time. I get out of bed and go over to Willow‚Äôs crib. I know she can‚Äôt help it, she‚Äôs suffering terribly with reflux, so I cuddle her to my chest and begin to walk around the room. The movement seems to calm her.

I stare at the space in my bed where my husband should be, and I sigh. As usual, it‚Äôs empty. Things haven‚Äôt been going well between us since I announced I was pregnant with Willow. We‚Äôve spent a whole year of arguing, separating, making up, trying, but ultimately, we‚Äôre not happy. Not like before.

That familiar pain fills my chest and tears brim in my eyes. I can‚Äôt keep putting myself through this. Riggs thinks I tricked him into the pregnancy, but I didn‚Äôt, and I‚Äôm so sick of repeating myself. Accidents happen, and so what? We‚Äôre married and we already have a kid each, so I didn‚Äôt think it was such a big deal. In fact, I thought he‚Äôd be over the moon. Turns out, I was so very wrong.

He loves Willow, I know he does. The fact he‚Äôs not as hands-on as I expected doesn‚Äôt bother me. After all, he‚Äôs the president of the Kings Reapers MC, and lord knows he has a lot of club trash to deal with, but it hurts my heart that he‚Äôs not as invested in her as he could be. And she adores him, oblivious to his lack of interest in her. Whether it‚Äôs his voice or just the beating of his heart, whenever he cradles her, she‚Äôs calm, and boy, could I do with a night of calm.

She begins to whimper again. I take her blanket from the crib and wrap her in it then make my way onto the landing. I creep across to Riggs‚Äô son‚Äôs room. Sometimes he‚Äôll jump into bed with Ziggy so he doesn‚Äôt wake us, but Ziggy is lying like a starfish, completely alone.

I check in on Malia, my six-year-old daughter. She‚Äôs also deep in sleep.

I head downstairs. The clubhouse is silent for a change. Sometimes these guys can party all night, but it seems tonight is not one of those nights. I tap on Riggs‚Äô office door. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù he snaps.

I push it open and stick my head around the door. He‚Äôs looking relaxed, lying on his office couch with a whiskey in his hand, and Raven sits at his desk. Her smile fades. ‚ÄúI was just checking you were okay,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúBut I see I didn‚Äôt need to worry.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just talking,‚Äù says Riggs, looking slightly irritated by my presence.

‚ÄúAt three a.m.,‚Äù I note. ‚ÄúThe time when everyone leaves their wife in bed and chats to other women.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll leave you guys to it,‚Äù says Raven awkwardly.

‚ÄúNo, you don‚Äôt have to go,‚Äù Riggs protests, sitting up.

‚ÄúYou really do,‚Äù I say. I like Raven, she‚Äôs friendly with all the guys and not in a way I feel threatened by, but still, he‚Äôs my husband and it‚Äôs three in the morning. As she gets level with me, I catch her eye. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let me catch you sniffing around him, Raven. I‚Äôll kick your butt out of here if I think for one minute you‚Äôre after him.‚Äù

‚ÄúNoted,‚Äù says Raven stiffly as she leaves.

‚ÄúWas that necessary?‚Äù asks Riggs.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, was it?‚Äù I snap.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm the club president. If I wanted a quick bang, I‚Äôd choose a girl less likely to tell your girlfriends,‚Äù he mutters.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying, Finn,‚Äù I say firmly. I only use his first name when I‚Äôm trying to break down his walls, though it never works these days. ‚ÄúBut you gotta stop pushing me away. I can‚Äôt keep fighting for us on my own. If you‚Äôre not in this marriage anymore, then say it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre always so dramatic, Anna,‚Äù he says, sighing. ‚ÄúI was chatting to a pretty girl at three a.m., shoot me. Some club presidents would have been doing a lot more than that!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy are you trying to push me away?‚Äù I suddenly cry. He looks sad for a second before pulling himself together. ‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs wrong, I know it is. Why won‚Äôt you talk to me?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier to talk to everyone but you,‚Äù he mumbles. My heart squeezes. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt listen. You think you do, but you‚Äôre so distracted, and that‚Äôs only when you‚Äôre not moaning in my ear.‚Äù

His harsh words slay me. Nobody wants to be described as a nagging wife and I try my hardest to avoid moaning at him, for that reason! ‚ÄúI‚Äôm making you unhappy.‚Äù I say it more as a statement than a question.

He knocks back the last of his drink. ‚ÄúGo back to bed.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome with me,‚Äù I say. I hate it that I sound so needy. Why do I beg like that? He shakes his head. ‚ÄúPlease, Riggs.‚Äù His jaw clenches and he sighs before putting his glass on his desk. I feel a small satisfaction as he follows me upstairs to our room. I lay Willow, who has now settled, in her crib and climb into bed. Riggs strips down to his boxer shorts. He hasn‚Äôt touched me in months. The most I get these days is a peck on the head, like I‚Äôm a child.

I move closer to him, snuggling into his side. He eventually wraps an arm around me. ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù I whisper.

‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù he whispers back and I smile. It‚Äôs these times that make me think we‚Äôll make it. If we have love, then surely we have hope.

\--

ANNA

I run my fingers over his ripped chest, slowly making my way downwards. I lean up slightly and lay peckes along his strong jaw until I reach his mouth. I‚Äôve almost forgotten what it‚Äôs like to peck him properly. I sweep my tongue into his mouth and gently push my hand into his boxer shorts. He‚Äôs soft. He‚Äôs not even stirring down below. I nip back along his jaw and down his neck, across his chest, and down his stomach.

He takes my arm, stilling me. ‚ÄúNot tonight,‚Äù he whispers.

I bite back the disappointment and nod, lying back down beside him. He peckes my cheek and rolls over, turning his back to me. A single tear escapes, rolling down my face. His rejection hurts more than his harsh words.

Willow wakes at four, then five, and when it gets to six, I give up and get out of bed. Riggs is awake, staring at the ceiling. ‚ÄúYou want me to take her?‚Äù he asks.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm awake now,‚Äù I mutter, lifting her from her crib and wondering just how long he laid there listening to her before I woke. Knowing he could have let me get some sleep just pisses me off more. ‚ÄúI know Willow is still young, but I‚Äôm thinking of looking for a part-time job,‚Äù I announce. Getting out of the club for a few hours is just what I need to take my mind off whatever‚Äôs going on between us.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right, she‚Äôs too young,‚Äù he mutters.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs already taking formula over chest milk,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôll be fine with Frankie and Esther, and they offered to help out.‚Äù His mum, Frankie, was more than happy to help and my best friend‚Äôs mum, Esther, also lives at the club and I see her like my own mum, so with the childcare covered, I‚Äôm all set. ‚ÄúMy old job is free and Darren said he‚Äôd take me back anytime.‚Äù

‚ÄúDarren? The guy who fancies you?‚Äù he asks. ‚ÄúYou have it all worked out.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôll do us good,‚Äù I say quietly. ‚ÄúGive us a chance to miss each other.‚Äù It‚Äôs all excuses. He doesn‚Äôt see me during the day anyway, and at the minute, he doesn‚Äôt come to bed either.

‚ÄúThe answer is no,‚Äù he mutters, throwing the sheets back and reaching for his jeans.

‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt asking,‚Äù I say under my breath, leaving the room.

Leia is in the kitchen feeding her newborn baby. ‚ÄúMorning,‚Äù she smiles. She gave birth weeks ago and she‚Äôs looking amazing. Motherhood suits her.

‚ÄúHow do you look so amazing at this hour?‚Äù

‚ÄúPlenty of coffee,‚Äù she says, grinning. ‚ÄúPlus, Chains did the night feeds.‚Äù

‚ÄúLucky you,‚Äù I mumble.

‚ÄúRiggs not helping out?‚Äù she asks, her expression sympathetic.

‚ÄúNot really.‚Äù I try not to tell the girls the exact extent of our problems. They all have their own stuff going on, and honestly, even I‚Äôm sick of hearing myself talk about it. But Leia is Riggs‚Äô sister and I hate putting her in the middle, even though I consider her a good friend. ‚ÄúIn other news, I might be going back to work.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù she asks. ‚ÄúI thought you‚Äôd stay at home with Willow.‚Äù

I shrug. ‚ÄúI need to feel like me again. I love being a mum, but since Reggie, I have this continuous worry that I need to have my own money, just in case.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn case of what?‚Äù she asks. ‚ÄúRiggs would never see you without, you know that, and it‚Äôs not like you two are splitting up or anything,‚Äù she says, laughing. When I don‚Äôt laugh, her smile fades. ‚ÄúAnna?‚Äù

‚ÄúI just need to get back to work. I asked my old boss for my cleaning job back and he said there‚Äôs plenty of work.‚Äù

‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt he a bit of a creeper?‚Äù she asks. ‚ÄúDoes Riggs know about all of this? I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll be keen on you scrubbing floors again.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôll be fine about it. I spoke to him this morning. He just needs time to get used to the idea.‚Äù

She stares at me for a long second. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll be fine? About you working for that creeper? About you scrubbing floors?‚Äù she asks, and I nod. ‚ÄúRight, something‚Äôs going on. Talk to me,‚Äù she says firmly.

The kitchen door opens and Riggs walks in. We fall silent. ‚ÄúAnna wants to go back to work,‚Äù Leia announces and I glare at her.

‚ÄúI know,‚Äù he mutters, switching on the coffee pot.

‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre okay with it?‚Äù she asks.

He shrugs. ‚ÄúI already told her no but looks like she‚Äôs made her mind up if she‚Äôs talking to you about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúHer boss was weird. He fancied Anna and was constantly asking her out,‚Äù she says.

‚ÄúLeia, don‚Äôt say it like it‚Äôs so hard to believe. I was attractive back then,‚Äù I say jokingly but with a hint of seriousness.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not what I meant. You‚Äôre very attractive,‚Äù she snaps. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt she, Riggs?‚Äù He nods and heads for the door. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you care that another man wanted your wife even though she was pregnant at the time?‚Äù snaps Leia. ‚ÄúImagine how he‚Äôll be now she isn‚Äôt pregnant!‚Äù

‚ÄúChrist, Leia, it‚Äôs too early for this trash. Get off my back. If Anna wants to work, then who am I to stop her?‚Äù

He leaves the room and Leia stares wide-eyed at me. ‚ÄúAre you guys splitting up?‚Äù

I shrug because right now, I don‚Äôt know.

# What is ‚ÄãTwin Peaks? The ultimate In-Depth Guide [2025]

twin Peaks. The name evokes‚Äã images of misty forests, cherry pie, damn fine coffee, and a haunting score. But ‚Å£beyond the surface, what *is* twin Peaks? ItS more than just a television ‚Äåshow; it's ‚Å¢a‚Äã cultural phenomenon, a groundbreaking exploration of the‚Å§ human psyche, and a puzzle box that continues to ‚Äåfascinate and confound audiences decades after‚Äå its debut. This guide aims to provide a thorough understanding‚Å§ of Twin ‚Å£Peaks, its layers of meaning,‚Å§ and its enduring legacy.

**A deeper Dive into the‚Å£ Plot**

at its‚Å£ core, Twin Peaks is a murder mystery‚Å§ draped in surrealism.The seemingly idyllic town of ‚Å£Twin Peaks, washington, is shattered by the brutal‚Å£ killing of Laura ‚ÄåPalmer, the homecoming queen. Special Agent ‚ÄçDale ‚Å¢Cooper, an eccentric‚Å¢ FBI ‚Äçagent with a penchant for dreams and intuition, arrives to investigate.

The inquiry quickly reveals that beneath the town's quaint facade lies ‚Äãa dark undercurrent of‚Å¢ secrets, infidelity, ‚Å§drug use, and supernatural forces.Almost everyone‚Äå is hiding something, and the‚Äå picturesque scenery becomes a backdrop for betrayal and despair. Cooper's‚Äç meticulous investigation unveils a web of‚Å¢ interconnected relationships, ultimately leading him to‚Äç the malevolent ‚Äåentity ‚Äãknown as BOB, who possesses human hosts and commits unspeakable acts.

Beyond‚Äå the central plot,‚Å£ Twin Peaks delves into ‚Äåthe lives of numerous ‚Å¢characters, each with thier own complex stories. From‚Äå the grieving parents of laura Palmer to‚Äã the‚Å¢ troubled‚Å§ teenagers navigating love‚Äã and loss, the show paints a vivid portrait of‚Äç a community grappling‚Å£ with its own demons.**The Genius of David Lynch and Mark ‚Å¢Frost**

The distinct atmosphere and unconventional storytelling of Twin Peaks are ‚Å§largely attributed to its ‚Å§creators, David Lynch‚Å¢ and Mark Frost.Lynch's surrealist sensibilities and ‚Äçdreamlike imagery blend seamlessly with Frost's more conventional‚Å§ narrative structures.

Lynch's signature style is evident in‚Äã the show's dream sequences, which are filled with cryptic symbolism and ‚Äåunsettling imagery. These sequences ‚Å£provide clues to the‚Äç mystery and offer glimpses‚Äç into the characters' subconscious minds. Frost's contributions lie in crafting a multi-layered narrative that explores themes of good versus evil, the‚Äå duality of human nature, ‚Å¢and the corruption that can‚Å£ fester beneath even the most wholesome appearances.their collaborative genius created a hybrid of genres, blending‚Äç elements of crime drama, soap opera, horror,‚Å¢ and comedy into a wholly original viewing experience.

**Key ‚ÄåCharacters and Their Significance**

The ‚Å§inhabitants ‚Å§of Twin Peaks are as essential to the show's identity as its plot and atmosphere.Each character contributes to the show's exploration of human nature and the complexities of ‚Å£small-town life.

Special agent Dale Cooper's unwavering ‚Äãoptimism and belief in the power of intuition contrast sharply with the darkness he ‚Äçencounters. His quirky ‚Äåhabits, like his love for coffee and‚Å§ dictating to Diane, make him an endearing and memorable protagonist.

Laura palmer, ‚Äåthough deceased, is omnipresent. ‚Å£Her life and ‚Äçdeath become the focus‚Äã of the investigation,and her troubled past ‚Å£reveals the hidden darkness within Twin Peaks. She functions as both a victim and a symbol of the town's corruption and lost innocence.

Sheriff‚Äå Harry‚Äç S. Truman,a kind and dependable figure,is Cooper's loyal ally and friend. he represents the moral ‚Äãcompass‚Å¢ of‚Äå the town‚Å¢ and ‚Äçprovides a grounding‚Å¢ presence amidst‚Äç the surreal events.

Othre notable‚Äã characters include Audrey Horne, the rebellious and alluring teenager;‚Å¢ Donna Hayward, Laura's ‚Å§best‚Å£ friend, who embarks ‚Äãon her own quest for truth;‚Äç and Benjamin Horne, the wealthy and morally ambiguous businessman.

**The Power of Symbolism and ‚ÄçImagery**

Twin ‚ÄãPeaks is laden with symbolism that enriches the viewing experience and invites viewers to interpret the show on multiple levels. The recurring presence of owls, for instance, ‚Äãserves as a symbol of hidden ‚Äçknowledge and supernatural ‚Äçobservation.The Red Room,‚Å§ a ‚Äãbizarre and dreamlike space, represents the subconscious mind‚Äã and the intersection between the physical‚Äå and spiritual realms.

The show's‚Äã use of imagery is equally‚Äå striking. the lush forests surrounding Twin Peaks create a sense of beauty and mystery, while the dark and foreboding interiors of certain locations hint at the sinister forces at play.These‚Äã symbols ‚Äçand images are not always easily deciphered, adding to ‚Å§the ‚Äåshow's mystique and encouraging viewers to engage actively with‚Äã the narrative.

**Twin Peaks: ‚ÄåThe‚Äç Return (Season 3)**

Decades after the original series concluded,‚Äã David Lynch‚Å¢ and Mark Frost ‚Å£returned to twin Peaks with a third season, frequently enough referred to as‚Å£ ""Twin ‚Å¢Peaks: The Return."" Many consider it a masterpiece‚Äç though it deliberately defies expectations and further complicates the show's mythology.

""The Return"" expands the scope ‚Äçof the Twin Peaks ‚Äçuniverse, introducing new characters and exploring parallel dimensions. It ‚Äådelves deeper ‚Å¢into the themes of‚Äå time, memory, and ‚Äçthe nature of reality, while also revisiting familiar faces ‚Å£and locations. ‚Å£Agent‚Å§ Cooper, fragmented ‚Äåand struggling with‚Å£ his ‚Äãidentity, embarks‚Å¢ on a new journey, culminating in a ‚Å§mind-bending finale that leaves many questions unanswered and encourages further speculation.

""The Return"" is a challenging and rewarding viewing experience that solidifies ‚ÄãTwin Peaks' status as a truly unique and groundbreaking ‚Å§work of television art.

**Legacy and Influence**

Twin Peaks had a profound‚Å§ impact ‚Äçon ‚Å¢the television landscape. Its‚Å§ unconventional storytelling, surreal imagery, and‚Å£ complex characters paved the way for other ‚Äåcritically acclaimed shows such as ""The X-Files,"" ""The‚Å¢ Sopranos,""‚Äç ""Lost,"" and ""Breaking Bad.""

It demonstrated that‚Å¢ television could ‚Äçbe‚Å§ more than ‚Å¢just entertainment; ‚Å¢it‚Äç might very well be ‚Å£art. Twin Peaks‚Å¢ challenged viewers to think critically, ‚Å£embrace ambiguity, and delve into the depths ‚Äåof human experience.

The show's influence extends‚Äç beyond television. It has inspired countless‚Äå artists, musicians, and filmmakers, ‚Äãand its themes and imagery ‚Äçcontinue to resonate with audiences today.

**Practical Data: Where to Watch and Further‚Äç Exploration**

Twin Peaks remains readily accessible to new viewers. the‚Äç original series and ""The Return"" are available ‚Å§on various streaming services, including paramount+. DVDs and ‚Äãblu-rays‚Äå are also available for collectors.

For those seeking to delve ‚Å§deeper into the‚Äå world of‚Å£ Twin‚Å§ peaks, numerous resources are available.‚Å§ There are books ‚Äçanalyzing the show's themes and symbolism, documentaries exploring its production and legacy, and ‚Äçonline communities‚Äå dedicated to discussing its mysteries. Books like ""reflections: An Oral‚Å¢ History of Twin Peaks"" and ‚Äã""David lynch: Interviews"" offer valuable‚Äã insights into‚Å§ the show's creation and interpretation.

Participating in online forums and ‚Å£discussion groups can‚Å¢ enhance understanding and‚Å¢ provide different perspectives on the show's many enigmatic ‚Äåmoments.

**Understanding The Imperative of Ambiguity**

twin Peaks purposely avoids providing ‚Å£easy answers. Many plot points remain unresolved, and characters' motivations remain ambiguous. This purposeful ambiguity is not‚Å§ a flaw but a central element of the show's artistic ‚Äçvision.

Lynch and Frost wanted ‚Å§to ‚Äãcreate a‚Äã viewing experience that encourages active participation and individual interpretation.By leaving questions unanswered, they invite viewers to ‚Äãengage with the material and form their own conclusions.

This requires viewers to embrace uncertainty and accept that some mysteries may never‚Äå be fully solved. The journey of ‚Å¢discovery, the process ‚Äåof grappling with the show's complexities, is what ‚Å§ultimately makes Twin ‚Å§Peaks so rewarding.

**The Musical Landscape of Angelo Badalamenti**

The music of ‚Å¢Twin Peaks, ‚Å§composed by‚Äå Angelo Badalamenti, is as integral to the show's identity ‚Äças its visuals and‚Äå plot.Badalamenti's haunting ‚Å§melodies and atmospheric soundscapes create‚Å¢ a sense of mystery, longing, and ‚Äåemotional depth.

The iconic ""Laura Palmer's Theme"" is‚Äå instantly recognizable and evokes‚Å¢ a sense of melancholy and tragedy. Other memorable pieces, ‚Äãsuch as ""Falling,""‚Äç ""Audrey's dance,"" and ""The‚Å¢ Nightingale,"" contribute to the‚Äã show's ‚Å¢overall atmosphere‚Äå and ‚Å£enhance the emotional impact ‚Äçof key scenes.

badalamenti's music is not simply background accompaniment; ‚Äçit's an active participant in the storytelling, adding ‚Äãlayers of meaning and amplifying the show's themes.

**Why Twin Peaks ‚ÄçStill Matters in 2025**

Even in 2025,Twin Peaks retains its relevance as it transcends the limitations of its time. The core themes of the show ‚Äì the ‚Å§struggle between good and evil, the exploration of ‚Å¢human nature, and the questioning ‚Å§of reality ‚Äì ‚Äåare timeless and universal.

In an era of formulaic ‚Å£television and predictable narratives,Twin Peaks stands ‚Å§out as a bold‚Äå and original work of art. It reminds us that television can be more than just escapism; it can be a medium ‚Äåfor exploring complex ideas and ‚Äçconfronting arduous truths.

1mpsnri,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mpsnri,"Life of coffee farmers in Northern Thailand. Pa Miang, Lampang","I recently started my journey around Thailand to learn and film how the locals in different regions live. This is a different article from what I wrote in another sub. I originally published the experience in the tourism sub, but not many travellers seemed to be interested. I think this sub should be more relevant since I see long-term residents asking what it‚Äôs like to live in rural Thailand, and I mean very rural.¬†

Last May, I was wandering around downtown Lampang and met Komsan, a farmer who drove from a forest village to sell coffee drinks and beans at a weekend market. I introduced myself and had a chat with him. He agreed to take me to the village and allowed me to record the life of his family. The village is called Pa Miang.

A few days afterwards, I woke up around 5 AM and went to his house. His mom was preparing breakfast.¬† There was no microwave in the house. The mother cooked every morning for breakfast and lunch. She cut banana leaves and used them to cook khai pam (spiced grilled eggs) on a charcoal stove. Around 6:30 AM, his sister went to pick green chillis and chayote leaves, all from the family‚Äôs garden. After breakfast, the family headed to the forest to plant more coffee trees. At noon, they came back. In the afternoon, the sister managed the cafe business. The cafe is in a modern building, but the house is made of wood.

They don‚Äôt spend much money on food because they grow most of the stuff on their own or even get some from the forest. Their meals contain more vegetables than meat. In the past, they ate even less meat than now because they had to raise the chicken by themselves. Pork wasn‚Äôt the norm here in the past, but now the locals buy packaged pork from a store. There is no 7-11 in the village, but some locals open small stores that meet your basic needs.

Most villagers are either children aged younger than 10 or those who are over 50 years old. After pathom 4 (grade 9 in the U.S. system), the children are either sent to a school in the nearest town or live with their parents/cousins in downtown Lampang. Those in their 20s-40s work in the cities. A lot of old villagers used to work as construction workers in cities too. They left the village in seasons when there was no agricultural work.

As for Komsan, he grew up poor, so he became a child monk to receive an education. Around 2005, a concrete road and phone networks reached Pa Miang, and an NGO introduced coffee to the locals. Nowadays, he owns over 10,000 coffee trees and a brand of coffee beans, selling the beans directly to cafes and individual consumers.¬†Growing coffee beans keeps older locals occupied during the ""dry seasons"", so they no longer have to work at construction sites away from home.

I ended up living there for 2 weeks and bonded with several families. I carpooled back to downtown Lampang in the village leader's car.

A reminder from me: If you‚Äôd like to visit Pa Miang, try to go there during the winter. It's not that safe when the road is wet in the rainy season. Even worse when the rain falls while you're driving uphill.
