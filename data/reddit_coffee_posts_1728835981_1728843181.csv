I love hiking, reading, movies, and sports, am excited for both the Mets and Yankees series coming up. Right now I'm reading Middle March and Carry on Jeeves, they are very enjoyable. For movies my favorites are 2001, King Kong, and Things to Come, I love old sci-fi to a tee. For hiking, one of the reasons my old job sucked was I can never do it, so thankfully I have infinitely more free time now and am excited to spend it just walking and being outdoors all day, well when I'm not working.

1g2vued,https://www.reddit.com/r/janeausten/comments/1g2vued/how_the_country_gentry_lived_jane_austen_in_style/,"""how the country gentry lived"": ""Jane Austen: In Style"" -- a book by Susan Watkins","A recent find at my local used bookstore in downtown Los Angeles:

**Jane Austen: In Style** by Susan Watkins (Thames and Hudson, London, 1996)

This is a handsome, large-format paperback that is essentially a small coffee table book about how people of Austen's class (and above) lived: what they wore, how they furnished their homes, what kind of homes they lived in, what they ate, and how the entertained themselves. 

Watkins writes in her preface: ""In these pages, from the vantage point of a particular English country gentlewoman, a journey is made through the society and surrounds of a group of people of unsurpassed elegance and refinement."" (I guess she did not mean Mrs. Bennet in that description!)

While the book doesn't really address my Austen interests, it is interesting to see some period drawings of the author's milieu (plus lots of color photographs of interiors and exteriors of country houses).

I added the cover and a page about Repton, the picturesque trend in landscaping, and ""improvement."" 

The book was a gift to ""Julia, fellow Janeite."" :)

1g2vmzg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1g2vmzg/gallstones_club/,Gallstones Club ,"Welp, another one here with gallstones. 

The first attack I had was end of August at which point I was down 17 lbs after 6 weeks in. I took myself to the ER and unfortunately my description of the pain must have sucked because they choose to do a urinalysis and blood test for pancreatic issues and then just chalked it up to muscle issues, and sent me on my way with a muscle relaxer.

Then Friday night, 13 weeks under my belt, down 29.2 lbs, I had another awful attack. I didn't go to the ER because they told me it was muscle strain the first time, so I grinned and bared it for 2 to 3 hours. Heating pad. Ibprofen. Muscle relaxer. Nothing helped. I figured out pacing around my house was less pain than laying down. Finally, decided to take a hot shower to see if that helped. It finally started to calm down to a more tolerable pain. 

I'm telling you, the pain is on par with being in labor with my kids when I had them. 

I now realize I've had at least a couple other shorter small attacks between these events.

So yeahhhh. Yesterday, I shared in my local mom group about the issue and thankgoodness a few woman advised what I described was exactly their experiences with gallbladder / stones.  I called my primary office and spoke with the on call doctor and he advised best to go to ER so they could do an ultrasound. 

Glad I listened to my gut, and went because ding, ding, ding - Gallstones it is. It would have been nice for them to realize this was a possibility back during my August visit. 

Thankfully there was no sign of infection so no need to be admitted to the hospital or emergent surgery. However, I was give  a referral to a surgeon / specialist to meet with.

They advise it can be a wait and see and monitor it approach and maybe try medications... but often, yes, a surgery to just remove the gallbladder is often the case.

I am beyond sad that googling... coffee and tea are a bad idea. I am a daily coffee drinker. However, it sounds like coffee can bring on the contractions of your gallbladder/ attack from what I read and that pain isnt worth it.

1g2vlre,https://www.reddit.com/r/Appliances/comments/1g2vlre/samsung_30cu_mega_capacity_fridge_is_9_days_old/,Samsung 30cu Mega Capacity Fridge is 9 days old and dead. ,"Woken up by my daughter at 3am to tell me our brand new fridge had no lights on and the front screen was off. No power whatsoever. 

Fridge is heavy as hell so I went to check the breaker first. Everything looked good so I had to wrestle the fridge away from the wall to get enough of myself around it to check the plug. Plugged the coffee maker into the outlet and yup it‚Äôs powered on. Took the fridge plug and reached it to another working outlet just to double check and nothing. 

Googled troubleshooting and followed the steps of leaving it unplugged for 5-10 mins to hopefully reset it. Samsung troubleshooting app was useless. Tried to contact customer technical support but a shopping sales support got on instead. Told me that technical is closed on the weekend. 

The sales support team says hey you got Samsung Extended Care so you‚Äôre in luck we have a 24/7 helpline! I call the number and somehow 24/7 doesn‚Äôt include right now apparently. 

Back to sales support and they said oh wow they are closed? Try again at 9am. 

I sadly watched my new freshly stocked dead fridge get warmer by the minute. 9am I get someone from technical support and I immediately open with this machine is 9 days old. No signs of issues beforehand. Here are all the steps I tried in order (listed about) from the Samsung website. He tells me great job and he completely understands my situation. ‚ÄúNow please check the breaker first and then the outlet.‚Äù I did. ‚ÄúNow access the family hub and go to settings‚Äù. There‚Äôs no power. ‚ÄúOk unplug the fridge and wait 5 mins to plug it back in‚Äù. I tried that twice. ‚ÄúOpen the fridge and see if the lights are on.‚Äù 

So it went on like that for a while. They finally agreed to give me the repair team link. The site shows the first availability is Friday. 

I was so happy with it coming from a side by side 2 door GE where every shelf broke in the first 6 months and they wanted over $100+ for replacement parts.

Anybody have a similar issue with there being no power suddenly?

TLDR: 9 day old fridge died randomly in the middle of the night. Troubleshooting tips didn‚Äôt help. Samsung support was taking me in circles. The term 24/7 means something different in Korea I guess. Can‚Äôt get repaired until Friday and I feel like a scammed idiot turd. ",1,1728842336.0,Appliances,0,1.0,False

1g2vl47,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1g2vl47/deconstructing_eden_fall_returning_sampler_set/,Deconstructing Eden fall returning sampler set rambles and a rec request,"i ordered the Fall Sampler set from DE while searching for a holy grail of a pumpkin smell, and was intrigued by the scents that were included alongside Pumpkin‚Äôs Revenge. my personal taste favors androgynous, dark, incense, spicy, and herbal. i let these rest for 12 hours before opening and smelling them, and have worn 3/6 of them. i got two of my housemates to sample these with me, two men who don‚Äôt wear colognes/perfumes and don‚Äôt care about them. this review is kind of incomplete due to only having worn half of them but i wanted to get this out there asap because the season is almost halfway over and i‚Äôll be asking for more recs at the end.



Autumn Drive: *Cool autumn air, asphalt, red maple leaves, redwoods, grey musk, oakwood, flannel, and leather seats.* 

 i get a gentle, tempered version of a ‚Äúnew car smell‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt seem like it will be cloying or artificial when worn. crisp. this gives me the most ‚Äúcold‚Äù scent out of any of them. of the whole sample set, this one was well received, but also the least exciting. all 3 of us liked it well enough. i don‚Äôt really have much else to say tho. i haven‚Äôt worn this yet, only opened it and sniffed it out of the bottle. 2.5/5 for now for being so neutral lol.


Chuseok: *Crisp apples, brown sugar, rice, jujubes (red dates), Korean pear, pine needles, and (vegan) honey.*

FUN!!! this is a bubbly, energetic, BRIGHT apple hard candy smell. i get a floral hint of apple blossoms, or maybe apple skin, as well. we came to the conclusion that this scent reminded us of Manzanita Sol, if anyone remembers that soda. i‚Äôm not sure how this will mesh with my generally muted and sullen vibe when i wear it, but i‚Äôm gonna give it a try. Housemate 1 loved it too. Housemate 2 hated this, saying it was fake, and childish. the label on mine is messed up so the notes will forever remain a mystery to me (i know you can look them up online lol). i haven‚Äôt worn this yet, but i think i‚Äôm going to have fun using the sample, although i doubt i will buy it again. i would recommend this to the right person, however it‚Äôs just not me. 3/5


Lighthouse: *Cardamom coffee, sweetened with vegan honey, worn flannel, silver birch, and coastal redwoods.*

when i tried sniffing this from the bottle, i couldn‚Äôt smell anything at all! sad! housemate 1 hated this and says it smells like rotten vanilla. housemate 2 also cannot smell it. i‚Äôve heard this scent is divisive and has a distinctive presence so i‚Äôm surprised 2/3 of us can‚Äôt even smell it. 

i decided to put this one on one arm and wear it to bed. the lack of a scent was immediately rectified. this smells absolutely incredible to me. the main two notes are of rich, freshly ground, bitter dark coffee beans, and the most perfect flannel/fabric scent i‚Äôve experienced so far, complemented by the birch. this is certainly a darker scent, but the cardamom comes through in waves that sweeten and lighten it up. i‚Äôm actually unable to be objective about this scent, because it‚Äôs overwhelming me with feelings of nostalgia for my childhood, and wearing this perfume is an amazingly comforting experience. it was still wonderfully present on my wrist after a full night‚Äôs sleep, so it has the longevity, but i feel it lacks projection that would make me give it a perfect rating. i have no idea how others might feel about this perfume, but for me? 4/5, instant full size. 


Second Skin: *Cold skin, fog, combat boots, cashmeran, metal accord, raindrops, wet stone.*

from the bottle, none of us can smell this. ?????????? i get maybe a slight hint of cold which seems correct but nothing else. HM1 says they get a brief whiff of leather, as in the ‚Äúcombat boots‚Äù note. HM2 says no smell. 

i decided to put this on and deeply regretted it. if any of you have worked in food service, you will recognize the smell immediately- it‚Äôs the generic pink concentrated hand soap that comes from Cintas. i hate this. 0/5 disgustang


Pumpkin‚Äôs Revenge: *Sweet and buttery pumpkin flesh corrupted with black patchouli, sticky myrrh and smoky oud, all spiked with dark spice on a bed of graveyard dirt.*

i ordered this sampler specifically for this and i am whelmed. i‚Äôm a PSL fan, but i was looking for something more vegetably, with a less sweet and spicy, darker edge to it, which is why i tried this one- the dark patchouli and dirt notes were what persuaded me. my first sniff of the bottle got me interested. i love scents that can change within the same breath, and this one did that for me. the top of the scent is your typical pumpkin spices- sweet nutmeg, clove, and cinnamon; the middle is the fresh pumpkin flesh; the end of the inhale is cold and black dirt. my HMs were both unimpressed but both of them are too cool for PSL and think they‚Äôre cringe, so they weren‚Äôt giving it a proper chance. unfortunately, when i tried this on, it lost almost all of the dark, dirty qualities, and turned into a very nice pumpkin spice scent and not much else. when i‚Äôm wearing it, i got a lovely rice note, which i couldn‚Äôt smell out of the bottle, and i do appreciate, as it dilutes the sweetness of the spices a bit and adds a nice warm body. 

i‚Äôm going to generously give this a 4/5. this is truly a delicious pumpkin spice scent! it‚Äôs spicy and warm without being too syrupy or artificial. many, many people will love this perfume, which is why i rate it so highly! however, it is decidedly not for me, and not at all what i was looking for. 


my bonus gift that i was generously sent, Season of the Witch: *Frankincense, myrrh, sandalwood, vetiver, tonka bean, and a trace of vanilla.*

A MASSIVE HIT. this perfume is a roaring success, first impression 5/5, from all 3 of us. i was expecting something that played to my tastes from the notes, but this shit is literally magic in a bottle. something about the way the notes are blended, or the specific concentration, elevates this above a good indie perfume and makes it give off the impression of a luxury mainstream perfume. we all could not stop sniffing this bottle. i gotta say i‚Äôm not looking forward to wearing this at all because i‚Äôm afraid that little old tomboy me won‚Äôt be able to wear it in a way that does it justice, it‚Äôs simply too sophisticated. HM1 described it as ‚Äúif walking through the perfume section of a department store smelled good.‚Äù HM2 said it smelled sexy and turned him on. as i haven‚Äôt worn this yet, my rating is subject to change depending on projection and longevity, but i may never wear it because i‚Äôm too intimidated lol (j/k i‚Äôm trying this tomorrow for sure) 


thank you for reading this far! and now for my request: PLEASE before the season is over, help me find my white whale pumpkin scent. üôè

wants: pumpkin flesh, vines, leaves, decay, dirty, sticky, resinous, patchouli or pine ok, dark green or black vibes. 

absolutely no: pumpkin spices, tea tree/mentholy pine, smoky, cannabis, orange and sunny vibes.

i think most of you know me here, however let‚Äôs leave what‚Äôs in the past in the past.
despite that i want advice on a separate problem so please don‚Äôt bring anything else into it please, so i‚Äôm 17F and my bf is 20M, we live across sea around 16 hours by plane so as you can see it‚Äôs pretty hard to see each other and a lot of money! every single time he has visited and stayed with me he has gotten the money from his dad, i appreciate his dad so so much for this, anyways this time his dad has said i can‚Äôt keep paying and i agree 100% he is 20 in university and independent now and shouldn‚Äôt rely on his dad. so he goes to army( everyone in korea has to go for 18 months) in december  next year,  and due 
to school schedules and money we have decided he will come visit whenever we have the money but i‚Äôll 100% be going 
next summer in july. 

So obviously to see each other, we need money‚Ä¶ and fast and being in full time school that‚Äôs pretty tricky, i‚Äôve worked so hard this whole relationship (5 years) i go to school whole week and have worked at bars, coffee shops and shops, at the moment i‚Äôm working 2 jobs around 20-25 hours a week on weekends and if i can after school, i sell on vinted for extra cash. This man has not done one thing‚Ä¶ i‚Äôll be at work and i‚Äôll see he has played video games for 8 hours on steam and i‚Äôll just get so helpless knowing how hard i‚Äôm trying he sleeps at 8am and wake up at 5pm, i tell him he needs to get his life straight but he is so so so defensive you can‚Äôt say a thing seriously he flips out like crazy. he can‚Äôt get a job really as his uni is literally in a remote area 1 hour from city but i just wished he would at least look and try despite it being hard, he has only applied to one job. 

He is really lovely to me he tells me how beautiful i am and how much he loves me but words can only mean so much, i can‚Äôt work so hard and have someone be so so lazy and in denial about it, i truly truly with all my heart love him despite his imperfections but this is too much, he never goes out, doesn‚Äôt see anyone sleeps so so late, he goes to his lectures which is good but will come home sleep wake up and play games for 6-8 hours, he will facetime me but it‚Äôll be silent because he is playing. he has played 180 hours the last 2 weeks‚Ä¶ i just can‚Äôt, i wouldn‚Äôt mind if he has a job, he has never had one and is 20. 
someone help what do i do? sorry again this makes me sound stupid for putting up with it but i genuinely want to be with this man for rest of my life despite how he can be.",2,1728842099.0,LongDistance,2,1.0,False

My 4mo baby has been diagnosed with allergic colitis, non IgE mediated and put on neocate.  He hates it and wouldn't drink it one bit, and I also want to continue breastfeeding him.

His symptoms were severe mucus in stool and he had small amount of blood twice in his diaper. He is in a lot of pain all the time, and very unsettled...

I've cut out dairy 3 months ago, wheat 2 months ago, corn/soy/grains 1 month ago and fish/chicken/eggs/tree nuts about 2 weeks ago.

I've been eating beef and avocado for the last 1 1/2 weeks, only to notice he can't tolerate avocado.

He spits up after feeds if I eat bananas or other fruit.

I'm down to eating beef and zuccini, which he seems more or less ok with. He has had 2 normal diapers with little mucus, only for me to find another mucus filled diaper today.

Lagi silang partner to every project na ma-assign sa kanya. And I‚Äôm aware na every project ay lagi n‚Äôyang pinapapunta sa bahay si girl para dun na lang sila mag discuss about the project.

Last Saturday may f2f class ako 3-9 pm at nagpaalam rin s‚Äôya sakin na bibisita ang mga kaibigan n‚Äôyang lalaki sa bahay kung saan din ako umuuwi. I had this feeling of doubt, like girls instinct. I knew it already, he‚Äôs meeting his girl partner(consultant) sa bahay. For me okay lang naman, kasi I understand his profession. Ang problema lang ay bakit kailangan n‚Äôya pang magsinungaling sakin.

6pm class dismissed and I received a text from him, ‚ÄòAndito pa sina (friend n‚Äôya na lalaki), ‚Äòwag ka muna umuwi dito. Mag-coffee ka muna. Chat na lang kita ‚Äòpag tapos na kami.‚Äô

So I followed what he instructed to me. I was at the coffee shop at 7 until 8:30 pm, hindi pa s‚Äôya nag-text. I got bored at pagod rin sa klase so I decided to go home. Nandoon lang ako sa labas, sa kalsada, I was there for 30 mins standing at sakto lumabas s‚Äôya and I was shocked kasi ang kasama n‚Äôyang lumabas ay yung babaeng partner n‚Äôya sa consultancy. Nagtago lang ako sa madilim na part ng lugar namin and waited for them to passed by. 

I took a picture of them, inihatid n‚Äôya ‚Äòyung girl palabas. Hindi n‚Äôya alam, na alam kong nagsinungaling s‚Äôya sakin tungkol dito, hanggang ngayon, dahil ayokong mag-away na naman kami. I acted coldly, and he‚Äôs confused about my action.

I cried that night, while he‚Äôs sleeping peacefully. I don‚Äôt know what to feel. Am I overthinking about things? I need an advice po. :(

it made me wonder, why do i want to miss all of this? why do i seek to numb myself, to tune out? i love this life. 

but addiction is a strange, sneaky monster. i‚Äôve had these thoughts before only to fall back into the deep, dark pit of sinking sand that is alcoholism. 

my alcoholism is a particular type of monster. a monster that isn‚Äôt satisfied until every drop in the bottle is gone. when it takes hold, i will sacrifice everything i hold dearest to me for reasons i couldn‚Äôt even begin to attempt to describe. in sobriety, it makes little sense, even to me. 

over last weekend, i recall being so drunk that i felt like i was seeing the world through a distant tunnel; barely able to act, react, or speak- just observing my surroundings half aware, drowsy, and sick. 

nothing bad happened- ive always been a reclusive, sleepy drunk- im not a mean drunk or a destructive drunk. i just tune out. i miss entire afternoons, days, weekends; undetermined amounts of time where i am in and out of sleep with a bottle next to me. 

i destroy my body, my mind, my spirit. i cut people out. i break the hearts of those around me who are watching me as i pull away from reality and sink further into the dark parts of myself; those parts that are still trapped in past trauma. 

i will fight for myself, i will keep trying to break the cycle, and i will cling fiercely onto what is left of myself. i want to live this life so, so badly without being controlled by the poison that once tricked me into believing it could make me feel okay, only to turn on me and create a living hell.

# Key Benefits of Tea Burn

* Boosts metabolism naturally
* Supports fat burning
* Suppresses appetite and cravings
* Provides lasting energy
* Easy to incorporate into daily routine

But does Tea Burn live up to these bold claims? Let‚Äôs dive deeper into the science behind its ingredients.

# How Does Tea Burn Work?

Tea Burn works by using a proprietary blend of ingredients that work synergistically to support your body‚Äôs fat-burning mechanisms. The idea behind this supplement is that tea, especially green tea, is already known for its metabolism-boosting properties. Tea Burn aims to amplify those benefits by introducing ingredients that enhance the effects of the tea you‚Äôre drinking.

Here‚Äôs how Tea Burn works step-by-step:

* **Boosts Metabolism**: The ingredients in Tea Burn are designed to increase your metabolic rate, allowing your body to burn more calories, even at rest.
* **Thermogenesis**: Tea Burn promotes thermogenesis, a process where the body produces heat, burning more calories in the process.
* **Appetite Suppression**: By reducing your hunger and cravings, Tea Burn helps you consume fewer calories throughout the day, contributing to a calorie deficit.
* **Energy Boost**: Tea Burn also contains ingredients that provide a clean energy boost without the jittery feeling often associated with other weight loss supplements.
* **Fat Oxidation**: By enhancing fat oxidation, Tea Burn helps your body utilize stored fat for energy.

# Ingredients in Tea Burn

Tea Burn‚Äôs formula is made up of a few key ingredients, all of which are backed by research for their ability to support weight loss. Let‚Äôs take a closer look at each ingredient:

# 1. Green Tea Extract

Green tea is one of the most popular ingredients in weight loss supplements, and for good reason. It‚Äôs packed with antioxidants, particularly EGCG (Epigallocatechin gallate), which has been shown to boost metabolism and enhance fat burning. Studies suggest that EGCG helps increase the breakdown of fat in your body, allowing it to be used as energy more efficiently.

**Research Insight**: Studies have found that green tea extract can boost calorie burning by 4% and fat oxidation by 17%, even at rest.

# 2. L-Theanine

L-Theanine is an amino acid commonly found in tea leaves. It‚Äôs known for promoting relaxation and reducing stress levels. One of the key reasons this ingredient is included in Tea Burn is because stress and high cortisol levels can lead to weight gain, especially in the abdominal area. By promoting a calm and relaxed state, L-Theanine helps balance your hormones and can indirectly support weight loss.

**Research Insight**: A 2016 study found that L-Theanine, in combination with caffeine, can lead to enhanced cognitive performance and improved fat oxidation during exercise.

‚úÖ[**Currently the Top Tea Burn Formula on the Market is now available on Sale ‚Äî Limited Time Offer**](https://tinyurl.com/3uus4sns)



# 3. Chromium

Chromium is an essential mineral that plays a role in regulating blood sugar levels. By maintaining stable blood sugar levels, chromium helps prevent cravings and hunger spikes that can lead to overeating. It also helps your body metabolize fats and carbohydrates more efficiently, further supporting your weight loss goals.

**Research Insight**: Research shows that chromium supplementation can reduce body fat and promote lean muscle mass in individuals trying to lose weight.

# 4. Caffeine

Caffeine is a well-known stimulant that increases metabolism and enhances fat burning. It also provides an energy boost, helping you stay active and focused throughout the day. In combination with the other ingredients in Tea Burn, caffeine helps you stay energized and burn more calories, even during workouts.

**Research Insight**: A 2019 study in the¬†*American Journal of Clinical Nutrition*¬†found that caffeine increases fat oxidation by 10-29%, depending on the individual‚Äôs body fat percentage.

# 5. Chlorogenic Acid

Chlorogenic acid is found in coffee beans and is known for its fat-burning properties. It helps to slow the absorption of carbohydrates in the gut, which reduces blood sugar spikes and can prevent fat storage. Chlorogenic acid also promotes fat breakdown and helps regulate cholesterol levels, further aiding weight loss.

**Research Insight**: A 2020 study showed that participants who took chlorogenic acid experienced significant weight loss and reduced body fat compared to the control group.

* **Thermogenesis**: Tea Burn promotes thermogenesis, a process where the body produces heat, burning more calories in the process.

# Ingredients in Tea Burn

Tea Burn‚Äôs formula is made up of a few key ingredients, all of which are backed by research for their ability to support weight loss. Let‚Äôs take a closer look at each ingredient:

# 1. Green Tea Extract

Green tea is one of the most popular ingredients in weight loss supplements, and for good reason. It‚Äôs packed with antioxidants, particularly EGCG (Epigallocatechin gallate), which has been shown to boost metabolism and enhance fat burning. Studies suggest that EGCG helps increase the breakdown of fat in your body, allowing it to be used as energy more efficiently.

**Research Insight**: Studies have found that green tea extract can boost calorie burning by 4% and fat oxidation by 17%, even at rest.

# 2. L-Theanine

L-Theanine is an amino acid commonly found in tea leaves. It‚Äôs known for promoting relaxation and reducing stress levels. One of the key reasons this ingredient is included in Tea Burn is because stress and high cortisol levels can lead to weight gain, especially in the abdominal area. By promoting a calm and relaxed state, L-Theanine helps balance your hormones and can indirectly support weight loss.

**Research Insight**: A 2016 study found that L-Theanine, in combination with caffeine, can lead to enhanced cognitive performance and improved fat oxidation during exercise.

‚úÖ[**Currently the Top Tea Burn Formula on the Market is now available on Sale ‚Äî Limited Time Offer**](https://tinyurl.com/3uus4sns)



# 3. Chromium

Chromium is an essential mineral that plays a role in regulating blood sugar levels. By maintaining stable blood sugar levels, chromium helps prevent cravings and hunger spikes that can lead to overeating. It also helps your body metabolize fats and carbohydrates more efficiently, further supporting your weight loss goals.

**Research Insight**: Research shows that chromium supplementation can reduce body fat and promote lean muscle mass in individuals trying to lose weight.

# 4. Caffeine

Caffeine is a well-known stimulant that increases metabolism and enhances fat burning. It also provides an energy boost, helping you stay active and focused throughout the day. In combination with the other ingredients in Tea Burn, caffeine helps you stay energized and burn more calories, even during workouts.

**Research Insight**: A 2019 study in the¬†*American Journal of Clinical Nutrition*¬†found that caffeine increases fat oxidation by 10-29%, depending on the individual‚Äôs body fat percentage.

# 5. Chlorogenic Acid

Chlorogenic acid is found in coffee beans and is known for its fat-burning properties. It helps to slow the absorption of carbohydrates in the gut, which reduces blood sugar spikes and can prevent fat storage. Chlorogenic acid also promotes fat breakdown and helps regulate cholesterol levels, further aiding weight loss.

**Research Insight**: A 2020 study showed that participants who took chlorogenic acid experienced significant weight loss and reduced body fat compared to the control group.

* Boosts metabolism naturally
* Supports fat burning
* Suppresses appetite and cravings
* Provides lasting energy
* Easy to incorporate into daily routine

But does Tea Burn live up to these bold claims? Let‚Äôs dive deeper into the science behind its ingredients.

# How Does Tea Burn Work?

Tea Burn works by using a proprietary blend of ingredients that work synergistically to support your body‚Äôs fat-burning mechanisms. The idea behind this supplement is that tea, especially green tea, is already known for its metabolism-boosting properties. Tea Burn aims to amplify those benefits by introducing ingredients that enhance the effects of the tea you‚Äôre drinking.

Here‚Äôs how Tea Burn works step-by-step:

* **Boosts Metabolism**: The ingredients in Tea Burn are designed to increase your metabolic rate, allowing your body to burn more calories, even at rest.
* **Thermogenesis**: Tea Burn promotes thermogenesis, a process where the body produces heat, burning more calories in the process.
* **Appetite Suppression**: By reducing your hunger and cravings, Tea Burn helps you consume fewer calories throughout the day, contributing to a calorie deficit.
* **Energy Boost**: Tea Burn also contains ingredients that provide a clean energy boost without the jittery feeling often associated with other weight loss supplements.
* **Fat Oxidation**: By enhancing fat oxidation, Tea Burn helps your body utilize stored fat for energy.

# [Get Instant Access To Tea Burn (Money-Back Guarantee)](https://tinyurl.com/3uus4sns)

# Ingredients in Tea Burn

Tea Burn‚Äôs formula is made up of a few key ingredients, all of which are backed by research for their ability to support weight loss. Let‚Äôs take a closer look at each ingredient:

# 1. Green Tea Extract

Green tea is one of the most popular ingredients in weight loss supplements, and for good reason. It‚Äôs packed with antioxidants, particularly EGCG (Epigallocatechin gallate), which has been shown to boost metabolism and enhance fat burning. Studies suggest that EGCG helps increase the breakdown of fat in your body, allowing it to be used as energy more efficiently.

**Research Insight**: Studies have found that green tea extract can boost calorie burning by 4% and fat oxidation by 17%, even at rest.

# 2. L-Theanine

L-Theanine is an amino acid commonly found in tea leaves. It‚Äôs known for promoting relaxation and reducing stress levels. One of the key reasons this ingredient is included in Tea Burn is because stress and high cortisol levels can lead to weight gain, especially in the abdominal area. By promoting a calm and relaxed state, L-Theanine helps balance your hormones and can indirectly support weight loss.

**Research Insight**: A 2016 study found that L-Theanine, in combination with caffeine, can lead to enhanced cognitive performance and improved fat oxidation during exercise.

# 3. Chromium

Chromium is an essential mineral that plays a role in regulating blood sugar levels. By maintaining stable blood sugar levels, chromium helps prevent cravings and hunger spikes that can lead to overeating. It also helps your body metabolize fats and carbohydrates more efficiently, further supporting your weight loss goals.

**Research Insight**: Research shows that chromium supplementation can reduce body fat and promote lean muscle mass in individuals trying to lose weight.

# 4. Caffeine

Caffeine is a well-known stimulant that increases metabolism and enhances fat burning. It also provides an energy boost, helping you stay active and focused throughout the day. In combination with the other ingredients in Tea Burn, caffeine helps you stay energized and burn more calories, even during workouts.

**Research Insight**: A 2019 study in the¬†*American Journal of Clinical Nutrition*¬†found that caffeine increases fat oxidation by 10-29%, depending on the individual‚Äôs body fat percentage.

# 5. Chlorogenic Acid

Chlorogenic acid is found in coffee beans and is known for its fat-burning properties. It helps to slow the absorption of carbohydrates in the gut, which reduces blood sugar spikes and can prevent fat storage. Chlorogenic acid also promotes fat breakdown and helps regulate cholesterol levels, further aiding weight loss.

**Research Insight**: A 2020 study showed that participants who took chlorogenic acid experienced significant weight loss and reduced body fat compared to the control group.

 ","# The Science Behind Tea and Metabolism

As someone who has always been intrigued by the world of wellness and natural remedies, I can say that understanding metabolism is pivotal when it comes to achieving and maintaining a healthy weight. Metabolism is like your body‚Äôs engine, converting what we eat into energy, and many of us know firsthand how frustrating it can be when that engine seems to be running on low fuel. Did you know that studies suggest a whopping 80% of Americans have inherited a slower metabolism? This news can come as a shocker, but it also brings us to a fascinating discovery: tea, particularly when combined with certain super-nutrients, has the potential to rev up our metabolic rate significantly.

Upon digging deeper, I learned about the powerhouse ingredients behind Tea Burn: key nutrients like chlorogenic acid, L-carnitine, and the ever-popular Camellia sinensis (the tea plant itself). Each of these components serves a specific purpose. For instance,¬†**chlorogenic acid**¬†not only supports metabolism but also helps maintain healthy insulin levels and blood sugar.¬†**L-carnitine**¬†has a well-established reputation for aiding in fat-burning and nutrient absorption, which is an essential benefit for someone like me who‚Äôs conscious about getting the most out of my diet. And let‚Äôs not forget the calming effect of¬†**L-theanine**, which not only reduces hunger but also enhances cognitive function ‚Äî definitely something I appreciate during busy workdays.

Edited to add-3b. Because I can‚Äôt use taller glasses, I can‚Äôt make iced milk drinks either.
4. I can‚Äôt brew coffee without the drip tray, & my travel thermoses are too tall to fit underneath on the drip tray.

She is the youngest in her household but her parents are in their 70s and pay for her expenses. She says she has depression but her therapist disagrees, everyone in her household babies her to the point she doesn't even do chores.  

Everytime I meet her, I pay her Ubers and whatever activity we do, at first this didn't bother me untill I found out her mom had been giving her money to spend with me and she never used it. (Though it may be petty to keep tabs on how much I'd spend, I wpuld usually go over 50USD each time we hung out~aprox. 1000 MX peso). 

On several occasions she invited me to her house to just chill. (She lives with her 70y/o parents, and 3 older siblings and their spouses and children, 15 birds, 4chickens, 4 dogs, 2 iguanas, and 1 duck). I usually don't like going because her house is always loud and busy and I'm overwhelmed but the few times I've gone I get physically sick. I understand her parents not being able to do chores but she is capable and doesn't even clean her room. Dog fur, duck and chicken feathers fly around and no one bats an eye. (Her house is average in MX, definitely not a farm)

Anyways, last Monday I went to her house and took a box of donuts, I was greeted by her whole family and sat at the table with them to eat the donuts with some homemade canela coffee. Everything was fine until her dog jumped on the table and just stared at me (begging for food) THE DOG WAS ON THE DINNING TABLE! I was uncomfortable since I had been attacked by a dog when I was little and had to get rabies shots, so usually her dogs are put away but this time they weren't. 

I asked her to put her dogs away because it made me uncomfortable, and in all honesty disgusted by the fact it sat on the table. All she said was ""it doesn't bite"" and ignored me. I asked again and she just said ""ignore him and he'll go away"".After what seemed 5 minutes of a staring contest with the dog, I was fed up and stood up, told her im leaving, this caused her family to start telling me to stay, I explained why I don't like untrained dogs, excused myseld and just left.

She later send me a WhatsApp to tell me I was an ass for calling her dogs untrained and causing a scene infront of her family. The thing is I don't think I did something wrong, AITAH? I set my boundaries with her and her pets, she respected them temporarily and then  glossed over it.

1g2v2p4,https://www.reddit.com/r/budget/comments/1g2v2p4/tips_for_budget_tracking_on_joint_cc/,Tips for budget tracking on joint CC?,"So I've never really had a 'budget' per se, but I've known my fixed expenses and been fairly good at saving a good portion of what's leftover just by continuously checking my spending and moving money to savings. It was something like a vague budget, because lets say I get paid and I move $500 to savings after leaving a general set amount in my chequing, maybe an extra health expense came up or a good sale on some clothes I wanted, I didn't really fuss too much about moving $300 back into my chequing for that month. I didn't really have a 'goal' outside of the general idea that saving money is good, so the goal was just for it to keep going upwards regardless by how much. 

Now I've graduated, I'm working full time, and my partner and I want to buy a place together - it's clear I need to get more granular about my spending and focused on specific savings goals. I also have a more set schedule than I did as a student, so if I don't meal prep on Sundays I'm basically screwed into spending $16-25/workday, because I have zero energy for cooking after work. (I'm still confused as to how people work out and do social things on top of work during the week because I feel like just laying down all the time now). 

Because I've been a student with low income until very recently, my credit score is not very good, even though I have no debt. So part of our plan to make it better is using a joint credit card with a higher limit for everything and keep paying it off to build credit (as mine was not good enough to get a higher limit on my own). This credit card also has good benefits like points we can use for travel.

But because I'm used to checking on my expenses every day or every other day, having a monthly pay off with the credit amount being so high is weird to me. I get anxious when there is a balance at all and want to clear it immediately. I'm also not always sure which of us went to Tim Hortons on which day, for example. The gap between posted and processed transactions is also a confusion point. I will sometimes pay off a $300 expense, but because it was only posted and not processed, I will make a mistake and pay it off twice, or not be sure I paid it, because the two line items aren't right next to each other. 

I guess basically my standard system of just looking at my account every day is no longer helping me keep on top of everything, because it's all mixed together. So I'm wondering if there are any tips to help work on this? 

I've started getting a bit better about spending by making tea at work instead of buying coffees as much, and I'm really working on the meal prep, but I still feel a bit confused about tracking on the credit card. It's not like we don't pay it off all the time, but I feel less organized about it all and would like to do better - especially because I'm working on saving for our place.

Jenna Thompson and Emma Carter, though living 2,000 miles apart, unknowingly shared the same desire: to finally break free from the stubborn weight that had been dragging them down.

**Jenna‚Äôs Journey Begins in Seattle**

Jenna, a 38-year-old graphic designer living in Seattle, was no stranger to juggling multiple responsibilities. Between raising her seven-year-old son, Noah, and managing a busy career, her health often took a back seat. Over time, she had gained extra weight, mostly around her midsection, and no matter what she tried‚Äîdiets, exercise plans, you name it‚Äîthe scale barely budged. The feeling of being stuck became all too familiar.

One rainy Saturday morning, as she sipped her coffee and scrolled through her phone, she stumbled upon a blog post about something called Java Burn. The idea seemed almost too good to be true: a supplement that you could easily mix into your coffee without changing the taste, made with natural ingredients like green tea extract and chlorogenic acid, designed to boost your metabolism and help you lose weight.

At first, Jenna was skeptical. Like many, she‚Äôd been burned by the promises of weight loss products before. But the 60-day money-back guarantee convinced her to give it a try. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the worst that could happen?‚Äù she thought. So, she ordered her first pack of Java Burn and figured she‚Äôd see if it lived up to the hype.

[Java Burn](https://preview.redd.it/5x87xsa1xgud1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=7aacda8be41730bd1b43dfebf7d81028c86bb5a8)

**Emma‚Äôs Turning Point in Chicago**

Meanwhile, over in Chicago, 39-year-old Emma Carter was facing her own challenges. As a marketing executive, Emma‚Äôs days were long, stressful, and filled with back-to-back meetings. She relied on coffee to get through the day but felt drained and exhausted. The extra pounds around her waist weren‚Äôt helping either. Despite trying every diet under the sun, she couldn‚Äôt seem to shake the weight.

One evening, Emma was scrolling through her favorite health blog when she came across an article about Java Burn‚Äîthe same product Jenna had discovered. Intrigued by the idea of a weight loss solution that fit effortlessly into her morning coffee routine, she decided to take a chance and order it. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve tried everything else,‚Äù she thought, ‚Äúwhy not this?‚Äù

**The Start of Something New**

In just a few days, both Jenna and Emma had their Java Burn packets. Mixing the powder into their morning coffee was simple, and they were pleased that it didn‚Äôt change the flavor. But the real surprise came in the following weeks. For Jenna, the first thing she noticed was an increase in her energy levels. No more afternoon crashes or mindless snacking. She felt lighter, both physically and mentally, and even her son, Noah, noticed she had more energy to play with him.

Emma, too, started to see changes. She felt more focused at work and wasn‚Äôt reaching for sugary snacks during the day. The best part? She began losing weight‚Äîslowly but steadily. Both women, living separate lives in different cities, were experiencing the same transformation.

**New Friends, Shared Success**

As fate would have it, Jenna and Emma‚Äôs paths crossed, though not directly. Jenna had shared her experience with her friend, Lisa, who decided to give Java Burn a try as well. At the same time, Emma told her best friend, Sarah, about the supplement, and Sarah joined her on the journey. Through mutual connections, Lisa and Sarah introduced Jenna and Emma to each other, and the four of them formed a small support group, sharing their successes and struggles.

The group quickly became a source of motivation and encouragement. They swapped healthy recipes, discussed workout routines, and checked in with each other regularly. When Jenna hit a plateau and started to feel frustrated, her friends reminded her of how far she‚Äôd come. Emma, too, found support on days when she felt like her progress was slowing down.

**Overcoming Challenges Together**

Of course, the journey wasn‚Äôt always easy. Jenna found it hard to keep her motivation up when the scale didn‚Äôt move as fast as she wanted. Emma had moments where she wondered if she‚Äôd ever reach her goal weight. But both women learned that progress isn‚Äôt always linear‚Äîand that‚Äôs okay. With their friends by their side, they kept pushing forward, celebrating each small victory along the way.

Over time, Jenna lost 25 pounds, and Emma shed 10. But the real success wasn‚Äôt just in the weight loss‚Äîit was how much better they felt overall. Jenna loved being able to keep up with her son, and Emma found herself feeling more confident and capable at work.

**A New Chapter of Health and Happiness**

Months later, the group decided to celebrate their achievements with a small gathering. Jenna, Emma, Lisa, and Sarah reflected on how far they had come, not just in their weight loss journeys but in their overall health. Java Burn had been the spark, but it was their dedication, friendship, and support that truly made the difference.

For Jenna and Emma, the experience wasn‚Äôt just about losing weight. It was about regaining control of their lives, building meaningful connections, and realizing that change is possible when you have the right tools and the right people around you.

**Final Thoughts**

If you‚Äôve been struggling with weight loss or feel stuck in your routine, Jenna and Emma‚Äôs story shows that it‚Äôs never too late to make a change. Sometimes, it‚Äôs the small, simple adjustments‚Äîlike adding Java Burn to your morning coffee‚Äîthat can lead to big results. And having a support system, whether it‚Äôs friends, family, or an online community, makes all the difference. So, if you‚Äôre ready to take that first step, don‚Äôt be afraid to try something new. You might just surprise yourself. **Start your transformation today with Java Burn, which will make a difference in your way of life.**¬†[https://javaburn.com/](https://freezegluco.com/Javaburn.html)",1,1728840732.0,PopularSupplements,0,1.0,False

My wife is going through chemotherapy for ovarian cancer.  Prognosis is good, and we're going to come out on the end of this ok and all good.

My real question revolves around drinking:  Going out to a bar sucks because, if you don't know this, chemotherapy patients typically develop a cold sensitivity (we certainly didn't know this).  When I say cold sensitivity I mean, cannot grab something out of the freezer with a bare hand as it will feels like one has grabbed a hunk of liquid nitrogen mixed with jagged glass.  She cannot drink a cold drink as it feels like a mix of lava and nails being dumped down your throat.  To the point where she gags, can't breathe.      And its one of those things that when you've gone through your entire life not thinking about this sort of thing, you just don't realize how ubiquitous cold drinks and cold things are.  No actual ""damage"" is occurring, just nervous system is hypersensitive to cold.   Even water out of the tap thats barely less than room temperature can be a problem.  No idea why this happens as a side effect of chemo but it happens.

So...  to the actual question.  When one goes through chemo, you are told that when you have ""I feel good"" days, and good moments, you take advantage and sorta drop everything to actually enjoy it.  Thus when those feel good moments come to pass, we go out.  Do some things, hit the park, hit a bar, play some games/pool/whatever, and have a drink or two.   The problem is, she can't drink stuff thats cold, which is 99% of everything at a bar.  She's not a red wine person, which is generally the only drink that isn't cold.

As bartenders, what are you suggestions as to mixed drinks that aren't cold?  Figure she can get through something thats room temp.  So, is a martini thats not chilled good?  What sort of suggestions for some not-chilled"" drinks?   We've had some luck with the odd place or two that whip up hot toddie type drinks.  Coffee drinks are fine, but caffeine has its own issues (and she has enough trouble sleeping without a dose of caffeine  at 8pm).

Also, how is it best to order these sorts of things without coming across as arrogant/entitled bar patron?  I only ask as most places, no issue, but have gotten a few eyerolls when ask for water with no ice, things like that.  Note: also kinda trying to be low key about it.  I mean, its one of those things where, when she's trying to ""feel like a normal human"" and gets embarrassed about asking for stuff without having to describe why.  If thats what needs to happen, i get it.  But its just one of those,  trying to have a little drink and play that bar shuffleboard game and forget the cancer for an hour or so she feels self conscious and doesn't want to go through the whole spiel (and when I volunteer to be the one to ask,  she doesn't want me to have to say anything either üòá )

Also note: oncologist has stated a drink or 3 during the off week of chemo is ok.

Hi everyone! 

This is my first time posting here so I apologize if this goes against any of the sub rules somehow! I'm looking for some MF dark romance recommendations.

I am currently reading Beautiful Villain by Rebecca F. Kenney and I'm definitely enjoying the vampire aspect - more than I expected. So I'm okay with light fantasy but I'm newer to those books. 

I am not interesting in any MMC cheating/OW plots! This is an automatic no for me. I would honestly prefer a book without a third act breakup/more external conflict than internal if possible. I also don't like pregnancy plots (unless it's in the epilogue). 

As for the MMC..I like a morally grey character. I want an MMC that is obsessed with the FMC from the start. Specifically though, I'm looking for an MMC that is soft with the FMC, but hard with everyone else. Very much an 'i'll do anything for you, you're mine' kind of vibe. I don't want an MMC that is a player or a party boy. So not any books that revolve around nightlife/partying heavily. 

I would love if the FMC was a baker/worked at a bakery or coffee shop but that is a minor detail! I would like an FMC that is artsy/quieter. I have no problems with a 'not like other girls' FMC. I don't necessarily want an FMC who's overly worried about 'doing the right thing', but she also doesn't have to be as 'dark' as the MMC. More of an 'that's not really my business/keep me out of it' sort of vibe. 

I want the relationship between the two MC's to be protective. I would love if there were scenes where the FMC needs the MMC's protection or where the MMC needs comforting from the FMC. 

I think I would like arraigned marriage books/they could fit this vibe without being overly dark. I'm not interested in anything that revolves around the underworld, I would rather a book that is slightly realistic but also dark (more so mafia/criminal than supernatural/demons if that makes sense). I like age gap books and I don't really have any limits otherwise. I'm a sucker for workplace romances but I don't know how well that fits into dark romance. 

I know this is a long post so I apologize! My final request is I want the book to focus primarily on the relationship between the characters, and I would like a dual POV if possible. 

Thanks so much for your help! I haven't read many books in this genre so I am open to anything y'all recommend! ",1,1728840598.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

Great weather in October, very safe feeling city and really walkable - you soon get to know the main areas after just a few days. Lots of traffic and construction.

Food and drink: quite varied and very good prices. We were spending around ‚Ç¨15-20 for dinner and ‚Ç¨5-10 for breakfast. Coffee around ‚Ç¨1, beer ‚Ç¨2, cocktails ‚Ç¨8+.

Payment: we were told before going that very few places take card so we made sure to take enough cash. This wasn't necessary and I used Google pay a lot to pay in Lek. Some places were cash only but very few. I wouldn't bother taking 3 days of cash.

Service: service can be neutral to the point of nearly rude but that's the Balkans and Eastern Europe for you. It's nothing personal but worth considering. We also spotted a lot of waiters trying to add ludicrous tips to bills. Someone got stung for a ‚Ç¨5 tip on a ‚Ç¨4 Pepsi at the Sky Club on the table next to us. Similar story at Millennium Garden.

Review farming: beware fake or forced Google reviews, we've travelled a lot and this is the first time we've seen such systematic abuse of the review system from waiters. Look out for patterns of 5 star reviews with random names in. We got stung for that with an awful meal at Ceren Ismet Shehu. There are some genuinely great places, just learn to spot the fakes.

People: people in general are extremely kind, polite and helpful. A nice vibe all around. 

Tirana: enough to do for two days but not much beyond that. We took a tour to Bovilla lake which was worth it. If we came back, which we probably will, we'd likely go to the coast.

Recommended: walking tour, House of Leaves, Bovilla lake, Blloku in general, Arabesque Restaurant, Nouvelle Vague, Burek Special Luani, Te Met Kodra, Le Bon Tirana, Sky Bar (for sunset only, drinks way over priced and rip off waiters).

Avoid: Ceren Ismet Shehu - absolutely terrible food, service and pricing. Numerous reports of waiters taking phones off people to write reviews of themselves. 

Millennium Garden - nice vibe and good location but over priced rubbish and very poor service.

They will stalk their victims, follow them at night, watch them in the day. Go through their mail, sniff their dirty laundry, and learn exactly when and where to strike.

Usually Snipers like to fire on their targets from above, but the following example killed her victims from below, defying conventional wisdom on the tactics of a sharpshooters always shooting from above. All they need is one clean shot, and that's exactly what Kenya Mabuwa did from her bedroom window.

It was confusing at first, following conventional wisdom, I searched the 1 to 3 floors above the victims, just like the books say... but found nothing but red herrings. Innocent families just getting by, a wealthy landlord with a 0:00 to 0:00 job and a Million Crow$ in the bank. A bad mouthed shut-in with a love of Deer Hunting and an expensive Shotgun... beat the hell out of him thinking he was my man... but the Enforcers said I didn't have the evidence... So I kept digging. But while I was getting frostbite in vents and sucking down donuts soaked in coffee instead of sleeping, I was too far behind.

More and more people started dying, all because I was setting my sights too high, instead of looking below. I'm no egghead, I don't know the first thing about geometry or angles or how bullets move through the air... but this case gave me and the whole city a crash course in terminal ballistics.

Over the course of a week, four innocent citizens lost their lives in the one place no one wants to die... at their office job. These poor saps crunch numbers and suffer office politics just to earn a few Crow$, and at the end of the day what was their reward for long hours into the twilight of midnight? a .309 caliber bullet to punch their clock. Each victim reported being stalked by a someone, each victim was terrified in the days before their eventual deaths. One enterprising office worker even brought her own High Caliber Rifle as a means of self-defense while she filing paperwork. But she wasn't fast enough to notice Kenya Mabuwa staring at her from her bedroom window across the street, one floor below. Each office worker died without ever having a chance to exercised their gods's given right to self-defense.

I'm going crazy and have to pretend I'm fine but I'm feeling really bad lately, as well as confused.

I'm a married lady in my early 40s. From the outside you could say I have everything: great job, great family, no financial issues, I've traveled all over the world and lived so many experiences not everyone can live, I don't look bad for my age (this is such a lame comment but at my age it matters), I'm healthy and have no serious problems in life except this one I'm posting about.

8 years ago I switched jobs and started working for this new, big corporation where I met lots of interesting people. The first year I got close to a guy that is a bit younger than me (5 years), single and really career focused. Besides, he is a great team mate and loves to help other people. We shared some strong common interests and we started hanging out at work together with a group of 3 people (meaning that we were always in a group). As time went by, we started to get closer and he started treating me in a different way, different from the way he treated the other coworkers. It was barely noticeable at first, he would ask me about my day and if I mentioned some issue at work, he would solve it for me without even asking him or he would make sure someone else would help me. He started to write me after work if he saw something or traveled somewhere and remembered about me (food we both love, a place we both liked, etc). But it still felt like a good work relationship and nothing else.

Things got ""heavier"" a year and a half ago. I noticed he would call only me for lunch, or for a coffee, and we started to talk in a separate work chat, just the two of us. He was always polite and appropriate and NEVER ever hinted at any kind of feelings from his side (just to be clear). It just felt that the friendship was becoming closer and we started having lunch alone. I noticed other people started avoiding us for lunch and left us alone in our corner in the office's kitchen. My friend started to open up and tell me about his concerns at work, private life, travels, things he didn't share with anyone else in the office and told me in confidence. I really enjoyed our lunches and found myself looking forward to our daily lunch and the hour we spent chatting.

A few months ago I noticed he would look upset if someone else approached us or joined us for lunch, our private conversations in the work chat increased and he sometimes wrote me during the weekends too. People around us started to comment or ask me why are we all the time together and things like that, so it was obvious to other people that we were very close. He has helped me a lot at work and done things for me that nobody else did, things that shocked some of our coworkers (asking a manager to promote me, for instance), and if I am absent or sick or work from home, he always asks me twice a day if I'm feeling better, etc... it feels like we need to talk every day, even if it's a short message.

Last week we had a work trip that involved the whole office, we went to a mountain resort for 3 days. He belongs to another department and there were activities for each team so I expected that I wouldn't see him at all since our schedules were different but he ended up joining my lunch table, inviting me on a drink after lunch and approaching me every chance he got.

It's important to mention we never met outside the office hours. And I say it's important because I have developed feelings for him and I didn't want to cross that line. I feel awful for having those feelings and I can't help wondering, are they reciprocated? Is his behaviour unusual or is it just me projecting and I am delusional?

Long story short, I got my start in roleplaying back during the golden age of AOL and Yahoo (anyone else remember the Red Dragon Inn back in the late 90s and early 2000s?). Ah, those were the days, right? When the biggest worry was your dial-up connection, haha.

As I'm sure you'd all agree‚Äîfinding long-term, advanced/literate writers is much more challenging these days. I have fond memories of when the process of coming up with a plot was an organic process; where you'd genuinely take the time to get to know the other person, build rapport, and allow a plot to form naturally.

That's what I'm hoping to find. With that said, I put a lot of effort into this post, so hopefully there's someone else out there who values the same things in a writing partner!

**First of all, here's a bit about me as a person:**

* I'm 30+, male, and I've written several novels and a bunch of articles, mostly in historical fiction and contemporary stories. Writing isn't just my job; it's pretty much a part of who I am.
* I'm always trying to learn something new, whether it's from books, documentaries, or just good old chatting. History and cultures fascinate me the most.
* When I'm not buried in books or work, I love to hike and take photos. There‚Äôs something about being out in nature that just clears my head.
* I love to read (especially non-fiction and historical fiction). I'm always down for swapping book recommendations, if you're also a reader!
* I love peanut butter (crunchy over smooth any day ‚Äì fight me).
* On that note, if I'm being honest, coffee isn't just a drink for me; it's a ritual!
* I'm a big fan of the simple things in life. Give me a sunset, a good laugh, or a perfect slice of pizza, and I‚Äôm set.
* I love diving into those deep, meandering conversations that start with ""what if"" and end somewhere between ""the meaning of life"" and ""why can‚Äôt we tickle ourselves?""
* Fun fact: I used to be able to recite all 50 states in alphabetical order ‚Äî a party trick born out of a grade school challenge, haha.

**Here's what I'm looking for in a writer:**

* ***Writing Style -*** I'm looking for a partner who has a strong command of the English language. I'm talking about descriptive passages that paint clear pictures, dialogue that is crisp, concise, and not overly flowery. I prefer to write in the 3rd person, past tense. I prefer modern fiction and historical fiction stories.
* ***Communication -***  Life's unpredictable! What‚Äôs important is keeping each other in the loop about our schedules and any changes in the story or our approach. A quick heads-up can make a huge difference. It's all about being honest and direct with our feedback and thoughts.
* ***Long-Term Plots -*** I'm really looking for a writing partner who's in it for the long haul and is passionate about crafting intricate, plot-driven stories. For me, the joy of roleplaying lies in developing a story that evolves over time, with twists and turns that keep us both engaged and inspired.
* ***Sense of Humor -*** Writing together should be fun and relaxed, not just a serious crafting of narratives. It‚Äôs important to me that we can both throw in a bit of humor now and then, not only in our stories but in our interactions too.

And there you have it! If you're a detail-oriented, communicative, mature, and long-term story lover, you might just be the writing partner I'm looking for.

We should totally write such a good story that our keyboards will need a vacation after we're done, haha. I hope to hear from you!",1,1728839980.0,Roleplay,3,0.67,False

1g2ujba,https://www.reddit.com/r/buzzwana/comments/1g2ujba/understanding_the_legality_of_thca_in_europe/,Understanding the Legality of THCA in Europe,"Hey, folks!

I‚Äôve noticed a lot of curiosity about the legality of **THCA** in Europe, so I thought I‚Äôd lay down some info to help clear things up for anyone wondering.

**What is THCA?**  
THCA (tetrahydrocannabinolic acid) is the non-psychoactive precursor to THC (the compound that gets you high). The catch? When THCA is heated‚Äîsay, by smoking or vaping‚Äîit converts into THC, which *is* psychoactive and can give you that classic buzz. So, while THCA itself won't get you high, it can turn into THC once it's exposed to heat.

**But is it legal in Europe?**  
Here‚Äôs where it gets tricky. THCA‚Äôs legality falls into a bit of a grey area across Europe. Most European countries regulate the amount of **THC** that can be in cannabis products, but there‚Äôs a lot less clarity around THCA. And remember: once you heat THCA and it turns into THC, you could be dealing with something illegal depending on where you are.

**Country-by-Country Breakdown**:

* **Germany** üá©üá™: Cannabis with THC under 0.2% is legal, but THCA products could be tricky if they transform into THC during use. Stay cautious, folks!
* **Italy** üáÆüáπ: Italy has relatively relaxed laws on cannabis derivatives with low THC content. Just be aware that if you‚Äôre turning THCA into THC (by smoking it), you could run into legal trouble.
* **Switzerland** üá®üá≠: Switzerland allows cannabis with up to 1% THC content, so THCA products are generally tolerated. However, it‚Äôs always good to check the current laws.
* **Spain** üá™üá∏: Private use of cannabis is decriminalized, but selling or trafficking remains illegal. THCA falls into that murky space‚Äîjust don‚Äôt get caught converting it into THC in public!
* **France** üá´üá∑: France has some of the strictest laws in Europe. Any product that turns into THC could be considered illegal. Be cautious if you‚Äôre in France, as THCA might be legal, but once it converts to THC, it‚Äôs a no-go.
* **UK** üá¨üáß: The UK has tight regulations when it comes to cannabis. If you possess THCA that could convert into THC, it‚Äôs considered illegal. Proceed with caution here.
* **Netherlands** üá≥üá±: Known for its cannabis-friendly policies, the Netherlands allows cannabis sales in coffee shops, but technically THC-rich products are illegal outside those settings. THCA could be in a grey area, depending on how it‚Äôs consumed.
* **Portugal** üáµüáπ: Portugal has decriminalized cannabis for personal use, but selling or distributing THC-containing products remains illegal. THCA in its raw form might be fine, but just be aware of how you're using it.
* **Austria** üá¶üáπ: Austria allows cannabis with THC levels under 0.3%, but like other places, THCA that converts to THC could cross that legal line.
* **Czech Republic** üá®üáø: Czech laws are relatively cannabis-friendly, with personal possession decriminalized. Low-THC cannabis products are tolerated, but again, keep an eye on how THCA is used.

**What‚Äôs the Bottom Line?**  
While THCA may be legal in its unconverted form, heating it and turning it into THC could cause legal complications, depending on where you are. Always double-check the local laws where you live or travel to ensure you're in the clear!

TL;DR: THCA *might* be fine to possess in certain countries, but as soon as it becomes THC, you might be walking on thin ice. Always do your homework and stay informed about the laws in your area before lighting up! üåø

Stay safe, stay informed, and enjoy responsibly! üí®",1,1728839506.0,buzzwana,0,1.0,False

I have this friend that literally uses me as a stepping stone in her life. She uses me to get what she needs and get where she wants to be. We‚Äôre 24(her) and 22F(me). We have a complex relationship because we‚Äôve been friends for a long time, but both have mental health issues. However, she seems to be completely unaware of the fact her behavior is unacceptable and honestly downright manipulative. 


Somehow, some way I managed to fall into a trap and we‚Äôve ended up working at the same place, same hours and of course I‚Äôm her ride to and from. This is horrible because she‚Äôs constantly taking advantage of my time, I have my own life to go home to and have no time to take her for food every night after work and breakfast or coffee every morning before. There has also been a time I had to call in due to health issues and she guilt tripped me over the fact she had to pay her father gas money to take her to work. On the way to work the next week, I complained about forcing myself even though I was ill because I was desperate for the money and she said she was very glad I was because she definitely couldn‚Äôt find a ride anymore, implying her dad will ‚Äúnever drive her again‚Äù and had even asked me if I needed to call in, if I could still take take her to work. It‚Äôs 40 minutes away, and she knew I was genuinely very sick. 


I kid you not, she‚Äôs designated one of our days off every single week to ME driving her to the grocery store, and when I broke the news I wasn‚Äôt going to be able to do that she said she‚Äôll have to figure out a different way for her and her dog not to starve. It‚Äôs constant woe is me, or ‚Äúif I cant figure out how to make this work I‚Äôll just have to kill myself.‚Äù and I‚Äôm not sure what to do because I‚Äôm an extreme people pleaser especially when it‚Äôs somebody that I care about,  plus I‚Äôve had my own fair share of struggles! But I like to think I‚Äôve never made it her problem, and I know for fact I‚Äôve never guilted her over anything. I truly start to hate her more and more each day and I need to lay clear boundaries, especially if she is going to be working with me, but honestly at this point I‚Äôve considered just quitting my job even though it would be a terrible financial decision, but I just can‚Äôt figure out how to escape lol. 


All of this and not even to mention the way she speaks to me and treats me on a daily basis is nearly belittling. Daily implications that she‚Äôs prettier than me or better and faster at our job(we work at goodwill lmao) and her problems are bigger than mine(they‚Äôre not) and this and that. 


Ideally, I would like to lay clear boundaries around our relationship going forward but there‚Äôs literally no world where I can do that without her blowing up my phone with absolutely crazy suicidal nonsense, or calling me dramatic, so what do I do? Do I just block her and hope she doesn‚Äôt find a ride to work to confront me? Lol somebody help, I really should have set my boundaries at any point before now, but I‚Äôm in too deep now and trying to figure out where my boundaries even lay and how to set them with somebody who thinks we‚Äôre A LOT closer than we actually are!",2,1728839504.0,Advice,5,1.0,False

The only sugar I eat is in my decaf coffee, it's 1.5 teaspoons of 50%-50% of dark brown cane sugar and eritrit. 

I have no fucking energy.   
I absolutely cannot concentrate on anything, not on my work, not on my hobbies, not on movies, it feels like it made my non-diagnosed adhd worse with 70%. Everything is absolutely boring or frustratingly boring.  And I cannot sleep normally since.

And now I'm thinking to hell with it, I'll stay fat, just give me back my brain.

We dated for 5 years .It was a toxic unhealthy relationship. I felt like I'm losing myself gradually. He controlled everything about me. He said he loved but i didn't feel it. 
At the end we went on our separate ways. 

We work together at the same hospital. 
To be honest it's hard to see him everyday but i managed myself not to talk to him at work and trying my best not to cross paths with him at the hospital. 

2 days ago it was a really hard day. I had a patient who died unexpectedly. I was crying behind the escalator area where all of the sudden he appeared. He immediately noticed me and came to me asking what's wrong. 
Seeing him made more emotional, i was sobbing at that point. He comforted me and took me out of the hospital building and bought for me coffee. 
At that moment i really felt lonely and wanted him to stay with me. But i remembered that it ended and i should put boundaries. 
I thanked him and run immediately. 

Today i received a text message from him asking me to go out with him and i felt really bad that maybe he understood that situation wrongly. 
I told him that i have another plans. And he said ""it's ok , i wanted to check on you , i was thinking about you in the last 2 days""

I'm scared that I'm gonna take a stupid decision in the next few days.

before jumping headfirst into this rabbithole I would like to ""dip"" my feet first.
Since the grinder is more important than the expresso machine, does it makes sense to buy a grinder first, some fresh beans and then later the expresso machine?

I currently own a DELONGHI ECAM23.266.B which produces quite bad espresso, but drinkable cappuccino. There is a chute where I can dump in pre grounded beans. My hope is get some better shots with a better grinder alone.
I usually drink milk based drinks and like my coffee more on the sweeter, chocolatier note.

Recently I noticed some strange changes happening in our relationship. 

She no longer wants to do our favorite activities together and is constantly shooting those ideas down and suggesting new activities we've never shown interest in before. For example, every Saturday we go for a hike, and even though she usually huffs and puffs the whole way, we both know it's good for her to get the exercise. But lately she's been refusing to go on hikes and instead suggests things that only she enjoys like xpensive boozy brunches, or drag shows (I'm not anti-LGBTQ, but they make me uncomfortable). 

So I went through her phone, thinking maybe she was going through a depressive episode. Instead I found something shocking: she's been having an emotional affair with her step-brother Stephen (M44)! 

They message each other nearly every day, and they always say ""I love you"" or ""I miss you."" She complains about me to him constantly in inaccurate ways, and he manipulates her by toxically encouraging her to do things to try to change me. They talked about how they meet up for coffee once a week and I would wager it's more than just coffee, but just thinking about that makes my stomach churn. She's even mentioned thinking about leaving me and he's said she can stay with him if she does. 

I could barely contain my rage at first, but the more I thought about it the more I realize she's probably been manipulated by him and maybe even groomed from the time they were kids. So I decided I wouldn't immediately divorce her, but I'm also not going to support her weird emotional affair.

So I told her earlier today I'm shutting off her phone line since the phone bill is in my name. I'm also cancelling her credit card (no more ""coffees""). We share one vehicle, so I also told her if she wants to use the car from now on, I have to be along for the trip. I told her these were my boundaries and if she didn't want to go through a divorce, she needs to learn to respect them so we can rebuild trust. 

She's in the kitchen now ordering a pizza, and I'm starting to wonder if I overreacted and should've allowed her to come to the conclusion that her emotional affair with her step-brother was wrong on her own.

Grinding coarser will artificially lower the pressure but also makes the extraction too fast and the coffee too bitter.

My friend recently bought the same machine and I helped him get started. I noticed that his BE does not surpass the 12‚Äôo clock on the pressure dial (this is about 9 bar). Even when grinding too fine, the pressure wont go beyond 12 o clock.

Didn't see you there! I bet you're wondering how I found myself in this rather confounding situation.  

Well, let's go back. 2014, summer. May not have been *the* summer of love, but it was *my* summer of love, because that was when I met Linda. We were in highschool, we were in detention, and by the end of that fateful day we were in love.   

Montage. Highschoolers in love for the first time. First time holding hands, sunset on the horizon, our entangled hands like a medallion for a kind summer Sun which kisses a suburban street goodbye. First kiss, hesitant, tender, cute, but never awkward. First time making out, on the darker side of twilight, next to a hot dog stand downtown. Two years go by, dates, laughter, the occasional fights, tears, kisses, growing comfortable with each other.  

It's 2016. First time making love. Downstairs at her parent's house the winner of the presidential elections is announced. In her bedroom we discover each other, sweetly, tenderly, super hotly, but you're not allowed to find it hot because we were sixteen. What are you, some creep?  

Montage ends. Teary goodbye for college, pointless promises to wait for each other, empty hopes for a long distance relationship. Sad music which knows what we don't.  

Montage again. Me in college, nervous yet determined, classes which demand more of me than my highschool smarts had ever had to give. She in college, determined yet hesitant, fast new friends, shared laughter, streaks of whimsical colors in their hair. *Us* in college, texting, calling, chatting. My friends mocking my loyalty, her friends doing the same. Me standing firm, *she's the one for me*. She bending to social pressure.  

Enter frat guys. Frat guys enter Linda. Like devils on both shoulders, her college friends. Liberation, feminism, *this is your time to go wild*. At first she's unsure, then she gives in. Close up of her face as the background changes. Bed after bed after bed. Dirty beds, grimy college couches, cigarette littered back seats of cheap cars. She loses some shine, some halo, most purity. She gains some smirk, some bored lustless expression.  

Enter my DnD group. We're nerds and we're proud. *We're here, we're geek, give me an initiative check!* Thrills of the imagination, camaraderie of the true heart. My paladin tells of his elven maiden, named L‚Äôinda, perhaps. Friends listen in enraptured silence as I turn real womanly qualities into magical ones with barely any embellishment.  

Her in college, she and her friends like Judas goats, welcoming the new meat, the fresh new girls, and leading them into temptation. Her frat fuck buddies from darkened corners, looking on with predatory expressions. More girls must be recruited into the life of sexual objectification, lest the ones already there wake up to their torrid reality. Linda passing from hand to hand, from lap to lap. So many gang bangs, vaginal DPs just to feel something again. Tears, and tears.  

Me waiting with my phone in hand for messages that never come. Girls trying to be my friends, friends who are girls throwing themselves at me. Finally I succumb to loneliness. Sweet, sad, and yet athletic sex. It means nothing to me, it means the world to the girl.  

Fast forward. 2022. Me, established in my career, rising fast, whispers of wunderkind. She, raking in the OnlyFans dollars. A lonely night browsing the web I stumble upon her account, I do a double take, my eyes fill with joy, amazement, concern. Her makeup, intense blush on upper cheeks and nose, fake freckles. Her ahegao, particularly drooly. Is this the Linda I knew? Oh my god, what is she doing with that‚Ä¶ is that a dildo? Do they make them that large? *Jesus Christ*!  

I reach out. ‚ÄúHey Linda, it's Michael, remember me?‚Äù ‚ÄúI do! Oh my gosh, Michael, it's been so long!‚Äù Flashbacks to the previous paragraph, to that immense dildo, penetrate my head upon the word ‚Äúlong‚Äù.  

We reconnect. *Be with me, Linda, I make good money, you don't have to keep doing‚Ä¶ that.* She tears up, she runs out of the coffee shop, gently bowlegged.   

I discover that her frat fuck buddy is pimping her on OnlyFans. I beat him up to within an inch of his life, the kickboxing training finally paying up. My lawyer buddy from college helps me out. I'm an outstanding member of society, the frat fuck buddy is bisexual, we argue gay panic. I don't like to lie, but needs must.  

Fast forward. 2023. Linda and I get married. She wears *white*, I wear black. I can still see remnants of the sweet girl she once was and I declare my intention to rebuild her, *this is my vow.* Her parents thank me from the bottom of their hearts. Her bridesmaids, the friends from college, silently hiss at me, they don't attend the reception.  

Montage. Sad wedding night. She felt very little. We cuddle, saddened by the circumstances. New life together, new house, new city. Her job interviews ending badly when her interviewers recognize her from her OnlyFans. Us deciding she can be a stay at home wife . Some fights. More sad love making nights.  

It's 2024. A credit card report. Expenses which don't hurt my finances but concern me. I- oh shit! This is going too long! We're almost out of time!  

Okay, quickly. I find out she's been hiring male escorts to give her the gang banging, multiply penetrative sex she craves since college, since she fell astray, since she went ashtray, under the misaimed advice of her multicolor haired friends. I decide to confront her.  

Okay, now you're all caught up.  

At the kitchen table she breaks down sobbing, asking my forgiveness while also telling me I knew what she had become by the time we married. She insults my manhood as not enough. She humiliates herself as not good enough. I hold her, I console her, I promise we will find a way: therapy, both single and couples, group therapy even if she'd like it more that way. Surgery, one, two, maybe three husband stitches, whatever is needed. She calms down, she agrees because she loves me too much.  

That night as she uses her Herculean Dragon Vibrating Buddy (‚Ñ¢) I slip downstairs to my office, where she's not allowed because a man needs to have his space. As I walk into my office of course I know she's been there with her male whores, thrilling in the experience of desecrating my private space, fucking on the couch, against the bookcases, on top of my desk. I sit down in front of my PC, a top of the line gaming rig, and boot it up. The secret encrypted partition, the video gallery with the product of all the hidden cameras in the house. Hours upon hours of footage about my wife's sordidity. I click on the most recent and go to town on myself. Things are progressing. Today I let her know I know, the arousal underneath the arousal swells, payday approaches slowly and sensuously.  

Speaking of payment, once I'm done I open the messages from Linda's former pimp. See, I told you my lawyer buddy had helped me out of assault charges, but I lied. My buddy did his best but my personal dealing with the pimp is what did it. And now Mr. Pimp is asking for more money. He has recordings of what Linda did during college and her OnlyFans days. The stuff too heavy even for that platform, the things so perverse I'm not turned on by the prospect of seeing them. The pimp believes he has me in his hands. In truth, I am edging to it. I am sexually enjoying the economic control I have over him, and over my own needs, and over Linda. I send him the money, because it's not time yet, it's not *my* payday yet.  

One day, the perfect day, I will cut him off and he will release those videos. I won't even watch them, I don't need to. The knowledge that they are out there for the world to see, that's what will do it. I will gorge on the sense of deep marital humiliation. My family watching those videos, my friends and coworkers, all thinking less of me, pitying me, ahhh, I moan in anticipation of that day. Oh, that beautiful payday I will *really* come. Imma Jackson Pollock this office! It's gonna be like Spiderman burst in this fucker!

I am on holidays in India and met two men who said they were jewellery and diamond and precious stone sellers. We met at the fire cermoney . I was one of the only westerners and we just started chatting. 
They seemed cool and we drank chai together. They said they were from Delhi. They asked if I wanted to meet tomorrow for coffee. 
I met them the next day because I wanted their advice on some jewellery I had bought ( cheap stuff). 
 I also just wanted some advice on perhaps setting up an import business to Australia. Just wondering if that was possible. ( Done my research now and there are a lots of hurdles!)
So anyway they asked me at lunch if I wanted to do ""business"".
I could post some pieces ( diamond rings) back to Australia under my name because I have a tourist visa. But the value would be declared on the package for customs so it's all legal. 
I would pack the packages and send the rings myself. Probably worth about 60k in total.
Then they would keep the receipt and give it to their contact in Australia and I would need this receipt to pickup the package with their contact.

The part I don't get is couldn't I just pickup the package without the receipt if it's under my name and addressed to me? 
What taxes are they not paying if the value is  being declared?
I really don't understand what the scam is at all. 
There were some other red flags as well. 
But has anyone heard of this kind thing?  

The crazy thing is they actually shows my rocks at lunch that were precious stones. Rubies and other ones... I asked for more certainty about this situation and some guy who was travelling with them turns up and gives them a pencil case full of precious stones.

I was not aware of anything happening as I was getting a coffee, so only realized something had happened when we wanted to go home and were very intimidatingly cornered by three(!) security people who wanted to get further information of what happened.

My purpose is to inform the sub as to what happened and is happening so investors can make informed decisions. I see lots of romanticized ideas as to what the grand plan is, which most are misguided. Hopefully this post enlightens and continues a discussion that is based on facts and what is the most likely scenario(s) that will play out

**The Back Story:**

Tilray (Aphria) under Irwin's leadership have made some significant acquisitions in the craft beer/spirits business. Most notably:

1. \[Acquisition of SweetWater Brewing Co for $300M USD\](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/aphria-inc-announces-strategic-entry-into-the-united-states-with-an-agreement-to-acquire-sweetwater-brewing-company-805484407.html)
2. \[Acquisition of Breckenridge Distillery for $100M USD\](https://www.distillerytrail.com/blog/breckenridge-distillery-the-worlds-highest-distillery-acquired-by-canadian-cannabis-company-tilray-for-102-9-million/)
3. \[Acquiring 8 beer brands from AB for $85M USD\](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1731348/000143774923022325/ex\_548126.htm)
4. \[Recently acquiring 4 beer brands from Molson/Coors for $23M USD\](https://ir.tilray.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tilray-brands-completes-acquisition-craft-beer-brands-and)

I believe there were a few smaller acquisitions in there but those are the main ones. Tilray has spent approximately $500M+ USD to get into the distillery/craft beer business. That is a significant amount of capital to put into this venture that can't be ignored

**Tilray does not care about craft beer or spirits**

There are 2 actions that occurred that should illustrate this point

**1. The firing of Tonya Cornett and her team**

A name that probably nobody knows (I didn't either until recently). However she is arguably one of the best craft brewers in the world. She has won numerous awards and pioneered craft beer. She was employed by 10 Barrel Brewing with a very impressive team that formed their innovation group. In April 2024, this team went to the World Beer Cup and made history sweeping an entire category with gold. Something that has never been done before.

\[Tilray fired the entire team last month.\](https://newschoolbeer.com/home/2024/9/tilray-lays-off-10-barrel-brewings-entire-innovation-brewing-team) It is hard to say that you want to infuse life and create winning brands when you gut the people that give you the ability to do that

**2. The volume of acquisitions in the space**

Without doxxing myself, I work corporate development for a publicly traded company. We are extremely active in M&A. We have bought declining/distressed companies in the past and continue to look for opportunities. From my experience, its a lot of work to turn a declining company around. They need attention, money and effort to stop revenue decline and attract old and new customers to the brand. Our last declining business took 18 months to stabilize, right size and integrate the business to where we had envisioned it. The operational folks worked a lot to get it to where it was an asset to us and not a drag on financials.

Tilray bought 12 of them, all under 2 years time. There is absolutely no way they have enough resources to stabilize all of them. You simply can't. \[Also the craft beer industry is in decline, so why would you inject resources into a declining industry?\](https://robbreport.com/food-drink/dining/craft-beer-slowdown-bars-cutting-back-1235491542/)

**What the craft beer/distillery revenue will look like over time**

The \[previous article I mentioned\](https://newschoolbeer.com/home/2024/9/tilray-lays-off-10-barrel-brewings-entire-innovation-brewing-team) will give insight to where that revenue and business is going. Most notably this sentence: This included company wide positions in brewing, admin, and sales, which has been confirmed by multiple sources.

Tilray is going into every brand and firing brewing, admin, and sales staff to try and bring the company to either being profitable and a little more profitable. The side effect of this is that most likely all these brands will continue to decline and get worse, not better. Think about it:

* If you have 10 sales people and you fire 4 of them, how would sales go up with less people
* How would les admin staff improve customer service, invoicing/billing, etc
* How would less brewers make better products to attract and retain customers

Not to mention the intangibles. Imagine your company gets bought out, the new owner fires a bunch of people you enjoyed working with, and now you have to do more work to pick up the slack for the same pay. Moral is awful when this happens and people don't go the extra mile to help the company at all.

So the most likely scenario is revenue will continue to decline for a bit until they stabilize. They will do so by drastically pulling back on products and probably end up with only 3-4 brands that they can actually manage and that show potential. They will keep the illusion up of lots of brands. For example they'll have a coffee beer that in one area is called coffee, another is called java and a third called cup of Joe (all under different brands/labels) - but in reality it'll be the same beer in the can. Revenue will land far smaller in the future then what it was when they acquired it

**So what is the future and why did they make these moves?**

I can articulate this but u/Geologic23 already made a comment that I think summarizes very well what the carrot that Tilray is chasing - [https://www.reddit.com/r/weedstocks/comments/1g1uixu/comment/lrmoyz5/](https://www.reddit.com/r/weedstocks/comments/1g1uixu/comment/lrmoyz5/)

So the question investors need to understand is will spending a bunch of money now on bleeding businesses be worth it in the future when they transition over the hemp beverages? These businesses will continue to bleed and Tilray will do the best they can too stabilize or minimize the damage. They will also go through a transition where they scale back beer and replace with THC seltzers and such. Will future THC beverage sales compensate for the drag on financials that has and will continue to happen in the alcohol sales. 

Also want to add that it is not as simple as ""yeah of course this will work, because they will make money and grow so its all good"". When you use a DCF model future revenue is worth far less that today's revenue (especially if you go out 3+ years. So the longer it takes the bigger the boom needs to be to make it worthwhile for today's shareholders.

Last thing, there is upside to this strategy but there are also lots of risks as well (political, market, competitor and operational). I'm not going to get into those now as this post is not about whether this is good or bad, but what they did and why they are doing it. I'm sure the comment section will dive into the good or bad discussion organically.

I found this cabinet on the side of the road today near my house in Amsterdam, and I was wondering whether someone knows from which decade it is from? Just curious, I plan to clean and refinish it to put in my living room since I got a coffee table recently that fits the style!

It is made of some kind of solid wood, although the fronts of the doors and drawers are veneer. 

I was cleaning it with my steam cleaner because it smells slightly of old cabinet and smokey i suppose, but something weird happened. I started in the bottom and the legs, and it got all flakey and weird as if I was taking off some kind of layer. Wiping it with paper afterwards which turned brownish red gives me the impression it is some kind of stain maybe? Anyone know what could do this, and how to clean it effectively? See the pictures of the leg!

Also would love to hear ideas about how to refinish it once it is clean. I have refinished a table and cabinet before so it is not my first, but not yet veneer pieces.

1g2u1wg,https://www.reddit.com/r/prediabetes/comments/1g2u1wg/one_year_later/,One year later,"Hey there! 42 female. I posted almost exactly a year ago because my a1c was 5.9 and I was looking for advice and tips on how/what to discuss with my PCP as far as what the next steps should be. Well, she pretty much blew me off. I was about 24 months postpartum, 18 months post breastfeeding and she said that since my gestational diabetes test came back amazing, she had zero concern. 


Even though I felt like I was already doing everything I should do, i made some changes where I felt I could. I switched up my workout routine to more of a muscle building approach than a leaning out approach. I did lose about 10 pounds but I‚Äôve absolutely still built up muscle. I really, REALLY avoided pasta and white flour. We eat a lot of rice, but I use brown rice over any other rice. I Increased my water intake. Decreased my sugar intake. I had my bloodwork done this past week in anticipation for my yearly physical coming up in a few days. My a1c is still at 5.7, (blood sugar was 123) and the app my PCP office uses was updated and it has bloodwork from 2019 that was not in there last year and my a1c was 5.7. So it was 5.7 in 2019, not tested again until 2023 when it was 5.9, and last week 5.7.


A friend of mine is a personal trainer/former diabetes educator (and she had gestational diabetes) so she recommended I wake up, drink a glass of water and be sure to test my sugar with my finger prick thing (I bought it last year to keep track but did fall off) within 15 minutes of waking up and before my morning coffee. It has been over 100 every morning. It was 130 the other morning, which I know isn‚Äôt that crazy but I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs kind of high for fasted isn‚Äôt it? It may not be exactly 12 hours after the last piece of food goes into my body, but it‚Äôs at least 10. I‚Äôve been trying to eat things like roasted nuts or peanut butter (we use sugar free all natural PB) as my last snack because I do have trouble waking at like, 2-3 in the morning and I‚Äôve read it could be blood sugar related and something like a scoop of sugar free peanut butter will help. She also thinks I should demand to see an endocrinologist because my lifestyle is not matching up to my a1c and my doctor SHOULD be concerned this time around. In the past, my thyroid levels and iron levels have been all over the place but this year they are all normal. Which never happens. One or all of them is usually abnormally low. 

I‚Äôm just not sure what to say to my Dr. when I go. Should I request to see a Dietitian/Nutritionist or Endocrinologist? Something else? Thanks!

Jeremiah 29:11 is a popular verse that‚Äôs often slapped onto journals, etched into coffee mugs, and printed on t-shirts.

And God does have a plan for you.
God does want to bless you.

But‚Äîwe should also pay attention to the original context ‚Ä¶

In this case, God was speaking through the prophet Jeremiah to the people of Judah‚Äîpeople who‚Äôd recently been exiled to Babylon for 70 years.¬†

The Jewish people were banished to a foreign land because of their insatiable appetite for sin. In fact, for 23 years Jeremiah had been warning them to stop rebelling against God or prepare to face the consequences.

God is patient, but He is also just. In the preceding chapters, God made a case against His beloved people:

They‚Äôd exploited foreigners, orphans, and widows. They‚Äôd denied the rights of the poor. They‚Äôd refused to stand up for truth or obey God‚Äôs instructions. They‚Äôd murdered the innocent and committed adultery. They‚Äôd rejoiced in doing evil and their lives were ruled by greed. They‚Äôd even built pagan shrines, sacrificing their sons and daughters in the fires. It was a dark time. And yet, somehow, God‚Äôs mercy always extends to the darkest places on earth.

That‚Äôs why, just a few verses later, God said they could seek Him and find Him, and He‚Äôd bring them back from captivity (Jeremiah‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠29:13‚Ä¨-14).

That‚Äôs why he encouraged them‚Äîwhile in exile‚Äîto build houses, plant gardens, get married, have children, and work for the peace and prosperity of their temporary home (Jeremiah 29:5-7).

He wanted them to know: He hadn‚Äôt forgotten them. He still wanted good for them. He still had plans to restore them.

God is serious about sin, but He‚Äôs just as passionate about redemption.

Though Jeremiah 29:11 was meant for a specific people at a specific time, God‚Äôs heart for the restoration of broken people is generationally timeless.¬†

Even when we feel stuck in the process, God still has a plan.¬†
We can put our trust in the God whose goal is always redemption.

I have been texting with one girl and we have been already on coffee etc. We are both studying at the same university so we have begin to talk firstly about school etc. During last exam season we were practically texting each other daily and same it was during the last month. She often send me selfies of herself like everyday, asking how I was etc. She also mentioned that we could meet at one party where both of us will be at 6th November and also mentioned that we could study together and foremost she also mentioned she would like to see my college room because she doesnt believe that I have there as big mess as I am saying often from jokes. Also she was a little bit jealous I would say because I mentioned that some people said that I am positive person. She then asked who concretely and I mentioned one girl who said it. She then asked why I am even talking about her and when I reminded that she asked she just sent smiling emojis. So with these indicators I didnt want to make the same mistake as I did last time (waiting too long) and I went with her on coffee in school cafeteria (day after the thing with the jealousy) and after that I texted her and I invited her to dinner. She politely rejected it.

Now off course with gym training, and due to some bad technique in the early days, some injuries have occurred. So far, shoulder, forearms, knee, and foot and sizzled with tendonitis. I am not particularly strong, and to be honest, I suck when it comes to strength; I can't go heavy, for a variety of reasons, including 1. I work out on an empty stomach and drink black coffee 2. I follow a calorie-deficit diet, so I will not have as much energy as others who are in calorie-surplus. These are cute reasons, but I simply don't have the strength. My bench press is 30-40 kilograms with some reps. I could never go beyond that. I can't even do a two clean pull-up. Furthermore, I have a flat foot, which when combined with weight causes plantar fasciitis, so I am dealing with that as well. Every day, I apply balm to the body part that is hurting the most. I had poor knees as well. It's as if you name an injury, and I have it (mostly). It has become a pastime of mine to google pain sensations and try to figure out what injury I am suffering from at the moment. Despite this, I continue to go to my local gym every morning. I've been paying close attention to my form, breathing, and avoiding ego-lifting in recent months. I just wanted to give some context before asking one question.

Now the question is whether I should move to calisthenics. Of course, I need to take it slowly and start with a beginner routine until I feel truly comfortable. But will this help me lose fat in the same way that weight training would? My goal is still to lose at least another 15 kg. Or should I continue to weight train until I lose another 15kg and then transition to calisthenics?",10,1728837851.0,bodyweightfitness,9,0.92,False

While Zen Cortex 2000 is made from natural ingredients, some users may experience side effects:

¬∑¬†**Caffeine Sensitivity**: Those sensitive to caffeine may experience jitters, insomnia, or increased heart rate. It‚Äôs advisable to monitor your intake and avoid taking the supplement too close to bedtime.

This will be part 1 of my mission to pick one character from every episode in the modern era, but without choosing a character more than once.

I was originally going to do this for the entire modern era so far, but then that would‚Äôve taken a really long time.

Before you proceed, there are some points I have to make...

‚Ä¢ For this part and future Series‚Äô parts, I‚Äôm not including any of the villains, yet I would still occasionally include characters who are not really evil but have done something bad, or even characters with a jerky attitude.

‚Ä¢ Each character is fitted with a quote, but their quote is said by them in the episode that they are representing and not their entire tenure.

‚Ä¢ Please don‚Äôt take this seriously, as a bunch of the following points are used for comedy purposes.

Anyway, let's proceed...

/ / /

The Ninth Doctor
-------

First Seen: Grabbing Rose‚Äôs hand and telling her to run from the plastic men (because Autons aren‚Äôt mentioned by name in the episode).

Last Seen: Regenerating into Ten after kissing Ro-THAT WAS A GENETIC TRANSFER.

Fun Fact: He‚Äôs the only character who knows Mickey‚Äôs real name, which is Ricky, and that‚Äôs something not even Mickey himself knows.

‚ÄúThat won‚Äôt work, he‚Äôs gay and she‚Äôs an alien.‚Äù

/ / /

Rose Tyler
-------

First Seen: Waking up like an ordinary person.

Last Seen: Meeting a drunken man on New Year‚Äôs Day in 2005, who tells her that‚Äôs she going to have a really great year.

Fun Fact: According to Jack, she has an excellent bottom.

‚ÄúHello. My name‚Äôs Rose. That‚Äôs a sort of plant. We might be related. I‚Äôm talking to a twig.‚Äù

/ / /

Charles Dickens
-------

First Seen: Feeling old, while waiting for his stage call, and feels like he‚Äôs seen it all.

Last Seen: On BBC Breakfast, where he‚Äôs interviewed about his new Christmas Special, A Christmas Carol.

Fun Fact: Until Nine told him otherwise, he was lead to believe that nobody called him Charlie.

‚ÄúWhat the Shakespeare‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

/ / /

Mickey Smith
-------

First Seen: Having lunch with Rose, while having fun with her.

Last Seen: Hugging Martha, which is just what she needed after their encounter with a Sontaran and Ten.

Fun Fact: Before K9 reminded him, he didn‚Äôt realise he was in a car.

‚ÄúI think I know my own name.‚Äù

/ / /

Harriet Jones
-------

First Seen: Giving someone coffee, as an attempt to meet the Prime Minister, but he sees through her cunning plan.

Last Seen: Facing extermination with dignity, after gaining proof that the Daleks know who she is.

Fun Fact: Throughout her life, she made it her job to make sure everyone knew who she was, but they all knew anyway.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a very violent young woman.‚Äù

/ / /

Adam Mitchell
-------

First Seen: Being a witness to Van Statten firing someone for having an opinion.

Last Seen: Failing to live a quiet life, since his mum snapped her fingers and opened his head.

Fun Fact: He was kicked out of the TARDIS for breaking rules, even though the Doctor was ‚Äòin charge‚Äô.

‚ÄúGreat big alien death machine defeated by a flight of stairs.‚Äù

/ / /

Cathica Santini Khandeni
-------

First Seen: Along with Suki, as they both meet a test who‚Äôs asking them a lot of obvious questions.

Last Seen: Discussing with Nine on what‚Äôs to come about of Satellite 5‚Äôs future after Max had been destroyed.

Fun Fact: Despite the fact that she‚Äôs a major part of the ‚Äòspiking‚Äô people, the Editor apparently doesn‚Äôt recognise her and considers her ‚Äòno one‚Äô.

‚ÄúOh no, you don‚Äôt. You should have promoted me years back.‚Äù

/ / /

Pete Tyler
-------

First Seen: Getting married to Jackie, where his daughter and her time traveling friend are present.

Last Seen: Dying on a road with a blond girl by his side.

Fun Fact: He was shorter than Rose thought he would be, and that‚Äôs not the only thing about him that surprised her.

‚ÄúNo, love. I‚Äôm your dad. It‚Äôs my job for it to be my fault.‚Äù

/ / /

Jack Harkness
-------

First Seen: Using his binoculars to check through the night sky during the Blitz, and soon catches sight of Rose.

Last Seen: After helping Thirteen and her gang to stop both Dalek armies, he chickens out from spending more time with her but does leave her a recorded message.

Fun Fact: On two occasions, he informs Nine that he‚Äôll see him in Hell. He never once said this to Ten or Thirteen, so ‚ÄòHell‚Äô could either refer to Ten, Thirteen or his inability to die.

‚ÄúSorry, old man. I‚Äôve got to go meet a girl. But you‚Äôve got an excellent bottom too.‚Äù

/ / /

Nancy
-------

First Seen: Appearing out of nowhere, as she warns Nine not to answer his TARDIS phone.

Last Seen: Answering the question that all the gas mask zombies have been asking by confirming that she‚Äôs Jamie‚Äôs mother.

Fun Fact: She tells Nine (the Doctor) that he should find the Doctor, which confuses him briefly.

‚ÄúYou think so, Ernie? Then answer this. Jim is sitting there right next to you. So who‚Äôs typing?‚Äù

/ / /

Idris Hopper
-------

First Seen: Asking Nine if he‚Äôs going to book an appointment to see the Mayor.

Last Seen: Trying to stop Nine from seeing the Mayor.

Fun Fact: He‚Äôs polite to everyone he‚Äôs with, yet he apparently is over protective of the Mayor, which could hint that he‚Äôs a Slitheen too.

‚ÄúThe Lord Mayor says thank you for popping by. She‚Äôd love to have a chat, but, er, she‚Äôs up to her eyes in paperwork. Perhaps if you could make an appointment for next week?‚Äù

/ / /

Rodrick
-------

First Seen: Guiding a confused Rose to her podium on the Deadly Weakest Link.

Last Seen: Getting exterminated by the Daleks due to his selfish attitude.

Fun Fact: During his life, he never found out what actually happened to all the eliminated contestants on the Deadly Weakest Link (including Rose).

‚ÄúRight, that‚Äôs the end of tactical voting. You‚Äôre on your own now.‚Äù

/ / /

Lynda Moss
-------

First Seen: Being Nine‚Äôs support when he‚Äôs transmatted onto the Killer Big Brother House.

Last Seen: Thanks to a Dalek exterminating the glass, she got killed by open space.

Fun Fact: After being accepted to join Nine in the TARDIS, she says that she wouldn‚Äôt get in the way, but he wouldn‚Äôt even mind if she did get in the way. Rose, however, would mind about that happening. As for Jack, well...we should already know what he would think.

‚ÄúThe Fleet‚Äôs descending. They‚Äôre bombing whole continents. Europa, Pacifica, the New American Alliance. Australasia‚Äôs just gone.‚Äù

It's been slow because I have a history of eating disorder (restricting calories, bingeing and purging) so I'm just taking my time which I've made peace with.

I aim for 1500 calories a day but I always seem to end the day at around 1700, which has resulted me weighing between 172lb and 176lb for months.

I've never been a breakfast eater, I make do with coffee with unsweetened almond milk and water until midday, where I usually have around 500 calories for lunch. 

Where I struggle is my toddler's dinner time! She is at nursery all day, and gets home around 6pm. She usually comes home happy but tired or overstimulated so having a sit down dinner as a family isn't really an option, she gets ants in her pants and in a nutshell mealtimes with her can be incredibly stressful. So I'll have a plate of picky bits for her ready to eat picnic style on a blanket on the floor, and my husband and I will eat dinner later when she's in bed at 7.30pm.

I'm really struggling being around food when it's not really my time to eat. I always end up eating her leftovers or just getting a small serving for myself. I've done it just now, and I would've had 600 odd calories left for dinner but I helped myself to a cheese and onion pastry and now I have just over 300 for dinner which won't be enough and I know I'll go over 1500 calories.

I think the answer is to eat more filling foods during the day but I just never feel satisfied. I drink a lot of water and 0 calorie fizzy drinks to help but it's like as soon as I smell food I am ravenous, and telling myself I can't have it just leads me to binge on it.

I've been stuck in the 170s for months, I was 2lbs away from my first goal weight of 170lbs, a weight I wanted to be at on the 28th September for my best friend's wedding. No reason, it just seemed like a nice and reasonable number to aim for, but I didn't reach it because I just keep snacking and grazing.

A bit about me/some general interests: 

I love to listen to music, my favorite band since I was 15 lol is Blink 182(have seen them live three times). I like to watch movies and tv shows(who doesn‚Äôt?) - I‚Äôm definitely a horror girly, but I like other things too! I love ghosts and fall and spooky season.  I love to shop and get my nails done. I love coffee. I‚Äôm very close with my family, we spend a lot of time together. I like to stay active, and exercise daily. [This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/h0HFFpQ)

A bit about the type of person I‚Äôm looking for: 
I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+. Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I‚Äôm not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). Other than that, I‚Äôm very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific ‚Äútype‚Äù of person! I‚Äôm looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I‚Äôm not *looking* for something super serious, nor am I looking to relocate or anything like that. 

If you think this sounds like something you‚Äôd be interested in, please contact me(chat preferred over DM). Tell me a bit about yourself! I will ignore any single word responses - ‚Äúhey‚Äù does not start a conversation. ",1,1728837427.0,r4r,1,0.57,False

She was the first to suggest a meeting, so we went for coffee. The conversation flowed really well, and we spent over two hours chatting. Afterward, I walked her home.

For the second date, I suggested sushi and an art gallery. The date lasted 3 hours, and once again, the conversation was great.

After the second date, we didn‚Äôt see each other for two weeks. I thought a lot about her and realized I really liked her. I called her and asked if she‚Äôd go on a date with me (I made it clear I wanted it to be a **date**). Now, looking back, I think she didn‚Äôt sound very excited or convinced, but she agreed. We met at a restaurant, and then went to a place where you can paint on canvas. I brought her flowers, and after everything, we went back to my place, had tea, and I showed her some vacation photos. I then drove her home. We didn‚Äôt hold hands or kiss. It was our longest date, lasting about 6 hours. Right after, she texted me saying she had a great time, but when I replied saying I really wanted to give her the flowers, she didn‚Äôt respond.

After that, she started reaching out to me less frequently. We didn‚Äôt communicate much over text. WhatsApp was mostly just used to plan dates. She even mentioned that she doesn‚Äôt like spending too much time on her phone and prefers talking in person or calling. Finally, she suggested another meet-up, but then went silent for a week.

We eventually met up again at a restaurant. Once again, the conversation was great, but at the end of the night, she said we needed to talk. I had a feeling I knew what it was about. She said we‚Äôd seen each other four times, and that I probably wanted something more, but she didn‚Äôt. I told her that yes, I did want more, but I respected her decision. Then she said something along the lines of ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too bad you don‚Äôt like me for my personality.‚Äù I explained that we‚Äôve only met four times, so it‚Äôs hard for me to really know her yet. She seemed a bit stressed, and then started telling me I‚Äôm a great guy and that I‚Äôll definitely find someone. At the end, she asked if I was about to cry. I told her I‚Äôm not going to cry, but I am sad because I really liked her, and I‚Äôll have to deal with it myself. As we left, I said that if she changes her mind, she knows where to find me.

One thing I didn‚Äôt mention to her is that during this time, I was also casually dating other girls. I didn‚Äôt bring it up openly, and I‚Äôm not sure if that could have affected the situation or her feelings. I‚Äôm confused by this whole situation. Could asking her out on an **actual date** have scared her off? What did I do wrong?

Waking up in the morning wasn't much of a problem, the problem was trying to get up... Because Vulthiss was on top of me.

""How did you sleep?"" The obese Arxur asked, seemingly not caring about the fact that she was on top of my lungs.

""As fine as ever..."" I strained. ""Listen dear, I know you like for me to coddle you, but you're crushing my ribcage...""

Realizing the strain her weight put me under, Vulthiss rolled to the side of me. I gasped as the presdure on my ribs finally released, enjoying the ability to breathe correctly again.

""Ah well, it was fun while it lasted..."" Vulthiss said with a little disappointment in her tone.

""It's alright."" I told her. ""It's just... you can't be on top of me anymore.""

""Yeah yeah. I'm aware."" She replied.

I snuggled up close to her, wrapping my arms around her soft belly. ""Does this feel any better?""

She chuckled. ""As long as you're here, everything feels better.""

We lied there for a while, enjoying each others warmth. She let out an affectionate growl as I held her tightly. She was right though. She knew that art was how a person defines their own truth, she knew that as an artist herself...

It wasn't until we talked to Bahumth yesterday that I realized exactly what she meant. Despite art simply being a way for expression, art was complex, and sometimes has a completely paradoxical meaning.

I realized that everyone was their own form of art, finding our own truths in life and shaping ourselves to match it. Vulthiss isn't like other artists, she isn't vain, arrogant, or broody. But she is *passionate*.

Vulthiss herself is art. She may not like her obesity, but it's an exact reflection of who she is; warm, soft, and loveable. And if you look even deeper, you would see the same thing in her soul. She was the kindest, and most loving being this side of the galaxy has ever seen, and that is her truth.

I felt her soft skin in my paws as I held onto her tightly. I snuggled my head against her passionately, earning a loving coo from her. I wanted to stay in her arms forever, that was my truth.

""We should probably get up."" I heard Vulthiss say. ""We wouldn't want to keep the kids waiting.""

I silently cursed. ""Well in that case..."" I heaved myself up and out of the bed before helping Vulthiss get up herself.

As usual, I also had to help her get dressed as well. But once we've finished all that, we headed downstairs. We were both surprised to see the kids were already awake and eating.

Tanca was busy sharpening one of her knives, Bahumth was tinkering with some metal while sipping on some coffee, and Glis was busy being Glis. So all in all, pretty normal morning.

Vulthiss and I grabbed a couple pieces of flesh to munch on for breakfast. It was a pretty slow morning, but those mornings were my favorites.

""You two are a little late."" Said Bahumth before taking another sip of her drink.

""Is it a problem for two ladies to spend time with one another?"" I retorted.

Bahumth only chuckled as she rolled her eyes.

""Besides, it doesn't look like we've missed much."" Vulthiss said as she chewed on her food.

""You got us there."" Tanca said as she glided her finger against her blade, testing how sharp it is.

""What about you, Glis?"" I asked the Vondac. ""How are you doing?""

""As fine as I can be."" He said.

I took in a big breath of pride as I looked at my family. I felt like everything is good in the world, and will be for some time.",8,1728836965.0,NatureofPredators,0,1.0,False
1g2tjvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSurgery/comments/1g2tjvb/4days_postop/,4days post-op ,"I am officially 4 days post-op and I honestly feel amazing!! Since being home I've had very little pain. On a scale on 1-10 the highest my pain has been was about a 5.5..... I was prescribed 14 oxycodone tablets and have only taken 4 of them, usually at night because that's when my body tends to stiffen up which hurts my sides. 

 I've made sure that I move around so that I don't lose range of motion. I've been sleeping in my recliner since the 9th because it has felt more secure but as of this morning, I have started gradually going back to my bed. Short walks around the house or outside.

My drains haven't been putting out much fluid (around 20ml per day). I get them out on Tuesday (6days post-op)

Bowel movements have not been frequent due to antibiotics. So to induce those I just drink a cup of hot coffee which has worked wonders üòÇ

I'm so ready to start driving again but I have to wait until I'm no longer in pain or needing pain meds. I'm also excited to see my chest for the first time which will be on Tuesday as well and will post an update!

1g2tjsf,https://www.reddit.com/r/PLABprep/comments/1g2tjsf/passing_plab1_and_plab2_on_the_first_time/,Passing PLAB1 and PLAB2 on the first time!,"Came to share my history with you guys and to actually be real and not pessimistic like most people here are (no, you don‚Äôt need to make people get so scared about the exams, that isn‚Äôt being realistic, it‚Äôs being pessimistic).

So, I already shared my PLAB 1 story here in which I basically studied for 4 months doing all PLABABLE questions and 21 mocks total (if I remember correctly). Plab 1, once you practice a lot with mocks (don‚Äôt be scared of them), it starts to become an instinct to answer the questions, so my advice is MOCKS. As many as you can do. My lowest mock score was 71% and my highest was 84%. Passed PLAB 1 with 144 questions, so please don‚Äôt freak out if your mocks aren‚Äôt 100%!

So, PLAB 2.

I took ARORA and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend any other one. To be honest, I think there are two types of people (none better than the other):
Group A: feels better doing a consultation naturally and that leads to medical thinking and building up a diagnosis.
Group B: feels better remembering a script as they‚Äôre scared the might blank.

So a few points to discuss:

a) GMC is aware there are courses that are teaching stations and not medicine, therefore they are (and they said so on my exam date) changing stations and coming up with new ones so scripted people will have a problem

b) An academy does not need to make you feel like a horrible doctor in order to teach you

c) There‚Äôs no such thing as ‚Äúif you say this it‚Äôs a fail‚Äù or ‚Äúif you do this it‚Äôs a fail‚Äù. That is complete bs, trust me

d) Interpersonal skills ARE important, but you can‚Äôt remember IPS as a script, trust me, it is noticeable. And how do you improve your IPS? Empathy. Literally that‚Äôs it, it‚Äôs like talking to a friend or a family member, you want them to feel comfortable and understood and unique when they‚Äôre talking to you. Make the patient feel the same way

e) I‚Äôve seen so many people saying if you don‚Äôt take Lovan you‚Äôre not passing, and that scared the s out of me, so I decided to pay for Lovan after ARORA and, PERSONAL OPINION, I do NOT like being taught a script, I do not like feeling dumb like sometimes he will make you feel, I do not like the way he teaches things and his classes are extremely exhausting. Summing up I took day one and stopped watching because I thought it was useless. I do recommend it though if you‚Äôre a script kind of person.

f) PLAB 2 is indeed hard. Does that mean it‚Äôs impossible? Absolutely not. It is a lot easier for people who have already been working because it‚Äôs literally what we do on a daily basis: going to the hospital and not knowing what patients we‚Äôll get and still being able to manage.

g) Do NOT compare yourself to others, PLEASE. If X is confident and you‚Äôre not, that does NOT make them better. I remember someone from my academy acting like the badass and laughing about people who didn‚Äôt do things they expected them to. This person did not pass, and the person he was laughing of did. So.

h) The key to PLAB 2 is PRACTICE. The key is feeling comfortable doing an organized consultation and getting cues like if the patient mentions something twice, it IS important, so take that cue. 

So how did it go for me?

I took PLAB1 in May, and got back to my country in the beginning of June. I was 99% sure I passed PLAB1 so I already paid for ARORA and started studying for PLAB2. I did all 180 cases from MOHSOBY (idk how to write sorry) throughout June just to know what to expect from PLAB2. In July I didn‚Äôt study at all. Got my PLAB1 results on July 4th, booked my PLAB2 for the middle of September. Started actually studying in August, when I took ARORA, and I practiced EVERYDAY at least 10 cases until 7 days before my exam.

What about prescription? AZT notes are the best choice. Write all the possible prescriptions and understand properly the reasoning for answers and how and where to write every information.

What about SIM-MAN? I literally have been working in A&E for the past 2 years and I can say that I am definitely ready to get unstable patients and manage them. I still did not pass the SIM-MAN because it was my last station and I was exhausted. Besides heart failure with non-audible crackles, and no medical history, no one knew what was happening to be honest. Anyways. Practice ABCDE and that‚Äôs it. ABCDE. ABCDE. ABCDE. Don‚Äôt skip steps.

What about procedure stations? Practice as much as you can. In my country all the possible procedures are done by nurses, so I had to remember all of them. Went to the academy twice to practice all stations.

What about anxiety? You WILL get anxious, you WILL blank out. How to deal with it? Do NOT study as you wait for your exam PLEASE, that will only trigger you into thinking you know nothing just because you didn‚Äôt remember a point about something. Just chill, drink a coffee, listen to music, watch some series.

What about the exam day? Very exhausting and stressful, to be honest, but just remember, it‚Äôs nothing different from what you do on a daily basis when working. 

Basically, stop reading people say the exam is impossible and the exam is so hard and all that. The exam is what you do on a daily basis, the difference is just you‚Äôll have to do it in 8 minutes.


Which reminds me:
- You will NOT get through everything in 8 minutes, trust me
- Focus on data gathering and IPS
- For management do the summarizing because they will see if you had more time you would have said it all - example: so we need to talk about X, Y and Z. And then you can get into details (if you have time)

P.s.: I passed 13 stations out of 15 (they excluded one from my day). 129 points.

At the end, you can do this. Trust me. And don‚Äôt let anyone make you feel like you can‚Äôt 

Hope that helped a bit x ",11,1728836913.0,PLABprep,5,0.87,False
1g2tjaj,https://www.reddit.com/r/floor_sitting/comments/1g2tjaj/newly_returning_to_sitting_on_the_floor_more_at/,"Newly returning to sitting on the floor more, at work and at home","(Just moved from my comfy couch down to the supportive ground to type this post.)
‚ö´Ô∏è
In the USA in 2024, the stigma of sitting and living in one of the most instinctual ways is real and also is one of the barriers for me to sitting more on the floor in my office, which is where I spend most of my time during the workweek in order to earn money to feed my family. Literally, it's easy to look down upon.
‚ö´Ô∏è
It's going to be a stretch to switch over over there, as I've always previously performed most of my duties at desks/tables and seated on chairs. One way to slowly work into it is to at times close my door and tackle floor-friendly tasks, like proofreading on paper -- which is The Way, by the way. Figuring out a ground-level laptop workstation that I can easily switch to and from is one of my next short-term goals, which that floor desk sub will hopefully help inspire.
‚ö´Ô∏è
Thankfully, I feel comfortable experimenting with this lifestyle change at home with my family and am excited to look into plush area rugs, repurpose a coffee table & other objects, and find inspiration in artfully designing rooms in my house that I can use more from the floor, while standing, or moving about.",3,1728836877.0,floor_sitting,0,1.0,False

1g2tj02,https://www.reddit.com/r/YetiCoolers/comments/1g2tj02/cups_and_rust/,Cups and Rust.,"My wife just got me a 30z cup for my birthday. It's not my first Yeti cup I've had two others just like it except different colors. This newest one and the last one I bought I have the same problem with. After a few hours of having just water little rust spots develop at the bottom of the cup. I strictly used these two cups just for water and only water. 

I've read the FaQs and how to care for the cups and also browsed on here and found suggestions to use Bar Keepers Friend. I tried that and they come right out and the cups can even sit for a few days and nothing happens but as soon as I fill it up with water and take it to work after a few hours while I'm drinking it I can look down and there are more spots again. 

I have a 20z which is my first ever Yeti from years ago and I've had everything from water, soda, coffee both hot and cold, juice, and whatever else in that cup not knowing at the time they recommend to stay away from certain liquids. And no matter what I put in there it remains rust free at the bottom. I end up using the 20z more often because I don't have to keep dealing with the rust but it's nice to have the larger cup to carry more water. 

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to keep this from happening or did the quality of the Stainless go down over the years?",1,1728836856.0,YetiCoolers,5,0.6,False

1g2thpc,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/1g2thpc/i_feel_like_ive_been_given_a_second_chance_at_life/,I feel like I‚Äôve been given a second chance at life,"I had a rough childhood‚Äîabusive parents, so bad they lost custody of us...constant parentification, hoarding, physical abuse so severe it led to scaring and badly healed bones, running away from home, health problems which were very preventable, and later being shuffled from one home to the next leading to no friends or support system. My saving grace was that I was good at school so I managed to get a scholarship to college in a town 4 hours away from where I was staying at the time. I couldn't wait to be self-sufficient and grounded. My early adulthood was better, but still I felt miserable. I spent those years working full-time while attending college, just grinding, feeling like I had no time to breathe, let alone be happy. Still, I managed to find friends and a boyfriend with the little free time I did have. Still, I felt like a zombie due to retail work, studying and just paying for life in general since this town is ridiculously expensive. I kept telling myself it‚Äôd get better someday, just trusting the process. And somehow, it did. The worst days are behind me. I earned my master‚Äôs in engineering, and last year, I landed my first real job in the field in a huge company that hires only like the top 1% of the graduates and for some reason chose me. But what really made it hit me that my life had changed was getting married.

I found the sweetest, kindest, most gorgeous man I could‚Äôve imagined, and now I‚Äôm his husband. He's also this huge, 6'8"", deep voiced, hairy teddy bear with a macho attitude, and he has a thing for wanting to protect his husband, so I think that played a big subconscious role as well. We've only been married for a month now, but dating for little over 5 years, and it feels like heaven. He was literally always there for me. I went from feeling like I was cursed to the luckiest guy on earth because of him. When we got married, I feel like it closed the chapter of my former life. It also gave me a new perspective in life. It‚Äôs like all those years of struggle melted away, and for the first time, I‚Äôm genuinely proud of my life. It all feels worth it now. It kind of feels like I‚Äôm living someone else‚Äôs life (but in a good way). I feel genuinely happy, like I am one of the fortunate ones. I can breathe. And the best part is, we‚Äôre only 26. We‚Äôve got our whole lives ahead of us, and I‚Äôm so excited for the future in a way I haven‚Äôt been in a long time. We plan on moving abroad soon so yay. Also, I took his surname so it feels even easier to start fresh. It doesn't feel like I am just surviving and trying to make the best out of a shitty situation, but actually living my life and planning our futures together. It feels like the dog days are over and that my time for happiness has come. I get to have my happier ever after.

This morning, we woke up, I made coffee and cornbread, and then I sat there watching him play competitive Pok√©mon on his laptop. I played with his beard while he smiled and gave me side looks. I felt this deep sense of peace I‚Äôve never known before. I am so excited for the future. It feels like the journey is just beginning.",24,1728836761.0,gaybros,5,0.97,False

I suspect I have attention deficit issues but I'm not sure if that's because of how my brain is or the fact that I have a pretty bad screen addition. 

I've never liked caffeine because it makes me anxious, jittery, fearful. I avoid coffee and drink decaffeinated tea. Lately, I've experimented with coffee and tea and even the slightest amount of caffeine quiets in the inner sounds of my head (constant thought, constant observation/judgement, a song stuck in my head, mental anxiety) but makes the external much louder (ambient sounds, people talking, any sensations, external anxiety). 

I tend to overthink everything, so maybe this is just what it is to feel the effect of caffeine and not me ""turning off"" a form of neurodivergence. People who are high on something do often think they are geniuses, lol.

I live in the room, he lives in the living room. He is always. always. home. If he leaves it‚Äôs only for 15 min af a time to go to the grocery store or cvs.

I have to pass by him to get to the door. If I leave he will usually ask ‚Äúwhere are you going?‚Äù Or something well-meaning but annoying/invasive.

There is no separation between hallway kitchen his makeshift bed. So it‚Äôs leave room‚Äî>be in other human being‚Äôs presence‚Äî>triggered into fight/flight/freeze.

I should mention my roommate is my older brother (4 years.) He likely has cptsd too. He‚Äôs very kind in letting me live here and does a BUNCH for me. Like a lot. There‚Äôs some enmeshment issues going on too- but that‚Äôs another story for another post.

Tomorrow he‚Äôs taken 2 days off from work and I‚Äôm dreading my life. Sure I could go to the library or the park but I can‚Äôt even get OUT I‚Äôm so frustrated .

Other factors include not having a working sink so I have to brush teeth/wash face using the shower, having very few clothes which I have to wash and rewear; walking is uncomfortable due to disability; having to groom/not liking the way I look‚Ä¶

But I can overcome those things when I am alone. I actually feel pretty chill when I‚Äôm alone. Like I have symptoms but I can manage them way better. I‚Äôve come such a long way! (I used to not leave even when he wasn‚Äôt home, that‚Äôs when I was in acute PTSD mode when I first moved in)

This last week I was visiting and wanted the campground experience, so decided not to stay with family.  I was shocked at the behavior of some of the campground hosts that work for Vista Recreation, a private company who manages the campgrounds around Tahoe.  
    At Fallen Leaf Campground they were snooping around my campsite at all hours.  They told me each time that it was their job to check fire rings and bear lockers for food.  It was disturbing having them driving by in golf carts looking for rule breaking constantly.  I really follow all the rules, and really just wanted some peaceful time in the forest.  
    Nevada Beach was the worst!  I was enjoying my morning coffee and out of nowhere comes this campground host livid with me.  He comes flying into my campsite jumping out of his golf cart before it even stops!  Fists balled up ready to fight he tells me I have no reservations and need to leave!  I do have a valid reservation with appropriate camp tag ect.  He keeps not believing me even when I show him proof.  He is sure I must have a counterfeit tag, and hacked the reservation system.  I am dealing with an irrational boomer host and quite at a loss to calm him down.  A person with that temperament should never have a job as a campground host.  I have gone to the website to complain but see no way to file a complaint.  So here I am on Reddit üòÇ It seems that the campground hosts think they own the campgrounds.  I think they are given so much power in the positions of hosts, they have gotten drunk on the power.  A 14 day limit on camping should be applied to all, including campgrounds hosts to curb this behavior.  Nobody should be allowed past 14 day limit, even campground hosts.  They start acting like they own the place!  I‚Äôll end my rant by asking if someone knows who I can bring my concerns to?  Would it be the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit?

Back with a little update. My taste and smell have been returning over the last several days, especially with food. So I've been making some coffee every day since Thursday to see what's what. 


Thursday morning: made some more House That Gesha Built, and boy all I could taste was sour. The smell was okay and smelled like se cheap coffee, but it just tasted awful....


Friday morning: still sour, but had a little bit of flavor, although I can't really tell what. 


Saturday morning: sourness is pretty much gone, but I am having a hard time really tasting what's what in this coffee as I can't really pick out any flavors, but I can taste something!


Sunday morning: more of the same of Saturday unfortunately. It smells how I would expect and I can taste a little bit of the light floral notes up front, but on the back end it becomes a weird sour flavor that I can't describe. 


I guess the point of this update is to let y'all know I'm still having a hard time tasting the more complex flavors that coffee has to offer, but can enjoy some simple flavors at the moment. ",8,1728836200.0,pourover,10,0.84,False

2. **Runner for entry way** (not sure what to do for this, but I believe something more subtle than the area rug to let the area rug stand out more?)
3. **Floor lamp** for back left corner next to the couch (I have been looking at various options, but not sure what would look best)
4. **Small coffee table** that can be moved under the window when space is needed (I like [this](https://i0.wp.com/studio12-12.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/il_fullxfull.606468610_lfxo.jpg?fit=1500%2C1018&ssl=1) style of ""MCM"" coffee table due to its simplicity and lightweight design, but I also don't have a dedicated place to eat other than my desk right now, so a pop-up coffee table might make more sense
5. **Art for behind couch** (Not sure if I would want to do a single wide piece or a three piece set, but would want it to tie in with the couch and rug of course.

I am trying not to break the bank too hard, so I have been looking second-hand for coffee tables, lamps and art.

Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated!",1,1728836101.0,interiordecorating,0,1.0,False

It‚Äôs been about.. 6 years I think? Since making a stool in freshman year üòÖ And never touched the craft since, but moving into a new room had me wanting to design things to my liking. 


Any critique and feedback would be appreciated, wanting to learn ways to improve, what I could‚Äôve done differently, etc ‚ù§Ô∏è",4,1728836100.0,BeginnerWoodWorking,0,0.83,False

1. My partner and I will be there on the 2nd of December. We land in KEF at midnight, and fly out that same day at like 5pm.
2. Wondering if it's easier to rent a car for our short trip or go the tour bus/flybus/excursion route?
3. I've heard driving at this time of year is tough because it's so windy and dark, is this true?
4. Any must-sees? Thinking about Blue Lagoon, coffee shops, general beautiful naturescapes.

Thanks!",0,1728836081.0,VisitingIceland,3,0.5,False
