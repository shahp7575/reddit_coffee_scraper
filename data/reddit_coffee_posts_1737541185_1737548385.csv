I am medicated now, I take Concerta and it has made me friends with my brain, but I stillll have problems with sleep and napping is still impossible.

Every time my toddler hits a rough spot with their sleep, I become a walking zombie. I have tried countless tricks to try and fall asleep while he‚Äôs at daycare or napping at home, and I absolutely am not able to. Its like my mind goes into overtired mode and I‚Äôm unable to drift off. 

A couple of nights a week i take a quarter of quetiapine and fall asleep with no problems. I can‚Äôt do it during the day however, as it has intense sedative effect for me.

I‚Äôve tried guided meditation, dif breathing techniques, white noise, brown noise, sleep masks, weighted blankets, podcasts, a cup of coffee, noise cancelling headphones and yada yada.

Said i was a scammer. I was like, i don't know many scammers that shovel front yards and drink hot cocoa in your kitchen. Berlinda laughed and told her i lived next door. She shockingly, well to me anyway, said to her grandma, ""He's not the super handsome guy I saw earlier this year"".

Concerned mommy here, my baby is 12 months in a few days & I have a question that always has so many mixed answers I would just like to hear everyone‚Äôs opinion & maybe recommendations.

My husband works an extremely demanding job sometimes with night shifts while I‚Äôm a Sahm for the moment. All the chores, cooking cleaning laundry etc is on me which I‚Äôm ok with because I genuinely enjoy taking care of our space. However, as baby got older so less naps & more attachment, I have had to let him have some screen time.

For example; he wakes up at 5-6 am & I sometimes don‚Äôt sleep early still doing chores or just want to spend time with my husband. So I wake up & need a sec.  Need to make my coffee, make us breakfast & put dishes away etc, so I‚Äôll let him watch Ms Rachel. Another example, it‚Äôs coming close to the time that husband comes back home from work so illl let him watch while I prepare dinner. He is bored of his toys & wont sit in his playroom alone to play like he used to. 

I don‚Äôt have a village, don‚Äôt have relatives that have time to help as everyone is working or in university. My own family is not in the same country either so I really don‚Äôt have anyone I can invite over to avoid him watching tv when I‚Äôm busy. 

I hope this post is met with kindness as I really don‚Äôt know what to do. I am a doctor myself & know the deprecating effects of too much screen time, but I don‚Äôt know what else to do :(

I made this community because I wanted a location I can shamelessly talk about what I watch, I know there‚Äôs already an Anime community and I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs stuff similar to what I‚Äôm aiming for but, I want it to be called mine, I want to talk about certain things that might not be allowed elsewhere.

So Here‚Äôs the current what‚Äôs allowed

1. Opinionated post about anime. Not exclusive to anime I‚Äôll be a bit lenient and I‚Äôll even allow video games, movies, tv shows and stuff, until I find a way to label them tho please make it clear when you‚Äôre not talking about Anime.

2. I‚Äôll allow versus battles too but with a caveat. To make those discussions more interesting, less one sided, and less toxic, For crossverse: assume all magic system are equal (Chakra = Ki = Spiritual Pressure = Curse = Mana etc) and assume characters are relative to the verse they are battling. 
I‚Äôll use One Punch Man and Naruto for example, using Saitama and Rock Lee, if you dump Saitama into the Naruto world then expect him to be relative to Rock Lee (based on his work out regime) vice verse if Rock Lee gets dumped into Saitama world he‚Äôs relative to Saitama. Poor example but hopefully you get what I mean. Lastly keep characters in character and headcannon is allowed. For example Goku doesn‚Äôt blow up planets so when he inevitably fights Luffy or Naruto you can‚Äôt use ‚ÄúGoku can blow up planets‚Äù as a defense to why he can beat Naruto and Luffy, actually get creative.

3. Lightning Scaling if anyone is interested in using is as follows: 0 = Didn‚Äôt make it past the first episode and it doesn‚Äôt have potential, 1 = Didn‚Äôt make it past the first episode but it could be someone‚Äôs cup of tea it has potential just not my tea, I prefer coffee, 2-4 = Didn‚Äôt finish, don‚Äôt really like it. 5 = I either finished it or didn‚Äôt like it, or I didn‚Äôt finish it cuz the pacing is horrendous but I could have finished it cuz it‚Äôs likable. 6 = Decent, I liked it. 7 = It got me to feel things but it could have been better but I liked it for what it is. 8 = Awesome I liked it. 9 = Probably wouldn‚Äôt watch it again but I wouldn‚Äôt change the channel if it came on or wouldn‚Äôt leave if someone else is watching it but it was good and I might remember it for a while. 10 = Might have changed my life but one thing is certain this anime was it.

We have been living in Wittevrouwen for 5 years (rental) and are so in love with this part of the city and would love to buy here.

To avoid falling asleep while driving...,"I've been trying for years to quit caffeine, last year I managed for a week then I realised I was falling asleep at the workplace.

Some years earlier I also had migraine but this time not. I felt great physically and mentally, but also less resistance to sleep.

It's not just about looking alert, but also about not finding myself suddenly in front of a tree.

Obviously I cannot avoid having to drive, and I can't even have a post-lunch nap.

Cutting down for me it's not an option. I have the same issue with snacks at the vending machine. I drink coffee and eat mostly out of boredom.

It's my first time in this subreddit that I just realized existed, so I thank you firstly for your patience.

Last coffee at the vending machine was disgusting and I really would like to quit.

I stopped smoking years ago thanks to the Allen Carr Only way book (not the easy way, the other one that delved deeper) and I also read ""how to quit caffeine"" of the same book collection, written by a doctor of Carr's clinic.

I understand how it's not good for me, how I don't need it, that I can drink caffieine-free red tea, but there is still the problem that I have to go to work by car.

Last summer I wanted to take advantage of the vacation period, but I had my SO constantly telling me that I looked asleep all the time and that one cup wouldn't hurt. Of course I couldn't manage having one and only one.

So I was talking to a guy on hinge with who I had a great conversation.

Turns out by a huge coincidence he works at a radio station that I work in one day a week. I hadn‚Äôt  really heard from him during the break but I texted him when I was back and he said he was too.
I texted him again later saying I‚Äôd be working at the radio so that he wouldn‚Äôt be blindsided. He was like okay great so not much reaction by text. He then left me on read for the rest of our conversation. When I saw him for the first time it was a very close work setting and we were next to each other the entire time. We were both nervous I can tell and he seems shy but we still managed to talk. He finished later as he actually is an employee but I gained the confidence to ask him if he might want to get a coffee once he has finished and he seemed very happy too. He said he‚Äôd let me know when he was done. He never did so I went home. The next day I put a question about book recommendations in my story and he answered so I texted him asking about it. I said sorry if I made him uncomfortable and he said that he needed to apologize to me instead for not texting me but that we could do something on a weekend. I saw him at work today and everything was normal and chatty. At lunch we both went to a supermarket talked the whole way back and forth. Right as we were going back into the office I said that if he had changed his mind it was 100% okay if he wanted to forget about before but that I needed to know. He said he was very busy ( which is true) and that he goes home on some weekends ( not in the same city) but that he would be down to get a drink on a weekend. I said I didn‚Äôt want to force him and he said he wouldn‚Äôt be. Everything was like before and I‚Äôve left home now.

I have an AGARO Regency Espresso Machine and it has been extremely hard trying to find the perfect bottomless portafilter scouring internet for a long time.

Last month I ordered a bottomless portafilter from LOOMTREE on Amazon. I was extremelt skeptic about it since no reviews and looked shady. It is a china export so it takes over 20 days to arrive. 

Review:- The portafilter has been a very good addition to my setup. It is really good to use albeit some problems. Extreme fine grind has been causing the spout the spray everywhere (will try a paper filter to see if it helps). Besides that it has been consistent so far, fine but not too fine coffee works great and it is a joy to see the coffee spout.

And nag yes naman ako kasi wala naman na kong ginagawa tsaka plano ko na sanang umuwi dahil parang tatrangkasuhin ako. While naglalakad kami, may isang group ng lalaki na parang kakain rin sila and lahat ng mata nila samin nakatingin na para bang kinikilig sila. Yun pala may hawak syang isang sunflower, inabot nya sakin na parang nahihiya. Sabi niya, para sayo (with a smile) everytime kasi na nagsstory ako, lagi akong may emoji na sunflower ‚Äî super gandang ganda ako don. Anyways, sabi ko, wowww, thank you!! **super kinilig ako, pero napaisip ako why naman this time nagbigay siya ng flower, hindi chocolate or ibang bagay. That moment parang gusto kong humiyaw sa sobrang saya ng heart ko. Pero kinalma ko sarili ko. Nung nasa elevator kaming lahat with the group of boys, hinawakan niya ko sa balikat para umusad ako sa likod niya (siguro para hindi ako masiksik or masanggi dahil mejo puno yung elev) parang ang awkward nung time na yun feeling ko rinig nilang lahat yung mabilis na tibok ng puso ko hanggang sa nagsalita siya bigla kung saan ko gustong kumain, ano yung gusto ko kasi baka may cravings daw ako. Di ko naman siya pinahirapan, sabi ko okay ako kahit saan basta may coffee since inaantok ako. Nagsmile siya na parang gusto kong malusaw.

Im speaking from a guy perspective so thats why my title is that way. This dilemma is really explain in this ine example. 
Im so confused by this one girl. She gives so many mixed signals and hot n cold behavior. I know some people would say move on and I have for the most part but I'm just trying to put it together. 

For example, we met 2 yrs ago. I was a shy kid in my grad program. She saw me around and told me to sit next to her. After that she would tell me to get coffee with her. It took about 4 months for me to warm up to her. I really thought she was cool because she would act interested and playful tease me. She remembers every detail that I tell her and she would touch me on the shoulder a few times. 

After a year of knowing her, I developed feelings. Once I tried to pursue her, she backs up. She won't even talk to me in class anymore. She no longer laughs at my jokes. I'm no longer on her radar at all. She didn't even frienzone me because she won't even talk to me at all. Here's the wierd part though. When she gets drunk, she will flirt with me for hours. She also hovers around me saying don't leave her. So what's the deal? 

I understand mixed signals are a sign of low interest. But why would anyone befriend someone just to reject them overtime. I understand that she could be an attention seeker but she specifically targets me and consistently tries to get me to open up. 

Above all I feel like i lost friend. She helped me come out of my shell. I only started to party because of her due to invites. Now I feel like I never knew her and it just been a game to her. 
I'm lowkey crying over her because I invested a year and half getting to know a pathological liar who I really thought cared about me. Why would anyone go through effort of befriended someone just to drop them the minute they start to reciprocate. 

Because if I just kept acting aloof and shy I could have stayed with her for life. ",0,1737546913.0,dating_advice,8,0.5,False

Hi I am 18F and I worked in a consultancy. I should've seen the red flags honestly, during the interview he said he would pay me 20k and I was happy and accepted it. I wanted the job for an experience and I had reached through an instagram ad (please please never do this and even if you are doing be super clear about everything before you go and check the workplace i learned it the hardway). this guy was a total weirdo the first day of work itself. He made weird comment about his ex employee and i figured they might have been in the wrong but oh boy was i in for a ride. My work was content creation but I did everything that included making SOP for other people and making data and calling people from the consultancy to come for counselling to the point i was scolded by alot of people as well. 

The weird part is this ""boss"" used to openly curse at us saying ""fucking , bitch "" and all that in a professional setting to me and this didis (there were a few of us) and we werent okay. He even told didi that she was easily replaceable and her bf would easily replace her too cause she is a woman. He often told women were not ambitious enough and how this is his company and he will do whatever. Since I was the social media manager too i had put a few complains on why the media marketing isnt working but he dismissed me saying i dont know shit and he even did this with the didis but when a man said it he immediately changed it. He also said ""Womens prime is 25-30 cause thats when they can give birth the best"" which honestly just is that women are only there to give birth. He constantly shamed me for where i was going to study even tho it ranked wayyy better than the schools that he was sending the kids that came to the consultancy too. He made weird comments about appearances like how didi is a bit too dark for his liking and how I am fair but i act like a guy so thats a huge turn off for guys and wont get me and bf. he saw my phone notification once and kept telling me to show my bf to him as well. 

he was also a weirdo who refused to pay pani wala dai haru and dismissed them as dirty and stuff it was weird honestly and we didnt get lunch and shit as well. tara he once tried to cause a fight between me and my co workers where he said that my co workers didnt like me and because of me there has been like demotivation and he told me that my co workers said that but when i went to confront them about it they told me they never said it and the fact that there is one didi i am closest too and ik she just wouldnt say that at all she actually was feeling so horrible about all this. he even said that we girls should learn how to shave cause body hair makes him feel disgusted and he said that we are competing with him in ""haat ko butla ko race""

Well, i asked him for my salary at the end of the month and he took me to his office and said he will pay me 12k and i said according to government ko law its 17,300 so you cant do that but he kept saying fuck government this is his empire and stuff and he said he has money to sustain himself for 4-5 years but he wouldn't give me any cause i dont deserve it , it was a 9-5 job and 16k was wasted on lunch and my travel to work and i told him but he said people like me should be working for free and i said i will quit and i did 

Alot of other weird stuff was that he se\*ually harassed this didi by giving her a weird hug as well in the end he gave me 10k and called me ""sweetheart""  and 30 something calling a 18 year old that way and that he showed me mercy and stuff

this shit place is running an ad again and yea just dont join anything unless its verified please double check   
he gives low pay to everyone and makes us do odd job like making his coffee and all even tho we only applied for one job and tyo pani khate 10k ko salary ma i did sm 

my advice- please please beware esto manche haru dherai hunchan and insta ko ad bata ta dont join nei scam nei huncha hau and if you face esto problem specially at mero age then just tell your mom and dad i did a mistake thinking they would judge me for this shit and all but if you are facing it tell them",3,1737546822.0,NepalSocial,8,1.0,False

### **Chapter 1: The Bargain**     
     
The late afternoon sun filtered through the stained glass windows of Sebasti√°n Montalvo y Estrella‚Äôs private study in Casa Montalvo, casting fractured hues of gold and red across his desk. A map of Europe lay open before him, its edges curling with age. A faint coffee stain marked Vienna, a city that had come to dominate his thoughts of late.

Sebasti√°n leaned back in his chair, the weight of the world pressing down on his shoulders. He traced the faint lines of Austria‚Äôs borders with his finger, his mind lost in the echoes of history. The intelligence reports piled beside him whispered of an Aryan resurgence‚Äîa threat cloaked in beauty, seduction, and the allure of cultural superiority.

The sound of footsteps broke his reverie. The door opened, and Prime Minister Javier R√≠os entered, followed by Isabella V√©lez-Campo. Both wore expressions that matched the storm brewing outside the mansion walls.

‚ÄúThank you for coming,‚Äù Sebasti√°n said, gesturing to the chairs opposite him.

R√≠os sat heavily, his brow furrowed. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt leave us much of a choice. Your summons sounded like a fire alarm.‚Äù

Sebasti√°n gave a faint smile, though it didn‚Äôt reach his eyes. ‚ÄúIt is a fire. One we may not be able to put out.‚Äù


---

An Uneasy Alliance

Isabella leaned forward, her sharp eyes scanning the map. ‚ÄúAustria. That‚Äôs where the reports are coming from?‚Äù

Sebasti√°n nodded. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just a resurgence‚Äîit‚Äôs an echo of something buried. A movement leveraging art, culture, and charm to mask its real intentions. We‚Äôre seeing the same rhetoric, just wrapped in a prettier package.‚Äù

R√≠os‚Äôs jaw tightened. ‚ÄúBeauty as a weapon. It‚Äôs an old trick, but effective. People are drawn to it, captivated before they realize the poison beneath.‚Äù

Sebasti√°n stood, pacing the room. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just beauty. It‚Äôs the momentum of history. This isn‚Äôt a new problem‚Äîit‚Äôs a consequence of an old bargain.‚Äù

Isabella frowned. ‚ÄúThe deal from the independence negotiations?‚Äù

Sebasti√°n stopped, his back to them, and stared out the window. ‚ÄúYes. The deal that tied Puerto Rico‚Äôs expansion to Austria‚Äôs resurrection. Two hearts bound across oceans, beating in rhythm until one falters. And now, it‚Äôs faltering.‚Äù


---

The Seduction of Power

The narrative shifted to a Viennese gala, where Puerto Rican Ambassador Claudia Herrera navigated a sea of opulence and elegance. Chandeliers dripped with crystal, their light refracting off gilded walls. Music played softly in the background, the strains of a violin weaving through the murmurs of conversation.

Claudia adjusted her shawl, her eyes scanning the room. She was here to observe, to gather intelligence on the Austrian elite. But the atmosphere was intoxicating, a heady blend of charm and danger.

A voice cut through the air like silk. ‚ÄúAmbassador Herrera, I presume?‚Äù

Claudia turned to see Countess Helena von Strasser, a vision of poise and grace. Her smile was disarming, her gaze sharp as a blade.

‚ÄúCountess,‚Äù Claudia replied, her tone measured.

Helena gestured toward the ballroom. ‚ÄúDo you enjoy Vienna? It has a way of captivating the soul, does it not?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs certainly captivating,‚Äù Claudia said, her voice cool. ‚ÄúThough I imagine that‚Äôs the point.‚Äù

Helena‚Äôs laugh was soft, melodic. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre perceptive. Beauty is a language all its own, Ambassador. It speaks directly to the heart, bypassing reason and doubt. Perhaps that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so often misunderstood.‚Äù

‚ÄúOr weaponized,‚Äù Claudia countered.

Helena tilted her head, her smile never wavering. ‚ÄúA matter of perspective, perhaps. But tell me, what does Puerto Rico see when it looks at Vienna?‚Äù

Claudia held the Countess‚Äôs gaze. ‚ÄúA lesson.‚Äù

Leviathan Awakens

Back in Casa Montalvo, Sebasti√°n sat alone in his study, the map of Europe now accompanied by a stack of reports from Director Ernesto Morales. Each page detailed Austria‚Äôs resurgence, its cultural revival, and the growing whispers of a new ideology.

He picked up a letter from Claudia, her observations from Vienna painting a vivid picture of the danger ahead.

Claudia‚Äôs Letter:
The Countess is everything we feared‚Äîcharismatic, cunning, and utterly devoted to the cause. She uses beauty to veil her intent, and it works. People are drawn to her, even as she guides them toward ruin. The movement is growing, Sebasti√°n, and it‚Äôs only a matter of time before it crosses borders.

Sebasti√°n set the letter down, his mind racing. He turned to the map, his fingers tracing the stained mark over Vienna.

‚ÄúThe beast cannot be destroyed,‚Äù he murmured to himself. ‚ÄúBut it can be contained.‚Äù

His reflection stared back at him from the window, the fading light casting his features in shadow. The road ahead was clear, though fraught with peril. If Austria‚Äôs resurrection threatened the balance, then he would be the one to restore it.

And so, the bargain would be renegotiated.",1,1737545748.0,hdfidelity,0,1.0,False

Wake up, meditate, coffee, shower, physical therapy (on weekdays), then work. Lengthenings are 8 AM, 10 AM, 4 PM, and 8 PM.

My legs have experienced some atrophy, mostly in my quads. To combat this, I've started doing some additional exercises that were approved by PT. My legs muscles have remained relatively stable since I integrated these additional exercises.

For the first time, I am noticing my increase in height. It is still fairly insignificant, but it is becoming more and more significant each day. This is most noticable when standing beside people you see every day. Folks I used to see eye to eye with, I now have to look slightly down to when I talk with them. 

I've also grown to appreciate the driver. I haven't had too many difficulties getting in or out of the vehicle, but I have seen some of the other clients (especially newer ones) have a tough time. Without someone to help them in, I could see the potential for a fall.

Today (January 22nd) is day 15. I had my X-rays and we measured the increase in length. One leg was ~1.2 cm +/- 1 mm, and the other was slightly more ~1.4 cm +/- 1 mm. Some of the increase in length came from the initial surgery, and the rest (~1 cm) from distraction. My bone is filling in nicely (you can see it filling in on the X-rays) and my range of motion is excellent. We took the bandages off my incision sites, and everything has healed up nicely. Based on the looks of things, I should have minimal scarring.

My experience has been great so far. I am in excellent health and I am lengthening slowly each day. I miss going outdoors and my girlfriend back home, but besides that life is good.",1,1737545684.0,limblengthening,0,1.0,False

## 2025's Best Wheelchair Cup Holder Attachments: Top Picks, Reviews & Comparisons

Staying hydrated while using a wheelchair is essential for comfort, health, and overall well-being.However, juggling a drink while navigating your daily life can be challenging, even hazardous. That‚Äôs where the right wheelchair cup holder attachment comes into play. in this complete guide, we'll explore the top options for 2025, delving into their features, benefits, and suitability for various needs. We're not just listing products; we‚Äôre providing insights to help both wheelchair users and their caregivers make informed purchasing decisions - and perhaps even offering some guidance for healthcare professionals and DME retailers navigating this often-overlooked product category.

From simple to sophisticated, we understand that not every cup holder is created equal. So, whether you need a reliable way to carry your morning coffee, a secure spot for your water bottle, or a versatile drink holder for your power chair, we‚Äôve got you covered. This guide will consider factors like durability, ease of use, and adaptability, ensuring you find the perfect mobility aid drink holder to improve your daily life.

### Why a Wheelchair Cup Holder Matters

Before diving into the specifics, it's essential to acknowledge the fundamental need that these seemingly small accessories address. for wheelchair users, a seemingly simple task like holding a beverage can become difficult. Holding a drink during movement can lead to spills, making a mess, and potential discomfort for the user. More considerably, the need to manage a drink can affect safety and independence. A secure and easily operated wheelchair cup holder attachment simplifies these challenges by:

* **Promoting hands-Free Hydration**: By keeping beverages readily available without needing to hold them, a cup holder frees up hands for navigation and other tasks. This is notably vital for those with limited mobility or dexterity.
* **Increasing Convenience**: A drink instantly to hand can make all the difference in daily routines. This avoids the user having to rely on others each time they need fluids, leading to increased independence and convenience.
* **Enhancing Safety**: spills not only cause inconvenience, they can also create slipping hazards, a concern that wheelchair users need to pay attention to. Secure holders prevent these accidents.
* **Improving Comfort and Independence:** A wheelchair cup holder allows the user to have access to drinks at any moment, improving their overall quality of life. It fosters self-sufficiency,allowing users to manage their own hydration needs without constant assistance.
* **Reducing Risk**: If someone is attempting to juggle both a drink and navigating their wheelchair at once they risk losing focus and compromising their personal safety.

### Key Features to Look For in a Wheelchair Cup Holder

Choosing the right cup holder goes beyond simply picking the frist one you see,it is indeed crucial to carefully assess your specific requirements. Consider these important factors that address the needs of wheelchair users, caregivers, and medical professionals, alike:

1.**Type of Mounting System:**  The mounting mechanism is crucial for secure fit and stability. You‚Äôll commonly find:
   * **clamp Mounts:** These use a clamp to secure the cup holder to the wheelchair frame.they are generally versatile and fit a range of frame tubing sizes. Make sure the clamp is robustly built and has a mechanism to protect the frame from damage. Look for options with rubber padding. For power chairs and mobility scooters,be sure the clamp is compatible with their larger frame diameters.  A wheelchair cup holder with clamp needs to be simple to operate and durable.
   * **Bolt-On Mounts:** These offer more permanent placements but require drilling (sometimes pre-drilled holes exist in some wheelchair designs). They might potentially be more stable for frequent use and heavier containers, if such is your needs.
   * **Hook-and-Loop (Velcro) Straps:** offer a versatile, if less permanent, attachment method for frames where clamps are unsuitable or in emergency circumstances.

2. **Adjustability:**  A great wheelchair cup holder should be adaptable to various drinks. Consider:
    * **Adjustable Grip:** Look for holders that can accommodate different cup sizes, from standard mugs and cans to larger water bottles. Many have adjustable arms or rings that fit varying diameters and a wide range of drink containers.* **Swivel Bases:**  Having a cup holder that can swivel can be very helpful when you‚Äôre maneuvering in tight spaces or on uneven terrain, keeping it upright and reducing spillage.
    * **Angle Adjustment:** The ability to adjust the angle will help to keep drinks level depending on the mounting point.3. **Material & Durability:** The chosen material impacts resilience.
    * **Robust construction:** Choose cup holders made from durable,weather-resistant materials like high-quality ABS plastic,reinforced steel,or a combination of these. A durable wheelchair drink holder is paramount for longevity.
    * **Lightweight Design:** If portability is important, find one that is lightweight but still strong. Heavier models can add unneeded weight to the wheelchair.* **Rust-Resistance:** Especially if the cup holder will be exposed to the elements, rust-resistant materials are a must.

4. **Ease of Installation and Use**: A worldwide cup holder for wheelchair users should be easy to manage.
   *  **Tool-Free Installation:** Ideal for swift setup and removal. Easy install wheelchair cup holder designs are preferred by most users and carers.
    * **One-Handed Operation:** Designs that enable users to install or adjust the cup holder using only one hand can be very beneficial for some.
    * **intuitive Operation:** The installation must be easy to manage by people who have reduced mobility.

5. **Stability and Security:** the main aim is to hold beverages securely preventing spills and accidents, so look for:
    * **Secure Grip:** Ensure your chosen model grips vessels firmly to prevent tipping when navigating.
    * **Anti-Slip Design:** Padding or rubberized surfaces on the clamp will improve grip and prevent movement on the frame.6.**Portability and Compact Size**:.A portable wheelchair cup holder is useful for travel and storage situations.
    * **Foldable Design:** Some designs can fold away when not in use, making storage and transportation easier.

7. **Compatibility with Mobility Devices:**
    * **Wheelchair Specific:** Some cup holders might be specifically designed to work with certain manual or electric wheelchair models or dimensions.
     * **Mobility Scooter and Power Chair:** Look for universal cup holders that state that they work with a variety of both chair and scooter models.
   *  **Other Mobility Aids:** Also, consider some walkers and stroller cup holder options which are similar in function, if these suit your specific needs.

8. **Additional Features:**
     * **Phone Slot:** Some drink holders have an integrated slot to hold a mobile phone adding convenience and accessibility.
    * **storage Tray:** Some models may include a small storage tray for your essentials, small items or even keys.

M10 and I ate tacos but F7 and F10 didn‚Äôt.  They had rice and beans and mac n cheese, respectively.  Yesterday was a snow day.  It didn‚Äôt need to be.  Roads were plenty clear but the school had prepped a lot and we had a snow day.  And I ended up screwing up the day.  

M10 got up and did his homework on his school computer and then goofed off.  F10 got up and worked on her school work on her computer. She even called the teacher to help negotiate the school programming that wasn‚Äôt working well.  F7 did not.  I didn‚Äôt realize that, of course.

So they had 3 jobs yesterday:  1.  Do the school work.  2.  Take all the hanging laundry and put it up.  3.  Clean room.  Then they could play and goof and whatever they wanted.  Because M10‚Äôs room was already clean, he and I tackled a disaster area, the crafting cabinet.  It was gross.  It‚Äôs clean now but dang.  

F7 didn‚Äôt do her stuff and drug her feet on her homework.  I got pretty frustrated but I didn‚Äôt melt down.  She eventually finished and we made it to her piano lesson on time.  

Moral of the story:  start to work first thing and don‚Äôt sit around enjoying your coffee.  If you crack the whip at first you can relax after.  My fault on that.  F7 just isn‚Äôt a self starter.  She also has trouble staying focused and I have to realize that and do a little more hovering.  

Anyway, we made it, the house is incrementally cleaner and everyone had a shower last night.  

We start today clean!

Basically I have it since longtime, but since I tried to treat it I noticed it became worse and worse. Tried for 6/7 months every sleep supplement and med, so found out their effects wear off and after a while give stimulating effects (so less sleep than before).

Question: I see many people treating insomnia through any kind of supplement... one time a psychiatric friend of my dad told me that all the supplements that should treat insomnia are bullshit, basically because their effects won't last FOREVER, as I thought. LOL. Can we say that a sleep supplement or med is necessary only for short term periods?

What I experienced in many cases is an internal grief and resignation, since I can't do many things without a proper sleep.

Follow every sleep rule, circadian rhythm, walk etc. Yoga nidra helped me but only if I do it properly

Drunk lot of coffee in the years, but this took me not to understand myself anymore, until I realised 1 year ago I had insomnia. Do you know an other NATURAL method to sleep well?

And did blood exams and everything was fine.

In a world full of programs and movies, daydreaming may seem like a waste of time. But science says otherwise‚Äîletting your thoughts wander can be a really powerful tool for creativity, problem solving, and emotional well-being.  
  
Why daydreaming is important  
Stimulates creativity: When your mind wanders, it puts ideas together in unexpected ways, sparking new solutions.  
Enhances Problem Solving: Daytime sleep allows your brain to mentally tackle challenges, often leading to success.  
Relieves stress: Escaping into a fantasy world can be a peaceful escape from everyday stresses.  
How to embrace daydreaming  
Regularly unplug: Get away from your devices and let your mind wander naturally.  
Find quiet moments: Walking in nature, taking a coffee break, or looking out the window can be the perfect time to daydream.  
Journal Your Thoughts: Let your random thoughts flow to paper‚Äîyou may stumble upon a brilliant idea.  
Leisure Time Management: Allow yourself guilt-free time when you ‚Äúdo nothing‚Äù. Your brain will thank you.  
Beautiful things in mind  
Daydreaming reminds us of the infinite possibilities our imagination can produce. It makes us feel wonderful, inspires curiosity, and keeps our inner child alive.  
  
So let your mind wander today. Embrace the art of doing nothing. You just might find that the answers, ideas and passion you‚Äôve been looking for are within you.

I'm quite conscientious and happy to go the extra mile, while he is the polar opposite.

He is constantly running into the canteen for food/coffee, running off to the toilet to use his phone, hiding in corners of the warehouse to use his phone, running off outside to smoke a vape and he generally just drags himself around trying to get to the end of the day.

There is a culture in our work (which I agree with to an extent) to not throw your colleagues under the bus. I of course adhere to this rule but the fact that me and Tom get paid the same money when we absolutely do not have the same job is really starting to eat at me.

I have a pay review coming up in a few months and want to lay all of this out to my manager, but I really don't know how to go about it.
Does anyone have any advice or has anyone been in a similar situation?

1i78rpb,https://www.reddit.com/r/hyderabad/comments/1i78rpb/my_unconventional_journey_to_america/,My unconventional Journey to America,"Most people's journey to the United States follows a well worn path: get a master's degree then land a job. But my story? Let's just say I took the scenic route.

It all started with a B1/B2 visa I'd gotten for a World Bank conference that never materialized. Talk about a plot twist! Fast forward to me working at this tech company for just three months (about as long as it takes to figure out where the office coffee machine is). Suddenly a golden opportunity dropped into my lap: an important conference in the US.

Here's where it gets interesting. The company founders couldn't make it due to some visa issues and there I was sitting pretty with a valid visa burning a hole in my pocket. The conference was starting Monday and I found out about this chance on Friday. Talk about cutting it close! The company agreed to cover the conference tickets but everything else? That was on me. No problem I thought channeling my inner adventurer.

I booked two flights: one for the immediate journey and another for three months later. Because why not be optimistic? The real challenge was figuring out accommodation in New York City where even the pigeons probably pay rent. But fortune favors the bold! During my layover in Dubai of all places I managed to connect with some guys sharing a place in Jersey City. Sometimes the best plans come together while you're waiting for a connecting flight!

The conference itself was great but here's the kicker: there was a hackathon I hadn't known about. Picture this: I'm there running on enthusiasm and empty pockets when I somehow cobbled together a team with complete strangers. And would you believe it? We won first place! The Elizabeth J Hackathon blessed me with a $5000 prize which in New York might cover lunch for a week. Just kidding! It actually funded my entire American adventure taking me from the concrete jungle of NYC to North Carolina and all the way to Texas.

You know what inspired this whole crazy journey? The story of Swami Vivekananda who once attended a world religious conference at Chicago with nothing but faith in his pocket. It reminded me that sometimes the best paths are the ones you make yourself.

My unconventional journey through conferences hackathons and serendipitous connections not only got me to the US but opened doors I never knew existed. That single conference and hackathon victory changed my entire career trajectory proving that sometimes the best opportunities come wrapped in uncertainty.

Remember sometimes you just need to take that leap of faith even if you're planning your accommodation during a layover in Dubai! Life has a funny way of working out when you least expect it.

1i78rhc,https://i.redd.it/sc2gygxz2jee1.jpeg,New to the hobby ‚Äì thought I'd say Hi!,"I got into this almost by accident. I came across a used Lamy Studio (pictured), picked it up and immidiately felt wierdly comfortable with it in my hand. Didn't think about it too much and bought the pen for 15‚Ç¨ or so. I knew nothing about fountain pens, except that my mum used to have one when I was a kid and that pen was the most beautiful little thing. Nobody around me uses one. So, when I found out that my new pen didn't work very well, I put it on the account of my lack of practise (which it was ‚Äì for a part.) Anyway, I ended up not using the Lamy that much.

 I'm a student and I've always liked to take my notes by hand. Not only that, I spilled coffee on my laptop and I was not able to get a new one for a while, so a comfortable pen became more or less a necessity. I recalled I had the lamy tucked away somewhere, found it and started fiddling with it. After a while I realized that the black EF nib the pen had was just ever so slightly crooked ‚Äì just enough so that it wouldn't sit properly. Well, I got a new (F) nib, and not-so-miraculously the pen started to write like I've never experienced a pen to do. I got properly hooked. The already intuitive format of pen and paper just got even more intuitive, and my journaling and note-taking habits got even more enjoyable.

 At the moment I mainly use the Studio for journaling and such. I recently got the Safari (EF) for everyday notes and the Sport (F) which is pretty much the only pen available around here. I do like them both, but prefer  Safari: it fits my hand a bit better and the nib feels nicer. Sport is a handy pen still. That'll propably be my line up for quite some time, except for probably another safari or an Al Star, but eventually I'd like to get myself a ""nice"" pen. Maby when I graduate.

Unscientific anecdote: I have an IKEA cutting board and a big wooden spoon. Bought them over 7 years ago and use them almost daily. The spoon goes in the dishwasher and the cutting board gets a bit of a scrub with soap and hot water every time I use it. That's it. No oil. No sanding. No kid gloves. No care whatsoever other than what I've described.

And yet in this sub and other places I see time and again that you can only use Extra Virgin Type II Mega-Poly Organic Parti-Soluble Platypus Oil from New Guinea. You must apply 30 coats with a full moon between each coat then sand with only the finest grade of coconut husk wet/dry paper with you r left hand in semi-circular motions. Never make a full circle because that can introduce pathogen highways.

And you *will* die! Either from salmonella or embarrassment at your next dinner party.

So am I missing something here? Do I **need** to treat my wooden kitchen stuff or not? Obviously I don't. But am I really at risk for not doing so? The spoon gets lots of oil from when I use it, I suppose. And the worst thing about the cutting board is that you can't cut fruit on it because it sometimes tastes of onions. So I use a different one for that.

Am I?

1. over-thinking it
2. under-thinking it and will soon die. it's just taking a while.
3. missing out on the wonderful world of oily cutting board maintenance

lately, i‚Äôve been really worrying about what i want to do with my life, my career, and everything. i‚Äôve been staying up super late, eating junk food at night‚Äînot a ton, but still. i think i might‚Äôve binge-eaten just now, which i haven‚Äôt done in a while, especially since i‚Äôve been on my weight loss journey (i‚Äôve dropped 25 pounds). i‚Äôve been on a good track with my weight loss, like sometimes i‚Äôd go walking for 5 days straight and feel fine with that. but lately, i go walking for 1 day, then skip the next, or go walking for 2 days, skip the next, and then continue the next day. this cycle is unhealthy and putting me behind in my weight loss journey, and my mind just keeps telling me ""it's bad, very bad"" with how i've been lately. usually, i brush it off and tell myself it‚Äôs fine, things will be okay. i‚Äôm in college, working toward my business admin degree, graduating in 2026, and i just keep going like life‚Äôs okay. i do small activities throughout my day that bring me joy for a bit‚Äîwatching movies and shows with my bf and by myself, playing video games, posting on tiktok, doing my makeup, having my iced coffee‚Ä¶ things that keep me happy, even if just for a moment. my boyfriend and i have been long distance for almost 3 years now, and he‚Äôs moving 3 states away from me next month. God willing, it‚Äôll all be okay for him and his family; they‚Äôre moving separately from him. the last time i saw him was earlier this month for my bday, he usually drives 2 hours to see me every couple of months when he can. he plans to stay in the state he's moving to until he gets himself situated with a good job, and then God willing, we can get married and live together when we're ready and stable. i am living with my parents right now, focused on school and unemployed. i help them when i can. he's getting support from his friends that he'll be living with too. i am very happy for him, i hope you guys know that, but i‚Äôm just sad. i tell myself it‚Äôll just be like how we usually are. but then i get emotional at night before going to bed, especially if a sad song comes on as i scroll through tiktok lol. i start thinking a lot about everything, and sometimes i get into rumination, which is BAD. ever since i realized how bad rumination is, i‚Äôve been trying not to do it, but sometimes i still do, and i cry, telling myself it‚Äôs okay and then i go to sleep. i‚Äôve also been dealing with bad ocd lol. i wake up very late in the afternoons too, i sleep a lot. i‚Äôm not a morning person, and i tend to sleep even more to avoid having to do my daily walk. i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôm okay. i try to cry it out and get whatever‚Äôs on my chest out, but i‚Äôm just really worried. i don‚Äôt want life to pass me by, with everything going on with my boyfriend and not knowing what i‚Äôm gonna do with my life. it‚Äôs been weighing on me, not too much, but it‚Äôs there.",1,1737543856.0,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,0,1.0,False
1i78o3y,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1i78o3y/solo_trip_report_lviv_ukraine_2025/,"Solo trip report: Lviv, Ukraine 2025","Hello everyone! 
Just wanted to report how my trip to Lviv Ukraine went. I just crossed back into Poland a few hours ago. I hold both US and Polish passports. 

How I got there: I was already in Krakow where my family is from. I booked a one way ticket via the Ukrainian Railways app, it was very cheap. I used my apple wallet/digital ticket. I took a late train from Krakow to Przemysl and stayed the night at Hotel Europejski which is beautiful hotel. The train was scheduled at 0920.  You go to the train station and there is a specific platform (#5) where you go through Polish exit control. I waited in line for about 5 minutes, and exited Poland with my Polish passport. I then border the train and it left on time.

The train to Lviv: about 45 minutes into the journey a dog will make a few passes, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs trained for explosives or drugs, but I obviously wasn‚Äôt concerned. I have a very large dog in the USA who sheds a lot and as dog owners know, their hair will always travel with you. Both passes the dog stopped and smelled me and my bag for like 5-10 seconds which I thought was funny. Then a Ukrainian customs official checks everyone‚Äôs passports. I read online you need insurance. I bought it because it was like 6$. Nobody asked for it. I have the customs official my US passport, all they asked was ‚Äúfirst time visiting Ukraine?‚Äù And then stamped it. 

Lviv: I took a bolt to my hostel in Rynok square. What a beautiful city with beautiful people. Everything is functioning as normal, there are air raid shelters throughout the city but no alarms went off. There is a curfew at midnight. My credit card was used everywhere with tap to pay, I only used cash when leaving a 10% restaurant tip which I read was normal. There‚Äôs no adding a tip on the receipt like in the US. It‚Äôs a great city to just walk around and look at the beautiful buildings and churches. TONS of coffee in this city. 

Leaving Lviv: I read online that if you take the train back to Poland there will be a 2+ hour customs delay, so I didn‚Äôt want to do that. I left my hotel at 0845, and used Bolt to get to the Ukrainian border. It was about 90 minutes and 40$. When I got to the border a few taxi drivers wanted to drive me which would‚Äôve been a huge waste of time. There were massive queues for trucks and cars. I walked to the customs entrance, stamped out with my US passport in a few minutes. Guard spoke perfect English and was very friendly. You then walk about 5-10 minutes to the Polish entry point. Nobody in line, gave them my Polish passport and put my bag through a scanner and got scanned with a metal detector. Your now in Medyka Poland. I tried using Bolt but all cars were busy, so I used a taxi driver who took me to Przemysl station for 50 zloty. 
I‚Äôm now heading to Rzeszow to catch a flight to London which will be an hour on this train. 

Final thoughts: loved Lviv. No issue with language barrier, i learned a lot of basic Ukrainian phrases which was fun to use in person. In the touristy areas everyone would know English but was very happy when I used some basic Ukrainian. Hopefully this war will end soon, and air travel will open back up. I‚Äôd really love to head to the other major cities, since everyone told me Lviv is a lot more ‚ÄúEuropean‚Äù than the rest of Ukraine, so I‚Äôd like to see the difference.

# The Good

Let‚Äôs start on a positive note: college is honestly life-changing.

# The Bad

There are days when it feels like 24 hours just isn‚Äôt enough, and I‚Äôm running on nothing but caffeine and sheer willpower. Group projects? Don‚Äôt even get me started! It‚Äôs a mixed bag‚Äîsometimes great, but often a test of patience.

# The Sleep-Deprived

Late nights are a constant. Whether it‚Äôs cramming for exams, finishing assignments last minute (thanks, procrastination üôÉ), or just hanging out with friends, sleep often takes a back seat. It‚Äôs not healthy, I know, but I‚Äôve started to embrace the chaos.

# What Keeps Me Going

Despite the challenges, there‚Äôs something about working toward a degree and seeing progress that keeps me motivated.

I recently enrolled for 2nd semester, and it turned out na full load ako and wala nako time to work part time sa cafe, so I decided na mag resign, nag resign ako January 4 and ang reason ko is wala na talagang time. But until katapusan yung render ko, pumayag na lang ako since kaya ko pa naman mag render, and bawal yung immediate resign. 

Nag bigay ako ng TA ko sa cafe then my boss said ""noted"". 2 weeks have gone by, nag karon ng slight change sa schedule ko sa school, agad ko tong sinabi sa boss ko and sabi niya, parang wala na raw ako pinasok sa cafe (may other days pa akong pwede ipasok in a week) 

I said sorry several times, but sabi niya sa akin ""parang kasalanan ko pa na hindi ko naintindihan schedule mo"", she was referring to the TA I sent 2 weeks ago. 

Idk. Idk if kasalanan ko ba, dapat ba umabsent ako sa class ko nalang para makapag render pa ako or what. 

Wala kaming paper contract, verbal lang, and ayoko sana mag AWOL kasi I respect both my boss and the caf√© (since 2nd job ko ito). 

Ewan, di ko alam, gusto ko lang ishare. Any advices or comments is encouraged. ",1,1737542909.0,adultingph,4,0.67,False

I wanted to share a bit about my college journey because, honestly, it's been a whirlwind of experiences‚Äîsome amazing, others... not so much. üòÖ

# The Good Stuff üéâ

* **Independence:** Moving out and living on my own has been a game-changer. I‚Äôve learned how to manage my time (or at least try to üòÖ) and make decisions for myself.
* **New Friends:** College brought people into my life who feel like family now. Late-night study sessions, random coffee runs, and sharing struggles have been the highlight of my experience.
* **Interesting Classes:** When the course material clicks, it‚Äôs genuinely exciting. A couple of professors here have reignited my curiosity about topics I never thought I‚Äôd enjoy.

# The Struggles ü•¥

* **Workload:** Let‚Äôs be real‚Äîcollege can be overwhelming. Between assignments, exams, and trying to maintain a social life, it‚Äôs a lot.
* **Finances:** Juggling tuition, rent, and daily expenses has been tough. I‚Äôm constantly looking for ways to save money.
* **Mental Health:** Balancing everything has taken a toll sometimes, but I‚Äôve learned to prioritize self-care and reach out for support when I need it.

# A Hack That Helped Me üöÄ

This might sound random, but discovering essay writing services was a lifesaver. When I felt buried under deadlines, I turned to services like SpeedyPaper. They helped me with edits and structure, which gave me time to focus on other priorities.

# Final Thoughts üí≠

College isn‚Äôt just about academics; it‚Äôs about growth, resilience, and finding your path. It‚Äôs tough, but the journey shapes you in ways you don‚Äôt realize until you look back. To anyone out there struggling: you‚Äôre not alone. Hang in there‚Äîit‚Äôs worth it. üí™",2,1737542542.0,ScholarScript,2,1.0,False

I mixed it with warm coffee, then popped it in the freezer for a few hours (I read that this can help break down the cell walls) then took it out and left it on the kitchen counter overnight. About 12 hours later I gave it a stir and it was still green all the way through.

I figured that because the henna was such a low amount, that's why I wasn't seeing a change, and went ahead and applied it. When I wiped up my sink my washcloth definitely started turning yellow, so something happened?

I'm thinking to wait a full 6 hours before washing my head, just in case the color needed a bit more time to develop.

But just wondering if not getting the brown/rust color is normal if using just a small amount of henna.

The Kendu community has prevailed.

There is no shortage of quiet days in crypto. Drama, scandals and anything else happening everywhere and anywhere at all times.

Kendu has just endured quite possibly the most difficult test of all.

For months we have been battling, working relentlessly and trying to push it to the masses. Admittedly though, There has been a hindrance. The dev was actively working to push the movement into the ground, often going against community desires and deliberately sabotaging efforts.

What was not realised though by the dev is the strength of the movement, the bonds forged and the people who have utmost conviction in Kendu.

Through a massive effort and overhaul from the community we have successfully completed a community takeover and now look forward in to the future.

This is a clean slate, a fresh start.

We look forward with an adaptable, transparent and decentralised approach.

We build now a picture of Kendu that is loved and adored, not represented by any singular person.

We successfully had the dev send back their remaining tokens in to our donations wallet, meaning they are out. These tokens can be used from anything between listings to spreading the name now, by the community.

We just weathered the most difficult storm that could have been thrown at us, and we are more alive than ever. We all stood to the the biggest test and completed it with solidarity. The TG has seen hundreds of old faces come back who left due to their unhappiness with the dev.

This is a community with the likes of several IRL products such as energy drinks and coffee, members with tattoos repping the movement, people who push the name in every which way possible.

A community who is the 2nd existing memecoin ever to complete a certik audit organically, the 2nd memecoin to have a stocktwits page and one that has been featured on T1 CEX campaigns and advertisements.

A community with one of the healthiest distributions in DeFi, an establishment like no other and a SOL wormhole.

\-------

What has been shown here is that the Kendu movement is unstoppable. A genuine brand, movement and a once in a cycle opportunity.

We now look forward with the lessons of the past, building a welcoming community. We invite everyone to jump on board now. There is absolutely nothing holding us back any longer

This is how people are responding to the news.

20E clips of past whales who had left but never forgotten. 

Since this aswell, Kendu did a 300% jump in only 24 hours now with a cooldown at 25M MC.

People have been waiting on the sidelines, along with KOLs and influencers alike who had always cherished the Kendu community. They are all coming back. Several of these KOLs have began bullposting again because of how much they adored this community.

It is now the community who remains. Stronger then ever, consolidated and with nothing to stop us from sending this to the billions.

The community has always been the alpha. We ran it up to 280M mc in 2024, and now with 17000 holders we are ready to push it in the billions in 2025.

Took a full course of prednisone for a few months, but never got to remission. Symptoms improved a lot but stool tests And sigmoidoscopy still showed mild inflammation. Dr thought if the symptoms weren‚Äôt bothering me I can carry on just taking mesalamine. I did this for a while until I was having more urgency and saw blood early December. 

I took 75mg of azathioprine from the 2nd of December until the 24th. I stopped it when I got very ill with the flu. I had a fever for 5 days straight and a bad cough. I never restarted the aza because it made me so low energy I didn‚Äôt feel functional. They suggested mercaptopurine over email but I wanted to discuss it with a dr before starting it. I returned a stool calprotectin test last week to have that update before the appointment and it came back normal. I‚Äôd gotten so used to my symptoms I wasn‚Äôt really thinking about it but realised I don‚Äôt need the toilet as soon as I wake up anymore and go about 2 times on average, maybe 3 if I have 2 coffees. 

I‚Äôm a bit in shock because my last normal still test was in feb 2023. I didn‚Äôt expect 3 weeks of aza could put me in remission as I thought it took months to do anything. Is it possible getting the flu made my immune system stop attacking my gut and focus on healing the virus instead? I can‚Äôt make sense of it but I am grateful. I‚Äôm still going to be cautious with what I eat and do stool tests the next few months to keep an eye on things. Anyone experienced similar? Or any tips to help the remission stay?

1i7862u,https://www.reddit.com/r/KimPossible/comments/1i7862u/it_just_occurred_to_me_that_the_possibles_were/,It just occurred to me that the Possibles were filthy rich,"I'm kind of a socio-economics nerd, so bear with me on this. It just occurred to me how rich the Possibles really are. Outside of the Disney Princes and Princesses, literal royalty, the Possible family is the wealthiest family unit in the entire Disney canon (this is excluding the one single individual who is so obcenely wealthy that his name is part of the tax code of the Netherlands, and his signature underwrote Disney Parks currency - >!Scrooge McDuck!<)

Here's what I'm taking about :

* Their jobs and education : Dr. Possible is a neurosurgeon, and Dr. Mr. Possible is a rocket scientist. It's a joke based on ""rocket surgery"", but getting to that point is not cheap. Getting a bachelors in mechanical engineering is a $40K+ investment. NASA pays roughly $140K pr year for their engineers, and those spots are highly competitive. At one point Ron addresses the couple as ""Doctor's P"", so it's possible Mr. P has an actual doctorate degree. But the real bread winner is Anne. As a neurosurgeon, she raking in at least $400K a year. Together, with just their salaries and not factoring in investments or anything, they're hitting $600K in joint income.
* the old car : In 2007's S4E2, Car Alarm, Mr. P gives Kim his old car. But the thing is, he had it running... ish. On looks, with those bomber fenders, it's like a 1954 Dodge. But to have the money for parts for this vehicle, and to keep it running, that's super expensive. Most people getting into classic cars are retirees with extra money and investments. It's Hot Wheels for guys with fat pensions.
* the new car : In the same episode we see the inside of the garage. There's the old car, but parked right next to it, and visible for only a few seconds, is the new car. Only one manufacturer sports that distinct circular grill. It's a genuine Bugatti. Only a few limited runs of Rolls Royce models like the Black Rose are more expensive than the Bugatti, and those few are normally bought by billionaires like the British royal family and the royal family of Saud. Just with the overall look, the car's a 2005 Bugatti Veyron with a custom gold paint job. That's the car Lana Del Ray was singing about, and they're not something you can get off the lot. Bugatti takes pre-orders, only a small amount are produced to fit the order bill. They're $1,200,000 bare minimum.  For comparison, you can buy a used Cessna airplane for $120K. His car costs 10 airplanes.
* The house : They live in a mansion mounted into the side of a mountain. That should speak for itself, but look at the architecture. It's obviously Frank Lloyd Wright's water fall house, which is a registered national landmark, but it's got aspect's of 1960s googie architecture. The actual Fallingwater House sold for like $6M. Even the furniture in the house is all either mid-century modern, or an art deco subset known as waterfall. Their living room coffee table is probably based of the Noguchi table, which is like $2k. So either they shelled out thousands for custom peices, or more for actual antiques, or those are antiques they inherited. By comparison, Bonnie and Wade live in split level California ranch homes, which were like $175K in nicer areas in 2007.

So that's the post. The Possibles are rich off their butts, and they can afford three kids who all do sports. As an adult who will never retire, it sickens me. 

If Shego wanted money, she didn't have to knock off that bank. She could have just snatched a couple of lamps out of Kim's place and retired. 

And Kim was super detattached for nagging Ron for using coupons.",14,1737541694.0,KimPossible,2,0.94,False

For the past few days, my Nespresso Pro Zenius coffee machine has stopped dispensing coffee properly. It seems like the coffee is falling directly into the used capsule container and pooling at the bottom, instead of coming out of the spout.

Has anyone experienced this issue or knows what might be causing it? Any advice on how to fix it would be greatly appreciated.

I have this girl (lets call her N) in class who seemes to enjoy making my life hard. I don't know what I did but it's implied I did something and now she's taking revenge. Idk man. 

The other day I wore a t shirt with a zip hoodie over. I accidentally pored coffee over my tshirt so I took it off and wore only the zip hoodie. 

So N, when i wasn't paying attention, unzipped my hoodie and tugged on it and then walked off; leaving my hoodie open, hanging from my arms. 

It's worth mentioning I'm not on hrt and dont have boobs. But it still felt embarrassing and also very dysphric. 

My friends say it's not a big deal. The chest isn't a nono place on guys, only girls; that seems to be consensus. And since I don't have boobs, hence nothing to hide, it wasn't that big of a deal.

I told the authorities at school but they didn't see me as a victim. They see that me and N are fighting and just want us to stop.

But idk if I was actually assaulted. Or if I'm appropriating from women who've actually been assaulted... ",11,1737541411.0,trans,4,0.92,False

Not going to make this too long, so it'll be short and simple here. If you remember a month ago where I made a post briefly explaining Kendu Gum, Kendu Gum started taking preorders. Well now the wait is over. All orders have been shipped. The reason why I did this is so that I wanted for us chads to chew something that lasts for hours as we are smashing posts and sharing Kendu.

# What is Kendu Gum again?

Kendu Gum is an all-natural mastic gum dervied from the mastiha tree from Chios, Greece. It lasts for several hours and you can chew it multiple times whilst retaining flavour and texture. It also has a lot of health benefits that can help your gut and provide antioxidants to your body. **It tastes like tree bark but don't worry chad, you'll get used to it.**

# What's the update?

Basically, we've moved from pre-order to **sending Kendu Gum the same day as you placed an order**. Also great timing, old dev is out so we now can really thrive as a community and as an ecosystem.

If you are interested to chew something whilst shilling Kendu on X, Reddit or whatever, Kendu Gum has got you. Be sure to also check out other products that our chads and chadettes have made, Kendu Energy, Kendu Merch, Kendu Coffee, Kendu Jewellery, etc and support them. We have made Kendu into a real ecosystem, where you can have a lifestyle of Kendu products.

Be sure to check it out.

Just FYI, I don't drink or smoke.  I'm also a bit shy, so just a heads-up.  Hope that's not a problem.  It's just part of who I am. Looking forward to meeting/seeing everyone!

It helps hyperactivity but not attention. I can sit at one place finally without getting up, but have still been still procrastinating. I was drinking 3 coffees a day and have tapered down to 1 coffee ever since starting Methylphenidate. Surprisingly i don‚Äôt have any of the side effects of methylphenidate - i‚Äôm sleeping more than i did before, appetite is good, i did lose 2 pounds in 1 week which came out of nowhere. I do have more frequent bowel movements (weirdly). Heart palpitations and high blood pressure first 4 days but not noticeable now. 


My theory- 

1. ritalin isn‚Äôt for me, but the problem is i‚Äôm from india and we have limited options for stimulants. afaik methylphenidate is the only approved one 

2. coffee withdrawal is giving me anxiety depression. i should cut coffee entirely and anxiety would subside
