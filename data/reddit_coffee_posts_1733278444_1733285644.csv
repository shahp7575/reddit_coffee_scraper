1h675f1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h675f1,"Slow Koi, The Strand Arcade, Queen St","Checked out this new specialty coffee and matcha spot in what seems to be on the up again, Strand Arcade just down from Mid City today.

What ordered:

 -  Centre Coffee (Kenya) house pour. Pour Over
 
- Eternal Coffee (Panama), roasted in NZ. Khyber Pass to be specific. Pour over

- Omi Ruby

- H≈çjicha

- Shirikawa Asahi Matcha. Ceremonial Grade. Kettl from Japan

- Yuju Mori

I came mainly to see how good the pour over was but noticed they had some exceptional matcha from Kettl in Japan on offer. Ive only had it once before. At $39 a pop it's not for the faint hearted. Was it worth it?! Absolutely. I generally stare well clear of matcha locally cos the quality is so terrible or its drowned in milk. Im fortunate to have a Japanese auntie who travels to Japan a lot. Matcha is very serious business in her household. Its a ceremony. To have this standard that is handled with care and respect available locally is a real treat. Most definitely not an every day thing. For the Matcha obsessives amongst us you must try this at least once. There are other matcha options which wont hurt your wallet.

The barista made me the eternal coffee pour over on the house after we had a pretty in depth conversation about coffee from different regions and altitudes . This came from their private staff stash. I was thankful  as we share a mutual love of Eternal Coffee, a local roastery run out of a yum cha restaurant!!

The Ume iced tea was a definite must order when you visit. Perfect sunny day slammer!

The H≈çjicha was the perfect ascent into the Matcha

The Yuju Mori was my least favourite.. the mixture of yuzu and rosemary with coffee was peculiar. As it steeped longer with the rosemary it became more tolerable

Overall i really enjoyed the experience and service. The decor is a little strange as they skimped on somethings which would have really taken the spot to a new level. In particular the seating. Definitely worth a visit. You can also peruse the small art galleries that have set up in the arcade

It makes life so much easier, and I‚Äôm way more productive with the

When I‚Äôm gaming, though, it‚Äôs all about the visuals. Playing *Mario Kart 8* on my Switch looks so much better on a high-res screen‚Äîcolors pop and the action feels smoother. It really does make a difference in my experience.

Portability is also a huge factor for me. Whether I‚Äôm working at the coffee shop or bringing my setup to a friend‚Äôs house for gaming, I need something that‚Äôs easy to carry around. I‚Äôve found that a lot of portable monitors are lightweight and built for that kind of convenience, which I really appreciate.

As for connectivity, that‚Äôs something I‚Äôve learned the hard way. It‚Äôs such a headache when a monitor doesn‚Äôt connect properly, so I always go for ones that support USB-C or HDMI. Those connections tend to be reliable and save me a lot of frustration.

Lastly, if I‚Äôm gaming or doing any kind of creative work, I need good color accuracy. It‚Äôs a game-changer (literally) when the colors are vibrant and clear, instead of washed-out or dim. I also pay attention to brightness and contrast, because I‚Äôve noticed that it can make a big difference depending on where I‚Äôm using the monitor.

- focuses on several interests and knick-knacks and photos that make it evident she likes animals, likes her workspace to feel personal, and has interests, but pointed sound effects and narrative tone makes it clear that we are supposed to for some reason think this is lame and judge her about it because who wants a personality?
- despite having clocked several different specific indications of her interests on which to  base decisions about a thoughtful gift for this woman, Sephora steps in and says ‚Äúdon‚Äôt overthink it. Give something beautiful.‚Äù

1h66o28,https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1h66o28/some_criticism/,Some Criticism ,"Hello everyone! I am another average 90s kid with a nerdy obsession for pocket monsters since Red and Blue came out eons ago, a simpler time, when cable television was a thing,kids played in playgrounds, did math on paper and everyone though for sure the world was ending in the year 2000.

So I'm prefesing this because I want you to know I'm not your Cheetos finger rant goblin and am just trowing shade at a franchise I absolutely love, but rather want to voice my thoughts on areas the game needs to improve drastically , hopefully you guys have imput as well, and just like the old days when link cable trading was a thing on your pimped out gameboy with your friends after school,  I'm hoping we can unite and discuss different point of views on some issues bullet pointed below

‚Ä¢ FLAIRS ARE EXTREMELY UNDERWHELMING 
for a game as big as Pok√©mon THE pokemon , the flairs should at least be active for more than just .5 seconds I never even notice them and the whole thing just feels lazy, I'd suggest instead of a bogus .5 second animation, how about keeping the animation live while the card is on the field to shove in your opponents face you pulled 35 pigeys 
At least gives us an option to craft more than 1 at a time , who the hell has time in 2025 to sit there and click buttons more than once?? When there are literally robots trying to hug you for sale on the tesla website right now ? I mean wth ! Revamp this system and give it more convenience

‚Ä¢A DUSTING SYSTEM SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED 
like cmon , every single mobile tcg has a crafting system that allows you to use dupes as currency,  now before you guys all pull out your keyboard sabers , I know maybe it will be a thing in the future, but...is it really??


‚Ä¢WHATS UP WITH THESE RANDOM ASS CARDS FOR EVENTS?
They gave jigglypuff some love, they gave haunter a pat upside it's head and said ""here ya go kid', at least it's something,  but they couldn't give VENASAUR the EVENT CARD  a different attack?? It's like the boss walked in on the team half finished on a Friday and said "" whatever we don't finish today,  we don't finish stacy! "" and just slapped the same bad attack on a bad card that no one uses , it's a bit infuriating you would waste such good art on a card that's going to collect dust until this games inevitable ""notice of service shutdown""  every mobile game is cursed with . They could have given venasaur a 3 cost attack that did a little less damage , maybe healed the bench , maybe poisoned , maybe ramped literally any reason to play it over the EX which already gets about as much love as an alcoholic dad gives his 18 year son who decided he wants to major in philosophy , the Onix attack already sucked , why does mankey get love but not onix? And Greninja!! Well..Greninja is fine we all like him.
Why the laziness ? Is my question,  if we on the topic of  philosophy. 

‚Ä¢DECK BUILDER SUCKS
it sucks!ü§∑

‚Ä¢GIVE US SOME EMOTES!
and some ways to react to what opponents do and cards they play, right now my IRL opponent feels disconnected to me and I can't even spam ""nice!"" When they play poke ball with no basics left in the deck. Again, don't raise your keyboard sabers at me yet, I do have a feeling Stacy will eventually get to this one if her jerk boss just let's her finish her work and stops asking her if she wants to go out for coffee .

‚Ä¢MORE MODES
this one I'm sure is coming,right now we are all trying to see how shitty of a deck we can build just to keep entertained on casual mode while we try to make Dragonite good , personally I'm rushing to the internet  every morning to see what new ""meta decks"" my favorite YouTubers are shoving down our throat. 

‚Ä¢SEND ME A HEART, FOR ABSOLUTELY NO REASON!
I petition that hearts given to us by our fellow opponents after battles turn into some type of currency, to possibly buy sleeves, deck boxes(God knows those are great rn) or something. 
Maybe as a badge of honor of how you've shown great sportsmanship by NOT spamming ""NICE!""
Getting to go to my inbox to receive nothing at all, is amazing I must say. 


These are all my complaints , I hope everyone can emphasize or disagree ,even add critisim its ok. I think it's important we dont allow ourselves to let mediocrity stain a game we all love and enjoy while they fill their pockets with our hard earn sheckles. ",0,1733283109.0,PTCGP,1,0.33,False

1h66mf9,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1h66mf9/its_very_evident_which_redditors_have_been/,It's very evident which Redditors have been exposed to/regularly observe the homelessness crisis and which have not based on the way they discuss the topic.,"This post is about the homelessness crisis in the United States, but I ran out of characters in the title to specify.

Debates about the homelessness crisis in the U.S. on this site are somewhat common, and everyone has their own theory on how it should best be handled and mitigated. That said, whenever I read these conversations it becomes quite evident to me which people have actual experience dealing with and observing the growing homelessness problem, and which do not. 

Before you screech at me, yes, I am making *somewhat* of a leap in logic here, but my opinion is informed by discussions I've read and participated in where people sometimes admit to their level of exposure to the homeless population, mixed in with my inferences about people's ages and where they live based on their proposed solutions. This is a platform for opinions, after all. You're free to disagree with my analysis and I'm sure many of you will.

I'll also say that I live in what's probably the worst part of a major American city and witness the growing homelessness problem every day. It's not about judging them or viewing them as less than, I've had family members struggle with and die from addiction and mental health problems before, and I've struggled with addiction myself, so I get it and I know it's more complicated than some people think.

That said, when debates about the topic come up, I can typically discern with great confidence which people actually know what they're talking about and which do not after reading a single sentence of their argument. There seems to be a huge population of people who have rose-colored glasses on at all times regarding this issue. It frustrates me greatly to read so-called solutions like ""why don't we just give them money?"" and ""we should just give them a house."" This is usually followed by some assumption that if we just fill their hands, they're going to get their act together and start filling out job applications.

I can respect the optimism in this stance, but there is a certain level of ignorance to the topic that it requires to take seriously. Like I mentioned earlier, I encounter this issue nearly every day and if I brought this population of Redditors with me to go grocery shopping or grab a coffee down the street, they'd be stunned.

Just yesterday I went grocery shopping in the middle of the day and before I even parked my car in the parking lot I had a homeless woman repeatedly try to open the driver's side door to my car. When I didn't open it, she went around to the other side and started punching the passenger side window so hard I thought it was going to shatter the glass. I had to go back to my apartment without purchasing anything because I didn't feel safe getting out of the car. She was shouting something unintelligible at me the entire time. 

Last month I went to get coffee two blocks away from my apartment and there was a homeless man smoking meth on the sidewalk in front of my building. I never got within ten feet of him (just due to the direction I was walking) and he spotted me at the same time he had misplaced something. He decided that he thought I stole whatever it was he was looking for and quite literally began to run after me down the street. He caught up to me and spit on me while shouting something unintelligible, before finding whatever it was he thought I stole and thankfully left me alone. These are just two examples of the endless stories I could tell, but this is already getting long.

I tell these stories not because I want to generate pity for myself or villainize the homeless population, because like I said, I understand they're in the throes of drug addiction and I've struggled with that myself. I don't even necessarily blame them because I know they're mentally so far removed from their bodies that it would be unfair to. 

However, being regularly exposed to this kind of behavior makes me roll my eyes when Redditors act like these people are one shower and hot meal away from working an office job. I'm not exaggerating or being unnecessarily cruel by saying that many of them have either temporarily or permanently lost the ability to verbally communicate. I take no joy in saying it, but if we gave most of these people unlimited money they would quite literally run every last cent of it to their dealer and we'd be back to square one, or more like square zero since their addiction would have been enabled even further by society. Even if we gave them each a free house, I genuinely believe a large portion of the population would be unable to keep track of a house key or remember their address. I‚Äôm not trying to be mean, I just don‚Äôt think people who don‚Äôt witness this up close actually understand how dire the situation is for these people.

Whether that's related to addiction or mental health problems is besides the fact, because the point is that we can't have an honest conversation about this issue while so many people think the average homeless person you see on the street is just someone who missed a rent payment or got laid off. While those situations certainly do happen and I have empathy for that as well, those are the people you're more likely to find in shelters because they don't have a problem with the no-drugs barrier that homeless shelters tend to have. In fact, WSJ reported last year that over 50% of the homeless population of San Francisco declined state resources because they could not use drugs in shelters.

In short- being able to have such simplistic ""why don't we just give them X"" view on homelessness is a luxury belief that tells me you have not had much, or any, legitimate exposure to the homelessness crisis, and most of the time that I'm able to prove myself right on this assumption, I do.

Lastly, I do understand I'm making a generalization here and this is just my opinion. I'm not trying to have a hostile discussion about this whatsoever, I'm just trying to be real about it. I also understand that some people who *are* regularly exposed to the homelessness crisis are not going to have the same opinion as me, so please don't think you're being exceptionally profound by saying *""well I actually DO see homelessness often and I STILL think we should give them XYZ!""* Like I said, I get that you may have a different solution than me, but this post isn't about solutions. I‚Äôm not even discussing what my proposed solutions are because that‚Äôs not the point of this discussion. It's about how we debate the issue and how the average American perceives it.",11,1733282971.0,TrueUnpopularOpinion,4,0.92,False

Is Follow meant to be this potent? Nothing I'd read about it indicated it would smell this offensive and I can't help but wonder if whoever packaged the sample might've gotten the names mixed up. ",0,1733282408.0,fragrance,3,0.5,False

I've been on quite a journey trying to find the perfect mattress in our concrete jungle, and I thought I'd share my experience to help others who might be in the same boat.

After months of tossing and turning on my old, lumpy mattress, I finally decided it was time for an upgrade. Like many New Yorkers, I started my search at the traditional brick-and-mortar stores in Manhattan. You know, the usual suspects - those big-name retailers with flashy showrooms and aggressive salespeople.

Let me tell you, shopping for a mattress in person can be overwhelming. Between the countless options, confusing pricing, and the pressure to make a decision while a salesperson hovers over you, it's not exactly a relaxing experience. Plus, the prices in these stores are often inflated to cover their high NYC rent costs.

What really changed the game for me was discovering online mattress shopping. I know what you're thinking - ""How can I buy a mattress without trying it first?"" That's exactly what I thought too. But here's the thing: most online mattress companies offer amazing trial periods (usually 100 nights or more) and free returns. That's way better than the awkward 5-minute test lay-down you do in stores!

I spent hours researching and comparing different options online. The best part? I could do it from my tiny apartment while enjoying my morning coffee. No subway rides, no salespeople, and definitely no hauling a mattress through the streets of New York.

After careful consideration, I found an incredible selection of mattresses here: https://athometouch.com/mattress

The prices are significantly better than what you'll find in Manhattan stores, and they deliver right to your door. Most importantly, you're not paying the ""NYC markup"" that local stores often add.

Some quick tips I learned during my search:
- Memory foam mattresses are great for couples because they minimize motion transfer
- If you're a hot sleeper, look for mattresses with cooling technology
- Side sleepers typically need softer mattresses than back sleepers
- Hybrid mattresses offer a good balance of support and comfort
- Always check the warranty and return policy

Another huge advantage of buying online is the convenience of delivery. Have you ever tried moving a mattress up a 5th-floor walkup? Not fun. Most online retailers offer free delivery and will even set up your new mattress and remove your old one.

Living in New York taught me that sometimes the best deals aren't found in physical stores. The mattress industry is changing, and online shopping has become a smart alternative for us city dwellers who value convenience and fair prices.

Remember, a good mattress is an investment in your health and well-being. We New Yorkers already deal with enough stress - we shouldn't have to worry about where we sleep too!

Hope this helps anyone in the city who's on the hunt for a new mattress. Sweet dreams, fellow New Yorkers! üóΩ

P.S. Don't forget to check out reviews and compare prices before making your final decision. Your back (and wallet) will thank you later!",1,1733282332.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

I just got promoted to manager, at a brand new bakery/coffee shop. It‚Äôs less than a month old. I hate to say this, because I love the owners, but I feel they really dropped the ball already. For almost this first three weeks we would sell out of bakery items by 11:00, when we were supposed to be open till 6:00. They weren‚Äôt properly doing inventory so things like not having mocha for a whole day happened. Today we had no white chocolate sauce. Other things as well that were poorly done. Customers have been annoyed and I know we‚Äôve lost customers due to the first few weeks.

The thing is our products are amazing! Our specialty is sourdough bread. We use a special flour imported from Italy that is better for gut health. We don‚Äôt use dyes. Majority of what we sell is organic. We have other amazing bakery items like scones, donuts, cookies, muffins, white bread, and occasionally croissants and dinner rolls. I‚Äôve trued almost all bakery items and as someone who is a baker myself, their stuff is actually incredible! We roast our own coffee beans and it‚Äôs really good coffee as well. 

We really have potential, but due to so much inconvenience the first few weeks business has been extremely slow this last week. We‚Äôve fixed a lot of the issues already, but the customers don‚Äôt know that.

So how do I get our super tiny town excited again? What have you guys done that has gotten your customers to keep coming! How do I reach new ones? What has worked for you?

For context I am always putting 17G.

I recently bought the breville barista pro and bought beans from a local coffee roaster in bulk. 

I recently noticed though that all of a sudden all my double shot expressos are very fast, as in 45g in 10 seconds fast. 

This wasn't like this before, it wasn't perfectly dialed in yet but very close, then all of a sudden all my expresso shots were flowing very fast the next morning.

I played around with the internal burr all the way down to 1 with external to 4 then 1 (max finest you can do) same results.

No idea how overnight this can change, I bought different beans that were cheaper with the same settings 1 internal and 4 external then 1, not matter what I do it's all fast. 

I even tried the expresso and it was very bitter yet it flowed so quickly.

There was only 1 coffee bean I bought that kinda worked with internal burr 4 and external 5, but it bothers me that the original coffee beans I bought no longer wants to flow slowly including the cheap one I bought 

Any ideas? 

Much appreciated

1h66c62,https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/1h66c62/reading_resources_paid_resources_long_post/,Reading Resources (paid resources) (long post),"I thought I would share some of my reading resources based on some comments/replies recently as well as this really good post on reading: [https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/1h55gyc/learning\_japanese\_with\_through\_reading\_an/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/1h55gyc/learning_japanese_with_through_reading_an/)

**Preface:**  (1) Reading comprehension has been one of the things I've focused on since beginning my Japanese learning journey. So I started from N5-N4.

(2) These are paid resources. I initially tried the free resources (as linked in the above Reddit post) but I found that I couldn't quite get through them. *I prioritise my experience of the reading - so the content has to be something I find an enjoyable read, and the ease of accessing them and ease of readin*g, was something I was looking for - hence, I opted for paid resources in the end.

**When I first started (N5-N3):**

I used materials from [*www.thejapanshop.com*](http://www.thejapanshop.com). I found that the materials were enjoyable and format wise is great for beginners cause they have side by side Eng translations as well as the story in full Japanese. The creators essentially have translated Japanese ""fairytales"" (the equivalent) - so you are reading myths/stories that natives probably read/know of. They cover alot of other cultural material. I also find that the prices are relatively affordable.

**At about N3 level:**

I started with manga (in order of difficulty - easy to hard) -

\- *Koi wa Ameagari no You ni (After the Rain)*: About a high school girl who works part-time and kinda likes her store manager. Mostly about how she gave up running because of an injury, and throughout the story, how she finds the confidence to run again. Leisurely read and simple language used.

\- *My Dress-Up Darling:* High school setting - shy boy meets popular girl, makes cosplay clothes for her. Everyday life type of a story. Slightly more difficult words used compared to the above, there are some pages where it's very technical on clothing / making clothes - but limited. Towards the later issues, felt like the words got slightly harder.

\- *March Comes in like a Lion* \- shy boy who plays shogi. About his development and confidence in himself, thanks to another family he becomes close with. Quite abit of difficult words - stopped after the first issue.

\- *Moriaty the Patriot* \- detective based on Sherlock setting, but of course it's more about Moriaty. Quite abit of difficult words - stopped after the second issue.

**TIPS ON CHOOSING MANGA**: If you're already watching anime, you can tell whether the manga will be difficult or not. For example, if it gets very technical with magic / sci-fi related words, there might be alot of words that may be difficult to ease in. It is better to start with the everyday-life type of series.  Violet Evergarden is for example another one which I've watched the anime (and movie), and I know would be simple enough to read. Death Note is great to watch, but likely too philosophical. Jujutsu Kaisen and Demon Slayer are also great to watch, but probably too many fantasy/magic related words.

**OTHERS:** I also started subscribing to *Hiragana Times* \- it's a monthly magazine (bi-lingual). Articles are related to all things Japan and Japanese culture - cannot recommend enough for its interesting content. Ngl, it is difficult - probably closer to upper N2-N1, but at N3 level you can still read it and then read the translation, just to get used to reading long passages. Now that I'm N2 level, I can definitely understand more.

**At about N3-N2 level:**

Eventually I found that for reading comprehension and speed purposes, books are better compared to manga, because you are not filling in the gaps with pictures. And you're reading alot longer passages. I'm also a book reader, so I am biased.

These are the books I am currently reading/read:

*The Full Moon Coffee Shop - Ê∫ÄÊúàÁèàÁê≤Â∫ó„ÅÆÊòüË©† by Mai Mochizuki* \- Dialogue driven. Leisurely read. Some adults facing problems in their life go to a cafe served by cats who tell them their astrology. If you love cats and astrology, great one. If you don't like astrology, abit of a miss cause alot of time is spent on the astrology. Lol (I have found this rec on an instragram account:¬†[https://www.instagram.com/chroniqled/?hl=en](https://www.instagram.com/chroniqled/?hl=en)¬†who reads alot of Japanese books (in english). I would probably use her list to find new books).

*„Ç¢„É™„ÇπÊÆ∫„Åó - by Â∞èÊûó Ê≥∞‰∏â (Yasumi Kobayashi)* \- mystery / crime based on Alice in Wonderland. Dialogue driven. Loved this. Fun, engaging, due to the nature of the characters, there is a lot of repetition in the conversation style but it's good for learning purposes. There are 4 other titles in the series - so will keep you occupied for awhile if you like the style.

*Áú†„Çä„ÇíÊÆ∫„Åó„ÅüÂ∞ëÂ•≥ - by Ëµ§Â∑ùÊ¨°ÈÉé (Jiro Akagawa)* \- mystery / crime. Dialogue driven. Quite liked it. A sensei is found dead, who-is-the-culprit type story. Told from the perspective of a high school girl.

*Haruki Murakami's 'Colourless'* \- I've read the English version so I know it's one of the relatively easier works from the author. Quite abit of dialogue, but also quite abit of descriptive writing. Still in the midst of reading, harder than the above. About a guy who had a group of friends and became estranged suddenly (they ostracised him), and is now revisiting that chapter in his life. (still reading)

*Osamu Dazai's 'No Longer Human'* \- Similar to Murakami's 'Colourless' - abit of descriptive writing, less dialogue. Perhaps same difficulty as 'Colourless'. (still reading)

// I tend to reach for the easier books because it's less taxing on the brain so the more difficult books I'm progressing much slower.

**TIPS ON CHOOSING BOOKS/BUNKOBONS**: I browse Amazon Kindle JP read the summary first, then the sample provided. Summaries are usually more difficult than the content of the book itself, the sample is usually more instructive. My gauge is: Understanding 50% of the summary and 80% of the sample at first read.

Many people recommend visual or light novels (?), which I think are more or less the same it is still long passages, just with a visual or two inserted every few pages (?) (I've never read). So as long as you find a genre that you like, it works the same as books.

**HOW I READ**: I will choose a book where I can read with relative ease - ie. native speed, save for unknown words - which is about 20%. So for example, in one sentence, one or two Kanji which I don't know to look up the meaning. I do this on the go. For any words I like/want to add to my vocab, I add it to my Anki. Sticking to the same genre (or author) is also good because chances are, you will encounter the same words over which helps recall and recognition.

By the time I started with books, I would say that my reading comprehension was quite high (save for unknown words) because I started reading early on (with easier content). For me personally, I do not treat these reading sessions as ""studying"" perse, I do it because I enjoy it. For that reason, I want to be able to read the content without feeling stuck so much to the point that I can't enjoy the content anymore. For me, that is about the 80% comprehension (without having to look things up). I double check my comprehension if needed with Google Translate OCR function.

I use Kindle and purchase the books (and manga previously) from Kindle Amazon JP (note: for Amazon accounts it is tied to the country, not global access).

**MY GENERAL EXPERIENCE:** I have found that it is important to simply enjoy the content which you are consuming. It will make it that much easier to be consistent in your practice/immersion and it is directly related to the goals of learning Japanese - ie. interacting with the language. And you can make it a daily habit - eg. just 10 to 15 minutes of reading. It may be abit of a challenge to find that content which you enjoy, but once you have it down, it will make life so much easier moving on.

If you're just starting out with reading, YOUR BRAIN WILL TIRE. It is normal. I will stop when my brain gets tired - so let's say 10 or 15 minutes. Then I will just continue another day. Currently I can read up to an hour before my brain gets tired, for the difficult books - 30 minutes.

This process has been really rewarding to me personally. And I hope it will be for you too.

Card 2 is Chase Sapphire Reserve with a balance of 5200. I'm getting $92 interest charged this month. It says if i pay 219 for 3 years I'll end up paying an extra 7k. Side note: I cant believe i got this card. This was a terrible mistake. 

I bring in around 3400 a month. I spend 2300 on rent (1550), utilities (250ish) healthcare (320, but getting cheaper insurance in 2025) gym (180) and apple music (12). These are mostly fixed expenses besides con ed which fluctuates a bit. 

I had a huge wake up call and realized i need to fix this soon. But just to be transparent. Last month was $290 on groceries (whole foods and trader joes), $250 on eating out, $220 on going out/dates (broadway ticket, dinner, drinks), $200 on coffee (fuckin yikes). And $600 for misc (got a new phone and a case, skincare, amazon/household goods. Obviously this was a huge splurge and I dont regularly spend this). I am buckling down on eating out and coffee and obviously the misc stuff. I luckily had no transportation expenses this month cuz i have a bike and live in a very central area of nyc. 

I have 82k points that i was planning to use for a ""free"" trip home for holidays. I could convert to cash but Im not sure thats wise. I also have 2k in crypto i could cash out. And my parents told me they're going to give me 1k for christmas. I currently have a part time job and have been interviewing for another job and am also gonna start doing catering events. I am trying to bring in 1k a week as a goal. I also am considering subletting my studio apartment in nyc for a month or two and moving in with roommates as a way of saving 600ish a month. But im not sure if it is worth the hassle. I love living alone and my apartment and the location. Not sure if finding a room temporarily for like $850 is worth the added transit costs and hassle. 

I have 2k in my checking account. And potentially another 2k if I sell my crypto (doge). And will have another 1k at christmas. Whats the best thing to do to get out of debt asap?",0,1733282100.0,povertyfinance,4,0.5,False

# The Core Players

# 1. Cotton

**The Classic**

* **Pros**: Breathable, affordable, good for sensitive skin
* **Cons**: Holds moisture, can lose shape
* **Best For**: Everyday wear, sensitive skin
* **Fun Fact**: A single square inch of cotton fabric consists of about 150 individual cotton fibers woven together

# 2. Modal/Tencel

**The Luxury Player**

* **Pros**: Ultra-soft, maintains shape, moisture-wicking
* **Cons**: Pricier, can be less durable
* **Best For**: Premium everyday wear
* **Fun Fact**: These fibers are made from dissolved wood pulp ‚Äì you're literally wearing trees!
* **Quick Note**: Tencel‚Ñ¢ is the brand name for modal and lyocell fibers made by Lenzing. Many premium brands use Tencel modal in their products.

# 3. Microfiber

**The Tech Star**

===================================

When you think about bad breath, the last thing that usually crosses your mind is your wisdom teeth. It's a topic that might not have crossed your mind, but wisdom teeth and oral hygiene go hand-in-hand in ways we often overlook. As these molars make their presence known, they can cause a myriad of dental issues, and bad breath might just be one of them. But why exactly does this happen? Let‚Äôs delve into the world of wisdom teeth and uncover how they could be the culprits behind that pesky halitosis.

Understanding Wisdom Teeth: The Basics
--------------------------------------

Before we dive into the nitty-gritty details of whether wisdom teeth can indeed cause bad breath, it's important to grasp what wisdom teeth are and the role they play in our oral health.

### What Are Wisdom Teeth?

Wisdom teeth, also known as third molars, typically emerge in late adolescence or early adulthood, usually between the ages of 17 and 25. Contrary to what you might expect, they don't often come in smoothly. In fact, many people experience discomfort, crowding, or even impaction‚Äîtraits that make these teeth more trouble than they're worth.

### Why Do We Have Them?

Once upon a time, our ancestors needed these extra molars to help chew tough plant material and raw meat. As diets evolved, so did our jaws‚Äîand now, for most of us, they're just an evolutionary leftover. Some folks have them removed due to the complications they bring along, while others keep them, wondering if they'll ever cause problems down the line.

The Link Between Wisdom Teeth and Bad Breath
--------------------------------------------

Having established what wisdom teeth are, let‚Äôs connect the dots and examine how these dental ""wisdom"" bombs can lead to bad breath.

### Bacterial Buildup

Wisdom teeth are often hard to reach, making cleaning them a challenge. This can result in food particles getting trapped around the gums, leading to bacterial growth. As bacteria multiply, they produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs)‚Äîthe real troublemakers behind that foul odor escaping your mouth.

- **Impacted Wisdom Teeth:** If your wisdom teeth are impacted, meaning they‚Äôve become trapped beneath the gum line or are growing at strange angles, this can exacerbate bad breath. The food debris caught around impacted teeth is like a recipe for disaster, just waiting to brew.

### Gum Disease

Another sneaky way wisdom teeth contribute to bad breath is through gum disease. When your gums become inflamed and irritated due to a lack of proper cleaning, it opens the floodgates for bacteria. Signs you might have gum disease include:

- Red or swollen gums
- Bleeding when brushing or flossing
- Persistent bad breath

If your wisdom teeth are positioned awkwardly, they can create pockets in your gums that are hard to clean, making it all too easy for gum disease to settle in.

### Cavities and Decay

Even if you manage to keep up with your dental hygiene, wisdom teeth can still fall prey to cavities. Due to their location, they can often trap plaque‚Äîa sticky film of bacteria‚Äîresulting in tooth decay. Rotten teeth are not only painful, but they also stink! And that‚Äôs just about as unpleasant as it gets.

How to Identify Bad Breath Related to Wisdom Teeth
--------------------------------------------------

So, you suspect your wisdom teeth could be to blame for your bad breath? Here‚Äôs how you can tell if your wisdom teeth are playing the villain.

### Signs You May Have a Problem

Bad breath often comes with other signs that indicate your wisdom teeth may be acting up. Pay attention to:

1. **Ongoing Discomfort:** Are you feeling pressure or pain in the back of your mouth?
2. **Inflamed Gums:** Check for any swelling or redness around your wisdom teeth.
3. **Difficulty Cleaning:** Do you find it nearly impossible to reach those pesky molars with your toothbrush?
4. **Accompanying Symptoms:** Are you experiencing headaches or jaw pain, as well?

If you‚Äôre nodding your head along, it‚Äôs time to take action.

### When to See the Dentist

While occasional bad breath can be brushed off, persistent halitosis related to your wisdom teeth shouldn‚Äôt be ignored. If you've noticed any of the symptoms mentioned, it‚Äôs essential to schedule an appointment with your dentist. They‚Äôll evaluate the situation, possibly take X-rays, and determine if your wisdom teeth need to be removed.

Preventing Bad Breath with Wisdom Teeth Care
--------------------------------------------

Prevention is always better than cure, right? Maintaining proper oral hygiene can significantly help mitigate bad breath associated with your wisdom teeth.

### Maintaining Oral Hygiene

Here are some tips to help keep your mouth fresh and free of embarrassing odors:

- **Brush Twice Daily:** Make sure to brush not just your teeth but also your tongue, where a lot of bacteria reside.
- **Floss Regularly:** Flossing is crucial for reaching those tricky spots around your wisdom teeth.
- **Use Mouthwash:** Antimicrobial mouthwash can help kill bacteria and freshen your breath.
- **Stay Hydrated:** Drinking water helps wash away food particles and prevent dry mouth, which can lead to bad breath.

### Professional Dental Care

Regular dental checkups are key. Don‚Äôt skip those appointments! Your dentist will keep a close eye on your wisdom teeth and help you maintain good oral health.

- **Teeth Cleanings:** These professional cleanings remove plaque and tartar build-up that you might miss at home.
- **X-rays:** Routine X-rays can reveal if your wisdom teeth are causing any trouble beneath the surface.

The Role of Diet in Bad Breath
------------------------------

What we put into our bodies matters immensely when it comes to our breath. Certain foods can cause bad breath, so being mindful of your diet is crucial, especially if you have wisdom teeth.

### Foods to Avoid

Here are some usual suspects that can contribute to bad breath:

- **Garlic and Onions:** These aromatic vegetables contain sulfur compounds that linger long after eating.
- **Sugary Snacks:** Sugar promotes the growth of bacteria in your mouth, leading to increased chances of bad breath.
- **Caffeinated Beverages:** Coffee can dry out your mouth, reducing saliva production and leading to bad breath.

### Foods That Freshen Your Breath

On the flip side, some foods can help keep your breath fresh. Consider adding these to your diet:

1. **Apples:** Their fibrous texture acts like a natural toothbrush.
2. **Carrots:** Crunchy veggies stimulate saliva flow, which helps wash away bacteria.
3. **Minty Greens:** Herbs like parsley and mint can mask bad odors effectively.

When Bad Breath is More Than Just Wisdom Teeth
----------------------------------------------

It‚Äôs important to note that bad breath can stem from numerous sources unrelated to your wisdom teeth. If you‚Äôve been diligent in your oral hygiene and have had your wisdom teeth checked but still struggle with halitosis, consider these potential causes:

### Other Dental Problems

- **Tooth Decay:** Cavalierly ignoring a cavity can lead to decay and, subsequently, bad breath.
- **Oral Infections:** Infections in the mouth, such as periodontitis, can lead to foul-smelling breath.

### Systemic Health Issues

Halitosis sometimes signals underlying health problems. Here are a few to be aware of:

- **Digestive Disorders:** Issues like acid reflux can cause unpleasant breath.
- **Diabetes:** Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to a distinctive fruity breath.
- **Liver or Kidney Issues:** Severe organ dysfunction can result in bad breath due to the body‚Äôs inability to filter waste properly.

What to Do If You Suffer from Bad Breath Related to Wisdom Teeth
----------------------------------------------------------------

If you‚Äôre at your wit's end due to bad breath linked to your wisdom teeth, fret not! There are steps you can take to regain that fresh mouth feeling.

### Home Remedies

Sometimes, you can tackle bad breath with simple home remedies before running to the dentist.

- **Baking Soda Rinse:** Mix baking soda with water and swish it around to neutralize odors.
- **Apple Cider Vinegar:** A diluted mixture can help balance mouth pH and fight bacteria.
- **Green Tea:** Sipping unsweetened green tea may help reduce bacteria and improve breath freshness.

### Seeking Professional Assistance

If home remedies don‚Äôt cut it, don‚Äôt hesitate to seek professional help. Your dentist can offer tailored solutions and, if necessary, recommend removal of your problematic wisdom teeth.

Conclusion: Unraveling the Mystery of Bad Breath Related to Wisdom Teeth
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the grand scheme of things, wisdom teeth might not seem like a big deal in the realm of oral hygiene; however, they do tend to harbor several dental woes, including bad breath. From bacterial buildup to gum disease, the connection is clear.

If you find yourself grappling with bad breath and suspect your wisdom teeth are the instigator, arm yourself with knowledge, practice good hygiene, and don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out to your dentist. Remember, regular check-ups and open communication with your dental provider are your best allies in maintaining fresh breath, particularly if wisdom teeth are involved.

I'm a first year substitute teacher in Buncombe County (f, 25, bachelor of arts and currently obtaining an mfa) and was wondering if anyone had any information on what kinds of jobs I can do over the summer. I've worked in retail and coffee shops in Asheville and I'm just really over that scene (I personally feel like I'm too old and overqualified for those jobs, but no hate ofc to anyone who does them, just not for me anymore). 

Anyway, this is my first year as a sub and I'm really loving it, but as we're about halfway through the school year I wanted to check in and see if what other substitute teachers or full-time teachers do during the summer to make money. I know there's summer session, which I can't do because I don't have a teaching license, but are there summer session assistants?  What about exam proctoring?

Sorry if all this seems super obvious, I'm just very new to working in a school district and have no idea what goes on in schools during the summer, if anything. Anyway, thanks for reading, and I appreciate the help!",0,1733281243.0,asheville,3,0.5,False

My entire world had been turned upside down in the span of mere minutes. The job I had worked so hard for almost my whole life turned out to be a living nightmare. I had been forced to torture a patient and had seen orderlies slam a patient to the ground and most likely break one of her bones. And it was still my first day.¬†



As I rolled Todd into his room, I was struck by how plain and depressing it looked. It looked more like a prison cell than a hospital room, as it should‚Äôve looked. The only bit of individuality inside the room was a carving into the wall. ‚ÄòTodd was here!‚Äô I closed the door behind us. Once I had completely rolled Todd into the room, he sprang up from his chair and practically threw himself into his bed.¬†



‚ÄúHome sweet home! Thanks, Nurse Cassandra,‚Äù he said with a chuckle as he shimmied around in bed. I stared at him a little dumbfounded over how he had so easily just left from the wheelchair after such a horrible procedure. He noticed my worry and waved his hand at me. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not too bad once you get used to it.‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúI-I‚Äôm‚Ä¶so sorry, Todd,‚Äù I told him, gripping the handles of the wheelchair and trying to keep myself from crying in front of him. I looked back up from the chair and saw that he was sitting in bed and looking at me.¬†



‚ÄúI know you didn‚Äôt mean to do it. So don‚Äôt sweat it, okay? This place is‚Ä¶fucked up. And you‚Äôre going to do and see some really bad shit. Just try not to forget who you are. And do your best to stick it to Nurse Whore,‚Äù he said with a tired smile. I finally got a good look at Todd and noticed just how malnourished he was.¬†



‚ÄúAre you eating properly?‚Äù I asked him, pushing his wheelchair to the side and quickly pulling my stethoscope out. This caught him off guard and he quickly started backing up in his bed, but I caught up to him before he could get too far away. I quickly began to listen to his heart and his lungs.¬†



‚ÄúI try not to eat the food. They know I don‚Äôt take my meds so they try to sneak it into the food.‚Äù He explained. Despite how he looked, his heart and lungs sounded just fine. I wish I could‚Äôve done a more thorough check but I did have limited means to test on him.¬†



‚ÄúWhat kind of meds?‚Äù I asked, taking my stethoscope off and softly patting it into my palm, my nurse mode completely activated.¬†



‚ÄúI wish I knew. But it turns you into one of those zombie patients. And I enjoy my personality so I try not to take them if I can help it.‚Äù Todd explained, which got me even more worried about just what type of hell I had sold my soul to.¬†



‚ÄúI have to get back to Nurse Taylor,‚Äù I told him as I looked over Todd again. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get yourself killed, please?‚Äù Those words came out of my mouth without me even thinking twice. Todd was the first person I had met at Sombra that felt like an actual person. He seemed just as caught off guard as I had been.¬†



‚ÄúHasn‚Äôt happened yet, but I promise.‚Äù He held up his pinky to me. I couldn‚Äôt help but let out a little giggle and wrapped mine around his. I took his wheelchair with me and began to make my way back towards the lobby, only getting lost once which I counted as a win for myself.¬†



‚ÄúAh, there you are Nurse Cassandra. I was beginning to think something had happened to you.‚Äù Nurse Taylor was waiting for me in the lobby with Nurse Emily and the receptionist lady I had met on my first day here. ‚ÄúTodd is safely in his room?‚Äù she asked as she motioned for Emily to take the chair from me.



‚ÄúYes, ma‚Äôam. No issues to report.‚Äù I sounded like a robot, but it was the only way I could stop myself from becoming too emotional over my current situation. My new tone seemed to make Nurse Taylor absolutely ecstatic.¬†



‚ÄúWonderful!‚Äù She clapped her hands together giddily. ‚ÄúNow, if you‚Äôd follow me, you‚Äôre going to help me administer medication to a few patients. This way you‚Äôll get an idea of how to do it.‚Äù She turned on her heels and motioned for me to follow after her. I let out a sigh and followed after her, leaving Emily and the receptionist alone in the lobby.¬†



I followed after Nurse Taylor as she made her way down the dull grey hallway. Finally, we came up to a room and she opened it up for us to enter. I followed after her and was met with a patient who was smashing his head over and over again on one of the walls of his room.¬†



‚ÄúNow, now Mr. Jordan.‚Äù Nurse Taylor told the man carefully as she walked over to him and pulled him gently away from the wall. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve talked about this, no hitting yourself, remember?‚Äù she asked him. As she pulled him away from the wall I watched, sickened, as most of his forehead skin peeled away and fell to the floor.¬†



‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt we get him some medical attention?‚Äù I asked, wanting to help the man desperately. But Nurse Taylor simply laughed in my face as she reached into her pocket and pulled out a pill. She held it up to Mr. Jordan but he didn‚Äôt seem to react at all.¬†



‚ÄúCome give me a hand, Cassandra.‚Äù She motioned for me to come over. I took a small step forward, thinking of how I could get out of it, but eventually, I just gave up and walked over to her. ‚ÄúGood girl. Now, take this pill. I‚Äôll hold Mr. Jordan‚Äôs mouth open.‚Äù¬†



I took the pill from her and looked down at it. It was a capsule of sorts, with some kind of black liquid inside of it. I held it between my fingers and watched as Nurse Taylor stuck her fingers into Mr. Jordan‚Äôs mouth and forced his jaw open violently. I thought for a second that she was going to rip his jaw off with the force she opened it. I quickly placed the pill in his mouth and stepped back as Nurse Taylor shut his mouth and tipped his head back so that he could swallow it.¬†



‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a good boy!‚Äù She smiled, patting Mr. Jordan on the head and carefully leading him to his bed. He seemed almost completely catatonic, and Taylor led her to bed without much issue. She tucked him into bed and turned to leave him, his forehead bleeding profusely from the gash he‚Äôd created.¬†



‚ÄúS-shouldn‚Äôt we bandage him?‚Äù I asked Nurse Taylor as she turned to leave Mr. Jordan alone in bed. She stared at me like I‚Äôd just spoken some foreign language at her. ‚ÄúSo that it won‚Äôt become infected?‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúDon‚Äôt bother with something so pointless dear.‚Äù She patted me on the head like I was an idiot and walked out into the hall. Before I could even think of trying to help Mr. Jordan, Nurse Taylor grabbed me by the wrist and yanked me away from his room. She led me to another few patients' rooms. Each one was inhabited by a husk of a human, with one of them, a girl who looked barely above 18, tied down to the bed. I was told that this had happened to her because she kept trying to chew through her wrists. She was bound to her bed by her arms and legs and even her neck was tied down to the bed.¬†



‚ÄúThis is inhumane‚Ä¶‚Äù I mumbled as I continued to follow after Nurse Taylor. She stopped in her tracks and I actually bumped into her. I quickly backed up and watched as she spun on her heels to stare at me.¬†



‚ÄúOh sweetie, these aren‚Äôt people anymore. They‚Äôre addicts.‚Äù She was so condescending that it made me sick. Staring at her, for the first time in my life, I actually felt like punching someone in the face. ‚ÄúThey made the choices that led to them being treated here. They stopped being human when they decided to become addicts.‚Äù I was disgusted by how she could say this about people who needed help.¬†



Before I could even raise my voice against her, I felt a lingering presence behind me. ‚ÄúWhat the hell are you doing?‚Äù A tired posh voice asked us. I turned my head to find that Constantine Sinclair was standing behind me, nursing a cup of coffee with his umbrella now open and shielding him from the fluorescent lights above his head.¬†



‚ÄúS-Sir! I was just showing our new nurse here how to correctly deal with our patients!‚Äù Nurse Taylor‚Äôs demeanor had shifted again. Now she seemed like a desperate housewife who had an abusive husband. ‚ÄúI was also educating her about our addicts and such,‚Äù she said with a forced chuckle, grabbing my arm and pulling me over to her.¬†



‚ÄúHm,‚Äù Sinclair grunted, clearly not giving a shit about what she was saying. He took a long sip of his coffee as he stared down at me and Taylor. As I stared at him, I could‚Äôve sworn that from inside his umbrella I could see two white eyes staring back at me from the void. ‚ÄúWhatever, just make sure she knows her place.‚Äù He walked past us without another word.¬†



Taylor let out a long sigh like she had been holding her breath the entire time that Sinclair had been standing there in front of us. ‚ÄúGoodness me, he‚Äôs in such a good mood today!‚Äù she said, her face turning red as she watched him walk away. I didn‚Äôt think that was the case, he looked like he‚Äôd been in an absolute shit mood.¬†



‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all for today, Cassandra. I want you to take everything I‚Äôve taught you to heart. You‚Äôll be given more responsibilities tomorrow, understand?‚Äù she asked after she had regained her composure. I wanted to say something back to her, but I figured it would be better to just keep quiet. I was left alone and decided to go back to my room.¬†



I had come back to the employees-only section and had scanned my card to open the door when one of the nurses suddenly bumped into me and started running away down the hallway. Before I could process that, four other nurses quickly chased after her.¬†



‚ÄúW-what‚Äôs happening?‚Äù I asked one of the nurses inside as I closed the door behind me. She looked at me and looked like she was processing what I had just asked her.¬†



‚ÄúOh, she cracked. Couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. Shame really, I liked her.‚Äù She shrugged as she looked back down at her clipboard.¬†



‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going to happen to her?‚Äù I asked. The clipboard nurse looked at me puzzled, and then, after staring at me for a second, she nodded.¬†



‚ÄúYou‚Äôre new. Well, she‚Äôs probably going to Mr. Sinclair‚Äôs office. Point of advice sweetie. You don‚Äôt want to be sent there.‚Äù She tucked her clipboard under her arm and walked away, leaving me more terrified than I‚Äôd been before I walked in. I quickly ran past other nurses and ran to my room, quickly slamming the door behind me and feeling a panic attack coming on.¬†



As I slammed my back against my door and slid down to the floor I noticed that another sticky note had been left on my mirror. I stood up and quickly ran over to the mirror and snatched up the note. To my surprise, it was a doodle of me and who I assumed was Todd together with a heart around us. I was so caught off guard that I let out a snort and giggled to myself as I felt a few tears fall from my cheek. I was sure that Todd was behind this, though I had no idea how he‚Äôd managed to sneak into the employees-only section and then into my room. I took the little doodle and stuck it back on my mirror with the others.¬†



After I took a few minutes to compose myself, I decided to go visit Todd. He was the first person I had met at Sombra that felt like an actual person. He seemed just so easy to talk to. I walked out of the employees-only section and out into the hallways. As I walked down them and toward Todd‚Äôs room I had to walk past several husks and I did my best to check on them and make sure that they were okay. Most of them were unresponsive to my questions and only seemed to react when I poked and prodded at them. A few of them had serious injuries, and I did my best to bandage them with the few bandaids and pieces of gauze I had in my pockets.¬†



After ‚Äòtreating‚Äô the last husk I came across I walked over to Todd‚Äôs room and opened the door. I was surprised to find him holding a chair over his head like he was about to smash me over the head with it.¬†



‚ÄúOh shit, it‚Äôs you!‚Äù he said in surprise, quickly setting the chair back down and letting out an exasperated laugh. ‚ÄúI thought you were gonna be an orderly or Nurse Whore.‚Äù He sat down on the chair he was about to hit me with and let out a long loud laugh.¬†



‚ÄúYou could‚Äôve killed me!‚Äù I panted, clutching my heart from the sheer panic that had come over me. ‚ÄúMore importantly, how did you get into my room?‚Äù I demanded to know, crossing my arms at him and doing my best to act tough.¬†



‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù He asked, clearly confused. ‚ÄúAre you crazy, lady? If you think I was able to sneak into the employees-only section and I‚Äôd still choose to stay here, maybe you‚Äôre the one who belongs here, not me.‚Äù He scoffed, leaning back in the chair and pushing it back to balance on the two back legs.¬†



‚ÄúThen‚Ä¶‚Äù I looked around his room and noticed that he also had a sticky note stuck to his wall. I walked over quickly to it and got a better look at it.¬†



‚ÄúPlease, by all means, go through my stuff.‚Äù He followed my movements with his eyes and watched as I took the sticky note off of his wall.¬†



‚ÄúSo, you didn‚Äôt draw this?‚Äù I asked him, staring at the sticky note that had a doodle of Todd on it. He was smoking a cigarette and flipping me off. It was a good likeness of him.¬†



‚ÄúNo, that was the doodler,‚Äù Todd said, almost losing his balance and falling backward onto the floor. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got no idea who it is, or why they do it, but they leave those doodles all over the place.‚Äù Todd shrugged as he sat up straight in the chair and stood up quickly. ‚ÄúWanna have a smoke break?‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúYou aren‚Äôt allowed to have cigarettes in rehab.‚Äù I squinted at him as I stuck the doodle back onto the wall. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôd you even get them?‚Äù He walked past me and stuck his hand into his pillowcase. And he pulled out a pack of cigarettes, starting to smack the box against his hand.¬†



‚ÄúThat receptionist gets them for me. In return, I help her carry all the heavy shit she needs to file.‚Äù Todd chuckled as he walked past me and out into the hall. I shook my head as I followed after him. Though I really couldn‚Äôt judge him, if this place was shaping up to be hell on Earth, then he might as well enjoy his cancer sticks.¬†



I followed him as he led us to the garden, and thanked him as he held the door open for me. We both picked a bench in the corner of the garden and I sat next to Todd as he sparked his BIC lighter to life and lit his cigarette.¬†



‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶what are you addicted to?‚Äù I asked him, trying and failing to make small talk with him. He stared at me and couldn‚Äôt help but laugh in my face. I felt my face go red in embarrassment and I quickly turned to avoid his gaze and cackles.¬†



‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it. I just love how straightforward you were about it!‚Äù He snickered as he took a deep drag of his smoke. ‚ÄúPills mostly. Xanax, oxy, barbiturates, you name it. Sleeping pills especially.‚Äù He held his cigarette in his mouth as he leaned back on the bench and stared up at the sky. ‚ÄúThis was supposed to be a fresh start‚Ä¶a fat load of good it did me.‚Äù He closed his eyes and let out a tired sigh, a puff of smoke escaping his lips.¬†



‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry.‚Äù I reached over and took his hand into mine. ‚ÄúI came here wanting to help people. It‚Äôs always been my life‚Äôs passion. And now look where it‚Äôs gotten me.‚Äù I found myself squeezing his hand subconsciously. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt help anyone here‚Ä¶they won‚Äôt let me help anyone.‚Äù I noticed that I had been squeezing his hand and I quickly let it go.¬†



‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mean to sound like a dick, but do I have to call you Cassandra?‚Äù I looked up at him and saw that he was now staring at me with a smile. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs way too stuffy and formal, I‚Äôd rather call you something easier.‚Äù He said with a wink. He stared at me for a moment before looking up at my hair. ‚ÄúWhat about Red? I like that much better.‚Äù¬†



I smiled at him and let out a little giggle. ‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt very original, but I like it,‚Äù¬† I said as I pushed a lock of my hair back into place behind my ear. Todd nodded and smiled back at me. Suddenly he spat out his cigarette and quickly stomped on it. He then grabbed my arm and yanked me out of the bench, pulling me into the bush behind it. ‚ÄúW-what are you‚Ä¶?‚Äù Before I could process everything he quickly covered my mouth with his hand and shushed me.¬†



‚ÄúGet away from me!‚Äù A girl screamed before suddenly falling in front of us where we had been sitting on the bench beforehand. I quickly shoved myself into Todd‚Äôs chest as I watched the horror before me unfold.¬†



‚ÄúThe less you fight this, the quicker it‚Äôll end.‚Äù A tired posh voice told the screaming woman. It was Constantine Sinclair. I watched from behind the bush as he placed his foot on the woman‚Äôs head and held it there as she squirmed uncontrollably. ‚ÄúWell get on with it, this bitch is going to ruin my shoes at this rate.‚Äù It sounded like he was talking to someone but I didn‚Äôt see anyone else there.¬†



The woman was suddenly bitten in the face by a tar-covered creature that had emerged from seemingly nowhere. I couldn‚Äôt help but let out a horrified and muffled scream, lucky for me Todd still had his hand over my mouth stopping any noise from escaping. The creature ripped large chunks of flesh off of the woman, and before our eyes, it had devoured every ounce of the woman. There wasn‚Äôt a single sign that she had even been there.¬†



‚ÄúGod damn it, you got blood on my suit. When will you learn to eat your food less sloppily?‚Äù Sinclair hissed in anger, as he walked away. The tar figure seemed to disappear into his shadow as he walked away. I looked up at Todd and he slowly and carefully lowered his hand from my mouth.¬†



‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what happens when you‚Äôre a patient here.‚Äù He let out a pained sigh. I stared back at where the woman had once been. Just what had I gotten myself into?¬†

I would preferably want it to work like the regular boundary walls when my hands/head get near some object I define (like a coffee table), it would be blue and red depending on how close I am to it.  That's what I thought the layout app was for, but I guess it is mainly just a visualization tool.  Is this perhaps coming in a future update?  If anyone has information on something like this for the Quest 3, whether modded, an additional app, or otherwise, that would be great (but preferably a solution that still allows for warranty if something goes wrong with my VR, as I just got it).

On a second note, seeing the level tool in this app is really cool, if I ever have to hang stuff on a wall, it would be nice to be able to use that tool if I don't have a level handy (though I wish the lines weren't so thick).

Update: so I know the general consensus is that the wine looked cooler than the white, and I hear you. But seeing as it was their literal first outing, I really to try & salvage them if possible.

Between my mom‚Äôs advice and everything here, I was feeling overwhelmed. The dry cleaners had closed, I‚Äôm in the UK & can‚Äôt get everything that was suggested, and I don‚Äôt have many of the more basic cleaners on hand (you can bet I won‚Äôt be caught unawares again!).

I elected to rinse with cold water first. The wine had been sitting for hours, but I tried to rinse whatever I could. Then I followed the directions for the one stain remover I could get at the corner shop‚ÄîDr Beckmann Stain Devil Fruit & Drinks. It has red wine pictured & listed on the front of the bottle.

It said to dilute the contents in warm water, and then soak items for several hours. I soaked the most soiled one for about two hours, as well as the damaged laces and my socks. I could hardly believe it when I checked on them about an hour and a half later.

For good measure & the sake of balance, I put everything including the spared shoe in for a little bit longer. If anything yellowed or whatnot, it would at least be shared, right? What do I know‚ÄîI bought white shoes in the first place, so I don‚Äôt think I should be trusted.

The lighting in the flat isn‚Äôt great, but I think they look‚Ä¶.bland and back to normal? For the most part? I agree, not nearly as fun as that nice pink, but I can always get that tie dye back, if I change my mind.

May do another soak once I‚Äôve seen them in the light of day. Thanks all for the jokes and the suggestions‚Äîmuch appreciated levity & insight! I‚Äôm glad to have found my red wine spillers. Cheers!!! üç∑",316,1733280519.0,CleaningTips,12,0.99,False

I tried to make friends at the beginning of the semester but I just couldn't. I don't understand what I did wrong. I texted people to ask what activities they were going to go to during initiation week. I tried to do some small talk with people in my program in the bus. Even asked them to study at a coffee shop but they wanted to study alone since there was soon an exam. I thought they would text me back at another time but no. 

I have the impression that most of the people already have a group of friends. My cousin said that I should really make some friends in my program to have people to study with but I just can't. What could I possibly do wrong? Well, I know that I'm shy and I'm awkward, but I've always had some friends either way.

Do you have some advices to make friends mid year? I already know that some may say to join club but there's not really a lot of club in my uni. What do you talk about with someone you know mostly nothing? And how do you just begin to talk to them? Do you know some ways to approach someone?

1h65nb6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h65nb6/the_elf_on_my_shelf_unwound_itself/,The elf on my shelf unwound itself.,"When I was a child, one of my favorite things about the holiday season was the elf on the shelf.  The idea that he was making sure I would stay on the nice list really made Santa feel more realistic. 

After my parents passed, my brother didn't show an interest in it. So I decided to take it home and try and recreate the same magic of Christmas for my own kids.

For the past two years, the new tradition has been a success. My oldest daughter, Kayla, seems to love it almost as much as I did.

Like the past years, I dug through the Christmas decorations for the elf. I'd put him on the coffee table in the living room on December 1st.

Continuously calling it 'the elf' is making my anxiety worse. When I was a kid, we decided to name it Jingles. This is because Jingles has these large gilded bells on his feet.

Anyways, I put Jingles out right before I got ready for bed. My wife, Marcy, had already gone to sleep hours before. I then went through my usual routine of going to the bathroom, making sure the outside doors are locked, then turning off the lights. I laid down on the bed, and after only like 5 seconds shit starts getting weird.

Have you ever ripped a shirt? That's the best way i can describe it. It sounded like cloth ripping. I got back out of bed. I thought it was just the dog spazzing out, I haven't had the time to get him fixed yet. 

I stubbed my pinky toe on the dresser, trying not to make a noise and wake up Marcy. As soon as I opened the bedroom door, I knew something was wrong. Brutus, my GSD, nosed the door all the way open and dove under the blankets. I quietly closed the door, got the gun from my safe, and stepped into the hall.

I went down the stairs and peeked around the corner into the living room. 

Dull moonlight filters in through the windows. A dull amber glow is emanating from the coffee table. Pieces of Jingles were everywhere. It looked like he got shot by birdshot..

In the place of Jingles, was something else. A writhing mass of bright red and white tentacles. They kept twisting to keep the same pose I put Jingles in. There were no features, no eyes, no nose or mouth. Just a vaguely humanoid amalgamation, whose appendages ended in a large hook.

I did what at the time I thought was the best idea. There was no way I was going to let that... thing get any closer to my family.  I silently switched the safety off of my grandfather's 1911. 

As soon as I turned the corner to shoot, the tentacles all undulated at once. The speed which it moved... It was already climbing up my leg. I dropped the gun and tried to peel it off. My face got covered and I panicked. I was digging at the tentacles near my mouth for air. They tried to go in my mouth, I bit down hard. The fluid that came out tasted like sour milk, it also gave off a vapor like smelling salts. I fought the urge to cough. The tentacles went up my nose, I could hear popping and separating. Then the world went black.

What I saw next hasn't left my mind since. Maybe im just stressed from work. Maybe the stress is making me hallucinate? I pray to God that it's just stress. Every time I try to sleep, or blink, I see the same scenes again. In my dream, I saw several terrible, grotesque images.
The first thing I saw was the gift of flesh. Two tentacle beings were standing in front of a Christmas tree.  The tree had pure white tentacles in place of ribbon and tinsel. Pieces of festering viscera, gore, and organs replaced ornaments. At the top of the tree, red tentacles formed an undulating star. From the star, a dull red glow emitted that painted the rest of the scene.

The two tentacle beings began chanting, appearing to begin a ritual of some kind. They rose up and became rigid. Simultaneously, they ripped off their left arm. Fluid gushed from the cavity of severed tentacles as they presented their arm to the other. The process repeated, with each appendage being gifted to the other. Finally, the dream ended in one writhing mass under the pale glow.

The second dream began as a void. I was floating in an all consuming darkness, until I heard him. Dreadful wailing began and slowly got louder.In the distance a pale red glow came in to view. A team of reindeer pulled a sleigh into view 

The deer in the 'Rudolph' position was almost rotted completely through. Pieces of hide fell off, and revealed a skeleton underneath. It had three extra legs. The way they twitched reminded me of the tentacles. Every other reindeer was less decayed, hanging, limp in the harness.

In the sleigh, was a convulsing mass of red and white tentacles. Next to it was a bag made of what looked like human leather. It was stuffed to the seams, overflowing with organs and gore.

They stopped when the lead reindeer was right in my face. The red mass of tentacles around it's head undulated at once, releasing a increasingly bright red light. My whole body radiated in pain as I was slowly erased from the scene.

I woke up from these two visions to Marcy shaking me awake. My eyes snapped open. I was in the living room. All evidence of Jingles was erased. Marcy told me she came down the stairs to make coffee, then saw me unconscious with my gun nearby. The way she looked at me... with such concern, just wanting an answer. It broke something in me, I think. I couldn't answer. I didn't know what to say. I hadn't even had time to process what I just dreamed. If only I could stop now.

I walked up the stairs and put the gun back in the safe without saying a word. When I tried to compose myself and come back downstairs, Marcy had taken Kayla to cheer practice. 

I spent the next three hours looking for Jingles or any sign of him. Brutus refused to leave the bedroom. I found a gilded bell in the master bathroom.

I've tried looking for an answer, an explanation, a similarity. I've tried looking here on reddit, but I haven't found anything. I also didn't have luck on 4chan boards either. Please if you know what this is or what what to do, please let me know.

It's now late evening. Marcy hasn't come back and won't answer my calls. I guess that's good in a way. At least they are safe. 

I'm completely on edge, the sunset kept giving me flashbacks to the light. I unplugged all the lights and tore down the decorations. I cant calm down. Those moments, those scenes just keep playing over and over in my mind. I'm not sure how much more I can take. 


Well, if I don't post an update soon....

Stay safe and Merry Christmas..",2,1733280022.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

In every MCQ I've had before this, in the lectures, and in the textbook (right) I have to reduce the contribution received by the FV of the premiums given to arrive at contribution revenue. 



According to the solution to the question (left), ""Generally the difference between the fair value of dues or other purchases and the amount transferred is classified as a contribution. When, however, the contributions relate to a major ongoing portion of the operation of the organization, the contribution revenues are displayed gross and the cost of the premium is displayed as fund-raising expense.""

  
So, do I only show the contributions gross in the very particular situation when the contribution is designated for the (key words) *mIsSiOn oF tHe OrGaNiZaTiOn*, and show the contributions net of the premiums in all other situations? I also don't understand why the textbook seems to say that premiums are both an expense (first and second paragraphs) and a reduction of revenue (paragraph 3 and passkey). If the real exam questions are actually going to be this niche... I might be cooked like a turkey on Thanksgiving.

Be punctual now so you can be punctual later when it matters. How are you gonna learn to be a diligent decent employee with dumb habits like these.

And what makes me real mad is the unionized stores.

If you people are in a Union you better act like it. People in Unions don‚Äôt call out for bs reasons.

You think IBEW is gonna be happy to hear I call out numerous times a month?

I‚Äôm shocked because Starbucks is a HUGE company with standards.

And it enables its employees to game the system by giving them the option to call out whenever they want basically.

I feel bad for managers like my gf that have to constantly come in to make up for the call outs and the DMs that drill managers for not getting their numbers up or other bs reasons like an uncleanly store or bad out the window times.

Like it‚Äôs your corporate policy. Fix it. Do not give PART TIME workers the ability to call out all the time. Punish them.

These are college kids living at home that don‚Äôt give af about their team or store. 

I don‚Äôt need to work at Starbucks to see how bs this all is.

Sandra Martinez stood by the window, her reflection a cold silhouette against the dark glass. Her reputation preceded her‚Äîa manager so ruthless, her employees whispered about her behind closed doors.

""Another late report,"" she muttered, her voice cutting through the silence like a knife. Mark, a junior analyst, had been working overtime for weeks. His pale face was etched with exhaustion, dark circles beneath his eyes telling a story of constant verbal abuse and impossible expectations.

In the break room, hushed conversations had been brewing for months. ""She destroyed Jennifer's career last month,"" whispered Rachel, the HR coordinator. ""Reported her for a minor error, had her transferred to a dead-end department.""

The collective hatred had transformed from water cooler complaints to something darker. Something dangerous.

""We can't take this anymore,"" Tom from accounting said, his fingers tracing the rim of his coffee mug. ""She's ruined too many lives.""

The plan was simple yet intricate. They would invite Sandra to an after-hours performance review‚Äîa meeting she'd never refuse, given her obsession with control and perfectionism.

The abandoned warehouse on the city's outskirts seemed perfect. Isolated. Remote. Silent.

Sandra arrived precisely at 7:00 PM, her high heels clicking against the concrete floor. ""Where is everyone?"" she demanded, her voice echoing in the empty space.

The door clicked shut behind her.

""Your performance review begins now,"" Mark said, stepping from the shadows. But something in his voice was different. Colder. Calculated.

What happened next was beyond their wildest revenge fantasies. The screams that night were not what anyone expected‚Äînot Sandra's, but something... else.

When the police arrived days later, they found the warehouse empty. No trace of Sandra. No trace of her employees.

Just a single typed note on the dusty floor:

*Some monsters are better left unexposed.*

Here is a brief research I did with chat gpt on whether there are any profitable companies that have been delisted from the nasdaq and I share with you what I found:

Comparative Summary: MathStar, Luckin Coffee and SMCI.

 1. MathStar Inc.
- Context: Technology company focused on data processing, which faced financial viability issues.
- Missing catalysts:
  - Failed to hire a new CFO or take effective governance actions.
  - Failed to present a solid plan to maintain its Nasdaq listing.
  - Lacked significant support from large investors or insider buyouts.
  - Was never profitable; accumulated losses and faced constant financial difficulties.
- Result: It was delisted in 2008 after failing to meet the $1.00 minimum price required by the Nasdaq.

 2. Luckin Coffee
- Context: Chinese coffee shop chain that grew quickly and came to compete with Starbucks in China.
- Lacking catalysts:
  - There was no hiring of a new CFO prior to its delisting, although layoffs were made following the discovery of the fraud.
  - Failed to obtain a Nasdaq extension after it was discovered that it inflated its revenue by $300 million.
  - The statements of its auditors (EY) were negative after detecting irregularities.
  - Despite initial interest from large investors, buying sentiment dropped sharply after the scandal.
  - It reported growth, but was not really profitable, as its figures were falsified.
- Result: It was delisted in 2020 for financial fraud.

 3. Super Micro Computer Inc (SMCI) Context: Super Micro Computer Inc.
- Context: Profitable technology company and leader in high-performance servers, currently under review for regulatory concerns.
- Catalysts present:
  - Is in the process of hiring a new CFO to strengthen its governance.
  - Has filed for a Nasdaq extension and has received support from large investors.
  - Recent insider purchases reflect confidence in the company's future.
  - It is profitable, with robust revenues and no signs of fraud in its operations.
- Expected Outcome: SMCI is well positioned to avoid a delisting, depending on its compliance with Nasdaq regulations.

 Conclusion
After analyzing these cases, it is clear that no examples have been found of profitable companies that have been delisted from the Nasdaq for reasons other than political, geopolitical problems or serious financial fraud. 

SMCI stands out for its strong financial position and leadership in its industry, which significantly differentiates it from companies such as MathStar or Luckin Coffee. This reinforces confidence that, if it maintains its governance and compliance efforts, it can avoid delisting and continue to grow in its market.

I also share with you other companies that i researched with chat gpt and the curious thing is that i could not find really profitable companies that have been delisted from the nasdaq other than for political or geopolitical problems.

1. China Mobile Ltd.:
   - Description: One of the largest telecommunications companies in China.
   - Reason for Delisting: In 2021, it was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange due to restrictions imposed by the U.S. government, related to national security concerns.
2. US Airways:
   - Description: An American airline that operated domestic and international flights.
   - Reason for Delisting: It was delisted in 2004 after declaring bankruptcy for the second time. Subsequently, it merged with American Airlines.
3. Dell Technologies:
   - Description: A multinational technology company known for manufacturing computers and related services.
   - Reason for Delisting: In 2013, it was delisted following a leveraged buyout that made it a private company. In 2018, it returned to public trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
4. Burger King:
   - Description: A multinational fast-food chain specializing in hamburgers.
   - Reason for Delisting: It was delisted in 2010 after being acquired by 3G Capital. Later, in 2014, it merged with Tim Hortons to form Restaurant Brands International, which is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange.",10,1733279516.0,SMCIDiscussion,0,0.82,False

Finally after a year of searching for someone to take my insurance or be cheap enough for me to be able to afford assessment, I found a therapist who is a Certified Autism Specialist, who offered me a discount with her sliding scale fee due to being on disability (for anxiety). With the discount and a little financial help from a good friend I am able to just barely afford to get the testing covered, then came the doubts. The paperwork she gave me was extensive asking about everything from 3rd grade academics to how my mother's pregnancy was with me. This is were the doubt set in, I know autism is a developmental disorder but I feel like I wasn't that bad as a kid. I got good enough grades and didnt really struggle that much once i got to later elementary school. Sure i was an awkward kid who was unable to really make any friends but some of the questions the ask in the extensive history just dont ring true to me for all and im nervous that Ive convinced myself of the possibility of having autism without really understand the nitty gritty of what that entails. I can do things like understand sarcasm okay I guess and while I do pace around and rub the top of my pants (to stim?) its not like I go insane when I dont do it.  Regardless I'm talking with my dad tomorrow to try to fill out the developmental history and see if theres anything there I was unaware of. I also have an anxiety disorder (can you tell?) so I'm worried I'm mistaking my anxiety symptoms and traits for autism. I do prefer being alone and I can't stand being around people because I feel vulnerable in social situation and don't really understand how to be social when not online. Being autistic would explain a lot about my life, trouble fitting in, being disinterested in activities most people enjoy (coffee, sex, sports, socializing), and my intense interests in things like video games and neuroscience. I'm just having doubts that I'm about to waste a lot of money for the therapist just to tell me I dont have autism even the slightest bit....",4,1733279451.0,AutismTranslated,1,0.75,False
