Orion wakes up early, feeling the weight of another day on the job. His routine is mundane, but it keeps his mind busy, distracting him from the memories of his wife.  He downs his coffee, puts on his uniform, and heads to the sheriff’s department.

At the department, Orion works closely with Rylan  handling smaller cases—mostly petty crimes or disturbances. However, Orion’s wife’s death still looms over them, and any mention of car accidents puts Orion on edge. There’s a sense of unease in the air, but Orion brushes it off, reminding himself to stay focused. He has a job to do, and as much as revenge lingers in the back of his mind, he needs to stay grounded for the sake of his team. 

Throughout the day, Orion is efficient, focused, but everyone at the station can sense a tension within him. Rylan noticing his partner’s unease, tries to lighten the mood, but there’s no escaping the cloud that lingers over Orion's head. They talk about Rosalie, Orions wife, how much she would have loved seeing Sarah and Orion getting closer, something that always brings a bittersweet smile to his face. He spends most of the day drowning in reports and patrols, but the reminder of rose tugs at him.

Meanwhile, Sarah’s at school, blending into the sea of students but standing out just enough to catch the eye of her peers. She’s not one to seek attention, but there’s something about her demeanor that people gravitate toward. As she navigates her classes, her thoughts drift to the upcoming weekend. She overhears conversations about a big party happening, but she doesn’t think much of it—parties aren't really her scene.

During lunch, one of the more popular students, Sarah had casually talked to in class, strikes up a conversation with her. They seem genuinely interested in getting to know her better. They mention the party and, sensing Sarah's hesitation, play it off like it’s no big deal. ""It’s just a chill hangout,"" they say. Sarah, after some convincing, agrees to stop by. Part of her feels like she’s stepping out of her comfort zone, but another part is curious. After all, she could use a little break from her routine.

As the day winds down, Sarah gets more excited about the idea of going to the party. It's not just about the event itself, but more about experiencing something different. She calls Orion about her plans, hoping he won’t be too protective or suspicious, but she knows he trusts her judgment. They’ve been through enough, and he knows how strong she is",1,1728403780.0,Mynovels,0,0.99,False

But first a little backstory, been posting about a girl who ended things w me because of trust issues she had with me about 2 months ago.  I didnt cheat, but I wasnt upfront about some other things.



Anyway. Not too long thereafter, she started looking for reasons to get in touch w me.  I tried to use these to make dates with her, but it hasnt worked out.  The most recent example was this past Sunday, as she was driving home from work she called me.  I flirted and teased her a bit, then tried to set up plans. I have been trying to set up dates back at the crib for some time now, and each time she pushes back saying she feels uncomfortable doing that.  This time, however, things really escalated

  
At one point, she mentioned wanting to go a coffee house (not a close one, one thats 30min away from me) and a haunted house with me, and when I heard that, it just struck me as off.  It bothers me that this girl was so willing to end the relationship with me, then all of a sudden, is so down to propose all these intimate cute activities and expect us to pick up where we left off, without so much as even a buildup or 'catching up' phase first.  Its just weird man.

  
Anyway, I articulated that to her (prob should not have engaged her on a logical level like that, but whatever, too late now), and this girl goes off.  She tells me how she doesnt want to do anything else with me, she just wants to have fun so she can remember the good times, she doesnt want to go to a 'quiet place' to catch up because its just gonna bring back bad memories she has of me. She continues, 'and even now, all you want is for me to come over and climb into bed with you so you can fuck me.  thats fucking DISGUSTING'.  'All you want is sex, thats all you wanted all along.  Everything was a lie. Youre fucking disgusting, youre a liar and you ruined something so perfect we had this summer.  It was so special to me and you fucking ruined it.  Why did you have to do that???'. Etc etc.  ""This was such a mistake getting in touch with you, never call me, never contact me, delete my number and block me because I dont ever want to speak to you again.""  she said he was going to block me and delete me, and hung up, and that was that.  I just checked our iMessages and snapchat and it doesnt seem shes blocked me or anything.  But still.  Oof.

  
So yeah.  Not our best moment.  Ive honestly never heard her lash out at me like that and it bothers me on a deeper level to be called disgusting because I know the type of person I am.  At the same time, I tend to be very empathetic so I can see where her mindset might be.

  
I know many responses are gonna be ""fuck that bitch, move on, shes crazy"".  At this point Im just looking for feedback / input on the situation in general.  Do you guys think shes gonna hit me up again? Been 2 months now and starting the second week shes been hitting me up on a weekly basis.  I do think that if I decide to proceed forward with this, that crib dates are prob not the way to go lol. What does CW say about women who insist on not coming back to the crib when they are the ones who broke up with you? I know his line is ""give me a call in 2-3 weeks and maybe ill be up for something more formal then"", but does he actually go through with the 'more formal' date at that point?",1,1728403497.0,CoreyWayne,0,1.0,False

1fz3aew,https://www.reddit.com/r/tampa/comments/1fz3aew/how_to_use_a_prius_hybrid_as_an_emergency/,How To Use a Prius Hybrid As An Emergency Generator,"I learned how to set up my 2012 Prius Hybrid for use as an emergency generator during a power outage. The set up was relatively inexpensive. My supplies came to $277, although it could be done for a less if one already owns some of the items such as a heavy duty extension cord, which accounted for about half the cost of my system. 

This method of temporary power supply will not provide enough electricity to run a household but it can run a refrigerator, some fans, some lights, a computer, charge cell phones, and operate a few small kitchen items such as a small coffee pot, a crock pot, and/or a rice cooker. It would also possible to run a very small, 500-600 Watt, window-unit type air conditioner- enough to cool one small room- using this system (see link below for typical Wattage use and system limits). 

The parts are easy to apply and remove as needed, are small enough to store well in a closet, and do not require any maintenance or upkeep other than normal, routine car maintenance. 

This system is inexpensive to operate and does not damage the car or the appliances.

This system is more fuel efficient than a gasoline generator but not as powerful. I calculated that I could run the items listed above (minus the window unit air conditioner) for 5 — 7 days one one 9 gallon tank of gasoline. A standard gasoline generator uses ½ to 1 gallon of gasoline per hour. 

This system is cleaner that a gasoline generator also. A hybrid vehicle produces far less cO2 than a standard gasoline generator although one will still need to take precautions to avoid any cO2 exposure. Standard precautions require that a generator be 20 feet or more away from a dwelling.

I am convinced that my coworker got me fired because I know they are doing things that would get THEM fired. 

First - I was out for 2 weeks for medical. I had major surgery about 6 weeks prior to being fired. Out of the $56k they cite, $20k I believe was his fault, or at least he was partly to blame. And it was recoverable and normal. Otherwise, I was on top of all my work - even after my time out. My coworker did the bare minimum while I was gone, and I came back early so they wouldn’t be short-handed. 

Second - the SH. It NEVER HAPPENED!!! It wasn’t even against a person. The first time they talked to me it was because I may or may not have said something about “Afternoon Delight” with my boyfriend at lunch. I remember talking about the song at one point and I remember talking about a lunch date with my boyfriend, but never together. I refused to sign the paperwork. It felt completely weird. When I was fired, they said my coworker “witnessed a FaceTime call that was inappropriate.”  I had about 3 FaceTime calls ever. And never ever inappropriate. I’m careful. 

About the coworker. Only one person can see my desk. I believe he was trying to get rid of me before I got rid of him - legitimately. He gets in late, takes 30-45 minute coffee breaks, is away from his desk for an additional 30-60 minutes chatting with the ladies in HR, takes 60+ minute lunches (he had a deal where he could leave early if he took a 30 minute lunch,) watches videos for a couple hours in the afternoon, and NEVER EVER works a minute beyond his time. When he was getting his masters degree, he took a lot of that time to do homework. Basically the company paid him to get his degree during work time. I had at least double the workload due to my divisions growth and his divisions shrinking (not our faults, just business cycle.) I wonder how he heard my calls since he had his noise cancellation earbuds in all the time and it was a running joke that you could stand behind his desk and scream his name and he wouldn’t hear you. I had a stress ball on my desk labeled “Hey $&@?” that I would toss at him to get his attention. 

Anyway, I don’t believe that I was fired legitimately. The charges were made up, but I don’t have proof. Nor was I allowed to ask questions or explain myself. ",0,1728403042.0,legaladvice,1,0.33,False

I’m training for my first marathon (Detroit, October 20th). I’m using the NRC training plan, which has its pros and cons. Anyways, last weekend I had my longest training run of 20 miles, which was intimidating, of course. But after I was done, I just… felt like it should have been harder. I had planned the rest of my day to not have any obligations so I could rest or nap as needed. But I basically felt normal the rest of the day - maybe a little hungrier and not exactly bursting with energy, but carried on with a pretty normal day. No soreness in the following days either. Don’t get me wrong, I’m definitely happy about all of that. But I know people typically say they hit the wall at about 20 miles. I’m just wondering if I just got lucky, if it’s a good sign I’m in good shape for my marathon, or if I have a rude surprise ahead on me on race day once I exceed 20. I’ve stuck to the training plan pretty strictly, running 5 days per week, with probably only two missed short runs in the whole 18 weeks, so I’m hoping the good experience with the 20 miler wasn’t just an anomaly, but a testament to my hard work. Or maybe you all are chuckling, thinking “he has no idea what he’s in for” lol

Training details:
My 20 miler was at a 9:08 avg mile, which is roughly what I hope to average for my marathon, although just finishing is my main goal.

- 2 hours pre-run: two pancakes w/ maple syrup and a cup of black coffee
- Starting at 45 minutes into run, I alternate Honey Stinger gel and waffle every 30 minutes, with about 6oz water each.",1,1728402834.0,Marathon_Training,0,1.0,False
1fz354x,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReddXReads/comments/1fz354x/adventures_in_beard_dodging/,Adventures in Beard Dodging.,"Prologue.

Hi everyone. I figured I'd share my experiences with dodging (successfully and not so much) various leg and neck beards throughout my teens and 20s.  Many will vary in their beardiness. Because many of these events happened over a decade ago, a few conversations may be embellished for entertainment purposes, with personalities preserved by the sheer shock that burned itself into my brain. Since this focuses on multiple different beards, I labeled it as miscellaneous, but if I different label is needed, please let me know and I'll fix it.

A little back ground. I'm gonna start this story during my freshman year of high school, when I was a weird mix of redneck, goth kid, and nerdy quiet kid. I had grown up in a very redneck household and was dealing with the teen angst that led me to get into heavy metal, and in middle school I had discovered anime and goth culture. There are gonna be a few time gaps in this story because there were times I was able to dodge beards, but I still somehow always ended up around one or two eventually, but I doubt you want to read about me just kind of bumbling around. On to the story.

My first day of high school, and the dress incident.

Our cast!

V. That's me! At the time I was a 14 year old girl just trying to figure out where I could fit in. I wore lots of black and spoke with a forcefully clipped drawl in my voice that led me to speak slowly and precisely. Long dark blond hair, and standing at around 5 ft 2in.

Loli. A legbeard junior who I had been friends with for a couple of years. Super obsessed with Lolita fashion and anime. Would-be-Weeb. Overweight with super long dark brown hair, about 5ft 4in, but insisted she was 4ft 11im and skinny.

Scout. A senior who's eye I somehow managed to catch and a neckbeard. I ended up dating him for most of my freshman year. Skinny, short dude with long hair who was obsessed with Team Fortress 2.

The Group. A group of anime nerds who made up the entirety of the schools anime club. I don't remember all of them, but I remember really wanting to fit in with them. I'll probably refer to the people as Boy1/Girl2 since they don't really stick out much in memory.

Thor. A friend of mine who fit in immediately with a different social group, so we mainly just IMed each other outside of school and made small talk when we saw each other. Baby health nut and gym bro. Still my friend today. Blond hair, 5ft 8in, healthy build. Very cute. I'll admit I had a crush on him for a very long time (like 7th grade until sophmore year), but did my best not to make it weird.

Our setting.

My high school in south eastern Texas, not too far from where I reside today.

On to the story since you're probably wanting me to get on with it.

Picture it! Texas, August of 2009 (bonus points if you read that like Sophia from Golden Girls)

I woke up that morning feeling both nervous and excited. Getting dressed in my finest Hot Topic clearance rack mall goth top, dark washed jeans and a pair of combat boots I found in good shape at a thrift store. I attempted to do a bit of makeup, poking myself in the eye because I still hadn't really learned the magic of eyeliner yet. After having a cup of coffee, a habit I had formed that summer when I started getting up early to go work, and telling my mom and her boyfriend bye, I grabbed my bag and biked to school. I had spent all summer working odd jobs for family friends to save up enough cash to buy a new bike, and I rode that thing everywhere my overbearing mother would let me. I had started working before it was legal because my mom's boyfriend had convinced her that if she bought me stuff, I'd be ungrateful and expect her to always buy me stuff.

Getting to school I saw a lot of new and a few familiar faces. Thor stopped for a minute to chit chat as we were both early. His dad always dropped him off early, so I could usually find him hanging around the benches by the front of the school, even in middle school. I managed to flag him down as I rode up.

Thor: Nice bike. Let me guess, it's black like your soul?

V: Nah. The other color they had was this weird pastel baby puke green.

Thor: Gotcha. So, you gonna try and expand your horizons, or just stick to yourself?

I had been a bit of a loner in middle school. I didn't really have a clique I fit in with, but I was acquainted with a lot of different people. Thor was really one of the few I consistently talked to, even if it was mainly over Facebook IMs. I didn't know at the time, but I was dealing with undiagnosed social anxiety and had an introverted personality. I responded to his question with a shrug as I locked up my bike.

V: I know pretty much everyone we went to middle school with is here, but I'm taking the ""See what happens"" approach.

As we made our way into the practically empty cafeteria where everyone who was early tended to congregate, we said our ""see ya later""s and I started to meander around until Loli saw me. With a loud squee, she ran over to me and immediately hugged me. She and I had met in middle school, when I was in 6th grade, and she was in 8th. We had hung out a little (and by that, I mean she would show up at my house and kinda hold me hostage when she was bored) and she had introduced me to a few different shojo style anime. Basically, anime marketed to women. They were...ok I guess.

Loli: Hey! OMG, you have to come meet the rest of The Group. They're all in the anime club and it's so sugoi.

V: Um...ok.

So, she basically drags me over and introduces me to everyone.  I give kind of an awkward smile and say hello, then try to engage in conversation with a couple of the girls. One of them outright ignored me, while the others and I talked about music. When I mentioned I had spent the summer doing odd jobs for family friends and how my MP3 player had helped keep me sane, they looked at me like I had 3 heads. See, this was an upper middle class area so most kids didn't have to work, but my family had clawed it's way to lower middle class with a lovely view of the poverty line. I grew up learning how to work on cars, fix things, be generally handy, and had turned these skills into ways to make money. The biggest way I did this was by detailing cars, and doing small jobs like oil changes and a couple of handyman jobs for one of my elderly neighbors because the maintenance crew in our apartment complex sucked. Small stuff like hanging pictures, recaulking the bathtub, and unclogging the toilet. She saw me working on some stuff for my mom, and asked for help. After that, she would come and ask me to help her. I never set a price for her, but there was usually a $20 bill placed firmly in my hand, or she would slip it into my tool bag for me to find later.

During this exchange, I noticed Scout staring at me from another table, holding some cards in his hand that I couldn't see, and what looked like a deck next to it.

V: Who's that?

I asked, pointing at him

Girl1: That's Scout. He's a senior and the president of the anime club. Kind of a weirdo, but he's nice. I think Loli dated him for a while, but they broke up. You have to join the club if you want to hang out with us though. We're all in it.

I was a bit of an anime fan. I had seen a bunch of different ones, and had my favorites. I gave a noncommittal ""Ok"" as the bell rang. I made my way to my assigned home room, which was where we were given our planners, schedules and the teacher went over the basics of schedule time and explained block schedules to those who hadn't had that in their previous school. 

The rest of the day went fairly uneventful. I had History with Thor, and a few other classes with known acquaintances. At lunch, as I once again meandered around with my tray of cardboard that thought it was food. Once again I was flagged down by Loli.

I went over and sat with The Group, eating quietly while they all chattered back and forth. I looked and noticed Scout staring at me again. This time he looked away. Weird but ok I guess. I just kind of sat there, not really engaging beyond the occasional yes or no response. Due to my home life with my mom's boyfriend, I had adapted a ""Don't speak unless directly spoken to"" mentality unless I felt really up for it, but because I had to interact in my classes all morning, the in-person social battery was running low. Loli kind of tried to include me when talking about Lolita fashion, since she knew I could sew and liked the level of detail in those styles. And promptly shoved a picture in my face. I don't mean showed it to me. She literally shoved this book or magazine or whatever it was into my face. If I hadn't back away, she would have nailed me in the nose with it.

Loli: Do you think you could make something like that?

V: (After recovering from the 'oh shit' moment and pulling my face back to get a good look at the picture in question) Maybe if I had a pattern to work with. The ruffles would probably give me a hard time, but the fabric would cost a fortune if you want something in that material. It looks like a brocade of some kind, and that gets expensive.

Loli: But you'd make it for me, right?

V: This would take me months to do, between school and everything. I'd have to get your measurements and probably modify a similar pattern (More sewing jargon. I'll skip it because it is kinda boring)

Loli: But you can make it as my Christmas gift! It would be so awesome. Maybe even the headpiece too. That bow is sooo kawaii.

V: I can't afford to.

At the prospect of being told no, she threw a small fit. I backed away a little due to the sudden volume change and because I used to be very non-confrontational. At this, Scout decided to voice his opinion.

Scout: Shut up you land whale. She said no. Stop begging for freebies.

Loli: Fuck you! If she was my real friend she'd make it for me. Right V?

I probably looked like a deer in the headlights of a Peterbuilt as it came barreling down the highway, milliseconds before impact. I didn't have many friends at the time. I never have had a lot of friends, but at 14 I was kind of easy to manipulate with friendship. I felt my anxiety levels rising as I tried to find the words.

V: Um... I can't. It's beyond my skill level, and I don't have a pattern to work with. Plus the fabric would cost you a lot of money.

At the mention of her paying for anything, she freaked out at me again. She was a spoiled girl who leeched off of people that pitied her. She used to try and come over just to raid the fridge and pantry. I got in trouble a lot because she would always go for my mom's boyfriends snacks that I wasn't allowed to touch.

Boy1: Loli, she said no. Leave her alone. You're freaking her out. Plus, why should she pay for your dress? Come on. She's clearly not cool with this.

Scout: Plus it's pathetic for you to beg like that. Hey, I think it's cool you know how to sew. I'm Scout. You're V, right?

I nodded and he began talking to me about something I had never really heard of before. Cosplay. After explaining the basic concept to me, given the apparently blank confusion on my face, he mentioned how awesome it would be to dress up as the Scout from TF2. He then went on about how playing the Scout was the best way to play TF2. He then had to explain what TF2 was to me, as I was more a book and movie kind of nerd than a videogame nerd, and only had an old PS2 with a few racing games and Guitar Hero. I was polite and when I found a chance to leave, I took it. I had had enough of that drama for the time being, and needed to get away from people before I lost my mind.

I threw my tray out and decided I'd make my way to my next class early. There was only like 5 minutes left in the lunch break anyway so I left. But the entire time I was walking away, I felt a set of eyes boring into my back. Or rather, my backside.

The rest of the day was uneventful and when the final bell rang, I made a beeline out of the building to get home and enjoy some solitude before my mom and her boyfriend came home. I spent time setting up my binders and notebooks, going over the day in my head. Organizing my stuff would help me feel like I had a bit of control, and thus helped me calm down. When I heard my laptop ding with a message, I noticed Thor had IMed me. We chatted back and forth about our days, and I noticed a couple of friend requests from people in The Group, including Scout. I decided to just leave it pending and continue chatting with Thor before we both had to get off and go eat. The rest of that night is lost to time however.

Well, that's our introduction to the first beards I can recall dealing with. I do eventually get comfortable with some of these people, but dealing with people has always been hard on me. I'll give some more background on my mom and her boyfriend later on when it feels relevant. I plan on telling a lot more stories, just not 100% sure of when I'll get them written due to the fog of my memory, head traumas, alcohol, illicit substances, and the fact that I have a junk memory already.",1,1728402772.0,ReddXReads,0,1.0,False

But take this as a good reason to actually check your reactions to the sweeteners and other small things low fodmap says to avoid. It really can be those

I recently found out I'm sensitive to sucralose (brand name splenda). Then I already knew im sensitive to corn (corn syrup is most common sweetener here and corn is a common additive). As well as other sensitivities like dairy and certain veggies

I was having a lot of artificial sweeteners because I can't have the corn. So diet sodas, sparkling waters, the occasional sugar free energy drinks, water flavoring. But after finding out I cant have the sucralose I checked all those things. And they ALL had it!

So not only do I now have to shop even more carefully because between the two they're in breads, processed meats, microwave foods, basically anything that's not whole unprepared foods.

But I also can't have the foods and drinks I've been having for years! The change is so frustrating and upsetting.

Bright side, I found some drinks/ drink powders in my local hispanic market that are sugar based instead of corn syrup or sweeteners. The prices aren't great but it was nice to get some options cause plain water just doesn't work for me. I also got some instant coffee and dairy free only sugar creamer. Don't love coffee but at least its caffiene

because you were my cool guy, my ‘thank you, reddit’, My Favorite. we were so good together! just this morning, i was so happy to doll myself up a little to come see you after almost two weeks. i was so excited to see you! i enjoyed lunch and coffee. i loved our conversations. thank you for making the time to hang out and run errands with me.

it’s just too bad that our long-term plans don’t align. we just cannot seem to find a compromise. we’ve known this for a while, we’ve tried to ignore it, and it felt like living on borrowed time. i know you know how upset i am. i had to break my own heart because you were too polite to do it.

rationally, i know that letting you go is the right thing to do. we can’t build a life together when the circumstances of our lives diverge so drastically. we can’t spend the rest of our time together with the elephant in the room. we each have our own responsibilities and priorities. if we'd persisted without using our brains, i'd be constantly fearing for the day we'd grow to resent the other because we wouldn’t budge on our non-negotiables (and those are there for a reason!).

we have decided on this split together! and yet.

and yet, i yearn for you like a missing limb. our last date today—the last little <3 i have on my calendar. i really do wish we could’ve gone on a furniture shop date where we were picking out things for our place, instead of desperately holding hands and pretending as though it wasn’t the last time we’d be seeing each other.

i’ll miss holding your hand, and the way you smell, and the way you laugh/shoosh at me when i pretend to chime in with strangers’ conversations. i’ll miss kissing your cute squishy face (i wish i'd been brave enough for more), and the way your eyes crinkle when you smile, the way you always pull out my chair and get water for us. you were always so good to me. i hope you’ll think of me when you think of taylor swift and when wicked finally shows in november.

right now, i've got ""catastrophic blues, moving on was always easy for me to do, it hits different, it hits different 'cause it's you"" and ""so much of me is made of what i've learned from you, you'll be with me like a handprint in my heart"" rattling in my little noggin. my head hurts so bad from all the crying and dehydration lol. (i will take care of myself, i promise.)

you’re a good man. you’re smart and capable and i know you’ll go places. you have so much empathy for people and for animals. i’ll think of you whenever i see cow cat at the station! life in manila (especially when you’re only staying here for work) isn’t easy, but i hope you’ll find a groove of rest/work/play that works for you. please don't forget to work on your dynamic stretches and mobility exercises at the gym. :')

i appreciate you for listening to me when i bring up hard stuff, and actually making the behavioral changes that help you show up for me. i hope i was able to show up for you in ways you needed, too. it wasn’t always easy, but i’m so, so grateful to have known you, to have grown with you in the short time we were dating, to know that there are people who are good, and who are capable of caring for me and showing up for me in ways i need. because of you, i don’t think i can settle for less than someone kind and competent and humble. i wish we could remain friends, but i don’t think i’ll be able to stop seeing you as a romantic prospect for a while. i really truly wish you the best.

i’m hurting so much rn, it’s excruciating. it feels like i’m being ripped apart at the seams. i guess i’ve never gotten my heart broken this badly before, and i’ve thus underestimated why so many artists have written and sung and made films about coping with the grief and loss that comes with it.

i know that time would heal most things, but for now, picturing you in love with someone else really does want to make me throw up on the street. :’(",3,1728402167.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False

Perhaps that milestone has come and gone, and you still wake up alone. It’s good to have priorities, but there’s a reason why *you're still single and stuck on the sidelines while other guys are getting married and building families.*

**Here’s the hard truth that no one tells you:**

*Meeting someone new and build attraction* is not about waiting for some “right moment” when life will magically align and a girl will show up to get you. **It’s about you evolving into the best version of yourself on a daily basis** — the 2.0 version — by growing 1% every day, *without losing what makes you, you.*

**It’s literally impossible to attract a woman without changing your mindset**

You see people who are less successful than you, less “put-together,” walking down with their dream partner while you can’t even get past “hello” without feeling awkward. You’re frustrated because you know you’ve achieved so much, and yet when it comes to dating, it feels like you’re constantly being overlooked.

Here’s the thing: **it’s not your fault.**

You’ve been led to believe that women only care about the “bad boys” and that talking to a woman you don’t know in 2024 is socially unacceptable. *You’ve been convinced that the dating market is against you, that online dating is the only option, and that it’s just a gamble, out of your control.*

But what if I told you **that’s all wrong?**

**It’s time for a reality check.**

You know, for 90% of men, women won’t just fall into their lap. Sure, they might give signals — eye contact, proximity, small gestures — but they’re not going to do the work for you. It’s time to accept that **you need to be the one who takes the first step,** not by pretending to be someone you’re not, but by removing the barriers you’ve built up.

**“I don’t know when and how to make a move”**

I know you’re smart. I know your mind races through possibilities, analyzing every potential outcome. But here’s where that gets in the way: *You end up waiting for the perfect moment — a moment that rarely comes.* And when it does, we’re talking about something between 10 to 20 seconds. The real problem is not about the “when” or the “how”, is that you’ve already talked yourself out of it because you're afraid of rejection, of looking stupid, or worse — of bothering her.

Here’s what you need to know: **focus on the why.**

Women are attracted to **the feelings** you can generate in them. It’s not about *what you say* — it’s about how you make them feel when you say it. And yes, even as an analytical, logical thinker, you can create those feelings. **You can control the outcome.**

**So, how do you actually get results?**

That’s where my approach comes in — specifically for guys in tech. **You don’t have to kill your logical, analytical side.** You don’t need to act like a “bad boy” or change your personality. I have a great news for you: your unique way of thinking is an asset. *But you need to evolve.*

* **Understand female psychology.** Attraction isn’t random. It’s based on principles.
* **Stop overthinking and start taking action.** Yes, that means stepping up even when it feels uncomfortable, even when you’re not 100% sure or ready.
* **Start small, but build momentum.** One of my clients went from spending all his time working from home to striking up a conversation with a woman at a coffee shop within just 12 weeks. It’s not a quick process, after you’ve spent most of your life socially isolated. *But that’s the kind of transformation that can happen when you stop going it alone and get the right guidance.*

**You will look in the mirror with no regrets**

If you keep doing what you’re doing, nothing is going to change. Einstein said, *“Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.”*

**You need to stop putting this off and take responsibility for what is gonna happen in the future.** You did it for your career, now it’s time to do the same for your love life. You’re running out of time, and if you don’t take action, you’ll miss out on the kind of deep, meaningful relationships you secretly crave.

But the most important thing is this: **You must not solve this problem alone.**

I’ve helped engineers and tech professionals like you break through their limiting beliefs, understand the emotional side of attraction, and start getting real results. Also by standing by theirs side not only online, but in person, around Europe, North America and Australia.

I want to work with you on this goal that you have, together, as a team. It always feels like helping my old self, and this feeling is addictive for me. The journey is not about changing who you are — it’s about evolving into the best version of yourself and finally getting the relationship you’ve been waiting for too long.

If you’re tired of waking up alone, tired of seeing other guys “get lucky,” and tired of waiting for the right moment, **DM me**. I don’t believe in luck. I believe in systems, proven methods, and the power of momentum. Let’s start building the life you want, together.

1fz2lwc,https://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsofCards/comments/1fz2lwc/request_very_lonely_birthday_girl_struggling_with/,[Request] very lonely birthday girl struggling with loss seeking kind birthday cards [US],"Hey guys. 

If someone had told me this time 10 years ago that I would eventually end up so lonely and alone that I'd be asking kind strangers on the internet to send me birthday cards, I'd have either laughed in disbelief or-more likely-teared up a bit from sadness the way I am right now.

But, here I am. It's been a tough few years. 

My birthdays used to be spent with my best friend, the amazing man who helped raise me, and eventually the love of my life as well. I miss those moments so badly right now. Unfortunately, between Covid happening a few years back and then my father figure developing [redacted] last spring, all three of them are no longer here with me. It's hard. It really is. And especially around my birthday it's also incredibly lonely. I was always a little too shy and introverted to make a ton of friends as an adult outside of those three, and so now it's just me and the pets. There's no one to celebrate with now. It's hard to think about. 

I used to **love** birthdays. I'd go all out baking cakes and hanging funny birthday signs and buying those silly pointed hats for the people I love. With every birthday card I made or bought, I'd always find a sweet or encouraging quote from a favorite author or poet to write at the bottom of each card. Eventually that became a bit of a tradition and all three of us would always include some sort of loving or supportive quote from a poem or book we loved in the birthday cards we would give one another. 

Out of everything, the cake and hats and all the trimmings, I loved the cards I was given on my birthday the most because of that little personal touch. I kept them for years until losing the box I kept them in during a recent move. My heart breaks just thinking about it. Those cards kept me connected to the people I've lost. I wish I still had them so badly. 

Right now, I live and rent from extended family, and while they aren't outright unkind for the most part, they always make it pretty obvious that they're indifferent to my existence. They've never been the nicest, though I try to be kind and cordial to them regardless. But it's lonely. It really is. Especially around birthdays and holidays. 

Sorry, I'm rambling a little. My birthday is this month. I know that much like last year, I'm probably going to be spending it by myself. I keep telling myself I'm an adult and to grow up and stop getting depressed over things like being alone on birthdays or holidays, but it's still hard. Especially around my birthday. I always loved the little parties, the togetherness, the funny gifts, the silliness when the people I love were still in my life. My best friend and my partner would always buy me squishmallow stuffed animals, in whatever color or shape they could find, and it would always make me laugh. Dad on the other hand would always get me comfy slippers and funny coffee mugs with bizzare quotes or sayings. But the cards were always my favorite part. They really were. 

Over the years when we were all still together, the three of them would always find me the most colorful, sweet, silly, poignant, bizarre, loving cards they could find. Complete with their little quotes at the bottom. 

I miss that the most, those cards. I miss that so much. I won't lie, when I found this sub and realized what it was for, my stomach jumped a little. Last year, spending my birthday alone, without anyone to spend it with, it was hard. I bought myself a cupcake and a candle and hung out with my animals, but I couldn't shake off the loneliness. I know this year will be similar, and it makes my heart ache to remember what birthdays used to be like with the people I was so close with. 

I feel a little sad and a *lot* pathetic asking, but I'd love it if any kind strangers would be wiling to send me a birthday card this year. It would mean the world to me, it really would. You have no idea how much it would mean. 

If you want, you can send me a chat and I'll give you my mailing address. And thank you for reading what turned out to be a small book. I hope you all have a lovely day.

I love Halloween and witchy stuff, guinea pigs (oddly specific, I know lol-I have a few rescue pigs) anything with a sense of humor. But I'm really not picky at all, anything sent would be wonderful and I'll love it to pieces regardless of what it is. ♥]

I asked him the same and he said he Used to be married. I did not press the topic because who likes talking about their divorce/separation? 

We met a few more times over next couple of weeks (he approached me every time) and he asked for my insta. When we connected there, I saw that he is married with a 6-8 year old daughter!! It was gross, the lie and misrepresentation! When confronted, he said arey but I told you na I'm married... What. A. Creep! I said we could have just been platonic friends why lie about your relationship status? I cut contact and blocked him. 

Cut to this evening: I went for a walk this evening after weeks (bout of ill-health kept me away). He'd promised he wouldn't contact me in the park if he saw me again. To his credit, when he saw me today, he kept his distance. BUT. I saw him chatting/walking with another pretty woman who is definitely not his wife!! I fear I may have emboldened him to approach women and talk to them. So I do feel a wee bit responsible.

What truly goes into a single cup of coffee? The drink you pour into your mug is the end result of a long process—a process often discussed but rarely seen from beginning to end. 

Leticia and Harry Hutchins wanted to go beyond the cup with their roastery, [Alma Coffee](https://myalmacoffee.com/). Based in Canton, Georgia, Alma pulls in the experiences and insights from generations of coffee producers and connects the work and care done on Leticia’s family farms to the coffee being roasted and served in their cafe.  

https://preview.redd.it/y4ml7fu4wjtd1.png?width=819&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ab32ef14f135de2385d01de387d17a47612f819

“Truly, from farm to cup, our family touches every step of the process, controls every single aspect of it,” says Leticia, who believes that offering a comprehensive coffee experience and bringing customers in on the journey makes Alma’s coffee truly unique. “Quality is our number one.” 

# Every Step of The Process

Leticia’s family has grown coffee and operated coffee farms in Honduras for five generations. But the story of Alma starts in Chicago, where Leticia and Harry were living. Both accountants, the duo began building out a career pivot in 2018 and came up with a plan: to move to Georgia to start a roasting company and bring their family’s coffee directly to consumers for the first time. 

“We went from concept to execution in under a year,” Leticia says. By April 2018, the pair had quit their jobs. “We were on a flight to the SCA \[Expo that April\] and were willing to learn literally anything we could,” says Leticia. “We had read books, we had googled stuff, but we hadn’t worked in a roastery or operated a machine before, so it was all really new.”

Later that month, they moved to Georgia and began searching for a location for their roastery. “In July, we launched our e-commerce business and focused on local pop ups, such as farmers markets, to spread the word about our brand,” says Leticia. “By December, we closed on our current location.”

https://preview.redd.it/ztt1eg96wjtd1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8c7cc846b0a7d0576ae441a0d9ec2a0becba6bb

As they built Alma, Leticia says they relied heavily on a set of values that both shape the roasting operation and choices on the farm. “Any decision we make, anything we are looking to do, we always come back to \[our\] three pillars: improving lives, sustainable practices, extraordinary coffee,” she says. 

One of the ways they focus on the first pillar—improving lives—is by investing in education on their farms. Recently, Alma built a school for the children of coffee workers in Honduras. “During harvest season, we will have 250 families move onto the farm with us,” says Leticia. “When a family moves, they bring their kids and it’s like, ‘What do the kids do?’” The school is free for all the children of workers who come to the farm for harvest.  

Alma extends its mission to improve lives through a program they call Alma-doptions. They will take on the harvest of a coffee farm run by people they know and pledge to either roast it themselves or sell it to other like-minded coffee roasters committed to ethical sourcing practices. “We make sure it gets a good home,” says Leticia, “\[and\] make sure that they are paid upfront unlike having to wait and do a sort of consignment system.”

On the roastery side, improving lives looks like investing in culture. “We want everyone to have fun where they work and be able to work hard and see the results of that.” Alma offers benefits to its employees, such as a paid trip to their farm in Honduras after two years of employment and other opportunities to travel. Leticia says these opportunities allow their employees “to see that there’s more to coffee than just what happens in our roastery because it can be really easy to get caught up in what you’re doing every single day.”

# Fast Facts

Roastery Location: Canton, Georgia

Square Footage: 4,500 square feet with 3500 square feet of office/quiet seating space

Retail and/or Wholesale Roasting: Retail and wholesale

# Keeping it Green

Alma’s second pillar is sustainability, so it’s no surprise that eco-friendly practices are a high priority. Leticia says that choosing a Loring was an obvious choice for the roastery because “they’re super efficient and put out fewer emissions than other roasters.” 

https://preview.redd.it/5jq75xp7wjtd1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b650a14942c00a72cf4cdb23930248d6db8563f

The roasting team started with a Loring S15 Falcon (capable of roasting 15 kilograms at a time) in 2018 and acquired a larger S35 Kestrel as the business grew. Among all the roasters on the market, Leticia says that they chose a Loring because it aligned with their sustainability initiatives.

Alma also uses 100% recyclable mailers for online orders wherever possible. The roastery’s eco-friendly mission extends to the farm: their farm is a USDA certified organic and they use runoff from the coffee washing station as an organic pesticide. 

# Transparency Flows

Alma’s coffee shop lives inside its roasting space instead of being two separate spaces. “Originally, we didn’t open a coffee shop,” says Leticia, who says people enjoy sipping on their coffee as they watch the roasting process. “We have our regulars, and they just love to come and watch us work.”

Leticia says the fact that the roastery is visible from the cafe is a conversation starter with customers. “Because usually, \[customers will\] come in and point at the weigh-fills and be like, ‘Oh my gosh, are those the roasters?’ Instantly, we can be like actually, those are weigh fills, and \[we can explain\] how they work, and we can point out the roasters and talk about how they work, so we love that because it’s a way that we can have an education touch point without coming off snooty or like a know-it-all.”

https://preview.redd.it/c0mnmde9wjtd1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9fc61457c96097eec2bfe68e8eff90786cc5bd8

Many of the design and equipment choices Alma made support the idea of transparency and encourage free flowing conversations between the roastery, baristas, and customers. 

*Packed to Order:* When customers walk into Alma’s cafe and roastery space, they will notice there are no coffee bags on the shelves. Keeping in line with Alma’s views on transparency and freshness, every bag of coffee is packed to order. Not only is this to ensure folks are getting freshly roasted coffee but it is also a way to share the roasting and packaging process with the customer. 

Customers can watch their coffee get bagged, ground (by request), sealed, and handed to them. “If you aren’t in this coffee industry, you wonder what \[that process\] looks like,” Leticia says. “How do these bags get filled? It’s really cool to see it go from the roaster to you.”

*Training and QC Lab:* The backbone of every roastery (especially ones that do wholesale business) is the training and QC lab. At Alma, this is where a lot of the action happens, from cuppings to training—the team even uses the space to make syrups for the cafe. 

The lab is equipped with two espresso machines, a Slayer and a small La Marzocco, and supplies for pour overs and making cold brew. “We are very loyal to Mahlkonig for all our grinders but,” Leticia says about what equipment they carry in the lab, “in terms of brewing equipment, we go off relationships we have formed throughout the years with individuals at SCA and other coffee events.”

*Weigh Fills:* “\[Weigh fills are\] something that we got two years ago, and before that, we were hand-filling everything,” Leticia says. Weigh fills help the Alma team bag coffee quickly without having to stop to weigh everything manually.  “\[The weigh fills\] have been a huge help in terms of efficiency and posture for our employees. I mean, when you’re bending down, it’s not going to feel good after an eight-hour shift.”

*KDS System*: A Kitchen Display Screen system is not often found in a roastery, but at Alma, it helps keep track of orders for coffee bags and refills. “The KDS allows different teams to see exactly what they need to do to take care of that customer in a timely fashion.” 

When a customer comes into Alma to order coffee beans (since there are no retail bags on the shelf), they pick from the current coffee offerings and get rung up at the register. The coffee order will pop up on the KDS and the production staff will make that bag or refill the customer’s reusable canister. “It’s going to be like 3-5 minutes, but it helps our fulfillment team say, ‘Hey, we have a fresh bag coming up.’”

*Keep It Cool:* Having a cafe inside a roastery means the folks at Alma have to think about climate control. Temperatures in Georgia during the summer can be high, and the humidity can impact roasting, so the space is climate-controlled with air conditioning splits throughout to keep the temperature as regulated as possible. 

*Quiet Space:* Coffee roasting is noisy, which can be tough for customers trying to quietly enjoy a cup of coffee in the cafe part of Alma’s space. “I will say the noise level can get a little high sometimes,” says Leticia. But Alma has a quiet space away from the noise for patrons to enjoy coffee.

“If you just want to read a book, get some work done, have a zoom call, whatever it is, then you can go in that quieter space. We also have a great outdoor space: a huge patio in front of our office space with Adirondack chairs and fire pits.”

# All For Extraordinary Coffee

The last pillar Alma built its values around is excellent coffee, and every team decision is in service of that goal. With so many moving parts, keeping on top of everything happening within the roastery can be challenging, but Leticia says it all comes back to adhering to the brand’s values. “If we’re hitting those goals, we know we’re on the right track.”",1,1728401332.0,coffee_roasters,0,1.0,False

Max, who was two years ahead of me in college, caught my eye during freshman orientation and it was love at first sight.
Clad in a white shirt and black casual pants, Max stood tall at six feet, boasting a lean and beautiful physique reminiscent of a masterpiece crafted by skilled sculptors. Emerging from beneath the lush camphor trees along the campus path, he waved and smiled, with the bright sunlight casting a dappled glow upon him, his eyes sparkling.
It was impossible not to be captivated.
Once we began dating, I learned that Max was enrolled in the Business School, while I pursued studies in the School of Foreign Languages. On the day we met, he mistook me for a Business School freshman and kindly carried my luggage all the way to my dorm.
It was only upon reaching the entrance to my dorm building that he realized I belonged to a different department. However, driven by his love at first sight, he boldly continued with his mistake.
He confessed to me that from the moment he laid eyes on me, he knew that if he let me walk away, he would regret it for the rest of his life.
When Max Jennings pursued me, he displayed both proactivity and romance. In the winter, I had a tendency to sleep in late. To ensure that I could enjoy a cup of hot coffee from the cafeteria, Max would purchase one early in the morning, keep it warm inside his jacket, and patiently wait beneath my dormitory until I slowly made my way downstairs. By the time I drank it, the coffee was still warm.
Whenever we went hiking, Max would pack a bag filled with snacks, fruit, and two flasks - one with cold water and the other with hot water. He ensured that regardless of whether I desired a cold or hot drink, he could instantly provide it. I felt like a pampered princess, and he promised a lifetime of gentle companionship and attentive care.
There are numerous examples of his thoughtfulness and devotion.
Even after we got together, Max's thoughtfulness and devotion never wavered.
Max came from a humble rural background. His father passed away early, leaving him with three older sisters who were all married with children. Raised by his mother under challenging circumstances, he grew up in a financially struggling household.
He once shared with me, ""Jen, you probably can't imagine what it's like to fear that your house might be blown away during a storm, right? Having grown up in hardship, I've learned to truly cherish my loved ones and to respect my parents and elders.""
A wise man once said, ""People who grow up in hardship often develop psychological shadows that can lead to abnormal behaviors. These issues manifest as a persistent hostility towards society and people, an inability to trust anyone, and a lack of sympathy. Being overly frugal or excessively focused on money is just a minor symptom of these deeper psychological issues. In contrast, those who are broad-minded and insightful, despite growing up under difficult circumstances, tend to be more compassionate and generous. They understand life and appreciate its sweet and bitter aspects.""
At that time, I believed Max was the latter; I felt proud of him.
During the summer of his second year in grad school, Max took on a job wearing a heavy mascot costume in the plaza to distribute flyers, all to buy me a necklace for my birthday. Despite the intense heat, when I brought him lunch, he was soaked with sweat but still insisted to me that he wasn't hot at all.
He said, ""Jen, even though I can't afford expensive gifts right now, believe me, I will work hard to give you a better life.""
He proposed to me, vowing that we would stay together forever.
That day, I brought him home for dinner to tell my parents that we were getting married and to seek their blessing.
It was Max's first time meeting my parents.
At the dinner table, Max appeared slightly tense. Despite normally exuding confidence and being outgoing as the head of the student council, that evening marked the first time I had seen him nervous.
Quietly, he led me out onto the balcony and asked with a touch of apprehension in his voice, ""Jen, why didn't you tell me that your dad is the dean of our business school?""
I wrapped my arms around his waist and playfully asked, ""Would you still pursue me if you knew my dad holds a prominent position here?""
Max's expression turned serious as he replied, ""Absolutely! I like you for who you are, not because of your father's status!""
Nestling into his embrace, I felt content and said, ""Well, that settles it. It doesn't matter who my dad is as long as we're together.""
Later, after Max had left, my dad called me into his study for a heart-to-heart conversation.
He advised me to deeply consider marrying Max. Our families were not on equal footing, and marriage is a serious matter that requires careful thought.
Initially, I thought my dad was solely fixated on Max's background and family situation. I even accused him of being old-fashioned and clinging to outdated notions of social status.
But my dad shook his head and said, ""Jen, marriage should not be based solely on impulsive feelings. Do you truly know the man you plan to spend your life with?""
My parents cautioned me against rushing into marriage and suggested waiting until after I completed graduate school. At that time, I had just been accepted into a postgraduate program and was mindful of the heavy workload ahead, so I agreed with Max to postpone our plans until after graduation.
Max was incredibly intelligent. He understood that my parents would not approve of our relationship. Holding me tightly, he said, ""Jen, I will need some time to prove to your parents that I deserve their trust for a lifetime.""
However, tragedy struck the following summer. My parents were involved in a car accident and passed away before I had the chance to say goodbye.
During those days, I was overwhelmed with grief, and tears were constantly streaming down my face.
Max was always there for me, holding me close and reassuring me, saying, ""Jen, please don't cry. You are not alone. I am here for you, through thick and thin.""
Three months later, Max and I got married.
We did not have a lavish wedding, as the pain of our loss was still fresh. Instead, we knelt before my parents' graves.
Max humbly bowed his head in front of their resting place and promised to be by my side for the rest of our lives.
However, even the most solemn promises can be broken over time.
Just in our second year of marriage, he strayed.
To make matters worse, it happened while I was pregnant with our child.

I had a really bad day where all day I just had so much anxiety that my heart was racing and skipping beats and I was unsure if I was having a panic attack or a heart attack, So, I just gave up caffeine,

Heart palapatations stopped and though I had a headache for a couple days, I've felt very good. I'm sleepy a lot but that's okay.

What's most shocking to me-- and it's truly shocking--I feel like I felt in my twenties -- I'm 52 now and I realize I've been having caffeine in general since I was a young kid. (My grandfather ALWAYS kept a supply of Pepsi and I had multiple everyday, When I was in my 20s I had coffee occasionally. It wasn't until I was in my 30s that coffee became an everyday event and not until I got in the job I am in now (Started three years ago) that I've found my anxiety growing along with this rushed feeling of being not in control of my life..

My father was bipolar and so I have always been very vigilant about my mental health. So as years passed and my anxiety grew, it was really alarming to me how my mind just always seemed to catastrophize and worry constantly. After about three days with no caffeine-- I felt so serene. It's incredible.

I noticed a weird oily smell and after rinsing and cleaning the lid of the pot and the bottom now look like the photo.

Fortunately this is not what this post is about.

Suppose J K Rowling had been fervently in favour of trans people, as focussed as she currently is on the issues that concern her.  Or something else, any social issue in fact, or even a non-social issue such as whether tea or coffee was better.  And that she posted on this matter on Twitter as much as she does on this issue.  It would not be a sign of a balanced personality.  The central issue is that she has an overvalued idea, regardless of what that idea is, and that's not good.

It wouldn't be fair for me to consider the causes of her behaviour, but I can easily imagine that someone in a formerly abusive relationship could end up fixating in this manner.  As such, she deserves empathy, leeway and sympathy.  

I deleted my account as soon as Elon Musk took over, so I don't have first-hand information regarding what she's done on Twitter and maybe my perception is distorted.  Maybe what I hear is unfair.  If it is accurate, though, I honestly believe she has a mental health issue of some kind.  Overvalued ideas are, I think, a more important feature of mental illness than delusions, illusions or their content.

So, if my information is accurate, she's got a problem for which she will, I hope access therapy, and we should not pay attention to the content of her contributions but their frequency and degree of focus, and we should recognise that as a person with mental health issues she is in a marginalised group, and that's how we should frame her behaviour, not as a transphobe or a supporter of women's rights.

During that time, he was really mean to our mom, blamed her for everything, and reconnected with our biological dad. Now, he's very close to him.

**Leaf has always stayed neutral in family conflicts.** He's focused on his own life and hasn't gotten involved in our problems.

**You're probably wondering why my relationship with my biological dad isn't good.** For the past 12 years, we've had a lot of problems, including psychological and physical abuse, threats, and blackmail. I was the only one who went through this.

**After Dax broke up with his ex, he met his wife and they moved to Vermont.** They recently moved back to Massachusetts to be closer to family. Dax often asks my mom to watch his kids while he works or his wife travels. Even though my mom is tired, she always helps because she loves her grandchildren. She also helps Leaf's kids.

**The other day, I met with Dax for coffee to talk about my move to Switzerland.** We started talking about our biological dad, and he got mad when I called him ""biological dad."" I tried to explain that he hasn't been a father figure to me in 12 years, but he said it was my fault that our relationship is broken. He blamed my mom for controlling me and affecting my relationship with my biological dad, even though she encouraged me to try.

**I don't understand why my brothers have such a strong dislike for my mom.** She's been there for them, raised them, and done everything for them. They praise our biological dad and dismiss my trauma and my mom's trauma. They still expect her to help them with their kids, but they treat her badly. I told my mom she needs to stop letting them take advantage of her.

**I'm sorry for ranting, but I'm wondering why my brothers would treat my mom so badly.** They blame me for not having a good relationship with my biological dad, even though he was the adult in the situation. Why?",1,1728400568.0,family,1,1.0,False

We flew Sydney to Cairns on Virgin Australia. Apparently I didn't buy the right type of ticket based on my luggage, but nobody seemed to care, and the trip to Cairns was uneventful.

On the return, the gate agents had a different view, and tried to charge $75/checked bag. I was very polite (I'm Canadian after all), but I asked what happened, why the bags were free on the way up and now there's a charge. They just told me I bought a ticket with no checked bags. Then out of nowhere the gate agent said ""well, you could just leave your bags in Cairns then."" Canadian and US airport employees can be rude, but if somebody said this, they'd end up on the local news.

I was shocked and told her I couldn't believe she'd said that. The agent didn't seem to think she was being rude. Nor did her colleagues or manager who were nearby. One of them said something to the effect of I needed to read the T&Cs. I said I'd pay it, but would dispute it on my credit card when I get home, so I don't think Virgin will end up getting the money anyways. They were unmoved. (I disputed it, my credit card company called Virgin customer service, and whoever they spoke too was so rude that the money was refunded to me.)

As my wife and I discussed this later, we realized that a few other weird things happened at the hotels we stayed at, i.e. expected amenities not available or at an unexpected fee, and we were basically told by staff to read the T&Cs.

I was reminded of this when I saw this story - the coffee stain on the passport may or may not have been a valid reason for denying boarding - but the guidance is ""Virgin recommends travelers visit the Conditions of Carriage section of its website for more details on documentation,"" which is 14,000 words of legalese and surely not helpful.

General sentiment was that rate cuts could be bearish for the market for a variety of reasons. We’re waiting to see if the flag has anything to do with the election, but the way world looks after November 5th will include the ripple effects of the Fed’s decision to cut interest rates on Sept 18th. In the words of our CEO:

>”Low interest rates may prove to be like easy sex — tempting but possibly fatal” — RC on X, Oct. 11, 2022

The Fed’s next meeting on monetary policy is November 6-7.

😳 💩 😿 🥜 🐸 🍦 🤢 👍 👊 💀 🥸 👀 🤩 ⚡️ 🎮 🚀 🍄 💥 🍏 🤨 😵‍💫 💜 🫂 👌 🤝 ⛺️ 😼 🎯 👀 🐕 (🇺🇸🎶🎤) 👀 🔥 💥 🍻

TL;DR—

* The emojis and RC’s tweets indicate that the Japanese carry trade and the Fed’s interest rate policy are very important
* I hypothesize that 🍻 may be DFV timing a “reverse” market crash/melt up scenario
* Teddy Holdings will exist as an alternative to traditional Venture Capitalist/Private Equity funding— the ultimate brainchild of LC and RC
* Other things are more speculative, but still tied to current events…

Japanese carry trade, strength of dollar, other carry trades

* 🥸-💥 represents the time when RC was tweeting about the Japanese carry trade. 
   * 🥸 is “disguised face”. This is the tweet where RC put googly eyes over his face 👀. RC’s next tweet would be his very first female face swap. Scrolling down from here, each tweet has something specifically to do with either Japan, “carry”, or telling DFV where to look:
      * Japan related: 1) Sumo wrestlers 2) ☀️👍 sun rise 3) Mario Hockey 4) a bidet 5) chopsticks 6) “I heard Ryan doesn’t cry when stepping on Lego”, a typo that reads like a Japanese accent; 7) a lego GameStop building with an ape climbing up the side reminiscent of King Kong. The big movie that had just come out a few months earlier? 8) 🤩 Godzilla vs King Kong  (red Hollywood stars tweet, emoji has two red stars in DFV’s timeline)
      * Keys 1) 🐱+ “eew eew llams a evah I” telling DFV to look backwards 2) HOLD or HODL indicating the sumo tweet 3) it takes money to buy whisKEY 4) 🎶 telling him to look out for the only musical reference in the soundless Zohan tweet right below it 5) Principal MacKEY from South Park + the face swap right below it 
      * Carry related: Zohan “carrying” a girl on his shoulders in one scene & wearing a Mariah Carey shirt towards the end
* Current event: Japan just elected a new Prime Minister, Shigeru Ishiba, in a surprise victory Sept. 30th. The market was apparently not pricing in his victory. He’s expected to allow the Bank of Japan to raise interest rates on the yen, which will strengthen the yen as the dollar weakens from the Fed’s rate cuts. 
* Based on how the initial unwind looked in August, I hope we’re in for a show. 

RC was telling us the whole time, DFV was just paying attention. You can see that in a Kitty that goes from 😿 to 👌 🤝. “[I had thought that at the time](https://x.com/theroaringkitty/status/1790762813868175516?s=42), but investment theses evolve over time…

Warren Buffett’s sale of Apple in 2020 as well as this year, an inflationary indicator?

* 🍏-🤨 represents a time when RC was tweeting about inflation
* “The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree 🍏” could be in reference to Warren Buffett’s selling of Apple in 2024, before the Fed started lowering interest rates again.
* When I heard WB was selling Apple, I thought it felt familiar… In the 2nd half of 2020, Buffett sold over $10 billion of Apple. 
   * The Fed kept interest rates steady at 0.25% for 2 years, until March 2022.
* Buffett starts buying Apple again in January of 2022. By the end of Q1 2023, Buffett had bought over $4.2 billion worth of stock. 
   * From March 2022 to July 2023, the Fed aggressively raised interest rates from 0.5% to 5.5%, where it stayed until the cut we just received last month, Sept 18 2024. 
* [This go round](https://stockcircle.com/portfolio/warren-buffett/aapl/transactions), he started selling in October 2023. In the first half of 2024 Buffett sold over $85 billion of Apple. 
* It was [widely reported](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/04/warren-buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-cut-apple-investment-by-about-13percent-in-the-first-quarter.html) that Buffett had sold more Apple on May 4th at Berkshire’s annual meeting. DFV came back May 12th. 
* ⚡️ 🎮 🚀 🍄 💥 🍏 🤨 😵‍💫 
   * 🤨 comes from the tweet “Who will be the piñata for all this inflation?” RC actually made the piñata tweet before the apple tweet, so DFV is presenting this chunk of information in a certain order. 
   * This chunk reads: “from the crash that happened around the time of that Mario tweet, who would be the piñata for the ensuing inflation?”
   * The spiral eyes isn’t totally clear, but you could easily say Nvidia has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of inflation dollars, and perhaps by way of carry trade.
      * Softbank is a Japanese holding company that acts as a proxy for all the big tech companies like Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft. They invest in SoftBank, SoftBank “partners” with them. I’m pretty sure Softbank can help facilitate a carry trade as an issuer of foreign currency. You’ll see what monopolistic bullshit they just pulled in the DOJ section below. 
      * Nah fuck it I’ll just tell you now. Remember how Microsoft and Nvidia tried to acquire Open AI and the DOJ said [no](https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/06/tech/ftc-microsofts-ai-investigation/index.html)? Guess who just invested half a billion into Open AI! [Softbank](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/02/openai-raises-at-157-billion-valuation-microsoft-nvidia-join-round.html)! I bet the DOJ *loves* that. 
      * Buffett famously does not own Nvidia

ARS Pharma 💉, Dreyfus, BNY Mellon 

* 👍-💀comes from the time RC made his Sears tweet with the S and the E getting knocked off the sign. I decided to look up “ARS Holdings” and the connections were surprising! 
* BNY Mellon just [reported](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-spry-sec-filing-2024-09-21/) an increase in their holdings of a company called ARS Pharmaceuticals on Sept. 21st. BNY increased its holdings by almost 100%, from 69,891 shares up to 139,285 owning \~0.14% of the company. The company was listed on Dec 4, 2020 right before the sneeze. 
   * BNY Mellon is also the owner of the Brazilian Puts
   * BNY Mellon also owns Dreyfus 
   * BNY settles trades for Citadel, especially repo market securities (treasuries, bonds)
   * BNY Mellon also has a friendly merger/acquisition relationship with Computershare… in an industry where they make up 2 of the top 5 competitors in their market… I’ll let you look into that on your own
* ARS Pharmaceuticals was  [reported](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/owning-30-shares-institutional-owners-131433242.html) as 30% institutionally owned in June, mostly hedge funds. This was before BNY’s recent increase.
* It was just reported a couple days ago that ARS Pharma is being investigated for securities fraud. Why?
   * This is where things weird. I don’t know exactly, but here’s what I saw on my journey:
      * If you Google News “ars pharmaceuticals” you get results for their FDA-approved nasal spray product mixed in with Law Firms saying the company is being sued for securities fraud. 
      * [This Law Firm](https://www.fox21news.com/business/press-releases/accesswire/922911/ars-pharmaceuticals-inc-is-being-investigated-for-possible-securities-fraud-and-investors-with-losses-are-urged-to-contact-the-schall-law-firm/) says: “The investigation focuses on whether the Company issued false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose information pertinent to investors. The FDA rejected the epinephrine nasal spray developed by ARS on September 19, 2023.”
      * It looks like ARS has been spreading information that their product is FDA approved, but that isn’t fully true. These law firms are looking for investors who suffered losses based on this misrepresentation to join a potential class action lawsuit. 
      * Timeline: ARS [responds](https://ir.ars-pharma.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ars-pharmaceuticals-submits-response-fda-complete-response) to FDA request for more information on their product in April; ARS [officially](https://ir.ars-pharma.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ars-pharmaceuticals-receives-fda-approval-neffyr-epinephrine) says they have FDA approval in August; Class action ambulance chasers like the one above reminding people today that ARS didn’t complete the FDA approval process *September of last year*.
      * BNY looked at this company and said “let me own this”
* Some investment firm named China Universal Asset Management, who specializes in Chinese investments, also invested in ARS Pharma, a California company… weird!
* For ARS Pharma to matter, you would need to believe that RC was tweeting about this on June 3, 2021 💉

Teddy Holdings, holding companies in general

* 👍 👊 It’s almost as if ARS Pharma is being used as a holding company. Speaking of holding companies, 👍 👊 came right before an RC tweet from the movie Ted. RC would go on to incorporate Teddy Holdings LLC 3 months later. 
   * I don’t think they’re official communications from GameStop, but if you google Teddy Holdings, the first few results look and sound like they came from LC + RC. Teddy holdings dot com looks like it’s a friendly, wholesome holding company that invests in small businesses. 
   * The axial website has the following description: Teddy Holdings is a low-profile holding company modeled after Berkshire Hathaway. Our founder was a private equity investor at Apollo Global Management and launched Teddy Holdings to be a permanent home for great small businesses (vs the traditional PE model of buying-and-selling large businesses). 
      * That last part about being against “the traditional model” of raising money certainly sounds like it came from RC, who had a hard time raising money for his company that way. 
      * Their logo on this site is a goat and it says the company is headquartered in NY, which reminds me of the little New York cap on the painting of [Tylee](https://x.com/ryancohen/status/1684016228938190848).
      * Does the pic under this section remind you of any tombstone tweeting CEOs? (I swear this has been found before)
* 🐸 🍦 the McDonald’s tweets stand out amidst his references to fallen companies like Blockbuster, Sears. The key to interpreting this tweet is by looking 2 below at the Ben Franklin pic— “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.” The famous McDonald’s story is that they took advantage of the 2008 housing crash to buy up real estate. The ounce of prevention was that they had the cash available to do so. The pound of cure is all the revenue their investments generated which helped them thrive while other companies struggled.
* Current event: the Apollo Global Management mention is interesting. (Apollo just bought) around $3 billion worth of Deutsche Bank debt in SRTs. I’ll be monitoring Apollo and Deutsche while researching their pre-sneeze situations a little more.

Will we see a “reverse market crash”? 

* 🍻 If there’s one thing DFV is good at, it’s timing the market.
   * If there’s another, it’s making memes.
* I’ve been thinking about a reverse market crash, where the Fed lowers interest rates to try and save a falling economy, which is essentially printing money just for the money to flow away from the broader economy and into stocks. The dollar becomes cheaper, banks borrow the cheap money, spend it on assets— the prices of those assets go up, but the dollar is still cheap, it can’t suddenly buy a more expensive thing. 
* The result of a reverse market crash is a “melt up” where inflation dollars flow into the stock market, causing stock prices to rise at the same rate the dollar loses its purchasing power. 
* I believe DFV could time the effect of an interest rate decision that causes a “melt up” in GME, but he would need to be able to pinpoint how exactly inflation dollars would make their way to GME. Banks and institutions have thus far not bought into GME. Perhaps that will change when things crash and GME/Teddy can do its Berkshire/McDonald’s thing. 
* The Argentina stock market has experienced a melt up since 2020. Puts the President Milei tweet into perspective. 🇦🇷👍

The upcoming fire and crash, DOJ regulatory perspective 🔥💥

* On top of unwinding these carry trades, the DOJ has been going after a lot of monopolies recently, which represents a lot of money in the markets. Within the last few months:
   * DOJ starts probing Nvidia
   * DOJ investigates Microsoft as well as Nvidia for investments in AI
   * DOJ wins a suit against Google for its search engine monopoly 
   * DOJ sues Apple for its smart phone monopoly
   * DOJ investigated and sued rental housing monopolies for algorithmic price fixing
   * Senate Committee on Homeland Security investigates Citadel in connection with a report on Hedge Fund Use of AI, warning of an upcoming crash caused by AI.
   * DOJ sues Andrew Left which probably spooks the other 30 hedge funds and short sellers they’re still investigating, including Citadel, Melvin, and Hindenburg.
      * You’ll know the DOJ is about to sue when you hear that a warehouse just caught fire.
   * Senate probes Kroger for their use of a pricing algorithm
* That is a fuck ton of money represented by monopolies that I won’t calculate. And that’s leaving out most of the other investigations DOJ has going on. These DOJ investigations are a liability on the balance sheet of the entire market. 
* My feeling is that the DOJ will want to pick up the legal process on Citadel before the election, just to have something going in case the next president has a radically different Antitrust agenda
* You should find it hard to believe that NOTHING was done about the buy button being turned off in ’21, yet regulators want to start acting on all this other shit now. Just like how we think everything in the market sort of revolves around GME, I think everything the DOJ is doing in Antitrust has to do with building a case against Citadel et al. Of particular interest to me is the DOJ’s suit in the rental housing market for algorithmic price fixing. 
   * This is America establishing legal precedent for the first time ever applying laws against monopolistic behavior to the use of algos/AI. 
   * I know that Citadel + others also use algorithm machines to control GME and the rest of the stock market, so I believe the DOJ will use the outcome in the rental housing case to say “Here’s what makes an algo machine illegal. Here’s how Citadel’s algo systems break the law we just established.”
   * **Theory: the algo is not testing for liquidity, it’s testing for price.** If it has Citadel’s MM + AP privileges, then it already has access to infinite liquidity. They’re looking for buyers and sellers, which does not necessarily require a certain number of shares. Foundational DD suggests 1) GME price is algorithmically controlled; and 2) the algorithms are not built to account for the total universe of shares that actually exist in the market. 
      * PWN DD showing price is algorithmically fixed
      * Leavemeanon DD stating: “they’re coded to look for profits… I don't know if there's a parameter than accounts for all the shares sold, trading, and collateralized on the books with derivatives that build up over time as excess supply.""
      * [Senate report](https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024.06.11-Hedge-Fund-Use-of-AI-Report.pdf) on hedge funds talks about how algos operate on an “if-then” basis without much regard to the wider effects of their behavior. See flash crashes caused by the triggering of algos, aka “herding”
* **Basically, I’m looking for interest rates, DOJ investigations, or algorithmic herding behavior to cause**

Two non-emoji things

Citadel’s RICO thing

* I find it interesting that this [RICO suit](https://www.morningstar.com/news/pr-newswire/20240722la66814/bankruptcy-trustee-joins-debt-holders-of-glorifi-to-pursue-alleged-saboteurs) against Citadel, brought by a private company, was announced at the same time the [DOJ filed charges](https://www.axios.com/2024/07/26/andrew-left-charges-doj-sec-short-seller) against Andrew Left & Citron. 
* [The suit](https://www.wfaa.com/article/money/billionaires-feud-bankrupt-anti-woke-dallas-bank/287-7cda5a3a-d081-48ac-ad4f-2ec326c84307) names Citadel as well as founder and former CEO of TD Ameritrade Joe Ricketts as defendants 
   * Hide yo kids hide yo warehouse 🔥
* The suit comes from the guy who created GloriFi, an “anti woke” banking start up which aimed to provide a conservative alternative for investors who became tired of businesses that took a stance on environmental, social and governance initiatives, otherwise known as ESG. GloriFi received financial backing from big-name investors including Ken Griffin, Peter Thiel, Jeff Sprecher who is the founder, CEO and chairman of Intercontinental Exchange, which owns the New York Stock Exchange; Rick Jackson, CEO of Georgia-based Jackson Healthcare LLC; Nick Ayers, former chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence; and Vivek Ramaswamy, an entrepreneur and former Republican presidential candidate.
* The suit accuses those investors of executing a plan to take down the company using so-called ""Trojan horse"" investments in the form of convertible debt, obtaining the right to block subsequent capital raises, attempts to put ""their people"" in executive positions at GloriFi while ""attempting to sow dissension"" within the existing ranks and insincere promises to keep funding the company while launching a campaign to block competing sources of capital
* The suit mentions how Ramasawamy launched a competitor, Strive Asset Management, in 2022. Strive had backing from Thiel, billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman and U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance, now the Republican vice presidential candidate.
* My current event here is mostly just to watch Donald T's stock along with other conservative-leaning businesses to see if there’s any connection. The companies of conservative Founders have been enjoying quite the bull market recently including Palantir and Oracle.

That day was such an off day for me from the time I woke up. 


We had a slow morning because I woke up with a headache. Even took a hour nap that day too. (Idk to many people who can say they napped on their wedding day lol.) we did our private vows and started getting ready. Thats when it kinda went down hill.

We had to meet at our spot at 5:15-5:30. We stayed a hour away from where we eloped. My husband got ready really quick and left at like 4:05 and at about 4:20 called me saying he forgot to grab our rings and license on the way out. No biggie I had it sitting on the coffee table to grab. 

So I was running a little bit behind. Because a snap on my dress had broken and I was trying to fix it. 
My friend who was our witness was with me and when we left it said we were going to be about 10 minutes late. Still no biggie. We get 20 minutes down the road….
I forgot my bouquet. 

We had to turn all the way around go get it and get back on the road. We didn’t arrive till 6:15. Which then left us 45 minutes for ceremony and photos because the sun was setting at 7:00. 

Once we got there and I saw my husband I felt a lot better. We had a short ceremony and in those 5 minutes of just us it was really nice. 
But after that…
It was really rushed and I felt like I couldn’t be in the moment much because it was running around trying to get photos before we lost sunlight. 

I constantly keep thinking of “what I could’ve done differently” to prevent me from forgetting the bouquet and making it there on time. 

We did get some photos back the next day as a sneak peak. They were really pretty but I didn’t find a photo that was “the shot” I was looking for. I’m anxious to see the rest of the photos. But I understand that could be a couple months due to busy season. 

Our photographer even offered that next year around our anniversary we go up there and take photos in the spots we didn’t get to. We don’t have to rewear wedding attire but just casual couple photos of us. 

I’ve considered taking my dress to get the train shortened and us retaking photos on an anniversary in the coming years at the same spot as well. 

Anyway- thanks for reading all of that. I’ve been trying to focus on the GOOD things that went right that day. We woke up together in a beautiful treehouse, had a slow morning with coffee, laughed and cried while exchanging our private vows, took a nap together, the moment we saw each other when I finally arrived, the flowers he picked for me at our ceremony spot, the pizza we ate after our wedding, and actually marrying my best friend.

Podcast listener donations are one of the simplest and most effective ways to make money from your podcast. Many of your listeners want to support your show, especially if it means they don’t have to sit through ads. 

# What are Podcast Listener Donations?

Listener donations are voluntary financial contributions from your podcast audience. These donations help support the production and growth of your show and allow you to cover costs like equipment, hosting, or even your time. 

Unlike sponsorships or ads, donations come directly from listeners who value your content and want to help keep it going. In many cases, listeners donate because they want to keep your show free of ads.

# Why Do Fans Donate to Your Podcasts?

* They feel a strong connection to the content and creators. 
* They appreciate the value you provide, whether it’s entertainment, education, or a sense of community. 
* They want to support creators who consistently deliver meaningful content and help sustain their work. 

# Do I Have to Give Something in Return for a Donation?

No, you don’t have to give something in return for a donation, but offering rewards or perks can encourage more contributions. Many podcasters provide exclusive content, shoutouts, or early access as a thank you to supporters. 

# How Many Listeners Donate to Podcasts?

Research shows that you can expect roughly 2% of your audience to donate. Yes, this is a minority of your audience, and it might only be a few people if your show is young, but every dollar helps support your content. 

# How Much Do Listeners Typically Donate?

Listener donations can vary, but they generally range from $1 to $10 per contribution. Podcasts on our platform that enable [Castos Commerce](https://castos.com/commerce/) get about $5 per donor. 

# How to Accept Donations From Podcast Listeners

In order to accept listener donations, you’ll need a platform to collect payments. Here are the top options. 

**1. Castos Commerce**

[Castos Commerce](https://castos.com/commerce/) is a fully-managed experience that allows you to easily collect one-time or recurring donations directly from your Castos account, making it simple for listeners to contribute while they enjoy your content.

Castos Commerce processes payments using Stripe. Castos does NOT take a percentage of your revenue. It’s free for all Castos users. Supporters get access to their own subscriber dashboard where they can manage their contributions, get receipts, and update payment details. 

**2. Buy Me a Coffee**

[Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/) is a straightforward platform where listeners can quickly send you small donations, often framed as a gesture of appreciation, like buying you a cup of coffee. You can put your Buy Me a Coffee link anywhere. 

Buy Me a Coffee does not charge a monthly fee. All features including publishing and emails are free for everyone, but there is a 5% transaction fee on each donation. 

**3. Patreon**

[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/) lets you set up a membership system, where listeners can support your podcast through recurring donations in exchange for exclusive content, early access, or other rewards. This is a great option if you also want to communicate directly with your donors.

Starting a Patreon is free, but the paid accounts get access to special features. The Pro account takes 8% of your revenue. The Premium account takes 12% of your revenue. 

# How to Encourage More Podcast Listener Donations

Here are the key strategies to boost listener contributions.

**Step 1: Build a Highly Engaged Audience**

An engaged audience is more likely to donate because they feel a personal connection to your podcast. How do you engage listeners?

* Interact with them on social media.
* Regularly ask for feedback or involve your listeners in the show through Q&A sessions or shout outs. 
* Build a community on some platform like Facebook or LinkedIn where you can have two-way conversations. 

**Step 2: Make Donating Super Easy**

The easier it is for listeners to donate, the more likely they’ll follow through. Use platforms that offer seamless payment options, like Castos Commerce or Buy Me a Coffee. Keep donation links in accessible places, like your show notes, website, and social media profiles. 

It’s also a good item to create a URL on your domain that’s easy to say aloud and remember. Use something simple like yourdomain.com/donate. Redirect this URL to the donation page. This way you can mention it on your show and it will be simple for your listeners to find the page.

**Step 3: Make Specific Donation Requests**

Instead of simply asking for general support, be specific about what donations will help you achieve. Whether it’s funding new equipment, producing bonus content, or helping with hosting fees, transparency about where the money goes can motivate listeners to contribute. When listeners see a clear purpose for their donations, they feel more compelled to give.

In your requests, use specific dollar amounts, like $1 or $5. This has three benefits:

* It’s an inconsequential amount of money for most people.
* It feels like you have a purpose for the money. Asking for “whatever you can give” sounds like you just want money for yourself. 
* People feel like their contribution will be similar to other people’s contribution, which makes them feel more comfortable about the amount. 

**Step 4: Reward Donations with Engagement**

While you don’t have to give material rewards, acknowledging donors goes a long way. Offer public recognition with shout outs during episodes or personalized thank-you messages. 

Some podcasters encourage their donors to submit a comment or a question with the donation.  Then the host responds to the comment or answers the question on an episode.

**Step 5: Use Clear Calls to Action in Every Episode**

Include clear calls to action in each episode, whether at the beginning, during a break, or in the outro. Remind your listeners how they can support the show and why their contributions matter. 

# Other Ways to Monetize Your Podcast

The smartest shows don’t rely on a single monetization tactic. Instead, they use a little bit of several tactics to maximize your revenue. Once you start combining listener donations with other monetization strategies, such as sponsorships, premium content, or merchandise, your revenue stream will really begin to grow.

I’m talking about that *must-have caffeine hit* that makes morning meetings bearable. Enter: Mr. Coffee 12-Cup Coffee Maker. No fluff, just a simple, budget-friendly machine that keeps me caffeinated.

**Design & Build Quality:** Not a looker, but it gets the job done. It's mostly plastic, which makes it lightweight but maybe not the most durable (heads up if you're as clumsy as me before that first cup). Compact, doesn't hog my limited kitchen counter space, and the glass carafe gives it a slightly fancy touch. The buttons? Super simple. I could probably figure it out even in zombie-mode.

**Features I Actually Use:**

* **Programmable Settings:** I set it up the night before, and bam! Fresh coffee smell wakes me up. It’s like a personal barista... if that barista lived in my kitchen and worked for cheap.
* **Grab-A-Cup Auto Pause:** Seriously, if you’re too impatient to wait for the full pot, this thing lets you sneak a cup mid-brew without making a mess. Love it.
* **Easy Clean:** The filter basket lifts out, making clean-up a breeze. And trust me, that’s huge when you’re lazy like me.

**Pros:**

* **Affordable:** Like, real affordable. You can find it for around $20-30, and it works well for what it is. Perfect for my broke caffeine-loving self.
* **Big Batch or Solo Sips:** Whether I need one cup or 12 (depending on how stressful the day is), it’s got me covered.

**Cons:**

* **Plastic Everything:** Yeah, it feels a bit cheap, but it’s what you get for the price.
* **Not Scorching Hot:** Brew temp isn’t gonna knock your socks off. It’s hot, but not *barista-grade hot*.

**Verdict:** If you want a no-fuss coffee machine that’s easy to use, easy to clean, and keeps you caffeinated without burning a hole in your wallet, Mr. Coffee 12-Cup is a solid option. You’re not gonna win any style points, but it gets the job done.",1,1728399850.0,TheCoffeeMachine,0,1.0,False

**6:50pm**  
**Monday, 7 October 2024**

I have been sitting in the car in the same seat for a couple of hours. From what I remember I sat here maybe at 3 or 4pm, according to my parents we will reach home at 12am but most probably we will reach much later.

Well I just created a reddit account 10mins ago. It was a rash decision (if that's the correct word used in this scenario). I don't have a clear idea why I created it, maybe I just wanted to write my current thoughts, maybe writing will somehow give me a better understanding on how to deal with this situation.  
What I do know is that I just want another point of view, I want to know how another person would react to this situation, what will be their solution, how will they deal with it.

**I want to know what will you do if you are in my shoes**

# Who am I

**7:48pm**  
**Monday,7 October 2024**

I plugged my phone for charging roamed around reddit for a bit, kind of learned how it works, added a few things to my profile.  
I am still on the road in the same car though I've changed my seat.

After drinking some water and making a few decisions I have decided what to do with this account of mine. I will write about my situations, my opinions and you will give me your views That's how reddit works.. Right?

But before anything i guess you should know about me or at least what I think I am, I am...

(It has been 15mins but I can't answer that question I thought I would give you an introduction, say a few adjectives that describe me but for some reason I can't. The harder I try the blanker my mind gets.)

# A false character

**8:12pm**  
**Monday, 7october 2024**

It is complete dark outside the stars are barley visible, I am reminded again that I will be reaching home soon. The stars shone brightly in the mountains, unlike my home I could actually see them twinkling though the earth's atmosphere. Well at least the moon is here, though I guess it will disappear tomorrow (but I am sure I will see it again soon)

When I look outside the window I see farms so vast that I don't think it can be measured. I think these are wheat farms but due to the darkness and the nonstop moving of the car I can't really figure it out. At a distance though I see some lights maybe a small village

The GPS shows we will reach home around 1am but I am think we will reach much latter, I am hoping we will reach latter. Why you ask, because I don't want to go school tomorrow. I know I have missed a week of school already but I really don't want to I feel like the moment I enter the class they will look at me, question me, ask me if I am okay, or maybe they won't do anything..

I just can't get rid of this anxiousness this disgusting feeling that is eating me alive. Maybe it's due to this feeling or these rusty roads I feel like vomiting

I don't know when it started but at a point in my life I began lying not simple day to day lies but something more. I started to lie about myself I created something. something like a character. ""x"" is what I call it. X is quite different from my own self. It is quite good, always motivated, hardworking, quite disciplined, has friends and has quite a social life. Most importantly x has good grades

Around 4th grade I remember looking at my graded answer sheet I don't exactly remember with subject it was but I had passed I got 70-75 percent I guess. I didn't really think much of it until I talked to my friends they all had gotten more than 80 percent a few of them we even sad that they didn't reach 90 percent. Then they looked at me and asked ""you seem quite happy how much did you get?"" I don't know why but I the moment I said 95 percent That's how it all began.

Since then a lot has changed my friends are different my teachers are different even i as a person am different not one thing remains the same except of my character x

The farms converted to outskirts and more and more lights we visible we took a break to have dinner, well I had a cold coffee and some fries so I don't think that's a proper dinner but for some reason I really didn't want to eat. We took takeout and sat again in the car. Now that we had dropped my uncle and aunt the car wasn't so cramped anymore the whole backseat was mine my legs could finally stretch. I was listening to some music and before I knew it I was asleep. I wake up to my mom calling me we reached home...  
We unloaded the luggage and got inside. My body hurts my legs feel like falling out and my whole body is cramped. i feel itchy , so much i want peel my skin out.

After making my bed I decided to take a bath. I don't know if it helped or not but at least I feel clean now. I am tired but I can sleep I guess really want to tire my body so that I don't have to got to school tomorrow or maybe it's the unanswered questions that keep me awake

Character x has become a part of me for the past few years it worked good my friends who are not friends anymore liked me. X is made of nothing but lies, x speaks nothing but lies. I really liked the sense of security it gave me I could just lie about anything through x. After lock down x started playing a bigger role in my life. I never had good grades Bs and Cs always an occasional D too but to my classmates I was a grade A student and they liked that about me. For the past two year this went on until a week ago...

I am now in 11th grade and the subjects are a lot more harder but if I want to pursue my dream (which i am questioning now) I have to study them. Well at the starting of the year I decided to become a straight A student for real but somewhere I stopped doing that I indulged back to my old habits. I know my teachers know about my situation, I know my parents know about it as well but my peers didn't and they always complimented me ""you are so smart"", ""dude you have to tell me how you study"". I surround myself with these words and affirmations, I created a false reality for myself....

A week ago my midterms got over my family had a trip planned the next week my aunts family was visiting so we decided to go to the hillside a road trip. I knew how I had done in my midterms, only one word to describe it ""terrible"".

I didn't go to school on Monday cause we were supposed to get our answer sheets. I was trying to avoid it, maybe if I don't go to school today I won't see my answer sheets, after the trip I will and lie to everyone I will do better next time a line I always tell myself but never follow.

Well around 4pm my friend texted me hey call me it's urgent. I called and he said ""dude are you okay we got our answer sheet the teachers announced all the marks you have failed in all your main subjects, you've got the lowest in class, everyone knows"" He tried to comfort me and say you will do better next time and he believed in me. He is the only friend I have right now or at least I think so. After hearing his words I cried I failed my midterm what if I fail my whole grade I would be required to repeat a year. My brain spiraled out of control. Before I knew it it was 6pm my parents were about to reach home, my eyes were swollen, my face was red, I cleaned myself up and went downstairs after an hour of pondering and wandering on the streets my face was now normal I went back home didn't tell my parents anything. at night i couldn't sleep I was thinking what would everyone think of me and that's when it snapped to me

More than my grades more than anything else I was worried what others would think of me I had adjusted so well in my false reality, now that it's broken I don't understand anything, I don't know what to do, how should i face this, can i recover from this, or maybe just maybe its better to just end everything .....

On Tuesday I didn't go to school told mom nothing important was happening today and decided to pack for the trip. The day passed in a blink of an eye I don't remember what I did when my parents returned home I decided to tell my mom. She did not show it but I could tell she was crushed, worried about me and my future. We decided not to tell dad and went on the trip

character x showed up on the trip too. Not a spec of worry was shown on my face I was enjoying to the fullest but deep inside I felt like dying....

Now it's 2:55 I am laying in my bed writing this post I should be sleeping but I can't. I don't know what will happen tomorrow

1fz1x8s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1fz1x8s/how_to_enjoy_education/,How to enjoy education? ,"Hi, I'm 20F currently in my second year at uni. I have never much enjoyed school, always felt like a waste of time and energy. I dread getting up in the morning early. Not eating breakfast, rushing through a coffee and a cigarette while fighting with the severe migraines I get from sleep deprivation. My first 6 years of education I've felt motivated, excelled at everything, did debate for 8 years but all of a sudden grade 7 rolls around and I lose every bit of motivation. 

At this point I'm still keeping up my academic excellence, finished years 5-8 with a 100% at every single class w/o much of an effort. When my personality developed I discovered my artistic side, which helped me through many mental struggles. Keep in mind I have always been an autodidact, thought myself every skill I have. 
High school rolls around, I have many friends, never been bullied in my life, I'm fairly pretty, good social skills thanks to debate club but very much of an introvert. After a couple months I start to skip school, never pay attention, never make effort to learn something, cuz everything seemed boring. I would draw figures on tests cuz I didn't have the energy to read through the questions. Teachers hated me, never saw my potential,never motivated me, just made me feel like a sheep among many others, and if I didn't fit the standards I was called stupid and good for nothing. 

By this time I've taught myself 4 languages in addition to my mother tongue, could write and read the Cyrrilic alphabet, taught myself to play the piano, to draw and paint, to sculpt, to write and many other skills. I was constantly called a good for nothing waste of a child. I passed my classes with a 40% attendance (many medical notes kept me in school) then went into online school, which made me not pay attention to education at all in the traditional sense. Finished high school with an 85% overall average, my final exames came out to 93%. I could go to any uni I've wanted with close to no effort and crippling depression and anxiety from all this. 
I didn't want to go to uni, I've found my dream career but as it doesn't pay that well and idk how far I'll get I decided to go to uni. Rolled into a random major and at the start I liked it. I had motivation yet again but it soon faded as again if u didn't attend every class and constantly talked to professors u were just a sheep in the herd. 

Year two started like a month ago, I can't get myself to go, I need to cuz attendance is mandatory, but everytime I go I get in the same mental state I was in high school. I don't even want to talk to people, most of my classmates only gossip which I don't have the energy for. I feel like my soul disappears when I enter the building, every bit of creativity is sucked out of me, I go home and feel exhausted. 
Last year again with minimal attendance and one day learning time for each exam, I've passed all my classes. I was the only one in my class of 45 people to do that. This year I don't know what to do, cuz if I don't attend my classes I can't take the exams. I'm so depressed and a mental mess, please if u have any advice help",1,1728399736.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1fz1wvn,https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/1fz1wvn/putting_it_all_together_current_events_im/,Putting it all together; current events I'm watching as we wait for 🇺🇸🎶🎤,"I wrote a post earlier looking at the flag + mic, fire, and crash emojis in context of the Fed’s decision to cut interest rates on Sept. 18th. General sentiment was that rate cuts could be bearish for the market for a variety of reasons. We’re waiting to see if the flag has anything to do with the election, but the way world looks after November 5th will include the ripple effects of the Fed’s decision to cut interest rates on Sept 18th. In the words of our CEO:

>”Low interest rates may prove to be like easy sex — tempting but possibly fatal” — RC on X, Oct. 11, 2022

The Fed’s next meeting on monetary policy is November 6-7.

😳 💩 😿 🥜 🐸 🍦 🤢 👍 👊 💀 🥸 👀 🤩 ⚡️ 🎮 🚀 🍄 💥 🍏 🤨 😵‍💫 💜 🫂 👌 🤝 ⛺️ 😼 🎯 👀 🐕 (🇺🇸🎶🎤) 👀 🔥 💥 🍻

TL;DR—

* The emojis and RC’s tweets indicate that the Japanese carry trade and the Fed’s interest rate policy are very important
* I hypothesize that 🍻 may be DFV timing a “reverse” market crash/melt up scenario
* Teddy Holdings will exist as an alternative to traditional Venture Capitalist/Private Equity funding— the ultimate brainchild of LC and RC
* Other things are more speculative, but still tied to current events…

Japanese carry trade, strength of dollar, other carry trades

* 🥸-💥 represents the time when RC was tweeting about the Japanese carry trade. 
   * 🥸 is “disguised face”. This is the tweet where RC put googly eyes over his face 👀. RC’s next tweet would be his very first female face swap. Scrolling down from here, each tweet has something specifically to do with either Japan, “carry”, or telling DFV where to look:
      * Japan related: 1) Sumo wrestlers 2) ☀️👍 sun rise 3) Mario Hockey 4) a bidet 5) chopsticks 6) “I heard Ryan doesn’t cry when stepping on Lego”, a typo that reads like a Japanese accent; 7) a lego GameStop building with an ape climbing up the side reminiscent of King Kong. The big movie that had just come out a few months earlier? 8) 🤩 Godzilla vs King Kong  (red Hollywood stars tweet, emoji has two red stars in DFV’s timeline)
      * Keys 1) 🐱+ “eew eew llams a evah I” telling DFV to look backwards 2) HOLD or HODL indicating the sumo tweet 3) it takes money to buy whisKEY 4) 🎶 telling him to look out for the only musical reference in the soundless Zohan tweet right below it 5) Principal MacKEY from South Park + the face swap right below it 
      * Carry related: Zohan “carrying” a girl on his shoulders in one scene & wearing a Mariah Carey shirt towards the end
* Current event: Japan just elected a new Prime Minister, Shigeru Ishiba, in a surprise victory Sept. 30th. The market was apparently not pricing in his victory. He’s expected to allow the Bank of Japan to raise interest rates on the yen, which will strengthen the yen as the dollar weakens from the Fed’s rate cuts. 
* Based on how the initial unwind looked in August, I hope we’re in for a show. 

RC was telling us the whole time, DFV was just paying attention. You can see that in a Kitty that goes from 😿 to 👌 🤝. “[I had thought that at the time](https://x.com/theroaringkitty/status/1790762813868175516?s=42), but investment theses evolve over time…

Warren Buffett’s sale of Apple in 2020 as well as this year, an inflationary indicator?

* 🍏-🤨 represents a time when RC was tweeting about inflation
* “The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree 🍏” could be in reference to Warren Buffett’s selling of Apple in 2024, before the Fed started lowering interest rates again.
* When I heard WB was selling Apple, I thought it felt familiar… In the 2nd half of 2020, Buffett sold over $10 billion of Apple. 
   * The Fed kept interest rates steady at 0.25% for 2 years, until March 2022.
* Buffett starts buying Apple again in January of 2022. By the end of Q1 2023, Buffett had bought over $4.2 billion worth of stock. 
   * From March 2022 to July 2023, the Fed aggressively raised interest rates from 0.5% to 5.5%, where it stayed until the cut we just received last month, Sept 18 2024. 
* [This go round](https://stockcircle.com/portfolio/warren-buffett/aapl/transactions), he started selling in October 2023. In the first half of 2024 Buffett sold over $85 billion of Apple. 
* It was [widely reported](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/04/warren-buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-cut-apple-investment-by-about-13percent-in-the-first-quarter.html) that Buffett had sold more Apple on May 4th at Berkshire’s annual meeting. DFV came back May 12th. 
* ⚡️ 🎮 🚀 🍄 💥 🍏 🤨 😵‍💫 
   * 🤨 comes from the tweet “Who will be the piñata for all this inflation?” RC actually made the piñata tweet before the apple tweet, so DFV is presenting this chunk of information in a certain order. 
   * This chunk reads: “from the crash that happened around the time of that Mario tweet, who would be the piñata for the ensuing inflation?”
   * The spiral eyes isn’t totally clear, but you could easily say Nvidia has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of inflation dollars, and perhaps by way of carry trade.
      * Softbank is a Japanese holding company that acts as a proxy for all the big tech companies like Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft. They invest in SoftBank, SoftBank “partners” with them. I’m pretty sure Softbank can help facilitate a carry trade as an issuer of foreign currency. You’ll see what monopolistic bullshit they just pulled in the DOJ section below. 
      * Nah fuck it I’ll just tell you now. Remember how Microsoft and Nvidia tried to acquire Open AI and the DOJ said [no](https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/06/tech/ftc-microsofts-ai-investigation/index.html)? Guess who just invested half a billion into Open AI! [Softbank](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/02/openai-raises-at-157-billion-valuation-microsoft-nvidia-join-round.html)! I bet the DOJ *loves* that. 
      * Buffett famously does not own Nvidia

ARS Pharma 💉, Dreyfus, BNY Mellon 

* 👍-💀comes from the time RC made his Sears tweet with the S and the E getting knocked off the sign. I decided to look up “ARS Holdings” and the connections were surprising! 
* BNY Mellon just [reported](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-spry-sec-filing-2024-09-21/) an increase in their holdings of a company called ARS Pharmaceuticals on Sept. 21st. BNY increased its holdings by almost 100%, from 69,891 shares up to 139,285 owning \~0.14% of the company. The company was listed on Dec 4, 2020 right before the sneeze. 
   * BNY Mellon is also the owner of the Brazilian Puts
   * BNY Mellon also owns Dreyfus 
   * BNY settles trades for Citadel, especially repo market securities (treasuries, bonds)
   * BNY Mellon also has a friendly merger/acquisition relationship with Computershare… in an industry where they make up 2 of the top 5 competitors in their market… I’ll let you look into that on your own
* ARS Pharmaceuticals was  [reported](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/owning-30-shares-institutional-owners-131433242.html) as 30% institutionally owned in June, mostly hedge funds. This was before BNY’s recent increase.
* It was just reported a couple days ago that ARS Pharma is being investigated for securities fraud. Why?
   * This is where things weird. I don’t know exactly, but here’s what I saw on my journey:
      * If you Google News “ars pharmaceuticals” you get results for their FDA-approved nasal spray product mixed in with Law Firms saying the company is being sued for securities fraud. 
      * [This Law Firm](https://www.fox21news.com/business/press-releases/accesswire/922911/ars-pharmaceuticals-inc-is-being-investigated-for-possible-securities-fraud-and-investors-with-losses-are-urged-to-contact-the-schall-law-firm/) says: “The investigation focuses on whether the Company issued false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose information pertinent to investors. The FDA rejected the epinephrine nasal spray developed by ARS on September 19, 2023.”
      * It looks like ARS has been spreading information that their product is FDA approved, but that isn’t fully true. These law firms are looking for investors who suffered losses based on this misrepresentation to join a potential class action lawsuit. 
      * Timeline: ARS [responds](https://ir.ars-pharma.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ars-pharmaceuticals-submits-response-fda-complete-response) to FDA request for more information on their product in April; ARS [officially](https://ir.ars-pharma.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ars-pharmaceuticals-receives-fda-approval-neffyr-epinephrine) says they have FDA approval in August; Class action ambulance chasers like the one above reminding people today that ARS didn’t complete the FDA approval process *September of last year*.
      * BNY looked at this company and said “let me own this”
* Some investment firm named China Universal Asset Management, who specializes in Chinese investments, also invested in ARS Pharma, a California company… weird!
* For ARS Pharma to matter, you would need to believe that RC was tweeting about this on June 3, 2021 💉

Teddy Holdings, holding companies in general

* 👍 👊 It’s almost as if ARS Pharma is being used as a holding company. Speaking of holding companies, 👍 👊 came right before an RC tweet from the movie Ted. RC would go on to incorporate Teddy Holdings LLC 3 months later. 
   * I don’t think they’re official communications from GameStop, but if you google Teddy Holdings, the first few results look and sound like they came from LC + RC. Teddy holdings dot com looks like it’s a friendly, wholesome holding company that invests in small businesses. 
   * The axial website has the following description: Teddy Holdings is a low-profile holding company modeled after Berkshire Hathaway. Our founder was a private equity investor at Apollo Global Management and launched Teddy Holdings to be a permanent home for great small businesses (vs the traditional PE model of buying-and-selling large businesses). 
      * That last part about being against “the traditional model” of raising money certainly sounds like it came from RC, who had a hard time raising money for his company that way. 
      * Their logo on this site is a goat and it says the company is headquartered in NY, which reminds me of the little New York cap on the painting of [Tylee](https://x.com/ryancohen/status/1684016228938190848).
      * Does the pic under this section remind you of any tombstone tweeting CEOs? (I swear this has been found before)
* 🐸 🍦 the McDonald’s tweets stand out amidst his references to fallen companies like Blockbuster, Sears. The key to interpreting this tweet is by looking 2 below at the Ben Franklin pic— “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.” The famous McDonald’s story is that they took advantage of the 2008 housing crash to buy up real estate. The ounce of prevention was that they had the cash available to do so. The pound of cure is all the revenue their investments generated which helped them thrive while other companies struggled.
* Current event: the Apollo Global Management mention is interesting. (Apollo just bought) around $3 billion worth of Deutsche Bank debt in SRTs. I’ll be monitoring Apollo and Deutsche while researching their pre-sneeze situations a little more.

Will we see a “reverse market crash”? 

* 🍻 If there’s one thing DFV is good at, it’s timing the market.
   * If there’s another, it’s making memes.
* I’ve been thinking about a reverse market crash, where the Fed lowers interest rates to try and save a falling economy, which is essentially printing money just for the money to flow away from the broader economy and into stocks. The dollar becomes cheaper, banks borrow the cheap money, spend it on assets— the prices of those assets go up, but the dollar is still cheap, it can’t suddenly buy a more expensive thing. 
* The result of a reverse market crash is a “melt up” where inflation dollars flow into the stock market, causing stock prices to rise at the same rate the dollar loses its purchasing power. 
* I believe DFV could time the effect of an interest rate decision that causes a “melt up” in GME, but he would need to be able to pinpoint how exactly inflation dollars would make their way to GME. Banks and institutions have thus far not bought into GME. Perhaps that will change when things crash and GME/Teddy can do its Berkshire/McDonald’s thing. 
* The Argentina stock market has experienced a melt up since 2020. Puts the President Milei tweet into perspective. 🇦🇷👍

The upcoming fire and crash, DOJ regulatory perspective 🔥💥

* On top of unwinding these carry trades, the DOJ has been going after a lot of monopolies recently, which represents a lot of money in the markets. Within the last few months:
   * DOJ starts probing Nvidia
   * DOJ investigates Microsoft as well as Nvidia for investments in AI
   * DOJ wins a suit against Google for its search engine monopoly 
   * DOJ sues Apple for its smart phone monopoly
   * DOJ investigated and sued rental housing monopolies for algorithmic price fixing
   * Senate Committee on Homeland Security investigates Citadel in connection with a report on Hedge Fund Use of AI, warning of an upcoming crash caused by AI.
   * DOJ sues Andrew Left which probably spooks the other 30 hedge funds and short sellers they’re still investigating, including Citadel, Melvin, and Hindenburg.
      * You’ll know the DOJ is about to sue when you hear that a warehouse just caught fire.
   * Senate probes Kroger for their use of a pricing algorithm
* That is a fuck ton of money represented by monopolies that I won’t calculate. And that’s leaving out most of the other investigations DOJ has going on. These DOJ investigations are a liability on the balance sheet of the entire market. 
* My feeling is that the DOJ will want to pick up the legal process on Citadel before the election, just to have something going in case the next president has a radically different Antitrust agenda
* You should find it hard to believe that NOTHING was done about the buy button being turned off in ’21, yet regulators want to start acting on all this other shit now. Just like how we think everything in the market sort of revolves around GME, I think everything the DOJ is doing in Antitrust has to do with building a case against Citadel et al. Of particular interest to me is the DOJ’s suit in the rental housing market for algorithmic price fixing. 
   * This is America establishing legal precedent for the first time ever applying laws against monopolistic behavior to the use of algos/AI. 
   * I know that Citadel + others also use algorithm machines to control GME and the rest of the stock market, so I believe the DOJ will use the outcome in the rental housing case to say “Here’s what makes an algo machine illegal. Here’s how Citadel’s algo systems break the law we just established.”
   * **Theory: the algo is not testing for liquidity, it’s testing for price.** If it has Citadel’s MM + AP privileges, then it already has access to infinite liquidity. They’re looking for buyers and sellers, which does not necessarily require a certain number of shares. Foundational DD suggests 1) GME price is algorithmically controlled; and 2) the algorithms are not built to account for the total universe of shares that actually exist in the market. 
      * PWN DD showing price is algorithmically fixed
      * Leavemeanon DD stating: “they’re coded to look for profits… I don't know if there's a parameter than accounts for all the shares sold, trading, and collateralized on the books with derivatives that build up over time as excess supply.
      * [Senate report](https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024.06.11-Hedge-Fund-Use-of-AI-Report.pdf) on hedge funds talks about how algos operate on an “if-then” basis without much regard to the wider effects of their behavior. See flash crashes caused by the triggering of algos, aka “herding”
* **Basically, I’m looking for interest rates, DOJ investigations, or algorithmic herding behavior to cause**

Two non-emoji things

Citadel’s RICO thing

* I find it interesting that this [RICO suit](https://www.morningstar.com/news/pr-newswire/20240722la66814/bankruptcy-trustee-joins-debt-holders-of-glorifi-to-pursue-alleged-saboteurs) against Citadel, brought by a private company, was announced at the same time the [DOJ filed charges](https://www.axios.com/2024/07/26/andrew-left-charges-doj-sec-short-seller) against Andrew Left & Citron. 
* [The suit](https://www.wfaa.com/article/money/billionaires-feud-bankrupt-anti-woke-dallas-bank/287-7cda5a3a-d081-48ac-ad4f-2ec326c84307) names Citadel as well as founder and former CEO of TD Ameritrade Joe Ricketts as defendants 
   * Hide yo kids hide yo warehouse 🔥
* The suit comes from the guy who created GloriFi, an “anti woke” banking start up which aimed to provide a conservative alternative for investors who became tired of businesses that took a stance on environmental, social and governance initiatives, otherwise known as ESG. GloriFi received financial backing from big-name investors including Ken Griffin, Peter Thiel, Jeff Sprecher who is the founder, CEO and chairman of Intercontinental Exchange, which owns the New York Stock Exchange; Rick Jackson, CEO of Georgia-based Jackson Healthcare LLC; Nick Ayers, former chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence; and Vivek Ramaswamy, an entrepreneur and former Republican presidential candidate.
* The suit accuses those investors of executing a plan to take down the company using so-called ""Trojan horse"" investments in the form of convertible debt, obtaining the right to block subsequent capital raises, attempts to put ""their people"" in executive positions at GloriFi while ""attempting to sow dissension"" within the existing ranks and insincere promises to keep funding the company while launching a campaign to block competing sources of capital
* The suit mentions how Ramasawamy launched a competitor, Strive Asset Management, in 2022. Strive had backing from Thiel, billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman and U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance, now the Republican vice presidential candidate.
* My current event here is mostly just to watch Donald T's stock along with other conservative-leaning businesses to see if there’s any connection. The companies of conservative Founders have been enjoying quite the bull market recently including Palantir and Oracle.

1fz1wf9,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenRGB/comments/1fz1wf9/my_gf_is_going_to_kill_me/,My gf is going to kill me,"So my gf bought some razer kraken kitty v2 USB headphones and wanted to change the default lighting on them (women :sips coffee:). I already built her machine with lots of RGB, and it looked and worked fine without installing any vendor software or any programs of any kind.

Since she insisted the green color on the headphones wasn’t good enough, I looked for alternatives to change the rgb on her headphones since Razer Synapse software is bloat central. I stumbled across OpenRGB from ChrisTitus YouTube and decided to give it a try.

Upon starting OpenRGB my 6 RGB fans shut off immediately and I was panicking. I was then searching for the razer headset which wasn’t even present in the list of devices. I went to the OpenRGB website to see if they are even supported, and it does say they are.

What further added to the confusion is that there is currently an open GitLab issue for Kraken Kitty V2 USB support, but the support list says it already supports them. This possibly means that it supports the 3.5mm jack version? Is there such a version? I have no idea, since the support list doesn’t specify 3.5mm or USB variant. It could at least say USB at the end to avoid confusion.

ANYWAYYYYY, I was then trying to get the fans back on by changing the settings which made things worse. Now my LED strip doesn’t turn on at all. Further loosing my hair line I decided to install SignalRGB which did turn on the fans and LED strip, but it’s also bloat central and requires the software to be running for the effects to work (I think). 

Since that didn’t fix the problem either, I had to install the manufacturers RGB software (iCUE and CAM). Fortunately, CAM restarted the settings for the controller and now my 3 RGB fans work, and the iCUE software did fix the other 6 fans, but now one of the corsair fans is broken and so is one of my LED strips.

I saved the best for last, guess what else broke too. MY CORSAIR DOMINATOR RAM RGB IS COMPLETELY BORKED. Using iCUE doesn’t work and SignalRGB doesn’t fix it either. I’m literally terrified to open OpenRGB again in that it will break more of my components.

What can I do to fix this? I just wanted to change my headphone RGB lights and it ended up breaking my led strip, rgb fan, and fricking ram lights.

OpenRGB gives no warning that I recall when opening the software that it can bork your RAM RGB, it automatically loads some sort of profile which changes the default settings on the RGB and doesn’t give the user an option to leave at default.

Here's my[ first attempt](https://www.reddit.com/r/PubTips/comments/1fmeixs/qcrit_urban_fantasy_romance_dark_roast_100kv1/). Changed my genre I'm pitching and hope this works better. Any additional feedback is appreciated.

Dear (Agent),  
Due to your interest in (personalization), I present my queer, speculative fiction novel, DARK ROAST, complete at 100,000 words. It will appeal to readers who enjoyed the gothic themes of *Starling House* by Alix E. Harrow and the steamy lesbian romance of *An Education in Malice* by S.T. Gibson.

After the death of her girlfriend, Danny just wants to start over. However, she finds herself haunted by the literal ghost of her girlfriend, Astrid, driving her deeper into guilt and self-destruction. Convinced she is responsible for Astrid's death, Danny is complacent with the haunting, even while she faces familial pressure to move on with her life.

A chance encounter at a mysterious coffee shop gives Astrid’s spirit greater and more deadly power. The strange and alluring coffee shop owner, Nora, offers Danny the chance to work through the memories that keep Astrid’s spirit trapped, and a way forward in her life. After Astrid attempts to kill Danny in a house fire, she accepts Nora’s help to break the spiritual tethers that keep her former girlfriend bound to her.

Danny embarks into the world of rituals, spirits, and group of people who blur the line between life and death. To free Astrid, Danny must physically relive the most painful memories leading up to her girlfriend’s death. But with a growing attraction to Nora, Danny struggles with the connection that ties Astrid to her while also aching to move on. As her relationship blooms, Nora makes it clear that Danny must resolve the connection with Astrid before they can be together. Through memories of chemo treatments, nebulous ties to a hateful religious family, and the impending end to Astrid's life, Danny must step through her grief and discover what waits for her on the other side.

Danny's story answers the question: what would you say to people you lost if you met them over coffee? My own experience with my queer identity and personal struggles through grief are what gives life to Danny’s story. I’ve spent ten years in copywriting and marketing and hope make my to debut in the creative writing world. When I’m not writing, I enjoy time with my partner and our two kids, with a small sliver of time devoted to pottery. Thank you for your consideration.",1,1728399671.0,PubTips,0,1.0,False

For context I was originally deficient, got put on a 50,000iu once a week dose for 4 months, switched to 2000iu maintenance dose for the past 6 months. Vit D has changed my life. I never expected it to impact me so profoundly. 

However I did notice a couple times when I tried stopping, around 2 week mark I would get like a dark cloud of depression and no energy. My doctors gaslight that it’s not possible but this has happened every time I stop it around 2-3 week mark and is an extremely familiar SAD depression. 

Anyways I started taking it again and my anxiety gradually got really bad over the past 2 months (I chalked it up to my job) until it got to the point of literally daily panic attacks, sensation of suffocation, heart pain, and even towards the end genuinely getting scared I was going to “go crazy”. I stopped everything-coffee at first, not really a change, then Vit d, and to my terror: all symptoms went away. 

I have basically become a new person because of this supplement & now i realize it’s making me literally feel like I’m crazy and going to die?! Everything was fine while on 50000iu and 2000iu for months but suddenly it seems I’m completely intolerant? 

Anyways read about mag glyc so started taking that and stopped vit d for about a month. Got back on it, felt incredible first day, second day breathlessness and worst panics attack of my life. 

I’ve tried this 2 other times and it doesn’t matter I’ve ever taken 2000mg mag and still have symptoms. 

Last night I tried only 400iu & 125 mag didn’t get breathlessness, felt energy and happy, but noticed extreme spasing that was kinda scaring bc of how violent it was falling asleep. Based off all my symptoms I think it’s obvious it’s low mag, but why aren’t they countering eachother? It seems no matter what I get bad symptoms either way but I am diagnosed SAD and it’s fall… 

I’m so sick of going back and forth and feeling like I somehow got addicted to vit d. It’s genuinely pissing me off that a damn supplement can make me feel so great but also cause something like panic attacks?? Can anyone else relate? Please let me know what helped you?

I was prescribed 10mg IR adderall 1x a day by my PCP and I started it this morning. I only took a 5mg half of my dose just to feel it out, around 7:15am. I also take 10mg of buspirone 2x a day for anxiety.

Immediately started feeling a sense of calm and clarity, Skipped out on coffee while i felt things out. Actually started feeling tired an hour or two later once the initial burst leveled out. Now i'm sipping gently on some coffee. 

I'm debating on going ahead and taking the other 5mg around noon once I eat lunch. My appetite is still normal which is nice, I'm sure once i'm taking the full dose that might change. I'm not super concerned about that part since i'm good about keeping an eating schedule even when i don't have an appetite.

I'm not feeling like i'm fully getting the intended effects, I definitely feel more focused and brain feels less staticy, I probably would have been fine taking the full 10mg but i like to ease into meds like this.

 my only slight concern is that he gave me Instant Release and only has me taking it 1x a day. Would it be a good idea to take the split dose and do 5mg 2x a day instead for a little sustain? or just take the 10mg in the mornings and see about upping to 10mg 2x a day after this first 30 day test run he has me on?

I want to give us the best chance possible of success in this first cycle. (Although I know that it's largely out of my control at this point!) I've been trying to sleep enough, maintain my regular exercise (jogging three miles a couple of times a week, which the clinic says I can keep doing) and eat a healthy diet.

So I always joke with my husband to keep his eyes peeled at the airport incase we see from someone from the show, never thinking it would actually happen.

Well this morning I was there solo and going through security. I noticed a blonde woman a bit behind me and I was thinking “wow she looks really familiar” and then I realized HOLY SHIT IT’S JANELLE. 

I suddenly felt very nervous. It was a mix of seeing someone IRL I’ve watched on TV for over a decade, and also a bit because my bag got selected for extra screening and I couldn’t remember if I took my weed out or not.

Turned out it was fine, they just were wondering what the hell my Swiss turkey wraps in a cooler bag were. I made it through security and crossed paths with Janelle as we were putting our shoes back on at the end and I nervously said “hi Janelle!” She smiled and said “hi” back. Then I said “I’m a big fan” and she smiled again and said “thank you!”. 

I wanted to say more and/or ask for a picture but I figured if she wanted to talk more, she would have, so I respected her space and left it at that. Can’t imagine how hard it is to have Kody Brown as your ex, so the less trouble I can give her - the better.

After that I grabbed some coffee, then about 30 mins later I headed to my gate and I saw her at hers as I passed by on the moving sidewalk. I saw her board the plane in group 1, like the queen she is 💅.

Well that’s my story about a very brief interaction with Janelle at the airport that I somehow managed to turn into several paragraphs. Thanks for reading🫡.

Used to be super fit and athletic pre 2020. 
Gained 30 ish lbs in 4 years. Sloow gain when as a former fit person you don’t notice until nothing in your closet fits outside of your gym fits. I was exceedingly sedentary at this time. I used to run, lift, ride my horses competitively, surf, casual beach volleyball & went to nothing besides 2x a week Olympic lifting. The dirtiest of bulks by accident. 

Lost about 15 from HW of pushing 180lbs by not tracking but being more conscious of emotional eating (loss of a parent and some hard times in my professional life and personal life.
No kids no pregnancy - the weight is all just depressed, stressed eating an extra pastry or fancy whole milk coffee or that extra bit of crown lamb roast. 

Was anorexic / EDNOS 14-27 and underweight. Under 130 often around 115lbs. 

27-29 was in the best shape of my life at 145-150. 

I have a lot of muscle mass & am strong for a woman (grip strength is off the charts for women and I can deadlift 1.5x body weight - when I’ve not been in a lifting gym for 3 years) I can see muscle lines sometimes under this thin layer of fat not hard dense but like jiggly fat.

weight fluxes about 1 lbs up / down from 165
Measurements are down 1/4 inch everywhere except bust line which is already very narrow (31.5 inches)

I recently started a weekend class to learn a new language. At that class, I met this girl (let's call her Sara) who I assumed was a bit younger than me (I guessed 22-25) and we soon became friends.

She was nice, we helped each other with our classwork and we had a lot of hobbies in common. About a month ago I found out that she was actually 19 (20 this December) and I was a little shaken up, but just continued to be friends with her.

Last week we were having coffee and she confessed her feelings for me, I told her that she was too young for me, but that I loved her as a friend. But really, I am madly in love with her. I love spending time with her, I love talking to her and I love how effortlessly fun we are together.

Thing is when I was 19, I met a 27 year old woman who I got engaged to about 2 months after we met. She was extremely abusive and derailed my life. At one point, she almost cut my balls off because I said something she didn't like. Another time she faked a pregnancy and played it off as a joke 2 weeks after telling me and me getting excited.

Prior to this, I was a male model, at the top of my class and had a good life, pretty sure she wanted to ruin it all and I let her.

The age gap between my ex and I was 8 years and 2 months. The age gap between me and Sara is 7 years and 6 months. The ages are very similar. Although I can never think of hurting Sara in any way and I would go out of my way to protect her.

I love her, but I don't want to do anything that would inadvertently hurt her and derail her life the way my ex derailed mine.

Edit- was not expecting this to be this divisive. I'm not looking for advice but I do appreciate all perspectives. I'm going to do what I feel is right, regardless of what people say.

As for it being 'weird'... Society didn't give a shit when it was an older woman abusing me. Overall negativity seems to be a lot less when it's an older woman and a younger man, so I frankly don't give a shit about society :)",0,1728399117.0,TrueOffMyChest,47,0.39,False

Back then she was single and childless like me, loved books and movies like I do so we bonded quickly over that. It's always been a laid back friendship, thus if we had to cancel or change the timing of our meet-up it was never a biggie. Granted, she is shy so my relationship with her never ran as deep as my friendships with my high school friends whom I know better than myself, but I was content to meet for dinner or coffee to discuss our readings and favorite authors.

The problem, if you want to call it that, consists of the fact that around 7 years ago she met her husband and quickly fell pregnant. Soon after that, they got married and got a place together. I will say that at first, I was happy about the changes in her life, she seemed happy and very much in love. It was after she had the first kid and quickly got pregnant and had kid number two that things began to take a turn.

I want to be clear that I am not against people finding a partner or having a family, all the more power to them if that makes them happy. But my friend's life revolves absolutely around her kids and husband. This meant that when the youngest was still napping, we could only meet at a certain time of day and the meeting was planned around her youngest. We would meet at kid friendly cafes and restaurants or outside on the play ground if the weather permitted. While the kids were really young, I totally respected her need to bring the kids, hard to find a sitter and all of that. However, as the kids have gotten older, I have become less understanding of her need to bring the kids everywhere. For some reason, she shies away from asking her parents, husband or sister who has kids of a similar age to babysit. Not to mention her hoard of nieces who could probably be asked to see to the kids for a couple of hours. She prefers to bring the kids. Given the fact that I don't have a home that is child friendly, I cannot invite her home for takeout and pizza nor can she invite me to hers because hubby has a strict schedule, goes to bed early and such.

Thus, because I often work afternoons, it is hard to find a time to meet. Weekends are family and relaxation time for her family so that is often out when I am often free then. Thus, I have begun to instinctively draw away from her and make plans with other friends that are single or do not mind finding a sitter for a night to meet the girls, my friends who are essentially more flexible. The nail in the coffin came this summer when I held my birthday and she allowed the elder child to run around freely with no attempt made to control her son... She keeps asking to meet but I am happy to let the friendship die out, even knowing it's probably her only one left? I will add that she is a lovely and kind friend who listens attentively when she is not chasing one of her kids which is why I haven't nipped this in the bud yet.

1fz1f5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/police/comments/1fz1f5x/spycams_in_our_home/,Spycams in our home,"I can't beleive this actually happened to us!

A friend brought a spycam into our home without us knowing...

Story: 

My bf and I have been living together for over 3 years. We have been hosting bbq/steak nights on Friday nights. We usually invite between 2 to 7 people. We eat, drink and play games. Lots of fun.

An old highschool friend of my boyfriend moved back in town due to seperation with his girlfriend. Lets just call him John for the sake of the story. I personally barely knew him, but we invited him to our Friday fun nights anyways. He even invited us back once to his father's house where we enjoyed the hottub. His seperation was quite sudden and we all felt bad for him and we were glad to have another player for our games. 

One of the Friday nights, John said his phone was dying. I always keep a box full of chargers for our guests when they need one. So I was very happy to help him and gave him a charger. He said it didn't work, that his phone wasnt charging. So I offered a second charger and he refused it, saying he'll just grab the one in his car. I thought it was funny because the wall charger is the one my boyfriend uses everyday, so it works. But thought maybe it is just the cable that is getting old. 

A week passes by, my bf is out of town. I noticed on the coffee table in our living room, a wall charger but only I knew it looked different from the ones we own. So I took a good look at it and it looked like there was a camera on it! But at first I assumed it was that little red light that old plugins use to have. 

So I tested it, plugged it, and it didnt light up. I googled the serial number from the back and the results instantly showed that it was a spycam.

Not realizing where it came from, I was worried my boyfriend was trying to spy on me while he was out of town. That would have been so out of character of him, and would have been a deal breaker for me. 

I managed to take out the sim card and uploaded the footages on my laptop. No videos of us naked or anything thank god but videos of us playing games, and even videos of when my bf plugged it in the bedroom at the same spot he plug his phone everynight (nowhere where it can have good footage, basically facing a wall). It didnt look like he knew it was a spycam. I then asked in the groupchat if anyone forgot their charger to figure out to who it was. No one answered.

It's funny because my boyfriend's literal worst fear is hidden cameras in hotels lol. So he was really spooked when I showed that to him. But he kept looking in the sd card and found a random document and clicked on details and it showed John's ex's name! 

Our first assumption was that John's ex was spying on him. That he left with her spycam without knowing. We instantly called John and once we showed him the spycam he got all red and said he was super embarrassed. That he bought it to spy on his ex because he thought she was cheating. I thought it was weird because he works from home and would always be home when she is apparently... something didnt add up. He then said he forgot it was a spycam, just wanted to charge his phone in our house. Asked us if there was any other old footage in there but there wasnt... He also said that when we ask in the groupchat to who it belongs, that he thought we already knew it was a spycam by then. So he didnt want to admit it was his until we called him? 

We called our friends after, to explain the situation. No one reached out to John after, we just were waiting to see what would happen next. 

John blocked us... stop talking to us and started talking to other people saying we were really immature for excluding him over this. We thought that was super weird... 

I remember the night he plugged the charger, it was right in front of me. I was wearing a skirt. And I forgot to mention that his personality is very cocky and you can tell his ego his huge. I think he is guilty. He knew it was a spycam and brought it in our house and didnt want to admit it was his when it was time, until we called him! The spycam must have been in our home for at least a week.

It actually caused conflict in our relationship between me and my boyfriend. We suddently felt so unsafe in our home. My boyfriend had a hard time accepting that his friend would be capable of this and I had a hard time understanding how my boyfriend was still doubting John's intention. But then he remembered we went to soak in John's hottub and had to change in the bathroom, what if he had spycams in there??? Everyone in the group eventually came to conclusion that John is a bit twisted and unfortunately untrustworthy. 

I have been thinking of bringing this to court. It has been a few months since and we are still uncomfortable in our home. I heard John was dating a new girl and she has kids. I am scared for them and I don't know what to do. 

** I have to mention that the spycam doesnt work with an app. You can only see the footage if you take out the memory card. I think John knew he was coming back next Friday and was going to collect it then.

I was hoping for some insight, affirmation, whatever you have to contribute about some feelings and how to move forward. I'm two months into taking Spiro, I start E in a few weeks once T levels are down as I requested to be very slow to give time to reflect and experience changes gradually. I've been doing a lot of experimenting to find what I'm comfortable with presenting wise. I think I've made a lot of progress mentally and physically. While I'm not super comfortable in most dresses and stuff as it causes anxiety about being seen, I've found cutting necklines and cropping shirts to be very comfortable and feeling very beautiful like that. I've been wearing eyeshadow and liner, and shaving 1-2 times a day. However, I'm now starting to feel like I don't know how to go further. I want to be more feminine, and to be perceived as such. People close to me and some strangers see me and treat me and refer to me in feminine ways. But many customers (I work in coffee) still ""sir"" me, and a lot of well-meaning people whom I know in passer-by or in specific contexts give me the ""what's up man"" and whatnot. I'm a bit timid to say ""hey actually..."" and often revert to a more ""masculine"" way of interacting as a response. While, hopefully, usually, no ill intent, it kinda fucking sucks more and more as I work harder and discover more of myself in transition.

Are there any steps I can take to feel less stuck in place? In cases where it's worth doing, how can I ask people to address me in a way that aligns with myself without feeling fear about doing so? 

Also, I do have a wonderful LGBTQ therapist who has helped in these questions, but I'd like to hear more from others as well! :) ",1,1728397930.0,asktransgender,0,1.0,False

1fz15uv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1fz15uv/oab_and_anxiety/,OAB and Anxiety,"I (21F) have a symptom that has pretty much become the root of my anxiety, and it’s having to pee all the time. I truly believe that at the core there is a medical reason for this, but it’s being greatly exacerbated by my anxiety. I would love to hear if anyone relates to this experience.

I have always had to pee more than average, about every 2 hours. I have come to live with this and it’s fine. When I was first diagnosed with anxiety when I was 14, I actually had the complete opposite symptom which was that I could not pee in public bathrooms and would be scared to drive anywhere because I would not be able to go when we stopped. I eventually got over that. A few years later noticed a new symptom (this one I believe to be 100% health related) where sometimes if I had any drink other than water (usually a coffee, soda or Starbucks) about 30 minutes later I would have an episode where I would literally have to pee a full bladder every 5 minutes, and this would last for probably an hour. It got to the point where I would be so dehydrated yet would refuse to drink anything if I was out with other people. Anytime I would drink something and this didn’t happen, I would get too comfortable, and then the next time think I was okay to drink in a public setting and would have an episode again. I have actually found that this symptom has been GREATLY alleviated by me taking electrolytes: I had tried nearly every home remedy in the book and I truly believe this was caused by my body losing all its electrolytes and therefore it was in a vicious cycle of not retaining any liquid. This all leads me to my main symptom that is still impacting me today: anxiety urination. I now know that this is mostly anxiety related because it was not fixed by the electrolyte supplements. It happens pretty much exclusively in situations where I know I can’t use a bathroom: long car rides, theaters, going to sleep. I believe the fear stemmed from the episodes I was having after drinking diuretics, and my symptoms are especially bad in the morning. The second I start thinking about it, I will literally have to pee every 5-10 minutes even if I haven’t drank anything in hours. I know some people have this but they just get the feeling they have to pee, I actually have to pee. Even if it’s not a completely full bladder I still have to pee a decent amount literally every few minutes and it’s always completely clear. I also have to get up to pee at least 2 times a night even if I’m not anxious about anything at all. I also want to add that I had blood work done recently and everything was normal except for that my cortisol levels were scary high, I saw an endocrinologist and she thought it was diet related (not eating enough). I have improved my diet and added more protein but have not seen any changes to this symptom. I absolutely love to travel and at this point I am terrified for my 2 trips to NYC & London I have coming up for Thanksgiving and Christmas. I finally got an appointment to see a uro-gyno in between these two trips, but I’m not sure if it would be worth it to get into a psychologist before I leave at all (I haven’t been to one since I was 16 because my symptoms got a lot better until now) I would just really like to know if anyone else has experienced this and was able to find a remedy for how to live without this worry.

In a previous post I discussed why the **memory** of being held at gunpoint can act as an undue influence for a much longer period of time and with more severe consequences for the life of the individual, than the actual event. In this post I’d like to examine why memories of past experiences, in general, act as undue influences and therefore make the goal of acting ‘freely’ impossible.

**Is my behavior free if I am being influenced without my knowledge?** Imagine someone drugs my coffee without my knowledge. This drug alters my behavior in a meaningful way. Is my behavior under these conditions free?

Our behavior is based on 2 factors. The traits we have inherited from our ancestors and our life experience. These 2 factors combine to produce biases and patterns of behavior that we are mostly unaware of. My claim is that since we are mostly unaware of how the past experiences of our ancestors and our own lived experience have combined to create our biases and patterns of behavior we are in much the same position as if someone has drugged our coffee without our knowledge.

All of the sciences combined have brought us a long way down the road to self-knowledge. However, to think we have covered more than 10% of the journey is optimistic. I’m not saying the goal of free will isn’t possible at some point in the future. What I am saying is that free will is impossible while we are still at the beginning of our journey of self-knowledge.

To recap, the main question is: **Can my behavior be considered free while I’m being influenced without my knowledge?** I don’t expect to resolve the free will debate with this post, I just want to get a sense of how people answer the question of unconscious influences.

I have heard this saying several times. And I find it irritating and triggering. This is based purely on my own life journey. In my experience, if you are what you attract. Then why are most of the people in my life so extremely low in energy and empathy? Why are they so self centered? I believe I have a few healthy boundaries. I’m not expecting those specific people in my life to change per se. But for my personal sphere to even out. Where’s the balance? I give myself to my family. I work hard for them. If any of my friends need a shoulder or help, all they have to do is ask. Sometimes they don’t even have to ask, I’ll figure out they need help. Yet where are the people I can ask? Why can’t I bump into my own support sphere? Several of my friends are struggling so bad and I feel like it’s completely unfair with what they are dealing with. It’s not making them stronger it’s breaking them apart. On top of that, it leaves no space for them to give anything. This is going on for years! When will the world lay off? Is it really me or is the world just so extra? My dad and grandpa were like this too. Hard workers and would help people at the drop of a hat. But they didn’t get half of what they gave out to people. They just got used up. Sure people sang praises to my grandpa at his funeral. But he needed them when he was alive too. My best friends passed away too young. One had six children she left behind. She was a good sahm and the hospital let her die. The other was such a warm soul that her funeral was packed out the door standing room only. But she often felt so lonely in her own times of struggle whenever she called on people to help her. They both could’ve used more support.

While I can attribute my career and financial progression to hard work, opportune timing, luck, and risk tolerance, I'd be remiss to not mention how privileged I was to have a supportive family that instilled strong financial habits and educational values and their generosity helped me avoid undergraduate student loans.

I then went to law school, and because of key scholarships, only graduated with \~$120,000 in student loans.

I knew my 2L summer job would not lead to an offer. After a massive job hunt (\~500 applications, 25 coffee meetings) I landed a non-partner track attorney role in BigLaw. While associates made more than double (165K) my salary (65K), I needed a job and I figured it could lead to an opportunity. A couple years later, the opportunity struck and I joined a handful of departing partners to lateral to another firm, which lead to a large promotion and salary increase from 2015 to 2016. 

Five years later, I made another move and left BigLaw to start my own practice. Giving up BigLaw was tough: golden handcuffs, security of a salary and benefits, partner track, over $80,000 in bonus money t left on the table. Instead, I had to generate my own work, and only took home a % of what I worked on. I also had no assurance work would come with me and I knew I'd have at least 6 months of little to no income.

The gamble paid off. I now work fewer hours than BigLaw (600-900 billable hrs per year vs. 2000-2200) and make more money. But there are tradeoffs, especially since no income is guaranteed. No benefits. No major firm resources. I focus much more time on business development. We also have had a good economy and things can change quickly--whether its macroeconomic (recession, mass layoffs) or client changes.

For those keeping score, in 2015 and in 2022, I received $40,000 and $100,000 via inheritances, both went towards paying down student loans (2015) or my taxable brokerage account (2022).

**Assets**

* Taxable brokerage: $975,000
* Previous employer 401K (mix of both traditional and Roth): $445,000
* Solo 401k (mix of both traditional and Roth): $257,000
* Roth IRA: $117,000
* HSA: $59,000
* Checking/Savings/Business Checking: $65,000
* Crypto: $10,000

My investments are a mix of traditional (23%), Roth (24%), and taxable (53%). I'd like to have a healthy mix of all three for maximum flexibility.

**Debts**

Minimal debts aside from monthly credit card spend (paid in full) and an auto loan (6K) at 0% APR.

**Property**

I may buy property (primary, investment, or both) in the next 2-5 years. Since property is a nice-to-have (but not necessary), I place my down payment savings in my taxable brokerage for maximum growth. If the market explodes (like it has since I've been seriously investing) I can afford the house sooner. If it tanks, I'll just rent.

**Financial Strategies**

* r/churning for credit card bonuses
* Frugal living from 2013-2015 to prioritize getting out of debt (e.g., roommate, renting my apartment on Airbnb, cooking, limiting restaurant/bar spend)
* Roommates and a rent controlled apartment from 2013-2020. Most of my contemporaries were paying 2-3X my rent.
* Maxed IRA from 2015-present (via backdoor Roth)
* Maxed 401k employee contribution from 2016-present
* Maxed 401k after tax and/or employer contribution from 2018-present (via mega backdoor Roth)
* Maxed HSA contribution from 2017-present. I am paying out of pocket for medical expenses and saving receipts for future tax free withdrawals in 20-30 years.
* While I was a W2 employee, I set-up automatic investments to my taxable brokerage twice a month (following payday) staring at $500 and increasing each month until I felt the pain in my budget. In truth, I barely noticed the slight increases (especially with my salary increases and general frugal approach) which eventually led to $2,000 automatic investment every two weeks for a number of years.
* Since I incorporated my business and I now leverage various tax strategies (business expenses, PTET, etc). Also exploring whether to pursue a solo cash balance pension plan to increase my traditional contributions during my high earning years.

**Spending**

With Mint's demise, I stopped tracking monthly spend. For years, I set a target of staying under $4,000 a month (which was admittedly rare). Most months were $5,000-$6,000. Today, it's probably $8,000-$9,000 a month, but again I don't track it. I spend 3K a mont on rent, 1K a month for a car (payment, parking, insurance, gas) and too much on food and booze.

My general approach has been to focus more on money saved (and increasing income) over lowering my expenses. Mint, however, made me think about it a bit more--especially when I saw extremely high spend on food & dining, taxis & Ubers, and alcohol.

For a 5-year stretch, I'd pick a month each year to be intentionally frugal. It was a good reminder that despite increased expenses and lifestyle inflation, I could still bring expenses down significantly (I recall getting to $2,900 in monthly expenses once, which was over 50% rent).

**Goals**

No set FIRE number and no plans to change my approach. I will continue to max my IRA, 401K/MBD Roth, and HSA. 

I'd like to grow my business. I enjoy the work and the flexibility it provides. Growth will require a lot of work on my end with building a trusted team.

I also don't want to sacrifice my health or social relationships. I've spent considerable time focusing on improving health (5-6 days at the gym, 4 hours of cardio a week, mediation, healthier meals), but there's always more wood to chop.

1. **Non-toxic lining**: I want something as safe as possible, preferably stainless steel.
2. **Durability**: This needs to handle the occasional drop or bump without issue.
3. **Replaceable lids**: I'd like the option to swap out or replace lids over time.
4. **Leak-proof**: I need a cup with a truly secure lid that won’t spill when tossed in a backpack or bag.

Yeti seems to be everywhere right now, but I wonder if it’s just clever marketing rather than true quality. Has anyone tried all three brands? Any recommendations or tips would be super helpful!",1,1728396838.0,AskBeforePurchase,3,1.0,False
