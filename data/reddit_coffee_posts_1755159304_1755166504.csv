The US Department of Energy (DoE) has announced plans to issue funding opportunities totalling nearly $1bn to enhance mining, processing and manufacturing technologies essential for critical minerals and materials supply chains.

This initiative aligns with President Trump’s Executive Order to reinforce US energy, security and industrial competitiveness.

The proposed funding opportunities include the Critical Minerals and Materials Accelerator programme, which is expected to release a notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) of up to $50m.

This programme aims to advance technology development that can attract capital investment and promote domestic commercialisation.

Focus areas include the rare-earth magnet supply chain, semiconductor materials, lithium extraction and critical-material separation technologies for byproduct utilisation.

The Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management is also set to issue an NOFO supporting approximately $250m for US industrial facilities to produce mineral byproducts from existing processes.

This initiative targets the broader industry, and specifically the coal-based industry, aiming to pilot technologies at an industrial scale to mitigate technical and financial risks.

US Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said: “For too long, the United States has relied on foreign actors to supply and process the critical materials that are essential to modern life and our national security.

“Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, the Energy Department will play a leading role in reshoring the processing of critical materials and expanding our domestic supply of these indispensable resources.”

Furthermore, the Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains (MESC) plans to issue an NOFO of up to $135m to strengthen domestic supply chains for rare earth elements (REEs).

This project will focus on demonstrating the commercial viability of refining and recovering REEs from various sources such as mine tailings and waste streams within the US, requiring academic partnership and at least a 50% cost-share by recipients.

In addition, the MESC intends to issue an NOFO of up to $500m to expand critical mineral and materials processing, as well as battery manufacturing and recycling.

This funding will support facilities that process, recycle or use critical materials for manufacturing, including traditional battery minerals and other commercially important minerals. The recipient is required to hold a cost-share of at least 50% to be awarded the funding.

The Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy is also preparing to announce selections for its $40m programme targeting the recovery of critical minerals from industrial wastewater.

In related news, the US has [imposed sanctions](https://www.mining-technology.com/news/us-sanctions-congolese-militia-mining-entities-illicit-minerals-trade/) on a Congolese militia group, a mining company and two Hong Kong-based exporters due to their alleged involvement in the illicit trade of critical minerals.

These sanctions are part of the administration’s efforts to establish peace in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, which has been disrupted by violence from the Rwanda-backed M23 rebels.

# AUGUST 13th, 2025~The West Looks to Break China’s Grip on Critical Minerals

[The West Looks to Break China’s Grip on Critical Minerals](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/west-looks-break-china-grip-230000666.html)

https://reddit.com/link/1mpwjz7/video/wgvwsr9ggyif1/player

Western governments have recognized the need to intervene and safeguard their existing critical minerals supply chain from extinction in a market heavily dominated by China.Even more efforts will be needed in the West to establish new manufacturing capacities and ensure that production is at prices higher than those in China.

The U.S., Australia, and the EU have made the first steps to ensuring non-Chinese supply of critical minerals and [rare earths](https://oilprice.com/Metals/Commodities/Rare-Earth-Elements-What-They-Are-And-Why-They-Matter.html)—from bailouts in Australia to a direct government investment in companies in the U.S. But the West will need much more, in terms of support and investment, to tackle China’s dominance.Beijing holds a dominant global position in the supply of critical minerals and rare earths, but its grip on the value chain – minerals processing and magnet production – is even tighter.

The U.S., the EU, and Australia will require significant investment and federal incentives to establish a robust minerals refining supply chain at home or in allied countries, enabling the processing of raw materials and challenging China’s dominance. This will likely require billions of dollars and years to build processing capacities that rival China’s decades-long strategic positioning in mineral refining, its access to materials in Africa, and its cheaper labor and construction cost.

Despite major deals and government support in the West for building domestic supply chains, China has raised its market share over the past few years, the International Energy Agency (IEA) [warned](https://www.iea.org/news/diversification-is-the-cornerstone-of-energy-security-yet-critical-minerals-are-moving-in-the-opposite-direction) in its new annual report, Global Critical Minerals Outlook.China dominates refining for 19 of the 20 minerals the agency has analyzed, holding an average market share of around 70%.

**“Three-quarters of these minerals have shown greater price volatility than oil, and half have been more volatile than natural gas,” the IEA said, noting that major risk areas include high supply chain concentration, price volatility, and by-product dependency**.

China is also using its dominant position to restrict global supply through export controls in an increasingly protectionist and polarized world. And the West is considering ways to counter the Chinese grip on the supply chain that’s key to the defense, automotive, and clean energy industries.

Australia, for example, last week [bailed out](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Australia-Backs-Smelters-to-Boost-Critical-Mineral-Output.html) two struggling smelters ultimately owned by commodity trading giant Trafigura to help them convert into sites capable of producing critical minerals. Australia is also considering establishing price floors for rare earths to get new projects off the ground, Resources Minister Madeleine King told [The Australian](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/subscribe/news/1/?sourceCode=TAWEB_WRE170_a_GGL&dest=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theaustralian.com.au%2Fbusiness%2Fresources-minister-madeleine-king-flags-rare-earths-floor-price-and-national-offtake-agreements%2Fnews-story%2F55530151bb5276d250ea7aa11cb033d5&memtype=anonymous&mode=premium&v21=GROUPA-Segment-2-NOSCORE&V21spcbehaviour=append#:~:text=Resources%20minister%20Madeleine%20King%20lifted,focus%20on%20national%20offtake%20agreements.) last week.

**“Mechanisms for an appropriate price floor are under active consideration,” King said.**

In the U.S., rare earths miner and magnet producer MP Materials Corp [announced](https://mpmaterials.com/news/mp-materials-announces-transformational-public-private-partnership-with-the-department-of-defense-to-accelerate-u-s-rare-earth-magnet-independence) last month it had entered into a transformational public-private partnership with the Department of Defense (DoD) to accelerate the build-out of an end-to-end U.S. rare earth magnet supply chain and reduce foreign dependency.

**With a multibillion-dollar package of investments and long-term commitments from DoD, MP Materials will construct its second domestic magnet manufacturing facility, the “10X Facility”.**

For a period of 10 years following the construction of the 10X Facility, DoD has agreed to ensure that 100% of the magnets produced at the 10X Facility will be purchased by defense and commercial customers with shared upside.DoD will also become MP Materials’ biggest shareholder with a 15% [stake.International](http://stake.International) partnerships and collaboration are also part of the arsenal to reduce dependence on China.

Australia’s Lynas Rare Earths, the world’s top producer outside China, last month signed a preliminary agreement to collaborate with South Korean permanent magnet manufacturer JS Link to develop a sustainable rare earth [permanent magnet value chain](https://wcsecure.weblink.com.au/pdf/LYC/02970284.pdf) in Malaysia. The companies will work on an NdFeB permanent sintered magnet manufacturing facility near the Lynas Malaysia advanced materials plant in Kuantan.

Another Australian firm, Arafura Rare Earths, said this week that Export Finance Australia (EFA) has provided a non-binding conditional Letter ofInterest (LOI) relating to [potential further investment](https://wcsecure.weblink.com.au/pdf/ARU/02977512.pdf) to support Arafura’s Nolans project in the Northern Territory.

The German government is also appraising the project for potential support and could get both the Australian and German governments on board.

The West is taking the first steps toward breaking free from China, but it will take time and a lot of money, including government funds, to build a true critical minerals supply chain.

# AUGUST 13th, 2025~The Race to Break Beijing’s Chokehold on Rare Earth Elements

[The Race to Break Beijing’s Chokehold on Rare Earth Elements - The Soufan Center](https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2025-august-13/)

[AP\/PHOTO - Rick Bowmer](https://preview.redd.it/2aap7oipeyif1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c240772e5ed2a44511ed1b27e44aebd99e47397)

# Bottom Line Up Front

* **U.S. supply chain vulnerabilities related to rare earths came to the forefront during the escalation of the “trade war” between Washington and Beijing in the spring, which included a range of reciprocal measures.**
* **For decades, the Chinese Communist Party has cultivated a whole-of-government approach to securing its dominance in the supply chain of rare earths and other critical minerals, citing national security as its justification.**
* **The People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) dominance of the supply chain presents a strategic risk to U.S. and allied countries’ national security.**
* **How well Washington succeeds in breaking Beijing’s chokehold on rare earth elements will have a significant impact on the strategic competition between the U.S. and the PRC.**

***Rare Earth Elements (REEs) are a significant pillar of the strategic competition between the United States and the People’s Republic of China (PRC).*** *Rare earth elements comprise 17 metals that play a crucial role in the production of magnets used in many of today’s modern and emerging technologies, including smartphones, electric vehicle batteries, high-tech sensors, and missile systems. For decades, the PRC has maintained a dominant position in the mining and refining of rare earths. U.S. supply chain vulnerabilities related to rare earths came to the forefront during Washington and Beijing’s escalatory* [*“trade war”*](https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2025-february-7/) *in the spring, which included tit-for-tat measures, ranging from insurmountable tariffs to the PRC Ministry of Commerce imposing export restrictions on seven of the 17 rare earth elements. Preliminary deals were reached in May and June between the two largest economies, signaling a temporary truce, including Beijing easing export restrictions on rare earths. However, recent reports suggest that the dual-use export restrictions the PRC has imposed on rare earths have significantly impacted U.S. defense companies and drone manufacturers’ ability to source these* [*critical materials* ](https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2025-march-5/)*— showcasing the chokehold Beijing exerts on a supply chain vital to U.S. national security.*

*For decades, the* [*Chinese Communist Party (CCP)*](https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2025-july-29/) *has cultivated a whole-of-government approach to securing PRC dominance in the supply chain of rare earths and other critical minerals, all in the name of national security. Since the 1990s, the PRC has dominated the market, accounting for approximately 70 percent of the global mining and nearly 90 percent of the separation and refining of REEs worldwide. The dominant approach involves multiple domestic actors — the CCP, state-owned enterprises, the military, and research institutions — as well as a sophisticated policy toolkit — including export controls, price controls, subsidies, tax incentives, and foreign investments. All of these tools are deployed to ensure that the PRC can maintain strategic control of REEs. Xi’s signature foreign policy, the* [*Belt and Road Initiative*](https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2022-july-05/) *(BRI), has also been instrumental in securing strategic partnerships and investing in mineral-rich countries to fortify the PRC’s dominant supply chain of REEs as well as other critical minerals used for modern technology, such as Lithium and Cobalt. According to AidData, nearly $57 billion in loans and grants have been distributed to 19 BRI participant countries across Asia, Africa, and Latin America — such as Kazakhstan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Peru — primarily for the so-called “upstream” (extraction operations) of copper, nickel, lithium, cobalt, and REEs.*

*This stands in sharp contrast to the U.S. government approach, which can be categorized as more short-term thinking and reliant on global market and free trade practices. The U.S. market-driven approach to industrial policy, coupled with a focus on return on investment and stringent environmental regulations surrounding mining and processing, gave the PRC the upper hand. It is also likely that the U.S. government underestimated the risk of strategic resource dependencies when it comes to REEs.*

*REEs are indispensable to a country's technological, economic, military, and energy security. The PRC’s dominance of the supply chain poses a strategic risk to the national security of the U.S. and allied countries. Beijing has historically weaponized the REEs supply chain to put political pressure on adversaries. For example, during a territorial dispute in 2010 between the PRC and Japan, Beijing imposed a two-month export ban on REEs, which had a significant impact on Japan's manufacturing industry. Apart from the economic and energy security risks inherent in the PRC weaponizing the REEs supply chain to choke off U.S. access, the current situation presents significant risks to military readiness. REEs are essential for high-performance magnets used in key aspects of U.S. defense infrastructure, including missile, satellite, and GPS systems, as well as fighter jets and submarines. Recent reports of PRC-imposed dual-use export restrictions on REEs impacting U.S. defense companies and manufacturers illustrate the serious vulnerability in U.S. defense posture that would only be exacerbated during a hypothetical conflict with the PRC. On July 28, a bilateral meeting took place in Stockholm, Sweden, aimed at negotiating a durable agreement ahead of the looming August 12 deadline. Only hours before the August 12 deadline, the Trump administration and the CCP announced a 90-day extension of the ""truce"" to continue negotiations, with the new deadline to reach an agreement set for November 10. However, such an extension is unlikely to alleviate the pressure on the U.S. defense sector to source REEs amid dwindling supplies. The PRC still retains the ability to slow down access when it deems strategically beneficial to do so.*

*While the U.S. seemingly has woken up to the dangerous reality of PRC supply chain dominance of REEs, a solution still appears years, if not decades, away. In 2024, guided by the National Defense Industrial Strategy, the Department of Defense outlined the goal of developing a complete “mine-to-magnet"" supply chain for REEs to meet the country’s defense needs by 2027. And while investments have been made to this end (over $439 million since 2020 toward the domestic supply chain), structural issues still hinder the development of an independent supply chain in the foreseeable future. While the U.S. possesses REE deposits and resources, issues related to land ownership, environmental regulations, and years-long litigation processes make U.S. mine development lengthy and costly.*

*A recent report by S&P Global suggests that the timeline for U.S. mine development is the second longest in the world, averaging 29 years. And mining is only half (and the easier part) of the equation in the REE supply chain. Separation and refining are critical components to producing the magnets needed, and it is a highly lengthy, technically complex, and costly process to bring a REE processing plant online.*

*Taken together, despite recent efforts to bolster the domestic supply chain, the U.S. will likely continue to play catch-up for the foreseeable future. In the short term, Washington will likely turn to allies and partners to diversify its REE supply chain. Countries such as Australia, Saudi Arabia, Japan, and Vietnam have announced initiatives and investments in mining, processing, and magnet manufacturing. Potential REE deposits in Ukraine and the Nordic countries could provide the U.S. with alternative avenues; however, the reality of mining and processing in these regions could be decades away. Washington’s diplomatic and economic support for initiatives outside the U.S. will be crucial in diversifying the U.S. supply chain and ensuring the strategic independence of allies and partners, preventing them from becoming dependent upon the PRC. How well Washington succeeds in breaking Beijing’s chokehold on REEs could have a significant impact on the strategic competition between the U.S. and the PRC.*

# Why NioCorp Is More Than Just Rare Earths & Magnets!

  
**NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project is rapidly emerging as the most strategically significant critical mineral development in the United States, offering vertically integrated production of not just rare earth elements (REEs) for magnets, but also scandium, niobium, and titanium — all essential to aerospace, defense, and clean energy.** Unlike projects focused solely on magnet materials, NioCorp’s portfolio supports high-performance alloys for hypersonics, space systems, EV platforms, and naval technologies. Its scandium-aluminum alloys are poised to transform structural components across multiple sectors due to their strength-to-weight advantages, weldability, and fatigue life — perfectly aligned with Ford, Stellantis, Lockheed Martin, and other innovation leaders.

**With full U.S. ownership, DFARS compliance, and a high degree of permitting maturity, NioCorp stands as a secure, domestic alternative to foreign-dominated supply chains.** If its upcoming Definitive Feasibility Study (Q4 2025) and current infill drilling campaign (completing Aug 2025) confirm expected outputs, the project could supply \~150 t/year of scandium and robust volumes of niobium and titanium by 2028 — giving the U.S. unprecedented supply security in materials critical to defense and advanced manufacturing. Niobium (for HSLA steels and superalloys) and titanium (and TiCl₄ for ultra-pure aerospace applications) are foundational to modern military systems, jet engines, and even space-based platforms.

**NioCorp is already embedded in early-stage qualification pipelines, with samples sent to U.S. national labs, defense-linked initiatives like Project Pivot, and aerospace primes including Boeing and IBC.** The company is reportedly in active discussions for government-backed offtake agreements — including with DoD and EXIM — and is drawing interest from strategic allies and sovereign funds, such as the UKERF and Saudi PIF. These moves position NioCorp to secure project financing by early 2026, begin construction shortly thereafter, and deliver first production by mid-2028 — in lockstep with rising global demand for clean tech and military-grade materials.

**In short, NioCorp is not just a magnet play — it’s the leading U.S.-based, multi-mineral supplier capable of reshaping strategic supply chains from the ground up.** As geopolitical tensions rise and industrial policies shift toward resilience and traceability, NioCorp’s integrated model offers a compelling solution: domestic critical mineral production, full compliance, diversified output, and near-term scalability. If execution matches trajectory,

 **NioCorp will be indispensable to the U.S. industrial base and a linchpin in the global race for material dominance by 2028 and beyond**.

Any idea what could be causing this? ARC is the only app affected. For context, I’m scaling resolutions with BetterDisplay, but I don’t think that’s the issue.

Hit the gym for 2 hours. Read 50 pages a day. Completely overhaul my diet. Go from zero to hero in a week.

You know what happened? I'd burn out in 5 days and quit everything. So I decided to take a step back. And start from the bottom. 2 years later I've read over 20 books and have lost 20kg.

Here are the 9 stupidly simple habits that transformed my life one tiny step at a time:

* Habit 1 - Read 10 pages every morning. Not 50. Not a whole book. Just 10 pages with your coffee. That's 3,650 pages a year. About 12-15 books. You'll accidentally become one of the most well-read people you know.
* Habit 2 - Did 10 push ups the moment I woke up. Before checking your phone. Before coffee. Before anything else. It's not about getting ripped. It's about proving to yourself that you can do hard things first thing in the morning.
* Habit 3 - Writing down what I'm grateful for. Takes 2 minutes. Rewires your brain to notice good things instead of only problems. After 6 months, you'll be the person who finds silver linings while everyone else complains.
* Habit 4 - Drinking water before doing anything. 2 glasses of water when you wake up. Before coffee, before anything. Your brain is dehydrated after 8 hours of sleep. Feed it water first, stimulants second.
* Habit 5 - Making the bed Sounds stupid. Works incredibly well. You start every day with a completed task. You end every day coming home to something neat and organized.
* Habit 6 - Daily walks after a meal. Not a workout. Just a walk around the block. Better digestion, improved mood, clearer thinking. Plus you'll accidentally get 8,000+ steps a day.
* Habit 7 - Phone in another room at night. Charge it somewhere else. Use an actual alarm clock. Better sleep, better mornings, less mindless scrolling. Your future self will thank you.
* Habit 8 - Learned everyday. A word. A fact. A skill. Anything. Watch a 5-minute YouTube tutorial. Read a Wikipedia page. Ask someone to teach you something.
* Habit 9 - Planned the day before. Spend 5 minutes writing down your top 3 priorities for the next day. Wake up with purpose instead of decision fatigue.

It took sometime to fully integrate all this habits but I'm so glad I pushed through. I hope I motivate you to do the same as well.",1,1755165736.0,TheImprovementRoom,0,1.0,False

I tried waking up earlier, working longer hours, and filling every free minute with productivity hacks. It left me feeling more burned out than ever.

But then I tried something different: each week, I picked just one tiny habit to focus on. Nothing too big or complex, just a small shift. Some weeks it was:

* Pausing for 2 minutes before checking my phone
* Drinking a glass of water before coffee
* Taking a 5-minute walk when stress hits

It wasn’t about perfection, it was about consistency. Over time, those tiny habits added up, and I started feeling less overwhelmed and more in control.

Hailee's POV

 

I have two secrets. Two deep, dangerous secrets the people of the Full Moon Pack don't know. One—if they ever found out—would make them bow and worship me. The other? They'd be too afraid to even look me in the eye. But I've kept both to myself, pretending to be the weak omega, the cook's daughter no one notices.

 *1*

Only two people know. My mother—and Lila, my best friend. I told Lila one of them two months ago, and thankfully, she didn't treat me any differently. Just two omega girls, still best friends.

 *3*

""Hailee! You're running late! Didn't you mention you have a test?"" my mother's loud yelling echoed from downstairs.

 

Rolling my eyes, I stared at myself one last time in the mirror. I wasn't pretty enough to be noticed, nor plain enough to be invisible. I was just there.

 

A mess of wavy, deep auburn hair framed my face, the strands falling past my shoulders like wildfire in motion. My eyes were the color of the sky, sometimes silver when the light caught them just right—and my skin, pale and speckled with faint freckles, looked almost delicate. I had a small scar just beneath my left eye, a faded reminder of a childhood accident I didn't like talking about.

 

I ran my fingers through my tangled hair, pulled it into a quick braid, and grabbed the worn-out backpack by the bed. The straps were fraying, and one of the zippers didn't close all the way, but it held what I needed: my books… and the small locket I never took out in front of anyone. Not even Lila.

 

""I'm coming!"" I yelled back, slinging the bag over my shoulder and hopping down the stairs two at a time.

 

My mother stood in the kitchen, apron dusted with flour, wiping her hands on a cloth. Her eyes met mine. She looked tired, a little worried, but proud. She handed me a wrapped sandwich and a bottle of water.

 

""Don't look for trouble today,"" she whispered. ""No matter what.""

 

I nodded. We never talked about the secrets out loud, but she always had a way of reminding me to stay out of trouble.

 

I left through the back door, not wanting to run into any of the ranked wolves. They always had something cruel to say, especially Alpha Dominic's daughter, Clara. She hated that I existed, and even more that Lila chose to hang out with me instead of her.

 *2*

The school building came into view as I stepped onto the main road, and like clockwork, Lila appeared beside me with her usual lopsided grin and two steaming cups of instant coffee.

 

""Look who's alive and not in a coma from oversleeping,"" she teased, handing me one. ""You owe me.""

 

I took the coffee, feeling grateful. ""I'll repay you in hugs and sarcasm.""

 *4*

We both giggled as we made our way toward the school entrance, the scent of freshly cut grass and blooming flowers mingling with the usual teenage chaos. Our school, Moonridge Academy, stood tall like a castle, its stone walls and towering gates a clear sign of its importance, not just to our pack, but to every pack in London.

 *1*

It wasn't just any school. It was the biggest and best in all the werewolf territories around here, built right at the heart of the Full Moon Pack. Students came from far and wide—especially from elite families. Alphas' kids, Betas' kids, Gammas' kids… they all walked the same halls as we did. And somehow, they let us—lowly omegas—attend too.

 *2*

Of course, it wasn't out of kindness. It was a strategy. They needed the best minds, the best fighters, and the best pawns. So even if you were an omega, if you had something valuable to offer, you were in. Barely.

 

""I heard something crazy yesterday,"" Lila said as we passed through the school gates, her voice dropping to a whisper just for me. ""And I mean crazy crazy.""

 

I arched a brow. ""Crazier than the time Clara tried to flirt with the Beta's son from the Blood Stone Pack and got rejected in front of everyone?""

 

""Worse,"" she said, her eyes gleaming with gossip. ""I heard Alpha Linton's son—you know that Alpha from the Nightshade Pack?—he's transferring here. Like, for his final year.""

 

My footsteps stopped for a second. ""Really?""

 

Lila nodded eagerly. ""Yes. His son's name is Caelan or Callum or something, I don't remember. But I've heard he's insanely powerful—and also hot.""

 

I rolled my eyes. ""Of course that part matters.""

 

""It always matters,"" she said, bumping her shoulder into mine playfully. ""But get this—there's more. Apparently, another Alpha's Daughter is transferring too. Alpha Zach's.""

 

My eyes widened. ""Alpha Zach? As in Alpha of the Dark Claw Pack?""

 

She nodded again. ""Yes. His daughter's name is Lucie. And let's just say… I heard she is the main character type. Always snooping.""

 

Great. As if our school didn't already have enough egos walking around in perfectly tailored uniforms.

 

""And you know what this means, right?"" Lila added, her voice barely above a whisper. ""More drama."" She teased, and I playfully rolled my eyes at her while she giggled.

 

Reaching my locker, I opened it and took out a textbook, but then I froze.

 

I could feel someone behind me. That familiar, heavy feeling that made my skin crawl. Slowly, I turned around.

 

And there he was.

 

Nathan. Our Alpha's son.

 

He stood there with his arms crossed and a smirk on his face like he owned the whole world. His bright-green eyes locked onto mine, and for a second, I forgot how to breathe. He looked annoyingly perfect. Messy black hair, strong jawline, and a body that screamed Alpha. He had just turned eighteen last week, and the entire pack threw a huge party for him.

 

But sadly, he didn't find his mate. And that made his attitude get worse.

 

Nathan is my nightmare.

 *5*

Since the moment I came to the Full Moon Pack four years ago, he's made my life miserable. He's mean, rude, and treats me like I'm less than nothing. And to make it even worse, he forced me to be his errand girl. I fetch his stuff, carry his notes, and do whatever he wants.

 

""Morning, sunshine,"" Nathan said in his usual mocking voice. ""Rough night?""

 

I clenched my teeth. He wanted me to fight back, to get angry—but I wasn't going to give him that satisfaction.

 

""Do you need something?"" I asked, trying to sound bored.

 

""Of course,"" he said and threw a crumpled paper at me. ""Copy my notes from yesterday. Make them neat. No mistakes.""

 

I caught the paper and held it tight in my fist.

 

I forced a smile, bitter and fake. ""Of course. Anything for you… your highness.""

 

He scoffed gently, and patted my head like always. But except this time, his hand lingered for a second too long. I looked up, expecting mockery. But he wasn't even looking at me. He looked… lost, but before I could dwell on it, he turned around and strolled away.

 *1*

Lila moved to my side, her face etched with a frown. ""I swear, one day I'm going to punch him. Right in the face.""

 

I sighed and took a deep breath. ""Just two more months… It'll all be over,"" I said, and Lila nodded, understanding exactly what I meant.

 

We turned to head to class, but before I could enter, the principal came out from a corner.

 

""Hailee. My office. Now,"" he said firmly, not even waiting for a response as he turned away.

 

My heart sank. The last time I got called to his office, I was suspended.

 

Now? I had no idea what kind of trouble I'd landed in—but I had a bad feeling.

 

# CREATORS' THOUGHTS Sugarlitics

Okay, let’s talk about it—because I know some of you are wondering how they’re texting, calling, and snapping photos in a world that’s supposed to be a century in the past.

I know traditionally, stories set 100 years ago don’t have smartphones. But I didn’t want to box this one into those rules. Why?

Because phones make things feel real. A call at the wrong time. A text that changes everything. A photo that shatters someone’s trust. You know those moments—they hit hard. And I wanted those moments in this world, too.

Also… let’s be honest—this is a fantasy story. We’ve got werewolves, alphas, powers, secrets… the whole thing’s already outside the lines of reality. So why not bend time a little, too?

At the end of the day, this is my world. And in my world, 100 years ago still had drama, danger, love—and yeah, phones too.

So don’t think too hard about the timeline. Just dive in, feel the emotions, and let the story take you wherever it wants to go.",1,1755165429.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

Three inches in front of home plate it was up around your head, and the catcher wound up catching it by your feet. Damnedest curve I've ever seen."" -- Dodgers pitcher Rex Barney 
 
On this date in 1952, [Johnny Schmitz](https://images.findagrave.com/photos/2011/277/77647472_131786347800.jpg) made his first start with the New York Yankees, a complete game win over the Washington Senators. He would make his second -- and last -- start as a Yankee five days later, getting pounded for three runs on four hits and a walk in a third of an inning against the Chicago White Sox. 
 
But what makes Schmitz worth remembering as a Yankee -- other than his unusual nickname, ""Bear Tracks"" -- were allegations from a Boston sportswriter that transactions involving Schmitz were proof that the American League was rigged in favor of the Yankees! 
 
Born in Wausau, Wisconsin, on November 27, 1920, [John Albert Schmitz](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/schmijo01.shtml) dropped out of high school in ninth grade. He became a local sensation for his pitching in American Legion baseball games, and at age 17 he began his professional career with the Hopkinsville Hoppers of the delightfully-named Kitty (Kentucky-Illinois-Tennessee) League, where he was a dominant 11-2 with a 3.44 ERA in 110 innings. 
 
Schmitz pitched three more seasons in the minors; his best season other than his first one was a 15-14 record and 3.28 ERA with the Madison Blues in 1940. The following year, after going 7-14 with a 4.87 ERA for the Brewers, the Chicago Cubs called him up for a September cup of coffee, and he was pretty good, 2-0 with a 1.31 ERA and 1.016 WHIP in three starts and two relief appearances. The following year he was 3-7 with a 3.43 ERA and 1.327 WHIP, but his season ended on August 1, 1942 as after an appearance against the Brooklyn Dodgers he reported to the U.S. Navy. 
 
He would serve until January 1946. Like many baseball players called into service, at first he played baseball for a military team on a base in the states. Later he was sent to the Pacific.
 
Schmitz returned and pitched five and a half more seasons with the Cubs; all told, he was 69-80 with a 3.52 ERA (108 ERA+) and 1.377 WHIP in 1,198 2/3 innings. As you can see from his peripheral numbers, he was better than a 69-80 record, but the Cubs were terrible. He had two All-Star seasons, 1946 and 1948; the latter was his best season, 18-13 with a 2.64 ERA (147 ERA+) and 1.169 WHIP, and he led the league in fewest hits allowed (6.9). But in 1949, he faded to 11-13 with a 4.35 ERA and 1.541 WHIP. Years later, Schmitz admitted that he had hurt his arm that season, but kept it to himself, as players often did in those days. 
 
His struggles continued for the next year and a half, and on June 15, 1951, Chicago traded him to the Dodgers in a big eight-player package headlined by Cubs four-time All-Star Andy Pafko. Indeed, Pafko and Schmitz were seen as such big gets for the Dodgers that there was early speculation that the top player going back would be 24-year-old center fielder Duke Snider. 

But of course Snider stayed in Brooklyn, and Cubs fans had to be satisfied with catcher Bruce Edwards, a career .256/.335/.390 hitter who had mostly been (and would remain) a backup, and three others of little consequence. The deal was so in favor of the Dodgers that an article in *The Sporting News* was breathlessly headlined: ""N.L. Shudders Over Fear of Runaway by Dodger Juggernaut."" 
 
The purpose of the deal, from the struggling Cubs perspective, was financial: an undisclosed amount of cash, and getting the salaries of Pafko and Schmitz off the books. 
 
At $17,000 a year, Schmitz was the third-highest paid player on the Cubs, behind only Pafko ($29,000) and Hank Sauer ($18,000). (Right behind him, at $15,000, was Roy Smalley, whose son would play for the Yankees in the 1980s.) Schmitz was paid like an ace but had been demoted to the bullpen after three disastrous starts,  giving up 13 runs on 15 hits and 12 walks in 12 innings; his relief work wasn't great either, with three runs on seven hits and three walks in six innings. 
 
The Dodgers were confident that the problem wasn't Schmitz's arm, but some sort of mechanical flaw that could be corrected. 
 
> ""A fellow who knows Johnny real well tipped us off as to what he was doing wrong. We had him pitch batting practice the first day he joined us and what our tipster had told us stuck out like a sore thumb. It may take a little while for him to straighten himself out, but once he does, he can provide just the pitching help we need down the long midsummer stretch."" -- Dodgers manager Charlie Dressen 
 
Maybe it was just wishful thinking, but Schmitz did improve after the trade... from an 8.00 ERA and 2.056 WHIP to 5.34 and 1.491. Trending in the right direction, at least. Schmitz still didn't confess to having an arm injury, but at least he recognized his fastball no longer had the same zip it once did, and that he had to adjust as a pitcher. ""I learned to pitch all over again,"" he later told the *Boston Daily Record.* 
 
He started the '52 season with Brooklyn, and once again his numbers were better, but only slightly. After 10 games he had a 4.32 ERA and 1.410 WHIP in 33 1/3 innings. The Dodgers had seen enough, and put him on waivers. The Yankees put in a claim, and traded minor league journeyman pitcher Wally Hood to Brooklyn to make the deal. To get Schmitz to the Yankees, every team in the National League had the chance to claim him; no one did. 
 
The Yankees had Schmitz for about a month. His first appearance as a Yankee, on [August 3, 1952](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/SLA/SLA195208032.shtml), didn't go well. 
 
With the Yankees up 6-0 in the bottom of the ninth against the Browns -- pitching for St. Louis was Satchel Paige, in relief of former and future Yankee Tommy Byrne -- starter Jim McDonald loaded the bases with nobody out on two hits and a walk. Schmitz then came on to close it out, and got the first out on a flyball not deep enough to score a run. The next batter doubled to knock in two, then Schmitz got a strikeout for the second out of the inning. The next batter singled to knock in two more, followed by a walk; suddenly it was 6-4 with the tying runs on base. Casey Stengel then went to reliever Bob Kuzava, who walked a batter to load the bases, and then -- no three-batter minimum in those days -- went to the fourth pitcher of the inning, Joe Ostrowski, who got the final out by retiring former Yankee prospect Clint Courtney. 
 
Schmitz pitched again three days later, entering in the seventh with the score tied against the Washington Senators. Once again it was a tough spot, with runners on second and third and nobody out. An intentional walk loaded the bases to set up the force at any base, and then a strikeout gave the Yankees some hope of a double play to NOBLETIGER the Senators. And they got the ground ball to second, but the Yankees only got one out of it; even worse, Phil Rizzuto made a rare throwing error to allow two runners to score. Schmitz didn't allow another run, but the Yankees lost it, 6-4.
 
Then came [August 14, 1952](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NYA/NYA195208140.shtml), with Schmitz making his first start as a Yankee, and his first appearance in Yankee Stadium. Staked to a 6-0 lead courtesy of a two-run double from Yogi Berra and RBI hits from Joe Collins, Hank Bauer, Mickey Mantle, and the Scooter, Schmitz didn't allow a run until two scored in the top of the fifth. He even helped his own cause with an RBI single in the top of the seventh, and the Yankees won it, 7-2. 
 
His next, and last, start as a Yankee didn't go as well, giving up three runs on four hits and a walk while only retiring one batter. It was back to the bullpen for the rest of the month, giving up one run on six hits and three walks in eight innings across four appearances. 
 
At the end of August, the Yankees dealt Schmitz to the Cincinnati Reds along with three minor leaguers (Jim Greengrass, Bob Marquis, and Ernie Nevel) and cash in exchange for Ewell Blackwell. 
 
Just as the Pafko deal had National League teams complaining about the Dodgers getting a star player for nothing, this deal had American League teams whining to the press about the Yankees. Blackwell — “The Whip"" — was a six-time All-Star, and it was inconceivable to the Yankees' rivals that he could be acquired for a player who, a month earlier, could have been claimed off waivers by the Reds! 
 
The truth was Ewell, like Schmitz, had abruptly and inexplicably lost it. Between 1946 and 1951, Blackwell was 76-65 with a 3.13 ERA (128 ERA+) and 1.256 WHIP, but so far this season he was 3-12 with a 5.38 ERA and 1.637 WHIP. Like Schmitz, to get to the Yankees every National League team had to pass on claiming Blackwell, and like Schmitz, no one wanted him. 
 
And also like Schmitz, Blackwell insisted there was nothing wrong with his arm... but there was. During an exhibition game a few years earlier, he felt a stabbing pain in his shoulder. It was never the same again. “I’d wind up and begin to deliver, and halfway through my delivery it would feel like somebody was sinking his teeth into my shoulder,” he later recalled. 
 
With the Yankees for the final month of the 1952 season, Blackwell gutted it out through two starts and three relief appearances with the Yankees, giving up just two runs (one earned) on 12 hits and 12 walks in 16 innings. He made one start in the World Series and was bombed for four runs on four hits and three walks in Game 5; the Yankees lost that game but won the series in seven. 
 
Meanwhile, Schmitz was now with Cincinnati. He had just three appearances -- two of them against his old team, the Cubs -- and didn't allow a run in five innings. At the start of spring training in 1953, Schmitz was traded again... back to the Yankees! 
 
Dave Egan, a sportswriter for the *Boston Sunday Advertiser*, was outraged: 
 
> “The powers-that-be in baseball, not content with having rigged four races in a row for the Yankees, already are busily engaged with rigging their fifth in a row.” 
 
He charged that the Yankees and Reds had schemed to make Schmitz a loaner for the last month of the season. He said the Yankees “annually defeat the rules of fair play and ordinary decency and good sportsmanship by purchasing pennants over the counter.” 
 
It sure seemed like an over-the-top reaction considering Schmitz had pitched a grand total of 15 innings for the Yankees and just five for the Reds. But to Egan, this incident was just the latest example of a pattern going back years. 
 
Between 1949 and 1952 -- despite the official trade deadline of June 15, which didn't change to July 31 until 1986 -- the Yankees added Johnny Mize from the Giants (August 22, 1949), Johnny Hopp from the Pirates (September 5, 1950), Johnny Sain from the Braves (August 29, 1951), Johnny Schmitz from the Dodgers (August 1, 1952), and Ewell Blackwell from the Reds (August 28, 1952). 
 
How did the Yankees do it? At the time, a player traded after the trade deadline had to be first passed through league waivers, so every team had a chance to claim him -- but only the teams in that league. 
 
When the Dodgers put Schmitz on waivers, all the National League teams had a chance to claim him, in reverse order of the standings. In this way, the second-place team could claim a player to prevent the first-place team from getting him. But with the Dodgers cruising to the pennant, no National League teams were interested. 
 
Once Schmitz cleared waivers in the National League, he could be traded to any team in the American League -- even the first-place Yankees, and the American League teams behind them in the standings couldn't do anything about it. The Yankees' ""double dip"" in 1952 of Schmitz from the Dodgers and Blackwell from the Reds finally convinced the other American League owners to do something, and that off-season a new rule was instituted that to trade a player after the trade deadline, he had to pass through waivers in *both* leagues, as the rule remains today. 
 
Schmitz's second stint with the Yankees was even briefer. He pitched in just three games, giving up one run in 4 1/3 innings, and then was released. He was claimed by the Washington Senators, where he would have a bit of a career resurgence -- 20-25, 3.38 ERA, 1.389 WHIP in 458 innings over three seasons. In 1954 and again in 1955 he threw shutouts against the Yankees. 
 
In 1956, Schmitz was traded to the Red Sox in a nine-player deal, but a foot infection in spring training limited his availability. He pitched just two games for them -- both against the Yankees, giving up two runs but none earned in 4 1/3 innings -- and then was sold to the Baltimore Orioles. There he finished his career, with a 3.99 ERA and 1.643 WHIP in 38 1/3 innings. 
 
He tried to prolong his career in the minors, pitching for the Toronto Maple Leafs in the International League in 1957 at age 36, then retired. He spent the rest of his days in Wisconsin, working as a greenskeeper on a golf course while ice fishing, hunting, and occasionally pitching in a semi-pro league. He died in 2011 at 90. 
 
**Holy Schmitz** 
 
* Johnny's nickname, ""Bear Tracks,"" came from the Size 14 footprints he left on the mound as he shuffled about between pitches. 
 
* In 2003, Schmitz described his repertoire as ""a curveball, fastball, change-'em-up, and a sinkerball."" He added he threw two kinds of curveballs, ""a big curveball and a change-up curve."" 
 
* While with the Cubs, Schmitz was teammates with Eddie Waitkus, who may have been the inspiration for Roy Hobbs in *The Natural.* Waitkus was an All-Star with the Cubs in 1948, and the next year was traded to the Phillies. Off to an even better start in 1949, on June 14 Waitkus and the Phillies were in Chicago for a four-game series. Ruth Ann Steinhagen, a 19-year-old Cubs fan who had been obsessed with Waitkus since 1947, booked a room in the same hotel, then invited Waitkus to visit her. When he stepped inside, she shot him. He survived and returned to baseball the following season. According to *Baseball's Natural: The Story of Eddie Waitkus* by John Theodore, Ruth would attend Cubs games with her best friend, Helen Farazis. Ruth was after Waitkus, and Helen wanted Schmitz: ""You trip him, and I will drag him to a cab, take him to Crown Point, and marry him,"" Helen joked. Ruth had darker plans for Waitkus. 
 
* Negro Leagues great Ted ""Double Duty"" Radcliffe remembered he and Satchel Paige played against Johnny Schmitz in an exhibition game during the war years. Schmitz was pitching for the Great Lakes Naval Training team, one of the best ""base"" teams during World War II. ""They had Feller, Johnny Mize, John Pesky, Johnny Schmitz,"" Radcliffe recalled. ""They beat the St. Louis Cards, who had won the pennant that year. But we knocked Schmitz out with five runs in the first inning, hit six triples that day, beat them 11-2. They wouldn't let us come back again."" 
 
* Schmitz was on the 1946 N.L. All-Star team, but didn't pitch. Two years later, he was on the team again, and would've been better off if left on the bench: He pitched to five batters, allowing three singles, a walk, and getting one out. The final straw was giving up a two-run single to pitcher (and previously forgotten Yankee) [Vic Raschi](https://np.reddit.com/r/NYYankees/comments/ptuvnt/no_game_today_so_lets_remember_a_forgotten_yankee/). 
 
* *The Sporting News* described Schmitz as ""a quiet, sensitive fellow"" who wilted under the abuse of fiery Cubs manager Frankie Frisch. Schmitz got along better with Casey Stengel, who it was said could sense which players he could ride, and which ones he shouldn't. 
 
* In 1954, the Washington Senators signed the 17-year-old Harmon Killebrew and brought him to cavernous Griffith Stadium for batting practice. ""It was 408 feet down the left field line,"" Killebrew recalled. ""I took batting practice there. They had Johnny Schmitz throw to me, and I didn't know who Johnny Schmitz was. He was throwing *everything* at me -- curveballs, sinkers, sliders, everything -- and I was hitting 'em up there in those seats."" 
 
* Schmitz never reached the post-season, but he came close several times. He would have been in the World Series with the Cubs in 1945, but was still in the Navy, even though the war was over by October. ""I was due to get out, but they worked on some kind of point system,"" Schmitz recalled years later. ""I didn't understand it then and I don't understand it now."" 
 
* He also was on the Dodgers in 1951, who were one out away from beating the Giants, but then Bobby Thomson hit a game-winning home run in the bottom of the ninth of the last game of the season. The famous ""THE GIANTS WIN THE PENNANT! THE GIANTS WIN THE PENNANT!"" Schmitz, watching from the bullpen down the left field line, said he knew it was gone as soon as Thomson hit it. ""It was heartbreaking."" 
 
* And he was on *both* teams that reached the World Series in 1952, the Yankees and the Dodgers, but ended that season with the fourth-place Phillies. 
 
* Finally, Schmitz began the 1953 season with the Yankees, who would repeat as world champions, then was traded to the fifth-place Washington Senators. 
 
* For his first seven and a half years in the bigs, Schmitz was with one team, the Cubs. Over his last six and a half seasons, he was with six teams. ""They used to give us travel money when we got traded. I made more money getting shipped around than I did playing,"" Schmitz recalled with a laugh. 
 
* Schmitz prided himself on being a ""Dodger Killer."" In 279 career innings against the Dodgers, he had a 2.94 ERA, 1.276 WHIP, and .622 OPS allowed, compared to a career line of 3.55, 1.392, and .692. All the more impressive when you consider for most of his career the Dodgers were one of the best teams in baseball. Still, despite his numbers, he was just 18-17 against them. 
 
* The All-Yankees From Wisconsin Team would include Tony Kubek (Milwaukee), Ryne Duren (Cazenovia), Bob Wickman (Green Bay), Shane Rawley (Racine), and Ben Rortvedt (Madison). 
 
* Schmitz wore \#40 during his first stint with the Yankees, and \#35 during his second one. \#40 was last worn by Luis Severino, but is probably most associated with Chien-Ming Wang, who wore it from 2005 to 2009. Andy Hawkins wore \#40 from 1989 to 1991, Fran Healy from 1976 to 1978, and Tippy Martinez from 1974-1976. It also was worn by previously forgotten Yankees [Lindy McDaniel](https://np.reddit.com/r/NYYankees/comments/18hi4ce/no_game_until_february_24_so_lets_remember_a/) and [Jackie Jensen](https://np.reddit.com/r/NYYankees/comments/13xfy09/no_game_today_so_lets_remember_a_forgotten_yankee/). Ewell Blackwell, the player who Schmitz was traded for in 1952, wore it both seasons he was with the Yankees. 
 
* \#33 is currently worn by Ryan Yarbrough. It was worn by Greg Bird from 2017-2019, Nick Swisher from 2009 to 2012, David Wells from 1997 to 2003, Melido Perez from 1992 to 1995, Ken Griffey Sr. from 1983 to 1986, and [previously forgotten Yankee Doc Medich](https://np.reddit.com/r/NYYankees/comments/rcmssj/no_game_for_the_foreseeable_future_so_lets/) from 1974 to 1975. 
 
* Of course no discussion of Schmitz would be complete without a reference to [Schmitts Gay Beer](https://youtu.be/hCOSejS1SSY?si=TvER5Awu9__81Fam).

Johnny Schmitz's brief time in pinstripes didn't make much of an impact in terms of the standings, but his coming and going and coming again to the Yankees led to a rule change that we still have to this day, requiring players who are traded after the deadline to pass through waivers in each league!

I know a lot of you agents and insurance professionals are still buying leads, then sitting at your desk with a cup of coffee, ready to dial cold and “warm” leads… only to spend HOURS calling for nothing, chasing the same recycled names everyone else is calling.

That’s just a gamble honestly. In business, you need certainty, speaking only with clients who are ready to be closed and deeply interested in your offer, service and the results you can deliver.

**You can’t sell someone juice if they’re looking for water.**

With that being said, what you need is an Inbound lead-generating pipeline. A lead generating pipeline that delivers you HIGH quality leads straight to your CRM. Leads that are interested in YOUR service, in YOUR company, and ready to book an appointment with YOU today.

Let me explain how this system can give you back your **TIME**, help you close more clients than you’ve ever imagined, and ultimately **SCALE** your business to the next level.

The system I’m going to share is one where you target with words. You might be like, words? Yep, words are the powerhouse of this system. If you can manage to make your words create emotions that move people to take action, this could be buying, booking, or more. Then you’ll have a winning system.

Words are a tool that must be EMOTIONALLY compelling to the reader and also make logical sense. With a combination of both, you can influence decisions and drive action.

You’ll use these words to craft a sales letter that does all the heavy lifting — **educating, filtering, and pre-selling.**

This is tricky given the fact that nowadays we have access to generative AI, but let me set this straight. AI cannot replicate emotions. You are the one who understands your audience, their struggles, and what truly moves them to act.

If you use ChatGPT to create your “Sales Letter” you are bound to fail. 

Now, in order to get this sales letter attention, we must send traffic to it. We will use Facebook ads for this, setting up a campaign optimized for leads.

What the sales letter will do is filter out bad prospects so that only those with genuine interest and the **FUNDS** to move forward will make it through. And you will do that by having your opt-in at the bottom of the page, to ensure the prospect has *consumed* your offer.

After the prospect opts in, redirect them to a booking page and boom — high quality leads. Have everything integrated so the information is sent directly to your CRM, notifying you instantly of **new** leads/appointments.

Then, just have appointment reminders go out until the scheduled date arrives, and close the deal...

And the best part?

You can have this system running **FOREVER** and scale even further by simply increasing the ad budget.

Best of luck to all of y'all. Go implement this for your insurance agency and watch how quickly your calendar fills up.

They're great for logging hours, but none of them gave me a real sense of what my coding time actually *meant*. It just felt like a simple timer, not a tool to help me understand my habits. They'd tell me I worked 8 hours, but never whether those hours were productive or if I spent half the time staring at the screen.

None of them would tell me what I want: 

*""Good job, you moron. You worked for 10 hours today, but for two of those hours you were just staring at the screen, contemplating whether to get another coffee.""*

So, I decided to write my own extension. I called it \[Extension Name\] and it does one simple but incredibly useful thing: it analyzes your true habits. Not just time, but also:

* **Your ""debug time"" vs. ""coding time""**: To figure out if you're a genius who writes bug-free code or a butcher who spends hours hacking things apart and stitching them back together.
* **Comments and commits**: It tells you if you're a tidy maniac or one of those criminals who never comments their code.
* **Errors:** How many times you've royally messed things up.
* **Multitasking:** It slaps you in the face with the number of times you've jumped from one file to another like a panicked bee.

It takes all this data and puts it together to create your very own **Personalized Developer Profile**. Maybe you're a ""Night Owl,"" someone who wakes up at 3 AM to write that one line of code you're missing. Or a ""Tinker,"" someone who's constantly experimenting. Or, well, a ""Coffee Addict.""

For now, it's open-source and free. You can find it on GitHub as a `.vsix` file. If you like the idea and think an extension that calls you an ""idiot"" is exactly what you need, I'll gladly put it on the marketplace.

I know outside there are lot of time trackers for VSCode, I just created mine for fun, not to sell it, so please, be kind.

I don't have a name for it yet, I was thinking something like ""DevDiary"", idk.

**Let me know what you think!** What should I add? I 'd like to enhance even more the programmer profile extraction.

I get depressive episodes, yes, no doubt about that. They are way more common than my (hypo)manic episodes and I've had them since I was a teenager. I feel like the amount of depressive episodes I get has potentially led to me being labeled BP2 over BP1.

My most intense (hypo?)manic episode (and one that was a little traumatizing honestly) was what led to my diagnosis. I could barely sleep but I felt great, I spent a lot of money on stuff that made no sense, I could suddenly do all my difficult work tasks in the space of a few hours with zero coffee, I started a new business (lol) and tried to make a career change, I became hypersexual, I engaged in risky behaviors, yadda yadda... The only reason I sought help was because of the sudden depressive crash - and then jumping right back up into the green a few days later. The difference in mood was so extreme, I knew something had to be wrong.

Here's the thing - it seems like the biggest difference between hypomania and mania is the length of the episode, and I can't remember how long that episode was. It felt like it lasted forever. I may have not been at ""peak"" for an entire week, but I was doing these behaviors long enough for me to tell my parents that I had suddenly become an early bird (aka being unable to sleep past 5am even though I stay up late into the night). I only speak to them once a week on facetime, so this must have been going on for longer than a week. I was freelancing at the time, so I didn't have a ""real"" job that the episode would have affected. I didn't go to the hospital, but due to the lack of sleep, I was a little worried that I may have to if the insomnia continued. I also felt like I was actually going insane and voiced this to my (slightly horrified) doctor. I've definitely had hypomania since then, and even in hypo I don't feel like I'm ""going insane"". 

It doesn't really matter if I'm BP1 or BP2, since my psychiatric treatment wouldn't change, but I feel like I may be downplaying the severity of my (hypo)manic episodes. Thankfully, now that I'm medicated, I haven't had another extreme upswing, but still. It's something I think about.

Have any of you considered that you might be BP1 instead of 2? Not asking for a diagnosis here, just trying to sort out my experiences compared to others'.",1,1755164071.0,bipolar2,0,1.0,False

I can try to ship them back to the assembly factory, but they said that they'd have a hard time reusing them since they'd have to have someone make sure they are all aligned the right way and see if they can easily insert the circuit boards in there. These bags originally come as long rolls and a machine inserts the board and then cuts the bag and seals one end. (I suspect that they might just toss them out and that they prefer to use the rolls instead, making the extra effort and fuel spent on sending these back a waste).

We've gone through some efforts to source environmentally sound parts, lead-free soldering, pouches and boxes that customers can toss out or compost since they'll degrade at an accelerated rate, inks that are safe, and then we have these bags. We can't skip this bagging, since that would increase the failure rate, not just from electrostatic discharge, but also from circuit boards rubbing against each other. I am looking to see if there is a paper variant of this for future boards, and I might have a promising solution in coffee pouches.

Coming from a long term relationship of 4yrs. Quite long right? but dumating na kami sa point na kung saan niloko niya ako. He cheated because of ""yun nalang yung reason niya para makawala sa relationship namin"" and other reason is hindi daw ako nagbabago, like pagiging masungit and such. Yan ang mga reasons niya bakit niya ako niloko. 

3rd year namin nag break kami ng 1 week because of micro cheating at pamamahiya niya sakin in public. Bumalik para bawiin lahat, lahat ng pagkukulang at kasalanan but then napansin niya nagbago ako for a week pero bumabalik daw ugali ko na hindi ko maintindihan ano ba talaga dapat baguhin dahil di siya open. He stalked a lot of girls, followed of girls at naging Avon Brochure na yung IG niya. 

Dumating ang ika-apat na taon, dun na siya nag paalam gabi ng magkasama kami not knowing na kinabukasan malalaman ko lahat na may conversation na sila sa ig at i message na hindi alam ng babae na break na talaga kami at nakita ako sa fb posts niya na andun pa rin. The girl confronted me at dun na siya nagsimula na gawin yun ng paulit ulit kahit na inaayos namin yung relasyon hanggat kaya pa. After that, mga nakakasawang away at arguments lang hanggang sa nag isang buwan, naibalita sakin ng mga ka work niya na may kdate na siya na dinala sa workplace niya (coffee shop) which is madalas din naming tambayan. Mind you kakampi ako ng mga ka work niya and not tolerating him kasi super weird na weird sila sa ex ko. 

Ang di ko lang maintindihan, bakit ganun ako kabilis palitan? hindi ba pwedeng paabutin muna niya ng more than 6 mons, ayusin muna ang sarili, trabaho at buhay kesa unahin lumandi? I cant understand. Naaawa ako sa mga bagong mabibiktima niya saying na hindi niya uulitin ang lahat ng abusive (pananakiy ng pisikal) shit sa ibang babae. So ano? sakin niya lang gagawin kasi mas deserve ko maramdaman yung pananakit ng physical, paninigaw at cheating issue niya? I build him for 4 yrs tapos ganun ganun lang? asan ang respect? Sobra ako nasasaktan na meron siyang iba kasi mas naaalala ko kung paano siya magmahal in a good way kesa dun sa mga red flags niya. flex na flex siya ng bago niya ngayon sa soc meds. mind you mas bata sa kanya ng 6-7 years yung babae, ako 25 si ex naman ay 26.yung highlights niya lahat kasama ex ko. di kami makapag cut ng communication since inuunti unti pa bayaran ang utang niya bukod dun super close din ako sa pamilya niya at tinuring akong pamilya. 

Idk, bakit ganun ang mga lalaki? insecure? seeking for other's validation since di ko raw siya vinalidate sa loob ng four years? imposible e. Let me know your tots, sampalin niyo ako ng katotohanan pls. I wanna go move on :( hirap na hirap na ako sa bawat pag gising ko. ",2,1755163817.0,PinoyUnsentLetters,2,1.0,False

I’m a 26-year-old male, and I met this girl (F27) late in my college days, around my third year in Psychology. We’re from the same course and the same university. I never dated her, but somehow she made a profound impact on my life—so much so that I can’t get rid of the thought of her. I’ve been taking steps to move on, but it feels like an uphill battle.

For context:

I met her during the last month of the first semester in my third year. I had just returned from a two-year hiatus due to COVID-19, and I had a hard time adjusting since I was new to my classmates and batch. To make things more difficult, my professor in one of our subjects, Group Dynamics, made me his sort of teaching aide because of my experience in facilitating team buildings outside school. I also joined the same organization that he was part of. This brought unwanted attention to me, with classmates calling me the “teacher’s pet.”

It got worse when my professor asked me to observe and help grade the outputs of another class’s team-building activities, with strict instructions not to reveal I was also a student. I had to introduce myself as a fellow facilitator—unless I was recognized.

That’s how I ran into her. It was her class’s turn to present, and I was there to observe and grade. Everything went smoothly until one of their participants recognized me because we were in the same organization. I was introduced to her, and thanks to her friend, our mutual connection kicked things off.

From there, we became good friends effortlessly. Even though we had known each other for only two days, our conversations felt like we’d been friends long before college. We shared life stories and traumas. I opened up about my insecurities about fitting in, given that I was labeled the “teacher’s pet,” but she didn’t see it that way. She said my experience already put me at a higher level than my classmates, and it was only fair I was treated that way—especially since groupmates paired with me would slack off, knowing I could carry them. That was enough to seal the deal for me, and feelings started to grow.

We got closer each day—daily life updates, late-night calls where we kept each other company while working on projects. She even called me her “accountability buddy.” Then there was that late-night coffee date that started in the late afternoon and lasted until dawn.

This carried over to the second semester. She introduced me to her group of friends, and once again, my facilitator experience was needed to help with their team-building activities. Unfortunately, rumors started that I liked her classmate (which was briefly true—it was just a short-lived infatuation). She believed the rumor, and to silence it, I preemptively confessed my feelings to her. We barely had time to talk about it because of our messy schedules.

When we entered fourth year, things got rough. Internship and thesis work drained our time and energy, and the stress made our friendship feel dull. I started to suspect she didn’t like me the way I liked her, but I was in denial—possibly because of limerence—and I never got a clear answer. The hope kept coming from late-night study sessions at a café with her and her best friend.

During this time, I noticed she was a fan of Love and Deep Space. Seeing her gush over AI characters who worked out hit my male ego hard, so I pushed myself to exercise to the point of exhaustion.

Our friendship remained steady but stale, with shorter interactions. My feelings grew more delusional, but a month before thesis defense and graduation, I began to accept that nothing would happen between us. I focused on journaling, working out, and facilitating team buildings to take my mind off her.

Then, three weeks before graduation, we finally sat down, and she made it clear she wasn’t into me. She said it was partly because I can be careless and upfront, that despite seeming mature to others I often act like a child, and that I can be “cancel-able.” The rejection came late, but at least it was the answer I’d been waiting for.

It’s been two months since graduation, and the distance has grown. Our interactions are scarce—she’s focused on reviewing for board exams, and I’m busy job hunting. I’ve made good progress moving on, especially through journaling, but part of me still wants her. I sometimes think maybe she’ll come around and like me one day. What holds me back is the fear that if I completely move on and she does start liking me, I won’t have the strength to resist, and all my progress will be undone.

1mpvlep,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Due-Direction8268/comments/1mpvlep/8_researchbacked_tactics_you_probably_havent/,8 research-backed tactics you probably haven’t tried yet to help binge eating,"1) Train your brain with Episodic Future Thinking (EFT)

What it is: You vividly pre-experience a meaningful, near-future moment (e.g., “coffee with my sister Saturday morning feeling proud I kept my evenings binge-free this week”).

Why it helps: EFT lowers “now versus later” thinking and can reduce calories and shift choices toward higher-protein foods in real-world settings. Newer work shows broader self-control benefits.

Try it tonight (3 minutes): Write 2–3 specific future scenes you truly want. When an urge hits, read one slowly and picture sights, sounds, and feelings for \~60–90 seconds; then decide your next action.

2) Do food-specific inhibitory control training (ICT)

What it is: Brief “go/no-go” games where you practice not responding to pictures of your personal trigger foods.

Why it helps: Small clinical and community studies suggest ICT can reduce disinhibited eating; research is expanding in BED/BN. [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34728250/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40519-022-01411-9?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[BioMed Central](https://jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40337-025-01358-z?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-12173-w?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

DIY approach (5 minutes, 3–4x/week): Use an app or simple slideshow you create: tap for neutral foods, withhold taps for your binge foods. Keep it short; consistency matters more than duration.

3) Try cue exposure with response prevention (CERP) at home

What it is: You intentionally face binge cues (seeing, smelling, plating trigger foods) while not engaging in the binge ritual, letting the urge rise and fall (habituation).

Why it helps: Reviews conclude CERP can reduce binge frequency, though studies are uneven and usually done with guidance; adolescent protocols are underway. [PubMed+1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33622512/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0005789420300964?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[BMJ Open](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/13/3/e067626?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Safer self-practice (10–15 minutes): Start with milder cues (e.g., opening the package) while breathing slowly and tracking the urge (0–10) until it drops by \~50%. Stop before you’re flooded; build up gradually. Consider doing this with a therapist if binges feel unmanageable.

4) Use heart-rate-variability (HRV) biofeedback for urge regulation

What it is: Slow-paced breathing (about 6 breaths/minute) with real-time feedback to increase HRV.

Why it helps: Early trials link HRV biofeedback to lower food cravings and symptom improvements in eating-disorder samples; note that HRV patterns vary across diagnoses, so treat this as a regulation skill—not a diagnostic tool. [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22688890/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4050420/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/labs/matherlab/files/2021/06/Mather2021inpresscommentaryOptimalHRV.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

How to: Sit upright, inhale \~4–5 s, exhale \~5–6 s for 5 minutes. If you have a device/app that shows HRV or “coherence,” use it; otherwise just keep the rhythm.

5) Write If–Then Plans (Implementation Intentions) for your personal binge cues

What it is: Tiny scripts that link your trigger to a specific action: “If I get home after 8 pm and want to raid the cupboard, then I’ll heat the freezer soup and text J.”

Why it helps: Across diet-change and snacking studies, implementation intentions reduce unhealthy snacking—especially under stress. Adding “mental contrasting” (MCII) strengthens it. [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666310005325?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25504143/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6336265/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00607/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

How to: List your top 3 binge triggers (time, place, emotion). For each, write a plain-language If–Then and tape it where the cue happens (fridge door, sofa table).

6) Use just-in-time (JITAI) supports on your phone

What it is: Lightweight prompts that deliver a coping skill when a risk spike is detected (by time, location, or your self-reported urge).

Why it helps: Early studies and clinician-guided pilots in eating disorders show promise for boosting skill use between sessions; micro-randomized trials are in progress. [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6492029/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Formative](https://formative.jmir.org/2021/5/e18261/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[CenterWatch](https://www.centerwatch.com/clinical-trials/listings/NCT06349460/trial-to-optimize-just-in-time-adaptive-intervention-for-binge-eating-weight-related-behaviors?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/digital-health/articles/10.3389/fdgth.2025.1460167/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

How to: Set calendar or geofenced reminders at your high-risk windows (“9:30 pm urge check → 2-minute EFT + 5 slow breaths”). Track whether it prevented a binge.

7) Experiment with bitter taste pre-loads (sensory “brakes”)

What it is: Small, safe exposure to bitter flavors shortly before high-risk times (e.g., unsweetened strong green/black tea, arugula/rocket, radicchio, hoppy herbal teas).

Why it helps: Bitter receptor (T2R) stimulation in the mouth/gut can influence appetite-related hormones; human data are mixed but include studies where quinine or bitter hop extracts reduced hunger/cravings acutely. Treat as experimental, not a cure. [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4622133/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[ScienceDirect+1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0195666322004275?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

How to: 10–15 minutes before a risky window, sip a naturally bitter beverage with no sugar. If you dislike bitterness or have GI issues, skip this.

8) Practice urge surfing (Acceptance-based skills) for 2 minutes

What it is: Notice the urge like a wave—rising, peaking, and falling—while staying still and curious. Pair it with paced breathing.

Why it helps: Acceptance-based approaches (including ACT) show promise for binge eating; urge surfing is a core micro-skill often built into digital tools. [PMC+1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5987204/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Drexel University](https://drexel.edu/~/media/Files/psychology/labs/innovation/Juarascio%20et%20al%202013%20%282%29.ashx?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

How to (60–120 seconds): Name the sensations (“pressure in chest, saliva pooling”), rate the urge 0–10 every 20 seconds, breathe slowly, and watch it crest and fade. Decide your next step only after the rating drops.

How to combine these in a one-week mini-plan

Daily (5 min): ICT game + one EFT script rehearsal. [PubMed+1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34728250/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Evenings: JITAI reminder → 2 minutes urge surfing + paced breathing. [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6492029/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

3x/week: Brief CERP with a mild trigger (plate it, sit with it, don’t eat) until urge halves. [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33622512/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Optional add-on: Bitter beverage pre-load before your highest-risk time. [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4622133/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Always: If–Then plans posted where triggers happen. [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666310005325?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Track two numbers only: (1) number of binge episodes per week, (2) average peak urge (0–10). Adjust toward the tactics that move those numbers.

What about standard treatments?

Cognitive-behavioral therapy for eating disorders (CBT-ED), guided self-help, and medication can be highly effective; the strategies above are add-ons, not replacements.

I've always tried to help new people get settled - it's just who I am.
When Lisa (mid-20s) started as a junior developer three months ago, I did my usual thing - offered to grab coffee, explained our processes, and stayed late to help her debug code. But something felt off from the start. She'd cut me off in meetings, then act like she hadn't heard me speak at all.
Then I started hearing whispers. Lisa had told coworkers I was ""gatekeeping information"" and wasn't being ""supportive enough."" The thing is, I had been supportive - I'd even included her in client calls she wasn't supposed to be on yet. But somehow, in her version, I was the problem.
It escalated when she started undermining me in front of our manager. She'd volunteer for tasks I was already handling, then act confused when I'd speak up. Once, she presented work we'd done together as entirely hers. When I tried to politely correct it, she made this face like I was being petty.
I felt crazy. Was I being too sensitive? I started second-guessing every interaction.
The breaking point came during a client presentation. I was explaining a feature I'd built, and Lisa interrupted to ""clarify"" something that didn't need clarifying - making it sound like I didn't understand my work. I looked incompetent, and she got to be the hero.
That's when I started documenting everything. Screenshots, emails, meeting notes. I felt ridiculous, but I was genuinely worried about my job.
After two weeks, I went to HR. I was shaking, honestly. What if they thought I was being dramatic?
HR took it seriously. They investigated and found that multiple people had noticed Lisa's behavior. Long story short: she's now on a performance improvement plan.
Here's my dilemma: I used to love mentoring new hires. But now I'm gun-shy. I still do my job well and stay professional, but I've stopped going out of my way to help newcomers.
Was I right to escalate this to HR? And am I being an asshole if I stop offering extra help to new people because of what happened with Lisa?

The first time with 18 mg it worked, but after the first day it didn’t have an effect. Even with the higher dose I felt nothing except some butterflies in my stomach. I drank a bit of coffee / tea and took it with my breakfast. Because of my schedule before work I had to do it this way.

Today I work at home, and because I could sleep a little longer, my morning routine was a bit different. As soon as I woke up, I took the methyl on an empty stomach, and after 45 minutes I clearly felt it worked properly. When I felt it, I had my breakfast (plant based yoghurt with fresh fruits and all kinds of toppings). And no other stimulants like coffee or tea. Just some herbal infusion. To top it off, I also put on my noise cancelling headphones and now I’m way more in the zone.

It seems like taking my meds together with my breakfast and coffee counteracts with the meds. This is something my psychiatrist didn’t inform me about. In fact, he said my regular routine shouldn’t give any issues. Also nicotine seems to counteract, making me more ‘sober’.

I wonder if other people have the same experience?

1mpvez6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialNtelligence/comments/1mpvez6/stop_writing_novellength_prompts_the_6part/,Stop Writing Novel-Length Prompts (the 6-part structure that actually works for veo3),"this is going to be a long post but it will save you so much wasted time..

Everyone’s writing these 200-word essay prompts thinking more words = better AI video results. i tried that approach for months. turns out you can’t really control veo3 output that much anyway - same prompt under slightly different scenarios generates completely different results.

After burning through 1000+ generations on veo3, here’s the baseline structure that consistently works for me:

# The 6-Part Formula

**\[SHOT TYPE\] + \[SUBJECT\] + \[ACTION\] + \[STYLE\] + \[CAMERA MOVEMENT\] + \[AUDIO CUES\]**

That’s it. Don’t overcomplicate it.

**Real working example:**

    Medium shot, woman in red dress, spinning slowly, golden hour backlight, gentle dolly push, Audio: soft wind, distant piano
    

vs my old novel-length approach:

    ""A beautiful cinematic masterpiece in 4K resolution showing an elegant woman wearing a flowing red dress that catches the golden hour sunlight as she gracefully spins in slow motion with professional cinematography and amazing lighting and...""
    

Guess which one actually works better?

# Why this structure works

**Front-load the important stuff** \- Veo 3 weights early words way more heavily. “Beautiful woman” vs “Woman, beautiful” gives you completely different results.

**One action per prompt rule** \- I learned this the expensive way. Multiple actions like “walking while talking while eating” just confuses the hell out of the AI. Stick to one clear action.

**Specific beats creative** \- Instead of “walking sadly” use “shuffling with hunched shoulders, eyes downcast.” The AI needs concrete visual details, not emotions.

**Skip the fluff** \- Terms like “cinematic, high quality, 4K, masterpiece” accomplish literally nothing since veo3 already targets that level.

# Camera movements that actually work:

* Slow push/pull (dolly in/out)
* Orbit around subject
* Handheld follow
* Static with subject movement

**Avoid complex combinations** like “pan while zooming during a dolly” - you’ll just get AI confusion chaos.

# The audio game-changer

Most creators completely ignore audio cues. huge mistake. Adding specific sounds makes everything feel way more realistic:

* “Audio: footsteps on gravel, distant traffic”
* “Audio: wind through leaves, bird calls”
* “Audio: keyboard clicks, coffee shop ambiance”

I’ve been testing all this extensively using [veo3gen.app](http://veo3gen.app) since Google’s direct pricing makes iteration basically impossible ($0.50/second adds up real fast). These guys somehow offer the same veo3 model for way less.

# Style references that deliver:

* “Shot on RED Dragon”
* “Wes Anderson style”
* “Blade Runner 2049 cinematography”
* “Teal and orange grade”

Specific references > vague creative language every single time.

The key insight: **lock down the “what” then iterate on the “how”** \- this approach cut my failed generations by 70%.

After receiving a 5.7 a1c and fasting glucose of 96 in May at age 36, I was shocked. Retrospectively I shouldn’t have been — it kinda made sense… 

PREVIOUSLY
36m. 5’8 170 lbs. Entire dad’s side of the family type 2. Was referred to as “skinny” by everyone around me. 3 mile run, 3 days a week.  Weights at the gym 3 days a week. Mostly active. 7-10k steps a day. But I was skinny fat, doughy. Diet was horrible. Vegetarian/pescatarian which really was mostly carbs. “Healthy” protein shake with banana and strawberries for breakfast. 4 coffees with sugar. Protein bar (14g sugar) for snack at 10am. Usually a bowl of pasta with beans for lunch, or a freezer burrito (50g carbs!). Dinner was pizza, nachos, pasta, or occasionally something healthy like salmon, but always with a heavy side of rice or a potato product. Snacking in between constantly— chips, almonds, walnuts.  Cleaning up my kids meals as well. I basically ate nonstop.

Basically, my activity level compensated somewhat for my terrible diet and kept me “in shape”-ish. But blood work didn’t lie. 

I was high stress from 3-4 income streams, slept like crap, and in general just lost track of what’s important. Headaches 3 times a week at least. 


THE TRANSFORMATION
I lost 25 lbs. 145-ish now. Ripped with a 6pack  that I dreamed of having when I was 18. Fasting glucose 87 on lab (frequently 70s on home finger stick too)

I actually FEEL like I’m 18 again. No neck pain, no headaches, I don’t even get hungover anymore. Full of energy

How?
Bought myself a Stelo CGM, started reading glucose goddess’s book, and my health nut friend helped me change. And I became strictly disciplined  

Diet:
Currently my diet consists of 3 meals a day, 8am, 12pm, 5pm. Nothing more and no excuses here, ever. 

My meals are massive, way more food than I used to eat. The difference is what I eat, and the order of which I eat things has changed. Maybe 30-40g of non-fiber carbs a day. Very little if any processed foods.  
- Breakfast is always a cup of chia pudding followed by a 4 egg mushroom/onion/cheese omelette. (1 full egg, 3 whites only). Some days a handful of fruit after. But no more liquid sugar protein shakes to start the day. 
- Coffee black. 1-2 a day. Lattes only after a high protein/fiber/fat meal. 
- For lunch and dinner— As per glucose goddess, I always prime with veggies in a large portion.  (half a cucumber, a carrot, some broccoli, kale salad, whatever
- Next is some flaxseed crackers (all fiber) and hummus
- Protein and fat next. A variety of fish, salmon, shrimp, tuna, cod, tofu chicken, (no longer pescatarian), avocados, pumpkin seeds, walnuts, almonds, hemp seeds, sunflower seeds. 
- Then, sometimes but not every time I’ll eat complex carbs or fruit. And not the quantity I used to. A handful of blueberries instead of a box. If I rarely had cake, ice cream, rice, or bread—this would be the stage. And very small portions. And I had an apple cider vinegar drink before. 
- Very few exceptions. I would usually pack a lunch box of my meals if I knew we are going to a birthday party with pizza only. And I learned to say no. 
- Cheat meals: yes, I still went out on date nights land had chips and guac, a marg, fries, etc. Still had sushi once every two weeks. If I was a guest and was offered something not in my plan, I would eat it. The key here was always priming with veggies, vinegar if possible, and walking after the meal. 

Exercise:
Timing changed here too. If I went for a run, it was AFTER a meal, not before when starving. I amped up my weight training routine at the gym here and got substantially stronger despite losing weight.

MOST IMPORTANTLY- walk after every meal if not going on a run or gym already. My average for this last 2.5 months is a daily 14,000 steps a day. My daughters learned to ride 2 wheelers so I just run beside them after dinner— the after dinner bike ride is ritual now. Feels great!

Stress:
Not sure how I managed this part honestly. But I winded down some of my work and business obligations. Just prioritized health and family over them. Took multivitamins and probiotics. And somehow my stress lowered and sleep improved. I don’t have tips here, I’m lucky I was able to reframe my mindset because I think this part was super important. 

Other notes and a question:
- CGM- the Stelo helped me immensely to see what spikes me and what is ok. Over the weeks, my curve flattened substantially. Very rarely above 115 now even after my one time eating ice cream AND being sedentary after. 
- With my 5.1 a1c labs, my total insulin level was VERY low at 1.9. This scared me so I got LADA 1.5 antibody testing— all negative. My guess is that my strictly low or no carb diet lowered this to this number. Is anyone else’s insulin really low after such a drastic shift of their diet? Is it possible I am just this sensitive at a lower weight?

Next steps:
I took a week off from Stelo to give my brain a rest from data overload. But now I’m going to get one again to slowly start reintroducing a bit more complex carbs and experimenting with a more “normal” diet for this next 3 months.

It was the most calming one, it gave me focus without initially causing much anxiety. I suspect it's because Vyvanse is releasing Dopamine, and not only inhibiting its reuptake like some of the other drugs listed above.

I took Vyvanse for a few months, daily, and my quality of life drastically improved. It felt like my brain was properly working again. However, as I said, it was not completely anxiety-free and eventually the anxiety became a large problem. I suspect the anxiety came from the noadrenaline impact Vyvanse has on the brain in terms of releasing it and blocking its reuptake.

The logical conclusion is: Vyvanse is great because it releases dopamine, raises tonic dopamine. It is not great because it affects noadrenaline, too. And that makes Vyvanse a no go or any kind of stimulant. There also isn't a pure dopamine reuptake inhibitor, I don't even need to try bupropion to know what will happen: Anxiety.

Now here is where it gets interesting: I noticed that food with slight MAO B inhibition (coffee, dark chocolate, green tea) gives me Vyvanse-like effects. I am aware of PEA in chocolate, but it's not found in the other foods. I am also aware of caffeine and theobromine found in those foods. However, when I try caffeine supplements alone, I *don't* get the same effects as from eating those foods. So there has to be something else at play.

My theory is the following: MAO B inhibitors could be the solution, especially those who don't metabolize to amphetamine-like products (that excludes Selegiline). It makes sense, doesn't it? By inhibiting the ""destruction"" of dopamine, in essence, the tonic dopamine level is raised. And this mimics partly the (relevant) effects of Vyvanse, just in a different way.

Does anyone have experience with MAO B inhibitors, could they be an alternative to Vyvanse?",1,1755162213.0,VyvanseADHD,0,1.0,False

To truly get anywhere close to what I wanted, first I 3D Printed a tamper that fits the AeroPress ID and the back of the original AeroPress scoop/spoon. 

In food-safe PETG filament with 100% infill for maximum strength during tamping. It never comes in contact with heat. 

I now have a copper base, so no plastic in contact with the coffee at all. 

I also use a Timemore water dripper, as it slowly, evenly and uniformly wets the tamped puck with minimum turbulence. 

This works with an original AP cap, in this video Ive used the Fellow Prismo, which is similar to the AP Flow Control Cap. 

I use a powered drill to grind using the Timemore C2S, which i found better than the C3, which I used before this.

It reminds me how far I’ve come and how good my life actually is. 

I finished my first year and have basically doubled my efficiency which makes time for having a more than decent life. 

I don’t watch lectures. I use Anki, AMBOSS questions, and a weekly group study session. I have at least two hours of free time every night (more on weekends) and workout 4-8 times per week. 

I meal prep decently, have a walking pad setup in my office that I use with an Anki remote to stay active and can get in some decent zone 2-3 heart rate every day. I just bought one of the Daylight Computer tablets and it’s my new favorite thing to wake up and do my flashcards as the sun comes up (which has had huge benefits on my sleep cycle). I also use it to watch any shows in the evening before bed which cut back on my blue light exposure before bed. I drink coffee before exams and thats it. 

I’m married. I have a dedicated date night every week and we schedule a joint study session most Saturdays and Sundays at a cafe. 

During my first year I passed all my classes but was somewhere in the bottom 1/3 of my class (based on stats from exam results). Now I’m scoring right at my class average and making small gains. If you told me that I would be able to do all that and study for boards 1.5 hours every day I would have frothed jealously at the mouth that anyone could conceive of such a thing. 

My first year felt like alot of the posts I read here: discouraged, anxious, terrified, defensive. This year, thats all gone, I just mostly have anger towards my school for doing silly scheduling things that interrupt my daily programming. 

All that to say, if you’re struggling, stay off of Reddit and places like SDN. Medstudents in general are highly neurotic and going through a very difficult time in their careers. If they could help themselves they would stay off the message boards. There are literally people here that screen for those vulnerable posts just to say “it gets worse” , “this is what you signed up for” etc. 

You don’t hear as much from people who are thriving because those posts aren’t being engaged with - if they get made at all there is no blood in the water and they aren’t asking for help. 

Drop some hate if you’re a little bish and feel micro-aggressed after reading this.

But honestly? The small words are the ones that trip people up and make your Chinese sound more natural.

Here are 7 “little” HSK1 words worth mastering:

很 (hěn) – Not just “very.” In most cases, it’s just a link between subject + adjective. 她很漂亮（tā hěn piào liang） isn’t necessarily “very” pretty — it’s just “She’s pretty.”

的 (de) – 
1)Possession (sb的n)
-我的书 (wǒ de shū)– my book
-他的妈妈 (tā de māma) – his mom 

2)Descriptions (Adj.+ 的 N)
-漂亮的花 (piàoliang de huā) – beautiful flower


不 (bù) – Sounds easy, right? But watch out for tone changes: bù → bú before 4th tone.

吗 (ma) – The magic question particle. Just drop it at the end and voilà, instant yes/no question.

在 (zài) – Can mean “at,” “in,” or “currently doing” something. 我在喝咖啡 = I’m drinking coffee right now.

和 (hé) – Usually “and,” but don’t use it to connect sentences, only nouns.

了 (le) – The tiny word that keeps beginners up at night. Change of state, completed action…

💡 HSK Tip: If you master these 7, your Chinese will sound smoother and your HSK1 listening score will jump.

Gym? I pay for it but I’m lucky if I go twice a month.

Evenings? Phone scrolling until I crash.

So I’m curious – for those of you who actually pulled it off, what worked? Did you start super small? Did you have some “aha” moment that changed your mindset? Or is it just pure discipline over time?

1mpv0y9,https://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/1mpv0y9/strange_encounter_with_darpa_man/,Strange encounter with DARPA man,"I am going to be specific about the location as I have always wanted to find someone - anyone - who met this person. This happened about 7 years ago.

At the time there was a 24-hour cafe in the southeast Portland, Oregon and I would go there to pull all-nighters before my exams. A quaint place, with bagels and coffee, frequented at night by college students, paramedics, and other night dwellers. I went to the register and ordered a pot of green tea. 

A man in his maybe 50s is sitting at the booth connected to the register area. He strikes up conversation with me. I do not recall what he said to me but it caused me to sit next to him. I remember his eyes conveyed something indescribable and I couldn’t break eye contact with him. I would be staring at his eyes for the next FIVE hours. 

I think he mentioned his wife - something to make me feel safe interacting with him. He starts building rapport with me. I learn he is doing this because a few hours in to him talking at me he explains his method of profiling and building rapport - like he engineered the discussion for a woman in her 20s going into a STEM field. 

He explains that he works for DARPA. He begins to speak about this research. He begins with the innocuous - a presentation he gave to policy makers about the economic benefit of guaranteeing housing for single mothers. He talked about menopause - he offered me with his surprise when I knew whales were the only other animals that are known to experience menopause. He chuckles and says essentially that DARPA is the true science sector and his agency gives out tidbits of knowledge for the non-government affiliated scientists. I feel a kind of despair. His eyes never expressed excitement. He told me has grown so used to lecturing that he cannot properly emulate the reciprocity of discussion, and I was under the impression I should just hear him out and not try to give input from here on out. 

He was looking up things on his computer as he talked to ensure they’ve been publically released before he mentions them to me. He begins talking about experiments in villages in Africa. He speaks about a genocide he caused by building wells for certain villages and not others. He spoke of the camouflage technology they use to bend light waves around the surveillance tech they used for their projects - to make them invisible. He mentions he has 18 wives around the world and talks about them lovingly. He talks about giant sloths causing the selection pressures on humans to create the genotypes of humans we see today. He mentions that I am unusual for being attentive this long, and that most people do not maintain eye contact for hours as I had. It occurred to me that he has these discussions with others, this was routine for him. With every anecdote I felt he was communicating either something that I needed to remember every detail of for the rest of my life or something that I needed to erase from my mind entirely - lest I be silenced by the government on my walk home. Between DARPA man’s harrowing tales, staring into his eyes for many hours straight, and the fact I had been up all night, I was feeling pretty paranoid. When the sun rose I said I needed to go to school. He got up to leave before I did, and I realized he was only there that long to carry out this conversation with me. He told me I can go to [nearby food co-operative] and ask for his wife who runs a local farm-to-table program for schools, and she would have something for me. (I never followed up on this; In that moment I thought I must meet with his wife, but when the aura of the experience wore off and I realized I most definitely would Not.)

The guy making coffee drinks on the other side of the booth where we were sitting - who made no indication that he was listening this whole time - made a point to reach over the bar and shake DARPA man’s hand before he left. He even thanked him. This guy also heard and believed everything DARPA man said. That is the only affirmation I have that this happened as I experienced it, and that DARPA man was real to someone else. I wish I talked to that barista. Even now I feel I cannot say everything DARPA man told me. Some of the projects he spoke about just seemed deranged. I wish I could find someone else who met him who can tell me what this whole thing was about.",0,1755160991.0,RBI,5,0.3,False

## Key features Analysis

the quality of a sunflower candle goes beyond just the scent. Several technical specifications contribute to the overall experience, including the wax type, fragrance oil concentration, wick composition, burn time, container material, and scent throw.

**Wax Type:**
The type of wax used considerably impacts the candleS performance. Soy wax, known for its clean burn and eco-friendliness, is a popular choice.It releases fragrance evenly and doesn't produce as much soot as paraffin wax. Beeswax, a natural option, offers a subtle honey scent that complements floral notes. Coconut wax, another premium option, boasts excellent scent throw and a slow, even burn. Paraffin wax, while more affordable, can release possibly harmful chemicals when burned, making it a less desirable choice for those concerned about air quality.

**Fragrance Oil Concentration:**
The amount of fragrance oil used in the candle directly determines the intensity of the scent. A higher concentration, typically between 8-12%, results in a stronger, more noticeable fragrance. However, too much fragrance oil can lead to a waxy or overpowering scent. The quality of the fragrance oil itself also matters; natural essential oils or high-quality synthetic fragrance oils will create a more pleasant and authentic sunflower scent. Be sure to select a candle with quality oils for maximum enjoyment and the safest experience.

**wick composition:**
The wick plays a crucial role in the candle's burn performance. Cotton wicks are a common choice, providing a steady flame and good scent throw. Wood wicks, with their crackling sound, add a cozy ambiance to the burning experience. Though, wood wicks can require more maintenance, such as trimming before each use, to prevent smoking. Lead-core wicks shoudl be avoided due to potential health hazards.

**Burn Time:**
Burn time indicates how long the candle will last. It depends on the size of the candle, the wax type, and the fragrance oil concentration. A larger candle with a lower fragrance oil concentration will typically burn longer. Reputable brands usually provide accurate burn time estimates on their packaging. It's important to note that burning a candle for excessive periods (more than 4 hours at a time) can lead to overheating and a diminished scent throw.

**Container Material:**
The container material affects the candle's safety and aesthetics. Glass jars are a common choice,offering a classic look and allowing you to see the candle burning. Metal containers can also be used, but they can get hot to the touch. Ceramic containers offer a more decorative option. it's crucial to choose a container that is heat-resistant and designed specifically for candle use to prevent breakage or other hazards.

## Core Benefits

A well-crafted sunflower candle offers a multitude of benefits beyond its pleasant aroma. It can enhance your mood, create a relaxing atmosphere, improve focus, and even serve as a decorative element.

**Mood Enhancement:** The bright, cheerful scent of sunflower can uplift your mood and create a sense of optimism. The fragrance can trigger positive memories of sunny days and beautiful landscapes, helping to alleviate stress and promote relaxation. Sunflower scents have been shown, in some cases, to enhance personal motivation.

**Atmosphere Creation:** Sunflower candles can transform any space into a cozy and inviting haven.

The flickering candlelight adds a touch of elegance and tranquility, making it perfect for meditation, yoga, or simply unwinding after a long day.

**Focus and Concentration:** Surprisingly, certain subtle floral scents like those found in sunflower candles can improve focus and concentration.

This can be particularly useful for studying, working from home, or engaging in creative activities.**Decorative Appeal:** Sunflower candles are not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing. The vibrant yellow color and the sunflower motif add a touch of nature and warmth to any home décor.

## FAQs Section

Considering purchasing a sunflower candle? Here are answers to some common questions consumers have:

**What does a sunflower candle typically smell like?**
A sunflower candle ideally captures the essence of the sunflower flower, which is challenging to extract into an essential oil. This often means that the scents are often a carefully crafted blend. Sunflower candles typically offer a blend of floral, sweet, and slightly earthy notes.Some may include hints of honey or citrus to enhance the sweetness and add a touch of freshness, or even elements of fresh greens. The best candles capture the full range of the sunflower flower's complexity.

**How long should I burn my sunflower candle?**
It's generally recommended to burn a sunflower candle for no more than 3-4 hours at a time. Burning the candle for longer periods can cause the wax to overheat and the fragrance to diminish. It can also increase the risk of smoking or tunneling, where the wax only melts in the center of the candle. After burning, allow the wax to cool and solidify before relighting to ensure optimal performance.

**Are sunflower candles safe for peopel with allergies?**
While sunflower candles are generally safe, individuals with allergies to fragrances or specific ingredients should exercise caution.Check the ingredient list carefully for any known allergens. If you have sensitive skin or respiratory issues,it's best to test the candle in a well-ventilated area before burning it for an extended period. If you experience any adverse reactions, discontinue use immediately.

I’ve had a new coffee setup for two weeks now, consisting of a Profitec Move and a Eureka Single Dose Pro.

When I used the grinder for the first time, I immediately noticed fairly strong vibrations. It’s so pronounced that the cup included with the grinder spins merrily in circles when placed on the small wooden platform where the coffee exits. In addition, when switching the grinder off, it makes a metallic noise as it winds down. It’s not loud, but it doesn’t give a great first impression. My dealer says this is normal, but Eureka hasn’t responded to my support form for days.

What makes me unsure is that the shots, despite identical parameters, always produce different times or flow rates.

With exactly 17 g of fresh coffee from my roaster, the same settings, and a 30 s extraction time, I’m getting anywhere between 32 g and 40 g in the cup.

Could this be a normal variation that happens with every brew, or did I perhaps get a bad grinder? Has anyone had similar experiences with this grinder regarding vibration and the metallic noise?

## FAQs Section

**How do I choose the right perfume for my skin type?**

Perfume interacts differently with various skin types. Oily skin tends to amplify fragrances, so lighter scents like ""Coastal Breeze"" may be ideal.

**How should I properly apply perfume?**

1mputuu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1mputuu/how_to_regain_husbands_trust_after_platonic/,How to regain husband's trust after platonic friendship with ex sparks tension?,"

My husband (31M) and I (30F) have been married for a year, and we've had our ups and downs. Recently, a friendship with an ex has caused some tension. We've been exchanging reels and having intellectual discussions on IG, and I thought nothing of it since we're both married and it's purely platonic. There were instances when we talked about catching up for coffee and we’ve had phone conversations and I thought I kept it respectful. 

However, my husband has expressed concerns and feels it's odd that our friendship is so ""special"" that we only exchange reels. I've tried to show him our interactions, but he's still uneasy about it. To resolve the issue, I've agreed to cut ties with my ex and any other previous romantic interests.

The thing is, there have been instances where I vented to this ex about issues in my relationship, which was before we got married. My husband pointed out that he's never shared our issues with any female friends, and it made him feel like I wasn't prioritizing our relationship. I understand why he's hurt.

Edit
Now, I'm wondering:

1. How can I regain my husband's trust?* We've had open conversations, but I want to make sure I'm doing everything to reassure him of my commitment to our marriage.
2. EDIT: I’m absolutely cutting connections. The question is Should I tell my ex that we're ending the friendship or just MIA?
3. Should I show him more conversations? I'm worried it might make things worse since he's already aggravated. Should I just focus on moving forward and rebuilding trust?

Has anyone else dealt with similar situations? Any advice on how to navigate this and strengthen my marriage would be appreciated!",3,1755160240.0,Marriage,8,0.67,False

No this is serious. Aaj me apne guy frnds ke saath canteen mein thi. Hum teen log the mujhe mila kar. Ekdost uthke chala gaya uski gaadi nikalne bulaya tha usko toh woh gaya. Ab me aur mera dost hum baithe hai aamne samne and we were having coffee and maggie. Me baato mein lagi hu uske saath and hum milke kisika mazak uda rahe the (hamare Mutual enemy ka) toh me bht jaahilo jaise hass rahi thi. Mujhe aas pass ke logo ka dhyaan nahi tha. 

Khaate khaate thodi maggie mere kapde pe gir gayi toh mera dost ek acche insaan ki tarah usse saaf kar raha tha mere liye 😭 uska position samjhati hu, me baithi hui hu chair oe aur woh mere samne kneel down hai aur mere kurte ke bottom pe jo khaana gira hai usko saaf kar raha tha. Ab utne mein sanme se mera crush agaya, mene notice nahi kiya kyuki me mere dost ki video bana rahi thi aur backchodi kar rahi thi aur ye sab mere crush ne dekh liya aur uske dost bhi the saath mein and now he thinks i am with my friend 😭😭😭 bhai jo look tha uske face pe betrayal ka LOL mujhe hasna toh nahi chahiye par ab soch soch ke hassi aarahi hai what to do 😭😭

Bhai yaar usko galat fehmi hogayi aur banda chala gaya canteen se aur uske dost log mujhe side eye deke gaye 🥲


Translation (warna mods tadapne lagege)

So, a little plot twist happened today 🥲

I was chilling in the canteen with my guy friends — three of us in total. One dude had to leave ‘cause his car was being summoned (don’t ask), so it’s just me and my other friend now. We’re sitting face-to-face, sipping coffee, eating Maggi, and roasting our mutual enemy like true professionals. I’m laughing like a complete menace to society, zero awareness of my surroundings.

Then… tragedy. A bit of Maggi decides to bungee jump onto my kurta. My friend, being the decent human he is, kneels down to clean it. Like — I’m sitting, he’s on one knee, wiping the bottom of my kurta.

Cue entrance music: my CRUSH walks in with his gang. I’m still busy recording a dumb video of my friend and giggling, completely oblivious. Crush sees the whole thing. His face? Pure “she betrayed me” energy.

He immediately walks out. His friends give me the side-eye. And now I’m sitting here replaying the scene, trying not to laugh… but failing miserably 😭

* **Placement Support:** Networking, resume building, and direct recruiter connections.  
* **Mentorship:** Guidance from professionals who have worked in top tech companies.  

# Criteria for Choosing the Right Institute

Before we dive into the list, let’s set the benchmarks. A good training and placement institute should offer:

While Bangalore has dozens of reputed institutes, here are a few that stand out — including our featured pick, Kodestree Technologies.

# 1. Kodestree Technologies – More Than Just a Training Center

When you walk into Kodestree Technologies, you’ll notice something different right away — it doesn’t feel like a “coaching center.” The atmosphere is vibrant, collaborative, and driven by the belief that learning should feel like building something meaningful, not just memorizing notes.

1mpur20,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1mpur20/how_does_caffeine_affect_you/,How does caffeine affect you?,"Hi all! I'm not officially diagnosed, but the people I've talked to strongly suspect I have ADHD, and that includes people in our student healthcare. As you've probably heard too many times, I ""hope"" I got it because otherwise I guess I'm just weird and stupid for other reasons haha.

I've heard caffeine often makes ADHD people sleepy, but for me, that's not the case. I wonder if this is common. I do think it gives me energy, but more like mental energy. Not kind of energy that I would use for running on the walls. I'm usually slightly hyperactive, like standing, tapping my feet or going circles on my chair rather than staying still, but caffeine doesn't seem to make my hyperactivity worse, at least not clearly.

I like to drink caffeine before band trainings, exams, or doing exercise, because it helps me to focus and stay motivated and stay in the moment. If I'm stressed it calms me down a little. When life gets rough, I get kinda addicted, but it's not that I would fall asleep without coffee. It's more like it makes me happy and relaxed in situations where I wouldn't be that otherwise. I also love morning coffee because I like the taste and the relaxed moment in the beginning of the day. After that, I'm ready to go, but idk if it's because of caffeine, plasebo, or a slow start (I'm not a morning person, so I hate just running to work/studies/gym straight from the bed).

I did have side effects after my shot - headache + super sleepy! But those only lasted the first day. Still a little tired but I’m able to drink caffeine like monster or coffee with no problem. 

Also, I usually drink on the weekends and have had 0 desire to drink at all since I started even on .25. I am hoping that when I want to drink I won’t have any bad reactions because I do love to go out to the bar every once in a while. 

Other than that - SW 185 CW 173! 
I used to weigh 150 two years ago before I got into some bad habits so I’m excited to see what happens in the next few months. But mostly it has been so nice to not have my life revolving around food! Forget the weight loss goals, just being able to do anything without worry about food has been incredible!

With GPUs getting ridiculously expensive (thanks AI boom… and yes, Jensen’s leather jacket is still shinier than ever), I built a project to make high-end rendering actually affordable for Blender users.

It’s a **free and open source software** with a 1-click deploy setup that runs your .blend files on GPU cloud providers like Runpod, Vast, Quickpod, etc. You’re not paying for the software — you only pay for the GPU time.

You can grab insanely powerful cards like the RTX 4090, RTX 5090, and more for under **$1/hour**. That means you can render 500–1000 frames for the price of a coffee, and with a nice GUI so it still feels like you’re working inside Blender — just faster. You can also do multi GPU rendering with **2 RTX 5090** to **8 RTX 5090** for just under $1.3 to $6 which in reality would cost you $24,000.

If you’ve been priced out of NVIDIA’s latest cards but still want top-tier rendering performance, this might save you a ton of time and money.

Gus stood up from the leather stool, welcoming the couple through the door to the bar. He smiled nodding his head politely as the couple held their tickets out to him. “Thank you, enjoy.” He said. Gus’s smile fell away as they walked inside, his gaze drawn to the hooded figure across the street.

The same one that had been standing there since he arrived hours earlier. Facing him, ominous and shadowed. Long beach was a colorful city, its homeless population just as daring and vibrant as the more financially stable residents.

Gus had his fair share of run-ins with the homeless already. Lingering, searching for scraps, a cigarette here, some change there. An ear to deposit their tales. 

This was different, it felt different. Dangerous, in a way which chilled him. Primal, malevolent, a cold breeze drifting from a place not intended for us.

A new couple made their way towards the door, both well dressed. Crisp suit, flowing dress, leather shoes, delicate heels. The night's events proved to bring in a crowd with a prepared elegance Gus hadn’t seen until tonight. The Hawk attracted a wide range. Hipster’s, dapper with freshly waxed mustaches, metal heads proudly wearing a battle vest festooned with patches like a war veteran. Hip hop heads with hats and sneakers so clean you would think they had an invisible force field.

Magic spells of protection cast in the name of freshness. Tonight was a different kind of crowd, a different atmosphere. Heavy with ozone, lightning ready to strike.  Gus watched, Gus saw them all, he was the first face they saw, and the last one they saw. Sometimes the one ushering them out with a bit more, let’s say guided intensity.

It had taken a few months for him to get a feel for the crowds. The usual’s, the types to watch out for. The staff, who worked in what way, who had that special golden ticket to stay after hours. Who was eighty sixed, the special cases. The drinkers who turned into their worst selves. Like some terrible obnoxious lycanthropy stored in a bottle. 

Gus squinted as the head lights of a gray Honda pulled into the driveway of the parking lot. Where he stood the lights of incoming cars would splash into him. He would squint, or turn, giving him a reason to peek his head into the bar. If you walked through the door to the hawk, you would have a photo booth to your right. It was an L shaped space. 

To your left is the bar, stretching out like a centipede. Leather topped bar stools for feet. Straight ahead are two pool tables, coin operated with a smattering of dark spots across the green felt. Stained glass light fixtures hanging above them. Gus would have to warn people not to touch them. One guy in particular seemed to have a penchant for tapping it. A ritual of luck before trying to make an impossible shot. Gus would see the light wobbling from the door. A spotlight swinging like a flopping corpse at the end of a noose. 

Gus nodded at the well dressed couple as they walked past holding up their tickets for him to see. Their shadows cast like giants upon the wall next to him by the lights of the Honda backing out. Gus followed them inside. An opportunity to check on things. The suited man glanced back nervously at him. Gus smiled at him in an attempt to ease his reaction. Gus was a big guy, the kinda big that tended to startle people if they didn’t know he was standing behind them. They would turn, their eyes widening in shock and then quickly adjust to embarrassment.

He was a wall of a guy, a wall that would smile back and not make a big deal out of it. One of the reasons he fell into security, tall, wide shoulders. A lifetime of the question, “You played football?”, No, no I didn’t. It was funny, his response was always a disappointment to them. Like their assumption was a bright red balloon, and Gus was the one to stab it with a pin. Fuck football. 

Gus glanced around the bar. Well dressed patrons milled about. Suits and dresses, pressed and colorful. Sprinkled all along the stools. Like birds, resting along a branch between courtship displays. A few clustered together in the booths along the wall across from the bar. A short dark olive skinned man was smiling and leaning in to take drink orders from the new couple.

 A shorter woman with rich brown hair and blood red lips was stirring a glass with ice and pink liquid. She smiled at the people sitting in front. Her dress was a brighter pink. The color standing out against the tan tattooed skin of her arms. A silver tongued mixologist. They all were. A hybrid of pharmacists, salesmen, and therapists. Gus could not hear their exchange over the music. It howled across the murmurs and clinks of glass. The Misfits, She, was blasting.

Danzig  bellowed,  declaring how he loves evil sex, she has lost control, and that they were growing old. A bar back navigated the crowd, skillfully dodging elbows and backs as he unfolded the chairs. Setting them in a spacing wide enough for people to walk around freely but still sit theatre style once the show started. A pair of older men fussed with cables near a makeshift stage.

They wore silky black suits, polished shoes which shined against the soft amber light of the bar lamps. A small faded oriental carpet lay atop the stage. Standing on that was a table with unplugged cables laying limp, like dead vipers across it. The table was hefty, thick wood on thick legs. More of a butcher block then a table. The table had a sort of bald spot, an open space between the cables as if someone had stolen what was plugged in, and walked out. An artifact whisked away by Doctor Jones. 

Gus watched as a man appeared from the corner of the bar. He was tall, lean, red haired and buzzed down. Kyle, the owner of The Hawk. He walked over to the men, leaning in to speak with the one closest to him. The two nodded at one another, the man leaned towards him, speaking into Kyle’s ear.

Kyle nodded, saying something back which was inaudible from where Gus watched. The secret closeness when attempting to speak to someone in a room full of sound. He turned and walked towards Gus. Kyle made his way out the front door patting Gus on the shoulder as he passed. Gus followed him out into the cooling night air.

“I will be right back, these guys need another cable for their rig. I’m gonna go snag one from Darlings and come back.” Kyle said, he was looking at Gus but his eye was snatched by something. Gus knew he saw the figure across the street, watched his eyes glimmer with uncertainty. The reflection of moonlight across agitated blue waters while someone drowned.

“What’s with that Guy?” Kyle asked, his eyes turning back to Gus. Gus shrugged “Not sure, been out here since I got on shift. I’ve been keeping an eye out though.” Gus said. Kyle patted Gus on the shoulder, “Yeah, once this thing ends make sure he doesn’t bug everyone when they get out.” Gus nodded at this. “I will be back in a sec, I don’t know what this guy looks like. Some European cat, should have some bodyguards with him. Call me if something goes hinky.” Kyle said as he walked away, “You got it.” Gus said back. He watched Kyle wave and hop in to his truck. The figure across the street still hadn’t moved. It was standing in the door way of the church. Shadowed by the overhang of the steps, a small splash of light from the street lamps above revealing just enough to know it was there.

 

The figure was wearing a hoodie, far to large for whoever had it on. It draped down in a way that obscured its form. “My dude!” Gino stepped forward with his long legs, hand outstretched to Gus.

 

“Whats up Gino.” Gus said, clasping his hand, they met in the middle hugging. Gus was indeed a big guy, but Gino was as tall as they came. If Gus was tired of the football question. Gino was just as nauseated by the basketball one.

 

   “You working tonight?” Gus asked, he turned his head to glance around the parking lot behind him. 

 

   “Nah man I came to check this out. I’m telling you this is once in a lifetime kinda shit.” Gino said.

   “Well, shit man you dressed the part. Your dapper as fuck.” Gus held out his hands as he said this, his palms facing out towards Gino. Gino pinched the collar of his suit, kicking his feet out in a strutting dance. 

 

“Once in a lifetime, calls for the proper attire!” Gino said. Gus laughed and Gino rubbed his hands down the front of his suit jacket, smoothing out the collar. Gino was friends with just about everyone at The Hawk, and if he wasn’t, he would be shortly. His personality was infectious, ingratiating and humble. Gus had liked him immediately, as most people did.

 

“Who is this guy anyway? Some big wig European DJ guy?” Gus asked. “Terrell and Kyle just said it would be more of a private event tonight.” Gus added. Gino leaned back, his height and slim build lending the movement to a spring. He put his hands together in a praying position. 

 

“Mannn, this guy is a legend. I’ve been following him for years. Gus, man, the guy, shit it’s like royalty gracing our little bar, you feel me?” Gus nodded and smiled, he crossed his arms. A gesture, like a kid leaning in for story time.

“Every record head out here knows about him.” Gino was animated, his motions dramatic. Gus nodded, trying his best to give Gino the sense that he understood the

importance of this Guy playing here.

 

This was something he had grown accustomed to. Working in a focal point of Long Beaches social scene. He was privy to a reeducation nightly. Learning of a new topic he knew next to nothing about. A topic which was common knowledge amongst the natives. Local bar’s , recording artists, which pizza shop was the best. You know, The one just off of fourth and pine?

 

Gus would shrug and smile politely as he did now, allowing them show him what was what. It was as if he was a pilgrim from a far away planet. A fresh face, just off the dock stepping into a land where craft beer micro brews paired with Nashville hot “chick - un” vegan sandwiches and pizza had curry on it.

 

Everyone lived right around the corner, up the block, or just five minutes down the way on such and such street. Gus had a quality of newness in this way. In all honesty it made him a better doorman, that and he was pretty good at letting drunk people talk.

 

“He has this method of mixing and spinning records, it’s, man,” Gino paused tilting his head up to the sky, as if the black space between the stars had the proper description written out.

 

“He mixes with these rare tracks. Songs only a few people know of. Dude finds them and brings them back to life.”

“Like what oldies and shit?” Gus asked. Gino smiled,”It’s everything man, oldies, hip hop, rock ,classical. Songs gobbled up by time. Shit they played on flutes made from bone back in the day,” 

Gino moved his hand in gesture swiping in the air, “Lost songs rediscovered , he mixes them, blends them together.”

 

“So like the ultimate B- side collection?” Gus asked. Gino clapped his hands and started laughing, “Exactly. He even presses the records himself, all analog. I heard the guy uses unconventional materials. Ceramic, bone, even the needles are custom. Hair thin shards of obsidian. I’m telling you we’re in for a treat. He has only played live a few times over the years. Shit, no one even knows what he looks like!”

 

“Gino!” A woman says behind Gus. Her voice was loud, amplified by the freshly introduced alcohol into her bloodstream. She walked along side a man, both coming from the door to the bar. The woman wore a dark blue dress and the man a gray suit. Gus could see a tattoo creeping up from his collar. A purple and green tentacle reaching for the fat disk of Lacquered wood dangling in his ear lobe.

 

“What’s up guys!” Gino said, he leaned in to hug the girl followed by the tattooed man. The three began chatting, talking about things which severed the connection from Gus. He stood their for a few awkward moments. Feeling like a painting on a wall, before understanding fully the circuit was a triangle not a square. Gus stepped away silently heading back towards the door of the bar. It was now a half hour before the show began, though these things never really held any punctuality. By this point everyone on the list had arrived, that is besides the guest of honor.

 

Another couple stepped outside, cigarettes in hand. He stepped pass them, through the door. The metal clank and scratch of a zippo sparking alight, it was immediately swallowed by the sound of the bar as he crossed the thresh hold. The sound was like a curtain.

 

Conversations, glasses clinking, the drone of The Psychedelic Fur’s Love my way whirling together into a blanket of sound. Some of the patrons were already sitting in the rows of chairs. 

Small splashes of them in groups. Others sitting at the bar or milling around between. Sitting near the center of the bar  sat a large glass drink dispenser. It had to be a few gallons, highly polished glass which looked more like crystal with a bronze faucet near the bottom.

 

Gus watched as the red lipped woman turned it allowing the dark green liquid within to pour across ice into a stout frosted whiskey tumbler. It was like the color of mountain dew but a little bit darker. Less alien blood, and more radioactive forest.

 

The container sat in an ornate brass base. It was a piece of art, it seemed hand shaped. Its feet delicate, curved metal spiraling in patterns.

 

 

Its shape held the glass as if it were the abdomen of some metallic spider ready to scuttle off at any second. The green liquid within was a special cocktail, brewed, mixed and served only at the DJ’s shows. Supposedly a recipe from the region he hailed from, which when asked no one really knew. Just that he was European. DJ what’s his name from Europe. Gus laughed at this, it was all so silly.

 

Something settled in Gus’s gut as he stared at the green liquid in the dispensers glass. Like a lead weight on a fishing line hitting the seabed. What was his name? Gus couldn’t remember ever hearing it. He couldn’t remember seeing it on a poster. The more he thought, the heavier that lead weight became, sinking deeper into the black muck. His mind struggled to recall any mention of it, conversations, texts from his boss. Nothing, just a fog, a blankness, a hole, deeper then it should have been. As he thought it occurred to him he couldn’t recall getting to work that night either.

 

Gus’s mind was doing tricks on a trampoline, inching closer to the edge, in danger of bouncing up and dropping off the side. He was still staring at the liquid. The green shimmering liquor, it was gently twirling inside. His hair was prickling on the back of his neck. The pores on his arm dilating, unable to look away. The bar and its blanket of sound faded. Replaced by a darkening silence. Gus watched as something stirred inside. A darkened silhouette of something swimming. A sense of vertigo pulled at Gus. Pulling him up into space creating a nauseating birds eye view.

 

He was not looking at a container of liquor, but at an Ocean. An emerald torrent, roiling, white capped and angry. A primordial sea, wherein a behemoth slithered below its surface. The black shadow of a behemoth, preparing to breech. To swallow him, Gus, a speck of meat shredded in its forested maw of ivory needles. 

 

Kyle patted  Gus on the shoulder as he passed, holding up the retrieved electrical cord and flashing a thumbs up as he walked towards the stage. The room had blinked back into existence, the sound and atmosphere pulled back like a blanket in a cold night. Gus watched Kyle hand the cable to one of the suited men by the stage.

 

The man nodded and grinned, quickly taking it and weaving it among the rest. Gus turned around heading towards the door. He stepped through, cold sweat gleaming  across his forehead. He ran his palm across it, wiping it away. He had to be tired, overworked. Too much sun at his day job. His mind quickly whisked away the strangeness of it. Like a mother turns a child away from a scene which they should not see. Gus sat down on the stool near the propped door.

 

Gino and the couple were still chatting and laughing. The occasional burst of light hearted giggles which come from catching up with friends, echoed out into the night air. Its warmth quickly cooled by the autumn breeze. Gus swung his foot absently. Letting his left leg hang as his right planted itself upon the brass ring foot rest which hung around the legs of the chair.

 

Gus would stare at the chairs sometimes, thinking of the stools as tiny cows, lassoed by an expert ring toss. He let the toe of his shoe scuff along the concrete. It was a comforting movement.  A sort of self hug. Gus watched the line of shadows bobbing in front of the taco truck across the street. Garish bright lights screaming out across the folding tables of people under the red canopy pop up tents.

 

A bar of led’s rolled across a large rectangle. Red, green and blue pixels reading “follows on tweeter, Gringa’s tacos.” A small animated  bird dancing as the image reversed, like a card being flipped over and over. A gray and brown cat emerged from the door of the bar. Black spots patterned across its fur. It strutted confidently, pausing to look up at Gus. Its apple green eyes blinking at him before resuming, and disappearing around the corner. 

 

Jameson had been a street cat once. In many ways he still was. A bartender from the far past found Jameson skulking outside. They began feeding him, bowls of food here. Shredded chicken from a taco courtesy of Gringa’s their. Little by little the cat became comfortable, eventually calling The Hawk home. Not much phased Jameson. Gus had seen him curled up into the seat of a booth while the bar was rowdy with music and the inebriated.

 

 Every new comer was mystified by the bar cat. Gus was asked, ""Whats his name?,"". ""Jameson,"" He would reply. Nine times out of ten his answer would leave them so pleased they would revert to baby talk. Petting Jameson as they cooed, as if he was the first cat they had ever seen.

 

It was an entertaining sight. Drunks at various stages, marveling at the cat. Dropping to a squat, holding out their hand and saying ""Jameson! Kitty, kitty, Jameson who soo boo boo,"" their speech breaking down to gibberish. Gus had learned most drunk people believed they were cat whisperers. About to crack the feline code, and Jameson would purr, cuddling at their beck and call. It never did work, and Jameson would walk past, uninterested, a black striped tail slowly waving care free. 

 

Beams of light poured into the lot. They bounced and settled against the wall near Gus as a large SUV parked. It was big and black, polished to a shine. Its trim an immaculate chrome. Gino and the couple had stopped talking now. They too were staring, watching the idling shining black bison of a vehicle. Both back seat doors swung open.

 

Two large men stepped from the doors. The vehicle lifted slightly, released from the girth of them. Barrel chested, black on black suits which shined. Identical twins, pale and muscular. Carefully poured into black silk. There skin was so pale it was almost gray. Eyes hidden behind black sunglasses. The two moved forward, stopping just in front of the vehicle. The men working on setting up the stage inside walked out from the door. Passing Gus and moving towards the SUV, past the pale brutes to the back of the vehicle. The trunk opened, the door of it swinging up on a slow arc. The vehicle sprang up, relieved of some immense weight.

 

The door to the trunk lowered out of sight as the two men scuttled like crabs from behind the vehicle, a large metal case held between them. They grunted and shuffled past the twins. Wrestling to haul the box forward into the building. It was a steel crate, a simple design with clasps and hinges fastening the top and two metal handles along the sides.

 

Gus watched them pass, staring at the plain box. They grunted and heaved, disappearing through the door. Shadows of the two suited goons cast across Gus and the wall. The men stood, unmoving, hands clasped together in front of them as the SUV backed out and drove off into the night. Its red tail lights cast across the hooded figure like a wave of blood, who was now making their way across the street. Gus grumbled to himself. Some big wig DJ was gonna show up at any moment and this creepy hobo picks now as the time to pan handle?  Gus watched the figure move. Its movement was unsettling.

 

Like plastic sheeting, torn, black, floating weightless in water. The figure seemed to almost billow across the street.  Its black  robe hiding its form like a well kept secret. Gus stepped forward preparing to stop him. The awkward exchange, a verbal conflict which repeated in one form or another, ""Got a cigarette? Help a guy out, any change? a dollar?"" that or some sob story born of practice and fueled by an undying addiction.

 

But instead Gus paused. Watching as the black robed figure confidently stepped between the suited brutes, who followed along after quickly bowing to the figure.  A hollow coldness settled in Gus. An igloo, blue and cold camped in his stomach.

 

  ""It's him, he's here!"" Gino and the couple murmured.  

No fucking way, Gus thought. Yes, yes fucking way indeed. The mystery DJ, the no name legend. He, she, they, it, whatever had been standing across the street the whole time. Frozen, shadowed, staring from the darkness. It made Gus's head buzz, trying to grasp the reasoning. Like trying to grip water.

 

The figure reached Gus, the two goons close behind. He could see webs of purple veins creeping up from their black tailored collars. Their skin was ashen, pale like the belly of a trout. Gus felt that he did not want to see what lay under their black glasses. Pits with maggots rolling around like boiling water in the sockets. He could see the robe of the figure clearer now. The green neon sign reading the hawk, glowed down on them.

 

The light cast a sickening otherworldly quality, the folds and creases of the robe glinting like flabs of blackened flesh fuzzy with mold. The figure nodded at Gus, the hood appearing completely empty. Gus was a few feet away and no matter how he looked at it, it appeared as though the fabric of the robe was being worn by an invisible figure.

 

Gus felt his mind struggle as he stared at the empty hood. Trying to process what he was looking at. It had to have been a trick. Some sort of fabric,  a screen hiding the DJ's face. They passed through the door, Gino and the couple following close behind still murmuring.

 

 Gus stood up, picking up his stool and bringing it inside. He walked outside once more, retrieving the folding chalkboard sign which read taco Tuesdays, half off Modelos, tequila and micheladas.

 

He shut the sign and leaned it against the wall outside, the opposite panel of chalk facing out. It read, ""Closed for a private event, open again at 12:00 am.” He moved to close the front door. Flipping the kickstand up with his toe, grasping the handle in his hand. Jameson darted through the shrinking opening of the door. With two shucking clicks Gus turned the brass bolts locked and turned to take a seat. He had placed his stool back in the corner. The photo booth to his left by the door.

 

It would give him a good vantage point, tucked out of the way but able to watch the crowd for any shenanigans. Judging by the crowd and their required dress code he doubted any shenanigans would ensue. 

 

 

The music from the jukebox was now silent. Those same well dressed patrons and the bar staff were now sitting. One of the goons took a large glass. Tall and frosted, filled almost full of the green liquor. He handed it to the DJ who was just behind the stage obscured to the crowd sitting, but not to Gus. The glass was like a teacup in his gray gorilla fist hand. The DJ was deathly still. Only suddenly moving to take the glass. It moved like a bad animatronics. The shaky uncertainty of a fur clad character, aluminium creaking bones, clicking away as the song plays and you ride in a log across a river. It grasped it, appearing more as if the fabric was grasping it.

 

Two elephant trunks feeling for peanuts. It brought the glass up to its hood, leaning its head back efficiently draining the glass before handing it back to the goon. The two men who had hauled the metal crate in were now  elbows deep into its opened lid. They reached far in, lifting something dense, and low in the box.  The two pulled out a shining black turntable. Holding it in blue nitrile gloved hands. They moved, lifting it up onto the empty space of the table atop the stage.

 

It had the obvious look, two large circles where the records were set. Patches of buttons and panels across the free space beside the circles. That was where the similarities ended. The men began inserting the ends of plugs into holes along the sides. It was not an obvious plug panel, but more actual holes. The men carefully inserting them, using the end of their fingers gingerly. The hole suddenly snapped shut around the orange fluorescent plug.

Closing like the pupil of an eye shrinking to a pinprick as you shine a light across it. One of the men flinched, yanking his hand back as if he had been feeding chicken quarters to a crocodile.

 A bright blue fluid dribbled out of the hole, bleeding down around the cord. Which was sitting limp like a dead rabbit in the mouth of a snake. The whole thing looked like an art piece. An alien artifact. This DJ really went all out, pulled out all the stops. Gus thought to himself. He was impressed. 

 The turntable gleamed like the wing of some great black beetle. So slick it seemed wet. Ridges and pock marks covered its surface. The patterned texture like rib-cages and spinal cords. Gus stared at it longer and longer trying to convince himself it wasn’t pulsing. He was unable to, and relegated this perception to some air pump under a latex cover. Bravo, bravo, true craftsmanship.

The two men finished up and removed their gloves. They dropped them into the now empty metal container behind the stage before taking their seats. Both leaned down retrieving a glass of the same green liquid, downing them before sitting quietly. Murmurs and whispers died like the last embers of a fire as the hooded figure took the stage. His brooding bodyguards posted like sentries behind him. Silence fell upon the bar as the figure raised its arms. Not a cough, squeak of a chair shuffled under weight. Only a muted thrum of the air conditioning. Gus shifted quietly watching the figure hold his arms out. The silence made Gus nervous, like a rabbit under the shadow of a raptor.

The figure gently lowered its arms. The rate of speed, slow as a feather floating to the ground. After a time they were upon the turntable. A faint whirring sounded, followed by a series of clicks and chirps. Everyone watched, mesmerized, deathly still and just as silent. The figure reached within its robe. Disappearing into an unseen slit down the middle. Its arm returned, its unseen fingers holding what looked like a record. It had the shape and dimensions but was not the typical black shiny plastic. This was tan. A dirty white color, too much milk in coffee. Old bones. The figure lowered the disc, carefully setting it onto one of the turntables.",1,1755159702.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

———

It all began with my brother's death. Obviously, it was unexpected. He was fresh out of high school and already in search of a job.

He was never really the academic type, but at the behest of our parents, he had sent out a few college applications. Even though everyone in our family knew what the results would be, we still invited some of our extended family over for a little get together.

It was supposed to be a fun, light-hearted day. If it had remained that way, I wouldn't be here to tell you about what happened.

The first few applications were jokes. Jake had applied for some ivy leagues (Brown, Columbia, and Cornell). Next, he went for colleges in-state and closer to home. No acceptances there, either. As a last resort, he tried applying to a few community colleges. Still nothing.

Jake threw down the last rejection letter and laughed. It was no skin off his back. He wasn't offended or disheartened in the slightest. At least, not outwardly.

Mom and dad were disappointed, but it didn't last too long. Jake was more than capable of making a life for himself.

""I mean, obviously, it was doomed from the start,"" Jake said. He stood and picked up the knife beside his celebratory cake. He started sawing into our dessert, his blade slicing down with ease. He looked up and addressed his audience again. ""Come on. I graduated with a 1.6. You can't seriously think I'd get accepted anywhere.

It was a miracle that he'd graduated at all.

After his statement, his face pinched up. He set down the knife and pressed his hands against his stomach. He doubled over.

""God, my stomach."" Jake took a step back. He held up a hand as our mother started to approach him. ""I'm fine. I think that macaroni from earlier is disagreeing with—""

He exploded.

Chunks of charred flesh and blood began to rain down on us like confetti. People started screaming, their expressions morphing from joy and contentment to abject terror. I was frozen in place, left alone at the table as everyone else scattered. My brother's lower half collapsed to the ground, flopping over onto its side.

His body hit the floor, whatever remained of his insides slipped out from the cavern of his stomach. Blood seeped into the carpet, forming a large dark pool underneath my shoes. My throat constricted. I gagged, and before I could stop the urge, I fell to my knees and vomited.

The bile from my stomach stung my esophagus as it traveled out of my mouth. I coughed and gasped for air, my face warming up as tears throbbed in my eyes.

Jake was dead. Worse than dead. He was scattered everywhere in the house. His blood had splattered along the ceiling, the furniture, the kitchen and its appliances. Everywhere I turned my gaze, I was cursed with another image of gore. A second wave of nausea washed over me.

I threw up again.

That was only the first explosion in the family. After that, all of the college-aged children began to die. It became an obvious pattern.

For some reason, people in my family died from college rejections.

Mindy flunked out of damn near every class she attended, but one community college accepted her. That was enough to appease the exploding gene or curse or whatever fucking entity was out there doing this to us.

Jaime wasn't as lucky as Mindy.

It was a few weeks after Jake died. I was still feeling like hot shit rotting away under a sunny clear sky when Jaime sent out an invite to his grad party. I wasn't too keen on attending, but my mom and his mom were best friends. She wanted to go, so I had to follow her.

When we got to the party, Jaime was all smiles. Most everyone was outside in the backyard, dancing along to a shitty nightcore playlist.

I didn't recognise anyone outside of my family, so I hovered near Jaime and hung out with our cousins as he jumped around between his friends.

I felt a tap on my shoulder. Beside me was my cousin Mindy.

""Hey, how are you holding up?"" She asked. Mindy was two years older than me — a junior in high school. We weren't super close anymore, but we had gotten along pretty well as kids.

""Not great,"" I answered. That was an understatement. My brother fucking exploded right in front of me. How does someone recover from that?

Mindy nodded, expecting the reply. I knew she was trying to make me feel better, but I wasn't in the mood to socialise. My head hurt and I was starting to get all tetchy and restless. We watched as Jaime started opening up his grad gifts.

God, he had such a stupid dopey smile. He reminded me of Jake with his larger than life personality. Jaime was loud, not only in terms of voice, but with his actions. He leaned on other people when he had a laughing fit, he jumped and ran when someone needed his attention, and he spoke with his hands, which were thrown around wildly the more passionate he became.

Jaime was just like Jake in those aspects, and it hurt to see.

""I'm sorry I missed his funeral. I had to go to remedial classes,"" Mindy said.

""It's fine, not like you could've skipped."" I didn't want to think about Jake. I was already miserable enough being here.

""No, it's not fine. Jake was one of my best friends, and you used to be one of them, too. I'm really sorry, Cam."" Mindy reached out and placed her hand against my arm. It was a small gesture, but I felt ready to collapse.

In the weeks after his death, people avoided me, including my parents. They buried themselves in work. I couldn't blame them for it. I hated spending any time in our house: in the place marked by my brother's gruesome death.

My parents were rarely home, my friends didn't know how to treat or comfort me, and my teachers gave me space to grieve. No one had given me any reassurance like Mindy.

I wanted to cry. I could feel the tears pricking at my eyes.

Jaime started tearing into his mail. He opened one envelope after the other. With each one he read, his expression dimmed just a little bit more.

Bad news, then.

And then he fucking exploded.

""Fuck!"" I cried as I scrambled back, tripping over air and falling onto my ass. Jaime's dismembered arm crashed down onto the concessions table. The shitty plastic buckled under the sudden weight. The glass punch bowl shattered as it tipped over, and the cupcakes flattened against the lawn.

The screaming started up again. People ducked for cover, people started sobbing and panicking. I was numb to it this time, probably not yet recovered from the shock of Jake's death. Mindy was somewhere behind me; she stood close enough that I could hear her choked crying.

I sat back and watched as people ran around like headless chickens, nearly colliding into each other. With shaking hands, I pulled out my phone and dialled 911.

After Jaime, next summer, Jeff was the next to die, and then Lauretta. Sarah, Sam, George, and Beau came the following year.

Yeah, I've got a lot of cousins. And yeah, none of them were very good at school.

My family tried a variety of different things to rid ourselves of the curse. We tried changing diets, becoming more altruistic, but nothing helped with the explosions.

With a very long string of deaths behind her, we expected Mindy to go out the same way. But she proved us wrong. The only difference between her and the rest of our cousins was her one single college acceptance letter.

After that, my remaining cousins locked in. Overnight, anyone that was failing turned into a rigid scholar. I tried my best, but after years of slacking off, I couldn't do it.

I failed out of high school. I dropped out and gave up. Since I never completed high school, I couldn't send my transcript in to any colleges. I packed up my bags and headed out west, hoping to start a new life.

It was good for a few months. I found a job as a dishwasher and I started to settle down. I fell into a nice routine and lived a quiet life.

I didn't have any higher aspirations for myself. I was totally fine — more than happy, actually — to live paycheque to paycheque.

But alas, I guess you really can't run away from your problems.

This morning, when I got my mail, I flipped through the envelopes disinterestedly. Bills, adverts, spam. I expected the usual, and that was mostly what I got.

At the very bottom of the stack, much to my horror, was a letter from a university I never applied to. Now, it could be an advertisement trying to entice me with post-secondary education. Or maybe someone in my family was attempting to play a cruel prank on me.

I don't know why it's here. I don't plan on opening it, but still, I feel dread forming as an ache in my stomach.

The weight of anxiety is making feel flushed and sluggish. Before I go to bed, I'll need to turn up the A.C. a bit, too. It's getting way too hot in my room.",1,1755159692.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

**On Valentine’s Day, my boyfriend gave me a designer handbag.** 

**When I had it authenticated at the Prada boutique, the verdict was swift, fake.** 

**But William Ashford swore up and down it was genuine.** 

**He even flashed an order screenshot at me, Prada’s official flagship store, total: $3,200.** 

**I was baffled.** 

**So I posted the whole thing online.** 

**One highly upvoted comment caught my eye:** 

**“Am I the only one seeing the red flag here? Why does the screenshot only show half the order?”** 

**“What’s on the part that’s cut off?”** 

**I didn’t get it at first, so I asked.** 

**WEY** 

**“Maybe he bought two bags, one real, one fake. He gave you the fake one but used the real one’s receipt to fool you.‘** 

**My stomach dropped.** 

**My hands were shaking so badly I almost dropped my phone.** 

**The commenter added:** 

**“The question isn’t whether your bag is fake or not. It’s who got the other bag.”** 

**w** 

**That post haunted me all day.** 

**When my coworker pointed out again that my bag looked off, I’d already taken it to the boutique for verification.** 

**The answer had been the same, fake, and not even a good fake.** 

**Nobody wants to get a knockoff for Valentine’s Day.** 

**I couldn’t help it, I asked William directly.** 

**He looked utterly wounded, like I’d just accused him of a felony.** 

**Right away, he sent me another screenshot.** 

**“I wanted to take you to pick it out yourself, but I’ve been swamped with overtime. So I just ordered one from the flagship store.”** 

**The screenshot was crystal clear, latest Prada release, $3,200.** 

**Could a fake even be sold on the official site?** 

**I posted about it again… and got another unexpected wave of replies:** 

**“Half an order screenshot means he’s hiding the other half.”** 

**“If the fake came from somewhere else and the real one from the flagship store… then he bought two. The cut–off part is the fake’s** 

**order.*****”*** 

**“Forget the bag, you’ve been robbed, girl.”** 

**Comment after comment scrolled by.** 

**It felt like a boulder had lodged in my chest.** 



**in a divided village, a young man from the lower village falls for his childhood friend** 



**I was already suspicious.** 

**And for the first time in our relationship, I wanted to see his phone.** 

**I just needed to see the full screenshot.** 

**Noticing how quiet I’d been, William came over and wrapped an arm around my shoulder.** 

**“Still hung up about the bag?”** 

**“How about I take you to the boutique this weekend, so you can pick whatever you want.”** 

**His eyes were warm and sincere.** 

**Then he pulled an orange keychain out of his pocket.** 

**I recognized it instantly, it was a PixieTear Collectible Figurine I’d seen online.** 

**“…Since when do you buy stuff like this?”** 

**“My wife’s upset. Of course I’m gonna get her a little gift to cheer her up.”** 

**“She’s called CryDuck, hangs on your bag, pretty cute, right?”** 

**He said it so casually.** 

**But I felt like someone had thrown a bucket of ice water over me.** 

**I’d known William for ten years.** 

**He was a literature–loving engineering guy who’d always scoffed at pop–culture trinkets.** 

**And now he just happened to have one in his pocket?** 

**The commenter was probably right, someone had stolen my place in his life.** 

**I forced a smile, pretending he’d succeeded in cheering me up.** 

**“There’s a package downstairs I ordered. Could you grab it for me?”** 

**I handed him my phone.** 

**“The tracking number’s in there.”** 

**Without a hint of suspicion, he set his own phone down on the coffee table.** 

**My heart leapt into my throat.** 

**I entered the passcode I knew by heart and went straight to his order history.** 

**The moment I saw it, it felt like a sledgehammer to the chest.** 

**Pain jolted through me so sharply I shivered.** 

**There it was, the full screenshot, showing two bags.** 

**One real. One fake.** 

**The real one: $3,200.** 

**The fake: S120 from Yorkshire Leatherworks.** 

**The commenter had nailed it.**
