i recently started a serving job and have been working the morning shifts multiple times a week, and these last anywhere between 4-7 hours long. for anyone who’s a server, you know this work involves a lot of small talk and chit-chat with customers and coworkers alike. furthermore, it’s a very busy fast-paced place, so there’s not much time for me to drink, eat, or go to the washroom - usually i’ll just take a swig of water or coffee in the minute or two i have between checking on my tables.

my question is: should i book off some time from work once i get the botox procedure done??? i am SO SCARED of uncontrollably burping in front of my tables and grossing them out when they’re literally there to eat (and from what i’ve read here, chances are i won’t be able to control my burps for a week or two).

what would you guys recommend? are the burps easy to hide? if not, how much time should should i book off for medical reasons? the money is quite good - i could spare a week or so - but i’m still so new here i’d hate to request too much time off. (i’ve burped like 10 times ever so maybe this is a silly question but please help lol)

TLDR; im a server, and am afraid of burping uncontrollably in front of my guests after procedure. what should i do?",1,1769399050.0,noburp,0,1.0,False

this is kind of a lot to unpack so I'll try to make it easy to follow

my son's dad will call him Kyle (now, 39M), and I met and quickly formed a close relationship when I was just 20. we moved way too fast, and after dating for only 4 months we wanted to have a baby, after trying for what seemed like no time at all I was pregnant and already living with him at his parents house. his family was great and I loved them all and they loved me. about two months into my pregnancy with my son I started to feel very differently about the whole situation, looking back I realize it was all hormones. there was absolutely nothing he did wrong but I would get physically ill at the thought of being around him or even talking to him on the phone, I was repulsed and had no control over it and no real reason why, but I felt trapped and decided to move out right away. he tried very hard to smooth things over, but I wanted nothing to do with him. I pushed him away, but I kept him informed of all things involving my health and our unborn child. not too long after he met another woman at his job at Walmart and quickly they became serious, i didnt know any of this at the time... she was/is 20 years older than him and we will call her Jess. later in my pregnancy my hormones settled down at about 20 weeks, half way. and I tried to initiate things with him again. he then told me about Jess but I didn't think it was  too serious because it hadn't been that long and I mean I was pregnant with his child. so we had a few ""fun time"" chats and meet ups and he insured me he was ending things with her.... yet he never did. so she obviously found out and they had a huge fight. I decided I was better off without that kind of guy, but still wanted him involved with our child's life.  she was jealous and reasonably so and wanted all communication cut off I guess, so he blocked my number, this was about 1 month before my due date with my son. I went into labor 3.5 weeks early.. I couldn't get ahold of him so he missed our sons birth. I was later reprimanded by his mother for not contacting her to reach him.. but he had cut me off and none of them had reached out to me so I didn't feel it was my responsibility to go out of my way.

 (also side note Kyle had a 5yo son living out of state that he didn't get to see because he was 20hrs away living with the child's mother, he's paid child support for him and rarely ever saw him but when we were together he called him every day to say goodnight) 

Kyle came to the hospital 2 days after I delivered and met his son. but we had no communication passed that. he never reached out. and despite the fact that my son and I had moved into an apartment that just so happened to be directly across the hall in the same complex and his gf Jess's daughter who was about my age, they visited her often but never knocked on my door to ask if his son needed anything. this went on for 2.5 years. no contact. I eventually reached out to Jess to kind of start some kind of relationship with my son and his father Kyle. I still think if I had never done this, he'd have nothing to do with our son. so eventually over time of just weekends that were convenient for them and only direct communication with Jess we've established a every other weekend during the school year and every other week during the summer visitation without going through the courts, we've never established paternity, we both know without a doubt my son is Kyle's son, but he never wanted to pay child support so I didn't push it. FFwd to Today

I have never asked Kyle for any kind of support. and have never kept our son from him, we have developed a good parenting relationship, and even Jess and I get along, and I would even somewhat consider her a friend.  we sit at our son's sporting events together and everything and even chat on the phone a little linger than what's necessary and she's even offered to pick me up a coffee from Duncan on her way to pick up my son for the weekend on occasion.  

I was married and divorced in the gap of time in this story. and since my divorce I've met someone new and have been with him for about a year, well call him Mike(39M) me and my two kids have moved in with Mike. (Mike also is divorced with 3 teenage kids and pays a ton in child support and his ex is absolutely horrid.) anyway, I have started college full time and since I've decided to quit working to focus on school and finish my schooling faster to get back to work in my new career path. all this to better support my kids. it's weird for me because I have ALWAYS worked to support us. so I have had to ask Kyle to cover more of our son's expenses for school sports. he knows I am not working right now, and he is also in a better spot financially then when we met, (a master mechanic for a big company) he and Jess are obviously still together, and she is not working right now either. I have always covered my son on insurance and paid for all his expenses up till this last year when I asked for a little help with sports stuff, of which he offered to pay for half... knowing I have no income and my bf would be footing the other half, no huge deal but considering Kyle's other son is grown and his house is inherited and his income is comfortable, it's kind of difficult for me to wrap my head around. my bf says maybe I should talk to him but it's always a touchy subject. so instead I applied for cash benefits through the state.. well you all probably already know they wanted me to cooperate with child support agency so I withdrew my application for child support immediately. I did reach out to Kyle and tell him my situation in a text message because I was so nervous.  I told him about applying and canceling my application and why..  and I asked him if he was willing to help me out while I was in school with our son's expenses, essentially asking him for child support in the amount of whatever he was comfortable with, without taking it through the court system. 

Kyle has left my message on read for about a week now with absolutely no response.  no hey let me talk it over with Jess, or let me look over my finances, no nothing....

He is definitely not perfect and I get upset with him quit a lot, but overall I have a good relationship with my dad.

I hate my mom and wish she was dead.

So I started my job search maybe 6 months ago. I didn’t love my job and decided to start applying and see how the job market was. I wasn’t seriously applying and as expected just got rejections.

Then my job got very stressful very fast and I started taking my job search seriously. I called my dad crying because I was stressed. That happened only once, about 4 months ago.

He FREAKED OUT. maybe that’s understandable because if I was a parent and my kid called me crying saying they hated their job I would also be worried. But my dad apparently took it to an extreme and started tracking down every person he knows who could possibly give me a referral and shake them down for a referral for me.

So far in 4 months, not one single referral has turned into an interview. Every interview I have gotten has been from me cold applying. Every time he calls me saying talk to x and y and z and so and so, it just adds more work to my plate. I have told him this.

He even called me on Christmas Eve because he found out that a son of a friend at the party he was at worked at Amazon. He called me saying “talk to name” and he handed off the phone. I heard him saying can you talk to my daughter and give her a referral. It’s insane.

My mom says (and I don’t fully believe her because she’s also a great liar and always exaggerates everything) that my dad has been shaking down every one of her friends also, asking what they do, asking everyone at church for a referral for me, and generally making me look like a pathetic person who can’t handle a little bit of stress.

Come to this weekend. My birthday weekend. Yay. They drive to me about 6 hours and stay in a hotel. Friday we have dinner with a family friend who I am also friends with. This is fine. My dad tells me to give my phone to my mom so she can send a message to someone who gave me a referral to who lives close by so they can meet up for food. I think wtf but I don’t want to start an argument so I do it. I don’t know why she can’t do it on her own phone or why he can’t do it on his own phone. We plan to meet for coffee on Sunday.

Saturday morning they go look at houses (because they also want to move here closer to me yay 🙃) and in the afternoon we go to meet some of their friends. Supposedly these are close friends who they have known since before I was born. Surprise surprise the father and the son work for Apple I wonder why we are suddenly going to meet their friends. My dad starts talking about me and makes me sound like a materialistic bitch in front of the people he wants to ask for a referral from. (Omg she refused to drive a minivan in high school she demanded a new car. HE DROVE THE MINIVAN FOR WORK!!!) Anyway this family is honestly fine, we go for a hike and get dinner together. After we leave my mom complains (about their friends of 20+ year) calling them stupid because they took us to have an American dinner and don’t they know she only eats Chinese food.

I start an argument on the car ride back to my apartment about meeting the dude on Sunday for coffee. Why do we have to? What is the point? My mom starts yelling at me and saying I need to ask him about his job and the startup he works for so I can be ready for the interview, how will I pass the interview if I don’t know anything about the company. At this point I shut up and uh huh my way through even if I think it’s insane that all 3 of us are meeting this guy to interrogate him about my interview and how I can prepare. She says omg I need to pray (she’s also super religious which is funny because she’s literally from hell). And god will work it out. And don’t I dare quit my job.

Whatever. at this point I feel like shit because in the 6 years I’ve been out of the house I have forgotten how to deal with my mom’s moods and how to calm things down. I call my dad when they go back to the hotel and apologize for making things worse for him and he says that I know she can’t be reasoned with so I don’t need to try and don’t worry about him. We talk more about his cancer and surgery and how likely it might metastasize and he tries to reassure me and say everything will be ok.

Sunday morning they go see another house. In the afternoon we drive to the coffee shop. My mom and I go in and sit down, my dad stays with the car because he thinks people will break in and smash the windows and steal stuff if no one’s there. The guy arrives and honestly we have no a fine conversation except for my mom. She talked about how I said I feel like I’m working at a retirement home (I never said that) and I’m so tired of the work (true). He asked me how many hours I was working and I said 40 except for oncall weeks and my mom said “she picks up a phone once in a while” (that’s not what oncall is). She then says that my dad isn’t here because their friend asked them to send a package to her daughter who lives in the city and my dad went to deliver it. There is no friend and no daughter, they are made up. My dad comes in at the end and lo and behold this guy actually told my dad how to park and therefore knows my dad has not been out delivering a package but he doesn’t say anything about it.

We wrap up eventually and Guy leaves. I tell my mom there was no need to lie about my dad delivering a package and she says it’s already over and to stop blaming her (this is a threat).

We drive back to my apartment and have dinner. They go back to their hotel.

They are leaving tomorrow morning. Happy birthday to me.

So, out of politeness, I responded and texted back and forth with him. 

He told me he just moved to my town (I assume he knows where I lived from my cousin) and wanted to reach out to make friends. The problem is I just graduated college and moved across the country. I told him I have family members in the town still if he wanted to have more local people to connect. He kind of ignored me and continued with saying he just wants to be friends. I took his words for it and chatted some more with him (about where I work, where he works, etc.). The whole conversation took 2 HOURS because he wouldn’t stop texting until I say I need to go.

I thought that was it but then he would continue to text me EVERYDAY. I tried to slow down my response but the moment I responded to a text, he would text back right away (like considering the time zone difference, I wonder if he is ever away from his phone). He always tries to ask when I would visit home so he can take me around for coffee. One time I mentioned I want to visit Japan, and he asked me to go on a Japan trip with him. I’ve never met him so it’s crazy to me he will just suggest that. Also, when he texts me he would sends 12+ messages in a row in span of 1 minute. Even when I don’t respond, he would send more questions. I’m starting to get hints that he is chatting with me for ulterior motives than being a friend. I don’t want to be rude because he is friend of my cousin who I respected but the thought of this being something else for him is disturbing me, considering our age difference. 

Am I overreacting or is this behavior inappropriate? I definitely don’t want him to talk badly about me to my cousin so I have been trying to be polite and answer his texts (albeit 2-4 days after to create distance but he is still as persistent). How would you handle this? I’m worried that if I confront him he will turn the table on me and say he was just being nice.",0,1769398793.0,TwoXChromosomes,2,0.5,False

For the past 3 months, since October I’ve not really been able to sleep soundly. But over the past month and a half it’s to the point where I’m sleeping 4 hours a night, max - Getting up for work and performing, rinse repeat.

I either crash out early in the night from exhaustion and I’m forced awake by nightmares that have me wetting the bed with sweat, or I just lay there in the dark wide awake and unable to sleep.

I went through a breakup back in the end of summer 2025 and used Amitryptaline  as a sleep crutch for a bit to make sure I could still function, fulfill my responsibilities and work. Before I used those I was demolished and at one point went 4 days with 0 sleep and was outright delirious and borderline manic…

I got to a point in November where I felt really good, was making strides in the gym, consistent sleep schedule, secured a new job, went out for meals, was overall alright - December came around and I dont really know what happened, I haven’t slept more than 3-4 hours a night since early December.

My nightmares are back, on the rare occasion I get to REM sleep and awake me to a bed soaked with sweat and an insane heart rate.

I’ve tried starving myself of sleep, forcing myself through the day and then going to bed early - No joy.

No matter what, even though I might be exhausted, I just feel awake, like I can’t switch off.

I’m lay in bed at this very moment and I start work in 5 1/2 hours, on some occasions I’ve slept just 1 hour and gone through a day of work.

Hoping for some help or insight before this starts to impact my cognitive function and my ability to learn/work.

—Well, yeah...

He is interrupted.

—Don't worry, I'm not jealous. Just curious—He smiles mischievously— Although there's something else that makes me curious.

—Really?— He returns the smile

—Well, you're a cop. Control is part of you. But tell me, do you like to keep it even behind closed doors.— He barely raises his eyebrows with that smile he's had all day.

With this, Tom gets up from the table, leaving the money to pay there. For more. As if that would soften the fact of his ""Flight"" Anyway, he left the place, saying goodbye to Lucas with a ""bye""

Already in the car, he sat with his feet on the seat. His knees pressed to his face. And the tears wetting them. The knot in his throat intensified. As did the blood coming from his fists. He isolated himself there, in his car. Far from the whole world. Or so he thought.

I had just closed mine, so was more like recording a “best practices” for myself more than anything else. 

  
Did about 5 or 6 of these 25-30 min monologs and noted they’re getting traction.  All in all I recorded about 27 sessions ranging from 3 min to 1 hr, and then stopped.  I felt like I said all I had to say about starting and running a coffee shop.  And stopped recording or tracking it for about 3 years now. 

  
The podcast is at about 26K downloads and still gets about 50 sessions a day and has about 400 subscribers.

Sorry for Long Read. Just needed guidance from whoever is willing to respond.

I talked/dated 8 months a girl with real emotional connection, trust, and intimacy, but no official label. She got upset about the lack of commitment and went no-contact for 2 weeks. I reached out around New Year to confess feelings and want exclusivity. She said she felt strongly and saw a future but it wasn't realistic right now-priorities, encouraged me to date others. Then hugged me and asked to go to the movies: cuddling, kissing, she vlogged us. Light texting after (2 AM ""awake?"" when scared alone, l offered safe space, she called me ""dear & love,"" asking me for pictures of my face). When I suggested hanging out she said ""why crumbs?"" then ""hanging out defeats the purpose."" I apologized for misreading—no reply.

Socials: She blocked me from stories (was still following), friend saw her at coffee shop with guy. Mutuals confirmed she's was out on a date. Impulsively, I unfollowed → 5-8 min later full block everywhere. Then she posted

""normalize walking away from someone who makes you doubt your worth...""

After a week or so, I mailed a handwritten apology letter owning the half commitment (""you deserved to be my girlfriend, sorry I left you doubting""), not breaking habits, business distractions, selfish moments, thanked her for showing me what a good woman is, respected her autonomy, wished her well-no expectations.

Here was her response:

She texted back 2 days later (Today):

“Hey

I suck at expressing how I feel or let alone put words together so if this sounds bad I'm sorry beforehand.

Everything you said makes sense, and I'm happy you were able to express yourself. I think a lot of what you shared are things we already talked about in person. But, I'm truly grateful for you and for the time we spent together - you definitely weren't just any guy to me. You were like my best friend during the time we shared, and I adored you in every way. Sometimes, things change, and as much as I wanted to be with you, I knew I had to stay true to my feelings, and my boundaries. In my head, I didn't want to go into something having doubts.

I don't want to re-explain what we have already talked about in person, but I do appreciate you acknowledging everything you wrote. It means a lot to know that you listened to what I told you and do care :p

I'll ALWAYS wish you the best, and I hope you continue to thrive and win!! Lastly, l'm not looking for a response either I just wanted to acknowledge & let you know what we had was very much so real. God Bless.”

I expected her not to respond to the letter toh. I really do respect the message but I guess my mind still hopes things could have been different. I realized too late.

So if anyone is planning to go to Benne, don’t go on weekends, and try to go early. I don’t know why, but whenever a restaurant or place goes viral on Instagram reels, everyone just rushes there. I experienced the same thing earlier with Songline show.

1qn4x0s,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepsandcrimes/comments/1qn4x0s/is_my_bestie_using_me_for_money_advice_column/,Is my bestie using me for money? Advice Column!,"Hi girlies,

I wrote in on the advice column about how I think my bestie is using me for money… and you guys yelled at me to give you some more info so here it is 🤣

In the fall transferred to a new to me college that is near my hometown. I quickly became friends with this girl, we’ll call her Lily. I knew Lily prior to college because her mother was my high school drama coach and she lived in the next town over. Now to the story. 

The first incident that was a little sketch with Lily was when her car broke down on the side of the road; I am someone who likes to spend money, but not on myself. I felt horrible for her because she had no money for a tow truck, so I gave her $50. I told her it can count as payment for gas money for her driving me to my apartment (10 min walk) after choir sometimes. However, she didn’t use the $50 for the tow truck… her parents and bf paid for it. That was the first red flag ish, but she’s my bestie so it was fine. 

With her having no car, I kind of became the designated driver, which I didn’t mind but sometimes it felt like I was only invited to be the driver…

Other than that, Lily would constantly not want to go out to eat or for drinks because she was “broke.” Obviously I didn’t want her to be left out, so me and my other friend kind of took turns paying for her. That’s what friends do! Yet, somehow, she still had money to go to the on campus coffee store almost every day, which annoyed me. And also still had money to doordash literally every restaurant you could think of to her door. 

Side note, she also needed $15 to start a feet finder, and me being the supportive bestie, I gave it to her. 

Finally, over winter break, we had barely talked. I was kinda sad because she’s my friend we see eachother every day at school, and now she wasn’t talking to me as much. She ended up messaging me about a sweatshirt she was selling (our school name on it, she was in the process of transferring to a school 10 min away), and I said I’d take it. Used, nike sweatshirt, I told her “$20?” and she said “oh I was going to sell it for $45”. Okay, get that bag girl, but for a used sweatshirt? I might be exaggerating but that’s kinda crazy especially when going to a friend! I politely passed on the offer and a week ish later she messaged me again. She asked if I would take it for $35 because she didn’t want to go through the trouble of putting it on Facebook. Reluctantly, I told her I would take it. A week ish passes, after small talking throughout winter break, and she messages me:

“hey i'm so sorry but is there any way you could send me to $35 for that quarter zip? i need to buy my textbooks because i go back in a week. i would super appreciate it if you could and i will get it to you asap”

I don’t know how you guys talk to each other, but this is insane wording idk 😭. I obliged and gave her the money, even though she has a job, she just never works it! 

Last but not least, I became close with her various roommates. She lives in a decently big house, with 4 other roommates, one being her boyfriend, and only pays $200 a month. Well, should only pay. One of her roommates was the “owner” of the house they lived in, and he gave me some crazy info. She owed him $800+ in rent. She just hasn’t been paying him. As her bestie, I heard all the roommate complaints how she didn’t want to live there and I was on her side, until then. 

Now to today. She goes to the other school, still doesn’t have a car, but still attends our choir. Her boyfriend can’t give her a ride to choir on certain days, so I pick her up from that school. Normally I don’t care about giving rides, but she hasn’t really been talking to me and honestly is being kind of a shitty friend. She talks to me when she needs a ride, barely invites me over to hang, etc. 

Am I missing something? Am I in the wrong and over exaggerating? I love Lily sooo much, and she genuinely is a good person, but it feels like she’s using me. I hope I’m not a bad friend for posting this, maybe I need to cut her off if this is how I feel? Idek how to ask someone if they actually want to be my friend lol I feel like I’m in middle school 🫠 Any advice would help. 

Anyways, sorry for the long post, love you girls! ",1,1769398518.0,creepsandcrimes,0,1.0,False

Sorry for Long Read. Just needed guidance from whoever is willing to respond.

I talked/dated 8 months a girl with real emotional connection, trust, and intimacy, but no official label. She got upset about the lack of commitment and went no-contact for 2 weeks. I reached out around New Year to confess feelings and want exclusivity. She said she felt strongly and saw a future but it wasn't realistic right now-priorities, encouraged me to date others. Then hugged me and asked to go to the movies: cuddling, kissing, she vlogged us. Light texting after (2 AM ""awake?"" when scared alone, l offered safe space, she called me ""dear & love,"" asking me for pictures of my face). When I suggested hanging out she said ""why crumbs?"" then ""hanging out defeats the purpose."" I apologized for misreading—no reply.

Socials: She blocked me from stories (was still following), friend saw her at coffee shop with guy. Mutuals confirmed she's was out on a date. Impulsively, I unfollowed → 5-8 min later full block everywhere. Then she posted

""normalize walking away from someone who makes you doubt your worth...""

After weeks I mailed a handwritten apology letter owning the half commitment (""you deserved to be my girlfriend, sorry I left you doubting""), not breaking habits, business distractions, selfish moments, thanked her for showing me what a good woman is, respected her autonomy, wished her well-no expectations.

Here was her response:

1qn4uge,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1qn4uge/how_to_reignite_your_joy_when_life_feels_like_a/,How to Reignite Your JOY When Life Feels Like a Slow Death By Routine: The PSYCHOLOGY That Actually Works,"You know that feeling when you wake up and realize you haven't actually *felt* anything in months? Not sad exactly. Just...flat. Like someone turned down the volume on your entire existence and forgot to turn it back up.

Spent way too long thinking something was broken. Turns out it wasn't. According to research from the Greater Good Science Center at Berkeley, emotional numbness is one of the most underreported symptoms of chronic stress and modern burnout. Not depressed in the clinical sense, just...existing. Going through motions. Checking boxes.

After diving deep into psychology research, neuroscience podcasts, and honestly some really good books that should've been read years ago, realized something wild: joy isn't something you lose, it's something you forget how to access. Your brain literally rewires itself based on what you pay attention to, and most of us have been paying attention to the wrong shit.

Here's what actually helped.

**Stop waiting for permission to feel good**

We've been conditioned to earn joy. Finish the project first. Lose the weight first. Get the promotion first. Then you can be happy.

Bullshit.

Dr. Laurie Santos teaches the most popular course in Yale's history called ""The Science of Well-Being"" and her research shows that our brains are terrible at predicting what will make us happy. We think achievement brings joy, but the data says otherwise. Hedonic adaptation means that promotion or relationship or whatever you're chasing will feel good for like two weeks max before you're back to baseline.

**The fix:** Give yourself permission to feel good *now*. Not when you deserve it. Not when you've earned it. Right now.

Started with this stupidly simple practice from the book ""The Happiness Trap"" by Russ Harris. He's an acceptance and commitment therapy expert and this book completely rewired how to think about emotions. Instead of chasing happiness, he teaches you to make space for all emotions while doing what matters. Sounds basic but it's genuinely life changing. The core idea is that trying to feel happy all the time is what makes us miserable. Mind bending stuff.

Start noticing small good things without dismissing them. Your coffee tastes good? Actually acknowledge it for five full seconds instead of scrolling while you drink it. Sounds dumb. Works anyway.

**Reclaim activities that have zero productivity value**

When's the last time you did something purely because it felt good? Not because it was ""self care"" or would make you better at your job or whatever. Just because.

Research from the Journal of Positive Psychology found that engaging in creative activities significantly increases positive emotions and reduces stress, even for people who claim they're ""not creative."" Your brain needs novelty and play to function properly.

Found one completely useless hobby. Zero ROI. Can't monetize it, can't optimize it, can't put it on LinkedIn. Just pure play. Literally just walking without phone and looking at weird houses in the neighborhood. Revolutionary.

**Audit your inputs like your mental health depends on it (because it does)**

Your brain is basically a prediction machine running on whatever data you feed it. If you're constantly consuming content about how the world is ending, your brain will predict that your world is also ending.

The book ""Stolen Focus"" by Johann Hari absolutely destroyed in the best way. He's an investigative journalist who spent years researching why we can't pay attention anymore. Spoiler: it's not your fault, it's by design. Social media companies literally employ attention engineers to make their platforms addictive. The book breaks down how our fragmented attention is killing our ability to feel anything deeply, including joy.

After reading it did a brutal audit. Unfollowed anyone who made you feel worse, even if their content was ""important."" Set actual boundaries with phone using app limits. Started mornings with a podcast instead of doomscrolling.

BeFreed is an AI learning app that pulls from research papers, expert interviews, and books to create personalized podcasts tailored to what you actually want to learn. Founded by Columbia University alumni and former Google experts, it lets you customize everything, the length (10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives), the depth, and even the voice. Want a smoky, sarcastic narrator or something calm before bed? Done. You can type in any struggle or goal, like ""help me reconnect with joy"" or ""understand emotional numbness,"" and it generates an adaptive learning plan with content from top psychology sources. There's also a virtual coach called Freedia that you can chat with anytime, pause mid-episode to ask questions, or get book recommendations based on your unique challenges. It's been genuinely helpful for replacing doomscroll time with actual growth, making the commute or laundry time feel less wasted.

Speaking of podcasts, ""We Can Do Hard Things"" with Glennon Doyle became an obsession. She talks about hard stuff but in this weirdly hopeful way. The episode about joy being an act of resistance literally made tears happen in the car. Good cry though.

**Reconnect with your body (yes really)**

When you're numb, you're usually living entirely in your head. Your body is just this annoying meat vehicle you drag around.

But here's the thing: emotions are *physical* before they're mental. Neuroscientist Antonio Damasio's research shows that we feel emotions in our body first, then our brain interprets them. If you're disconnected from your body, you're disconnected from your capacity to feel anything.

Started using Insight Timer for body scan meditations. It's free, has thousands of options, and you can filter by length. The 10 minute body scans before bed helped actually notice where tension was being held and slowly start releasing it.

Also, move in ways that feel good, not punishing. Dance badly in your kitchen. Stretch while watching TV. Take stairs because it feels nice to use your legs, not because you need to burn calories.

**Create tiny moments of anticipation**

Your brain releases dopamine not just from good things, but from *anticipating* good things. This is why looking forward to vacation is sometimes better than the actual vacation.

Started planning tiny things to look forward to. Tuesday night pizza. Saturday morning farmers market. Nothing huge. Just small pockets of ""oh yeah, that's coming up.""

The book ""The Power of Moments"" by Chip Heath and Dan Heath explores why certain experiences stick with us while others fade. They argue that we can engineer meaningful moments instead of waiting for them to happen. It's basically permission to intentionally create joy instead of passively hoping it shows up. Really practical stuff about breaking scripts, elevating experiences, and connecting with others.

**Let yourself want things again**

Numbness often comes from repeatedly wanting things and not getting them, so your brain just...stops wanting. Protective mechanism that absolutely sucks.

Start small. What sounds good right now? Not what should sound good. What actually sounds good. Maybe it's taking a different route home. Maybe it's texting that friend. Maybe it's buying the fancy cheese.

Your desires matter. Your preferences matter. You don't need a reason or justification for wanting what you want.

Joy isn't this big explosive thing you have to chase. It's quiet. It's ordinary. It's noticing that the light looks pretty. It's laughing at something dumb. It's feeling excited about your plans this weekend.

You're not broken for losing it. You're human for wanting it back.",1,1769398323.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False

1. Bolckow, Vaughan & Co.: Coal + Iron + Steel + Lead → prestige Steel

Shipyards +10%, Military Shipyards +10%

The British No.1 company. 3 mines + prestige steel. Buff is pretty average, but when it comes to industry coverage, only New Russia can really compete.

 

2. Bacardi Company: Food + Glass + Wine; prestige Spirits

\+0.1 Weekly Liberty Desire for subjects, +10% Art Academies

The new dlc Cuban company. Glass industry coverage is really good. Before recent patches, few companies offer it, and most glassworks company is either single-industry or has poor secondary outputs.  Useless buff though



3. Ford Company: Automobiles + Engines +rubber → prestige Cars

Engines +15%, Automobile Factories +5%

Last patch's undisputed #1. Post-1.9.6 stats: Michigan got occupied by non-American tags 114,514 times lmao. Still one of the strongest late-game options even after nerfs. The Rubber + Automobiles combo is extremely efficient for throughput and scaling. Engine bonus is top-tier among prosperity effects. Remains a high-priority pick for industrial runs.



4. Assam Company : Tea + Wood → prestige Tea

Tea Plantations +20%

The Romania Star of the beverage world. New patch massively buffed Tobacco, so if your pop has Tea Addiction (Britain, India especially) then go for it. Otherwise default Coffee company covers more broadly. But for raw ceiling chasing? Still recommend Assam Tea.

 

5. Erste Brünner: Engines + Tools + Power Plants → prestige Engines

Textile mills +10%, Power Plants +10%

The one and only true god of the new patch. Undisputed #1. Prestige Engines are the single strongest prestige good (Plantations all +13%, Oil Rigs +10%, Manufacturing 3–5%). Last patch prestige engine company (F. Schichau) has useless industry coverage which kinda nerf this no.1 prestige good. Brünn's industry coverage is extremely well-rounded, particularly with the inclusion of Tooling Workshops. In previous patches, companies that provided Tooling Workshops almost always came bundled with Engines, Steel, Automobiles, or similar industries. This caused severe overlap with strong options like Ford (Engines + Automobiles) and the coal-iron-steel companies, putting tooling workshop companies in an awkward spot—neither strong enough to prioritize nor weak enough to ignore completely. Best company in the game. Must open.



6.Maples Company : Furniture + Wood → prestige luxury Furniture

\+5% Prestige, +10% Bureaucracy

Among the big three luxuries(Porcelain, luxury furniture and luxury clothes), luxury furniture has the most accessible input (Clothes need rubber, Porcelain needs lead). Wood is everywhere in North/South America + Africa — super easy to make use of. And The +10% Bureaucracy is especially useful in the current patch where Elected Bureaucrats law is forbidden under Technocracy(if you want maximize your company numbers). Solid pick.



7.Anglo-Persian Oil Company: Oil + Power Plants → Oil +30%

Absolute legend. No notes. Super-sized Romania Star. Throughput king, must-open for ceiling. Other cultures can use mid-sized Romania Star as a substitute.



10B Britain run, 19.1 GDP per capita, SOL 42 — absolute chad.

We‘ve dissected giants, disruptors, and disasters. Now, let‘s extract the **ultimate hustle insight**: a **simple, reusable framework** you can apply to any business to see its hidden engine or fatal flaw.

This is not another case study. This is your **First-Principles Thinking Toolkit**.

**The Framework: The Two-Layer Business Dissection**
Every business operates on two interconnected layers:
1.  **The “What” Layer (The Visible Game):** The product, features, marketing, competition.
2.  **The “Why” Layer (The Hidden Game):** The **fundamental unit of value**, the **core economic or psychological driver**, and the **system designed to deliver it.**

**Winners dominate by mastering the “Why” layer and aligning the “What” layer to serve it. Losers get stuck optimizing the “What” while the “Why” changes beneath them.**

**Let‘s Apply It: A 2-Minute Business X-Ray**
Take any company and ask these two questions:

**Step 1: Identify the “Atomic Unit of Value” (The “Why”)**
*   *Ask:* “What is the **smallest, indivisible thing** the customer is truly paying for?”
*   *Examples from our series:*
    *   **Walmart/Southwest:** The lowest **cost per item/seat-mile delivered.**
    *   **Netflix:** A guaranteed, **anxiety-free hour of entertainment.**
    *   **TikTok:** A **dose of novel, validating attention.**
    *   **Salesforce:** **Business outcomes** with aligned risk (subscription).
    *   **Patagonia:** **Alignment with a belief system** (environmentalism).

**Step 2: Audit the “Delivery System” (The “How”)**
*   *Ask:* “Is every major part of the business (product, pricing, ops, culture) engineered to optimize or defend that atomic unit?”
*   *Examples:*
    *   **IKEA‘s flat-pack & DIY** optimizes for *low cost per delivered furniture.*
    *   **Duolingo‘s streaks & notifications** optimize for *daily engagement identity.*
    *   **Kodak‘s film factories** were optimized for the *chemical film* unit, blinding them to the *digital pixel* unit.

**The Inevitable Insight:**
Conflict arises when the “What” and “Why” layers are misaligned, or when a new competitor redefines the “Atomic Unit.” (See: Netflix vs. Blockbuster, Digital vs. Film).

---

**Your Turn: The “First-Principles Practitioner” Challenge**
This is the culmination of our series. To earn recognition as a **“Framework Analyst”**:

1.  **Perform a Live Dissection:** Apply the **Two-Layer Framework** to a company we *haven‘t* covered in detail.
    *   *Format:* “**Company:** [e.g., **Spotify**]
    *   **Atomic Unit of Value:** The *cost per hour of personalized, frictionless music discovery.*
    *   **Delivery System Audit:** Their algos (Discover Weekly) optimize *discovery;* the freemium model reduces *friction* to start; the podcast bet aims to increase *hours of audio consumed.* Their risk? The unit might shift to ‘*artist connection*,‘ which platforms like Bandcamp own.”

2.  **Propose a “Why” Shift:** For an existing business, propose how changing the defined “Atomic Unit” could unlock new value.
    *   *Format:* “**For a [Co-Working Space]:** Shift from selling ‘*desk-days*‘ to ‘*successful connections made between members.*‘ The delivery system would then focus on curated introductions, collaboration tools, and tracking deals done internally—not just wifi and coffee.”

**Why This Is The Final Boss:**
Mastering this turns you from a passive consumer of business news into an **active analyst.** You‘ll see opportunities and threats before they‘re headlines.

Of you and of us:  

80’s dance music  

Heavy on the synth  

Blaring from the speakers;  

Lights dazzling from  

A rotating silver ball  

Hung from the ceiling;  

A dimly lit dance floor  

Overflowing with  

Writhing bodies  

Moving energetically  

To the music’s rhythm.  

Amid the smoky room  

Of strangers dancing,  

You and I were spellbound  

In our own Universe together.  

We had fun dancing on that  

Freezing February night.  

Then we went for coffee  

After the bar closed.  

We enjoyed a fascinating  

And animated conversation  

Together, laughing and smiling.  

Your Gemini mind captivated me.  

We never were a couple  

In a serious relationship;  

We were good friends  

Enjoying each other’s company  

And having a good time.  

Decades later, I think of you  

As the anniversary  

Of your passing approaches.  

I don’t know if  

I ever told you this:  

Thank you for coming  

Into my life when  

Everything was chaotic  

And I needed an  

Understanding friend.  

Thank you for helping me  

Find the courage to  

Go on with my life,  

Despite some tragic losses  

I painfully endured alone.  

Thank you for opening  

My heart to love again.  

RIP to you (TW) my friend.  

I shall never forget  

You or your kindness.

I was told to be ""in the world, but not of the world"" i.e. live in society, but don't integrate too much. It gives you a smug sense superiority, but at the same time it makes you afraid of people outside the group, and if you're like me and grew up outside of Moridor that meant at least 95 percent of your peers. 

I remember being as young as eight and I would get really anxious to visit a nevermo's friends house for the off chance they might watch an R rated movie, have family that uses swear words, or have coffee with breakfast, etc. then awkwardly explain to them why you don't do those things. Getting into my teen years was when it really became difficult. My peers were using more profanity, we're discovering their sexuality, and had a greater ability to question me about my beliefs. I eventually just isolated myself from my peers almost entirely because it would be easier for me to just be faithful on my own rather than risk being led astray.

A promised, unfalsifiable paradise wating for me after death was more important to me than the certain life I was living in presently. Since decontructiong, I realized I missed out on some deeper, meaningful friendships growing up. Even now in adulthood, sometimes it still feels easier to just be alone and that is something I guess I have to work through. ",11,1769397836.0,exmormon,3,1.0,False

1qn4mfd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1qn4mfd/aio_my_girl_friend_might_have_started_dating_a/,AIO: my girl friend might have started dating a guy who we cut off from our group because he had boundary issue (acting like her boyfriend when she already has a boyfriend) + stalking/possessive behavior.,"My bf and I used to be in a friend group with two others (let's call them girl A and guy B) and the four of us would exercise a lot together almost 5-6 times a week and we were all good friends (to the point that we share location with each other on find my friends\* this detail will become relevant later in the story). Additional background: girl A and I are good friends before we invited guy B into our group. Also girl A has a long term boyfriend C but he doesn't exercise with us usually. My bf and I are not super close with C but we have always liked him and saw him regularly as well. 

Guy B is a single guy and as time went by, we started to notice guy B began to act like girl A's boyfriend and getting possessive with girl A (one time girl A and I had already completed our work out and agreed that we are done for the day, but guy B wanted to exercise more so he asked girl A to stay longer to exercise with him, and I just causally said ""oh no we are done for today"" and then guy B literally got unhappy and threw a tantrum towards A and somehow guilt tripped her enough that she gave in and kept exercising with him.) 

There are many times after the four of use completed our workout, we would leave the facility and head to our cars together and I noticed that guy B would always purposely stay behind to be close to girl A and some days they would sit in one car together and chat for hours. While I didn't think much of it at first, the pattern become more frequent and apparent- they would ""flirt"" with each other during our workouts and often being playful with each other (again, my bf and I didn't think much of it at first since all of us were close friends) but it got uncomfortable overtime as we noticed more and more. 

Additional background: during this time, we are also aware that girl A is having relationship problem with her boyfriend C. She would exercise with us for long hours 5-6 times a week and return home really late- we have expressed our concern to her asking oh is C okay with this? And girl A would always shrugged it off saying 'whatever'. 

As a few months went by, a lot of folks in our exercise circle began to notice A and B being 'romantically' close and had asked us ""oh are they together"" not knowing that A already has a boyfriend. Whenever being asked, I had always backed up and defended girl A saying 'oh no she has a boyfriend '. (I also answered that way at the time thinking/believing that A is just being friendly and she's oblivious of the situation) But as time went on, my bf and I also began to feel uncomfortable of how these two would act around each other knowing that A is NOT single. 

Eventually one day, I had called guy B up and I had asked him 'hey do you have feelings that's beyond a friend for A"" and he was being ambiguous/avoidant and dodging my question left and right and said ""idk"" . So I reminded him, ""it's not right to act on these feelings towards A if you do have romantic feelings for her. It doesn't matter if she's having relationship problem right now, out of respect for her relationship and her partner and the friendship of this group , you should not do such things"" (basically I told him to not be a home wrecker even if that home is kinda wrecked on its own already) and I thought he understood- he did not. 

Few weeks later, guy B threw another tantrum during our exercise time such that he walked out of the facility and we had called him to see what's going on telling him to come back and things got awkward in the group after that. He tried to make it up by making us pasta and dropping it off at my place and girl A's place (whom she shared a home with her boyfriend C) at the porch. And at that point girl A's bf C had caught onto something and had told girl A that how weird it is and trust that she won't do anything stupid. 

Few days later, girl A called me and my bf late at night and she spilled the tea. Essentially she told us that there were multiple instances where she would randomly 'run into' guy B at random places but she didn't think of it much at first. She said one time during exercise, she had mentioned to guy B that she was heading to Costco later during the day but did not say specific hours. That day she had gone home, ran some errands and then she went to Costco. As she was Costco doing her shopping, she said she had ran into B. And she also said one time after she had eaten lunch with the group, she said bye and went to get gas on the way home and she got a text from B asking her to go get coffee (just the two of them) and as she got the text she saw guy B driving by the gas station that she was at and this gas station was out of the way from B's path to go home- A said she got the chills and told him no I am already on the way home and B still insisted asking ""oh really?"" Girl A did not end up going to coffee with him and went home as planned. (She said she thinks that B had tracked her location to the gas station knowing that she wasn't far away from the restaurant where four of us ate together). Girl A showed us a few more evidence that guy B might be stalking her and definitely acting possessive of her. At that moment, we told girl A we are ready to cut off guy B once she talks to B himself about his problematic behavior. So the next day, A called B to confront him and told him the way he acts makes her uncomfortable and that she no longer wants to exercise with him 1 on 1 etc. So we ended up cutting B off completely as well since I am someone who's very protective over my friends and I carry very strong moral boundaries and cannot stand being friends with someone who have no respect for others' relationships. (also I am fully aware that this whole time, I did not put any blame on my girl friend A as I fully had believed that she's innocent but that might not be the case..) 

  
A month or 2 went by, my bf and I noticed that A and B are exercising together again in a group setting.. So I reached out to my friend A asking what's up out of concern and she said that she had talked it out with B and things are ""fine"" now- she said she just want to keep things neutral with B and she set her boundary by telling him she doesn't want to chat with him 1to1 but she doesn't mind exercising with him if he happens to be in a group setting with others because she doesn't want to make it awkward for others. I felt like her response was valid and I told her I respect her decision but I would remain my boundary with B since what he did still did not sit right with me so I do not want to engage with B. 

A few more months went by and during this time, girl A is working through some relationship problems with her BF C and they ended up breaking up after being together for almost a decade. Few weeks before the breakup, my bf had ran into B at the break room of the exercise facility and B stopped my bf and told him that 'you know it was never one sided right' and went on about how girl A is afraid to tell me the truth because of how I might react. Furthermore B mentioned to my bf how A had actually went to his place and cried and apologized for messing up and making him the bad guy of getting cut off etc... (which I wasn't sure if i should believe what B had told my bf) At that time I did not ask A about what B had said to my bf because just a week prior, A had told me explicitly that she never liked B like that it was just that B happened to  be around to sit there and just listen to her (which she wasn't able to get from her partner at home). I am fully aware of what B had told my bf vs what A had told me are conflicting information (A liked B romantically vs A did not like B romantically  when A was very much still in a relationship) and few of my other friends have reminded me that maybe A isn't as oblivious/innocent as she seems- B wouldn't have made the advances if he didn't see an opportunity that was possibly opened up by A and it's a possibility that A perhaps indeed did not have romantic feelings for B but she did enjoyed the attention she was getting from B that she wasn't getting from her own partner C at the time.  

Fast forward to now which is few weeks after A's breakup with her long term partner, we began to notice that 1. A has been very distant /avoidant with me (which I understand that she's going through a breakup and needs her own space but I feel like it might be more than that) 2. A and B are being playful/flirtatious during exercise but  this time 1-1. As A's friend, it confused me that we had showed up/supported her and went as far as cutting B off based on what she had told us but she ended up just going back to him like nothing had happened- reconnects with B, gets close again, and possibly even dating him now (merely just a few weeks after her long term relationship breakup), and doesn't proactively talk to us about it. While she has every right to choose who she dates/spends time without justification to me, I can't help but feel confused, invalidated and lowkey betrayed.? In a way, I am feeling my loyalty to A was unacknowledged and also a lack of transparency from my friend A and I am not sure how to process these feelings. I am almost at a point where I am not sure how to continue this friendship with A or is this whole time I am just over estimating the importance of my friendship with A.

On paper, I look fine. I work full-time in IT. I budget carefully. I don’t gamble, overspend, or live irresponsibly. But I’m still drowning, and it’s exhausting trying to explain that to people who assume financial stress always comes from bad choices.

My two biggest burdens are student loans and court-ordered alimony from a divorce. Together, they eat a massive portion of my take-home pay every month. These are fixed obligations. There’s no negotiating them down, no “just cut back on coffee” solution.

I’ve already done the obvious things:

\- I track every dollar.

\- I’ve cut discretionary spending to near zero.

\- I don’t carry lifestyle debt.

I’m actively trying to resolve a delayed house refinance or sale that would significantly change my situation, but it’s outside my control and likely heading back to court.

What’s wearing me down isn’t just the math. It’s the constant background stress. Every decision feels high-stakes. There’s no margin for error. Any unexpected expense feels catastrophic. I’m functioning, but I’m tired in a way that sleep doesn’t fix.

I’m not looking for a bailout or sympathy. I’m trying to figure out:

\- How people mentally survive long stretches of unavoidable financial pressure

\- Whether there are options I may be missing structurally or legally

\- Or simply reassurance that being this worn down doesn’t mean I’m failing as an adult

If you’ve been in long-term financial strain that wasn’t self-inflicted and made it out the other side, I’d genuinely appreciate hearing how you handled it.

They had a system of democracy where everyone would vote as a council on what to do and how to survive.

—Don't worry, I'm not jealous. Just curious—He smiles mischievously— Although there's something else that makes me curious.

—Really?— He returns the smile

—Well, you're a cop. Control is part of you. But tell me, do you like to keep it even behind closed doors.— He barely raises his eyebrows with that smile he's had all day.

We’re trying to balance it feeling adventurous and exciting while avoiding travelling every other day (I’ve tried to break out whole travel days from the itinerary to be realistic). We’re happy to take flights and pay more to get to places quicker/easier.  
  
We really want to fit a short, easy/mod 2 day hike in. We love nature; mountains, rainforests, beaches etc. We love being adventurous with food and we love seeing stuff off the beaten track (but know we might not have time). We’re going to really try to brush up our Spanish.

Here are our rough plans: 

2 days flight to Cartegena, landing at night   
3 days Cartegena   
1 travel day Cartegena > Minca  
2 days Minca   
2 days Tayrona  
1 travel day Tayrona > Santa Marta > Bucaramanga   
1 day Barichara   
2 days Chicamocha Canyon Hike (incl bus back to Bucaramanga)  
3 days Medellin (incl early flight from Bucaramanga and Guatape day trip)  
1 travel day to Salento/ Coffee Regions  
2 days Salento/ Coffee Regions  
1 travel day to Bogota  
2 days Bogota   
1 day fly home 

  
Have we missed anywhere you recommend? Do we have too many/ too few days in places?

Were you in a relationship with Doctor Marquez?

What brings to Tom's mind the broken voice of Alejandro that night. The tears he was trying to hide. The disappointment in his eyes. With the aroma of coffee in the background.

—Well, yeah...

He is interrupted.

—Don't worry, I'm not jealous. Just curious—He smiles mischievously— Although there's something else that makes me curious.

—Really?— He returns the smile

—Well, you're a cop. Control is part of you. But tell me, do you like to keep it even behind closed doors.— He barely raises his eyebrows with that smile he's had all day.

—Um, well... I'm versatile. I adapt to the other's enjoyment

Although he maintains that flirty smile. He feels a betrayal. One to the heart. That no matter how much he tries to forget. It doesn't understand attempts. It brings to his mind the images of that night. His first kiss. The clothes thrown on the road. The marks from the other day. The feelings on the surface.

—Would you like...

Tom interrupts him

—I, I'm sorry. I can't do this

—Why? Did I do something you didn't like?

—No—He looks at the ground— You're a good guy but...

—But I'm not him—he interrupts him and looks with a look of compassion

—I

—Don't worry, I understand. I know what it's like to be so crazy about someone. It shows in your eyes, Tom.

—I know I should forget him, but I can't.

Lucas puts a hand on Tom's shoulder.

—Yeah, I understand. It's not easy.

—Thanks.

With this, Tom gets up from the table, leaving the money to pay there. For more. As if that would soften the fact of his ""flight"" Anyway, he left the place, saying goodbye to Lucas with a ""bye""

Already in the car, he sat with his feet on the seat. His knees pressed to his face. And the tears wetting them. The knot in his throat intensified. As did the blood coming from his fists. He isolated himself there, in his car. Far from the whole world. Or so he thought.

Welcome to the new age of roleplaying!

Live-generate starting messages (no more fixed, repetitive roleplays), make your characters assertive and realistic, improve the overal LLM writing quality through auto-injected instructions mid-roleplay (OOC on steroids) - even for smaller and ""stupid"" models. No custom extensions in SillyTavern required. Everything works through simple, well-organized and internally labeled lorebooks - one embedded in a character card, two framework ones on your lorebooks list and that's it. It is as easy as it gets. It is the 5th edition, I've been developing this system for last 2 years already - so it is quite polished and from now on, I will release only the incremental upgrades. GM-5 available soon as another project (for now, keep using GM-4: [sphiratrioth666/GM-4\_Game\_Mistress\_Environment\_SillyTavern · Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/sphiratrioth666/GM-4_Game_Mistress_Environment_SillyTavern)).

In addition, you can find a lot of my other projects there. Some Reshade presets for different games, my custom TTRPG system (soon), different kind of goodies.

# What is it?

HuggingFace URL: [sphiratrioth666/SX-5\_Character\_Roleplaying\_System · Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/sphiratrioth666/SX-5_Character_Roleplaying_System)

It is not a SillyTavern extension. SX-5 Characters Environment/Roleplay Environment is just a roleplaying system - activated through lorebooks. It is fully compatible with your existing character and it works out of the box. You may use it to diversify the experience or you can convert your character cards to the SX-5 format to unlock its full potential - which is very fun, powerful and worth your time but optional! Everything is triggered from a normal chat window - so not additional menus that usually come with extensions. Here - everything works in a vanilla SillyTavern and the functionalities actually make any similar extension obsolete.

# What is included?

* Framework Lorebook - to activate the environment in SillyTavern (just import and activate it - it includes all the scenarios, locations, weather & time variables, anything used to generate the starting messages based on pre-written instructions);
* QoL Lorebook - to improve the LLM writing quality and to activate other, useful tricks (it improves narrative styles of the LLM, provides situational instructions you may want to use mid-roleplay (OOC on steroids) and allows general character control);
* Character Lorebook (Male/Female) - to embed in a character card in SillyTavern (this is for creating SX-5 characters)

That's all - just activate two lorebooks and use it or convert/generate characters in SX-5 format when you want to use a full power of the SX-5 roleplaying environment.

# Extra Lorebooks (fully optional)

* Sex Booster - better, more active and assertive characters in NSFW scenes (FEMALE & TS FEMALE CHARACTERS ONLY, AT LEAST FOR NOW);
* TTRPG mode - you are the Game Master/Game Mistress and the LLM becomes the player in a world you control - role reversal of sorts;
* Year Zero Engine & Powered by the Apocalypse TTRPG system lorebooks - to roll dice and use those systems in your roleplays;
* Simple Events Injector/DC Dice Rolling Mechanism (DC: check/RNG: check - to determine if current action worked/failed or to introduce random opportunities/complications)
* Sphiratrioth's Boutique - a fun system to make your characters wear different outfits each roleplay (it is all auto-rolled and adjusted to make sense/match - FEMALE CHARACTER ONLY, AT LEAST FOR NOW)

# Extra Functionality - TRANSSEXUAL CHARACTERS GUIDANCE

LLMs have a natural problem with roleplaying transsexual characters. If character's pronouns are she/her and she's got breasts, for example, LLM always confuses private parts for transsexual characters. It's obvious and logical - since LLMs operate on trained conversations and tokens probability - so they default to male-female sexual interactions. It is super frustrating for those who like roleplaying with transsexual characters. Because you all asked for it - I decided to do something about it - and here it is. Reportedly, I succeeded - there are instructions inserted at low depth, which remind the LLM that a character is transsexual aka it has specific body parts and specific actions are possible with that character sexually. You need to activate a proper entry within the embedded character lorebook to make it work. Read further to understand what it actually means and how it works. It's super simple, I promise.

I tracked why?,"I've been on this sub long enough to notice something weird. Some sites get approved with 6 AI articles in 3 days. Others get rejected 43 times for the same reason.

Genuinely tried to understand why. So I tracked every approval and rejection post I could find.

Here's what I found:

**The contradictions driving everyone crazy:**

One person gets approved with 6 AI articles in 3 days. Another gets rejected for ""low value content"" with 26 hand-written blogs at 1500+ words each.

Someone applied after 1 week and got in. Someone else waited 6 months and still got rejected.

No wonder people keep saying ""AdSense is a lottery.""

But it's not random. There's a pattern.

**What actually separated approvals from rejections:**

|Approved|Rejected repeatedly|
|:-|:-|
|Privacy policy matched actual tracking|Said ""we don't track"" but used GA cookies|
|Kept publishing during review|Stopped and waited|
|Legal pages in footer|Legal pages in main menu|
|One focused niche|Scattered topics|
|Tool site + supporting blog|Tool only, no written content|
|No competing monetization|Patreon, Buy Me Coffee, donation links everywhere|

**Actual stuff nobody talks about...**

1. **The privacy/analytics mismatch**: One guy got rejected 15 times. Asked Gemini to review his code. It found his privacy policy said ""we don't track anything"" but he was using Google Analytics cookies. Fixed it. Approved next try.
2. **YMYL is a silent killer:** Saw someone with a wellness/finance blog get destroyed in comments. Writing about money and health without CPA or medical credentials? Google won't touch you. Doesn't matter how good the content is.
3. **Longer review is actually good**: Fast rejections are automated. If you're waiting 10-17 days, you passed the bot checks. Most approvals I tracked came after long waits.
4. **Premature monetization looks desperate**: One site had ""we use Google AdSense"" in their privacy policy BEFORE getting approved. Patreon links on every page. Buy Me Coffee in sidebar. Screams ""please give me money"" before proving value.
5. **AI content is a coinflip**: I've seen sites approved with pure AI content and sites rejected with hand-written articles. The difference seems to be whether the AI content actually answers questions people are searching for or just fills space.

**The formula that keeps working:**

    Focused niche + supporting content + consistent publishing + no monetization desperation + privacy policy that matches your actual tracking

Notice what's NOT in that formula:

* Specific word count
* Specific number of articles
* Domain age
* Traffic numbers

I've seen approvals with 4 pages and rejections with 700 pages. The pattern isn't volume. It's coherence.

**What I'm still figuring out:**

The YMYL thing is tricky. Some people say they got approved with health/finance content no problem. Others get rejected instantly. Credentials seem to matter but I can't prove it yet.

Same with AI content. The ""it depends"" answer isn't helpful but that's where the data points.

I've been compiling all of this into a checklist to track what actually matters vs what's just noise.

>Still adding to it but here's where it is, for curious cats: [\[adsense approval to profit\]](https://webmatrices.com/checklist/adsense-approval-to-profit)

Tried a bunch of apps, but Keytom (that Dubai-based financial app) caught my eye for its all-in-one setup: named EUR IBAN for SEPA transfers, virtual cards on Google Pay/Apple Pay, and a built-in crypto wallet supporting BTC, ETH, USDC right out of the gate.

Onboarding was a breeze - just 48 hours with basic KYC (passport + utility bill), no endless paperwork even from non-EU spots like LATAM or Asia. They cover businesses from 120+ countries, which is huge for remote teams. Deposited USDC from a recent NFT consulting payout, swapped to EUR at spot rates (no hidden spreads I could spot), topped up the virtual card, and spent instantly on everyday stuff - Amazon orders, Google Ads, even coffee runs. Works seamlessly in 100+ countries, with global payouts to suppliers or freelancers.

**A few real-world perks I noticed:**

* Instant crypto-to-fiat ramps without waiting for blockchain confirmations eating into your day.
* Multi-currency holds (EUR, USD, etc.) so no constant conversions for international clients.
* Business tier lets you issue cards to team members for expense tracking - tried with a VA, super clean.

Not perfect - no yield farming on holdings yet, and crypto selection is focused (BTC/ETH/USDC for now). But for anyone tired of juggling Bybit for crypto, Wise for fiat, and Revolut for cards, Keytom streamlines it into one dashboard. Solid 8/10 for my workflow.

I wasn’t looking for anything in particular but it was out of curiosity that I started talking to this guy. I knew he was much older and I was always expecting him to be the same kind of older man that’s on tinder, just looking for attention from a younger woman. He was always respectful and straightforward. Physically he doesn’t appear to be much older maybe 27-30. He doesn’t have kids nor was he ever married. He’s extremely responsible as well. From what I understand he’s also a homebody and he’s never been the type to do casual things. He’s only had 4 girlfriends in his lifetime and there seems to be no pattern with dating women my age or even a lot younger than him. They’d always been 26-40. 

We started texting over the next couple weeks and eventually started calling each other frequently to the point where we were having real conversations for hours on hours. 

Then we had met up for a coffee and we’ve continued seeing each other like this. Eventually things escalated and our relationship became physically intimate.I feel like we’re compatible in so many ways in terms of values, ideas, and goals. Even physically we’re so compatible and from what i understand that’s really rare to find. I feel like if I was older or maybe if he was younger we would have been perfect for each other. We’ve had this conversation so many times before that I’m also still too young to know for sure this is what I want and that I need to continue with my studies and my career. He’s told me too that he’s ready to have kids and a family and settle down with someone. But he’s been looking for the right person to do it with. But that it’s unfair to expect me to already be thinking about these kinds of things. 

In a way it’s true because I feel like I would need to grow up a lot faster if I commit to something real with him. I know I could be losing my youth and that’s not something I can get back. But I do ultimately want the same things as him. I want to have a family and have the same kind of home life I had growing up. it’s always been important to me but I’m not willing to give up my career for it. Especially as a woman. He understands that and he’s been really helpful in guiding me through my career and education. It’s been a big help for me. 

I think that he would wait for me but then it’s like i’m being put on a clock until I’m ready to have a family and settle down. 

I know that I might be too young to know any better. But it’s so strange because of the level of connection I feel with him. Things feel intense and real. I’d had relationships with older guys before but they’d always felt like power dynamics. ",0,1769396184.0,Advice,3,0.5,False

The correct method is to use the hot water machine the same way as if making tea.

1qn3xdy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1qn3xdy/my_8_year_marriage_fell_apart_within_a_month_but/,My 8 year marriage fell apart within a month but now the story could be the plot of a contemporary romance book,"Hey reddit,

First of all, posting this on a throwaway account because I have some very identifiable information on my main, and I don't want this tracked back to me for now, but I have to get this story out, careful, it's going to be a long one. 

So, my (37 F) now-ex (40 M), let's call him Bill, and I fell in love got married about 9 years ago. We had a modest but beautiful ceremony, and the marriage itself was mostly decent, until the end. We had an open marriage, with stipulations...

\- No one from our immediate social circle  
\- No one from our immediate professional circles (a.k.a. no coworkers)  
\- And before anything happened with anyone, we would have a conversation about the person and we could veto each other's potential partners for any reason

We had kept our finances mainly seperate, but we would ask and send money to each other freely (mainly I would be the one supporting Bill), but we were in debt, both of us had maxxed our credit cards, overdrawn our debit accounts, and had multiple bank loans. Majority of these debts were incurred trying to keep Bill's business afloat. 

I had a steady income from my parents close to 3x Minimum Wage monthly, which I was supplementing with a part time job, but since the debt was out of control, I found a full time job where I was making 2x Minimum Wage, meaning I was pulling close to 5x Minimum Wage monthly, just by myself, meanwhile Bill's business was still struggling. 

The only issue, the new job was quite the commute from our house... which I decided to essentially cut in half by staying at my parent's house 6 days a week and go back home on my days off, once a week. Bill ran his business out of our garage, so he essentially worked from home, and since it was his business, he could essentially give himself a day off when I had a day off. We managed.

He would of course socialize and invite his friends over when I was staying with my parents, and since we had a guest bedroom, sometimes those friends would sleep over. 

One such friend was a girl, let's call her Agatha (25 F), who had worked for Bill before, and even helped out after during busy seasons. Bill treated her like a little sister, and Agatha treated Bill like an older brother. So I wasn't really suspicious at first when she started sleeping over at our house. But as time passed, I grew more and more suspicious.

So I did what a reasonable adult in my position would do: I flat out asked Bill if there was anything going on between him and Agatha. He said there wasn't. I told him, I'll take him on his word, and that I wouldn't try to ""catch him"", either with her or in a lie. Then he asked me what would happen if there was something that had happened, and I told him ""If there was anything going on between you two, it would mean you went against all three of the rules we agreed to, and you would have to stop seeing her immediately, and we would need to go couples therapy."" Bill then asked ""What would happen if I didn't want to stop seeing her?"" and I said ""Then we would be getting a divorce"". I didn't see the red flags in him asking all these hypotheticals at the time, so as soon as we wrapped up the conversation I went to sleep because I was dead tired from the night shift. 

I woke up to Bill sitting at the foot of the bed, crying. As soon as I woke up he said that it was ""confession time"" and told me everything. That Bill and Agatha had been having an affair in my home, in my bed for a month now... that he didn't want to stop seeing her, because she made him feel good about himself. I reiterated that if he didn't want to stop seeing her, then we would need to get a divorce, so he asked if he could think about it and I said, sure, take your time. 

We then had a regular evening, had dinner, watched a movie, and Bill went to bed. The next morning as we were having our morning coffee he told me that he had made up his mind, that I was his life-partner, and that he was all in. We had a nice morning, then I went to bed, to sleep before my next night shift. 

When I woke up Bill wasn't home, so I called him, he said he was at his brother's having a chat with his brother and their father, and to not wait for him, as he would be coming home late, so when I had to leave for work, I did. At work I gave him another call and asked him how it went with his brother and father, and he told me that they talked about the Agatha situation, and that he had decided he wanted a divorce. 

I'm not exactly proud of my initial reaction, I basically laid into him for doing this to me while I was at work, over the phone, and not face to face. After a bit I calmed down, and told him that he essentially changed his mind three times over the course of a little over 24 hours, first he needed more time to decide, then he was all in, and then he wanted a divorce. I told him there is no possible way for any decision he makes now to be a healthy one, as he was clearly in some sort of crisis, that I wanted him to make an appointment with a therapist first thing in the morning for individual therapy and I wanted to start couples therapy very soon after that. He said that he had made up his mind, there was no changing it, and that he was afraid that he would be giving me hope if he agreed to it. I told him that if I get my hopes up, it would be on me and not him, and in order to make sure this is the right path forward he needed individual therapy and we needed couples therapy. 

He put off getting an appointment for individual therapy for about two weeks, which gave me more than enough time to re-evaluate our marriage and get a sense of how ""I"" actually felt about getting a divorce. And for me it all changed when as a thought exercise I imagined what life as a divorcee would be like for me. I realized I would have more peace of mind by myself as a single woman than I ever did, being married to him. That essentially I was trying to convince him that I was worthy of being loved, and that he was avoiding me like the plague at every turn for about the past 5 years or so. 

So, after he had his appointment with his therapist and she confirmed what I had been saying, that he essentially had a crisis, essentially a nervous breakdown of sorts, I told him that I had also made up my mind, and that I also wanted a divorce. 

So we did. In a matter of weeks. In less than a month after he told me that he had been cheating on me, I packed all my stuff in the house, moved it piece-meal, we filed and then we were divorced. 

On the advice of a family friend who is a divorce attorney, in order to make the process as short as possible, we had a no-fault-divorce, where neither of us asked the other for anything... and it meant all the debt I went into, in order to help his business, I was not going to get compensated for. I essentially decided that being free of Bill would be a better outcome than a lengthy divorce proceeding where I tried to squeeze him for the money he owed me, money he clearly does not have. 

I'm skipping over a lot details and conversations over this period, where he insisted that the reason we were getting divorced was not the fact that he cheated on me, or the one where I told him that he would come to regret this decision, not anytime soon, but in about 5 years time, to which he laughed. 

So I embraced my new life as a divorcee. I told my friends that I wanted nothing to do with dating for a while, and that I would make a spectacular comeback as a cougar after I turned 40. 

That is until Adam found out I was divorced. 

Adam, was an old situationship of mine from about roughly 13 years ago, when I was living in a different city. At the time, neither he nor I was interested in having a serious relationship, but we both recognized something special in each other, so we agreed to a friends-with-benefits situation, a non-monogamous one, which ended because I decided to move to the city I live in now. So we parted as friends, and kept in touch over the years, which had whittled down to sending each other a funny meme and asking how life was once every 6 months or so, especially after I got married. 

When Adam found out I was divorced, he asked if he could video call me, almost immediately. And once the pleasantries were out of the way, he started the main conversation by essentially apologizing for everything he thought was his fault with our story 13 years ago... including letting me go. 

He told me things that I had no idea of, like how his best friend was still using me as an ace up his sleeve to shut Adam up, whenever it looked like Adam was winning the debate... or that he gave up entirely on dating around when he realized he was looking for me in every woman; one because she was tan like me, one because she was tall like me, one because she had eyes similar to mine...

... and that even after all this time, that he was convinced I was his soulmate... the one that got away... and that he was still very much in love with me...

... and I told him the feeling was mutual, because it was... when Bill and I had a fight, and he would say something extremely rude or mean to me, the first thought that would float in my head would be ""Adam would have never said something like that to me, not even in a fight""... 

So we decided to give long distance a go... that was almost 4 months ago now. Everyday has been better than the last, even long distance, which we plan to end soon. We plan on getting married before the end of the year, and I'll be moving where he's living right now. 

I don't want to give too many details about Adam and I, incase Bill somehow finds this and recognizes the story. 

But I have been making ahead on the debt, I've paid off close to half of it, and should be debt-free by the beginning of summer. Adam even offered to pay it off, but I told him this was something I had to do myself, partly as my penance for falling for Bill's lies and manipulation, but mainly to prove to myself that unlike what Bill had been saying, I actually can budget, and budget well. 

There are more details in there that I could sprinkle in, but this has already gone long enough and I'm not exactly sure how to end it other than to give a TLDR:

\- was married,   
\- got cheated on,   
\- got divorced,   
\- got back together with another ex,   
\- still healing from the divorce but I am happier with my current partner than I have ever been with my ex husband.

I currently drink a glass of green tea in the morning which has about 50mg of caffeine. I did some research and read green tea can block the absorption of folate, however in order for that to really happen it needs to be closer to 3 glasses a day. Yay for me! 

My question is: in the evenings I’ve been drinking honey ginger tea with zinc from Bigelow. Is this okay???? It dawned on me today maybe I shouldn’t be drinking tea with added zinc but can’t find much about it online.

The game gave me dopamine rushes for 10 hours straight. So when I finally got off, my brain craved more. Hours go by.

Btw i am not good at speaking/talking and english is not my native language.","I will put fake names just in case she will see this post(0.0001%chance) but we can never be sure. I have depression maybe melancholy too and possibly autism as an autism psychologist with 20 years of expertise in autism&adhd has told me. Maybe this is why what i am going to ask will be maybe easily solved by neurotypically developed people. A coworker had asked me out through my other coworker to go out for a coffee. I hesitated and pretended to not care enough. I think i had told her that i don't believe her or that i don't want to go out. I was hesitant. I texted her the same or the next day and we would go out for a coffee but after some hours before going out i told her that i am anxious going out and that if i had my own home i would have invited her to come and i told her maybe i should go to her home since going out made me anxious. She accepted by telling me that i could go to her house since her boyfriend was at work those hours. maybe it was true maybe it was lie but they broke up some 1-2 months after that so the relationahip was not going great i guess thoat time. I told her that since she has a bf that we should not go out. She responded by saying that she understands. Unfortunately i texted her again some hours llater after that and 3 more times in the span of 3 months approximately. At the work she never seemed and never seems to be bothered by how i interacted with her through the mesaages. Contrary she has begun calling me Danny instead of daniel sometimes, though it is not my real name but she calls me like when lovers call eatch other. I only talk to her when she tells me hi or how i am doing. Maybe she is just a kind human but in my mind she wants me to begin making conversations. The problem is that i don't feel starting conversations. I gather dishes do laundry in the mcdonalds type restaurant watch the toilets if they are clean etc. so i don't have time to talk to her and i also get tired and angry because of my work so there is no way for me to relax and talk to her. She sees that i am angry and tired, she even asked me if someone hurt me. The messages that i had texted her though, those 3, they were only read and never answered so am i maybe thinking delusionally?  ",2,1769395682.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

She cancels plans most of the time, which I find annoying. I have talked with her about it but there is something wrong in her thinking, like she can only think about herself and how she feels. She will say things like I wasn’t feeling good all week but then cancel last minute.. my thought is…well why didn’t you cancel earlier? 

Here is another example, She has a job and has used up her 45 sick days in only 4 months so she probably only went about 2x a week to work. She has noticed ladies at work being standoffish towards her and not talking with her. She seemed genuinely confused and hurt and asked me about this, like why are the doing that to me? So I asked her well when you are gone, do they have to do your work for you? And she said yes. And I said well maybe they are frustrated that they have more work to do whenever you call in. Then she got defensive and hurt that I said that, and said well I’m sick like they should feel bad for me. But… quite often she would meet me up in the evening for a coffee and tell me that she didn’t go to work that day. So she isn’t THAT sick I don’t think… 

I feel like maybe she is letting her emotions dictate everything… if she doesn’t feel like going, then she won’t…and is completely unaware of the affect this has on other people. 

I’m not sure how much longer I can keep being her friend with all the cancelling because it feels like she is just inconsiderate. She has lost a few friends already… her best friend just ghosted her one day and hasn’t talked to her in years. I feel like I want to help her see what she is doing but am not sure how to approach it.

1qn3rrx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cruise/comments/1qn3rrx/firsttime_cruiser_trip_report_msc_grandiosa_jan26/,First-time Cruiser - Trip Report - MSC Grandiosa Jan/26  Solo - Inside Cabin,"As a first time cruiser I used this subreddit a lot to prepare for the trip. I was apprehensive over many things, especially after reading so many MSC specific complaints, and so I feel like contributing my experience for those of you who are thinking of doing something similar. Keep in mind that being a first time cruiser means I have nothing to compare it to, but to land based travel. 

Embarkation: I got assigned a 3pm boarding slot, with all-aboard being at 5. All the shuttle companies from Orlando to Port Canaveral have the last ones leave before 12 which concerned me enough to call MSC, but they told me I can show up earlier without a problem. Indeed, I took the last shuttle (cruise control) for the day and arrived at 12:30ish to what seemed like a loooong line. The line moved fairly fast, up the escalator, and through security to enter the terminal. Once in the terminal there was another line snaking through chairs to get to the actual check-in. I was on the ship in less than an hour total! I didn't expect that when entering the line outside. The lines just kept on moving. 

The ship itself is gorgeous, just like everyone says. I had an inside cabin which felt spacious, and was quite inside (aside from the occasional loud hallway passersbys late at night -smh) and was nice and dark (after putting a towel by the door). Perfect for a good night's sleep. The seas were calm or the ships stabilizers work really well, because I hardly felt the movement and the calm rocking at night makes the sleep so much better. 

Food: seems to be the greatest complaint online. Keep in mind that this is my first cruise so I don't know how other lines are, but the buffet choices alone would've kept me well fed without complaints. There are some tricks I had to learn quickly, such as where the hot milk is for the morning coffee (most drink stations did not have it, only one of them closer to the aft). Same with finding honey for tea, which was only available as a salad dressing. They had different foods and desserts show up on different days so eying a chocolate eclair and thinking I'll have it tomorrow was a mistake. But there is soooo much variety and so many different stations (that do repeat on either side) that it's hard not to find something. 

I don't drink a lot of alcohol, and I mostly drink coffee, tea and water so I didn't get any of the packages. I forgot to bring my large tumbler and the buffet mugs don't have covers. Instead I asked the bartenders for a couple of cups with lids and used them to fill and refill at the buffet stations. While in Puerto Plata I wandered out of the tourist zone and found what they call a 'chino' or what we'd call a 99cent store and got me a tumbler for $6 which worked perfectly for the duration of the trip. 

MDR: I got a very early 5pm seating at a large table with other solo travelers. I found the group to be interesting and fun (but that might just be luck) They have a fixed menu of sorts with an addition of daily food choices that were sometimes thematic. Waiters were absolutely fantastic, they learned by day 2-3 what drinks people like and brought them right away. If one didn't end up liking a food choice they gladly changed it for something else. You can get multiple appetizers and desserts while an additional entree costs $5. 

One complaint I had is that the food more often than not came out colder than I wanted. That was true for every dish, every night... I wasn't the only one to notice this. 

On this ship they had a tex-mex breakfast menu at the taco joint on deck 6. It was nice to have something different. On sea days they serve an elaborate brunch until 1pm at a MDR (not necessarily the one assigned for dinner -only dinner is assigned the rest is come as you please). 

Entertainment: there's always something going on somewhere. The daily schedule on the app has them all (although some are obvious sales pitches). Nightly shows were booked by the time I got to think about them, however, I always made it to any of the shows just by showing up 5 min before and waiting in the non-reserved line. The ship was completely sold out and still, I was lucky enough to find a seat at every show. The Michael Jackson tribute had people line up an hour before, and so I thought I won't make it but even then I found a seat (when getting in late go straight to the front of the theater to the very right or very left side and there should be some seats). If you can book your shows right away you'll have better seat choices though, so I do recommend it. 

I have also joined a fb group for this sailing that had additional passenger driven activities such as a casino slot-pull and a magician who loves entertaining as a hobby. There were a few gift exchanges, rubber duck activities -the last one being a unique aspect of 'cruise culture' I might enjoy with young family members. 

If you're worried about cruising solo, don't. People are on vacation, which makes most of them nice. They had solo meetups daily at the French bistro on deck 6 where I met many other solos not at the same dinner table. People quickly formed groups to hang out at ports or do sport and funplex activities on the ship. One can always find other people to go to the shows with or just to grab a late night pizza. There's a chat feature on the app for those who don't have wifi so connecting to people and making plans isn't hard. 

The staff was fantastic. All of them. I haven't met a single grumpy employee, and that even goes for the 'European' ones... I know it's an oft complaint but I haven't seen it (okay, maybe the Italian crew doesn't smile that much, but they don't shrug everything off like they do at home -they're genuinely helpful just like everyone else on the ship). 

Embarking and disembarking at ports was quick and easy. I never went right away when they docked or came back last minute so there was practically no wait time. There was no tender port so I don't know about that. Being really avert to herding and queuing up I was concerned about it but I was able to avoid it almost entirely on this trip (apart from the 50min it took to check-in). Disembarkation too I left the room at 8am, hung out with my new friends in the assigned lounge and left at 9:45. There were no lines at all, not to get off, not to get the luggage and not at the customs and border check, which uses facial recognition. This only works if you have a flight later than 1-2 pm or on another day, obviously so plan accordingly. 

I'm already looking for the next cruise and will absolutely go with MSC. I would be looking for a balcony room as I love to read me a book sometimes and while during the day I always found a spot up in the adult-only lounge on deck 16, sometimes I just wanted to be alone reading and looking at the sea. (the lounge though, what a stunning place that is, I forgot the name but it's just perfect, it overlooks the pool and to to the sides you look out the huge windows to see the endless ocean and the occasional ship or cruise line).

I only use the single basket. I've read a few suggestions here to grind coarser than I normally would for pourover. But that consistently gives me weak brews. I took a peek inside the brew chamber mid-brew and noticed the water never fully drains between pours. I suspect this is preventing the water from the shower head from agitating the bed enough? but I don't know for sure - maybe its not an issue.

I have tried a variety of brew recipes including the famed Sweet 1.1 [https://brew.link/p/yO3e](https://brew.link/p/yO3e)

**Can anyone here please share your grind size in reference to the Kruver brewler scale? or in microns?**

I notice if I grind very fine (half the grind size as V60) I get much better extraction with very sweet brews, but there is little clarity/flavour separation in the tasting notes. For example ZP6 grind size is at 2.5 (calibrated to burr touch at 0). But if I grind at my usual 4.5-5 on my zp6 for pourover I get extremely weak watery tasting brews.

1qn3hs7,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1qn3hs7/lost_momentos_part_1_edited_reupload/,Lost Momentos (Part 1 Edited Reupload),"# Part 1:

The dulcet tones of southern rock roused me from sleep as I rubbed the night’s weariness from my eyes. Four a.m. had come again, way too soon for comfort. Knowing I couldn’t afford yet another sick day, I threw on my flannel and jeans, forced down a couple quick bowls of green heaven, and headed out to my baby.

She was only a couple years old—the best off-road pickup truck I was still paying a solid chunk of my paycheck toward—but she was my pride and joy nonetheless.

I sped down the interstate in the chilly fall dark, texting my boss that I’d be a wee bit late for the fourth time that week. Having the owner be your dad does wonders—as long as you don’t fuck it up—but I digress. I peeled into the lot of the small five-company complex, slid into a parking spot, and started gathering my necessities for the day.

Full water? Check.  
 Testicles, spectacles, wallet and watch? Check.  
 Half-full portable battery? …Check, I guess.

Passing through the glass doors, I was halted almost immediately by my Pa and the other two employees, already seated with tablets open to the day’s schedule. I caught a mild bit of shit as I took my seat and pulled up the app myself. Trapping duty again. Not that I was complaining.

Eight hours of driving around with podcasts and critters for company made for an easy weekday—beats the hell out of digging trenches or climbing rooftops. Just as I started to filter out at the tail end of the herd like usual, a new inspection popped up. A woman named Lois Carlton, way out in the middle of the valley.

My Pa spun his monitor around and walked me through the satellite view. The property sprawled across hectares, with a small fenced section enclosing a mansion that looked dropped out of place against the surrounding rock and scrub. Definitely an affluent customer. Hopefully a large commission.

He tacked it onto the back of my list and reminded me to sell her hard on preventative measures—coyotes were her primary concern. I assured him I was ready to spiel, loaded traps of various sizes into the truck, and set out for what I assumed would be an uneventful Tuesday.

It’s the monotony that gets to you, driving around day in and day out. Customers blur together job by job until you’re left wondering where the day went while gearing up for the next one. That’s just how most labor is. Sales, service, supervision—it all hits a cognitive ceiling after a while.

Routine is what dulls memory. When every job runs off the same pre-generated responses, there’s nothing for the brain to grab onto. Either I meet the homeowner, ask where the animals are getting in and what they’re tearing up, or—more often than not—the details are already submitted online and I let myself into the backyard, set traps, and take pictures.

That’s why the jobs that break routine stick so hard.

The eleven-foot ball python in a dryer vent.  
 The fully tattooed geriatric woman who chased me out of her house after forgetting she hired us.

Stories only become infodumps if they earn it. So when I tell you *this* job stood out, I mean it.

The “she” in question was an older woman named Lois Carlton—at least, that’s how she introduced herself. I’d been warned the property was remote and expansive, but I still wasn’t prepared for what greeted me when I pulled up.

The house was a multi-layer monstrosity. Four-car garage, minimum. Landscapers had clearly been through recently; succulents and hedges were trimmed and vibrant despite the surrounding rock and bramble that climbed the valley walls on all sides. A water feature crowned the center of the circular drive, its surface catching the early light like polished glass.

An oasis, carved straight into hostile terrain.

As impressive as it was, what really caught me off guard was seeing someone already waiting at the entryway.

I took note of the bright white iron-and-vinyl fencing around the property and mentally refreshed my per-foot pricing, already prepping my pitch for perimeter treatments. But the moment I stepped out of the truck, my train of thought derailed.

The first thing I noticed was the smell—fresh, floral, almost overpoweringly clean. Then a sharp pain lanced through my temple, sudden enough to make me pause. Beneath it all, threading through the ambient noise, was a steady drone.

Not quite mechanical.  
Not quite natural.

It reminded me of a distant machine, or the combined chorus of thousands of cicadas—but it was too uniform, too far away to pinpoint a source. No matter how I tilted my head, I couldn’t place it.

I pulled on my gloves and approached who I assumed was the head of the household. And when I finally looked up at her, every thought of upsells, pricing, and mild professional annoyance vanished.

She stood a good half a head shorter than me. Her short, pale-brown hair was pulled tight into a bun perched neatly at the crown of her head. Freckles traced down her pale neck before disappearing beneath a dark green tank top—one that did a poor job of hiding the pronounced bump she held her forearms over, as if sheer pressure might somehow conceal it.

When my gaze finally returned to her face, I caught the reason she’d been watching me so closely. Her stare was sharp and unwavering, the muddied amber of her eyes catching the light in a way that felt almost deliberate. I hesitated, suddenly aware of my shoulder-length mess of dark brown hair and hoping I’d brushed it *enough* this morning.

I extended a gloved hand awkwardly, turning my hearing aids up a notch as I introduced myself.  
 “Good afternoon there, ma’am. Name’s Brady. I hear you got a problem we might be able to help with?”

I hefted my tablet in my other hand, my body lagging a half-second behind my brain. The delay earned a slight crack in her stoic façade—a quick, almost amused grin—before her expression settled back into something unreadable.

The interaction barely had time to begin before she turned on her heel and headed for the doorway, wordlessly leading me inside.

The house opened up into marble-vaulted ceilings and dramatic light fixtures that seemed built more for form than function. Hand-wrought iron and steel twisted into ornate shapes overhead, casting soft, uneven shadows across the walls. Mounted above doorways and mantels was a veritable menagerie of trophy heads—elk and bighorn sheep you’d expect from someone with money for tags and guides, but also smaller game: squirrels, raccoons, things most folks wouldn’t bother preserving.

Each mount bore a small placard. Species. Weight. Date of kill.  
 Neat. Clinical.

While Mrs. Carlton gathered her kids’ toys away from the panoramic glass doors leading to the backyard, I busied myself cataloging the décor like a museum docent with a clipboard. Above the fireplace hung a family crest—blue, green, and silver woven into intricate, vaguely Celtic patterns. It made a striking backdrop for the crossed display beneath it: a wood-stock shotgun and an engraved cavalry sword, draped over a folded flag.

I skirted the edges of a shaggy pale-blue rug, careful not to track dirt onto the spotless fabric. Framed certificates and achievements lined the cream-colored walls. Some bore the name *Lois Atwell*—her maiden name, I assumed. Others belonged to Jeremy *Carlton*.

Hers were academic. A doctorate in internal medicine. Commendations. Honors.  
His medals were badges. Unit insignias. Physical proof of multiple deployments to the Middle East.

Photographs filled the gaps between frames. An affluent family smiled back at me from frozen moments in time. The man—Jeremy, presumably—was tall, broad-shouldered, with tangled blond hair and fair skin. He looked every bit the part of a man’s man, judging by the way he held himself in the pictures.

Trying to make small talk, I gestured toward a photo of him in full dress uniform, cradling what looked like their toddler in one arm and a small puppy in the other.

“What branch of the military is your husband in?”

I didn’t think twice about the question. My attention was still on the photos as I walked—until I nearly collided with her.

She’d stopped dead in front of me, a stuffed bear clutched in one hand. Her face twisted into confusion, then something sharper. Almost anger. It lingered just long enough to make my stomach tighten before her brows relaxed and a calm smile took its place, as though the moment had never happened.

“I’m not sure what you mean,” she said evenly. “I don’t have a husband that I’m aware of. Pests ruining my backyard and flowerbeds, on the other hand…”

She let the sentence trail off and gestured toward the sliding door. I followed, stepping carefully through the now toy-free threshold.

Okay. Maybe not such a happy family after all.  
 But that wasn’t my circus, and those weren’t my monkeys.

I passed the toddler quietly stacking Nerf guns into a bin, deliberately avoiding the photos that seemed to watch us as we left the safety of the pristine interior.

Outside, the yard stretched wider than my apartment and parking lot combined. I slowed despite myself, taking in the sheer scale of it all. We walked beneath archways thick with vining flowers—Wandering Dude, tinged with faint purple—while stone centerpieces rose around us in careful symmetry.

Deep green topiaries twisted and entwined with the sculptures, foliage and masonry married so seamlessly it was hard to tell where one ended and the other began. Each figure wore an expression frozen in misfortune or mischief, posed mid-action with weapons grown straight from living branches: a harp, an axe, a spear.

Despite their differences, every sculpture shared the same unsettling feature.

Slack-jawed mouths, stretched impossibly wide—unhinged, inhuman—caught forever between a scream and a laugh.

Mrs. Carlton led me briskly along the fence line, passing multiple hand-built play structures and an empty—though sizable—livestock pen beside a chicken coop. The hens inside clucked and chattered, stirred into excitement by our presence and the faint promise of food or freedom.

We continued along a well-worn dirt path at the edge of the property, walking until the house shrank to the size of my thumb in the distance. Only then did her pace finally slow.

We stopped at what I could only assume had once been a tractor crash site.

The fence had been torn apart—not bent or cracked, but *ripped*. Made of solid, inch-thick hollow plastic, the panels were shredded ten feet across in multiple directions. White, jagged edges curled outward like snapped bone, framing a hole wide enough for three grown men to walk through side by side. Whatever had hit it hadn’t forced its way in—it had *gone through*.

She glanced at the damage, then at me, her voice tight with something close to nerves.

“What do you think could have caused this? I know we’ve seen coyotes, but… I don’t know. I don’t know why they’d break the fence when they could’ve just gone through the woods. It couldn’t have been a bear or something, could it?”

I tilted my head back to look at her, having crouched to inspect the debris. I picked up a shard of plastic and turned it in the last of the late-day sun, squinting. The surface was slick—coated in a drying, translucent substance that clung like snot, both in color and texture.

I lifted my sunglasses and chose my words carefully. No sense alarming a high-paying customer.

“We don’t get many bears around here,” I said. “Maybe up in the mountains an hour out, but seeing one down here would be a first. Especially given the way this fence was damaged. Do you have any pets you let out regularly? Or security cameras that might’ve caught something?”

She shook her head quickly, then hesitated—corrected herself with a small nod.

“We have an older pit mix with a digging habit, and a doorbell camera in the back to watch her and the kids’ bikes. But we always supervise her when she’s out. We’ve had to lately—especially at night—with all the animals going after the hens.”

I stepped through the breach to the wilderness side of the fence. Fresh mud stretched away from the opening in uneven streaks, pressed deep into the soil. I crouched again, using another piece of shattered plastic to part the grass—

—and felt my blood go cold.

I let the fragment drop and steadied my breathing before standing again.

“Have you lost any of your flock so far?”

I stepped back into the yard, only then fully registering that every section of plastic had been bent *outward*, peeled away from its supports. The metal posts still stood—slightly crooked now—wrenched loose from their concrete anchors.

“A couple here and there,” she said. “Mostly the stubborn ones that won’t go back in at night. But last week alone we lost almost half a dozen. All we ever find are feathers and some dried blood. No remains. No carcasses. And it’s never the ones inside the coop.”

She paused, then added, “We set up a doorbell camera facing it after too many were getting out during the night. The little escape artists kept wandering into the woods.”

As she led me back toward the house, I snapped a few photos for the invoice and followed close behind. We stopped near a row of planter beds lining the back wall—what remained of them, anyway.

The red brick retaining wall was cracked in several places, mortar crumbling onto the walkway. Something heavy had pressed down through the flowerbeds, flattening them in multiple directions. Deep grooves cut through the soil, veins of displaced earth leading away from the damage. Mud splattered the foundation and vent screens above.

Behind one of the mangled shrubs, I noticed a crawlspace entrance—edges damaged, but the opening still intact.

I tried not to think about what might have fit inside.

Keeping my voice professional, I ran through the rest of my script. Larger coyote traps for a couple weeks. Two leghold traps she’d already purchased, baited with our supplies.

Legholds were illegal in our state without very specific permits—but money talks, and Mrs. Carlton spoke fluently.

After assuring me her dog and child wouldn’t be anywhere near them, I suggested placing one trap near the crawlspace entrance and the other at the breach in the fence.

Taking me up on the offer, Mrs. Carlton headed back inside to keep an eye on her toddler, who was already tugging at her leg for attention. I lugged my equipment from the truck, eager to finish up and get the hell out of there.

I set one trap near the gaping breach in the fence and another by the chicken coop entrance. Afterward, I walked her through where they were placed and what to do if either tripped—how to keep kids and pets clear, how to call us for removal or reset. Officially, it was for safety.

Unofficially, I wanted at least one of them in view of the doorbell camera.

Before I left, I pocketed one of the plastic shards coated in that drying residue. I figured one of my coworkers might recognize it. I didn’t like the idea of being the only one who’d seen it.

She thanked me distractedly as I handed over contact information. I offered a quick farewell and all but sprinted back to my truck.

I slammed the door, twisted the key, and cranked the heater to full blast. The engine roared to life as I ignored the reminder to schedule a follow-up visit and nearly squealed my way out of her driveway. At the time, I told myself I’d done my job. Made the sale. Maybe even secured a higher-paying client down the line.

In hindsight, I should’ve told her to get the hell out of Dodge.

Even then, though, part of me tried to rationalize what I’d seen. Except I couldn’t shake the fact that the impressions in the mud outside the fence weren’t anything I recognized.

They weren’t paw prints.

They were deep-set, uneven impressions—unmistakably humanoid.

\*\*\*

I collapsed onto the twin mattress in my small one-bedroom apartment, cracked open an alcoholic beverage, and took a long swig before throwing on some low-volume YouTube documentaries for background noise. I slipped my hearing aids out and let the world fade as sleep took me.

I don’t usually dream. When I sleep, it’s more like a hard cut—one moment gone, the next already waking up. No transition. No imagery. Just time skipped forward.

So when I *do* dream, I remember them vividly.

That night, I found myself back on one of the hunting trips my Pa used to take me on at Grandpa’s land in Florida. The property sat deep in the peninsula—murky, humid, and untouched—trails winding through trees older than imagination, underbrush hiding life too abundant to count.

Visits were rare, but every one had been treasured. Grandpa passed late last year, and after a mess of legal proceedings, the land had been surrendered to the state. Standing again in the hand-carved doorway of his cabin felt like drawing a clean breath for the first time in years.

I ran my hands over the initials and scribbles etched into the wood. The grooves felt just as they always had—warm. Alive. Almost pulsing beneath my fingertips.

That house had been a caretaker. It watched my first cries echo through the living room and my final wave goodbye from the porch. Losing it felt like losing a piece of myself alongside him. The memories were bittersweet now—more melancholic than comforting.

Our last visit hadn’t been pleasant.

It started well enough, the three of us prepping shells and checking trail cams from the night before. It didn’t take long for things to sour. The yelling came fast and loud. I didn’t understand the details at the time, but now I know it was about the birth of my little brother.

Twelve-year-old me did the only thing I could think to do—I stepped between them.

That’s how accidents happen. Not from malice. From misplaced feet. Bad timing. Kind intentions in the wrong moment.

When the rifle went off beside my head, all I heard was a hum.

A steady, relentless hum.

I pressed my pudgy fingers to the sides of my head and screamed when they came away slick with blood.

I never fully recovered. My family struggled with sign language at first, but we learned together. It worked well enough—until the implants came. Now I could hear just fine. Better than most, even. I could tune people out without them noticing, my long hair hiding the devices I once felt ashamed of.

We never blamed Grandpa. He was the first to rush me to his old military medic friend nearby—probably the reason I didn’t lose my hearing completely.

So as I walked those familiar halls in the dream, I let the memories wash over me. Open doors spilled burnt-orange sunlight across polished wood, illuminating every grain and groove as I passed. Each step felt heavy with meaning.

At the end of the hall, I stopped at Grandpa’s bedroom.

My hands were small again—soft, clumsy, eager.

I reached for the doorknob, desperate to see his face just one more time.

My wrinkled, sausage-like fingers closed around the cold metal handle—

My last-minute alarm screamed in my ear. Once it had done its job, I tossed it on the charger and started getting ready—something’s better than nothing. Same approach to breakfast: a quick protein shake from the fridge, then a stop at the corner store for my daily processed sugar and caffeine overdose to pack away for lunch.

When I pulled in that morning, the others were already gone. Boss man stood alone out front waiting for me. Walking up, sipping liquid diabetes, he told me I’d be riding along with him for the day.

Mrs. Carlton had called early. She wanted the house sealed up and the fence repaired, all in one go if possible. We’d need to take measurements for the seal-up and bring sample materials for her to look over once the fence was handled.

I thought about mentioning the strange substance from the day before, but figured he’d see it for himself soon enough.

So I climbed into the passenger seat, and we headed back to that perplexing property. I told myself my hesitation was just nerves.

Pulling into the laneway, I watched the same astonishment cross my father’s face that I’d felt the day prior—muted now by my own familiarity. Morning light filtered through the dense canopy ringing the property. The family dog lounged atop the fountain wall, ears perked as we rolled cautiously into her domain.

Already armed with dog treats—standard operating procedure—I distracted her with belly rubs while Pa went to the door. When Mrs. Carlton didn’t answer on the third ring-and-knock combo, we exchanged a look.

Something was off.

Still, we had work to do. Given our legal right to access our traps at any reasonable hour, we let ourselves in through the unlocked side gate.

The backyard was in as much disarray as before. Worse, actually. The whirring sound threaded through the air again, constant enough to make my jaw tense.

I turned to ask Pa what he wanted to tackle first, but he was already striding toward the gap in the fence.

The debris had changed.

The shattered plastic was no longer just coated—it had been *encased*. The viscous residue had hardened into something clear and rigid, like glass or diamond. It anchored the fragments to the grass and soil so firmly that when Pa tried to chip it off his boot, it wouldn’t budge. Not with a shovel. Not with a pocketknife.

We didn’t discuss it.

We stripped the damaged fencing between the posts and replaced it with identical decorative panels. By the time I was pouring the last bucket of concrete, Pa was checking and rebaiting the trap near the fence line.

That’s when the scream cut through the yard.

High. Feminine. Piercing enough to freeze my hands mid-motion.

We spun toward the house. Mrs. Carlton stood at the back door, her child on her hip, one arm shielding his eyes as if she could block out whatever horror she was seeing.

We rushed over.

The coyote trap near the coop had been knocked sideways, dented deep in several places. Drag marks scarred the dirt, leading back toward the house.

But it was the leghold trap by the crawlspace that stole the air from my lungs.

Clenched in the rubber jaws was a human foot.

Emaciated. Cold. Severed nearly clean at the joint, the rest torn free in ragged strands of tendon and ligament.

While Pa worked quickly—gloved hands steady, knife flashing as delicately as the situation allowed—I guided Mrs. Carlton and her child inside. Any thoughts of sales or professionalism evaporated. I sat her on the couch, handed her the coffee she’d been making, and let her soothe her son with a tablet as he bounced nervously on her lap.

That’s when I remembered the camera.

She pointed me to the display and controller on the kitchen counter, and I pulled up the footage.

I started from the moment I’d left the property the day before.

Minutes blurred into hours as I fast-forwarded—nothing but the dog wandering in and out of frame. Then, suddenly, motion.

The camera quality was disturbingly clear. When the wooden crawlspace entrance exploded outward, I saw everything.

A figure clawed its way out from beneath the house.

The man was gaunt. Filthy. Clothes hanging off him in tatters. But the unkempt blond hair caught my eye—and through the grime, recognition hit like a punch to the chest.

This was the husband.

This was Mr. Carlton.

Before I could fully process it, he took one unsteady step away from the house.

Then a second.

**SNAP.**

The leghold trap clamped shut around his ankle.

He screamed and pulled, feral and desperate. Watching him thrash, I found myself wishing—absurdly—that I hadn’t anchored the trap so well.

He glanced back toward the house, eyes wide with terror, then reached into the remains of his clothing and produced a glinting object. A blade.

He bent down and began sawing at his own leg.

I looked away when the blood came—but forced myself back. I needed to know what had happened. Needed to understand what I’d helped set into motion.

What happened next wasn’t what I expected.

As he hacked through bone and tendon, his attention snapped away from the house. His face twisted into something beyond panic—pure, animal terror.

A thin tendril slid through the crushed foliage toward him.

At first I thought it was a snake.

It wasn’t.

It kept coming, growing thicker with every exposed inch—until it was as wide as my thigh. It wrapped around him with horrifying patience, yanking the knife from his hand as it climbed his body.

There was no struggle.

The tendril tightened, lifted him free of the trap, and met the anchored metal with barely a pause. The remaining tendons tore apart under impossible strength.

And then he was gone—dragged screaming beneath earth and stone once more.

I stood there, flabbergasted, trying to steady my breathing. I rewound the recording, then slowly turned toward the frightened remnants of the family behind me.

Guiding Lois over to the monitor, I replayed the footage from the moment the covering was thrown clear across the yard. Her expression shifted from confusion to shock—then recognition struck.

She finally saw the man she’d pledged her life to.

Her face twisted in agony as she wailed, clutching her head, her child crying in tandem as if on cue. I did everything I could to calm them, to return her to the couch, but nothing helped. The grief poured out unchecked.

Then I heard it again.

The same droning noise—only louder now.

The effect was immediate.

The others in the room *reset*. Lois’s tears vanished as if wiped away by an unseen hand. Her sobbing cut off mid-breath. She smiled—wide, placid, wrong.

I didn’t have time to process it.

My name was being called from the backyard.

“Hey bud—could you grab me the big flashlight? Can’t see a damn thing with this phone.”

My blood ran cold.

I sprinted to the truck, grabbed the light, and tore back toward the yard. My father’s shoes were sticking out from beneath the house as he crawled deeper inside, already committed.

Cresting over the broken wood frame, careful not to snag myself on the jagged splinters, I was hit by a wall of stench.

The air was damp, heavy—almost suffocatingly humid. I shimmied farther in and clicked on the flashlight.

What it revealed stole my breath.

The crawlspace was riddled with holes—gaping earthen orifices ranging from a foot and a half wide to massive openings nearly five feet across. Each one was rimmed with deep, spiraling impressions in the clay, undulations radiating outward in unmistakably serpentine patterns.

Every surface glistened with the same gelatinous ooze we’d found outside—still wet, tacky, and pulsing faintly with the humidity. The smell was overwhelming. There was air moving, but it left the space in shallow, breathy gasps, as if the ground itself were exhaling in protest at being exposed.

Both of us stood frozen.

I swept the beam slowly across the walls. I almost cracked a joke—something about mole people, one of Pa’s favorite high-time conspiracy debates—but I stopped mid-thought.

The light caught something moving beside him.

A thick, greying-white appendage—nearly a foot across—slid silently from one of the holes.

I shouted a warning as the substance dripped from it onto my father’s back.

Too late.

The thing slammed into him with full force, knocking the wind from his lungs. I lunged forward, grabbing for his hand, his shirt—anything—but I was helpless. I watched as his fingers clawed at the dirt, his boots scraping uselessly, before he was dragged screaming into one of the holes.

The sound echoed wetly through the chamber.

For a moment, I was stunned—still crawling forward, still hearing the dragging fade into the walls. I forced myself to act, shining the flashlight down the hole he’d vanished into.

There was nothing.

Just blood smeared along the clay before it disappeared into absolute black.

I scrambled backward, tearing myself free of the crawlspace and bursting back into the house. Mrs. Carlton jumped as I stormed inside—wild-eyed—to find her calmly preparing dinner.

The droning noise filled my head.

“What, in the actual unholy *fuck*, was that?” I shouted.

She looked at me with mild confusion. “What was what, dear?”

The casual dismissal made something snap inside me.

“That thing—under your house! It just took my dad. It took your husband!”

She smiled softly, patting her hands dry. “I don’t believe I’ve met your father, dear. And you’re the only one I know who’s been under my house since…”

She trailed off, struggling.

“Since your husband?” I offered.

For just a moment, her face fell.

Then the hum swelled.

She smiled again. “I don’t have a husband that I’m aware of.”

I left before I said something I couldn’t take back.

Outside at the truck, I forced myself to think. Whatever that thing was, it was enormous—and it had my father. I couldn’t leave. Whatever reason it had for taking him, it wasn’t a good one.

I gathered what I could: rope from the equipment bin, spare batteries for the flashlight, a short trenching shovel. After a moment’s hesitation, I grabbed the cavalry sword from the mantle and packed it all into a tool bag with my lunchbox.

Not much. Better than nothing.

I locked the truck, shut off the CO₂ tank, and parked it in the garage. I hid the keys in the front wheel well—hoping whatever spell or chemical fog she was under would keep her away from heavy machinery.

Back under the house, I tied the rope tightly to a concrete support pillar and tested it hard. It held.

If I died today, it wasn’t going to be because of a bad knot.

I dropped the rope into the same hole I’d seen my father dragged into.

It never hit bottom.

As I stared into the void, the hum returned—pressing against my thoughts. The black ichor clung to the edges of my vision, threatening to spill inward.

Then my flashlight caught something.

Glasses.

One lens was cracked and spiderwebbed with fractures, dotted with fresh blood.

I tucked them carefully into my chest pocket.

With the last of the evening sun bleeding over the mountains behind me, casting long crimson shadows across the crawlspace, I tightened my grip on the rope and began my descent into the dark.

I'm a long time fan of the show and a long time writer, but I've never done any horror before so I decided I'd give it a shot here. This is something I cooked up very quickly because I like the idea of where I'd want this to go in the future and I want to force myself to actually write it out. As a result, I'm unsure of how many mistakes are in here and I apologize for any you may find.

One final note! This is a slow burn story! Sorry if that is not up your alley, it's just what I prefer to write. Thank you!)

**SERENITY RIDGE - PART 1**

My brother and I moved to Serenity Ridge, Vermont, just before he turned eighteen. It was to get away from our father. When Carter saw him move onto his third wife in five years he just couldn’t stand it anymore. 

He walked into my room with pleading eyes, his bags already packed, overflowing with his knitted sweaters and cardigans. He had his mother’s eyes that day, big round earthen pools which seemed to swallow up the whole world as they sparkled; teasing tears. My first stepmother always knew how to make me feel guilty. I just wish that Carter hadn’t been such a good pupil of hers. 

I was twenty-one when he walked in that day, bouncing from job to job around our sleepy Upstate New York town. Nothing ever seemed to stick with me. Jobs became boring, I became apathetic and before I knew it, I was out of work the same month in which I had started the job. 

Carter knew this. He knew that I hated our father; that I hated this town; that I wanted nothing more than to pick up and walk out and never look back. Needless to say, it wasn’t hard to convince me to pack my bags. 

I don’t know where my father was the day we left. If I had to take a wager, he would have been down at the bar, chasing more ‘young tail’ to satiate his never ending hedonistic thirst. But I do know where his newest wife was that day. Her name was Stacy, a doe-eyed, ditsy blonde who’s messy hair and obnoxious makeup were only the second and third worst qualities she possessed. She rattled off meaningless jargon to us in her horrid, screeching voice as we walked out the door; endless fluff about town gossip; swirling, crass rumors about our father. 

Both of us knew not to tell her the truth of those rumors. Newlyweds of only two months usually don’t believe the words of apathetic children regarding the misdeeds of their fathers. But she would learn soon enough that she should have heeded our earlier warnings; the warnings we gave her before she walked up to the altar. I can only imagine that our father is onto wife fifteen or twenty by now, placing a ring on every passing fling he can convince to do so. 

No, we walked out silently to my car and started the engine without so much as a word spoken. And it was only after the roar of the pistons sounded beneath my car’s hood that Carter sighed in relief. 

The first thing he said to me was ‘thank you,’

The first thing I asked him was ‘what now?’

He told me we were going to Serenity Ridge.

I told him the hell we were.

He looked at me with those ancient, oak brown eyes and I folded. 

We didn’t even stop for gas on our way over. 

***“Jules died in Serenity Ridge”***

At least that’s what I’ve been told my whole life. My mother told it to me. Jules' mother told it to me. Jules’ and Carter’s and I’s father preached it as if it were gospel. 

Jules died in Serenity Ridge, Vermont. 

The police said so. It must be true. 

Carter never thought so. The police never found a body. The police, according to him, never did so much as an investigation. 

Jules disappeared when I was nine. He was twenty-three. He had already come to know our father well and had grown tired of his endless flings and vices. He packed up and left without a word one fall; never so much as wrote to us again. 

I can still remember the day I was told the news. Carter’s mom was still in the house, the longest lived of any of my father’s transient romances. The trees outside my bedroom window beamed as cadmium red and yellow rhinestones, sparkling in the late autumn sun. The dirt outside was loamy, the grass cool and damp to the touch. Carter was running around the backyard as I gnawed on a sandwich, taking small, mouse-like bites from the center to avoid the crust. And then she walked in, brown eyes swimming with tears, holding a paper in her trembling fist.

We never even so much as visited Serenity Ridge. Our father forbade it. In reality, he probably didn’t want to spend any more time away from the bars than he had to. What was one dead son when he could just make more? It wasn’t long after that when Carter’s mom left. She lost her custody battle; our father’s lawyer recorded yet another victory. 

There is a special place in hell waiting for that man.

I ended up letting it go. I never really knew Jules, he was always out of the house. He never talked to me, and if he’d been missing for over a decade, he probably wanted nothing to do with me. Whether he was alive or dead didn’t matter. He wasn’t a part of my life.

But Carter never let it go. 

Jules haunted him as some great family mystery; an injustice done onto us by unforgivable unseen forces. I don’t know if that was true, or if that was just posturing. I think he was just fascinated by it; the idea that someone of his own flesh and blood could just disappear. But either way it was an obsession.

For his fifteenth birthday I bought him a corkboard. He hugged me and told me it was the greatest gift he’d ever gotten. His junior year writing project was a paper on the family mystery. Every year he tried to convince our father to vacation in Vermont, never to any avail. 

But when we were in the car, he told me that this wasn’t about Jules.

I, of course, told him he was full of shit. 

But he said he just wanted to see it. That deep down in his gut, all he wanted was to see the town, to live there and understand how Jules could have disappeared.

I laughed at him and reminded him that this reasoning still was all about Jules. He rolled his eyes and looked out the window. And without looking at me he muttered, 

“I just…I have to see it…”

I raised my eyebrows,

“See what?”

“I’m not sure…I’ll know when I see it,” he huffed at me, annoyed,

“Real promising…” I snorted, “But maybe this’ll be a fresh start…God knows we could use it…”

………………………………………………………………………………………

We arrived late that night, the moon hanging low in the murk autumn sky as curtains of clouds drifted across its facade. A thick miasma of fog hung over the roads, heavy and low, anchored to the timber leashes of the surrounding forest. Carter was already asleep, his head pressed up against the cold, steamed, glass of the passenger side window. His mouth hung open, drooling against his shirt. I could hardly keep my eyes on the road. They strained to peer through the fog, an impenetrable veil. 

But then it gave way, deep in the heart of a valley, nestled between verdant hills of pine and maple; first a corner store, then a coffee shop. I sighed in relief as I pulled into the first parking lot I could find. 

The town was dead quiet, beyond even that. I couldn’t hear a gust stir the trees or a cricket chirp its mournful tune to the stars above. It was beyond silent; unworldly stillness. I kicked my seat back and rubbed, my hands over my eyes, the thrumming hum of the car's engine purring as a defiant stand to the silence of the night. I must have fallen asleep not long after.

The fuel tank was empty by the time I awoke. Carter was still laid up against the door, his neck perched oddly against his makeshift pillow. The sun had teased itself above the sloping mountains around us, trickling its warmth down through the leaves as a sun-kissed stream. It filtered down upon Serenity Ridge as vernal lifeblood. And through that lifeblood’s letting, the town began to rile and churn. 

I sat up in my chair, peering through the frosted pane of glass to my side. Through the streets on a frosty mid week morning, all manner of denizens shuffled their way through the mainstreet sidewalks. Mothers walked their daughters and sons, backpacks slung over their shoulders like rucksacks, far too big and bulky for their tiny frames; the carapases of beetles atop spindly legs. An old couple shared a coffee outside the cafe, their breath spilling as smoke from the mouths of dragons. Wisps of heat trailed from the steaming mugs they clung to. The hum of cars and the rumbling of treads across pavement echoed throughout the surrounding hills, dampening and softening until it filled the space as whispering wooshes, indistinguishable from the gentle breeze that tousled the hair of those who marched outside my window. 

It was an enrapturing scene. A picturesque snapshot of quaint bliss. I still can't put my finger on why it touched my heart so, but the first emotion that graced me past my awe was bitter resentment. Resentment for my father, for keeping this place from me, from Carter. I seethed in my seat for what must have been minutes, watching out my window in frozen envy.

A knock on Carter’s door pulled me from my stupor. I dragged my gaze from the scene outside to find a burly man crouched and peering through Carter’s window. He offered a soft smile, hardly visible through his thick beard. My heart dropped a bit as he motioned for me to roll down the window. Carter sleeplily lifted his head from his slumber, a strand of saliva trailing from his lips to the window. He nearly jumped out of his skin as he turned to see the man. Outside, I could see his beard struggling to conceal a smirk. 

He said he was a butcher. We had spent the night in the parking lot of the local deli and our car conveniently took up the delivery truck’s designated spot. I cobbled together a hasty apology, appealing to the man's good nature as best I could.

He laughed and told me it was fine.

The smile faded a bit when I told him we were out of gas. 

Through annoyed glances and morning grumblings the car was towed and the freezer truck pulled into port,

“That’s a heck of a place to run empty,” the butcher chuckled, shaking his head as he watched my car be pulled down the street on two wheels, 

“I truly didn’t mean to sir!” I stammered, “It’s just I was driving all night and I was so tried that I-”

He raised a hand to stop me, 

“It’s alright, kid. I’m just glad you ran dry here and not out in the woods. You’re lucky to end up here, not many other towns around here,”

“I’m glad too, sir,” I sighed in relief,

“Where were you heading off to? With any luck we can get you back on the road before lunch. I’ll pack ya something to eat if you want,” he waved for us to follow him as he moved towards the back door of the deli, 

“We were heading here,” Carter spoke, his voice meek and tender upon the open air, as if he were tentative to assert himself between us. 

I turned to look at him. He was always such a small kid. Hardly to my shoulders even at seventeen. Couldn’t have been more than a hundred and twenty pounds, his arms like spindly twigs. I always looked like an ugly brute next to him. Some knuckle-dragging neanderthal or ogre, our only similarity being the dust blond color of our hair. Our father’s hair. 

But he was extra minute in that moment, his hands behind his back, shoulders square, head turned ever so slightly to the ground as if he were standing in pious reverence. The filtered sun showered upon him down from the tree tops, like golden motes of flame.

The man stopped walking and in one swift motion turned to face us again,

“You meant to come here?” his face involuntarily screwed in upon itself for a moment, “Why?”

“I…” Carter started, his voice so fragile and quiet, “I needed to…” I could see him wracking his mind for an answer that eluded logic, 

The butcher’s face seemed to soften and fall as he looked upon Carter. It seemed to me to be pity that crossed his face,

“Not a lot of people intend to come here, son,” he said, low and rumbling, ""Even less come without a reason,” 

I heard it in there again; pity,

Carter lowered his head further, staring at the weathered pavement beneath his feet as if he were in prayer, 

“It’s family business,” I cut in, “He doesn’t like to talk about it,” my voice more assertive and gruff, shielding Carter from the prying graze that now fell upon him, 

The man bit his cheek, ""’’Makes no difference to me…” 

His voice was hollow as he turned around and walked inside the deli, the flashing neon sign flickering to life not long after. 

Carter picked his head up from the pavement beneath his feet and let out a tense sigh. I could see his shoulder fall and relax. He half turned his head to look at me, his deep brown eyes for some reason pooling with a strange apprehensive sadness that I had never seen before,

“Thanks…” he muttered to me, seemingly ashamed,

“For what?”

But he already seemed lost in thought. I watched as he traced the buildings down the main street, the overhead canopy of spruce and maple, the darting flight patches of finches and sparrows. His eyes were glassy,

“Carter…” I moved close and tousled his shoulder, snapping his attention back to me, “You alright…?”

“It’s a lot to take in…”

“We…we can go home if you want…is it not what you expected…?”

“...it’s…it’s exactly like I expected…” his voice was distant and ponderous, “It’s gorgeous…”

He was right. To this day Serenity Ridge is a verdant gem, the most beautiful place I have ever seen. Brick buildings, splendidly aged and upkept, seem to prowl as mountain lions, their front facades poking out from lush thickets of trees and underbrush. The hills which encompass the town roll like waves, sloping and receding with perfect spacing, on and forever into the horizon. The sun crests them and trickles down their slopes, filtering through the leaves of their trees, casting the bowl of the town in cadmium golden splendor. The rushing of brooks sing through the town as they sprint down the mountainsides and crooning of songbirds join in on their chorus.

I’m convinced that we walked into Eden that day. A place so serene and hidden that man was not meant to tread there. 

At least not the unclean. 

Not Carter and I,

“It’s something. Could use a decent parking lot,” I huffed, “Now I gotta see how much the tow bill is,”

“Can we…” Carter started, “Can we wait on the car?”

“No we…” his mother’s eyes stared into mine and disarmed me, “...we’ve got nothing but time…sure,”

He paraded me through the town, gawking at every quaint house and storefront alike. To my chagrin, Carter took the same approach with the locals, jabbering and yarn spinning with every air of listening ears he could come across. 

Carter was always much more of a people person than I was. He had the mind for it, a mind that loved to listen, to learn; a ceaseless yawning hunger. 

My mind was quiet. A straight shot. A to B. Whatever was the fastest way to solve a problem was what I took. Or rather, whatever was the easiest way to solve a problem was what I took. 

Talking to the locals was not the fastest way to get my car back. Talking to the locals was not on my mind. 

But while my general apathy towards knowledge existed in most subjects, I could never find it within myself to discount art. Back when my mother was about the house, when Jules was around the house, it was all yearned for. I scribbled on every inch of scrap-paper I could find, petitioning for my Mom to pin it to the fridge as some great Monet-esque triumph of the medium. When she lost her custody battle Jules would humor me with little art galleries. At least until he left. My father would do nothing of the sort. 

My hand for art died there. But the spark of love I had for it burned eternal. I remember scouring art books after school for pieces I loved, showing them to Carter, trying to instill in him the same love I had kindled. He instead decided to take up crochet, much to my disappointment. Instead of murals to admire, I scoured pattern books for my future pullovers.

All this to say, whilst Carter talked away the sun's light with the locals, I was enraptured with the art laid about the town. Over brick and concrete stretched bright and vibrant facades of rolling hills and sunsets, of rivers and moonrises. And encircling the town center, painted across the front of every building was the mural. 

Standing at the flower bed of the central square it encompassed you completely. A mural transitioning from day to night and day again on a gradient that flowed in and out of itself with effortless grace. It moved between forest clearings and brooks and mountains and ponds and all manner of deepswoods, the light and shadow intertwining and playing, coy and teasing, ending or beginning on some sort of equinox centered on a mossy cave flanked by ancient oaks which seemed to swallow the stone. 

Out of the cave poked a head, as equally coy and teasing as the subtlety of the light which showered the half of the cave. It was the head of a deer, a buck, his antler tines twisting like branches as he looked to the sun, only his neck and head visible outside of the cave. In the next scene he was there again, full-bodied, strong and healthy, drinking from a moonlit stream. And then again, standing atop a hill, watching the sunrise. And again, standing before the moon as it sank beneath that lake. And again and again and again, around and around the circle until in the dark of the equinox I saw his hindquarters trotting into the cave, the motion portrayed in beautiful stillness at the end of a brush. 

I don’t know how long I studied and admired the piece, but it was long enough for Carter to wander back over to me from his endless chatter and tug on my shoulder. I jolted as he did, so rudely stolen from the wonder of the mural,

“You like the painting…?” Carter asked,

“Don’t you?”

“I guess…?” Carter said chuckling, “But you’ve shown me better in your books,”

“Finding one this nice in the wild is an honor,” I chastised,

“The man I met over there told me the librarian painted it. Took her ten years,”

I let off a low impressed whistle, “I’d like to meet her if I can then,”

“You think Jules saw this?” Carter posed,

My chest suddenly tightened,

“I…I hope so…that’s strange to think about…”

I moved in closer to the cave of the mural, inspecting the inquisitive eyes of the buck who braved out into the light of day. Beneath the moss and rocks of the cave lay a title card. 

*The Heart of the Valley*

“I was going to suggest we go to the police station next,” Carter posed, “They’ll have information on Jules. We can at least ask them for information on where to start poking around,”

I huffed, “So much for this trip not being about Jules,”

Carter smiled sheepishly, “I think it’s a good idea…”

His eyes flashed and I felt myself beginning to bend to him. I put my foot down,

“No. My car is impounded, we have nowhere to sleep, nothing to eat and you’ve talked half the day away!”

Carter rolled his eyes, “Come on! I know you’re curious too!”

“I’m not,”

“Yes you are!”

I sighed, shook my head, and walked off towards the repair shop, Carter protesting at my heels the whole way.

…………………………………………………………………………………………….

The man who towed my car will go to hell. That's all I was thinking as I walked back with Carter from the repair shop. Four-hundred dollars! Twice the money my impoverished self had liquidated! A weekend fee!

I yelled at him until I was red in the face. In response, he kept Carter and I from accessing our bags which we had foolishly left in the trunk. So I seethed as we walked back under the setting sun, occasionally bursting into hateful tirades which had Carter apologizing to the commonfolk around us on the street. Eventually he convinced me to head into a diner and we sat drinking the free water and watching the broiling red sun sink over the highest mountains, 

“Of course we’re stuck here…” I grumbled, dragging my hands over my face in despair, “Fucking of course we’re stuck here! God…why didn’t I turn off the car!?…”

Carter said nothing, only sipping on his water in pure silence. He knew better than trying to console me; it only ever made my indignation worse,

“What are we supposed to do now?!” I cried, “I don’t wanna call him! I don’t wanna head back, Carter!” 

I let my head hit off the table in defeat. A dull thud echoed throughout the restaurant. I could hear the uncomfortable shifting of patrons in their seats.

Carter set his drink down and resumed his sunward gaze. I rolled my head to the side in order to join him, 

“We’re never heading back…” Carter spoke after a long while, low and quiet, 

“Where the hell are we gonna live?” I moaned,

I could hear him drumming his hands on the table top,

“Here’s your food…” A sweet tentative voice rang out from behind me. A distressed and concerned looking waitress gently set a cheap hamburger in front of me. I couldn't even bring myself to lift my head as I said thank you,

“I take it you boys are from out of town?” she said, careful not to pry, 

“Yes ma’am,” Carter spoke, 

As my head lay atop the polished wood I studied her face. It was an aged face, carved with branching, stretching lines that coalesced like tributary rivers about the eyes. The lips sagged a bit and the jaw held within it a jowl like quality. The scent of cigarettes hung around her as a faint aura, scarcely noticeable against the aromas of grease and smoke that traced itself from the kitchen. 

But what I noticed most prominently in that moment, above all else, was her eyes as Carter spoke. Sudden solemness. The butcher flashed in my mind. She seemed to bury it almost as quickly as it had sprung upon her,

“And what’s the reason you find yourself in our little town?"" her voice honey-laced as she set a wrap down before Carter,

“I wanted to see the town ma’am,” he spoke placing half of his wrap on my plate, “My family has some history here,”

There again I could see the despair arise within her, stronger now,

“I’d hope it’d be a happy history,” she muttered, topping off his water,

Carter said nothing. The waitress chewed her cheek,

“Well!” she suddenly broke free from the oppressive silence that had been woven between us, “I at least hope you make some happy memories here! We’re always happy to see new people wandering through,”

“Not much wandering through to do here ma’am,” Carter spoke up again, “We have no way to leave,”

“And no money, Carter,” I grumbled, “We have to start wandering out as soon as possible…”

“I’m sure Mrs. Alder would cover your fee,” the waitress spoke up, “And she’s got more than enough room at hers for you to spend the night,”

“She’s the librarian, correct?” Carter posed, 

The waitress nodded, “And she’s always happy to see new faces. Here, you two eat up and I’ll give her a call,”

She left us without another word. Carter hardly had enough time to blurt out a thank you. I felt my stomach knot itself in dread from whatever Carter had just blindly walked us into,

“This is bad…” I moaned, slowly dragging my head off of the table and laying it in my hands, “This is really bad, Carter,”

He glared at me like I was spitting in his food, “I just got us a place to stay for the night,” he said taking a bit out of his wrap, 

“With a lady we don’t know, in a town we don’t know, with no way to leave,” I hissed, “I thought I taught you not to trust strangers back when you were six, but apparently we need to learn that again!”

“What would you have us do instead? Sleep outside?”

I dragged my hands over my face and sighed, “I would have never come here…”

Carter huffed and ate in silence, staring out the window as the sun sank low beneath the verdant hills. 

The waitress came back and told us of our new bunking arrangement with Mrs. Alder. Room, board and fifty dollars a day, in exchange for help around the library. The offer, however unappetizing to my sensibilities, was too good to pass up. Over the land line I heard the frail voice of an old woman croon with excitement and anticipation as she blabbered about having to clean her guest rooms. I sighed and thanked her again for her hospitality. 

By the time I returned to our table I found Carter happily chatting to the other patrons in my absence. He was smiling, alight and aglow in the dingy space of the diner, talking about anything at all with all who would listen.

I hung back, careful not to come into view of the other patrons for fear that my presence would shatter the joy Carter had crafted in my brief absence. Once the rolling cascade of speech had subsided and fallen away I reamerged, sitting down across from a smiling Carter. I could see his mind chewing up all the information it had extracted in my absence, the ceaseless, voracious beast that it was,

“We’ll be staying at the library, roughly a week or two and we’ll have enough money for the car and enough gas to get out of here,”

“What then?”

“I don’t know…we move on, find else somewhere to go,”

Carter chewed his cheek, “I was just talking to the sheriff,”

I raised my brow,

“He said they keep case files in the library’s storage. The town is so small that they don't have a proper station,” Carter went on with a smirk,

“Lucky you,” I smiled,

I dug into my meal and watched the moon shine against the clouds that draped the valley.

…………………………………………………………………………………………

We walked over to the library side by side beneath the jet black of night. Carter had kept me chained to the diner through his ceaseless talking with the closing staff, and I kept him chained to the diner’s bar through our waitress's infinite kindness, courtesy of on-the-house house-draft and liquor. 

Her name, which I later came to know to be Denise, was just about the only thing I didn’t discuss that night. It was plain for everyone to see that I was in a world of stress, and her old soul couldn’t stand to see me in that kind of way. Her solution was to offer me a deluge of hops and malt, for which I paid her back in kind with hiccup-filled retellings of our family's soul ties to Serenity Ridge, 

“I knew him,” Denise spoke with a maternal warmth as she cleaned down the bar. Hers was a voice that lit the hearth within your chest and dragged you upon its syllables, the voice of a reminiscing grandmother,

“Jules…?” I spoke sloppily, stumbling over myself as I leaned in closer,

“Tall kid, dark hair, bright eyes,” she mused, “Wise eyes…” she stopped wiping down the counter, “Went missing here just about a decade ago, just like you said,”

I carefully set down my draft, careful not to spill it over,

“Wha- happen…?”

She wrung the cloth in her hands. If I had been more in my mind I would have recognised it then; the same look of solemn pity. It wound itself around around us like a serpent,

“I wish I knew,” she said pursing her lips, wiping the counter down again in long methodical strokes, “But he’s the latest to go missing here. I can hardly believe he’ll be the last,”

“There’s more?!” I practically fell out of my chair. Gripped tight the countertop for my life,

“Many more,” Denise nodded, “This is the heart of the wild, the heart of the world. People walk into those woods and never come back. What becomes of them…harder to say…”

“Heart of the valley,” I slobbered over myself, my subconscious picking up upon the phrase in my delirium,

Denise for an instant looked at me with pinprick eyes. I could see them then as I still see them now, swimming with a terror so great and terrible that I wish for all the world I had never met her gaze. She stared at me for a painfully long instant, and upon recognizing my utter mental disarmament her eyes softened,

“It is a lovely painting isn’t it?” she spoke sweetly again,

“Beautiful!” I toasted, raising my glass so fast that I spilled half my draft. Denise mopped it up with a chuckle,

“Mrs. Alder made it, some many years ago…” she seemed lost in though for a moment,

“Which one of you decided to come here?” she finally spoke again after a long while,

“It was Carter’s idea…” my swaying hand motioned to where he sat talking to the rest of the closing staff,

Denise nodded slow and rhythmic,

“Jules’ brother as well?”

I nodded,

“And you never wanted to come here?”

I shook my head, ""Nope! Never! Only did it for him…I’d do anything for that kid…”

I saw Denise bite her lip,

“Then you’d better buy your car back quickly…”

She rushed out of the diner not long after.

The night was warm by May’s standards and the streetlights were welcoming enough for me to sober up on the curb after the cook locked up the diner for the night. Carter was less than pleased with me, and I was less than ready to hear it. By the time I had sobered up enough to walk over to the library it was almost two in the morning. A storm had begun to roll in from the south and a swarm of ebony clouds blanketed the sky in jet. 

Carter finished up using the payphone to call Mrs. Alder, confirming to her that we were still coming, as he had been forced to do for the past few hours while I fumbled about on the sidewalk. Irritated didn’t even begin to describe his demeanor towards me. She had told him that she was still waiting for us and intended to greet us at the door if she could keep herself awake. He had told me that he intended to let me sleep outside.

I of course reminded him who drove him here.

The walk over was silent and seething. Carter didn’t want to talk to me and I was far too self righteous to even entertain the idea of establishing some common ground. Instead I trained myself upon the quiet. 

It was the same quiet I had experienced on the drive into town, oppressive and omniscient. It was seemingly not a silence of absence but of abnormality. There was no wind howling through the trees as the storm blew overhead, not rustle of leaves as gale blew them upon their stalks. No nightbirds chirped or insects chimed. No frogs called from the streams. The only sound through all of the town was our two pairs of soles making time over the pavement. 

Incessant clicking, like the hand of a clock.

Repeated rhythm, like the beating of a heart.

One, two.

One, two. 

I could hear my own heart. I could hear the ringing in my ears.

And as I looked skyward I saw the tips of great pines swaying like dancers in the breeze, bowing and careening towards each other, their needles and leaves crashing together upon great clubbing branches. 

And I heard nothing.

I stopped,

“Carter!” I called,

My voice echoed out over the town, carrying for what felt like forever. I heard it echo off of brick facades and squared walls calling back to me in taunting rhythms, 

“What?” he called back annoyed,

“Stop…” I stammered, “Something’s wrong…”

He pivoted to me, eyes widened; alert,

“What happened!?” he began frantically scanning the space around me,

“Look,” I said pointing to the bowing trees, 

He rolled his eyes, “No shit, that why I wanna get going,”

“No!” I cried, “Why can’t we hear it?!”

“Can’t hear it?” he looked at me as if I’d gone insane, “I can hardly hear *you* over it!”

His words carried themselves to me as if spoken over a corridor of glass, as pristine and clear as I could even imagine. But he was yelling them, as if shouting over the roar of the storm,

“...what..?”

A streak of lightning tore across the sky, illuminating the clouds in a blazing white for the briefest of instances. Overhead they seemed to hang heavy like pulsing maggots, roiling in and out of each other in some sort of heavenly breathing. I braced myself for the thunder’s shockwave, the rattling of your bones and the ringing of your ears. I felt the boom of the bass in my chest, the involuntary ripping of air from my lungs as I gasped at the sensation. But the sound never reached me. The shockwave passed over me in utter silence. 

I saw Carter jump and cover his ears as the shockwave passed,

“Come on! We’re going!” He screamed to me, his voice so deafening above the silence of the waking world that I involuntarily winced against it. 

He tore off down the street. I rumbled after him.

We were in the town square, the mural surrounding us on all sides. In the thunderlight of the storm the deer flickered as bounding forms, darting and leaping between vignettes of mossy stones and ancient oaks. All seemed black but its eyes, all shadow and silhouette except the glimmering and curious whites of the eyes which I had so admired not more than twelve hours before. Now they seemed to glare and stalk as they appeared and receded within the thunderlight. The Hart of the valley watched us from within its painted majesty. 

The rain came as we passed the flowerbed at the town center. Thundering mallets of water, sprinting down from the heavens or otherwise hurled upon the realm of the living with such ferocity that I thought it could split stone. The storm came down in curtains so thick I could hardly see Carter ten feet before me.

But I never heard it. 

I saw it run rivers across the asphalt beneath my feet, strip trees of their leaves, and drench Carter so completely that his bangs hung over his eyes like an old sheepdog. 

And all I could hear was the sound of our footsteps and our breathing. 

I couldn’t hear the splash of water as our tracks kicked it up behind us. 

I couldn’t hear the hammering of water on my ears.

The rush of wind past my face.

The cracking of lightning.

The snapping of branches.

The pattering of rain across rooftops.

Nothing. 

My lungs felt tight. My mind was spinning. My body ached as I tried to keep pace with Carter.

We scrambled up the front steps of an old wooden colonial house, the lights still on in its den. Carter pounded at the door, huffing, soaked, shivering. 

A frail old woman stood at the other side once the threshold opened, her hair white and frizzy, back bent and thin. Mrs. Alder hurried us in, apologizing for not keeping the door open. She said she hadn’t realized the strom had started,

“You couldn’t hear it?” I asked, 

She shook her head and apologized,

“And you’re all the worse for it. I’m sorry son…” she fawned over Carter,

He assured her that he was alright and thanked her again for the hospitality in the people-pleasing way in which his mother had crafted him. I just stood trying to recover my breath.

Mrs. Alder whisked Carter away for towels and new clothes, 

“You lucked out!” she smiled at me, “All dry! Take your pick of the bedrooms while we get your brother a change of clothes,” 

She staggered away with Carter in an uneven gate as I stood awestruck. 

I didn’t look down before I felt my shirt with my hand.

Dry.

I looked. 

Dry. 

My hair, my skin, my shoes, my pants. 

Not a single sign I had ever been out in the storm. 

I threw open the front door. The storm raged on in silent defiance. 

I slammed the door closed. A loud wooden crack echoed through the library. I knocked on a table. The sound of knuckles against mahogany. I flicked the first vase I could find. A glass chime sang through the air. I stomped the floor. A thunderous boom through the den. 

I opened the door again. The rain was silent. 

I stepped out into the storm. First under the awning. Then a hand ventured into the clubbing aqua mallets. 

I saw them hammer into my skin. They wicked off my fingers as if I were covered in wax. Tiny perfect spheres that rolled off of my palm. I pushed my sleeve out, woven cotton. The rain ran off it in rivers. Not a single drop stuck. 

I must have sat there for an hour under the awning. Long enough for the storm to stop and for Carter to place a hand on my shoulder, waking me from my stupor.

He had an oversized Christmas sweater on, adorned with reindeer pulling Santa’s sleigh around him in one endless circle. Somehow, it suited him. He smiled at me. The outside was so quiet I could measure his breaths,

“Hell of a storm,” he laughed, hunkering down next to me,

“Yeah…” I said, mystified, 

“How the hell didn’t you get soaked?”

“I…I don’t…know…”

“And it’s still going too, I can hear it blowing over top the mountain over there,”

“I…I can’t hear it Carter…”

“God, how drunk are you?”

I looked at my hands, “I’m not sure…I need to go to bed…”

“Come on big guy,” Carter grumbled as he helped me to my feet, throwing my hulking arm over his shoulder. He hardly supported a tenth of my weight, but I let him think he was helping. 

We settled in the attic, a dusty, cluttered, low-ceiling attic in which two cots were laid out for us. Apparently the guest bedrooms had been so overrun with old documents and books that there was no salvaging them for the night. That night, the cot was the best bed I’d ever had the pleasure of laying in. 

By the time the sun had risen and a new stream of lifeblood wound its way through the attic window Carter was already awake. He pulled me from the deepest slumber I’d had in years with a shake of my shoulder. I rolled to my side and with one eye half open I drearily asked what was wrong, 

“Can you hear it?” he asked in a low whisper, gesturing out to the rolling verdant hills beyond the attic,

“I already told you I can’t hear the storm…” I grumbled into my pillow, closing my eyes again,

1qn3fnr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qn3fnr,I followed r/moonjelly33’s brownie recipe ✨💚,"As a note I’ve only been baking for three weeks so far, so I’m fairly new to baking and trying to learn.

I was wondering if someone could tell me why I didn’t get the glossy crackly tops? 

I did accidentally pour in the instant coffee with the eggs and the sugar but figured that might not make too much of a difference, but that could’ve attributed to the non glossy tops, or maybe I didn’t let my butter cool down enough with cocoa? Or maybe I stirred in the AP flour too much?

Any advice is appreciated :)

Moon jelly’s recipe:

Original post

I read through nearly every recipe in the thread, noting common ingredient ratios and techniques. The recipe below is adapted from Stella Parks, Broma Bakery, Tasty, “Supernatural Brownies,” Sally’s Baking, and a few personal recipes from commenters.

I asked for a “better than Ghirardelli box mix” brownie recipe and y’all delivered. These are the most gooey, fudgy, rich, moist brownies I’ve ever had. My friend loved them. We had them with vanilla ice cream. ❤️

GOOEY FUDGY BROWNIES

1 cup (227g) butter, to be browned

1 cup (90g) Dutch-process cocoa powder

4oz (113g) dark or semisweet (60% cacao) chocolate, finely chopped

1 tsp instant espresso (or 1 Tbsp instant coffee)

1.5 cups (300g) white sugar

1/2 cup (100g) brown sugar

1 Tbsp vanilla

4 eggs

1 cup (120g) flour

1 tsp coarse kosher salt

optional: 1 cup additional chopped chocolate or chocolate chips, or 1-2 cups chopped walnuts, dried cherries, etc.

1.	⁠Preheat oven to 350°. Line 9x13” pan with foil or parchment paper with overhangs for easy removal.

2.	⁠Put cocoa powder, chopped chocolate, and espresso powder in a heat-proof bowl.

3.	⁠Make brown butter: Melt butter in a light-colored saucepan over medium-low heat. Once foaming and spitting, stir and scrape bottom with a spatula every 10-15 seconds. Grainy white milk solids will begin to appear on the bottom. Continue for 5-10 minutes (go by senses, not time). When foam clears and spitting noises go silent, watch closely: The milk solids will toast in seconds. As soon as the solids turn brown and smell nutty, remove pan from heat so it doesn’t burn.

4.	⁠Immediately pour hot brown butter into prepared bowl, to bloom cocoa and melt chocolate. Stir until smooth. Set aside to cool.

5.	⁠With a stand or hand mixer, whip sugars, vanilla, and eggs on medium-high until thick, smooth, fluffy, and lightened in color. For very moist, rich brownies, stop after 4-5 minutes. For slightly more height and fluff, whip 8-10 minutes until very thick and pale. (I did the lower end of the spectrum, 4-5 minutes—I’d recommend starting there.)

6.	⁠Reduce speed to low. Slowly pour chocolate-butter mixture into egg foam mixture until incorporated.

7.	⁠Using a spatula, fold in flour and salt until just incorporated. Fold in additional chocolate if using. Batter will be very thick.

8.	⁠Scoop and spread batter evenly into prepared pan.

9.	⁠Bake 25 minutes until surface is glossy and just set (not jiggly in center). Do not overbake. They will finish cooking as they cool.

10.	⁠Let cool at least 30 minutes before removing from pan to slice.

NOTES

•	⁠White sugar + foaming eggs = fudgy centers with classic glossy, crackly tops. The thicker your egg foam, the glossier/cracklier your top crust.

•	⁠Brown butter deepens flavor and evaporates excess water in the butter. If you don’t want to brown the butter, melt it in a saucepan with the chopped chocolate, stirring until smooth. Pour over cocoa powder and espresso powder. Stir until smooth.

•	⁠For extra thick brownies, use 8x8” pan. Bake time will be a bit longer.

I had all of these challenge cooking leftovers to use up, (not to mention REALLY needed my containers back) so I I threw it all into what I’m calling a “Leftovers Hot Pot”.

Ingredients (as numbered):

1. Sausage Gravy (from breakfast)…about 3 big scoops) ((trust the process!!))

2. Mushroom barley soup (all of it!)

3. Spicy/Sweet Peach Chutney (half-ish? The rest I threw in the freezer before it goes bad cuz 🤤)

4. Chicken Satay with Thai Peanut Sauce (all but the skewer!)

5./6. Braised Chicken with Bacon and Cabbage…half of the cabbage and all of the chicken but the bone

7. 3 packs of Cheap Ramen/seasoning and about 1/3 pot of water

Then I just let it cook til the noods were done!

I usually add sesame oil, eggs, hoisin, etc etc to my Ramen but this needed NOTHING ELSE!!! It was the most phenomenal ramen that I’ll never have the pleasure of making again. The odds of me having all of these challenge cooking leftovers at once (and ALSO making biscuits and gravy for breakfast) are less than my odds of winning the lottery!!!

This is kitchen witchery at my finest!! And eating it surrounded by the pups while I watch OITNB and drinking my coffee is my idea of a good time on a snow day.",2,1769394504.0,52WeeksOfSoup2026,4,0.75,False

Maybe I should get a journal and spare you all from my late night thoughts, better out than in though so settle in if you are interested, if not, I won’t be offended. This helps me stay accountable. 

Today marks 100 days without alcohol. I am shooketh. Thank you to this sub for your support and tips, and allowing to vent without judgement, you anonymous legends! IWNDWYT

On the 19th of October, I had what I didn’t know to be would be my last drink at my friend’s house. We met in the pub and our relationship was very centred around alcohol. We became firm and fast friends. She was my rock when my relationship broke down, my therapist and my biggest cheer leader. I didn’t expect to meet my soul mate at this big age, we clicked immediately and she supported me when I needed a hug and a safe space to drink and cry about how hurt I was until I stumbled home sending drunk texts to my ex, sounding desperate and confirming his suspicions that I’d been drinking, Again. Re-inforcing his decision that I couldn’t give up drinking, we were toxic and I hadn’t changed. I had though, and I kept myself quiet, not begging, not crying over a man who couldn’t give up smoking and drinking when we made a pact too, i supported him but he wanted to smoke and drink when he had a bad day, i managed to cut down and rewarded myself with a drink at the weekends, it wasn’t good enough but now i’m 100 days in and somehow doing both and doing it well. I have changed and I want him to see that but I won’t message him, I have more glowing up to do! 

Until the 19th when I didn’t feel like drinking but had a few glasses and nursed my last glass, very unlike me, but I had gradually cut down from almost 3 bottles a night at my worst and heaviest drinking, ashamed in private, a menace on my phone, stuck in a rut, depressed, fat, single again, full of regrets in the morning, but when in public, the wine drinking machine, putting on a smile, hiding all the pain I was drinking away and kept going until I passed out. Thinking I was ok because I was working and still showing up, I was far from ok. I was not realising what was to come. 

I was in hospital for a few weeks after i stopped and assumed I’d go right back to the habit of almost 3 bottles a night but I enjoyed not being hungover, i started to count every Sunday as another week without drinking, feeling better everytime I made it to another Sunday night. Thinking this won’t last, I’ll cave and go back to “normal” but here I am, at 100 days starting a new “normal” 

I recovered well, and had to adjust to life after my op but still, the noise and want for a drink still wasn’t coming. Even when I was told there was  cancer found at my post op check up, I didn’t cope with 3 bottles of wine and get myself depressed, step back in my recovery, hid myself away. I focused on the positives and leant on my family and friends for support. Taking it one day at a time and feeling the feels but still, no wine noise. I was expecting a deafening return. I didn’t understand why I wasn’t wanting to drink, I was wary of this new feeling but didnt cave when I was struggling with my diagnosis 

I worried about the holidays coming up, my birthday, friends birthdays, Christmas, new year, parties and just the “fuck it it’s Christmas” excuse to get drunk that people expected of me and the “better safe than sober” line as I bought far too much drink, saying this will do me for ages, lying to myself, knowing it wouldn’t but I managed to stay sober the whole time. I was immensely proud of myself

I was tested a few times and it was difficult but I surrounded myself with my people who knew I was off the drink and supported me. I made it through my first festive season in a long old time sober. And it was great! 

I realised my mental health was getting better, my sleep was improving (I have battered the coffee all day but I’m not worrying about a hangover tomorrow I’m enjoying the peace and getting my thoughts down), I was making time for self care, my skin was looking good, I was losing weight and had more energy. I was off sick still so I had every excuse to drink the days away but I still had no wine noise and was enjoying my new routines, I came onto this sub and played the tape forward when I felt that I was having a wobble and got the support I needed from anonymous strangers in the same boat, re-reading my accountability journals and realising how far I’d come and managing to overcome the urge. I settled for tea and biscuits happy with my choice, knowing it was the best choice for me, still waiting on falling off the wagon, but it wasn’t that night. I would see what happens the next night. This was all new uncharted territory, I was a heavy drinker for as long as I could remember, now I’m having tea and biscuits and self care nights. Proper self care nights not the kinds of having a ton of wine on an empty stomach and then eating rubbish before bed, putting on an audiobook about stopping drinking and hoping that would undo the bad; that wasn’t self care, that was self destruction. I can look back and see that I wasn’t kind to myself, I don’t even think I liked myself. I’m making up for that everyday now. 

Now at 100 days, I’m surprised at the changes I’ve made, the new routines, the realisation that I can do almost anything with a sober mind and support, once i conquer the feelings towards my ex, I’ll feel lighter in my mind but that will take as long as it takes, this will substitute messaging him. There will be more challenges to overcome but I’ve made it this far, what’s the worst that can happen by continuing without drinking? In 100 days I’ve not regretted not having a drink the night before and dealing with some pretty big shit in my life has been easier without alcohol being involved. I don’t know where my urge went for wine but it’s not welcome back anytime soon. 

I am just back from said besties and mentioned it’s 100 days and she knew because she counts every weeks with me. drinking coffee and vaping looking healthy and happy. I went back to work and in the office for the first time in 3 months and people noticed a difference, it was lovely to hear the compliments on my new look and not be smelling of stale drink and cigs, covered in perfume trying to hide it  like before. I had earned every single congratulations. I felt so good

I am happy, happy for this new chapter. I am enjoying the days I’m taking day by day now. not counting down to a drink or dreading waking up hungover and unfocused, cringing at the texts I’ve sent. 

I am having to feel the feels of the break up. It’s hard not to reach out and tell him I done it and I’m doing it fill him in on what’s been happening but as they say revenge is a life well lived and mine is becoming well lived. If I could just stop thinking of him, that would be fabulous but last time we separated, I suppressed the feelings and coped with alcohol, too much of it and lost myself, not caring if I didn’t wake up in the morning. Now finding myself going thru the same but sober has been tough but nothing like the last time, I’m kinder to myself, having my glow up and I’m doing the things and feeling the feels and will continue to thrive. 

Thank you for your support, again. IWNDWYT",27,1769394468.0,stopdrinking,1,1.0,False

I want to make sure I'm being respectful of my actors considering they won't be paid very much (about £100/$135 a day) and want to avoid burning them out.

It's a **4 day shoot** over 2 weekends mostly involving 2 actors. My current plan is **9am-9pm** with a 1-hour break for lunch (around like 12-1pm?), 1-hour break for dinner (around 5-6pm?), so 10 hours of on-set work each day. 

I'm conscious of ensuring my actors aren't burned out so just wanted to check if that seemed unreasonable. 

It's my first time doing this level of film so I want to make sure I have fair expectations of my cast. I was also gonna make sure snacks/fruit/coffee etc are available in the shooting location at all times, and just try to do whatever I can to make the cast as comfortable as possible.

Anything I'm doing wrong here? Much appreciated!",1,1769394459.0,Filmmakers,3,1.0,False

I can’t work and live with my parents. I’m depressed, anxious, and easily overstimulated. I go to coffee shops a lot and everyone is on their phones and laptops with headphones on. Even at bars people generally don’t want to talk to a single guy sitting alone (plus bars can be so loud and draining). 

I don’t wish to come across as conceited but I do feel like I am above average in attractiveness and intelligence. I’m friendly, self aware, and caring. I don’t want to lower my (very reasonable) standards for others just because I’m chronically ill and lonely. I’m not going to try to force connection with people who are uninterested in me or incompatible. 

I desperately need friends and human connection or shit is going to get **dark**. I have had to accept so many things beyond my control. I simply can’t accept just being alone with my thoughts indefinitely. 

I am lucky that my ME/CFS is now mild enough that I am physically capable of the occasional hangout, I have the emotional availability to be a good friend/partner, and I am willing to risk rejection, pain, and trauma in the hopes of finding connection.

Most of it is just some wannabe alpha influencer pushing overpriced whiskey decanters, LED strip lights, and marble soap dispensers. Been there, bought the junk, donated it two months later. So I went digging into what actually improves your space, your mood, and how others perceive you, backed by behavioral science, interior psychology, and real lifestyle research.

This isn't about impressing people with a $500 coffee table book. It's about setting yourself up with a high-functioning, low-maintenance, and genuinely respectable living space. Something that makes you feel grounded, and yes, bonus points if others think you're killing it too. Here’s a curated, no-nonsense set of essentials, inspired by the Courtney Ryan video but with deeper sourcing and zero fluff. 



*Quality bedding (It’s not optional).*  

Why? Sleep is your foundation. And adulting starts with not sleeping on mismatched, scratchy sheets.  

 A study in ""Sleep Health Journal"" (2017) showed that people who invested in high-quality sheets and properly cleaned bedding reported better sleep quality and mental clarity.  

Go for: 100% cotton or bamboo sheets in neutral colors. White, gray, or navy. You’re not in college anymore.

Pro tip: Ditch the “bed-in-a-bag” and get a proper duvet insert with a washable cover. It elevates your whole setup. 



*A full-length mirror (no, gym selfies don’t count).* 

You need to see your outfit head-to-toe. Perception matters.  

According to psychologist Dr. Dawnn Karen, author of ""Dress Your Best Life"", how you see yourself in the mirror directly impacts your confidence and posture.  

A simple, minimal-profile mirror against the wall works. Don’t complicate it. 



*A functional lamp (overhead lighting is a trap).*  

Harsh ceiling lights kill the vibe. Lighting affects mood, focus, and even attractiveness, per the findings in ""Journal of Environmental Psychology"" (2016).  

Use at least one warm-toned floor or table lamp. Bonus points if it's dimmable.  

Smart bulbs with adjustable light color are a small flex that actually improves sleep and ambiance. 



*Tool kit (for the small stuff that breaks).*

Everyone breaks something. Or wants to hang a frame. Or tighten a chair.  

A Columbia University study found that men who handle basic tools and repairs score higher in perceived self-efficacy and independence in relationships.  

Just get a small 32-piece set. Doesn’t need to be fancy. You’ll use it way more than you expect. 



*A signature scent for the home.*  

Smell is the most emotional sense. People remember how your place smells.  

Scent marketing is used in luxury hotels, cafes, and even retail stores because it increases perceived value. This is backed by research from the \*Journal of Consumer Research\* (2014).  

Try: Sandalwood, cedar, or vetiver-based diffusers. Candles are fine too. Just skip Axe body spray candles. 



*A laundry system that doesn’t reek*, *“mom still helps”.*  

Two hampers: one for lights, one for darks.  

A drying rack for delicates or sweaters.  

Proper detergent. Bonus: Some brands now offer enzyme cleaners to eliminate odor, eco-friendly and legit effective (check: Dropps, Blueland). 



*Some actual books (no, not just for decor).* 

A couple of hardcovers you actually read adds instant depth.  

Research from the University of Toronto shows readers are perceived as more empathetic and emotionally intelligent by peers.  

Don’t fake it. Choose stuff you’re into, psychology, business, fiction, whatever. Just no fake “aesthetic” stacks. 

Starter recs:  

\- ""Atomic Habits"" by James Clear  

\- ""Can’t Hurt Me"" by David Goggins  

\- ""The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*\*\*"" by Mark Manson 



*One clean hobby display (not a shrine).*  

Whether it’s a guitar, camera, vinyl, or chessboard, show what you’re into. It sparks conversation, adds personality, and breaks the IKEA catalog monotony.  

A study published in ""Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin"" found that visible hobbies in living spaces boosted perceived social status and “approachability”.

If you're redesigning your space or just starting out, these eight things work double-duty: improving your life and how others experience your home. Real talk, it's not about being rich, it's about being intentional. You don’t need a penthouse. You need things that show you care. Not perform for others, but silently signal, ""Yeah, I’ve got my life together.""

Gusto ko lang ishare yung realizations ko about fitness.

M: 25
H: 165cm
W: 57kg

*Magastos/mahirap controlin ang pagkain na nasa bahay kapag kasama mo pamilya mo and ang income ay sapat lang

*In relation sa unang bullet, mahirap abutin/maintain ang protein intake per day lalo na kung ang goal ay lumaki

Instead na mastress ako sa pagpapaganda ng katawan, I just go with the flow at gawin lang yung mga bagay na within my control at magset ng goals na achievable while not making it too hard on myself

*Black coffee most of the time pero umiinom rin ng milo or gatas 1-2 times per week

*Minimize intake ng biscuit, chichiria, sweets. Madalas nagpapabili na lang ako ng saging as alternative.

*Less kanin more on ulam

*Picky eater ako pero tinatry ko na rin kumain ng mga gulay kahit rekta tubig agad pagkasubo

*Daily ang workout pero 30 mins lang. 

*Alternate from upper body/arms (pull ups/push ups/barbell/dumbell) tapos legs (squats/rdl). 
Ex. Monday upper body, then Tuesday legs and so on.

*I also run every other day (usually after ng upper body workout). I really enjoy running and I treat it as me time

*Di na focus ang magkavisible abs, basta flat ang tiyan ko masaya na ko.

*As long as nakikita ko na nakakagalaw naman ako nang maayos then thats all I want.

This change in mindset really helped in lessening yung mental strain ng fitness culture for me and I can still eat yung mga favorite foods ko from time to time with less guilt lol.

Was in a cult up until 18 and never been on dates before but feel like I really just want to change this and finally build some confidence with dating others.

I downloaded hinge and after 3 weeks on it and many matches that led nowhere, I eventually talked to a girl which led to a coffee shop date we scheduled for today.

We talked for about 2 hours, but it all just felt so exhausting and I didn’t feel like there was much chemistry and knew that when she said she had to go that she was implying that she also knew this wasn’t going to work. 

I felt like I constantly had to come up with things to say, and I am 100% sure she was thinking the same and also tried to carry the conversation when I couldn’t think of much either.

After we parted ways, I just genuinely felt exhausted and sad. There was barely any chemistry, barely any flirting and the conversations were really basic. I was trying to get to know her and learn about her, but it feels like she wasn’t entirely reciprocating in a way that I would have expected. 

It’s like she lost interest in me very early in the date and maybe it’s because I came across as very very nervous.

I don’t know. Is this normal? I just felt so exhausted. My humour didn’t land with her, I didn’t like my haircut, maybe she thought I wasn’t as good looking in real life or I was just too awkward, and just feel like I’ve got so much catching up to do when it comes to getting to know someone with the intent of dating.

She messaged me later saying “you’re genuinely really sweet, but I don’t think we’re a good match and I’ll leave it there.”

I responded with “Had a lovely time. I completely agree though and wish you all the best for your future :)”

I would just like some feedback on what could potentially be the first chapter of a book. I am trying to write. And this first chapter is just one of those partnerships. Any feedback would be great.","The precinct was already alive when we walked in, the low roar of voices mixing with the buzz of fluorescent lights. Morning shift. Coffee cups in every hand. I headed straight for the lockers. Quiet and clean. Shirt tucked, vest settled, radio clipped just right. I kept my eyes forward, like routine itself was something that could keep me steady. I entered the locker room at the back of the station, and my nostrils filled with the smell of sweat. Same smell every morning. I went to my locker, entered my code, and just as I was about to open the door, Patrick came around the corner. Patrick, Officer Sullivan was the loudest one in the room. He always was, and everybody else was used to it by now.

“Russell, my man, how have you woken up this morning? Y’all see the Giants playing last night? I’ve been telling y’all that if our quarterback can stay healthy-”

I finally opened my locker, trying my hardest not to feed into Patrick’s energy. Inside, my locker was decorated with photos and newspaper clippings. Not many. Just a few. One of them detailed me helping an old woman find her grandson. Another one wasn’t so flattering. That one wasn’t taped up; it had slipped inside through the slit of the locker. A story about a cop freezing up in the middle of danger when blood was seen from the victim, leading to the suspect getting away. My jaw tightened.

“Who slipped this in my locker?” I asked.

The locker room went quiet. Even Patrick stopped talking. I didn’t want trouble, so I turned back to my locker and crumpled the newspaper in my fist.

“Fuck y’all,” I murmured.

“It’s okay, buddy. It was just a joke,” Patrick said, trying to smooth it over. “No reason to get so hurt over it. I’m sure they didn’t mean it in any bad way. Just some harmless jabs at friends.”

I didn’t acknowledge him. I rolled my eyes and kept getting dressed. Patrick took a little longer to join in, but eventually he did. We both put on the uniform piece by piece. Undershirts. Button-ups. Cameras. Belts. They all went. Patrick pulled a slim gold crucifix necklace from his locker, kissed it, and tucked it into his undershirt. We weren’t allowed to wear jewelry, but he tried to sneak it on every day anyway. Sometimes he got caught. Sometimes he didn’t.

“You know, with us being partners now, that means we’re gonna be spending a lot more time together,” Patrick said, breaking the silence as he shuffled clothes. “You might as well just get warmed up to me already.”

“As long as you don’t talk my head off or get us killed, I feel like I’ll be fine,” I said.

I looked over at him and gave one of those awkward stranger smiles you give people on the street.

“Do you know how many buddy cop movies start like this? We could be the next-”

“ROLLCALL!”

That was one of the only things that could get Patrick to stop talking. I went back to my routine before eventually exiting the locker room and heading toward roll call. Patrick tried to keep up but stayed just a step behind. Once we got inside, the sergeant stepped up front and ordered everyone’s attention.

“All right, listen up. The city’s already moving, and we haven’t even gotten out there yet, so I’m gonna make this quick. Robberies are up almost twenty percent compared to last month. Our response times have been three to five minutes; we need to bump that down to a minimum of two. Before you leave this room, double-check your equipment. Make sure you have everything and that it’s in working order. Turn on your body cams. Mic check everything. We want everybody to go home at the end of the shift. Watch each other’s backs. Dismissed.”

Patrick and I stood up and did exactly what we were told. We checked our belts and made sure everything was in the right place. Pepper spray. Taser. Handgun. Handcuffs. Extra magazines. Everything is perfect. Right before we exited the room, we turned on our cameras and did a mic check.

“Breaker break one-nine, come in,” Patrick said, chuckling at his own joke.

Nobody laughed. Just uninterested glares. Patrick remembered it was his turn to hit the equipment room, so he headed off while I went to sign out and inspect the car. He talked to the quartermaster and grabbed a bag with extra essentials, handcuffs, radio batteries, sometimes snacks, and water bottles. He lifted the bag and the shotgun with ease. When he got to the garage, I was already checking the vehicle. I didn’t make any effort to help him. I stayed focused on the inspection checklist. Tires aired properly—no paint damage. Everything is in working order. Finally, we were ready. We got into the vehicle and pulled out of the garage.

“Another day,” Patrick said.

“Another day,” I repeated.

We’d been driving around downtown New York for a couple of hours when Patrick let out a dramatic sigh.

“Pretty slow day so far. I’m so bored.”

“How about this,” he continued. “Next big call that comes in, we take it. Hope it’s something risky.”

I gave him a side-eye as he’d just said the dumbest thing imaginable.

“I’d actually like to see the end of today,” I said.

“Come on, not even to help somebody’s grandma or something?”

“No.”

The radio crackled to life. A 10-65. Armed robbery at a gas station a few blocks north. Before I could say anything, Patrick grabbed the receiver and told dispatch we’d take it. I took a deep breath and swallowed, trying to calm myself. The short drive to the gas station was filled with Patrick explaining why this was a good thing. I didn’t respond. We pulled up, exited the vehicle, and drew our weapons. Before we could even reach the building, a slim, almost skeleton-like man burst through the doors holding a knife and a small brown paper bag. Patrick’s joke died in his throat.

“NYPD! Drop the knife!” we both shouted, almost in unison.

The man didn’t speak. He didn’t move. He stood there with his arms wide, knife in one hand, bag in the other, muttering to himself. Sweat poured down his face, eyes wide and wild. He dropped the knife. Then the bag. I holstered my weapon and reached for my cuffs while Patrick continued shouting orders.

“On your stomach! Face down! Palms up! I repeat-”

It took three times before the man seemed to register what was happening. He flinched, then slowly complied. Once he was down, I approached and began patting him down. He was wearing a thin tank top and short shorts. There wasn’t much to check. Then I reached into his pocket. A syringe. There wasn’t a lot of blood, but there was enough on the tip to see it. I dropped it immediately and wiped my hands on my pants, like I could scrub the image out of my head. For the next couple of seconds, I rub my hands on my pants like I’m trying to wipe away my fingerprints. Patrick put his gun away and stepped over, shaking me gently.

“Officer Hendrix, you okay?” That nudge snapped me back.

“Yeah. Yeah. I’m good. Just move.”

I nudged past him, hauled the man to his feet, cuffed him, and escorted him to the vehicle. Patrick went inside to speak with the cashier. She was shaken, but otherwise fine. The smell of alcohol and piss hit him immediately.

“Hello, ma’am. Officer Sullivan. My partner is Officer Hendrix. We’ll be filing the report today. Can you walk me through what happened?”

I came inside afterward and walked to the back of the store. Rows of candy, cereal, and chips. At the back, I found the mess. Beer cans crushed and busted open. And the smell, stronger, more aggressive. I look over to the fridge next to the beer, and what I see is downright nasty. Gallons of milk covered in piss. I turned back toward the front. Patrick was already chatting, lightening the mood.

“I know, right? My girlfriend’s been obsessed with that show. I just haven’t had the energy to watch it. Is it any good?”

“Officer Sullivan,” I said, “is this really the best time?”

“But Love Is Blind-”

“Wrap it up.”

Patrick sighed and finished the paperwork. I headed out of the building.

“What was that for?” Patrick asked as the door to the gas station closed. 

“I think you know why,” I replied 

“No, I really don’t.”

“How about the fact that you’ve been my partner for five fucking minutes and you’ve already got us to pull out our guns on someone. Our first call isn’t even with someone normal. It’s a crackhead high off his mind pissing on milk jugs, and your hair worried about love is blind.” I’m not even truly mad at Patrick. But how can he be so cheerful right now?

“Hey man, I was just trying to lighten the mood. She seemed a little shaken up, so I tried to have a friendly conversation, and it worked. She’s calm now, she’s gonna get that cleaned up, talk with insurance, and we get to take him to the lockup.” Patrick explained.

“OK, OK, you know what, just forget it. We are going to get back in our car and book him, then we are not taking any more risky calls for the day, we got it?” 

“Ok, you got it, booking then no more risk, I got you.” 

Patrick and I get into the car. The suspect in the back is almost catatonic; his eyes are wide and glossed over, but he’s not moving. 

“You are cleaning the smell,” Patrick said as he put on his sunglasses. 

I put it in drive and pulled out of the gas station parking lot. The ride back was almost silent, peaceful. As we drove through the streets of this city I've called home, I got a warm, nostalgic feeling. I see kids playing in the streets. I see parents laughing. I smell fresh pizza and people in suits speedwalking up and down the sidewalks, and people hailing cabs. I love this city. And then it’s all interrupted by Patrick asking me one interesting question.

“Hey, so why'd you become a cop if you don’t like the riskiness of the job?” 

The question caught me so off guard because it was an awkward question to ask. But because this is the first time, I’ve genuinely thought about it. Not that I’ve never thought about the risk of this job. But I mean, I’ve never been asked why I wanted to become a cop. 

“Why do you ask?” I inquired. 

“I mean, I just wanted to ask because you’re just a mystery to me, man. I mean, you don’t like taking risks that come with the job, and that’s just why I’m confused.” 

“You can help people without taking risks.”

“Why can’t you do both? Take risks and help people.” 

“Because the difference is, you’re not taking risks to help people, you're taking it to Showboat.” 

“I have to admit it, he got me there, but my confusion with you goes beyond that. I mean, you can’t even stand blood man. Why would you join a profession where you’re going to see blood regularly?” 

Patrick was really starting to get on my nerves. I have no problem with blood, like he’s trying to say. It’s just that I don't like it. 

“This conversation is over,” I said, trying to put a stop to it.

“Come on, man, you really can’t just tell me you got shut down?” Patrick continues to push my buttons.

At this point, I stopped responding. I didn’t even look in his direction the rest of the car ride to the station. As we pull up to the station, something‘s eerie. Not a scary, spooky feeling, but an off-putting one. And as we make our way inside, we find out why. Inside, at least 15 officers are scattered throughout the room, all with their heads bowed. I’ve seen this before, and it makes me get a ball in my stomach. I hand the guy we arrested off to Patrick so we can take him to booking and walk up to the front desk to ask our secretary what’s going on. As I walk up, I see that her face is beet red and her eyes are watery.

“Hey, what’s going on?” I ask. 

It seems like it takes all of her strength to look up and answer me. 

“It's Henry, oh Henry.” She replied. 

“Henry? Henry Cooks? What happened?” 

As I asked this, she seemed to break down even more. She doesn’t respond to me. She just puts her head down and gently sobs. I can see her shoulder shaking. Our captain comes over and pulls me away from the desk, creating a sizable distance. I lower my voice significantly and get a little bit closer to the captain as I begin to speak.

“What happened, is Henry ok?” 

“Henry never showed up for work this morning. We had a couple of officers go to his house to conduct a welfare check. As they pull up to the house, they see that the front door is basically wide open. They slowly went into the house, of course, in fear of somebody possibly being in there. And my son just believed me, it was not pretty.” 

The captain's words hit me like a freight train. Suddenly, my thoughts are running out 1,000,000 miles an hour, and I’m trying to catch my breath so I can stabilise myself. Even though I did not know Henry well, it hits me so hard that he was home when it happened. What I mean is that people die every day on this job. We’re cops were supposed to die for the betterment of the civilians. But when I heard Henry was off duty in his home when this happened to him. I felt genuine terror. I felt sad. I felt angry. Angry at the person who took Henry from us. Angry that these people thought they had the power to make that decision. Without another word to the captain, I slowly walk away. He tries to stop me, but I put my hand up to make sure he doesn’t. As soon as I walk into the locker room, I get even more overwhelmed. All my senses are being fried all at the moment. The smell of the sweaty walker room, mixed with the thoughts of running a marathon in my mind. I can’t do it. I almost collapse when I manage to adjust and lean against one of the lockers. I feel like I can’t catch my breath, like it’s just out of my reach. I can barely see it; it feels like everything is spinning. The ceiling is the floor. The walls aren’t there. And I can’t figure out how to ground myself. He didn’t deserve that. I look up, and in the doorway of the locker room, I see someone familiar. He’s younger than the last time I saw him. He walks up to me, puts his hand on my shoulder, and that’s when I snap out of it. Suddenly, it’s not this man, it's Patrick. He’s not smiling. He’s not joking. He has tears in his eyes, too. He’s being gentle. He soothes me. With Patrick Santana on my shoulder, I’m finally able to ground myself in reality. My thoughts have slowed down to a brisk jog, but I’m still sweating profusely. My mother would always tell me that she had three words to describe my father. Tough, resilient, driven. I like to think that I am even half the man he was. But I know I’d never come close. No matter how long I wear this uniform. I’ll never be the man he was. No matter how much I would love to properly process the emotions I’m feeling and to grieve with everybody else in this station. A job still must be done, and we are the ones trusted to do it. Patrick is standing there, concerned, trying to speak to me and comfort me, but I don’t register him. I straighten up my uniform. I wipe my eyes. I wipe my forehead. And I’m already pushing past Patrick to walk back into the main lobby. As I’m walking out, I make sure to offer my condolences to every officer, whether they were friends with Henry or not. I know this will hit them hard. As we get into the car, the last thing Patrick says finally registers in my mind.

“It’s so fucked, man. He doesn't deserve that man. He and I were in the academy together. He was as funny and smart as a bag of rocks, but that’s his charm. It’s all fucked.” Patrick isn’t crying anymore; he just has his usual energetic cheerfulness. He’s just kind of dry. And I don’t blame him. 

The next couple of hours go by like a blur. Neither Patrick nor I speaks at all. I made a left onto a one-way road when I noticed the car in front of me swerving and almost hitting the parked car on the side of the road. Patrick knows what this means, so Patrick goes ahead and flips on the lights. The sirens' sound startled me at first. It was the loudest noise I’ve heard in hours. It was familiar but unsettling. The car finally pulls over. It’s a simple gray SUV. Just as I’m about to exit the vehicle, Patrick speaks.

“He had a kid, man.” 

That one sentence hurt more than anything else. A child growing up without a father, purely because of the violent acts of another person. I don’t wish that fate on anyone. I put my hand on Patrick's shoulder, just making sure I’m there for him this moment, before I finally speak up.

“I know, I know. Come on, let’s deal with this guy so we can be on our way.” My voice is so quiet, almost a whisper. 

Patrick slowly gets out of the car, and I follow suit. We are both walking up to the car on opposite ends. I’m on the driver's side while Patrick is in the passenger seat. By the time I walked up to the driver's side door, the windows had already rolled down. It’s a young man no older than 22. Just by looking at his face, I could tell he was out of his mind. His eyes were completely glossed over, and he was almost cross-eyed. Smiling that dumb goofy smile that people get. 

“Sir, I saw you swerving a little bit back there. Are you under the influence this evening?” I make my voice deep and stern. 

The man replies after a couple of seconds, but very slowly and slurredly. 

“I’m doing a-okay.” It feels like it takes him an eternity to blink. 

It’s so obvious he’s high out of his mind, and he’s still denying it. It’s almost funny. 

“Boss, I see something in the backseat. Looks like an open baggie.” Patrick says from the other side of the car. 

I lean down to the window, right up next to the kid, and begin talking to him. 

“Do you know how many people die from people like you every day? The people who don’t care about others. You’re driving through this neighborhood high out of your mind, and you only care about saving face. Get out of the car now.” 

This is a perfect example of what I don’t like in a person. This young man, with his whole life ahead of him, puts not only himself at risk but also everybody around him. And what’s so perfect about this is that he doesn’t care in the slightest. The drugs are out in the open. He doesn't try to hide the stench of weed on his breath. People who walk the city without a care for others, that’s the type of people I hate. I suppose Patrick saw something in my eyes because as soon as the man got out of the vehicle, he came around and patted me on the shoulder. 

“Why don’t you let me handle this boss, you get his wallet from his pocket and go to the car to run a background check. Please?” I’m not used to this, Patrick. There was no sarcasm or hint of joking in his demeanor. 

I reached into the man’s pocket and pulled out his wallet before walking back to the car. I need to calm down. I finally got into the vehicle and began typing the man’s information into the laptop. Nothing on his profile. Not even a ticket. Clean. I stepped back out of the car and walked up to him as I began speaking.

“Alright, Mr. Spencer. Here’s what’s going to happen today. You were driving under the influence, so we’re going to have to take you into custody. Your vehicle will be towed, and you’ll be issued a ticket. You’ll be released on your own recognizance once you’ve sobered up, or you can have someone pick you up from the station.”

I gestured toward Patrick. “Officer Sullivan will get you settled in the back.”

As Patrick started walking him toward the car, I held down the button on my radio and requested a tow truck for the vehicle. After Patrick closed the back door, he started to move around to the other side of the car, but I stepped up beside him.

“Hey, man,” I said quietly. “I just wanna say thanks. For stepping it back there.”

“Don’t mention it,” Patrick said. “That’s what partners are for, right?”

He tried to tap into his usual humor, but his smile didn’t quite reach his eyes. The remainder of our day was pretty uneventful. At the end of our shift, I’m heading into the locker room with Patrick. 

“Hey man, would you wanna maybe go get some drinks, you know, maybe a toaster, Henry?” Patrick asks in a more shy tone than usual. 

“Sorry, I don’t drink. Plus, I got a ton of stuff I gotta do.” I replied. 

“Oh ok it’s all good,” Patrick says as he begins, putting on his uniform.

By the time I get home, it is 7 PM. I parked my car in my driveway, and I walked up to my front door. My street is almost entirely silent, except for the hum of the street lights. I open up my front door, and inside it’s dark and empty. I’ve lived alone for years, yet it still hits me like a train every time I come home. If I can even call this home. I don’t have a home anymore. Not for a while. I decided to go to bed early. I get a glass of water and two sleeping pills, and I take them at my kitchen sink. I have the sleeping pills in my mouth, sliding them around with my tongue before I raise the glass of water. To Henry, I thought to myself before I finally swallowed the water. I make my way to my room, where I lie down on my already-made bed. It’s slightly cold from my silk sheets.",1,1769393128.0,writers,1,0.99,False

I didn't even noticed I'd written 1,065 words for I'm Still Sisyphus until I stopped for dinner and went to tally it all up. And it is laundry day! I usually struggle to get even a hundred words written on a laundry day. The new machines are working smoothly and so I took the opportunity to go upstairs to write and I am very happy for it. I continue to be awfully pleased with myself with the persistent feeling that I am still not quite going to reach my January deadline. There is just so much more story to tell. I was playing it all out in my head last night and I'd say I have at least ten more scenes of varying length left to go and I am sure now that I am going to include an epilogue. That is a lot to squeeze into six more days. Yet instead of feeling despondent I only want to try for it harder. I write a little bit last night, not enough to count but a few few words, and I am tempted to do the same now. Before I even have my evening coffee. It helps vastly that I am really enjoying this section of the story. The stop and start between some scenes are going to be a bit more blurry from here on out. I am enjoying weaving all the loose threads together. 

I should also tell you that I used my Dremel for the first time last night to sand some of the epoxy off. It took me an embarrassingly long time time to get it working but it worked well on the glue. I'll go at it again soon because the epoxy is thick but I am hoping with some proper Elmer's glue it should be just fine. It is a time-consuming and stupid lesson but we all learn ones like it once in a while. In this case I have internalized the ancient wisdom; do not bind books with epoxy glue.

I don't have much else to tell you. I went to sleep at a reasonable time so I had the forethought to not give too much of my mind and emotions over to the news cycle. I am as informed as my fragile mental health can handle at the moment. When I have the energy, I try to seek out equal amounts of good news as there is bed and it helps, I think. A biotech company in the Netherlands have recently announced an experimental gene therapy to treat Huntington's disease, isn't that amazing? I have no experience with the condition myself but I have heard how soul crushing it is for sufferings and their loved ones, most especially because there was no treatment beyond mitigating pain as much as possible until the patient passes. This could improve the quality of life for so many people. I'm going to hold on to that thought in my darkest moments and try to be grateful.

Now, I am going to relax for a while. I made some notes in my notes app about an upcoming scene in my book that I am really looking forward to. Diomedes of Argos is one of my favourite greek heroes and though he makes no direct appearance in I'm Still Sisyphus, I am looking forward to getting to mention him. I'll probably resume working on those notes while I have my evening coffee.

For years, my workflow was a high friction loop of 10 hour days:

\-Finding trending hooks

\-Manual editing in CapCut

\-Thinking about titles and descriptions

\-Managing multiple accounts and posting on them. 

I was hitting a ceiling. I couldn’t scale because I was the bottleneck.



**Building an Autonomous Content Engine** 

I decided to stop being a creator and started being a systems architect. 

I spent a month  building a fully automated AI workflow.



**The Stack (High Level):**

**-Generation:** AI-driven scripts that handle 100% of the creative (Visuals + Audio).

**-Face/Faceless Hybrid:** Half the accounts are fully faceless, and half use my face/clients faces using AI sync/cloning tech.

**-Logic:** The system scans for high-performing trends, generates catchy titles, and monitors issues automatically.

**-The ""Check-in"":** My only daily task is a **20** **minute coffee session** where I check the analytics dashboard and tweak the high-performers.



**The Results (Past 28 Days):** The numbers are honestly scary when you stop relying on human speed:

* **Total Views (on All Accounts):** \~500 M
* **IG (Best Account):** 130 M views
* **YT (Best Account):** 65 M views
* **TT (Best Account):** 80 M views



**3 Key Lessons for Growth Hackers in 2026:**

1. **Quantity leads to Quality:** By posting at a volume no human can match, the algorithm has ""more bites at the apple."" The AI learns which hooks work and doubles down on them.
2. **The ""Faceless"" Scale:** Faceless accounts are the ultimate leverage. They don't get tired, and you can launch 5 of them in the time it takes to record 1 video of yourself.
3. **Monitoring > Creation:** Spend your time on the *infrastructure*. If your automation is solid, you aren't a creator anymore, you're something like a portfolio manager.

1qn2udq,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1qn2udq/recipe_for_grey_soul_strawberry_in_a_loop_using/,Recipe for Grey soul strawberry in a loop using Moka pot,"I had been looking on this sub for a good Strawberry in a Loop recipe using a Moka pot, but couldn’t find one. So I ordered a pack and have been experimenting with it.

Coffee beans: Grey Soul Strawberry in a Loop

Milk: Nandini Good Life

Resting period: 15 days since the roast date printed on the pack

Moka pot: 3-cup size

Grind size: I used grind size 7 on a Budan coffee grinder, which isn’t the standard on this sub, but it’s very slightly finer than a typical Moka pot grind.

Add 120 ml of room-temperature water (yes, room-temperature—don’t add hot water, or you’ll never find the taste notes) to the bottom chamber. Add the ground coffee to the filter basket and gently tap it to level the surface. Place an AeroPress filter on the bottom of the upper chamber.

Assemble the Moka pot and place it on the gas stove. Use a heating plate or a roasting mesh (the kind you find on Amazon) to keep it stable. Keep the heat on medium-low. Once the coffee starts flowing, keep an eye on it. If the flow increases suddenly, switch off the gas and let it continue brewing. As soon as it starts sputtering, run the Moka pot under cold water.

Heat the milk and froth it (I used a NanoFoamer, but any frother will do). Add the milk to the coffee and enjoy. I feel that frothed milk helps balance the cup and brings out the flavours.

Let me know your thoughts if you’ve experimented with this specific roast, and if you think any improvements can be made. I still have about 10 cups’ worth of beans left to experiment with.",1,1769393001.0,IndiaCoffee,1,1.0,False

https://preview.redd.it/3njx5yu2plfg1.jpg?width=1376&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2a8c25cdb68a3cc20d395fe4cc552bff14eeafa9

Most AI assistants just chat. **ClawdBot** *works*. While you sleep, it audits your site, rewrites copy, tracks conversions, and ships improvements. No UI. No dashboards. Just text it like a coworker.

I'll show you how to set this up in 30 minutes and give you the exact marketing skills that turn it into your growth engine.

**The Problem With Marketing AI Tools**

You've tried them all:

* ChatGPT for copy (but you copy-paste everything manually)
* Ahrefs for SEO (staring at dashboards)
* Analytics platforms (checking metrics obsessively)

The friction kills momentum. By the time you analyze → decide → execute, the opportunity is gone.



**What If Your AI Could Just... Do It?**

Enter ClawdBot. An open-source AI assistant that:

* Lives in Telegram/WhatsApp (already on your phone)
* Runs on a $5 VPS (DigitalOcean droplet)
* Has full system access (executes commands, runs scripts)
* Never forgets context (persistent memory)
* Works autonomously (scheduled tasks, proactive alerts)

***Real example from my workflow:***

Me: ""Audit [citedy.com](http://citedy.com) for SEO issues""

\[2 minutes later\]

*ClawdBot: ""Found 12 issues:*

*- Missing H1 on /pricing*

*- 3 broken internal links*

*- Meta descriptions too short on 5 pages*

*- Core Web Vitals: LCP needs work*

*Want me to generate fixes?""*



No context switching. No logging into tools. Just results.



**Setup: 30 Minutes to Your Marketing AI**

**Part 1: The $5 VPS (DigitalOcean)**

**Why DigitalOcean?**

* Cheapest reliable option ($4-6/month)
* Works perfectly for ClawdBot
* Where I host all my projects anyway
* Clean Ubuntu setup

**Step 1: Create Droplet**

\# DigitalOcean Dashboard → Create Droplet

\- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS

\- Basic plan: $6/month (1GB RAM)

\- Choose region closest to you

\- Add SSH key (or use password)

**Step 2: Initial Server Setup**

\# SSH into your droplet

ssh root@YOUR\_DROPLET\_IP



\# Update system

apt update && apt upgrade -y



\# Create non-root user

adduser clawdbot

usermod -aG sudo clawdbot

su - clawdbot



**Step 3: Install Dependencies**

\# Node.js 24.x

curl -fsSL [https://deb.nodesource.com/setup\_24.x](https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_24.x) | sudo -E bash -

sudo apt install -y nodejs



\# Verify

node --version  # Should be v24.x.x



\# Install pnpm

sudo npm install -g pnpm



\# Install Homebrew (needed for some skills)

/bin/bash -c ""$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)""

echo 'export PATH=""/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin:$PATH""' >> \~/.bashrc

source \~/.bashrc



**Part 2: Install ClawdBot**

\# One-line installer

curl -fsSL [https://clawd.bot/install.sh](https://clawd.bot/install.sh) | bash



\# Run setup wizard

clawdbot onboard --install-daemon



**The wizard will ask:**

1. **Workspace location**: /home/clawdbot/clawd (default)
2. **AI Model**: Choose Claude Sonnet 4.5 (best for marketing tasks)
3. **API Key**: Get from [https://console.anthropic.com/](https://console.anthropic.com/)
4. **Messaging app**: Telegram (easiest)



**Get Telegram Bot Token:**

1. Open Telegram

2. Message u/BotFather

3. Type: /newbot

4. Name: ""MyMarketingBot""

5. Username: ""mymarketingbot\_123"" (must end in ""bot"")

6. Copy the token BotFather gives you

7. Paste into ClawdBot wizard



**Verify it's running:**

clawdbot status

\# Should show: ✅ Gateway running

Text your bot in Telegram: ""Hello""

If it responds, you're live. 🎉



**Part 3: Add Marketing Superpowers**

This is where it gets interesting. ClawdBot uses ""skills"" — packages that teach it specific capabilities.



**Essential Marketing Skills:**

**1. SEO Audit Skill**

npx skills add [https://github.com/coreyhaines31/marketingskills](https://github.com/coreyhaines31/marketingskills) \--skill seo-audit

**What it does:**

* Crawls your site
* Finds technical SEO issues
* Checks meta tags, headers, schema
* Identifies broken links

*CRITICAL:*

*- Homepage missing H1 tag*

*- 404 error on /blog/old-post*

*HIGH:*

*- 3 pages missing meta descriptions*

*- Image alt tags missing (12 images)*

*MEDIUM:*

*- Internal linking could be improved*

*- Schema markup missing*

*Want me to generate fixes?""*



**2. GEO Fundamentals**

**What it does:**

* Tracks keyword rankings by location
* Monitors local search visibility
* Analyzes competitor geo-targeting
* Suggests local SEO improvements

**Example:**

ClawdBot:

*""Rankings for 'AI content platform':*

*- US: Position 23 (Google)*

*- EU: Position 45 (Google)*

*- UK: Position 31 (Google)*

*Opportunity: US ranking improved 5 positions last week.*

*Suggest: Create US-focused content to capitalize.""*



**3. Copywriting**

*- CompetitorB: 'Content That Ranks, Written by AI'*



*Analysis:*

*- CompetitorA: Specific outcome (1000s, Minutes)*

*- CompetitorB: Clear value (Ranks)*



*Suggested rewrites:*

*1. 'Generate 100 SEO Articles for $20 — Not $2000'*

*2. '100 AI Models, 1 Platform, $0.20 per Article'*

*3. 'Content Automation That Costs Less Than Coffee'*

*Test these with your audience.""*

shuffles paperwork  
puff of tobacco-smoke in the air  
drawing sigils with keystrokes  
and with that  
taptaptaptaptapclick  
a scream, from somewhere cold and remote.  
Snap of an umbilical cord.  
A blown network of three;  
three lives gone,  
three runes wiped from his incantation.  
The quiet man glances at the picture from another angle, smoke in his eyes.

The name of a thing is power.   
Life extinguished  
in a single utterance  
in a muttered identification   
in a sheaf of paperwork spilling from a folder.

The quiet man’s hands sketch   
arcane patterns over the keyboard.  
His face is spiderwebbed, lined with deep furrows like the corkboard maps of byzantine plans.  
He speaks in a raspy whisper  
just beneath what the ear can catch,  
weary,  
in little exhalations  
like he never breathes in.

*a thread twitches:*  
*in a windswept demilitarized zone*  
*a shot rings out—*   
*burst of crimson*  
*in shadow,*  
*a man plummets to his knees*   
*snowfall slipping between his fingers*   
*fine as ashes*

You ask the quiet man to repeat himself  
He nods imperceptibly  
you know whatever he murmurs now is different than what he murmured before  
is that the ghost of a smile on his old worrylined lips?  
But you were told this quiet man never smiles.

Ostensibly your countryman  
but your entire career is not to trust anyone—   
He’d be the first to tell you you were doing the right thing thinking that,  
that ghost of a smile, that unsmile,  
laughing eyes dancing behind the cigarette-smoke that could be concealing—   
He types again.

You wonder how many die at that keystroke,  
who’s getting blackbagged dragged into the torture chamber fingernails pulled out teeth broken  
because of that—   
tap.

*a line jerks:*  
*in a bustling tavern*  
*a man was just approached by the*   
*most beautiful woman*   
*he’d ever seen—*  
*he takes a sip of the*   
*last beer*   
*he’ll ever drink,*  
*shrugs at the aftertaste*

Silence fills your ears  
soundproofing panels labyrinthine on the walls.  
When he looks at you it’s like he’s looking at you from a thousand places at once from every crevice in those  
canyon-filled walls  
from every curl of that  
light-lined tobacco-smoke twirling  
like his specters:  
His agents  
that move through agents  
moving through agents  
moving through agents  
He clears his throat—  
loudest noise he’s made today.  
Adjusts his tie.

*strings are pulled:*  
*in a St. Petersburg metro*  
*they say the woman*   
*typist at some government office*  
*whose gummed-up corpse held up the trains*   
*lived alone*  
*was in the station*   
*alone*  
*the detective sighs in relief—*  
*an open-and-shut case*

The name of a thing is power.  
He knows your name  
shuffles papers, rattles out another pattern, lights another smoke  
He knows everyone’s name  
alchemical equations dancing in his eyes, ley-lines spreading to each continent  
you think he told you what his name is.  
shadows lengthen between the panels like the spirits he’s called are surfacing.  
But did he?

The quiet man changes the format of a spreadsheet and   
somewhere in Siberia a janitor is garrotted, burnt, scattered in the woods, family left to starve.   
as his secretary comes in  
with the steaming hot coffee  
you didn’t even realize he had murmurously offered you  
You squint at   
*what might be*  
His smile  
as you lift the mug to your lips

As my body breached the dark, sleeping surface of the water, the first thing that struck me was the cold. Bone-chilling, brain-freezing temperatures encased me as I sank, bubbles of white, blue, and rainbow light glimmering around me. My cry was swallowed instantly by the all-encompassing void, the presumed tomb of my descent. Limbs flailed against the current that threatened to drag me under, the only break in the water’s cruel silence a loud splash following my futile resistance.

Eyes squeezed shut, my small puffy jacket clinging to me like Velcro, I cursed my lack of a life jacket. A stinging cold rushed into my lungs as I drew the first shuddering breath of the strength-sapping atmosphere. Panic fully set in when something warm brushed against one of my tiny arms. Struggling violently, I lashed out, but the invader clung to me with unnatural strength. I clawed at it until my face broke the icy surface. Blinking away water and ice from my lashes, my eyes locked onto my mother’s pearlescent orbs.

With every ounce of strength he could muster, my father heaved the full weight of my mother and me from the lake. We landed in a heap atop him, our soaked bodies shivering violently in the cold. My mother began compressions on my younger self, while my father fought the stubborn engine of the fishing boat. Distance to the shore was short, but it felt like an eternity before we ran aground and huddled together inside the warm cabin.

My grandmother was startled when we burst through the door, quickly taking my little brother from my grandfather as he moved to help. Blankets and towels were produced and wrapped around us within minutes, hands working to restore warmth and feeling to our numb extremities. My father and grandfather stepped onto the porch, voices raised in heated conversation over a fresh pot of coffee, while my grandmother heated apple cider for us to nurse. Just as I was handed a cup, hands still shaking, the men’s voices outside flared further, ending with my grandfather slamming the door open and storming to the back of the house.

\*\*\*

I must have hit my head during the jump; the throbbing pain was a dull but insistent reminder that I was alive. My eyelids eased apart to a second realization: my hands and arms were coated in the familiar viscous substance I had fought through in the subterranean chamber. Wiping it away cleared my vision somewhat, and I stripped my outer layer of clothing to clean the rest from my face and body.

Finally surveying my poorly lit surroundings, I saw a semicircle of yellowed mounds at the edges of my vision. Stepping closer, I found solid ground and pulled myself from the small pool where I had awoken. My foot struck something solid—my flashlight. Free from the bag and soaking wet, I gave it a few solid thwacks; after the fourth or fifth swing, it flickered to life. Thank God for DeWalt.

The giddiness of the recovered tool caught in my throat as I moved closer. The small hills I had been creeping toward revealed themselves in full horror: piles of bones, animals of all kinds, scattered and decayed. Worse, human remains were dotted among them, larger pieces mostly intact, smaller bits shattered and mixed with the earth. At the base of each pile lay a puddle of the same viscous goop that still clung to me, cracked green fragments scattered throughout the cavern.

As my breathing slowed, I waded back to the water, scanning for anything else washed ashore. The only sounds were dripping water and my cautious footsteps. I found my small shovel and a floating water bottle. Sipping cautiously, I reassessed my equipment and considered my next move: to find another way out without swimming again. This meant approaching the rotting piles, so I wrapped a shred of my shirt around my lower face to mask the stench.

Moving slowly in a circle around the grotesque mounds, I found no change in the terrain. A faint sense of calm settled over me before I returned to where I had begun scoping the area. Walls and ceiling yielded no escape routes. Steeling myself, I began sorting through the nearest pile. The bones were picked clean, yet as I sifted, a slow, rhythmic clattering began to echo through the chamber. At the base, viscera coated with the cavern’s hardened substance revealed jagged green-glass fragments jutting outward, glinting ominously in my flashlight’s beam.

As the sound of my rummaging escalated, I found a few discarded odds and ends scattered among the refuse. Mostly scraps of fabric and tattered bundles of fur, but enough to scrounge together a mostly intact shirt. Moving from my initially sorted pile to the next, a brief moment of stillness fell—at least from me. The slow clattering continued, unbroken, though now unaccompanied by my own movements. I froze, staring at the bones, shivering as a new presence stirred, threatening to burst free. Backing toward the water, my eyes locked on the motion, I heard a high-pitched whir pitch through my hearing aids, shrill and tight, almost like a dog whistle.

From within the bones, pale wriggling forms emerged, crawling free from their calcium-covered enclosures. They moved like caterpillars, dozens of them streaming from the exact spot I had just knelt. As each wave surfaced, the chorus of the room swelled, heads pointing upward as if in prayer. In the refracted light from the water, I saw their gaping maws lined with minute, razor-sharp teeth. My horror only deepened as I noticed similar activity across the rest of the decayed refuse. Each mass shuddered, collapsed, and was overtaken by dozens more of the crawling, shrieking creatures.

I dropped to my knees, clawing at the sides of my face, fighting every urge to rip my malfunctioning hearing aids free. Instead, I gripped my flashlight and shovel, backing away slowly. A sudden splash shattered my concentration. I whipped my head toward the noise and saw the familiar mass of aquatic life thrashing in the frothing pond. Stunned, I halted, focusing instead on the chaos surrounding me. The creatures’ soprano of shrieks ceased, the room falling into eerie, expectant silence.

After several breaths, a dragging sound began, steadily approaching. I clicked off my flashlight, crouching in a futile attempt to hide. When my knees hit the ground, a form was dragged and deposited atop the writhing invertebrates from above. I flinched at the thud of flesh hitting stone, bracing before flicking my flashlight on. The sparse battery revealed a sight that made my stomach twist: the crippled form of my father.

Huddled together, missing one leg of his work jeans, he appeared battered but not entirely destroyed. Most of his figure was stuck with the same green spheres I had seen clinging to Mr. Carlton. I inched closer cautiously, my foot striking a shard with a delicate tinkle—green glass.

The realization hit like a train: I had to move. All stealth abandoned, I rushed to my father’s side, checking his pulse like health class had taught me. A slow, steady beat confirmed he was alive. Carefully, I shredded the bits of uniform fused to the sickly pearls, freeing him. The creatures remained rigid, unblinking, almost statuesque. Only a single tumor-like growth on his right leg remained, his clothing otherwise intact. I heaved his body to the side of the cave. As one lone bone fell to the floor, the silence shattered.

Every malformed, limbless worm ceased its unholy prayers, fixating on the single fallen bone. I slowed, crawling with my father beside me, trying not to alert them further. When another worm caused a small avalanche of calcium dust, the creatures darted en masse to the deluge, intertwining and feeding on whatever they could claim. Heart hammering, I grabbed a piece of what looked like a femur and tossed it toward the water amidst the feeding mass.

I’d never been good at sports with a ball, but luck favored me in this instance. The bone landed just short of the water, barely touching the waves that lapped against the writhing bodies below. It skidded to a stop with a faint ripple and splash. The ground-based worms hesitated, consulting the validity of this new stimulus, before surging en masse, roiling and writhing toward the sound. Those unlucky enough to land in the water were immediately snatched and fought over by the gluttonous horrors below.

Seeing the first flicker of hope—or maybe just feeling bold enough to act—I rose carefully, bracing myself against the wall while gripping the shovel still strapped to my ragged leather belt. Shifting my weight from heels to balls of my feet, I edged closer to the writhing mass. Standing at arms-length, I eased the shovel free, eliciting a metallic “-dink” as it clashed against my belt buckle. The mass paused briefly, then continued, undeterred by my warning.

I loosed the tool fully, cocked my shoulders back, bent my knees, and swung with everything I had. The blade met solid flesh with a wet, sloshing sound. Many of the creatures were damaged on impact, but survivors careened lopsidedly toward the far wall. The volley of veinless forms collided with solid rock, spewing fragments in a small radius before collapsing into the water below. Murky, dull purple fluid coated the wall and my shovel. For a brief moment, I reveled in the effectiveness of my actions.

While the marine creatures feasted on the unexpected buffet, I moved a few feet from the remaining writhing reptiles. I stabbed downward, dispatching the last of the litter with calculated precision. As the flurry of motion in the pool waned, the tension in my body drained along with the adrenaline. Crawling slowly toward the wall where my father lay, I curled up in the elbow of a few stones beside him, finally falling into the deepest sleep I’d had in what felt like an eternity.

The dulcet tones of southern rock roused me from sleep as I rubbed the night’s weariness from my eyes. Four a.m. had come again, way too soon for comfort. Knowing I couldn’t afford yet another sick day, I threw on my flannel and jeans, forced down a couple quick bowls of green heaven, and headed out to my baby.

She was only a couple years old—the best off-road pickup truck I was still paying a solid chunk of my paycheck toward—but she was my pride and joy nonetheless.

I sped down the interstate in the chilly fall dark, texting my boss that I’d be a wee bit late for the fourth time that week. Having the owner be your dad does wonders—as long as you don’t fuck it up—but I digress. I peeled into the lot of the small five-company complex, slid into a parking spot, and started gathering my necessities for the day.

Full water? Check.  
 Testicles, spectacles, wallet and watch? Check.  
 Half-full portable battery? …Check, I guess.

Passing through the glass doors, I was halted almost immediately by my Pa and the other two employees, already seated with tablets open to the day’s schedule. I caught a mild bit of shit as I took my seat and pulled up the app myself. Trapping duty again. Not that I was complaining.

Eight hours of driving around with podcasts and critters for company made for an easy weekday—beats the hell out of digging trenches or climbing rooftops. Just as I started to filter out at the tail end of the herd like usual, a new inspection popped up. A woman named Lois Carlton, way out in the middle of the valley.

My Pa spun his monitor around and walked me through the satellite view. The property sprawled across hectares, with a small fenced section enclosing a mansion that looked dropped out of place against the surrounding rock and scrub. Definitely an affluent customer. Hopefully a large commission.

He tacked it onto the back of my list and reminded me to sell her hard on preventative measures—coyotes were her primary concern. I assured him I was ready to spiel, loaded traps of various sizes into the truck, and set out for what I assumed would be an uneventful Tuesday.

It’s the monotony that gets to you, driving around day in and day out. Customers blur together job by job until you’re left wondering where the day went while gearing up for the next one. That’s just how most labor is. Sales, service, supervision—it all hits a cognitive ceiling after a while.

Routine is what dulls memory. When every job runs off the same pre-generated responses, there’s nothing for the brain to grab onto. Either I meet the homeowner, ask where the animals are getting in and what they’re tearing up, or—more often than not—the details are already submitted online and I let myself into the backyard, set traps, and take pictures.

That’s why the jobs that break routine stick so hard.

The eleven-foot ball python in a dryer vent.  
 The fully tattooed geriatric woman who chased me out of her house after forgetting she hired us.

Stories only become infodumps if they earn it. So when I tell you *this* job stood out, I mean it.

The “she” in question was an older woman named Lois Carlton—at least, that’s how she introduced herself. I’d been warned the property was remote and expansive, but I still wasn’t prepared for what greeted me when I pulled up.

The house was a multi-layer monstrosity. Four-car garage, minimum. Landscapers had clearly been through recently; succulents and hedges were trimmed and vibrant despite the surrounding rock and bramble that climbed the valley walls on all sides. A water feature crowned the center of the circular drive, its surface catching the early light like polished glass.

An oasis, carved straight into hostile terrain.

As impressive as it was, what really caught me off guard was seeing someone already waiting at the entryway.

I took note of the bright white iron-and-vinyl fencing around the property and mentally refreshed my per-foot pricing, already prepping my pitch for perimeter treatments. But the moment I stepped out of the truck, my train of thought derailed.

The first thing I noticed was the smell—fresh, floral, almost overpoweringly clean. Then a sharp pain lanced through my temple, sudden enough to make me pause. Beneath it all, threading through the ambient noise, was a steady drone.

Not quite mechanical.  
Not quite natural.

It reminded me of a distant machine, or the combined chorus of thousands of cicadas—but it was too uniform, too far away to pinpoint a source. No matter how I tilted my head, I couldn’t place it.

I pulled on my gloves and approached who I assumed was the head of the household. And when I finally looked up at her, every thought of upsells, pricing, and mild professional annoyance vanished.

She stood a good half a head shorter than me. Her short, pale-brown hair was pulled tight into a bun perched neatly at the crown of her head. Freckles traced down her pale neck before disappearing beneath a dark green tank top—one that did a poor job of hiding the pronounced bump she held her forearms over, as if sheer pressure might somehow conceal it.

When my gaze finally returned to her face, I caught the reason she’d been watching me so closely. Her stare was sharp and unwavering, the muddied amber of her eyes catching the light in a way that felt almost deliberate. I hesitated, suddenly aware of my shoulder-length mess of dark brown hair and hoping I’d brushed it *enough* this morning.

I extended a gloved hand awkwardly, turning my hearing aids up a notch as I introduced myself.  
 “Good afternoon there, ma’am. Name’s Brady. I hear you got a problem we might be able to help with?”

I hefted my tablet in my other hand, my body lagging a half-second behind my brain. The delay earned a slight crack in her stoic façade—a quick, almost amused grin—before her expression settled back into something unreadable.

The interaction barely had time to begin before she turned on her heel and headed for the doorway, wordlessly leading me inside.

The house opened up into marble-vaulted ceilings and dramatic light fixtures that seemed built more for form than function. Hand-wrought iron and steel twisted into ornate shapes overhead, casting soft, uneven shadows across the walls. Mounted above doorways and mantels was a veritable menagerie of trophy heads—elk and bighorn sheep you’d expect from someone with money for tags and guides, but also smaller game: squirrels, raccoons, things most folks wouldn’t bother preserving.

Each mount bore a small placard. Species. Weight. Date of kill.  
 Neat. Clinical.

While Mrs. Carlton gathered her kids’ toys away from the panoramic glass doors leading to the backyard, I busied myself cataloging the décor like a museum docent with a clipboard. Above the fireplace hung a family crest—blue, green, and silver woven into intricate, vaguely Celtic patterns. It made a striking backdrop for the crossed display beneath it: a wood-stock shotgun and an engraved cavalry sword, draped over a folded flag.

I skirted the edges of a shaggy pale-blue rug, careful not to track dirt onto the spotless fabric. Framed certificates and achievements lined the cream-colored walls. Some bore the name *Lois Atwell*—her maiden name, I assumed. Others belonged to Jeremy *Carlton*.

Hers were academic. A doctorate in internal medicine. Commendations. Honors.  
His medals were badges. Unit insignias. Physical proof of multiple deployments to the Middle East.

Photographs filled the gaps between frames. An affluent family smiled back at me from frozen moments in time. The man—Jeremy, presumably—was tall, broad-shouldered, with tangled blond hair and fair skin. He looked every bit the part of a man’s man, judging by the way he held himself in the pictures.

Trying to make small talk, I gestured toward a photo of him in full dress uniform, cradling what looked like their toddler in one arm and a small puppy in the other.

“What branch of the military is your husband in?”

I didn’t think twice about the question. My attention was still on the photos as I walked—until I nearly collided with her.

She’d stopped dead in front of me, a stuffed bear clutched in one hand. Her face twisted into confusion, then something sharper. Almost anger. It lingered just long enough to make my stomach tighten before her brows relaxed and a calm smile took its place, as though the moment had never happened.

“I’m not sure what you mean,” she said evenly. “I don’t have a husband that I’m aware of. Pests ruining my backyard and flowerbeds, on the other hand…”

She let the sentence trail off and gestured toward the sliding door. I followed, stepping carefully through the now toy-free threshold.

Okay. Maybe not such a happy family after all.  
 But that wasn’t my circus, and those weren’t my monkeys.

I passed the toddler quietly stacking Nerf guns into a bin, deliberately avoiding the photos that seemed to watch us as we left the safety of the pristine interior.

Outside, the yard stretched wider than my apartment and parking lot combined. I slowed despite myself, taking in the sheer scale of it all. We walked beneath archways thick with vining flowers—Wandering Dude, tinged with faint purple—while stone centerpieces rose around us in careful symmetry.

Deep green topiaries twisted and entwined with the sculptures, foliage and masonry married so seamlessly it was hard to tell where one ended and the other began. Each figure wore an expression frozen in misfortune or mischief, posed mid-action with weapons grown straight from living branches: a harp, an axe, a spear.

Despite their differences, every sculpture shared the same unsettling feature.

Slack-jawed mouths, stretched impossibly wide—unhinged, inhuman—caught forever between a scream and a laugh.

Mrs. Carlton led me briskly along the fence line, passing multiple hand-built play structures and an empty—though sizable—livestock pen beside a chicken coop. The hens inside clucked and chattered, stirred into excitement by our presence and the faint promise of food or freedom.

We continued along a well-worn dirt path at the edge of the property, walking until the house shrank to the size of my thumb in the distance. Only then did her pace finally slow.

We stopped at what I could only assume had once been a tractor crash site.

The fence had been torn apart—not bent or cracked, but *ripped*. Made of solid, inch-thick hollow plastic, the panels were shredded ten feet across in multiple directions. White, jagged edges curled outward like snapped bone, framing a hole wide enough for three grown men to walk through side by side. Whatever had hit it hadn’t forced its way in—it had *gone through*.

She glanced at the damage, then at me, her voice tight with something close to nerves.

“What do you think could have caused this? I know we’ve seen coyotes, but… I don’t know. I don’t know why they’d break the fence when they could’ve just gone through the woods. It couldn’t have been a bear or something, could it?”

I tilted my head back to look at her, having crouched to inspect the debris. I picked up a shard of plastic and turned it in the last of the late-day sun, squinting. The surface was slick—coated in a drying, translucent substance that clung like snot, both in color and texture.

I lifted my sunglasses and chose my words carefully. No sense alarming a high-paying customer.

“We don’t get many bears around here,” I said. “Maybe up in the mountains an hour out, but seeing one down here would be a first. Especially given the way this fence was damaged. Do you have any pets you let out regularly? Or security cameras that might’ve caught something?”

She shook her head quickly, then hesitated—corrected herself with a small nod.

“We have an older pit mix with a digging habit, and a doorbell camera in the back to watch her and the kids’ bikes. But we always supervise her when she’s out. We’ve had to lately—especially at night—with all the animals going after the hens.”

I stepped through the breach to the wilderness side of the fence. Fresh mud stretched away from the opening in uneven streaks, pressed deep into the soil. I crouched again, using another piece of shattered plastic to part the grass—

—and felt my blood go cold.

I let the fragment drop and steadied my breathing before standing again.

“Have you lost any of your flock so far?”

I stepped back into the yard, only then fully registering that every section of plastic had been bent *outward*, peeled away from its supports. The metal posts still stood—slightly crooked now—wrenched loose from their concrete anchors.

“A couple here and there,” she said. “Mostly the stubborn ones that won’t go back in at night. But last week alone we lost almost half a dozen. All we ever find are feathers and some dried blood. No remains. No carcasses. And it’s never the ones inside the coop.”

She paused, then added, “We set up a doorbell camera facing it after too many were getting out during the night. The little escape artists kept wandering into the woods.”

As she led me back toward the house, I snapped a few photos for the invoice and followed close behind. We stopped near a row of planter beds lining the back wall—what remained of them, anyway.

The red brick retaining wall was cracked in several places, mortar crumbling onto the walkway. Something heavy had pressed down through the flowerbeds, flattening them in multiple directions. Deep grooves cut through the soil, veins of displaced earth leading away from the damage. Mud splattered the foundation and vent screens above.

Behind one of the mangled shrubs, I noticed a crawlspace entrance—edges damaged, but the opening still intact.

I tried not to think about what might have fit inside.

Keeping my voice professional, I ran through the rest of my script. Larger coyote traps for a couple weeks. Two leghold traps she’d already purchased, baited with our supplies.

Legholds were illegal in our state without very specific permits—but money talks, and Mrs. Carlton spoke fluently.

After assuring me her dog and child wouldn’t be anywhere near them, I suggested placing one trap near the crawlspace entrance and the other at the breach in the fence.

Taking me up on the offer, Mrs. Carlton headed back inside to keep an eye on her toddler, who was already tugging at her leg for attention. I lugged my equipment from the truck, eager to finish up and get the hell out of there.

I set one trap near the gaping breach in the fence and another by the chicken coop entrance. Afterward, I walked her through where they were placed and what to do if either tripped—how to keep kids and pets clear, how to call us for removal or reset. Officially, it was for safety.

Unofficially, I wanted at least one of them in view of the doorbell camera.

Before I left, I pocketed one of the plastic shards coated in that drying residue. I figured one of my coworkers might recognize it. I didn’t like the idea of being the only one who’d seen it.

She thanked me distractedly as I handed over contact information. I offered a quick farewell and all but sprinted back to my truck.

I slammed the door, twisted the key, and cranked the heater to full blast. The engine roared to life as I ignored the reminder to schedule a follow-up visit and nearly squealed my way out of her driveway. At the time, I told myself I’d done my job. Made the sale. Maybe even secured a higher-paying client down the line.

In hindsight, I should’ve told her to get the hell out of Dodge.

Even then, though, part of me tried to rationalize what I’d seen. Except I couldn’t shake the fact that the impressions in the mud outside the fence weren’t anything I recognized.

They weren’t paw prints.

They were deep-set, uneven impressions—unmistakably humanoid.

\*\*\*

I collapsed onto the twin mattress in my small one-bedroom apartment, cracked open an alcoholic beverage, and took a long swig before throwing on some low-volume YouTube documentaries for background noise. I slipped my hearing aids out and let the world fade as sleep took me.

I don’t usually dream. When I sleep, it’s more like a hard cut—one moment gone, the next already waking up. No transition. No imagery. Just time skipped forward.

So when I *do* dream, I remember them vividly.

That night, I found myself back on one of the hunting trips my Pa used to take me on at Grandpa’s land in Florida. The property sat deep in the peninsula—murky, humid, and untouched—trails winding through trees older than imagination, underbrush hiding life too abundant to count.

Visits were rare, but every one had been treasured. Grandpa passed late last year, and after a mess of legal proceedings, the land had been surrendered to the state. Standing again in the hand-carved doorway of his cabin felt like drawing a clean breath for the first time in years.

I ran my hands over the initials and scribbles etched into the wood. The grooves felt just as they always had—warm. Alive. Almost pulsing beneath my fingertips.

That house had been a caretaker. It watched my first cries echo through the living room and my final wave goodbye from the porch. Losing it felt like losing a piece of myself alongside him. The memories were bittersweet now—more melancholic than comforting.

Our last visit hadn’t been pleasant.

It started well enough, the three of us prepping shells and checking trail cams from the night before. It didn’t take long for things to sour. The yelling came fast and loud. I didn’t understand the details at the time, but now I know it was about the birth of my little brother.

Twelve-year-old me did the only thing I could think to do—I stepped between them.

That’s how accidents happen. Not from malice. From misplaced feet. Bad timing. Kind intentions in the wrong moment.

When the rifle went off beside my head, all I heard was a hum.

A steady, relentless hum.

I pressed my pudgy fingers to the sides of my head and screamed when they came away slick with blood.

I never fully recovered. My family struggled with sign language at first, but we learned together. It worked well enough—until the implants came. Now I could hear just fine. Better than most, even. I could tune people out without them noticing, my long hair hiding the devices I once felt ashamed of.

We never blamed Grandpa. He was the first to rush me to his old military medic friend nearby—probably the reason I didn’t lose my hearing completely.

So as I walked those familiar halls in the dream, I let the memories wash over me. Open doors spilled burnt-orange sunlight across polished wood, illuminating every grain and groove as I passed. Each step felt heavy with meaning.

At the end of the hall, I stopped at Grandpa’s bedroom.

My hands were small again—soft, clumsy, eager.

I reached for the doorknob, desperate to see his face just one more time.

My wrinkled, sausage-like fingers closed around the cold metal handle—

My last-minute alarm screamed in my ear. Once it had done its job, I tossed it on the charger and started getting ready—something’s better than nothing. Same approach to breakfast: a quick protein shake from the fridge, then a stop at the corner store for my daily processed sugar and caffeine overdose to pack away for lunch.

When I pulled in that morning, the others were already gone. Boss man stood alone out front waiting for me. Walking up, sipping liquid diabetes, he told me I’d be riding along with him for the day.

Mrs. Carlton had called early. She wanted the house sealed up and the fence repaired, all in one go if possible. We’d need to take measurements for the seal-up and bring sample materials for her to look over once the fence was handled.

I thought about mentioning the strange substance from the day before, but figured he’d see it for himself soon enough.

So I climbed into the passenger seat, and we headed back to that perplexing property. I told myself my hesitation was just nerves.

Pulling into the laneway, I watched the same astonishment cross my father’s face that I’d felt the day prior—muted now by my own familiarity. Morning light filtered through the dense canopy ringing the property. The family dog lounged atop the fountain wall, ears perked as we rolled cautiously into her domain.

Already armed with dog treats—standard operating procedure—I distracted her with belly rubs while Pa went to the door. When Mrs. Carlton didn’t answer on the third ring-and-knock combo, we exchanged a look.

Something was off.

Still, we had work to do. Given our legal right to access our traps at any reasonable hour, we let ourselves in through the unlocked side gate.

The backyard was in as much disarray as before. Worse, actually. The whirring sound threaded through the air again, constant enough to make my jaw tense.

I turned to ask Pa what he wanted to tackle first, but he was already striding toward the gap in the fence.

The debris had changed.

The shattered plastic was no longer just coated—it had been *encased*. The viscous residue had hardened into something clear and rigid, like glass or diamond. It anchored the fragments to the grass and soil so firmly that when Pa tried to chip it off his boot, it wouldn’t budge. Not with a shovel. Not with a pocketknife.

We didn’t discuss it.

We stripped the damaged fencing between the posts and replaced it with identical decorative panels. By the time I was pouring the last bucket of concrete, Pa was checking and rebaiting the trap near the fence line.

That’s when the scream cut through the yard.

High. Feminine. Piercing enough to freeze my hands mid-motion.

We spun toward the house. Mrs. Carlton stood at the back door, her child on her hip, one arm shielding his eyes as if she could block out whatever horror she was seeing.

We rushed over.

The coyote trap near the coop had been knocked sideways, dented deep in several places. Drag marks scarred the dirt, leading back toward the house.

But it was the leghold trap by the crawlspace that stole the air from my lungs.

Clenched in the rubber jaws was a human foot.

Emaciated. Cold. Severed nearly clean at the joint, the rest torn free in ragged strands of tendon and ligament.

While Pa worked quickly—gloved hands steady, knife flashing as delicately as the situation allowed—I guided Mrs. Carlton and her child inside. Any thoughts of sales or professionalism evaporated. I sat her on the couch, handed her the coffee she’d been making, and let her soothe her son with a tablet as he bounced nervously on her lap.

That’s when I remembered the camera.

She pointed me to the display and controller on the kitchen counter, and I pulled up the footage.

I started from the moment I’d left the property the day before.

Minutes blurred into hours as I fast-forwarded—nothing but the dog wandering in and out of frame. Then, suddenly, motion.

The camera quality was disturbingly clear. When the wooden crawlspace entrance exploded outward, I saw everything.

A figure clawed its way out from beneath the house.

The man was gaunt. Filthy. Clothes hanging off him in tatters. But the unkempt blond hair caught my eye—and through the grime, recognition hit like a punch to the chest.

This was the husband.

This was Mr. Carlton.

Before I could fully process it, he took one unsteady step away from the house.

Then a second.

**SNAP.**

The leghold trap clamped shut around his ankle.

He screamed and pulled, feral and desperate. Watching him thrash, I found myself wishing—absurdly—that I hadn’t anchored the trap so well.

He glanced back toward the house, eyes wide with terror, then reached into the remains of his clothing and produced a glinting object. A blade.

He bent down and began sawing at his own leg.

I looked away when the blood came—but forced myself back. I needed to know what had happened. Needed to understand what I’d helped set into motion.

What happened next wasn’t what I expected.

As he hacked through bone and tendon, his attention snapped away from the house. His face twisted into something beyond panic—pure, animal terror.

A thin tendril slid through the crushed foliage toward him.

At first I thought it was a snake.

It wasn’t.

It kept coming, growing thicker with every exposed inch—until it was as wide as my thigh. It wrapped around him with horrifying patience, yanking the knife from his hand as it climbed his body.

There was no struggle.

The tendril tightened, lifted him free of the trap, and met the anchored metal with barely a pause. The remaining tendons tore apart under impossible strength.

And then he was gone—dragged screaming beneath earth and stone once more.

I stood there, flabbergasted, trying to steady my breathing. I rewound the recording, then slowly turned toward the frightened remnants of the family behind me.

Guiding Lois over to the monitor, I replayed the footage from the moment the covering was thrown clear across the yard. Her expression shifted from confusion to shock—then recognition struck.

She finally saw the man she’d pledged her life to.

Her face twisted in agony as she wailed, clutching her head, her child crying in tandem as if on cue. I did everything I could to calm them, to return her to the couch, but nothing helped. The grief poured out unchecked.

Then I heard it again.

The same droning noise—only louder now.

The effect was immediate.

The others in the room *reset*. Lois’s tears vanished as if wiped away by an unseen hand. Her sobbing cut off mid-breath. She smiled—wide, placid, wrong.

I didn’t have time to process it.

My name was being called from the backyard.

“Hey bud—could you grab me the big flashlight? Can’t see a damn thing with this phone.”

My blood ran cold.

I sprinted to the truck, grabbed the light, and tore back toward the yard. My father’s shoes were sticking out from beneath the house as he crawled deeper inside, already committed.

Cresting over the broken wood frame, careful not to snag myself on the jagged splinters, I was hit by a wall of stench.

The air was damp, heavy—almost suffocatingly humid. I shimmied farther in and clicked on the flashlight.

What it revealed stole my breath.

The crawlspace was riddled with holes—gaping earthen orifices ranging from a foot and a half wide to massive openings nearly five feet across. Each one was rimmed with deep, spiraling impressions in the clay, undulations radiating outward in unmistakably serpentine patterns.

Every surface glistened with the same gelatinous ooze we’d found outside—still wet, tacky, and pulsing faintly with the humidity. The smell was overwhelming. There was air moving, but it left the space in shallow, breathy gasps, as if the ground itself were exhaling in protest at being exposed.

Both of us stood frozen.

I swept the beam slowly across the walls. I almost cracked a joke—something about mole people, one of Pa’s favorite high-time conspiracy debates—but I stopped mid-thought.

The light caught something moving beside him.

A thick, greying-white appendage—nearly a foot across—slid silently from one of the holes.

I shouted a warning as the substance dripped from it onto my father’s back.

Too late.

The thing slammed into him with full force, knocking the wind from his lungs. I lunged forward, grabbing for his hand, his shirt—anything—but I was helpless. I watched as his fingers clawed at the dirt, his boots scraping uselessly, before he was dragged screaming into one of the holes.

The sound echoed wetly through the chamber.

For a moment, I was stunned—still crawling forward, still hearing the dragging fade into the walls. I forced myself to act, shining the flashlight down the hole he’d vanished into.

There was nothing.

Just blood smeared along the clay before it disappeared into absolute black.

I scrambled backward, tearing myself free of the crawlspace and bursting back into the house. Mrs. Carlton jumped as I stormed inside—wild-eyed—to find her calmly preparing dinner.

The droning noise filled my head.

“What, in the actual unholy *fuck*, was that?” I shouted.

She looked at me with mild confusion. “What was what, dear?”

The casual dismissal made something snap inside me.

“That thing—under your house! It just took my dad. It took your husband!”

She smiled softly, patting her hands dry. “I don’t believe I’ve met your father, dear. And you’re the only one I know who’s been under my house since…”

She trailed off, struggling.

“Since your husband?” I offered.

For just a moment, her face fell.

Then the hum swelled.

She smiled again. “I don’t have a husband that I’m aware of.”

I left before I said something I couldn’t take back.

Outside at the truck, I forced myself to think. Whatever that thing was, it was enormous—and it had my father. I couldn’t leave. Whatever reason it had for taking him, it wasn’t a good one.

I gathered what I could: rope from the equipment bin, spare batteries for the flashlight, a short trenching shovel. After a moment’s hesitation, I grabbed the cavalry sword from the mantle and packed it all into a tool bag with my lunchbox.

Not much. Better than nothing.

I locked the truck, shut off the CO₂ tank, and parked it in the garage. I hid the keys in the front wheel well—hoping whatever spell or chemical fog she was under would keep her away from heavy machinery.

Back under the house, I tied the rope tightly to a concrete support pillar and tested it hard. It held.

If I died today, it wasn’t going to be because of a bad knot.

I dropped the rope into the same hole I’d seen my father dragged into.

It never hit bottom.

As I stared into the void, the hum returned—pressing against my thoughts. The black ichor clung to the edges of my vision, threatening to spill inward.

Then my flashlight caught something.

Glasses.

One lens was cracked and spiderwebbed with fractures, dotted with fresh blood.

I tucked them carefully into my chest pocket.

With the last of the evening sun bleeding over the mountains behind me, casting long crimson shadows across the crawlspace, I tightened my grip on the rope and began my descent into the dark.

I get that everything is exhausting right now, and don't get me wrong, I am genuinely horrified at the state of the country but I am also trying to acknowledge how much privilege I have and I want to try to use it. I'd love to find other friends who are on the same level! 

This doesn't have to necessarily include volunteer opportunities, I'd also be down for coffee, yoga classes or hiking! I am also fairly creative and like a variety of crafting hobbies like pottery, painting and cosplaying. I don't drink, but I don't need to actively avoid bars, especially if they have drag shows!

A little more about me: I have a million random interests but I'd say my main one is relearning history, specifically the real, less whitewashed & homophobic version of it. I'm a little over halfway through Black AF History and just started re-reading 1984 next, since I haven't read it since high-school and it feels like it would be a fun mind fuck to read now lol I also have a fascination with organized religion throughout history and how different versions of the bible were basically just used as propaganda. I know, I know, I'm super fun at parties lol

I'm also a huuuge animals guy, I have 2 cats and a snake and work part time taking care of some horses down in Parker, so any volunteering with animals would be fun! I know there's a few horse places around here that take volunteers, but I haven't looked into any of them too specifically. Same for an exotic bird sanctuary around cherry creek, I've heard of it but don't know a lot. 

One of the other volunteer places I was thinking of checking out was
I saw a post on the other day on the Denver page about a cafe called SAME Cafe, (https://www.soallmayeat.org/)  where you can volunteer time for a meal, and I love to cook and be around food so that sounded fun. But I'm open to anything!

I'm sure I could say a lot more but feel free to message if you're interested in chatting further!

I have just moved to Wellington last year and run a couple of businesses from home (training and recruitment).  I kick started a ""working from home"" coffee meetup in Nelson where I lived and am thinking of doing something similar here.  A casual but regular thing but where people can share the pains and celebrations of small business over coffee / brunch.  Anybody keen?

I’m freaking out. On Friday night I went to a party with a guy I met at a bar and some of his female friends. We all attend the same university (they’re undergrads, I’m in grad school), and it’s in a very liberal major U.S. city. I don’t actually have his number so I have no way of asking him for help. We all just left together straight from the bar. (He DD’d!)

At the party, I was in a group of people talking politics and about the governor in particular. Someone asked where I was from, and I told her I was from a very deep red state with a governor I find politically abhorrent. (This wasn’t one of the girls from the bar.) She and her friend asked me more about him and I told her about some of his recent political moves. I told her it was funny she asked because I’d actually gotten a long mass text from his office that day which I ignored because his texts usually say something shamefully partisan and piss me off. She and her friend wanted to read it so I gave them my phone and went to take a shot with another girl and then stood in line for the bathroom. I know that was dumb but I’d had a few drinks and am not really protective of my phone at all, though clearly I should be.

When I got back, my phone was on the coffee table and the two girls were nowhere to be seen. I didn’t think anything of it. Then Saturday morning I checked my texts and saw “Broadcast message received” in like three different chat windows with short numbers and was like ??? so I opened the chats and saw that the girls had responded a bunch of stuff like “you’re a Nazi c\*\*t” and “if you support ICE you deserve to be assaulted” and “I hope you die” and “TRUMP R\*PED CHILDREN.” The only thing the number responded was “Broadcast message received” but it seemed like the amount of time it took to respond varied, which makes me worry that it was a real person responding and that I’m gonna be reported to the police for harrassment or making threats or something. Or worse, somehow reported to my university and expelled.

I have no proof of this incident besides the texts which make me look really bad. I don’t know how to reach anyone who was at this party and even if I could reach the guy who drove me, I got the sense that he didn’t know that many people there. The only description I have of them is “two skinny brown-haired white women, early 20s.” I don’t even know where the apartment was.

What should I do??? Just hope that nothing comes of this?? I’m sure they receive nasty text responses pretty frequently in this political climate but I’m worried this crossed the line into something I could get in a lot of trouble for.

Thanks in advance y’all. Ugh.",1,1769392274.0,Advice,3,0.67,False
