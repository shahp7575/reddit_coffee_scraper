I am looking to sublet my private bedroom in a 3-bedroom apartment available on March 1st for a 3-month sublet close to the Gates J train stop. Roommates are two super-friendly French girls in their 30s and 40s who work long hours in philanthropy and are rarely at the apartment. The apartment has an unusually-large patio shared with only one other apartment. There is also a spare 4th room that we use as an office and you are welcome to as well. The building has a huge rooftop, on-site laundry, a gym, and a community room. It's a newer building built in 2016 filled mostly with students and families. This is a great place to be in the Spring. Looking for another quiet, friendly, and responsible person, preferably female.  
  
J train is a 5 minute walk, the L and the C are 15 minute walks. Although you technically never have to leave the neighborhood as it has everything. A handful of grocery stores, bars, and restaurants all a hop, skip and jump away. Cuts and Slices Pizza, Passionfruit Coffee, Blink Fitness, etc.  
  
Please reply with a short bio. Looking for someone to sublet for the entire term.

  
Thank you,

# Introduction To Coffee Powder

Coffee powder is a popular beverage ingredient used to make coffee. It is made from roasted coffee beans that are ground into a fine powder. This powder is then brewed to create the coffee drink that many people enjoy. The flavor and aroma of coffee powder can vary greatly depending on its origin and type. Understanding coffee powder can help you appreciate your cup of coffee even more.

# Origin Of Coffee Powder

Coffee has a rich history that dates back centuries. The origin of coffee powder can be traced to ancient Ethiopia. It is believed that coffee was first discovered there. Local legends say a goat herder named Kaldi noticed his goats became energetic after eating berries from a certain tree.

These berries were coffee cherries. The knowledge of coffee spread from Ethiopia to the Arabian Peninsula. By the 15th century, coffee was being cultivated in Yemen. It was here that the process of roasting and grinding coffee beans into powder began. This method allowed for a more consistent and enjoyable coffee experience.

Important milestones in the history of coffee include:

* 15th century: Coffee cultivation begins in Yemen.
* 16th century: Coffee spreads to Persia, Egypt, and the Ottoman Empire.
* 17th century: Coffee reaches Europe and becomes popular in cafes.

Each region developed its own unique methods of processing and brewing coffee. This contributed to the diverse range of coffee powders we have today.

# Types Of Coffee Powder

There are many types of coffee powder available. These can be categorized based on factors such as grind size and roast level. The grind size affects how quickly the coffee extracts during brewing. Common grind sizes include:

* Coarse: Used for French press and cold brew.
* Medium: Suitable for drip coffee makers.
* Fine: Ideal for espresso machines.

The roast level also plays a significant role in the flavor of coffee powder. Roast levels range from light to dark. Light roasts retain more of the bean’s original flavors. These can be fruity or floral. Dark roasts have a bolder, more robust taste.

Here is a comparison of different roast levels:

|Roast Level|Flavor Profile|Color|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Light|Fruity, Floral|Light Brown|
|Medium|Balanced, Sweet|Medium Brown|
|Dark|Bitter, Smoky|Dark Brown|

Choosing the right type of coffee powder depends on your taste preferences. Experimenting with different types can help you find your perfect cup of coffee.

# Production Process

Coffee powder is a fine, dry substance made from roasted coffee beans. It is used to brew coffee by mixing it with hot water. The production process of coffee powder is intricate and involves several stages. This ensures that the final product is rich in flavor and aroma. Let’s explore the journey of coffee beans turning into powder and the various grinding techniques used.

# From Bean To Powder

The journey starts with the harvesting of coffee cherries. These cherries are picked when they are ripe. Inside each cherry, there are two coffee beans. The beans are then extracted, cleaned, and dried.

After drying, the beans are roasted. Roasting is a crucial step that gives coffee its unique flavor. The temperature and time of roasting affect the taste. Light roasts are milder, while dark roasts have a stronger flavor.

Once roasted, the beans are cooled and then ground into a fine powder. This powder can vary in texture, from coarse to very fine. The texture depends on the brewing method it is intended for.

The entire process involves several stages:

* Harvesting of coffee cherries
* Extraction and drying of beans
* Roasting of beans
* Cooling and grinding of roasted beans

# Grinding Techniques

The grinding process is vital for making coffee powder. The grind size affects the flavor and strength of the coffee. Different brewing methods require different grind sizes.

Here are some common grinding techniques:

* **Coarse Grind:** This is used for methods like French press. The particles are large, which allows water to flow through them slowly.
* **Medium Grind:** Suitable for drip coffee makers. The particles are smaller than coarse grind but larger than fine grind.
* **Fine Grind:** Used for espresso machines. The particles are very small and allow for a quick brewing process.
* **Extra Fine Grind:** Ideal for Turkish coffee. The powder is almost like flour in texture.

Different grinders can be used to achieve these textures. Blade grinders are common and affordable. However, burr grinders are preferred for a consistent grind size. They crush the beans between two surfaces, ensuring uniformity.

Choosing the right grind size and technique is essential. It can make or break the coffee experience. Experimenting with different methods can help in finding the perfect grind for your taste.

# Varieties Of Coffee Powder

Coffee powder is a popular ingredient used worldwide to prepare a variety of coffee beverages. Made from ground coffee beans, it offers convenience and a rich, bold flavor. There are different types of coffee powder, each with unique characteristics and flavor profiles. Understanding these varieties can enhance your coffee experience.

# Arabica Vs Robusta

Arabica and Robusta are the two main types of coffee powder. They differ in taste, caffeine content, and growing conditions.

**Arabica coffee powder** is made from Arabica beans. These beans have a smooth, mild flavor. They often have hints of fruit and sugar. Arabica beans are grown at high altitudes, which makes them more expensive.

**Robusta coffee powder** is made from Robusta beans. These beans have a stronger, more bitter flavor. They have a higher caffeine content. Robusta beans are easier to grow and are more resistant to pests.

In the winter of 2023, I discovered hot brew bags and developed a taste for them. By summer, I had fallen in love with the smooth, aromatic notes of French Vanilla cold brew bags.

Six months later, curiosity pushed me further—I got myself a Chestnut C2 grinder and a French press after hearing that freshly ground coffee makes all the difference. And it truly did.

But the coffee bug didn’t stop there. My fascination with café-style brewing grew, and soon enough, I found myself investing in a domestic espresso machine. Now, I'm diving into the world of pour-overs, experimenting with different techniques, and chasing the perfect flavor in every cup.

1itrmsx,https://www.instagram.com/libdo.usa?igsh=MXNsejF4bnl2ZW91aQ==,I just didn't want die without sex again and without exploring my true self,"I created this username because I think I've shared some info in another subreddit that someone will recognize me and my regular username at one or more events I will be attending in the near future. 

I can't talk about this with anyone in my life but I want to post about some experiences, though I won't post the graphic details here. 

I'm a 53 HLF and have been in a DB for about 15 years. The first few of those was with having sex a few times a year, but the rest have been without any sex at all. Other than that my husband does truly love me and gives lots affection. 

I'm naive sexually because my husband never wanted to explore new things. I was fine with him only wanting very vanilla sex because I loved him and appreciated every time we did have it. 

We grew up with conservative families and he really criticized me when I voiced wanting to try new things. 

I can't talk about any of this with my friends because they would also most likely criticize me as well. 

My libido has never changed throughout the years, not even during pregnancy or a few weeks after giving birth. I do realize this is pretty unusual. 

I must have been having a mid-life crisis about sex because I have been panicking at the thought that I might lose my libido soon due to my age. I've cried for years at the thought that I will never have sex again, and that I will never get to have truly satisfying sex ever in my lifetime. 

I ended up finding a man in a dead bedroom himself.  He is not from a conservative background and has tattoos and long hair and plays guitar in a local death metal band- I never listened to death metal before even though I listen to other kinds of metal, just not that heavy lol. He is someone I never thought would be interested in someone like me. We met at a concert. I was only intending to be friends with him, but he once brought up the topic of sex and things went very different really fast. 

We are both the same age and have both been in the same long years of marriage. I brought up the fact that I once tried to drink my problems away for a few days years ago (I don't drink) and it only made me feel horrible and I did not forget my problems. 

Eventually he said he wanted to ask me a question and that it's okay if I dont answer, and asked how many times my husband and I have sex after all these years. 

When I told him we don't have sex, he asked if it is because of me. I told him that I am the HL in the marriage and that my husband never wants it anymore. 

He mentioned his dead bedroom and that they only have sex once or twice a year. I told him how many years I've not had any sex and he could not believe it. 

He said we should take care of each other and I decided to go for it. 

I am ready to except the judgement that I am a piece of shit. I gave into temptation. 

In the last 6 months we've only been able to have sex 3 times, but it's been an amazing experience for me. We do message each other regularly and meet up for coffee when we are in each other's cities (we live about an hour and a half apart) 

I am embarrassed at the lack of experience, so in December I found a workout course that helps to have better sex from an Instagram account named libdo.usa. I finally got to test the moves last week and it really helped me. 

I have asked him to please tell me what to do for me to be better, and he said he loves every second he is with me and not to worry about it, so I found that course and did it on my own.

I never thought I would have this kind of sex. The conservative community would label me a whore even if this kind of sex was with within my marriage. 

I never imagined a 53-year-old man could do the things he does and last as long as he does. Even though he looks the part of a death metal guy, you should see how kind, polite and shy he is in person. 

I didn't imagine he would be so wild in bed. Especially after the first time that he was so gentle with me. I feel like he worships my body at the same time as he is being rough with me. I am in awe of everything and every moment. 

I feel no guilt. I know I won't leave my family and he won't leave his, and that we are just taking care of this need of ours. I am probably a piece of shit for feeling no guilt. I am so happy I won't die without ever knowing my true sexual self.

I mean i understand some of them and their problems yes they can leave this country but mostly are just following a trend and trying to hate the country they were born in as if they were treated as slaves here just so that they can look cool and gain some attention by those who really hate it, sorry lads i just wanted to go berserk, i can sense the downvotes coming just because i love being an Indian xDDD

Someone said police are shit here because he parked randomly and they charged a fine on him,  
i mean wow, look at him, Mr Legal Expert at this age, ready to file a Supreme Court case after one bad experience with the cops lmfao  
sure, the police system has flaws ikr no one denying that. But instead of whining like a victim, why not work toward reform? join the force, advocate for change, or at least follow the damn rules yourself before pointing fingers. oh and in other countries, they don’t just tow your vehicle they fine you so hard you’ll think twice before complaining, be grateful you got off easy

India isnt perfect, but it’s YOUR responsibility to help fix it—not sit around blaming everyone else. Jai Hind my lad, now park your bike properly next time.

Well lets talk about most beloved subject -: Education system

i saw someone ranting abt how cbse is not at par with icse system, bro went to a CBSE school and now is trashing the entire system? Meanwhile, most of India’s top CEOs, scientists, and global leaders came out of CBSE/ICSE systems. did Ratan Tata or Sundar Pichai fail because of their boards lmao? no na, Its about how YOU use the resources available.  
Also international boards cost a bomb. Not every family can afford them. Should only rich kids succeed then? Stop romanticizing foreign systems and start appreciating what we’ve built here. If you hate the education system so much, why not work to improve it? Or are you too busy cribbing about marks while ignoring real world skills? India’s education system isn’t perfect, but it’s OUR duty to make it better, not just run away to some fancy international board and call it superior. Grow up lads grow up.

When its about roads and traffic, well  
Yeah they are bad, they just suck but those who rant without knowledge are probably the same guys who zips through traffic on their scooty without a helmet. Stop being a hypocrite. Indian roads are chaotic because people like THEM don’t follow rules and obviously the corrupted lads out there but i think we should work on it leaving isnt an option. also every developing country goes through this phase. Look at China 20 years ago, they had worse traffic and road rage. Now they’ve built highways and metros like crazy. Progress takes time, and India’s population is HUGE, making things slower. Instead of complaining work on it. And let’s talk about resilience, we indians drive through potholes, cows on the road, and insane traffic every day and still manage to get to work on time. That’s something to be proud of, dude. The hate is understandable but just think what will happen if everyone stand together and try to get rid of these? We will be having the best traffic system  
Here is the deal Progress takes time. Germany and Japan didn’t build their dream roads overnight lol they worked for decades. And guess what...... They didn’t have 1.4 billion people to manage while doing it. So instead of complaining, why not contribute? Or are you too busy dreaming about Teslas while riding your dad’s Alto? And those complaining abt outdated cars on our rods, those “outdated” cars you hate are affordable for most Indians lad, maybe instead of being jealous of foreign luxuries, appreciate what we have built here. After all, ISRO sent rockets to space for cheaper than NASA’s lunch budget. That’s something to be proud of, genius.

Yeah those suicide cases and all ik they are shame to our country, there are cases, but lads, EVERY country deals with these issues. The US has school shootings and opioid crises. Europe has rising mental health problems. The difference is media coverage. Indian news loves drama, it sells clicks, TRP is their meal. Don’t let sensationalism cloud your judgment at this point.  
Protests ignorance is a issue ik but leaving this country wont make it any better lmao it happens everywhere. Look at France for examle, their protests often get ignored unless they turn violent. We all know what happens in china if someone tries to protest xD isnt it a 1st world class country? Despite being a 3rd world country we are better than most of them  
Stop comparing India to utopias. No country is perfect. Even “developed” nations have massive problems. Focus on solutions man, not complaints :)

I saw a kid saying india is depressing,  
i laughed so hard while looking at that, look at him, mr deep thinker at 15, philosophizing about how “depressing” India is while sitting in hisr room scrolling through memes. Real woke of him. But let me ask: Have any one of you ever stepped out of your comfort zone to actually *do* something about it? No?

India isn’t perfect, but guess what? It’s OUR home. And instead of whining like a toddler who didn’t get their favorite candy, why not work to make it better? People fought for this country’s freedom with blood, sweat, and tears, not so you could sit here calling it depressing. Also, if some of you think other countries are rainbows and sunshine, go ahead and move to Canada and shovel snow all day, or maybe America where healthcare bills will depress you faster than anything here ever could. Still think the grass is greener or another side? Well than leave this apparent shithole and enjoy ur life out there.

And we got some lads complaining about weather wtf 🤦‍♀️😭🙏, Oh bhai matlab kuch bhi bolna h cool lagne ke liye? the weathers too much for you. You think Australia’s wildfires or Canadas -40C winters are better? At least in India, we get FOUR seasons, Try living somewhere where it’s either freezing or burning all year round. Instead of complaining embrace it. Or better yet move to Antarctica. also if some of you guys hate Indian weather so much, why do you love posting beach pics from hill station selfies or any fucking scenic beauty? Pick a lane lad. Either the weather’s unbearable or it’s Instagram worthy. Cant have it both ways.

ALL lndians are toxic? Wtf lmao? while being the most toxic person in the chat. people suck everywhere. Americans are racist, Europeans are snobs and Australians are just drunk 24/7. You think moving abroad will magically surround you with perfect humans? Spoiler alert: it wont . Also those who say there is so much toxicity, how much of this “toxicity” are you even experiencing firsthand? Or are you just parroting what you saw on some Reddit thread? Grow up guys, learn to deal with different kinds of people xD it’s called life. And let’s not forget: You guys are one of those “Indian people” you hate so much. So either fix yourself first or stop throwing stones from your glass house. and while you’re at it, remember that Indians are known worldwide for their warmth, hospitality, and resilience. Maybe take pride in that instead of trashing your own people.

You think America’s perfect? then go get shot in a school shooting. Europe’s amazing lol? nice then enjoy paying 6 dollars for a coffee and freezing your asses off. Canada jaana h? thik h bhai, spend half your life shoveling snow there xD. don’t forget racism exists everywhere. Good luck explaining curry to your clueless foreign classmates.  
Also, if other countries are so great, why do millions of NRIs keep coming back to India after working abroad? Maybe they realize home is where the heart is or maybe they just miss chai with parle g ki biscuit xDDDDD.  
And here’s the kicker mate accept it or not India is OUR identity. If you hate it so much, why dont you change it? Stop running away and start contributing. Or are you too busy scrolling Reddit and insta? Carry on lad carry on

India is doomed acc to some lads, Oh wow, looks like geopolitical expert has emerged in this sub. Truly humbling. lmao lads the thing is India isnt doomed, its growing. Yeah we all know it’s messy and slow, but name one country that became developed overnight. Not happening buddy

Also, if India’s so hopeless, why are companies like Google, Microsoft, billions here, tesla is going to do it soon. Face it lads you arere just mad because your Wi-Fi went out while watching anime or playing some genshin impact or valorant match. And here’s the thing If you really think India has no future, why haven’t you done anything to change it? Instead of running away, maybe try fixing things. Oh wait, you’re too busy scrolling Reddit. Carry on xDDD

**Stop complaining :** You are old enough to know better. If you hate India so much, do something about it. Don’t just sit there whining like a toddler who dropped their lollipop.  
**Appreciate What we have Got:** India isn’t perfect, but it’s OUR home. From ISRO’s space missions to our rich culture man, there’s a lot to be proud of. Stop taking it for granted  
**The Grass Isn not Greener i repeat the grass isnt greener:** Foreign countries aren not utopias. They have their own problems like racism, loneliness, insane taxes. Do NOT romanticize what you dont understand.  
**Grow Up, Be Patriotic:** YES IT HAVE FLAWS A LOT OF THEM A LOTTT BUT instead of running away, stay and fight for the India you want to see.

In short, stop being a brat pick a side (either fix it or leave it), and stop wasting everyone’s time with your shallow opinions. Jai Hind! 🇮🇳🔥

Bullied all my life, everywhere I go even places I PAY. Family sucks. Nobody defends me when I got physically, sexually and psychologically abused. They laugh instead.

Then I grew up. It became worse. Religious trauma after quitting. But I have to pretend with family (I cut so many ties but I cant for some of them).

I feel everyone is talking bad about me in my town. This feeling is getting weird and worse everyday. Everytime someone glances at me I feel like they are laughing. I feel like they know I'm trying hard to lose weight and look better. I know they are laughing. Their glance is deep, they can see through my soul. And then I pinch my arm and dissociate.

At first I just thought ''oh I'm playing victim again''. But months later this feeling I experience outside (except in some places like coffee, I don't know why?) doesn't want to quit my body.

I'm know about to spend my money on hard therapy like EMDR and hypnosis. Please tell me I'm not like crazy? This is just trauma right? I am not staying like this forever?",1,1740031210.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

Felt my phone vibrate but couldn't hear the ringtone. But there was something about how my phone vibrate that had me anxious. Idk if it's because I have my friend as priority for messages or what. But that vibration in my thick, jacket pocket felt familiar. Yet one i haven't heard or felt in 8 months. 

Sure enough, when I pulled into a Wawa for morning coffee, I was rushing to get my phone out of my pocket. Saw their space pfp. I was scared. Texts at 6am from someone you haven't heard from is usually never good. I unlocked my phone, pulled my notifications down super slowly until I saw ""Hey Rue"" as the first two words. My heart stops. Kept reading ""i wish nothing but the best for you-"" I panic hit the notification to take me to the chat. Telling me they wished me happiness, then the next thing they say is how they don't see a friendship with me now nor in the future. Bearing no ill-will but that it's how they felt. That they wanted to tell me instead of never responding to my messages (which they didn't even do they read them but didn't acknowledge them.) They don't want me to send them anymore texts. 

*well so much for having a good day. Just lost my only friend that's cool no biggie anyway will redbull kill me if I take my adderall* all that was in my head. I was on autopilot for the rest of the day. And for the entire week until all I was was gloomy. During that period I felt upset because I felt like I wasn't allowed to even ask why. Why should *they* get the last word in without giving me a reason? No hint at all. Running away from their problems like they always do because they hate expressing high emotions. They either think they're saving me from feeling more like shit or they just don't care about me anymore. They're nonconfrontational and it hurts more that they are. I'd rather them scream and cry at me so we'd at least have a conversation if not closure. I want them to feel like they can let it all out. But they didn't, because they know how I am. This isn't the first time they've pulled this shit. 

Last time this happened we were in high-school. I had graduated before them and they graduated after. We still hung out but I could feel them pulling away. They eventually just stopped responding to my texts. Had an old Android so I couldn't even tell if my messages were delivered or not. So I stopped too. 

Then 4 years later they text me. Nice, heartfelt message telling me how we both hurt each other. But that they don't want to compare ourselves to our teenage selves and how they wish to be friends with me again. Ironically, they sent me that text (January 2nd or 3rd) the day after I finally decided that I was going to end my life after my cat died. Had they not reached back out I would've done so April 20th. I felt like my life was going to turn around for the better. 

Then two years later they couldn't take it anymore I guess. The first time I didn't hear from them in months they at least apologized. But now they didnt even do that. They didn't acknowledge how I may have been feeling prior. I sent them a long, vulnerable message to them new years eve. Telling them how even though inhavent heard from them in a while, i could never change how I felt about them. How i was confused as to what prompted them to reach back out to me. That i felt i didn't deserve it. Thanking them for everything. How i probably wouldn't even be here if they didn't text me that day. Lowkey telling them i was depressed. Trying to convey i needed them without seeming weak. That i wished for them to have a loving and respectful new year. We had talked about making cakes for each other earlier in the year for next time we meet. On my 24th birthday no less. We still chatted from time to time but last we hung out January 19th of last year. Haha ironic that exactly a year later they abandon me again. Anyway I never got that cake. Neither did they. 

I have given them a few things. They've always wanted a Reuben plush from lilo and stitch but they could never find one that wasn't expensive. So i made them an amigurumi of him. Tiny little thing but they loved it. Sending a picture of it to their friend group I assume. I gave them an official Nepeta Leijon plush. They were trying not to cry. I could see it. They hate showing strong emotions so they kept it down. I gave them a little blue build a bear alien  plush  because they love aliens. Sent me pics of it with their green one. Sent me a screenshot of the rainbow one telling me that it was me. Now that I can't get in touch with them anymore i keep fearing they mightve thrown out my gifts to them or given them away. They're self conscious about sentimental items but they do love those things. But....

Anyway, I could never throw mine out. I'd feel like I'd lose the part of me that had hope. That part of me that wanted to change for the better. They worked so hard on them. Why waste the work meant only for me? Would they waste mine? 

January 31st of this year came by. Nothing from them. Stupid to hope I know. I was apathetic about my birthday anyway. Decided to have a relaxing day at a café they introduced me to. Its nice because I have time for myself in a chill environment in a pretty town. Was playing a pokemon fangame for a few hours. Found myself checking their Instagram and Twitter just to see if they've blocked me and they hadn't. When I got to a heated part of the story I saw their mother walk in. She smiles at me and i did back. Then they walk in behind her. Idk if they noticed who their mother was acknowledging. They had to have because they tailgated tf after her. Refusing to look at me. I was trying not to stare myself but I couldn't help but glance, hoping they'd turn around and say hi at the *least*. But no. Their order was ready and they strode so unnecessarily wide to grab their drinks. I recognized that stride. They've done it before way back when when they were trying to avoid me to avoid confrontation. It was the same then. I started to shake as I buried myself deeper into my phone. Not even playing the game anymore. Just lost. Then they left, haven't looked at me once. 

That was it for me. I was so tired. I was so done with being treated like I was something to be thrown away so easily. I waited until they were out of sight. I didn't even say goodbye to the baristas like I usually would. I just strode the same way they did. Picking up the pace when I got closer to my car. Got in, cried and for the first time in forever, I screamed. I screamed for 5 minutes. Then, mind shutting down, I mindlessly drove back home. Walked past my aunt, went into my room, kissed my cat for what I thought was for the last time, and did it. Trying to stay asleep. But I failed. I spent forever on my notes. Low-key hoping for them to find out so they finally knew why I did what i did. How i was because they always cut the hangouts short before i could try to ask them anything.

Was away from my life for a week. But I got the medication I've been needing for years. Checked my phone as soon as i was in my dad's truck. And saw I was unfollowed on Instagram. I could've sworn I was blocked but by the time i checked again I could see their profile and my old comments. I think they just hit the remove follower option for me on both of their accounts. Thing is, one of them followed me back. I posted a hospital photo, got emotional in the caption due to my recovering brain. I was a little too literal. Saying their nickname in my caption and how sorry I was. How i don't blame them. Yet said how i was broken hearted by their  actions a paragraph before. I dont know if they saw it before removing me. A fucked up part of me wishes they did. I wanted them to text me while I was away. I wanted them to reach out to properly speak their mind and apologize. Perhaps even to refresh everything properly. Take into account the multiple times I've told them to tell me if ive been annoying them or overwhelimg them so we don't repeat the same mistakes we made years ago. So we can communicate. But I guess proper communication is below them. 

It sucks. It sucks because i have had feelings for them for years. The kind that while you would love to date them, you also loved your friendship with them. A kind of queer platonic way. I hate the fact that they might've liked me back too at some point. The amount of times we asked each other, how they would do the most subtle gay shit to/with me but still claim no. I mean we were the type to believe that intimacy doesn't have to be romantic. Man I don't fucking know anymore. 

I'm scared to find out if they blocked me from texting them. If they only deleted my contact or silenced my messages I don't want to give them more of a reason to block me. They turned off their rcs so they couldn't tell if I read their messages or not from what it seems like. Doesn't mean im not blocked though. 

I wish the reason why they didn't block me was because the morbidly curious part of them still wants to check up on me, especially if they saw my depressing post. But it could also be they don't want to stoke any conflict. Are they distancing themselves from me to leave me for good or because they feel regret and awkward for dumping me and they need time to process? I hate this. I hate this so much. What happened? Was it me? Was it you? Why can't you be honest for once? The lack of closure literally almost killed me. I hate it feel like i can't speak my mind about it. I respect your privacy. I would still leave you be, granted if we couldn't  figure out a way to fix our friendship. If only there was clear communication from both of us... 

Do you hate me? Is there regret? Do you even give yourself time to think about it to process it? Or are you repressing this like you do whenever you are hurt? Are you seeking professional help from an unbiased source or going to your bestie, who ask used to be mine as well, about what they think and mostly having conflict of interest? 

I know i used to be negative. I was paranoid and passive aggressive. I was clueless. I know you both grew tired of me, but did you have to ghost me like that? I was traumatized from that. You have every right to feel what you feel. You have every right to choose your circle. But don't i have the right for closure? The right to feel anger towards you, instead of always me redirecting it back to myself? I still don't know the exact reason why you left me to rot. And you do it again. Worst of all, i don't hate you. I physically *can't* hate you. I dont like feeling anything negative towards you. I feel like I don't deserve to sometimes. I felt like I'd be a bad person if I did. I hold you with such high regard. I deserved it, right?

I want you to heal. If im in the way, i can't blame you. But im keeping my communications open if you feel ready again. Ready for real. I feel like you've wanted to pull away for a long time. But you let it marinate. And now it's more painful for us that it got this far. Its naive and stupid for me to still hold onto hope things could still work out down the line, isn't it? Ngl i am pathetic lmao. I was probably too weak to be your friend. Always clingy. Always a crybaby. Always always always. 

I miss you so much. Do you feel the same? Probably not...

I had told her we need to get a pump. She said she doesn't need one or want one. Well, now that baby is here and she's producing milk she was in pain from overflow. So we went to the hospital and they ended up pumping some out and told her she needs to be pumping. She doesn't want to bottle feed at all at any point. I brought home bottles and milk bags. Which she said she doesn't need and to return them. Meaning I will never be able to have baby on my own. Which she doesn't work so it's not the biggest of deals but still sucks when all the guys get together for coffee with their babys. 

Now the concern I have is that she is just pumping and dumping it down the drain. I have told her their are so many reasons to keep it. If supply ends, mixing it in with babyfood in the future when we steam carrots and whatnot. Putting it in babys cereal when baby gets old enough. Mixing it with bath water. Now that the pump came she will be using it more frequently. But every time she pumps, she dumps it and says it comes from my body, it's my choice. What do I do? Even the nurse that took care of her said freeze it, save it, anything but dump. Am I wrong to be asking her to save it and freeze it?

Ex (“Jack”) and I were only together for about 5 months, but I really did love him and the breakup blindsided me. But honestly, I’d been proud of myself for how effectively I processed and moved on. I surrounded myself with friends, cried it out, journaled, kept bringing new reflections to therapy, etc. By now, almost 7 weeks out, the wound has significantly healed. 

I wasn’t planning on jumping into another relationship any time soon, but ended up hitting it off with someone new (“Adam”) about two weeks ago - instant chemistry, the kind where you just immediately feel comfortable with someone. I’ve been trying to pace myself a bit because it feels so easy with him, which is wild because both Adam and I are people who usually take a long time to warm up to someone new. Tonight was our 4th date and we met up to work over coffee, then grabbed dinner and drinks somewhere near his place. I’d been tired and wasn’t even wearing makeup, which is unusual for me in dating, but Adam really does just put me at ease and always looks at me like I’m drop dead gorgeous. 

Anyway. We’re at the bar, a little tipsy and handsy with each other. Then Jack rounds the corner and we seemed to notice each other at almost the exact same moment. I didn’t really glimpse his date, just a blur of blonde hair, as seeing him so unexpectedly felt like someone had tossed cold water in my face. It’s not a usual haunt for either of us, or near our respective parts of town. Adam immediately asked me if everything was okay and I admitted that my ex had just walked in with a date and I thought it’d be best if we left so we could have space from each other. Adam was incredibly understanding, kissed me, closed us out, and brought me to his place. I felt more rattled than I thought I would, but if he noticed he didn’t mind. 

Adam and I ended up having sex for the first time and it was phenomenal, but I hate that the little pang in my heart was embedded there too. I know it’ll continue to fade with time, and maybe in a way this is the universe doing me a solid - after all, my ex just saw me with a gorgeous, fit, tatted firefighter lol. But also, more than anything, it reinforced how great Adam is in how tactfully and maturely he handled everything. 

I’m just feeling so many feelings right now and damn, I was not expecting that. ",2,1740030506.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Introduction

Unveiling the Java Burn Experience

I used the Java Burn product over the course of several weeks, intrigued by its promise to enhance metabolism and boost energy levels. As an avid coffee enthusiast, I was curious to explore how this supplement could complement my morning ritual. Java Burn claims to offer a unique blend of ingredients designed to kickstart metabolism, aid in weight loss, and provide sustained energy throughout the day.

The Morning Ritual

Incorporating Java Burn into My Routine

I integrated Java Burn into my morning routine, replacing my usual cup of black coffee with this supplement. The packaging is convenient, with individual sachets making it easy to control the dosage. The recommended method is to mix one sachet with hot water, creating a beverage that resembles a traditional cup of coffee. The aroma was inviting, reminiscent of a rich coffee blend, setting the stage for an uplifting start to the day.

Taste and Texture

A Pleasant Surprise

Upon taking the first sip, I was pleasantly surprised by the taste. Java Burn successfully captures the essence of a well-brewed coffee, with a robust flavor profile that is neither too bitter nor too overpowering. The texture was smooth, and it dissolved effortlessly in hot water, leaving no unpleasant aftertaste. This made it an enjoyable alternative to my regular morning coffee, a crucial factor for me as taste plays a significant role in my beverage choices.

Metabolic Boost

Unraveling the Science Behind Java Burn

One of the primary claims of Java Burn is its ability to boost metabolism, contributing to weight loss. The formula includes ingredients like green tea extract, chromium, and coffee bean extract, each known for their potential metabolic benefits. While I didn’t experience an immediate surge in energy, I did notice a gradual increase in alertness throughout the morning, which could be attributed to the metabolic kickstart promised by Java Burn.

Sustained Energy

A Steady Source Throughout the Day

Java Burn lived up to its promise of providing sustained energy. Unlike the typical caffeine crash experienced with regular coffee, I found myself maintaining a consistent level of alertness throughout the day. This made it an ideal solution for those long work hours when productivity tends to dip. The sustained energy boost without the jitters commonly associated with excessive caffeine intake was a standout feature for me.

Weight Loss and Other Benefits

A Personal Exploration

While using Java Burn, I also paid attention to any potential weight loss effects. It’s important to note that individual responses may vary, and results depend on factors such as diet and physical activity. I did observe a slight decrease in appetite, which could contribute to weight management over time. Additionally, the inclusion of antioxidants in the formula aligns with the overall health-conscious approach of Java Burn.

Conclusio

Java Burn A Worthwhile Addition to Your Morning Routine

In conclusion, Java Burn proved to be a noteworthy addition to my morning routine. Its pleasant taste, smooth texture, and the promise of metabolic benefits make it a compelling choice for those seeking an alternative to regular coffee. While individual experiences may differ, my journey with Java Burn was positive, leaving me with sustained energy and a sense of well-being throughout the day. If you’re looking to elevate your morning ritual and explore the potential benefits of a metabolism-boosting supplement, Java Burn is certainly worth considering.

We have a variety of things that occur here. First off I found the closet doors in the master bedroom to be very creepy, so we removed them and put curtains up to match the vintage style of the house but before the curtains were put up we would find our clothes strewn around the room which has stopped since the curtains went up. 

The door from the kitchen to the laundry room opens at will and has happened when others were here one woman commented ""Do you have a cat?"" Now I've tried to monitor weather patterns, time of day, what we are doing and there seems to be no system here, it just happens. You can close it tightly and bam walk away and it opens, sometimes once and sometimes multiple times. 

Now here is the biggest thing we often here what we think is something like an animal walking or perhaps a small child (a friend did ask me who the little boy was in our yard one day and we have no children in our area). Sometimes the walking is so loud and so we ordered a snake camera and have investigated the floors, walls, ceilings and  we find nothing, not a feather, fur, insect corpse, animal doodie or whatever nor is there evidence of secret walls and people living in them as we have pushed and pulled on everything. 

Now this morning sitting in the living room the lid of a canter I use to fill the coffee machine suddenly popped off and landed in the middle of the kitchen floor.

Any insights here? Out of desperation I bought jingly cat toys yesterday to see if we hear a cat playing with them. Nothing feels malicious, it's just what are we dealing with here?",2,1740030379.0,Ghosts,0,1.0,False

Hey MaximizeMe fam! 🌟

Ever want to *wake up and feel like you're that ultra-productive person* you keep seeing on the internet? You know, the one who's already run a marathon, mastered a new language, and baked classy sourdough before breakfast? 😅 Well, if you've ever felt a tad overwhelmed by the goals you've set, you're not alone. But hey, here's the secret: **habit stacking**.

**What is habit stacking, you ask?** It's like turning your life into a game of Jenga, but instead of the tower toppling, you're building upward! Essentially, it's about attaching a new habit you want to develop to an existing one.

*Sound too simple?* Trust me, simplicity is where the magic happens. Let’s break it down:

- **Start Small:** Got a morning routine? Perfect! Add a 5-minute mindfulness exercise as soon as you finish brushing your teeth. Seriously, *just five minutes* of pretending to be a Zen master.

- **Keep It Snappy:** Already drink coffee every morning? While you wait for it to brew, do a quick 10 push-ups. Consider it repurposing ""waiting time""!

- **Celebrate Wins:** Manage to attach drinking a glass of water to getting out of bed every morning? Pat yourself on the back. 🎉 You deserve it! Small victories count.

- **Add-On Gradually:** Begin stacking more habits over time. Maybe your glass of water leads to a stretch, which leads to a 5-minute read. Before you know it, you’ve got a morning routine that fuels your day.

Now, here’s the million-dollar question: **Why is this habit-stacking thing so effective?** It’s less pressure. You’re not asking your brain to overhaul your life overnight. It’s just, “Hey brain, remember how we make coffee every morning? Let’s just sneak in a couple of squats while we're at it.” Your brain’s like, “Cool, sounds easy enough.” 🤯

Have you ever tried habit stacking, or is this a *whole new* magic trick for you? How’d it work out? Tell us about your stacks (and if they've ever toppled! 😂).

Here’s to stacking our way to the lives we want, one tiny brick at a time. 🙌✨",1,1740030303.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

One that I consider to be one of my closest friends never messages me first or suggests to meet up. However if I suggest meeting up she always will quite soon (it's not like other people I've had in my life before where they will kind of put it off or schedule really far in the future) and we spend a good amount of time together, like 5-6 hours. And it's always just like going for coffee or something, it's not like it's activity focused. In person I get the feeling she does like me, and if I ever need support she is always there for me too. So I'm a bit like idk to what extent she might just be putting up with me considering that apart from pretty much never initiating she is a great friend. The thing that set this off is that she does initiate sometimes with a mutual friend even though I don't think they actually talk as much, and I suspect that a lot of their conversations revolve around workplace drama (they left the place where I now work at the same time)

Hey there, fellow life-maximizers! Ever feel like your week zips by, leaving you wondering, ""What did I actually accomplish?"" 🙃 I was right there with you until I stumbled upon this magic trick: **The Weekly Review**. It's like a superpower that you didn't know you had, and trust me, it’s not just for the uber-organized among us. Whether you’re a list-lover or a ‘fly by the seat of your pants’ kind of person, this little ritual can bring a bit of clarity to the whirlwind we call life.

Why does it work? Imagine having a cozy chat with Future You, setting yourself up for major win vibes. Here’s how I do my weekly check-in:

1. **Find Your Zen Space** 🧘‍♂️  
   Got a favorite nook or maybe a trusty comfortable chair? That's your spot. Grab a coffee or tea, toss in a calming playlist, and let’s dive in.

2. **Think Back... Way Back (Like, 7 Days)** … ⏪  
   What were your wins? Even tiny ones. Finished a book? Fixed that wobbly chair? Gold stars for you! 🌟 

3. **Here's the Spicy Part: The Could-Have-Beens** 🌶️  
   Yep, it's time to learn from those almost-made-it moments. Ran out of time? Endless distractions? What's one thing you could tweak?

4. **Jot Down the Biggies for Next Week** ✍️  
   I love a good list. No pressure though, they don’t have to save the world, just make your life a bit smoother. Think of it as giving Future You a cheat sheet.

5. **Celebrate!** 🎉  
   Don’t forget to do a little happy dance! You’re setting intentions, and that’s worth a mini-party.

Why is this so effective? Because knowledge is power, baby! The more insight you have into your patterns and priorities, the easier it is to tweak, improve, and, let’s be honest, feel like a total boss at life. 💪

Ever had a week where a tiny change made a huge difference? Or a hilarious mishap because you forgot, say, *everything*? Drop by and share your tales. Let’s lift each other up, learn a thing or two, and hopefully have a laugh at ourselves along the way.

1itrc4v,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestIndia/comments/1itrc4v/getting_paid_100k_to_do_nothing/,Getting paid $100k to do nothing,"

4 months ago I joined a top IT company in Melbourne. The interview was very tough and I somehow managed to clear it, the first two weeks I was not sure how I will manage it as there are only 2 people in the onsite IT team including me. 

This is a senior level position and I had some fake experience on my resume, when I started I only got 1 day training as they expected I must already be familiar with everything. 

But I learned everything from the other guy by asking him questions for every single thing. Once I got familiar I realised there is nothing to do as I only have to work if someone has any IT issue. The office is usually empty as people work from home, and if they have any issue while working from home I don’t have to deal with it as they have to call service desk. So I only have to deal with 2-3 issues a week which is less than 2 hours of work per week. 

On top of my pay I also get allowance for travel to other site(which is once a month for a day), phone/internet allowance. 

There is no clock-in/out so I can be late at work and no one cares, as our manager is based in other city there is no one to check what we do. 
I can take longer lunch breaks, multiple coffee breaks and leave early. 

Today I didn’t do anything at work at all, I just scrolled through my phone, had multiple breaks and talked to people in the office. 

The office is right in the center of the Melbourne city and on 30+ floor where I can enjoy the city view throughout the day exactly as I used to dream. 

I feel lucky to be here as I have worked some odd jobs before and really grateful for this privilege. ",26,1740030124.0,OffMyChestIndia,9,0.96,False

1) I will be travelling alone and in Whistler for 10 hours from about 8am to 6pm. I likely won’t have access to a car but am open to taxiing. 

2) I enjoy snowboarding but am now very good at it. I don’t currently have gear in BC and would have to rent.

4) My favourite meals are tacos and burgers, but I also love seafood. I’m open to alcoholic beverage options and also love sweet treats and coffee!

5) I’m a big adrenaline-seeker and love a good thrill! I’ve heard about snowmobiling and zip lining experiences (the prior of which I’ve never done) but am experiencing Whistler on a bit of a tighter budget.

He wore the standard Gas ’n Go uniform—polo shirt, slacks, slightly smudged nametag reading Barry - Happy to Help!—but something about him didn’t quite settle right.

Maybe it was the way he stood too still when listening. Or how his thinning hair seemed carefully arranged, as if he'd considered each strand with great intent.

Or maybe it was his smile—a little too wide, a little too patient—like he was waiting for something no one else could perceive.


---

Frank, the manager, gave him the rundown in the break room while stirring his cup of coffee into a sludge-thick whirlpool.

He didn’t seem to notice Barry hadn’t blinked in a while.

> “Don’t bother me unless something’s on fire, the pump explodes, or you see a cryptid,” Frank said. “And even then, don’t.”



He shuffled toward his office without waiting for a response.

Barry watched him go, then stepped out onto the main floor of the Gas ’n Go.


---

A single fluorescent light flickered overhead, making the space feel both overlit and strangely dim at the same time.

The shelves stood in uneven rows, packed with off-brand sodas, dusty snack cakes, and an entire section dedicated to air fresheners shaped like pine trees.

The rotating hot dog rollers whined softly in the background, their contents glistening under the heat lamps.

Tina stood behind the counter, sipping from a Styrofoam cup of gas station coffee. She wore the same uniform as Barry, but hers looked more like a suggestion than a requirement—shirt untucked, nametag missing, expression locked in perpetual apathy.

She barely looked up.

> “So,” she said. “You’re the new guy.”



Barry’s smile didn’t change.

> “Yes.”



His voice was calm. Even. Unhurried.

Tina took a slow sip of coffee, eyes scanning him like she was trying to figure out why he gave her a weird feeling, but deciding she didn’t care enough to investigate.

> “Cool. Just don’t make my day worse.”



> “Understood,” Barry said, though understood was a relative concept, he thought.




---

The bells above the door jingled as the first customer of the morning entered.

Conspiracy Chad shuffled in, moving like a man who expected snipers in the rafters. His oversized camouflage jacket swayed with his steps, and his eyes flicked around the store as if the gas station might suddenly reveal itself as a government surveillance outpost.

He stopped in front of Barry, squinting.

> “Who’s this guy?” he asked Tina. “New hire? Corporate spy? Government plant? Skinwalker?”



Barry inclined his head slightly.

> “Barry. Happy to help.”



Chad’s frown deepened. He stared for an uncomfortably long time, his gaze jumping between Barry’s eyes, his uniform, and seemingly past him at something only Chad could see.

After several seconds of intense squinting, Chad slowly nodded, as if reaching some kind of private conclusion.

> “Right,” he said, grabbing a bag of pork rinds. “But I’m watching you, buddy.”



Barry only smiled.


---

The day passed in slow, sleepy shifts, the kind where time bent strangely—stretching long and thin in places, then snapping forward in sudden jumps.

Customers drifted in and out, some speaking, some silent. The smell of old coffee and synthetic citrus from the air freshener aisle created an almost dreamlike haze.

Barry busied himself with small tasks. He stacked cans, rearranged candy bars, cleaned the windows with almost unnerving precision.

No one noticed when the clock above the counter hesitated mid-tick before continuing backward for a full minute.

Or when the hot dog rollers slowed, then sped up in perfect unison, as if following some unseen tempo.

Tina didn’t comment when the candy display, which had been in neat rows earlier, was now arranged into strange, swirling patterns.

At one point, she frowned at it, tilting her head slightly like something about it felt wrong—but ultimately shrugged and went back to her coffee.


---

By the time Frank emerged from his office, the store looked more or less the same.

Tina was still at the counter, ignoring the world.

Conspiracy Chad had returned to argue with a trucker about fluoride in tap water.

And Barry, the new hire, was sweeping the floor in long, methodical strokes, his expression unreadable.

Frank rubbed his temples.

> “Barry, you good?”



> “Better than ever,” Barry replied.



Frank gave him a long, blank look, then sighed and went back to his office.

Barry’s sweeping slowed slightly.

He glanced toward the front window, watching as gray clouds hung low in the sky, the streetlights flickering despite it being midday.

His reflection in the glass lingered just a little longer than it should have when he turned away.

What did Chahat even do all season? Who did she become friends with? Avinash, a guy from Jharkhand himself, called her gawar and she went down the 'gao se hun to gawar bola' pipeline. What could be have said then? Abused her?

And downvote me but i don't think Avinash was wrong in the way he retaliated against throwing water. He was joking and everyone knew that. Everyone. It was not character assassination.

And yk what's the worst part about it? I say this as a Chum supporter. She's the one I voted for, and after her Avinash. Then KV. Let people speak. Please.

- Anti acids or your prescribed medication. Usually Gaviscon and alka seltzer are my friends. I love pepto bismol and usually does help when I do want to cheat lol.
- if you want to eat and are hunger drink ginger it helps and eating some yogurt or oatmeal won’t do much harm. 
-Burp? It just helps but don’t breathe in the stomach acid and make sure you drink water otherwise it can damage your lungs. In general have water beside you.
-Have a good amount of blankets. Soft and keep your feet cozy, warm and tucked in. Have another one on top and raise you head high and try to sleep. If you want to sleep in you side slowly lay your body left.
-Walk after you ate and don’t eat after 6. 
-Floss and clean you teeth softly especially since all that stomach acid might damage your teeth.
-have a comfort stuffy that smells like you or someone that’s bring your comfort 
-Pray. Feelings are in your stomach it’s important that you find a distraction not your phone, tv or music. It’s better to look around and process everything. Appreciate it. If you’re finally not feeling overwhelmed watch positive video where you know a creator or content won’t bring negativity.( I usually watch aesthetic stuff or listen to sermons)
Trust me when I say don’t watch or listen to anything negative. It worsens when your mind goes to bad places.
- Read a book ( Bible) especially things the involve bringing you up
- Use the washroom as much as possible before you sleep 

Things that will help in the long run:

-Be positive. It help not sure why but it’s just helps so much.
-Take the medication your doctor prescribed you and you will heal

**^ don’t get cocky and greedy and make sure you truly change your lifestyle and food intake^**
 -I made that mistake and went right back to suffering-

-Discipline control yourself emotionally and physically.
- No caffeine (coffee,tea or sodas)(it worsens it 120%)
-No carbonated drinks again just drink water man
- just drink water and add some ginger if you are planning or drinking tea.
-No chocolate 
- No Onions 
AND ESPECIALLY ANYTHING WITH TOMATOES. ITS OUR ENEMY!!!
- no fried foods
- no smoking 
-no spicy foods 
- no citrus fruits ~LEMOn~
- Don’t eat fast and chew that way everything is easier to digest 
- Don’t think food as a friend it’s a necessity do eat healthy and add your protein otherwise your body will be starving and quite frankly will lose muscle mass.
- it’s important to find what triggers you in general but cutting is hard but after the suffering of each trigger your body will warn and react and trust it please.
- it’s hard to sleep but magnesium did help with my stomach to relax and not cause so much discomfort.
- drink Aloe Vera and the more neutral the better.
- Move and go for walks if your not able to go outside stay and walk around your room.
-don’t stop eating eat in small meals even if it’s the smallest thing ever don’t hurt yourself your body needs you 
- slipper elm supposedly helps sooty your esophagus but I can never get my hands on some.
- make sure to bring healthy lunches and don’t be scared to talk about your health.
- it’s sucks to deny food even if you want it but your body doesn’t need it. Trust me.
I’ll figure out some more ways to help.

If you’re wondering whether Starbucks gift cards expire, you’re not alone. Many coffee lovers and frequent visitors to Starbucks are curious about the longevity of their gift cards. It’s important to understand the details surrounding gift card expiration to make the most of your purchase.

Starbucks gift cards, as per company policy, do not have an expiration date. This means you can hold on to your Starbucks gift card indefinitely without worrying about losing its value over time. The funds loaded onto the card remain valid, allowing you to treat yourself to your favorite beverages whenever you choose.

However, it’s essential to be aware of state laws that may affect gift card expiration. While the federal regulations support the idea of no expiration, some states have specific laws that could impose restrictions. For instance, certain jurisdictions prevent fees from being deducted as long as no transactions occur. Therefore, be sure to check local regulations that may pertain to your Starbucks gift card.

Another factor to keep in mind is that while the card itself doesn’t expire, not using it over a long period can lead to inactive account policies, depending on state laws. In such cases, it’s wise to register your card online. Doing so not only gives you a secure way to manage your balance but also protects it from being deactivated or lost.

To summarize, Starbucks gift cards do not expire, making them a convenient option for coffee enthusiasts everywhere. Simply keep your card safe, and enjoy the flexibility that comes with it, whether that’s treating yourself post-work or sharing the love with friends and family.

1itqua1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dustythunder/comments/1itqua1/aita_for_taking_everything_i_bought_out_of_our/,AITA for taking EVERYTHING i bought out of our shared apartment?,"Hey all! So here's what happened. This was years ago, 2021, to be specific, but it's still something I occasionally think about. Let's jump all the way back to the beginning so yall get the full context. 

Back in 2021, I was living with some relatives after coming home from military training. That didn't work out so well (a story for another time), so my ex best friend (we will call her Mary) and her mom let me live with them. Mary and I were both 22 at the time. We were like sisters all through high school and then had a few setbacks nearing our graduation and picked up again right before this situation. I offered to pay rent and was told it wasn't needed since it wasn't a permanent gig. I was beyond grateful. Everything was great for awhile. I was looking into apartments but was struggling since it was right after covid, and I was a single income at the time. After speaking to Mary about it, she said her and her boyfriend were thinking of getting an apartment, and maybe we could look together. I was all for the idea, the extra help relieved a lot of stress. 

Flash forward to when we found the apartment. It was above a coffee chop with no windows, extremely stuffy, no yard, no AC, and only 2 fire escapes.We had to buy vented AC units due to the 0 window access and 90⁰ summer heat. Keep in mind we have 2 animals with us, one needing access to the courtyard across the heavily trafficked circle for potty breaks every few hours. I wasn't fond of this idea since we were also approved for a smaller apartment, with a yard and windows, and it was in our hometown. However, I was out voted 2 to 1 (i guess that should've been my first hint). 

Flash forward again to when we have been living together in the apartment for about 2 months. Everything was great. We went on trips together, and Mary and I were closer than ever. Then it was like a flip of a switch. I was seeing one of her Boyfriends best friends, and it didn't work out so well. Keep in mind Mary and her boyfriend set us up to begin with.  He went to them first about calling it off,  and I found out days later,  not knowing anything was wrong. Obviously,  finding out my best friend knew but didn't come tell me put a sour taste in my mouth,  causing some tension,  ya know? I wasn't upset about the guy, as it was a short fling anyways, but more of the feeling of betrayal? Again, I was 22, and at the time, it mattered. 

From there, it just crashed. Eventually, Mary and her boyfriend came to me, saying they were moving away by the beginning of the following year. At this point, we were in September of 2021, so it was fairly close to the new year. I was estatic for them, as they were a good couple and she was happy. However, I knew I wouldn't be able to afford the apartment on my own, nor would I want to due to its severe inconvenience on myself and my dog. I told Mary and her boyfriend I was planning on moving out by the beginning of December (a month before them) so I could avoid this issue. I didn't think it would be a big deal since the lease was a monthly ordeal, and we can cancel it at any time. I was only leaving a month prior to them so I didn't think it wouldn't affect them too much and I was also willing to pay my portion of December if they needed, to keep them afloat. However, when I told them this, all hell broke loose. Mary immedeitly reacted, saying I had to be out by the upcoming Friday since I wanted to leave (it was currently tuesday). I was stunned, but honestly... I didn't argue. Again, i was told i was outvoted... 2 to 1. This is where i think the previous tension from the previously mentioned scanario came into play. I said whatever and went from there. My family came and helped me pack my things and moved me out by the next evening. 

Here is the juicy part that I still feel petty for. I took EVERYTHING my family and I bought. I mean everything. I took the TV I lended them from their room, the wifi router (it was under my name), the silverware, kitchen table, pots, pans, dishes, half the food (Mary and I split it 50/50), extension cords, trash bags, toilet paper, the shower nozle, and even the shower curtain (which i later threw away the same day). I know this is petty, but i was infuriated. I also know this probably put them in a tight spot since they weren't exactly financially stable. If things ended better, I would've happily left a lot of the things I gave them to begin with. 

I was also informed during this moving trip of something that still digs at me. I had a 1.5 year old pup at the time. Obviously, not having yard access was an inconvenience, but it was something I managed. However, I worked 20 minutes away and wasn't able to let him out potty when I needed to (when I bought him Obviously this wasn't my arrangement. So, I would ask my father to let him out for me while I was at work. He reluctantly did so (it was also a 20-minute drive for him) because he loved my pup so much and knew I needed help. Well, he informed me that on multiple occasions when he would show up, Mary and her boyfriend were in the apartment while the pup was barking in her crate and refused to take her out. Obviously, my father wasn't happy, but let it go for my sake. Well... until we moved out, and he flicked off the camera they had posted looking down the hallway to the front door. 

So I'm asking yall... am I the asshole? I know there's 2 sides to every story, and I'd love to hear hers, but we haven't talked since the day I left almost 4 years ago. I still think of her and keep tabs on her life as we were so close, and she truly had such a positive impact before those times. We don't live super far apart anymore, and I'd love to reach out, but when I tried (about 2 months after), it got massively shut down, reasonably so. Maybe that makes me a fool for even wanting to, idk. 

Ask any questions yall have, and I'll be happy to clarify anything needed. 

-------------------------------------

To clarify, I am happily in a 2 year relationship, in a house we own together, halfway across the country from Mary and Is Home Town. I am very happy and very secure. However, losing your high school bestie in such a hurtful way would stick with anyone.

The landscape of online commerce continues to evolve, prompting individuals and small businesses to seek accessible platforms for establishing their digital presence. Within this context, [Shopify has introduced a compelling proposition](https://www.dailybargains.com/out/shopifyevergreen?cid=shopify1monthtrialfeb25_rddt): the opportunity to launch a comprehensive online store for a nominal monthly fee. This initiative addresses a critical hurdle for many aspiring entrepreneurs: the financial barriers associated with initial setup.

**Tailored Solutions for Niche Markets**

Shopify’s architecture caters to businesses across industries, from boutique artisans to tech-driven startups. Unlike rigid platforms that enforce generic templates, Shopify enables brands to craft unique digital experiences through customizable themes and integrated apps. For instance, a specialty coffee roastery can leverage Shopify’s product variants to highlight bean origins and roast profiles, while a handmade jewelry seller utilizes collection filters to segment pieces by material or style. This flexibility ensures businesses maintain brand integrity while adapting to market demands.

# How to [Get Started with Shopify](https://www.dailybargains.com/out/shopifyevergreen?cid=shopify1monthtrialfeb25_rddt)

Bringing a business idea to life doesn’t have to be complicated. Shopify offers a three-day free trial, giving users the opportunity to explore features before committing. After the trial period, select plans are available for just $1 per month for three months—an affordable way to test the waters of e-commerce.

Simply enter an email address to begin the free trial, no credit card required. Once inside the Shopify dashboard, users can customize their store, add products, and configure payment settings. With built-in marketing tools and analytics, optimizing sales and attracting customers becomes straightforward.

# Who Benefits Most from Shopify?

* **First-time sellers** looking for a simple way to test product ideas with minimal risk.
* **Brick-and-mortar store owners** wanting to expand their customer base through an online storefront.
* **Content creators and influencers** interested in monetizing their audience with branded merchandise.
* **Dropshipping entrepreneurs** seeking automation-friendly solutions to streamline order fulfillment.
* **Established businesses** needing a robust platform to manage high traffic and sales volume.

**Use Cases and Practical Applications:**

* **Artisan Craft Sales:** A local artisan, producing handcrafted jewelry, can utilize Shopify's platform to establish an online store, reaching a wider audience beyond their immediate geographical area. The ease of product photography integration and customizable store themes allows for a visually appealing presentation of their creations. This addresses the pain point of limited local customer reach.
* **Digital Download Distribution:** A musician seeking to distribute their independent album can leverage Shopify's digital product delivery system. This negates the need for physical inventory management and streamlines the sales process. This addresses the painpoint of needing a physical presence to sell digital goods.
* **Service-Based Consultancies:** A freelance consultant offering specialized services, such as virtual coaching, can utilize Shopify to manage appointment bookings and payment processing. This eliminates the need for manual scheduling and invoicing, providing a streamlined experience for both the consultant and their clients. This addresses the painpoint of manually managing bookings.
* **Niche Product Retail:** An individual who sources and sells specialized vintage items, such as collectible pins, can utilize Shopify to manage inventory, process payments, and ship orders. The platform’s ability to handle intricate product variations and manage limited stock is a significant advantage. This addresses the painpoint of managing a complex inventory.

Compared to other platforms that might require intricate coding knowledge or extensive technical expertise, [Shopify's user-friendly interface](https://www.dailybargains.com/out/shopifyevergreen?cid=shopify1monthtrialfeb25_rddt) simplifies the process of store creation and management. The platform's integrated features, such as secure payment processing and shipping label generation, further streamline operations. For those seeking a platform that facilitates **simple online store management for beginners**, Shopify's offering provides a compelling option.

# Addressing E-Commerce with Integrated Tools

**Streamlining Complex Operations**

Managing inventory, orders, and customer interactions across multiple channels often overwhelms small teams. Shopify centralizes these workflows via a unified dashboard, syncing data from physical POS systems, social media shops, and online marketplaces. A case study involving a mid-sized apparel brand revealed a 40% reduction in administrative time after migrating to Shopify, attributed to automated order routing and real-time stock updates.

**Enhancing Visibility Through Built-In SEO Capabilities**

Search engine optimization remains a critical driver of organic traffic, yet many platforms lack native tools for keyword optimization. Shopify automates meta tag generation while allowing manual overrides for title tags, descriptions, and ALT text—key factors in improving search rankings. For example, a home decor retailer targeting “handmade ceramic tableware” can embed this long-tail keyword into product pages and blog content, capitalizing on low-competition search volumes. The platform’s blogging module further supports content marketing strategies, enabling businesses to publish SEO-optimized articles that drive sustained traffic.

# Strategic Differentiation from Competing Platforms

**Customization Without Complexity**

While alternatives like WooCommerce demand technical expertise for customization, Shopify’s drag-and-drop editor empowers users with varying skill levels to modify layouts, fonts, and color schemes. Advanced users can access Liquid code for deeper personalization, ensuring the platform scales with a business’s evolving needs. This contrasts sharply with competitors that either limit design freedom or require costly developer interventions for basic adjustments.

**Multi-Channel Integration as a Growth Accelerator**

Modern consumers expect seamless shopping experiences across Instagram, Amazon, and branded websites. Shopify’s omnichannel toolkit unifies these touchpoints, enabling businesses to manage listings, promotions, and inventory from a single interface. A survey of 500 Shopify merchants indicated a 28% increase in cross-channel sales after adopting the platform’s integrated marketing tools.

# Optimizing the Path to Conversion

**Data-Driven Customer Journeys**

Shopify’s analytics suite illuminates customer behavior patterns, from page view durations to checkout abandonment triggers. By pairing these insights with apps like Seguno for email segmentation, businesses can deploy hyper-targeted campaigns. For instance, a skincare brand might automate post-purchase emails suggesting complementary products based on browsing history, boosting average order value by 22%.

**Frictionless Onboarding for Rapid Launch**

The platform’s sign-up flow exemplifies user-centric design, requiring only an email to initiate store setup. Prospective users can explore features like theme customization and product imports before committing payment details—a strategy shown to increase trial-to-paid conversion rates by 34%.

Whether launching a side hustle or scaling an existing business, Shopify removes barriers that often hinder e-commerce success. With its streamlined design, scalable features, and an exclusive low-cost trial, now is an ideal time to explore what’s possible. Take advantage of Shopify’s risk-free offer today and start building a brand that stands out in the digital marketplace.",1,1740027802.0,dailybargains,0,1.0,False

This happened just before. My friend is broke, he hasn't worked in over a year, he's running out of savings and has even had to ask his parents to support him.

I asked him many times why doesn't he try to get a job that's not in his field. He's got a computer science degree but has never worked in the field a single day in his life since graduating. He's turned down lots of jobs because reasons. They don't pay him enough, they won't give him a higher up position right off the bat, etc. I'm well aware he's deluded in that sense, but he has many other good qualities and that's why I love the guy. So since graduating the only job's he's done is Share marketing, something like online investing, in ForEx. He said he made about $20 a day and that it was enough for him. He's single, lives in a shared house and doesn't spend much. Whatever makes him happy right?

The thing is he's totally broke. I don't think he really is making even $20 a day on the shares because he's run out of money. He's stressed out and won't stop complaining about money problems. This is confusing for me and I think it comes down to his pride not allowing him to get a job that's not fit for his ego. Now, I work as server in a very nice restaurant and have offered him a job as a server many many times. I have a great relationship with my boss and after telling him my friend's situation he didn't hesitate to say he wanted to help and would like to offer him a full time job. My friend has been turning it down for months not really giving much of an explanation.

Today he called me saying his parents have cut him off and asked to borrow money from me. I said that as a personal rule I do not lend money to anyone, but that he was welcome to start working tomorrow with me. He again turned down the offer and I got a bit frustrated because I'm offering him a solution to his money problem but he won't accept it.

So we got into a bit of a banter and he finally confessed he thinks being a server is low and doesn't get you people's respect. I told him respect is earned by getting off your ass and doing whatever you have to to make ends meet.

I asked him if he thinks I'm low and he back-pedaled saying he didn't mean I in particular was low, but the job itself was. He then straight out told me nobody can respect me working as a waiter in my 30's. Wow. Tbh I'm pretty upset, he thinks I am low for working as a server? I got a degree too but I couldn't find a job in my field so I had to take the first job I could, I'm not some prissy prick thinking I'm too god to serve others. I take pride in being a waiter and doing a great job. I'm so hurt by his comments. Why is he my friend if he thinks I'm low?

I didn't want to say something nasty or get into an argument with him so I only told him he was being very offensive and I felt like he needed time to think about what he said to me. He replied saying there was nothing to think about, then gave me a list of 'low' jobs like street sweeper, cleaner etc and said it's a fact those are low, not respected jobs. I asked him to apologize before this snowballed into a full blown argument and he said he stood by what he said.

I don't wanna over react but I don't know if we can keep being friends after this. I really don't know what to do. I don't wanna badmouth him but he should examine his life and learn empathy. I'm a very easy going and forgiving person but what he said hurt me and was idiotic. The man who refuses to work calling me low. I don't know what to do.

**TL;DR** Friend is broke, I offered him a job in a restaurant but he turned it down saying is low and not a well respected job.

>Honestly, be happy he didn't took the job. Because with that attitude he wouldn't have lasted long and tarnished your rep with it.

>""I don't wanna over react but I don't know if we can keep being friends after this.""

>Honestly, don't keep him as a friend. Doesn't seem that you get much out of the friendship anyway.

**BillyClubxxx**

>Funny. Pompous ass is too good to work as a waiter but isn’t above asking to borrow money from a waiter because he’s too pathetic to go earn a living to take care of himself.

>It’s easy. Take the job off the table because it’s not appreciated or respected by him and it will only end bad for you and your generous boss, don’t lend your friend anything and let him figure out his problems on his own. Simple life lesson coming.

[Update - rareddit](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9zzhvi/update_my_friends_broke_so_i_offered_him_a_job_as/)  **Nov 24, 2018 (next day)**

I made this post yesterday asking for advice on how to handle the situation with my friend.

Basically he's very broke and his parent have cut him off. I've been offering him a job in the restaurant I work in for months and he always turned it down.

His situation got so bad he came to me yesterday asking to borrow money. I don't let money to anyone as a rule, but I told him there'll always be a plate of food for him in my house and he was welcome to accept the job offer and star working with me the very next day.

Well long story short, we had a bit of an argument -if you can call it that- and he finally confessed he thinks being a server is low and won't earn him people's respect.

In an interesting turn of events he called me today and said he'd thought it through and had decided he's willing to accept the job only with one condition (as if he was the one doing me the favor), that he's to be made manager right off the bat and that he should move in with me so that I can drive him to work because the bus from his house to my workplace takes 35 minutes and that's over an hour of commuting a day.

He then suggested I move my youngest daughter into my elder daughter's room so that that's an empty bedroom for him in my house. So he obviously had given this some thought.

I was dumbfounded. The sense of entitlement and the level of pride you gotta have to make those demands is astonishing. I know he's never had a proper job but he's not stupid, he has to know you can't be made manager if you don't even know the names of their dishes or how to serve a coffee.

It's all about his pride. He's got an ego bigger than I thought. He can't be humble enough to accept a waiter job and work things out from there, he needs to be made manager so that it won't hurt his pride as much.

Tbh I was so out of words I said I don't wanna talk and hanged up. I can't explain how off putting that conversation was, I feel repealed by him, I feel disgusted, as if something has changed inside me, I can't have a person like him in my life.

What makes a person refuse all help just out of sheer pride? My wife says I've been patient and kind enough to him throughout the years and I should let him figure things out on his own.

He really is broke, before his parents cut him off they were covering his rent/bills and he survived on the $20 a day he claimed to be making investing in Forex. I know he barely eats and can't even afford a new pair of shoes, and some other stuff, I know he's got no money, but then why won't he accept the job?

He's not shy, has no mental health issues, has no problem dealing whit people. He's refused many other jobs in the past. Even jobs related to his degree -computer science-. He's got the wrong idea that he should be given higher up positions right from the start because he's him, and that's what he deserves. That's the reason he hasn't worked a single day since graduating like a decade ago.

Anyway, I've go to do some deep thinking and re-evaluate this friendship because I don't like the person he's becoming.

His dad is a bus driver and his mother a retired teacher, they are lovely humble down to earth people, I think they've done the right thing cutting him off. I know they'r both struggling financially so it's not fair for their son to leech off them. His mother even had to go back to work doing some tutoring in order to make some extra money to be able to support my friend. I'd be so ashamed if I made my 70 year old mother go back to work just so I could be sitting at home dreaming of landing the perfect job while actively ding nothing to get one.

Anyway, I'm rambling. Sorry I'm just so mad. My wife says it's time to cut the cord and distance ourselves from him. I think she might be right.

Edit- A yellow star has appeared next to my name. Does this mean I'm the sheriff now?

1itqdfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1itqdfa/il_nuanced_friendship_with_a_former_employee_of/,[IL] Nuanced friendship with a former employee of my workplace — we had a falling out and now I’m stressed about our personal correspondence,"Hello!

So, this might be a long post, but I feel as if context is necessary. When I was relatively new at my job (less than 6mos), a leader in my job’s HR department left their position for a better role at a different company. Upon their departure, they reached out asking to keep in touch. I was so new, and this was my first “big girl job”, so i was eager to make a connection with a seemingly well liked leader. Basically, this person gained my trust after they left the company to the point where I would vent constantly about my job (their *former* workplace) to them seeking advice. However, because the relationship was formed after this person left, and we were getting drinks and dinner together regularly, I let down my professional guard and talked to them the way I would talk to friends — significantly less professional language, listening to and commenting on their gossip about what they knew about people at work and also private personnel issues at their new company. Turns out, and I realized I should’ve seen this coming, this person was basically trying to hook up with me even though I was always clear that I was unavailable. This person went as far as to admit they had looked up my private personnel files to see if I was married or not. They also had offered me cash once in exchange for being out with them, which i vehemently refused and was even embarrassed at the suggestion. So, of course we have a major falling out and I called this person out for exactly who they were. 

Months later, over coffee, a colleague of mine told me things about this person that made me realize that their worrisome behavior was beyond just their interactions with me. I truly believe this person seeks to harm or take advantage of people, so I’m worried that, because I cut this person out of my life for their own bad behavior towards me, they can contact my job with things/screenshots from our private correspondence i’ve said venting about work especially since they know most of the people still in the HR department. This is a purely hypothetical scenario, but I’m just curious as to what HR’s move would be if this were to happen. ",0,1740026716.0,AskHR,1,0.33,False

This show feel so cozy ❄️","The most important piece of information that made me want to make this post. There is someone who has started translating the novel When it rains it pours in wattpad.

The official twitter account of the fansubber: https://x.com/ToondelPancakes/status/1891938574129336625?t=qODoW1ubAuQWUx4q5_fUow&s=19

The translation is definitely not the most polished out there. Just don't expect a really good quality of it 😊

From time to time, i come across a few BLs that makes me think "" i am glad to be alive to be able to witness this"" and When It Rains It Pours  is one of them.

It's such a good series, because what do you mean our  main characters are cheating, but the whole nation is  celebrating it.

I'm gonna take this ocasion to share  some things about the series that i haven't time to share.

One thing that i appreciate the most about this series is the psychological work on character development. Having the characters react in contradictory ways when put on various situations,  for fear of being hurt, rejected or disliked.

This kind of characterization isn't as frequently encountered in BLs as i would like to see it. 

The characters start mirroring each other as the story unfolds. They start  saying and doing things that the other have been saying  and doing in the beginning. And this adds so much depth and nuances to the characters and makes me reflect on the different ways i reacted and i was feeling when confronted with similar situations. Time, our encounter with people, the small changes happening inside us build us in a certain ways and make us react in a slightly different ways that we woukd have seen ourselves react.

In the beginning, Sei was kind of rude, would tend to speak his mind,  while Hagiwara tends to be extra polite in his interactions and would hold his thoughts to itself. As they get closer and they start to get more familiar and comfortable with each other,  we see Hagiwara starting to take the initiative, starting to reach out, while Sei would try to hide and no longer reveal himself to Hagiwara as he has done before.

This isn't the first and it won't be the last time a JBL does an oustanding job in depicting such a nuanced characterization that we see here. 

I am in awe with how well the series managed to make me intuite and  understand what the reasons might be behind every word and action that the characters do.

They both develop an emotional connection through mail, but they weren't on the same page from the very beginning. Even through Sei has said that everything has started at the museum, i don't personally think it did from Hagiwara'wPOV.  Sei didn't saw Hagiwara in a sexually and romantic light before the museum. This can be easily deduced from the way Sei doesn't initiate conversations, don't engage with him out of genuine interest in the beginning. Until the museum incident happened, Sei didn't care to know Hagiwara deeper at that point. 

It's at the museum that Sei joins Hagiwara and starts to pay attention to him.  It's like the statue makes them sync with each other.
 The museum changes the way Sei sees Hagiwara. When leaving the museum, we see Sei's eyes track on Hagiwara and little by little he becomes enthralled by it the same way Hagiwara is and his interest starts being reflected in all his actions from then on.

Hagiwara definitely saw Sei in a sexual fashion prior to the museum encounter. He keeps giving him this smitten look and following him with his eyes, tracking his movements, being intrigued by him from the moment he lies his eyes on him. We see him start to become more like how i assume he used to be or wants to achieve to be. 

As the story unfolds Hagiwara become more straightforward and blunt in expressing his feelings and wants ( ""i wanna have sex with you"", ""i want you"") while Sei reverts back to how i  am assuming he has always been deep down, having his guard back up to keep from getting hurt.

 I love when i see this depicted in shows with such transparence and honesty. Having the characters do things that would make it seem as if all the progress that we have seen until now, all the build up and connection that we have seen happening has been for nothing it's such a realistic thing that can happen. It reminds me of Utsukushii Kare. Utsukushii Kare it's my standard in good  characterization and relationship growth.

Sometimes, love means saying sorry, regardless of who's at fault... if only to try to lessen that beloved person's pain...and i love Hagiwara for it....I love this series for how healing and comforting it can be sometimes.

I am familiar with Sei's tendency to pretend that he is brave, that he has all this under his control all too well 😢😭🥺

The last scene in ep.6  is  the first scene filmed by the lead actors based on the interviews. Yet viewers can feel the full emotional weight of what transpired between Sei & Hagiwara.

Absolutely phenomenal acting by Asahi Ito & Jun Muto. 💖

It all begins with rain,  then at a museum and it ends the same way. A  masterpiece in my book  😍",20,1740026196.0,boyslove,4,1.0,False

Idk if it’s controversial (most likely not even to warrant the word) but I just wanted to gather all opinions. Each season has a unique flair and feeling to it that I think makes everyone have a “favorite” season. 

I find season one to be the perfect mix of Frost and Lynch’s mind’s working together more than seasons two and three. You get a great structured mystery with intriguing characters, and each episode feels filled with something new that keeps you constantly engaged. The perfect mix of drama mystery (Frost) and surrealism mystery (Lynch) that makes it have a one of a kind taste, something hard to replicate. 

I think that falls in line to the number of episodes also per season. Having the short number of episodes felt compacted and filled in the right way where the absurdity and the haunting blended in each roughly hour episodes. It didn’t feel like it was trying to make time or catch up, it had a good on-going structure where each mystery solved unlocked another piece or character that built the world more. 

Again just my opinion and I could talk hours about all the seasons and the movie in particular about what I love, because I truly do love this series. Something just clicks with season one with me, I’m sure a lot of you connect with other parts of the series which just shows how great it is.

It's not much, but it's something I'm proud of.

So this happened in 2017, when I was newly working. Like any young professional, I loved being able to spend my hard-earned money how I wanted. At that time, I really wanted to get more tattoos. My company at that time doesn't have any strict rules on dress code so a lot of people with colorful hair and lots of tattoos work there.

The day after I got another tattoo, I got to work a little early and decided to have my coffee at the work cafeteria. I was sitting near the entrance and I was wear a skirt with my fresh tattoo visible and wrapped up in plastic.

I was listening to music, mind my own business when someone from a different department came in with her boyfriend and some other coworkers. As the song ended, I heard her loudly say something loudly and obnoxiously as they passed by me. She didn't say it in English but translated it was something like:

""Getting tattoos must be SO addicting, right?!""

I was shocked and annoyed because I was just sitting there, and it's not like I was the most tattooed person in that company. And since we work in different departments, I haven't really interacted much with this coworker either. 

It just seemed unnecessarily mean, and I'm pretty sure she said it thinking I couldn't hear her.

I found out from some of our mutual work friends that this coworker is known to be mean and gets jealous easily. That's just how she is, I guess. So I tried to let it go, but some time later when I found out she got tattoos herself and was bragging about it. 

I then went to the same tattoo artist and got a much bigger tattoo. And this happened twice. 

I no longer work for that company and no longer have to deal with her.

I used to think I was too petty for this because I could have confronted just her. But I decided to ignore it and get more tattoos instead. I'm okay with my choices now tho.",3,1740025845.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False
1itq3up,https://www.reddit.com/r/scaryplottwists/comments/1itq3up/whisper_in_the_bloodline/,Whisper in the Bloodline,"On my twenty-fifth birthday, my dad told me about a unique family tradition passed down all the way from the 17th century.

“Our family has a book that's been passed down many generations,” he began.

“The first entry was written by your twelfth great-grandfather Edward in 1655. When Edward was thirty years old, he hand-wrote a long, detailed book of wisdom and life learnings for his eldest son, your eleventh great-grandfather William, and gave it to him to read at the age of twenty-five. After William finished reading, Edward then instructed William to write his own life learnings in the next pages before he turned thirty, then hand it down to his oldest son when he turned twenty-five with the same instructions. William’s oldest son Harold, your tenth great grandfather, did the same.”

I listened in awe.

“Over time the collective wisdom of the books from each first-born sons of our ancestors were passed down through the generations,” He continued. “When the book was damaged during the Napoleonic war, your sixth great grandfather diligently restored the book to the best of his ability. By the time of the first world war, the pages were so worn that your great-great grandfather recreated it with a typewriter before passing the new copy down. When your grandfather passed it to me, that copy was falling apart, so I copied it into a Google Doc.”

He paused. *Comically tech savvy, but efficient*, I thought.

“Now that you’ve turned twenty-five, I’ll be sending it to you.”

“Wow, that’s mind blowing!” I exclaimed, “What other family has something like that?”

“Right? No family like us.” He smiled and patted me on the back, as he sent me an email from his laptop. “Read it carefully. It contains the wonderful experiences and wisdom from the youths of our past grandfathers. To carry on the tradition, you’ve got five years to write your own message to pass onto your oldest son, along with the rest of them. Might as well start thinking about it early.”

“Wait, I can’t write stuff in it after I turn thirty?”

“Afraid not,” dad shook his head, “Not sure why, that’s how the tradition goes. Each entry is an account of youth, written between the ages of twenty-five to thirty. We must respect it.”

“Fair enough.”

I opened the email with the link to the Google doc that dad had transcribed, containing thirteen generations of wisdom. The entries were fascinating and emotional. That night, I stayed up until dawn reading.

Edward, my twelfth great-grandfather who started our book, was a wealthy estate owner who lived through the English Civil War. I was impressed by his writing, even though I had to try and decipher some of the old English.

To quote, “*I commence this tome to chronicle the youths of mine sons. As long as they draw breath, I shall not meet my end.*”

I was sure my future grandsons would be disappointed at my entry after reading a banger like that.

His eldest son William, my eleventh great-grandfather, was similarly a hard-working tradesman. One of his gems of wisdom: ""*A man’s worth is not measured by his fortune, but by his steadfastness when the world shifts beneath his feet.*""

His son Harold, a soldier who fought during the War of Spanish Succession, seemed like the total opposite type to his dad and grandad. “*My dear son and grandsons, to charm a lady and shoot a pistol are but two arts of precision; both require a steady hand and a heart unflinching. For while bullets may fly true, it is the spark in her eye that captures a man's soul.*”

*He must’ve gotten all the ladies,* I thought. Unfortunately, it seems like I never inherited any of those pickup genes.

Each entry was as captivating as the last. It was as if I could envision the spirited youths of my grandfathers standing in front of me, speaking to me directly. In their stories, I discerned reflections of my own character and glimpses of their shared essence within one another. It was an emotional experience – they were all well written and captured the highest highs and lowest lows of their lives.

Well, all except for *one*. I was left confused by my fourth great-grandfather’s entry.

All my other grandfathers, my dad included, had written dozens of pages, full of stories, teachings and advice. But my fourth great-grandfather had only written one page. I couldn’t even understand the meaning of his entry.

“*He is the whisper that directs you to verity. Is it sagacity or artifice that you discern in his utterances? Not all connections possess the strength they purport, nor the sincerity. Your heart perceives more than your eyes are willing to acknowledge. Father-hood is a role most sacred. When the stars align, fate weaves its intricate design. You are the author of your own unfolding tale, brave and unyielding. Turn your gaze to the horizon, where dreams dance on the edge of dawn. Thirty echoes with the laughter of youth, yet whispers of wisdom draw near. You must delve deeper, beyond the well-known façade. Are you prepared for what lies hidden beneath? Next arrives the instant when your destiny shall reveal.*”

Perhaps he was trying to write a poem, I thought. I asked dad, but he had no idea what it meant either. He suggested the war made my fourth grandfather go mad, and perhaps those were his ramblings.

For the next two years, I periodically opened up the Google Doc and read through the entries, while thinking of what I would write in my own. I couldn’t stop thinking about my fourth great-grandfather’s entry. Like my dad, I concluded that it was most likely gibberish. Either he was trying to sound overly artistic, or he had really gone mad during the war. PTSD was no joke. However, my fifth great-grandad’s entry about his son, and my third great-grandfather’s entry about his father, my fourth great-grandfather, were both bothersome to me.

According to the context, my fifth great-grandfather finished his entry at the age of twenty nine, and had my fourth great-grandfather, his first son at the age of nineteen. He describes his oldest son:

“*As I observe my ten-year-old son, a quiet lad with a contemplative brow, I am continually astounded by the brilliance that resides within him. Though he speaks little, his mind dances with the complexities of numbers, effortlessly unraveling the most intricate mathematical conundrums that baffle even seasoned minds. His remarkable ability to discern subtleties in behavior and read the hearts of those around him fills me with confidence that he shall one day be a genius of great renown. I cannot help but envision a future where he is celebrated not merely for his intellect, but for the profound understanding he brings to the world—a light among many, illuminating paths previously obscured*.”

Basically, he clearly thought his son was exceptionally intelligent as a boy. Having read that description, I couldn’t help but think there was a deeper meaning to my fourth great-grandfather’s book entry, which seemed nonsensical at first glance.

My third great-grandfather describes how as a child, he witnessed his father, my fourth great-grandfather, trying to take his own life several times. A notable quote reads:

“*As an eight-year-old, the memory is etched into my mind like a scar that time cannot heal. I recall the day vividly, the sombre atmosphere hanging heavy in the air, as I witnessed my father, a man of strength and resolve, grappling with a darkness I could not comprehend. His actions, born of despair, unfurled before my young eyes like a cruel nightmare, shattering the innocence of my childhood in an instant. In that moment, I felt a chilling blend of fear and confusion, a child's heart struggling to understand how the very anchor of our family could be so lost, leaving an indelible mark on my soul that would forever shape my understanding of sorrow.*”

I deciphered from the rest of his entry that my fourth great-grandfather would have been about twenty-six at the time this happened.

After much consideration, I eventually came to the conclusion that the PTSD theory seemed to fit – perhaps he was a highly intelligent man struggling mentally around the time he wrote his entry, so it made little sense. But I could never shake the feeling that my fourth great-grandfather was trying to convey something deeper.

For the past five years, I had taken extensive notes about my most important life experiences and was finally ready to gather them into prose to complete my chapter of the family book. I took a vacation from work to visit my parents at their house, and to complete my entry, something I had now considered was to be one of the most important events of my life.

Dad came downstairs to find me typing away on my MacBook in the morning.

“Hard at work leaving your legacy,” he beamed, as he sat on the couch with his morning coffee.

“They’re gonna love this,” I smiled, eyes fixed on the screen. “It’s gotta be my oldest son I give this to, right?”

“That’s correct.”

“Well, what if I never have a son?” I asked nonchalantly. I wasn’t even married.

“Oh, you will.” He smiled.

I raised an eyebrow.

“Okay... lot of confidence you’ve got in me there.”

I took a break from typing to flick back up through the Google Doc for inspiration and found myself staring at my fourth great-grandfather’s entry again. I stared for a couple of minutes in deep thought, until the words were floating into each other across the screen.

My eyes started scanning the first word of each sentence.

“He Is Not Your Father When You Turn Thirty You Are Next”

I blinked.

I read the first word of each sentence again. Was that... a message?

After a minute, I realized it made some sort of sense as a message. I began to think about it. Was my fourth grandfather trying to convey the message to someone else who would receive the book after him? If he was, what was that message even getting at? Then it started to click.

My heart began to race as I looked at my dad, without turning my head. He sat still on the couch, watching the morning news. I looked back at the screen.

“Dad,” I said, my voice shaking slightly. He looked up at me.

“Yes?”

“Do you remember when I was about six or seven, you and mom would read me a story in my room every night?”

“Of course,” he said, after a pause.

“Do you remember *which* stories?”

He scratched his head.

“I can’t remember all those stories, that was a long time ago,” he said.

It was *Goodnight Moon*. I had asked them to read the same story to me every night for three years. There was no way he would forget that. I started shaking as the background noise of the television faded, replaced by the sound of my racing pulse filling my ears.

An unfathomable thought popped into my head. My mind pieced the jigsaw together into an unbelievable but logical conclusion.

“Edward?” I said quietly, without hesitation. My mouth moved on its own.

Dad stared at me, a surprised look on his face. Our eyes met.

His surprise slowly faded, and was replaced by a wide grin. He stood up and suddenly moved in my direction, then crouched down beside me, staring up maniacally into my eyes as he smiled. I was terrified – all I wanted to do was scream and run from this thing that was not my dad, but I was paralyzed.

“I haven’t heard that name in four and a half centuries,” he whispered.

All I could do was stare, sweat dripping down my forehead.

“You see, I like to know a bit about my sons before I inhabit them,” he continued, in a hushed voice, “I look back at my book of the last words of my sons, and sometimes I feel sorry for them. How oblivious they were.”

“W-what did you do to dad?” I cried.

“When he turned thirty, I unlocked his body. Then I simply entered.”

“The fuck you mean you ‘unlocked’… what the actual fuck is going on?” My voice trembled.

“I lived on through him, and I’ll live on through you, too. When you turn thirty, I’ll leave this body and inhabit yours. Don’t worry, it doesn’t hurt. You won’t even feel it. But you’ll no longer be here, which is a shame, so I’d like to keep a little memoir of your existence. You’d better hurry – wouldn’t want the rest of my sons reading an unfinished entry.”

My mind flashed back to a doctors’ appointment I had as a child, which I attended with my mom. When the doctor asked if I had any family history of medical conditions, my mom mentioned that my grandad, my dad’s father, had died young at fifty-two, having collapsed from an unknown cause. The doctor advised my mom that I should get tested for a condition called hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, or HOCM, a condition that can cause sudden unexplained deaths in fit people. The test came out negative, which I was glad about at the time, now not so much.

Dad stood up, placed his empty coffee mug on the kitchen counter, and made his way upstairs. I turned to look at him, his mouth still stretched into a wide, toothy, demonic grin as he walked up the staircase.

I snapped out of my shellshocked paralysis and promptly left my parents’ house, packing up as soon as dad was out of sight. My heart was in my mouth, and I couldn't catch my breath. Panic had taken over my entire body.

It’s been two weeks since the incident, and I’ve been awake almost every night. While the terror hasn't subsided, I’ve accepted my likely fate – that my body will soon be possessed, and I know there isn’t much I can do about it.

Mom will be alone soon, so I’ve spent some time making sure all my assets are assigned to her name. If my shrewd fourth grandfather wasn’t able to find a way out, I doubt I’ll be able to in the two weeks I have before my thirtieth birthday.

But I’m hoping someone will.

It seems like he didn’t catch onto my fourth grandfather realizing his scheme. I’ll write something generic for my entry, but I’ll edit my third grandfather’s entry and hope he doesn’t notice.

“*I have perused the prior entries in this book, and while each brims with remarkable wisdom, none resonate with me quite like my father's. A man of exceptional intellect, as my grandfather noted, his powers of perception are unparalleled. At first glance, his entry may appear muddled or the ramblings of a troubled mind, but I implore you to read it with care; the truth lies hidden within. It is imperative that you grasp its meaning, for your very life may hinge upon it. Though we were unable to find a way out, we are compelled to issue this warning, hoping that one day, one among you might find the path to freedom. I love you dearly. Your life holds immense value, and I earnestly wish for you, out of all of us, to be the one who prevails when the time* *comes.*”

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I'm very curious to know if anyone else has shared these fears and if they proved to be wrong? 

I worry that when we have kids the bulk of the workload of both raising the kids and maintaining the house will be left to me even though we will both be working similar hours..he works 36 hours a week (3 days) so has 4 day weekends and me 5 days a week with 2 day weekends. Already all the housework is totally on me, he'll see me loading up the washing machine with his washing and won't ask if I need help to check all his pockets. He literally came into the bedroom earlier today, saw me putting away his washed clothes, thanked me and walked back out. I also already book all appointments for both of us. 

He wants to spend his entire 4 day weekends on the couch watching tv whereas I want to get out of the house and be active, tv is something i do when winding down at night sometimes, I don't like watching it all day everyday. I want to give my future kids an active life where we go on little trips each weekend such as a little local hike or a camping trip or a day out exploring a museum or zoo however I've observed that my husband is a huge media person and despite saying he likes to travel and hike, in the year I've been here we've only gone for one small hike together. I'm the type of person who likes to keep busy, in and out of the house all day. 

I also worry about my husbands diet rubbing off on our future kids..for example yesterday he ate bacon for breakfast, coffee, hot chocolate, snacked on potato chips in the afternoon with two red bulls then a few bites of a food truck baked potato for dinner with another hot chocolate. I like home cooked meals and try to eat as much variety as possible. I'd like my kids to grow up eating meals without being surrounded constantly by poor food choices. 

I worry about my husbands weed smoking..he smokes in the house, heavily. I come from a country where weed is highly stigmatised and illegal so I am not too happy with the idea of raising my kids around a father who is frequently smoking and coughing out a lung. He wants a smoking room when we get our own place. I don't want a newborn to be cuddling her/his father who smells strongly of weed. Or kids who are curious about smoking from an early age. I just want them to have a wholesome innocent childhood with good influences

But on the other hand I do love my husband and he loves me, we get along very well and really enjoy each others company and we share future goals and plans. So I'm quite conflicted. ",1,1740025174.0,Marriage,3,1.0,False

Tell me all about her right now!!"" And I was quite overjoyed for you. Then you drew a bunch of stick figures on a receipt that were supposed to be some sort of puzzle I needed to solve, that would lead me to her name. I knew she was a semi-goth, former lesbian, and that she was cold in public, but ""normal"" in private. You were smitten, and I still don't understand the level of secrecy, even though I have a healthy amount of experience with your relationship with criticism, or the potential of.

I had to get going because I needed to go to work, but you walked with me in the rain to my car, and we held each other tightly for just a little while... locked eyes, getting lost in our connection for a moment, then you opened my door for me and says, ""Now git."" With that grin of yours I adore more than just about anything. Lol


I genuinely love these kind. They are in the majority. There is a small percentage that are very much different - and those are phenomenal, but we aren't like that. 


Google pinged me again about that one place today. Seems God or someone is letting me know to stay in touch. I don't need the reminders though - the chance that I'm not thinking of you at any given moment is quite small, love. I'm excited for us to be in the same place again, up to whatever suits us both. I enjoy being in the presence of the one safe person I have ever had, with someone who cares out of instinct rather than obligation. You aren't perfect, you do have flaws, but please pardon me while I show you that some bits of it are actually strengths. Anything that you don't like about you is yours to tackle, and I'll cheer you on with vigor the entire way. I'm here to hold your hand, and be the safe place to you that you are for me. This is one of the best kinds of love, and I'm so happy to share it with you, for however long we are here. ❤️",3,1740024978.0,UnsentLetters,3,0.8,False

You and I are sitting at a café, discussing our dreams of pursuing engineering at a top university. As we sip our coffee, the topic shifts to entrance exams. You mention JEE Main, the infamous gateway to India’s IITs. I respond by bringing up Gaokao, China’s national college entrance exam. Both tests are known for their toughness and high-stakes nature, but which is more challenging? 

That’s what we’ll dive into today. By the end, you’ll have a clear understanding of how these two exams compare. 

# Introduction to JEE Main and Gaokao

If you’re preparing for [JEE Main](https://www.learningroutes.in/exams/jee-mains), you know how stressful it can be. Every year, millions of students like you compete for a spot in India’s top engineering colleges, including the IITs, NITs, and IIITs. The stakes are incredibly high because your score can shape your entire career.

On the other hand, Gaokao is no walk in the park either. Taken by over 10 million students annually, it is the key to entering China’s top universities. This exam covers a wide range of subjects and is often described as a life-altering test. With so much pressure, many students and parents treat Gaokao as the ultimate measure of academic success.

Let’s break down the similarities and differences between these exams to see which one pushes students harder.



# 1. Exam Structure and Duration

**JEE Main:** When you sit for JEE Main, you’ll notice its three-section format: Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics. Each subject is given equal importance, and the exam consists of both multiple-choice questions and numerical value-type questions. You have three hours to complete 90 questions.

**Gaokao:** Gaokao’s structure is more diverse. Depending on the chosen stream (science or humanities), you’ll be tested on subjects like Chinese, Mathematics, English, and either Physics or History. The exam lasts for two days, and some regions even have subject-specific variations.

**Which is tougher?**

JEE Main’s time constraint often leaves you scrambling to finish in time, while Gaokao’s extended format and regional variations demand both stamina and adaptability. Both exams are grueling in their own way.



# 2. Level of Competition

**JEE Main:** The number of JEE Main aspirants crosses 9-10 lakh every year. Of these, only the top 2.5 lakh qualify for JEE Advanced, making the competition cutthroat. You may feel like you’re up against the nation’s brightest minds.

**Gaokao:** With over 10 million participants annually, Gaokao is even more competitive. University seats are limited, and the pressure to perform is immense. In China, Gaokao success is seen as the most reliable path to upward social mobility.

**Which is tougher?**

While JEE Main’s competition is fierce, Gaokao’s sheer number of candidates and societal expectations may tip the scale. However, both require immense dedication and mental toughness.



# 3. Subject Difficulty

**JEE Main:** Many students like you find JEE Main’s Mathematics section especially challenging. The questions often test advanced problem-solving skills and require a deep understanding of concepts. Physics can also be tricky, especially with questions that combine multiple concepts.

**Gaokao:** Gaokao’s Mathematics section is also known for its difficulty. However, the Chinese language section often poses the biggest challenge, as it tests comprehension, grammar, and essay-writing skills in depth. The exam is designed to test your holistic knowledge rather than just problem-solving.

**Which is tougher?**

If you’re someone who prefers analytical reasoning, you may find JEE Main tougher. On the other hand, if language and comprehensive testing aren’t your strong suits, Gaokao could be more challenging.



# 4. Pressure and Societal Expectations

**JEE Main:** When you prepare for JEE Main, you probably feel the weight of expectations from family, teachers, and peers. It’s often seen as the golden ticket to a prestigious career. Many students begin coaching as early as the 8th grade, and failure to perform well can lead to immense disappointment.

**Gaokao:** In China, Gaokao is more than just an entrance exam—it’s a societal event. Families invest years of preparation and sometimes even move to cities with better educational resources. The entire country seems to come to a standstill during Gaokao week, highlighting its significance.

**Which is tougher?**

Both exams come with enormous societal pressure. However, Gaokao’s life-altering nature and its impact on entire families may make it harder in terms of emotional stress.



# 5. Preparation Resources

**JEE Main:** India’s coaching industry is booming, and JEE Main aspirants like you have access to countless resources. From online classes and video lectures to mock tests and study materials, you can find everything you need to prepare effectively.

**Gaokao:** While China also has a well-developed coaching industry, Gaokao preparation is often more focused on school-based learning. Students follow rigorous daily schedules, with little time for extracurricular activities.

**Which is tougher?**

JEE Main may feel harder if you’re balancing coaching classes with self-study. However, Gaokao’s school-based structure may limit flexibility in preparation.



# 6. Personalisation in Education

**JEE Main:** One advantage you have with JEE Main is the option to attempt the exam multiple times a year. This flexibility can help reduce pressure, as you get more than one shot at success.

**Gaokao:** Gaokao is conducted only once a year. If you don’t perform well, you’ll have to wait another year. This can be incredibly stressful, as there’s little room for error.

**Which is tougher?**

The once-a-year nature of Gaokao can make it feel more unforgiving. JEE Main’s multiple attempts offer some relief, giving you a chance to learn from mistakes and improve.



# Conclusion: Which Exam is Tougher?

So, which exam is tougher, JEE Main or Gaokao? It ultimately depends on how you handle pressure, your learning style, and the subjects you excel in. JEE Main may feel more competitive due to its technical focus and limited seats in IITs. Gaokao, however, is a test of endurance and adaptability, with societal expectations adding to the pressure.
