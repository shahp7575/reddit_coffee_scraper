Second, the United States has gone downhill since we stop advertising cigarettes. If Joe Camel was still here, Donald Trump would not have become the president. That is a fact; not an opinion. 

Third, smoking cigarettes is cool. I love breathing in tobacco and tar in my lungs. In fact, it’s actually healthy for your lungs as your immune systems is always working against the foreign substances. 

Forth, if kids start smoking cigarettes, the education system would improve. It would greatly improve there attention span. Since we don’t believe that kids should have recess and we care more about punishing kids, we should allow them to smoke cigs in class. Maybe bring some weed and smoke some spliffs, you know to make that boring history class interesting (seriously tho who finds War of the Roses interesting, especially without weed and tobacco?) 

Fifth, this country has been straight up communist since we ban the advertising of ciggies. Joe Camel and the Marlboro Man represents more of the American dream than Donald Trump, Kamala Harris, George Washington, Martin Luther King Jr and so on. It’s absolute freedom to mix tobacco and weed. It is absolute freedom to mix hash, tobacco, and crack cocaine and smoke it. I should be able to smoke that in public and in front of your kids. It would actually help your kids if I blow hash, tobacco, and crack cocaine smoke directly in their face (see point above) 

Sixth, RJ Reynolds, Philip Morris, Altria, ITG Brands and the other major tobacco companies in the US did nothing wrong. 

Seventh, Jesus smoked cigarettes and drank coffee after being crucified. Ask any Christian historian and they will tell you Jesus was smoking American Spirit and drinking Folgers coffee in his tomb while doing double deckers. 

Eighth, Donald Trump had one of the worst 100 days in office in modern US history. Why? Because he’s not hitting triple deckers, smoking cigarettes, and hitting the vape in the White House bathroom. You want to know why Kennedy, Eisenhower, LBJ, Nixon, and Reagan were great? They all smoked tobacco. 

Ninth, tobacco is all natural. 

And lastly, cigarettes makes me feel good stop fucking telling me to quit. “Oh we are worried about you” “oh you smoke 3 packs a day” “oh you are coughing up blood and tar” can you believe these liberals? ",2,1745165407.0,TrueUnpopularOpinion,2,0.75,False

1k3pxms,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1k3pxms/female_friend_f26_i_believe_has_been_brainwashed/,Female friend f26 I believe has been brainwashed by male podcasters and has misogynistic opinions,"Anyone ever met a really cool person super similar to you who turns out to have really fucked up opinions which seem way off who they are as a person?

I don't know how to deal with this. My instinct is always to run when friendships get too complicated but I'm trying to be better at relationships. I'm chronically ill with PTSD so I have a very low capacity for conflict and even just disagreements. Its honestly best for my health to ignore it but I cant help but speak up at times.

She's someone who is generally very kind, undiagnosed severe ADHD imo (I have ADHD, but she doesn't think it's a real condition) she has a lot of mental and emotional issues from having a disabled bipolar mother and her father does all the responsible parent stuff, so I can see why she has such a positive opinion of men. But she seems to have an incredibly low opinion of women and honestly I find it extremely alarming and disappointing. If this was a man coming out with this stuff I'd block him immediately, but I'm in disbelief that she fully understands what she's saying and I feel like there is no way with enough life experience that she could continue to think this way about her own sex. For context I am 33, though I did not think the same way at her age. I addressed my own internalised misogyny as a teenager. We were both bullied by other girls at school but she seems to cling to this trauma still and hold it against women as a whole. She also is still bothered about being thought to be a lesbian (she dresses very masculine, we both do) which I find telling that she still takes this as an insult. 

The first red flag I saw was when a random bloke on the canal shouted at her to smile because she's beautiful and she lit up and said ""thank you!"" When I was mentally telling him to fuck off. I do think she is very naive and she thinks the best of everyone which is sweet but, also naive. She thinks I'm jaded, which I don't really deny, but I also don't think this man was simply trying to brighten her day.

Then we had a conversation where she described how women as a sex NEED men and her reason was that she was camping and didn't roll her tent up well enough to fit in the bag and a man came along and forced it in with brute strength, essentially saving her. Btw, prior to doing it by herself, she dismissed the offer of help from her female friend in a tone that implied her female friend would be useless. I actually laughed out loud because I thought she was making a joke. But rather than concluding that she needs some practice putting away her tent, she needs a man to come and rescue her with his strong muscles and that's why WE NEED men. I thought a LOT about this and made a couple of jokes about it to her to wind her up via message but she got really worked up and thought we were having a serious argument so I dropped it.

Next time I saw her at a coffee shop she made some weird stroppy comment very loudly about how she needs friends who agree with her opinions. Again, I wasnt sure if it was a joke because she said it in a loud whining childish way which was really embarrassing. I just sipped my tea. I haven't seen her since then though we have tried to meet up.

Then yesterday she posted on instagram a video of a young woman saying she is angry at women for constantly disrespecting men when they are the ones building their homes and cars, and that the sexes aren't and can never be equal due to our different biologies, which seems a massive leap to go from biological differences to equality. I had to say something because this just seems nuts to me. 

My friend seems to have this thing about how men are so hard done by because of women constantly putting them down and disrespecting them. I rarely see her talk about the injustices done to women, which actually involve things like violence, and once when I brought up the problems women face vs men, she said we have EQUAL PROBLEMS and that men deserve MORE empathy. I literally cannot fathom having any more empathy for men than I already do, when I have never ever recieved the same amount of empathy from a single man in my entire life that I have given them. I wanted to call her a pick-me so bad but I care about our friendship.

The thing is she's not totally unreasonable, she seems to accept some of my argument, so I dont want to flip out and say that she just blanket hates women. I genuinely think she just doesn't understand the real world and I know she's been consuming all these male podcasters content for years, so I believe her algorithm and consumption has literally brainwashed her. She also says that men do and will always do the tougher jobs because its ""in their nature"" and that they naturally handle stressful situations better, and are ""less emotional."" I can't say I know any actual facts about stress response in men vs women, but when someone starts to make claims about what is in either sexes ""nature"" is about to open a can of worms as it's almost always based on nothing but their own bias. We KNOW from scientific studies that for example, men and women are equally good at maths and have equal capacity for empathy, it's just that we are manipulated by a sexist patriarchy to think otherwise of ourselves. It seems obvious to me that men are equally emotional as women, they've just been told to shove their emotions down, apart from anger, which is okay.

I have spoken to my mum about this who isn't the most feminist literate person but she's had a lot of life experience and she said basically that my friend just isn't very bright. Which is probably true, but she is also a complex and interesting person, she's not a complete imbecile.

My question is, what would you guys do in this situation? Keep her at an arms length and hope that she wisens up as she gets older? Outright tell her that she's been brainwashed? My nervous system is fucked up from chronic illness so I don't think I could handle the latter.

She seems totally oblivious that she's shitting on herself and her own sex and honestly it feels like an excuse that she's arrived at for not handling life well, when her problems are due to other things. ""I can't help that I struggle with the stress of working full time because I'm a woman."" Is essentially what she has said, despite the fact that most other women do work full time. She uses her parents as a further example, even though her mum is disabled!

tl;dr: I think the ending is great, but I can sympathize with why not everyone agrees, and I think I see an easy fix for the emotional impact and narrative arc.

Caveat: Obviously, this is my take, influenced by my own literary approach to the game and some other theorycrafting I've read/watched, and you are under no obligation to agree with me or accept all my suppositions! I appreciate chatting about the story, and am happy to talk with people who have differing opinions.

Biases: I'm approaching this as a \~40 year old cis-het white dude. I teach Game Design (formerly English) at a high school, and I actually use Life is Strange as an example of excellent narrative design and how something so excellent can still have flaws.

On that note, here's why I really, really liked Bloom and Rage, despite a specific flaw in how the ending is conveyed.

**Narrative Design Lesson: The MICE Quotient and Nested Tags**

It starts with a lesson on narrative design (for anything, not just games): Whether or not the audience feels the ending to a story is 'good' or 'bad' is almost always about that key word, FEELS, and not about the actual bullet-pointed list of what happens in the ending. And one of the key ways to make a story feel emotionally satisfying (regardless of what that emotion is) can be found in the MICE quotient method, which covers how to wrap up the numerous plot threads of a narrative in a way that will FEEL good.

If you want, you can check out the first 11 minutes of this [youtube video from Brandon Sanderson's lecture series, guest taught by Mary Robinette Kowal](https://youtu.be/blehVIDyuXk?si=LeGtNNnzP83le_c2), both famous scifi/fantasy authors, for more details, but the gist is, plot threads in stories can generally be broken down into 4 types: Milieu (location), Inquiry (question/mystery), Character (internal struggles), and Event (external struggles). Stories rarely have only one thread, and so they are often interwoven and nested together.

The key to resolving them in a way that feels good is to ***do it in the reverse order you opened them***, so whatever you start with is what you end with. They are like nested tags in HTML:

<Milieu> I'm trapped in a maze!

\---<Character> I suck at mazes! I'm a loser!

\------<Event> A Minotaur attacks!

\------</Event> I've made friends with the Minotaur!

\---</Character> Oh wait, I learned how to solve mazes from my new friend! I'm not a loser!

</Milieu> I escaped the maze! Maybe with my new Minotaur bestie!

Which is why, for example, (spoilers for) Life is Strange hits so hard emotionally:

>!<Inquiry+Milieu>: The Storm: What is going on, and how do I escape the storm?!<

>!\--<Character>: Anxiety/can't make choices: I can't turn my photo in! I suck!!<

>!\----<Event>: Chloe dies in the bathroom: How can I save her? What can I do?!<

>!\-------<Inquiry>: Rachel: What happened to Rachel Amber?!<

>!\[\[The middle of the game happens! Lots of other little story threads open and resolve\]\]!<

>!\-------</Inquiry>: We learn what happened to Rachel.!<

>!\----</Event>: We discover how we can resolve Chloe being in danger.!<

>!\--</Character>: Max has the self-confidence make a hard choice.!<

>!</Inquiry+Milieu>: We leave the storm behind, regardless of our choice, because Max has learned the key lesson: you escape the storm by learning to live with the consequences of your actions, accepting that you can't control fate, you can only do what you think is best and own it.!<

In addition to being properly closed out, in the correct order to feel good, it hits like a BRICK because of the narrative weight and tension each of these threads had. When you start a thread early, it builds and builds and builds tension over time. The actual content of the thread's closure doesn't have to take long, which is why an ending being very short is often still extremely impactful; it's the tension of that thread finally being let go that makes the release feel good.

**Bloom and Rage's Ending**

I've seen a lot of complaints that B&R ""didn't resolve"" some amount of key content someone wanted, or asks players to ""do the writer's jobs for them,"" and that the end is just 'sequel bait' ala the infamous LiS:DE ending. I disagree with these premises, but I understand why someone might feel that way, and here's my thinking on that.

I personally enjoyed the end of Bloom and Rage, but the VERY end, the Swann-enters-the-Abyss-on-her-own stinger, is a moment that I think threw off the narrative tag-closing schedule for some players, because \*they felt like the relevant tag had already been closed earlier, and this was something new.\* And I think that is perfectly rational, and in an ideal world it's something that could be designed around (read on for my thoughts on how to do that).

For me, the stinger at the end read like the end of the very first story thread of the game, the <Inquiry> tag, ""Why are we here at all, drawn back to Velvet Cove, and does it have something to do with the purple-eyed raven standing on the hood of my car and lookin' at me like I owe it something?"", which is the first tag that gets opened for me. It opens when we first load into Swann's car, and look around, and have to get off the phone with Swann's mom, leaving behind a ""normal"" but boring situation for whatever is going on here.

This Inquiry thread was prodded at throughout the whole game. The very first dialogue option, where Swann can either tell her mom that not all stories need happy endings, OR can sympathize with her about being put on the spot, immediately made me assume we would be getting an ending to the current story that left Swann either unhappy or doing work to help someone else, or both. 

The shadows and ravens were a big part of it--lol @ shadows that are literally ""fore-shadows."" They seemed to be a supernatural link between the past and present. Dontnod tried to avoid spoilers by not showing us Adult Swann early, but by the end, if you had clocked that the shadows were always Corey, Kat, or Adult Swann, and that the messages left on the box, the swirls and graffiti in various places, and the note with lock solving instructions in the cabin were all sent by the supernatural force guiding people (which turns out to be Kat and/or Swann, with Corey trying to jumpscare the girls and stop them)... well, once we saw Corey and Kat enter the Abyss, I felt 99% certain Swann was going to dive in as well. 

But then, of course, the majority of the runtime at the end feels centered on the box itself... and the box is a tag that was opened just AFTER we arrived. That means it should indeed be resolved near the end, but also BEFORE we find out why we're really here. The story SHOULD look like this:

<Inquiry>: Why are we here? Ravens?

\--<Inquiry>: What's in the box??!?!?

\[Most of the game happens! Lots of Character and event story threads open and close.\]

\--</Inquiry>: We find out what's in the box!

</Inquiry>: THEN we find out why we're really here!

And THAT last point is what threw a wrench in the gears for some people. They felt like finding out what is in the box should have been the final answer as well, because so much focus was given to it, despite the fact that Nora and Autumn kept mentioning that the issue was really with what opening the box might reveal/cause, which would naturally be a continuing thing to deal with after the moment of revelation. 

And since the game seemed to be giving us our highly differentiated endings RIGHT THERE, with goodbyes and stat screens, those feelings seemed to be confirmed. It's a 'close enough' answer to say we were 'really here' to find out what was in the box, even though the real question is, 'why does that matter? Why was the box sent now, and what are we supposed to do about it?' 

And so some peoples' sense of the narrative felt abruptly cut off, leaving lingering unanswered questions.

But then those last answers were separated out into the post-credits stinger. Why are we here? To be drawn to the Abyss itself, and understand why Swann would make that choice. But that separation did some damage, and to some players made it feel like the game DIDN'T answer the questions that had been raised, AND was just setting up a new tag for a new story. It felt like JUST a question we have to wait for answers on. A cliffhanger.

And of course, that's what a cliffhanger is about; a situation that was never resolved, which almost always feels unsatisfying to some degree, at least until the next game/show/episode/movie/whatever is available to play. It's an unclosed tag that leads the audience to the next piece. Liking or disliking it is a personal preference, and I'd never say anyone should always be OK with cliffhangers--sometimes you never get resolution, and that sucks! (I'm looking at you, Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles).

**The ""Fix""**

Again, I loved the ending. I think it's awesome; but nothing is ever perfect, and I think the people who were dissatisfied could've been better satisfied with some minor aesthetic changes that don't alter the plot content of the ending at all.

My belief here is that many of those dissatisfied (not saying all, of course) might have been a lot more emotionally satisfied with the information given if the ending had just been edited into a continuous segment with a tiny bit of additional communication.

If the stinger happened BEFORE the end stats, and was tied directly to Swann leaving the bar (either on her own because the others left, or with her telling them she'd meet them tomorrow, and to find her at the cabin if she doesn't get in touch), and then following the Abyss' trail of moths/ravens, I think it would've worked.

For my ideal version of that, I think it would be something like: After the choice-determinant ending with whatever number of people left at the bar, and saying goodbye/let's meet up tomorrow at the cabin to the others if relevant, Swann would get into her car, seeing the moths and then spotting a raven landing nearby. She would brush aside the souvenirs/coffee cup/receipts in her car, and place the box next to her, plug in her phone, and then hit a button to make a call as we pull back and she starts up the car. 

We'd hear Swann's mom on voicemail saying leave a message, and the camera would follow her car as she drives out into the night, eventually arriving at an empty parking lot overgrown with weeds, Swann giving a voiceover the whole time. Swann would say she was going to be staying in Velvet Cove to help a friend out. It's really important, and she doesn't know exactly when she'll be home, but she'll still try to be there for Christmas (if you said that earlier)/she's going to be OK (if you didn't promise to visit). We're all going to be OK. 

Music plays as she finishes her drive and then walk through the woods, arriving at the Abyss as we hear, again, ""See you in hell!""

And I honestly think that this way, the exact same content would've felt even more geez-o, wowzers on point.",1,1745165182.0,LostRecordsGame,0,1.0,False

I proudly declared that I don’t do “mainstream” operating systems—“I run pure Arch Linux,” I proclaimed, “with a custom‑compiled 5.17.1 kernel, i3wm tiled with gaps and smart borders, and full ZFS encryption on LUKS for my home directory. All my dotfiles are version‑controlled in a private Git repo, synced across machines with Syncthing, and every little service runs in its own LXC container. I even rice my desktop to within an inch of its life using Polybar, pywal‑generated color schemes, and Nerd Fonts!” I thought I was the ultimate Linux ricer… until my wife slammed the door on me. 😅

It began when I tried to show off my “dynamic” i3 status bar. I had Polybar modules for CPU temp, GPU load, music playback via MPD, and even a live weather feed from wttr.in. I spent an hour tweaking the bar’s transparency, padding, and font sizes until my Gothic‑looking “12px Emperor” font was pixel‑perfect. I cinched my sweet leather chair, clicked a workspace switch, and expected her to be dazzled—only to see her roll her eyes so hard I thought they’d ricochet off her skull.

Next, I attempted to improve our morning coffee routine with a “fully automated” pour‑over rig: an ESP32‑controlled pump, a PID‑tuned temperature sensor, and a tiny touchscreen running a custom Qt5 UI on my mini Arch ARM board. “Press brew,” I said triumphantly. She pressed… and the whole rig chugged, spat, and sputtered out a shot of scalding sludge that tasted like molten steel. She spit it back into the dripper and muttered, “I’d kill for a normal Keurig right about now.”

Feeling confident again, I invited her to try my remote‑access masterpiece. I’d set up a WireGuard tunnel on a headless Raspberry Pi 4, fully containerized in Docker with a reverse‑proxy Nginx and Let’s Encrypt certs. “Now you can SSH into your work machine securely from anywhere,” I said. She tapped her laptop—and sat there confused while nothing loaded because I’d accidentally left UFW blocking port 51820. After another twenty minutes of frantic log‑grepping, I finally opened the port—only for her to sigh, “I just needed to get my email.”

The grand finale was my media “masterpiece”: a Jellyfin server running on an Intel NUC in a custom Alpine Linux container, using HW‑accelerated VA‑API transcoding. I’d even written a custom Plex‑like theme in React and SASS for the frontend. I pressed play on a trailer, and… endless buffering. Then an error about unsupported codecs. Then the TV locked up entirely, forcing me to reboot the NUC at the BIOS level. Meanwhile, she grabbed the remote, switched to the built‑in Netflix app on the TV, and yelled, “See? This just works!”

By Saturday evening, I had Prometheus scraping all my services, Grafana dashboards graphed my uptime, and custom Ansible playbooks ready to provision any new VM. I invited her to the “war room” (aka my closet‑server nook), fired up the terminal multiplexer with four panes, and declared, “Behold the power of Linux!” She stared at the blinking cursor for a full minute, then quietly said, “I’m going to stay with my sister. Their lights don’t randomly cut out, and their coffee maker doesn’t require manual driver installs.”

And with that, she walked out—leaving me alone among humming servers, flickering LEDs, and a sea of dotfiles that are now my only company.

**TL;DR:** Spent days ricing Arch +i3 with custom kernels, Polybar themes, smart‑home coffee bots, Dockerized VPNs, and a DIY media server… and got dumped because she just wanted something that “simply works.” 🙃",2,1745165119.0,linuxsucks,0,1.0,False

One thing doesn’t cancel out the other. Everything can exist at once.

Like, think about a Realtor on Instagram. He promotes his listings, sure, but if he posts a picture with his wife or a coffee he liked, nobody accuses him of being fake or “using” those moments to manipulate engagement. He’s just a person sharing his life. That same logic never seems to apply when I post something.

I created this Reddit account originally to promote a hustle—I’m a content creator. But I ended up using it way more for everyday things: asking for makeup advice, posting my dog, joining debates about music, history, whatever interests me. I love the platform, and I use it like anyone else would.

But from day one, almost everything I post is met with suspicion. People jump to conclusions, assume there’s a hidden motive, that it’s clickbait or karma farming. And honestly? I think it’s less about what I’m doing and more about how people perceive someone like me doing it.

So long story short: my sp broke up with me in February and I know we’re each others soulmate but he’s an avoidant so he’s constantly forcing 3D and giving me mixed signals like, texting me and inviting me to grab a coffee but then saying he doesn’t feel the need to reach out or doesn’t love me anymore (which I know it to be bullshit). We also have a house together which is a fucked up situation and it’s impossible to go NC for us. 

The thing is, I am aware that he loves me and that we’ll be back together one way or another. I am totally convinced he misses me and is constantly doubting his decision. And I know we’re supposed to live like we’re in the end and already have what we want, but no one addresses the fact that if you really love your SP you’re gonna miss them. Not because we lack something, but because we actually love them and miss sharing our life with them. I miss having him around me and just being with him in general. And when I get sad is always because I wish I could be spending time with him and I am not.

I am currently in the market to upgrade my beloved Bambino to a better machine.

I am not unhappy with the Bambino, it was probably the best entry to this world I could have had, and I love its convenience. However I am looking for something that will improve my espresso quality and, very important, consistency. The Bambino manages to pull an incredible shot followed by a mediocre one with no changes in any parameter. I am willing to pay for more consistency.

Some facts:

- The new machine will be paired with my DF64 G2.
- My absolute focus is improving straight espresso taste and consistency. I drink mainly medium/dark roasts but don't want to be limited to it in the future.
- Milk drinks are less important in terms of quality, but I still make like 2-3 drinks per day back to back for my family, so it should handle those without waiting an hour. 
- Depth is an issue on my coffee counter, maximum 45cm are fittable.
- I do not care much about automation features, but I would appreciate built-in preinfusion and shot timing.
- Budget is rather flexible as I am really looking for a potential endgame machine. Ideally between 1k and 2k€. Will go above if absolutely necessary.

As I need a machine that is capable of a few back to back milk drinks, while still giving me excellent consistency for straight espresso, my research led me directly into dual boiler territory. Heat exchangers seem to be more focused on milk drinks instead of straight espresso consistency and single boilers will probably bottleneck me too much, too early.

The machines that landed on my short list are the Lelit Elizabeth and Profitec Move. However I am unsure whether I should rather target an E61 dual boiler for longevity and repairability.

I was a shadow of my potential self.

Not today though! Instead, I woke up early in peace, read some short yet inspiring daily readings from 12-Step books, wrote an email on a daily gratitude thread I am a part of, felt happy that my wife was still sleeping NOT because I wished to avoid her but because I knew she was tired, enjoyed coffee over some simple and basic prayers of gratitude, planned my day in tranquility and with a calm spirit. Now, I'm awaiting a nice breakfast that my wife is preparing while I exchange texts and emails with friends and family, extending Easter greetings and/or just checking in. There's time for all of those ""normal"" interactions today AND for so much more. Today, I live with my soul, heart, and mind all fully in tact, not half-tied behind my back due to carrying the ball and chain of a severe and debilitating addiction. Amen! :)

1k3p9br,https://www.reddit.com/r/mindfulnesschallenges/comments/1k3p9br/dont_leave_anything_for_later/,Don’t Leave Anything For Later,"### Embracing the Present Moment

In our fast-paced modern world, it can be all too tempting to procrastinate. With a myriad of distractions at our fingertips, we often find ourselves saying, “I’ll do it later”. But as we repeat this mantra, we may overlook a crucial truth: later is not guaranteed. It’s essential to seize the moment instead of pushing things off till “later”—after all, life’s fleeting moments and opportunities can vanish before we even have a chance to grasp them. 

#### Later, the Coffee Gets Cold

Think about the simple pleasure of a freshly brewed cup of coffee. When we say we’ll enjoy it later, we risk letting the steam dissipate, the warmth fade, and the moment of indulgence evaporate. Just like that cup of coffee, the moments in life require our attention and presence. If we abandon the now in favor of the unspecified later, we might find ourselves missing the taste of life’s little joys. Every sip represents an opportunity to savor and appreciate. 

#### Later, You Lose Interest

Another risk of deferring our actions is the gradual loss of enthusiasm. We may commit to pursuing a new hobby or a passion project, intending to do it later. Yet, as time progresses, that initial excitement can wane. Delaying engagement leads to diminished interest, as our priorities shift and distractions arise. By the time we are ready to act, we may find that the fire that fueled our desire has turned to embers, leaving us uninspired and unmotivated.

#### Later, the Day Turns Into Night

Time has a way of slipping through our fingers. Our days can quickly transform into weeks, months, and years if we are not conscious of how we spend them. As daylight wanes, we often find ourselves reflecting on what we’ve accomplished—or what we’ve let slide in the name of procrastination. A day spent putting off tasks or postponing experiences can leave us feeling unfulfilled, stirring up resentment or regret as we realize how swiftly time has elapsed.

#### Later, People Grow Up

With every year that passes, we grow, evolve, and face new responsibilities. Our priorities change as we transition from childhood to adulthood, from students to professionals, and from individuals to partners or parents. Each stage of life brings unique opportunities and challenges, but postponing our aspirations and imagination often means missing out on formative experiences. Seizing the present allows us to embrace the shift rather than observe it from the sidelines.

#### Later, People Grow Old

Time waits for no one. We all grow older, and along the way, our physical abilities, health, and opportunities might wane. The vibrancy of youth may fade, and the things we once took for granted may become harder to pursue. By deciding to put things off until later, we might unintentionally tie ourselves to a clock that can only be reversed in memory. Engaging deeply in life today—not tomorrow—ensures that we create memories that will last a lifetime, notes in the tapestry of our existence.

#### Later, Life Goes By

In the grander scheme of things, life is like a fleeting moment, a flicker of existence in the vast universe. The dreams we harbor, the opportunities we are handed, and the connections we forge all exist within this limited time frame. Failing to act in the present might mean that we are content to watch life unfold rather than actively participate in it. Embracing life means understanding that every decision made (or deferred) directly shapes our journey.

#### Later, You Regret Not Doing Something... When You Had the Chance

Perhaps the most poignant realization is that flicker of regret. It’s the worry of looking back at our lives and feeling as though we’ve missed the bus; we didn’t hop on when we had the chance. The “later” mentality can lead to missed opportunities, friendships left unexplored, and experiences untried. Regret is a heavy burden, often felt most acutely when we notice how quick life is passing by. The best remedy for regrets is to act—dare to take that step, make that call, go on that adventure.

### Conclusion

Life is not a rehearsal; it is a fleeting, radiant experience meant to be lived. The best time to act is now. Don't defer joy, action, or connection for “later.” Recognize that every moment is precious, and challenge yourself to embrace the beauty of today—before it transforms into yesterday. So, seize the coffee while it’s still warm; create, explore, and connect while the opportunity exists. After all, life is too short to be left on hold for the elusive “later.” Embrace the power of now, and live a life filled with intention, purpose, and fulfillment.

I’d been driving an hour from Billings, the *Gazette*’s newsroom still buzzing in my head. Deadline shouts, stale coffee, the publisher’s voice going on and on about ad revenue. That was freelancing. Hardin was more difficult: two years at the *Big Horn County News*, chronicling county politics and life on the Reservation until the ink ran dry. 



At 28, I figured I’d earned a breather. Big Timber, population 1,600, sounded like it. Quiet. Slower. A place to run a small paper and not choke on the grind.



The welcome sign came up fast: “Big Timber - Gateway to the Crazy Mountains.” Someone had spray-painted “Gateway to Nowhere” below it in red. 

 

I eased my ’21 4Runner past it, the engine rattling. We’d both seen better days. 



Main Street in Big Timber rolled into view. It was two blocks of brick storefronts, a bar called the Rusty Spur, and a feed store with a faded John Deere sign. A couple ranchers in Carhartt jackets leaned on a tailgate, eyeing me like I’d just landed from Mars. Fair enough. In Montana, a new face was news.



The *Big Timber Gazette* sat at the end of the strip, a red brick building with a glass door and a sign so weathered the “z” was half gone. I parked, grabbed my backpack, and stepped out into air that smelled of sage and diesel. 

 

Inside, the office was a time capsule. There was wood paneling, a rotary phone, and stacks of yellowed papers. 

 

A note on the desk read, “Keys in drawer. Don’t break anything. – Ed.” 

 

Ed Larson, the old editor, had retired last week, or so the email said. No goodbye party, no 2 weeks' notice. Just me and a ghost town of a newsroom.

 

I dropped my backpack and flipped on the lights. A single bulb flickered, casting shadows over a whiteboard pinned with obits and a cattle auction flyer. The computer was ancient, humming like it resented being woken up. 

 

I’d seen worse in Hardin, where the power cut out mid-deadline twice a month. I was about to dig for coffee when the door creaked open.

 

“Ty, right?” A woman stepped in, mid-20s, blonde hair pulled back under a ball cap. Her jeans were patched and her boots were caked with mud. 

 

“Yes,” I said, straightening. “Are you the welcoming committee?”

 

“Clara Hensley.” She didn’t smile, just sized me up. “My dad’s got a ranch south of town. Heard you were taking over the paper. Figured I’d see if you’re worth a damn.”

 

“That’s a high bar,” I said. “I’ll try not to disappoint.”

 

She snorted, setting her thermos on the desk. “Coffee. You’ll need it. The town’s half asleep, half pissed off these days.”

 

“Pissed off about what?” I popped the lid, the smell of coffee hitting me.

 

“Take your pick. Beef prices are in the toilet, kids are moving to Bozeman, and then there’s *them*.” She jerked her head toward the window.

 

I followed her gaze. Across the street, a shop glowed warm against the gray. *Hearth & Harvest*, the sign read. A bakery, maybe, judging by the line out the door. Three women in long dresses and bonnets moved behind the counter, handing out loaves and pastries. 



The customers were a mix: a rancher in a Stetson, a kid with a backpack, an old lady clutching a purse. They looked busy for a Wednesday.

 

“Them?” I asked.

 

“They call themselves the Order,” Clara said, her voice low. “They showed up five years back and turned that old bakery into a cash cow. Now, they’re everywhere. The art gallery, the insurance company, you name it. Folks say they’re buying up land around here, too.”

 

“Sounds like a story,” I said, half to myself. Hardin had taught me to chase anything that smelled off.

 

“A story’s one thing,” she said. “Trouble’s another. Watch yourself, Ty. They don’t like questions.”

 

She tipped her cap and left, the door banging shut. I stood there, coffee cooling in my hand, staring at the bakery. The women in bonnets moved like clockwork, their dresses a throwback to something I couldn’t quite place. Amish, maybe, but sharper and more deliberate. A man in a flannel shirt walked out with a paper bag, glanced my way, then hurried off.

 

I set the thermos down and grabbed a notebook from my duffel. Quiet gig, my ass. Big Timber was awake, and it was already lying to me.",2,1745163324.0,Montana,3,0.56,False

Hello.

  
I'm contemplating buying this 60s japanese rosewood table, which seems to have discolored a bit (reddish) due to UV light exposure. Would it be possible to 'remove' the reddish look and to restore it to the color in the link below?

It's the cops. You pick up and start to speak and suddenly there's a huge bang and then an explosion. [Active live action cinematic] 

*Then sounds of more distant explosions. It's the downtown area. Something awful is happening. People everywhere are running. Cars are crashing. Sounds of police helicopters and police sirens fill the air. The ground is now shaking. Is that an earthquake? The air is filling up with smoke. Are those robots emerging from buildings? [Active live action cinematic - You've been thrown to the ground. <<Press RT or R2 on the gamepad rapidly to get up and continue repeatedly pressing X or A on the gamepad to run>>]*

*Escape, Hiraoka, escape and get the fuck away from  this chaos. Run, jump and use any mode of transportation you can. Get any car on the street (Sendai is full of vehicles) or mopeds or motorbikes or cars and get the fuck out of there, Hiraoka. Sendai is under attack!*


Mission 8 - *Find Yoshi and look for survivors*

Your phone still works and you receive a call from Yoshimura (""Yoshi""), a uni student you were supposed to meet for pizza and beer this afternoon. [Active live cutscene - walk and talk, free movement of camera during phonecall] He calls you and says he is trapped downtown, beneath a building.

Giovanni was dying.

Not in the literal sense – though several of the crew had filed preliminary incident reports under medical emergency (progressive internal collapse) and suspected psionic curse (culinary-based).

He slouched in the mess hall, a tragic figure draped over the table like a wilted opera tenor. His clothing – normally pressed, pristine, and tailored within a micron of precision – was dishevelled. Collar rumpled. Sleeves uneven. Buttons unbuttoned. Unbuttoned.

Tk'tchell hadn't even known humans could dishevel voluntarily. It was like watching a war droid melt.

Nearby, Vrix blinked a concerned shade of pale jade. ""My translator is malfunctioning,"" he murmured. ""I can understand his words... but the supplementary limb-gestures are missing.""

""It's worse than we thought,"" whispered Norl, clutching a tactical blanket to his thorax.

Giovanni groaned. ""I cannot... I simply... cannot..."" He pressed the back of his hand to his forehead like an insulted aristocrat and let out a sound somewhere between a sob and a sneeze.

He hadn't shaved. His hair – his perfectly shaped hair – was flopping in gravity-defying chaos. His necktie had been replaced by what looked suspiciously like a shoelace.

One of the crew leaned in to Tk’tchell and whispered with genuine concern, “Do you think someone damaged his... his dried grain sticks? The long ones he boils? I heard they are important.”

“You mean the... spag-hetti?” she replied, pronouncing it like it was a combat formation.

“Yes. That. He loves them.”

“He is in despair,” Tk'tchell whispered. “Soon, he will begin attempting to cook without garlic.”

Several crew members audibly gasped. One made the sign of their ancestral protection glyph.

And then – a noise.

A sudden burst of scrabbling, somewhere above. In the ventilation ducts. Fast. Unpredictable. Something metallic clanged, and a low, manic giggle echoed faintly before vanishing into the walls.

The crew flinched as one entity.

Vrix turned slowly to the ceiling, chromatophores pulsing with anxiety. ""That sound. It returns every cycle now.""

""Something lives up there,"" Tk'tchell whispered. ""Something fast.""

Norl looked around nervously, ears twitching like radar dishes. ""Wait... I thought Zib was in charge of tracking down any ventilation-based pests?""

Captain Xul'dran made a noncommittal noise and marked ventilation anomalies in his ship log for the fourth time that morning.

Mitch, meanwhile, had been watching Giovanni in quiet contemplation, arms folded across his chest like load-bearing supports.

""Right,"" he muttered. ""Time to break into the emergency supplies.""

That got everyone's attention.

Vrix froze mid-ripple, skin turning translucent with alarm. ""You keep emergency supplies?""

Mitch didn't answer. He just walked out, calm but focused – like a predator on a mission.

Norl stood up slowly, ears twitching. ""Should... should we stop him?""

Tk'tchell leaned toward the Captain, voice low and anxious. ""He's not even panicking. He's calm. Focused."" She swallowed. ""I don't know what's in the ducts, Captain... but I'm scared of anything that scares the big Terran.""

Captain Xul'dran's gill-fronds drooped. ""Oh no.""

The crew shivered as another faint giggle skittered through the walls like a deranged marble.

Then – footsteps.

Measured. Heavy. The stride of inevitability.

Mitch reappeared in the doorway, duffel bag slung casually over one shoulder.

He didn't say a word as he crossed the mess hall. Just dropped the bag on the table with a thunk that made Norl flinch. Everyone watched in breathless silence, waiting for the sound of a blade, a taser, a tranquiliser gun... something final.

Instead, Mitch unzipped the bag and slowly pulled out...

Something.

It was metal. Polished. Heavy. Covered in dials, valves, and a nozzle protruding from one side. It looked industrial – dangerous – ancient and sacred all at once.

Mitch turned one of the dials.

The nozzle hissed faintly, a sharp burst of steam curling into the air like a warning shot.

The crew flinched.

He didn't set it up at the nearest table. No.

With careful, deliberate steps, Mitch crossed to the far end of the mess hall – opposite Giovanni – and began assembling the device with the kind of reverence usually reserved for funerals and dismantling unexploded ordnance.

He was calm, precise, but there was something in the way he positioned his body – a side-glance, a slight shift of weight – that made it clear:

This was a controlled distance.

Vrix leaned forward, membranes quivering. ""What... what is it?""

""It has tubes,"" Tk'tchell whispered. ""And pressure valves. Is it for oxygen deprivation?""

""I think it's a Terran execution device,"" Norl muttered. ""It makes the death smell good so the others don't flee.""

""No,"" whispered the Captain, horror dawning on his face. ""It's a sacrificial altar.""

Mitch reached into the bag again, with the slow confidence of someone preparing a sacred rite.

He produced a small tin and opened it with care. A scent escaped – rich, bitter, intoxicating. It spread through the mess hall like smoke from an ancient altar.

Several of the crew gasped. Someone fainted. A maintenance droid inexplicably rebooted.

Tk'tchell clutched her chest. ""It smells... dangerous.""

""It smells... alive,"" Vrix whispered.

Captain Xul'dran adjusted his translator nervously. ""My olfactory sensors are detecting notes of... roasted carbon and madness.""

Mitch measured the contents with precision, the motion unhurried. His massive, scarred hands – hands that looked like they'd been forged in a fire and had punched their way back out – were oddly gentle as he lifted the grinder.

Chrrr-chrrrr-chrrrrr.

The sound echoed through the mess hall like the rhythm of a war drum.

He tamped the grounds, wrist flexing with deliberate force, biceps shifting under his faded T-shirt as though preparing a weapon. The portafilter clicked into place with finality. He turned another dial.

The device hissed. Steam coiled from the nozzle like breath from a sleeping beast.

He stood over it like a blacksmith at a forge – powerful, patient, utterly focused.

The crew stared in silent reverence.

Even Giovanni, twitching and fevered at the edge of the table, was momentarily transfixed. Where Mitch was muscle and mass and control, Giovanni was a creature of finesse and tension – a coiled spring, all cheekbones and fury. A gymnast in a slow-motion collapse.

And yet, now, he watched the ritual unfold like a starving man glimpsing the gates of heaven.

Mitch didn't speak.

He just waited.

The machine gave a low, bubbling gurgle – and the first shot of thick, dark liquid poured.

Giovanni lunged.

Like a feral vampire risen at midnight, his limbs snapped into motion with terrifying speed. One moment he was kneeling – the next, he was airborne, coat flaring behind him like tattered wings, a wild glint in his eyes and a snarl caught halfway between ecstasy and murder.

""MIOOOOOOOOO—!""

He hit the table with both hands, skidding to a halt, nose practically inside the demitasse.

Mitch slid the cup toward him without a word.

Giovanni snatched it. Cradled it. Whispered something in Italian that may have been a prayer or a threat. Then he drank.

Silence.

The room held its breath.

Giovanni exhaled, slow and trembling.

""...Dio mio,"" he whispered.

And only then did he say the word.

""Coffee.""

Life began to return to his eyes. He looked up at Mitch, bewilderment mingling with reverence. ""How?""

Mitch shrugged, the gesture casual but precise. ""Once lived with a bloke in Carlton, just south of the tofu curtain. Picked up a few things.""

Giovanni blinked, still clutching the cup with both hands. “This is better than some I’ve had back home in Naples,” he said, stunned. “In Naples, Mitch.”

There was a pause.

Several crew members glanced at each other.

Norl leaned in and whispered to Vrix, “Is Naples important?”

Vrix nodded slowly. “It is… a holy site. I think.”

Tk'tchell looked stunned. ""He drank the ritual offering...""

Vrix wept softly in admiration, skin pulsing with bands of reverent blue.

Captain Xul'dran, blinking slowly, made another note: Human emotional collapse reversible via bean-fluid rites. Strong bonding agent. Potential religious function. Investigate further.

Mitch dusted off his hands. ""Should hold him for a few hours. We're gonna need more milk, though.""

Just then, another metallic clang echoed above.

A small blur darted past the mess hall door with a screech of glee and a rattle of tin. The crew barely registered it before it vanished into the ducts again.

Faintly, a voice echoed from the ceiling:

""MY CRUNCHY TREASURES! THEY MAKE MY BLOOD HUM!""

Mitch sighed. ""Found 'em.""

Captain Xul'dran's head-frills elevated. ""Found what, precisely?""

As Mitch’s strange machine hissed again, Norl stared at it with narrowed eyes. ""I don’t know what that machine does, but I think it brews war.""

It started with a realisation, voiced – of course – by Norl.

""Hang on,"" he said slowly, eyes still fixed on the ceiling vent. ""If Zib's been in charge of pest control... and there's something in the vents... then either he's really bad at his job...""

""Or,"" Vrix said, voice low, ""he is the pest.""

Silence.

The crew looked at one another.

Then – chaos.

Chairs scraped. Panels were flung open. Someone shouted, ""He's small enough to bypass the internal sensor grid!"" and Tk'tchell screamed ""We're living in the walls with him!"" as she bolted for the aft corridor.

Mitch watched this all unfold with the slow exhale of a man who had seen it coming a week ago.

Within minutes, three crewmembers were in the forward crawlspace, two more were halfway down the maintenance conduits, and Captain Xul'dran had dispatched a formal report to Central Command titled: Emergency Search for Rogue Prikkiki-Ti (suspected culinary crime-related).

Norl squeezed himself between two bulkheads and shouted, ""I think I see something!""

Vrix, barely fitting beside him, squinted through a service grate. ""Is that... tin foil?""

Eventually, the trail led to an auxiliary power junction just beneath Hydroponics Bay 3. A narrow shaft. A heat-exchange fan. A hatch sealed from the inside.

And the unmistakable smell of coffee.

Tk'tchell pressed her face to the grate, eyes wide. ""There's... light. Flickering. And steam. Is that a candle?""

""No,"" Norl whispered. ""It's worse. It's scented.""

They forced the hatch open.

Inside the compartment, nestled in a half-collapsed heat conduit, was Zib.

Eyes wide. Pupils dilated. Claws twitching.

They'd found his nest.

Normally, this room was a death trap in miniature – lined with precision-tooled weapons scaled to Zib's tiny claws. Knives so sharp they made air part in apology. Cluster charges, chemical darts, and hand cannons the size of a soup spoon. A Nivlac would have blushed at the arsenal. A second Nivlac would have involuntarily spored.

Now, the weapons had been pushed aside. Stacked in corners. Forgotten.

In their place lay a glittering hoard – foil pouches of ground espresso, scavenged sugar packets, plastic milk pods arranged in a spiralling shrine. A caffeine-stained spoon protruded from the wall like a sacred blade. Shredded filter paper fluttered like prayer flags.

Zib was curled atop it all like a dragon on gold.

Mitch stepped into view – and stopped.

He recognized him immediately.

Zib.

They'd exchanged a few words. Swapped weapon maintenance tips once or twice. Not much, but more than most ever got from a Prikkiki-Ti. Mitch had even gotten a begrudging nod once after showing Zib how to de-carbonise a plasma vent without tripping the internal fuse.

And now he was twitching atop a caffeine shrine, eyes wild, muttering to himself.

Mitch's expression didn't change. But he did not step closer.

He knew the history. The Prikkiki-Ti were born prey, surrounded by predators on their homeworld. They had clawed their way to sentience not to thrive – but to survive. Their legacy wasn't one of conquest, but of extermination. Anything that threatened them, even slightly, didn’t last long.

And now one of them had been pushed over the edge... by coffee.

Mitch's hand rested near his belt. Not on a weapon. But near.

Norl leaned in. ""You okay?""

""I'm fine,"" Mitch said. Calm. But watching. ""Just... wouldn't rush him.""

Zib spotted him. His eyes sharpened.

""I knew it!"" he shrieked. ""You came for my crunchy treasures! But they're MINE. You can't have them! THEY MAKE MY BLOOD HUM!""

Norl stumbled back. ""He's gone feral!""

""He was already feral!"" murmured Mitch out the side of his mouth, his eyes never leaving the zoomies infested murder-gecko, ""He's gone barista!""

Zib stood atop his hoard, tail lashing, limbs trembling. He jabbed a claw toward Mitch. ""You want to duel for them, Terran? I accept. No milk. No foam. Just bean and claw.""

Mitch didn't flinch.

He took one slow step backward.

Then, without a word, he reached for the hatch... and calmly, deliberately, closed the door.

The lock clicked.

He stood there for a moment, jaw tight. Then turned, muttering low under his breath, and marched away down the corridor.

Tk'tchell blinked at the others. ""Did anyone understand what he just said?""

Vrix looked puzzled. ""My translator thinks it was a threat... but also a refusal... and... something about not fornicating with arachnids?""

Norl shook his head. ""Mine just gave up and said 'Cultural idiom. Threat level: inconclusive.'""

From behind the sealed door, a distant voice echoed:

""YOU'LL NEVER TAKE MY CREMA!""

I’ve got this bright orange Seiko SKX011 that I wear when I’m out running errands or grabbing coffee and without fail, someone always goes, “Whoa, that’s a cool watch!” Never mind the Grand Seiko or the Swiss dress pieces, this loud little diver with a pop of color is the real MVP when it comes to compliments from people who don’t even care about watches.  
  
Honestly, I’ve come to love it even more because of that. There’s something super satisfying about rocking a fun, affordable piece that gets people talking and starts random convos. It’s a reminder that sometimes a bold dial or quirky design is all it takes to turn a watch from just another accessory into a full blown vibe.  
  
So now I’m curious, what’s your unexpected compliment magnet? Is it a funky Swatch, a modded Seiko or maybe something totally random from your collection that non watch folks can’t stop pointing out?

(Part # 2)","**Greetings in The Mighty Name of Jesus, The Christ!!!**

 

**The Responsibility Of Prayer**

**(Part # 2)**

 

 

Last week I spoke on The Responsibility Of Prayer Part # 1 dealing strictly with Men, this week will be on Women and Children and the possibility of those who are Not Married, I may need to carry these over to Part 3.

 

Sisters, Beloveds of The Men, your Responsibility is more to your Daily Walk, the House and to the Children, regardless what Society says or the World may do or even what you may think. The Father Created You as the Man’s Helpmate, you are Not Equal to Man, with the exception of Salvation we are equal. Sister’s you Need, you Must come into Agreement with this, because it does Affect Your Household to the deepest degree, as I Hope and Pray you learn in this message.

 

**Genesis 2:21-23 KJV**

**""****^(21)** **And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;** **^(22)** **And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.** **^(23)** **And Adam said, This \[is\] now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.""**

 

This is an Absolute in your Life and especially with Your Husband. It will not change according to Society or the World, The Father set this in motion and only He can change it, but, will not! These Scriptures above Affect Your Prayers and Your Walk. Just as Man needs to Understand His Place and Responsibility Of Prayer, so do the Women need to Understand Their Place and Responsibility Of Prayer.

 

Sisters, you should begin Your Day in Prayer, in a Quit place, this will set the Tone for the Whole Day. You need to get out of bed and be Prostrate to Jesus, on your knees or laying flat on the floor. Keeping in mind that You are Approaching Jesus as Lord over Your Life, which means all of your Personal Prayers sets Jesus in His Rightful Place In Your Life.

 

Again, You My Sisters need to Understand Your Position according to God and His Scriptures…

 

**1 Corinthians 11:3 KJV**

**“But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman \[is\] the man; and the head of Christ \[is\] God.""**

 

**Ephesians 5:23 KJV**

**“For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.""**

 

I am Emphasizing this, because in every way it WILL AFFECT YOUR PRAYERS and YOUR WALK resulting in the EFFECTS of What You Pray. Prayer is Your Weapon and has been given to you By Jesus with Power and Authority unmatchable if done correctly.

 

Yes there are many whom say that it does not matter How, When or Where you Pray, throughout the Day this is correct to some points, but Your Battle begins as soon as You Awake in the mornings before Coffee, Juice or whatever, You, again, You must place Jesus First before anything else in the Morning, making Him Lord Over Your Life!

 

Let your Prayers begin in Thanksgiving for your Rest and Sleep, even if it is for only an hour. To both the Men and Women on this, I have Walked many, many times where I had No Sleep or very little Sleep and by Praising Jesus for whatever Sleep I get, it always seems that my day has been Extended in Strength to carry out my daily needs, because I Thanked The Lord Jesus for What has been given.

 

Now, Sisters, you start with Thanksgiving and Praise to Jesus, thanking Him for Your Husband and that he will be a Godly Leader in Your Home, both for You and The Children. Thank Jesus that He has brought You This Man to be Your Husband, for he is not just any man, but one Chosen By God, if and again I say IF, he was bathed in Prayer before time and You married the Right Man to start with. But still in any case Thank Jesus for your Husband that he will be a Good Provider to the needs of the Home.

 

Pray for his Strength to do what is necessary to take care of your Home, You and the Children. Pray that your Husband will have a Good day at Work and that Jesus would fill him with Peace, Joy and Love throughout the day.

 

Pray against any attacks that may arise during the day, that Satan have No Power or Authority over him, Praying a Double Hedge of Thorns around him and that The Lord would place Guarding Angles round about him that he may be Protected from harm and from Satan.

 

Pray that You will be a Loving Helpmate, that You will keep in the forefront of your mind the Godly Order that has been set, that is, The Father, The Son, The Holy Spirit, The Man, The Woman and The Children, in this Specific Order.

 

Pray that you will see to the Needs of Your Husband, in doing whatever is necessary in Helping Him be Head. This includes meals, laundry, taking care of the children, whatever the Need is that is Your Responsibility given by God and Your Husband.

 

**Ephesians 5:22 KJV**

**“Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.""**

 

**Colossians 3:18 KJV**

**“Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.""**

 

**Hebrews 13:17 KJV**

**“Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that \[is\] unprofitable for you.""**

 

I am again Emphasizing this that Your Responsibility Sisters, is that the Husband is Head as well as having the Last Word in The Home. Your Husband will be Held Responsible for His House, You and the Children, Jesus will hold him to this account, plus much more that you do not have, nor have been given. Your Husband literally watches Over Your Soul that it Remains Godly before Jesus. Having this at the forefront of your mind will Affect and Effect Your Prayers.

 

Sisters you need to make sure that there is Food to eat and Clothing to wear for both Your Husband and Your Children. Now Understand this, because of the Season we are now living in, doing certain task may be divided accordingly, but no matter How they are divided, You, My Sisters, will be Held Responsible for these things!

 

Here is a Power that you have for Your Husband, if you Do Not Agree with him, do not Fight or Argue with him, but take it to Jesus in Prayer and when you do, you must be Completely Open to whatever Jesus may say, KEEPING this one thing in mind always, Jesus will never, Never, NEVER go against Scriptures or The Holy Spirit. Which means, that Jesus will not go against any of the above Scriptures. But, if Your Husband is not listening to something that The Holy Spirit has enlightened you with, then, with Jesus being Head Over The Man, take it to Prayer, Jesus can change his mind if needed.

 

Now there is a Clause in this Prayer Request, the Clause is, that You, My Sister, Submit, Obey your Husband not matter what. Do not rise up in Rebellion, for this will hurt everyone in the Home. This means, even if Your Husband is Wrong, you must Pray in Submission that He Is Head Of The House!

 

Pray in Thanksgiving for Your Children that The Lord has Blessed you with!

 

Sisters you have a Responsibility to Pray for your children, even to the Fourth Generation just like your husband has the same Responsibility. The Father said He would visit the Iniquity or Sin of the Fathers unto the Fourth Generation. Now even though it says the Sin’s of the Father, this also includes Your Sins. There are things that are passed from Father and Mother to the children through genetics, it is not just diseases. This can include Traits, Attitudes, Wants, Desires and the list goes on. But Sisters, you need to Pray every day that any Sins from you or your husband be dealt with, that The Lord would help them in this area, no matter what it is.

 

Pray for their Friends, Teachers and Associates that The Lord would bring in Godly people into Their Lives. Pray for Hedges Of Thorns be placed around them and that The Lord would send His Guarding Angles to be around them for Protection against Satan.

 

Pray for their Future Wives or Husbands that they be Godly and Obey Jesus As Lord Over Them. Pray that they will be Compatible at least in 80% of their Lives. Pray that their Wives or Husbands Obey The Word and The Holy Spirit Uncompromised.

 

Now, Pray for your selves. Pray that you Will be a Helpmate to Your Husband, that you Will Submit to him as Head of The House. Pray that you will be a Godly Mother to your children. Pray that Jesus will Direct and Guide you to be a Godly Woman in all things and all areas of Your Life. Pray that The Holy Spirit Teach you in The Lords Word.

 

Pray about having Sex with your husband that both of you are satisfied, that Satan cannot have a foot hold of any kind between you two. Pray for intimate time with your husband.

 

Pray for physical needs in health or otherwise, always being open to what The Lord says, remembering always that Jesus and The Holy Spirit will never go against The Word.

 

Pray for a job, being only in agreement with your husband on the subject.

 

Pray for your immediate co-workers.

 

Pray for Safety in your travels, for protection.

 

Pray for Family, Friends as needed.

 

The focus of your Prayer will be on Family, but make Jesus First in All Things. In Your Prayers, you need to make sure that Jesus is being Lord over Your Life in Your Prayer Submission. By doing so, you are fighting unseen battles on your behalf and your immediate family. When you pray, be precise in What and How you Pray, even though emotions can be in Prayers, try to keep emotions under control and speak from the Heart.

 

Pray in Thanksgiving for your House, your Utilities, your Vehicles, your Food, your Health, your Job. Then Pray that All that You May Do or Say brings Praise, Honor and Glory to Jesus. What I do at the end of my Prayer is open my hands, palms up, surrendering all things unto Jesus, showing that I am not Holding on to anything, but that All Things are in Jesus Hands.

 

Take Prayer seriously, you are doing Warfare in many, many areas of Your Life and the Lives of others and Jesus Hears every word spoken.

 

Well, it looks like there will be a Part 3, that will cover Children and being Single.

 

**Amen and Amen!!!**

1k3oljt,https://www.reddit.com/r/alberta/comments/1k3oljt/building_community_through_shared_resources_and/,Building Community through Shared Resources and Spaces.,"Canada is really not a good shape to fight against terrif. Do not rely on any leader or any party. Do yourself to help each other and build communal harmony. If you want, you can help without any extra cost. One might be helping a bystander with your bus transfer, even none it there leave it at bus stop for a people in need. Another way to leave your empty can side of a garbage bin so other can pick it up.

Others as a small group might be:

**Volunteer Time:** Offer help at shelters, food banks, or community centers. Even small acts like helping a neighbor with groceries or yard work can make a difference.

**Skill Sharing:** Teach someone a skill—whether it’s cooking, carpentry, resume writing, or language learning. Knowledge is a powerful way to lift each other up.

**Lend & Borrow:** Set up a tool library or a community swap group where people can exchange useful items they no longer need.

**Support Local Initiatives:** Join or start a community garden, clean up local parks, or participate in neighborhood improvement projects.

**Offer Emotional Support:** Sometimes a listening ear, a friendly check-in, or even a handwritten note can make someone feel valued and supported.

**Transportation Assistance:** Offer rides to neighbors or organize carpooling to reduce costs and environmental impact.

**Help with Childcare or Elder Care:** Parents and caregivers often need support. Offering time to babysit or assist seniors with daily tasks can be invaluable.

**Spread Positivity:** Small gestures like kindness, encouragement, or even helping to shovel a neighbor's driveway can strengthen the bonds within a community.

**Organize Free Events:** Host book clubs, potluck gatherings, storytelling nights, or game sessions to build connection without financial barriers.

Community strength doesn’t rely on money—it thrives on care, collaboration, and shared effort. Sharing bulk products among condo residents can reduce costs and waste while promoting community bonding. Here’s how you could make it work:



**Bulk Buying Program:** Set up a system where residents can collectively purchase staple items like rice, flour, coffee beans, and toiletries in bulk, saving everyone money.

**Community Pantry or Storage Area:** Dedicate a space where residents can pick up and contribute items like canned goods, household supplies, or cleaning products. Even a condo unit of 50 residents can use empty cans and collect 100 dollars per month to distribute free groceries.

**Local Supplier Partnerships:** Connect with wholesalers or farmers’ markets for fresh and discounted goods that can be shared among residents.

**Fair Distribution System:** Use a sign-up sheet or online app to track contributions and ensure fair distribution to everyone involved.

  
The next one for a larger condo unit or whole community.

* **Repurposing Common Areas:** Transform unused space into a shared café lounge with seating and basic coffee-making facilities.
* **Community-run Model:** Residents could take turns managing the coffee station, brewing fresh cups, and maintaining the space.
* **Resident Talent Spotlight:** Invite local artists, writers, or musicians to showcase their work in the coffee space, adding more vibrancy to the community.
* **Sustainability Focus:** Encourage reusable cups and source beans ethically to align with responsible living.

- Aries rising

You are likely to be interested in sports

Athletic body, also (lol I noticed this yesterday if your Sun/Rising sign represents an animal e.g. Capricorn, Scorpio. You really do take on their characteristics (physically)

You like the air of danger and 'winning'

Can seem scary at times, but still attractive

Looks much younger than your age


- Taurus rising 

as beautiful and delicate as a flower garden that enchants with its beauty in the early morning with the sunlight

every Taurus ascendant I know has green eyes, round faces and a short stature

you can manage to be both elegant and strong

sometimes you hold grudges, but not easily and you are not usually a hot-headed person

they like everything that is 'comfortable'


- Gemini rising

thin hands, a lean body, an ABSOLUTELY ANNOYINGLY CHARISMATIC SMILE

you are intelligent and actually have a great visual memory and creativity, yes that's exactly what I mean

you tend to be indecisive because there is a possibility that you can be both affectionate and gentle, and also cunning and unreliable

you get excited easily, you get bored easily

depending on the sign of Mercury, you don't trust intuition, sometimes you find it ridiculous. you want to 'see', you are also skeptical

a thousand thoughts run through your head, sometimes people may find you 'hard to understand'


- Cancer rising

warm, approachable image

can easily establish emotional connections

intelligence is incredible (cancers are like that) because there can be potential for intelligence in every field. think math, visual, music, physics, nature, logic, intuition, emotion (i am a cancer sun lol)

physical touch and acts of service are his love language

so i will be honest. the most negative trait of a cancer rising (actually other cancer positions count as well, i am a cancer sun for example. but it may not be true for everyone) is that they are masters of using other people's ideas. that is why cancers are one of the most dangerous ones (especially if there are strong scorpio positions in the chart)


- Leo rising

thick and shiny hair, self-confident looks as if they are conquering

flirty af

fiery and attractive (no lie, especially women)

they are natural leaders and naturally lucky (somewhat depending on the angle of the planets)

they defend and protect their loved ones very strongly

they love to spoil their loved ones and be spoiled in the same way

they can receive compliments in every environment they enter


- Virgo rising 

almond eyes, almost like a small cat, delicate face, small features

well-intentioned and anxious

tendencies towards perfectionism and an obsession with organization

has a simple style and clear thoughts

sometimes appears judgmental

'brilliant mind, shyness that went unnoticed childhood'

""not symmetrical enough!""


- Libra rising

the embodiment of the word 'beauty'

being loved by them feels as light as floating on clouds

they have more trust issues than they seem

they tend to be people pleasers but they never like to be seen as weak, remember that Libra is the only object in the zodiac and this star always stands still

very talented and creative

they love all things harmonious and beautiful (they actually have an Aries inside them when their wild side comes out lol)


- Scorpio rising

EXTREMELY ATTRACTIVE, it's hard to say no to them

They are very cunning, very intelligent, their analytical skills are at their peak, they never forget

They are excessive in nature

Perhaps the two most important characteristics of Scorpio ascendants; they naturally love and deeply care about secrecy and privacy, but SCORPIO ascendant is twice as obvious as other Scorpio positions..and they hate it lol. Also, you can notice it right away because they have deep, soul-sucking gazes, a mysterious and mystical air

They live paradoxes within themselves, brave but secretive, soft but no, not weak, dark but misunderstood.

When you look into their eyes, you feel like you will never know what they are thinking, but remember that whether they love or hate someone, they are always behind you and they are aware of everything


- Sagittarius rising

funny, witty, attractive types found in every environment

an extra piece of information, Sagittarius ascendants are perfectionists but lazy, skeptical but hopeful

they are unrivaled in laughing out loud and making the environment happy all day with a smile

they are voracious and always want to know, learn, and travel. (Sagittarius positions are like this, if you have Sagittarius in the first 6 planets, you are always in search of something)

they go back and forth between ""everything has a meaning.."" ""NOTHING HAS A MEANING LET'S PARTY""

they tend to see themselves as right (sorry) and unfortunately when they get angry their words break hearts (it hits you like an arrow and doesn't come back out) but when they regret it, it's too late for everything


- Capricorn rising

(if they believe in a religion, of course) unnecessarily overly religious

their discipline, management style, honesty are great

their bone structure is prominent, they usually like to wear black, they always look older or more mature than their age

docile, gentle, understanding, funny types. they just can't stand stupidity or disrespect

if they get angry once, that anger inside them is powerful enough to burn everything down to ashes at that moment. that's why capricorns often suppress their anger. when they decide to get revenge, they are even more ruthless than scorpions

instead of hanging out with them at a bar, you can get close by talking about a book over coffee or having deep conversations on a night out


- Aquarius rising

THEY ARE URANUS CHILDREN, of course they have cute eccentricities and philosophical thoughts

""What is existence? Does existence exist? If existence exists, what's the point of talking about it right now?""

At first sight, you feel like 'there's something different about him'

A SUPER INTELLIGENCE, sometimes lazy, sometimes overly ambitious.. but strangely no matter what, he's very calm like a warm wind

They have the ability to understand what people are going to say before they say it

They really love their freedom (leave Aquarius alone with their weird thoughts lol)

You can never really know them


- Pisces rising

They look different in every photo

They are usually absent-minded, even as if they are not listening to you. Sometimes when you look into their eyes, you wonder ""are we from the same world?""

Especially if there is a negative angle, all problems related to water, physical/psychological diseases of unknown cause, tendency to think everything is their own fault, childhood exclusion tendencies

Prone to maladaptive daydreaming and derealization (*cough* Pisces Mercurys are like that too!)

They are highly imaginative, blurry, hard to understand, have very prophetic dreams, experience a sense of deja vu, have a wise character, are melancholic, emotional types. They are poetic and deep",17,1745161316.0,astrologymemes,18,0.87,False

1k3og4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestIndia/comments/1k3og4y/story_of_a_mallu_boy_who_fell_in_love_with_a/,Story of a Mallu Boy who fell in love with a Bengali girl,"Have you ever met someone and thought, “Fuck, this person is what’s been missing in my life”? Like, all your life you were just wandering around, not even knowing you were looking for them but the second they show up, it hits you. Suddenly, you’re like, “My life is going to be 10x better if they’re around,” and you’re ready to do whatever it takes to keep them smiling, because that smile? That smile is everything.

Now, let’s get some context. I’ve always been the lover boy type hopeless romantic, heart on sleeve but somewhere along the way, I gave up on relationships. The idea of love slowly faded, and I started using dating apps just to meet people. Nothing serious. No expectations. Just vibes.

I’m from a tier-2 city, but I’ve always kept my Hinge location set to Bangalore. I travel there often to chill with friends, and honestly, I’ve always had plans to shift there. Bangalore has my heart yes, even with the traffic. The people? Top-tier. And for an extrovert like me who thrives on connections, it’s perfect.

So it was November. I was in Bangalore with a friend who had an event, and I tagged along just for the ride. I was bored, casually swiping on Hinge wasn’t even paying attention when I swiped right on her. Didn’t think much of it… until she replied. That’s when I went back, stalked her profile, and suddenly my brain went déjà vu. I swear on everything, I felt like I’d seen her in a dream before. And yeah, I know how that sounds, but I’m being dead serious. It was this rush of emotions I couldn’t explain.

I tried to initiate a convo, and even though her replies were slow, I was replying in seconds double-texting even. For someone who holds a lot of pride, I let it go. I just needed to know what this was. Turns out, she’s an HR, and I jokingly asked if I’d land a job if I landed in her good books.

I had to catch a bus that night and knew I wouldn’t meet her this time. But we kept texting. She gave me her email so I could send my resume, even though the role wasn’t exactly what I wanted. Eventually, she shared her Instagram. I tried to play it cool and not respond instantly (even though I was literally staring at my phone waiting for her texts). And then one day… poof. Her Instagram was deactivated.

Cue panic mode.

My overthinking brain went full throttle “Did I mess up? Was it something I said?” And here comes the moment my friends still clown me for: I emailed her. Yeah. Emailed. I started it off with, “Please don’t think this is creepy,” and told her I just wanted to check in, and that it was totally valid if she needed a break from socials. The email was sent. Damage was done.

A day passed. Nothing. Then four days later, she texted saying she saw my email and thanked me for checking on her. That’s when I realized — she’s like me. Sometimes, you just gotta disappear because social media and people can get too much. She told me she’s not a text or call person, more of a “let’s meet and vibe” kinda person.

I kept trying to keep the convo alive, but it wasn’t really going anywhere. Still, I started seeing 11:11 all the damn time. And every time, I made a wish about her. I was falling. Hard. Even though she wasn’t giving me the bare minimum attention. Eventually, she gave me her number, and one day I asked if I could call her. To my surprise, she said yes.

I was legit shaking. I’d heard her voice through voice notes, but on call? She sounded different. Cute different. She was sick and had a migraine, but we still ended up talking about everything our pasts, her breakup after a 4-year relationship, work, life, everything. And the way she looked at life? God. That’s when I knew this is what I’ve been missing.

This Bengali woman had done kaala jaadu on me. And I was hooked.

I didn’t want the call to end, but she had to rest. I spent the rest of the night giggling like a lovesick teenager. My friends noticed too couldn’t hide it. I wanted to meet her, but I didn’t know how to ask. Still, I wanted to see her smile in real life. So I did what any impulsive idiot would do I booked a bus to Bangalore the following week.

Halfway through the ride, I texted her saying I was coming and that I’d got her my favorite snack. I offered to Dunzo it to her (hoping she’d say “no, let’s meet instead”) but nope, she played along. I waited a whole day in Bangalore, she still didn’t ask to meet. I caught up with friends in the meantime.

Finally, I texted her and asked if she wanted to meet. She said yes. We planned to meet after work she said she couldn’t stay long because her parents were coming for Christmas. I was over the moon. My friend helped me pick flowers for her. And I told my friend about that dream — how she wore a pink shirt in it. I said, “Imagine if she’s wearing pink today.”

And then… she texted saying she was leaving. My heart? Racing.

I remember the exact moment: December 23, 2024, 7:21 PM the first time I really saw her (even though I’d already seen her in dreams). The second I saw her, everything calmed. And then plot twist she was wearing a pink shirt. Just like in my dream. Destiny? The universe showing signs? Or am I just down that bad?

We shook hands instead of hugging (I hesitated, not sure if she was okay with a hug). We went to this small, aesthetic café. I pulled the chair out for her (gentleman mode activated), gave her the flowers and her my fav snack. Her smile? God, how do I even describe it. She’s 5’1”, round face, chubby cheeks, perfect teeth, and those eyes. You could drown in them. The way she talks with her expressions — my brain was like, “Yeh behenkilodi itni sundar kyun hai?”

I started taking photos and videos of her I wanted to hold on to the moment forever. She ordered a long black iced coffee (that ended up tasting like regret), and I got a hot chocolate because obviously, hot chocolate hits different on a cozy Bangalore night. I shared mine with her, finished hers too (bitter tolerance pro max). An hour flew by.

She had to leave, gave me a side hug, and rushed off. I stood there for 10 minutes trying to process everything. The ride back was full of smiles even my Rapido anna was confused. She texted me, “You’re cute.” Bro. Heart skipped a beat. I told my friends everything. I was on cloud nine.

Next day, I was heading back. I asked if she could meet again even just for lunch. She said she’d try. I decided I’d get her a sunflower because it stands for adoration, and I genuinely adored her. Got up early, dressed up, exchanged snaps with her, bought the sunflower. We met near her office. Gave her the flower. She said she loved sunflowers. My heart did a somersault.

We had soup (we were on a time crunch again). I walked her back to office. Gave her a hug. Watched her walk back in and felt this wave of sadness because I didn’t know when I’d see her again. As I was about to get into an auto, she called me.

“Wait.”

She came back. Just to hug me again.

I didn’t want to let go. Not now. Not ever. But her office security showed up, and I had to leave. Still didn’t get to kiss her forehead like I wanted to. I went back happy, but sad. Happy I met her. Sad I had to leave.

Boy do I feel awkward posting here, but you know, I woke up this morning, the sky was screaming with thunder, and I thought hey, why not? So here I am with an imaginary coffee writing all this.

**Intentions:** I've skipped dating for around 4 years now to focus on my job and saving for a house. I'm open to dating, but comfortable on my own if the right person doesn't appear. I'm only interested in something with longer-term potential, and I am monogamous.

\-

**General Info**

**Height and Weight:** 5'5 and about 153 Ibs

**Smoking? Drinking?:** I don't smoke anything, but will enjoy a glass of wine every once in a while.

**Religious?:** I don't consider myself religious, but I am spiritual. I consider myself an eclectic Pagan so I just kind of use whatever feels right. Happy to answer any questions!

**Political:** Left-leaning, especially where environmental issues and conservation are concerned. I gotta take breaks for my own sanity and I just do what I can in private so I won't be that vocal about it.

**On my childfree stance:** I have never wanted kids my entire life. To solidify this decision I was finally able to get surgery this year, and it went swimmingly! I appreciate the kids in my family and I'm down for being the fun Aunt but nothing more.

\-

**Extended Info**

I'm both an outdoorsy and indoorsy kind of person, and a bit of an ambivert who prefers small gatherings of people I know well over large gatherings of so-so acquaintances.

I work outside most of the year in horticulture, specifically with native plants to this region for the purpose of promoting backyard conservation gardening and wildlife habitat. I like hiking, as well as doing nature photography (I had a field day with this in the Galapagos Islands). At my future house I hope to create a certified wildlife garden that will probably be a labor of love for many years.

I'm also into video games, mainly a few on PC (Honkai Star Rail, Planet Zoo, Jurassic World Evolution 2) and more on Nintendo handheld consoles (Pokemon, Fire Emblem series, Story of Seasons series, Animal Crossing, Monster Hunter Stories, etc). I watch some anime but my list of series to watch keeps growing exponentially, it's a problem. The latest one I enjoyed was Sugar Apple Fairy Tale and now I'm collecting the novels. I like reading, researching new things, art (physical and digital), and tending to my houseplants.

My phone has over 6 days worth of music on it. I listen to almost everything, but my favorite singer since childhood has been Josh Groban, and I will always jump at the chance to go to his concerts. I missed him when he performed Sweeney Todd on Broadway. Forever mourning this loss. I've also been really into Smash Into Pieces lately.

Pets are very much on the radar for me; I've never had reptiles before and am planning on creating a bioactive tank for a crested gecko, and maybe a ball python later. I'm allergic to cats unfortunately, but this doesn't stop me from cat-sitting for my friends from time to time.

\-

**Looking For:**

I'm comfortable with a small age gap but mainly prefer somewhere between 26-32. Ideally you like occasional travelling and share an enjoyment of the outdoors. Smoking is a dealbreaker for me. Sometimes I get a little too focused on serious things, so someone that maybe is a balance of more light-hearted and easy-going would likely be a good match! The overall qualities I look for are kindness, a generally positive sense of self, thoughtfulness, things of that nature. I'm looking for someone to share a life of adventure with and make memories, that I could hike with at Glacier National Park or curl up on a rainy day watching movies with.

Location-wise I've had a bad experience with long-distance before, so I do prefer more local to actually be able to meet up in person, but at least within the USA is probably my limit.

\-

**Reasonable Proof that I Exist:**

[My natural hair color is a dark blonde, but I like to get it colored once a year. Also don't take note of the scar above my left eye. We can both pretend it was from a swordfight with a bear - don't ask me where the bear got the sword.](https://preview.redd.it/hkhbn98v60we1.jpg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21d773305cf099d61c6e6221cdd1a7b4a8547e08)",9,1745161109.0,cf4cf,0,0.91,False

1k3odsx,https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/1k3odsx/thrustmaster_sol_r_2_first_impressions_and_a/,Thrustmaster SOL R 2 First Impressions and A Question,"Hello guys,

Last week I asked what sticks to get to replace my t16000's I've used for 5 years. I ordered the VKB Fighters but then someone here mentioned the SOL R 2's and I seen they were releasing in a few days.

I cancelled my VKB order and ordered these instead. Did I make a mistake? I hope not lol.

Anyway, I don't have any experience with other sticks outside of the Logitech X52 and the TM t16000's.

My first impressions of this kit are good. The sticks are solid feeling but are plastic. They kinda look toyish to me compared to other joysticks in the price point but they don't feel bad at all.

The RGB is tasteful and not over done but I still feel the lighting is unnecessary for someone like me who plays only in VR. I can see it's useful for those who don't.

Buttons all feel solid and the sticks have less motion than the t16000m but still a decent amount. This is a pro for me personally.

I personally like the ergonomics of the t16000m better. These feel more like the X52 or how I can imagine the other top of the line sticks feel, let me explain.

With these, I have to move my hand a lot on the stick to reach the upper hats,, it has a very girthy tip (lol). With it being so wide, I just have to move my hand around more than I thought I would and I have a medium to large hand size. The 16000 has way way less buttons but the stick curves slightly forward so my hand isn't almost straight up and down like this. It kinda hurts my wrist after a couple of hours. With the t16000, I never had to move my hand from one position to reach everything and never felt discomfort. Hopefully that makes since. It's not a con, just a preference and something I will need to get to. Hopefulky, once I'm used to it, my wrist won't hurt a little after play like it did yesterday 

A con that was almost a deal breaker is the Dead zone in the twist. I can move it a decent amount before it starts to yaw. I'm used to that very touchy twist on the t16000 and on this, once I get past the Dead zone, it basically maxed out the yaw speed in elite, making fine tune adjustments kinda annoying. Like and on off switch, rather than analog. In windows, it looks right in the USB game controller panel, but in game, it feels off. This was almost a deal breaker too but at the end of the day, I was getting used to it.

Now, I'm not using the target software currently. I did use it with the t16000s. Even with the preset that TM has on their site, I am having issues with several buttons acting as if they are 1 stick making using the same button on the second stick impossible. One sticks binds show up as ""Joy##"" like it should. The other, when running the script, is macro'd to keyboard keys. I don't like this at all because I want use my own set of key binds, not what whoever made this script uses. It's made it a frustrating experience using the target software.

If anyone can help me understand how to fix the target software, that would be a massive help and I will buy you a coffee! I like controlling dead zones and stuff in there plus I wonder if it will ease some of my cons with the sticks.

Overall, I'm not unhappy. These are a massive step up from anything I've experienced before but there are certain things so far that... I'm not sure why they feel the way they do on sticks in this price point like big dead zones, ergonomics, and software issues. These sticks where made for ED and SC so I was just expecting them to be better in these regards.

Don’t get me wrong the tech is impressive having your lights, thermostat and coffee maker all controlled by voice? Awesome. AI recommending music, helping with writing, even spotting diseases? Super helpful. But here's the thing... we’re moving faster than we’re thinking.

The more connected everything gets the more exposed we are. Every smart device is a potential entry point for hackers...and most of us don’t even change the default password on our wifi let alone secure our iot devices. It’s like we’re building this digital house of cards convenient but fragile.

And then there's AI. Sure it's a game changer in cybersecurity, detecting threats, automating defense. But cybercriminals are using it too and they're getting really good. AI generated phishing emails, deepfakes, social engineering that actually works… It’s not science fiction anymore it's here.

To me... the problem isn’t the tech itself it’s the blind trust we put in it. We're so excited about the future that we're not asking enough questions. Who’s responsible when a smart system fails? What happens to all the data we’re handing over? Can we even keep up with the threats we’re creating?

I love innovation as much as the next person but we need to slow down and build smarter not just smarter devices but smarter policies, smarter security and smarter habits. Otherwise we’re handing over too much control too fast.

* **Family-oriented** and ready for deep talks over deeper coffee (or karak chai, if you’re local!).
* **Curious & playful** – Whether we’re gaming, geeking out over anime, or debating the best travel snacks.
* **Active lifestyle** – Let’s crush workouts, then crush pizza guilt-free! 🍕

**Chemistry Notes:**  
✨ While a genuine, **forever-ready connection** is my #1 priority, I tend to find pale skin and blonde hair to be the most attractive traits. I’m also into people who love staying active (think sunshine smiles and trail-ready sneakers! 🌞). But if we click? All checkboxes go out the window.

**Let’s Build Something Epic:**  
If you’re ready for lazy Sundays, spontaneous road trips, and a **serious, long-term partnership** that feels like your favorite rom-com (minus the cheesy dialogue… maybe), slide into my DMs! Distance is no barrier — let’s swap pet pics, weird hobbies, and see if we’re the missing puzzle piece in each other’s lives. 🚀",1,1745160627.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

**3x XP/ Drop / RP time windows** could be on random weekend or holidays. Alternatively on Sunny Sunday.

**(Reboot Exclusive) Unlimited Boss Runs!** An event where Bosses can be farmed for exactly 3 hours on a random day of the month.  Alternatively if interactive must be included, players could be given a coupon instead of a time window. And interactive would be like maybe 10 boss reset tickets.

**Overworld Bosses** like before with Pink Zakum, Big Cake, etc.

**QoL: Try Before You Buy!** Players can now Demo Classes in an instance With Dedicated Mobbing and Bossing Skills.

**QoL: Universal Cash Shop!** Would be great, but how would nexon balance out the loss.

**QOL: TURN (Most if not all) TOGGLES AND ACTIVES INTO PASSIVES mainly just boosters.**

**QoL: Sync Arcane River**, this is also the problem when it comes to switching mains/chars

The existing roommates have asked me to put: Male preferred. The ideal candidate is tidy, kind, respectful, responsible, doesn't bring the party home, basic roommate etiquette. Unfortunately no couples or pets.

The room is 17' x 9.5' PLUS a walk-in closet - you could fit all your furniture in here and still have room to make snow angels on the floor. It gets a great deal of sunlight during the day, especially mornings. (I'll leave the blackout curtains. You're welcome.)

The apartment:  
2nd floor walk up in a small three story, two unit building, 3 BR/1 BA in total with a spacious living room and kitchen with an island (I don't believe the guys are accepting any additional furniture into the living room)

The roommates:  
two incredibly laid back gentlemen, 25 and 42, one works in sales in Manhattan and the other is a male model. They're incredibly friendly but generally keep to themselves in their rooms 98% of the time. Neither of them ever cook with anything more than the microwave so it mostly feels like I have the kitchen to myself as well. (Gas range but no oven - we have a big toaster oven to make up for it)

The neighborhood:  
two blocks away from the 40th St. stop on the 7 Line, so getting just about anywhere is pretty quick - approximately 15 minutes right into Manhattan. The neighborhood is very quiet and safe, lots of families live here. There's a laundromat a few doors down from the entrance. The nearest grocery store is two blocks away. There are plenty of bars, restaurants, coffee shops, and gyms within a 10 minute walking distance.

Rent is $1025 per month plus \~$100 per month in utilities (depending on the season) and shared costs. (small things like TP and paper towels) There's also talk amongst the guys about pitching in for a monthly cleaning service for the common spaces but I don't have a number for that. Roommate is the primary lease-holder so you'd be in a month-to-month deal directly with him; typical stuff, give a 30 days notice and all that jazz. Move-in is first month's rent and a $2050 security deposit. ($3075 total) The room will come unfurnished, definitely available 5/7, but there is a very good chance it will be available as early as 5/1.

Post any questions here or PM me with a little bit about yourself (what you do for work, for fun, how are you in shared living situations, etc.) to schedule a visit.  
Sorry for the massive wall of text.

On Thursday, I had a weird and scary episode and I’m still not feeling fully back to normal.

Here’s the breakdown:
- I hadn’t had coffee in a while, but I started drinking it again recently. That morning, I had a coffee, a smoothie, and a couple of protein bars.

- In the evening, I went to the gym. Took a pre-workout supplement, had a great workout, then sat in the sauna for about 20 minutes.

- When I got home, I showered, then right before eating dinner, I mixed creatine with water and drank it.

- Immediately after, I felt a weird muscle spasm in my arm (it was back and biceps day) and then this wave of low energy hit me hard. I felt dizzy, weak, and unsteady on my feet. I had to lie down right away.

- I called a friend and eventually managed to eat some honey, drink water, and eat another protein bar. I think my blood sugar dropped really low.

Since that episode, it’s been hard to recover. My energy hasn’t felt the same, and I’ve been super cautious with my body. I normally don’t eat much in the mornings, but now I feel like I have to eat first thing just to feel okay. Friday and Saturday I ate more than usual, and this morning (Sunday) I woke up feeling good—excited for the day—but once I got moving, that same weak feeling returned.

I think it might be a mix of lingering physical effects and anxiety. I’m scared it’ll happen again. Even after eating today, I just feel wiped out and nervous.

Also: today I’m supposed to take my weekly injection, but I’m not sure if I should take it today given how I’ve been feeling.

Has anyone else experienced something similar? Low food, caffeine, pre-workout, creatine, and sauna all in one day—could that combo have shocked my system? I’d love any insight or similar experiences.

But how many of those products actually *deliver* on the hype once they arrive?

I thought it would be helpful to put together a **real-user thread** of the home gadgets that genuinely made a difference in everyday life. Whether it’s something small like an electric milk frother or a larger upgrade like an air purifier or robot vacuum - if it’s useful, smart, and not a total gimmick, it belongs in this thread.

# My Pick: COSORI Pro II Air Fryer

I picked this up on sale last month and honestly? Game-changer. I know air fryers are nothing new, but I held off for a long time because I figured it was just a trend. Nope - I’ve barely touched the oven since.

 **What I love**:

* Preheats super fast
* Crispy without needing much oil
* Easy to clean - nonstick baskets are legit
* Quieter than I expected
* Has presets, but also full manual control

I’ve used it for reheating leftovers, roasting veggies, and even making chicken wings that *rival* what I’d order out. For the price (under $100 during a deal), this thing paid for itself in two weeks of convenience.

# What Reddit & Reviewers Say About Must-Have Home Gadgets

Here are a few other products that keep coming up across Reddit threads, expert reviews, and Amazon’s most-loved section:

#  Eufy RoboVac 11S - Budget-friendly robot vacuum

* Highly rated for small apartments and low-pile carpets
* Slim profile, fits under most furniture
* Works quietly and docks automatically

# LEVOIT Core 300 Air Purifier

* Affordable and effective
* Helps with pet dander, smoke, and allergens

Every morning began the same way—with a gradual return to consciousness, accompanied by a relentless wave of dread. The weight of rejection felt suffocating, a heavy chain of inadequacies bound tightly around his chest. Each unanswered message, every subtle dismissal echoed like silent screams, confirming the agonizing truth he desperately wished to deny:

You are unwanted. You are inadequate.

But the ache wasn’t just loneliness. It was grief.

He had loved her. Fully, sincerely, terrifyingly. And she had walked away.

He had given everything—vulnerability, care, the rawest truth of who he was—and watched her shrink from it like it was filth. The rejection wasn’t just romantic. It was existential. A mirror held to everything unlovable inside him.

Now, each day began with a gut-deep mourning, not because of her, but for who he had been when he believed he was lovable.

Breakfast tasted of bitter failure, consumed mechanically without pleasure. He stared into his coffee, seeing reflected a lifetime of disappointments, each sip further embedding the bitterness into his soul.



# 2. Genetic Echoes

The commute to work was an assault on the senses. Crowded trains triggered a primal discomfort, bodies pressing too close, each indifferent glance stirring ancient anxieties. His heart pounded relentlessly, sweat pooling at his temples. His autonomic nervous system screamed warnings, the hyperactivation rooted deep within his genetic memory.

He’d read the studies—how nearly 95% of male genetic diversity had vanished over tens of thousands of years, a result of endless competition for resources, violence, and exclusion. Survival demanded constant vigilance, eternal readiness for combat. His genes remembered this clearly, even if his conscious mind yearned for peace.

But why, then, couldn’t he win?



# 3. Insomnia's Cruel Embrace

The nights were torturous. Substance withdrawal leads to intensified nightmares, dreams vivid and relentless, each filled with primal violence and terror. Tonight, sleep dragged him down forcefully into a familiar ancestral landscape—a battlefield drenched in blood and filled with anguished screams.

Unable to move, he watched as warriors tore each other apart, each face bearing his own terrified expression. They fought not just for survival, but for dominance and recognition, driven by relentless primal instincts.

“No peace,” whispered ghostly voices of fallen men. “Only struggle.”

And somewhere, her voice: soft, distant, mocking. ""You were never enough.""



# 4. Awakening to Terror

He jolted awake, drenched in sweat, heart pounding, chest tight with panic. The metallic taste of blood lingered, sickeningly vivid. He curled inward, shaking violently, unable to dispel the lingering horror.

He imagined her waking in someone else’s arms. Comfortable. Laughing.

“Why?” he whispered, desperate tears stinging his eyes. “Why can’t I escape this?”

Then something darker stirred.

Maybe she deserves it too. Maybe she deserves the cold. The silence. The pain.

The thought recoiled instantly, leaving behind guilt like acid.

I am a monster, he thought. And the monster lives in loops.



# 5. Fleeting Comfort

Eventually, exhaustion drew him back under, more gently this time. A rare, comforting warmth enveloped him momentarily, easing his tension. For an instant, he felt acceptance—soft, genuine, healing.

A fantasy: her hand on his chest, her voice saying, ""You are enough. Just like this.""

But reality twisted cruelly, warmth transforming to icy contempt. “Weak,” the voice sneered, painfully familiar. “Unworthy of peace or love.”

He woke again, sobbing silently into the darkness, feeling betrayed by his own mind.



# 6. Endless Cycle

Morning brought no relief, only resigned despair. Mechanically, he dressed and stepped outside, sunlight glaring accusingly. Each step echoed with ancestral weariness, a haunting truth whispered relentlessly:

You must survive.

But how do you survive when the thing killing you is hope?

He moved forward, carrying an unending burden, caught eternally between the hope for warmth and acceptance, and the harsh reality of genetic destiny.

And the greatest horror wasn’t the rejection or the nightmares.

It was the knowledge that peace was unattainable—forever trapped in the ancestral cycle of relentless survival.

Yet still, he walked forward, driven by instinct alone, because he had no other choice. Because men are made for survival, not for serenity.



# 7. Dream in Red

That night, he begged the universe for mercy. A moment of stillness. A flicker of peace. Something—anything—warm.

Sleep came like a trapdoor.

He stood barefoot in blood-warmed mud. The battlefield had changed. No longer chaotic, it was calm—eerily so. The sky above him was starless, the air humid, thick with the scent of sweat and rot. He looked down. Rows of faceless men knelt, heads bowed, stripped of armour, stripped of identity. Silent.

One of them looked up. It was his face. And then another. And another. Dozens. Hundreds. A thousand versions of himself stared, blank-eyed, waiting.

He wanted to run. To scream. But his body refused.

A voice, from behind:

“You’re the last one.”

He turned. A towering figure loomed—himself again, but older. Brutal. Stoic. Covered in scars, eyes devoid of illusion.

The voice continued. “They accepted it. The others. You haven’t.”

“Accepted what?” he whispered, throat tight.

“That peace is not meant for you. You are the weapon. You carry the memory of pain. You exist to run. To fight. And die.”

The loop of animosity started again. He clutched his ears, trying to drown them out, but its presence was louder than screams screaming silence inside his skull, echoing with truths too primal to ignore.



# 8. The Shattering

He wok,e gasping, convulsing. The air in his room tasted stale. Every inch of his body ached with the echo of lives he hadn’t lived but remembered nonetheless. His arms trembled as he held himself, rocking gently, desperate for comfort.

For the first time, he understood the horror wasn't in the nightmare.

It was in the familiarity of it.

These dreams were not fiction. They were memories. Not his own, but carried forward—genetic scars passed from every man before him who had fought, lost, endured. The tremors in his hands were echoes. The nightmares, the rejection, the dread—they weren’t defects.

They were inheritance.

He looked at his reflection in the black screen of his laptop. Hollow eyes. Pale skin. The modern man’s disguise couldn’t hide the ancient truth. We are destined to constantly fight, suffer and die.

And maybe, to hate those we once loved, in moments we most needed love. The audacity the self creates—to feel hatred toward someone else for leaving, to wish for their suffering, only to recoil in disgust at itself for daring to think something so primal, so cruel. It was a loop of violence turned inward, a shame that fed on its own echo.



# 9. The Quiet Violence of Day

At work, everything grated. Polite meetings. Digital spreadsheets. Subtle social games. All of it rang false. Every smile, a performance. Every ""How are you?"" a trap.

He watched his coworkers laugh and nod, their posture tense, their faces twitching with micro-expressions of fear, envy, desire, and disgust. All pretending. All surviving in their own unique way.

He wasn't alone in the nightmare.

They were all running. Just quieter. Just better at it.

He wondered who among them cried in the shower. Who stared too long at kitchen knives. Who fell asleep with YouTube playing, not out of boredom, but to drown the ancestral ghosts.

There was no way to know. Everyone hid it. Because weakness is still dangerous. Because peace, even now, was reserved for the few.

And love? Love was the most craved illusion of all.



# 10. Acceptance

That night, he sat on the floor. No lights. No distractions.

The question returned:*Why can’t I improve?*

But now, a quieter answer came:*Because you weren’t broken. Because you were forged.*

Everything—his hypervigilance, his dread, his obsession with being better—it wasn’t sickness. Those were memories.

He whispered, slowly:

His breath slowed. His jaw unclenched. The trembling in his spine softened. Not healed. Not freed. But finally aligned with the truth. He would never be peaceful. But he didn’t have to hate himself for it. He didn’t sleep easy that night. Just the illusion of peach, warmth and comfort is enough. But for the first time, the nightmare didn’t win.

He did.

Because he endured.

And that was enough.

*For now.*

Hi! I’m very new to this sub but I found it through r/povertyfinance. I recently graduated from a very good university in my field of work but i’ve struggled greatly with finding work since graduation. I have been financially independent for college due to 1/2 of a GI Bill as well as a car accident related non-insured vehicle accident policy payment amount. I’ve been basically able to live off of that for the last 4 years in addition to random small sources of income here and there alongside an internship. 

However as of July, my account basically hit rock bottom, but I still had to get a storage space for everything I cannot take back to my home such as large pieces of furniture. The first month was free, but since then I owe two months of rent to a storage unit in addition to fees. About a month ago I’ve started a coffee shop job where I get paid on the 20th and the 5th of every month making roughly $19 an hour, 25 hours a week more or less, but I’m still short from my total amount I would owe, and everything I own will be auctioned off on the 28th of this month if I cannot pay my balance by then. Ordinarily I would make closer to $23 but I do not qualify for cashless tips until I am done with training which isn’t for another week or two. I’d like to be in good standing with the storage unit, and be able to pay next month on time as well. 

I would like to structure a 2-3 term payment plan and I am comfortable paying up to $520 split up into payments. For further negotiations, information, and payment methods regarding this, please privately message me. Thank you for your help!",1,1745159070.0,borrowdeletes,1,1.0,False

So here’s what happened. On Tuesday, I got up early to head into work because it was two days before my maternity leave started and I had a metric fuck-tonne to get through. I got to the train station at 5:30 am, coffee in one hand and phone in the other, reading through overnight emails. As I climbed the steps, I tripped on my skirt and landed on my stomach.

After rolling over and realising I was covered in coffee, I picked myself up and went home to change. I was a bit worried, but honestly, it didn’t hurt. The most painful part was my skinned knee. I had a quick shower and got changed, but not before doing a quick check with a fetal Doppler. Not that you should rely on them, but it usually wakes my little girl up, and she gave me a few solid kicks which reassured me.

“Great, now to work,” I thought. I decided to drive instead of catching the train—mostly out of laziness. But halfway there I started feeling tightening, followed by a little jab of pain. I decided not to be a tool and headed to the main women’s hospital instead.

I was seen straight away by the loveliest midwife. After a CTG, they did a speculum exam which confirmed my cervix wasn’t preparing to boot her out just yet. However, they admitted me because the contractions were increasing. After some heavy painkillers, a nap, and about four CTGs, I was eventually discharged.

All good, right? Sadly, no. I’ve been contracting ever since.

Today, I had four hours of contractions every 2 to 4 minutes. I went in again, mainly chasing pain relief because these ones came with the worst back pain of my life. Again, the CTG looked normal, but the trace showed the contractions were just below active labour intensity.

My little girl was measuring small at the last ultrasound—her abdominal circumference was in the 4th percentile. So they called my OB, who now wants weekly ultrasounds and twice-weekly CTGs. Thank god I’m on maternity leave now so I can actually make these appointments.

They gave me some tramadol and sent me home.

I thought I’d share, because it looks like Miss Irritable Uterus is here to stay and I'm sure someone will experience something similar. Has anyone else gone through this?",0,1745158988.0,BabyBumpsandBeyondAu,0,0.5,False

A genuine connection. I’m not chasing labels or rushing into anything just open to something built on trust, depth, and presence. If it turns into a relationship, great. If it becomes a meaningful friendship, that’s just as valuable.

A bit about me:

By day, I’m a coder. I also have a master’s degree in nuclear physics and I’m preparing for my PhD which means lots of studying and a few late-night brain farts (GRE & TOEFL). Life can be intense, but I balance it with calm moments and simple joys.

I love long conversations over coffee, night walks, and getting lost in the quiet parts of a city. I prefer the hidden alleys where the real stories live.

One day, I will ride a motorcycle across Europe. The back seat’s open. maybe you’re the right kind of adventure?

Still planning my first tattoo, but first, I’m working on getting in shape. Got any ideas or cool ink stories? I’m all ears.

What I’m looking for:

Emotional maturity. Calm, kind energy. A connection where we can be real, not perform. I’m not into surface-level stuff. Just looking for someone who enjoys depth, curiosity, and the kind of quiet that doesn’t need to be filled.

Here’s where we’re at: [Google Maps Location](https://g.co/kgs/wZAyGZn)

We’d genuinely love your thoughts:

* How can we bring in more footfall organically?
* Any ideas for events/collabs/promos that actually work?
* Are there local groups, artists, creators we should reach out to?

1k3nio6,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1k3nio6/advice_for_students_and_early_career/,Advice for students and early career professionals from an experienced hiring manager,"Hi CS Majors,

I am a professional hiring manager with about 30 years of experience at innovative companies like Intel, IBM, Nokia and Blackberry. I know the market is difficult for many at the moment so I figured I would share my knowledge so you can become a top candidate.

**Your Resumes**

Firstly, please avoid sexual innuendos in your education section. The amount of times I have seen misspellings of  ""some cum loud"" or ""magnum cum laté"" is disturbing. I don't need to know what you did in your dorm rooms in College. 

Secondly, please stop pretending you saved baby Jesus from the wrath of Satan during your 3-4 month internship. If we are being honest, you probably just attended meetings and served coffee to your colleagues. I see so many of you stating that you helped improve performance or customer satisfaction by about 50% or something ridiculous like that. If that were the case, they would have hired you part-time at the minimum after your internship. I doubt most of you made a commit that the senior engineer did not reverse after you were done with your internship.

Lastly, please stop inventing clubs, programming languages and other things. Do you think I am really dumb enough to believe that there is a programming language called ""Go""?  Do you expect me to believe you when say you led a 300 student CS club in college? Back in my day, we only had 30 CS students at the start of the program and only 12 graduated. Many claim to do charity work or volunteer at the local puppy or homeless shelters but that is literally impossible since young people are lazy. 

**Your interviews**

Many of you are scared of some good-old fashioned office banter. Our technical interview process is done by me and a fine young lady named Jessica Kerr (she is an absolute smokeshow). During interviews, I would purposely force the office printer to print a bunch of nonsense pages and have Jessica stop the printer (I can't do this since I work from home). While she is gone, I ask the candidates if they would ""hit her out the park"" with a wink. Local students act shocked and international students were confused, probably because of the language barrier. Frankly, I am not surprised birth rates are so low for younger generations when you kids are too scared to talk about women at the office. 

There you have it, if you have any questions, feel free to write them under this post! ",2,1745158622.0,csMajors,5,0.56,False

I am a masters degree student in renewable energy and data engineering. I have a mechanical engineering degree and currently i am struggling a lot to study.

After i have finished my degree in ME, I have started working in a company and after staying there for around 6 months I have moved to a diffrent country where I am doing my masters degree now.

During this period I had a lot going on in every aspect of my life. loss of a family member, bunch of personal issues, end of a very long relationship, working in horrible and very demanding, physical jobs to start a new life in a new country. 

I had a very long depression and a lot of problems in my personal life and moving to a new country was a huge stress by itself for not speaking the language, beurocracy, isolation and a lot more. 

Then after starting my masters degree I have found a nice part time job as an engineer and im earning well and my life is improving but i still feel burned out and cant get myself to concentrate on work or studying. 

My job is also relatively demanding and being a mechanical engineer I am having a lot of difficulties catching up with my course material since there is a lot of subjects of advenced electrical engineering and other stuff that I am not interested and familiar with. 

The degree was 3 semesters long but the first 2 semester I passed just a few lectures and now my company is pressuring me to finish already. I got like 8 lectures to pass and then I will write my thesis and be done with it but I am really strugling to focus.

I am sitting down to study and just end up staring at the papers. And with some lectures I dont even know where to begin. Also the lectures are not really helpful because professors are either just explain bunch of theory or trivial information that doesnt help you solve the exam questions at all or they are already too advenced subjects in other branches that im not familiar with.

After many disasters in my life now im in a better situation and doing better mentally but even if i try to do some other stuff to relax a bit to increase my efficiency I just feel too guilty to  enjoy them as well. I end up chainsmoking and drinking 20 cups of coffee just staring at the tasks at hand.

I have no option to quit or take a rest right now so I just need to get my shit together this last few months and pass my exams. 

Do you guys have any tips for getting yourself to study and studying topics that you have zero idea about? ",5,1745158561.0,EngineeringStudents,5,1.0,False

We are feeling grateful for the fire department’s quick response putting out the fire, and their helpfulness after the fire. I know ‘it’s their job’, but want to show appreciation. Is that ok? What would be a good offering? An assortment of coffee? Gift card to local grocery store? I make homemade sourdough bread - would they also accept a few loaves, or is that too weird/questionable? 

Thanks for any tips. Everyone is still processing, but all the kids found a temporary place to stay while they sort out new housing. Red Cross was helpful, too. Still trying to get the smoke out of all the clothing (no luck yet, but keeping on with Google as my guide) though the furniture is of course a loss. 

Also - big thanks to all of you for what you do every day. I know of several parents in particular who are also feeling extra grateful you all exist.

Whenever there’s something in the cup holder, I smash my fingers in 1st, 3rd and 5th. 

For now, I’m slipping the coffee into a car organizer that I have strapped on the passenger seat, but I’m just waiting for the coffee to spill. It has cup holders, but my Contigos don’t fit. A lot of the slide-out cup inserts are taller than the cup holder and look like they might cause the same issue. Anyone have a solution that they like? Thanks in advance.

I've been posting about considering the X8 since two months ago. After watching some reviews on YouTube and Vacuum Wars, I finally pulled the trigger. Been using it for about two weeks now, and here’s my take so far.

Pros:  
Mopping is nice – Can clean the coffee spill and ketchup stain well. What I like the most is it won't leave a dirty line like what my old roomba's mop pad did.  
Control's smooth - As a smart home geek, it feels nice to start the robot via the app. Some times I just need to say “hey Yiko, clean the carpet” and let it do its thing.  
Self-cleaning - I’ve run it 4 times. Checked it yesterday, brushes, roller mop, dustbin and docking station all looked relatively clean. 

Cons:  
Can’t get over my 4cm patio bump, but it’s fine with the shorter step into the living room.  
It was packed so tight, took me a while to get everything out of the box lmao.

Still early days, I’ll keep an eye on how well it holds up over time. If there’s anything you want me to try out, just let me know!",2,1745158448.0,ecovacs,4,1.0,False
