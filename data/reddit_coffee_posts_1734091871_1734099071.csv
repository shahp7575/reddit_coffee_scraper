1hdcwq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1hdcwq1/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

1hdctto,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1hdctto/social_media_manager/,Social Media Manager,"Finding local businesses in need of social media help can feel a bit like hunting for treasure. Sometimes, the best gems are hidden in plain sight, just waiting for someone like you to swoop in and give them a little polish. Here are some strategies to unearth these opportunities, along with some handy tools to make the process smoother than a well-crafted Instagram story.

**1. Networking Events:** Start by attending local business networking events. It’s almost like speed dating but with a way higher chance of landing a gig. Strike up conversations, ask questions, and listen attentively. More often than not, you’ll find businesses struggling to keep up with their social media presence. It’s a golden opportunity to swoop in and offer your expertise.

**2. Local Business Directories:** Websites like Yelp or Google My Business can be your new best friends here. Take a walk down the digital avenues, and look for businesses without a social media presence or those with infrequent, outdated posts. Those dusty spots are begging for a revival. Additionally, local chambers of commerce often have directories—these can be great hunting grounds for potential clients.

**3. Social Media Quotes from Locals:** You’d be surprised how many times a business will mention looking for social media help in their posts or comment threads. Monitor local discussion groups or community pages on platforms like Facebook. When someone says, “Hey, does anyone know how to do Instagram?” you can be that friendly guiding hand.

**4. Local Maker & Artisan Markets:** Visit your local markets or fairs, where small businesses and artisans showcase their work. Many of them are passionate about their products but might not know how to effectively market them online. Share a friendly word, and who knows? You may end up with a client over a cup of artisanal coffee.

Now, let’s talk about the nitty-gritty of making those social media dreams fly with the right tools at your disposal. 

**Content Creation Tools:**
- **Canva:** This is a game-changer. With a library filled with templates for social media graphics, posts, and even stories, it’s hard to go wrong. Simply drag, drop, and—voila—snazzy content ready to go! Plus, they have a free version that’s packed with features. 
- **Adobe Spark:** A little splash of creativity goes a long way, and Adobe Spark helps you create eye-catching visuals for your content without needing a degree in graphic design.
- **Loom:** Sometimes a quick video can say more than a thousand words. Loom allows you to share your screen and record personalized video messages—a fantastic option for engaging content!

**Scheduling Platforms:**
- **Buffer:** This platform is straightforward and user-friendly. Schedule your posts in advance, get insights into how they’re performing, and manage multiple accounts without feeling like you're juggling flaming torches. It’s the kind of tool that gives you peace of mind as you sip your coffee and feel like a social media wizard.
- **Hootsuite:** If you’re ready to wave your wand like a pro, Hootsuite’s got your back. It offers robust analytics, scheduling options, and even has a feature for curating content. Plus, you can manage multiple social media channels in one place—it's like your central command for all things social.

Feeling equipped yet? Don’t forget—this journey is not just about getting a paycheck but connecting with people, building relationships, and helping others share their stories. So, dive in, be the social media hero your local businesses didn’t know they needed, and watch those pages blossom like spring flowers.

Recently, I’ve been dedicating my efforts to refining a comprehensive framework I call the **Neural Nexus Strategy**, aimed at optimizing digital performance and driving revenue growth for small to medium-sized enterprises.

The strategy has allowed me to work across diverse industries, including the coffee sector, sports retail, Web3 ventures, and the automotive industry, helping businesses uncover growth opportunities they might have previously overlooked.

I’ve applied this strategy to several businesses with impressive results. For instance, a local restaurant saw a 30% increase in reservations and improved online reviews within just two weeks. A sports equipment store experienced a 5% rise in online inquiries and sales, while an car rent franchise noted a significant boost in customer engagement and lead generation after streamlining their digital touchpoints but this isn't enough actually and there is a lot of work to do.

Now, I’m looking to collaborate with up to five forward-thinking business owners who are interested in a complimentary digital audit. This involves a detailed review of current digital strategies, followed by tailored recommendations to enhance online performance. In return, I’d appreciate honest feedback on the impact of these suggestions, which will help refine the Neural Nexus Strategy further.

There’s no financial commitment or obligation—just an opportunity to gain expert insights and explore potential growth avenues for your business. If you’re interested in discovering how strategic digital optimization can propel your business forward, please comment below or send me a direct message. Additionally, if you have any cases to share or experiences related to digital strategies and business growth, I would be more than happy to hear about them.

Straight to the point, she's just not the way she was when we initially got into the relationship. Recently we had this event in college and we clicked so many pictures and a lot of couply onces too. And she posted so many pictures of her and her other friends but only one small picture where we were standing far away. And I genuinely felt kinda sad and when I tried telling her about this she told me that she doesn't want her relatives on ig to know about us, which I totally understood but I asked her why is it that it's only and only with me and nobody else? As in she posts pictures of her and her other guy friends where they're standing close and there have been occasions where people have misunderstood them as her boyfriends and asked her too. But when we go out she has never posted a picture of us. And even when she does post something of ours it's usually just one tiny picture where we're standing far away in a collage between all other pictures with her other friends.  
  
And untill now in the past 3 years she has never skipped a class to hang out with me or done something out of the blue, I even gave her a cute ""rescue pass"" to get her out a boring class but when it comes to her friends she just bunks class cas one of her guy friend's girlfriend broke up and they all wanted to be there for him. She bunks classes cas friends just randomly ask her to. But with me she always has some reason regarding attendance. And most of the time when she does ask to meet up it's cas she is free and it's either we meet or she straight away goes home, she doesn't wait for my class to get over so we can hangout for a while. When I told her I felt bad about this her reply was I won't post anything from now on, it's like she didn't even try to understand how I'm feeling.  
  
She wasn't like this initially, she was this cheery person who actually wanted to be with me and spend time with me. But now it's more like she's just living her live and I'm just another person in her life.  
And recently she has just been forgetting a lot of ""the tiny things"", for example I walk her to her car and wait till she takes a reverse and then we both wave and she goes, but recently she had to give a drop to one of her guy friends and she takes reverse and just leaves and there I was just looking at her drive away. It just made me feel something... And we use this app called locket where we send pictures of what we're doing throughout the day and she just doesn't send or reply because she ""forgot"". And what I hate the most is that I go to meet her and sometimes she'll be on her phone and doing something important and I wish her a goodmorning or say hello and she just says hello without even taking her eyes off her phone, I mean no matter how important it is, is it too much to just turn around and acknowledge my presence and tell me she's a little busy...  
  
Recently I proposed an IKEA date and she was happy, and then I was like let's leave at 9 in the morning as it takes an hour to reach there, and she was like ""What are we going to do for so long? Let's leave at like 11 or 12 so I can have lunch at home and then we can go there and we can spend like 4 hourse there and leave"", it really hurt me and I told her it wasn't about going to ikea but it was going to ikea with her and spending time with her. And I told her let's eat out as I never eat out as I live in a dorm in my college and she was like haa it's fine I'll get mu lunchbox and you order what you want and I'll have a few bites. This really pissed me off and I straightaway told her why is it that when you go out with all your other friends you're okay with having outside food but when you're with me you're like this? Like legit told her let's try lemon team in our college canteen and she said no for a month saying she doesn't trust the water he uses even though we've been drinking coffee for a long long time in a bakery next to it. But then her friends told her let's go to this restaurant and she just goes with them taking them in her car blindly and eats momos there, like legit my friend got food poisoning there and I tell her that he uses the same knives for veg and non veg and uses the same oil to fry both (She's a vegetarian).

Also I love pretty earrings and I have gifted her like 20 of them of all kinds but she barely uses them, she just wears the same pair every single day and when I confronted her regarding this her reply was ""It's too much work to pick among all the jewelery I have and I'm kinda lazy so I just wear the same pair everyday"", and even on special occasions she doesn't wear the ones I gift her, and when I ask her why she didn't wear one as it would go really well with her outfit she's liike umm I felt like this one  looked much better. Sometimes it just feels when she does put an effort and dresses up it's mostly to look good for everybody else and what I think doesn't even matter as according to her ""Men have a bad taste when it comes to all these"".  She has even told me I'm not allowed to pick a wedding ring on my own and am suppsed to take her mom with me as she knows her taste well, I have thought a lot about this and have mixed feelings regarding this.

And among all this I don't know why but her friends are interfering in our relationship and talking shit, in the fest I mentioned above she wanted to go hang out with her friends and I went to click a few pictures with mine and we decided to catchup again in half an hour and her  friends were like ""Is everything okay between you guys?"" ""Don't worry we're there for you"" and other shit....

I don't know all of this is really taking a toll on me and I don't know what to do.",1,1734098014.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

You can read some of my other posts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/hospice/comments/1h8jlyd/im_ready_to_go_home_when_already_home_symbolic/) (a week ago), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/hospice/comments/1h9k6lu/dad_broke_and_jumped_through_a_window_new_med/) (five days ago), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/hospice/comments/1haaspf/in_patient_hospice_after_violent_agitation/) (earlier this week).  

My dad was admitted to a heaven on earth hospice house that is filled with the most beautiful humans I've ever met. He is in such good hands. He's been unresponsive since he was admitted on Monday, hasn't eaten, drank, just slept thanks to a cocktail of medicine to keep his previous extreme agitation at bay. He's on morphine, haldol, ativan, and phenobarbitol (as needed). They haven't had to give him the latter in 12 hours because he has just \~relaxed\~ and doesn't seem to be holding any tension in his body anymore. 

His breaths are shallow and quick. His urine is incredibly dark, but there's very little collecting at this point. The tech this morning could barely find a pulse (she actually said she COULDN'T find one, but he's still very very very lightly breathing.) He had a gurgle yesterday — sounded like a coffee pot percolating — but it changes depending on his position, the nurses moved him every few hours to keep him comfortable. 

He's had the wonderful opportunity to say goodbye to his family, and they've also called and spoken to him gently in his ear to let him know we will all be OK and how loved he is. We had harpists come in to play him relaxing music. We've laid his favorite t-shirts on his bed. We brought his dogs in to say goodbye. (You could tell they knew, and it was heartbreaking.)

The nurses yesterday said it would be yesterday, obviously we are here now. We are looking for all the signs, but honestly, the best thing I could hear is that his body has seemed to go ""flaccid"" (nurses words) which usually means they are at peace and ready to rest. We will see. 

Would love to hear any experience from others. Does the pulse thing mean anything? I don't mind the waiting, as I want him to go on his time, but most of all I want him to find peace. ",3,1734097813.0,hospice,0,1.0,False

I’m on the lookout for fabulous female friends in their late 30s and 40s here in Berlin, Germany. A little about me: I’m female and married, child-free by choice (and sticking to it!), and I’ve fully embraced my role as the funny aunt who keeps things interesting at family gatherings.

My best friend recently moved away, and as someone who thrives in a small, tight-knit circle, I’m missing that go-to woman to chat with, laugh with, and maybe even bond over our shared quirks.

I’m an indie music enthusiast who loves a good concert or a cozy night at the movies. By day, I’m a social media manager, staying on top of the latest pop culture happenings, I’ll admit, I sometimes feel like I’m hilariously out of sync when hanging with 40-somethings who seem to have life completely figured out. (Seriously, where’s that manual, and why didn’t I get a copy?)

For those who care about astrology (and let’s be honest, who doesn’t love a little starry insight?), I’m a Sagittarius Sun and Pisces Moon. Translation: I love deeply, passionately, and probably way too much—until I don’t. When I’m done, you’ll never hear from me again... but hey, it takes a while to get me to that point! 

Of course, I should mention that despite my best efforts to sound admirable, I’m basically the person who spills coffee on her shirt *right before* a big meeting. So, if you’re into deep conversations, a touch of sarcasm, and laughing at life’s little messes (mine, mostly), I’d love to hear from you. DM me! And if no one does, I will overthink about this post for the next 3 years. Ha! ",5,1734097786.0,berlinsocialclub,2,1.0,False

wrap up my tasks for the day  
I'd make us coffee, until I've run out

I, like so many of us paying out of pocket, have invested a lot of money to try to better my health via tirz, so when it seems like some of my investments may have been a waste...helpful comments and posts here really alleviate that worry.  I spent $$ on a quality unflavored protein powder (not realizing it came in two huge bags!), and the stuff wasn't dissolving in my liquids (mostly my hot coffee). I saw some posts/comments here that said to dissolve in cold water first..  and that works brilliantly! And tips about what to eat and supplements/products that assist are so great.

And also, while tirz may seem like a miracle drug (it really can be) let us not forget that WE are putting in a lot of work too! For ME, diminishing the food noise gives me brain space to make better food decisions, which will help me develop way better eating habits if I have to go off tirz. I also did and still do so much research to make this journey work for myself... I need to feel positive and proud of what I'm putting into this... we all do!

So thanks to all for sharing your journeys,  your successes and tips and recommendations...  I truly appreciate that I don't feel alone on this tirz path!

I already have another one here (1), ten years with me, I like the machine.            
The one I just bought (2) came in not a very good state. There were a lot of coffee stuck inside, the machine was not used for a while.        
I opened it up, cleaned it, replaced the pump balls and the safety valve.         
In test mode I’m able to get the machine to pour water from the hot water/steam dispenser, also I can move the brew group and water comes out of the normal coffee dispenser.        
The boiler is working, it gets hot.            
The grinder revs, I’m able to do some coffee using test mode (although a not very good coffee).            
But I can’t get the machine to work properly: when I turn it on in “normal” mode the red LED blinks very fast. I can dispense water through the hot water and the steam commands, it goes for a while (10 seconds?) and then it stops and red LED blinks slowly until I turn it back to beans position.             
If I press (not hold) the two coffee buttons while the machine is off it seems to go into descaling, with three LEDS on (all expect coffee), if I move the selector to steam or hot water the fourth LED turns on and if I press long coffee all leds blink and it dispenses steam for about 10 seconds and then stops. LEDs stop, three remain on (all except !).            
After that if I press the button again it just blinks all LEDs but nothing more comes out.
I’m not saying the machine is perfect, but I already can dispense water through the beans position (white the brew group aligned), so I don’t think there’s issues with water flow.        
I even tried putting the water pump from machine 1 in machine 2, it’s the same results.            
I’m not sure but I think there’s issues might be some kind of software reset? May e the machine was clogged before and now it doesn’t want to work properly?          
Once and only was it tried ton make its startup  routine, but that was before I cleaned the water dispensing, so no water came out.        
Any help will be appreciated. I’m keeping the machine until Monday and if I can’t figure it out I’ll take it to service, but I’d really like to fix it myself ($).         
I can get parts really quickly where I live.         
Also: yes, I tried to leave the trash bin out for a minute, nothing changes.        
I’m minding the sensor of the door, the machine is currently open but I keep the sensor pressed with a spoon.",1,1734097561.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False
1hdciqr,https://www.reddit.com/r/adamruinseverything/comments/1hdciqr/dear_adam_when_will_you_make_a_video_about_walt/,"Dear Adam, When Will You Make a Video about Walt Disney and Christian Nationalism.","I know Wisecrack has made many videos talking about this issue in depth. Yet, they forget to mention the danger the Disney Adult fandom poses to childhood friendships and how Gen Z can deprogram from years of brainwashing. Part of the reason why Disney Adults are the way they are is because they come from Fundamentalist Christian Nationist religions and they saw Disney films and parks as an escapist cult they could go to for help. In sociology, there is a term called cult hopping where a person in one cult joins another equally toxic like how ABA therapy teaches parents to find cures for their child's Autism and they end up becoming a part of Autism Speaks and other ableist groups and organizations. Many people think Conservatives are the only Christian Nationalists when sadly the indoctrination happens in circles that are supposed to be Liberal or Progressive. I was born in 91 and when I became a second grader my Mom pulled me out and homeschooled me because I have Autism and PDA. I felt very lonely even though I had learned a lot and was made to think critically and logically about everything and question everything.

I ran away from some lessons that were monotonous and repetitive which is how I met my first friend. Eventually, I spoke to her about my knowledge of animation, music, art, literature, and the natural world. She opened the door to her world too, apparently, she went to a Lutheran School that I did not know was a Fundiementlist one. She performed in a play called Who Stole the Tarts, which is about Alice. We would watch Veggie Tales and Larry the Cucumber was my favorite evangelist and tuba enthusiast which I later became. Then I found out that her Mom despite being a hard person was a Disney Adult before the term was coined and they went there every summer.

Now that I'm older I wish someone told me that Belle from Beauty and the Beast was Autistic at an early age because I loved reading and thinking. Yet instead my Mom read Biology, Anatomy, Psychology, Therapy, Phamicology, and Temple Grandin, a big figure in the ABA and Autism Advocacy arena. She was a member of the Autism Society of Michigan before they dumped the puzzle piece logo for the Macanaw Bridge. She banned me from watching the Danny DeVito adaptation of Matilda because the parents in that film represent the worst parts of ABA therapy which is considered the Gold Standard in Autism therapy and ended up hurting a lot of kids in my generation. Escapeism and Procrastination were the two bad things I was not supposed to be. I wanted a Miss Honey in my life, someone who understood who I was and what I needed even when it was not spoken of. I had teachers who encouraged me to keep reading and learning in 4th grade at Gates Elementary in Davison, MI.

I loved books on the art of animation and puppetry ***The World of The Dark Crystal, No Strings Attached,*** and one my Mom called A Coffee Table Book...***The Illusion of Life*** by Frank Tomas and Ollie Johnson. I was told by my Mom who took art classes that I could never be an animator because my sense of time is off. She never learned that Exaggeration is one of the twelve principles of animation. The Skill Center where she worked never had animation as a class altogether even though one of her friends eventually worked at Disney. She had to give up her art and dance education to become a physical therapist. Sometimes it felt like she wanted to outdo me as an artist with her realism and detail when I was just a seven-year-old trying to doodle what I saw in the books. Taking ***The Illusion of Life*** back to the library was a battle of tears and anger. One storyboard I love from Hot Dog is when Oswald is put in a cage with a lion and they end up freeing each other.

Yet so much about Disney's secrecy, I had to learn on the internet much like how many other homeschool kids end up re-educating and deprogramming. One of them is about Ub Iwerks who was not paid for creating Mickey and how Disney as a corporation has always busted union artists. This was all done in High School when I learned about Tezuka Osamu considered the Father of Manga and Anime. At this time I was finally able to draw people and one of his greatest creations the Pheonix. I felt like Bart from [The Five Thousand Fingers of Dr. T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_5,000_Fingers_of_Dr._T), you feel like you have to tell the truth in a society that tells you, you can't hurt other people's feelings even though it's the absolute truth! Yes, Disney continues to bust unions and hurt artists and workers BUT, ***you can't say that in front of people who like Disney!*** For these people, Walt Disney is like the creepy youth pastor or band director who is so respectful in plain daylight, yet every smart person knows that they are the monsters who create the cult that kidnaps children and robs them of a childhood. Abigail Disney did not wish to be a goldfish like Mister Limpet, she had to be one around others until she spoke out. In the Autism community, we call this behavior masking and it can be overwhelming, dangerous, and you will lose who you truly are.

As I began my path as a college student my friend dated a boyfriend who was a Zombie Prepper who kept guns and ammo in the basement of her Mom's new house. She also had a sister with Sotos Syndrome who loved Brave and LalaLoopsy's. I was angry at her because the Sandy Hook shooting was on NPR and the shooter was a young Autistic boy who was undiagnosed. I also began to think about media more critically and thoughtfully, especially about people like myself who are Autistic. I felt like my friend betrayed my trust and who I was as a person and people allowed them to call me a downer and a bully when again I was telling them the truth about how harmful Glee and Big Bang Theory were to younger Autistic and Disabled people. Then when Frozen came around my friend's family became an angry mob for me not liking it. This was all after I graduated with an Associate of General Studies, my Grandma Lill passed, and my parents got divorced. I'm no longer friends with them after their Mom told her sister that I was a B\*\*\*h constantly which left a mark for someone at her age at the time.

Friends are supposed to support you when things get hard, instead, I was abandoned. Eventually, I learned that there are fundamentalists in every religion including in the Lutheran Faith, and that Focus on the Family is a hate group that has its own kid's show Adventures in Oddassy. When a person's life is deeply devoted to a cooperation or religion it can be hard to get them out. So always keep asking questions, keep on thinking, find the helpers, and one day tomorrow will be better than before. There are always people helping others get out of high-demand cults and corporations.

When the alarm clock coaxed Bruce awake, he felt as if no time at all had passed since he had finally closed his eyes. He was surprised at how refreshed he felt. He knew he’d been awake until well past midnight, and usually he was a zombie at less than eight hours of sleep. Today, though, he felt better than he ever had on a work day. He headed for the office with pep in his step.

Somewhere during the night, his hope had won out over his caution. He was looking forward to seeing Delilah tonight. He still knew that it might be a trick, and he still planned to be cautious before following her off to any dark corners of the carnival, but it really felt like her interest was genuine.

His positive attitude must have been showing on his face. The greeting he got from his coworker Thomas was much heartier than the usual polite acknowledgement of his existence.

“Bruce! Looking good this morning, pal. Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.”

“Thanks, Thomas. You too.”

“Don’t give me that! Take the compliment. You look sharp today.”

“I—okay, thanks.” Bruce eyeballed his coworker, but there was no hint of sarcasm in his tone. “Got something to sell me today?”

Thomas’s laugh was unforced and genuine. He seemed sincerely delighted by Bruce’s question. “No, but would it work if I did? Boss gave the sales department a little manual on connecting with people. Everyone loves a compliment, but if it’s too vague or too specific, it doesn’t work. Got to be something that they agree with and would be pleased you noticed. Then they know you think like them. Saw you coming in, looking on top of the world, and I figured I’d try it out! How’d I do?”

“Good, I guess.” Bruce was a little brought down to hear that it had in fact been a sales technique, but he couldn’t deny that it had been nice to hear until he learned that. Honestly, even knowing that, it still felt nice to be noticed. He felt he owed it to Thomas to provide some sort of feedback. “I guess maybe you were a little vague? If the manual says to pick something in particular, you could go deeper than ‘looking sharp,’ I think.”

“Good call! I appreciate it.” Thomas looked at Bruce for a minute, then nodded. “You’re looking confident, then. Something in the eyes, maybe the mouth. I’d buy something from you today.”

He walked off, leaving Bruce bemused. That was very likely the longest conversation he’d had with Thomas since he’d been hired. Previously their exchanges had been limited to brief nods in the hallway. Bruce had had the impression that Thomas was fairly self-absorbed, but he was a good salesman despite that.

It was kind of funny now that Bruce thought about it. The final compliment that Thomas had issued, that he would buy something from Bruce, was basically saying that Bruce was good enough to be like him. Definitely self-absorbed, then, but that actually made the compliment much more meaningful.

Bruce was surprised a few minutes later by the sudden appearance of a mug of coffee on his desk. He looked up along the hand holding it to see Thomas had returned, and was pushing the mug toward him.

“Hey, I just wanted to make sure you knew that I meant that. I wasn’t just trying out the sales technique. You’ve got a strong air about you today. Whatever you changed, keep it up.”

Bruce blinked. “Thanks?”

“You got it, bud! Knock ‘em dead today. Those numbers, or whatever you’ve got there.”

He walked off again, leaving the coffee as—an apology? Bruce wasn’t really sure. It was a nice gesture in any case, even if the coffee was just black. Bruce drank it anyway.

This morning interaction set the tone for the entire day at work. Conversations lasted just a little bit longer. His coworkers seemed just a bit more attentive, more interested in what he had to say. At one point, Bruce went into the bathroom just to look at himself in the mirror to see if he could figure out what was different.

Thomas was right. There was something indefinable in his features, something that spoke of strength and leadership. These were never qualities he had associated with himself before. Bruce would have said that his strengths were quiet competence and reliability. He was a born follower.

He thought about Madame Mysteria’s offer to grant him a wish. It was absurd, of course. She was just another carnival sideshow, nothing but shining lights hiding the grit and grime. She had no magical power. And if she had, why grant it to him? There had been a line dozens of people deep outside of her tent. There was nothing that would have made him stand out.

The much more reasonable answer was the prosaic one: he was excited about his date tonight, and it showed. His happiness was inspiring smiles in others. It was the same sort of connection Thomas’s manual encouraged. People liked to fit in, so they mirrored the mood of those around them.

No magic required. Just basic human psychology.

As Bruce was leaving work that day, the receptionist Sheryl asked him, “How’s our town been treating you? Been finding enough to do other than come to work?”

“I’m getting the hang of it,” Bruce said. “I’m going to the carnival tonight.”

“Oh, that sounds like fun,” said Sheryl. “I was thinking about going, but I don’t have anyone to go with.”

“You could go anyway!” said Bruce. “I went by myself last night.”

“And you’re going alone again tonight?”

“Well, I’m meeting someone there tonight.”

“Oh,” said Sheryl. She sounded slightly disappointed for some reason. “Well, I hope you have fun! I’ll see you tomorrow.”

“See you tomorrow,” said Bruce. He walked to his car, wondering what that had been about. As with Thomas, his previous interactions with Sheryl had been limited to socially-dictated minimum levels of politeness. It was nice that she wanted to make sure he was adjusting well, but just over a month into his arrival was an odd time to check in.

The interaction soon vanished from his mind, pushed out by thoughts of his impending date. Or potential mugging, he reminded himself, but the possibility which he had been so sure of yesterday now seemed barely worth considering.

He agonized over the clothes in his closet, all of which suddenly seemed uninspired and shoddy. He put product in his hair until it shone, then worried that it was too much. He showered, washing it all out, then started over and put just as much in a second time. He told himself he should eat something to calm the jitters. He was too nervous to follow his own advice.

The minutes crept by, reluctantly turning into hours. 7:30 was too early to leave, but Bruce told himself he could just wait in the car until he saw Delilah. At least that way he’d stop messing with his hair.

He pulled into the parking lot at 7:47 despite knowing that Delilah’s promise of “around eight” certainly meant later, not earlier. He figured he’d find her at the ticket booth, let her know he was there, and then wait until she was ready to go. It was all he would have been doing at home, anyway, and this way he would have at least some information about her readiness.

To his surprise, Delilah was waiting by a large oak tree at the edge of the makeshift parking lot as he arrived. She was a vision in a carefree blue dress. Bruce rolled down his window and called out to her.

“Delilah! One second, I’ll go park.”

She waved at him. “No, I’ll be right over!”

She stepped forward just as a driver whipped his car in a tight turn to fit into the space under the oak tree. One headlight briefly illuminated her shocked face, then smashed as it impacted and sent her hurtling back against the tree.

Bruce shouted in useless alarm and leapt from his car, racing across the aisle to where Delilah lay against the tree. The other driver was out of his car, bleeding from the forehead where he had smacked into his own steering wheel when he stomped on the brakes.

“I didn’t see you! I didn’t see you! Are you all right?”

Bruce shoved the man back into his car and kicked the door out of his way. Delilah was sitting against the base of the tree, and for just an instant he was certain that she wasn’t moving. Then she looked up at him and smiled shakily.

“Wow! Okay, yeah. I should have let you go park.”

“Are you okay? Are you hurt?”

Delilah stood up, brushing glass off of her dress. She patted herself down briefly. “I think I’m all right.”

She did a little twirl in front of Bruce. “Everything’s working. How’s my dress?”

“Beautiful,” said Bruce.

She laughed. “I mean is it torn? Too dirty to wear? That sort of thing.”

“Oh.” Bruce could feel himself blushing. “No, it looks fine. Good.”

“Take a closer look,” she teased him, stepping in toward him. She smelled like flowers, with just a hint of the best of the carnival scents. She looked amazing.

“Is she okay?” the driver asked.

Bruce had momentarily forgotten about him.

“Better than you are,” he told the bleeding driver. “Get that head checked out. And geez, man. Drive like you’re out in public. You could have killed someone.”

He turned back to Delilah. “You’re sure you’re okay?”

“Nothing but a bump,” she assured him. “Shall we try this again?”

She took his hand as they crossed the parking lot aisle.

“For safety’s sake,” she said, smiling. “I try not to make the same mistake twice.”

Bruce opened the door for her and let her into the car. He took a deep, shaky breath before getting in himself.

“You certainly know how to start a date with a bang,” he said.

Delilah gave the same wicked laugh she had on the phone the previous night. “And here I thought we were going to go out.”

Bruce stuttered over his words, finding it even harder to recover in person. Delilah laughed again and put her hand on his knee.

“Drive,” she said. “We’ll see how far innuendo will take us later.”

Seriously, anyone who uses this is a special type of fool. My husband does it(baking lasagne with the plastic oh no) and I fear my pre-teen son is picking up on it. How does one offer to do this dishes and when they walk away, glasses are right side up with water in the bottom, the window is splashed to fuck with soapy water and the floor is a slip and slide. Why offer? A 12yo really doesn't know how to wash a plate, and then says they don't know that they wet glasses go upside down? Really? 

Am I being an asshole and expecting too much? No I am not. But know my son knows that if he ever offers again, I'll say no and then he can also say Oh well I tried and shrug his shoulders like his dad does. Apparently, no one can take the trash bag out either because it always ends up tearing or something along the way and a big fuss is made. Strange how I've never had a bag tear or rip on me in 10yrs of taking the trash out. Mmmm, big wonder.

So, I currently live with my father, stepmother, and little brother in their home. It’s a two bed one bath small house. My father and stepmother gave me their room while they sleep in the living room. The living situation isn’t terrible but it also isn’t great either. I mean nothing psychical. Just a lot of other things like controlling and narcism. 

I feel like my life is in limbo, like I’m just floating around or existing. I currently work in a small grocery store. I can’t help but notice the different uniform that me and the chef wear than the rest of the store. I can also see some of the signs. It seems that they don’t exactly want me there but they need me there. They hire a few new people but they don’t seem to stay long. 

My experience is only limited to a factory job and mostly retail. I currently work with food like making meals at my store. don’t exactly hate the job but I don’t really like it either. There are a few coworkers that I don’t really like all that much.  One of them is the chef who I can’t help but hope they’ll find a replacement for. He seems to mess up the food, has an attitude and complains to the customers. 

This one other coworker micromanages, asks me personal questions. like when and what I’m having for lunch, who’s picking me up later, etc.. she can be overbearing at times, she’s been there over 6 years though she’s not the manager. The job is close by the house like walking distance. It also offers some good benefits, but they pay less than $16 an hour. 

I have a learners permit but I don’t have a car or a drivers license. I took the one drivers Ed near me and we practiced for 15 hours. They gave me a certificate for driving 15 hours. My father owns two cars in his name. He can’t exactly reach me he’s in his 70’s and retired. His health isn’t too good, he has bad eyesight and hardly ever drives anymore. My stepmother has a drivers license but doesn’t really want to teach me how to drive. 

I don’t really have any friends or family to teach me. There are other driving schools out in the suburbs but they only seem to offer Saturdays and I work Saturdays. 

I get dropped off at work by my stepmother then she comes back home to take my little brother to school. I spend somewhere 20 to 30 minutes sitting outside work until it’s time to clock in. during lunch I walk to the local coffee shop or I go there after work. After work I’ll wander around to either the gym, coffee shop, or look at books at the small indie book store. 

My stepmother doesn’t really like it when others are in the kitchen. Either when they’re in there or when she’s in there she likes to be alone. She’ll wait for them to come out. The kitchen is small, narrow and the fridge is small too. I’ve been given rides to the store before and she’ll literally cook me a meal the same night or the day after. Like I’d have food in the fridge and she’ll cook the same very few meals. Ride, beans on the stove, and or this chicken soup with foods she finds around the kitchen.  

If I bring food then I’m expected to share. Or I’m asked if I brought some for others. If I put it in the fridge she’ll throw it out in a few hours or so. I’ve been trying to eat, drink water, use the bathroom before I get home. Or at least eat what I want to eat. They like to get fast foods like McDonald’s, Burger King, dollar tree etc..

I often times go out to eat. Either it be sushi, pizza, Spanish food, nothing too expensive just like what’s around me. Or smoothies, and açaí bowls at the gym. when I’m at home I fairly sit around, brush my teeth, scroll on my phone until like it’s time for bed. Then the day basically repeats itself.

I'm a 28-year-old male, in decent shape overall, and life is going pretty well for me—financially, socially, and otherwise. Over the past two years, I've gone out on dates with at least 10-15 women. With some of them, I even went on 3-4 dates. We did regular things—coffee dates, walking, hiking, restaurants, etc.

The problem I’ve had with every single one of these women is that, when I first saw them, I thought to myself, *""Hmm, she’s cute,""* but I didn’t feel a super strong attraction. You know what I mean—that fire that lights up when you see someone, and you instantly know you’re drawn to them.

With most of these women, I knew something was off even after the first date. They were all normal women—good-looking and with values that somewhat aligned with mine (some more than others). They were kind and had a nice, relaxing vibe. But something just felt off! I started having doubts immediately but kept going on more dates just in case my mind was playing tricks on me. Seeing messages from them didn't excite me much, and the prospect of further dates with them was neither exciting me nor repelling me - it was a flatline of sorts. Some might say I forced myself but I just wanted to give a chance for me and the other person to get to know each other (as much as you can in 3-4 dates).

I don’t know what’s going on. It seems like I can’t figure out whether I truly find someone attractive or if I really like them. I’ve felt real attraction before—at least 2-3 times in my life—so I have a reference point. Just to clarify, when I talk about “attraction,” I’m not referring purely to physical appearance. All of the women I went out with would be considered good-looking. I’m talking about a more general type of attraction that includes physical attraction but isn’t limited to it.

>Phillip and Jason were no longer active with the Buddhist organization [SGM = SGI Malaysia] since they tendered their resignations more than a year ago. They were chatting over freshly brewed coffee in a cozy café somewhere in the Klang Valley. 

>Phillip: **I am much happier after I left. More time with my family, and save a lot of money too. Seriously, my life is more peaceful and at ease today. Last time, my schedule was crazy. Meetings, meetings, and more meetings. On weekends, three four a day. More busy than the Prime Minister. Those were the days. Come to think of it, we were truly foolish. For decades! Sigh…**

>You agree that we were being taken for a ride, big time conned? All useless and wasted, isn’t?

That's the opening for a bunch of SGI/""youth division training"" apologia that I'll spare you here. My only comment on that is that there are *plenty* of ways to get what that person is claiming they got through SGM - and no one *needs* to join a **CULT** or sacrifice their lives to get it.

A lot of what they're crediting to their SGM tenure looks to me like just plain maturing over time, frankly, like most everyone does - *without* having to join a **CULT**.

>Phillip: You are saying I am wrong?

>Jason: Not entirely. **You were right to say that we were foolish. Just listened and swallowed everything wholesale without questioning.** But foolishness also has a bright side, you agree?

>**I admit we did neglect our family and friends, and even work at times. The word – *kosen-rufu* – carries so much weight that we became fanatical without realising it. Sees everything that’s blocking our activities as obstacles, sansho shima (three obstacles and four devils) and become overly defensive of criticisms from friends and family members.**

>**In addition, we hear testimony in experience meeting of how Mr X put his businesses aside and go all out for kosen-rufu, his business miraculously turn around. Now, that’s bullshit. It’s superstitious and unhealthy.** If we neglect our business or work, we can not build trust and can never be successful in the long-term. That’s just common sense. And Buddhism is reason.

I received a multitude of calls from leaders (who were like 18 years old and did not have the same financial or work obligations that I did) encouraging me to forgo paying bills in order to attend. This was escalated to an older leader and I eventually said, ""Please stop. A line is being crossed.""

Thank god I came to my senses and backed down, but my bosses never looked at me the same way after that and I stayed at entry level. I went about everything back then in a haphazard way which I now see was due to feeling so out it all the time.

Comparing Hydrogen Water with Regular Water: What’s the Difference?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to hydration, most people are aware of the importance of drinking water. However, a new trend has emerged: hydrogen water. This sparkling beverage is gaining popularity for its touted health benefits compared to regular water. But what really sets hydrogen water apart from the water you're used to? Let's explore the differences to help you make an informed choice.

### What Is Hydrogen Water?

Hydrogen water is infused with molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>), which is a colorless and odorless gas. Regular water, on the other hand, simply consists of H<sub>2</sub>O – two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom. The key difference lies in the additional molecular hydrogen present in hydrogen water, which is believed to offer various health benefits.

# Keep It Neutral

Start with broad, safe topics like the event you’re at, the work environment, or industry news. Avoid anything too personal until you get a sense of the other person’s comfort level.

* ""How are you finding this event? Have you been to many conferences like this before?""  
* ""I saw that our industry’s really evolving with AI lately—what are your thoughts on that?""  



# Adjust Based on Personality

Pay attention to body language and tone of voice. Some people will open up more if you ask about their professional experiences, while others might appreciate something less formal.

* For someone more reserved, you might say: ""I noticed your team is doing some impressive work. How long have you been with the company?""  
* For someone more outgoing, you could ask: ""I hear this city is great for food! Do you have any restaurant recommendations?""  



# Avoid Assumptions

Remember that people from different cultures or backgrounds might have different comfort levels with small talk topics. Don’t assume everyone enjoys discussing the same things.

* **For colleagues from a direct communication culture** (like the US or Germany), they might appreciate you getting straight to the point after a little small talk.  



Example: ""It was great chatting—should we get into the agenda for today’s meeting?""



* **For colleagues from indirect communication cultures** (like Japan or Mexico), they may prefer more time building the relationship before diving into business matters.  



Example: ""Shall we have a coffee or tea before we start the meeting? I’d love to catch up with you.”



By keeping small talk neutral at first and paying attention to cultural and personal cues, you’ll be able to make stronger connections without overstepping boundaries.

(Also, writing on mobile so formatting might be weird)

We met irl in uni and found out we both RP as a hobby. She had some great ideas, and I was getting my roommate into the hobby as well, so we all started writing together for fun in our spare time. Things started out fine, but after a while my ex friend (“S”, for the sake of clarity) started showing some bad habits that honestly explained why she had such a hard time finding people to write with her.

For starters, every single one of her OCs was OP in some way. Nobody was allowed to be better than hers at anything. Her main was a typical YA female protag (gorgeous, low self esteem, clumsy, but somehow also always badass and graceful when it mattered) and she insisted that one of my OCs should be intimidated by her upon first meeting. I don’t see how a character who was raised on a military planet, was a social parasitic species that specialized in infiltration and destruction, and was deep into the bl@ck m@rk3t would be intimidated by someone who was a prime target for him, but sure. That really irked me, but not quite as much as her supposed best friend, who was also my OC, being denied coffee by her in literally every over the top way imaginable. Nothing he did was good enough to reward him with a single sip before it was stolen from him. And I can absolutely see how that could be seen as a gag or running joke, but it wasn’t funny when that’s how she treated every interaction.

Oh, and if my OC was meant to be the best in their field, hers had to one up it. Oh, he’s a certified genius and made his own AI system at 16 to track his health after a long battle with childhood c@ncer and is testing it for use in the general public so everyone can get alerted faster and get treated early? And he wants to donate them to high risk individuals, and keep costs low for the general public? Well, she’s smarter than he is and can make his work even better! Just because she can! Not because she has any motivation to do so or desire to help people, but just to be the best at it.

There was also a passing joke once about S’s OC’s friend, the coffee deprived one, wanting to fight g-d with a stick, and that turned into her OC routinely beating g-d up in the Denny’s parking lot every Tuesday. I have no recollection of how we got there.

It wasn’t all bad. S had some amazing plot ideas and some genuinely interesting characters, and decent writing when she wasn’t lowkey godmodding, but… I definitely don’t regret blocking her on everything. There was drama with her adding a friend to our group chat (who deserves their own story) and some irl stuff too that I won’t be sharing, but at least I got some cool OCs out of it I guess lol",0,1734096258.0,BadRPerStories,1,0.5,False

Understanding the Different Methods of Teeth Whitening and Their Impact
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening is a popular cosmetic procedure aimed at brightening smiles and boosting confidence. Many people are curious about the different methods available and their potential effects. Understanding these options can help you choose the best approach to achieve stunning results.

### Types of Teeth Whitening Methods

There are several methods to whiten teeth, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Let’s explore these methods in detail.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **In-Office Whitening:** This professional treatment is performed by a dentist. It uses strong bleaching agents, often combined with heat or light, to achieve quick and dramatic results. Many patients see improvements in just one session.
- **At-Home Whitening Kits:** Dentists can provide custom-fit trays and bleaching gel for use at home. These kits require a commitment of time, usually over several days or weeks. While they may take longer than in-office treatments, they often deliver noticeable results.
- **Over-the-Counter Products:** Available in most drugstores, these include strips, gels, and toothpastes. While convenient and usually less expensive, they may be less effective than professional options. They are popular for those looking for gradual whitening at home.
- **Natural Remedies:** Some people opt for natural methods like baking soda, activated charcoal, or hydrogen peroxide. While these can be gentler on teeth, their effectiveness is often debated, and results may vary significantly.

### How Each Method Works

Understanding how each whitening method works can help you make an informed choice:

- **In-Office Whitening:** The dentist applies a high-concentration peroxide gel to your teeth. This gel penetrates the enamel and breaks down stains effectively. Many use light to accelerate the process, leading to results in about an hour.
- **At-Home Whitening Kits:** These kits contain weaker concentrations of the same bleaching agents used in dentists’ offices. You place the gel into custom trays or pre-filled strips, which must be worn for a specified duration each day.
- **Over-the-Counter Products:** Most of these products contain carbamide peroxide or hydrogen peroxide. They work similarly to professional methods but with lower concentrations, requiring consistent use over time to see results.
- **Natural Remedies:** These methods typically rely on abrasive ingredients or mild bleaching agents. For example, baking soda scrubs stains off the surface of your teeth, while hydrogen peroxide acts as a lightening agent.

### Effects of Teeth Whitening

Different whitening methods can have varied impacts on your teeth and gums. Here’s a breakdown of what to expect:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Results:** In-office treatments provide the fastest and most noticeable changes. At-home kits and over-the-counter options may yield gradual whitening, depending on usage consistency. Natural remedies often result in minimal whitening.
- **Sensitivity:** Some individuals experience increased tooth sensitivity after whitening. In-office treatments can sometimes cause more sensitivity than at-home methods, particularly if the gel is applied too strong or left on too long.
- **Duration of Results:** Professional whitening can last longer compared to at-home kits and over-the-counter options. However, dietary habits can influence how long your results last. For instance, staining beverages like coffee can cause quick fading of whitened teeth.
- **Safety:** Professional whitening is considered safe when performed by a dentist. At-home kits and store products are generally safe but should be used as directed to avoid gum irritation or damage.

### Choosing the Right Method for You

When selecting a teeth whitening method, consider the following factors:

- Your budget: In-office treatments generally come at a higher cost than at-home or over-the-counter options.
- Your time: If you want quick results, in-office treatments are ideal. For gradual changes, at-home kits may suit you better.
- Your tooth sensitivity: If you have sensitive teeth, speak to your dentist about methods that may reduce discomfort.
- Your desired level of whiteness: If you’re aiming for significant change, in-office treatments might be the best choice.

Understanding the different methods of teeth whitening and their corresponding effects can empower you to make an informed decision. Choose based on your goals, budget, and dental health to achieve that bright smile you’ve always wanted.

### Conclusion

The journey to a brighter smile can be truly transformative, as highlighted by the significant before and after results of teeth whitening. Many individuals experience a newfound confidence and an enhanced appearance after their treatments. Whether opting for at-home whitening kits or professional dental services, seeing those radiant results can be incredibly rewarding.

Despite claiming in multiple places that it goes “out of its way” to model realistic parameters, that its objective is “to not skew the results in WarpStream’s favor” and that that it makes “a ton” of assumptions in Kafka’s favor… it seems to do **the exact opposite**.

I posted [a 30-minute read](https://bigdata.2minutestreaming.com/p/the-brutal-truth-about-apache-kafka-cost-calculators) about this in my newsletter.

Some of the things are nuanced, but let me attempt to summarize it here.

The WarpStream cost comparison calculator:

- inaccurately inflates Kafka costs by 3.5x to begin with

	- its instances are 5x larger cost-wise than what they should be - a 16 vCPU / 122 GiB r4.4xlarge VM to handle **3.7 MiB/s** of producer traffic

	- uses 4x more expensive SSDs rather than HDDs, again to handle just 3.7 MiB/s of producer traffic per broker. (Kafka was made to run on HDDs)

	- uses too much spare disk capacity for large deployments, which not only racks up said expensive storage, but also forces you to deploy more of those overpriced instances to accommodate disk

- had the WarpStream price increase by 2.2x post the Confluent acquisition, but the percentage savings against Kafka changed by just -1% for the same calculator input.

	- This must mean that Kafka’s cost increased 2.2x too.

- the calculator’s compression ratio changed, and due to the way it works - it increased Kafka’s costs by 25% while keeping the WarpStream cost the same (for the same input) 

	- The calculator counter-intuitively lets you configure the pre-compression throughput, which allows it to subtly change the underlying post-compression values to higher ones. This positions Kafka disfavorably, because it increases the dimension Kafka is billed on but keeps the WarpStream dimension the same. (WarpStream is billed on the uncompressed data)

	- Due to their architectural differences, Kafka costs already grow at a faster rate than WarpStream, so the higher the Kafka throughput, the more WarpStream saves you.

	- This pre-compression thing is a gotcha that I and everybody else I talked to fell for - it’s just easy to see a big throughput number and assume that’s what you’re comparing against. “5 GiB/s for so cheap?” (when in fact it’s 1 GiB/s)

- The calculator was then **further changed** to deploy **3x** as many instances, account for **2x** the replication networking cost and charge **2x** more for storage. Since the calculator is in Javascript ran on the browser, I reviewed the diff. These changes were done by

	- introducing an obvious bug that 2x the replication network cost (literallly a `* 2` in the code)

	- deploy 10% more free disk capacity without updating the documented assumptions which still referenced the old number (apart from paying for more expensive unused SSD space, this has the costly side-effect of deploying more of the expensive instances)

	- increasing the EBS storage costs by **25%** by hardcoding a higher volume price, quoted “for simplicity”

The end result?

It tells you that a 1 GiB/s Kafka deployment costs $12.12M a year, when it should be at most $4.06M under my calculations.

With optimizations enabled (KIP-392 and KIP-405), I think it should be $2M a year.

So it inflates the Kafka cost by a factor of 3-6x.

And with that that inflated number it tells you that WarpStream is cheaper than Kafka.

Under my calculations - it’s not cheaper in two of the three clouds:

- AWS - WarpStream is 32% cheaper
- GCP - Apache Kafka is 21% cheaper
- Azure - Apache Kafka is 77% cheaper

Now, I acknowledge that the personnel cost is not accounted for (so-called TCO).

That’s a separate topic in of itself. But the claim was that WarpStream is 10x cheaper without even accounting for the operational cost.

Further - the production tiers (the ones that have SLAs) actually don’t have public pricing - so it’s probably more expensive to run in production that the calculator shows you.

I don’t mean to say that the product isn’t without its merits. It is a simpler model. It is innovative.

But it would be much better if we were transparent about open source Kafka's pricing and not disparage it.

I wrote a lot more about this [in my long-form blog](https://bigdata.2minutestreaming.com/p/the-brutal-truth-about-apache-kafka-cost-calculators).

It’s a 30-minute read with the full story. If you feel like it, set aside a moment this Christmas time, snuggle up with a hot cocoa/coffee/tea and read it.

I’ll announce in a proper post later, but I’m also releasing [a free Apache Kafka cost calculator](https://2minutestreaming.com/apache-kafka-calculator) so you can calculate your Apache Kafka costs more accurately yourself.

I’ve been heads down developing this for the past two months and can attest first-hard how easy it is to make mistakes regarding your Kafka deployment costs and setup. (and I’ve worked on Kafka in the cloud for 6 years)

I’m so concerned because my first son, born 5 years ago is very small for his age. Girls his age and younger tower over him. I feel like I failed him as a mom when I was pregnant with him - maybe I didn’t eat enough? Maybe I had too much caffeine? (I couldn’t give up coffee completely but switched to half/calf, heavy on the decaf and well within the recommend caffeine limits.) And then breastfeeding, I’m terrified I didn’t produce enough high quality milk for him and that I set him up for a difficult life as a short boy (he may get to 5’ 5”). 

I’m short myself, at 5’ 2” and generally small all around. But, my husband is 6’2”, and his short mom was able to produce 3 giant kids so there’s a precedent in his family already for making big kids with a small mom. 

I just worry my second son will have the same problems. The doctor assured me “he’s normal weight, not small, 10th percentile or less is small don’t worry” and shrugged it off. All my son’s pediatricians shrugged off his short stature too, since he was never below the 10th percentile, which I find frustrating because I don’t think I’ve been getting the best advice about how to make big, healthy, normal size babies. If your kid isn’t in the “danger zone” the attitude is there’s nothing to be worried about. 

With today’s society obsessed with big babies, everyone cooing over how big their kids are with pride, it’s so anxiety-inducing by to have small kids, especially boys. I love my son so much but I can’t help feeling shame and guilt every time I see him compared to kids his age.

Any advice for how not to feel guilt or anxiety? Any advice for how to make sure this baby is big (or even normal?)",0,1734095811.0,pregnant,8,0.5,False

My father abused my mother throughout their marriage because her parents didn’t give dowry. Despite his in-laws providing for his endless demands, he was never satisfied. He was harsh and transactional, kept us in unnecessary scarcity despite being wealthy, and showed no interest in providing for us until my mother started working. He had unreasonable expectations from us and often accused us of using him for his money, even though he only provided basic necessities like education and shelter.  

Later, my mother discovered his extramarital affair, confronted the other woman and slapped her, and after family meetings she decided to stay with him for the sake of the children. She hoped he would change, but his abuse continued, worsened by his family’s constant mistreatment. When his parents fell sick, my mother, desensitized by years of abuse, refused to serve them, and he blamed her. His mistreatment worsened, and we all felt brunt of it, living like rats in a room so that he could give the biggest room to his mother, that's okay but he always threatened my mother to leave his house, me to take her away from him, that he would involve police, and he'd leave  the house for hours while we remained there worried. Though his mother remained sick, he used to spent most of his time roaming outside and drinking coffee and blaming us when he saw we didn't spend as much time with our sick grandmother. Whenever her chemo appointments came he would take one of us brothers, he would expect us to take care of all formalities while he slept in that room. If we showed inability to do formalities or disinterest to go due to some other commitment, he would become angry. My brother had to prepare for his competitive exams so when he used to say this, my father would rebuke him a lot. His control extended to groceries, but when we bought missing items ourselves he discovered. I tried to explain to him but he misunderstood and lost his temper, he called me ""fatherless"" and kicked me out of the house.  

Fortunately, I had a job, so I left, taking my mother with me to escape his toxic influence. At my grandmother’s funeral, he blamed us for abandoning him, accusing us of planning it all once I was independent. Despite his pleas to reconcile, I refused, knowing his manipulation would resume. 

Should I reconnect with him? He still blames me to this day, it's strange to live in this circumstance without a father's support and he's all alone he requested a lot to reconnect, but I told him I need time.

RV life is amazing, but let’s be real—finding good internet on the road can be a hassle. We've been there, trying to stay connected and just getting frustrated. But the good news? There are many options in 2024 to keep you online while cruising down the highway. Whether it’s mobile hotspots or satellite internet, we’ve got the lowdown on what works.

We've been living full-time in our RV for five years, testing every internet option we could find. Trust us, we’ve experienced slow speeds and random disconnects. But we’ve also seen some legitimate solutions to keep us connected. Curious about the best RV internet for 2024? Let’s jump in!

TL;DR

* Starlink Roam hits up to 200 Mbps for $80/month, and it’s a total lifesaver in places where cell service is straight-up trash. 
* Mobile data plans and hotspots are still super popular, starting at like $80/month for unlimited data and speeds between 100-200 Mbps. 
* The best way to stay connected is to mix up your internet sources, like cellular data and Starlink, to ensure coverage everywhere. 
* Wi-Fi extenders can boost campground Wi-Fi signals from up to 2,500 feet away, so you’ll get a better connection at RV parks. 
* Dr. Sarah Thompson, a mobile connectivity expert, says you should always use a VPN for safety when using public Wi-Fi from your RV. 

Assessing Your RV Internet Needs

First thing’s first: we gotta figure out how much data we’re gonna use on the trip. Our travel plans are a huge factor in picking the right RV internet.

Identifying Data Requirements

Let’s talk data. How much internet do we need for our RV trips? Most RVers use anywhere from 100 to 200 GB a month, but it depends on what we’re doing. Are we streaming shows, working remotely, or just checking emails? Different activities eat up different amounts of data. If we’re living on the road full-time, we might need more. If we’re weekend warriors, maybe less.

It’s smart to track our usage for a month to get an idea of what we need before hitting the road.

Picking the right plan is super important. Some RV internet options, like Nomad, offer unlimited data for $99.95 to $149.95 a month with speeds of 100 to 200 Mbps. That’s plenty for most RVers.

But if we’re not heavy users, a mobile hotspot from our phone might be enough. The trick is matching our data needs to our style of travel and budget. No one wants to run out of data in the middle of nowhere or end up paying for more than we need!

Considering Travel Routes and Locations

Now that we’ve got our data figured out, it’s time to think about where we’re going. Where we’re heading and where we’re stopping is gonna affect what internet we go with. City stops are usually fine for internet, but if we're heading out to remote spots or national parks, we might need something like Starlink. It gives you speeds between 100-200 Mbps and starts around $80/month.

If you're all about camping in the woods, be aware of stuff like tall trees that might mess with your signal. Some RVers even use two internet sources to stay connected everywhere. That way, you can stream, work, or game no matter where the road takes you.

Top RV Internet Options for 2024

We’ve checked out the best RV internet options for 2024. Here are some solid picks to keep you connected while you’re out there vibing.

Starlink Roam 

Starlink Roam is a total game-changer for RV internet in 2024. You get speeds up to 200 Mbps, so streaming and gaming on the road is no problem. And the best part? It works in super remote places where cell service doesn’t even exist.

The downside? It’s a little pricier than other options, starting at $80/month. But if you want internet that actually works everywhere, it’s hard to beat. But if you want reliable internet pretty much anywhere, it’s tough to beat.

Setting it up is pretty easy too. The Starlink dish can be installed on most RVs, and once it’s up, you can get a signal almost anywhere in the U.S. Even with a little tree cover, it functions well, but for the greatest connection, you must have a clear view of the sky.

Starlink Roam is a good choice for full-time RVers who are unable to live without Netflix or who work remotely.

^(Cellular Data Plans and Hotspots)

We usually just use cellular data plans and hotspots for RV internet. Most of the big carriers have RV plans starting at $80/month, and they’re pretty solid and chill to use. Plus, they’re usually unlimited data, which is lit for video calls and streaming. As mobile hotspots, we like utilizing our phones.

They’re super handy and don’t require any extra equipment. For longer trips, we opt for a dedicated hotspot device, which gives us a more stable connection and can support multiple devices.

Plus, they’re perfect for those random work sessions in scenic spots. ""My mobile hotspot is like a digital campfire—it keeps everyone connected and happy, no matter where we go,"" said one fellow RVer.

Let's go on to discuss RV park Wi-Fi and how it may support your internet requirements.

^(RV Park Wi-Fi)

Park for RV Wi-Fi is somewhat risky. While some campgrounds offer dependable, fast connections that are ideal for streaming, others make it seem like it takes forever for a webpage to load. In essence, it's online roulette!

We’ve learned not to rely only on RV park Wi-Fi for our internet needs. It’s a nice bonus when it works, but we always have a backup plan. Many parks limit bandwidth or block certain sites, so we can’t always do everything we want online. Plus, with so many RVers working remotely now, these networks can get super slow during busy hours.

Having our own mobile hotspot or satellite internet as a backup is a smart move.

Key Features to Consider in RV Internet Services

When picking an RV internet plan, there are a few things we gotta look out for. These features can totally make or break your vibe on the road. 

Speed and Reliability

Speed and reliability are everything when it comes to RV internet. Really, nothing ruins the atmosphere more than a sluggish or erratic connection. For streaming, gaming, and video calls, the majority of RV internet solutions provide rates of 100–200 Mbps.

We've utilized products like Starlink Roam and Nomad, and they continue to function well even when you're in a remote location.

Reliability is just as important as speed. Fast internet is useless if it drops every five minutes. That’s why we always look for providers with wide coverage areas. Mobile hotspots from our phones have been lifesavers, giving us internet wherever there’s cell service. When we’re way off the grid, satellite internet is a lifesaver, though it’s a little more expensive.

Coverage Area 

Okay, let’s talk coverage. This one’s huge for us RVers, ‘cause we need the internet to work no matter where we are, not just in the city. 

Starlink’s got this on lock. It covers most of North America, even the super remote spots. If you like camping in quiet, out-of-the-way places, it’s a total win. 

Other options like Verizon and T-Mobile are good too, but they can be spotty in rural areas. We’ve found mixing services work best—like using Starlink for the mountains and sticking to cell networks when we're near towns.

Cost-effectiveness

We know RV life can get pricey, so finding cheap internet is a must. Most RV internet plans start around $80/month, but you can also grab plans from Nomad, which range from $99.95 to $149.95 with speeds up to 200 Mbps and unlimited data. Not bad for staying connected on the road!

If we’re on a budget, using our phone as a mobile hotspot is usually the cheapest option. It’s convenient and portable, perfect for quick checks or light browsing. But if we need a more reliable connection for work or streaming, we might need to shell out for dedicated mobile hotspots or satellite internet.

Enhancing RV Internet Connectivity

Here are a few tricks to boost your internet signal and stay connected no matter where you go!

Using Wi-Fi Extenders

Wi-Fi extenders are absolute lifesavers for RV internet. These little devices boost the signal from nearby Wi-Fi networks, like those in campgrounds or coffee shops.

One time, we parked our RV at the far end of a campground and couldn’t get any internet. But after plugging in our extender, we were streaming videos in no time! The best extenders can pick up signals from up to 2,500 feet away. They’re easy to set up—just plug them in, connect to the network, and bam, instant internet boost.

It’s like having a magic wand for Wi-Fi.

Investing in Dual Internet Sources

We’ve also learned that having two internet sources is a game-changer. It’s like having a backup for your main connection. A lot of RVers combine cellular data with satellite internet like Starlink Roam. This way, we get fast speeds from cell towers when we’re near towns and reliable coverage from satellites in remote areas.

Most of these setups cost around $80/month, but the peace of mind they provide is priceless. No more worrying about losing internet when one connection fails—just switch to the other and keep going.

Conclusion

We’ve covered a lot of ground when it comes to RV internet options for 2024. To wrap it up, let’s hear from Dr. Sarah Thompson, an expert in mobile connectivity.

Dr. Thompson says, “The RV internet scene has changed a lot recently. Starlink Roam offers amazing speeds and coverage, but it’s not the only option. Cellular plans and mobile hotspots are still solid choices for many travelers.”

She also points out, “It’s a good idea to use a VPN when accessing public Wi-Fi from your RV, especially if you're working remotely. And using multiple internet sources often gives the best results. Consider cellular data as your main connection, with Starlink or campground Wi-Fi as backups.”

Dr. Thompson’s Final Thought:

“For most RVers, combining cellular data and Starlink offers the best mix of speed, coverage, and reliability. It’s a solid investment for those who need internet on the road.”

1hdbpzj,https://i.redd.it/w30hqueo6m6e1.jpeg,A View On Castle Club,"We recently spent 3 days 2 nights at the DLH, staying in a Castle Club room. 

Thought it might be worthwhile posting my thoughts about the experience for others thinking about whether the cost is worth it. 

For clarity, we have stayed in Castle Club before, though this was well before the refurb. More recently we had been taking a suite at the Newport Bay when visiting DLP, to avail the VIP Fastpass - which has now been removed. 

So, there’s no denying that the DLH is a cut above the others. It really does feel pretty magical when you walk into the lobby and it’s all dressed for Xmas. We were swept up to the Castle Club reception and given drinks, then park tickets and told come back at 3pm to get our room keys. There was very little explanation of the features of Castle Club, the hotel features, pool hours, etc. but they were very keen to sell us restaurant reservations. 

The private elevator into the park from the Castle Club lounge is actually less of a gimmick than it seems. You are put straight into the park barrier ahead of all the queues - which at 9:45am when we went down were significant as day visitors were all waiting to be let in at 10am. It also allows you to just pop back up any time during the day to grab a coffee/hot chocolate and warm up. Without having to waste significant amounts of time in doing so. 

The room itself. Yeah… erm… doesn’t feel very 5 star, I’ll be honest. The bathrooms, in particular, felt very “old Doubletree hotel in a Midwest state”. The “magic button” in the rooms with the little light show is pretty naff. Like something an Indian restaurant would have in the waiting area. Feels like having some led chasing lights in the ceiling like Tinkerbell flying over would have been an easier and more effective choice. 

We requested a few items for the room (pillows, etc) and had to chase them up. Twice. Again, something that simply wouldn’t happen in a true 5* hotel. 

Service overall was an issue. It was either absolutely faultless, or non existent, depending on which person you happened to interact with. I sat for 15 minutes in the club lounge with my son around 625pm the first evening and I genuinely thought they must close at 6:30 as no-one asked if we wanted anything. At 6:40 I flagged someone and said if they were closing just let us know and we’d head off. The girl looked baffled and told me they closed at 1am - did I want anything? 15 minutes I’d sat there talking to my son and absolutely no-one had come to our table - we were the only guests in there. 

Next evening - different staff - absolutely faultless service from the second we arrived. 

Breakfast - decent enough. I expected more “Disney” stuff to be honest like the big Mickey waffles they used to have, or the pancake guy who could draw the characters in the pancakes. There wasn’t much of that, but it was a perfectly fine breakfast. The princesses interact and if you have a small girl with you I’m sure it would be magical, but it just felt a bit weird. Definitely better when it was the characters - but could easily be improved by having related characters around with the princess - if it’s Belle, have the beast or Gaston there at the same time. Jasmin? Have Jafar roaming around. Would be better for boys, IMHO - my 11yo lad was certainly nonplussed about the princesses.

The park itself - mentally busy during this Christmas period. We were there for 3 days and there is absolutely ZERO chance we’d have gotten on everything we wanted to do if we hadn’t stumped up for ultimate fast passes on the Saturday. That’s how long the queues were. So be prepared for that. One of the biggest downsides for me is the removal of the VIP fast pass for Castle Club and Suite guests. Having to pay for fast passes is a significant additional cost. 

So, this all sounds a bit negative. It really wasn’t. Disney is magical even if you’re a grump like me. The family loved it. The Castle Club lounge was a really nice bolt hole from the park that you could dip in and out of. 

But the rooms, and often the service, really don’t feel like 5*. And given the price you’re paying, you need to factor that in. 

Personally, my kids were 14 and 11 on this trip. There’s no way I’m sharing beds again so if we went again it would be two rooms. Looking for next Xmas, that’s about £5.5k for the two nights in two Castle Club rooms. That’s vs about £3.2k in superior rooms? Worth it? I’ll leave that to you to decide as it’s obviously totally subjective. But if went back to DLH I’d either stump up for Castle Club or I just wouldn’t bother with DLH at all and I’d just go Sequoia Lodge club rooms and let the difference pay for the rest of the trip.

Throughout the rest of our visit everyone just tried to act as normal as possible. My husband was trying to make them laugh and they talked a lot about old memories. None of us were really grieving, but I think it's because we were all just trying to be strong for each other.

When my husband and I were really alone after getting home he finally had time to think about what happened. He was very sad, but he said he felt guilty. He said he doesn't think  he feels sad enough. I tried to comfort him. It was a shock and he didn't have any time to process his emotions. I said everyone grieves differently and that he shouldn't put so much pressure on himself to feel a certain way.

It didn't really help. He said that he was the same when his gran passed away earlier this year. He was just not sad enough.

I told him gently that maybe he should see a therapist and work through his feelings. He agreed and is looking for a therapist.

I am a little lost. I want to be there for him while he is going through this, but I don't know how. 

Can someone please give me some advice as to what I, personally, can do for him?

It was a pretty basic internship since I was only in high school, and I just did some shadowing calls, made some Excel sheets using Pitchbook data, and was generally introduced to VC. This was a really formative experience for me though, and made me interested in a career in finance. Now I study finance and economics in university, am accepted into Girls who Invest, part of my uni’s investment club, etc. I’m in my sophomore year and am really struggling to find internships and am really worried about the junior summer internship period, especially cause I have a slightly low GPA. 
I wanted to reach out to my old mentor and ask her if it’s possible to intern with her again. We haven’t stayed super in contact in the two+ years since I interned with her, I just like the Linkedin posts and we congratulate each other on big achievements via social media. I have more relevant experience that could make it so that I could do better work and be more helpful (more finance knowledge and better Excel skills), so I know I would not be entirely dead weight. I also would do this for free of course (I wasn’t paid in high school either) and ideally even part time (so I can work another job the rest of the time cause I do need money lol). 
How do I go about approaching this? I was just going to ask her to meet up for coffee, and then catch up with her and ask towards the end ? Would it be seen as rude or something? I’m not sure I’m just kind of nervous about the whole thing but I would genuinely love to intern there again and get that experience but I don’t know how to go about it.",4,1734094468.0,FinancialCareers,6,1.0,False

The last 2 weeks we've had no big blow ups. We had 5 instances of ouch, where H's voice was raised. Each time we've repaired, he has apologized. 

Also, somehow, you all have enabled me to find my GOFL and stay in that. 

Regarding 2 ouch instances, I'd like to share a win and to ask for advice. H has immense insecurity around career, feels like a failure since his peers are all earning more than him and he rarely gets good feedback at work, has had conflict with colleagues who were unprofessional or sloppy with their work (who sometimes still manage to get ahead of him). This has been going on since I knew him. 

Instance 1: morning before school, H is stressed about possibly being late for school drop-off. I'm downstairs praying with the kids before H takes them to school. H is upstairs trying to find kids' extra pants. He barks down loudly at me that he can't find the pants, knowing full well that we're praying. Kids look up at me with big big eyes. I Said OK and we kept praying. Day went as planned. Later I asked H what happened, that's not like you, it was an ouch. He said 'you're careless about my relaxation and privacy, so why shouldn't I?'. But he also apologized to me and the kids.  
Wins here are my composure, non-escalation, self care, identifying that indeed my LD apology has to do with invading his boundaries. 
Help: I feel icky that I had to initiate a conversation to understand what was going on as well as to receive apology. This happens a lot. Release me from this ladies. Make me wiser and more magnetic, please. 

Instance 2: this morning, both wfh, having a relaxed coffee together, H is talking about his work frustrations, I'm doing IHY, SPFs, and slowly turning the conversation to an upcoming vacation. It goes well, so I start throwing out desires. Suddenly H is shouting at me for using I'd Love statements, he can't fulfill, etc. I said ouch, I didn't mean to demand and leave. Did SC amd came down 10 min later. H asks me to come sit with him. He explains that he felt overwhelmed and can't afford it. I said IHY. Did not retract my desire, did not say anything about it. Did SPFs and gratitude. It was over. 
Wins are obvious here. 
Help: how do I get this smart, hardworking, sincere and charismatic man out of this long winded career rut? 

Later on today I delivered my LD apology. There was no real response, he just listened with attention.

Long story short it was early morning, showroom was empty, a very cute guy who i think could be manager came and asked me what i am looking for i told him so we made small talk and found out we both have same car so we kept talking about it ultimately nothing more was left to say, he asked me if i want coffee etc and any of his guys can show me around the cars i refused and went on my merry way.

Question is
-how a girl asks a guy out without looking desperate 
In my head i am not worried about outcome, he could be single not single not interested but what i lack as skill is that i am good at conversations but i am shy about making first move in my head it reeks desperation

Possibly because I didn't word it properly. So I have funding in another state to open a café. It might not be relevant, but I am currently renting my apartment. My lease is ends at the end of February. That is when I would relocate/move to the other state to work on this. My other option is to renew my lease for another year to stay here at this location, possibly use some of this funding to setup a temporary online business. (The reason the café is in another state is because I am moving there no matter what. If not when my lease ends here, then next year.)

I have no clue how to setup a business. As in setup a budget for startup costs. And what I need to open a café. What I mainly need to know is what I need physically to start a legal business and how to go about doing it. As in I can't just get a location, buy a bunch of Coffee grounds at the grocery, make coffee, and start selling it. It's illegal.

I have no idea what I am supposed to do legally. I presume register a corporation. Open a bank account. No clue how to take credit cards. Get some form of commercial. No clue where to get supply like ingredients and such. I don't know what I'm doing. I need to calculate startup cost. But for that I need a list of everything I need bare minimum. The current funding I will be getting when I move is $20 or more. I also have some savings that I could use to start a home business if I decide to put off moving for a year.

1hdbbf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1hdbbf0/how_do_i_approach_this_situation/,How do i approach this situation?,"So me(24M) and this girl(23F), has been talking for like a month, she’s my co-worker we work in the same office. At first she replied to my IG story and the ball started rolling there, we started chatting here and there and i feel it’s not me who just initiated stuff. So after a week, i don’t remember what’s the trigger but she’s started to promise me some ice cream and at first i thought she was just gonna buy me one, not asking me out to get some together. So we set up a plan, like a week after that.

We did went out in the end and it went pretty well, i just talk a lot about random stuff with her for 3 hours and i feel off we’re clicking off well with each other. Heck she even initiated more plans for me and her, we were supposed to go out again this weekend and she even asked if i have the time to spend new years together.

Now here’s where i thought it kinda fell apart, it was a few days after we went out. I was pretty low key about my interactions with her, i didn’t really tell anybody about it, until i tell my dorm mates(who’s also work in the same place as i am, which is mistake number 1 from me) that i was gonna go out and get some coffee together with her. Ofc they were surprised, and i thought nothing of it until during work day one of them tease me about it in front of my supervisor. This was my second mistake, sincei didn’t really do anything about it or deny anything, i know how nasty gossip can be in work place. She and i work in different units, so it’s pretty rare for me to interact with her on work hours. 

But lo and behold it spread, it was wednesday when she asked me whether or not i told anybody about how she ask me out, i told her i only told my dorm mates about it.  She told me about how it has spread, she thanks for knowing her. And i ask her, why is she saying this and she replied with how she didn’t like other co workers prying into her private life and how she didn’t want to dragged me in to this, now this is where we start talking less and she just avoid answering my questions about this incident.

So, i apologise to her, by saying i didn’t meant for any of this to happen and i don’t mean to make things awkward for her. And that I hope i could to still to get to know her better or if she didn’t want it that way i hope we could still be friends(since she started avoiding me).

She said it wasn’t my fault, and she hopes so too, and i feel like this was my 3rd mistake since i ask her which one is she hoping of, which she avoids answering about it by ghosting me.

I was pretty hurt about this whole situation, i feel like i fucked up a lot in this situation. Did i look at her advance in the wrong way? She also had an ex she dated there for 2 years(I didn’t know about this since i was only started working there for 2 months now) So i thought maybe she had a trauma from that.

So how do i approach this situation? She’s a fun person to talk to, i feel like she gives me a lot of chances on how to approach her unless i look at it the wrong way and she just wants to be friends, which makes me hurt a bit but im okay with it. I think the point is, i just want a closure or just put this behind me. That’s the kind of person i am.

So, should i ask her about it again or just left it here?",1,1734093577.0,AskMenAdvice,7,1.0,False
1hdbb6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1hdbb6h/how_to_brew_medium_roast/,How to brew medium roast,"So I started off this holiday season with the Fruit Cake B&W/Fellow Drops exclusive, which is ""a bit more medium"" I think we would say. I then started the Advent box from The Barn, which is more what I would call ""the definition of medium"" in that it is maybe almost ""too dark"" if I brew it the way I would a light roast. 

So that's been my project this month, how to brew a medium roast (so that it is enjoyable to me as a light roast drinker).

My usual recipe that works for most light roasts is: 
Temperature: 205 F with a thorough preheat first
Grind size: medium-fine
Bloom: 3:1
Pour Structure: two large equal pours with about a 30 second pause in-between to allow some draw down 
Agitation: pour at a moderate-to-heavy rate, swirl after each pour
Ratio: 15:1
Total Brew Time: 3.5-4 minutes usually 

That recipe works too hard on the extraction for a medium roast and pulls a lot out that you don't want. I followed the typical adjustments to reduce extraction (lower temp, coarser grind, more concentrated ratio), but what surprised me is just how much I had to change in order to get a good result. 

My medium roast recipe: 
Temperature: 205 F with just a filter rinse (minimal preheat), and remove the kettle lid to allow a faster temperature decline after the bloom
Grind size: medium-coarse
Bloom: 2:1
Pour Structure: first pour after the bloom about 3:1, then pulse pours to maintain a minimal water column height above the coffee bed (helps keep the flow low to compensate for the coarser grind and reduces temperature of the brew bed)
Agitation: pour at a moderate-to-heavy rate, swirl after each pour
Ratio: 12:1 to 13:1 depending on how slow it's draining
Total Brew Time: 2.5-3 minutes preferably, which is a note I got from the roaster's brew guides.

So just a dramatically different brew, it took over a week to dial it in (maybe because it's a different coffee every day). It's a pretty good cup now and I'm now able to get the brighter fruity notes when the coffee offers it. But it is a more rounded out flavor due to the roast style.

How do you brew medium roast as a pour over? 

If I'm looking to adjust anything at this point it might be to try and get more sweetness out of the brews, which I feel like it's supposed to be a main feature of medium roasts. I think I might just need to notch down on the ratio again, what do you think? ",4,1734093553.0,pourover,6,1.0,False

We matched on Saturday, and she wanted to meet me that evening, I had plans at 7:30, so I said hey I can meet you at 6:30 in the city centre and break the ice over coffee, she said great I'll get ready and meet you. She got ready by 10 past 6 and asked where were meeting, I said the city centre as we agreed upon, she said by the time she gets there it'll be late and we won't get much time, I reassured her it's okay I can be late to my prior engagment. She then said it's cold and would rather sit inside, which is fine. She then asked again where were meeting.. 
So I said, okay come city centre there's 100 cafes we'll find something, by the time she got back to me I told her let's raincheque because now it's 7pm and you still haven't left your home.

Sunday I had a family birthday and couldn't see her, I asked her if she's free on Monday and she said she won't be free until 11pm (which I'm not doing coffee on a Monday night at 11pm)

So I said, look could you please let me know your schedule, when do you work, when are you free? Can the morning be suitable? She didn't respond to that, but replied to another message so I proceeded to ghost her tbh, she messages me 2 days later saying hey what's going on, are we still meeting I'm interested. 

I told her that i too am interested, but you won't plan a day/time with me. I've asked you 3 times to let me know when you're free in advance, she then replies- let's get coffee now?! 

-.-

By this stage I'm frustrated, I'm a mess, haven't had dinner and really don't wanna leave my house as I had just got home.

I told her again, hey please let's plan in advance, when are you free.

She replied with ""okay, let's see each other tomorrow""

I recently got myself a DeLonghi Eletta Cappuccino, excited to make barista-level cappuccinos at home. However, after several attempts, I’m starting to feel a bit defeated. The cappuccino I’m making isn’t as smooth as I’d like, and the coffee itself has a bit of a sour taste.

I’ve tried tweaking the settings and have experimented with at least three different types of beans so far, but I haven’t landed on that “magic combination” that works. I’m wondering if it’s just me, or maybe the machine isn’t living up to the hype.

Does anyone have a tried-and-true setup (specific beans + machine settings) that works wonders with this model? I’d love to hear any tips or recommendations before I consider sending it back.
