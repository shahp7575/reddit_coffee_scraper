I’m a total capsule coffee addict who’s been using reusable pods lately to save money and cut down on waste- but I’ve been struggling to find reliable aluminum foil lids. The one I’ve tried either leak during brewing, leave sticky residue on the pod rim or don’t seal tight enough to keep my coffee grounds fresh.
I mainly use reusable pods for my Nespresso Original Line machine, but any brand that works with common refillable pods would be great. Ideally, I’m looking for lids that:
1. Seal tight to lock in aroma
2. Peel off easily without leaving gunk behind
3. Are food-safe
4.Don’t deform when extract coffee
Have any of you found a holy grail brand? Or ones to avoid? Bonus points If they’re eco friendly or come in a value pack.
Thanks in advance for helping me out!",1,1761015601.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1oc1s2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1oc1s2y/just_confused/,Just confused,"I ‘23M’ live with gf ‘24F’ for about two years now. I love her and this is by far the healthiest relationship I’ve had and I’m sure she would say the same. I’m at a point in my life where I’ve moved states multiple times for work and I’ve worked my way up my company. She goes to school online at the moment because my job gave her the opportunity to. When we first started getting serious I told her my goal is to be able to support all of us while she handles the homemaker stuff. Of course I told her I don’t want it to detriment any of her goals like school or apprenticeship or anything she mentioned but with us being young and not having kids but two pets; it’s not a lot of work to keep up with our home. She agreed and at first she was stern on working but after a while she ended up getting scammed and lost her job ( different story) and I was totally supportive and told her to take her time finding something. She deciding she wanted to get a specific medical license since she never had the time or opportunity before and we agreed on the plan. I will mention right now even before she lost her job she struggled doing any chores around the house which I usually just picked up after my day. At first I was I was totally understanding but after a while it started to bother me because it felt like she wasn’t keeping up with her side of the deal. I work a job that consists of a lot of driving , manual labor and meetings and I’ve always felt that necessary chores need to be done before fully relaxing so I’ve always done that. She worked at a coffee shop and would say she’s too tired to do them which like I said I would understand and pick up any chores that were not done then shower and then cook. Which I don’t mind cause I like my own cooking a lot but it does get to me when I expect it at times after a hard day. After she lost her job and was going to school on the computer , it’s she’s too busy to do anything . I’m very much a person that loves routines And I came into the relationship with a dog and he’s a schedule . I would write down the schedules , send reminders and she just wouldn’t take him out until 6 hours after and he’s having accidents because of it. I’ve had talks with her about it and she said she’ll do better and be on it more but more recently I don’t really hear about her doing school besides when I ask or if she’s doing an hour of work on a Saturday. I feel like I constantly have to remind her about things that I don’t want to. I feel bad because I feel like a part of her is trying but idk if she just didn’t grow up cleaning a lot or cooking but it will take a whole two weeks to do fold and put away one load of laundry. Sometimes I feel like maybe it’s just the way I was raised. Single dad household and I came home from school,go to football, do chores , workout and study . I had a whole list of chores I would have to do by the eod. She’s from a two parent household with a sibling so idk if she just didnt do alot of cleaning or cooking but i feel like a dick because she does support me in terms of loving on me and my job and when I do need my recoup she knows exactly what I need. I think it comes with me thinking so far down the line too. Like it’s hard for me to see myself 35 years old and dealing with anything similar of when I come home from working 10-12 hours the house is dirty , she’s laying in the same spot, no dinner , my dog isn’t taken care of properly and living with them. And thinking it makes no sense to fully support them.  But then I tell myself she supports me and cares for me and she’s 100% loyal and everything. Typing it seems like a low bar now but she really is a good girl , I just think she lacks in those areas that are important to me. At times I’m thinking I’m being too harsh because she’s learning and stuff but I’ve brought it up so many times I’m not sure. If it was anyone else I’d be feeling really disrespected but I’m just feeling confused right now. I want to summarize that I love her and have no I’ll anything just confusion.",1,1761015444.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

My name’s London. I live out in the backwoods of Alberta, not far from mountains, where the pines rise like walls and the mountains always feel like they’re watching you. I’ve been an exterminator for years now. It’s not glamorous, but it’s steady work.

People think pest control is all rats and roaches, but half the time it’s just hand-holding. Folks freak out easy when something small scurries across their kitchen floor. I once had a lady call me in almost tears, convinced her house was overrun with mice. When I showed up, she had one mouse hiding behind the toaster. One. She screamed when I pulled the toaster forward and almost fainted when I snapped it in a trap.

Another time, a guy insisted he had “ants everywhere.” I show up, and the problem wasn’t ants at all. He’d spilled sugar in his pantry months earlier and left it. The place was crawling, but not because of some mysterious colony or entry points left unchecked — just because he did not realize he had a mess in the pantry.

Those are the easy days. You laugh, you take the cheque, you move on.  Some days are harder. Specially in Fall and winter season when everything is cold and humid. 

But every once in a while, you get an emergency call. And those are never easy. Some are for racoons inside soffits. Some are for giant wasp nest inside garage that got Knocked down, you can imagine the rest.

This one came from a client I already knew. Downtown in the city i service most. A sleek modern home, all glass and stone. I’d been there a few times. Always polite. The kind of client who shakes your hand, remembers your name, even makes you a coffee while you’re setting traps. Good guy.

So when dispatch told me he needed a service at his cottage, I didn’t think much of it. It was at the end of my day, end of fall season.

The cottage was deep in the woods outside the city. Getting there was a job on its own — winding roads, no cell service, the kind of drive where the forest gets thicker the further you go. The view was fantastic nonetheless. By the time I turned onto the gravel driveway, the sun was low, bleeding orange through the trees.

The place was big. Heavy timber, stone chimney, more like a hunting lodge than a getaway cabin. When he stepped outside, he wasn’t the same man I remembered. No handshake. No small talk. Just a stiff nod and a flat “Thanks for coming.”

He said he’d been hearing rats in the walls. Droppings in the basement. Standard stuff. In my opinion, not worth an emergency call.

Outside, I checked for burrows, chew marks, anything. Not much sign. Just the one entry point leading to the basement. Rubbing marks around, droppings near.  Odd activity, considering how nervous he sounded when he called. The woods were unnervingly still. No birds, no squirrels, nothing but the crunch of my boots.

Inside, I asked if I could do a walkthrough. Normal procedure — I have to check entry points. He said yes… with one condition.

“You can check the kitchen, the attic, wherever,” he said. “But not the wine room.”

It threw me. “Wine room?”

“In the basement,” he said quickly. “It’s locked. You don’t need to go in there.”

The problem was, when I followed the droppings and gnaw marks, they led down  straight to the basement. And right up to a heavy oak door with a brand-new steel latch. The only thing in that basement with a lock.

“That’s the wine room?” I asked.

He was right behind me. Too close. His eyes flicked to the door, then back to me. “Yes. And you’re not going in.”

I told him calmly that the activity was strongest right there. Rats love quiet, sealed rooms. Perhaps an interior bait station next the door or just inside could help, but he cut me off.

“Service stops here,” he said. His tone wasn’t angry — it was afraid.

I didn’t argue. Packed my gear, made a note for the file. He walked me out in silence, and that was that.

On the drive back, I couldn’t shake it. The latch. The smell seeping from the cracks in the oak door. Metallic, like blood mixed with damp soil. 

The next week, I serviced his downtown house again. And there he was — the friendly version of him. Shook my hand, smiled, offered me coffee like always. Like the cottage call had never happened.

But I noticed his hands. Scratched raw, like he’d been handling wire or something sharp.

I asked about the cottage, just casual. His smile wavered. “Taken care of,” he said. Nothing more.

That was two nights ago. I still can’t stop thinking about it. It stuck with me like an itch I couldn’t scratch. I even brought it up to my boss. Told him the whole story, about the locked door, the smell. He shrugged it off. “Clients are weird, London. Take the cheque and move on.”

But I can’t move on.

The thing about pest control is, we do follow-ups. We check bait stations, reinspect problem sites. It’s normal to go back. That’s how I justified it — to myself, and to my boss. I told him I had to check the site again, make sure the rodents weren’t coming back. He didn’t care either way.

So I went back. Alone.

The gravel road was worse in the dark. The forest leaned in, branches clawing at my truck. By the time the cottage came into view, I was sweating despite the cold. The place looked empty. No lights. No car in the drive.

I told myself I’d be quick. Just confirm the entry points, get in, get out.

Inside, the air was heavy, stale. The basement door creaked when I pulled it open. My flashlight beam shook against the concrete walls.

And there it was. The oak door. Steel latch bolted tight. The smell was stronger now.

I pressed my ear against it. At first, nothing. Then… scratching. Slow, deliberate, like nails dragging across wood.

I should’ve left. Every instinct screamed at me to leave. But I didn’t.

I pulled a screwdriver from my kit and wedged it into the latch. It took longer than I expected, every second filled with the sound of my own heartbeat. Finally, with a groan of metal, it gave way.

The smell hit me first — sweet, foul, metallic.

Then the sound. Breathing. Wet, ragged, like something that hadn’t taken a clean breath in years.

I shone my light inside.

It wasn’t wine.

The room was stone, the walls scarred with deep gouges. Chains bolted into the floor stretched taut. And in the corner, crouched low, was something pale. Thin. Too tall for the room, joints bent sharp where they shouldn’t be. Its mouth gaped wide, teeth too many, too long. Its eyes, those red eyes, caught the light and burned.

It turned its head toward me, and in that moment I knew why the forest around this place was silent. Why he didn’t want me near that door. Why his hands were torn raw.

It wasn’t an infestation. It was a cage.

And whatever was inside, it wasn’t supposed to be.

I ran. I don’t even remember shutting the door, don’t remember the drive down that gravel road. Just the weight of those eyes, still on me, even now as I write this.

My boss keeps asking if I’m putting in the report. I haven’t.

Because if I write down what I saw, if I say it out loud, then it’s real.

And I don’t want it to be real.

1oc1gai,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/1oc1gai/m20_chronic_migraine/,M20 Chronic Migraine,"I have been having a chronic migraine for about 1.5 years and am looking for advice on a path forward. 

Context:

Starting in the summer of 2024 I was beginning to ween off of zoloft, a medication I had been on since the beginning of high school. This was a very painful few weeks as I experienced the common withdrawal effects of brain zaps and a terrible headache. After these few weeks, what I could only describe as a really bad headache behind my eyes and constant exhaustion began. Since then I have been constantly visiting doctors trying to diagnose the issue.

Stats:

20, Male, 6'1, 165lbs, White Caucasian, US.

Pain scale 1-10

Symptoms:

Pressure/Pain constantly behind my eyes and temple at a constant 3-4 level, gets worse throughout the day to a 5-7 level. Gets worse faster particularly when using screens (but extended breaks from screens does not help). When the pain gets worse, I can become dizzy, have light sensitivity, and dark spots in my vision. I feel as though the resulting brain fog has impacted my memory greatly. 

Treatments/Medical History:

Official Diagnoses: 

\- Anxiety via a psychiatrist

\- chronic migraines by a neurologist.

\- hyperhydrosis hands/feet/armpits

I am lightly allergic to adhesives.

Treatment History:

\- I have gone to the ER twice, and have been given the general Migraine Cocktail with no success. I also learned during one of my visits that I have an adverse reaction to Abilify. 

\- Cardiologist has cleared me of any heart conditions, and completed a echo-cardiogram of my heart. 

\- Eye Doctor has found no issues with my eyes. They prescribed 0.25 magnification lenses with blue light blockers to try and help but they sadly don't help. 

\- I am currently seeing a Neurologist who as given me quite the battery of medications over the past few years, none of which have helped, and many that have had negative side effects. 

\- I have had a MRI of my brain, and CT w/o contrast of my neck and spine with no shown issues.

\- Also tried a chiropractor for 4 months, and 3 sessions of acupuncture without any improvement.

With help I have put together this lists of medications from memory that I have taken in the past 1.5 years:

\- sumatriptan 50 mg

\- medrol

\- propanolol

\- depakote for a week

\- duloxetine

\- hospital - DHE 45

\- quetiapine - 3 days

\- topiramate, then XR for like 5 months

\- nurtec samples

\- qulipta samples

\- imipramine

\- emgality - 3 months

\- aimovig - 3 months

This is not an exhaustive list because I have been poor about keeping track, nor is it in order, but I should give the right idea about attempted treatments. 

I have tried no gluten or sugar cane for extended periods of time with lackluster results.

Currently I have been on Imipramine for around 8 months via my psychiatrist, and am waiting for my Vyepti infusion from my neurologist. I just started seeing a TMJ specialist this week.

Some other History:

I have had lymes disease 3 times during my childhood (sometime around 2015 and a few years after), after treatment I started having stomach pain and gut problems. I went to doctors for years but never figured out what was wrong. It ended up going away around 2022. Something of note would be that I felt sugary foods would give me a headache, and that gluten would cause intestinal pain. 

  
Sometime also around that time (2019 - 2023) I found myself getting increasingly sensitive to screens. Looking at a monitor or tv for upwards of an hour would cause a similar migraine like pain that I have constantly now. 

  
I am currently a university student studying computer science and am trying my best, but struggling greatly due to the constant pain. The only things that give me ""relief""/allowing me to focus are adrenaline, so my one cup of coffee a day and being stressed is how I have been able to function. I have been finding mood to be increasingly unstable, and in the past few months have had 3 panic attacks, which is new. I am really being worn down by the constant pain, and am desperate for help.

Lyrics:

Honey lemon sugar puff loaf,
My sweetheart I was never there when you needed me most
Raspberry poppyseed ice cream and scones,
I apologize for the relentless lies and the way I’ve always spoke
Strawberry pineapple whip cream cake
I could’ve sworn I was the one and only who knew you the most
Sweet apple cinnamon rolls
I realized too late I was a few decimals away from being on the same page
Banana coffee mocha ganache
Come right here and rant or vent everything you’ve got
Matcha peach marshmallows
I promise I’ll never forget to check in, it wouldn’t happen again
Butterfly pea sweet creamed tea
I’ll beg for your forgiveness I swear I wouldn’t put you through the old wear and tear
Soft chilled mango mochi bingsu
My dear child is that really what I had put you through
Fruit topped Angel food cake 
Why didn’t you tell me that I really wasn’t helping
Grape juice poured over jelly
I never realized how many times I skipped taking you out to the deli
Dragonfruit deep fried cobbler 
You had the strong suit in math with the weakness of a sad home
Kiwi sliced smiley face rice
I raised a darling as fragile as a thin patch of glass
Blueberry light crusted caramel pie
I never took it seriously when you brought up wishing to die
Bitter honeydew core filled bread 
How many sorrys shall I say to pay off my immeasurable debt
half crushed Blackberry cherry tart
Let me try again, I can do my best to amend the broken heart I shattered, 
Honey lemon sugar puff loaf,
I’ll always be there now if I’m the one you say you need most",1,1761014352.0,lyricsforsongwriters,0,1.0,False

So my dad has been married about 2 years now, and I (33F) have been no contact with him for a little over 1 year. I made the decision after attempting to repair the relationship with my dad at the urging of my therapist, or at least see if we could come to some understanding. As you may have guessed, it didn't work out. It ended in me crying and needing to leave, while my dad said, ""So what else are you gonna do tonight?"" 

I don't know his new wife super well - all I know is that she is extremely family oriented and can't understand why I prefer to keep my distance. One of those, ""But he's your dad, you only get one dad"" kind of situations. 

My younger brother recently got married, and I told my dad's wife ahead of time that I'd prefer not to talk to him. Surprisingly, they both respected my wishes and the wedding was really nice. 

Now, his wife wants to get coffee and talk with me 1 on 1. She said there are 2 sides to every story and she wants to hear mine. I'm really nervous and I don't know how to explain things. My dad has put on quite the show for her - he has recently started connecting with family who he had been NC with for over a decade and is going to church regularly, which is very unlike him in every way. 

I know that he hasn't changed though, based on my most recent interaction with him. I tried to explain that I have felt hurt and disrespected by him, to which he responded classically - ""sounds like a you problem, sorry you feel that way, I said sorry what else do you want from me, that didn't happen, etc"".

I need a reality check after 3 years. Me M40 and girlfriend F30,"Apologies for the essay. I promise it’s going somewhere. I need to see how much of this is on me and how much my gf. Or what is actually going on. I don’t have anyone I can talk to about this. 

My girlfriend and I have been together for over 3 years and lived together for most of that time. 

I asked her to move in a month or two into us dating because we got along well, she showed signs of care I had not experienced before and combined with us getting along well I simply saw no point of dragging out something that felt good. 

I was happy to ask and she was pleasantly surprised and agreed. We travelled more than average in the first year and a half and to some nice places either as a holiday or as part of some wedding trips. Travel is always a good test of a relationship and we got along well.

But the combination of below points and the final straw has made me extremely unhappy and I’m getting quite depressed about it. I am going to be as unbiased as possible to make sure I don’t paint a biased picture and would appreciate some opinions.

START

• Our first date was fun but I immediately noticed she had a spirit drink before meeting. No big deal I thought at the time and didn’t think much of it (As of right now it’s not a severe issue). We had fun night, chatted a lot, ended up spending the night together. 

• The next morning everything was cool and then she said something on the lines of not remembering how we ended up in bed. This was quite unpleasant and I didn’t really know what to say because she almost brushed it off.

• I noticed the pattern with alcohol before our meet-ups over the next couple of dates. And when a month or two into us seeing each other I brought it up she said that she does probably drink more than she should and that it is a combination left over from her past relationship and her father’s tendency over the years to abuse alcohol (down to his high level/stressful job). I have history of alcoholism in my family and have seen what it can do to relationships and those around them so I am probably more sensitive to it than most. I drink alcohol when Im out myself (though less now) and I was very careful not to push her immediately but made a mental note. Over the next few months got her into running and with gentle encouragement she stopped using drinks as a primer soon after.

She has less alcohol now but the biggest arguments we had to date would be if alcohol is involved. To the point where I feel stressed if I come home and see her having a glass of wine.



NEXT 2.5 years




• HANDLING ARGUMENTS/COMMUNICATION: 

I dislike arguments and generally try to keep it calm and de-escalate. But when it happens I am used to having the unavoidable arguments take what I think a typical structure: Disagreement ➡️ Escalation when both parties often make their point with raised voices ➡️ De-escalation via talking, making up, after a short timeout, sex.

With her it is two extremes. The least common of which is typically disproportionately raised voice which doesn’t quite reach a shouting stage but almost on the verge. The most common is what I have recently learned is referred to as stonewalling. She would just shut off for a day or two and simply ignore me. Regardless the reason. While living under the same roof.

After approaching her about it she said it’s down to her inability to deal with emotions and finding it difficult to be upset. That she needs time off. I worked with this at first and let her do her thing but over the years has become more and more grinding. 

This stonewalling is compounded by the fact that she would never, I mean never, vocalise her concern or bring up the subject of what bothers her or the argument unless prompted. This prompting would be me checking if something bothers her. The answer would typically be “no” but her demeanour would suggest otherwise. Until she finally lets it out to explain whatever it is. By which point I’ve spent a day or two worrying about it and wondering what’s up. Not in the least an issue at first but over and over again this has become an issue to me.

I spoke to her about needing to communicate better, she agreed on multiple occasions, but nothing ever changed.





• INTIMACY: 

I went into this relationship fresh from a couple of years of playing around following a series of long term monogamous relationships. It was somewhat liberating: the few short experiences helped me to no longer put sex on a pedestal, to curb my jealousy (which was present after one of the earlier girlfriends found someone closer to home following a few years long distance when I would travel to see her). Two of those short flings were with non monogamous women that at least made me understand where they are coming from. In short I was quite sexually charged and relaxed about sex going into this.

• I feel I carried our sex life for the first couple of months. Went in passionate but not overpowering though I knew I had a dom side. But I quickly realised that something between us wasn’t clicking.

• Firstly it became apparent she rarely initiated. 

• We often talked and flirted but the passion wasn’t there. 

• I was careful around how I approached the subject because a few things pointed at some potential trauma. She lost her virginity at a very young age. Another time, still under age she had sex with a 25 y.o. guy that she regrets but at the time went with a flow as he was (as I can only describe it) in an exciting position of power. The 3 some she had in her 20s was with a couple while they were all drinking and she didn’t really want to do or enjoyed it and never seen them afterwards. She also mentioned something about her ex not being quite satisfied because  “she wouldn’t do stuff”.  How she found an exchange between him and his ex on a laptop shortly before they broke up which made her very distrustful and that she doesn’t like people talking to their exes.

• Naturally I made sure not never ask her to “do stuff” and while I don’t expect her to “do stuff” I’ve never been in a relationship where a BJ isn’t something that happens regularly, at least in the beginning. For my part I’m all in her crevices and she loves it but a BJ is just not something it feels like she likes doing so it rarely happens. And I don’t really enjoy it because it is obvious she isn’t into it.

•  Nevertheless I brought up the intimacy issue a couple of times. Her response would vary from “she needs more physical touch” (perfectly understandable) to “she feels scared around me” (at least two years of living together in this dynamic, having a dog, traveling, seeing parents, weddings - to me this was a bit shocking).

• Subsequently she started making more attempts but honestly it felt forced and not what I am used to. I think by that time it was too late and I myself am not feeling it.

• We had a huge argument 2 months ago where a lot of things came up. It started with me asking something about the dog arrangement for the weekend we’d be away. It ended with me being told how I always start arguments and how it has been getting worse. How our lack of intimacy is down to me not showing physical touch. How I’m trying to control her decisions about the dog and that I don’t trust her ability to make the right decision. When I said “I’m your partner, living with you, I’m just your boyfriend asking you something about the arrangement with the dog.” She said I’m being manipulative by saying I’m “just her boyfriend” and that I am belittling the situation. 

When I told her about how not only do I initiate physical touch but that in 3 years she has rarely (this sounds ridiculous) brushed her fingers on my chest or my leg and that I remember her kissing my chest exactly once because of how good it felt and how it made me feel knowing that this doesn’t happen often she suddenly stopped as if a realisation hit her. 

I said that we argue because she doesn’t listen to me. That when we have a conversation she would respond to a seemingly related subject but not really what we are talking about, that at first I thought it was a cute quirk but I started to get more frustrated about it with time especially when an insignificant conversation would turn into an argument when I try to bring her back to the topic. She again paused. And the next day after a few exchanges she said “Jesus you’re right, I don’t listen. I need to be more careful”.  This is after having had such conversations following arguments in the past.




LOVE LANGUAGE 

Almost at the start she asked me what my love language was. It’s not a question I’ve been asked often but my response was that it’s probably through gifts (flowers, chocolates, clothes etc) and physical intimacy. She said, and made a point that it’s through acts of service. And it was evident how caring she is with making me a morning coffee or making dinner for when I get home. I’ve never really experienced this before and it felt nice. I am always grateful but because of the above points re communication and intimacy I always a bit suspicious or uneasy about it.

The flip side of this is that it is evidently her main relationship currency. And when she is upset for some reason it is the only currency that she can withhold. Which she does. And it feels shit. Normally following an argument you might not talk or not have sex but given there is an issue with sex and communication already it seems the only thing she can do is take away the only thing that’s left and one that I find most valuable in this relationship. Suddenly no coffee in the morning, not waiting up for dinner, until all is fine again.

And saving the best till last. In 3 years she hasn’t had a single orgasm while we are together. She said she isn’t sure if she ever had one as part of a bigger conversation. Moving on.




DOG

Live our dog. But it is hers and she got him before we got together. I never thought of this but for the first time in my life I am jealous of the fucking dog. She cuddles him. Pecks him. Stokes him. Which is fine.

Except that when we are on a sofa she would sometimes kiss my shoulder or my head in exactly the same “peck” way. I’ve even said out of frustration “I’m not the dog, don’t kiss me like that”.




LIKING INSTAGRAM PHOTOS/EXE’s

Up to this point I’m understanding I telling myself that she is caring, that sex goes eventually anyway, that we travel and have fun, that we can work on communication. I see the positives and try not to think of what (to me at least) are the negatives.

6 months ago she tells me she noticed me liking some girls photos on insta. She approaches the subject knowing that the girl and I were involved in the past. Though nothing should suggest that to be the case I don’t hide it. 

I am very active on socials. I tell her as it is: Someone I knew in the past. She was down and out when we were dating and was making big plans. So if I seen some photos where it looks like she is successful in her new ventures I clicked a like here and there. We have no left over feelings. Parted on good terms. I probably like 4-5 posts in 3 years. That I’m not hiding anything and I know that whatever posts I interact with have a likelihood to be shown to other people. 


I totally understand my gf’s concern. a. liking a photo of a transient relationship (don’t know how she knows that) b. This girl is at some conference or some bussiness thing looking a bit glammed up. I do my best to alleviate her worry and she seems to believe me. 

She expresses her concern because of her experience with ex boyfriend and tells me she doesn’t like when I like photos or see my exes. And I say it’s not a thing, my feed has a thousand people and if I scroll I may have liked a photo but it’s not as she thinks me trying to stay on her radar.  

And regarding seeing exes, when we were first dating I told her there was a girl i was dating that I was going to meet. That she has nothing to worry about and that  i am asking if she would be ok with that. She was and that was it. But obviously it stayed with her.


What shouldn’t have said, or worded it differently, is “You won’t find anyone that mattered to me on my Instagram as I don’t follow or let anyone follow me”. But I said and I know it didn’t sit well with her as she brought it up at some point recently.





FINALLY to the issue.

We are on a summer break in August. Her parents are staying at mine and we are at theirs. She tells me her dad is asking how to get netflix to work on a new TV that i hadn’t had the time to set up properly. I give a series of instructions. She writes them down in Whatsaap and sends. A few moments later she said it’s not working so I look at the message and say “No that’s wrong”. She doesn’t like the way I say it. Stands up and walks out to have a shower. We don’t speak for the next 24 hours.

While she is in the shower I am finishing the text to her dad. Send it. Forget it’s her iPhone. Exit message. And something catches my eye. I KNOW I shouldn’t have but I open a message at the bottom of the screen. The message has no past history and opens with (paraphrasing):

Him - Hi just wondering how you are.

Her - Hi good to hear from you. All good. What you up to. 

Him - work, life, still in city X. What about you.

Her - Currently at my parents house while they are at ours. They at home looking after the dog while we are staying at theirs. Got some work projects over the next few months. Will probably be in City X next month. We should go for a drink.

Him - I would love that.

Me - THE fuck you are! 

(Not really I didn’t reply).


The message ends there. By this point I don’t know what to feel. I don’t jump to any conclusions. Could be anything. Obviously an ex but could be anything.

What I take out of that message. 1. Ex. 2. No prior history so message were deleted in the past. 3. Nothing defined about “me and my boyfriend” instead an undefined “we”. 3. Un promoted invitation for a drink when traveling by her self to another city in another country.

I stay calm and go to bed. 

A day of stonewalling. I ask how come she just made a coffee for herself. Leads to a small argument. She says she just wants time to her self, first days on holiday and we don’t need to always be in each others faces. Friends arrive for bbq. We hang out, have some drinks, I put message out of my mind, have a nice afternoon. She smiles (she rarely just smiles), I’m happy. 

In the evening she is suddenly off. Brings up yesterday’s situation how I said “No it’s wrong” re Netflix message to her dad. I’m just looking at her. 

I go out for a smoke. She comes out after shower and we talk. I talked about her new job. How she’s got an exciting trip. Ask if she has any friends in the city she could hang out with while there. She replies “No. It’s going to be hectic. Barely any time to myself”.

For the next month she is super stressed with work, coming home late, I make sure food is ready, make her coffee. Bring up her upcoming trip once or twice. Same answer.

Trip doesn’t come though but her whatsaap notifications are now private on her phone. 

Finally Insee her upset again I ask what is up. She says how she liked me being attentive and then yet another argument we had made her upset. She doesn’t understand what’s happening with me as something seems off.

I finally tell her about the message. I first say I know I shouldn’t have looked at your messages and we can discuss it separately but I saw the message.

What follows is what can only be described as an attack. If I can like photos she feels she can do the same. If I can see my exes she felt like she could do too. 

Not a hint of embarrassment. Not a single apology.  

Next day we had to see some friends and after a few drinks got home. The dog cuddles up to me on the sofa she sits next to me and says something like “I know we say it’s our dog but you’re fooling yourself. It’s my dog.” WTF.

The next few days all our exchanges are via text, all of them are just justifications. Not explanation. Nothing. Apology about the dig comment “I was drunk and shouldn’t have said it”

I explain how this situation could not be further from being the same. I was always transparent and hid nothing. Asking an ex for a drink, when traveling to another country, then hiding and lying about it is t the same. She wouldn’t have it. I just left the room.

Slept in another room for 7 days, visibly upset yet during which time she hasn’t once came to talk to me. Apparently because she was tiptoeing around me. 

I couldn’t really make a big deal out of it as her nan suddenly passed away last week during that time, funeral etc.

She me a message (my girlfriend not the nan) to say do I want to go and do something one evening. I said as much as I appreciate she must be upset atm that I don’t think we should be making plans until we speak.

When we have another conversation she is still not showing anything that makes me think she believes that she did anything wrong. She tells me it’s an ex. She “acted out”. She doesn’t say “I’m sorry” but keeps saying things like “I’m sorry how it made you feel”. Or “I’m sorry it upset you”. When she tries to hug hug me in the sofa I reject it and at that moment she suddenly says (after almost 10 days) “I just realised  that I must have really upset you” and I swear it looks like she just understood. 

I press her on the subject. Try to not let her stray. When she talks about me liking other photos or seeing exes I tell her I understand that upsets you, we can discuss it as a separate issue. Right now I want to know why she has acted in that way, what is in her head. 

At first she says there is nothing romantic. Just a guy she owns for 10 years who occasionally sends a message and that she tries to ignore because she doesn’t know if it’s friendly or not and doesn’t want to entertain it. How it’s same as what I’m doing.

I tell her that a breach of trust/lying and liking some photographs on the Instagram are very different. That HIS expectations are now very different. (He sent another message apparently to say “I guess your work trip didn’t go ahead”) 

Eventually she says something on the lines of “Ok, I was pushing buttons. If the situation between us was different I probably wouldn’t have done it).




In the grand scheme of things it doesn’t seem like a big deal but given our history, intimacy, communication, her being very specific about not having conversations behind her back with exes etc.  I feel very betrayed as her fidelity was probably the thing I was most confident in.

So that’s the whole story and I just realised I’ve written too much. I’ll post it anyway as it was good to put it down. if you can help me clear my head and put things in perspective I’d appreciate it.

Hi, let me introduce myself.  My names Tammy and I love to eat.  

Let’s dive into a pool of Jello.  With my last boyfriend, he was a feeder.  Our intimacy was food and food only.  It’s cleaner that way, disease free and nobody can say you cheated.  

Jimmy fed me all the time.  We’d go to Golden Corral. He was really good at saving up his reward points so we got free buffets.  His “thing” was he liked to watch me eat when I was full.  He liked to force me and hear me cry about it. 

Which as you can guess meant eating plates of spaghetti followed by mounds of ice cream with cookies stuck in them.  Then forcing me to go to Tim Horton’s right after for fried fritters. 

I’ve tried everything on ever buffet for 500 miles.  Amish food.  Had that.  Korean buffet. Check.  On some dates we’d go to Cheesecake Paradise and he’d get especially piqued to watch me order whatever big, fat, luscious cheesecakes I wanted.  The more we ate, the more rewards.  It was the never ending cycle. 

And now I’m hooked, I get sick without him spoon feeding me figgy pudding. My heart longs for him to pick up one more banana split and shove it into my mouth. 

Just call me Little Debbie cause I’m going to Cracker Barrel to have some strawberry shortcake and I’m feeling nutty.  Let’s put some cayenne on it.  Extra hot honey.  Butter. 


I reach the restaurant, the smell of coffee and eggs greets me.  I strut towards the place where Jimmy and I always sat.  My mind recalls the Key Lime pie. 

I give in.  The phone volume seems shallow.  I hit the volume up, “Jimmy, I give up.  I need you.” 

“It’s boy only night,” Jimmy blurts out and I realize is blocking me.  

I start to cry, ""Jimmy, will you feed me?""

The line went silent.

We were really close in high school, part of a small group of four girls and two guys. After high school and during the first years of university, we still hung out, but I slowly noticed that some of the others were meeting up without me.

I felt excluded, but I didn’t have the courage to say it. I didn’t want to sound needy or awkward by asking, “Hey, why don’t you invite me too?” So I kept quiet and just distanced myself.

Around 2020, when the pandemic started, I went through a really bad breakup. I isolated myself a lot and started pretending I was okay, going out, distracting myself, but emotionally shutting down. During that time, I basically ignored Maria, even though she still checked in with me from time to time.

Even so, in my heart, she always remained someone I cared about deeply. When I got better emotionally, I reached out again. I told her I was doing well, that I was in a new relationship, and she told me she was in a really bad place — depressed, wanting to cut people off, and that she didn’t want to talk anymore.

I checked on her a few more times afterward, just to ask if she was okay or wanted to meet, but she kept refusing. And lately, I realized that maybe neither of us was completely honest, we both hurt each other in different ways, even if we didn’t mean to.

I’ve been thinking about messaging her again, maybe asking her out for coffee, but I don’t want to seem inconsiderate or intrusive. I’m not sure if she’s emotionally open to reconnecting. Part of me still misses her a lot, and part of me is scared she’ll ignore me again.

For context, before we drifted apart, she sometimes said she “couldn’t go out,” only for me to find out she was out with other friends. It hurt, but I guess we both made mistakes.

I really don’t know if reaching out again would help or make things worse. Should I just send a small, kind message, or is it better to leave it and let time do its thing?",2,1761013664.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False
1oc15ik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1oc15ik/18_unlucky_sorce_reviews/,18 Unlucky Sorce Reviews,"Unfortunately I am easily swept up in good reviews and witchy branding so I've tried a lot of Sorce despite almost no success! I cannot shake my curiosity and at this point it's almost comical how much my nose refuses to smell what everyone else is smelling. I have a tiny decant of Vampire Husband on the way and THEN I OFFICIALLY ADMIT DEFEAT. Sharing my journey of trying to make Sorce happen for me so you can laugh at my pain or experience solidarity as another nose that refuses to enjoy the hype 🫶✨️  
  
**2 AM in Lafayette** *(vanilla c02, oakmoss, cafe au lait, caramel, beignets, powdered sugar):* It smells like coffee and bread in the bottle. On my skin it's very sugary, caffeinated, and almost salty or savory? Incredibly rich. Sadly, I don’t get any of the darkness, oakmoss, or earthiness I’ve heard people speak of, and the longer it’s on my skin the more it smells like Just Caramel.
  
**A Sign Painted Peaches** *(peach nectar, sun-warmed peach skin, saffron, gardenia, ambergris, vanilla absolute, vetiver)*: BUBBLEGUM. It mellows out within a few minutes and becomes warm, creamy, a touch floral. But it maintains a seriously sugary, peachy bubblegum quality. It's a shame because I can smell this underlying pretty, slightly spicy, fruity-floral smell but oh my god it's trampled by bubblegum.  
  
**Cabanilla** *(salted vanilla, sand, palm fronds, driftwood, a cracked coconut, brown sugar, balsam of Peru, and a distant beach bonfire)*: Salty, sugary, coconutty vanilla. This is fine.  
  
**Cake For Breakfast** *(birthday cake, ripe mango, pineapple, coffee, maple syrup, and a hint of cardamom)*: Spicy maple syrup. Tragic.  
  
**Falling Stars** *(warm blend of black coffee, almond cream, sandalwood, natural oud, palo santo oil, tonka bean absolute, and vanilla bean)*: I tried the Cookie Butter Oat Milk Iced Latte and Cardamom Orange Cream With Brown Sugar versions and wasn’t into either of them. At first they mostly smell like sweet coffee and wood, but then the very strong smell of playdough emerges. Probably another skin chemistry issue because so many people love these! Cookie Butter Oat Milk starts out deceivingly, beautifully buttery and chocolatey. But that rapidly fades and is replaced by intense playdough. Cardamom Orange Cream is delightfully spicy and at least less playdoughy.  
  
**Fuckery** *(luxardo cherry, caramelized sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, sandalwood, tobacco absolute, smoke, night air, white musk)*: Light spices, sweet cherries, and a slightly clean vibe. I was hoping for something darker. So many other reviews said the tobacco/smoke/spice elements were very noticeable but my nose refuses to pick these out. This is a sugary and sort of clean smell to me.  
  
**Good At Being Bad** *(dark, salted vanilla, buttercream, honey, jasmine):* Creamy, sweet vanilla and jasmine. Something about it genuinely makes me think of coffee creamer. But it’s also jasminey and somehow that doesn’t clash? Dark, warm, sweet, creamy. My only complaint is that it’s predominantly an unexciting vanilla smell, but it is a GOOD boring vanilla smell, with a pinch of floral pizzazz.  
  
**Her Kind** *(amber, musk, sandalwood, benzoin, cashmeran, myrrh, vanilla, wisp of smoke):* Something about the vanilla/wood/smoke combo reminds me of the marshmallow/campfire combo from Hexennacht's All Soul’s Night. A little smoky, has a burnt sugar quality. Warm, dark, sweet, slightly woody, feels sort of smooth or soft. It's like a darker, witchy version of those standard sugary vanilla perfumes. About 3 hours later it's simply that burnt, almost sharp, sugary smell which makes the idea of wearing this less appealing.  
  
**Love And Complications** *(brown sugar, sweetened condensed milk, plumeria, passionfruit, soft woods):* This is SOUR. Sugary fruit, creamy sweetness, a barely perceptible woody quality. Dangerously close to straight up sour candy.  
  
**Match Made In Heaven** *(matcha, vanilla soft serve, cherry blossom, almond, waffle cone, powdered sugar, creamy sandalwood):* A pinch of dark, earthy matcha but predominantly powdery vanilla and cherry blossoms. Very pretty! Not my thing at all.  
  
**Mermaids Sing Of Lost Lovers** *(grenadine, jasmine, ylang ylang, white chocolate, caramel, ambergris):* Sweet, warm, almost salty? Intoxicating florals, not sharp or stinky. Just the right amount of toasted, caramely sweetness. Really in love with the musky, salty, humid air feeling. Everything blends together beautifully to create this perfect Warm Sweet Salty Beachy smell. I didn't have high hopes for this and somehow it's one of my top scents and the only Sorce scent I upgraded to a full size.  
  
**Serpentine** *(ripe figs, fig leaf, cardamom, caramelized honey, vanilla, peru balsam, cedar, iso e super):* Jammy, fruity sweetness and spice. Comes dangerously close to holiday candle territory. I want to love this but something is off. A deep, dark, golden glow of spice and honey paired with an artificial spicy candle smell.  
  
**String Of Lights In The Forest** *(beeswax, ambroxan, vanilla milkshake, lavender maillette, clean and light vetiver):* Predominantly a pillowy marshmallow smell while wet. I think that's how my brain interprets the vanilla milkshake note. Becomes more herbal and green while drying, but it's in no way bitter or sharp. I very rarely enjoy lavender in fragrances but this is such a soft, pleasant presentation. The end result is a warm, sugary, herbal vanilla. OH NO WAIT about half an hour has passed, it is more sharp, “perfumey,” and clean. It's still nice but shifted enough to not even think about getting a full size.  
  
**The Bees** *(egyptian jasmine, honey, pollen, iris, myrrh, mimosa absolute, cedar, fresh cream, petrichor):* When first applied it makes me think of sweetened condensed milk. It rapidly shifts into powdery, sweet jasmine and honey. As the minutes go by, the powdery qualities and honey become overwhelming. This was almost a pretty, soft scent capturing a lovely spring vibe. A few minutes on my skin turns it into a sickeningly sweet powder bomb.  
  
**The Ghost Wants Birthday Cake** *(warm peach cake spiced with ginger, cinnamon, and cardamom; vanilla bean ice cream, mysore sandalwood, australian sandalwood)*: Juicy peaches and spices piled on top of cake. Very well done but too sugary and Literally Just Food for my taste.  
  
**Venus In Fleurs** *(ripe mango, carnivorous plants, humidity, jasmine sambac, vanilla absolute):* Jasmine and candy-sweet mango when first applied. The sweetness recedes over time, becoming less blatantly sugary. It becomes humidity, jasmine, sweetness, and the vague idea of a mango. Slightly dark and green. Not really my thing, but I liked it more than I expected and it would be magical in warm weather.  
  
**Witchery** *(blackberries, wild violets, galbanum, green stems and thorns, oakmoss, benzoin, tree moss, wet stone, mountain mist):* I like this a lot more than I expected! This is lacking the sharpness I perceive in a lot of mossy, naturey smells and it definitely has a damp/misty vibe. Fruity and sweet without approaching candy-like. Woody in a way that makes me think of those creamy, resinous vanilla scents. Not realistic but a beautiful fantasy representation of nature. This feels super soft and romantic to me? The main character in your favorite romantasy novel running through the misty forest to her lover.  
  
**Your Girlfriend Is A Badass** *(yellow cake, fudge icing, oakmoss, cedar, forest floor):* Patchouli? Just kidding, it’s only the stinky (affectionate) dark earthy vibes that are making me think there’s patchouli in this. Initially I really enjoy this, it’s delightfully dark and earthy and slightly sweet. But after about fifteen minutes it becomes very sharp and strangely soapy. Ugh I thought I was going to like this for a second.

I've been fairly consistent about catching over half his streams since. And so let me tell you, this 2 minute and 12 second stream today was a condensed masterclass the average viewer won't comprehend/appreciate. It is like watching UFC with no fighting experience, you just won't \*get it\*.

However, this stream, perchance, dare I say it, could distilled the ""Atrioc Experience (TM)"" more than anything I could show someone until now. No YouTube video he has ever made, no short, no Big A clip captures the magic more than this stream did. It had it ALL. A really energetic/joyful/blissful ""hello hello hello"" intro, his iconic laugh at his own random sentence, saying hello to chat, subtly mentioning highly sophisticated insider jokes (glizzy, coffee cow, being old, being bald, the latter two being more just truths than jokes but whatever, etc.), thanking subs which honestly is pretty rare as we know, calling out esoteric truths about the world based off his tenured wealth of research, a flimsy/unconvincing/hilarious explanation on why he is massively slacking/lacking (overflowing with hubris mind you), promising to lock in (you know how that goes), and giving a heartfelt farewell to his beloved chat.

How does he do it? We may never know. All I know is that this stream probably won't be topped anytime soon. Feel free to put your heartfelt experience of the stream below, I'd love for this to be a moment of community and sharing for this work of art he so frivolously bestowed upon us.",15,1761013508.0,atrioc,1,1.0,False

I wish moving on had a formula something I could follow so that when I see pictures of you with our friends, I wouldn’t find myself right back at square one. Sometimes, I ask God how long it will take for me to finally get over you. For months now, I’ve been keeping myself busy, trying to drown out the thoughts of you, but in the stillness of my idle moments, my heart always finds its way back. I wonder how much it would cost me if I just followed my heart.

There are times I don’t want to think anymore. I just want to show up at your door, act like nothing happened, pretend we never broke. But I know you’d be mad, and I shouldn’t cross that line. Still, there are so many what ifs wandering in my heart questions I’m too afraid to say out loud because they might break me even more. The silence between us speaks louder than words ever could when I ask something and you just look at me, blank and distant. I don’t know how much more of that I can take.

I remember last year, when I saw someone who looked like you outside a coffee shop. My heart stopped. My knees shook, and all I wanted to do was run but I stayed. I needed to free myself, even though deep down, I knew if it were really you, you’d hug me like you always did, no matter the hurtful words we’d said before.

Dear, I wish you well. These days have been rough, and my heart feels like a battlefield. I don’t know what to do anymore. I used to tell you all my fears, and even with friends around me now, nothing compares to the comfort of your presence. I truly found a home in you.

And maybe I’m not really asking you to love me not anymore. I guess what I truly want is something harder to admit: I want to demand to be your girl, to know, without question, that I am yours. But I know I can’t. Because love that’s demanded isn’t love at all it’s just longing dressed in hope. 🤷🏻‍♀️",2,1761013387.0,PinoyUnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

i (F19) used to think i was a very sociable person, used to think i had an easy time getting to know others and always made sure others felt happy and comfortable around me. i never really had any issues making friends or anything, but i've always had this deep feeling that i was always the ""friend of convinience"" - only texted when no one else could hang out, most of the times not even texted at all.

it came in waves, from time to time. i would come to this realization for a few weeks, be really sad, and then forget it happened because although i continued to hang with these people i cared about, i still had a few friends that didn't make me feel like this.

ever since i started uni, last year, this hit me harder than ever. naturally, people from my hometown started hanging out less and less i haven't been able to make a lot of friends at uni, those i got to know either stopped talking to me and other members of the friend group over a subject we've tried to make ammends with already or i'm not that close with. i see everyone around me has made friends at uni and i feel like i, being in the next to last year of studies, missed out. not only that, but friends that i used to rely on and never made me feel alone did me really dirty this year. went on trips that we all planned without me, left me on read for plans we made for my birthday, got mad at me because i'm no longer the type to go out and get drunk, are making comments about me behind my back...

i also realized that no one i know texts me first to make plans or even just to talk. absolutely no one. people still invite me to birthday parties and to have a coffee when they have a spare time to kill and i happen to be nearby and everyone else is busy - i can always tell because its usually people who always turn down my invitations.

people are still nice when we happen to see each other. honestly, in person, it feels like nothing happened, until i come home and i never hear from them again until the next birthday party we meet at.

i feel so alone. i've been spending all my days at home because i have no one to hang out with and it breaks my heart. i don't know what's wrong with me or why people don't want to hang out with me. i'm seriously considering seeking a mental health professional because i've never spent this long feeling so alone and i have no one to talk about this. i can't rant with people because i don't want them to hang out with me out of pitty, or talk to my parents because it breaks my heart to even consider the idea of them being sad or feeling pitty over their adult daughter who doesn't have even one friend.

i'm wondering, has anyone been through something similar? if so, what did you do, what helped?

Brands spend millions on ads that look amazing but completely miss the mark on what actually makes people stop, feel something, and share. Generic advice from tools like ChatGPT isn't cutting it anymore because it lacks real-world, competitive context.

So, we ran an experiment. We pointed our brand-trained AI at the Food & Beverage industry and analyzed **1,736 top-performing ads** from major players. The video I attached shows the results in action.

The single biggest insight?

**Brands are obsessed with selling ""Spectacle""** (the perfect, glossy, studio-shot burger), **but customers connect with and share ""Sensation""** (the joy on someone's face as they take the first bite, the steam rising from a hot coffee, the cheese-pull).

This is what we call ""Everyday Magic""—the small, human moments that are far more relatable and shareable than a polished product shot. We were able to prove this by breaking down every single ad into its core components (as you can see in the thumbnail examples) to find the patterns that truly work.

Right out of the box, it was basically ready to go. Just two quick steps to unfold and I was off. That was a relief because I honestly hate fiddling with stuff. Compared to my old chair that needed endless parts to attach and remove, this one felt like really great.

This week I used it for grocery shopping, coffee with a friend, and short rides around my neighborhood. It handled ramps, narrow sidewalks, small curbs, and light gravel smoothly. The joystick felt responsive, the screen was easy to read, and the smart speed control slowed automatically during turns and slopes.

Battery life seemed solid for short runs. My only minor issues are the slightly high footrest and limited storage, but both are manageable.

Overall, it is steady and surprisingly easy to use, making outings feel possible again. Hope this gives some useful info if you’re considering the W3. I’m still learning my way around this chair too, and I’d love to hear what you think.",2,1761012753.0,wheelchairs,1,1.0,False
1oc0uan,https://i.redd.it/s7x1y11yidwf1.png,Coffee break,"That two-panel cartoon is a visual parable about mixing and stabilization — what happens when a system has already reached its limit of transformation.



In Panel 1, the cream is just beginning to swirl through the coffee: beautiful filaments of white and brown twist together, still distinct. This stage mirrors the early rounds of DES or the early evolution of a quantum wavefunction — each operation adds complexity, increasing diffusion or entanglement. Small changes in input spread explosively.



In Panel 2, the liquid is fully mixed. The swirl is gone, replaced by smooth uniformity. Here, the system has achieved equilibrium — further stirring changes nothing. In cryptography, this is the “avalanche limit”: after enough rounds, each bit of input affects every bit of output, and additional mixing no longer adds security. In quantum mechanics, it’s when interference patterns stabilize into probabilistic consistency.



The cartoon’s point is quiet but profound:

all complex systems — physical, informational, or biological — pass from chaos to calm.

Beyond a certain threshold, more motion adds no meaning.

# Kinjo Sukai (JO1) talks about his love of fashion and new song 'Handz In My Pocket'
*An interview that ranges from his group's fifth anniversary year to his individual activities.*

*By Yoko Miyake and Ai Tsubota (Translated by OP)  
October 17, 2025*

---

Kinjo Sukai makes his first solo appearance at ELLE. He is a member of JO1, who will be releasing their 10th single ""Handz In My Pocket"" on October 22nd. The group celebrated their fifth year anniversary this year and made a buzz with their first Tokyo Dome concert, a world tour that included North America, their attendence in international festivals, and the release of their documentary film.

Individually, Kinjo also made his runway debut in Seoul this summer, and his avant-garde everyday fashion has come to frequently draw attention. As he is known for his keen fashion sense, we sat down with him to explore his approach to fashion. This feature also includes fashion portraits of him dressed in three different fall/winter looks.

# Interview

""I don't really have any fixed ideas about fashion, and I think I view it with clean perspectives. It's more about my personal preference rather than the latest trends or a brand's background. Brands only start to draw me in after I find something I like and learn more about them. Things like silhouettes and designs, for example -- items that show the craftsmanship of the creator are what catch my eye at first. Out of my recent discoveries, it'd be Rick Owens. I became interested in the brand after my first time wearing it for a magazine shoot, so I went out of my way to buy these really cool boots of theirs! Even the styling suggestions already had me thinking 'whoa!' I love imaginative things like that.

""Timeless, classic pieces that you can wear for a long time are nice, but I want my fashion to look striking, too (laughs). Part of it is me wanting to stand out, but I guess you could also say that I want to embody the designer's creative spirit... That's why I keep buying slightly eccentric pieces every season. I treasure the pieces that resonate with me, even as time passes.""

**Among your collection of treasured pieces is jewelry from Cartier.**

""It started when I gifted my mom a Cartier watch. Since then, I've been collecting watches and jewelry from Cartier. I think their jewelry really brings out a personal side of me and makes me shine. It puts me in a better state of mind and motivates me. My go-to items are the 'Trinity' and 'Juste un Clou' rings and bracelets. When I want to be a bit daring or want to go big for a performance, I'll top it off with the 'Panthère' ring. I often buy jewelry before a big job as motivation. Like, before our LA show, I was feeling fired up and bought something at the airport. Or like when I bought a watch before our world tour. This year felt like a pivotal year to me, so a lot of new pieces have joined my collection (laughs).""

## *When buying new clothes, I ask myself, ""Will wearing this excite me?""*

**Your personal clothes are always fresh and often become a topic of conversation. Do you have a particular approach to building your wardrobe?**

""I always ask myself, 'Will wearing this excite me?' It goes something like, 'What will I be doing in this jacket? Does it go with anything I already have? Nah, it's okay if it doesn't. I'm sure I'll enjoy it wearing it, right?' So yeah, I'm definitely the type to fall in love with something at first sight. There's no planning involved in the makeup of my wardrobe (laughs). When I see something nice, I just want to try it on right away. To some extent, I'm pretty satisfied once I get to try something on... So I get really happy when I'm able to wear all sorts of clothes during shoots like this. If this had been a store instead, I would've had the urge to take these clothes home with me (laughs).""

**In September, you made made your debut as a runway model at Seoul Fashion Week.**

""I was incredibly nervous. More specifically, I somehow didn't feel nervous during the actual show. But the day before, when I got to watch another brand's show from the front row, I thought, 'Wow, I'm going to do this tomorrow,' and felt unbelievably nervous. But since I perform on stages all the time, I guess I'm used to being up there. That's why I was all right when the moment came (laughs).""

**You had a unique aura as you confidently walked down the runway with your hood pulled low and in unconventional makeup. But apparently there was a minor mishap.**

""The people before and after me were both very experienced professional runway models, so I was focusing on matching their walking pace. But unexpectedly, ahead of me was a shoe that someone had dropped. If it had happened on stage, I would've just kicked or thrown it to the side, but I was panicking because I didn't know the etiquette for runways. The model right after me picked it up and carried it off like a bag. I was so impressed by that.""

**A lot of the JO1 members are fashion enthusiasts. Who do you always go shopping with?**

""(Kimata) Syoya, by a long shot. I'm often the one doing the inviting. I'd say, 'Hey, there's a store I want to see. Let's check it out,' and he almost always comes along. And once we're there, he buys way more than I do (laughs). I'm the kind of person who gives reasonable feedback, though. When Syoya's unsure about something, I ask him, 'Are you sure you'd wear it?' And he asks the same for me, like, 'Do you need that right now?' We've known each other for so long that we can tell whether the other actually wants something or if it's just for the rush of buying something. But seeing people shop makes me happy, so I end up encouraging him to buy things anyway (laughs).""

## *JO1, unrelenting passion with a certain ease*

**JO1 will release their monumental tenth single, 'Handz In My Pocket' on October 22nd. While its novel, game-like concept feels fresh, the group has grown more refined than ever and reveals their power during performances on music shows.**

""It feels like JO1's passion is on full display. The dance is intense, but not in the typical way -- there's a bit of ease to it. The song expresses how we want to display the passion that's deep within ourselves, and perfectly balances it with a sense of constraint. There's a bit of playfulness to the concept, too, so I think JAM will appreciate its freshness.""

**The music video makes extensive use of intricate CGI. Which part of the filming process made a lasting impression on you?**

""(At the time of this interview,) I haven't seen the finished version yet, but there's a scene where I hit a flying shuriken with a hammer. Although it was meant to had CGI added to it, we ended up filming it dozens of times because my timing and form needed to match, or because the camera angle needed readjusting. The muscles and veins on my arm aren't CGI there (laughs), so I hope everyone looks out for that part. It took a lot of effort, so please watch it lots of times.""

**Your personal favorite track from the single is an up-tempo song called ""RUSH"".**

""I was responsible for two key parts in the song, so my vocal ability was really put to the test. Part of its concept involves combat sports, so there are lines like 'upper cut that severs fate'. I kind of feel drawn to it because I used to do karate. There's another line that goes, 'the word impossible doesn't exist', which really resonated with me.""

**2025 is a pivotal year that marks JO1's milestone fifth anniversary. From March, your world tour brought you to six cities around the world, which included New York, Los Angeles, and various countries in Asia. In April, you held a highly anticipated two-day concert at Tokyo Dome. And in the summer was the theatrical release of your second documentary film. Among these many major events, which was the most memorable for you?**

""They're all precious moments to me, but the Tokyo Dome concert definitely stands out as the most memorable. I've performed at Tokyo Dome for various other events before, but standing on its stage for a solo concert is completely different. The best part of it was the volume of cheers. I could hear them right through my in-ear monitors. And above all else, it was great that we were involved in all of the show production ourselves. It was something we created after continually working through the ideas the members wanted to do. Of course, there were lots of things we could've done better. But since our goal is to hold a dome tour someday, I see this as a stepping stone for what comes next. My only regret is that my mom was busy and couldn't actually come to watch us at the dome. I felt lonely as the only one whose family couldn't attend. Later, after she saw JAM's reactions on social media and watched the performance video we released on YouTube, she called me to say, 'You were amazing!' I definitely want her to come see us next time.""

## *Looking back on five years: Q&A about the members*

**Q. Compared to five years ago and now, which member has changed the most and which member has changed the least?**

The one who's changed the most is Mame (Mamehara Issei). His features have matured and become more dignified. His personality was more mellow in the past, but now he's manlier after all the experiences he's been through. The one who's changed the least is Syoya. I love that he lives life exactly the way he wants! There's also (Kawanishi) Takumi! From debut till now, his face has always been dignified and handsome! Well, I guess I'm just into that type of face.

**Q. Even after five years together, which member's behavior is still incomprehensible to you?**

That'd be (Kono) Junki. His tendency to lose things is part of it, but sometimes he makes me think, 'Are you really gonna make that joke here?' He's still unpredictable to me. I think it's funny when he looks embarrassed after he tells an unfunny joke.

**Q. Looking back, which member do you think really understands you?**

(Shiroiwa) Ruki and Syoya. I talk to both of them a lot during breaks in practice. It feels like we have similar tastes in fashion and take from similar sources of inspiration. And (Kawashiri) Ren, too! I think we share pretty similar perspectives on the group and on what kinds of activities we should do.

**Q. Which member do you honestly feel is out of your league?**

(Yonashiro) Sho. Honestly, he's unshakeable and always calm. The only times he loses his composure are when he’s hungry or when he hasn’t had his coffee. He doesn't get irritable, but you can clearly feel his energy drop (laughs). Plus, he's really good at keeping the younger members in check and communicating with staff members. We rely on him a lot when we work overseas, too.

**Q. Which member would you want to carry around in your pocket? Whose pocket would you like go in for a peek at their daily life?**

The one I'd carry around is (Sato) Keigo. He's always funny, so I could probably pop him out when I want to be cheered up and he'd make me laugh. The one I'd like to peek at is Ren. He's still a mystery to me. I once went into Ren's apartment a really long time ago. Given his personality, you'd assume that his home would be neat and organized, but there was surprisingly a lot of stuff everywhere. It’s quite a contrast to the image people have of him. I'd love to sneak a peek at that.",1,1761012706.0,jo1,1,1.0,False

1oc0m9a,https://youtu.be/yLXisbB3Hyo,4 Very Scary TRUE Isolated Desert Road Horror Stories,"# ""The Vanishing Place"":

I never thought a simple walk home from the bus stop could turn into something so wrong.

My sister Anna and I lived on the far edge of the Navajo reservation, where the land stretches wide and bare for miles—just red dirt, sagebrush, and wind under a sky that never seemed to end. That afternoon in May, the school bus dropped us off at the same dusty pull-off it always did, where the road turned to gravel and then to dirt. Home was only a quarter mile away, an easy walk we made every day.

Anna was eleven, full of restless energy, her dark braid swinging as she skipped ahead with her backpack bouncing. I was nine, dragging my feet, kicking rocks just to hear them clatter against the hard earth.

That’s when the red van appeared, rolling toward us from the opposite direction. Dust trailed behind it like smoke. It wasn’t a vehicle I recognized—most folks around here drove old pickups or faded sedans, nothing shiny, nothing red.

The van slowed. The driver leaned out the window, his arm resting casually on the door. “Hey, kids,” he called, voice steady and friendly. “Need a lift? Looks like a long walk.”

Anna stopped. I saw her shoulders tense before she turned halfway back to me. “We shouldn’t,” she whispered. “Mom said not to talk to strangers.”

I nodded, but curiosity tugged at me. The man had a scruffy beard and dark, steady eyes. He looked like someone who’d worked outside all his life—tanned skin, calloused hands gripping the wheel.

He smiled, showing crooked teeth. “Come on now, I’m heading that way anyway. Your mom won’t mind. I know her from town.”

Anna frowned. “What’s your name?”

“Tom,” he said easily. “Tom Begay. Everyone around here knows me.”

That name—it sounded familiar, but I couldn’t place it. Maybe Mom had mentioned it once. Maybe he’d done work for someone we knew.

Anna hesitated, glancing down the empty road. No other cars, no houses in sight. Just open land and the faint shimmer of heat.

“It’s hot,” I muttered. “It’s not far, but…”

She bit her lip. Then, with a sigh that sounded older than eleven, she nodded. “Okay. But only because it’s too hot to walk.”

We climbed in the back—Anna first, then me. The door shut with a heavy thud. Inside smelled of old cigarettes, gasoline, and something sharp and metallic I couldn’t name.

At first, everything seemed fine. The van hummed forward, tires crunching on gravel. Then he passed our turn.

“Uh, that’s our road back there,” Anna said, sitting up straighter.

The man chuckled softly. “Shortcut,” he said. “Faster this way.”

But the “shortcut” led us deeper into nowhere. The dirt road narrowed to two ruts winding through open scrubland. No fences. No signs. Just the endless horizon.

My stomach tightened. “Where are we going?” I asked.

“Just a bit further,” he said, voice still calm but different now—flat, distant.

Anna grabbed my hand. “Turn around. Take us home,” she said, her voice shaking.

He didn’t answer. The van bounced harder over the ruts, dust billowing behind.

“Please,” I said, louder this time.

That’s when his tone changed completely. “Quiet.” The word cracked like a whip.

Fear hit me like a wave. I looked at Anna. Her face had gone pale.

“We have to get out,” she whispered, her breath trembling. “When he stops.”

But he didn’t stop. He kept driving, faster now, deeper into the desert. The sun started lowering, long shadows crawling over the land.

After what felt like forever, he turned into a dry wash surrounded by low red hills. The van jerked to a stop. He cut the engine.

“Out,” he said.

Anna moved first. The second the door opened, she bolted, shouting, “Run!”

I followed, heart hammering. Sand sprayed under my shoes as we sprinted.

“Get back here!” he yelled, feet pounding behind us.

I heard Anna ahead, her voice desperate. “Come on, Ian! Faster!”

He caught my arm, fingers digging in like claws. I screamed, twisting. “Let go!”

Anna turned, grabbed a rock, and hurled it at him. It hit his shoulder with a dull thud.

“You little brat!” he shouted, yanking me closer.

Anna rushed him, kicking, clawing. “Leave him alone!”

He shoved her hard. She fell, scraping her knee, blood spotting the dirt. Something inside me snapped. I bit his hand as hard as I could.

He cursed and loosened his grip. I tore free, grabbed Anna’s arm, and we ran.

The world blurred—rocks, brush, wind. He was behind us, closer every second. I could hear his boots hitting the ground.

We dove behind a cluster of boulders, gasping, hearts racing.

“Shh,” Anna whispered. “Don’t move.”

We crouched low, listening. Footsteps stopped.

“Kids!” he called. His voice was sing-song now, mocking. “Anna. Ian. You can’t hide forever.”

How did he know our names? My blood turned cold.

Anna’s eyes widened. “He’s been watching us. He knows who we are.”

The man’s voice drifted closer. “You’re making this worse. Come out, and I won’t hurt you.”

We stayed silent. The desert held its breath with us.

Then—nothing. Just the wind.

Minutes passed. Maybe hours. When we dared peek, the van was still there. He sat inside it, waiting.

“He’s not leaving,” I whispered.

Anna stared toward the horizon, where the sun was beginning to dip. “We wait until dark. Then we move.”

When night finally came, the desert cooled fast. We crept from the rocks, sticking low, heading away from the van. The stars came out bright and sharp, like eyes watching from above.

Every sound—the crunch of dirt underfoot, the rustle of wind—made me flinch.

We walked for what felt like forever, directionless, thirsty, lost. Then, headlights in the distance.

“Hide!” Anna whispered, pulling me down behind a bush.

The lights slowed. A truck door opened.

“Anyone out here?” a man called.

Anna hesitated. Then she stood. “Help! Please, help!”

The flashlight beam found us. Two tribal police officers ran over, concern all over their faces.

“What happened?” one asked.

Anna broke down crying, words spilling out between sobs—“the man, the van, the shortcut.”

They gave us water, wrapped us in blankets, and radioed it in.

When Mom arrived at the station that night, she grabbed us and didn’t let go. I could feel her heart pounding through her shirt.

They caught him later—the van stuck in soft sand a few miles from where he’d chased us. His real name wasn’t Tom Begay. He’d been using that name for years.

The police said he’d tried this before—with other kids who never made it home.

For weeks, I couldn’t sleep. I’d wake to every sound outside—the creak of the windmill, coyotes calling far off—and swear I could still hear the crunch of tires on dirt, that red van creeping slow down the road.

Mom said he was locked up now, that it was over.

But some nights, when the wind moves just right through the dry washes, I still think I hear his voice calling from the dark.

And I wonder how many others never got the chance to run.





# ""The Long Ride"":

I left the rodeo grounds angry, my husband’s words still ringing in my ears. The lights and laughter from the fairgrounds faded behind me as I walked toward the campground, boots crunching through the dust. The night air had cooled after a long day in the sun, but my face still burned from the argument. All I wanted was to get home to my baby girl — three months old, waiting with the sitter in Lebanon.

A man standing by his camper saw me scanning the lot. He had a cigarette in hand, the ember glowing red. “Need a ride?” he asked casually, nodding toward a line of trucks parked under the dim lights.

“Yeah,” I said, trying to sound more confident than I felt. “Heading west.”

He pointed toward a pickup near the edge. “That guy there’s going your way. He’s decent.”

The driver was a big man — broad shoulders, thick arms, a kind of quiet sturdiness that made him seem safe at first glance. His face was weathered, like someone used to hard work outdoors. “Hop in,” he said.

Another man was already in the passenger seat, so I climbed in between them, pressing my purse against my knees. The cab smelled faintly of motor oil and pine cleaner. The dashboard light flickered as the truck rumbled to life.

We pulled out onto Highway 20, the long dark road slicing through Oregon’s high desert. The world outside was nothing but endless black, broken only by patches of sagebrush glowing silver in the headlights. No houses. No cars. Just space — miles of it.

The passenger talked for a bit about the rodeo bulls, about the heat and dust. His voice was easy, almost friendly. But after ten minutes or so, he asked to get out at a side road. “Appreciate the lift,” he said, hopping down into the night.

And then there were two.

The cab felt smaller instantly. I shifted toward the door, trying to make room, but that’s when I noticed the rifle racked behind us — a long-barreled gun with a worn strap. A hunting knife sat in a coffee can beside his seat, the blade dull with use.

“You hunt?” I asked, forcing my voice light.

“Yeah,” he said after a pause. “Plenty of space out here for that.”

He said it like the desert was his.

We rode in silence for a long time. The hum of the tires became hypnotic, and exhaustion from the day crept over me. My eyelids grew heavy.

When I woke, the road wasn’t paved anymore. The truck was bumping hard over rocks and gravel, headlights cutting through thin trees and dry brush. My heart started pounding before my brain could catch up.

“Where are we?” I asked, sitting upright.

He didn’t look over. “Shortcut.”

“This doesn’t look like a shortcut,” I said, glancing at the window. Only blackness beyond it. My hand went to the door handle — but there wasn’t one. Just an empty hole where it should’ve been.

“Stop the truck,” I said.

He didn’t.

The path grew narrower, the trees closing in. Branches scraped the sides, and the desert ground looked angry — dry, cracked, refusing to soften even in shadow. My stomach dropped. “Turn around. I said stop.”

The truck jolted to a halt. For a second, everything was still except the soft tick of the cooling engine.

Then he turned to me. His face had changed — blank, flat, something colder in his eyes. “Get out,” he said.

“What?”

“Out.”

I reached for my bag, but before I could, he yanked the passenger door open from his side and grabbed my arm, pulling me across the seat. His grip was hard, rough.

“Please—” I started, but he dragged me into the dirt, the night air biting against my skin.

“Where are we going?”

“You’ll see.”

He pushed me toward the back of the truck, his other hand now holding the knife. The moonlight flashed along its edge. “You talk too much,” he said, pressing the blade against my throat.

“Please, I have a baby at home,” I begged. “Let me go. I won’t say anything.”

He smiled, but there was no humor in it. “You think anyone’s gonna find you out here?”

The desert swallowed his words.

He shoved me down hard, the ground tearing at my clothes, small stones grinding into my back. The smell of dust and oil filled my nose. I felt the cold kiss of the knife at my collarbone as his free hand ripped at my jeans. The sound of the fabric tearing echoed through the trees, too loud, too real.

I kicked and clawed, but he was stronger. “Stop fighting,” he growled. “You’ll only make it worse.”

Somewhere close, a cricket chirped. A small, normal sound in a world that had suddenly become unrecognizable.

I stopped struggling, my thoughts spinning to my daughter — her tiny hands, her soft breaths. If I screamed, no one would hear. If I ran, he’d catch me.

When it was over, he stood up, breathing heavy, the knife still in his hand. He looked around like he was deciding what to do next.

“Are you gonna kill me?” I asked quietly.

He didn’t answer right away. Then, “Depends if you make trouble.”

I sat up slowly, holding what was left of my clothes. “Please,” I said again, voice shaking. “Just take me home. I swear I won’t tell anyone.”

He studied me a moment longer, then nodded toward the truck. “Find some pants in the back.”

I stumbled to the tailgate, grabbing a pair of old work pants and pulling them on. My legs were trembling so bad I could barely stand.

We drove back the way we’d come. The dirt road seemed longer now, twisting endlessly before meeting the highway again. Neither of us spoke. The only sound was the rattle of the truck and my heart in my ears.

After a while, he pulled off near a small house — one dim porch light burning. “Stay here,” he said, stepping out.

The truck idled as I sat there frozen, staring into the dark. Should I run? My hand pressed the door — but still no handle. Just that gaping hole. The desert stretched out around me, vast and empty. I’d never make it far.

He came back with two sodas, handed me one. “Drink,” he said.

I did, the carbonation burning my dry throat. I needed to stay calm. Needed something — a name, a clue, anything.

“If I ever need a ride again,” I said, forcing a smile, “what’s your number?”

He smirked, eyes glinting. “Why? You want more?”

“Maybe.”

He told me. I repeated it under my breath, burning it into memory.

The rest of the ride was quiet. The sky was starting to pale at the edges when the first lights of Lebanon appeared. My relief almost made me dizzy.

He stopped in front of my mother-in-law’s house. “Out,” he said.

I bolted, bare feet hitting the gravel, pounding on the front door. She opened it, her face freezing at the sight of me — hair tangled, clothes torn, blood drying on my neck.

“Dear God,” she whispered. “What happened?”

“Call the police,” I gasped. “Now.”

The officers came. I told them everything — the rodeo, the truck, the turnoff, the missing handle, the knife. They took the jeans, the scraps of fabric, my statement. At the hospital, a nurse swabbed the cuts on my legs, murmuring softly as I tried not to cry.

But days later, a detective called me back. His tone was careful, too careful. “He says it was consensual,” he told me. “His story’s different.”

“He’s lying,” I said.

“His friend and his mother back him up. They say you were upset and asked him for a ride.”

My stomach turned cold. “You’re letting him go?”

“There’s not enough evidence,” he said.

That night, I sat by my baby’s crib, watching her breathe, and wondered if I’d just looked into the eyes of a man who would kill someone next.

Years passed, but I never forgot that ride. I avoided Highway 20 whenever I could. Every time I heard of a woman gone missing along that stretch — a jogger, a teenager, a hitchhiker — my chest tightened. The details always sounded too familiar.

Then one day, I saw his face on the news. Arrested for murder. They’d found bodies buried off the back roads — places I’d seen through that windshield. Places I’d thought I’d never survive.

When I testified, he looked at me once — that same blank, cold stare. No apology. No recognition. Just emptiness.

He died in prison years later, but sometimes, when I drive through the desert, I still glance at every turnoff, every dirt road cutting into the trees. The silence out there feels different now — heavier, like the land remembers what it’s seen.

The highway looks the same, but I know better.  
Some roads don’t forget.





# ""The Amboy"":

I had just finished a long weekend in California with my friend David, and we were finally heading back to New Mexico. We decided to take a two-lane shortcut through the high desert — a thin, sun-bleached ribbon of asphalt cutting straight through nowhere. It promised fewer cars and a faster trip, but mostly, it promised quiet.

The late afternoon light had turned golden, painting the sand and distant hills in long shadows. Heat shimmered off the road ahead, warping the horizon. David sat in the passenger seat, twisting the radio dial, searching for a station that wasn’t all static.

“This signal’s terrible out here,” he muttered. “How far till we hit the interstate?”

I glanced down at the map spread across my lap. “About another hour. We should pass through Amboy soon — old ghost-town kind of place. Not much there, but at least it breaks up the drive.”

He nodded, leaning back. “Fine by me. Beats fighting traffic on I-40. Just us and the road.”

For a while, it was peaceful. The hum of the engine, the soft hiss of wind through the cracked window, the emptiness all around us. The desert stretched endlessly — miles of pale dirt and stubborn brush, broken only by the occasional dry creek bed or rusted road sign that had lost its letters decades ago.

Then, about twenty minutes later, something appeared on the horizon. A red car, parked sideways across both lanes.

“Look at that,” I said, easing off the gas. “Breakdown, maybe?”

David sat forward, squinting. “Could be. Or a wreck. But… I don’t see anyone.”

As we drew closer, details sharpened — an older sedan, doors closed, a suitcase lying open in the road. Clothes scattered across the pavement, fluttering slightly in the dry wind. Then I saw them: two figures lying face down next to the car. A man and a woman, motionless.

“Are those people?” David asked. “They look hurt.”

I slowed to a crawl. Something about it felt wrong. There were no skid marks, no broken glass, no sign of impact. The figures lay too neatly, like they’d been *placed* there.

“Hold on,” I said quietly. “Something’s off.”

David frowned. “We can’t just drive by if they’re hurt.”

I scanned the roadside — nothing but tall, brittle grass and open desert. No houses. No other cars. “Maybe,” I said, “but why are they both down like that? Same position, arms by their sides… it doesn’t look natural.”

He pulled out his phone, checking the screen. “No service. Of course. What do we do?”

I felt my pulse quicken. The quiet suddenly felt heavy — too still, like the desert was holding its breath. “Let’s get closer,” I said, “but I’m not stopping yet. If something’s wrong, we’ll keep going.”

We rolled forward slowly. The air inside the car seemed to tighten. As we crept past, I saw the suitcase again — its contents looked *arranged*, not scattered. The shirt sleeves were folded too neatly, the shoes placed side by side. My stomach turned.

“This isn’t right,” I said. “It looks staged.”

David shot me a glance. “Staged for what?”

I didn’t answer. My eyes flicked to the side of the road — there was just enough dirt shoulder to squeeze past the red car if I hugged the edge carefully.

“Let’s go around,” I said. “Don’t stop.”

He nodded, tense now. “Do it.”

The tires crunched over gravel as we pulled onto the shoulder. I could see the figures clearly now — the man’s shirt wrinkled, the woman’s hair spread out across the asphalt. Neither of them moved. Not an inch.

I kept my foot ready on the gas. We passed the back of the red car, and just as I exhaled, thinking we were clear, I glanced in the rearview mirror.

The bodies were *moving*.

The man pushed up onto his knees first, then the woman. My chest seized. “David—look!”

He twisted around. “They’re standing up. What the hell—”

Before I could respond, the grass on both sides of the road began to move. Figures rose up — ten, maybe fifteen of them — men and women, dressed in dusty clothes that blended into the desert. They stepped out silently, like they’d been waiting.

One man in front lifted his arm and pointed straight at us.

“Go!” David shouted.

I slammed the accelerator. The engine screamed, tires spinning on dirt before gripping asphalt again. The car lurched forward, fishtailing slightly before straightening out. In the mirror, I saw them running toward the red car, waving their arms, shouting something I couldn’t hear.

“What the hell was that?” David said, breathing fast. “They were *hiding*! They were waiting for us!”

“An ambush,” I said, my throat dry. “Fake an accident, make people stop.”

He swallowed hard. “And then what? Take the car? Or worse?”

Neither of us said another word. The only sound was the roar of the engine and the rattle of loose gravel as we sped toward the horizon. Every shadow on the roadside made my hands tighten on the wheel. Every flicker of light behind us looked like movement.

After what felt like forever, a small gas station appeared — a squat building with one flickering light and a single pump. I pulled in hard, tires squealing.

An older man stepped out, wiping his hands on a rag. “You folks alright?” he asked, squinting at our faces. “You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

David got out first. “We just passed something—people lying in the road. A car blocking both lanes. Then more people came out of the grass. Like they were waiting.”

The man’s expression darkened. “Heard of that before,” he said quietly. “Groups out there’ll do that. Stage wrecks, lure drivers to stop. You’re lucky you didn’t.”

I felt a chill. “That happen often?”

“More than you’d think,” he said. “Empty stretches like this, no one to hear you scream. Some folks disappear out here. You keep to the main roads, understand?”

David nodded quickly. “Yeah. We’re heading straight for the interstate.”

“Smart,” the man said. “Sheriff’s station’s forty miles east if you wanna report it. But truth is, those people move around. Hard to catch.”

We thanked him and got back in the car. The sun was setting now, the sky bruised orange and purple, the desert fading into darkness. We didn’t speak until we hit the interstate, headlights from other cars finally appearing around us — civilization, safety.

David finally broke the silence. “Promise me we’ll never take a shortcut again.”

“Never,” I said. “Next time, we stick to the main roads.”

Even now, I think about that red car in the road — about how carefully everything was arranged. The still bodies, the waiting faces in the grass. Someone else might have stopped. Maybe they already had.  
The desert keeps its secrets well.

But we were lucky.  
And we didn’t look back.





# ""No Bars, No Exit"":

The highway stretched endlessly through the New Mexico desert, a flat ribbon of cracked asphalt cutting through nothing but sand, scrub, and the fading line of mountains. I’d been driving for hours, chasing the orange edge of twilight that had long since melted into night. The radio was static, the stars bright and cold. Then, without warning, my old pickup started to sputter.

At first, I thought it was just the wind playing tricks—but then the engine coughed twice and died. The dashboard lights dimmed, and silence settled in so thick it pressed against my ears. I coasted to the shoulder and sat there for a moment, staring at the empty road ahead. No lights. No signs. Just desert.

I popped the hood, pretending I knew what I was looking for. The metal was still hot under my hands, the smell of oil and dust rising into the cool air. I had no clue what was wrong, and when I checked my phone, there were no bars—just a blank screen mocking me. So I did the only thing I could: I waited.

About twenty minutes later, headlights appeared on the horizon. My heart jumped. The beams grew brighter until they washed over me—a white van slowing to a stop behind my truck. The driver’s door opened, and a man stepped out. He looked to be in his fifties, rugged and ordinary, wearing a flannel shirt and jeans. A woman followed, maybe mid-thirties, her hair tied back, her smile faint and polite.

“Having some trouble?” the man asked, voice calm, almost kind.

“Yeah,” I said, brushing my hands on my jeans. “It just died on me. Think it might be the battery or something.”

The woman smiled, that same polite curve. “We’re headed toward town. You can ride with us if you want. I’m Lisa. This is my husband, John.”

I hesitated, glancing down the empty road. The night air was cooling fast, and there hadn’t been another car in what felt like an hour. My options were thin.

“Okay,” I said finally. “Thanks. I’m Emily.”

Inside the van, the air smelled faintly of dust and gasoline. A small cooler sat between the seats. John talked while he drove, easy conversation—something about working for the parks department, knowing these roads better than anyone. Lisa offered me a bottle of water from the cooler. Her hand was steady, her eyes unreadable.

I took a sip.

That’s the last clear thing I remember.

When I woke, my head throbbed. My mouth tasted like metal. Everything was dark except for a single bulb overhead, its weak light swaying. My arms were pulled tight above me—chained to something cold and metal. My legs were strapped down. It took me a moment to realize I was naked.

Panic tore through me.

“Hello?” I shouted. “What’s going on?”

A door creaked open. Harsh light flooded in. John stepped through, holding a small tape recorder. Behind him stood Lisa, arms crossed, eyes hollow.

“You’re awake,” he said, almost conversationally. He pressed play.

A crackle of static, then his own recorded voice filled the room. “Welcome to my playroom. You’re here because I chose you. I’ll do what I want with you. Maybe you’ll go free. Maybe you won’t. Scream all you want—no one will hear.”

I pulled at the chains until they cut into my wrists. “Please,” I begged. “I won’t tell anyone. Just let me go.”

John smiled, soft and patient. “They all say that.”

He picked up a long metal rod with wires attached. “Lisa, get the generator.”

She nodded, flipping switches on a box in the corner. A low hum filled the air.

“Why are you doing this?” I asked, my voice breaking. “What did I do?”

Lisa didn’t look at me. “You were alone. That’s all it takes.”

John pressed the clips to my skin. “This is going to hurt.”

The current hit like a knife made of fire. My body convulsed, breath catching in my throat. I tried to bite back the sound, but the scream ripped out anyway. They watched—impassive, methodical—as he turned the dial again.

Time lost meaning after that. They left me in darkness for hours, sometimes returning to start again. John liked to talk while he worked—about the others, about how the desert swallowed everything. Lisa joined in sometimes, her hands trembling only slightly as she cut, as she burned, as she whispered that I’d get used to it.

Once, John sat beside me and said, almost tenderly, “I have a daughter, you know. She’s learning. But Lisa—Lisa’s my favorite. She understands.”

Lisa looked at me then, her voice calm. “He saved me once. This is how I repay him.”

Days—or what felt like days—blurred into one long nightmare. They fed me just enough to keep me alive. My voice went hoarse from crying out. My wrists were raw from the chains.

Then one morning, John grabbed his keys. “Got work today. Keep an eye on her.” He kissed Lisa before leaving, like it was any normal day.

Lisa sat in the corner flipping through a magazine, humming faintly. The keys to my restraints lay on the table beside her. I stared at them, barely breathing.

“Lisa,” I whispered. “Water. Please.”

She sighed and stood, grabbing a cup. As she leaned over, I jerked forward, smashing my head into her face. She yelped, stumbling back. The cup shattered. I reached for the keys, stretching my fingers until they brushed metal.

“You little—” she snarled, grabbing a lamp and swinging. The blow caught my shoulder, sending a flash of white through my vision. But I’d already turned the first key—one wrist free.

I swung wildly, catching her jaw with my fist. She fell, dazed. I fumbled with the other locks, each one clicking open like salvation.

Lisa lunged again, an ice pick in her hand. “You’re not leaving!” she screamed.

I caught her wrist, twisting until I felt the weapon drop. Then I grabbed it and drove it into her shoulder. She shrieked, collapsing.

I ran.

The trailer door burst open, sunlight blinding me. The desert spread out in every direction—empty, endless, brutal. Chains still dangled from my wrists as I stumbled across the hot ground, my feet tearing on rocks and thorns.

Behind me, Lisa’s voice rose, faint but furious. “John! She’s getting away!”

I didn’t stop. I ran until my lungs burned, until my vision swam. Then, far ahead, a small shape appeared—a mobile home, perched on a rise of dirt.

I banged on the door, screaming for help.

An older woman answered, eyes wide. “Oh my God,” she whispered. “What happened to you?”

“Please,” I gasped. “They took me—call the police.”

She pulled me inside, locked the door, and dialed 911 with shaking hands. “There’s a girl here—she’s hurt bad. Please hurry.”

Sirens came not long after. They took me to a hospital, cut off the chains, patched the burns and cuts. I gave them everything—names, details, the road, the van.

That night, police raided the trailer. They found the tools, the blood, the tapes. John and Lisa were arrested before sunset. He confessed to five abductions. They think there were more.

At the trial, I sat across from them and told my story. When I said, *“You thought the desert would hide you,”* John only smiled. Lisa stared at the floor.

Now, sometimes, when I drive at night, I still glance at the horizon and see that stretch of highway—the place where the lights first appeared. I drive faster now. I keep the doors locked. And I always, always check my mirrors twice.",1,1761012089.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

I've been noticing that my cat has been itching his ears constantly and he has that coffee-ground looking wax, but I can't really tell from the research I've been doing online whether they're ear mites or I'm just crazy -- I haven't contacted the vet yet but that's only because cat ear wax and cat ear mites look so similar and I'm not even completely sure he has ear mites.

I found my cat when he was two months old and he was living on the street; at that time I had brought him to the vet and they said he had ear mites but that was the only thing wrong with him. He's been itching his ears a lot recently (noticeably his right ear, but I think it's been both too), and he's lost some coordination I think -- he's been falling off the counter, off tables, etc. when he normally wouldn't before. I can't tell if the coordination thing is connected to the ears, or if it's just because he's just a kitten and isn't aware of his surroundings and happens to fall off. (and sometimes he falls because his paws are wet and he tries to jump on slippery surfaces like the closed toilet seat or the marble countertop).

I'm trying to get a picture but it's hard - he doesn't want anyone touching his face or ears, even when he's calm (right now he's overstimulated I think, so I'm giving him time to chill out) I will update when I get a good one!

(also p.s. financially I am good - I just got pet insurance for him since he's gonna get neutered soon and I need to order more Nexguard flea & tick prevention thingy)",1,1761011997.0,AskVet,2,1.0,False

I work from home. Like many, I started working from home during COVID and was never required to go to the office.

My wife, Ashley, recently switched jobs, and her new company requires her to be in the office three days a week, usually Tuesday-Thursday.

I was happy for her. I’m a hardcore introvert, but she needs time with other people. Plus, it’s nice having something to talk about over the dinner table. After eight years of marriage and five years of working from home, it’s hard to think of something new to say when you spend all day together. 

The first week was rocky. Funny enough, we had to get used to commuting again. After a few trips, we settled into a new routine: I drop her off at the 7:45 commuter station near our house, grab a cold brew on my way back, and hop online around 8:45.

It was all peachy for the first few weeks. But then the messages started.

It was a classic fall morning in New England. The air was crisp; the sun was warm, and I looked forward to an afternoon walk after work. I dropped Ashley off at the train station near our house, grabbed my cold brew on my way back, and hopped up the porch steps to settle into my morning routine.

As I entered the house, I saw our thermostat flashing a warning that it had disconnected from the Wi-Fi.

*Odd*, I thought. Perhaps the power blinked while I was gone.

I walked down the hall to my home office, where the router is, and turned it off, then on again. As the router booted up, I checked the available Wi-Fi networks on my phone.

There was our usual Verizon network, and another:

“Hello. Is anyone there?”

I felt the hair on the back of my neck stand up as I looked around the empty room. 

I’m no stranger to “vanity” network names. In Boston, one of our neighbors had “ThirtyFlirtyThriving,” which we always got a kick out of. But we live far enough from our neighbors that I’ve never seen another Wi-Fi network show up. 

I looked down at my phone, and the network was gone. The rest of the day was uneventful: lots of meetings, a lunchtime walk down to the center of town, and I picked Ashley up at the train around 5:30. 

By the time we settled into bed, I’d almost forgotten about the incident earlier.

Wednesday began the same way: I dropped her off at 7:30, grabbed my cold brew on the way home, and admired the crisp fall air as I stepped out of the car. As I was about to reach for the door handle, I hesitated a bit — what if the Wi-Fi was out again?

I stamped the thought down, but sure enough, the thermostat in the entryway flashed the “Wi-Fi Disconnected” warning.

I hurried down the hall to the router, turned it off and back on again, and checked the networks on my phone. 

There was a new message: “Alone again today, Tyler?”

My phone thudded to the floor as it fell out of my hand. I ran to the window, frantically checking for vans, people, anything. I saw nothing. No neighbors. No kids waiting for the bus. No cars passing by. Just the warm autumn sun shining on the orange and red blanket of leaves on our lawn. 

I didn’t leave the house again until I had to pick Ashley up from the train at 5:30 that evening. 

“Anything exciting happen today?” She asked me, leaning in for a kiss as she got into the car. Then she noticed my grim expression. “What’s wrong?” 

“Ashley, I think someone is messing with me through the Wi-Fi network.”

She listened patiently as I explained what had happened the day before and the message that morning. 

“So, do you think it’s a joke or…” she trailed off, as we both wished not to name the more nefarious possibilities.

“I don’t know.” I said, “All I know is that for two days in a row there has been a new network with some sort of message, and the one today was directed at me.”

We ate dinner in silence, read for a bit, and fell into a dreamless sleep. If you can believe it, the next day is when things got weird. 

That morning, I checked the Wi-Fi networks before dropping her off at the train. Nothing. Then, as I drove her to the station, I took care to keep my eyes open for anything suspicious around the house or on our drive. 

“Looking for your stalker?”

Was that a hint of nervousness I detected underneath her attempt at humor?

“Yeah.” I glanced from side to side as I pulled down our street.

“Well,” she said as we continued down the road, “I didn’t see anything suspicious. Maybe things’ll be alright today?”

Oh, how I wished she were right. 

I skipped the coffee that morning and drove straight home. As I parked in the driveway, I thought that rather than going directly into the house, I’d scope things out a bit. Since the network disappeared a few minutes after I saw it, surely the person must be nearby, right?

I looked around back, in the neighbors’ yards, and up and down the street. Nothing. Again, there was nothing. It was just another crisp fall morning. 

And that damn Wi-Fi was out again. 

I sprinted down the hall and ripped the router’s cord out of the wall, drew the blinds down, and shut my office door. I don’t know how much time had passed; maybe it was 30 seconds or 30 minutes. Whatever it was, a new network was waiting for me when I finally reconnected to the Wi-Fi.

“You didn’t see me, but I saw you :)”

I ran through the house and double-checked that the doors were locked, and barricaded myself in my home office for the rest of the day until I had to pick Ashley up. 

She saw the frightened look in my eyes the moment she got in the car. 

“Again?” she asked. “Did you call the cops?”

“And say what? That someone is sending messages through the internet, but I don’t know where from?”

“Wait for it to happen again and call them tomorrow. I’ll be there too to back your story up.”

We ate in silence and shut out the lights early, but I couldn’t sleep that night.

Every creak jolted me awake as I wondered where these messages were coming from… and if there was someone in our house watching us. They know my name. They know our routines. They know that I went and looked around before going in.

Usually on Fridays, I’ll do something nice like grab breakfast for both of us (bacon, egg, and cheese for me, a bagel with lox for Ashley), but this Friday, we sat quietly over our cups of coffee and waited. 

7:30 came and went. 8am came and went. 9am came and went. Nothing.

“What gives? I thought you said that the WiFi was out by the time you got home. I would’ve been at the office, but now nothing has happened.”

I was as dumbfounded as she was. 

By the end of the day on Friday, nothing strange had happened. The same went for Saturday and Sunday.

Ashley worked from home today, but will be back in the office tomorrow. I have a sick feeling that the messages will start up again tomorrow when she heads back into the office. ",6,1761011950.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Context: 

Me: 35M

Her: 33F, BP1 since she was 13

We met on Tinder in March, after she got out of her previous relationship. At first, she said she wasn’t ready for a relationship. But we kept talking, and after 2-3 months, she said she feels better and is ready again. I asked her out and we went really intense really fast. We were only together for 4 months but in that short amount of time, we did so much. We went on trips together, she met my family, I met her daughter, we started talking about marriage, I got a ring, etc 

She broke up with me a month ago.

She said she was feeling trapped in the relationship and needed to get out. She “needs to be single” for a while now, to figure herself out. She was very aware of that trapped, suffocating feeling that she needs to change her life or else she feels like “she’s going to die”. We tried working on it, but she ultimately broke up with me a month ago. 

After a text that I now regret sending, she and I met up for coffee last Friday and she basically just doubled down. She said she’s really happy being single right now. She recognizes I’m a good person, but she’s now convinced we’re not the right people for each other. She said she feels like she made a mistake getting with me at all, because she was too fresh out of her previous relationship. How am I supposed to know what’s the truth, and what’s just something she’s telling herself in an episode?

She says she really needs to be single right now to “work on herself”. She’s wanting to work on her art, her new social media page, she just got a new car and she’s wanting to like deck out the inside of it. She’s also just always used this lowkey self-deprecating language about herself (glorifying being a “trashy girl”, worrying that everyone’s going to hate her, etc. ). She has a long long long history of trauma that she’s never really addressed. 

She needs to focus on getting better, not her art projects. She needs to be in therapy, she needs to be consistent with her meds, she needs to mitigate her triggers. I love her. I have so much love for her. I want her well. She has no one in her life that’s like, holding her accountable. She has plenty of friends but none of them are, like, checking in on her and rooting for her to get well. She lives at home but her mom isn’t really, like, involved with her treatments. I feel like I was the first one in a long time to really like, show active care for her treatment. I would check in and see if she had taken her meds, I would check in and see if she was due for a refill of any meds, I would even offer to pay for refills if her finances were running low, etc. 

I just can’t stop worrying about her. I can’t stop catastrophizing what her journey looks like: bad decisions, getting in trouble, falling down a spiral. I need to know she’s going to be okay. My anxiety about her wellbeing is making me wish I could just insert myself into her life and make sure she does everything she needs to, to be well. 

To be fair, I don’t *know* that she’s not taking her self-care seriously. She very well could be but we’re in No Contact so there’s no way for me to know. She did pick vaping back up, once we broke up, after successfully quitting for 2 months while we were together. 

I don’t even want her back. I mean, I do, but not like this. I want her to be happy. I want her to be well. If, at one point in the future, she takes accountability and responsibility for her choices and chooses active self-care (consistent with her meds, consistent in therapy, mitigation of her triggers like vaping and weed), then we can talk. I don’t want her back if she can’t choose her own wellbeing before choosing me. 

But that doesn’t mean it’s easy for me not to worry about her. ",0,1761011814.0,family_of_bipolar,0,0.33,False

1oc0hyq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1oc0hyq/my_ex_boyfriend_lied_to_me_for_our_whole/,My Ex Boyfriend lied to me for our whole relationship,"Hi, reddit. For the last four months I (F23) have been in a relationship with an old friend (M24) from my high school (we’re 5 years post grad) who I reconnected with earlier this year. We’ll call him Ross. 

For context: my previous relationship was with Ross’s best friend, Gunther, and after we broke up I thought that I would have lost all contact with Ross. 

But when he decided to hit me up in May of this year after our paths kept crossing, we went out a couple of times and seemed to hit it off. After our first official date, Ross told me he loved me and asked if I would be his girlfriend. 
I told him “you mean you love me as a friend, and that love could someday blossom into romantic love, right?” To which he said “No, I’ve felt this for a while and I really love you.” 

Although this was a bit of a red flag, I thought he was being a genuine person and this was his first time ever asking someone out as I was his first girlfriend. Plus, everything else about his personality screamed “ready to commit,” so I let it slide. He even went on to tell me some bullshit story about how he actually liked me before Gunther and I started going out but he just missed his shot back then. 

For three months he showered me in affection until I started school (i’m in a STEM program) and our schedules changed. He grew distant, I got busy- I expected it but I also made sure to keep in touch and check in as much as I could. 

At least once every three weeks throughout our entire relationship I would check in and ask how Ross felt; if he was anxious or unsure about anything. Every single time I brought this up he had absolutely nothing to say. 

Cut to last Thursday: I was studying for one of my six midterms when Ross came to my house with a coffee from the cafe where we had our first non-official date and he broke up with me. Gave me the excuse that he couldn’t be in a relationship at this time and needed to focus on himself, but also made sure to mention that he “knows how seriously I take things like this” (our fucking relationship) and that it wouldn’t be fair to me if he stayed while not being fully into it. 
I just walked him out and told him “no hard feelings” but then it started to eat at me. This guy pursued ME, I was not looking for a relationship when we started hanging out because I knew I would be starting school soon. He said “i love you” after the first date. What was the real reason? 
Well, I still don’t know. 

But I did end up confronting him in a conversation that can be summarized with: 

- Ross never actually “loved” me but he thought that the doubts he had at the BEGINNING OF OUR RELATIONSHIP were just nerves 

- He asked me to be his girlfriend because he “wanted to be there for me” while I went through something huge like school. (Which he could have just done as a friend but whatever). 

- He genuinely does care about me (yeah fucking right) and he never meant to hurt me. 

All of this to say I obviously see the bullet I dodged here. I’m beyond thankful that someone like this, who can lie to someone to their face for months, is out of my life. 

But now there’s all this mental fallout I’m dealing with in the aftermath. I already have an appointment with a therapist set for sometime next week, I know this is gonna take time to work through. 

I just want to know if there’s anyone who’s ever been in a similar situation who has some nuggets of wisdom for me. It feels like I’ll never be able to trust someone again, and it KILLS me because before all of this bullshit I considered myself a romantic.  


p.s. Also I’ve already resolved to not get involved with anyone else while I’m in school. Obviously it comes first, and it’s not worth putting myself out there if the world is filled with sociopaths like my ex boyfriend.

1oc0fyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkGathering/comments/1oc0fyd/dog_eat_dog_chapter_1/,Dog Eat Dog [Chapter 1],"Two years after my first hunt, the night before the Harvest Moon, I was at the local tavern playing a game of liar’s dice against some other hunters, including Arthur. By the time midnight came around, it was just the two of us playing. He looked at me through a squinted eye. The other was covered by a black patch.



“Four sixes,” he said.



“Bullshit,” I remarked.



Begrudgingly, he lifted his cup, revealing a three, two fives, and two sixes. In the end, the pot was mine. I collected my winnings and redistributed them to the other players, buying another round of bitter beer that was brewed locally. For Arthur, I bought him a cup of peppermint tea.



It was around this time when we heard footsteps marching outside. People cheered as a group of hunters burst into the tavern, carrying a beast on their shoulders, riddled with arrows and bullets. Arthur leapt from his seat so fast that he almost knocked over his tea.



“Is it Baskerville?” he asked no one in particular.



“Calm down,” one of the hunters said. “It ain’t your precious Baskerville. We went and caught us the Banshee Beast. Bastard screamed until his last breath.”



Arthur relaxed and returned to his seat. Every hunter knew Baskerville was reserved for Arthur. An easy request considering a majority of hunters didn’t believe Baskerville was real. I knew Arthur to be an honest man, always. But even I had my doubts about Baskerville’s existence. In the last two years, I’d yet to see a beast that could move with the shadows.



The tavern owner doled out a round for the returning hunters, claiming he’d have their beast beheaded and taxidermied. He’d hang it up with the other beast heads mounted on the walls. There were almost too many of them to count, but I only ever noticed the one at the back of the room. Silvery fur, jagged teeth, marble red eyes. Arthur’s kill but my beast.



While I sat and bullshitted with Arthur, the hunters eventually scattered, finding seats across the bar. They were a rambunctious lot. Constantly chattering and laughing. Trading stories, taunts, or jabs, depending on what mood they were in. Successful hunts brought out the best in us.



Smoke wafted through the air from their pipes and hand-rolled cigarettes. The smell of yeast was potent. As well as the sweeter scents of red wine. Although previous experience had told me the wine was almost as bitter as the beer.



A group of people played live music on stage. Equipped with acoustic guitars and flutes and banjos and whatever else they’d manage to get their hands on. They were singing an old world song called “Randy Dandy Oh”. A naval shanty originally from the 1800s.



I was just about to start a game of poker with Arthur and the boys when the tavern doors flew open. Sofia Lopez, a local medic, came rushing in. She stopped at the entryway, scanned the crowd, and when she found me, she shouldered her way through the crowd.



“Trouble in paradise?” Arthur said slyly.



I kicked him under the table and tossed my cards back into the pile. Sofia was one of the few in town who avoided the tavern. Work at the physician’s office kept her too busy to celebrate like the rest of us.



“Last night’s hunters returned,” she said, panting.



“I’ve noticed,” I said. “What of it?”



“Nicolas’s platoon never came back.”



The Deadeye Hunter was overdue. Which either meant his crew got tied up during their hunt, or…



“They’re prob’ly just runnin’ behind,” I said.



Sofia shook her head. “Nicolas is never late.”



“What do you want me to do about it?” I glanced over at Arthur for support. He offered a haphazard shrug. “Maybe they got lost.”



She scoffed. “Nicolas has been a hunter longer than any of you. Do you really think he got lost?”



Sofia was in her early twenties. Lithe frame, silky black hair, darker skin. Bleeding heart, like my mother. But there was a hardness to her. One built from countless surgeries. Stitching hunters back together after long days battling beasts. I’d wager she’d seen more blood than the rest of us. More death too.



Two years ago, when she’d first arrived at our village, she was doe-eyed and quiet. People thought she was mute. Time and experience change you, though. I could attest to that.



I took a drink of beer and bit back the urge to grimace. “Look, you really want me to say it? If Nicolas or any of his crew haven’t come back yet, it means they’re prob’ly dead. If Nicolas is dead, then I assume he must’ve meant a monster of a beast out there. I pray to Solis that he was able to kill the beast before it finished him off.”



She cuffed me on the shoulder. “How can you act like you don’t give a shit? Nicolas was your friend. All of you. You’re just gonna consign him to death?”



“I’m not consigning him to shit,” I said, a growl in my throat. “Every hunter knows the risks. If they wanna take up arms against the beast, they’re doing so by their own consent. It was his choice to walk out of the village, and whether he comes back or not is up to him. There’s nothin’ I can do about it.”



Sofia leaned close. Her voice was low but firm. “Nicolas was there for you when Thomas died. He grieved your brother almost as much as you. He helped care for your mother, he looked after Jason whenever you were away on a hunt—”



I shoved away from the table and walked off. Sofia wasn’t going to give up that easily, though. She chased after me, a shadow at my heels.



“I don't know why you care so much,” I said over my shoulder. “It’s not like Nicolas was your friend.”



“Nick was a good man. He was a friend to everyone in the village. He looked after people—cared about them. And I want to know what happened to him out there,” she said. “What I don’t understand is how you can be so quick to give up on him.”



I stepped outside, and Sofia followed me. Some hunters and locals greeted me with waves and smiles. A few clapped me on the back as I started down the hillside toward the residential part of town.



“I’m not giving up on him,” I reassured her. “But you know the rules. We hunt. We kill the beasts. We don’t send out rescue teams. We don’t look for the dead.”



“What if he’s not dead?”



“Then he will be by morning. No one, not even Emilia the Ripper, could make it an entire night by herself.”



“Nicolas wasn’t alone.”



“Trust me, I know who he took with him on the hunt. Greybeards and new bloods. Hunters green as grass. Nicolas or not, they ain’t survivin’ the night either.”



Sofia shoved me. I stumbled forward a few paces and caught myself on the side of a building. Nearby, a mother and her child looked over at us. They quickly returned to their chores, knowing better than to get caught up in someone else’s drama.



“I see what people really mean to you,” Sofia remarked. “It’s so easy for you to just cut ‘em loose.”



“It’s easier to mourn a friend than hold out hope against the impossible. I liked Nicolas—he was practically a father to me after Thomas…” I sighed. “But going after him is a death wish. Especially if I go alone.”



“Then don’t go alone.”



I laughed. While Sofia had learned her way around the village, had become inured to some of our more harsh customs, she was still naive about the protocols hunters followed. Protocols first instituted by H.P. Corbet, our founding father. Those same protocols were still practiced under Sir Rafe’s administration. Whether we liked it or not.



Rules kept us civil. Kept us sane. Kept us alive.



“I’d have an easier time convincing hunters to butcher their own families than go out on a death wish,” I said. “Everyone liked Nicolas—they loved him. But I’m willin’ to wager not even a fourth of ‘em would go out lookin’ for him. Especially if they’re not being compensated for it, and we both know Sir Rafe wouldn’t authorize a search and rescue.”



“Doesn’t it concern you that there’s a beast out there that could kill Nicolas?”



“There’s a beast out there that could kill any of us. Never forget that.”



By then, Arthur had caught up to us. He soothed Sofia with half-hearted reassurances that Nicolas would return. “Just wait, you’ll see,” he said. He wrapped an arm around her shoulders and guided her back to the tavern. “Come now, I’ll buy you a drink. We can discuss it further.”



When they were out of sight, I turned for home. But I stopped short, staring at the dark little house at the end of the lane. The house that had once been full of laughter and songs.



Since the days of my father and Thomas, it’d become a hollow ruin just waiting to collapse. And it took everything I could do to keep it upright. That was my job. Not hunting beasts, not protecting the villagers, but keeping my family fed and safe.



But then, I had to wonder what Thomas would’ve done in my shoes. What my father might’ve done.



Instead of heading home, as I should have, I went to the north side where Sir Rafe’s estate resided. He lived in an old cathedral comprised of stone brick with tapered spires and arched windows of stained glass. The front doors were thick wood plated with strips of steel and bolts. A lantern hung from above, creaking in the wind, sending a flurry of shadows swirling at my feet.



I rapped my knuckles against the door and waited. A few moments later, I could hear footsteps from within. The front door opened. Emilia the Ripper greeted me. Blond hair, pale skin, face concealed beneath a hood. She was one of the few hunters who preferred the night.



“I need to speak with Sir Rafe,” I said.



“It’s late.” Her voice was low and gentle. A complete juxtaposition of her appearance. “He’s resting.”



“Then wake him. It’s urgent.”



Emilia studied me for a moment. We’d seen each other out on the field a handful of times, but other than those momentary encounters, we hardly ever interacted. I wouldn’t have been surprised if she slammed the door in my face, but instead, she stepped aside and gestured for me to enter.



The inside of Sir Rafe’s home was a stretch of velvet carpet over concrete floors. In the main hall, there were dozens of old pews where hunters would sit during our council meetings. Down another hallway was Sir Rafe’s personal chambers.



Half the room was a study. Furnished with a large wooden desk. The wall behind it was lined by shelves overflowing with dusty books. The other half, near the right side of the room, was outfitted with a pair of leather chairs sat before a fireplace.



When I entered, Sir Rafe sat in one of these chairs, bundled beneath several quilts and blankets. The hearth crackled and spat embers into the dark. The air stunk of vanilla intermingled with smoke. Both from the fireplace and from Sir Rafe’s pipe.



As I approached, Sir Rafe hummed a merry tune under his breath. A tune I didn’t recognize. He turned his head toward me. A smile pulled at his cracked lips, emphasizing the wrinkles of his face.



Long, wispy white hair cascaded around his shoulders. Grey hairs stippled his face. He was dressed in a dark button-up and smoking jacket with a scarf wrapped around his neck. His hands were covered by a pair of black fingerless gloves.



“Ah, if it isn’t Bernie the Bold,” he said. His words had an underlying croak to them. Old age combined with years of smoking had given him the voice of a toad.



Bernie the Bold was a nickname anointed by Sir Rafe himself. However, most of the others—villagers and hunters alike—preferred Bernadette the Barren. I didn’t care for either title, if I’m honest.



“I apologize, sir,” I said, bowing as was per custom. “I don’t mean to disturb your rest.”



He waved my concerns away and squawked with laughter. “It’s not often that I get a visitor so late. Come now, my child, take a seat. Let us converse in comfort. We can speak long into the night. Swapping stories and thoughts like classroom gossip.”



Suffice to say, Sir Rafe was a ‘peculiar’ man. Popular with the people for his whimsical nature. Babies and children didn’t care much for him, though. They found his withered visage slightly disquieting. They weren’t the only ones.



He sent Emilia away to fetch a kettle of hot water for coffee and tea. Before she could slip out, he asked her to grab a tray of cookies the school children had baked for him earlier that evening. 



My younger brother, Jason, had brought some of those cookies home with him. Hard as a brick, and while they were meant to resemble hunters, they looked more like charred men. I decided to make my visit brief to avoid having to endure any more of them.



“Sir, the reason I’m here is about Nicolas,” I began. “He went on a hunt earlier, and he hasn’t returned.”



Sir Rafe nodded ruefully and rubbed a hand over his stubbled cheeks. “Yes, I’ve heard. Tragic, tragic affair. I commend your concern, but alas, Nicolas and the others are lost to us now. We will hold a funeral for them and may Solis guide their souls to the Eternal Dream.”



“Sir, maybe we shouldn’t be so hasty about the matter. Nicolas is one of the best hunters we’ve got. If anyone could survive out there, it’s him.”



I knew the chances of survival were slim, but despite rationality, I had to feign optimism. If not for myself, then at the very least, for Sofia’s sake.



“Perhaps we could send out a search group,” I said. “If not to rescue them, then to confirm their deaths.”



He cocked an eyebrow. “Now, that is most curious. We’ve never sent out a search party before. Not even when H.P. Corbert didn’t return from his last hunt.”



“I know, sir, but—”



He laid a hand on mine, squeezing gently. “I understand. This is a hard thing to accept, but we must endure. That is the way of humanity.” He patted my hand before returning his to his lap. “Grieve for our fallen brothers and sisters, but don’t give your life for them. You have family and friends.”



“Nicolas has friends too,” I countered.



A pitiful smile appeared on his face. “Yes, I am aware. I was one of those friends. But right now, we don’t need to lose any more brothers or sisters. Not for Nicolas, not for me, not for anyone.”



It was then Emilia the Ripper returned with a tray of burned cookies and a kettle of hot water. She placed them on an endstand and poured two cups of coffee, adding a splash of pasteurized milk. She handed one cup to me and the other to Sir Rafe.



Despite the milk, the coffee was bitter. I choked it down, hoping to curry some favor from Sir Rafe. When he gestured to the cookies, insisting I have one, I forced one of those down as well, much to his delight.



“Please, Bernie,” he said, “do not wrack yourself with guilt over the demise of Nicolas. It can be hard, I know, but—”



He stopped speaking as Emilia leaned down and whispered in his ear. His lips pursed as she spoke, and his brow tightened. When Emilia was finished, he thanked her and rubbed a hand up and down her forearm.



“Bernie,” Sir Rafe said, “are you serious about wanting to look for Nicolas?”



“Of course,” I said. “I wouldn’t have come if I weren’t.”



“While I can’t permit a search and rescue operation, I can offer you a chance to join Lady Emilia on tomorrow’s hunt. She’ll be treading the same ground as Nicolas.”



I frowned. “And what exactly was Nicolas hunting for?”



“A few dens in a city known as Cairnsmouth. About thirty miles from here.”



Thirty miles was a long way to go for a hunt. We usually patrolled the surrounding area unless we thought there were resources worth scavenging for beyond our set perimeter.



“Somethin’ special about these dens?” I asked. “Must be if you’re going so far for ‘em.”



Sir Rafe turned to Emilia. She said, “Nicolas was sent after Gévaudan.”



My cookie and coffee almost came back up. Gévaudan was reportedly the largest and most vicious beast we’d ever seen. Although no one had encountered him in over a year.



That was part of the reason Bram the Conductor had retired from hunting. He became a school teacher and preacher instead. I had to hear about some of his lectures from Jason, and furtively, I was glad to be out of school.



I accepted the offer and finished my coffee. When I was done, Sir Rafe prepared for bed. Emilia the Ripper escorted me outside.



“We leave tomorrow at noon,” she said. “Be at the armory by eleven o’clock.”



“How many hunters are we taking?” I asked.



“Enough.”



I sneered. “Was that how many Nicolas had taken too?”



Her gaze was cold, biting. Her voice even more so. “Nicolas and his team were sent out on reconnaissance. They weren’t supposed to engage the enemy.”



I’d never known Nicolas to disobey an order. Which meant the enemy had engaged him first. If he really was looking for Gévaudan, then the possibility of him being alive was next to naught.



“Starting tomorrow,” Emilia said, “keep your comments to yourself.”



“Starting tomorrow, right?” I asked. “Well, if that’s the case, you can’t make a cup of coffee for shit. Y’know that?”



She snorted. “I’m Emilia the Ripper, you twat. Not Emilia the Housemaid.” She started to close the door. “Tomorrow, eleven o’clock sharp, or we’re leaving you behind.”",1,1761011592.0,TheDarkGathering,0,1.0,False

# Axis Definition

* **X-Axis:** Emotional Spectrum → *Practical ⟶ Aspirational*
* **Y-Axis:** Creative Tone → *Humorous ⟶ Relatable ⟶ Mindful*

# Brand Placement Overview

**1. United Airlines “POV” Series**

* *Position:* Relatable × Practical
* *Why:* First-person micro-moments (“POV: knitting on a plane”) humanize air travel. Humor is subdued, emotion authentic.
* *Creative Signal:* Empathy as differentiation in an industry built on efficiency.

**2. Southwest Airlines “Getaways by Southwest”**

* *Position:* Humorous × Practical
* *Why:* Self-aware humor (“Good move. Those college kids were wild.”) turns flexibility into fun.
* *Creative Signal:* Flexibility reframed as emotional value, not policy detail.

**3. Airbnb “More Than an Airbnb”**

* *Position:* Aspirational × Relatable
* *Why:* Expands brand beyond stays into experiences; uses whimsical visuals and gentle storytelling.
* *Creative Signal:* Emotional curiosity (what else can I Airbnb?) replaces discount-driven conversion.

**4. Hyatt “World of Hyatt” / Inclusive Collection**

* *Position:* Mindful × Aspirational
* *Why:* Cinematic tone, warm light, and poetic VO (“time moves differently here”).
* *Creative Signal:* Luxury redefined as presence and time, not material comfort.

**5. Marriott (Bonvoy + Starbucks)**

* *Position:* Relatable × Aspirational
* *Why:* Uses shared rituals (coffee + travel) to humanize loyalty.
* *Creative Signal:* Partnership storytelling as lifestyle bridge.

**6. Ryanair — “Garden Chairs” + “Talking Plane”**

* *Position:* Humorous × Practical
* *Why:* Self-parody of budget perception; irony as brand truth.
* *Creative Signal:* Transparency-through-humor earns credibility.

# Cross-Brand Insight Summary

* **Macro Trend:** Emotional travel storytelling replaces price/offer-centric messaging.
* **Creative Evolution:** Airlines are shifting toward micro-emotions (relatability, humor, mindfulness) instead of macro-themes (speed, savings, scale).
* **Execution Shift:** From cinematic hero films → short-form, social-native POVs.

# Strategic Implication for 2026

* **Emerging White Space:** Underused emotional angles — *relief, anticipation, belonging.*
* **Opportunity:** Combine humor (Southwest/Ryanair) with emotional honesty (United/Hyatt) to build new “everyday luxury” narratives.
* **Next Creative Test Idea:**
   * *Hypothesis:* Travelers engage longer with micro-emotional realism (e.g., delayed flight laughter, first-coffee-at-lobby calm).
   * *Execution:* 7s social cutdowns, UGC aesthetic, minimal logo presence.
   * *Primary Metric:* Thumb-stop rate + 3-sec view-through.

Key Takeaway: The new travel playbook isn’t about selling the destination — it’s about *selling the moment you didn’t know you’d feel.*

While I sat and bullshitted with Arthur, the hunters eventually scattered, finding seats across the bar. They were a rambunctious lot. Constantly chattering and laughing. Trading stories, taunts, or jabs, depending on what mood they were in. Successful hunts brought out the best in us.

Smoke wafted through the air from their pipes and hand-rolled cigarettes. The smell of yeast was potent. As well as the sweeter scents of red wine. Although previous experience had told me the wine was almost as bitter as the beer.

A group of people played live music on stage. Equipped with acoustic guitars and flutes and banjos and whatever else they’d manage to get their hands on. They were singing an old world song called “Randy Dandy Oh”. A naval shanty originally from the 1800s.

I was just about to start a game of poker with Arthur and the boys when the tavern doors flew open. Sofia Lopez, a local medic, came rushing in. She stopped at the entryway, scanned the crowd, and when she found me, she shouldered her way through the crowd.

“Trouble in paradise?” Arthur said slyly.

I kicked him under the table and tossed my cards back into the pile. Sofia was one of the few in town who avoided the tavern. Work at the physician’s office kept her too busy to celebrate like the rest of us.



“Last night’s hunters returned,” she said, panting.



“I’ve noticed,” I said. “What of it?”



“Nicolas’s platoon never came back.”



The Deadeye Hunter was overdue. Which either meant his crew got tied up during their hunt, or…



“They’re prob’ly just runnin’ behind,” I said.



Sofia shook her head. “Nicolas is never late.”



“What do you want me to do about it?” I glanced over at Arthur for support. He offered a haphazard shrug. “Maybe they got lost.”



She scoffed. “Nicolas has been a hunter longer than any of you. Do you really think he got lost?”



Sofia was in her early twenties. Lithe frame, silky black hair, darker skin. Bleeding heart, like my mother. But there was a hardness to her. One built from countless surgeries. Stitching hunters back together after long days battling beasts. I’d wager she’d seen more blood than the rest of us. More death too.



Two years ago, when she’d first arrived at our village, she was doe-eyed and quiet. People thought she was mute. Time and experience change you, though. I could attest to that.



I took a drink of beer and bit back the urge to grimace. “Look, you really want me to say it? If Nicolas or any of his crew haven’t come back yet, it means they’re prob’ly dead. If Nicolas is dead, then I assume he must’ve meant a monster of a beast out there. I pray to Solis that he was able to kill the beast before it finished him off.”



She cuffed me on the shoulder. “How can you act like you don’t give a shit? Nicolas was your friend. All of you. You’re just gonna consign him to death?”



“I’m not consigning him to shit,” I said, a growl in my throat. “Every hunter knows the risks. If they wanna take up arms against the beast, they’re doing so by their own consent. It was his choice to walk out of the village, and whether he comes back or not is up to him. There’s nothin’ I can do about it.”



Sofia leaned close. Her voice was low but firm. “Nicolas was there for you when Thomas died. He grieved your brother almost as much as you. He helped care for your mother, he looked after Jason whenever you were away on a hunt—”



I shoved away from the table and walked off. Sofia wasn’t going to give up that easily, though. She chased after me, a shadow at my heels.



“I don't know why you care so much,” I said over my shoulder. “It’s not like Nicolas was your friend.”



“Nick was a good man. He was a friend to everyone in the village. He looked after people—cared about them. And I want to know what happened to him out there,” she said. “What I don’t understand is how you can be so quick to give up on him.”



I stepped outside, and Sofia followed me. Some hunters and locals greeted me with waves and smiles. A few clapped me on the back as I started down the hillside toward the residential part of town.



“I’m not giving up on him,” I reassured her. “But you know the rules. We hunt. We kill the beasts. We don’t send out rescue teams. We don’t look for the dead.”



“What if he’s not dead?”



“Then he will be by morning. No one, not even Emilia the Ripper, could make it an entire night by herself.”



“Nicolas wasn’t alone.”



“Trust me, I know who he took with him on the hunt. Greybeards and new bloods. Hunters green as grass. Nicolas or not, they ain’t survivin’ the night either.”



Sofia shoved me. I stumbled forward a few paces and caught myself on the side of a building. Nearby, a mother and her child looked over at us. They quickly returned to their chores, knowing better than to get caught up in someone else’s drama.



“I see what people really mean to you,” Sofia remarked. “It’s so easy for you to just cut ‘em loose.”



“It’s easier to mourn a friend than hold out hope against the impossible. I liked Nicolas—he was practically a father to me after Thomas…” I sighed. “But going after him is a death wish. Especially if I go alone.”



“Then don’t go alone.”



I laughed. While Sofia had learned her way around the village, had become inured to some of our more harsh customs, she was still naive about the protocols hunters followed. Protocols first instituted by H.P. Corbet, our founding father. Those same protocols were still practiced under Sir Rafe’s administration. Whether we liked it or not.



Rules kept us civil. Kept us sane. Kept us alive.



“I’d have an easier time convincing hunters to butcher their own families than go out on a death wish,” I said. “Everyone liked Nicolas—they loved him. But I’m willin’ to wager not even a fourth of ‘em would go out lookin’ for him. Especially if they’re not being compensated for it, and we both know Sir Rafe wouldn’t authorize a search and rescue.”



“Doesn’t it concern you that there’s a beast out there that could kill Nicolas?”



“There’s a beast out there that could kill any of us. Never forget that.”



By then, Arthur had caught up to us. He soothed Sofia with half-hearted reassurances that Nicolas would return. “Just wait, you’ll see,” he said. He wrapped an arm around her shoulders and guided her back to the tavern. “Come now, I’ll buy you a drink. We can discuss it further.”



When they were out of sight, I turned for home. But I stopped short, staring at the dark little house at the end of the lane. The house that had once been full of laughter and songs.



Since the days of my father and Thomas, it’d become a hollow ruin just waiting to collapse. And it took everything I could do to keep it upright. That was my job. Not hunting beasts, not protecting the villagers, but keeping my family fed and safe.



But then, I had to wonder what Thomas would’ve done in my shoes. What my father might’ve done.



Instead of heading home, as I should have, I went to the north side where Sir Rafe’s estate resided. He lived in an old cathedral comprised of stone brick with tapered spires and arched windows of stained glass. The front doors were thick wood plated with strips of steel and bolts. A lantern hung from above, creaking in the wind, sending a flurry of shadows swirling at my feet.



I rapped my knuckles against the door and waited. A few moments later, I could hear footsteps from within. The front door opened. Emilia the Ripper greeted me. Blond hair, pale skin, face concealed beneath a hood. She was one of the few hunters who preferred the night.



“I need to speak with Sir Rafe,” I said.



“It’s late.” Her voice was low and gentle. A complete juxtaposition of her appearance. “He’s resting.”



“Then wake him. It’s urgent.”



Emilia studied me for a moment. We’d seen each other out on the field a handful of times, but other than those momentary encounters, we hardly ever interacted. I wouldn’t have been surprised if she slammed the door in my face, but instead, she stepped aside and gestured for me to enter.



The inside of Sir Rafe’s home was a stretch of velvet carpet over concrete floors. In the main hall, there were dozens of old pews where hunters would sit during our council meetings. Down another hallway was Sir Rafe’s personal chambers.



Half the room was a study. Furnished with a large wooden desk. The wall behind it was lined by shelves overflowing with dusty books. The other half, near the right side of the room, was outfitted with a pair of leather chairs sat before a fireplace.



When I entered, Sir Rafe sat in one of these chairs, bundled beneath several quilts and blankets. The hearth crackled and spat embers into the dark. The air stunk of vanilla intermingled with smoke. Both from the fireplace and from Sir Rafe’s pipe.



As I approached, Sir Rafe hummed a merry tune under his breath. A tune I didn’t recognize. He turned his head toward me. A smile pulled at his cracked lips, emphasizing the wrinkles of his face.



Long, wispy white hair cascaded around his shoulders. Grey hairs stippled his face. He was dressed in a dark button-up and smoking jacket with a scarf wrapped around his neck. His hands were covered by a pair of black fingerless gloves.



“Ah, if it isn’t Bernie the Bold,” he said. His words had an underlying croak to them. Old age combined with years of smoking had given him the voice of a toad.



Bernie the Bold was a nickname anointed by Sir Rafe himself. However, most of the others—villagers and hunters alike—preferred Bernadette the Barren. I didn’t care for either title, if I’m honest.



“I apologize, sir,” I said, bowing as was per custom. “I don’t mean to disturb your rest.”



He waved my concerns away and squawked with laughter. “It’s not often that I get a visitor so late. Come now, my child, take a seat. Let us converse in comfort. We can speak long into the night. Swapping stories and thoughts like classroom gossip.”



Suffice to say, Sir Rafe was a ‘peculiar’ man. Popular with the people for his whimsical nature. Babies and children didn’t care much for him, though. They found his withered visage slightly disquieting. They weren’t the only ones.



He sent Emilia away to fetch a kettle of hot water for coffee and tea. Before she could slip out, he asked her to grab a tray of cookies the school children had baked for him earlier that evening. 



My younger brother, Jason, had brought some of those cookies home with him. Hard as a brick, and while they were meant to resemble hunters, they looked more like charred men. I decided to make my visit brief to avoid having to endure any more of them.



“Sir, the reason I’m here is about Nicolas,” I began. “He went on a hunt earlier, and he hasn’t returned.”



Sir Rafe nodded ruefully and rubbed a hand over his stubbled cheeks. “Yes, I’ve heard. Tragic, tragic affair. I commend your concern, but alas, Nicolas and the others are lost to us now. We will hold a funeral for them and may Solis guide their souls to the Eternal Dream.”



“Sir, maybe we shouldn’t be so hasty about the matter. Nicolas is one of the best hunters we’ve got. If anyone could survive out there, it’s him.”



I knew the chances of survival were slim, but despite rationality, I had to feign optimism. If not for myself, then at the very least, for Sofia’s sake.



“Perhaps we could send out a search group,” I said. “If not to rescue them, then to confirm their deaths.”



He cocked an eyebrow. “Now, that is most curious. We’ve never sent out a search party before. Not even when H.P. Corbert didn’t return from his last hunt.”



“I know, sir, but—”



He laid a hand on mine, squeezing gently. “I understand. This is a hard thing to accept, but we must endure. That is the way of humanity.” He patted my hand before returning his to his lap. “Grieve for our fallen brothers and sisters, but don’t give your life for them. You have family and friends.”



“Nicolas has friends too,” I countered.



A pitiful smile appeared on his face. “Yes, I am aware. I was one of those friends. But right now, we don’t need to lose any more brothers or sisters. Not for Nicolas, not for me, not for anyone.”



It was then Emilia the Ripper returned with a tray of burned cookies and a kettle of hot water. She placed them on an endstand and poured two cups of coffee, adding a splash of pasteurized milk. She handed one cup to me and the other to Sir Rafe.



Despite the milk, the coffee was bitter. I choked it down, hoping to curry some favor from Sir Rafe. When he gestured to the cookies, insisting I have one, I forced one of those down as well, much to his delight.



“Please, Bernie,” he said, “do not wrack yourself with guilt over the demise of Nicolas. It can be hard, I know, but—”



He stopped speaking as Emilia leaned down and whispered in his ear. His lips pursed as she spoke, and his brow tightened. When Emilia was finished, he thanked her and rubbed a hand up and down her forearm.



“Bernie,” Sir Rafe said, “are you serious about wanting to look for Nicolas?”



“Of course,” I said. “I wouldn’t have come if I weren’t.”



“While I can’t permit a search and rescue operation, I can offer you a chance to join Lady Emilia on tomorrow’s hunt. She’ll be treading the same ground as Nicolas.”



I frowned. “And what exactly was Nicolas hunting for?”



“A few dens in a city known as Cairnsmouth. About thirty miles from here.”



Thirty miles was a long way to go for a hunt. We usually patrolled the surrounding area unless we thought there were resources worth scavenging for beyond our set perimeter.



“Somethin’ special about these dens?” I asked. “Must be if you’re going so far for ‘em.”



Sir Rafe turned to Emilia. She said, “Nicolas was sent after Gévaudan.”



My cookie and coffee almost came back up. Gévaudan was reportedly the largest and most vicious beast we’d ever seen. Although no one had encountered him in over a year.



That was part of the reason Bram the Conductor had retired from hunting. He became a school teacher and preacher instead. I had to hear about some of his lectures from Jason, and furtively, I was glad to be out of school.



I accepted the offer and finished my coffee. When I was done, Sir Rafe prepared for bed. Emilia the Ripper escorted me outside.



“We leave tomorrow at noon,” she said. “Be at the armory by eleven o’clock.”



“How many hunters are we taking?” I asked.



“Enough.”



I sneered. “Was that how many Nicolas had taken too?”



Her gaze was cold, biting. Her voice even more so. “Nicolas and his team were sent out on reconnaissance. They weren’t supposed to engage the enemy.”



I’d never known Nicolas to disobey an order. Which meant the enemy had engaged him first. If he really was looking for Gévaudan, then the possibility of him being alive was next to naught.



“Starting tomorrow,” Emilia said, “keep your comments to yourself.”



“Starting tomorrow, right?” I asked. “Well, if that’s the case, you can’t make a cup of coffee for shit. Y’know that?”



She snorted. “I’m Emilia the Ripper, you twat. Not Emilia the Housemaid.” She started to close the door. “Tomorrow, eleven o’clock sharp, or we’re leaving you behind.”",1,1761011529.0,scaryjujuarmy,0,1.0,False

Here’s a 1000-word essay draft in the same tone and structure as the DES–Hamiltonian one, bridging avalanche and quantum diffusion.









**After Avalanche: When Systems Run Out of Chaos**





In both cryptography and physics, there’s a point where complexity stops growing and starts to recycle.

In block ciphers, that threshold comes when the avalanche property saturates—when every bit of output depends, in practice, on every bit of input.

In quantum systems, it appears when unitary evolution reaches thermal equilibrium—when the state space has been fully mixed.

In either domain, the dynamics don’t end; they just stop creating new patterns. What happens next is the question Turing, Schrödinger, and the designers of DES would all have recognized: how can structure reappear after total disorder?









**1. Avalanche in a Finite World**





DES, the Data Encryption Standard, achieves confusion and diffusion through sixteen Feistel rounds. Each round mixes bits through substitution boxes (S-boxes), bit permutations, and key-dependent rotations.

Early analyses found something intriguing: by the sixth round, avalanche saturation had already occurred. That is, flipping a single input bit changed roughly half of the output bits, and additional rounds no longer increased diffusion.



Beyond that point, more rounds didn’t make the cipher more “chaotic” — they made it sturdier.

The cipher had reached what you might call maximum entropy under reversible rules.

Every new round reinforced rather than deepened the pattern of disorder.



Mathematically, if we consider the mapping f\_k: \\{0,1\\}\^{64} \\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}\^{64} as the encryption function for key k, then its Jacobian (the matrix of bitwise dependencies) stabilizes around full rank by round six.

Composition adds protection but no new independence.

It’s like stirring cream into coffee: after a few motions, the swirl pattern doesn’t get more mixed — just smoother.









**2. The Quantum Parallel: Thermalization and Saturation**





In quantum mechanics, the same principle governs evolution under the Hamiltonian.

A system starts with some structure — localized particles, clear amplitudes — and then evolves unitarily.

At first, the interference between amplitudes grows richer, phase differences multiply, and observables become unpredictable.

But as the system approaches ergodicity, every accessible state becomes equally weighted in its probability distribution.



The mathematics is exact:

\\rho(t) = U(t)\\rho(0)U\^\\dagger(t)

This is still reversible; no information is lost. Yet to any local observer, the system has “thermalized.” It looks random, though the underlying transformation remains perfect.

The difference between this and DES’s avalanche is only one of scale: quantum evolution mixes continuous amplitudes on complex spheres, DES mixes discrete bits in finite hypercubes.



Both are saturating mixers: their evolution creates complexity until the phase space can’t hold any more.

After that, continued evolution only reshuffles.









**3. The End of Mixing**





Once mixing saturates, the system’s qualitative behavior changes.

In physics, this transition marks the onset of statistical mechanics — where ensembles, not dynamics, describe outcomes.

In cryptography, it marks the point where adding rounds stops increasing security through mixing and instead protects against specific structural weaknesses — differential and linear attacks.



At that boundary, chaos becomes stable.

Entropy production slows to zero.

Reversibility still holds, but in practice the system is opaque — a frozen turbulence.

It’s the mathematical version of the proverb: when everything influences everything, nothing new can happen.









**4. Turing’s Problem: After the Mix**





Turing faced this same paradox in a different guise.

After his work on ciphers and computation, he turned to morphogenesis — the study of how patterns form in embryos.

His question was: if physics and computation both lead to perfectly mixed systems, where does form come from?



His 1952 paper The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis models this by reaction–diffusion equations:



\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} = D\\nabla\^2 \\mathbf{u} + R(\\mathbf{u})



where D\\nabla\^2 represents diffusion (the mixing, akin to avalanche), and R(\\mathbf{u}) represents reaction — local feedback that can reverse or focus disorder.

He effectively asked: what happens when a perfectly mixing system has local rules that amplify small differences instead of erasing them?



It’s the inverse of DES: instead of hiding structure, morphogenesis shows how it can re-emerge from a fully scrambled substrate.









**5. Beyond the Hamiltonian: Changing the Rulebook**





The Hamiltonian, like the Feistel network, defines reversible evolution. But to move beyond equilibrium, one must change the Hamiltonian itself — alter the symmetries or couplings.

That’s how quantum systems undergo phase transitions: a small rule change reorders the entire landscape of states.



Likewise, in cryptography, to move beyond saturation one must change the cipher’s logic — new S-boxes, new key schedules, new nonlinearities.

Each new design family (DES → AES, Feistel → SPN) represents a phase change in informational matter.



In both fields, innovation begins when reversibility alone is no longer enough.

After full mixing, progress lies in asymmetry — in breaking perfect reversibility with new constraints or reactions.









**6. The Mathematical Echo**





The analogy can be made explicit:

||
||
|**Property**|**Quantum System**|**DES Cipher**|
|Evolution rule|Hamiltonian H|Round function f\_k|
|Transformation type|Unitary|Reversible (Feistel)|
|Mixing process|Interference and entanglement|Substitution and permutation|
|Saturation point|Thermal equilibrium|Avalanche saturation|
|Beyond mixing|Change H → new phase|Redesign cipher → new algorithm|
|Emergent order|Spontaneous symmetry breaking|Structural encryption family|

The pattern is recursive: each domain builds systems that mix information perfectly, only to rediscover the need for differentiation — pattern, identity, form.









**7. Philosophical Turning Point: From Entropy to Structure**





The deeper insight here is not technical but conceptual.

Perfect mixing doesn’t erase difference; it hides it so thoroughly that the only way to find new meaning is to start over with new constraints.

In that sense, chaos is the precondition for order.

DES’s avalanche ensures that no bias survives; morphogenesis begins by reintroducing bias — deliberately, locally, and dynamically.



In both quantum and cryptographic evolution, the end of chaos marks the beginning of creativity.

It’s the mathematical echo of life’s own paradox: the need to forget in order to remember differently.









**8. Epilogue: The Reversible Universe**





If you look at the history of these systems as one continuous project — Hamiltonian mechanics, DES, Turing’s reaction–diffusion models — you see a common rhythm:



1. Build a reversible system that preserves everything.
2. Let it evolve until every pattern is entangled.
3. Discover that only by breaking the rule, slightly, can something new arise.





Perhaps that’s the real moral of “after avalanche.”

When the system stops surprising you, the next revolution begins — not by adding more rounds or more time, but by changing what it means to evolve.

Would you like me to illustrate this next, perhaps with a three-panel metaphor (cipher → quantum mix → morphogenesis)?",1,1761011165.0,CartoonsCensoredByGPT,0,1.0,False

i (F19) used to think i was a very sociable person, used to think i had an easy time getting to know others and always made sure other felt happy and comfortable around me. i never really had any issues making friends or anything, but i've always had this deep feeling that i was always the ""friend of convinience"" - only texted when no one else could hang out, most of the times not even texted at all. 

it came in waves, from time to time. i would come to this realization for a few weeks, be really sad, and then forget it happened because although i continued to hang with these people i cared about, i still had a few friends that didn't make me feel like this. 

ever since i started uni, last year, this hit me harder than ever. naturally, people from my hometown started hanging out less and less i haven't been able to make a lot of friends at uni, those i got to know either stopped talking to me and other members of the friend group over a subject we've tried to make ammends with already or i'm not that close with. i see everyone around me has made friends at uni and i feel like i, being in the next to last year of studies, missed out. not only that, but friends that i used to rely on and never made me feel alone did me really dirty this year. went on trips that we all planned without me, left me on read for plans we made for my birthday, got mad at me because i'm no longer the type to go out and get drunk, are making comments about me behind my back...

i also realized that no one i know texts me first to make plans or even just to talk. absolutely no one. people still invite me to birthday parties and to have a coffee when they have a spare time to kill and i happen to be nearby and everyone else is busy - i can always tell because its usually people who always turn down my invitations. 

people are still nice when we happen to see each other. honestly, in person, it feels like nothing happened, until i come home and i never hear from them again until the next birthday party we meet at. 

i feel so alone. i've been spending all my days at home because i have no one to hang out with and it breaks my heart. i don't know what's wrong with me or why people don't want to hang out with me. i'm seriously considering seeking a mental health professional because i've never spent this long feeling so alone and i have no one to talk about this. i can't rant with people because i don't want them to hang out with me out of pitty, or talk to my parents because it breaks my heart to even consider the idea of them being sad or feeling pitty over their adult daughter who doesn't have even one friend.

i'm wondering, has anyone been through something similar? if so, what did you do, what helped?

A very sad and tragic event occurred due to road rage. I personally see it very often across our region. Remember that even a simple honking at someone can escalate quickly. As we all know, we hear honking at others every day you’re on the road. Be safe out there and stay calm. If someone is trying to instigate further escalation drive normal and try to keep space from them. Do not pull off and stop somewhere. If it continues to occur more than a couple minutes contact 911. Try to give as much description of the other vehicle and driver as you can. Remember knowing the plate number helps a ton. If at all possible head directly towards your local police station or look it up in Google maps and head that way, if you can. ",4,1761011139.0,NWALetUsKnow,2,1.0,False

1oc093e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Celibacy/comments/1oc093e/attraction_to_men_who_are_seemingly_not_right_in/,Attraction to men who are seemingly not right in the head? Has led me to pretty much celibacy for 2-3 years at a time,"Okay so up until 18 I didn't know I wanted to have sex with men. I kind of lived with the mentality like I thought they were attractive and everything but I didn't want to do what women do to them I actually wanted to do what men do. Just a man so I just always felt like most men wouldn't be into me like that. Right so I was always like well I'm not really interested in doing the other thing. But it wasn't until I was 18 going on 19 and I was isolated much of my childhood so this is a major reason why I may not have really realized it. But when I was 18 on 19 I saw this one guy left my home. And chose to do something at that time. Well I encountered a lot of interesting people but these people were not all attractive to me so it wasn't like oh all of these bad messed up people on drugs and destitute or attractive to me no it was specifically this one guy. Because he had this specific type of energy and I would have these wild sex dreams about him and everything. And he knew I liked him too.



 He even asked me out and I didn't say no. I just said that I don't like ice cream I don't like coffee. I don't like cake. I never said that I didn't want to date him though I didn't want to. I just wanted to have sex with him. But he took that as a no. But that wasn't actually it was my way of trying to avoid the topic basically and the reason why I try to avoid the topic I wasn't willing to specifically be like yeah that's what I want to do to you kind of thing. Was because I didn't know if he could be still long enough to just calmly do that kind of activity. Because he was that messed up. So like I said I was around destitute people right. But the destitute people literally called this guy crazy they describe and he took meds. I saw them. And he couldn't even sit still for a couple seconds really crazy. Basically so you know I try to avoid him. Because I knew obviously that wasn't a good idea and then he was obsessed with virgins. 




On top of it. So I really didn't want anything to do with him. And he knew I was a virgin. so specifically you know that was that situation and I just thought that that was a one-off situation that oh I'm attracted to men I'm attracted to men with that energy but I didn't think that that energy was connected to being crazy or things of that nature when I say this person was crazy I'm saying he was homeless he was like I said very mentally unstable. He had a preoccupation with virgins. And a major part that helped me get along with this situation was he was jewish. And he didn't like my religion/faith. Though I never told him what my faith was. And it wasn't like I asked if he accepted me or anything like that. It was just the topic came up and like for me I can't just like be quiet about it basically it's all yeah anyway so that produced a situation where you know I don't you know it cause more of a situation where I was able to avoid them at least but this was not just the one case where that happened it was it's a regular thing for me where I like on dating apps I look for that type of energy. Because that's the only energy that gets me aroused. 






That's the only way I get aroused by a man sexually is if they have that energy. And specifically in my personal life I have learned. How messed up some people who have that energy can be. But I would never saw it as oh it's because of your energy it's always been oh someone so is really messed up someone's always crazy and I just want to hit it and quit it kind of think. So like in one case. This one guy. He kept his ex in his locket. Yeah a part of her was in his locket. He said he wouldn't take it off. And that specifically he talked about different fantasies he had like sleeping with people while they're asleep. And liking seeing people surprise or whatever. When he would have sex with them while sleep he liked to talk about strangling. And yeah he was a whole mess. Now that wasn't even all of it. I think then also he would talk about cutting himself. And he didn't have to talk about it I saw the cut marks on him on the back of his legs. And then not just that. He was homeless too. He was living in a hotel at the time he had been homeless in the past he used meth. You see my point very messed up situation right in that situation I was heavily attracted to him. I was like willing to basically do anything just to f*** him. Okay and at that time.



 It was always like I don't want anything emotionally with this guy but I just want to hit it and quit it kind of thing there are plenty of other instances that this is occurred where the person had addiction near homelessness or homeless messed up lifestyle promiscuity so forth. Oh I forgot the last guy was a prostitute too. Recently in my life with my work. I realized something from another co-worker. Not like anything that I cared about. At the time I was always just like it's kind of interesting I can tell. Cuz he had one of those energies but it was always like he wasn't physically attractive to me. So to me it was just like well yeah he has that energy. He was approaching his fifties I think he'll be 50 next year in the beginning of next year in january. Anyway. This was not about anything he did or anything I recognize. It was someone else it was multiple people. Okay so multiple people one person said that the person seemed like they had a scary Aura energy to the point where they killed people and enjoyed it. Another person said that specifically they seem like they were some kind of predator or something. Because of their energy and then another person other people that was actually multiple people who just indicated that the person was crazy. 




So as you can see no I'm not going to just list everyone that has been labeled crazy and had all the problems I just wanted to show you different instances. Two of which I never was involved with sexually my coworker the last one I was talking about never anything he didn't know anything in that capacity and I don't I even debate if I was actually attracted to him or not. But either way. You get what I'm saying here he just like the other two had a lot of problems. And I believe he even had issues with substance issues like meth and he came into work drunk all the time. And again like living with roommates. Kind of life. So my thing is. This is a major issue I find and I think this is a major reason why I always am very into not having a lot of sex. Like I have eds on top of it. And then I've even said another complaint that I've had in another post but this is a major reason is because I always feel like the only men I want to have sex with well I don't want to be around long like specifically going back to the one that I was involved with.




 For example I actually sent this text message to his text messages to reddit. Here. Maybe not this subreddit but still and I remember people telling me if I stick around him too long he will end my life and his life. And he ended up stalking me for at least 3 years I don't know if you still trying to stalk me now today I'm not sure. But last I checked he was only stalking me for 3 years. It's been 5 years almost 6 years. But you know if you are only attracted to men who are really messed up in the head. It becomes a situation where you don't want to have sex with them too much or you don't want to go through a lot of guys in that regard and you want to put it to a minimum. You know kind of thing we're like okay I can be with you sometimes when I need to cuz I have sexual needs sometimes but you don't want to really make that a regular thing. Because you're like living. You know and it's too much of a risk.



 And that's a major reason why I feel like it's so much danger it's because the type of guys I always end up picking are always really messed up the guys that I'm actually attracted to sexually. Like I'm not attracted to other men. In fact if they don't have that energy I don't get what. If they do have that energy I can get aroused and they might not even be trying to do anything in that regard to me. They could just be talking to me about the color of green.




 Literally that happened with my coworker that was just talking about so I mean like when it's like that for me it's kind of like you know if they're the only people that I can get sexual gratification off of for me it's like I have to be very minimum with it. On top of everything. And then also on top of it like I said I live in Vegas and a lot of men are angry. And I went through that in my last message. To you guys but yeah. I think this is why I've gone like 2 years 3 years sometimes not having sex and I think specifically I've been told but other people that I shouldn't even try to do that. Because you know just one could get your life ended and so forth. But for me it's like what I have sexual needs. And you know expecting me to never have sex is kind of like a tall order for me.


I don't have any regrets over this. But I think the perspective is different for some people because I'm not religious. But have my own celibacy journey for 2 years now. Well close to it",0,1761011059.0,Celibacy,3,0.5,False
1oc07ke,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1oc07ke/debugging_love_chapter_1/,Debugging Love (Chapter 1),"My name is Noah Blanchard. I’ve been going to Fifth & Brew Café every morning for the past nine months. That’s two hundred and seventy-three consecutive visits, not counting the one day I tried making my own coffee and nearly burned down my apartment. So yes, it’s safe to say I’m a regular.

It’s not because their coffee is extraordinary. It’s good — don’t get me wrong — but it’s not “sell your soul to the espresso machine” good. No, the reason I keep coming back is because of her… Rosie Martinez.

The girl with the honey-brown eyes, the kind that sparkle like they’re always in on a joke you don’t know yet. The girl who somehow makes teasing me a full-contact sport. She’s got this beautiful, black, long curly hair that’s always tied up in a messy bun, and a smile that could probably crash servers if it were uploaded to the internet.

I’ve tried not to like her. Really, I have. I’m not great at the whole “liking people” thing. Feelings are like software dependencies — messy, unpredictable, and usually breaking something else in the process.

“Morning, Blanchard,” she says the second I step into the café, the bell above the door chiming. Her tone drips with playful familiarity.

Only she calls me by my last name. Everyone else uses “Noah.” But Rosie, she says Blanchard like it’s some inside joke we’ve been sharing for years.

“Hey, uh, morning,” I mumble, adjusting my glasses. I always feel like my arms don’t know what to do around her — too long, too awkward. It’s like they’re controlled by a nervous raccoon.

She grins, leaning against the counter. “The usual? Or are we feeling adventurous today?”

I open my mouth, then close it again. Words. Remember those?

“Uh… usual’s fine,” I finally manage, trying to sound casual. I’m pretty sure I failed.

She laughs softly — not mocking, more like she actually finds me amusing. “One vanilla latte with extra foam for Mr. Reliable coming right up.”

Her teasing should annoy me. Instead, it does something weird to my chest — like static electricity. I shift awkwardly as she starts the espresso machine, humming some tune I don’t recognize.

Fifth & Brew is busy this time of morning, full of people who look far more competent at life than me. Business folks in suits, college students typing like their GPA depends on their caffeine intake — which, in fairness, it probably does.

I retreat to my usual spot by the window, pretending to check emails on my phone, though I’m mostly watching Rosie move around the counter. She’s graceful in that chaotic, caffeinated way — like she’s permanently synced to the café’s rhythm.

I scroll through a few work messages from my team:

 Ben: “Hey Noah, can you check the new build? The login flow is throwing a 500 error.”

 Maya: “Please tell me the bug fix didn’t break the payment system again.”

If it wasn’t obvious from those messages I work as a software engineer at a mid-sized tech company downtown. The job’s fine — quiet, predictable, logical. Unlike Rosie. She’s chaos incarnate. Beautiful, unpredictable chaos.

“Here you go, Blanchard.” Her voice cuts through my internal monologue as she sets the cup in front of me, the foam shaped into a tiny heart.

A heart!?
 Oh god. Did she—?
 No, that’s probably just how she does foam. Random coincidence.

I glance up, and she’s smirking. “You gonna drink that or just stare at it?”

“I, uh… yeah.” I take a sip too fast and burn my tongue. Smooth. Real smooth.

Her grin widens. “You okay there, hotshot?”

“Yep,” I say, voice cracking like a teenager. “Perfectly fine. No injuries here.”

She laughs — a genuine, bright laugh that makes my stomach flip. I love that sound. It’s ridiculous how much I love that sound.

I watch her go back to the counter, chatting with another customer, and sigh. If socializing were a programming language, I’d still be writing in BASIC while she’s fluent in everything from JavaScript to flirtation.



By the time I get to work, I’ve already replayed our brief exchange a dozen times in my head, overanalyzing every word like it’s a line of buggy code.

My coworker Ben swivels in his chair as I sit down. “Morning, Noah. You look… happy? Did the coffee shop girl finally smile at you?”

I freeze mid-sip. “What? No! I mean— she always smiles. It’s customer service. It’s in the job description.”

He smirks. “Right. Sure. And you’ve been coding on weekends because you love JavaScript.”

I glare at him. “Don’t bring JavaScript into this.”

Ben laughs and turns back to his monitor, clearly enjoying himself too much. He’s been trying to get me to “make a move” for months, as if I can just walk up to Rosie and say something suave like, ‘Hey, wanna compile our love into a long-term relationship?’

Yeah, no. Not happening.

Work drags on — endless debugging, meetings, and too much coffee. By the end of the day, I’m fried. As I pack up, my phone buzzes with a notification. A message from Ben:

 Ben: “Are you going tomorrow morning?”

 Me: “To work?”

 Ben: “No, genius. To the café. You can’t go a day without seeing her.”

I stare at the screen. He’s not wrong.



The next morning, I return to Fifth & Brew like clockwork. Rosie spots me the moment I walk in.

“Well, if it isn’t my favorite caffeine addict,” she says. “Guessing you want your usual?”

I hesitate. “Actually… maybe I’ll try something new today.”

Her eyebrows lift. “Oh? Look who’s living dangerously.”

I scan the menu like it’s written in hieroglyphics. “Uh… maybe a macchiato?”

She grins. “Bold choice, Blanchard. I’m proud of you.”

I don’t know why her approval makes me feel like I just got promoted, but it does.

She slides the cup to me a few minutes later, steam curling between us. “Here you go. For bravery in the face of foam.”

“Thanks,” I mutter, smiling awkwardly.

Rosie leans on the counter, chin propped in her hand. “So, what do you actually do when you’re not drinking coffee and blushing at baristas?”

My brain short-circuits. “I—uh—work with computers.”

She smirks. “Really? I never would’ve guessed, Mr. Hoodie-and-glasses.”

“Yeah, shocking, right?” I say, the sarcasm slipping out before I can stop it.

She laughs, delighted. “Ooh, a sense of humor. I knew it was buried under all that awkwardness somewhere.”

I grin, embarrassed but weirdly pleased. “It’s a rare bug. Only appears with caffeine.”

“Well,” she says, eyes twinkling, “guess I’ll have to keep supplying the caffeine.”

That’s when she winks.
 And I swear, my heart forgot how to function.



That night, I couldn't stop thinking about her. Every smile, every quip, every little tilt of her head plays on repeat. I tell myself it’s nothing — just harmless attraction. Except it’s not harmless, not anymore.

I want to know her favorite song.
 I want to know what she does when she’s not behind the counter.
 I want to make her laugh again — not just as the shy guy who orders coffee, but as someone she actually knows.

Maybe tomorrow, I’ll say something different. Something real.

Or maybe I’ll just burn my tongue again.
 Either way, I’ll be back.

**214 days today.**  
Started March 2025 after the night I realized I couldn’t keep breaking my own promises. I felt so far from god, my family, friends, everyone.

So this is what i started doing every morning for 5 months.

**Every single morning (no exceptions):**

**(depends on day) 8:00 am - 9:00 am** – Wake up. No phone, no scrolling, no noise. Just breathe.  
**9:10 am** – Pour a glass of water, stretch a bit, make coffee.  
**9:15-9:20 AM** – Check texts from my accountbility partner, check in talk about how I feel that morning (cravings, sleep, plan for day, etc.)

This I've found the most helpful. Since I wasn't comfortable sharing my problems with my friends/family I started using [textfae.com](http://textfae.com) to hold me accountable. Ik it sounds silly to talk to AI everyday but it saved me a little embarassment and actually helped so! dont knock it till u try it lol. Plus, having someone hold you accountable to your goals you are 90% more likely to reach them.

**9:30 AM** – Follow my planned out day, and complete my 3 ""non-negotiables"" (3 things I MUST do that day)

Everyone should be doing their 3 non-negotiables. Even if I had a bad day outside of those three things I still feel productive and accomplished!

Hopefully this was helpful! it worked for me so maybe itll work for u! Goodluck to everyone!",1,1761010917.0,GamblingRecovery,0,1.0,False

That was when my wife pulled me aside and said that she’s worried our niece has an eating disorder. I’m not as sure about this though.

I was wondering if I posted my list of supplements what people would say. I got long COVID a couple of years ago and have had low energy and had increasingly bad trouble with sleep. I have been taking combinations of these supplements for a while, finally I went to the doctor LOL because of the hypnic jerks I was getting every night. Anyway, the doctors did a blood test and discovered I was iron deficient. I added these iron supplements after I learned I was iron deficient and couldn't tolerate regular iron capsules. I have been taking them for a month and my iron went up 30 points. Just adding the iron I feel super human. Now I know why they call iron man iron man. Also I have fewer hypnic jerks so it kind of solved all the problems I was having (lack of energy, tired all the time, waking up every night). Anyway, just simply taking the iron gave me the effect I was looking for from all this other stuff. So this is another PSA to get your bloods done! I thought I couldn't possibly have iron deficiency because I eat so many iron foods, but I also eat a lot of dairy and drink coffee a lot and have heavy periods so I ended up iron deficient. I also had a stubborn HPV so I was taking AHCC, the HPV cleared but I still take it sometimes because I bought a lot of bottles as it was cheaper to buy 3 bottles at a time. Anyway this is what I am taking:

Floradix liquid iron (just a little)

Blood builder minis (lil vitamin c, folate, B12, iron)

Vitamin d 5,000-10,000iu

Vitamin k 550mcg

Magnesium 400mg

Beef liver

Tumeric 

Olive leaf extract (I have a toenail fungus from damaging my toenail wearing the wrong hiking shoes on a 4 hour downhill hike, this stuff helped for a while but I stopped taking it and the fungus came back 😭)

Fish oil

AHCC 

Asparagus young shoots 400mg

Taurine 1000mg

Veggie mix

Probiotic capsule

Hair skin and nails

Coq10 100mg

Natto 

Vitamin e 268mg

Now, here's Chapter 7: 'Rebirth on Ice' ...

The chilly weather and barren lifescape in Churchill, the small coastal town off the Hudson Bay in Manitoba, cleansed Tony Aldy of his unrelenting previous personal and professional life.

Instead, he was a cog in the machine, a brick in the wall. Aldy merely listened to mountain folk music and stared down a long white line for hours on end in his new slave role as ice trucker. He even embraced the local scene. Tony adopted a pet polar bear for protection, he joined the local men's softball league, he toured the famous petrified moose who were turned to stone. At his best, you could hear Tony Aldy spinning a yarn at the Tundra Pub, retelling old war stories of skidding for miles or plunging into icy waters while making his trucking voyages. Somehow, he failed to bring up his reign as the ruler of a highly advanced California city-state. Oh well, that was another life ago.

Aldy's road trips were extraordinarily challenging and could last months. He once ventured all the way to Guatemala, he'd surfed landslides, seen six time zones, and he'd met folks of all kinds, including a rendezvous with a tavern wench who was having his child. He fell in love with the road and would listen to its hums in absolute silence for hours at a time when he felt the mood. Aldy once went 17 straight days without speaking during a month-long run of pickups and drop-offs in Alaska, but he did watch Ridley Scott's 1982 film *Blade Runner* every single evening during the trip.

Turkish coffee was the delicacy of the area, and Tony Aldy had brought it with him. He prepared several pots per day for his neighbors on days he was in town, but they demanded he start his own business. Scared of taking on a side hustle and being in charge of his own enterprise, Aldy reluctantly partnered with his nearby flatmate named George Cooper, a remarried con man, by Aldy's judgment, who was doing a terrible job hiding a thick southern accent, but Aldy did not know George was doing a much better job at hiding from his previous family, which had become the stars of a network sitcom.

""Welllll, we ought to do it Tony,"" George said, bracing his lips as he suckled on a brown bottle of beer. ""People love this sweet, sweet stuff,"" he sang to Aldy, who laughed and cheers-ed with Cooper. ""Let's do it, big fella,"" he told George. ""And I was talking about the coffee, not the beer, by the way,"" George muttered and spanked Tony hard before shouting ""Ohh!"" like an upset mob boss.

The men took out a small business loan from the Aldylantis Slave Payroll Corporation (ASPC) — as George was also employed through them as the local football coach — and opened an outdoor stand near Churchill's downtown strip. Aldy would stand shirtless and prepare his coffee each morning while listening to Bon Jovi's greatest hits.

The coffee stand, called Big Tony's, sprouted like spring flowers, jumping from a tiny shack to the largest business in the city in short order. Tony incorporated coffees and coffee recipes from all over North America and always brought back new tastes and inspirations from his week-long road trips. Every person in the city drank Big Tony coffee at least once per day, while the building itself became a sort of social lounge for the city.

Over the next several months, Aldy developed deep personal connections with every person in the Churchill community and had a knack for considerate listening, serving as some sort of barista-turned-therapist. Older mariners would gripe about the consolidation of the Port of Churchill under indigenous rule, claiming it was better off under the national umbrella. He also realized just how central the railroad was to the town's economy, since he was apparently the only ice trucker capable of navigating his way to and from Churchill, while most goods were shipped by rail. Despite their small town, Churchill was a force of trade on the Hudson Bay and worked itself into several important bills during the Canadian-American tariff wars. However, Tony eyed greater potential.

Aldy stepped up big time to get Churchill back into the major shipping game. He would campaign while on his ice trucking runs, seeking out whichever senators and local business people he could to try and convince them to re-run their shipping routes through Churchill.

""Come on guys, we're the Gem of Manitoba!"" Aldy bellowed at a town hall meeting in an Inuit hamlet called Rankin Inlet, located several hundred miles north of Churchill on the Hudson Bay coast. He posted signs and purchased billboards everywhere he went with his face plastered as large as it could be to fit on the page, while the Crest of Churchill was imprinted on his forehead. Of course, Tony actually did have the Crest of Churchill branded onto his actual forehead, which was a polar bear with the carcass of a bald eagle in its teeth.

The town was so impressed with Aldy that locals began chattering about him running for Mayor of Churchill. Current mayor Neil Young didn't want to deal with that nonsense, though, and suggested that ""paranoia is striking deep in our local community"" on his next television interview. Aldy hated smug politicians like Young who believed they were above the law. Here was a guy who hardly cared for the betterment of his community thinking he ought to remain in charge. *What a twisted world*, Tony thought.

The race was a powder keg for the town. Young was staunchly old school and believed that new shipping routes threatened the peace and quiet that he came to Churchill for in the first place, while Aldy had illusions of grandeur. Some folks certainly sided with Young, but they were in the minority after Aldy's official campaign launched and he promised to ""blow gold all over Churchill.""

Aldy scheduled a July 4th rally. Debuting a new mustache and oil baron's hat, he rode his polar bear from Big Tony's coffee shop all through the downtown as fireworks shot off in the distance and everyone drank his coffee, which was only slightly laced with LSD, his communion gone psychedelic. Parade-goers stared bullets through Tony as he pulled his megaphone to his mouth and began to explain his vision for Churchill while saddled on his polar bear...

""Thank you so much for visiting with me,"" Aldy thundered. ""Now, I've traveled over half our city to be here and see about this mayoral position. I dare say some of you have heard the more extravagant rumors about what my plans are. I just thought you'd like to hear it from me. This is the face. There's no great mystery.""

""I'm a coffee man,"" he went on. ""I have many wells flowing producing many pots per day. As a real coffee man, I hope you'll forgive my old-fashioned plain speaking. This work we do... is very much a family enterprise. I work side by side with my wonderful partner, George Cooper. You might have met him already.""

George Cooper huffed and puffed and then smiled to steal the hearts of overweight women all over the city.

""The day I take office, 800 men will arrive,"" Tony continued, clapping his hands together for effect. ""They'll erect new apartments, businesses, bridges, most importantly, roads for transport. We'll hire more ice truckers and move much more product.""

""Yes,"" he hissed, ""this is what we'll do."" Aldy pinpointed one other major issue: drugs.

""Let's talk about dugs,"" he stated. ""Now to my mind, it's an abomination to consider that any man, woman or child in this magnificent city of ours should have to look upon methamphetamine as a luxury. We're going to raise marijuana crops here, plant poppy seeds. You're going to have more heroin than you know what to do with. Crack will be coming right out of your ears, ma'am. New pills, agriculture, employment, relaxation, expansion of the mind — these are just a few of the things we can offer you. This community of yours will not only survive under my dictation, it will flourish!""

Tony Aldy snarled as his fans surrounded him and coalesced into one hive crowd, and he chanted whatever came to his mind while everyone repeated him until the sun rose and it was time for Big Tony's coffee shop to open.

While servicing a long line of customers, Aldy last checked out a stunning woman who was 19 years in age but hundreds of years in wisdom. Tony was transfixed by her inner and outer beauty but remembered to play it cool and chided the youthful girl over her coffee order. After probably 75 minutes of shooting the breeze at the coffee counter, the girl gave Tony a look he's seen a few million times and the two absconded to the back area of the store, the brewery. Of course, she was Neil Young's former wife, which just crushed the old Canadian crooner.

When voters noticed Aldy had pillaged Young's young girlfriend from him, the race might as well have been called, because by November, Young didn't even show up to his election night party, knowing his fate was more than sealed. Tony Aldy was elected Mayor of Churchill, a title he never could have comprehended as a youngster.

""Well, I finally got one over on the gales of November,"" he joked to a dead quiet audience who didn't understand his reference. Next, he dropped his trunks and received a much louder reception.

Aldy was fascinated by the town's education department and called George Cooper into his mayoral office to review the institution. Cooper pointed out the obvious bearocratic flaws in Duke of Marlborough Elementary and Aldy called up several school employees who were chipper to see the new town leader.

He destroyed their confidence with his glare and coldly explained to them how pathetic their livelihoods were and how they endangered the progression of a potential monster urban supercenter here in Churchill. Their dismissal was quick and merciless, and Aldy had them tossed into the freezing Churchill River waters, where many believe they either drowned, froze or were eaten by piranhas.

Once rumors hit the streets of Aldy's impressive decisiveness, he made sure to subtly let the town know of his greater power. An old spooky schooner rolled up on the dock and echoed the awful howls of Trevor Amback and Dave Ramsey, then disappeared before a poisonous mist befell the city and Tony mega-phoned to the town that everyone must observe the new 5:00 p.m. curfew.

Several months later, Big Tony's absorbed several city blocks in a pretty small city, still, as every person in the town still sucked down their coffee each morning, albeit unvoluntarily, as the beans had grown crusty and tasteless, the cream expired. But the coffee was required by law to be consumed each morning by every living human in the city, including all children, as it was laced with mandatory Aldy Formula, a concoction of drugs to maintain docility in Churchill after many ""customers"" picked fights at Big Tony's. Once a meeting spot for jovial conversation, Big Tony's fell into more of a Double Deuce type of state, from the movie *Road House*, a place that was understaffed and down in quality, a batting cage for the city's growing legion of street fighters.

George Cooper swallowed hard and tried for 45 straight minutes *not* to cry. He jerked his head around as he reckoned with the slide into madness from his business and political partner, Tony Aldy. He had become the very thing the duo had sworn to destroy: a late-stage capitalist example of sheer greed and power-hungry mania. Big Tony coffee was running at $83 per cup as a practical nectar tax and tasted completely acidic by this point. Enormous walls dominated the city, blocking off the various avenues of industrial transportation — lanes for oil pipelines, many lanes for ice truckers, still plenty of railroad lanes, an expanded airport that required the guard of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police force.

In fact, Tony Aldy had insisted that Churchill and the surrounding area be sliced off from the mainland and fastened into an island, which he decided to rename 'Tony Island.' Having grown far too locally powerful, he turned his enslavement back on the ASPC agents and ran his power flip up the flagpole to let Lightfoot know that he was running the show of a robust and growing personal powerhouse in northern Canada.

""It's sheer megalomania,"" George Cooper argued to his good friend, Gary Busey, a famed Hollywood character actor who had retired in Churchill/Tony Island after hearing of its luxury underwater homes featuring routine whale spotting. The two sat in Busey's glass house and marveled at the whales.",1,1761010349.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Winnipeg Jets vs. Calgary Flames: A Same-Game Parlay for the Ages**

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a hockey clash that’s like a broken ice cream truck—everyone’s trying to get their fix, but someone’s bound to end up with a cone full of disappointment. The Winnipeg Jets (-153) roll into Calgary as favorites, riding a four-game win streak that’s smoother than a Zamboni on a napkin. The Flames (+128), meanwhile, are 0-2-0 at home this season, which is about as welcoming as a bear’s picnic basket. Let’s break this down with the precision of a goalie blocking a slapshot and the humor of a Zamboni operator with a punchline.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why the Jets Are Favored (But Not Out of Their Skates)

The Jets’ implied probability of winning is **60.7%** (-153), while the Flames hover at **43.5%** (+128). On paper, this looks like a mismatch, but let’s not confuse “favoritism” with “foregone conclusion.” The Jets’ strength? Their **4-1-0 road record** and a power play that’s as reliable as a coffee shop in the morning. Their weakness? A defense that’s been penalized like a toddler in a candy store and a goalie, Dustin Wolf, whose save percentage is lower than my chances of winning a raffle I didn’t even enter.

The Flames, on the other hand, are the NHL’s version of a practice dummy—ranked **last in Actual Goals Percentage (28.57%)** and **dead last in shooting percentage (6.9%)**. They average under two goals per game, which is about as effective as a screen door on a submarine. But hey, at least they’re second in penalty minutes (14.0 per game)! That means **more power-play chances** for the Jets, who’ve thrived on capitalizing on mistakes like a vulture at a campsite.

---

### Injury Report: Who’s Missing and Why It Matters

The Jets are missing **Dylan Samberg** (wrist) and **Cole Perfetti** (ankle), two defensemen who are about as replaceable as a third wheel on a tandem bike. Without them, Winnipeg’s blue line is playing 4-on-5 in a game of Jenga. Meanwhile, the Flames are without **Martin Pospisil**, a defenseman who’s missed so much action this season he could write a memoir titled *Icicle: A Journey Through Absence*.

But here’s the kicker: The Jets’ offense is led by **Mark Scheifele**, **Jonathan Toews**, **Gabe Perreault**, and rookie **Lambo**, who’v

I'm worried that if I ask and she says no, then the rest of the semester will be uncomfortable every time we see each other in class.

The deadline was looming, our project manager was starting to get that twitchy eye, and a single, bizarre bug was holding the entire release hostage. The feature would work perfectly fine 99% of the time, but would randomly fail, corrupting data. The weird part? It ONLY happened when I wasn't actively debugging it. The moment I attached a debugger or even just had the console open and was watching it, the bug would vanish. Poof. Gone. It was like the code was camera-shy.

I spent two solid days chasing this ghost. My boss started to think I was losing it. I'd call him over, saying, ""Look, it's about to happen!"" and the moment he'd lean over my shoulder, the program would run perfectly. He'd walk away, and five minutes later, my error logs would light up like a Christmas tree. I started to feel like I was being haunted by a digital poltergeist. My senior dev literally told me, ""Bugs don't just disappear because you're looking at them. Check your logic again.""

Finally, out of sheer desperation, I decided to take a completely different approach. I set up my phone to record my screen and then walked away to grab a coffee, hoping to catch it in the act. When I came back and reviewed the footage, I saw it. The moment my mouse cursor stopped moving for about 10 seconds, the system would hang and the bug would occur. It turned out that a background process was kicking in to reduce CPU usage when it detected user inactivity (i.e., no mouse movement), but it was so aggressive that it was interfering with my main application thread. The bug never happened when I was at my desk because my hand was always on the mouse.

It was the most ridiculous, face-palm-inducing fix of my career. I removed the 'helpful' power-saving feature, and everything worked flawlessly. I showed my boss the recording, and he just stared at it for a solid minute before bursting out laughing. We still talk about the 'shy bug' that only appeared when no one was around to see it.

The Balcony You Didn’t Know You Needed on a Cruise
==================================================

Cruising offers a unique way to explore the world's most beautiful destinations, and one of the best ways to enhance your experience is by booking a cabin with a balcony. In this article, we'll delve into why a balcony is not just a luxury but a vital component of a fulfilling cruise experience. Drawing inspiration from Roberta Hill’s insightful video, **""The Balcony You Didn’t Know You Needed on a Cruise,""** we’ll explore the advantages of balcony cabins, debunk myths, and offer practical tips for securing your own slice of paradise at sea.

The Allure of a Balcony Cabin
-----------------------------

Imagine stepping out onto your private balcony, feeling the gentle ocean breeze on your face as you gaze at the horizon. Unlike crowded public decks or standard interior cabins, a balcony provides a personal oasis where you can unwind and soak in the scenery. Whether you’re watching the sunrise over a picturesque port or enjoying a glass of wine as the sun sets, having a balcony transforms your cruise cabin into a **""real living room at sea.""**

### Uninterrupted Views and Fresh Air

One of the most significant advantages of a balcony cabin is the uninterrupted views it offers. Instead of jostling for a spot on the public deck, you can enjoy the sights and sounds of the ocean from the comfort of your own space. The fresh air and natural light can significantly enhance your mood, making your cruise experience even more enjoyable.

Debunking Common Myths About Balconies
--------------------------------------

### ""Balconies are Underutilized""

A common misconception is that balcony cabins are often underutilized by guests. However, many travelers find that having a balcony becomes an essential part of their cruise routine. Whether it's sipping morning coffee while watching the world wake up or enjoying a late-night stargazing session, balconies provide a unique way to connect with your surroundings.

### ""Balconies Can Worsen Motion Sickness""

Another myth is that having a balcony can exacerbate motion sickness. In reality, many passengers find that being able to step outside and breathe in fresh air can alleviate feelings of seasickness. The calming sound of the waves and the expansive view of the ocean can help you feel more at ease.

Practical Tips for Booking a Balcony Cabin
------------------------------------------

If you’re convinced that a balcony is a must-have for your next cruise, here are some practical tips to help you secure a balcony cabin without breaking the bank:

1. **Book a ""Guarantee"" Cabin**: Many cruise lines offer ""guarantee"" options where you can book a cabin type (such as a balcony) without being assigned a specific room until closer to your departure date. This often results in lower prices, as cruise lines are eager to fill their ships.

1. **Travel Off-Season**: Consider cruising during off-peak seasons when prices are generally lower. This strategy can help you score a balcony cabin at a fraction of the cost.

1. **Leverage Loyalty Programs**: If you frequently cruise with a particular line, join their loyalty program. Many offer perks like discounts or upgrades that can make a balcony cabin more affordable.

1. **Watch for Promotions**: Keep an eye on promotions and sales from cruise lines. Special offers can include complimentary upgrades to balcony cabins, making it easier to enjoy the luxury of a private outdoor space.

Conclusion: Elevate Your Cruise Experience
------------------------------------------

The benefits of booking a balcony cabin on your next cruise are undeniable. From the breathtaking views to the serene private space, a balcony transforms your travel experience into something truly special. By debunking myths and sharing practical tips, we hope you feel empowered to make the best choice for your next voyage. So, as you plan your upcoming cruise, consider the hidden luxury of a balcony—you might just find it’s the perfect addition to your adventure at sea.

I don't need advice or harsh words on my partner. This is why I am not using pronouns, and why I'm using a throwaway account. I'm only including the backstory to add clarity. This being said, I've never been a person that is approached by people for relationships or deep friendships. I've always had to do the approaching. I attract people like a magnet. Everyone, even strangers go out of their way to speak to me and be around me, however, there is never a connection, they typically just want to be around me or ask me for advice or help or want me to listen to them or validate them. It never seems to be reciprocated. Now that I am attempting to move forward alone, I really just need someone who is there for me, too. I have no idea where to start or how to meet people. I am also terrified of having, yet another, friend or relationship where I am doing all of the physical and emotional lifting. I don't mind taking care of other people, but I would like someone to show that same energy back. Even a small percentage. Ask how I am. Ask how my day was. Have a conversation where (after they unload their problems, needs, wants from me) they ask me literally anything about myself. I shouldn't know someone's favorite food, colors, books, movies, coffee order, songs, albums, dreams, wishes, desires, secrets, things they collect, how to make them smile, etc..... WHEN THEY LITERALLY CAN NOT EVEN NAME ONE OF THOSE THINGS ABOUT ME. Where do you meet people? Most all dating sites I've found are all hook up based. Most all forums I've went to are pretty much the same. I don't judge, we all have our skeletons or wants or whatever... That's completely okay. Safe, sane, consensual, adults. It's all fine, I understand. As someone who has, finally, learned that their needs matter as well I just want to know where you go for an actual connection? Even platonicly. Where do 40 year olds go that are just looking for someone to be a friend? It almost makes me feel pathetic to have to ask. Part of me just really needed to get all of this out, because I feel like I'm going insane. It's a fine line between feeling pathetic for having dozens of people that I'm friends to and feeling like none of them are my friend. At the same time, I feel like I'm too egotistical because all I'm looking for is another me. so yeah, there it is. I finally put it out there. Sorry for the pathetic unload. Thank you so much if you actually took the time to read this. Please don't feel the need to comment if you don't have the words. Also, I would appreciate it if there wasn't any negativity in comments. I know a lot of you will have it, and if you just can't resist, you know that will be fine, too. This is public so I will accept that it comes it's the territory.

Hoping to find someone here so I don't have to sign up on dating apps. I'm 34, divorced with no kids, and dating with the sole intention to marry. My end goal is clear: marriage, growth, and peace.

I work in tech. Outside of work, I love reading books, love coffee, gym is regular part of my routine, writing prose whenever I find the inspiration and experimenting with new recipes. I am at the stage in life where I want nothing more than trail walks, family and peace. I'm very decisive about what matters and I get very well along with people who are decisive, very clear about their priorities too.

I'm traditional when it comes to relationships. I'm also religious, I won't be changing my beliefs for anyone, and I'm very open-minded about my partner's faith as long as we respect each other's values. Feel free to ask if that matters to you, I completely understand. I've never dated before (I married right after postgrad), so this is my first time dating, so go through my entire post fully before you send any message since I'll be cautious as to who I respond. Please note that I'm not looking for anything casual, no EMA, ONS, situationships, etc. If your intentions aren't aligned with mine, please don't message me.

I don't drink, smoke, or use drugs. I've worked hard to build a peaceful life, and I'd love someone who has worked hard to build the same.

I'm looking for someone who -

-Has his career and finances in check.
-Grounded, emotionally mature, keeps his family close since family is super important to me.
-Intentional. This is non-negotiable so please be crystal clear about your direction in terms of logistics (this includes life, career, finances and relationships).
-Doesn't flinch at honest conversations, handles conflict with maturity.
-Consistent and follows through since you'll get the same from me.
-Has an active lifestyle.
-Because of work and travel logistics, I'm only looking for someone in Canada, US, Europe.

Deal breakers - drug use, dishonesty, not intentional, inconsistency, emotional immaturity, and lack of effort.

If you're looking for the same, when you message, please include the following so I know you've gone through my post:

-Your age
-Country you're located
-Your relationship intent
-What you're looking for in a partner
-What's your favorite cuisine",3,1761009195.0,reddmatch,1,1.0,False

# For Comedy Fans

# The Chair Company (HBO Max, ~30 min)

What if you were on the verge of uncovering a massive conspiracy, but no one believed you?

*The Chair Company* is the newest series from creators Tim Robinson and Zach Kanin (*Detroiters*, *I Think You Should Leave*). I recently reviewed the pilot in depth, noting that it carries the same chaotic, unhinged energy of *I Think You Should Leave* while folding in a genuinely intriguing mystery that supports a serialized format.

With hilariously weird performances, quotable dialogue (a Robinson/Kanin hallmark), and a fascinating conspiracy at its core, this show will have you laughing out loud and muttering, *“Isn’t that weird? Don’t you think that’s really quite weird?”*

**Current ranking: 4.5/5**

**Similar to:** *Detroiters*, *I Think You Should Leave*

# Chad Powers (Hulu, ~30 min)

After arrogantly fumbling the football at the 1-yard line and costing his team the game, college QB prodigy Russ Holliday (Glen Powell) destroys his career in one fell swoop. Eight years later, a disgraced Russ discovers walk-on tryouts for a college team called “The Catfishes.” Using prosthetics and wigs from his dad’s job as a makeup artist, he goes undercover as the unassuming titular “Chad Powers.”

With help from the team mascot Danny (Frankie Rodriguez), Russ must maintain his disguise amid sweaty prosthetics and rising suspicions.

*Chad Powers* is unexpectedly hilarious — edgier than you’d expect, with Glen Powell showing off impressive comedic chops. His dual performance as Russ/Chad makes him a character you love to hate. The series also has surprising emotional depth which helps the mean-spirited comedy go down a little easier.

If you like edgy sports humor or want to see Powell make the leap to TV comedy, this one’s worth the watch.

**Current ranking: 3.8/5**

**Similar to:** *Eastbound and Down*, *Ted Lasso* (minus the wholesomeness)

# Smiling Friends (HBO Max, ~11 min)

Do you need a smile? Look no further than *Smiling Friends*[!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYG-BLlvTpI) Whether through the help of the adorable Pim Pimling (Michael Cusack) or the cynical Charlie Dompler (Zach Hadel), this Pennsylvania-based nonprofit is dedicated to making people smile — which, as it turns out, isn’t always so easy.

Now in its third season, *Smiling Friends* remains one of the funniest, most creative, and most rewatchable adult cartoons of the past decade. With highly dynamic and imaginative art, fast-paced storytelling, and a perfect blend of wholesome and unhinged humor, it’s ideal for anyone who wants a quick laugh without committing to a full show.

**Current rating: 4.5/5**

**Similar to:** *Rick and Morty*, *Aqua Teen Hunger Force*, *Mike Tyson Mysteries*

# For Drama Fans

# Task (HBO, ~60 min)

When a string of gang stash-house robberies in the Philadelphia area are linked to a vengeful Robbie Prendergrast (Tom Pelphrey), alcoholic FBI agent Tom Brandis (Mark Ruffalo) heads a task force to stop the chaos before a full-blown gang war erupts.

Created by Brad Inglesby (*Mare of Easttown*), *Task* continues his fascination with morally gray crime stories set in Delaware County. It’s exactly the kind of gritty, character-driven drama HBO is known for. *Task* is filled with great performances, phenomenal action sequences, and lots of Wawa coffee.

It’s not quite a masterpiece, but *Task* proves that when HBO does crime drama, everyone involved — writers, directors, actors — are firing on all cylinders.

**Rating: 4/5**

**Similar to:** *Mare of Easttown*, *Big Little Lies*, *The Night Of*

# Murdaugh: Death in the Family (Hulu, ~60 min)

If you’re like me, you might be wary of Hulu’s true-crime dramatizations — especially after clunkers like *A Good American Family*, *The Girl from Plainville* (though I may be in the minority of haters on that one), or *The Dropout*. So I went into *Murdaugh: Death in the Family* expecting the worst. I’m happy to say it’s great.

This series is on par with *The Act* (also featuring Patricia Arquette)— it dramatizes real events with enough psychological insight to rise above cheap retelling. With stellar performances from Jason Clarke, Patricia Arquette, and newcomer Johnny Berchtold, *Murdaugh* captures the corruption, arrogance, and self-destruction of the ultra-wealthy in haunting detail.

If you’re fascinated by true crime and the consequences of greed, don’t miss this one. If you know nothing about the Murdaugh’s, let this show tell you everything you need to know.

**Current rating: 4/5**

**Similar to:** *The Act*

# Devil in Disguise: John Wayne Gacy (Peacock, ~60 min)

If you were disappointed by *Monster: The Ed Gein Story* — which romanticized its killer and fabricated most of its plot — *Devil in Disguise: John Wayne Gacy* is the antidote.

Even after having only seen one one episode, it’s clear this series avoids the usual pitfalls of true-crime dramatizations (looking at you, Ryan Murphy). It focuses on honoring the victims and portraying Gacy not as some charming antihero but as a man desperate to *appear* likable. Michael Chernus delivers a chilling performance that’s disgustingly convincing.

I’m not fully caught up yet, but if the first episode is any indication, this has promise to be one the best serial killer dramatizations in years.

**Current rating: 4/5**

**Similar to:** *Last Call: When a Serial Killer Stalked Queer New York, Dr. Death*

I f(21) just got diagnosed with PCOS over the summer in early August. It made a lot of sense because both my sister and my mom struggle with endocrine problems, and a lot of my daily habits didn’t add up to the weight I gained. I have a very time-consuming major and work 2 campus jobs, so I’m really busy throughout the day and most days I’m out at class/work from about 8 am to 8pm. On top of that, I’m a senior in college so naturally I want to go out to the bars with my friends on the weekends (which I know alcohol is frowned upon for PCOS). I’m on metformin, birth control, and spironolactone and I’ve been trying to change my diet habits but I haven’t seen or felt much of a change yet. It’s really really difficult for me to try and make healthy decisions with how busy I am, so I was wondering if anyone had any advice? 
Here are some of the things I do currently to try and help my pcos symptoms:
- walk to class (about 3 miles total a day) 
- snack throughout the day because I normally don’t have time to go home in between my classes during the day (things like chomps, protein bars, chobani yogurt protein drinks, fair life core power drinks, boom chicka pop)
- swapped sugary drinks at the bars for vodka sodas with sugar free lemonade packets I bring to put in  
- try not to eat out at fast food places at all, and if I do it’s during the weekend with friends 
- eat things like chicken caesar wraps, chick pea pasta with cottage cheese blended into it, goodles, real good chicken tenders for dinner 
Things I’m struggling with:
- going a long time without eating and probably spiking my blood sugar when I do finally eat 
- getting a good amount of sleep every night (between classes/homework and work I usually only get an average of 5-7 hours a night) 
- working out and walking outside of just walking to class (I’m always exhausted) 
- sometimes getting food/coffee from Starbucks when I’m out all day and forget to bring snacks 
- eating good dinner meals (I’m so exhausted all the time and also struggle with depression so getting myself to cook or even meal prep is difficult) 
- self confidence: I gained about 60 pounds last spring and coming back to school and seeing that a lot of my clothes don’t fit me anymore is really hard) 
- feeling overwhelmed and guilty if I made bad food choices throughout the day 
I’m sorry this is a long post, but if anyone can relate to this or has any advice to make my life a little easier, I’d really appreciate it. I feel like PCOS has completely turned my world around and I just want to feel like a normal college student but I can’t anymore. Thanks in advance everyone!",1,1761008640.0,PCOS,1,1.0,False

Well, nobody asked for an update and I don't know how to use Reddit, so I'm sharing here cause I need to get his out of my system.

In my original post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1nj1kmb/my\_ex\_is\_joining\_my\_work\_project\_after\_a\_year\_of/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1nj1kmb/my_ex_is_joining_my_work_project_after_a_year_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

I shared how an ex boyfriend reappered in my life after a year fo no contact and I had to work with him.

Well, now the project has been over for a week, and I needed to share this with someone.

During the project, I had to work with him hand on hand, and I decided to keep the comunication as professional and impersonal as possible. We never exchanged a ""how are you"" ""how you've been"" etc. We just got to bussiness and kept on going until the project was done.

On the last day of the job; this was a particular hard day, I was working until about 3.30 in the morning, rushing and running around to keep our deadlines and caring for every single detail on this job to make sure that everything went well.

During this day, I meet with him in the morning, and we discussed numbers. At one point, he drifted from the work conversation, and mentioned that I seemed mad at him, and he wanted to know why. I shut his questions down and basically told him that as far as I'm concerned, I didn't care if the job at hand was done by him or absolutely anyone else, as long as the job was done. He seemed quiet after that, and later, as the night approached and I drove through the city following the project, I started feeling guilty for being rude.

I texted him. ""I just want to clarify that I don't hate you. You seem to believe I do, but that's not the truth""

He replied instantly. We ended up texting for a while about this; and maybe out of weakness from being sleep deprived and lack of food, I started to be honest with him. I told him I didn't hate him, but I was not capable of playing friends with someone who had hurt me so deeply, neither did I forget that he came to me aid when I needed him. I told him I wished I could be capable of holding a cordial relationship with him someday again, that I had considered him a friend before, and that I do not wish ill on him.

After a short text exchange he agreed that he would like to try and have a cordial communication with me again, and said he would text me the next week after he returned from a work trip to see if we could talk. I agreed and tried to forget about this, since I was 100% sure that call was never going to come. I figured this would be a way for him to clean his concience for treating me so poorly and didn't actually think he would pull through.

Well...

He did.

He texted me last night and asked if I was still up for a cup of coffee to catch up. I said yes and we meet today.

A lot was said over coffee, and overall the date was aroung 4 hours of talking. I have to admit that after one point I couldnt hold it back and I just starting letting tears run down my face while we talked. There was no drama, no hostility, no nothing..... I was just so heartbroken to realize that after two years of thinking I was over this man, I still love  him so deeply.

We talked about the circumstances of our break up, he apologized for hurting me, and share a bit of the heartbreak he himself had been through after leaving.

The hardest part for me was asking questions. And like I told him, I was being honest 100% with him, since now (2 year later) I have nothing to lose. So I asked... I wanted to know if he regreted leaving me. If he ever wished he could have me back, and if he ever felt sad about not trying to make it work.

He went quiet for a bit, and then started talking about why he had left. How he wasn't in the right mindset to be in a relationship, how he knew he had screwed up.... and how he felt (in his own words) that he was pulling away from someone that was really worth it, but still knew he just couldn't stay.

He said it hurt him a lot to know how much pain he had caused me, and that if I found any comfort in it, he wanted me to know that this decision hurt him too. (it wasn't comforting tho)

This has all hearbreaking to hear.

Here I was, two years later, looking into the eyes on the man how broke me, and still I felt such a profund love for him. So I told him that. That I was sad to know that he thought ""I was worth it"" but not enough to try and stay with me. And despite that, I didn't regret the words of love I spoke to him. I told him I didn't regret, nor I took back anything. My love for him was true, and that's all that mattered to me.

A lot more was said during those for hours. But in the end, we finished the coffee with some shared laughs, and when we each got on our motorcycles, we parted ways with a long hug. We held each other and I ran my hand through his hair, as I used to do before, when we where together.

We left, and so the silence will stand.

We talked about maybe being friends again someday, but my hopes are not high.

So, there it is. That's the updated and finale of this post. Today I said goodbye (again) to the man that I feel in my heart of hearts is the love of my life. So tonight I'm just cuddling on the couch with my dog and a glass of wine, hoping that tomorrow this feeling that the universe is playing dirty on me, will finally be gone.

Thanks for reading, if anyone did.
