obviously okay to listen to whatever you like, right?
But over a couple year's I've been judge by my friends and my dad for liking K-pop, and its so annoying. Today was the last straw.


(Backstory: In our living room we have these big speakers where you can just sit down and put on some music. My dad always sits there and listen to his type of music: rock, country, and more.)



Today it was a normal day as usual. My dad wakes up, makes coffee, and sits down on the couch in the living room and puts on some music. After like 30 min he decides to go on a walk and I see my chance to put on my type of music (K-pop). He then comes back after 15-20 minutes and starts complaining about
how loud and annoying type off music i listen to, and then he tells me: ""You should listen to other types off music that you actually understand, and thats more normal to listen to"" (since it's mostly in korean)


Like what? Excuse me? I don't always need to understand what they're singing about, in my opinion all that matters to me is just the presence off K-pop that makes me happy, makes me smile, and keeps me alive (Obviously I listen to other type off music but I like and listen to kpop the most.)


When he said that I turned off the music and walked back to my room and hopped into my bed. He ruined my perfectly happy mood. I dont know if i overreacted or not, but it hurts when the people you have the closest doesn't support what you like.


(And im not saying that they have to like the same things as me, I'm just saying it would be nice for then to accept what I like)

I urgently need your help.

Three weeks ago, I bought a used Mechanika IV and cleaned it for the first time with cleaning solution a few days ago. Since then, the coffee tastes awful. It feels like there are cleaning residues stuck in the machine.

Here‚Äôs what I did:
	1.	I used a cleaning solution in the blind filter and ran it until no dirty water came out. Then, I flushed it with clear water. Unfortunately, I ran out of water after the 5th-8th cycle. I turned off the machine overnight, and the coffee was undrinkable the next day.

Since then, I‚Äôve flushed at least 10 liters of water through it without success. In another forum, I was advised to use baking powder. I tried that, and it seemed to help a bit.

However, whenever I pull a shot of coffee, it still tastes terrible.

Could it be the beans? They‚Äôre relatively new and tasted great before the cleaning. However, when I grind them and taste them on their own, they already have a strong resemblance to the coffee coming out of the machine.

I‚Äôm completely lost. I‚Äôd appreciate any help you can offer.

Your stunning new bright smile is finally complete, but now you're wondering about your beloved morning coffee. The moments after professional teeth whitening are crucial for maintaining those pearly whites, and your beverage choices can significantly impact your results.

Why Coffee Is a Concern After Teeth Whitening

Coffee is notorious for staining teeth due to its intense pigmentation and acidic nature. After a professional teeth whitening procedure, your teeth become temporarily more porous and susceptible to discoloration. The microscopic channels in your tooth enamel are more open, making them more vulnerable to staining agents.

Key Reasons to Avoid Coffee Immediately After Whitening:
- Increased tooth sensitivity
- Higher risk of immediate staining
- Potential compromise of whitening results
- Open dental tubules that absorb color more easily

Click here to learn more: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com

How Long Should You Wait Before Drinking Coffee?

Dental professionals generally recommend waiting **at least 48 hours** after teeth whitening before consuming coffee. This crucial window allows your tooth enamel to re-mineralize and close the microscopic channels that are prone to staining.

Recommended Waiting Periods:
1. Immediate post-whitening: 48 hours
2. Ideal waiting time: 72 hours
3. Maximum protection period: One week

Alternative Beverage Options During Recovery
- Water
- Herbal tea
- Clear liquids
- White or light-colored beverages

Potential Consequences of Drinking Coffee Too Soon

Drinking coffee immediately after teeth whitening can lead to several unwanted outcomes. The dark pigments in coffee can quickly penetrate the temporarily weakened enamel, potentially creating **permanent staining** that might require additional whitening treatments.

Long-Term Effects of Premature Coffee Consumption:
- Uneven whitening results
- Faster color regression
- Increased tooth sensitivity
- Potential damage to whitening investment

Tips for Safely Reintroducing Coffee After Teeth Whitening

When you're ready to enjoy coffee again, consider these professional recommendations:

1. Use a Straw
**Drinking coffee through a straw** minimizes direct contact with your teeth, reducing potential staining.

2. Rinse Immediately
Always rinse your mouth with water after consuming coffee to reduce pigment adherence.

3. Practice Good Oral Hygiene
Brush and floss regularly to maintain your whitening results.

Maintaining Your Bright Smile Long-Term

Beyond the initial waiting period, you can still enjoy coffee while protecting your white smile. Consider these strategies:

- Limit coffee consumption
- Use whitening toothpaste
- Schedule regular dental cleanings
- Consider professional touch-up treatments

Nutritional Considerations and Teeth Whitening

Understanding the relationship between diet and dental health is crucial. Coffee isn't just a potential stainer‚Äîit's also acidic, which can impact overall tooth enamel health.

Professional Insights on Coffee and Dental Health

Dentists recommend moderation and proper oral care. While coffee can stain teeth, good hygiene practices can mitigate potential negative effects.

Surprising Statistics:
- 64% of Americans drink coffee daily
- Professional teeth whitening can brighten teeth by 5-10 shades
- Proper post-whitening care can extend results by months

Conclusion

Navigating coffee consumption after teeth whitening requires patience and strategic planning. By following professional guidelines and practicing mindful oral care, you can enjoy your favorite beverage while maintaining a bright, beautiful smile. Remember, the short-term sacrifices will lead to long-lasting, stunning results that will make your investment in teeth whitening truly worthwhile.",1,1736883922.0,Teethgumhealth,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve had this strange dry lip issue for the past 1 year or so and I can‚Äôt seem to figure out how to get rid of it, even though I‚Äôve found out some potential triggers.
It‚Äôs always there, but definitely gets worse after drinking anything caffeinated, especially coffee (and as a coffee lover it‚Äôs been so hard üò≠). Within an hour or so my lips will start to feel leathery and itchy/burn. Within about two days my lips will discolor (kind of looking like smokers lips tbh) and stay this way. If I stay completely caffeine-free it will go away in about 2 weeks (after a lot of discomfort and burning along the way). 
I‚Äôve tried eating low-glycemic, less sugar, more protein, lower gluten and nothing seems to be helping. Derm just told me to use hydrocortisone but that‚Äôs not a cure. I‚Äôve tried different toothpastes (SLS free sensodyne extra whitening) and lip products but all to no avail. The worst of the symptoms go away as long as I stay caffeine-free but some level of the dryness stays even when avoiding caffeine. Caffeine just makes it a lot worse.
Why do I get this? üò¢

1i1ejkr,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1i1ejkr/you_cant_make_this_up/,You can't make this up,"Last spring I (27 ftm) got surprise dumped by my partner(24 nb) of a year and a half. It was the first time I've had my heart broken. They and I do not talk. They broke up with me to work on themselves and said they wouldn't be dating for a long time after. I was a total mess but was able to move on realizing just how wrong we were for one another. 

About two months later in July I started seeing someone new. I wasn't planning on dating anyone I was just looking for something fun and casual and she(24 f) was on the same page. But we couldn't help it and ended up falling in love. I had never felt such a connection with another person before. We can talk for hours and hours and have amazing chemistry. She was planning a solo European trip for the end of the summer and she invited me to tag along for part of it, and I did. We had an amazing time and it solidified how compatible we are. We had been able to navigate and communicate through issues very well. I was always honest with her about where I was at with my last breakup and how that was affecting me as we grew together. She was always hammering in how honesty was the most important thing in a relationship and how keeping secrets only leads to pain. She however had given me reasons to be distrustful of her but we talked through them and we felt stronger. 

  
Last Friday I caught my gf in a lie about meeting up with her ex-girlfriend for coffee a month ago when she hadn't told me. I'm not against her seeing this ex, but this ex has always left a bad taste in my mouth because of how their relationship ended. We've had many conversations about boundaries with this ex and I was surprised she hadn't told me. She apologized and we cleared things up and were about to move on when she said to me ""There's one thing I have been keeping from you"". She then proceeded to tell me that after our second date when we had first started seeing each other, she went on a date with my ex and they had sex. She found out on the date that they were my ex and did not specify to my ex that we had been hooking up. She waited six months to tell me this. She followed up with not wanting to hurt me, not wanting to lose me, it didn't mean anything and it only happened once and they never spoke again. But I'm not sure how I can move forward with her after this. I do love her very deeply, but this is the fourth time in six months that she's done something dishonest to me. I know I shouldn't stay, I mean I've already told my mom about this so I really can't stay with her, but it just feels so hard to let go. I told her to give me a week and we can talk again. I think she and I need to be on our own to figure things out. I'm feeling so hurt and want to reach out to her, but I know it isn't fair to her for me to do that. I'm having a hard time staying strong and I just don't know what to do. Everyone has told me I need to end it and go no contact, but I'm just not ready to cut her out of my life.

  
I did reach out to my ex and asked to meet up this week to talk. I knew they had been wanting to have me back in their life, but I'm not sure they're ready to have the conversation that's needed for me to allow them in. I want to ask them about what happened with my gf, because again, I don't trust my gf anymore. I believe my ex would tell me the truth because they have no reason not to. So I'm meeting with them tomorrow to find out more because it also seems like they weren't aware of how my gf and I knew each other when they hooked up. ",1,1736883718.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

for context, I'm 17 and have struggled with anorexia, orthorexia, arfid and a harmful fixation on protein and fiber since I was 14. At certain points I was consuming upwards of 400 grams of protein a day, others over 75 grams of fiber a day,  and still others I was eating fractions of a toddler's intake. Obviously all of this was bound to mess up my GI system at some point, but now that I am really struggling, I'm really confused. I've been working with a combo sports/eating disorder dietitian who has been helping me to slowly but steadily increase my intake and balance my protein with true carbs and fats, and while progress hasn't been quick or easy I am challenging myself every day. 

The catch comes almost exactly a week ago. I'm heading to my first day back from winter break, and i'm feeling horribly nauseous. I'm emetophobic, but somehow I am able to convince myself it's my usual anxiety-nausea, although it feels very different. About 5 minutes from school I frantically ask my mom for a bag, and she hands me a tiny empty bag of trail mix, which I promptly vomit into. I eat simple, bland foods for the rest of the day (albeit definitely not enough), and chalk it up to a little too much almond extract in my coffee, or maybe my cereal being a week past the best-by date. I toss the cereal.

The days that follow, every single thing I put into my body feels like it sticks in my chest and takes hours to go down. bending down with my head past my sternum makes bile and food rise to my mouth, and I'm burping and farting like nobody's business (i STINK.) I can feel my stomach trying to digest, but have only had a solid bowel movement twice since that Wednesday, even with multiple capfuls of Miralax every day. My stomach is distended both in the upper and lower, and hard to the touch. What happened to me, and why did it come on so suddenly???

Context: I did not finish my college. I'm currently a VA. Pag wala sa peak season nasa 1-2 hrs lang ang work ko. Earning around 20k+. Sobrang dami ko pang time kaya gusto ko magadd ng another income.

Corporate - Probably BPO. Fix ang sahod. Dagdag experience. Gusto ko din natry sa corpo kasi never pako nahire locally. Okay lang sa puyatan since nasanay na. Toxic? And medyo introverted ako ng onti.

Another VA job - I tried looking for another client. Pero nakakapanghina I feel like di pa sapat yung experience ko bilang VA at nakatyamba lang ako sa una kong VA job. (Kaya gusto ko din magBPO for some experience). Not stable job. Mataas ang pasahod. No Government  benefits. 

Pop Up coffee - I'm really passionate about coffee and I can say na masara ang timpla ko. High earning potential, higher risk din since need ko maglabas ng capital. 

Previous Attempts: Nagtry ako maghanap ulit ng client online, pero parang napagiwanan na talaga skillset ko and feeling ko nakukulangan ako sa experience. Nagtry na rin mag apply sa BPO. Rejected nung una since nalaman nilang may other commitment ako. Bir registered kaya need ko idisclose for tax purposes.  I should have just kept my VA job and closed my bir. (Lol)

Sa Pop Up coffee nakapagtry nako dati, may 0 days. And may Okay days. Walang guarantee sa business. Pero pwede pagsikapan. High risk lang din since balak kong i Credit card lang mga gamit na bibilhin ko. (May VA job pa rin naman to support the payments sa CC)

Medyo nalilito lang ako. I'm getting older.  And I'm afraid if all these failed and no choice ako kung hindi nag apply sa corpo.

Hey, fellow Travel Trotters! I‚Äôm thrilled to share my incredible journey of exploring 50 countries around this beautiful globe we call home. Grab a cup of coffee (or your favorite local drink) and join me as I spill the beans on some unforgettable experiences and top travel tips!

### ‚ú® Unique Adventures Around the World

1. **Moroccan Markets Madness üïå**: Walking through Marrakesh‚Äôs souks was a sensory overload. The vibrant colors, enticing smells, and lively haggling make it a must-do! Pro-tip: Always smile and engage the vendors in conversation; it‚Äôs not just about the sale but the interaction.

2. **Chasing the Northern Lights in Iceland üåå**: One of the most magical moments of my travels was watching the aurora borealis dance across the Icelandic night sky. Tip: Check solar activity forecasts and head out of the city‚Äôs light pollution for the best views.

3. **Japanese Cherry Blossom Season üå∏**: Experiencing hanami in Kyoto was like stepping into a fairytale. Join the locals with a picnic under the blooming sakura trees for an authentic experience‚Äîpack some sushi and sake for an extra treat!

### üó∫Ô∏è Travel Tips from a Seasoned Globe-Trotter

**Travel Buddy or Solo? ü§î**: I‚Äôve learned traveling solo gives me a deeper connection with the place, allowing spontaneous adventures. However, having a travel buddy can enhance the fun factor during group activities. Adjust based on your travel goals!

**Packing Smart üéí**: Always carry a versatile scarf‚Äîit can be a blanket, pillow, or even a makeshift picnic mat. And remember: pack twice as little yet bring twice as much money.

**Embrace Local Cuisine üç≤**: Food is a gateway to understanding culture. Whether it‚Äôs trying haggis in Scotland or durian in Thailand, keep an open mind (and brave stomach)!

### ü§ù Cultural Insights

- **Respect and Adapt**: In places like Japan, understanding and respecting the culture‚Äôs etiquette is paramount. A simple bow can make all the difference in a friendly exchange.
  
- **Language Smiles üòä**: Learn a few basic phrases in the local language‚Äîit opens doors and hearts. Trust me, a friendly ‚Äúhello‚Äù or ‚Äúthank you‚Äù in the native tongue goes a long way!

*I work at a company as an Ops Coordinator. It was apparent after a few months that I lacked the analytical skills to really excel in my position and I am now considering resigning before they are forced to let me go and make way for better suited individuals.  At this company, we have a points/rewards system, and one of the rewards is a 30-minute coffee outing with my boss. I'm considering using this reward to sit down with my boss before I leave the job, I sometimes get a weird vibe from him like he thinks I am an idiot or that I'm not worth his time? It's not always that way but most often that's the vibe I get.* 

  
*I‚Äôve been reflecting on my time here , almost 6 months, and, despite some things not going as planned, I want to leave on good terms. I feel it‚Äôs respectful and shows maturity to have a conversation with my boss about my experience at the company ‚Äì what went well, what didn‚Äôt, and how things could have been better. I also want to share my future plans in a way that leaves the door open for any possible future opportunities. I just don't want to waste his time and have it be something he can joke about when I'm gone.*

**What I want to discuss:**

* *What was accomplished during my time here.*
* *What goals didn‚Äôt get fully realized and why.*
* *Feedback about the work environment, if relevant (but not too negative).*
* *Asking how my boss would like to navigate my resignation to ensure a smooth process.*

**Questions for the R/ community:**

* *Does this sound like a good approach, or would it be uncomfortable for my boss?*
* *What should I avoid bringing up or saying during this meeting?*
* *Is there any specific way I can approach this that would make it feel like a productive conversation?*",1,1736882969.0,WorkAdvice,0,1.0,False

He knew how to keep the audience entertained, making him one of the best players this season. Rating: 8.5/10



2. Rajat ‚Äì Rajat‚Äôs journey was filled with anger and clever gameplay. His phrase ‚ÄúSami-Karan‚Äù became more famous than the show‚Äôs theme ‚ÄúTime ka Tandav‚Äù. One of the best parts of his journey was whenever he became the Time God of the house. He used his number game strategy during nominations, making them unpredictable and exciting. His journey was full of twists and kept things interesting throughout the season. Rating: 8/10



3. Avinash ‚Äì Avinash‚Äôs journey was dominated by his overacting, ego, and arrogance. His attention-seeking attitude was often annoying, but the real issue was that he never got called out by Salman Khan for his wrongdoings. This lack of criticism only boosted his arrogance, making him think he could get away with anything. Despite this, he still managed to play a good game and made it to the finale week. If he had been bashed for his behavior, it might have kept his ego in check and made his journey even better. Rating: 8/10



4. Chum ‚Äì Chum‚Äôs journey surprised everyone. At first, nobody thought she‚Äôd reach the finale week, but she proved them wrong by playing tasks well and forming strong bonds. She played a good game, even better than many favorites and contestants who were considered very strong. If she had shared her opinions more openly and confidently, she could have been a serious contender for the top spot. Rating: 7/10



5. Vivian ‚Äì Vivian didn‚Äôt do much the whole season except drink coffee. Most of the attention he got was thanks to Karan and Shilpa. Despite the makers trying to push him forward, he stayed boring. Honestly, he‚Äôs in the finale week because of favoritism, not because of his performance. Rating: 5/10



6. Shilpa ‚Äì Shilpa‚Äôs entire game revolved around Karan and Vivian. If it weren‚Äôt for her 10-week contract, she would have been evicted long ago. She did create a Maa-Beta angle and formed some bonds, but overall, her game wasn‚Äôt impressive. Rating: 3/10


7. Eisha ‚Äì Eisha‚Äôs journey was all about gossiping, insulting others, and constantly badmouthing Karan. Her entire game revolved around spreading negativity and clinging to Avinash. She didn‚Äôt contribute much to tasks or form genuine bonds, yet always acted as if she was playing a smart game. Honestly, her journey was pointless, filled with fake emotions. Rating: 0/10

Day 0 (Saturday, start of fast at 1PM): We had been to Karlovy Vary for the weekend, I hadn‚Äôt had a breakfast, but took a black coffee and chia seeds with lukewarm water before starting the trip. For lunch, I ate pumpkin soup, chicken skewers and one slice of margarita pizza. I also finished 1/4 glass of hot chocolate that my wife couldn‚Äôt finish. As per tracking app that I usually use, all these combined are at 800 calories which ends at 1PM.

Post this we continued sight seeing, and reach back home in Prague by 7PM. Overall this day I drove two way for 4 hours and walked 14,000 steps. Was scrolling at night, and decided to try the 72 hour fast mainly to see effect of autophagy.

Weight: 87.5 kg
Step count: 14,158

Day 1: Woke up at 6AM, but was tired from yesterday‚Äôs driving. Decided to sleep again after using the washroom. Woke up at 10AM, feeling fresh. We went to IKEA and spent a good 4-5 hours shopping household stuff, which kept me busy. I was tempted to eat as my wife ate at IKEA, but I controlled and had nothing to eat this day, only lots of water at regular intervals. 

Weight: 87kg
Step count: 11,429

Day 2: Woke up at 5:30AM. Felt a bit tired than Day 1, but had a good 7-8 hours sleep. Even though the weight loss was 500g from Day 1, I could feel my stomach lost inches (didn‚Äôt measure). The 36 waist size jeans, which I used to wear low waist could now fit on my stomach easily. Big day, as I had to work full time plus fast. I had bad hunger pangs at around 12PM (47th hour) info fast, most likely triggered since I have my lunch at that time plus smell of good food. Decided to take a walk back home, and had sparkling water once I reached home to curb hunger. Worked like a gem, was able to complete remaining work hours from home, then took a nap. Watched my favourite movie Interstellar to keep engaged at night and later on slept off, no issues with sleep.

Weight: 86.6kg
Steps: 11,718


Day 3: Woke up at 6AM, feeling energetic. Just 7 hours to go was my first thought. Coasted through it until 11AM (70 hours), last 2 hour I was impatient, but managed. Ended the fast with chicken soup and nuts.

Edmonton is a pretty liberal city.  And many places advertise as being LGBT accepting.  But that means as a gay guy in a gay tolerant bar, I still have a 90+ chance of hitting on a straight guy.  If only one guy in 10 is homophobic that means one punch and 8 rejections for each guy who is willing to have a beer with me.

1i1e21y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Interstitialcystitis/comments/1i1e21y/overwhelmed_by_what_to_try_next/,Overwhelmed by what to try next,"Hello community! This is my first post here. I (27f) got diagnosed with IC in 2021. I had a cystoscopy and a bladder hydrodistention. The procedure worked really well and I was pain and urgency free for about 2 years. My symptoms started coming back so in May 2024 I was put on Rupanase (rupatadine). About 2 weeks later I ended up in the emergency room for suspected appendicitis. After a CT scan and gastroscopy they discovered I had Gastroparesis which could have been caused by the Rupanase. After stopping the medication my gastroparesis went away. I then had another hydrodistention but my doctor said that he could barely stretch my bladder as my heart rate just went up too high‚Ä¶ he only managed to get to about 50%. 

I then saw a pelvic floor physiotherapist. She said that I have strong muscles but I am using them incorrectly. When I pee I tense up instead of relaxing. She tried this skin stretching thing all over my body which I believe calms the nervous system. Unfortunately it didn‚Äôt work. I didn‚Äôt continue with her as she was a little too focussed on a holistic perspective. I fully believe in a holistic approach but I needed more focussed attention on my bladder as I had a confirmed diagnosis and was not interested in talking to her about my mental health etc. 

So now I have found an amazing doctor - he is a urogynaecologist. He did a cystoscopy a few weeks ago and injected me with Botox. I ended up being hospitalised for 3 days because I was in so much pain from the procedure. We are now doing cystostat treatment. I had one in hospital and one last week. I have 3 more in the next 3 weeks. He said if that doesn‚Äôt work we need to consider a year of antibiotics as there is research that suggests that IC could be linked to a long term infection or a year of immunosuppressants. 

About me: I have endometriosis and have had surgery for it before. I am on visanne for treatment. I am a vegan and gluten intolerant so I have been hesitant to try an elimination diet to see if food affects my symptoms as my diet is already quite limited. I used to exercise a lot, mainly hot yoga and hiking. Now I struggle to go for a walk. My symptoms feel like they are not improving at all. For the past few weeks I have been taking Tumerynne (turmeric and cayenne pepper capsule) for inflammation. 

Next steps: there are so many medication names on this forum that I have never heard of and I don‚Äôt know where to begin. Do I try a histamine diet or inflammation diet? My doctor suggested both. (Btw water affects me way more than coffee and alcohol). I don‚Äôt know which vitamins or supplements to try first? I‚Äôm afraid to do antibiotics for a year as gut health is really important to me. 

It doesn‚Äôt feel like a flare up but rather just constant urgency, pain, and bloating.  So I don‚Äôt know if I am constantly triggering myself or if I just don‚Äôt know how to manage symptoms yet and therefore don‚Äôt get flares. Oh and to add - my doc did a biopsy in my last cystoscopy and he said that I had plenty of mast cells and do have quite a severe case of IC. 

SORRY FOR THE ESSAY. I‚Äôm feeling a little desperate and I‚Äôd rather ask for advice from a community of lived experiences than a bunch of male doctors. Thank you in advance ‚ù§Ô∏èü´∂",2,1736882494.0,Interstitialcystitis,0,1.0,False

1i1dw8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/1i1dw8i/its_completely_possible_to_do_nothing_wrong_yet/,It's completely possible to do nothing wrong yet still end up a mostly friendless social outcast during the MBA. I'm an example,"I'm a full time student at a top MBA program with a smaller class size. I'm in my 2nd year, with only a semester left.

Over the past 1.5 semesters, I have done my part in putting myself out there, getting to know people, having coffee chats, and trying to organize social events like hikes and potlucks. I try to smile upon seeing others and be friendly.

People know who I am. No one seems to have a ""negative"" impression of me. People are generally nice and smile and are cordial when greeting me at happy hours. But they talk for 30 seconds and then move on to someone else. They usually enthusiastically run up to others and hug them as opposed to being mildly polite to me.

I have been chill, going with the flow, and not thinking about things much, but the result has been that I'm socially unpopular. I'm virtually never invited to a birthday party, house party, or overnight trip. 

Even for things like class group projects, no one really picks me.

My suspicion is that people look at me and think I'm boring or not like them. I'm a bit of an overweight East Asian male (although I'm a US citizen) who looks a bit nerdy. I had zero fashion sense and just wore hoodies before. I was a former SWE before the MBA. I had no problem making friends with fellow nerds especially in my CS undergrad. But the MBA has been a huge culture shock. It has reminded me of high school, were I also really struggled socially.

Still, I didn't overthink it and just was casual about the experience but I still didn't make many friends.

I have tried going to the gym to lose weight but it's a struggle for me, no matter how hard I try, my stomach still has a bulge. My weight goes down but not my stomach. I tried lifting weights but my stomach is still there.

I grew up with very strict tiger parents who forced me to study academics and I didn't have an opportunity to organically develop social skills. As a result, my natural self is pretty quiet, and that probably makes it hard to connect to others.

My natural interests are also pretty nerdy - I love watching TV & movies, reading books, anime/manga, video games, etc. But I didn't advertise this during the MBA too much and tried skiing, hiking, and tennis but others haven't taken an interest to me.

The funny thing is that all of this had zero affect on my recruiting for roles. I got a Sr. PM internship at a good tech company which converted into a full time return offer. People talked to me and got along with me fine in my internship.

But I feel like I've completely failed my MBA social life. No one in my MBA likes my IG stories or posts. No one ln my MBA liked my LinkedIn announcement about getting my internship or job, it was all old co workers and friends. Whenever I posted in our class Slack or WhatsApp, almost no one acknowledges it. I often feel completely ignored on campus. It's very clear people think I'm ""uncool.""

In fact, the only people I really befriended were a few folks from other grad programs, like law or PhD. I briefly befriended some folks in first year when we did PM interview prep together, but after getting their internship, they shifted toward joining a more party-oriented social circle.

Can someone tell me what I did wrong, and if there's anything I can do to improve things? I don't need or want to be super popular or the life of the party. But I was hoping to make at least a few genuine friends that could hopefully become close lifelong friends. Many people have described our campus as being open and an easy place to befriend others, so it might be a ""me"" problem.

Again, I don't think I'm ""disliked"" or ""ostracized."" I just feel ignored. I think people just think I'm quiet, boring, uncool, or overly nerdy and not fun.",14,1736882092.0,MBA,34,0.73,False

Let's get the first round started with the couple who has finished in 4th place, in each of the first 5 weeks, but shockingly ended up in the Bottom 2 last week. Tonight they try and finally breakthrough with their Quickstep its Selena Gomez and her partner Val Chmerkovskiy!

**Selena Gomez and Val Quickstep**

**Song: ""I'll Be There For You"" by The Remembrants** 

Selena Gomez and Val Chmerkovskiy kick off Week 6 with an upbeat Quickstep to the iconic *Friends* theme. Val‚Äôs choreography pays homage to the playful, energetic vibe of the song while incorporating classic Quickstep elements such as sharp footwork, lively hops, and precise holds. The routine opens with Selena and Val sitting on a replica of the *Friends* Central Perk couch before springing into action with synchronized runs and quick-paced sequences. Selena brings a bubbly charm to the dance, fully embracing the spirited energy of the routine. Her footwork is much sharper than in previous weeks, and her frame remains mostly consistent, though there are brief moments when her shoulders creep up during the faster turns. Val adds clever nods to *Friends*, like a coffee cup prop moment and playful arm gestures that enhance the routine‚Äôs storytelling. By the end, Selena is beaming, and the audience erupts into cheers, celebrating a fun and technically improved performance.

**Carrie Ann Inaba:**  
""Selena, that was such a great way to start the night! You captured the spirit of the Quickstep and the joy of this iconic theme song. Your footwork was much cleaner, and I could see the effort in your frame. Just watch those shoulders‚Äîkeep them down during the faster sections‚Äîbut this was great!""

**Mel B:**  
""Oh my goodness, Selena, you were just radiating joy out there! I loved how you brought the fun and energy of *Friends* into your dance. You were bouncing around in the best way, and it made me smile the whole time. What a lovely performance to kick things off!""

**Derek Hough:**  
""Selena, this was a big step forward for you! The Quickstep is tough because it‚Äôs fast and technical, but you kept up with Val beautifully. I noticed the occasional lapse in your frame, but your footwork was much more precise tonight. Great storytelling, great energy‚Äîwell done!""

**Bruno Tonioli:**  
""Selena, darling, you were a ray of sunshine! The Quickstep has to feel like a champagne bubble, and you captured that bubbly lightness so well. Just refine those upper body details, and you‚Äôll keep climbing. You‚Äôre really growing, and I‚Äôm loving watching your journey!""

Great start for them! Next up, the couple who has dominated the fan vote this season. Our leading vote getter every week since Week 2 dancing a Contemporary routine is Bruno Mars and his partner Daniella Karagach!

**Bruno Mars and Daniella Contemporary**

**Song: ""I Don't Wanna Miss A Thing"" by Aerosmith**

Bruno Mars and Daniella Karagach deliver an emotional Contemporary routine that brings the crowd to their feet. Set to an iconic power ballad, Daniella‚Äôs choreography emphasizes raw storytelling, intricate lifts, and seamless transitions, all designed to highlight Bruno‚Äôs natural ability to connect with the music and the moment. The routine begins with Bruno and Daniella seated on opposite ends of the stage, reaching out toward each other as the song‚Äôs opening chords swell. From there, they launch into a series of powerful movements, including a breathtaking lift where Daniella spins midair before being gently lowered to the ground. Bruno‚Äôs musicality shines throughout the routine, his every step and gesture perfectly aligned with the song‚Äôs soaring crescendos. While Bruno‚Äôs technical lines aren‚Äôt as polished as some of the other competitors, his emotional commitment and connection to the story are undeniable, drawing the audience into the performance. The routine builds to a stunning conclusion with Daniella leaping into Bruno‚Äôs arms as the final note rings out, leaving the room in awe.

**Carrie Ann Inaba:**  
""Bruno, that was so beautiful and heartfelt. You have such a unique ability to draw people in with your performances, and tonight was no different. Your lifts were strong, and your connection to Daniella and the music was incredible. Just work on extending your lines to make every movement even more impactful, but overall, this was stunning.""

**Mel B:**  
""Wow, Bruno, I felt every bit of that! You made the song come alive, and your chemistry with Daniella is just magical. The choreography was beautiful, and it was so moving and genuine. That was fantastic!""

**Derek Hough:**  
""Bruno, you brought the emotion, and you brought the drama! Contemporary is about telling a story, and you told it beautifully. Your lifts were solid, and the musicality was spot on. Like Carrie Ann said, there‚Äôs room to refine your lines, but the storytelling was breathtaking. Amazing job!""

**Bruno Tonioli:**  
""Bruno, darling, that was a blockbuster performance! You poured your heart and soul into every move, and I was completely captivated. I thought your technique was fantastic and I thought your lines were perfect for the kind of routine you did tonight at least in my opinion. The way you connected with Daniella and the music‚Äîit was pure magic. Brilliant work!""

**Scores: 9, 10, 9, 10 (38/40)**

Two 10s for Bruno and Daniella!!! Next up with an Argentine Tango to this NSYNC hit, the comedian who's entertained us every single week and look to do so again tonight, it's Kenan Thompson and his partner Britt Stewart!

**Kenan Thompson and Britt Argentine Tango**

**Song: ""I Want You Back"" by NSYNC**

Kenan Thompson and Britt Stewart bring a playful, crowd-pleasing twist to the Argentine Tango, blending the intensity of the dance with Kenan‚Äôs signature humor and the infectious energy of *NSYNC*. Britt‚Äôs choreography leans into Kenan‚Äôs strengths, incorporating traditional Argentine Tango elements‚Äîsharp leg flicks, dramatic dips, and controlled holds‚Äîwhile adding cheeky nods to classic boy band moves for a fun and fresh spin. Kenan enters the floor with a confident smirk, immediately drawing laughs with a quick, *NSYNC*\-inspired pose before launching into the routine. His posture is solid, and he leads Britt through synchronized kicks and dramatic staccato steps with an exaggerated flair that keeps the audience smiling. The highlight comes when Kenan seamlessly transitions into a lift, spinning Britt with a comedic flourish that adds just the right amount of personality. Throughout the performance, Kenan's commitment to the music and his chemistry with Britt shine, as they cleverly mix sharp Argentine Tango technique with moments of playful charm. While his foot placement isn‚Äôt always perfect and some transitions are a bit bumpy, the energy and entertainment value make it a standout routine. The routine ends with Kenan hilariously striking a final boy band pose, earning a standing ovation from the crowd.

**Carrie Ann Inaba:**  
""Kenan, that was such a fun take on the Argentine Tango! You managed to keep the essence of the dance while bringing your unique flair and humor. The lifts were great, and I loved how much fun you were having out there. Keep refining those transitions, but what a joy to watch!""

**Mel B:**  
""Kenan, you are such a performer! Mixing *NSYNC* moves with the Tango? Genius! You owned the floor, made us laugh, and still managed to nail some tricky footwork. You‚Äôre what this show is all about‚Äîhaving fun while getting better every week!""

**Derek Hough:**  
""Kenan, that was the most entertaining Argentine Tango I‚Äôve ever seen! Britt, you crafted such a clever routine, and Kenan, you committed 100%. Your leading was strong, and that boy band flair? Perfect touch. Just keep working on the finer details, but well done!""

**Bruno Tonioli:**  
""Kenan, darling, you‚Äôre the showman of the season! That was the first Argentine Tango that had me laughing in the best way possible. You hit all the beats, brought the drama and the fun, and those poses? Brilliant. Work on keeping those movements smooth, but I loved every second!""

**Scores: 8, 8, 8, 8 (32/40)**

Next up the couple who earned the highest score of the season so far, with a Jazz routine to this Madonna classic. It's Addison Rae and her partner Pasha Pashkov!

**Addison Rae and Pasha Jazz**

**Song: ""Vogue"" by Madonna**

Addison Rae and Pasha Pashkov take the ballroom by storm with a Jazz routine that perfectly channels the iconic energy of Madonna‚Äôs *Vogue*. From the moment they step onto the floor, the performance oozes sophistication and star power. Pasha‚Äôs choreography cleverly combines sharp Jazz technique with the iconic poses and stylized movements that defined Madonna‚Äôs hit, creating a routine that is both technically demanding and undeniably entertaining. Addison‚Äôs movements are precise and deliberate, with sharp lines and crisp angles as she effortlessly transitions between classic Jazz steps and the dramatic, angular ""vogueing"" moments. Her confidence shines throughout, as she hits every accent with flair and maintains a commanding stage presence. Pasha‚Äôs choreography highlights their strong partnership, with intricate side-by-side sections and well-timed interactions that feel seamless. A standout moment comes when Addison strikes a series of iconic poses in perfect sync with the music‚Äôs beat, receiving loud cheers from the crowd. While the routine leans heavily into theatricality, Addison‚Äôs technique holds up, with clean turns, strong extensions, and controlled transitions. The performance builds to a dramatic final pose, with Addison front and center, commanding the ballroom like a true pop icon.

**Carrie Ann Inaba:**  
""Addison, that was absolutely fabulous! You didn‚Äôt just dance‚Äîyou *performed*. Every pose, every move, every moment was on point. You captured the essence of *Vogue* while keeping the technique strong. I think you‚Äôve found your groove, and it‚Äôs exciting to watch!""

**Mel B:**  
""Addison, that was SPICEY! You embodied the energy and sass of Madonna perfectly. You owned that floor and delivered a performance worthy of the queen herself. The poses, the confidence‚Äîit was all there. Girl, you‚Äôre unstoppable!""

**Derek Hough:**  
""Addison, this routine was a masterclass in precision and stage presence. Pasha, the choreography was incredible, and Addison, you executed it with style and control. Those poses were iconic, and your transitions were seamless. You‚Äôre really stepping into your own as a performer‚Äîwell done!""

**Bruno Tonioli:**  
""Darling, you *vogue‚Äôd* your way into ballroom history! That was a celebration of style, attitude, and precision. Every movement had intent, every pose was perfection. You gave us drama, flair, and technical brilliance. A true Madonna moment in the ballroom!""

**Scores: 10, 10, 10, 10 (40/40)**

THE FIRST PERFECT SCORE OF THE SEASON!!! Next up with a Tango, our gymnast who had their potential breakthrough moment finishing in 3rd in the Swing Dance Marathon. Can they translate that momentum into their tango? It's Livvy Dunne and her partner Alan Bersten!

**Livvy Dunne and Alan Tango**

**Song: ""Are You Gonna Go My Way"" by Lenny Kravitz**

Livvy Dunne and Alan Bersten bring energy and drama to the ballroom with a Tango set to the gritty rock beats of Lenny Kravitz‚Äôs *""Are You Gonna Go My Way""*. Alan‚Äôs choreography leans heavily into sharp, traditional Tango movements with dramatic shaping and quick, deliberate footwork, perfectly paired with the song‚Äôs edgy vibe. Livvy attacks the routine with intensity, maintaining a strong frame and hitting most of the staccato movements with precision. Her footwork is clean through much of the performance, though there are moments where her sharpness in the leg flicks and pivots could use more refinement to match the dance's full power. The partnership with Alan is solid, with Livvy showing improved control and focus. The routine‚Äôs highlight comes during a bold series of syncopated turns and sharp head snaps, which Livvy executes with confidence. However, her transitions between sections lack the seamless flow needed to fully elevate the performance. Still, the overall effect is dynamic and engaging, with a dramatic ending pose earning cheers from the audience.

**Carrie Ann Inaba:**  
""Livvy, this was a strong and fierce Tango! Your energy and focus were spot on, and you‚Äôve clearly been working hard on your frame. Some of the leg flicks could have been a little sharper, but this was a great effort.""

**Mel B:**  
""Livvy, you brought the fire tonight! I loved the attitude you brought to this performance‚Äîit felt like a proper rock show. Some technical things could use a bit more polish, but overall, this was a fantastic Tango. You‚Äôre definitely stepping up your game!""

**Derek Hough:**  
""Livvy, that was a powerful Tango! Your footwork was clean, and your frame is improving every week. Just make sure to really finish those movements with sharpness and confidence‚Äîthey were good but could be even better. Great job overall!""

**Bruno Tonioli:**  
""Darling, you‚Äôve got the intensity, and it‚Äôs starting to shine through in your technique. The Tango is all about control and precision, and while some parts needed a touch more refinement, you are growing so much as a dancer. Keep it up!""

**Scores: 8, 8, 8, 9 (33/40)**

Next up with a Waltz, the couple who has consistently landed in the middle of the pack, but the fewer couples we have remaining the less room for error there is. Can they breakout tonight? It's Heidi Klum and her partner Keo Motsepe!

**Heidi Klum and Keo Waltz**

**Song: ""Iris"" by The Goo Goo Dolls**

Heidi Klum and Keo Motsepe take the floor with an elegant and emotionally charged Waltz to the hauntingly beautiful *""Iris""* by the Goo Goo Dolls. Keo‚Äôs choreography embraces the fluidity and grace of the Waltz, incorporating sweeping movements, smooth rise-and-fall technique, and emotive storytelling that pairs perfectly with the heartfelt lyrics of the song. Heidi glides across the floor with poise and grace, her long lines and improved posture giving the routine a refined look. Her frame is stronger than in previous weeks, and her connection with Keo creates an emotional depth that resonates with the audience. However, her transitions between turns and pivots occasionally lack the fluidity expected in a Waltz of this caliber, and her foot placement falters slightly during one of the more intricate sections. Despite these minor technical flaws, Heidi‚Äôs ability to embody the emotional core of the routine shines through, leaving the audience captivated by the storytelling. The final sweeping turn into an elegant pose is met with cheers from the crowd.

**Carrie Ann Inaba:**  
""Heidi, you brought such a beautiful, emotional quality to this Waltz. Your frame has improved tremendously, and I felt the connection between you and Keo. Just work on making those transitions between steps a bit smoother, but overall, this was lovely.""

**Mel B:**  
""Heidi my girl I'm so proud of you watching you this season! I know how much you have always wanted to do this show and I've loved watching you do it. You were like a fairy on that floor‚Äîso graceful and elegant! I loved how you told the story through your movements. I truly think you stepped up tonight and had your best dance.""

**Derek Hough:**  
""Heidi, this was your most polished performance yet! The rise and fall were gorgeous, and your arms extended beautifully. There‚Äôs still a little work to be done on those transitions, but you‚Äôve come so far. Well done!""

**Bruno Tonioli:**  
""Darling, you were like a dream floating across the floor! That Waltz had elegance, style, and emotional depth. Just watch those transitions‚Äîthey need to flow as effortlessly as the rest of the routine. But honestly, this was a wonderful performance.""

**Scores: 8, 9, 9, 8 (34/40)**

Their first 9s of the season!! Next up dancing Jazz, the couple who look to regain the top spot with the judges after falling out of first the last two weeks. It's Sabrina Carpenter and her partner Brandon Armstrong!

**Sabrina Carpenter and Brandon Jazz**

**Song: ""California Love"" by Tupac**

Sabrina Carpenter and Brandon Armstrong hit the floor with a powerful Jazz routine set to Tupac‚Äôs iconic *""California Love.""* Brandon‚Äôs choreography perfectly blends classic Jazz techniques with a street-style edge, paying homage to the West Coast vibe of the song. The routine is packed with sharp isolations, intricate footwork, and high-energy synchronization that captures the essence of the track. Sabrina exudes confidence as she delivers every move with precision and swag. Her musicality shines as she hits every beat with razor-sharp timing, seamlessly transitioning between fast-paced, intricate steps and smooth, stylized movements. The routine also features dynamic partner work, with Sabrina effortlessly executing a series of creative lifts and tricks, demonstrating her trust in Brandon and her growing versatility as a performer. The standout moment comes during a synchronized freestyle section where Sabrina and Brandon nail a sequence of popping and locking movements, bringing the crowd to their feet. While her performance is nearly flawless, her shoulders were a little stiff at times which goes unnoticed by most but is caught by one judge.

**Carrie Ann Inaba:**  
""Sabrina, I am speechless! That was absolutely phenomenal! You brought the swagger, the energy, and the attitude that this routine demanded, and you didn‚Äôt miss a beat. Every move was sharp, your musicality was insane, and Brandon‚Äôs choreography was just out of this world. This was your best performance yet!""

**Mel B:**  
""Girl, that was EVERYTHING! You brought the heat, the sass, and the full-on star power to that performance. The way you commanded the stage was incredible. Your energy never dropped for a second, and I was completely hooked from start to finish. You‚Äôre unstoppable!""

**Derek Hough:**  
""Sabrina, that was a masterclass in Jazz! You absolutely owned the stage tonight. Every detail, every accent, every step was nailed with precision and confidence. Brandon gave you such a tough routine, and you executed it like a pro. Honestly, this is the kind of performance that sets the standard for the entire competition. Amazing!""

**Bruno Tonioli:**  
""Sabrina, darling, you were electrifying! That routine was bold, dynamic, and pure fire. Your timing, your presence, your commitment‚Äîbrilliant! But‚Äîand it‚Äôs a tiny but‚Äîthere were moments where your shoulders were slightly stiff in the isolations, which took away a bit of the fluidity (LOUD BOOS). I have to be fair and I saw it darling!!! Still, an absolutely stunning performance!""

**Scores: 10, 10, 10, 9 (39/40)**

Not quite a perfect score but still amazing!! Closing out the first round with a Rumba, the couple who found themselves in the Bottom 3 last week looking to rebound tonight. It's Jennifer Lawrence and her partner Mark Ballas!

**Jennifer Lawrence and Mark Rumba**

**Song: ""Everything I Do (I Do It For You) by Bryan Adams**

Jennifer Lawrence and Mark Ballas close out the first round with a romantic and heartfelt Rumba, bringing the emotional depth of Bryan Adams‚Äô classic ballad to life. Mark‚Äôs choreography emphasizes the sensual and smooth qualities of the Rumba, incorporating fluid hip movements, elongated lines, and seamless transitions. Jennifer steps into the dance with vulnerability, creating an emotional connection to both the music and her partner. Her arm extensions are graceful, and she showcases improved fluidity in her movements compared to earlier weeks. However, while Jennifer‚Äôs emotional delivery is captivating, there are moments where her hip action lacks the pronounced figure-eight motion typical of the Rumba. Additionally, her foot placement in certain sections could use more precision to enhance the overall flow of the routine. Despite these technical challenges, the storytelling and chemistry between Jennifer and Mark leave a strong impression, earning applause from the audience.

**Carrie Ann Inaba:**  
""Jennifer, that was beautiful! You brought so much emotion and sincerity to this Rumba, and it really touched my heart. Your lines were stunning, and the chemistry between you and Mark was undeniable. Keep focusing on refining those hips, but this was a wonderful way to end the first round.""

**Mel B:**  
""Oh my gosh, Jennifer, that was just gorgeous! You told a story with every single movement, and I could feel the emotion in every step. I loved how vulnerable and connected you were‚Äîit made the dance so much more impactful. Just a little more confidence in your hips, and you‚Äôll be unstoppable.""

**Derek Hough:**  
""Jennifer, this was such a tender and emotional Rumba. You‚Äôve made so much progress, and tonight you really brought the vulnerability that this dance demands. Your arms and lines were beautiful, and I love how you leaned into the storytelling. Keep working on that hip action and the finer technical details, but overall, this was a lovely performance.""

**Bruno Tonioli:**  
""Jennifer, darling, you poured your heart and soul into that Rumba, and it showed! The emotional connection was exquisite, and your partnership with Mark is so strong. I agree with the others‚Äîthose hips need a bit more definition to bring out the full flavor of the dance, but this was a very moving performance to close the night.""

**Scores: 9, 9, 8, 8 (34/40)**

**Sabrina and Brandon vs Addison and Pasha Cha Cha**

**Song: ""Everybody Dance Now"" by C+C Music Factory**

**Addison and Pasha:**  
Addison commands attention from the first beat, exuding confidence with razor-sharp arm styling and crisp Cha Cha steps. Pasha‚Äôs choreography leans into Addison‚Äôs natural rhythm, incorporating intricate syncopations and dynamic hip movements that perfectly match the beat of the song. Their side-by-side sequences are in perfect sync, with Addison‚Äôs precision shining through, especially during a series of rapid-fire spins. The chemistry between the two is undeniable, and their vibrant energy draws the eye, even when Sabrina and Brandon are in frame.

**Sabrina and Brandon:**  
Sabrina takes a more flirty and playful approach, radiating charisma as she interacts with Brandon and the audience. Brandon‚Äôs choreography showcases classic Cha Cha content, including sharp turns, elegant lines, and precise hip action. Sabrina‚Äôs timing is impeccable, and her transitions between intricate footwork and bold arm styling are seamless.

**Carrie Ann Inaba:**

**Bruno and Daniella vs Livvy and Alan Jive**

**Song: ""I'm a Believer"" by Smash Mouth**

**Bruno and Daniella**:   
Right out of the gate, Bruno and Daniella showcase their signature synchronization and sharp footwork. Their kicks and flicks are precise, and they radiate charisma, keeping the energy high. Daniella‚Äôs choreography emphasizes Bruno‚Äôs natural rhythm and stage presence, incorporating a playful series of side-by-side steps and quick spins that captivate the audience. Their transitions are seamless, and their musicality is spot-on, but their routine feels more grounded and polished rather than adventurous.

**Livvy and Alan**:   
Livvy and Alan take a bolder approach, using her gymnastic background to incorporate daring tricks and dynamic lifts. Livvy‚Äôs athleticism shines as she effortlessly executes high-energy kicks and jumps. Their routine is packed with personality and show-stopping moments, and while it might not be as clean in execution as Bruno and Daniella‚Äôs, their innovative tricks and Livvy‚Äôs infectious enthusiasm keep them in the spotlight.

""Wow, this was such a fun duel to watch! Bruno, you are such a natural entertainer, and your connection with Daniella is unmatched. Your movements were sharp and polished.

**Selena & Val:**  
Selena and Val‚Äôs choreography leans into precision and rhythm, with sharp kicks, flicks, and perfect synchronization. Val keeps the routine polished yet playful, showcasing Selena‚Äôs technical improvement and ability to connect with the audience. Selena shines with her clean footwork and a radiant smile, embodying the song‚Äôs fun energy. A side-by-side section filled with mirrored kicks and spins shows their chemistry and precision, and their transitions between moves are seamless.

**Kenan & Britt:**  
Kenan and Britt opt for a comedic, larger-than-life approach that highlights Kenan‚Äôs charisma. Britt uses clever choreography, including exaggerated expressions and humorous pauses, to lean into the song‚Äôs nostalgia. Their kicks are slightly less precise than Selena and Val‚Äôs but make up for it with personality. Kenan throws in a hilarious ‚ÄúCarlton dance‚Äù reference mid-routine, sending the audience into hysterics. Their energy is infectious, and their showmanship is undeniable.

**Carrie Ann Inaba:**  
""This was such a fun duel! Selena and Val, your technique and sharpness were so impressive‚Äîyour footwork is getting so much stronger, Selena. And Kenan and Britt, oh my gosh, you two are just pure joy to watch! The comedic timing, the energy‚Äîfantastic job from both couples!""

**Mel B:**  
""Selena, girl, you‚Äôve got some serious moves‚Äîthose kicks were on point! And Kenan, you had me laughing the entire time while still nailing the vibe of the dance. Both of you really brought the Fresh Prince spirit to life!""

**Derek Hough:**

**Song: ""Ice Ice Baby"" by Vanilla Ice**

**Jennifer & Mark:**  
Jennifer and Mark‚Äôs Cha Cha focuses on theatricality, with Jennifer leaning into the playful vibe of the song. Mark‚Äôs choreography is cheeky and dynamic, incorporating exaggerated hip action and fun arm movements that play to Jennifer‚Äôs personality. While her technique isn‚Äôt as sharp as Heidi‚Äôs, her connection with Mark and the song keeps the audience engaged. A standout moment comes when Jennifer strikes a dramatic freeze mid-routine, perfectly timed with the lyrics, before seamlessly transitioning back into the Cha Cha rhythm.

**Heidi & Keo:**  
Heidi and Keo take a more traditional approach, focusing on precision and clean lines. Keo‚Äôs choreography emphasizes classic Cha Cha steps with tight spins, crisp arm placements, and elegant hip movements. Heidi shows significant improvement in her footwork and keeps up with the fast pace of the routine. Their chemistry shines as they move confidently across the floor, nailing the timing and bringing a polished performance to the duel.

**Carrie Ann Inaba:**  
""Wow, what a duel to close out the night! Jennifer and Mark, you were so much fun to watch‚Äîyou captured the humor and energy of the song perfectly. Heidi and Keo, your technique was so clean, and Heidi, you‚Äôre really stepping up your game. Great job to both pairs!""

This may seem like a dumb question but I cannot decide at all. We‚Äôve never had any animosity towards each other and have stayed as friends, albeit ones that don‚Äôt talk to each other anymore. Since breaking up I‚Äôve realized what else I could‚Äôve done in the relationship, the love was there but there was plenty that I didn‚Äôt do or was bad at. The first time we saw each other after breaking up she joined me for a concert which afterward I may pushed things and read her a letter I wrote but she ended up saying it was the nicest thing anyone‚Äôs ever said to her. Just to show you there‚Äôs no ill-will with us. 
For context: she was my first girlfriend, really first everything, we broke up in March of 23 (she broke up with me) but since then we‚Äôve seen each other twice and have kept in touch via snap or text off and on more than a few times. It was pretty much always her (besides one time, the first time I saw her after breaking up) that would initiate the convos after we haven‚Äôt been talking for a while. 

Our last interaction started last May where she messaged me out of nowhere asking me to come to her college graduation. She said things like she really wants to talk but know she doesn‚Äôt deserve to. Looking back I was probably a little too quick to agree but I tried my best in that time to not sound so eager about going. As the time was coming up she would say things like how excited she was about the weekend and just things in my eyes that made it seem like good things could come out of this visit. But then the week of graduation came around and I‚Äôd ask if she was really sure about me coming up and then the weekend came and she pushed me coming back a day due to her family being there. I never ended up going. I questioned why and the answer I got imo was pretty pathetic. She said that she was drunk and in her feels when she first messaged me about coming but then decided to snap me for almost a month until your graduation and then say multiple times you‚Äôre excited?? I asked her why she couldn‚Äôt say that like the next day or shortly after asking me and I didn‚Äôt get a good answer on. That kind of left a sour taste in my mouth but I didn‚Äôt want to get upset so I just told her she could‚Äôve said that if it was the case instead of pretty much leading me on. We ended up stopping snapping shortly after and that was the last I‚Äôve spoken to her.  

I may have hoped but I didn‚Äôt think meeting up with her would get us back together as both of our personal plans were to move states at the end of summer. Which I did but she did not. Being across the country from home has helped me be more appreciative of the people in my life which is part of the reason I want to reach out to her and I think her bday is a good opportunity. I just want to tell her I still appreciate her in my life even though she‚Äôs not really in my life anymore. She has a new boyfriend though which is kinda making me think I should just leave her alone. But we‚Äôve always said we‚Äôll remain friends. I was gonna ask if she wanted to meet up for coffee when I‚Äôm back in her state but now that she has a bf I don‚Äôt think that is smart or would happen. Although I may ask and just claim I didn‚Äôt know about the bf.  And it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm going to pour my heart out to her. Just happy birthday and tell her I still appreciate her. Idk what to do, I still care about her. 

Long ass jumbled post for just wondering if I tell her hbd. Looks stupid on paper but it‚Äôs not an easy decision for me. Ask any questions below or in my dms, thanks.

I don't know how it got to this.  

I fell in love with you instantly over bad coffee on our first date. Maybe even before then when we first started talking. I never in a million years would have guessed I would have connected with a girl as wonderful and smart, and funny, and charming, and beautiful, and kind as you on an app like Tinder.  We made plans for our dogs to meet.  We fell hard and fast. The first time we kissed I knew I was in love with you. The first time we made love we were a perfect fit.  Holding you in my arms while we watched bad horror movies put my soul at ease.

Somewhere along the way, one (or both) of us got cold feet. We stopped talking abruptly and neither of us had the courage to pierce the silence. When I finally did we no longer trusted each other. You blocked me after that, then unblocked me. I was hurt and upset, and then I blocked you... Or maybe I was embarrassed when you read what I wrote when I thought you'd never see it.  Regardless, I regret that I did, and now I've lost you forever. 

I want so badly just to show up at your house, to bring Oscar to meet Oreo like we planned, to hold you in my arms again and kiss you... But I'm trying to respect the boundaries we've so clearly established for one another... Either out of anger, or sadness, or embarrassment, or maybe just what fate has decided what we deserve. So, instead I'll write what I want to say here, and scream it into the void. I know I did that once already... The void is a terrible listener though.  My soul feels broken without you, J. I know that even if we never speak or see each other again, you will always be the girl I believe I was meant to be with. My heart and my soul are broken without you.

Yours forever and always,

Just like most of us, I started understanding a little bit more about coffee thanks to James Hoffmann, who opened the rabbit hole and guided me into it. Of course, he still guides me, together with this subreddit, lance hedrick, and other blogs and sources. 

But who is James Hoffmann? I mean, I know he won 2007 barista world championship, but there's been many other world champion. 

Still, it seems like there's a before James Hoffmann and an after James Hoffmann

Why is that so? I looked into it a bit and I think I understand he is the most important third wave exponent, but I didn't find why exactly is that so, what's his story (other than 2007) and many other details about his career

So I guess my question is: who is James Hoffmann? Why is he considered to be one of, if not the, leasing experts?

1i1dkw9,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1i1dkw9/ms_nobodys_business/,[MS] Nobody's Business ,"By my third cup of coffee, I started wondering if a car would even stop here tonight. By the fourth, I was genuinely worried. I was sitting at the counter in a truck stop, a mile or so from the interchange. I needed to head south, but most folks were going east. The truck stop itself was a no-name place. A little run-down, but they served soup, and the coffee was hot.

The problem was the snowstorm. An icy north wind swept straight across Lake Michigan, bringing snow, freezing rain, and temperatures in the low teens. The weather channel on one of the screens above the counter said it wasn‚Äôt going to get better anytime soon.

The owner stood behind the counter, killing time. Somewhere in the back, a woman was working‚Äîprobably his wife. I was alone, like always. My one shot at a ride had just left. Some guy headed to Chicago. Wrong direction.

Then the door swung open. A woman stepped inside, followed by a blast of frigid air. I shivered. She wore gloves, a thick old parka, and lined pants fraying at the hems. A layer of snow dusted her shoulders. She looked worn out. I glanced outside, but in the dark, I couldn‚Äôt spot her car. She scanned the room briefly, then took a seat at a table by the window. Stupid move, I thought. Warmer to sit away from the glass.

The owner came over with the coffee pot, but she waved him off. She just sat there, staring at her gloves.

I slid off my stool and walked toward her.

‚ÄúExcuse me,‚Äù I said. She didn‚Äôt look up. ‚ÄúMy name‚Äôs Samantha. I‚Äôm trying to get south. Any chance you‚Äôre heading that way and could give me a ride?‚Äù

The woman stared at me, her expression blank. My hair was in a messy bun, my clothes didn‚Äôt smell exactly fresh, and my shoes were caked in mud.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she mumbled eventually, then looked away. ‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù she added to her gloves. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt live far from here. I‚Äôm heading back soon. I can‚Äôt help you.‚Äù

Shit, I thought. I wandered back to the counter. Time dragged on without much happening. I was done with the coffee.

I studied the woman. She just sat there. A small puddle of melted snow had formed under her chair. She muttered something to herself. Fighting with someone at home, I figured. Drove off into the night to let things cool down. Literally and figuratively.

I waited.

Ten minutes passed before the door opened again. This time, a big guy walked in. Big and heavy. Broad arms, massive torso, a scraggly beard. A Viking. Or maybe a grizzly bear. Behind him came a second guy, a shadow of the first. Small and wiry, with a nervous twitch in one eye. They both wore the same uniform: black pants, black turtlenecks, and black jackets. Winter gear, but not built for January in Illinois.

The men scanned the room. They ignored the owner and looked straight at me. The big guy nudged the smaller one and grinned. I‚Äôd seen that look before, but I didn‚Äôt have many options. Spending the night here wasn‚Äôt one of them.

‚ÄúYou headed south?‚Äù I asked from my stool. ‚ÄúI could use a ride.‚Äù

The big guy lumbered toward me. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going south, sweetheart,‚Äù he said, still grinning. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôd be happy to give you a ride.‚Äù He stopped close, his chest just a few inches from my face.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù I answered, lacing my words with sarcasm. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not going down, you‚Äôre not worth my time.‚Äù

His grin dropped, replaced by a hard glare. He stepped even closer, but the little guy tugged his arm and pointed toward the woman at the table. Without another word, the big guy turned and stomped her way. The smaller one swatted my empty coffee cup off the counter like a bratty kid before following him.

They went to the woman‚Äôs table and sat down on either side of her. She didn‚Äôt look surprised. If anything, she looked relieved. I took another look at her shabby clothes and dark circles. Maybe there wasn‚Äôt a husband at home after all. Maybe she sold bootleg moonshine to jerks from the city to make ends meet.

They were talking about something, but I couldn‚Äôt hear what. It didn‚Äôt last long. A few minutes later, the three of them stood up and headed for the door. Whatever they were planning, it wasn‚Äôt meant for fluorescent lighting.

The big guy caught me staring, cupped a hand over his crotch, and made a jerking motion before disappearing into the night.

I stared at my reflection in the window. *Not your problem, Samantha,* I told myself. *Stay put. Let it go.* But the image of that woman stuck with me. Two guys like that‚Ä¶ this wasn‚Äôt going to end well.

My fingers brushed the edge of my backpack. I‚Äôd regret it if I didn‚Äôt do something‚ÄîI already knew that much.

I let out a long sigh, pulled my bushcraft knife from the side pocket, and slid it into my coat. A bad idea, but some things you just do.

The icy night air caught me off guard. I‚Äôd been sitting inside for hours. The wind bit through my jacket, making me shiver, and thick snowflakes clung to my hair almost instantly. I flipped up my collar and scanned the parking lot. Out past the reach of the halogen lights, two trucks were parked. An old, battered Chevy Silverado and a shiny, new Ford Raptor. They sat apart, with three figures standing in the no man‚Äôs land between them.

I crept closer. They were arguing. The Viking‚Äôs booming voice carried over the howling wind. The woman sounded frantic. Then the big guy stepped forward and slapped her across the face. Hard. She hit the ground with a thud. The smaller guy just stood there, grinning.

The woman scrambled to her feet, but the big guy kicked her in the backside, shouting something I couldn‚Äôt make out. She bolted toward her truck, sobbing.

‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù I asked quietly. She flinched, startled‚ÄîI‚Äôd blended into the dark. Her lip was split, blood smeared across her chin, and a bruise was already forming around her eye.

‚ÄúYou need to leave,‚Äù she hissed. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get involved. This is just how it works around here.‚Äù

*Too late for that,* I thought.

I said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go back inside. Maybe they‚Äôve got bandages or something.‚Äù

But she shook her head. ‚ÄúI need to get home.‚Äù She climbed into her truck, paused to look at me through the glass, then started the engine and drove off into the night.

A sensible girl would‚Äôve gone back inside, ignored the situation, and waited for a ride out of here as soon as possible. Instead, I slipped into the treeline at the edge of the rest stop. The two men stood staring at the fading taillights of the woman‚Äôs car as it slid its way toward the interstate. Their breath puffed into visible clouds. The smaller guy was hopping in place to keep warm. Then, suddenly, he turned and started walking toward me.

He was going to take a piss. He walked into the woods, passing less than ten feet from me, without noticing I was there. I was invisible. I crept after him, silent as a shadow. The snow muffled everything. The man kept going deeper into the woods, maybe self-conscious about peeing in public. I glanced back. The rest stop had disappeared into the darkness.

The man staggered over the snow and hidden branches until he reached a tree. He unzipped his pants, and I heard the stream hit the ground. I needed answers, and fast. The plan was simple: hit him hard in the neck, right where head meets spine. It‚Äôs a good way to loosen someone up for a chat. Where I grew up, things didn‚Äôt always play by the rules.

I ghosted up behind him and launched an elbow at the base of his skull. But the guy must‚Äôve had a sixth sense. He turned, mid-stream, and his jaw collided with my elbow halfway through his spin. I felt something crack, but my immediate concern was his piss splattering all over my pants and boots.

He cried out, clutching his face. His eyes watered from the pain, but he recognized me instantly.

‚ÄúYou!‚Äù he slurred, the rest of his words garbled by choking and groaning. He couldn‚Äôt talk anymore.

*Shit.*

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on here?‚Äù I barked. ‚ÄúWhat were you planning with that woman?‚Äù

The man wobbled, barely able to stay upright. He was in bad shape. His hand groped behind his back, and I thought he was looking for something to steady himself. But then he pulled out a revolver.

*Shit, shit, shit!*

Panicked, I clenched my fist and landed a cigarette punch right on his broken jaw. He went down, but not before the gun fired. The shot buried itself in the ground less than a foot from my boots, kicking up a spray of snow.

The man lay flat on his back, dazed and in agony. He was no good to me like this. I dropped onto his chest, forcing the air from his lungs. Then I drove my knee into his throat, pressing down just enough to cut off his oxygen. I held it there until his eyes rolled back and he passed out.

That‚Äôs when I heard the Viking shout.

I guessed I had about two minutes before the big guy would come looking for his buddy. Quickly, I searched the man's pockets. I found a phone, a wallet, and a set of car keys. The phone was locked with a passcode. Inside the wallet were a hundred dollars, which I slipped into my pocket, and the man‚Äôs driver‚Äôs license. It was registered in St. Louis, Missouri. The car keys had a Ford logo, which I pocketed as well. Then I crawled away.

The big man‚Äôs shouts sounded closer now, but I couldn‚Äôt see him. It was pitch-black. I crouched behind some underbrush and clenched my jaw tightly shut. I didn‚Äôt want him to hear my teeth chattering. I was freezing. I gripped my knife. Taking the giant down with just a couple of hits was out of the question.

The man‚Äôs heavy footsteps crunched closer in the snow. I only saw him when he planted his boots in the snow right in front of my face. I held my breath. He didn‚Äôt see me. He muttered a curse under his breath. His beard was dusted with snow. He stumbled. I noticed now that his ankle was hurting. Maybe he‚Äôd tripped and injured himself. He rubbed his arms in a feeble attempt to stay warm and clumsily made his way through the snow. He looked uneasy. Unfamiliar terrain, the cold. That‚Äôs when I realized: the man was scared. He‚Äôd lost his buddy, and without him, he wasn‚Äôt getting out of here. Especially not with his car keys buried deep in my pocket.

I watched him go. He was heading in the wrong direction. At this rate, he‚Äôd miss his friend by ten yards and eventually end up in Indiana. I let him go.

The darkness in the dense woods was disorienting. The wind and snow had erased my footprints. I was glad I could rely on my wilderness experience and wondered how the big guy would fare. Eventually, I found my way back to the parking lot. It was still deserted. The Ford Raptor sat alone in the shadow, covered by a thick layer of snow.

Curious, I peered through the window. There was something on the passenger seat. I opened the door with the keys from the guy with the broken jaw. On the seat lay a stack of bills. Recently withdrawn. At least five hundred dollars. On the ground was a paper bag. Its contents surprised me. There were injection pens inside. Insulin, I deduced from the label. Straight from the hospital in Saint-Louis.

I thought of the old clothes and the old junker the woman had been driving, and then looked at the brand-new Ford Raptor and the insulin pens. The story started to make sense. I had been completely wrong at first. ""I have to go home,"" the woman had said. No doubt to a man or child who would have to survive the next month without their medicine. Suddenly, I regretted not stringing those two idiots up on my knife. I grabbed my knife and slashed all the Ford's tires. I shoved my hand in my sleeve and smashed the windows with the butt of the knife. I didn't know if the big guy would come back, but I didn't want him to have a shelter. I tossed the keys into the woods. I left the money; I didn‚Äôt want it.

I walked back to the truck stop. The owner was behind the counter again, nodding at me. I nodded back and took my place again. He placed a cup of coffee in front of me. Ten minutes later, the bar‚Äôs windows lit up as an 18-wheeler hissed and rumbled to a stop. A minute later, a cheerful trucker with a big beer belly walked in. He was heading to Nashville and offered me a ride if I wanted to go. Another ten minutes later, I was sitting comfortably in the warm cab of the truck, and we approached the interchange. We merged, took the exit, and headed south.",1,1736881323.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I hadn't seen Terry since before the new year and all of my efforts to reach out had been fruitless. I also hadn't seen Jeff since the night that card had been delivered. I had been trying to focus on my work, but just last week, made another mistake and finally got fired. That devastated me, and I realized that there was a real possibility of either moving back in with my parents at nearly forty one years old or being completely homeless. I did consider sleeping in my car as I began to pack my belongings, informing my landlord that I would be vacating at the end of the month.

The day after I got fired I was still busy packing and then transporting things over to my parents' house for storage, lugging the heavier cartons down into the basement with my father's help, and the lighter ones into my childhood bedroom.

‚ÄúYou know you can come back here, right?‚Äù he asked as we grabbed the last boxes full of books.

‚ÄúI'm going to try to avoid it. I am going to start looking for a new job on Monday. I am okay financially for now.‚Äù I lied.

The fact was, since my husband left I had fallen further and further behind on bills. I don't know if it was pride, or pure embarrassment, but I couldn't admit that to the man who had raised me. I had a feeling he knew that I was being dishonest, but I quickly escaped the situation, returning to my home to begin packing up the majority of my clothing. My footsteps and other small sounds I made echoed off of the bare walls, which compounded the sadness and despair that I had been feeling since the beginning of winter.

My heart broke every time I glanced at a spot on the wall where a photo or piece of artwork once hung. I ended up crying for the first time since Terry's hospitalization that night. It felt good to release some of the pain and regret I had been feeling, and for some reason, when I began to calm down, I thought of Jeff. I moved to one of the remaining pieces of furniture, an old desk that had belonged to an uncle who had passed away. I opened the drawer and extracted the card. There was no handwritten message inside, or anything of that sort, just the words 'get well soon' in plain typeface.

I picked up my phone and dialed the number that the man had given me but just as with my former lover, I got no response. I returned to the house that I grew up in just in time for dinner. The conversation was light, in spite of the earlier tension.

‚ÄúDo you want to stay here tonight?‚Äù my mother offered.

‚ÄúI guess I could.‚Äù I accepted.

As I cleared the dishes and rinsed them, then loaded the dishwasher, my mother pulled the futon from the couch and put clean sheets and a blanket onto it. I went to the cupboard and grabbed my own pillow, though I wasn't quite ready to go to bed yet.

‚ÄúI'm going to go for a walk to the store, do you want anything?‚Äù I asked loudly enough for both of my parental units to hear.

They both declined and so I pulled on my coat and shoes, heading outside. I shoved my hands in my pockets as I began to walk, my breath escaping my lips in small puffs of vapor. Being outside felt good for the first time in a while, and as I approached the store, I considered extending my journey, though I decided against it, settling for lingering in random aisles. I was standing there, skimming an article in one of the magazines that occupied part of a book rack in one of the supermarket's aisles when I got the sense that I was being watched for the first time that day.

I glanced around, and thought I saw someone hurrying around the endcap at the far end of the narrow aisle. I walked that way but when I turned I saw only other shoppers. I tossed the magazine into my cart as I finished collecting the items I wanted. All of my purchases fit into one bag, which was a good thing, considering I still had to walk back.

'At least it's not raining.' I thought to myself and continued strolling back toward my childhood home, when again I thought I saw movement about a block ahead of me. This time I would call out to the figure that I thought I saw.

‚ÄúHey! Stop!‚Äù I yelled, my legs pumping a little bit faster, but whoever it was must have started running as well.

The side street was deserted. I began to question my own sanity in that moment. It wasn't the first time that I'd had the thought, but it was the first time I started to believe it. I hurried back to the house, putting away the things I had bought. My parents didn't linger in the living room, my father spending some time down in the basement, tinkering with something while my mother busied herself in their bedroom, diving into one of the books on her bedside table. I wandered up the stairs, and into the room I had slept in as a child.

The rooms were still a soft robin's egg blue, though the paint had faded considerably over time. There were boxes and totes of various items littering the floor. I stood there for a long time, and in my mind I could see the place the way it had been when I was young. Posters and certificates on the walls, my toys and clothing strewn about. When I came back to reality, I felt a heaviness in my chest. For the first time in weeks, the dam burst and I sunk to the floor in tears. I wanted my life back. Everything was going wrong.

I left the room and went back to the kitchen, retrieving one of the cans of beer that I had picked up from the store, cracking that and sitting at the table where we had eaten dinner. I drank quickly and when the first can was empty, opened another. I drank the whole six pack, sitting alone at the dining room table, alternating between lamenting my losses and being determined to rise above them. My parents kept their distance, and eventually I heard them retreat to their room. I didn't sleep, even after I laid down.

I ended up getting up and raiding the liquor cabinet. I was extremely drunk by the time the sun came up but didn't collapse into the bed that had been made for me until long after they left the house to run errands. The alcohol washed my dreams away as soon as I woke up, and I was grateful for that. I sat up, dazed and still foggy headed, uncertain of what to do. I turned my phone on and set it on the table while it went through the boot process. I started a pot of coffee and was surprised by the tone that alerted me to a new voicemail.

I waited until I was able to pour a cup of the dark, caffeinated water before I checked it, and when I did, I felt my spirit lift for the first time in days. Terry had finally returned my calls, and from the sound of the message, he was drunk. He said that he wanted to see me, that he was realizing that he had made a mistake. I saved the message and quickly pulled up his contact information, pressing the call button. He answered.

‚ÄúHey.‚Äù Terry said, sounding more like his old self than he had in a very long time.

‚ÄúI got your message. Did you mean what you said?‚Äù I asked, my hope chasing away the symptoms of my hangover.

‚ÄúI did. Do you want to meet for dinner tonight so we can talk?‚Äù he requested in response.

‚ÄúThat sounds great.‚Äù I replied.

He gave me a time and a place to be and then we hung up. I was walking on air when my mother and father returned home. When I told them about the call, they exchanges a quick but meaningful glance.

‚ÄúThat's great, but I want you to be careful.‚Äù the woman who gave birth to me said.

‚ÄúI will.‚Äù I assured, but only half meant it.

I quickly changed the subject and quickly exited the house, driving back home. I tidied up and even vacuumed the carpet, hoping that I wouldn't be coming home alone that night. I shaved and showered, dressing in a pair of jogging pants and a stained t-shirt until it was time to get ready. I put on a pair of nice slacks and one of my favorite shirts, putting on cologne. I even styled my hair. I left the house, every cell in my body singing with excitement. I drove as quickly as I could without breaking the law, and arrived at the restaurant early.

I lingered outside until I saw a bright red car approach the front of the place, my ex-husband stepping out of the passenger side. I only saw the driver for a moment, but I could have sworn it was the woman he had brought to the apartment back when the changes first started. Terry smiled when he saw me and we even shared an embrace.

‚ÄúYou smell good.‚Äù he said as he stepped back.

‚ÄúThank you. You do too.‚Äù I replied. I wasn't lying.

He held the door for me and we entered the building together. It didn't take long for us to be seated. Once at the table, my former significant other ordered us both a glass of wine. The server flitted away after pouring our glasses.

‚ÄúI hope you're hungry. I'm buying.‚Äù Terry enthused.

I browsed the menu and finally settled on the surf and turf combination. I asked my lover to order for me, and excused myself to the rest room. I stared at myself in the mirror for a second, and then washed my hands and splashed some water on my face, wiping it away with a paper towel. I took a few deep breaths, calming the burst of butterflies I felt in my stomach. I made my way back out into the restaurant and took my seat.

‚ÄúWhat did you want to talk about?‚Äù I asked after a sip of the fruity red wine that Terry had selected.

‚ÄúI wanted to apologize, first of all. I didn't communicate with you very well.‚Äù my former husband said, his eyes falling to the top of the table.

‚ÄúSo, explain it to me now.‚Äù I replied.

He looked like he was about to open up but our food arrived, disrupting the flow of our conversation. We both turned our attention to our respective meals and afterward, we took a walk, and as we strolled, Terry began to talk. I won't be repeating what he told me, because it was insane, but also I believe he experienced it. I don't know if it was the wine, or just the fact that we were talking, but when Terry invited me to come home with him, I accepted. He ordered a ride from his phone, and when the car pulled up, my heart stopped.

I recognized the driver. It was Jeff. He acted as if we had never met, so I did the same. He dropped us off at Terry's new apartment and I was surprised at how opulent it was. He offered me a drink as we stepped off of the elevator, and I again accepted.

‚ÄúMake yourself at home, love.‚Äù he told me.

I did just that, flopping down on the black velvet couch in his living room. He entered the room, carrying two glasses of whiskey. He handed me one of them and then perched next to me, the hand not holding his drink falling on my thigh. I felt a little thrill run through my body at the contact and had to suppress a shudder. We sipped our drinks and talked about nothing for a while. I didn't dump all of the things that had gone wrong on him, however, dodging his questions about my job. We had another drink, and I began to lose my inhibitions.

I leaned over and kissed Terry. Hard. To my pure delight, he didn't withdraw, instead falling into my embrace. We barely made it to the bedroom. When we finished, we took turns in the shower, and I laid down in the bed next to my former partner. I couldn't sleep for a while, a familiar feeling creeping into the back of my mind. It was the sensation of being watched, and my eyelids opened in response. I sat up and glanced toward the window, the curtains parted slightly. I saw a flicker of movement outside and stood as quickly and quietly as I could.

I stood still for a moment, and whatever had been watching me moved again. I decided against approaching the window, instead moving toward the door that opened into the living room. I shoved my feet into my shoes and opened the front door, hurrying to the corner of the building. I had caught the spy by surprise, but gave myself away by tripping over a fallen branch while rounding the corner. The individual turned toward me and even in the dim glow of the safety lights on the side of the building, I recognized Jeff's handsome profile.

I picked myself up and started to speak but it was his turn to surprise me. He charged. I didn't have time to brace myself and went down easily when he tackled me. Not that I could have withstood the force he'd generated. He was much stronger than anyone would have thought. I looked up into his eyes and they began to glow a strange orange-yellow. The color spread from the iris outward. And then he bent his head down and bit my shoulder. I screamed and threw hammer-fist blows with the unaffected hand, but he refused to let go.

He only released when a car began to pull into the parking lot, running away far faster than any human should be capable of moving. I managed to get to my feet and though moving was extremely painful made it to the sidewalk where I collapsed from blood loss. I woke in a hospital room, with Terry sitting beside the bed. I was hooked up to a heart monitor but not much else. My former husband smiled.

‚ÄúHow do you feel?‚Äù he asked.

I thought about it for a second.

‚ÄúCold.‚Äù I replied.

It was true. I was freezing. Other than that, I felt nothing at all.",1,1736881045.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Hey there! üòä

I‚Äôm a 28-year-old from Europe, and I‚Äôm here looking for a connection that feels authentic‚Äîsomething built on shared understanding, good conversations, and maybe even a little magic. Whether we start with a friendly chat or dive into the bigger questions of life, I‚Äôm open to seeing where the journey takes us.

# A Bit About Me

* **Who I Am:** I‚Äôm a writer at heart‚Äîsomeone who‚Äôs fascinated by the world‚Äôs little details and always looking to capture its fleeting moments in words. I believe there‚Äôs poetry in everyday life if you look close enough. I‚Äôd describe myself as curious, introspective, and quietly optimistic.
* **My Interests:**
   * **Music:** I‚Äôm on a journey to become a vinyl collector (once I have the space for it!). I love crafting playlists that feel like soundtracks to moments in life, and I‚Äôm always hunting for new tracks that speak to the soul.
   * **Nature and Exploration:** Whether it‚Äôs hiking to catch a golden-hour view, wandering unfamiliar streets, or just stargazing on a clear night, I‚Äôm happiest when I‚Äôm exploring.
   * **Creativity:** I‚Äôve been dabbling in photography lately, trying to turn fleeting scenes into lasting memories. Writing has always been my first love, but this new creative outlet is giving it some competition.
   * **Gaming and Relaxing:** On quieter days, I enjoy diving into a good game or settling in for a movie marathon‚Äîit‚Äôs all about balance, right?

# What I‚Äôm Looking For

I‚Äôm hoping to meet someone who‚Äôs as curious about life as I am. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôd love in a partner:

* **Kindness:** You lead with your heart and care about the people around you. You‚Äôre the kind of person who finds joy in small gestures and values connection over pretense.
* **Curiosity:** You see the world as a big, wonderful puzzle to explore‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs through travel, learning something new, or simply seeing the beauty in the everyday.
* **Openness:** Life is full of surprises, and you‚Äôre not afraid to embrace them. You‚Äôre willing to share your dreams, your quirks, and maybe even your favorite coffee order.
* **Partnership:** Someone who wants to build something together‚Äîa shared world full of laughter, quiet moments, and spontaneous adventures.

# Why Message Me?

I‚Äôd like to think I bring a unique mix of thoughtfulness and enthusiasm to the table. I‚Äôll remember the little things about you‚Äîthe way your favorite song makes you smile, the dreams you‚Äôre too shy to share, or the stories that light up your eyes. I‚Äôm loyal, steady, and the kind of person who shows up for the big moments and the small ones.

I believe in the magic of connection. Whether it‚Äôs through a shared playlist, a midnight chat, or a day spent exploring something new, I want to create moments that matter‚Äîmoments that turn into memories we‚Äôll always carry.

# Let‚Äôs Start a Story

If any of this resonates, send me a message. Let‚Äôs talk about music, share our favorite books, or dream up an imaginary trip to the most beautiful place we can think of. Or maybe we‚Äôll just start with ‚Äúhello‚Äù and see where the conversation takes us.

Every story starts with a single step‚Äîthis could be ours. Looking forward to hearing from you. üòä",1,1736880661.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

I make sure I always have a ""thing"" I can be known for, depending on the situation. For instance, at bars I like to bring a pack of cards, I have a handful of games off the top of my head that are quick and easy to learn. When the conversations stalls, I pull out the cards and convince someone to play a quick game with me. It usually turns into a couple games and breaks the ice for conversation. At my office I've become the tea person. I have a little box of assorted teas with me that I bring to the break room a couple of times a day and just make myself a cup. People see me with the box and make a comment, I offer them some, it's simple and not crazy interesting but it gives them something to remember me for and and makes it easier to approach people later. I've also made a habit of going to the same coffee shop every couple of days and wearing a hat or a scarf from a local minor league team that I follow. The teams not that popular but most people in my area at least semi follow them and I get comments all the time from others customers. The staff also recognizes me for it now. 
Ever since I've leaned into these random little things I feel like a conversational weight has been lifted off of me. I don't have little anxiety attacks while standing in silence with someone in the break room anymore wondering if I'm supposed to say something. I can just focus on my tea and let them come to me if they want to talk. ",89,1736880605.0,socialskills,5,0.97,False

I found out he was exchanging sexual messages with a female coworker while we were in a relationship. That happened a few years ago. I didn't mean to find it. But I did read their messages. 

I was shocked. He was the last person on earth that I would think of was capable of doing that. 

He said nothing happened between them although she went to his house for a sleepover. 

Aside from this, after that incident, he was continuously chatting with other girls... he said it was just because they gave him attention and they were just friends. He was asking them to meet up in a coffeeshop though, and it is something he always does for his male friends. But I expressed discomfort about that fact (having coffee alone with a female friend) before that. He acknowledged it and said I was right. But he still did it.

That ticked me off more. We were at the phase in our life where we were planning for marriage. 

Right after knowing, I was too overwhelmed, didn't know exactly what to do, and felt like the right thing to do was break up with him. 

So, I did.

There wasn't any fuss. The only people who knew about the reason for the breakup were my closest friends. 

Fast forward to now, I can see him change for the better. Even his attitude on certain things changed for the better. 

He wants me back. 

Now, AITA for not giving him a chance? When nothing happened between him and the coworker? When he is trying so hard to win me back now? 

I just wanna let this out my chest and see other perspectives.",1,1736880592.0,AITA_Relationships,1,1.0,False
1i1d7w1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1i1d7w1/ended_situationship_and_i_feel_conflicted/,Ended situationship and I feel conflicted,"I (37f) met a guy (40m) on Tinder in September. It was my first situationship. I'm emotional so I apologize in advance if this post seems like a wall of nonsensical text.

When we first met, we went on a date and continued to see where it goes, we had a really good connection and I was having fun and enjoyed his company so I was fine with that. We were hanging out once or twice a week for a month and texting each other throughout the day when we could. I was developing a crush on him but I didn't want to say anything because he told me in passing he wasn't looking for anything serious (I was aware it was going into situationship territory and was good with it) and I didn't want to push it out of respect for his wishes. 

One day he asked me if I would be offended if he hooked up with a guy. I was taken aback by it and I was really silent. he asked me why I was silent, I was honest and reluctantly told him I liked him. We discussed our relationship being casual and I told him just not to tell me details about his hooking up with other people. I never brought up liking him again or anything to do with progressing our relationship.

He ended the ""seeing where it goes"" during this point because he said he wanted to take a step back from dating, felt like it was getting too ""relationshippey"", told me it seemed like we weren't on the same page, and told me I was texting him too much throughout the day (I'd send 5 at most like usual). I send my friends memes and random funny things throughout the day, including him at that point. I felt treated unfairly because in my mind, I was treating him as I'd treat another friend. It felt like because he brought it up, he was making it relationshippey, not me. I didn't want anything more than what we were doing.

Then the next day he asked me to go for coffee. We hooked up again then agreed to a casual relationship. We didn't talk as often as before, just hooked up sometimes, but ""relationship possibilities"", as he put it, were definitely there. He'd have chances to hook up, and I repeatedly told him he didn't have to tell me about him hooking up with other people, as we're casual so he's not obligated to share that stuff with me. He told me he wanted to be honest about it. And while I get wanting to be forthcoming, for me I feel like there's a line between honest and insensitive. Also, myself, I'm a private person and I'm unaccustomed to telling people about my hookups so from my perspective, it just seems like a weird thing to do with someone you're hooking up with on a casual basis. 

On Saturday night he told me he needed to tell me something. I'm like okay shoot. He told me he was waiting on a hookup. I told him thanks for telling me. Later that night, he told me he was invited over the next night and he acted really giddy and nervous about it. 

At this point I was angry. I was a little bit offended that he told me he was too busy to hang out but ended up going with someone else. More so than that, I felt disrespected that he'd let me on his feeling excited and nervous to hook up with another person. I felt rejected and insecure. I'm not proud to admit that but yeah. I can understand being honest and not lying if it was asked....but voluntarily giving away the details or boasting about it feels out-of- left field.

I told him his things would be in his mailbox and said something nasty to him out of anger and the feeling of being done with it. That kind of thing is out of character for me and I regret how I reacted. It felt cathartic, it just feels like three months of what was supposed to be fun turned into an emotional minefield for no reason.

I run a small but mighty caf√© and every time we get a visit from the health department, she changes her stance on how we are keeping it, and I try and adjust it EVERY time to be compliant. 

In the past, at other restaurants, we made it either to order (KILL ME) or had a fresh mix in a Baine Marie. Never had a problem.

Now here, before I was a manager, we originally had a recipe using pasteurized yolk and butter, mixing with immersion blender. We literally kept the bottles in warm places and were told that as long as we use pasteurized eggs and didn't have it out longer than 4 hours, it was fine.

ENTER NEW HEALTH INSPECTOR----

\-First thing she said was we couldn't keep it on the counter like that. Regardless of time or temperature...?

\-After that, I tried a coffee thermos, tossed after 4 hours. She didn't like that either.

\-We would then bottle it and keep it in a bottle warmer. Temped at 135 -She told me this wasn't okay??

\-I finally switched to the powder which she recommended (...I know, ew) because it didn't need time or temp control, which seemed to be fine for her 2 visits in a row

\-Now she has told me it does need time and temp control because it has milk powder in it... luckily we do keep it at a high temp anyways, but if I need to do that anyways, I want to go back to the pasteurized yolk version...

  
Can anyone help tell me your process?

Tips?

Any similar problems you've had with the health department?

I had an assignment where they requested me to look after a group I have helped before and have formed a relationship with which is why I was requested personally. However my got the times confused as it was supposed be for this morning and not in the afternoon, as my brain somehow convinced me it was. I was so excited and had the rest of my day planned based on the location and (perceived) time. I was actually almost out the door so I could make it ‚Äúon time‚Äù when I saw a message from my company checking if everything was alright with me as the assignment location told them that I had never shown up for the assignment and my company rep told me that it didn‚Äôt sound like something I would do so was worried something might have happened to me. I was shocked because again I was so sure about the details but I double checked my calendar and saw I was completely mistaken. I explained my mistake in timing perception(?) and apologized to my company and expressed my genuine disappointment that I could do the assignment as I was so looking forward to it. Now I right where I was before, in the kitchen with my coffee, and not in a hurry but partly unable to mentally move on as it was geared to rush out the door and spend the rest of the day with a great group of individuals, then swing by the store next to that site, and then maybe drop something off at the post office before coming home. But now that time crunch is gone and I‚Äôm stuck with my worries. I do not have any assignments booked at all and it has been rough to find assignments ahead of time this year. The assignment locations I had went to last year, and formed many relationships with, have been shifting away from hiring from my company and booking people internally (that I think they have secretly poached from my company lol) So I don‚Äôt really have many people who know me well enough now to request me personally. So I am worried that I might have ruined my reputation with the person who requested me for today as well as with the specific location as I really like it there. My brain could have cost me that. At the very least, I won‚Äôt get the pay that I would have gotten for today (since I‚Äôm contract) Before I was considering taking the day off tomorrow, as I might have to take my dad to the doctor‚Äôs to receive treatment for chemo (he just started yesterday; that is a whole story itself (I wonder if you had overheard me mentioning that to part of our group a month or so ago) and I don‚Äôt know how to feel as all my emotions seem to cancel each other out for him and this situation b/c how he treated me in the past) I am going trust God as He is telling me not to worry about my job situation for this week nor about how my mistake could cost me (usually He would also help me to remember to double check the important things ahead of times nowadays but didn‚Äôt this time) The only good thing I can think of is that I was able to catch up on sleep as I have been really bad at getting myself a good amount for the past few days. So I will try not to worry about the future which is easier said than done for me. I am putting this here because I am still uncertain who in my life

I have been here for a while now, both contributing and lurking :) I am quite bored and thought: ""hey, why not write all of my knowledge here and hope it will help someone?"" So get ready for the longest post on this subreddit, which I will try to update whenever I can. 

**Backstory:**  
I have been suffering ever since turning 12 (Male). I didn't think much of it back then, but as I got older I started to feel ashamed, avoid the public, avoid social interactions and just not live my life. Fast forward to now (29); 2 years ago I got a new job (job interviews were hell for me. One time, sweat was running on my forehead lol), 1 year ago I was backpacking through Asia for 3 months (temps above 40C), dating and I am doing all kinds of things that were outside my comfort zone. I can confidently give someone a handshake now. I have this subreddit to thank for this :)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Types of HH (hyperhidrosis)**

* Craniofacial (face sweating) 
* Full body 
* Axillary (armpit sweating)
* Palmar (hands)
* Plantar (feet) 
* Inguinal (groin area)

Then there is **primary** and **secondary** HH.

* **Primary:** When it is not caused by anything. Might be genetics, might just be unlucky (me).
* **Secondary:** When it has an actual cause. This can be anything from social anxiety (SAD) to medical conditions (e.g., thyroid problems).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Where to start?**

First, it can't hurt to visit your doctor and ask for a complete blood check. Make sure things like **diabetes** and **thyroid** function (TSH, FT4, FT3, Reverse T3) are being tested as well. Most modern doctors will know about HH. 

Secondly, **check your diet**. Cut out the majority of unhealthy food, sugar and caffeine. My diet (I'm a gym rat) consists of healthy food and I only drink water. I don't drink coffee, sodas or alcohol. These days if I try to drink a coffee I can actually sweat the next day for a whole day. Try out different kinds of diets; look at things like complex carbs, more veggies/meat, gluten free stuff, a higher protein diet. All of these things can make a difference, everyone is different. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Okay, now what?**

Let's look at the treatment options, I will not look at clothing options as you can find enough information about that on this subreddit. 

* **Aluminum Chloride:** These small bottles contain anywhere from 5% to 30% of aluminium chloride. 
* **Antihydral Cream:** A tube of very thick cream where you apply a very small amount and rub it on the sweating body part.
* **Iontophoresis:** Using electricity and water. I think up to this day, no one knows what exactly happens. The theory is that it will block the sweat glands **temporarily.**
* **Meds:** Glycopyrronium (pill or topical), Propantheline Bromide (UK only), Oxybutynin, Antidepressants, Beta blockers
* **Botox:** Injections done in the affected area.
* **MiraDry:** Destruction of sweat glands using heat, **armpit only.**
* **ETS: Surgery. Please research this topic thoroughly You can read more below.**

*These are all on top of my head. If I missed anything, please let me know!*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**How to apply and ""it doesn't work for me!!??!?!?"".**

Let's get into details for applying above treatments options. I have not done all of the above, but tried majority of them. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Aluminium Chloride**

* This can come in a small bottle with a roller attached. You roll it onto your armpit before sleeping and wash it off next morning. Rinse and repeat this process for a specified amount of days (read the container).

***It doesn't work for me:*** *If the method above doesn't work, put the substance in a small spray bottle where you can spray the substance on your armpits. If this doesn't work, this treatment is not for you (it doesn't work on me either).* 

***Pros:*** *Cheap*  
***Cons:*** *Not for excessive armpit sweat, only for armpits*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Antihydral**

* By far the best thing to use for hands. Apply a small amount (pea size drop) on your hands and rub it in before going to bed. Make sure to wear thin cotton gloves so you don't get your sheets all dirty. Wash it off in the morning. This can be used on ANY bodypart that will sweat. Use it for 3 to 5 consecutive days. If the sweating returns you can redo above process.

***It doesn't work for me:*** *If the method above doesn't work for you, you either used too much or too little of the cream. I am convinced this cream has a 100% effect rate. I am not sure if your body can build a tolerance against this. If anyone knows, please enlighten me.*

***Pros:*** *Cheap, 100% effect rate on hands*  
***Cons:*** *Might be expensive if you live outside of EU, pruney fingers*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Iontophoresis**

* The safest, most expensive but time consuming option. This is where you submerge your hands/feet in water and let an electric current flow through it. This takes approx. 45 minutes of your daily time (20min for hands, 20 min for feet, 5 min cleaning). I am convinced that iontophoresis has a 100% effect rate, **if done correctly.** There is much more to look at than just filling your trays with water and submerging your affected bodyparts. If you live in a country with **soft** water (check this on the internet) then iontophoresis might not work at all. One reddit user called u/theSlash1  found out that using water with high minerals in it, will speed up your process. [Please see this table with information about different brands of water and check the ""Total Solids""](https://imgur.com/a/plqd0c3). Sadly, San Pellegrino **sparkling water** didn't work for me, so I had to do more research. [I found out that the table didn't use Gerolsteiner Sprudel, but just Gerolsteiner.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hyperhidrosis/comments/vxzkin/gerolsteiner_vs_san_pellegrino_tds_iontophoresis/) Turns out that Gerolsteiner Sprudel has almost 3x the TDS than the infamous San Pellegrino Sparkling Water. This boosted my dryness so hard, you wouldn't believe me if I said that I stayed 70% dry on my hands from August 2024 till December 2024, without doing iontophoresis once. I was still testing things out: ""when will I sweat again and how many sessions will it take me to become dry"". Long story short; I got lazy and am combining anti hydral with iontophoresis. 
* **How to:** 5x a week (weekdays) and rest in the weekend. Continue for 4 weeks straight and see how dry you get. Note: you will sweat more before it gets dry. 
* Add 400ml of HOT water with 300-400 ml of your choice of sparkling water (you don't need this if your tapwater is hard, [look at the scale and do your own research for your tapwater. Anything from Moderaterly Hard to Very Hard will be good](https://libertylake.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/water_hardness.jpg)). As a bonus you can add the tip of a teaspoon with baking soda through your mixture of water and mix it. 

***It doesn't work for me:*** *If above doesn't work for you, you need to mess with your schedule. Maybe do it 3x a week or continue doing it for a longer time (e.g. 2 months). Some people achieve results in 2 weeks, others in 2 months. Consistency is key.*

***Pros:*** *Natural feeling of being dry, body can't build tolerance against this*  
***Cons:*** *Time consuming, iontophoresis unit is expensive (you can build your own), buying sparkling water can be expensive, not meant for full body HH, but only for plantar and palmar (axillary never worked for me), can be a bit painful in the beginning*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Medicine**

* Different kind of medicine to try. I only have experience with Glycopyrronium (Robinul) in 1mg pills. These pills were like god themself made it for me. I was dry FOR DAYS. Imagine this feeling: you come home from work, take your shoes off and your socks slide off in this process because of how dry your feet are. Only glyco was able to do this for me. Sadly I build a tolerance against this in less than 2 months. Using a higher dosage will bottleneck my daily activities like eating, drinking and socializing.
* **How to use (Glycopyrronium/Robinul, Propantheline and Oxybutinin):** Take on empty stomach first thing in the morning and don't eat anything for 1-2 hours after this. Avoid sugary stuff and caffeine. For your dosage you will need to discuss with your doctor. I know that Oxybutinin is taken in 5mg or higher while glycopyrronium is taken in 1mg pills and can go up to 8mg a day.
* **Issues:** The issue with these meds is that they shut down your nerves that produce ""fluids"". Think about: tears, saliva, sweat and sexual organ fluids (semen or being wet as a woman). These won't be there when using these medicine. I can tell you first hand that using a higher dosage of glyco was 10x as worse as just sweating. I couldn't eat and swallow my food and would get a crazy headache that would just put me to bed, suffering and hating life. I also got crazy brain fog and would forget a lot of stuff at work. I quit glyco. It seems that I am a exception in this matter as it works perfectly fine for others with just 1 or 2mg. A lot of doctors also won't prescribe this as it's a medicine meant for other things, not for sweating. 
* I have no experience with anti depressants, beta blockers or topical glycopyrronium. If anyone can fill in on this part, please do so in the comments as we are here to help each other :)

***It doesn't work for me:*** *Your body might have a tolerance against certain medicine. If this is the case, you can try to wait for a few months and try it again.* 

***Pros:*** *Stops full body HH*  
***Cons:*** *Not easy to get, dry throat/mouth/eyes/nose, not handy when you have sexual activities planned, body will build tolerance against it*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Botox**

* Small needles that inject you with botox around your sweat glands to block them off. I have tried this in my armpits, it sadly blocked it for like 10%. I would never do it again and it's expensive to keep doing. Check with your healthcare provider if they pay it for you. I paid ‚Ç¨450 for both armpits.
* If you decide to do this in your hands/feet, please do a lot of research. There have been several topics where people lose power in their hands/feet for a few months. If you do any physical labour then this is NOT recommended. Also quite expensive. I paid ‚Ç¨450 for armpits (which barely worked).

***It doesn't work for me:*** *This one is tricky, it either works or it doesn't. You can contact the person who injected you and ask for a second dose of botox which may sometimes help (usually done for money, but way less than first time).*

***Pros:*** *Can be used for craniofacial HH*  
***Cons:*** *Expensive, no guaranteed results, only temporary (1-3 months, some people claim 6 months).*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

***MiraDry***

* Destroying your sweatglands with heat. I have been thinking about this, but it's around ‚Ç¨2000 for the first treatment and ‚Ç¨1000 for the second one, and for us excessive sweaters, you always need 2. There have been cases where people claim it works for only 1 year, sometimes longer, sometimes shorter. It seems this method has no guaranteed result, but majority seem happy with the result. Remember; you only hear the bad stories and you barely hear the winning stories. I suggest doing your own research on here.

***Pros:*** *No more armpit hair!!, no sweatglands, wearing any color t-shirt without sweat marks*   
***Cons:*** *Expensive, needs more treatments, recovery looks painful (swollen armpits, need pain killers), no guaranteed results, sweating may return after a while*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**ETS**

* Our enemy; surgery. PLEASE, I BEG, do research. Keep this as a very last option. I have seen more horror stories than success stories, even with what I said above that you barely hear the winning stories; the bad stories seem like nightmare fuel. Examples that I have read over the years:
* sweating returns but in tenfold
* hands stopped sweating but my feet got 10x worse
* hands stopped sweating but i'm getting compensatory sweating and now my back is always wet 
* hands stopped sweating but now my face is always dripping
* my body cant regulate my body temperature correctly anymore

Me personally, along with majority of this group, wouldn't even consider ETS an option. Please, do your own research. Try all other methods first. You may get lucky and live an amazing life, or you might get unlucky and sweat way worse than before. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Bonus: alcohol and drugs**

* Some people here claim that certain drugs makes them not sweat. My theory is because it's anxiety related. Feel free to mess around, but don't make this your crutch. Do NOT depend on things like alcohol or any kind of other drugs to become sweat free for a while. Addiction is not fun. Me personally, both weed and alcohol make me sweat. Altough, I get the feeling that when drunk I am pretty dry, but im positive it is anxiety related.

  
I truly hope this post will help someone in the future. If you have anything to add on this list, please let me know. If you have any questions regarding the things I have tried, please feel free to ask. Leave your own treatments in the comment section so people can always explore new ideas. We are suffering together here and no one really understands how shitty our lives are. We have all heard the ""everyone sweats bro lol, not just you"". 

English is also not my first language, so there might be spelling or grammatical mistakes. 

  
As always, please do your own research on the discussed methods above. This subreddit is filled with a lot of questions and information. Everyone is different and everyone has different experiences.

Examples: I pay to stream music but never find the music I like, I pay for comfortable running shoes but my ankles always hurt, I pay for premium coffee beans but it tastes like regular coffee

2. Confirm a large group of people on the internet pay to achieve the same outcome and agree that the outcome isn't as expected

Example: reddit post with 500 likes ‚Äúanyone else disappointed by their Spotify discover weekly playlist?‚Äù

Consider: searching keywords like ‚Äúdisappointed‚Äù ‚Äúfrustrated‚Äù ‚Äúannoying‚Äù ‚Äúboring‚Äù ""refund"" ""scam"" or direct competitor names

3. Estimate how valuable creating that behavior would be for the smallest group of people who need it most (MVP) AND the largest group of people (potential market)

Example: You post to social: ‚Äúwould you pay $3/month for the perfect playlist of new songs‚Äù

4. Start helping the smallest group of people create that behavior for the price you estimated

Example: create a custom GPT agent that uses a user input of their 3 favorite songs and suggests niche tracks

5. YES - PEOPLE PAY: move to step 10

6. NO - PEOPLE DON‚ÄôT PAY: iterate on price and messaging until people pay

7. NO ONE EVER PAYS: go back to step 1

8. PEOPLE EVENTUALLY PAY: re-evaluate step 3 and confirm its still something worth working on

9. As you help people create the intended outcome (manually) take note of the top 2 or 3 reasons the outcome is unblocked

RULE: you must observe people IRL using your product

10. Design product feature(s) that directly address the top reasons in step 9 (product beta)

RULE: must be designed in a UX/UI your user base is familiar with (DON'T BE CUTE - YOU'RE NOT STEVE JOBS!)

11. Add a ‚Äúfeedback loop‚Äù (or multiple) to test if these product feature(s) together create many positive outcomes

12. NO - go back to step 9 & 10 where you screwed up

13. YES - you are seeing A LOT of new, positive outcomes that you defined in step 1

Here is my setup. I built this PC myself in 2021:

* **AMD Ryzen 9 5900X**
* **Zotac Gaming GeForce RTX 3080 TRINITY**
* **ASUS TUF GAMING B550-PLUS**
* **Crucial Pro RAM DDR4 64GB Kit (2x32GB) 3200MHz, Intel XMP 2.0**
* **Noctua NH-D14**
* **GIGABYTE Power Supply 750W P750GM Modular 80+ Gold**

In April 2024, I accidentally spilled some coffee into my PC. The GPU got some on it, the cooler got some‚Äîit was a mess. I unplugged the PC, removed the GPU, cleaned everything thoroughly, put it all back together, and powered it on again. Everything worked fine.

The PC ran perfectly for several months. But in July, it started randomly crashing.

I needed more RAM and suspected the existing RAM might be faulty. So, I upgraded from 32GB to 64GB, but the crashes persisted.

I started debugging using Windows tools and found that a driver, **nvlddmkm.sys** (NVIDIA), was crashing. I ran MemTest86, and it reported errors. The problem was the errors were inconsistent‚Äîone test would pass, and the next would fail.

I began to suspect something else. Could the new RAM also be faulty? That seemed unlikely. I read that downclocking RAM could help, so I tried it‚Äîand it worked. No more crashes, and it even solved issues I‚Äôd had for years.

For years, my webcam used to freeze, and I couldn‚Äôt use it unless I unplugged and replugged it. I thought it was faulty because the cable was damaged. At one point, I bought a new webcam and had the same issue. After downclocking the RAM, the webcam worked perfectly with no freezes.

Recently, I decided to update my PC. I upgraded to Windows 11 and updated my motherboard firmware. I thought these updates might fix my issues, so I re-enabled XMP. But the crashes returned.

I downclocked the RAM again, but this time the crashes didn‚Äôt stop. My webcam also froze twice.

To be honest, I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore.

Some additional info I think is important:

* **Temperatures are fine**: 60¬∞C for the CPU, 80¬∞C for the GPU when crashes happen.
* **I don‚Äôt think the coffee spill damaged my PC**: It ran fine for months after the incident, and the webcam issue existed before that.
* **Crashes depend on the game**: For example, I can run CS2 at 300 FPS for hours (even days) while streaming in 1080p on Twitch with no crashes. But if I play *Outer Wilds*, it crashes after 5 minutes. CS2 has never caused a crash, but other games like *Deadlock* crash 100% of the time.
* **Power supply cables**: I‚Äôve been using a chained cable for the GPU for years without issues, but I‚Äôve heard you should use two separate cables. My spare cables aren‚Äôt with me at the moment, but I‚Äôll fetch them soon to test.

I‚Äôve tried to be as specific as possible. If you need more info, just ask!

By Day 29, I found myself writing down all the day-to-day shenanigans I‚Äôve been experiencing with my kid and sharing them with my wife. She suggested I turn them into a book for my child to read when he gets older, maybe even share some of it with him as he grows up.

What do you guys think? Has anyone done something similar? Would love your thoughts, please remember it's supposed to be purely a fun and satirical recollection of events with my kid :-).

Captain's Log: Day 29

It‚Äôs been 29 days stranded with the beast. Its origins remain a mystery, its motives unclear. What I do know is this: it is relentless, cunning, and fueled by an unholy combination of Mac and cheese and chaos.

I have discovered that Mac and cheese will buy me approximately 15 minutes of peace. Spinach, surprisingly, yields similar results, though the beast consumes it with an air of suspicion‚Äîas though it knows I‚Äôm trying to trick it into something healthy.

Today, the beast discovered its own voice. Not just babbling‚Äîno, this was a guttural yell, somewhere between a Viking war cry and the sound of a goat being startled. It yells at me now. Sometimes for food, sometimes for entertainment, and sometimes just‚Ä¶ because it can.

Attempts to communicate with the beast have proven largely unsuccessful. It seems to be imitating me, though poorly. Clapping hands, shaking its head in mockery, and mimicking my facial expressions with a level of sass I didn‚Äôt think an 11-month-old could possess.

Earlier, my partner attempted to leave the compound. The beast detected her departure immediately. How? I do not know. It could‚Äôve been her scent, a faint creak in the floorboard, or perhaps the beast has developed sonar. The result was catastrophic. The crying reached such decibel levels that car alarms two streets over began to wail in sympathy.

The beast has also grown territorial. I attempted to retrieve a sock from its iron grip this afternoon. Rookie mistake. Its strength is unmatched; the sock is gone. I‚Äôve written it off as a casualty of war.

Sleep remains a distant dream. The beast fights unconsciousness with a Herculean will. I tried rocking, singing, even offering a small tribute in the form of my last granola bar. Nothing worked. Eventually, sheer exhaustion overtook it‚Äîbut not before locking eyes with me in one final act of defiance, as if to say, ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt over.‚Äù

There was one brief moment of reprieve today. The beast climbed into my lap, let out a deep sigh, and rested its sticky, crumb-covered head against my chest. For a few minutes, there was peace. The storm calmed. In those fleeting moments, I was reminded why I endure this endless cycle of chaos and crumbs.

But I cannot let my guard down. The beast stirs now, eyes blinking open, and I know this moment of calm is over.

May tomorrow bring strength.

End Log.......for now

Captain's Log: Day 29 ‚Äì Emergency Entry

This is not a drill. The beast‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs mobile.

At approximately 1400 hours, the creature discovered that its wheeled contraption‚Äîthe so-called ‚Äúwalker‚Äù‚Äîis not merely a tool for balance, but a vessel for speed. I repeat: the beast has achieved sprinting velocity.

It began innocently enough‚Äîa slow, clumsy shuffle across the compound. But then‚Ä¶ something changed. A flicker in its eyes, a realization, and then‚Äîzoom. The beast tore across the floor like a caffeinated cheetah in a shopping cart.

I tried to intercept. I dove left, it veered right. It‚Äôs learning evasive maneuvers. Corners mean nothing to it now; it drifts around them like it‚Äôs in a scene from Fast & Furious: Playpen Drift.

Casualties so far include:

One floor lamp (it never stood a chance).

A poorly placed sippy cup (crushed under the beast‚Äôs unyielding plastic wheels).

My remaining sense of control.


Attempts to slow the beast were futile. I attempted a blockade with couch pillows‚Äîit bulldozed through them. I considered using snacks as bait, but I realized too late‚Ä¶ it no longer hungers. It only runs.

At one point, it locked eyes with me mid-sprint. A grin spread across its face‚Äîa grin not of innocence, but of pure, unfiltered chaos. It was at that moment I realized: I am no longer in charge here.

I‚Äôve retreated to higher ground (the couch). From this vantage point, I can track its movements. The beast circles below, wheels clattering ominously, a blur of chubby legs and determination.

My partner will return soon‚Ä¶ I hope. Until then, I will remain here, observing, documenting, and praying the beast does not figure out how to reverse.

May the odds be ever in my favor.

Captain's Log: Day 30

At precisely 0800 hours, the beast was finally returned to its natural habitat: daycare. But not before leaving a trail of destruction that will haunt me for days to come.

The morning began with an incident. A biological event so catastrophic that words fail to describe the sheer magnitude of what occurred. Let us simply call it ‚Äúthe poop explosion.‚Äù It defied logic, physics, and the capacity of modern diaper technology. Cleanup required an all-hands-on-deck approach and a level of personal sacrifice I was not emotionally prepared for.

As I was mid-decontamination, the beast decided it was the perfect moment to make a break for it‚Äîtarget locked on our 85-pound dog. The dog, having seen war, wisely retreated, but the beast pursued with a tenacity that can only be described as terrifying. Round one ended with the dog cornered under the dining table, the beast laughing maniacally, and me questioning every life choice that led to this moment.

Round two began when the dog attempted to escape, sprinting across the living room. The beast, now emboldened by yesterday‚Äôs walker training, gave chase like a toddler gladiator in a chariot. By the time I managed to intervene, both were panting heavily, the dog looked traumatized, and the beast was screaming with victorious glee.

By some miracle (and an entire pot of coffee), we made it to daycare. The beast, now clean, fed, and once again looking angelic, waved goodbye with sticky fingers as though the morning‚Äôs chaos had been nothing but a dream.

I‚Äôm back at the compound now, the silence deafening. I‚Äôve cleaned up the wreckage and taken a moment to reflect. The beast will return soon enough, but for now, I‚Äôll savor this brief, beautiful calm.

Captain's Log: Day 31

Daycare remains on a cruel and unforgiving 2-hour delay. The mother departed at 0700 hours, and everything changed. The beast, ever the master of duality, shed its angelic disguise the moment the door closed behind her.

I am now trapped in its lair: the playroom. It has barricaded me with plush animals, foam blocks, and an impenetrable wall of its own chaotic energy. The beast is forcing me to interact with its sushi-themed shape sorter‚Äîa device that simultaneously mocks me with its complexity and taunts me with the implication that I am not smart enough to solve it. I suspect it knows the answers but refuses to share them.

There‚Äôs no denying it now. The beast is learning. It knows exactly how to manipulate its parents. Around the mother, it is all cuddles, coos, and doe-eyed innocence. But with me? Chaos incarnate. This is not just survival for the beast‚Äîit‚Äôs strategy.

The most alarming development: the beast has become fixated on my logging instruments. It watches me closely, plotting, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. It has already attempted several grab-and-dash maneuvers, its chubby fingers grazing the edge of my pen. I fear it may succeed soon, cutting off my ability to document this ordeal.

I attempted to distract the beast with its favorite musical toy, but it retaliated by activating every button at once, creating a symphony of disjointed electronic jingles. The noise was deafening. It grinned, triumphant, as I covered my ears in defeat.

This may be my last entry for some time. The beast is growing bolder, its patience thinning. If it captures my tools, I will be forced into full submission, relegated to a life of stacking blocks and fake sushi rolls. If I do not return, tell the mother: I fought valiantly.

May the stars guide me.

Captain's Log: Day 34

It‚Äôs been a few days since my last entry. My absence was not by choice but necessity. On Day 32, the beast successfully captured my logging instruments. They were recovered hours later, coated in drool and, somehow, applesauce. By Day 33, I had resorted to manual documentation in an old notebook, but the beast found it, gnawed the corners, and used it as a shield in a battle against its toy dinosaurs. I barely escaped with my dignity.

Now, to today‚Äôs crisis.

At 0430 hours, I made the tactical error of attempting to leave the compound for work. I moved silently, a master of stealth. But the beast knew. I don‚Äôt know how‚Äîit may have detected the faint vibration of my footsteps or sensed my rising cortisol levels. Regardless, it awoke, unleashing a banshee wail so loud it sounded like an air raid siren designed to rouse not just the house but all of suburbia.

I rushed in, hoping to contain the situation before neighborhood authorities were alerted. I rocked, I whispered sweet nothings, I even promised unlimited Mac and cheese for life. Nothing worked. The beast‚Äôs demands were clear: only the mother would suffice.

The mother arrived, groggy but prepared for battle, and scooped up the beast. Peace returned‚Ä¶ briefly. But the beast required more than comfort. It latched on to her with the intensity of a vampire draining life force from its prey. The feeding session stretched into an eternity. I swear I saw my wife‚Äôs soul flicker as the beast consumed her very essence. By the time the ordeal was over, she looked pale but triumphant, muttering something about needing more snacks and possibly a nap.

The beast, now satisfied, allowed itself to be placed back into its nest, where it snored softly, its belly full and its power restored. I left for work, knowing that once again, the mother had saved us all.

I am unsure if I will ever escape undetected again. The beast grows stronger, its senses sharper. 
As I write this, I am at work, weary and defeated, but alive. The beast remains at home, likely plotting its next move. I fear I may never leave quietly again.

Captain‚Äôs Log: Day 35

At 0505 hours this morning, I successfully executed a covert exit from the compound. Or so I thought. As I led our firstborn‚Äîa noble, 85-pound lap dog named Bailey‚Äîout for his morning patrol, the beast awakened. Its keen senses detected my departure despite my best efforts to move like a whispering breeze.

The beast stirred but did not sound the alarm this time, perhaps due to the soothing presence of the mother, who remains the ultimate negotiator of peace. Bailey, meanwhile, conducted his walk with the urgency of a royal procession, ensuring every leaf and blade of grass was acknowledged. His insistence on sitting in my lap during post-walk cooldowns continues to defy both logic and physics.

Upon reaching work, I faced an equally daunting adversary: the inbox. Three weeks of missed correspondences stared back at me‚Äîa mountain of 308 emails, each more tedious than the last. Most were marked ‚ÄúURGENT,‚Äù though I suspect only five truly were. The rest appear to be a mix of pointless CCs, redundant follow-ups, and a bafflingly high number of cat memes from coworkers.

Despite the chaos, I find solace in routine. For now, the beast is contained at daycare, Bailey is resting comfortably, and I am armed with enough coffee to fuel a small nation. Tonight, however, I know the beast will return, and so the cycle continues.

Captain‚Äôs Log: Day 35 ‚Äì Emergency Entry

This is not a drill. A catastrophic situation has arisen. The daycare has lost all emergency contact information. I repeat: all contact information has been wiped. They have issued a grave ultimatum: if the information is not restored immediately, they will sever ties with us.

This is, quite literally, a life-or-death scenario. Without daycare, survival within the compound is unsustainable. The beast, now fully mobile and emboldened by its recent developmental milestones, would surely overwhelm us in mere days.

I‚Äôve mobilized all available resources to rectify the situation. Phone calls have been made. Emails have been sent. Smoke signals are being considered as a backup. I‚Äôve even resorted to scouring old sticky notes and junk drawers for scraps of paper that might contain the critical numbers.

The mother, ever the strategist, has taken point on this operation. While I frantically attempt to track down the daycare director, she has begun creating a backup system‚Äîa laminated ‚Äúemergency dossier‚Äù complete with redundant copies of all necessary information. She muttered something about ‚Äúnever trusting the cloud again‚Äù as she typed with furious determination.

The stakes could not be higher. Daycare is not just a service; it is the fragile thread keeping us tethered to some semblance of sanity. Without it, we are nothing more than prisoners of the beast‚Äôs ever-expanding reign.

If we fail, I fear the beast will claim total dominance over the compound by week‚Äôs end. If we succeed, I will dedicate the rest of my life to maintaining redundant contact lists in every conceivable format.

May the universe guide us in this hour of need.

Here is my setup. I built this PC myself in 2021:

* **AMD Ryzen 9 5900X**
* **Zotac Gaming GeForce RTX 3080 TRINITY**
* **ASUS TUF GAMING B550-PLUS**
* **Crucial Pro RAM DDR4 64GB Kit (2x32GB) 3200MHz, Intel XMP 2.0**
* **Noctua NH-D14**
* **GIGABYTE Power Supply 750W P750GM Modular 80+ Gold**

In April 2024, I accidentally spilled some coffee into my PC. The GPU got some on it, the cooler got some‚Äîit was a mess. I unplugged the PC, removed the GPU, cleaned everything thoroughly, put it all back together, and powered it on again. Everything worked fine.

The PC ran perfectly for several months. But in July, it started randomly crashing.

I needed more RAM and suspected the existing RAM might be faulty. So, I upgraded from 32GB to 64GB, but the crashes persisted.

I started debugging using Windows tools and found that a driver, **nvlddmkm.sys** (NVIDIA), was crashing. I ran MemTest86, and it reported errors. The problem was the errors were inconsistent‚Äîone test would pass, and the next would fail.

I began to suspect something else. Could the new RAM also be faulty? That seemed unlikely. I read that downclocking RAM could help, so I tried it‚Äîand it worked. No more crashes, and it even solved issues I‚Äôd had for years.

For years, my webcam used to freeze, and I couldn‚Äôt use it unless I unplugged and replugged it. I thought it was faulty because the cable was damaged. At one point, I bought a new webcam and had the same issue. After downclocking the RAM, the webcam worked perfectly with no freezes.

Recently, I decided to update my PC. I upgraded to Windows 11 and updated my motherboard firmware. I thought these updates might fix my issues, so I re-enabled XMP. But the crashes returned.

I downclocked the RAM again, but this time the crashes didn‚Äôt stop. My webcam also froze twice.

To be honest, I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore.

# Some additional info I think is important:

* **Temperatures are fine**: 60¬∞C for the CPU, 80¬∞C for the GPU when crashes happen.
* **I don‚Äôt think the coffee spill damaged my PC**: It ran fine for months after the incident, and the webcam issue existed before that.
* **Crashes depend on the game**: For example, I can run CS2 at 300 FPS for hours (even days) while streaming in 1080p on Twitch with no crashes. But if I play *Outer Wilds*, it crashes after 5 minutes. CS2 has never caused a crash, but other games like *Deadlock* crash 100% of the time.
* **Power supply cables**: I‚Äôve been using a chained cable for the GPU for years without issues, but I‚Äôve heard you should use two separate cables. My spare cables aren‚Äôt with me at the moment, but I‚Äôll fetch them soon to test.

I‚Äôve tried to be as specific as possible. If you need more info, just ask!",1,1736879775.0,pcmasterrace,4,1.0,False

Not only does Columbus love to put goals on the board at home, but both of these squads have lukewarm defenses at best. To boot, all 3 of the Flyers/Blue Jackets' last encounters have gone beyond 6 (their last game ended at 9!) Take the Over to cash, betting fam.¬†

The kitchen is often referred to as the heart of the home, and for good reason. It serves not just as a place for cooking but also as a gathering space for family and friends. To maximize both functionality and comfort, investing in home essentials for the kitchen is crucial. These essentials can enhance your cooking experience and provide all the tools you need to create delicious meals.

First and foremost, cookware is a fundamental component of any kitchen. High-quality pots and pans, along with non-stick options, can dramatically improve your cooking efficiency. Additionally, incorporating a solid set of knives is essential for meal preparation; a chef's knife, paring knife, and bread knife are must-haves for any home chef.

Another critical element is storage solutions. A well-organized kitchen not only looks aesthetically pleasing but also makes your cooking experience smoother. Spice racks, food storage containers, and drawer dividers keep your essentials accessible and easy to find. Investing in stackable containers can help maximize cabinet space while keeping ingredients fresh.

- **Small appliances:** A reliable blender, toaster, and coffee maker are must-have appliances that can simplify daily tasks.
- **Utensils:** Essential kitchen utensils such as spatulas, tongs, and measuring cups are necessary for accurate cooking.
- **Cutting boards:** A good cutting board, preferably in wood or bamboo, can protect your countertops and knives while providing a sturdy surface for food prep.

Additionally, consider investing in quality dishware and glassware. A collection that suits your style can enhance dinner parties and family meals, making them more enjoyable. Lastly, don‚Äôt overlook the importance of kitchen textiles like dish towels, oven mitts, and aprons, which add both functionality and flair to your space.

By carefully selecting your home essentials for the kitchen, you can create an efficient and inviting environment that reflects your personal style while meeting culinary needs.

I am 24 and have been attempting my degree since I was 18, and if I get the job, then I would have to drop out of school and only do part time (like one class per semester online).

When I was in class, I felt like I belonged there, and that this was the place I needed to be. I have no money, hate my current job, and all I want is to graduate and try to go for my dream. 

The fancy job is $60k+ per year, full health and dental coverage, an awesome company to work for, and a lot of room for growth. Not to mention my brother stuck his neck out to get me the application. It also would mean moving my life 1.5 hours south, and living with my dad for a few months.

I wanted to post a warning about a high control group that preys on vulnerable international students. This group is with Acts 2 Network and have a group on campus called International Graduate Student Ministry and International Undergraduate Student Ministry.

In case you are wondering why those strangers are SO NICE to you and buying you boba and coffee, it's because they have an ulterior motive. They want you to come to bible study, become a Chrisian, join their church and commit your life to them. But at first, they will make it seem like they just want to be your friend. 

It might be scary to be in a new country with no friends or family but please know that these people are not genuine in their intentions. They don't really want to be your friend. They are just pretending so they can get you to join their group.

Tell them to stop bothering you otherwise they will keep pestering you. Join other campus organizations that don't have ulterior motives. Or meet people in your program or class. But please do not be fooled by their niceness. Love bombing is a tactic they use to lure you in.

I have my collection of oriental perfumes for sale. The reason is that I already have too many perfumes, the vast majority of them I don't use and I'm switching to another style of perfumery. In total there are 93 perfumes, all of them were only used 2x to 5x around 30 sprays and in this type of perfumery, they have already matured. All of them have the original box except for 3 of them, because they were damaged in transport when I bought them.
Exclusive sale within Europe. Shipping costs will be added to orders. I only sell at least three perfumes and sets of perfumes from the same line.
If you want the entire collection, I am available to negotiate at a price well below its commercial value at the moment.

Hey guys, long story short, I'd like to refinish this table, but need advice on what to do. Things like the best method to strip it, best clear coat to use for a coffee table, and how to rebond and straighten the boards that are separating. Read below if you want more details. 

[Here is the table](https://imgur.com/a/prwDIlN)

I recently got this coffee table that I'd like to refinish. It belonged to an uncle who loved woodworking and practiced it his whole life, but recently passed away. He really loved this particular table. It's been passed around in my family for years, but in my uncle's final days, he didn't take very good care of it. He taught me some woodworking growing up, but nothing beyond amateur level skills. 

I'd love to refinish this (although as an amateur I know it won't be perfect), but I need advice on how to go about it. I've refinished some wood projects, but nothing with multiple types of wood or anything as complex as this.

It appears to be hardwood, not vaneer. I'm unsure of what type of clear coat is on it, so I don't know if sanding or a stripper is the best method. Some of the pieces of wood are also separating, so I imagine I will need to reglue them. Some are warped unfortunately, so I'm not sure how to straighten or repair them. Then I wanted advice on what the best clear coat is for a coffee table. I've mostly used polycrylic and lacquer for other projects, but I'm not sure if either of those are suited for this.

Any tips would be highly appreciated. I'd love to use the skills my uncle taught me to restore it as best as I can!",1,1736878537.0,furniturerefinishing,0,1.0,False

Day 5 of starting this WOE. I‚Äôve been eating about 4 pasture-raised eggs cooked in 1 tbsp of organic ghee with 1-2 piece of bacon. I‚Äôll usually have coffee with a tbsp of butter whipped in. I haven‚Äôt been hungry until late afternoon where I will have a 8-12oz ribeye with salt and ghee, cooked in a tbsp of butter. Last night I made a 14oz ribeye and only ate about 7oz. Lots of water with a dash or Redmonds. Regular bowel movements. I also just started my period yesterday. This morning I made 6 eggs and could only eat 4. I also have no desire for coffee as my energy is pretty stable. I guess I am finding it weird that I‚Äôm not ravaging hungry on my period or just have felt an overall decrease in appetite the last 3 days. Is this to be expected? I feel great so I‚Äôm not overly concerned, just new to all this so wanted to pick your brains.",6,1736878426.0,carnivorediet,1,1.0,False

Eminem can‚Äôt even record music without some mix engineer or phony in his posse leaking all his private stuff.

It sucks, but at the same time, I‚Äôm SO grateful I got to hear tracks like ‚ÄúSmack You‚Äù. We probably would‚Äôve never heard it without leaks

Eminem should honestly just do a mixtape of all the unreleased tracks.

We all love prime Eminem especially and there‚Äôs a lot of gems still out there to be heard.
