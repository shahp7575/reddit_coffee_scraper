He‚Äôs always joked around but it‚Äôs gotten more serious? For a break down: he drinks around 2-3 monsters (energy drinks) a day along with a few coffee and then smokes a couple cones, he‚Äôs extremely skinny and he won‚Äôt stop shaking, this is worrying on its own but it‚Äôs the things that he says too, he‚Äôs talked to us about how he thinks he might be Jesus? He‚Äôs started reading the bible and he finds these ‚Äúgovernment documents‚Äù online and reads them. He‚Äôs all over conspiracy theory instagram reels and watches the strangest videos all day long. 

He thinks he has powers.. he‚Äôs said that he made a blackberry that I had taste sour, he‚Äôs said that he‚Äôs made other people believe that someone‚Äôs on fire and when ever I mention something like for example ‚ÄúI have a fat headache rn‚Äù he would look at me and chuckle like he did it!

I lost my job in mid December ( not fault of mine ) and was living with my parents already due to a divorce.  They told me to get out immediately which they still haven‚Äôt been able to answer as to a reason  why. I had no where to go and little to no money as I lost everything in my divorce including my home and money.  I could have saved my house for 10k but when I asked my parents for that they literally laughed ( and they are your typical rich ,boomer ,religious, narcissistic, can‚Äôt be told nutthin types )  I was obviously upset about this but got over it as I was pretty sure going into they were never going to agree. But NOW they have truly inspired with their self obsession, comfort over anything and greed when they threw me ( a year earlier than what we all agreed too ) out over losing my job.  This mad me very angry but once again got over it and asked an Aunt who let me move in her basement.  Fast forward 70 days or so and I went to pick up my stuff ( keep in mind I did not hear from either parent no calls or texts ) and was missing literally everything that had some value ( electronics, tools, and furniture ) but even worse I am in feild sales and work remotely/ from home they threw away everything I use to make my living ( desk, chair, printer, file cabinet, my suits, computer monitors, dress shoes and belts they even pitched my coffee machine lol) I can‚Äôt even video interview now.  With all this going down I feel like I‚Äôm losing my mind so I am just curious what everyone thought?  I was wild back in the day but they never had to shell out any money for me paid for nothing I have never been in trouble with the law and have worked full time my entire adult life and moved out when I was 18.

Along the way, Luke and Adam face off against the very forces of human nature, ultimately learning that some things are beyond their control.

1jevkqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheHandmaidsTale/comments/1jevkqd/roadmap_to_season_6_premiere_comfort_scenes/,Roadmap to season 6 premiere - Comfort scenes,"Hello! Due to my 10000th rewatch, as the premiere of season 6 is approaching, I will make a list with imo comfort scenes (as much as comfort as they can be in a show like that)

* June and Emily sit by the river, in a rainy day (""it's gonna pour"" and Emily responds ""I like the rain""), attending the view and having a discussion about their whereabouts - starting to build a friendship
* Macarons in Putnam's house on Janine's birth day. Generally, Naomi's dinner/lunch parties, which if you notice, always include macarons.
* Emily saying her name out loud for the first time.
* Rita cooking.
* June and Moira in flashbacks, doing simple normal things eg being in a party, running and go for a coffee. 
* June getting the package from Moira and reading her note ""this is your package bitch! Praised be. XoXO""
* Something very strange: the scene where Luke is found by other fugitives and they take him to their bus, and they leave the abandoned village. For some reason, the scenery with the dark golden light, the snow and the small houses and the music theme of Gilead, gave me the chills and at the same time I felt that this small village would be such a relaxing place to stay BEFORE. 
* June watching Friends episode and work out in the murder house.
* Moira arriving to Canada and see the car plate, that is Canadian.
* Aunt Lydia ""there is nothing like soup in a rainy day"". If only she didn't torture Handmaid's... I like to imagine that they gathered all handmaid's in the red center, and gave them soup. 
* Serena gardening
* June in flash back, in a break from her work, looking outside the window the people. 
* Serena and June working at night in Fred's absence. Listening to music, drinking tea and writing/correcting official paperwork. Such a break from an endless brain dead boring life. Such a powerful moment when June takes the pen. 
* Serena asking for a glass of wine in the Canadian hotel bar and Tuelo discussion in general. Simple things, in normal life: smoke a cigarette, drink a glass of whine, relaxing in a coffee bar.
* Handmaid's being at the grocery store and start spreading their real names with each other
* June nursing Nicole at night, along with Nick's company. Two parents happy for their child. 
* June finally getting a break from the rapes in Lawrence house. Spying with Marthas, sneaking around the house and reading all those Handmaid's files, listening to mixtapes, etc
* Aunts ""working"" (I do not want to refer to ""assign women to their rapists"" as work, but I didn't know what else to call it) and sharing a glass of liquor as a ""reward"". For me it was a comfort scene because of the ""doing things in a community"". It wasn't exactly that, it was a close as it can be in a Gilead world. 
* June with Beth and the rest of the handmaid's organizing the children get-out-of-Gilead thing. For some reason I found it very comforting. 
* Emily visiting the doctor in Canada, and telling her she is fine, except her cholesterol or Emily trying glasses. 
* June watching with Janine , the fish in the fish tank in the grocery store
* Ending of season 3 - even though June is shot, I like the flashback in the Before times and the Into Dust playing in the background
* All scenes in the farm from season 4. God they seemed so happy and relaxed... all of them. I loved those scenes. 
* June visiting a super market in Canada. The simple act of shopping as a normal person. 
* June, Rita, Moira and Emily gathering together in their house
* Rita making bread
* Rita eating sushi and drinking a coke
* My personal favorite: June , beginning of s04e08, cutting her handmaid hair (because in Gilead cutting hair is not allowed) and Portishead playing in the background
* June walking like a boss to Fred's hearing, to give her testimony. Her hair, her make up, her dressing, her determination. Everything. 
* Doctor saying to Janine, that it is not her business that Janine wants an abortion, trashing the fundamentalists, and saying that by laws she is obligated to tell her that abortion can led to a bunch of anti-scientific horrifying result, but not by law, she also wants to tell her that this is a bunch of crap. 
* Ex Handmaids killing Fred. 
* Ex Handmaids eating breakfast at the dinner after killing Fred. So satisfying scene. ",2,1742386513.0,TheHandmaidsTale,0,1.0,False

The good ole' markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent applies here, as it should, but this one is for the books. ¬†In my opinion, if not this administration, the next one will make a law about publicly traded companies' exposure to crypto.

$MSTR has tried to use all dubious schemes to raise investor money and ¬†dump it in bitcoin, starting with ATM share offerings, convertible debt death spiral financing, preferred stock offerings, well, here is a list:

||
||
|¬†|‚Ä¢|¬†|$800.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.625% Convertible Senior Notes due 2030 (‚Äú0.625% 2030 Convertible Notes‚Äù);|

¬†

|¬†|‚Ä¢|¬†|$3.000 billion in aggregate principal amount of 0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 (‚Äú2029 Convertible Notes‚Äù and, together with the 0.625% 2030 Convertible Notes, the 0% 2030 Convertible Notes, the 2031 Convertible Notes, the 2032 Convertible Notes, and the 2028 Convertible Notes, the ‚ÄúConvertible Notes‚Äù).|



And now....drum roll...a perpetual preferred issue of shares paying 10% dividends available ""only for institutions, and select individuals"", ticker $STRF, which stands for ""strife"", a name fitting the current state of the $MSTR common stockholder community. The 10% dividends and the supposed exclusivity would make Bernie Madoff proud. Or would it?

Last night, I logged into my small Webull account to check on NVNI and QNRX, and what did I see in the IPO section? An offer to order $STRF using Webull. That is right - they are targeting small retail investors and not large institutions and ""special people"". So, following the money and management greed, what can one conclude? Here are the risk factors from the prospectus:

""Although the perpetual strife preferred stock will be senior to our class A common stock, class B common stock, and perpetual strike preferred stock, it will be junior to our existing and future indebtedness, structurally junior to the liabilities of our subsidiaries and subject to the rights and preferences of any other class or series of preferred stock then outstanding.""¬†**TLDR: the seniority means nothing**

""We may not have sufficient funds to pay dividends in cash on the perpetual strife preferred stock, or we may choose not to pay dividends on the perpetual strife preferred stock. In addition, regulatory and contractual restrictions may prevent us from declaring or paying dividends.""¬†**TLDR: we may or may not pay you, depending on whatever we might decide to do next**

""We may issue preferred stock in the future that ranks equally with the perpetual strife preferred stock with respect to dividends and liquidation rights, which may adversely affect the rights of preferred stockholders.""¬†**TLDR: see #1 - seniority means nothing**

""There is currently no trading market for the perpetual strife preferred stock. If an active trading market does not develop for the perpetual strife preferred stock, then holders of the perpetual strife preferred stock may be unable to sell their perpetual strife preferred stock at desired times or prices, or at all.""¬†**TLDR: boilerplate disclosure**

**""We have broad discretion in the use** of the net proceeds from this offering and may not use them effectively"" and ""We may use the net proceeds from this offering to purchase additional bitcoin, the price of which has been, and will likely continue to be, highly volatile.""¬†**TLDR: we might continue to buy the top of bitcoin with your hard earned cash**

So what is the trade? This trade used to make 25% per week last year when $MSTR was trading over $400, so while it is more difficult to calibrate now, I think with the renewed and desperate dilution to the common shareholders, the only way for $MSTR is down and it will decouple from BTC more and more.

Yeah, that‚Äôs me. Every. Single. Day. I‚Äôm 19, and my mind runs a 24/7 talk show where I‚Äôm both the host and the guest, the audience and the critic. It‚Äôs a chaotic blend of wild thoughts, random questions, and the occasional deep philosophical debate at 3 AM. And honestly? I‚Äôm exhausted. I yap with my brain so much that I‚Äôve started wondering if I should just name it and call it my best friend. But let‚Äôs be real ‚Äî I need an *actual* friend. Someone who isn‚Äôt just a figment of my imagination, someone who can laugh at my weird jokes and maybe, just maybe, silence the endless monologue that my brain seems to love.

# The Never-Ending Mental Podcast

Picture this: I wake up, and before I even brush my teeth, my brain is already at it.

**Brain:**

* ‚ÄúWhat if you just ditch everything and move to the mountains?‚Äù
* ‚ÄúWait, did you actually reply to that message last night or did you dream about it?‚Äù
* ‚ÄúHow many calories are in an entire pizza if I eat it lying down versus sitting up?‚Äù

Me:

* ‚ÄúOh god, not again‚Ä¶‚Äù

By the time I‚Äôm done making my coffee, I‚Äôve already had a full-on conversation about life choices, future goals, and why pineapple on pizza is still up for debate. And it doesn‚Äôt stop there. Whether I‚Äôm scrolling through Instagram, walking to the store, or even pretending to pay attention in class, my brain is on a never-ending commentary. It‚Äôs like having Morgan Freeman narrating my life, but instead of calm wisdom, it‚Äôs chaotic overthinking.

# Alone, but Never Really Alone

The irony? I‚Äôm never really alone. I always have *me* ‚Äî and my brain, who refuses to let me have a quiet moment. But the truth is, I‚Äôm tired of this one-sided companionship. I need a friend who can break through the noise and give me something other than my own thoughts to listen to.

**My Brain:**

* ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need anyone. You‚Äôve got me!‚Äù
* ‚ÄúWhy bother making new friends? What if they judge you?‚Äù
* ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just stay in our comfort zone, where no one can hurt us.‚Äù

Me:

* ‚ÄúBruh, I‚Äôm tired of you.‚Äù

It‚Äôs funny how I can spend hours talking to myself about literally anything ‚Äî from conspiracy theories to whether cats secretly judge us ‚Äî yet the idea of initiating an actual conversation with another human feels like running a marathon in flip-flops.

# Overthinking Every. Single. Thing.

I‚Äôm not even exaggerating when I say I overthink everything. Like, I‚Äôll spend 15 minutes analyzing whether that ‚ÄúüòÇ‚Äù someone sent was genuine or just polite. Did they laugh? Were they cringing? Am I overanalyzing a single emoji? Absolutely. But that‚Äôs just the appetizer.

My brain loves a good overthinking session, and it thrives on creating imaginary scenarios where I embarrass myself or say the wrong thing. I‚Äôve had entire conversations in my head with people I haven‚Äôt even met yet, just in case I run into them someday. I rehearse jokes that no one will hear and prepare answers to questions that no one will ask.

**Me to My Brain:**

* ‚ÄúOkay, chill. Let‚Äôs just be normal.‚Äù

**Brain:**

* ‚ÄúDefine normal. And while you‚Äôre at it, what‚Äôs the meaning of life?‚Äù

# The Lonely Loop of Self-Talk

Sometimes, it feels like I‚Äôm stuck in an endless feedback loop. I tell myself I‚Äôm fine. I convince myself that I‚Äôm *better off alone*. And yet, a tiny voice deep down keeps whispering, ‚ÄúBut what if‚Ä¶?‚Äù

What if I had someone to share all these random thoughts with? What if there was someone who actually found my weird brain entertaining? What if I didn‚Äôt have to overthink every word before saying it because they just *get* me?

# Craving Connection Beyond My Imagination

I know I can‚Äôt be the only one who feels this way. There‚Äôs something about real human connection that no amount of internal dialogue can replace. I want a friend who can laugh at my random theories, someone who won‚Äôt judge me for knowing too much about conspiracy theories or spending way too much time analyzing movie endings.

I want those 2 AM conversations where we talk about everything and nothing. I want a friend who sends me memes that make me snort-laugh and who doesn‚Äôt mind when I randomly disappear for a day because I need to recharge.

# Conversations with My Future Best Friend

In my head, I‚Äôve already imagined the kind of friend I need. She‚Äôs funny, maybe a little weird like me, and has a dark sense of humor that makes even the most awkward situations bearable. We‚Äôd talk about life, crush on fictional characters, and probably spend hours debating whether aliens are real.

**Me:**

* ‚ÄúSo, if you had to survive a zombie apocalypse with one celebrity, who would it be?‚Äù

**Future Friend:**

* ‚ÄúDuh, Keanu Reeves. Have you *seen* John Wick?‚Äù

Me:

* ‚ÄúI knew I liked you.‚Äù

But instead of living that dream, I‚Äôm stuck talking to my own brain, which, let‚Äôs be honest, isn‚Äôt nearly as fun as a real conversation.

# The Fear of Reaching Out

Here‚Äôs where things get tricky. I *want* a friend, but reaching out feels‚Ä¶ terrifying. What if I‚Äôm too weird? What if I overshare and scare them off? What if they‚Äôre just not interested in my random thoughts about life?

My brain, of course, loves to feed on that fear. It convinces me that staying in my comfort zone is safer, that I don‚Äôt *need* anyone, and that solitude is just as fulfilling as real friendship. But I know that‚Äôs a lie.

# Breaking the Cycle

So, here I am, writing this out like some kind of therapy session with myself (because, surprise, surprise ‚Äî my brain insisted). But maybe putting this out into the universe will change something. Maybe someone out there will read this and think, ‚ÄúHey, that sounds like me!‚Äù Maybe this is my weird, rambling way of saying, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs be friends before I lose my mind from talking to myself.‚Äù

# Why I Need a Friend

I don‚Äôt need someone to fix me or solve all my problems. I just need someone to remind me that I‚Äôm not alone in this chaotic world. I need someone who can match my weird energy, someone who understands that sometimes I just need to rant about life and other times I need complete silence.

I need a friend who doesn‚Äôt mind my overthinking, who can deal with my occasional existential crisis, and who‚Äôs cool with randomly disappearing because *social battery drained*. In return, I promise to be the kind of friend who will hype you up, send you memes at 2 AM, and be there when you need someone to talk to.

# The Dream of Finding ‚ÄúMy Person‚Äù

I know friendships don‚Äôt happen overnight, and finding that one person who just *gets* me is like finding a needle in a haystack. But I‚Äôm willing to put myself out there, awkwardness and all, because I know how much I need that connection.

\*\*\*I male a male but the rest is true...Coz nobody will see if its a male posting this...\*\*\*

So, here‚Äôs to hoping that one day, I‚Äôll have someone to share my thoughts with ‚Äî someone who can silence the endless chatter in my brain, even if just for a moment. Until then, I‚Äôll keep yapping away, waiting for that friend who turns my inner monologue into a real conversation.

I wanted to share my experience with cluster headaches and see if anyone else has gone through something similar.

I‚Äôve been dealing with very mild cluster headaches since my teenage years‚Äîmaybe one every six months. They were barely noticeable and usually went away within an hour. But things changed about three years ago when I moved from a sunny country (8 months of sun per year) to a much colder, cloudier place where we‚Äôre lucky to get 2 months of decent sun.

After moving, my headaches started happening every couple of weeks instead of once every few months or sometimes years, and the intensity increased a bit. But the real shift happened when I quit smoking tobacco (2 years ago almost). That‚Äôs when my cluster headaches became significantly worse. They went from moderate to severe, starting weekly and now happening every other day.

Right now, I use sumatriptan injections (extremely effective), but I try to avoid them unless absolutely necessary because of the side effects when they kick in. The one thing that helps me with moderate attacks is a large coffee‚Äîit usually stops the attack within 5-10 minutes.

Has anyone else experienced a change in their cluster headaches after moving to a different climate or quitting smoking? I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts or any advice on managing them better.",0,1742386293.0,ClusterHeadaches,0,0.5,False

Part I

Chapter 1: The Arrival in Occupied Greece

‚∏ª

The Junkers JU-52 trembled in the unforgiving Greek air, its three BMW 132 engines grumbling under the weight of the cargo they carried. Johann Bachmann sat in the dim, sweat-slicked cabin, his back stiff against the worn, metal seat. The plane rattled like a tin can in a storm, a deep hum reverberating through the fuselage as the Mediterranean sky churned below them. He glanced out the porthole, his eyes tracing the jagged mountain ridges and sparse olive groves below. The patchwork of land looked deceptively peaceful. But peace hadn‚Äôt touched Greece in months.

The Luftwaffe pilot, his face unreadable beneath the dark rim of his cap, adjusted the throttle, banking the plane to the left. Johann clenched his jaw, reminding himself to breathe. The turbulence jostled the plane, sending a wave of heat over him. He was used to it, the discomfort, the claustrophobia of deep cover. He was a man who had learned to stay silent, to blend in. But even now, despite his training, the feeling of being swallowed by the war gnawed at him.

Bachmann‚Äôs hand drifted to the uniform he wore‚Äîblack SS tunic, iron cross pinned to his chest, the totenkopf insignia gleaming against the dim interior light. He was an officer of the Reich now, a high-ranking SS Oberst, though that was far from the truth. His real allegiance was not to the Nazis, but to a greater cause‚Äîhis mission was to infiltrate, gather intelligence for the OSS, and, if necessary, destroy from within.

He shifted his weight, careful not to draw attention to his unease. The others in the cabin didn‚Äôt seem to notice. A handful of Luftwaffe officers sat nearby, exchanging idle chatter in low voices. A grizzled Wehrmacht colonel, his Iron Cross First Class hanging heavy against his chest, dozed with his head tilted against the bulkhead. A pair of SS officers, each one as rigid and self-assured as the uniform they wore, sat across from him, arms folded in arrogance, their gazes occasionally flicking toward him with thinly veiled suspicion.

Johann had been in the uniform for twenty-eight days. Long enough to know that the SS didn‚Äôt trust one another‚Äîleast of all outsiders. It was a brutal machine, and no one was ever fully inside, no matter how deep they went. He couldn‚Äôt afford to falter now, not when his mission was just beginning.

The plane jolted again, and the view outside shifted as they descended. The jagged peaks of the Greek mountains gave way to the flat stretches of earth below. A scattering of smoke rose in the distance, curling black against the pale horizon.

‚ÄúNot long now, Oberst,‚Äù one of the SS officers said, his voice smooth with the quiet self-assurance of a man used to power. ‚ÄúNervous?‚Äù

Johann‚Äôs lips twisted into the faintest of smiles. ‚ÄúIf I were nervous, I wouldn‚Äôt be here.‚Äù

The officer nodded, though his eyes lingered on him for a moment longer than necessary. The subtle scrutiny was something Johann had grown used to in his line of work. The SS had many eyes, and the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) had even more. He could almost feel the weight of their suspicion bearing down on him.

Another lurch shook the plane, this one more violent than the rest, and for a moment, Johann thought one of the engines might give out. But the pilot adjusted swiftly, bringing the plane back on course as it approached the airstrip outside Athens.

The plane touched down with a rough bump, the wheels screeching against the dirt as they skidded to a halt. Johann exhaled sharply as the engines sputtered and died, the sounds of the machine slowly fading into the stillness of the occupied land.

The rear hatch swung open with a groan, and Johann stood, adjusting the sleek black leather gloves that had become as much a part of him as the uniform itself. His boots thudded on the tarmac as he disembarked, the weight of the mission pressing down on him with each step. The air was dry, hot, with the faint scent of salt carried on the breeze from the Aegean Sea. The stark contrast of the whitewashed buildings and the grim reality of war hit him all at once‚ÄîGreek villages dotted with the charred remains of resistance attacks, the soft rumble of soldiers marching in unison, their boots a familiar sound, sharp and commanding.

He wasn‚Äôt here to observe. He wasn‚Äôt here to mourn. He was here for one thing: to uncover the Reich‚Äôs secret, to dismantle it from within, and to come out the other side alive.

The convoy waited for him‚Äîthree K√ºbelwagens, engines idling, flanked by SS soldiers standing stiff at attention. The sun was low now, casting long shadows across the cracked concrete.

And there, standing just a few feet away, was the man who would be his contact in Greece: Hauptsturmf√ºhrer Karl Drexler.

Drexler looked exactly as Johann had expected‚Äîsilver hair, steely blue eyes, and a face that had been worn down by years of discipline and cruelty. His handshake was firm, the fingers pressing just a bit too hard, as if testing the strength of his new subordinate.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard much about you, Oberst Bachmann,‚Äù Drexler said with a smile that didn‚Äôt quite reach his eyes.

Johann gave a slight bow. ‚ÄúGood things, I hope.‚Äù

A thin, humorless smile flickered across Drexler‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúWe shall see.‚Äù

Behind Drexler, the chateau loomed‚Äîan imposing structure, half a century old, with grand white stone columns, ivy creeping over the walls. It had once been home to aristocracy, but now it served as the nerve center of the SS‚Äôs operations in the region.

And as Johann‚Äôs eyes swept over the courtyard, his gaze landed on her.

Anna Reinhardt.

She stood on the steps, an almost serene figure in a grey SS-Helferinnen uniform. Black hair pulled back in a precise bun, her stance perfect, radiating an icy detachment. There was a cigarette in one hand, though it burned slowly as if she were not particularly concerned with it. Johann‚Äôs eyes traced her, unable to look away, as she regarded him silently from across the courtyard.

Something about her unnerved him. She was not like the others here. Her composure was absolute, her silence a challenge. She was dangerous, he could tell. Not because of her weapon or position‚Äîbut because she was playing a game Johann had yet to understand.

Their eyes met briefly. She didn‚Äôt smile. She didn‚Äôt nod. She simply stared, as though sizing him up, then turned and disappeared into the chateau.

Drexler gestured toward the entrance. ‚ÄúCome. We have much to discuss.‚Äù

Chapter 2: The Chessboard of Occupation

‚∏ª

Johann sat across from Drexler in the chateau‚Äôs dining hall, his back straight as the SS officer spoke with his usual calm authority. The grand room was filled with the clatter of silverware against porcelain, the flickering glow of candlelight casting long shadows on the high stone walls. The air was thick with cigarette smoke and the scent of roasted lamb. The officers around him laughed too loudly, celebrating the success of their mission, yet there was an underlying tension that cut through the festivity.

Johann‚Äôs mind was elsewhere, focusing on what lay beneath the chateau‚Äôs luxurious exterior. There was more to this place than he‚Äôd been told. The quiet whispers of ‚ÄúMerry Christmas‚Äù had begun circulating among the officers, but he had yet to gather any hard intelligence. Drexler was playing the game, but Johann knew better than to assume the role he was being offered‚Äîhe had a larger plan in mind.

Drexler leaned back in his chair, his gaze scanning the room with a practiced, almost disinterested eye.

‚ÄúTell me, Oberst,‚Äù he said, his voice low, ‚Äúhow does one survive in a place like this?‚Äù

Johann met his gaze, keeping his face impassive. ‚ÄúBy staying useful, Herr Hauptsturmf√ºhrer.‚Äù

Drexler chuckled softly, his blue eyes gleaming with a cold amusement. ‚ÄúI do enjoy the direct approach.‚Äù

Johann barely registered the words. He could feel Anna‚Äôs presence across the table. Her eyes had never left him since he entered, though she had yet to speak. She sat just beyond Drexler, one hand delicately holding a glass of Metaxa, the Greek brandy, her fingers barely touching the rim. She hadn‚Äôt spoken since their brief exchange at the entrance, but her gaze, as cool and precise as a surgeon‚Äôs scalpel, lingered on him. As if she was dissecting his every move.

She hadn‚Äôt smiled when she looked at him earlier, but her eyes had done something more. There was something calculating behind them‚Äîa sharp intelligence that Johann couldn‚Äôt help but recognize. And something else. A flicker of doubt.

The others continued to talk‚Äîpolitics, victories, the usual war banalities‚Äîbut Johann found his attention drifting back to Anna, as it had been all evening. Her silence was more commanding than Drexler‚Äôs constant chatter. When she finally broke her gaze to look at Drexler, it was brief, but Johann noticed. The way her jaw tightened slightly.

He couldn‚Äôt help but ask, in a voice barely above a whisper, ‚ÄúDo you ever tire of the performance?‚Äù

Anna‚Äôs eyes flicked to him. A slight smile tugged at the corner of her lips, but there was no warmth in it. She set down her drink with deliberate care, the ice clinking in the glass.

‚ÄúYou think this is a performance?‚Äù Her voice was soft, yet dangerous in its calmness. ‚ÄúWhat would you call it?‚Äù

‚ÄúSurvival,‚Äù Johann replied, his tone matching hers.

For a moment, the room seemed to fall away. The laughter, the clinking of glass, the chatter‚Äîit all faded into the background. It was just the two of them, locked in a silent exchange. Drexler, oblivious to the shift in energy, continued speaking to a nearby officer, unaware of the unspoken words hanging between Johann and Anna.

Anna leaned forward just slightly, her eyes narrowing as she studied him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been surviving for a long time, Oberst. Much longer than you think.‚Äù

The weight of her words pressed against him, though he didn‚Äôt show it. There was something in her eyes‚Äîa hidden depth of experience, a life lived under the yoke of a war machine she hadn‚Äôt chosen. She wasn‚Äôt a true believer in the Reich. He could see it now. But neither was she a rebel. She had simply learned to play by the rules of a game that had long since stopped making sense.

Before he could reply, a burst of laughter interrupted the moment, and the tension between them dissolved. Johann took a sip from his glass, his mind racing with possibilities. He had expected Anna to be a threat, but now he realized she was a puzzle. One that might be more difficult to solve than he had first thought.

As the evening wore on, Johann kept his distance from the officers, his eyes returning to Anna every so often. It was clear that Drexler didn‚Äôt trust him‚Äîhe could feel it in the way Drexler watched him‚Äîbut it was Anna who intrigued him. She was a weapon in her own right, yes, but she was also something more. The way she held herself, the way she observed, was unlike anything he had seen in other officers.

‚∏ª

Later That Evening: The Quiet Confrontation

As the officers moved into the adjoining room for cigars and more brandy, Johann excused himself. He needed air. There were questions gnawing at him, things he couldn‚Äôt ignore anymore. He had seen too much, heard too many whispers, to pretend everything was fine.

The courtyard outside the dining hall was quiet, the only sounds the distant clink of rifle butts against stone and the faint murmur of conversation from within. Johann leaned against the cold stone of the wall, the night air doing little to cool the heat in his chest.

The moment stretched on, and then‚Äîsoft footsteps. A shadow crossed the courtyard, and Johann turned to find Anna standing a few feet away. She hadn‚Äôt changed out of her uniform, though she had removed the armband. Her eyes met his without hesitation.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt seem the type to take part in their little show,‚Äù she said, her voice low but clear in the quiet of the night.

Johann didn‚Äôt reply immediately. Instead, he took a step forward, his gaze locking with hers. ‚ÄúAnd you?‚Äù he asked, his voice carrying a subtle edge. ‚ÄúWhat makes you think you‚Äôre any different?‚Äù

She tilted her head slightly, an almost imperceptible smile playing on her lips. ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôll find that I‚Äôm far different from them.‚Äù

For the first time since he had arrived at the chateau, Johann saw a flicker of vulnerability in her eyes. A momentary crack in the perfect fa√ßade she had built.

The words hung in the air between them, thick with unspoken meaning. Then, she turned, her posture stiff and unyielding once more.

‚ÄúDo what you must, Oberst,‚Äù she said, her voice returning to its usual coldness. ‚ÄúBut remember‚Äîthis is not a game.‚Äù

Chapter 3: The True Face of the Reich

‚∏ª

The next day, Johann awoke to the sound of distant artillery fire. He couldn‚Äôt tell whether it was real or imagined‚Äîhe had been in the war too long to know anymore. The bed he slept in was as sterile as the walls of the chateau, a cold reminder of the purpose of his stay here. He was no longer in the war for duty. He was in it for survival. And the longer he stayed in the clutches of the Reich, the more he felt the noose tightening around him.

The war outside was moving forward, but here in the chateau, everything was still. The floors gleamed in the daylight, and the servants went about their work with quiet, perfect efficiency. It was a world where nothing seemed real, where even the deepest horrors could be hidden behind the pristine walls of the Reich‚Äôs machine.

Johann‚Äôs mission, however, was painfully real. He had to stop ‚ÄúMerry Christmas‚Äù‚Äîthe project that, if completed, would ensure the Reich‚Äôs dominance. He didn‚Äôt know much yet, but the whispers from the officers spoke of a machine, a biological experiment of monstrous proportions. The name, ‚ÄúMerry Christmas,‚Äù sent a cold shiver down his spine. What kind of sick, twisted irony had given birth to such a project? It was as if the Nazis had taken everything sacred about the holiday‚Äîfamily, peace, joy‚Äîand turned it into something unrecognizable.

At breakfast, Johann was joined by Karl Drexler and a few officers, each discussing the usual war matters. Their conversation felt rehearsed, as if they were pretending to be human, playing roles that had long ago been drained of meaning. Drexler, ever the commanding officer, spoke with a level of detachment that irritated Johann. It was the way Drexler looked at people‚Äîlike they were things to be used, manipulated.

As Johann took his seat, he caught a glimpse of Anna through the open dining hall doors. She stood at the far end of the hall, talking to a German officer. Her posture was impeccable, and her cold eyes flitted over her conversation partner with an air of control that struck Johann as almost mechanical.

But there was more to her than this. Johann was certain of it now. He had caught glimpses of the real Anna‚Äîmoments of hesitation, uncertainty‚Äîthat no one else had noticed. He couldn‚Äôt put it into words yet, but he was beginning to see the cracks in the perfect fa√ßade she wore.

Drexler noticed Johann‚Äôs gaze and followed it toward Anna. His lips twisted in a smile, a knowing, mocking smile that Johann recognized all too well.

‚ÄúAh, Anna,‚Äù Drexler said casually. ‚ÄúThe Reich‚Äôs perfect soldier, isn‚Äôt she?‚Äù

Johann stiffened. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs her role here?‚Äù

Drexler leaned back in his chair, taking a slow sip of his coffee. ‚ÄúAnna Reinhardt is a special case, Oberst. A success of the ‚ÄòMerry Christmas‚Äô program. They‚Äôve been working on her for years.‚Äù

Johann‚Äôs brow furrowed. ‚ÄúA ‚Äòsuccess‚Äô?‚Äù

Drexler‚Äôs smile was tight. ‚ÄúThe program‚Äôs goal is simple‚Äîperfect soldiers, without the flaws of human weakness. Anna is our first success. She‚Äôs been made for this.‚Äù

Johann tried to mask his shock. He had suspected the project was some kind of twisted genetic or biological experiment, but hearing it confirmed hit him harder than expected. They had done this to her. They had made her, shaped her into something‚Ä¶ unnatural.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not human?‚Äù Johann asked, his voice low.

Drexler‚Äôs eyes gleamed with satisfaction. ‚ÄúOh, she‚Äôs human, alright. But she‚Äôs been conditioned to be something else. She does what‚Äôs necessary, without hesitation. And that‚Äôs why she‚Äôs so valuable. She‚Äôs one of a kind.‚Äù

The words sank into Johann like poison. Anna wasn‚Äôt just a soldier in the war. She was an experiment, a tool, a weapon. But something inside Johann refused to believe that‚Äôs all she was. He had seen her. He had heard her voice. He had felt the hesitation in her gaze the night before. She wasn‚Äôt just a machine.

But the thought lingered in his mind‚Äîhow much of her was truly human?

‚∏ª

Later that day, Johann found himself walking down the quiet hallways of the chateau, unable to shake the conversation with Drexler. The cold, sterile air of the chateau seemed to press against him as he passed rooms locked with heavy, rusted doors. He had seen the look in Drexler‚Äôs eyes when he spoke about Anna‚Äîa gleam of pride mixed with something darker, something almost possessive. Johann wondered if Drexler knew just how much of a lie the whole thing was. Could Drexler see that Anna was not a weapon to be wielded, but a person with her own mind, her own pain?

He didn‚Äôt have long to ponder these questions. As he turned a corner, he spotted her. Anna Reinhardt stood at the far end of the hall, her back straight, her eyes fixed ahead. She didn‚Äôt seem to notice him at first. Her expression was cold, calculating. But as Johann approached, her gaze flickered toward him, and she stopped.

‚ÄúI was wondering when you‚Äôd come looking for me,‚Äù Anna said softly, her voice as precise as ever.

Johann stood still for a moment, surprised by how direct she was. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a difficult person to find,‚Äù he replied, his voice betraying none of his internal confusion.

Anna gave a small, almost imperceptible nod. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not difficult to find. I‚Äôm just difficult to approach.‚Äù

Johann couldn‚Äôt help but chuckle at that. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt make it easy.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo one here does,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs how things work in places like this.‚Äù

Her eyes briefly flickered to the floor, and for the first time, Johann noticed a subtle shift in her demeanor. It was small, almost imperceptible, but it was there. Something vulnerable. Something real.

‚ÄúI heard what Drexler said about you,‚Äù Johann said, his voice low, careful.

Anna stiffened, her posture straightening once more. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure he told you exactly what he wanted you to hear.‚Äù

Johann took a step closer, his voice dropping even lower. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs all you are, Anna. Not just some project, some‚Ä¶ weapon.‚Äù

Her eyes flickered, and for a brief moment, Johann thought he saw something‚Äîsomething like guilt or uncertainty‚Äîflash in her expression.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre wrong,‚Äù she said, the coldness returning to her voice. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm exactly what they made me to be.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Johann replied, taking another step toward her. ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôve been something more all along. You‚Äôve just been hiding it.‚Äù

Anna didn‚Äôt reply immediately. Instead, she turned and began walking down the hallway, her boots clicking against the polished floor. Johann followed, reluctant but compelled.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre wrong about that too,‚Äù she said after a long silence. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been hiding nothing. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ the world doesn‚Äôt let people like me show what‚Äôs inside.‚Äù

Johann caught up with her, his heart pounding in his chest. There was something she wasn‚Äôt saying, something she had buried deep within her, but Johann wasn‚Äôt sure if he wanted to know the answer. He wasn‚Äôt sure if he could handle the truth.

As they reached the entrance to the underground facility, Anna stopped. She turned toward him, her eyes meeting his for a brief, tense moment.

‚ÄúDo you really think you can change all this, Johann?‚Äù she asked quietly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre here for a reason. But so am I. We‚Äôre both trapped in this.‚Äù

Her voice cracked just a little, and Johann finally saw it‚Äîthe smallest fracture in her armor. He didn‚Äôt know what to say, didn‚Äôt know how to answer.

But before he could speak, Anna stepped past him, her back straight once again.

‚ÄúGet used to the game,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all you‚Äôll ever have.‚Äù

Chapter 4: Beneath the Surface

‚∏ª

The chateau seemed quieter the next morning, as if the walls themselves were holding their breath, waiting for something to happen. Johann moved through the halls with his usual calm, his boots muffled against the cold stone floors. The night‚Äôs conversation with Anna still hung in the back of his mind, gnawing at him. Her words echoed with a lingering weight. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre both trapped in this,‚Äù she had said.

His mind was still trying to piece together the enigma that was Anna Reinhardt‚Äîso perfectly poised, so coldly efficient, and yet, in her eyes, something stirred. It wasn‚Äôt just the machine inside her. It was the remnants of a person who had been buried beneath the layers of training, conditioning, and command. She wasn‚Äôt just a soldier. Johann could feel it. But he didn‚Äôt know what she was yet.

The mornings here were always the same‚Äîquiet, methodical. Officers gathered for breakfast, speaking in clipped tones, discussing tactics and plans as though the world outside was a chessboard, every move calculated and decisive. Johann wasn‚Äôt paying attention to the conversation. His mind was elsewhere, toying with a growing sense of urgency. The ‚ÄúMerry Christmas‚Äù project was becoming more than just whispers now. He needed more than just a vague name. He needed to see it, to understand what the Reich had built in secret, what they had done to Anna.

His task was clear‚Äîget inside the heart of the operation, sabotage it, and get out. But everything felt complicated now. The lines between right and wrong had become muddied with each passing day, each stolen moment with Anna, each crack in her icy exterior.

The others at the table barely noticed him, their voices fading into the background as he watched Anna from the corner of his eye. She wasn‚Äôt sitting with the officers today. Instead, she stood near the window, watching the distant hills with a look of detached curiosity. The sun was still low, casting long shadows across the valley, but something about the way she looked out at the landscape felt‚Ä¶ wrong. It was as if she was waiting for something to come‚Äîsomething inevitable.

Johann stood abruptly, excusing himself with a curt nod. He needed to act. He couldn‚Äôt wait any longer.

As he made his way through the chateau‚Äôs vast hallways, he passed the occasional officer, all wrapped up in their own concerns, their own ambitions. No one noticed him‚Äînot yet. Johann made his way toward the one place he had been meaning to visit: the underground facility where ‚ÄúMerry Christmas‚Äù was being hidden. The air felt different as he approached the stairwell leading down to the lower levels. It was thick, tense.

The door at the bottom of the stairs was guarded by two SS soldiers. They barely acknowledged his presence as he passed by, just the usual formal nods, as if they were used to seeing the high-ranking officers come and go. But the closer he got to the main control room, the heavier the air seemed to get.

He had seen files‚Äîredacted, incomplete, but enough to give him an idea of what he was dealing with. Biological experiments. Genetic manipulation. The creation of soldiers who never questioned orders, who never hesitated, who could be controlled. The word ‚Äúprototype‚Äù appeared frequently in the reports. But no one had said what that meant, not in plain words.

The steel door creaked open, and Johann stepped into the sterile, fluorescent-lit room. The smell of chemicals and antiseptic immediately hit him, thick and overpowering. But it wasn‚Äôt just the scent‚Äîit was the feeling. The feeling of something terrible being hidden here, something that should never have been allowed to breathe.

Inside, a group of technicians worked in quiet, focused silence, moving between various pieces of equipment, some of it unfamiliar to Johann. In the center of the room stood a large metal chamber, like a containment unit, complete with blinking lights and dials. Johann‚Äôs pulse quickened. He approached it slowly, trying not to seem too curious, though every instinct told him this was the heart of it all.

One of the technicians glanced up and nodded respectfully as Johann walked past, but didn‚Äôt say anything. Johann‚Äôs eyes fell on a clipboard resting on a nearby counter. He picked it up, scanning the notes quickly, his heart pounding in his chest.

‚ÄúEva-01‚Äîfirst successful prototype. Conditioning complete. Pending operational readiness.‚Äù

The words on the paper were a blow to his chest. Eva-01. Anna. She was part of this, created for this. But the word ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù made something inside Johann tighten. He understood now. She was more than just an officer. She had been made. Engineered.

His mind raced. This was the heart of the Reich‚Äôs most secret project. The one that would ensure they could fight a never-ending war‚Äîa machine that could print soldiers, soldiers who never questioned, who never hesitated. And Anna, for all her complexity, for all the cracks in her armor, was one of them. She had been made to serve, to kill.

The technician turned and caught Johann‚Äôs eye. ‚ÄúEverything is proceeding as planned, Oberst,‚Äù he said with an air of pride. ‚ÄúWe are only waiting for final authorization from Berlin before we begin the next stage.‚Äù

‚ÄúNext stage?‚Äù Johann asked, his voice carefully neutral.

The technician glanced at the chamber. ‚ÄúThe prototype will be deployed. Operational. Ready for war.‚Äù

Johann clenched his fists, a cold rage beginning to bubble in his chest. He wasn‚Äôt just going to dismantle a machine. He was going to free the people trapped inside it. Anna was a part of this machine, but she was also a victim. His mind flashed back to their conversation the night before, the brief moments when her guard had slipped. She didn‚Äôt belong here. None of them did.

Just as Johann turned to leave, a figure appeared in the doorway‚ÄîAnna. She was standing there, her eyes locked onto him, her posture perfect, but there was something different in her gaze. It wasn‚Äôt just the coldness anymore. There was an edge to it, something darker, more knowing.

‚ÄúEva-01?‚Äù Johann asked softly, his voice betraying none of the tumult inside him.

Anna‚Äôs eyes flickered, and for a moment, she almost seemed to soften. Almost. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been called worse things,‚Äù she replied, her voice a quiet echo in the sterile room. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs what they made me.‚Äù

Johann‚Äôs heart tightened in his chest, but he didn‚Äôt let it show. Instead, he walked toward her, the air between them thick with unspoken words.

‚ÄúNot everything about you was made,‚Äù Johann said softly, his voice low, as though sharing a secret no one else could hear. ‚ÄúAnd that is what makes you dangerous.‚Äù

Anna‚Äôs eyes narrowed, but there was no anger in her gaze. Only something else. Something far more dangerous. ‚ÄúDangerous?‚Äù she repeated, almost as though tasting the word on her tongue.

‚ÄúI mean to say,‚Äù Johann continued, stepping closer, his breath catching slightly, ‚Äúyou are still human.‚Äù

For a brief moment, a flicker of something passed across Anna‚Äôs face‚Äîsomething that looked like pain, but it was gone before Johann could read it.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what that means anymore,‚Äù she said, her voice a whisper. She turned and began to walk away, but before she reached the door, she paused. ‚ÄúRemember, Oberst. You‚Äôre in the belly of the beast now. You can‚Äôt escape it.‚Äù

I love the group and really admire their journey. I really want them to reach new heights and be much more popular. They deserve it! Sb19 songs have brilliant lyricism and deep meaning. I know all their songs and my favorites are the ballads specifically Liham and Ilaw. Their talent is undeniable. But let me be honest, most of their singles are not streamable. While I appluad the fans for dedication, they still need casual listeners to reach greater heights.

-Gento, despite being popular, have low stream numbers compared to other popular songs. It more of a dance and something people do not like to listen to when they are on a commute or just relaxing in a coffee shop.

- I honestly believe I Want You could have been a hit with the right promotion. It's my most streamed song from them! Yung kahit ilang ulit pakinggan everyday, hindi nakakasawa.

-Mapa is a ballad but it's not really something I like hearing anytime since I don't have good relationship with my parents. Ilaw as a single could have been big! The song is perfect and it also showcases their talent. Imagine it being promoted like how Dam was on national TV? They would have gained everyone's attention and admiration. Sadly, the masterpiece was not heard by everyone.

- I know they have their own music identity and di sila nakikisabay sa kung anong hype or mainstream. But they really deserve so much more recognition and respect. I'm not saying they should release a generic pop song or a bubblegum pop song, maybe, something relaxing and a chill slow song.

- WYAT, Moonlight, Ready, Kalakal are meh for me.

- What, Bazinga, Gento, and Dam are all in the same genre and while all of these are good songs, they are just not streamable. Akala tuloy ng iba, puro sigaw at galit ang kanta nila kasi nga yung mga singles ang usually sumisikat or napopromote. 

-Perhaps, I want a song from them like Drowning in the Water by Pablo or Surreal by Justin. Yung mapapakinggan mo anytime of the day. Since they have songs in different genres, why not try the uber saturated love songs these days? Unfortunately, yun talaga ang bet ng karamihan. At least just one song na tatatak talaga sa masa and through that, people will discover their brilliant songs by themselves.

- Will probably get downvoted but ""Dam"" is not just it for me :(( I dunno, despite the good message, ang weird pakinggan. Yes, I know, I could just find and listen to other artists if I do not like their new release or their genre but I'm really rooting for them. 

I hope they realease a hit song for this EP and have a big promotion for it. These men just deserve all the love and respect this country can give.

Chapter 1: The Arrival in Occupied Greece

‚∏ª

The Junkers JU-52 trembled in the unforgiving Greek air, its three BMW 132 engines grumbling under the weight of the cargo they carried. Johann Bachmann sat in the dim, sweat-slicked cabin, his back stiff against the worn, metal seat. The plane rattled like a tin can in a storm, a deep hum reverberating through the fuselage as the Mediterranean sky churned below them. He glanced out the porthole, his eyes tracing the jagged mountain ridges and sparse olive groves below. The patchwork of land looked deceptively peaceful. But peace hadn‚Äôt touched Greece in months.

The Luftwaffe pilot, his face unreadable beneath the dark rim of his cap, adjusted the throttle, banking the plane to the left. Johann clenched his jaw, reminding himself to breathe. The turbulence jostled the plane, sending a wave of heat over him. He was used to it, the discomfort, the claustrophobia of deep cover. He was a man who had learned to stay silent, to blend in. But even now, despite his training, the feeling of being swallowed by the war gnawed at him.

Bachmann‚Äôs hand drifted to the uniform he wore‚Äîblack SS tunic, iron cross pinned to his chest, the totenkopf insignia gleaming against the dim interior light. He was an officer of the Reich now, a high-ranking SS Oberst, though that was far from the truth. His real allegiance was not to the Nazis, but to a greater cause‚Äîhis mission was to infiltrate, gather intelligence for the OSS, and, if necessary, destroy from within.

He shifted his weight, careful not to draw attention to his unease. The others in the cabin didn‚Äôt seem to notice. A handful of Luftwaffe officers sat nearby, exchanging idle chatter in low voices. A grizzled Wehrmacht colonel, his Iron Cross First Class hanging heavy against his chest, dozed with his head tilted against the bulkhead. A pair of SS officers, each one as rigid and self-assured as the uniform they wore, sat across from him, arms folded in arrogance, their gazes occasionally flicking toward him with thinly veiled suspicion.

Johann had been in the uniform for twenty-eight days. Long enough to know that the SS didn‚Äôt trust one another‚Äîleast of all outsiders. It was a brutal machine, and no one was ever fully inside, no matter how deep they went. He couldn‚Äôt afford to falter now, not when his mission was just beginning.

The plane jolted again, and the view outside shifted as they descended. The jagged peaks of the Greek mountains gave way to the flat stretches of earth below. A scattering of smoke rose in the distance, curling black against the pale horizon.

‚ÄúNot long now, Oberst,‚Äù one of the SS officers said, his voice smooth with the quiet self-assurance of a man used to power. ‚ÄúNervous?‚Äù

Johann‚Äôs lips twisted into the faintest of smiles. ‚ÄúIf I were nervous, I wouldn‚Äôt be here.‚Äù

The officer nodded, though his eyes lingered on him for a moment longer than necessary. The subtle scrutiny was something Johann had grown used to in his line of work. The SS had many eyes, and the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) had even more. He could almost feel the weight of their suspicion bearing down on him.

Another lurch shook the plane, this one more violent than the rest, and for a moment, Johann thought one of the engines might give out. But the pilot adjusted swiftly, bringing the plane back on course as it approached the airstrip outside Athens.

The plane touched down with a rough bump, the wheels screeching against the dirt as they skidded to a halt. Johann exhaled sharply as the engines sputtered and died, the sounds of the machine slowly fading into the stillness of the occupied land.

The rear hatch swung open with a groan, and Johann stood, adjusting the sleek black leather gloves that had become as much a part of him as the uniform itself. His boots thudded on the tarmac as he disembarked, the weight of the mission pressing down on him with each step. The air was dry, hot, with the faint scent of salt carried on the breeze from the Aegean Sea. The stark contrast of the whitewashed buildings and the grim reality of war hit him all at once‚ÄîGreek villages dotted with the charred remains of resistance attacks, the soft rumble of soldiers marching in unison, their boots a familiar sound, sharp and commanding.

He wasn‚Äôt here to observe. He wasn‚Äôt here to mourn. He was here for one thing: to uncover the Reich‚Äôs secret, to dismantle it from within, and to come out the other side alive.

The convoy waited for him‚Äîthree K√ºbelwagens, engines idling, flanked by SS soldiers standing stiff at attention. The sun was low now, casting long shadows across the cracked concrete.

And there, standing just a few feet away, was the man who would be his contact in Greece: Hauptsturmf√ºhrer Karl Drexler.

Drexler looked exactly as Johann had expected‚Äîsilver hair, steely blue eyes, and a face that had been worn down by years of discipline and cruelty. His handshake was firm, the fingers pressing just a bit too hard, as if testing the strength of his new subordinate.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard much about you, Oberst Bachmann,‚Äù Drexler said with a smile that didn‚Äôt quite reach his eyes.

Johann gave a slight bow. ‚ÄúGood things, I hope.‚Äù

A thin, humorless smile flickered across Drexler‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúWe shall see.‚Äù

Behind Drexler, the chateau loomed‚Äîan imposing structure, half a century old, with grand white stone columns, ivy creeping over the walls. It had once been home to aristocracy, but now it served as the nerve center of the SS‚Äôs operations in the region.

And as Johann‚Äôs eyes swept over the courtyard, his gaze landed on her.

Anna Reinhardt.

She stood on the steps, an almost serene figure in a grey SS-Helferinnen uniform. Black hair pulled back in a precise bun, her stance perfect, radiating an icy detachment. There was a cigarette in one hand, though it burned slowly as if she were not particularly concerned with it. Johann‚Äôs eyes traced her, unable to look away, as she regarded him silently from across the courtyard.

Something about her unnerved him. She was not like the others here. Her composure was absolute, her silence a challenge. She was dangerous, he could tell. Not because of her weapon or position‚Äîbut because she was playing a game Johann had yet to understand.

Their eyes met briefly. She didn‚Äôt smile. She didn‚Äôt nod. She simply stared, as though sizing him up, then turned and disappeared into the chateau.

Drexler gestured toward the entrance. ‚ÄúCome. We have much to discuss.‚Äù

Chapter 2: The Chessboard of Occupation

‚∏ª

Johann sat across from Drexler in the chateau‚Äôs dining hall, his back straight as the SS officer spoke with his usual calm authority. The grand room was filled with the clatter of silverware against porcelain, the flickering glow of candlelight casting long shadows on the high stone walls. The air was thick with cigarette smoke and the scent of roasted lamb. The officers around him laughed too loudly, celebrating the success of their mission, yet there was an underlying tension that cut through the festivity.

Johann‚Äôs mind was elsewhere, focusing on what lay beneath the chateau‚Äôs luxurious exterior. There was more to this place than he‚Äôd been told. The quiet whispers of ‚ÄúMerry Christmas‚Äù had begun circulating among the officers, but he had yet to gather any hard intelligence. Drexler was playing the game, but Johann knew better than to assume the role he was being offered‚Äîhe had a larger plan in mind.

Drexler leaned back in his chair, his gaze scanning the room with a practiced, almost disinterested eye.

‚ÄúTell me, Oberst,‚Äù he said, his voice low, ‚Äúhow does one survive in a place like this?‚Äù

Johann met his gaze, keeping his face impassive. ‚ÄúBy staying useful, Herr Hauptsturmf√ºhrer.‚Äù

Drexler chuckled softly, his blue eyes gleaming with a cold amusement. ‚ÄúI do enjoy the direct approach.‚Äù

Johann barely registered the words. He could feel Anna‚Äôs presence across the table. Her eyes had never left him since he entered, though she had yet to speak. She sat just beyond Drexler, one hand delicately holding a glass of Metaxa, the Greek brandy, her fingers barely touching the rim. She hadn‚Äôt spoken since their brief exchange at the entrance, but her gaze, as cool and precise as a surgeon‚Äôs scalpel, lingered on him. As if she was dissecting his every move.

She hadn‚Äôt smiled when she looked at him earlier, but her eyes had done something more. There was something calculating behind them‚Äîa sharp intelligence that Johann couldn‚Äôt help but recognize. And something else. A flicker of doubt.

The others continued to talk‚Äîpolitics, victories, the usual war banalities‚Äîbut Johann found his attention drifting back to Anna, as it had been all evening. Her silence was more commanding than Drexler‚Äôs constant chatter. When she finally broke her gaze to look at Drexler, it was brief, but Johann noticed. The way her jaw tightened slightly.

He couldn‚Äôt help but ask, in a voice barely above a whisper, ‚ÄúDo you ever tire of the performance?‚Äù

Anna‚Äôs eyes flicked to him. A slight smile tugged at the corner of her lips, but there was no warmth in it. She set down her drink with deliberate care, the ice clinking in the glass.

‚ÄúYou think this is a performance?‚Äù Her voice was soft, yet dangerous in its calmness. ‚ÄúWhat would you call it?‚Äù

‚ÄúSurvival,‚Äù Johann replied, his tone matching hers.

For a moment, the room seemed to fall away. The laughter, the clinking of glass, the chatter‚Äîit all faded into the background. It was just the two of them, locked in a silent exchange. Drexler, oblivious to the shift in energy, continued speaking to a nearby officer, unaware of the unspoken words hanging between Johann and Anna.

Anna leaned forward just slightly, her eyes narrowing as she studied him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been surviving for a long time, Oberst. Much longer than you think.‚Äù

The weight of her words pressed against him, though he didn‚Äôt show it. There was something in her eyes‚Äîa hidden depth of experience, a life lived under the yoke of a war machine she hadn‚Äôt chosen. She wasn‚Äôt a true believer in the Reich. He could see it now. But neither was she a rebel. She had simply learned to play by the rules of a game that had long since stopped making sense.

Before he could reply, a burst of laughter interrupted the moment, and the tension between them dissolved. Johann took a sip from his glass, his mind racing with possibilities. He had expected Anna to be a threat, but now he realized she was a puzzle. One that might be more difficult to solve than he had first thought.

As the evening wore on, Johann kept his distance from the officers, his eyes returning to Anna every so often. It was clear that Drexler didn‚Äôt trust him‚Äîhe could feel it in the way Drexler watched him‚Äîbut it was Anna who intrigued him. She was a weapon in her own right, yes, but she was also something more. The way she held herself, the way she observed, was unlike anything he had seen in other officers.

‚∏ª

Later That Evening: The Quiet Confrontation

As the officers moved into the adjoining room for cigars and more brandy, Johann excused himself. He needed air. There were questions gnawing at him, things he couldn‚Äôt ignore anymore. He had seen too much, heard too many whispers, to pretend everything was fine.

The courtyard outside the dining hall was quiet, the only sounds the distant clink of rifle butts against stone and the faint murmur of conversation from within. Johann leaned against the cold stone of the wall, the night air doing little to cool the heat in his chest.

The moment stretched on, and then‚Äîsoft footsteps. A shadow crossed the courtyard, and Johann turned to find Anna standing a few feet away. She hadn‚Äôt changed out of her uniform, though she had removed the armband. Her eyes met his without hesitation.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt seem the type to take part in their little show,‚Äù she said, her voice low but clear in the quiet of the night.

Johann didn‚Äôt reply immediately. Instead, he took a step forward, his gaze locking with hers. ‚ÄúAnd you?‚Äù he asked, his voice carrying a subtle edge. ‚ÄúWhat makes you think you‚Äôre any different?‚Äù

She tilted her head slightly, an almost imperceptible smile playing on her lips. ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôll find that I‚Äôm far different from them.‚Äù

For the first time since he had arrived at the chateau, Johann saw a flicker of vulnerability in her eyes. A momentary crack in the perfect fa√ßade she had built.

The words hung in the air between them, thick with unspoken meaning. Then, she turned, her posture stiff and unyielding once more.

‚ÄúDo what you must, Oberst,‚Äù she said, her voice returning to its usual coldness. ‚ÄúBut remember‚Äîthis is not a game.‚Äù

End of Chapter 2

‚∏ª

This chapter continues to build tension between Johann and Anna while hinting at Anna‚Äôs internal struggle and Johann‚Äôs growing suspicions about the true nature of the Nazi project. We get a deeper sense of their personalities and the psychological chess game that‚Äôs beginning to unfold. Would you like to continue exploring their complicated relationship in the next chapters?

Certainly! Here‚Äôs Chapter 3, where the stakes grow higher, Johann and Anna‚Äôs relationship deepens, and the true horrors of the ‚ÄúMerry Christmas‚Äù project begin to take shape.

‚∏ª

Chapter 3: The True Face of the Reich

‚∏ª

The next day, Johann awoke to the sound of distant artillery fire. He couldn‚Äôt tell whether it was real or imagined‚Äîhe had been in the war too long to know anymore. The bed he slept in was as sterile as the walls of the chateau, a cold reminder of the purpose of his stay here. He was no longer in the war for duty. He was in it for survival. And the longer he stayed in the clutches of the Reich, the more he felt the noose tightening around him.

The war outside was moving forward, but here in the chateau, everything was still. The floors gleamed in the daylight, and the servants went about their work with quiet, perfect efficiency. It was a world where nothing seemed real, where even the deepest horrors could be hidden behind the pristine walls of the Reich‚Äôs machine.

Johann‚Äôs mission, however, was painfully real. He had to stop ‚ÄúMerry Christmas‚Äù‚Äîthe project that, if completed, would ensure the Reich‚Äôs dominance. He didn‚Äôt know much yet, but the whispers from the officers spoke of a machine, a biological experiment of monstrous proportions. The name, ‚ÄúMerry Christmas,‚Äù sent a cold shiver down his spine. What kind of sick, twisted irony had given birth to such a project? It was as if the Nazis had taken everything sacred about the holiday‚Äîfamily, peace, joy‚Äîand turned it into something unrecognizable.

At breakfast, Johann was joined by Karl Drexler and a few officers, each discussing the usual war matters. Their conversation felt rehearsed, as if they were pretending to be human, playing roles that had long ago been drained of meaning. Drexler, ever the commanding officer, spoke with a level of detachment that irritated Johann. It was the way Drexler looked at people‚Äîlike they were things to be used, manipulated.

As Johann took his seat, he caught a glimpse of Anna through the open dining hall doors. She stood at the far end of the hall, talking to a German officer. Her posture was impeccable, and her cold eyes flitted over her conversation partner with an air of control that struck Johann as almost mechanical.

But there was more to her than this. Johann was certain of it now. He had caught glimpses of the real Anna‚Äîmoments of hesitation, uncertainty‚Äîthat no one else had noticed. He couldn‚Äôt put it into words yet, but he was beginning to see the cracks in the perfect fa√ßade she wore.

Drexler noticed Johann‚Äôs gaze and followed it toward Anna. His lips twisted in a smile, a knowing, mocking smile that Johann recognized all too well.

‚ÄúAh, Anna,‚Äù Drexler said casually. ‚ÄúThe Reich‚Äôs perfect soldier, isn‚Äôt she?‚Äù

Johann stiffened. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs her role here?‚Äù

Drexler leaned back in his chair, taking a slow sip of his coffee. ‚ÄúAnna Reinhardt is a special case, Oberst. A success of the ‚ÄòMerry Christmas‚Äô program. They‚Äôve been working on her for years.‚Äù

Johann‚Äôs brow furrowed. ‚ÄúA ‚Äòsuccess‚Äô?‚Äù

Drexler‚Äôs smile was tight. ‚ÄúThe program‚Äôs goal is simple‚Äîperfect soldiers, without the flaws of human weakness. Anna is our first success. She‚Äôs been made for this.‚Äù

Johann tried to mask his shock. He had suspected the project was some kind of twisted genetic or biological experiment, but hearing it confirmed hit him harder than expected. They had done this to her. They had made her, shaped her into something‚Ä¶ unnatural.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not human?‚Äù Johann asked, his voice low.

Drexler‚Äôs eyes gleamed with satisfaction. ‚ÄúOh, she‚Äôs human, alright. But she‚Äôs been conditioned to be something else. She does what‚Äôs necessary, without hesitation. And that‚Äôs why she‚Äôs so valuable. She‚Äôs one of a kind.‚Äù

The words sank into Johann like poison. Anna wasn‚Äôt just a soldier in the war. She was an experiment, a tool, a weapon. But something inside Johann refused to believe that‚Äôs all she was. He had seen her. He had heard her voice. He had felt the hesitation in her gaze the night before. She wasn‚Äôt just a machine.

But the thought lingered in his mind‚Äîhow much of her was truly human?

‚∏ª

Later that day, Johann found himself walking down the quiet hallways of the chateau, unable to shake the conversation with Drexler. The cold, sterile air of the chateau seemed to press against him as he passed rooms locked with heavy, rusted doors. He had seen the look in Drexler‚Äôs eyes when he spoke about Anna‚Äîa gleam of pride mixed with something darker, something almost possessive. Johann wondered if Drexler knew just how much of a lie the whole thing was. Could Drexler see that Anna was not a weapon to be wielded, but a person with her own mind, her own pain?

He didn‚Äôt have long to ponder these questions. As he turned a corner, he spotted her. Anna Reinhardt stood at the far end of the hall, her back straight, her eyes fixed ahead. She didn‚Äôt seem to notice him at first. Her expression was cold, calculating. But as Johann approached, her gaze flickered toward him, and she stopped.

‚ÄúI was wondering when you‚Äôd come looking for me,‚Äù Anna said softly, her voice as precise as ever.

Johann stood still for a moment, surprised by how direct she was. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a difficult person to find,‚Äù he replied, his voice betraying none of his internal confusion.

Anna gave a small, almost imperceptible nod. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not difficult to find. I‚Äôm just difficult to approach.‚Äù

Johann couldn‚Äôt help but chuckle at that. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt make it easy.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo one here does,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs how things work in places like this.‚Äù

Her eyes briefly flickered to the floor, and for the first time, Johann noticed a subtle shift in her demeanor. It was small, almost imperceptible, but it was there. Something vulnerable. Something real.

‚ÄúI heard what Drexler said about you,‚Äù Johann said, his voice low, careful.

Anna stiffened, her posture straightening once more. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure he told you exactly what he wanted you to hear.‚Äù

Johann took a step closer, his voice dropping even lower. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs all you are, Anna. Not just some project, some‚Ä¶ weapon.‚Äù

Her eyes flickered, and for a brief moment, Johann thought he saw something‚Äîsomething like guilt or uncertainty‚Äîflash in her expression.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre wrong,‚Äù she said, the coldness returning to her voice. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm exactly what they made me to be.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Johann replied, taking another step toward her. ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôve been something more all along. You‚Äôve just been hiding it.‚Äù

Anna didn‚Äôt reply immediately. Instead, she turned and began walking down the hallway, her boots clicking against the polished floor. Johann followed, reluctant but compelled.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre wrong about that too,‚Äù she said after a long silence. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been hiding nothing. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ the world doesn‚Äôt let people like me show what‚Äôs inside.‚Äù

Johann caught up with her, his heart pounding in his chest. There was something she wasn‚Äôt saying, something she had buried deep within her, but Johann wasn‚Äôt sure if he wanted to know the answer. He wasn‚Äôt sure if he could handle the truth.

As they reached the entrance to the underground facility, Anna stopped. She turned toward him, her eyes meeting his for a brief, tense moment.

‚ÄúDo you really think you can change all this, Johann?‚Äù she asked quietly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre here for a reason. But so am I. We‚Äôre both trapped in this.‚Äù

Her voice cracked just a little, and Johann finally saw it‚Äîthe smallest fracture in her armor. He didn‚Äôt know what to say, didn‚Äôt know how to answer.

But before he could speak, Anna stepped past him, her back straight once again.

‚ÄúGet used to the game,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all you‚Äôll ever have.‚Äù

End of Chapter 3

This chapter explores the growing tension and complexity of the relationship between Johann and Anna. Johann begins to see Anna not just as a product of the Reich, but as a person with her own fears and desires. The emotional depth of their connection becomes more evident, setting the stage for their eventual rebellion against the system. Would you like to move forward with more development of their relationship in the next chapter, or would you like to explore other elements of the story?

Certainly! Here‚Äôs Chapter 4, where Johann‚Äôs mission intensifies, and the cracks in the Reich‚Äôs plans begin to widen. He begins to grapple with his feelings for Anna, and the truth behind the ‚ÄúMerry Christmas‚Äù project begins to surface in more concrete terms.

‚∏ª

Chapter 4: Beneath the Surface

‚∏ª

The chateau seemed quieter the next morning, as if the walls themselves were holding their breath, waiting for something to happen. Johann moved through the halls with his usual calm, his boots muffled against the cold stone floors. The night‚Äôs conversation with Anna still hung in the back of his mind, gnawing at him. Her words echoed with a lingering weight. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre both trapped in this,‚Äù she had said.

His mind was still trying to piece together the enigma that was Anna Reinhardt‚Äîso perfectly poised, so coldly efficient, and yet, in her eyes, something stirred. It wasn‚Äôt just the machine inside her. It was the remnants of a person who had been buried beneath the layers of training, conditioning, and command. She wasn‚Äôt just a soldier. Johann could feel it. But he didn‚Äôt know what she was yet.

The mornings here were always the same‚Äîquiet, methodical. Officers gathered for breakfast, speaking in clipped tones, discussing tactics and plans as though the world outside was a chessboard, every move calculated and decisive. Johann wasn‚Äôt paying attention to the conversation. His mind was elsewhere, toying with a growing sense of urgency. The ‚ÄúMerry Christmas‚Äù project was becoming more than just whispers now. He needed more than just a vague name. He needed to see it, to understand what the Reich had built in secret, what they had done to Anna.

His task was clear‚Äîget inside the heart of the operation, sabotage it, and get out. But everything felt complicated now. The lines between right and wrong had become muddied with each passing day, each stolen moment with Anna, each crack in her icy exterior.

The others at the table barely noticed him, their voices fading into the background as he watched Anna from the corner of his eye. She wasn‚Äôt sitting with the officers today. Instead, she stood near the window, watching the distant hills with a look of detached curiosity. The sun was still low, casting long shadows across the valley, but something about the way she looked out at the landscape felt‚Ä¶ wrong. It was as if she was waiting for something to come‚Äîsomething inevitable.

Johann stood abruptly, excusing himself with a curt nod. He needed to act. He couldn‚Äôt wait any longer.

As he made his way through the chateau‚Äôs vast hallways, he passed the occasional officer, all wrapped up in their own concerns, their own ambitions. No one noticed him‚Äînot yet. Johann made his way toward the one place he had been meaning to visit: the underground facility where ‚ÄúMerry Christmas‚Äù was being hidden. The air felt different as he approached the stairwell leading down to the lower levels. It was thick, tense.

The door at the bottom of the stairs was guarded by two SS soldiers. They barely acknowledged his presence as he passed by, just the usual formal nods, as if they were used to seeing the high-ranking officers come and go. But the closer he got to the main control room, the heavier the air seemed to get.

He had seen files‚Äîredacted, incomplete, but enough to give him an idea of what he was dealing with. Biological experiments. Genetic manipulation. The creation of soldiers who never questioned orders, who never hesitated, who could be controlled. The word ‚Äúprototype‚Äù appeared frequently in the reports. But no one had said what that meant, not in plain words.

The steel door creaked open, and Johann stepped into the sterile, fluorescent-lit room. The smell of chemicals and antiseptic immediately hit him, thick and overpowering. But it wasn‚Äôt just the scent‚Äîit was the feeling. The feeling of something terrible being hidden here, something that should never have been allowed to breathe.

Inside, a group of technicians worked in quiet, focused silence, moving between various pieces of equipment, some of it unfamiliar to Johann. In the center of the room stood a large metal chamber, like a containment unit, complete with blinking lights and dials. Johann‚Äôs pulse quickened. He approached it slowly, trying not to seem too curious, though every instinct told him this was the heart of it all.

One of the technicians glanced up and nodded respectfully as Johann walked past, but didn‚Äôt say anything. Johann‚Äôs eyes fell on a clipboard resting on a nearby counter. He picked it up, scanning the notes quickly, his heart pounding in his chest.

‚ÄúEva-01‚Äîfirst successful prototype. Conditioning complete. Pending operational readiness.‚Äù

The words on the paper were a blow to his chest. Eva-01. Anna. She was part of this, created for this. But the word ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù made something inside Johann tighten. He understood now. She was more than just an officer. She had been made. Engineered.

His mind raced. This was the heart of the Reich‚Äôs most secret project. The one that would ensure they could fight a never-ending war‚Äîa machine that could print soldiers, soldiers who never questioned, who never hesitated. And Anna, for all her complexity, for all the cracks in her armor, was one of them. She had been made to serve, to kill.

The technician turned and caught Johann‚Äôs eye. ‚ÄúEverything is proceeding as planned, Oberst,‚Äù he said with an air of pride. ‚ÄúWe are only waiting for final authorization from Berlin before we begin the next stage.‚Äù

‚ÄúNext stage?‚Äù Johann asked, his voice carefully neutral.

The technician glanced at the chamber. ‚ÄúThe prototype will be deployed. Operational. Ready for war.‚Äù

Johann clenched his fists, a cold rage beginning to bubble in his chest. He wasn‚Äôt just going to dismantle a machine. He was going to free the people trapped inside it. Anna was a part of this machine, but she was also a victim. His mind flashed back to their conversation the night before, the brief moments when her guard had slipped. She didn‚Äôt belong here. None of them did.

Just as Johann turned to leave, a figure appeared in the doorway‚ÄîAnna. She was standing there, her eyes locked onto him, her posture perfect, but there was something different in her gaze. It wasn‚Äôt just the coldness anymore. There was an edge to it, something darker, more knowing.

‚ÄúEva-01?‚Äù Johann asked softly, his voice betraying none of the tumult inside him.

Anna‚Äôs eyes flickered, and for a moment, she almost seemed to soften. Almost. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been called worse things,‚Äù she replied, her voice a quiet echo in the sterile room. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs what they made me.‚Äù

Johann‚Äôs heart tightened in his chest, but he didn‚Äôt let it show. Instead, he walked toward her, the air between them thick with unspoken words.

‚ÄúNot everything about you was made,‚Äù Johann said softly, his voice low, as though sharing a secret no one else could hear. ‚ÄúAnd that is what makes you dangerous.‚Äù

Anna‚Äôs eyes narrowed, but there was no anger in her gaze. Only something else. Something far more dangerous. ‚ÄúDangerous?‚Äù she repeated, almost as though tasting the word on her tongue.

‚ÄúI mean to say,‚Äù Johann continued, stepping closer, his breath catching slightly, ‚Äúyou are still human.‚Äù

For a brief moment, a flicker of something passed across Anna‚Äôs face‚Äîsomething that looked like pain, but it was gone before Johann could read it.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what that means anymore,‚Äù she said, her voice a whisper. She turned and began to walk away, but before she reached the door, she paused. ‚ÄúRemember, Oberst. You‚Äôre in the belly of the beast now. You can‚Äôt escape it.‚Äù

End of Chapter 4

‚∏ª

In this chapter, the narrative takes a darker turn as Johann uncovers more about the ‚ÄúMerry Christmas‚Äù project and Anna‚Äôs integral role in it. The realization of her being a prototype haunts him, and their growing emotional connection becomes even more complicated. They are caught between duty and a deeper, more human bond‚Äîone that could either lead to salvation or destruction. Would you like to further explore their relationship in the next chapter, or shift the focus to the conflict building around them?

Certainly! Here is Chapter 5, where Johann grapples with the weight of what he has learned, and his relationship with Anna takes a more intense turn. As the walls close in around them, they are forced to confront not only the Reich‚Äôs horrors but their own fears and desires.

# The 24-Hour Challenge (That Became 48)

I challenged myself to build the MVP in 24 hours. Like many dev projects, that timeline was... optimistic. I ended up needing 48 hours to get it to a state I was happy with and got caught up with other stuff that I didn't even deploy that same day. The process was intense but incredibly rewarding - lots of coffee was consumed!

# I need your help:

The scoring system is particularly interesting - it analyzes user definitions against key concepts for each word. I'm constantly refining the prompt to improve scoring accuracy. it's more than just asking a model to assess the user's definition. I have a structured system in place to get results acceptable for a game.

This is my first first launch, and I would love:

1. For you to [play the game](http://www.playdefinely.com) ¬†and share your thoughts
2. Any ideas to improve the scoring approach (this is my biggest challenge)
3. Brutally honest feedback overall

Thanks for reading this far! I'm truly excited to be part of this community and to get your insights. I'll be actively responding to all comments.

For small introduction, I am 26 years old and moved to Trieste last year for my master degree. After completing my degree, I started to work here as an engineer. I really like Trieste and its calm environment. I have participated many exchange projects in the past, so I really like to be in International Friendships.

I am looking for new people to meet and exchange cultures. As an idea, I was thinking to create an international branch with 4-5 people -would be really nice-. Or if you have any ideas, I am open for a coffee.

I can understand little Italian for now, piano piano :) So I would prefer to talk in English. Everyone welcomed, no limits! You can dm me or make a comment here!

Context: Hi, I'm 20 (M) and GF is 20 (F). So after manalo ng GF ko sa pageant she had an ""after-pageant meeting"" and it all started there. Nung una akala ko ""meeting"" lang pero nag inom pala yung mga kasama nya, sya daw hindi. Umaga narin sya nakauwi and almost 0 updates and nag worry ako chinat ko pa parents nya and kakauwi nya lang daw ng 9am. I brushed it off kase baka nga minsan lang naman and celebration lang nila yon. I didn't want to ruin the after party/pageant vibes nya.

The thing is it happened again. Pag gising nya may variety show sila sa pageant after that  tumambay ulit sila. Nag inom ulit sila. Hindi nya sakin nasabi na mag iinom sila. Nalaman ko nalang nung nag chat sya ng 3am. Naiisip ko narin na baka mangyare ulit yung ""no update"" nya so I couldn't sleep at that time and I was right. I went for a walk at 4am. Tangina naiiyak pako non kase sunod sunod yung malas. Nahospital ako and nag ka hemorrhoids  and couldn't walk for almost 2 weeks. Dahil don ma t-terminate nako sa trabaho ko. Suicidal thoughts entered my mind as well while I was walking. Parang na feel ko kase na something's about to change. Siguro unconsciously nang naiisip ng utak ko na baka mag break kami and I was feeling so alone. I was at my lowest and I have no one. 

Sent her a long message at around 7:50am pagkauwi ko. (Summarized vers)

* ""I‚Äôm not mad. I‚Äôm just sad, and I want us to do better. I‚Äôm not stopping you from going out, drinking, overnights, or having fun‚ÄîI just want you to acknowledge my boundaries. OUR boundaries, and also know your limits. Because If this happens again, I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôll do next. ""
* You could‚Äôve sent a simple update so I wouldn't be left worrying.
* After thinking about it, I realized that what I‚Äôm feeling is valid. I didn‚Äôt like what happened. It feels like you‚Äôre acting single, and I want to set boundaries now so this doesn‚Äôt happen again.

She replied ""I read your messages, lemme just gather my thoughts""  and they went to a cafe again, and ayun di ulit kame nakapag usap. Pagkauwi nya nung gabi she prepped for work (nightshift) and di ulit kame makapag usap. And since I cant sleep kase parang bothered na nga talaga ako I waited mag break nya.  
  
Tas nung break nya I opened up na I've had these suicidal thoughts but it's not because of her. I just feel myself at my lowest. She replied ""Awww whyy u having suicidal thoughts?

Eto na talaga yung deal breaker for me. I was shocked and hurt na ganon lang yung ginawa nya. She didn't even bother to call me. Kase tangina kahit pag kaibigan mo narinig mo na ganyan mag w-worry ka agad or tatawagan mo or pupuntahan mo diba? I just replied. ""No particular reason, just randomly thought about it. I cant sleep will try again.""  Tas tangina after a few minutes dun na nag hit yung emotions na naramdaman kong wala na syang pake saken. Ako nalang yung nasa relationship namin.   


I reached out sa old friends ko to hangout at 3AM(same day). Sagot ko na lahat. Kase tangina I couldn't handle it. I needed someone to talk to kahit hindi tungkol sa relationship namin. And yun yung tropa ko na appreciate ko kase sinundo pako sa bahay ko ng 3:30AM. We ended up eating and just talking about school/work.

I messaged her ulit na I was feeling more alone and detached than yesterday, you have no time for me but you have time for ""coffee/latenights/inom"" knowing na alam mong hindi ako okay. Sabi ko din na mag w-walk and kain lang kame ng tropa ko susunduin nyako.

She replied "" Wait this is kinda overwhelming. I understand , let me gather mythoughts. coz later 7am m-makeupan ko pa yung pinsan ko for photoshoot or smthing"" I replied ""Okay you do you pauwi na kami"" I slept and pag gising ko we finally talked for a bit.

""Tbh im thinking about our whole relationship too‚Ä¶"" Unang chat nya then bang tangina luha bigla ako HAHAHA.  GF: ""Ever since i saw u na parang malamya nung pumunta kayo sa stage. Something hits me na hindi ko nagustuhan"" Little context : Malamya kase ako pag punta ng stage after pageant kase pagod nako  
(I was standing for 7 hours and cheering ng walang kain) and I was shy kase feel ko angpanget ko kase sobrang pawis ko and oily na. Nagselos or tampo din kase ako kase feeling ko ni l-lowkey or tinatago nyako sa speech nya. Yung ibang candidates kase they thanked their partners/lovers na nandon. I was expecting her to do the same. Pero hindi nya ginawa. She thanked her friends , family and bestfriend nya na galing bagio. I tried my best to not mind it pero ayun masyado palang obvious na malamya ako or nahihiya/op.  
  
She also mentioned our past arguments na on her big days daw or mga important shit  sa life nya lagi kaming di okay.(Last year bday nya/valentines) Ang naisip ko is I thought we resolved it already? She considers herself emotionally intelligent and she says what she feels agad pag di sya comfy or what but this time ang surprising , ang out of blue. Akala ko busy lang sya tas ganto pala. Naisip ko tuloy na parang gumagawa nalang sya ng rason para makaalis.

Tas ayon we continued to talk and akala ko yun na yung time namin mag usap kami ng maayos kase tapos na pageant nya di na sya busy eh kaso hindi sya nag reply bigla. I messaged ""hello?"" nag reply sya na "" Wait ah, Let me gather my thoughts"" ""Punta lang ako sa cafe. Kasama ko mga girls"". And I was DONE. when I saw that message. Sineen ko nalang sya. Let me gather my thoughts na naman eh hindi nya manlang nga na acknowledge yung mga long messages ko before.

I couldn't handle it anymore so I called my bestfriend. Matagal ko na din syang di nakausap pero tangina humagulgol ako habang nag kkwento sakanya and pati sya parang naiiyak nadin. I asked him to be ""neutral"" or kahit nga be biased sa gf ko kase baka OA lang ako. I told him feeling ko gusto ko na makipag break. Grabeng self disrespect na yung ginagawa ko sa sarili ko sa pag e-endure neto. He adviced me na maglibang nalang muna. Maging busy , mag hangout kame lagi, basically ignore her. 

I've decided na ganon na gagawin ko. I'm done trying alone. If she doesn't reach out then that's the only answer I need.  As much as possible I want to break up in person pero sabi ng tropa ko wag daw kase madadala lang ako ng emosyon ko. Alam ko naman sa sarili ko na kayang ayusin to lalo na pag nagusap in personal kaso worth it paba? Gusto kong ayusin o malaman kung anong nangyare ba't biglang ganto kaso naiisip ko din na hindi lahat ng gusto natin okay para satin. 

I supported her  the best I can sa pageant nya. In preparations I kept telling her she can do it and she can balance everything. Kept telling her to not compare herself sa ibang candidates kase kahit magaling sila /may experience sila , magaling kadin naman and mas maganda ka. I even supported her financially kahit im way past my saving budget and kahit nawalan ako ng trabaho. Nung talent day nya I really wanted to go and support her kaso pinagbawalan lang ako ng parents ko pumunta cause I was bedridden and sabi nya din na maiintindihan nya. Wag na daw nako pumunta. Tas ngayon sinumbatan nyako na ""They helped me when u were not there"" (some boy/s helped her nung talent day.) + Note : Yung ibang candidates na boys may gusto/nag h-hit up din sakanya pero she says no daw ;).

Kinda ironic how this will be the cause of our breakup.

okay, so today was super special because it was my designated eli day!! üíïüíç for those of you who don‚Äôt know, that‚Äôs the one scheduled day where i actually acknowledge the existence of my ‚Äúhusband‚Äù (not legally my husband‚Äîi proposed to him, and he refuses to wear the ring, but details, right? üòáüíñ) polyamory is all about balance, guys!! (even though i literally never have a designated day for my other partners, but whatever!! ü§™‚ú®)

so, the day started off absolutely perfectly. eli got up early (as always, because i‚Äôm not doing that), made himself breakfast, and got my daughter set up with video games and snacks üç™üéÆ because, obviously, she‚Äôs so independent and doesn‚Äôt need actual parenting! üíï‚ú® meanwhile, i stayed in bed until at least 10 or 11 a.m. ü•∞ but don‚Äôt worry‚Äîeli brought me coffee in bed ‚òïüíñ (with the biggest, most exhausted eye roll ever üôÑ) because he knows i can‚Äôt possibly function without someone else doing the bare minimum for me first thing in the morning!! üòç‚ú®

once i finally got up, i made a big deal about how today was our special day üíï (you know, so eli wouldn‚Äôt forget how lucky he is to be in this totally fulfilling relationship!! üòáüíñ) and then, in true day off fashion, i got dressed into‚Ä¶ another pair of pajamas. üõèÔ∏è‚ú® because let‚Äôs be real, i had zero intention of leaving the house today. (self-care, am i right?? üòç)

so, our super romantic designated eli day consisted of me scrolling on my phone, ignoring my kid, and occasionally looking in eli‚Äôs direction to remind him i‚Äôm here. üíñ‚ú® but don‚Äôt worry‚ÄîI made sure to gush about how amazing he is üíï because nothing says ‚Äúi love my ‚Äúhusband‚Äù‚Äù like making him sit next to me while i exist in my second set of pajamas for the day. üòçüíò

oh, and we double-teamed on chores today!! üòç‚ú® which, in reality, means eli did the chores while i sat there filming him and offering ‚Äúmoral support.‚Äù üíïüíñ like, what would he even do without me hyping him up while he scrubs the counters and takes out the trash?? ü§©üí´

we also decided to do a little bit of cleaning up today‚Äîin our separate bedrooms, of course. üè°‚ú® because why would we ever share a bed when we can just have our own spaces to exist as glorified roommates who sometimes hold hands? ü•∞ polyamory is all about freedom, and nothing says freedom like maintaining the bare minimum of a relationship dynamic! üòçüíñ

but then‚Ä¶ a little hiccup in the designated eli day. üòá‚ú® because who shows up unannounced?? that‚Äôs right‚Äîkaylee. üíïüí´ my sweet, wonderful girlfriend who definitely didn‚Äôt just crash our plans and turn my ‚Äúhusband‚Äôs‚Äù one-on-one time into yet another group hang. ü§™üíñ

and, of course, eli was totally fine with it!! üòä (not that he had a choice, because when do i ever consider what he actually wants? üòç) like, it‚Äôs so great that he‚Äôs so understanding about how i can‚Äôt go more than a few hours without one of my other partners showing up to steal my attention. ü•∞‚ú® true polyam goals!! üíñüíñ

by the end of the night, eli looked sooo exhausted ü•± (which is weird because he wasn‚Äôt the one who had to juggle multiple partners today!! üôÑ) but honestly, i think he had a really great time. üíï even if he didn‚Äôt say it. or show it. or look like it. üòçüíñ i can just tell, you know??

so yeah, amazing designated eli day!! ‚ú® can‚Äôt wait for the next one‚Ä¶ whenever i feel like scheduling it again!! üòáüíû

## Why the 24 oz Hydro Flask Remains a Strong Contender

But now with being unable to drink any of those drinks I mentioned without triggering symptoms dramatically I'm at a loss at what I can happily consume now.

Luckily coca cola and pepsi do caffeine free drinks which have helped it the main thing I'm still craving is coffee especially as most of my family are now primarily coffee drinkers (with me being a former barrista) I've never liked drinks like Tea. (which h is bad for being British!)

A coffee in the UK that I've heard I *might* be able to have is a decaff brand of Costa Coffee which supposedly is okay because they decaffeinate by using the 'Swiss water method' instead of using chemicals.

Hey r/SideProject community - long-time lurker, first-time poster. I've been reading your threads for months now, taking inspiration from all of your success stories. Last weekend, I finally took the plunge and built and deployed something for the first time. I'd love to share it with you all and get your feedback!

# What is Definely?

Definitely¬†is a daily word definition game where users are challenged to define a given word in their own words. The system then scores their definition based on how many key concepts they captured. Think of it as a Wordle-style game, but for vocabulary and language learning.

# The Origin Story

The idea came to me  randomly on Saturday. I started thinking of the solar system (the most random thing ever) and asked myself : how would I explain this with my own words?  
I was curious to see how close I would be, so I went to. ChatGPT and asked

I was intrigued. So I tried another word and I got some feedback.  
This sparked the thought: what if I gamified this process and made it fun for myself?   
I said to myself : I can build this in 24 hours and see what happens.

# The 24-Hour Challenge (That Became 48)

I challenged myself to build the MVP in 24 hours. Like many dev projects, that timeline was... optimistic. I ended up needing 48 hours to get it to a state I was happy with. The process was intense but incredibly rewarding - lots of coffee was consumed!

* **Structure**: Monorepo setup for efficient development

# My Building Approach

I approached this with a hybrid method:

1. I made all the architectural decisions and UX flows
2. Used AI (mainly Claude.ai) for code scaffolding to speed up development
3. Spent considerable time refining the AI prompt that's used to generate the framework for my custom scoring system (this was the most challenging part and is ongoing)

The scoring system is particularly interesting - it analyzes user definitions against key concepts for each word. I'm constantly refining the prompt to improve scoring accuracy. It's fascinating to see how much a prompt refinement can change the scoring behavior! But it's more than just asking a model to assess the user's definition. I have a structure system in place to get results acceptable for a game.

# Where Definely Stands Now

* The game is live and people are already playing daily
* Working on refining the scoring system
* Building a leaderboard for competitive play

# Next Steps

* **Premium Tier**: Planning a $1 subscription with features like:
   * Unlimited practice mode (vs. just the daily word)
   * more categories
   * Arcade mode (define as many words as possible in a limited amount of time)

# I Need Your Help!

This is my first first launch, and I would love:

1. For you to [play the game](http://www.playdefinely.com) ¬†and share your thoughts
2. Any ideas to improve the scoring approach (this is my biggest challenge)
3. Brutally honest feedback overall
4. Marketing suggestions to help it go viral (the Wordle approach)

Thanks for reading this far! I'm truly excited to be part of this community and to get your insights. I'll be actively responding to all comments.

- I make daily on average 3 dosages 13g of coffee.
- the espresso machine I use is 51mm basket (DeLonghi ECP 35.31)

Mostly I hear advice of spend more on grinder than espresso machine , is this valid in case of pressurised baskets ?

Single dose vs presetting for time/cup.

Many electric grinders have those two options but if I need 13g for dose what be best option ?
Does grinders with built in scale works to show settings in grams ?

With manual grinder is it match with quality of grind to electric or is this based on budget ?

Also some people complains about plastic containers on electronic grinder like Opus to have static ,it this something to be looking at as well ?

Many thanks  , I know lots of those questions was probably already answered, but please take in consideration I have this budget espresso machine and want to know for how much of difference it makes in this case .

1jev5w4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1jev5w4/did_i_do_the_right_thing_by_blocking_that_girl/,Did I do the right thing by blocking that girl because of my borderline friend?,"I am 20 years old, and a few months ago, I started seeing a woman who is 23 years old. I will call her J.

J and I had an immediate and intense connection, but things have been quite difficult between us.

From the very beginning, it was already challenging to go out with J (it took two or three attempts before we finally managed to meet), and even after we did, things did not become any easier.

J has borderline personality disorder, past trauma from her ex-boyfriends (especially the last one, who was the most toxic), and from the start, she made it clear that she did not want a relationship. She even encouraged me to see other people whenever someone seemed interested in me.

The problem is that, despite saying that, J also displayed behavior suggesting she wanted something serious. She was affectionate, gave me gifts (even for my family), wanted me to spend time with her and her family, and, surprisingly, showed jealousy. She denies feeling jealous, but she has seemed uncomfortable with a female friend of mine and, more notably, with a girl who flirted with me‚Äîeven though I never went out with that girl and explicitly rejected her.

Despite the good moments we shared, these months have been marked by ups and downs, with J wanting to distance herself during her emotional crises and me always being patient, trying to talk things through and make her feel better.

This continued until mid-November, when we finally broke up. She said we should just be friends and that we would not be together romantically anymore.

Around that time, I randomly met a girl on Instagram (I will call her N). N ended up helping me during this period, even giving me advice on the situation with J.

J and I had argued before, but I consider this our worst fight.

It was December, and I was on my way home from work when J messaged me saying she had woken up wanting to have sex and that she was going to do it because someone had invited her (she said it was a guy she had been with before dating her last ex). Later, she told me she had only said that to test me and that it was not true.

I tried to talk to her right away because I was upset, but instead of responding, she went to play League of Legends.

The next evening, after things had cooled down, I brought up the topic again. J told me she had not done anything, but she also did not admit that she had lied. She simply said she had lost interest.

At that point, I decided to tell her that N had invited me to go out (which was true). I explained that this girl did not seem romantically interested in me‚Äîit appeared to be just a friendly invitation. She had invited me twice for coffee and once to a book club she was organizing at her house with her friends.

I told J about it and asked if I could go. I even said that if she wanted, we could be in a relationship, and I would not go. That I was only considering it because she did not want to date me.

J said it was fine, but from her tone, I felt like it was not.

The next day, J made plans with her cousin and pretended to be on a date just to make me jealous. That was when she finally admitted she had said everything just to test me. She also compared me to her ex-boyfriends.

She then blocked me on the messaging app, and in desperation, I ran out of my house to go to hers, bringing a bouquet and some things she likes (an energy drink and chocolate) to try to fix the situation. I also messaged N, told her we could no longer talk, and blocked her.

In the end, J and I made up, but she insulted me repeatedly and even threatened to hit me for showing up at her house unannounced. She also kept telling me not to get my hopes up and that she did not want a relationship with me.

Nowadays, we are on good terms, living in a sort of friends with benefits situation, but I still wonder why J tested me, why she reacts this way every time she feels jealous, and why she never admits that she is jealous.

I also wonder if I was fair to N, considering that, even though she had only known me for a short time, she tried to help and advise me.

I am Shauna Mis, and I was at metrotown between 6-7pm last night because I was waiting for my uber app to give me some delivery trips to complete so I could make some money, and I though going there would be a good idea because it was more busy I would pick up something. How wrong I was. Not only did the shitty wifi there not help with the app at all (kept going offline) (also I have no internet data, as I am 18, and still am struggling to find a job despite being born in canada).

I am the righful owner of this Evercross EV10K Pro, and as the owner, I can confidently say that there are scratches on the top of the LED screen and on the brake handlebar. There's also some rust on it from going through water. I parked it on the lower entrance near the bus loops, where the bike lockers and a bike ramp is also located. Inside the mall entrance is BLENZ coffee straight ahead.

The photo is basically what the scooter looks like, but there's also a grey chain with a silver and pink code lock on it.

A couple of weeks ago I decided to try reaching out to her on another messaging platform and apologised for all the spamming I did. I was kinda expecting to get blocked again, until she actually replied to it. She said she was impressed with the admission and she went on about how our friendship in high school was something she was grateful that happened, she said she accepted my apology and asked how I was doing. 

I was surprised but happy since it seemed like she wanted to reconnect. I told her how I was doing, then asked what she'd been up to and whether she was still in the region where we live. No response for a long while, but she defo saw the message. A week went by, I decided to ask her hey hows your week been. Still no reply, even though it was clear she saw the message. Another week goes by, I think maybe I could try one more time, ask her whether she wants to catch up over some tea or coffee. Still no response, and once again, the read receipt showed she saw the message. 

Im not going to try messaging her again, but Im so bummed out and so confused about it. If she hadn't replied to the first message, I prolly would have left it at that. The thing that made me so bummed is not jsut the ghosting, its that instead of just blocking me again or telling me to bugger off, she instead replied to with me that message giving the impression that she was open to reconnecting and happy to hear from me. And then when I tried to reach out to her again, she deadass ghosted me. Im so confused and pretty sad about it and its left me wondering whether I'll ever be able to reconnect with her.

1jeuqim,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1jeuqim/should_i_feel_guilty/,Should I feel guilty?,"Hi everyone. I hope you can help me with this internal conflict I am experiencing shortly after ending a friendship. 

I met this person at my old job and we really hit it off. Like work-besties kind of a thing. When they quit and I got a new job we stayed in contact and I really enjoyed spending time with them. Never had a fight or negative experience with them. I only ever heard of their negative experiences and relationships they had with other people, and I never thought anything of it other than wow, they are really unlucky and they deserve so much better. 
Turned out to be very foreshadowing of how this all would end. 

A couple of weeks ago we decided to go on a short trip together. We both really needed a breather from different stressors in our lives and it seemed like such a great idea and we both really looked forward to it. 

I planned everything and ended up paying for their part as well because they were struggling financially and I could see that they needed this time off and it benefited me too, because it felt good to be able to do something for someone I cared about. 

I notice some tension on the first day and I cannot get one word in but I let it slide, because I know they are struggling and if they need to vent and me to just listen, I can definitely do that. They pointed out multiple times how they felt like they were the one doing all the talking and they hoped I didn‚Äôt feel like they didn‚Äôt want me to share, too. I said it was fine, and that I had also noticed they talked more than usual, but it didn‚Äôt matter because I am here to listen. 

During this trip the whole vibe changes and I feel like every time I try to add to the conversation I am cut off and they pull everything out of context and turn it around. I then feel like I have to kind of pick it back up and smooth it out but also kind of defend myself and my standpoint because they would not let me finish my sentences or explain what I was originally going to say. 

At one point, they just flipped and was raging about how awful this trip had been for them, and how uncomfortable they felt and that I was out of line. I was totally flabbergasted. I had no idea how we got here or what was happening. I had noticed the tension on the first day and every time they misunderstood or contorted what I was saying I tried to make sure that they understood so that the mood wouldn‚Äôt change. I felt like I had to walk on eggshells around them, but I accepted it because I really wanted to be there for them. 

It ended up with them packing up their stuff and leaving. They didn‚Äôt want to communicate or let me know what happened. I was left there totally confused and hurt. I have been in a relationship with a narcissist in the past and this all felt very familiar. I have learned a lot from that experience so I decided to not let this get to me. 

They texted me that same night telling me how disappointed they were and how I had not given them space and that I was unfair. That I didn‚Äôt care about their financial situation. A lot of texts basically gaslighting me into thinking I really was the problem. But since I know better, I ignored all the manipulation and turned it right around. When I voiced the fact that I thought they were ungrateful, disrespectful and lacked communication skills, and that I did not want to keep this conversation or relationship going, they all of sudden wanted to be able to talk it out and hear my side. I then proceeded to confront them with things they had said and them saying I never said that, I said this and that. Basically just rewriting the whole conversation and not at all listening or hearing my side. Then they went back to being nice and asking to me for coffee and hug it out. No thank you, I am done and I am not fighting for a relationship that I feel unsafe in. Then they switched right back to how awful and rude I am, and now we don‚Äôt have any contact. 

I have been very angry and actually didn‚Äôt care much about this ‚Äúloss‚Äù, because I knew that I had done the right thing and stood up for myself, but today I feel the guilt creeping in. I catch myself thinking did I overreact? I‚Äôm sure I don‚Äôt want that type of energy or dynamic in my life, so I feel like I did the only thing I could have done, but why do I feel guilty? 

I realize a lot of information is left out but I also don‚Äôt wish to throw out their personal information or struggles. I have tried to be as transparent as possible without hurting the other person, but I realize that without both sides it is hard to get the full picture. ",1,1742383549.0,FriendshipAdvice,2,1.0,False

Am I doomed?,"I need to get this off my chest. Too ashamed so I had to create a secondary account. This is going to be long but I need insight so I‚Äôm giving details.

Honestly, don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm looking for advices or solidarity, or both. I think what‚Äôs overwhelming so much about this issue is how fucking hard it is to grasp whatever is going on with you and realize how whatever mechanisms at play are not obvious and you don‚Äôt even know if you have specific issues with one of them, or all of them.

Male 22 here. At age 18, I had my dick sucked and blowed by a Tinder girl for the first time, I was standing. I have not a single memory of cumming too fast on that day. I do remember that I felt more sensitive when she would handjob me than when I was in her mouth. I ended up finishing after 10m voluntarily jerking off to her face. I didn‚Äôt ever think I had PE. It was the first time but I wasn‚Äôt thinking of finishing too fast because I never had this idea in mind.

However thinking back at it, before that, I would easily reach climax while masturbating, even though I don‚Äôt know specifically in how much time. This led me to edge often, but I never overthinked it before and thought it was normal.

I have a story of anxiety and depression, just like my brother.

On last January that‚Äôs when my mental torture begun. Since 18 I didn‚Äôt have any sexual contact at all. My girlfriend gave me a handjob for the first time while I was sitting in the car and I came in probably less than 30s. I was thinking I have to not finish too fast. I had a lot of pressure being the first time with my girlfriend that I love. For context it‚Äôs true that I would drink a lot of coffee at that time, sleep poorly and didn‚Äôt jerk off often. But I don‚Äôt think any normal person would cum so fast only from a handjob, whatever context, right?

After this event I‚Äôd start to lurk this sub with obsession and increased anxiety. I don‚Äôt know if I have longlife PE. It‚Äôs killing me. I have a soul level connection with my girlfriend who I‚Äôm very attached to and attracted to. We want to be together for life. She‚Äôs into submissive and I like that. But if I am doomed with this problem I would be forced to leave. I wouldn‚Äôt be able to bear the fact she‚Äôs unsatisfied with me and I think that I would make her a service not forcing her to settle down with me.

For my anxiety and PE I got on SSRI. It works. But everything is pleasureless. Not being able to cum or struggling to is great for your ego but that‚Äôs all it really helps for. And in reality I still live with this weight on my chest fearing that at some point the med will be tolerated with my body, as it happened for some.

Now I‚Äôm having suicidal thoughts again, because of that. If I lose the love of life to this I will simply collapse from despair. Is it possible it only occurred because I didn‚Äôt have any sexual encounter in a very long time? Because of my mind and anxiety? Because of something else? I‚Äôm so tired. Life does not seem worth living anymore. I never had any specific interest in sex. It‚Äôs the thought of having to let go of the purest relationship because of that making me want to end it all if my issue is definitive.

TLDR: don‚Äôt know if have longlife pe: have story of anxiety, first head and handjob at 18 standing without PE, first hanjdon in years at 22 sitting, came in 30s,",1,1742383320.0,PrematureEjaculation,0,1.0,False

I eat pretty healthy (black coffee, no sodas, no desserts- maybe one dessert every 2 weeks if even that). A lot of chicken and meat and veggies. Some carbs like gnocchi or rice, and occasionally bread. But I try to stick to protein and healthy carbs mostly. And I don‚Äôt smoke so it‚Äôs not an issue with lungs or anything like that.

I do drink, but it‚Äôs like 2 days a week max, and both of those two days might be just 1-2. Once a month or so I will go out for a night and have 4-5 but that‚Äôs pretty rare for me these days. So I am also not sure that is a contributing factor. 

I don‚Äôt really understand why I cannot increase my weight during lifts. For example, I did a set yesterday with 4 deadlifts at 85%, and I did 135 lbs and that is a number that I have maxed out on. I cannot do more. Or squats- I cannot squat more weight than 95-100 lbs. The minute I add more weight I either mess up my back or I fail to lift it. 

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs mental? Or physical? I guess I kind of experience this with running as well- cannot get a good running pace below 9:45. At times I ran more days per week (~4), I still couldn‚Äôt get the time down even with a training program. My fastest 5k was 30 minutes. And I felt like I was busting my ass! Even on a training program!

Does anyone have any advice on how to like break through the barriers? I feel like I‚Äôve honestly been at this plateau for a really long time. Multiple years, at least. I‚Äôm not always consistently tracking every single lift but there‚Äôs not a single time I can even remember putting more weight than the 25s on the bar for my squat, etc. Ugh!

Consider the universe: a vast expanse where stars flicker with ancient light and galaxies turn in slow, silent spirals. It‚Äôs an endless interplay of forces, and here we are‚Äîhumanity, a restless speck on Earth, forever peering beyond the horizon. For millennia, we‚Äôve been at it in our little corner‚Äîshaping tools from rock, conjuring myths to explain the shadows, brewing coffee to dodge the quiet ache of existence. But something‚Äôs stirring now. Through SpaceX and the fierce, untamed vision of Elon Musk, we‚Äôre stepping into a new act: colonizing Mars. This isn‚Äôt just a jaunt across space‚Äîit‚Äôs a bold reimagining of what we‚Äôre capable of, a leap into the unknown with our eyes wide open.

This isn‚Äôt about abandoning Earth. Earth‚Äôs no discardable relic‚Äîit‚Äôs the cradle, the soil where we took our first shaky steps and learned to ask ‚Äúwhy.‚Äù From the spark of life in some muddy pool to the equations scrawled across blackboards, it‚Äôs been a long, winding climb. Mars isn‚Äôt a replacement or a trophy‚Äîit‚Äôs a challenge, a red-dust riddle asking, ‚ÄúWhat else you got?‚Äù SpaceX isn‚Äôt here to pack our bags and flee; they‚Äôre here to stretch the map, to see how far ‚Äúhome‚Äù can reach. Those rockets piercing the atmosphere, those steel beasts aimed at the void‚Äîthey‚Äôre us, raw and determined, reaching because it‚Äôs in our nature to push past the edge.

Mars doesn‚Äôt roll out a welcome mat. It‚Äôs a harsh, unyielding place‚Äînights that freeze solid, air too thin to breathe, ground more grit than growth. It‚Äôs been sitting there, stark and patient, a blank slate with a mean streak. Yet that‚Äôs the draw: its indifference dares us to show up anyway. Not to dominate‚Äînature‚Äôs no lackey‚Äîbut to collaborate, to carve out a foothold. SpaceX links the dreamers to the doers, and in that bridge, something might take root‚Äîa dome, a garden, a mark in the dirt. It‚Äôs not about claiming; it‚Äôs about creating, turning a void into a verse.

Make no mistake: this is tough as nails. Space doesn‚Äôt coddle‚Äîno air, no shortcuts, no forgiveness if the math‚Äôs off. We‚Äôre soft, squishy things, built for meadows and streams, not radiation-soaked plains. But that‚Äôs the thrill of it‚Äîthe absurdity, the nerve to look at the abyss and say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll make it work.‚Äù SpaceX isn‚Äôt just banking on machines; they‚Äôre banking on that stubborn human streak, the one that turned mud huts into cities and oceans into roads. The universe doesn‚Äôt care either way‚Äîit‚Äôs just there, waiting to see if we‚Äôll rise to the occasion or blink.

Here‚Äôs the twist: Mars is more than a rock‚Äîit‚Äôs a reflection. Stare at it, and you‚Äôre staring at us, stripped bare. Without Earth‚Äôs comforts‚Äîthe breeze, the birds, the backup plan‚Äîwhat are we? Do we fold, or do we adapt? Mars could shake us loose from our petty squabbles, our lines in the sand, our ‚Äúus‚Äù versus ‚Äúthem.‚Äù It might whisper that home isn‚Äôt a patch of ground‚Äîit‚Äôs the ties we weave, the stars we chase, the whole tangled web of being. This isn‚Äôt just about settling a planet; it‚Äôs about unsettling ourselves, seeing what holds when the props are gone.

And the irony! The farther we go‚Äîpast the moon, through the dark, onto that crimson crust‚Äîthe nearer we come to what‚Äôs already here. Every liftoff, every landing, every gritty triumph loops back to the heart of us. We‚Äôre not apart from the cosmos; we‚Äôre the cosmos, waking up with a smirk and a wrench in hand. SpaceX, with its sweat and swagger, is just the latest thread in this old tapestry‚Äînot about grabbing the stars, but about realizing they‚Äôre already ours to dance with.

Time shifts out there, too. Earth‚Äôs all hustle‚Äîclocks, calendars, yesterday‚Äôs regrets piling up. Mars doesn‚Äôt play that game. Its days drag a little longer, its scars tell tales older than our oldest stories. Standing on it might jolt us out of our rush, remind us we‚Äôre not just racing through hours‚Äîwe‚Äôre woven into something vast and unhurried. SpaceX‚Äôs missions don‚Äôt just span distance; they puncture our bubble of ‚Äúnow,‚Äù letting the timeless seep in. What‚Äôs a lifetime of effort against a world that‚Äôs waited eons for us to knock?

So Mars isn‚Äôt the finish line‚Äîit‚Äôs the pivot. It‚Äôs where we swap ‚Äúget by here‚Äù for ‚Äúthrive anywhere.‚Äù We‚Äôre not adding square footage; we‚Äôre rewriting ‚Äúwe.‚Äù SpaceX lights the fuse‚Äîthe tech, the tenacity, the sheer chutzpah to try. It‚Äôs a call to quit being Earth‚Äôs guests and become the universe‚Äôs kin, to let the things that divide us fade like echoes. In its rugged plains, we might glimpse ourselves anew; in its quiet, hear a summons to what we could be. The universe isn‚Äôt elsewhere‚Äîit‚Äôs here, in the gamble, the grit, the choice to build where nothing was. That‚Äôs the spark, and SpaceX is just the flint striking it.

I told my new pastor that the reason I was going to go with the church plant over staying at the sending church was because at the sending church, the only available ways to serve were stuff like coffee or AV and greeter and I want to do more!

It all started with one simple word: REST. Yes, just REST, that tiny innocent word that somehow triggered a worldwide meltdown on Twitter.

You see, all I wanted to do was joke around, troll a little, and make fun of JoongDunk and WilliamEst. Nothing serious, just a little well-placed sarcasm to stir the pot. So I put ‚ÄúREST‚Äù
= ‚ÄúRaviporn Est‚Äù.

So, when all of this went down, I had simply suggested something very innocent: ‚ÄúWhat if REST actually meant Raviporn Est?‚Äù Nothing crazy, just a little theory.

But of course, they, in their endless imagination, decided that no, Joong put REST obviously meant that he was missing Dunk.
So, naturally, I just contradicted their nonsense. That‚Äôs it. Nothing dramatic. Just a little reality check.

BIG MISTAKE.

The fandom lost its mind. Complete chaos. They came at me like I had insulted their ancestors. Meanwhile, all I was trying to do was prove how they literally make things up. But‚Ä¶ what if I wasn‚Äôt even that wrong? Because let‚Äôs be honest, way too many Est fan accounts have ‚ÄúREST‚Äù written somewhere. Coincidence? I don‚Äôt think so.

Suddenly, everyone started analyzing this one word like it was some kind of sacred text. And I was just sitting there sipping my coffee like ‚ÄúWell, well, well, look at that.‚Äù

Even funnier:

And guess what? 
Joong himself proved me right.
Why? 

	‚Ä¢Just yesterday, Joong posted that he refused subtly to be associated with all the ‚Äúmissing Dunk‚Äù nonsense. 
Here, translation that what he said and I added the picture don‚Äôt worry: 

And every time he comes on Twitter to reply and joke with the fans, it starts like this:

‚ÄúJoong, are you lonely?‚Äù
‚ÄúJoong, are you free?‚Äù
‚ÄúJoong, you‚Äôre so lonely that you‚Äôre thinking about someone, right, babe?‚Äù

Jung: ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm not lonely. I‚Äôm working. I‚Äôm studying. I‚Äôm doing my homework. I‚Äôm playing games. I‚Äôm taking my family out to eat. I‚Äôm taking care of the dog at home. Everything‚Äôs fine, thank you.‚Äù

	‚Ä¢	He made it very clear‚Äîmultiple times‚Äîthat he‚Äôs not alone, that he‚Äôs living his best life, studying, playing games, and taking care of his family.
	‚Ä¢	And then, BAM! Today He posted a meme basically screaming that he‚Äôs not alone.

Conclusion?
If I exaggerated, then so did Joong. Because honestly, his level of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm saying nothing but actually saying everything‚Äù is pure art.
And my account was suspended.üòÇüò≠ü•≤üòÇ

So, dear Twitter haters, if you‚Äôre lurking here, just know that my Twitter bio is still REST. Joong too, And even here on Reddit, REST is still standing strong. Raviporn Est, REST, and if you don‚Äôt like it, just delete yourselves.

Is not really tiredness but it's a daze.  I find myself  in a state where I have these feelings I can't identify.  I have begun to realize that during this state i have things going on in the background, whether bad or just unfamiliar/requiring time. 

Often I feel unsatisfied about something, or I feel loaded and I'm not sure what to do. Often it's a form of excitement or anxiety. Something builds and the response is to just resort to ""I'm tired"" or ‚ÄúI'm too tired for this‚Äù. There's a good chance I actually slept well, and 9 times out of 10 laying down fixes nothing, coffee and water and food does nothing.

 I'm ""tired"" when I have feelings or issues I don't know how to fix running in the background. 

 I relate so hard when I take care of a child or see an older family member's child reach the breaking point. Sometimes it is just an attitude or exhaustion, but too often the child has valid reasons to be upset or is overloaded or has had issues building up all day and just doesn't know what to do. The parent will slap the sleep bandaid on, like ""oh yeah, you're tired"" ""he's super tired today"" ""oh yeah, it's your bedtime"" yet half or more of the time, the kid actually got decent sleep or had a good nap just a few hours ago, or it's still 2 or 3 hours until bedtime and the child has been having a bad day piling up with no support (even unintentionally from the parents). 

I feel like parents project extreme tiredness on a child constantly and it's a tool to avoid the big mess that is going on with the idea of ‚Äúget through the day‚Äù, or it's a thing to take advantage of to end the day early. I see relatives taking advantage of this almost every single day, and  putting an upset child in bed at a random hour or letting them cry until they're tired enough to sleep, so the parents can go drink or play a game. My parents did this to me often from day one especially 2 until I think 2nd grade. I remember even l as a teenager, when I got frustrated about something whether it was petty or serious, I was told ‚Äúyou need to go back to bed‚Äù even though I got over 8 hours the night before or this situation was before or just after dinner. I have siblings and cousins of different ages and this is how it was for everyone. In my whole family, the default for stress or any unease is to eat or rest, which isn't always an answer.

I think I, and many people, have been wired to be ""tired‚Äù. We're not 50 or 70, we're in our 20s and constantly tired!

I had major GI issues for years. Bedbound 4h a day, depressed, pains etc, if I didn't eat an ultra, ultra limited diet (hello salmon & white rice!)

Dysbiosis was the major culrprit. The Bergen FMT papers came out & I decided to research the heck outta FMTs. In the end I learned the best home protocol that I could & went for it. 

I am not a medical professional. I'm not *your* medical professional. This isn't medical advice.

Donor
Young family member. So many people overthink the donor & never do it. I controlled the variables & took a calculated risk.  

Key factors:
1) not too many antibiotic courses & none recently
2) no sexual activity
3) eating ""grown up"" food. 
4) requested wide variety of healthy food the week before.
5) no obvious issues with their biome
6) not someone who is obese - that can be transferred over

That's it.

Timeframes
As for timeframes, 1 small stool was turned into 5 rounds. 3 the first 10 days. 1 2 weeks later. Last a month after.  

Protocol
Key: minimise oxygen time. 
Into ziplocks immediately; all air out. Seconds count. Then (or later) into 5 snack sized ziplocks for distilled water in, hole in corner cut, through coffee filer into enema bottle & go. Enema first w water to clean out. 

Outcome
Took 2 weeks to notice changes & 3 months until fully done. I remain 100% dysbiosis free, tho I remain celiac.

That's it. Life-changing is an understatement. Not without risk.

Why Not Use a Doctor?
1) $10k in the countries that allow it. 2) Massive antibiotic regimes in advance, which I would not have handled. 
3) Their protocols seemed *worse*! Use of a blender to mush? No! That Exposes it to more air.

Jack lives in our hometown while I'm currently a few states away. It hasn't been easy but I feel like for the most part we made it work (honestly not my first long distance relationship). For awhile I've been working towards coming back home so I can be near him again. Before I left we were only dating for a month. Fortunately I found a new job opportunity in my hometown so I'm getting ready to leave and be closer to my boyfriend. Things were definitely looking up. Well until now... 

Earlier Jack and I were talking on the phone and I brought up being excited about coming back home. I told him I was especially looking forward into doing more normal relationship stuff with him like going on dates and just hanging out in general. He then goes to tell me that he really wants to make up for lost time and actually start having kids (he wants a lot of them apparently). To be fair, I've always known he wanted kids and I'm alright with that but I assume he meant in the future. And to be completely honest, I'm definitely not in the right place in life to have kids. I'd like to have my life in order before bring another life into this world. When I told him how I felt, he got angry with me and ended up arguing. I remember him telling me that he's too old to be going on coffee dates or whatever. He said some hurtful things and I eventually hung up. 

I dunno, I just feel very heartbroken. I wanted to reunite with him for so long but he just wants to cut to the chase and have kids. I don't even think he's in a good place to have kids either! 

Our relationship hasn't be perfect but I wanted to make things works cuz I love him so much. But now it just feels like the beginning of the end with both of us. 

If this end, I think I might just quit dating in general. I don't think I could deal with this again.

But why making US part of your suffering? Why letting us know about your clear deficency in following a story meant to be read by a *smart* fifteen years old?

Is not really tiredness but it's a daze.  I find myself  in a state where I have these feelings I can't identify.  I have begun to realize that during this state i have things going on in the background, whether bad or just unfamiliar/requiring time. 

Often I feel unsatisfied about something, or I feel loaded and I'm not sure what to do. Often it's a form of excitement or anxiety. Something builds and the response is to just resort to ""I'm tired"" or ‚ÄúI'm too tired for this‚Äù. There's a good chance I actually slept well, and 9 times out of 10 laying down fixes nothing, coffee and water and food does nothing.

 I'm ""tired"" when I have feelings or issues I don't know how to fix running in the background. 

 I relate so hard when I take care of a child or see an older family member's child reach the breaking point. Sometimes it is just an attitude or exhaustion, but too often the child has valid reasons to be upset or is overloaded or has had issues building up all day and just doesn't know what to do. The parent will slap the sleep bandaid on, like ""oh yeah, you're tired"" ""he's super tired today"" ""oh yeah, it's your bedtime"" yet half or more of the time, the kid actually got decent sleep or had a good nap just a few hours ago, or it's still 2 or 3 hours until bedtime and the child has been having a bad day piling up with no support (even unintentionally from the parents). 

I feel like parents project extreme tiredness on a child constantly and it's a tool to avoid the big mess that is going on with the idea of ‚Äúget through the day‚Äù, or it's a thing to take advantage of to end the day early. I see relatives taking advantage of this almost every single day, and  putting an upset child in bed at a random hour or letting them cry until they're tired enough to sleep, so the parents can go drink or play a game. My parents did this to me often from day one especially 2 until I think 2nd grade. I remember even l as a teenager, when I got frustrated about something whether it was petty or serious, I was told ‚Äúyou need to go back to bed‚Äù even though I got over 8 hours the night before or this situation was before or just after dinner. I have siblings and cousins of different ages and this is how it was for everyone. In my whole family, the default for stress or any unease is to eat or rest, which isn't always an answer.

I think I, and many people, have been wired to be ""tired‚Äù. We're not 50 or 70, we're in our 20s and constantly tired! I know factors play a role but I eat healthy, I don't have too much phone or screen time, I only have a few accounts and don't use them much, I have good habits, yet I'm so mentally drained and I know a lot of people randomly in my position.",4,1742381988.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

Good morning, traders! üåû Today is shaping up to be a high-volatility day with the FOMC meeting scheduled. Expect major liquidity sweeps and potential stop-hunts. If you‚Äôre trading, be cautious ‚Äì avoid unnecessary risks!

üîç Key Support & Resistance Levels (Order Book Analysis)

üîπ Support Levels (Buy Walls):

	‚Ä¢	$82,500 ‚Äì $82,000: Around 2,000 BTC in buy orders stacked here.

	‚Ä¢	$81,500: Possible deep liquidity sweep zone before any recovery.

üîπ Resistance Levels (Sell Walls):

	‚Ä¢	$83,500 ‚Äì $84,500: Roughly 2,000 BTC in sell orders. Strong resistance zone.

	‚Ä¢	$85,000: If broken, the market could quickly spike.

	‚Ä¢	üö® $89,000: A new major sell wall (~2,000 BTC) has appeared here, which was not previously present. This suggests that if BTC breaks $85,000, we could see a massive squeeze straight to $89K to clear these orders.

üî• What Does This Mean?
	‚Ä¢	Liquidity Grab Likely: Market makers might sweep liquidity from $80K and $89K before establishing direction.
	‚Ä¢	Limited Downside Support: There‚Äôs not much buy-side protection below $82K, meaning price could be more volatile on dips.

üéØ Trading Strategy for Today

	‚Ä¢	Best plays: Look for entries around $82,000‚Äì$81,500 and target $84,000‚Äì$85,000.

	‚Ä¢	Avoid FOMO trades: Whales and institutions are trapping price in a range and accumulating positions.

	‚Ä¢	Stay disciplined: Today is not the day for reckless risk-taking. Expect heavy wicks and stop-runs!

The SR800 sounds like an excellent starting roaster, but I know myself and my desire to really dive into the hobby, and if I feel limited in any way by the SR800, I know I‚Äôll keep thinking I should have just gotten a more advanced roaster right off the bat. 

My ‚ÄúNeeds‚Äù
- Less than 2000W
- Less than $2000
- Artisan capable. I love data and love the science behind it all. Precision is a virtue. 
- Enough control to be able to accurately and repeatedly profile a roast; randomness of outcome is a big no thank you. 
- Something that allows you to develop roasting technique and skills that are directly transferable to larger scale machines (end goal is to upgrade to small batch cottage operation at a local level) 
- Useable in an apartment with a vent hood or on balcony 

My Wants
- ~220g output for a half pound bag per roast
- Fast preheat (ie not 2hrs)
- Fairly esponsive to heat inputs 
- A roaster that resembles a larger commercial roaster in technique, output, and quality 
- Ability to do back to back roasts in a relatively short amount of time
- Something that I can use as a sample roaster to complement 
- Something fairly user serviceable. 
- User experience 

Based on these criteria, the SR800 meets all the needs. It‚Äôs also extremely accessible price wise. 

My biggest holdup is the fact that it‚Äôs fluid bed, and not a drum, and the technique and methodology of airflow and heat application seems very different from a drum roaster, which is likely what I‚Äôll scale up to later (unless I go the Valencia/Artisan 3-e route later on). I don‚Äôt want to develop negative transfer and basically have to relearn coffee roasting later. Also, it seems sort of janky modding it to work with Artisan‚Ä¶ How reliably accurate is the lid-probe setup for roast logging? 

The *ideal* roaster seems to be the Kaleido M2S with artisan, but it seems so pricey for a 320g range roaster. 

Other ideal options are the Quest M6, but it is also expensive, and it seems like it takes forever to heat up (I suppose similar to big commercial machines I guess)? It‚Äôs also kind of huge? 

I am stuck in analysis paralysis/ADHD hyperfixation executive dysfunction, and could use some of y‚Äôall experience and opinions/advice lol.

A merciless torrent of rain beats down on the sheet metal roof of a shack in an alien forest. The wooden frame creaks, struggling against the bitter winds that whistle through the barren frame ‚Äì not a plank to make up a wall, just four blue branches and a roof. Under this improvised hovel sits a man hunched over a small fire. A boiling pot accents the smell of rain with the sweet aroma of coffee. The man adjusts his poncho as he takes the pot by the handle with a gloved hand and pours its contents into a metal cup. He takes a moment to savor the smell before carefully bringing it to his lips and taking a sip.



Normally, at this time of day, this planet‚Äôs star, Pandora, would bathe this forest in vibrant blue light. The oxygen rich atmosphere would be teeming with birds and insects of a variety few planets, even Earth, could hope to match. Giant Bluewoods with their cyan leaves would open up their canopies toward Pandora like sunflowers on Earth. Normally at this time of year, the Meridagi mating season would begin. Thousands of giant, six-winged insects with mesmerizing patterns colored within their wings would paint this planet‚Äôs surface with a rainbow of color, refracted within their paper-thin wings as though they were stained glass. Normally, by now, the man would be wary of the Regoro ‚Äì evolutionary marvels that could vanish into the lush blue of the forest, hiding themselves better than any cloaking device ever could with nothing but the cells of their own wood-like skin. Normally, a planet like this would grab the imagination of even the most traveled of researchers and adventurers.¬†



The man savours the coffee, feeling the warmth of the liquid in his chest, and tasting the bittersweet tinge of herbs he‚Äôd gathered from this very forest. He closes his eyes for a long moment, listening to the almost deafening patter of rain against the roof of his shack. Thunder rumbles through the leaves that, even now, reach out to their life giver beyond the clouds. He breathes deeply before standing up and reaching out to a mandolin that rests against the makeshift frame of his shelter. A vine catches on one of the tuning pegs as he lifts it. Gently, almost compassionately, he lifts the vine from its snare and lets it return to dangling from the side of his shack. It seems to have detuned his instrument somewhat, but the man simply sits on a canvas stool just at the perimeter of the shelter.¬†



He listens to the rain for a moment before he begins to play. The bright sound of the instrument cuts through the storm as he arpeggiates his first chord. The harmonies spill out into the forest, replacing the usually noisy and chaotic chorus of the forest with lonely, somber music. The rain and trees swallow any reverb that may return to the man‚Äôs ears, claimed in the water and life surrounding him. The man never once opens his eyes as he plays, even as the wind gusts and drizzles him with rain, he simply continues to play. The harmonies progress and bend, rising and falling. The unease of a minor chord is alleviated with a transition into major. His fingers dance over the strings as he plucks out a melody between the chords, interrelated within the harmony so seamlessly that an untrained ear might think a pair was playing. The man thinks of the weeks he‚Äôs spent here, the life he has witnessed, and he treasures every memory as he plays out a tune as vibrant as Pandora, as beautiful as the Meridagi, and as subtle as the Regoro. He smiles as he strikes the final chord, which seems to ring out endlessly through the forest despite the rain.¬†



As he looks around, his eyes land on another pair of eyes, glowing a soft white from the side of a Bluewood tree. He stands slowly. Normally Regoro would not open their eyes close to prey, as their white sheen would give them away. He backs away slowly, mandolin by his side. When he sees that the creature doesn‚Äôt make any moves toward him, he nods toward it and smiles



In a brief arc of light, the man is teleported back aboard his ship, several lightyears away from his home of two weeks ‚Äì the blue glow of Pandora now only a speck of light against the void. So many life-harbouring systems like this one are discovered within a year that ones close to unstable stars like this one rarely get much attention.



‚ÄúMichael?‚Äù A female voice softly whispers from behind the man.



‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay.‚Äù Michael says.



‚ÄúYou almost stayed too long this time.‚Äù



‚ÄúI got a little carried away with the song on this one.‚Äù



‚ÄúIt was beautiful.‚Äù



‚ÄúIt was.‚Äù



Pandora suddenly lights up in a bright white flare that drowns out the light of nearby stars in an instant. When it dies down, a ghostly watercolor of bright gases stretches out into the void where Pandora once shone, painting the stars in a whirlpool of light and color. A tear streaks down Micheal‚Äôs face as he cradles his mandolin.

Level 131319 ‚Äì ""The Red Mirage""

Survival Difficulty: DeathZone ‚Äì Almost Unescapable Terrain, Persistent Entities, Psychological Hazard


---

Description

Level 131319, known as The Red Mirage, is an endless wasteland bathed in an unnatural crimson glow. A dense, swirling mist chokes the air, distorting both vision and perception. The cracked, barren ground stretches endlessly, devoid of life. Despite the suffocating atmosphere, no known toxins are present.

A single gothic mansion stands in the distance‚Äîisolated, looming, and the only structure in sight. It offers temporary refuge, yet true safety remains an illusion.


---

The Hunt

Those who enter The Red Mirage have mere moments before they are pursued. The shadows shift unnaturally as entities emerge from the darkness‚Äîsilent, relentless, and immune to reason. Wanderers who are caught do not die in the conventional sense. Instead, they vanish, only to awaken elsewhere: either in Level 0 or within deep, unstable layers of reality. Their memories of The Red Mirage remain fractured, leaving only lingering terror.

Reaching the mansion is not an escape. Within its walls reside three entities. Two are enigmatic, their intentions unclear. The third is something far worse.


---

Entities

1. Angeline ‚Äì ""The Kind One""

A tall, doll-like woman with unnaturally glassy, artificial-looking eyes.

Wears pristine Victorian dresses, always immaculate.

Sharp teeth and retractable claws remain hidden unless provoked.


Behavior:

Appears calm, almost gentle.

Claims to guide wanderers through the mansion, offering cryptic advice.

Insists that escape is possible, yet no proof supports this claim.


Speech Patterns:

Speaks in a soft, modern tone, fostering a false sense of security.


Role:

The only entity known to assist wanderers.

Avoids all discussion about The Ruler of the Mirage.



---

2. Desmira ‚Äì ""The Indifferent One""

A humanoid wolf with clawed hands and elongated fangs.

Dressed in dark, gothic attire.

Prefers to remain in the shadows, watching.


Behavior:

Detached, emotionless.

Does not attack unless directly commanded.

Acknowledges The Ruler of the Mirage without hesitation.


Speech Patterns:

Speaks in short, direct sentences.

Avoids unnecessary conversation.


Role:

Enforces the mansion‚Äôs unspoken rules.

Will attack only if instructed.



---

3. The Ruler of the Mirage ‚Äì ""The Third Entity""

Its true name is unknown, and speaking it is forbidden.

Described as both indescribably beautiful and profoundly unsettling.

Eye contact induces extreme psychological distress.

Shifts unpredictably between shadow and physical form.


Behavior:

Intelligent, sadistic, and cruel.

Delights in breaking wanderers‚Äîboth mentally and physically.

No recorded instance of mercy.


Speech Patterns:

Commands immediate fear and obedience.

Desmira refers to it as He, while Angeline calls it She. The entity responds to both.


Role:

The dominant force of The Red Mirage.

The only exit lies behind a locked door within its chamber.

The key is always in its possession.

No one has successfully escaped.



---

Psychological Effects

Before death, The Ruler of the Mirage inflicts hallucinations of unspeakable horror upon its victims. Some suffer heart failure or insanity before any physical harm occurs. Those who endure are subjected to prolonged torment, their resistance gradually eroded until they submit.


---

Entrances & Exits

Entrances:

A 30% chance of entering The Red Mirage by reaching the tallest building in Level 11.

Certain unstable pathways in deeper levels may occasionally lead here, though rare.


Exits:

The only known exit is behind a locked door in The Ruler of the Mirage‚Äôs chamber.

The key is always in its possession.

3% chance of escaping successfully.



---

Final Notes

The Red Mirage serves no purpose beyond suffering. It exists as a cruel illusion‚Äîa false hope that leads only to despair.

There is no recorded evidence of escape.






A story of the Level 131319


The individual found themselves in an unfamiliar location after previously walking through Level 11. The transition between levels was abrupt and unintentional. Upon arrival, they were immediately pursued by multiple hostile entities, including Howlers, Skinstealers, and Smilers. The entities displayed aggressive behavior, with audible screams and persistent pursuit.

A structure resembling a castle was visible in the distance, presumed to be Level 73, which is known as a safe zone. Reaching the castle became the primary objective. However, physical exhaustion became a significant obstacle, with the individual's muscles weakening and their breathing becoming labored. Despite this, they continued running.

Upon reaching the entrance, the individual collapsed inside, and the door shut behind them. Entities outside began to scratch and scream at the barrier, causing psychological distress. The fear of the door being breached led to a temporary state of immobility.

Shortly after, an unknown female figure appeared at the top of a staircase. She was dressed in Victorian-era clothing and exhibited a pale complexion, long brown hair, and a composed demeanor. 

The figure introduced herself as ""Angeline"" and identified as one of three entities living within the castle. Despite her calm and welcoming tone, physical observations revealed that her hands were not human, but rather sharp, black, claw-like appendages. Upon noticing the individual‚Äôs reaction, she quickly hid them within her sleeves.

Angeline assured the individual that she intended to assist them in escaping. Although skeptical, the individual saw no alternative. Angeline‚Äôs demeanor became more serious as she observed her surroundings, eventually suggesting that they relocate. When the individual indicated that they were unable to walk, Angeline lifted them without hesitation.

During walking, the individual experienced an increased sense of unease. Angeline‚Äôs tone and behavior suggested awareness of an unidentified presence within the castle. Given her statement that three entities resided in the structure, it remained unclear whether the other two were allies, threats, or something else entirely.

Angeline brought the individual into a large room that resembled a living area and seated them on a sofa. Despite the presence of lit candles, one half of the other sofa was shrouded in darkness. The individual sensed a presence in the darkened area.

Angeline placed a tray of food on the coffee table in front of the individual.
During the meal, individual noted the immediate dissolution of flavor upon contact with her tongue. Angeline sat at the same seat, decreasing proximity before asking about individual's identity. 

Individual answered that their name is Julie and she's 24 year old. 

Angeline acknowledged the response before proceeding with further questioning how long they been her. 

Individual informed her that they accidentally noclipped into Backrooms a month ago and they still couldn't find the exit in this period. 

Angeline asked if they encountered any other human. Individuals said that they haven't met anyone in this time. Than they stated that she was the only one who they talked, and it was nice to talk to her even though she was entity. 

Angeline displayed no adverse reaction to the classification and said it was nice to talk to her too. 

A sudden auditory disturbance emerged from an unlit section of the room. The voice, deeper in pitch and distinctly female, carried an irritated tone.

""Can you yap with her somewhere else?""

Angeline turned toward the origin of the voice, her facial expression remaining neutral. She asked not to be rude toward the guest. 

""Yeah‚Ä¶ guest,"" the voice responded, laced with sarcasm but devoid of amusement.

The obscured corner remained unlit until two glowing blue eyes became visible. Julia experienced a brief autonomic stress response, characterized by momentary breath restriction. The entity moved forward, emerging into the dim light.

The figure, identified as female, showing no interest towards the individual. Notable characteristics included black wolf ears and wolf legs. While humanoid in general form, the entity‚Äôs presence deviated from standard expectations. Additional observable details included gothic attire and the previously noted bioluminescent blue eyes.

The entity‚Äôs presence induced an ambient sense of unease. Despite internal discomfort, Julia maintained composure. The entity exited the room without further engagement.

Individual asked who she was.

Angeline responded with stating that she's her sister and she's not a threat to them as long as they don't cross her path. She looked like she wanted to say something else, but than she quietly continued the conversation. 

---

Nightfall arrived, and Angeline designated an unoccupied room on the upper floor for the individual. The room‚Äôs location was next to Angeline‚Äôs own. Initially, Angeline suggested that individual sleep's in the same room as her, citing unspecified reasoning. They declined, attributing the decision to personal discomfort rather than suspicion of malintent. Despite Angeline‚Äôs continued kindness, she remained an entity.

Lying in bed, individual found themselves unable to fall asleep state. An ongoing sensation of being watched persisted despite the room being completely lifeless except from theirs. 

Upon nearing sleeping, individual registered a tactile disturbance. A sharp, elongated object traced a slow path from her abdomen to her waist. Her eyes opened to meet a pair of red, luminescent irises staring directly at her. The entity's expression exhibited characteristics associated with predatory behavior, including a widened, unnatural grin.

A physiological panic response ensued, leading to an involuntary vocal outburst. They attempted to retreat, resulting in a fall from the bed.

Angeline entered within seconds, displaying signs of urgency. She immediately positioned herself next to them, initiating physical contact to provide reassurance. Individual exhibited signs of acute distress, including involuntary tears and difficulty forming coherent speech. Angeline maintained physical proximity, continuing verbal reassurances.

Upon regaining composure, individual attempted to articulate the event.

""I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ There was something here‚Äînext to my bed. I was so scared. I thought I was going to die.""

Angeline exhaled audibly before replying with she warned them to stay with her. 

""What was that?!""

Angeline told them that it doesn't matter and asked if they're not injured. 

""No. I‚Äôm fine.""

Angeline assisted Julia in standing. However, individual immediately buried their face in Angeline‚Äôs chest, avoiding visual contact with the section of the room where the entity had previously been located.

""Is it still there?"" individual‚Äôs voice remained unstable.

Angeline shifted her gaze toward the identified area, briefly hesitating before responding with 'she's gone' 

Despite the verbal assurance, Angeline‚Äôs continued starting on the spot suggested otherwise. Her  actions reinforced the implication, as she promptly led the individual out of the room, ensuring that her vision remained somewhere else. Upon reaching Angeline‚Äôs own quarters, she instructed the individual to lie down on her bed. Individual was frightened by what happened in the next door room, and their mind refused to rest. But soon enough exhaustion took over and their body drifted into unconsciousness. 

---

As consciousness gradually returned, the individual registered the sound of Angeline‚Äôs voice‚Äîlow, firm, and carrying an unfamiliar tension.

""Keep away from my room,"" she said. ""Respect my boundaries and my space. I won‚Äôt let you touch her while she‚Äôs here.""

There was no immediate response, only a silence that felt unnaturally weighted. Eyes remained shut, body still, faking sleep to avoid drawing attention.

Then, another voice emerged. Unlike Angeline‚Äôs, this one was calm, measured, yet tinged with amusement.

""You‚Äôre getting attached again, Angeline. That never ends well.""

The voice was distinctly feminine but carried an unnatural depth, sending a ripple of unease through the individual. Then everything went black again. 

---

By morning, the dining room was filled with an unspoken tension. Desmira‚Äôs presence was unmistakable, exerting a quiet yet oppressive weight over the space. The individual sat before a plate of untouched food, appetite absent, attention focused elsewhere.

Angeline, ever observant, took notice and asked what was wrong.

A hesitation. Then, individual responded with ""Not hungry.""

The answer did little to satisfy Angeline, but before she could push further, the individual spoke again, confronting her about last night. 

For a fleeting moment, Angeline‚Äôs posture changed‚Äîtension manifesting in the briefest of stiffness before she forced herself back into ease. A quiet laugh escaped her.

""You must have been dreaming,"" she said smoothly. ""You've been through a lot. Your mind is playing tricks on you.""

The response was too swift, too controlled, leaving lingering doubt.

Desmira, who had remained silent until now, finally spoke without looking up from her meal. ""Just tell her the truth."" 

Angeline‚Äôs facial expression shifted, becoming rigid as she directed a sharp, cautionary glance at Desmira. In contrast, Desmira displayed no signs of retreat, leaning back in her chair. Her glowing blue eyes gleamed with an unreadable intensity.

Individual, experiencing increased heart rate and evident distress, directed a question toward Angeline in a hushed tone, inquiring about Desmira‚Äôs implication. Angeline hesitated, her expression indicating internal conflict, debating whether to continue withholding information or disclose the truth.

Individual then verbalized a direct question that had preoccupied her thoughts:

‚Äú‚Ä¶Am I going to die?‚Äù

Angeline‚Äôs response was immediate; her smile dissipated, and she shifted her gaze down, avoiding eye contact. A monent of silence ensued, creating a tense atmosphere. Eventually, in a subdued and reluctant tone, she stated:

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you to die, Julia‚Ä¶ but I can‚Äôt keep you under my wings forever.‚Äù

Individual exhibited a physiological response consistent with distress‚Äîher hands trembled, and her fists clenched. She verbalized her conclusion: survival was only a temporary condition. Angeline did not refute this claim, and her silence was interpreted as confirmation.

Upon further pressing, Angeline admitted the extent of her capability: she could prolong individual‚Äôs life for a maximum seven days. Julia exhibited signs of acute stress, including difficulty breathing, rapid heartbeat, and a sensation of stomach distress.

Angeline expressed verbal regret, though they recognized that apologies would not ease their situation. 

The atmosphere in the room became increasingly oppressive, paralleling the sensation of fear experienced the previous night.

Suddenly, external auditory stimuli were detected‚Äîslow, deliberate footsteps reverberated through the castle, each impact intensifying Julia‚Äôs physiological distress. 

A figure positioned itself directly behind the individual, exuding an imposing and suffocating presence. The subject's estimated height was a little higer than 2.5 meters. Upon speaking, the figure‚Äôs vocal characteristics were analyzed as slow, deep, and exhibiting a tone indicative of predatory intent.

""Who do we have here?""

The subject‚Äôs proximity was further confirmed when exhalation was perceived near individual‚Äôs ear.

""A fresh prey for me to consume?""

Julia exhibited an involuntary response, characterized by full-body, indicative of an extreme fear reaction. Silent tears were observed, and her respiratory function became irregular as she attempted to suppress audible distress.

The figure proceeded forward, standing next to Desmira and revealing a weapon‚Äîa long, curved sword with a dark, jagged. The command issued was explicit:

""Kill her.""

Desmira accepted the weapon without 
hesitation, stepping onto the table in deadly position. The blade was raised, targeting the individual‚Äôs neck. Angeline, detecting the imminent threat, issued a desperate verbal command for Desmira to stop.

Individual's, experiencing psychological paralysis, covered her face with her hands, anticipating physical trauma. However, at the critical moment, an external voice interrupted the sequence of events. The voice was low, distorted, and authoritative:

""That‚Äôs enough.""

Desmira‚Äôs movement stopped instantly, the blade remaining still above individual‚Äôs throat. Angeline‚Äôs previous panic dissipated slightly. The intervening entity displayed a controlled demeanor, issuing further instructions:

""She‚Äôs not yours to kill yet, Desmira. Let‚Äôs not make things too quick. It‚Äôs always more fun when they think they have hope.""

Desmira complied, lowering her weapon individual‚Äôs throat, though her physiological stress markers remained elevated.

Observational analysis of the new entity revealed features inconsistent with human anatomy. Subject exhibited traits such as a long, curved horn emerging from the right frontal forehead, large  wings with black plumage, and a long tail resembling that of a bird of prey. Subject‚Äôs facial structure was perceived as unnaturally grateful, inducing a psychological response combining both attraction and fear.

Angeline engaged Desmira in a verbal exchange, expressing disapproval of her actions. Desmira remained indifferent, acknowledging her willingness to comply with the previous order. Tension persisted between them, but the altercation ceased when Desmira departed.

---

Later, Angeline made sure individual was safe by keeping her in her own room, a controlled space where no one could easily intrude. But they was afraid to sleep, still shaken by what had happened. Angeline reassured her, promising that no one would come for her here. To help ease her fear, she stayed by individual‚Äôs side.

Even with Angeline there, their sleep was restless, filled with uneasy dreams. Then, a sudden crash shattered the fragile peace. She barely had time to react before she heard Angeline‚Äôs panicked voice.

""Please, stop‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt do this!""

Individual's heart pounded as she caught the strained sound of Angeline gasping for breath, as if she were being choked. Through her ragged breaths, Angeline forced out a single word‚Äî ""Sister""‚Äî confirming that her attacker was family.

A cold, bitter voice responded with asking if it was what she wanted. Continuing with, does she want her to kill her over a wonderer Angeline met yesterday. 

Angeline didn‚Äôt hesitate saying, she'll protect the individual at all cost. 

The reply was immediate and chilling. ""Then I'll just go ahead and kill her.""

Footsteps‚Äîfast, heavy‚Äîrushed toward individual's door. Before she could move, the door was blasted open with a force that sent heat and smoke billowing into the room. The figure that stepped inside radiated fury.

Panic gripped individual's body, her heart hammering in her chest as she froze in place. The attacker grabbed her wrist with crushing strength and yanked her forward. She tried to resist, but the difference in strength made it useless. Dragged from the room, she barely managed to keep her footing.

By the time they reached the first floor, individual was flung toward the entrance with brutal force. She hit the door hard, pain exploding across her body as she struggled to breathe. Dazed, she barely had time to register what was happening before her attacker raised a clawed hand, ready to strike.

Just as the deadly blow was about to land, Angeline intervened. She grabbed the attacker‚Äôs arm, desperate to stop her. ""Please!"" she begged.

The attacker didn‚Äôt hesitate. She told her to let go and back off. When Angeline didn't complain, with a violent force she strike Angeline. She fell down, blood streaming down her forehead. 

For the first time, Desmira‚Äîwho had been watching‚Äîreacted. Her usual cold demeanor cracked as she rushed forward. Without hesitation, she transformed, her body shifting into a massive black wolf. She lunged at the attacker, but it was useless. With a single, effortless motion, she was sent flying back.

When Desmira quickly got into her legs, ready to attack again. Then the attacker changed. Her limbs morphed, stretching and reshaping into massive, talon-tipped wings. The air grew heavy, the atmosphere suffocating as a terrifying presence filled the room. Oxygen thinned, making it hard to breathe, and an unnatural pressure pressed down on them all as if they were seeing the Devil itself. Even Desmira, who had been so ready to fight, hesitated. 

Then, out of nowhere, a sharp, searing pain tore through individual's chest. Her body stiffened. And then‚Äînothing.

As Angeline's wounds healed, her vision cleared just in time to see individual. But something was wrong. They weren‚Äôt moving. They weren‚Äôt breathing.

^((sorry if this is already discussed, please link me to it, but I couldn't find it))

I'd consider myself lover of good coffee but still beginner at making them myself. I roughly understand the heat/grind size/time set up.

But recently, my coffees (Aeropress & French Press) have tasted musty(?) and not so much ""coffee"" taste. That's the best way I can describe them.

They are not old batches and I store them in a dry cupboard until use. I've had coffee from a few different roasters to check it wasn't just bad batches. As  I'm between homes, my setup has changed so my heat/grind size/time have been thrown off a bit, but I think(?) I'm roughly back. I've even had roasters grind it for my aeropress and also for a french press to see what I could fix... So I'm struggling to understand what I'm doing wrong.

So assume I'm a bit of an idiot on this one and just assume I don't know anything (I won't be offended, as long as you're ok with me telling you I've tried that)

We are looking for a coffee machine that works with whole beans. My wife prefers a good-looking machine.

Our first option was the Philips Baristina, but I found out it‚Äôs not that great. Next, we considered the SMEG BCC02 in taupe (found a deal for ‚Ç¨ 349 for this one, and we are really considering this), but I also read that SMEG machines aren‚Äôt the best. Caf√©‚Ñ¢ AFFETTO Automatic Espresso Machine also looks nice. But I do not know anything about that brand.

We don‚Äôt drink a lot of coffee (just one or two cups per day each) and don‚Äôt want a machine that requires a lot of cleaning. We mostly drink cappuccinos or black coffee.

Do you have any recommendations for a good machine that also looks stylish? A taupe-colored option would be a plus!

The size of your coffee table plays a critical role in creating the right look for your living room.

Most standard coffee tables measure between 36 to 48 inches in length and 16 to 18 inches in height, but selecting the right size depends on your room layout and furniture arrangement. A larger table works best in spacious rooms, while smaller tables fit well in more compact spaces.

It's with a very heavy heart to let you know that Haigen u/Haigen64/ has passed away due to health issues. Haigen was instrumental in shaping the Satisfactory community and was the person responsible for creating this subreddit.

Haigen has had a long history with Coffee Stain going back to the Sanctum days. He's always been there with us in this community, so it's very hard for me to believe that he's gone. My condolences go out to his near and dear.

1jetut1,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/1jetut1/south_park_really_nailed_it_when_they_said_that/,"South Park REALLY nailed it when they said that Christian songs are just love songs repackaged with ""Jesus"" in the lyrics.","I still do watch South Park and I think it's good, but I'm also of the opinion that the longstanding (pre-Trump era) take the show had of ""it doesn't matter who becomes president; nothing ever changes"" is the sort of cynicism that contributed towards Trump, MAGA, and the ideological nihilism we're seeing these days.  I really think the South Park dudes deserve more shit for that than they get.  Now, in absolute fairness, they have stopped having those takes in recent seasons.  But the damage is already done.  

However, one area in which they brought up a *majorly* solid point which remains salient to this day is in the episode where Cartman wants to start a Christian rock band to make money. Cartman talked about how easy the lyrics to Christian songs are to write: all you do is take a love song and replace the lyrics about a love interest with Jesus.  Which is spot-on!

Last night, I went to Michael's because I needed to get some decently priced home decor.  I've got actual furniture and some decorations, but I wanted to punch up my living room decor and give my cats more shit to knock onto the floor.  I don't want a ""dude apartment"" where the TV is on the floor, the coffee table is two slats of wood resting on cinder blocks and the living room furniture consists of two lawn chairs along the wall.  

I normally like going to Michael's because Hobby Lobby *suuuuuuuuuuuucks*!!  And their prices are better.  Plus, they don't engage in violation of international law by purchasing smuggled goods from the Middle East.  An absolute W for Michael's if I ever did see one.  I think there's a misconception from Northerners about how many Hobby Lobbys there are here in the South.  There's a lot, but they're mostly in the suburbs whereas I'm pretty firmly in the city, so I live closer to a Michael's.  Which has typically been a good thing.........until yesterday.  To my knowledge, Michael's is not one of the companies which publicly professed to rolling back DEI efforts the way Target has in order to comply with this odious administration.  Which is good, but what they seem to be doing, if the location I went to is a broader indication of where the store is leaning, is worse.  They're basically trying to have to have their cake and eat it too.  They're not, to my knowledge, rolling back their DEI efforts, but they are attempting to become Diet Hobby Lobby.  There was Christian music playing on the speakers last night.  *pukes*  They normally played a lot of 80's and 90's music, which was *great*!  Now they're playing Christian music.  I don't know why I recognized her but the singer over the speakers was Lauren Daigle and I was listening to the lyrics and it sounded like a breakup song.  If you saw Wicked, the song What Is This Feeling starts out as being coded as if the ""enemies to lovers"" trope is gonna start to play out, but it's about two women who end up loathing each other.  It was basically that kind of subversive framing, but lacking in lyrical talent or anything catchy that would make me want to listen to on repeat.  I fucking *love* that song!  I bring that up because hearing (and thinking about) Christian music makes my brain need to do a cleanse, so I need to heal by listening to and thinking about *good* music.  But I also bring it up because the song, on the surface, sounds like sort of song where a woman is an unfulfilling relationship, fucks with her self-esteem, the dude doesn't treat her right and she meets a dude who actually does value her and builds her self-esteem.  But the dude in this case was [checks notes] a zombie carpenter rabbi from Judea.  It-it's confusing as fuck framing if you're aware of the lyrical content but it is low-key insidious because if you're unaware, it *does* sound like a breakup song since I don't recall Jesus getting mentioned (at least directly) in the song.  Almost like she was embarrassed to be singing a Christian song?  Christian culture really is nothing more than just a fucking checklist, isn't it?  

Yeah, honestly, the South Park guys fucking *nailed it* in their analysis of Christian songs.  ""You're once, twice, three times my savior.""",37,1742380080.0,exchristian,7,0.97,False
1jetumo,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/1jetumo/sober_dating/,sober dating,"42M here, i stopped drinking 4 years ago. i did that because the body was sending warning signals and i was starting to feel addicted. im from belgium and my consumption was completely in the norm, but we have a culture of heavy drinking. 

im also a single father, separated for a bit more than 10 years. 

i realized the other day when mourning on my loneliness, that i actually had never got a successful date since i started dating without drinking. i mean, its never going wrong, but it feels like a casual hangout with someone u dont know, same as going for a coffee with a colleague. theres no ‚Äúmagic spark‚Äù how you would call it. 

i have gone through so many failed attempts that i simply deleted my dating profiles from the apps i was on.  however i was supposed to be happy because i was at least going on a date, according to redditors, i felt objectified , hurt in my self esteem, and spent so much time on it. i get that im probably not normal enough, its ok. 

i was explaining that to a friends wife (shes italian and they met on tinder), she was not surprised and told me that when they dated, they had to empty 3 bottles of wine before they finally made a move towards each other. 

i think we start with dating around the time we get drinking alcohol in teenage years. the brain is still forming, my theory is that is associates the two. 
its very hard to separate dating and drinking. for many people, me possibly included. what are your thoughts about this?
