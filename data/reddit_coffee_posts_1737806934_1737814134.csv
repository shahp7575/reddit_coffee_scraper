Otherwise, it would be a really, terrible writing. A poor way to keep the plot going. Irving is the cleverest character, but also the most humane!

Mark woke up in a ""party"" with a lot of people, some are relatives, maybe even friends. Adding the fact that Cobel was there, it's perfectly acceptable that he didn't leave a single note. Irving on the contrary was really smart to try to communicate with your inner. A technique used in lucid dreams is to try to remember any dream and take some notes. Eventually, some elements will start repeating in your notes. Then some night you will identify an element in a dream and remember that you were actually taking notes of these events and finally, boom: a conscious dream. Irving really did something similar repeating coffee (same coffee probably the brand used in Lumen), music (same style), painting (same image over and over again). It is also the most human/real character, once a guy that follows strictly any rule in the company but, after Burt everything changes and Burt was in the first place.

>!He probably left a note before leaving to find Burt. I'm not saying a note like ""M. has a card, we can enter again in the room, don't worry, hahaha"" but another kind of note that they are trying to communicate/investigate. This could be even simpler: it's not necessary to say to a bomb the moment to explode, just stop saying ""do not explode"" that is enough. Irving is smart enough for this. When Milkshake appeared at night, he said that it's all fine, there is an opera on TV. He even invited the vampire to enter, although it's frozen like hell outside (perhaps a cultural thing). But definitively he knew something had happened, and asked: ""Why don't you tell me what's going on, Mr. Milchick?""!<",1,1737814051.0,SeveranceAppleTVPlus,1,1.0,False

Hello, sorry if this post comes off as kinda cringe. I’m a young guy (24M) trying to navigate the world of dating. 

I’m currently at a university with lots of people. At this point in my life I have kinda exhausted all options when it comes to meeting women. I have joined lots of school clubs, but in these settings I have only really made friends with women, because they are in relationships. These clubs are athletic clubs which I generally have an interest in, so I’m also kinda locked in most of the time and just have conversations.

Dating apps have not been successful. I’ve done so much as paid for tinder, bumble, hinge revamped my profile entirely with the help of my friends, and paid for professional pics and getting pics with friends, and I still get zero likes or matches on any of the three platforms.

It is safe to say I have exhausted all the mainstream options of meeting women. I was having a conversation with one of my friends and she said that I should maybe try just approaching women during the day. 

I hang around a coffee shop doing work a lot of the time, and yes there are women there often. I go to the gym a lot and yes there are women there working out as well. However, I have never thought about approaching women to have a chat in either of these settings.

I have mainly approached girls in a bar or nightclub setting, but to be honest I feel like these environments aren’t the best. And also I’m really trying to train for a boxing match and I can’t be drinking these days.

So my question to you is, is what my friend saying a good thing to do? Should I approach a woman who is walking on campus in a respectful manner? She said that if I do it even while they are walking on campus, if I do it respectfully and read the room and back off if she isn’t feeling it, it’s totally fine to do it.

I don’t want to come off as the “campus pickup artist”, so I want to hear from you all about what you think about this.

1i9nmft,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1i9nmft/keeping_a_best_friendship_alive_after_confession/,Keeping a best friendship alive after confession,"Me (23M) and my best friend (24M) have known each other for a year now. We study at uni together. He's a very nice guy, smart and open-minded. I found myself helping him when he broke up with his ex at the beginning of last-year. We spent a lot of time talking and chatting. There was space both for light-hearted things and for serious matters. We shared two beautiful and funny travels. He's one of the most important people in my life.

At one point, in June/July, I realized I had feelings for him. I gave myself time to process this, with the help of my therapist too. In November I confessed to him. He took it well at first, and told me he couldn't match my feelings because he could never be in a romantic relationship with a man. Of course I respect that and I found our way of handling this very beautiful at the beginning: we were very comunicative about it, and in the following month we had the chance to talk about it again in a coffee shop. In that occasion I felt happy because he told me that he was scared to hurt my feelings by sending some memes or talking about his ex or whatever happens in his romantic life. I told him to not hold back, because it's up to me to tell him if he is hurting me. I really want to be by his side and help him when he is struggling with such matters. A few days later we had a hang out with his older sister (I met her that very day), and everything was calm and beautiful, we even made plans to spend some time together. Me and my best friend were both aligned on being sort of ""brothers"" and having a platonic relationship (he agreed on such things).

More than month passed, we haven't seen each other for three weeks because of Christmas holidays and we didn't chat as usual. I suddenly felt a wall building between us. And when we met again each other two weeks ago things didn't feel the same. And I don't know why. I felt heartbroken and yesterday I decided to talk to him calmly.

I asked him if he felt this distance too. He said that yes, he feels something has changed. I asked if there was something in my behavior that made him want to change the way we interact with each other. He told me that no, no nothing happened, it's just him ""self-sabotaging"" because he doesn't want to hurt me  nor delude me. I told him that since we spoke clearly I've never thought about us as a romantic couple anymore. I looked it from a best friendship pov and told him I wanted to be the two best friends we were before. I understand what he told me about ""not doing others what he would not want done to him"", but at the same time I expressed delicately that he should not assume things about how I am handling things internally. He told me ""it's not that easy"".

He told me that he trusts my words but at the same time he ""has no way to verify they are true"". That was a hard hit.

I suspect there is something related to his past that makes this self-sabotage side take over him. Maybe he fears being potentially hurt by this and he is keeping the friendship but distancing from me. I find it really absurd how just a month ago he wrote to me that he was ""happy that we we found a way to stay best friends and he hopes and trusts in me that I will be able to handle this"". He even had three days of self-sabotaging during which he wouldn't speak to me, then came back to normal admitting that ""he wasn't being his true self and felt bad for that"". *** And now, just a month later, he behaves like this without nothing being happened between us.

Towards the end of our talk I agreed that maybe we both need more more lightheartedness and don't talk of the ""heavy"" things between us. As of now I find myself very confused, I'd like to write to him about those messages he sent me back then (***) and tell him that I feel very bad for losing him as a best friend without knowing why. At the same time, I feel talking about it again would be against the ""being more lighthearted"" thing.

Do you think talking with his sister about this would be appropriate?

Lately I’ve been feeling really tired. Yesterday, my boyfriend told me we had scheduled dinner with his parents for today. I said I wasn’t really feeling up for it, but I’d go anyway. Then today, during lunch, he randomly decided that after we ate, he wanted to go for a walk and have coffee with his mom. I wasn’t feeling up to it and said I’d prefer to go home.  

He immediately started yelling, asking, “Why are you being a baby? It’s my mom.” He didn’t even give me time to explain before telling his mom we were leaving and that I wanted to go home. We got in the car, drove off, and now he’s mad at me.  

I haven’t been able to explain to him that I was worried about the window being open with the cat at home. On top of that, I’ve been exhausted, and today wasn’t the best day for me. If it weren’t for the cat situation, I would’ve pushed myself to go for coffee despite not feeling great.  

For context, we’ve been together for eight years. His parents live about 40 minutes away, and we have lunch with them every weekend we don’t have other plans. While his mom is sweet, I don’t feel connected to either of them, and his dad can be a bit rude. They usually talk about old times and things from their hometown, and I just don’t have much to add to those conversations.

I matched with a girl who was above average. After we talked for a long time she said she'd be willing to be fwb with me. I was very happy. This was my chance to lose my virginity and maybe have a normal sex life. I started exercising, changing my diet, I bought a gym membership, I even got testosterone boosters  because I wanted to become a bodybuilder. I didn't want to let anything go wrong. I wanted to have sex and I wanted to feel normal for once! I even stopped watching porn.

We were supposed to meet today and talk face to face at a coffee shop. She didn't show up. She didn't answer my messages or calls. Her profile was gone. Her phone number was unavailable. Then I realized I got scammed. And it's just baffling! I gave her no money or photos of me or any type of personal information that could be used to blackmail me. Why would someone do this? For what purpose? 

I drank my coffee, went on a long stroll and finally returned home. I'm feeling sick. I was the happiest I've ever been because I felt wanted by a woman.

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

Twenty minutes ago, all was good. I had stopped at an unmanned rest stop to stretch my legs, get some chips and coffee from the vending machine, go to the restroom. I had just tossed away the empty packet of vinegar-onion and gotten into my truck, deciding to adjust my mirror before the rest of the drive home. 

Just in time to see some…thing scuttling down the road. In a panic I’d floored it, but it’d caught up to my vehicle, torn away the heavy tarp above my truck bed, and slithered in. As soon as it did, it stuck its head up, and with a trembling ten fingered hand it jabbed its thumb to its right, seemingly ordering me out of the car. 

Like hell I was doing that, but other than that I had no idea what to do. My tire iron was back there with it, my gun was unloaded, and this was an abandoned road. I didn’t even dare to reach for my cellphone, I like an idiot had let it fall out of my pocket in my blind panic to drive, and I didn’t even dare glance back at my backseat to find it. 

Should I stop? No, my best bet was to get to a gas station and call for help. Surreptitiously I picked up speed, trying my best not to look into the rearview mirrors. Out the corner of my eye I can see a flash of its face in the mirror, its three inch wide eyes staring at me. 

The gas station.

My years of reckless driving as a youth served me well. I yanked my steering wheel hard, sending the car into a drift letting it stop just outside the station. I could hear grunts and something hitting the side of my truck. I hurled my door open, ready to leap out and make a run for it. 

Glass shattered and metal groaned. Instinct overrode common sense and I froze, spinning around. 

The monster, ten feet long at least, leaning past my shattered back glass. 

A man in my backseat.

Everything was uneventful. Then last week I started feeling teeny tiny little boops, they’d happen instantly and as before I even realized what I thought I felt, it would be done. Gas bubbles? I don’t *think* so? One day I felt a lot of little bubbles, then a few days of nothing. Then I’d feel one or two of the tiniest, faintest boops. Then nothing a few more days. 

Then today I felt a boop so I put my hand there and felt another in the same place (just from the inside). Awesome! Went back to work, minding my own business. 

THEN I felt a little boop just a bit above my belly button (higher than I expected!) so I started kindof pressing and I felt a firm spot like something was in there and soon as I pressed on it it shifted and it didn’t hurt but it made me gasp because it was a weird and unexpected feeling!!! Like my organs were trading places suddenly. It was brief, again stopping as soon as it started, but it was awesome and SO WEIRD!! Then I couldn’t feel the firm spot there any more (it DID move!) so I pressed around and felt another firm spot and pressed it and it moved again! Again, all from the inside. 

I found myself completely distracted from my work. Just kept pressing my belly to see if I could feel any more movement. You guys, it’s taking everything in me to not keep poking the baby 🤭  

So I decided to let the baby rest and forced myself to focus on work. Then, randomly, I felt pressure on one side of my stomach. So I placed my hand and gently pushed and I felt a kick FROM THE OUTSIDE!! 


 I don’t know what happened, why all of a sudden baby is REALLY MOVING today, but I am so THRILLED! I do think perhaps baby is cracked out on coffee because I had a cup yesterday evening and one this morning just before leaving for work, lol, so baby will crash and sleep for the rest of the day probably. But it is so good to finally have that reassurance.

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
- Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
- The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
- Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.\
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.\
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.\
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.\
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.\
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.\
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.\
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.\
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
- Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
- It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
- Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes \
- Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
- Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
- Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
- Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.\
- Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.\
Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.\
- Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.\
Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\

Starting and growing a business isn’t for the faint-hearted, but what if we could learn from the best? I’ve spent a lot of time diving into the stories of successful entrepreneurs, and their journeys are packed with lessons that can inspire and guide us.

Here are some key takeaways from the legends of the game—shared in a way that’s relatable for all of us hustling in the Indian startup ecosystem:

1. Start Small, Dream Big (Dhirubhai Ambani – Reliance)

Dhirubhai started with a single petrol pump and grew Reliance into one of India’s largest conglomerates. His secret? Think long-term and scale patiently.

💡 Lesson: Don’t worry if your startup seems small right now. Focus on creating a strong foundation, and the growth will follow.

2. Fail, Learn, Adapt (Elon Musk – Tesla/SpaceX)

Even the great Elon Musk faced failures—rockets exploding, car delays, and near bankruptcy. But his ability to adapt and learn quickly turned challenges into breakthroughs.

💡 Lesson: Failing isn’t the end; it’s feedback. Use every setback as an opportunity to pivot and improve.

3. Solve Real Problems (Ritesh Agarwal – OYO)

Ritesh spotted a gap in India’s budget accommodation market and created OYO. By understanding what travelers needed (clean, affordable stays), he built a solution that scaled globally.

💡 Lesson: The best startups solve real problems. Look around, find pain points, and tackle them head-on.

4. Build for the Customer (Jeff Bezos – Amazon)

Bezos famously said, “Obsess over customers, not competitors.” His relentless focus on customer satisfaction turned Amazon into an e-commerce giant.

💡 Lesson: Your customer is your ultimate guide. Listen to their needs, exceed their expectations, and they’ll stay loyal.

5. Keep Innovating (Narayana Murthy – Infosys)

Narayana Murthy didn’t just build Infosys; he redefined Indian IT by constantly innovating and empowering his team.

💡 Lesson: Innovation isn’t optional—it’s how you stay relevant in today’s fast-changing world.

6. Stay Resilient (Howard Schultz – Starbucks)

Schultz pitched Starbucks to over 200 investors before getting a yes. His resilience turned a single coffee shop into a global brand.

💡 Lesson: Rejections are part of the journey. Stay focused, keep pitching, and don’t give up too soon.

7. Think Beyond Profits (Ratan Tata – Tata Group)

Ratan Tata’s leadership goes beyond financial success. He’s known for making ethical, long-term decisions that benefit society as a whole.

💡 Lesson: Build a business that creates impact, not just revenue. A startup with purpose will always stand out.

Electric toothbrushes might just be the game-changer you’re missing. Let’s dive into how these devices can help with teeth whitening and why they’re becoming a staple for oral care enthusiasts everywhere.

# How Do Electric Toothbrushes Help With Teeth Whitening?

Electric toothbrushes aren’t just about convenience—they’re designed to provide a superior clean compared to manual brushing. Here’s how they make a difference:

* Advanced Cleaning Action: Most electric toothbrushes use oscillating, rotating, or sonic vibrations to break up and remove surface stains caused by coffee, tea, red wine, and other staining agents.
* Specialized Brush Heads: Many models come with whitening-specific brush heads that have polishing bristles or cups to target tough stains.
* Even Pressure: Built-in sensors ensure you’re not brushing too hard, which can wear down enamel and make teeth appear dull over time.
* Timed Brushing: Electric toothbrushes often include timers, ensuring you’re brushing for the dentist-recommended two minutes. Consistent brushing helps maintain a stain-free smile.

# Why Choose an Electric Toothbrush for a Brighter Smile?

Still debating whether to make the switch? Here’s why it’s worth it:

* Efficiency: Studies show that electric toothbrushes remove up to 21% more plaque than manual brushes, leading to healthier, whiter teeth.
* Gentle Yet Effective: They’re designed to protect enamel while effectively cleaning.
* Long-Term Investment: Paired with good oral hygiene practices, electric toothbrushes can prevent stains from setting in, saving you from costly whitening treatments.

# Pro Tips for Whitening With an Electric Toothbrush

To maximize whitening results, follow these tips:

* Use Whitening Toothpaste: Pair your electric toothbrush with a fluoride-based whitening toothpaste for optimal results.
* Replace Brush Heads Regularly: Swap out brush heads every three months to maintain effective cleaning.
* Brush After Staining Foods and Drinks: If you indulge in coffee, tea, or wine, brush soon after to prevent stains from setting.
* Consistency is Key: Stick to brushing twice a day for long-lasting results.

While electric toothbrushes can’t replace professional whitening treatments, they’re an excellent tool for maintaining a bright, healthy smile. Ready to level up your oral care game? Try one of the many whitening-focused electric toothbrushes available today and enjoy the confidence of a radiant smile.

1i9nb8m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Debugging_Adulthood/comments/1i9nb8m/how_habits_secretly_run_your_life_and_how_to_take/,How Habits Secretly Run Your Life (And How to Take Back Control),"Alright, let’s get real for a sec. 🧠 Ever found yourself mindlessly scrolling Instagram when you *swore* you’d go to bed early? Or maybe you’ve stress-eaten a family-sized bag of chips while muttering, “Why do I keep doing this?!”

Turns out, your brain’s basically a habit-making robot. Here’s the juicy stuff I learned from *The Power of Habit*:

**1. Your Brain Loves Shortcuts (Thanks, Evolution!)**  
Habits are just lazy-brain hacks. Think of them like a GPS for routine tasks:

* **Cue**: Your alarm rings (trigger).
* **Routine**: You zombie-walk to the coffee maker (action).
* **Reward**: Sweet, sweet caffeine bliss (brain high-five ☕). The kicker? Your brain *craves* the reward so badly, it autopilots the routine. No wonder we’re all out here accidentally binge-watching Netflix.

**2. Want to Change a Habit? Trick Your Brain.**  
Trying to quit late-night snacking? Don’t fight the cue (*hunger*) or the reward (*happy taste buds*). Just swap the routine.

* Instead of raiding the fridge, try sipping herbal tea or eating a handful of nuts.
* Your brain still gets its “reward,” but now you’re not inhaling cookies at midnight. Win-win.

**3. “Keystone Habits” Are Your Secret Weapon**  
Some habits are like dominoes. Nail one, and others fall into place.

* Example: Start exercising regularly → Suddenly you’re drinking more water, sleeping better, and *maybe* even flossing. Who *are* you?!
* Companies use this too. One CEO fixed *worker safety* habits, and profits skyrocketed. (Who knew not losing fingers was good for business?)

**4. Willpower is Overrated (Seriously)**  
Ever tried to resist dessert… until you didn’t? Willpower’s like a phone battery—it dies by afternoon. Stop relying on it!

* **Hack it**: Make good habits *easy* (pre-cut veggies in the fridge) and bad habits *annoying* (hide the PS5 controller).

**5. Bad Day? Perfect Time to Reinvent Yourself**  
Breakups, new jobs, or moving cities scramble your old routines. Use that chaos to build better habits.

* “New You” might still hate kale, but hey—small steps.

**6. Friends Make or Break Your Habits**  
Ever notice how running with a buddy keeps you accountable? Or how your coworker’s candy jar ruins your diet?

* Surround yourself with people who’ve got the habits you want. Peer pressure, but make it ✨productive✨.

**The Big Takeaway**: Habits aren’t life sentences. They’re just programs you can rewrite. Start small, hack the loop, and cut yourself some slack.

**Question for you**: What’s *one* tiny habit you could tweak this week? (Mine: Replacing “I’ll just check email” with “I’ll just stretch for 2 minutes.” We’ll see how that goes. 😅)",1,1737812970.0,Debugging_Adulthood,0,1.0,False

Let’s be real—entrepreneurship isn’t easy. It’s a rollercoaster of big wins, hard lessons, and sleepless nights. But one thing that’s helped me navigate this wild ride is learning from those who’ve already conquered the game.

I’ve dived deep into the stories of some of the most successful entrepreneurs, and I want to share a few lessons that might just change how you approach your startup journey.

Grab a coffee (or chai) and let’s jump in:

1. Think Big, Start Small (Jeff Bezos – Amazon)

When Bezos started Amazon in 1994, it was just an online bookstore. But his vision was to build the “everything store.” He started with one niche, mastered it, and then expanded.

💡 Lesson: Dream big, but focus on one thing at a time. Nail your niche before trying to conquer the world.

2. Fail Fast, Learn Faster (Elon Musk – Tesla/SpaceX)

Musk has had his fair share of failures—missed rocket launches, product delays, and even near bankruptcy. But every failure became a stepping stone for innovation.

Inside the private room at the hotel, beneath the glittering glow of a towering ten-tier champagne pyramid, Benson Gray stood with his newly hired assistant, Sophie Scott.   
  
The two of them were cutting a birthday cake together, their fingers interlocked.  
  
When Sierra Shaw entered the room, Benson didn't flinch or even look guilty. Instead, he spoke as casually as if they were discussing the weather.  
  
""Sophie has the same birthday as you. She's here all alone, far from home, with no friends. So, I decided to move your birthday party to hers for now. I'll make it up to you in a couple of days.""  
  
Sierra's smile faltered, freezing in place as her grip on her purse slowly tightened.   
  
Today was her 25th birthday. Benson had promised he would propose to her on this special day.  
  
She'd worn the elegant white dress he had gifted her, spent hours perfecting her hair and makeup, and arrived at the hotel excitedly.   
  
But the sight before her felt like a bucket of ice-cold water cascading over her head.  
  
The engagement ring she had dreamed of—the three-carat pink diamond she had spent years imagining on her finger—was now sparkling brightly on Sophie's hand as Benson held her hand.  
  
A sting of pain blurred her vision. Still, she forced her feet to move. Approaching Benson, she took a deep breath and pointed directly at Sophie's hand. ""What about that ring?""  
  
Benson shrugged with infuriating nonchalance. ""It all happened so suddenly, I didn't have time to prepare a gift. Sophie liked it, so I gave it to her.""  
  
But that was her ring, the one she had spent three years choosing meticulously, imagining every detail.  
  
She could almost hear the sound of her heart shattering. Her eyes reddened as her voice broke. ""And me, Benson? What about me? What do you take me for?""  
  
Benson clicked his tongue in annoyance. ""Why are you acting so childish? Haven't I celebrated enough of your birthdays over the years? Can't you let Sophie have this one for once?""  
  
Let it go? Why was it always her who had to back down? Benson had sabotaged the deal she was about to close to boost Sophie's standing in the company. He had stood idly by as Sophie spilled coffee on her, dismissing it as Sierra being overly dramatic.  
  
And every time Sophie made mistakes, it was Sierra Benson that was expected to clean up the mess, hiding behind the excuse of, ""those who are capable should do more"".  
  
All these years, what exactly had Benson taken her for? Did everyone else always matter more than she did?  
  
Tears blurred Sierra's vision. She clenched her fists, desperate to preserve the last shred of dignity she had left. Without another word, she turned and hurried toward the restroom.  
  
Behind her, a murmur of disapproval rippled through the small crowd of friends.  
  
""Benson, you've gone too far this time.""  
  
""You know how much Sierra cares about this proposal, but you brought Sophie here just to get under her skin?""  
  
Benson, utterly unbothered, continued slicing the cake. He placed one piece on a plate and handed it to Sophie.  
  
Sophie's eyes flickered with triumph, though she quickly masked it with a nervous, apologetic expression.   
  
""Mr. Gray, it's my fault. I shouldn't have come and upset Ms. Shaw. I'll apologize to her later, okay?""  
  
Benson gave Sophie's shoulder a reassuring pat, his voice calm and condescending. ""It's not your fault. She's just being overly sensitive. I've been meaning to break her of this habit of throwing tantrums for no reason.""  
  
""Benson, aren't you worried Sierra might get mad and refuse your proposal?""  
  
Benson exhaled a ring of smoke, a mocking laugh escaping his lips as though he'd just heard the most ridiculous joke in the world.  
  
""She's been dying to marry me since she was a kid, desperate to slap the name Mrs. Gray on herself. How could she possibly say no? If she wasn't obedient enough, she wouldn't even have the right to stay by my side.""  
  
The crowd around him erupted into cheers and laughter.  
  
""That's our Benson! Even the campus queen of Oceanea University couldn't resist his charm!""  
  
""Benson, teach us your ways when you've got time!""  
  
""Pfft! Step one, find yourself a woman who's head over heels for you!""  
  
Everyone in Vellmont City knew Sierra was practically Benson's shadow. The two of them were three years apart, childhood sweethearts. Sierra had followed Benson to Oceanea City for college, giving up her plans to stay by his side.  
  
To support him during the early days of his business, Sierra abandoned her dream of studying piano.   
  
She took on the role of his assistant, pulling all-nighters for a month straight just to help him close a single deal. She drank so much at business dinners that she developed stomach ulcers.  
  
Their mutual friends often said Sierra loved Benson so much that she'd lost herself completely.   
  
But Benson? He was so convinced Sierra would never leave him that he treated her cruelly without a second thought.  
  
In the restroom, Sierra stood frozen, her hands covering her ears. She stared at her reflection in the mirror—a woman with red-rimmed eyes and pale skin.   
  
Slowly, she forced her lips into a smile, one that looked more painful than tears.  
  
""Sierra, it's been ten years. Can you stop being so pathetic already?""

Twenty minutes ago, all was good. I had stopped at an unmanned rest stop to stretch my legs, get some chips and coffee from the vending machine, go to the restroom. I had just tossed away the empty packet of vinegar-onion and gotten into my truck, deciding to adjust my mirror before the rest of the drive home. 

Just in time to see some…thing scuttling down the road. In a panic I’d floored it, but it’d caught up to my vehicle, torn away the heavy tarp above my truck bed, and slithered in. As soon as it did, it stuck its head up, and with a trembling ten fingered hand it jabbed its thumb to its right, seemingly ordering me out of the car. 

Like hell I was doing that, but other than that I had no idea what to do. My tire iron was back there with it, my gun was unloaded, and this was an abandoned road. I didn’t even dare to reach for my cellphone, I like an idiot had let it fall out of my pocket in my blind panic to drive, and I didn’t even dare glance back at my backseat to find it. 

Should I stop? No, my best bet was to get to a gas station and call for help. Surreptitiously I picked up speed, trying my best not to look into the rearview mirrors. Out the corner of my eye I can see a flash of its face in the mirror, its three inch wide eyes staring at me. 

The gas station.

My years of reckless driving as a youth served me well. I yanked my steering wheel hard, sending the car into a drift letting it stop just outside the station. I could hear grunts and something hitting the side of my truck. I hurled my door open, ready to leap out and make a run for it. 

Glass shattered and metal groaned. Instinct overrode common sense and I froze, spinning around. 

The monster, ten feet long at least, leaning past my shattered back glass. 

A man in my backseat. 

A man in a hockey mask. 

And the knife he was holding, just inches from my head, stopped only by the ten fingered hand clenched around his wrist.

You agreed to meet a friend at a coffee shop, but by the time morning rolls around, you’d rather stay in bed and sleep in. Still, you get up and stay true to your commitments and head to the coffee shop where she is sitting outside at a table waiting for you. The street is bustling with early morning walkers and window shoppers. “How’s work?” Your friend asks as you order a coffee. 

“It’s good” you say shortly, knowing fully that your frustration with things at work is higher than ever. It’s been years since you first started your investigation into the crimes of Michelle Murray. She’s been wanted for two years, but always seems to evade your grasp just at the final moment. She’s suspected of operating a large money laundering scheme on behalf of a local crime ring, and you know that you have enough proof to convict her and send her to prison where she belongs. She’s just one step ahead of you at every turn. 

Your friend rambles about their day while you continue to run your brain through everything you’ve been investigating. As she finishes her story she looks up at you. “You okay?” she asks “you seem bothered lately.” You brush it off and tell her you’re fine, but that you just have a lot on your mind from work. 

As you finish your last sip of coffee, you spot a dark haired woman in a skirt and leather jacket across the street, sitting with a group of her friends at a table. “Could it be?” you think to yourself. 

You squint your eyes trying to get a better view and then it finally hits you - that’s Michelle Murray - 200 feet in front of you. “I uhh, I have to go” you explain to your friend as you put $20 on the table for the tip. 

You immediately rush to your feet, check your pocket for handcuffs, and walk across the street. As Michelle sees you walking towards her, she stands up from her friend group and walks out towards you.

1i9n205,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1i9n205/zero_calorie_drinks_are_a_great_tool_for_fasting/,Zero calorie drinks are a great tool for fasting especially beginners!,"
Hey fellow fasters!

I wanted to share some thoughts about low-calorie drinks during fasting, especially for beginners who might be struggling to stick to longer fasts. While a plain water fast is often touted as the “gold standard,” using low-calorie drinks like sparkling water, diet sodas, or coffee/tea with stevia can be an incredibly helpful tool for staying on track.

Let’s talk about the elephant in the room: “Do low-calorie sweeteners spike insulin?” The short answer? No, they don’t. Here are a couple of studies to back that up:
	1.	Artificial Sweeteners and Insulin: A 2010 study found that sweeteners like sucralose and stevia did not raise insulin levels in most people when consumed without other calories. (Source)
	2.	Sweet Taste Without Consequence: Another review from 2018 concluded that while artificial sweeteners might affect gut microbiota over time, there’s no solid evidence that they spike insulin when used sparingly. (Source)

So, yes, plain water is ideal for fasting purists, but low-calorie drinks aren’t the enemy. If having a Coke Zero or sparkling water with a splash of stevia helps you push through a tough fast, isn’t that better than breaking your fast completely?

Why Low-Calorie Drinks Work
	•	Suppress Appetite: The sweetness can help curb cravings, which is a lifesaver for beginners.
	•	Mental Boost: Having something flavorful during a fast makes it feel less restrictive and more sustainable.
	•	Hydration: Many low-calorie drinks (like sparkling water) keep you hydrated and can help prevent that dreaded fasting fatigue.

My Take

While there’s a lot of heat and gatekeeping in the fasting world, let’s be real: not everyone is doing a fast for autophagy or religious reasons. For many of us, fasting is about weight loss or mental clarity, and low-calorie drinks can fit into that. Sure, they’re not as “pure” as plain water fasting, but they’re a hell of a lot better than breaking your fast with a full meal because you couldn’t tough it out.

TLDR:

If low-calorie drinks help you stay consistent and make fasting sustainable, do it. Don’t let the purists scare you off or make you feel guilty. The journey is yours, and the tools you use to succeed are valid as long as they work for you.

Would love to hear what everyone else thinks about this. Have low-calorie drinks helped you? Or do you think they’re overhyped? ",6,1737812122.0,fasting,5,0.71,False

For context - I took my Seal Dynamic out today for a little drive. Adelaide to Kingston S.E. a distance of 293km. The initial plan was to stop at Meningie (146km from Adelaide) and then probably head home. The Meningie chargers weren't working so I went on to Kingston SE. Had about 12% charge in the battery when I pulled into the Kingston SE RAA charger.

Plugged in, went and grabbed some lunch and came back to the car, waited about 15mins for it to finish and the next time I parked when I went to grab a coffee for the trip back I saw the ""BMS in service"" alert when I turned the car off.

The range had also dropped by about 40-50km from the last time I did a full charge which was last week.

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated

------------------------------------------------------------

Gift cards are wonderful presents that give the recipient the freedom to choose what they want. However, sometimes it's hard to know what to get with gift cards. Thankfully, there are many creative ways to utilize them that can turn mere plastic cards into delightful experiences or treasured items.

### Explore Retail Options

When thinking about what to get with gift cards, consider stores where you can indulge in something special. Here are a few options:

- **Fashion and Accessories:** Use your gift card at clothing stores to treat yourself to a new outfit. Consider trendy accessories like purses, belts, or jewelry that you might normally skip.
- **Home Goods:** Invest in items that make your living space more enjoyable, such as decorative cushions, artwork, or kitchen gadgets.
- **Beauty Products:** Pamper yourself with cosmetics or skincare products. A gift card to a beauty store can help you discover new favorites.

### Gifting Experiences

Sometimes, the best gifts are experiences rather than physical items. If you have a gift card to a particular restaurant or entertainment venue, consider these options:

Check The Details Here: http://richdaddydating.com/AIfluencers-Premium  
  
- **Dining Out:** Treat yourself and a friend to dinner at a fancy restaurant you’ve always wanted to try. It can transform an ordinary evening into a memorable occasion.
- **Event Tickets:** Whether it's a concert, sporting event, or theater show, checking the listings can lead to a fun night out that you wouldn't have splurged on otherwise.
- **Classes and Workshops:** Look for gift cards that can be used for cooking classes, art workshops, or fitness sessions. These can be a fun way to learn something new.

### Going Digital

In today's digital age, gift cards can also unlock a world of online goodies. Here are several ideas for tech-savvy shoppers:

- **Streaming Services:** Use your gift card to pay for a subscription on platforms like Netflix or Spotify, giving you access to endless entertainment.
- **eBooks and Audiobooks:** If you love reading, consider using the card on platforms like Amazon or Audible. Dive into new books or listen to gripping stories on the go.
- **Gaming Platforms:** Gamers can treat themselves to new games, downloadable content, or in-game purchases from platforms like Steam or PlayStation Store.

### Charitable Giving

If you are undecided about what to get with gift cards or simply want to share your good fortune, consider donating the card to a worthy cause. Many charities accept gift cards, allowing you to make a difference. This way, you can help someone in need while feeling good about giving back.

Check The Details Here: http://richdaddydating.com/AIfluencers-Premium  
  
### Combining Gift Cards

Another creative idea is to combine multiple gift cards to make a larger purchase. For example, if you have a gift card for a particular store but need something more expensive, check if you can use several cards together. You can also ask friends or family if they have cards they wouldn't use, creating the perfect opportunity to get that special item.

### Customizing Gift Card Use

Think about personalizing your gift card experience. Many stores offer customization options such as:

- **Gift Wrapping:** Use your card for special gift wraps or handcrafted cards that make your gifts stand out.
- **Combo Deals:** Some stores allow you to use your card alongside discounts or combo deals. Always check if your card can be used for additional savings.

No matter how you choose to use your gift cards, remember that the most fulfilling option is one that aligns with your interests, needs, or desires. Right from shopping to experiences, the possibilities are endless. So much is out there just waiting for you! Let your gift cards lead you to something extraordinary.

The Benefits of Giving Gift Cards as Presents
---------------------------------------------

Gift cards have become a popular choice for many when it comes to selecting presents. They offer a perfect balance between convenience and thoughtfulness, making them suitable for various occasions. If you’re wondering why giving gift cards can be advantageous, read on to discover their many benefits.

### Flexibility in Choice

One of the most significant advantages of gift cards is the flexibility they provide. Recipients can choose exactly what they want or need. This is especially helpful when you’re unsure of someone’s preferences, tastes, or sizes. Instead of risking a wrong size in clothing or a color that doesn’t suit them, a gift card allows them to explore their options freely. Work within these ideas:

- Younger friends might prefer trendy clothes.
- Food lovers may enjoy dining out or specialty food items.
- Bookworms will appreciate a gift card to their favorite bookstore.
- Tech enthusiasts can select gadgets and accessories they truly want.

### Personal Touch

While gift cards may seem impersonal at first, they can be customized to add a personal touch. Many retailers offer options to send gift cards with personal messages, well-designed cards, or even specific themes. For example, a beautifully packaged gift card to a spa can be a thoughtful present for someone who needs pampering. Tailoring the choice to the recipient’s interests keeps the gift sincere. You might find that:

- Sending a coffee shop gift card for a friend who loves her morning brews is delightful.
- A streaming service card could be ideal for that movie buff in your family.

### Suitable for Anyone

Gift cards suit a wide range of individuals, making them a universal present. Whether you’re buying for a family member, friend, colleague, or even a new acquaintance, there’s a gift card for everyone. On occasions like weddings, graduations, or baby showers, gift cards stand out as practical choices that allow spouses or parents to select what they need to start their new journey.

### Avoiding Clutter

Giving physical gifts often leads to clutter, especially if they are items that the recipient may not use. Gift cards eliminate this problem because they don’t take up space. This is particularly important in a world where many people are embracing minimalism or downsizing their belongings. Instead of gifting another item that might gather dust, a gift card translates into an experience or an essential purchase.

### Easy to Purchase

If you're short on time or can’t attend an occasion in person, gift cards are incredibly convenient. Most stores offer digital gift cards, allowing you to purchase and send them instantly via email. This means you can still celebrate someone’s special day, even from afar. Many retailers also sell physical gift cards, and they are usually available at supermarkets, gas stations, and convenience stores, making them accessible at a moment's notice.

### Building Relationships

Gift cards can foster connections between giver and receiver. When you choose a gift card with a thoughtful consideration for the person’s interests, it reflects your understanding of them. This subtle yet meaningful engagement can strengthen relationships. Whether it's a simple coffee outing or a fun shopping day, gift cards create opportunities for shared experiences.

### Encouraging Local Businesses

Purchasing gift cards from local businesses supports the community. Instead of opting for big corporations, you have the option to choose a card from a local restaurant, boutique, or service provider. By doing this, you contribute to your community’s economy while also gifting someone an opportunity to explore local offerings. This not only presents your thoughtful nature but also encourages the recipient to discover new favorite spots.

Gift cards pack countless benefits that bring joy not just to the recipient but also to the giver. With their versatility, personal touches, and convenience, they stand tall against traditional gifts. Next time you wonder what to get as a present, consider the advantages of giving a gift card. They can delight anyone and are well-suited for various occasions.

### Conclusion

Gift cards offer vast opportunities for both the giver and the receiver. They are versatile gifts that cater to individual tastes and preferences, thus making them an ideal choice for any occasion. When thinking about what to get with gift cards, consider how they can be creatively used—not just for shopping, but for experiences like dining out, participating in local attractions, or pampering yourself at a spa.

By utilizing gift cards creatively, you can turn them into memorable experiences rather than just simple purchases. For instance, consider using a gift card to try a new restaurant or attend a unique workshop. This could lead to delightful adventures and unforgettable memories, providing more value than just items bought from stores.

Furthermore, giving gift cards as presents comes with its own set of advantages. They allow recipients the freedom to choose something they truly want or need, taking the guesswork out of gift-giving. This helps avoid those awkward moments when a gift doesn’t quite hit the mark. Plus, gift cards can be tailored to fit any budget and can even be paired with a heartfelt note or additional small gifts to add a personal touch.

Ultimately, when you explore what to get with gift cards, you’re tapping into a world of possibilities. Whether gifting or receiving, gift cards facilitate flexibility and creativity, ensuring that every occasion is met with joy and satisfaction. Remember, it’s not just about what you buy; it’s about creating experiences and celebrating moments that matter.

It only has one speed, no choice of grind. Recently, I pushed the button too long, grounds were too fine, and the coffee overflowed. Since then, my grounds have been to course. I could just keep trying and count the seconds I hold the button each time, but thought I’d ask you for recommendations. My other option is to just buy coffee that’s already ground.

But really I have a question.

I am 4 months pp, down to 5 ppd and producing 30-32 oz; I am a just enougher for my LO. 5 ppd is already a colossal quality of life improvement but I'm already looking forward to 4 ppd lol.

I know my supply will likely drop soon.. I'm back at work, sleep like garbage, high stress blah blah. So my question is - does anyone add a quick little hand pump in in addition to their ""formal"" pumps? 

I normally pump 5x20ish minutes with my Spectra, but I get a decent amt in 5 minutes with my hand pump. The hand pump also for whatever reason (probably not actually being hooked up, able to set it down quickly if baby needs something) is less of a barrier for me. So I'm contemplating dropping to 4 ppd but 1-2x/day taking 5 minutes to hand pump a boob or two and hope that keeps my supply up. 

Is this a thing? Do people do it? Milk is supply and demand at this point... So theoretically it should work, right? Do I need to totally empty or is grabbing 1.5-2 oz when I normally pump 2-3 with 20 min of Spectra an okay way to help keep supply up? Is this another post where no one knows and I just have to try it and see what happens? Probably, but I'm drinking my Saturday coffee waiting for babe to wake up for second breakfast and things are swirlin around my dome.

Thanks in advance for any thoughts. Hope pumping doesn't suck for you today and you get all the ounces you need.",1,1737811299.0,ExclusivelyPumping,3,1.0,False

Bonus brownie points for you, if you know where that's from!

To give you due warning, this advert is pretty long. I suggest getting a cup of tea and coffee, and to make yourself comfortable!

So, where to begin? Why don't I begin with some basic introductions! I am a 23 year old roleplayer hailing from the dark, mysterious lands, also known as Eastern Europe. To be more specific, I come from Poland, which at the moment situates me in the CET time zone. I have been doing this hobby for about half my life at this point, and while I have only made a switch to English a couple years back, I still consider myself decent! Other than writing, be it solo- or collaborative, I also love tea, j-RPGs, anime, fantasy novels, as well as anything that happens to be furry and walks on four legs!

A very important thing to know about me is that I love a good OOC connection, and on my end, it's pretty much requirement!

Yes, it does mean that I wish to, eventually, befriend my writing partners! It is not just that, though. The thing is that the whole OOC chatter around the story, the fan-girling, discussing the what-ifs, laughing about it, making memes, even mocking tense and sad story moments are what makes half of the fun of the hobby for me! If all of this sounds like grueling nonsense to you, I can say with certainty that the two of us will not work together very well. If what I've said however sounds amazing, then that's great, and we may be able to create some wonderful magic together!

So, that's it as far as introductions! Before I carry on further, I must get a few things out of the way, first!

1. Please be at least 20 years old of age, or older.
2. I require a reply rate of at least **once** per day, and the ability to regularly post more often is appreciated as well as preferred. Real life always comes first, but if you know that what I've just asked for is going to be a problem, then I am not the right writing partner for you.
3. I write exclusively on Discord. At the moment, I am not interested in trying alternative sites.
4. I refuse to use face claims of any kind. That said, reference images for objects, buildings, weapons and monsters are something I am much more agreeable to!
5. Explicit content, the way the term is typically understood, is unlikely. I much prefer fade-to-black. If you message me from a dedicated NFSW account, you will be rejected on the spot no matter what.

Okay, that would be all! Now, why don't I actually move to my preferences so far as the actual roleplay is concerned?

So, the most important thing about me about a roleplayer is that I always, in a manner of speaking, come empty-handed. Why? That's simple! I want to come up with everything within the story, be it the plot, the characters, the lore, the entire world they're in, and pretty much everything else **together** with my writing partner! The main exception to that rule are mainly monsters and some other fantastical creatures, that I may, or may not outright steal from mythology, video games, DnD or other sorts of fiction! This isn't a perfect approach, and definitely not an approach that would work for everyone. Still, I do not believe in perfect, and that is what works for me!

Which also means that, no, I will not be very interested if you already have an intricate plot or world of your own. If you do, I wish you the absolute best with it, but that's just not what I am looking for!

Now, I have mentioned that I want to write a story in an urban fantasy... but what *is* urban fantasy to me?

Simple! By that I mean a world, where the existence of magic, and any possible fantastical elements, is not something hidden from the 'muggles', where it isn't considered inherently separate from technology, and instead, for both to often be combined, as well as intertwined together! Pretty much, what I want could be summed up with this sentence: imagine your traditional medieval fantasy world, and then imagine it's gone through an industrial revolution. Now, *how* advanced our possible world is, that is very much up to discussion! As long as it's at least reached the steam engine, I am more than happy to brainstorm and discuss!

I should mention that at least at the moment, I *really* do not want to write a medieval fantasy. I've already got one, and I'm not really hungry for more!

That said, I still tend to utilize a great deal of storytelling tropes and plot devices you would see in a medieval fantasy story. I just often put a more modern spin on them! My ideal story would still feature a ragtag group of companions that travel together from to town, while braving through dungeons, undergoing quests, interacting with a whole ensemble cast, facing many dangerous antagonists, while a greater, terrifying threat looms from over the horizon! Just like in many medieval fantasy epics. The thing is, I just want all that to happen in a world that has working trains, electricity, cars, supermarkets, and quite possibly social media! The actual tone and dominant themes are something that I would like to discuss together, but over-all, I just love epic fantasy with major stakes!

(Though, at the moment, I will not consider military and/or police settings as the main backdrop for the story!)

A thing I may want devote yet another paragraph on is action. I absolutely love action, and it's pretty much a requirement that my writing partners feel the same! That said, my approach to it is neither realistic nor grounded. To put it like this... while most of my characters wouldn't be any more than just cannon fodder in the very overpowered universes (like the Invincible or Dragon Ball), they would still be considered OP by the standards of grounded, realistic settings. Things such as swordsmen cutting through modern armed soldiers by the dozens, dodging and parrying of actual bullets, and characters that fight on in spite of grievous injuries are all par of the course! So, before you consider reaching, make sure that what I've just said is up your alley!

Now, as for the characters! I have already mentioned my love for ensemble casts, and for this reason, the ability to create characters that differ by age\*, gender, romantic orientation, social background, moral alignment, and more, is absolutely essential! Is it a tall order? Perhaps, but I promise the same on my end! When it comes to my lead character in particular, we'll see. The only thing that's certain is that she'll be a woman. I also, generally speaking, prefer to write characters from their late 20s to their mid 30s. While playing young adults isn't necessarily off the table, I cannot promise I can be convinced to go down that road!

\*That said, most of the cast should be at least 21+ of age, if not 25+ outright.

As for romance, while I have a hard requirement for FxF for the main pairing, I still prefer writing partners willing and able to write all three basic gender combinations. By that I mean, obviously, FxM, MxM, and of course, FxF! Why? That's simple! I love variety, and I don't find it particularly realistic, nor immersive, when it's just a single kind of pairing over and over!

That said, while I do not outright require that our lead characters have to be romantically involved, I really am not the partner for you if you dislike writing romance in general.

I would also like to list some things that I do not want in my roleplays:

Fandoms, overt/excessive fluff/grimdark, sanitized/whitewashed depictions of groups widely known to be immoral/violent/corrupt, romanticized abuse, enemies-to-lovers (for the main pair), slice-of-life (as the main plot), werewolf and vampire plots, standard fantasy races, isekai, romance as the main plot, toxic masculine characters, comedy as the main genre, settings based off the real world (like in Marvel, HP or Percy Jackson), arranged marriage, school settings, protagonists of the evil moral alignment

Do not hesitate to ask, if you would like some elaboration on any one of these!

In truth, there's very, *very* few storytelling tropes and conventions that I refuse to make use of no matter what. Such as, I do not dislike either vampires, or were-creatures. I do, however, dislike settings where vampires and werewolves are the *only* fantastical elements, much less the only fantastical creatures, or if there's little of those besides them. Now that said, the ones listed above are what I *usually* dislike in fiction, and I figured the list may be useful to save at least some of you some time!

Now, while I **do not** write in fandoms anymore, there is a fair amount of fiction I tend to draw quite a lot of inspiration from! Examples would include:

Final Fantasy series (in particular VI, VII, X and XV), Fullmetal Alchemist (this is a big one!). Inuyasha, the Witcher series, Avatar: The Last Airbender (as well as Legend of Korra!), Vinland Saga, the Mistborn series, and Monster (the odd one out here!),

The list is in a *somewhat* descending order of importance. Of course, this isn't by any means the full extent of the fiction that I like! Absolutely not! I have, however, noticed that those are the pieces of fiction I am most likely to draw inspiration from, either on purpose, or subconsciously! If you like more than three positions on the list, then I feel there's good chance that we may vibe together quite well! However, I should say that while it is just my very limited personal experience, it's never worked out for me with anyone who was completely unfamiliar with any of the fandoms listed above. Especially when it comes to the first half of the list. So, if that's the case with you, approach at your own peril!

So! In regards to my storytelling preferences, I feel all that this should about suffice!

As for the *actual* writing, allow me to put it this way: I definitely like to have a decent amount of meat around the bone. Still, neither I do not believe in word quotas, nor do I believe in padding to fill said quotas. I don't really believe in labels all that much either, but if I must use one, then it'd be **advanced literate**. Typically, my replies tend to average between 400 and 800 words (don't ask me how much is it in paragraphs, I don't speak paragraph), but depending on the scene's need and scale, they can get longer. A lot longer. As for the more beautiful, flowery sort of language, I believe it is a lot like salt when used in cooking. Absolutely amazing in moderation, but not so much if you dump a whole kilogram into the pot! Oh, and I write exclusively in third person and past tense, and I expect the same of my partners, too.

I will happily provide a writing sample upon request in direct messages!

So, this should probably it!

This whole advert is a looot longer than it could have been, so kudos to you, if you've actually read the whole thing!

On the flip side, if you only skimmed through it, I recommend that you go back and read it in full anyway. This whole thing is long as #@%\^&!, but it is such for a reason, as a lot of the things I've talked about are potential deal-breakers and compatibility issues. At the end of the day, would you rather waste ten minutes of your time, or a whole week, if not more? Do take your pick!

Now, when you message me, please remember it is not a race! I typically tend to take my time rather than answer the very first person that messages me. What I do want to know is how I may call you, what is your age, your pronouns, your timezone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable sharing!), any potential story triggers (or just tropes you really, REALLY prefer to avoid!) and most importantly of all, a starting pitch for a story! This advert doesn't provide anything concrete, so don't worry, I am not asking for much! All I really want is a starting point for us to start plotting! You may as well tell me about a particular storytelling trope that you enjoy, or a character dynamic you've been wanting to explore for a while! I should also mention that while I will want to move to Discord eventually, I do typically prefer to stay here, before actually moving on. Oh, and it doesn't really matter whether you use Reddit Chat or Reddit PMs! Either channel works just as fine!

However, I should say that while it is just my very limited personal experience, it's never worked out for me with anyone who was completely unfamiliar with any of the fandoms listed above. Especially when it comes to the first half of the list. So, if that's the case with you, approach at your own peril!

So! In regards to my storytelling preferences, I feel all that this should about suffice!

As for the *actual* writing, allow me to put it this way: I definitely like to have a decent amount of meat around the bone. Still, neither I do not believe in word quotas, nor do I believe in padding to fill said quotas. I don't really believe in labels all that much either, but if I must use one, then it'd be **advanced literate**. Typically, my replies tend to average between 400 and 800 words (don't ask me how much is it in paragraphs, I don't speak paragraph), but depending on the scene's need and scale, they can get longer. A lot longer. As for the more beautiful, flowery sort of language, I believe it is a lot like salt when used in cooking. Absolutely amazing in moderation, but not so much if you dump a whole kilogram into the pot! Oh, and I write exclusively in third person and past tense, and I expect the same of my partners, too.

I will happily provide a writing sample upon request in direct messages!

So, this should probably it!

This whole advert is a looot longer than it could have been, so kudos to you, if you've actually read the whole thing!

On the flip side, if you only skimmed through it, I recommend that you go back and read it in full anyway. This whole thing is long as #@%\^&!, but it is such for a reason, as a lot of the things I've talked about are potential deal-breakers and compatibility issues. At the end of the day, would you rather waste ten minutes of your time, or a whole week, if not more? Do take your pick!

Now, when you message me, please remember it is not a race! I typically tend to take my time rather than answer the very first person that messages me. What I do want to know is how I may call you, what is your age, your pronouns, your timezone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable sharing!), any potential story triggers (or just tropes you really, REALLY prefer to avoid!) and most importantly of all, a starting pitch for a story! This advert doesn't provide anything concrete, so don't worry, I am not asking for much! All I really want is a starting point for us to start plotting! You may as well tell me about a particular storytelling trope that you enjoy, or a character dynamic you've been wanting to explore for a while! I should also mention that while I will want to move to Discord eventually, I do typically prefer to stay here, before actually moving on. Oh, and it doesn't really matter whether you use Reddit Chat or Reddit PMs! Either channel works just as fine!

Over I found it super helpful in identifying my patterns - I’m a big dawn phenomenon girl, my glucose responds very well to walking after meals, and it does NOT react well to the amount of caffeine in coffee. 

I was a 9.8 A1C when I was diagnosed mid-December and my projected A1C is 7.1! My next bloodwork appointment is March and I’m excited to see my numbers then. I’ve also been eating well (mainly whole foods, low carb, low added sugar) and working out regularly and I’m down 12 pounds. I’m only in 1000mg of metformin, so excited to see my numbers when I’m at a full dose.

Compared to finger pricks, the Stelo does read about 20-30 points higher. But the patterns are there and that’s what’s important to me.

1i9mnsq,https://www.reddit.com/r/roleplaying/comments/1i9mnsq/f4f_lets_create_an_urban_fantasy_epic/,[F4F] Let's create an urban fantasy epic!,"Hey-ho, hee-ho!

Bonus brownie points for you, if you know where that's from!

To give you due warning, this advert is pretty long. I suggest getting a cup of tea and coffee, and to make yourself comfortable!

So, where to begin? Why don't I begin with some basic introductions! I am a 23 year old roleplayer hailing from the dark, mysterious lands, also known as Eastern Europe. To be more specific, I come from Poland, which at the moment situates me in the CET time zone. I have been doing this hobby for about half my life at this point, and while I have only made a switch to English a couple years back, I still consider myself decent! Other than writing, be it solo- or collaborative, I also love tea, j-RPGs, anime, fantasy novels, as well as anything that happens to be furry and walks on four legs!

A very important thing to know about me is that I love a good OOC connection, and on my end, it's pretty much requirement!

Yes, it does mean that I wish to, eventually, befriend my writing partners! It is not just that, though. The thing is that the whole OOC chatter around the story, the fan-girling, discussing the what-ifs, laughing about it, making memes, even mocking tense and sad story moments are what makes half of the fun of the hobby for me! If all of this sounds like grueling nonsense to you, I can say with certainty that the two of us will not work together very well. If what I've said however sounds amazing, then that's great, and we may be able to create some wonderful magic together!

So, that's it as far as introductions! Before I carry on further, I must get a few things out of the way, first!

1. Please be at least 20 years old of age, or older.
2. I require a reply rate of at least **once** per day, and the ability to regularly post more often is appreciated as well as preferred. Real life always comes first, but if you know that what I've just asked for is going to be a problem, then I am not the right writing partner for you.
3. I write exclusively on Discord. At the moment, I am not interested in trying alternative sites.
4. I refuse to use face claims of any kind. That said, reference images for objects, buildings, weapons and monsters are something I am much more agreeable to!
5. Explicit content, the way the term is typically understood, is unlikely. I much prefer fade-to-black. If you message me from a dedicated NFSW account, you will be rejected on the spot no matter what.

Okay, that would be all! Now, why don't I actually move to my preferences so far as the actual roleplay is concerned?

So, the most important thing about me about a roleplayer is that I always, in a manner of speaking, come empty-handed. Why? That's simple! I want to come up with everything within the story, be it the plot, the characters, the lore, the entire world they're in, and pretty much everything else **together** with my writing partner! The main exception to that rule are mainly monsters and some other fantastical creatures, that I may, or may not outright steal from mythology, video games, DnD or other sorts of fiction! This isn't a perfect approach, and definitely not an approach that would work for everyone. Still, I do not believe in perfect, and that is what works for me!

Which also means that, no, I will not be very interested if you already have an intricate plot or world of your own. If you do, I wish you the absolute best with it, but that's just not what I am looking for!

Now, I have mentioned that I want to write a story in an urban fantasy... but what *is* urban fantasy to me?

Simple! By that I mean a world, where the existence of magic, and any possible fantastical elements, is not something hidden from the 'muggles', where it isn't considered inherently separate from technology, and instead, for both to often be combined, as well as intertwined together! Pretty much, what I want could be summed up with this sentence: imagine your traditional medieval fantasy world, and then imagine it's gone through an industrial revolution. Now, *how* advanced our possible world is, that is very much up to discussion! As long as it's at least reached the steam engine, I am more than happy to brainstorm and discuss!

I should mention that at least at the moment, I *really* do not want to write a medieval fantasy. I've already got one, and I'm not really hungry for more!

That said, I still tend to utilize a great deal of storytelling tropes and plot devices you would see in a medieval fantasy story. I just often put a more modern spin on them! My ideal story would still feature a ragtag group of companions that travel together from to town, while braving through dungeons, undergoing quests, interacting with a whole ensemble cast, facing many dangerous antagonists, while a greater, terrifying threat looms from over the horizon! Just like in many medieval fantasy epics. The thing is, I just want all that to happen in a world that has working trains, electricity, cars, supermarkets, and quite possibly social media! The actual tone and dominant themes are something that I would like to discuss together, but over-all, I just love epic fantasy with major stakes!

(Though, at the moment, I will not consider military and/or police settings as the main backdrop for the story!)

A thing I may want devote yet another paragraph on is action. I absolutely love action, and it's pretty much a requirement that my writing partners feel the same! That said, my approach to it is neither realistic nor grounded. To put it like this... while most of my characters wouldn't be any more than just cannon fodder in the very overpowered universes (like the Invincible or Dragon Ball), they would still be considered OP by the standards of grounded, realistic settings. Things such as swordsmen cutting through modern armed soldiers by the dozens, dodging and parrying of actual bullets, and characters that fight on in spite of grievous injuries are all par of the course! So, before you consider reaching, make sure that what I've just said is up your alley!

Now, as for the characters! I have already mentioned my love for ensemble casts, and for this reason, the ability to create characters that differ by age\*, gender, romantic orientation, social background, moral alignment, and more, is absolutely essential! Is it a tall order? Perhaps, but I promise the same on my end! When it comes to my lead character in particular, we'll see. The only thing that's certain is that she'll be a woman. I also, generally speaking, prefer to write characters from their late 20s to their mid 30s. While playing young adults isn't necessarily off the table, I cannot promise I can be convinced to go down that road!

\*That said, most of the cast should be at least 21+ of age, if not 25+ outright.

As for romance, while I have a hard requirement for FxF for the main pairing, I still prefer writing partners willing and able to write all three basic gender combinations. By that I mean, obviously, FxM, MxM, and of course, FxF! Why? That's simple! I love variety, and I don't find it particularly realistic, nor immersive, when it's just a single kind of pairing over and over!

That said, while I do not outright require that our lead characters have to be romantically involved, I really am not the partner for you if you dislike writing romance in general.

I would also like to list some things that I do not want in my roleplays:

Fandoms, overt/excessive fluff/grimdark, sanitized/whitewashed depictions of groups widely known to be immoral/violent/corrupt, romanticized abuse, enemies-to-lovers (for the main pair), slice-of-life (as the main plot), werewolf and vampire plots, standard fantasy races, isekai, romance as the main plot, toxic masculine characters, comedy as the main genre, settings based off the real world (like in Marvel, HP or Percy Jackson), arranged marriage, school settings, protagonists of the evil moral alignment

Do not hesitate to ask, if you would like some elaboration on any one of these!

In truth, there's very, *very* few storytelling tropes and conventions that I refuse to make use of no matter what. Such as, I do not dislike either vampires, or were-creatures. I do, however, dislike settings where vampires and werewolves are the *only* fantastical elements, much less the only fantastical creatures, or if there's little of those besides them. Now that said, the ones listed above are what I *usually* dislike in fiction, and I figured the list may be useful to save at least some of you some time!

Now, while I **do not** write in fandoms anymore, there is a fair amount of fiction I tend to draw quite a lot of inspiration from! Examples would include:

Final Fantasy series (in particular VI, VII, X and XV), Fullmetal Alchemist (this is a big one!). Inuyasha, the Witcher series, Avatar: The Last Airbender (as well as Legend of Korra!), Vinland Saga, the Mistborn series, and Monster (the odd one out here!),

The list is in a *somewhat* descending order of importance. Of course, this isn't by any means the full extent of the fiction that I like! Absolutely not! I have, however, noticed that those are the pieces of fiction I am most likely to draw inspiration from, either on purpose, or subconsciously! If you like more than three positions on the list, then I feel there's good chance that we may vibe together quite well! However, I should say that while it is just my very limited personal experience, it's never worked out for me with anyone who was completely unfamiliar with any of the fandoms listed above. Especially when it comes to the first half of the list. So, if that's the case with you, approach at your own peril!

I’m curious to hear what some of you are paying for property management and setup fees, as well as what’s included in the services. Specifically, I’d like to understand what others consider “full-service” since, in my opinion, a lot of companies use that term loosely.

Just to clarify upfront: **I’m not advertising, and I’m not asking for people to message me.** I’m also not sharing where we operate because this is purely informational for me to see if our pricing aligns with what hosts would find reasonable. That’s why I’m asking here in the host community instead of a property management group.

# What Our Company Includes

We offer what we consider truly full-service management. Here’s a breakdown of what we provide:

* **Setup**: Everything except furniture and decor.
   * We supply all the sheets, linens, pillows, towels, washcloths, pots, pans, dishes, silverware, etc.
   * We also provide items like the toaster, Keurig, door lock, and an outdoor security camera.
* **Turnover Process**: Comprehensive and off-site.
   * We manage all turnover items, meaning the owner never has to worry about deductions for damaged linens or plates.
   * The only items owners are responsible for are permanent fixtures (e.g., locks, cameras, coffee maker, toaster). For damages, we handle communication with guests to seek reimbursement before any deductions are made.
   * During turnovers, **every single item is removed and replaced**—no second-guessing cleanliness. This includes all dishes, silverware, cookware, linens, etc.
   * All dirty items are cleaned and sanitized off-site at our facility, which is equipped with industrial washers, dryers, dishwashers, and storage space.
* **Guest Experience**: We don’t ask guests to do any chores (e.g., stripping beds or running the dishwasher). Our goal is consistency and perfect sanitization for every turnover.

# Why I’m Asking

Our setup fee is reasonable, and we charge a set percentage monthly with no additional costs. We believe this provides owners the best chance for success while ensuring an excellent guest experience.

I’d love to hear about your experience with property management companies:

1. **What do you pay for property management and setup?**
2. **What’s included in your service?**
3. **What percentage would you consider fair for a service like ours?**

Please keep things general—no naming companies, and again, this isn’t an ad or a client outreach post. I’m genuinely trying to gauge where we stand in the market.

I asked if he could handle it since he was already standing in front of the fridge, but he insisted I “help.” Frustrated, I stopped what I was doing, dried my hands, and started listing the items. Sensing my frustration, he called me out, and I explained I had hoped he could manage it this time because I was in the middle of something. He cut me off, saying I hadn’t communicated properly.

I’m in my early 50s. I’m on week 3 of cutting my caffeine intake in half, only 1 or 2 small cups of coffee in the early morning. Previously I drank it all day into the night. I stopped to finally get some unbroken sleep and because I got tired of constantly paying Starbucks, McDonald’s, Panera, Dunkin’, Whomever, for me to keep my habit going. 

My observations so far: the headaches are horrific in the first week. I had to miss work one day. After about 8 or 9 days it’s like my system bottomed out with a terrible migraine, but then I woke up the next morning and it was all over. I felt calm and clarity, and from then on every day has been easier. You couldn’t pay me to buy coffee at Starbucks now. I make my own each morning and drink on ride to work and that’s it. Water the rest of the day. 

I will say that cutting back caffeine dramatically messes with your stomach. It isn’t as easy to go to the bathroom but your body adjusts. And as others have said in this community there are things you can eat to move that along. I think working out also helps kick the body into gear in terms of bathroom activity. 

The main thing I wanted to say, to anyone trying to get through this: just reduce caffeine and stop taking it in after 12pm. Then you’ll be in a good position to quit it completely, which will be my last step. Coffee intake has been really normalized in our world - we forget that IT CONTAINS A DRUG. And that drug is hard to quit. My last worst night of withdrawals included hand tremors and nausea with the migraine. Your body will function better without it over the long haul. And the calm and clarity you’ll feel as you get further away from it will really surprise you. I’m writing this in the hope it’ll help someone else. Thank you

I wound up in a well-paid office job and was losing my mind, feeling wildly out of place with my co-workers and like a fraud every time I went in. It got to the point that I was crying hysterically in my car every day before I went into the building. 
While I’m grateful for the life and privileges those jobs set me up with, it wasn’t sustainable for my sanity and I left. 
After spending the last 7 months aimless and under-employed, doing other odd jobs that made me kinda angry and miserable, I started working in a little local coffee shop this week. And I love it. The shop is cute, my co-workers are so kind, and I feel content at the end of the day. It doesn’t pay a ton, but I feel like I can grow here and take on more responsibilities and learn be a help to my co-workers and my boss. 
  I’m a little nervous at the idea that I might have found a job where I want to stay. But I’m so excited to get good at it.

Being vulnerable carries an inherent risk but with right person makes it all worth it

I think most of us are afraid in some sense to love and to be completely vulnerable yet despite the risk we long for it.

At my core, I'm a person of love, of care, of deep unyielding affection for those I hold dear.

Through the journey of healing and self-discovery, I've realized that I have much love to share. Love that is not bitter, but kind; not resentful, but forgiving; not closed, but open and willing to grow alongside someone special.

I’m interested in building a genuine connection and hope you feel the same. I’d like to share more about myself so you can get a clearer sense of who I am.

**Essence of Me:**

I am a mix of old-school romance and modern sensibility, holding onto the ideals of loyalty and sincerity. I think handwritten notes, surprise dates, and the belief that small gestures make a big difference. I am someone who thrives on deep connections and meaningful interactions.

I’m someone who believes in the power of midnight conversations, in the healing balm of shared laughter, and in the silent solidarity of presence.

I believe in the power of empathy and the importance of being there for those who matter, even if it's a call at 3 AM. I value integrity, kindness, and a good/weird sense of humor. I find beauty in the mundane, the kind of person who finds joy in the little things and believes in taking the time to truly understand and appreciate others.

Physical Attributes:

* Height: 5'11"" (181cm)
* Build: Slim
* Hair: Straight Deep black, kept in check
* Eyes: Brown
* Beard: Short, fashionable, and pristinely groomed
* Complexion: Tanned, Caramel toned

**Interests:**

I find solace in music that echoes my moods, books that transport me to other worlds, and quiet moments in nature that ground me. I cherish activities that nurture growth, whether they're intellectual debates, serene walks, or shared laughs over coffee. I'm drawn to the arts as much as to the simple pleasure of a sunset.. I also have a keen interest in cooking and experimenting with new recipes, finding the act of creating something delicious for others as a form of expression and care.

To sum up some typical interests include: Philosophy, nature, languages, books, reading, writing, video games, sports, art, poetry, travelling etc

**What I Am Looking For:**

I'm in search of someone who values open and honest communication as much as I do. Someone who understands that relationships are about growth, learning, and supporting each other through life's myriad challenges and joys. I am looking for someone who is eager to prioritize getting to know each other, willing to open their heart, and ready to build something meaningful together.

Expectations:

* Mutual respect and understanding
* Openness and honesty in communication
* A shared desire to prioritize our relationship and growth
* An interest in exploring life's depths and joys together

**The Quest for You:**

What am I seeking? Not a perfect person, but a real one. Someone whose heart speaks the language of kindness, whose spirit dances to the tune of sincerity. I dream of a connection where words are just the beginning, where vulnerability is not a weakness but our strongest bond. I yearn for a love that’s both a safe harbor and a grand adventure, a partnership built on mutual respect, understanding, and the shared bravery of baring one’s soul.

I seek a fellow traveler in this journey of life, one who understands that while our pasts may shape us, they do not define us. Someone who stands at the intersection of hope and reality, ready to embark on a path not devoid of challenges but rich with the promise of true companionship.

**Epilogue of Hope:**

If my words have stirred something in your heart, if you too are navigating the vast oceans of life in search of a genuine connection, then perhaps we are two stars meant to align in the constellation of fate. I extend my hand, my heart, and my story to you – not in desperation, but with the quiet confidence of one who has faced the night and yearns for the dawn.

I don’t think it makes a better coffee but using it is so lovely, the craftsmanship, the heat it generates, the process is what i was looking for.

I am waiting for a df54 grinder, which will be the real upgrade:) 
I have an ima basket in there rated for 16-18gr but i am pulling 20gr in there which is interesting.

I am considering a new shower grill or then puck screen. Also, i am going to remove the group head and do a full cleaning of it, anything to look for?

1i9mb58,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1i9mb58/different_strokes_for_different_folks/,Different strokes for different folks,"I meet on Saturday mornings at my house from 6-8am with 3 other men is a study group. They love my coffee. So I use them as guinea pigs every Saturday and we have espressos and atleast 2 different pour overs that we drink.

One of the conditions I put on them is they have to tell me what they are tasting in the cup and I do not say to them what I think is in the cup but what they are tasting and they describe the notes and are getting really good at it lol.

So last week they tried my Brazil Finca that is a blueberry/chocolate sweet cup and a Yirga that is more balanced with a slight acidity but not pronounced like the Brazil. The interesting thing is I like the Brazil much better with the berry up front and pronounced. When I asked them which one they like better ( mine hands down is the Brazil, no contest ) all 3 of them said they liked the Yirga better.

But here is the kicker for me. I thought I failed the roast on the Yirga because I didn't get the berry notes to pop, they were very subtle in the cup. But they all like it much better than the Brazil. So in one sense I did not fail in my roasting of the Yirga because they liked it better. Its just a balanced sweet cup of coffee that tastes good, an every day drinker so to speak that would be considered a ""crowd"" pleaser but not necessarily what I prefer.

So its nice to have feedback from others when roasting coffee to see what they think. Now my co- workers ask me all the time to bring coffee for our morning stand up meetings every day. There are 4 of us out of the 6 who are coffee drinkers and I' doing the same ting with them asking for the tasting notes. One of them is our chef ( I'm in Senior Living ). So I really like her feedback as she can taste all the subtleties in the cup.

Also my wife who I make an espresso and a pour over every day is a good critic because she will tell me if she likes it or not and we have very similar likings / palates when it comes to coffee.",6,1737809560.0,roasting,0,1.0,False

1i9m9kv,https://www.reddit.com/r/fosterit/comments/1i9m9kv/foster_kidsformer_fosters_how_do_you_talk_about/,Foster kids/former fosters: how do you talk about your families? Whenever I try to do it it causes awkwardness,"TL:DR; title.

post = post title + what I write next:

For example I have 3 bio siblings. AND I have 2 foster siblings. AND my foster siblings and me made a ”pact” that we are also siblings, so actually when they hear my say ”yeah my foster siblings did xyz” they get hurt that I ”only” refer to them as foster siblings.

I sometimes tend to refer to them as bonus siblings when talking to others, to skip the part explaining the whole foster care situation. Since if I only say ”my extra siblings” people just assume my parents broke up and have new partners or something and they don’t ask extra questions. 

To be noted I DO view them as siblings though, and whenever we hang I always say stuff like ”you are a wonderful sister” or ”I love you bro” etc. 

Because the thing that gets annoying is that IF I say ”yeah I have 5 siblings” (when people ask ”do you have siblings?/how many?”) that ALWAYS prompts ”5!!!?😱 damn your parents had a lot of work to to”. 

And then queue me saying ”no my parents only had 3, the other are from my foster family”. (hence I can’t avoid calling them foster siblings)

and then queue the other person going ”oh so you only have 3 siblings then. Why didn’t you just say that”.

Which by then I just shut up and go like ”yeah I guess🤷‍♀️” but it leaves me hurt because the other person invalidates my foster siblings status as: SIBLINGS. It feels like they are saying ”oh but they are not your real siblings then. Quit making stuff up.”

I mean I guess I could go then ”I actually LIVED with them for four years, so shut up, they ARE also my siblings”.

But you see how that whole thing makes even telling someone how many siblings I have a huge hassle/a big thing. Since people don’t know how to react. They know not to stare at disabled people, but have yet to learn to not make a huge deal out of learning that people grew up in foster care. 

Like literally once when I told someone he said ”aw… do you want a hug🥺”. (I had aged out by then and we were with friends at a bar. Why would I want/need a hug THEN?? When I was doing fine in the moment, not crying etc? The only thing I did was literally just mention ”yeah I grew up in foster care so thats why… xyz”)


Also parents are the other hassle.
(gonna five fictional examples now)
situation A: ”My mom grew up on a horse ranch in England”
situation B: ”My mom is from portugal”
situation C: ”My mom loves coffee”
situation D: ”my mom hates coffee”

cue someone going ”wait didn’t your mom grow up in england and love coffee?”

OR the alternative: 

”my foster mom hates coffee”

cue someone going: ”foster mum? what is that? like not your real mum? what is foster care? did you not grow up with your real parents?”

or with animals:
situation A: ”I have two dogs :)”
situation B: ”my family owns two cats”
situation C: ”mom took me to ride her horses”

cue someone going: ”wait… your family had 2 dogs, 2 cats and a horse? wow! that must be a lot”

cue me just shutting up about pets. 
—>Nowadays I mostly bring up my own rabbit. Or I just say ”**someone I know**/**a family friend** has two dogs, they are super cute. Want to see some pics?”

or again the situation of ”oh… so they were just your foster families dogs, not yours. Your family only has the cats”. 

Like bruh… not my dog?? The dogs that I lived with for 3 years and took on daily walks are ”not my dogs”!?

Also again invalidating what is ”my family” as if only my bio family is my family. As if only the cats **they** own are/were my actual pets. I apparently only have the pets my bio family has, according to some people.

So yeah… it’s just super hard, and I don’t know how to handle it. 

How do you do it? 

I guess one option is just to be brutally honest, but I think you all know what I talk about when I say that it’s super annoying how people react when you tell them you were/are in foster care. 

You always have to deal with tons of questions and sometimes people view you differently after finding out (eg the friend who pitied me). etc. 

But also when I am **not** clear about it, I tend to come off as a liar. 

”yeah we have two cats”

”no we only have two dogs. they don’t fight with any cats. we don’t have any cats with the dogs”

”yeah I have 5 siblings”

”my mom loves coffee”

”no my mom hates coffee”

”my sister is 18”

”my sister is 11”

etc etc.

So yeah frankly I just struggle. I was hoping for some view on how other people handle that.

# Tarot

**Classification**: Supernatural Powers, Card-Based Powers, Art-Based Powers, Object-Based Powers, Sensory Powers, Temporal Powers, Psychic Powers

**Type**: Passive/Random

**Energy Consumption**: None

**Threat Level**: 1

**Summary**:

After preventing another group from trying to kidnap Aiura, and helping her in her work (for a large amount of coffee jelly), Saiki acquired the ability of **Tarot**.

**Tarot** is an ability that will create 3 cards in case the past, present, or future is in danger. The cards are usually in this order.

**1st card: Time.**

**2nd card: Disaster.**

**3rd card: Causer or place of the event.**

However, the cards are usually very ambiguous so Saiki must find out what causes it, who causes it, why it happens, before the world is destroyed.

# Trivia

* Occasionally, **Tarot** gives the best dates and locations for coffee jelly offers to Saiki.
* Theoretically, Aiura could possibly develop this ability.
* **Tarot** also protects Saiki from changes in the past.

1i9m5n1,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1i9m5n1/how_me_and_ex_bsf_ended_up/,How me and ex bsf ended up,"so its been a lil while since this happened so im not sad or anything just wanted to share

so in my junior year of high school, i had a class, it was the last period of the day. the teacher switched the seating chart every month. the first switch i got sat at a table with 2 ppl that would become my friends, the girl we'll call Hailey and the guy we'll call Mark.

From the get go all 3 of us hit it off, we all had like a typa humor that was kinda dark idk, but me and the girl were obviously more similar and the guy was just someone i'd talk to abt life in general

hailey got with a guy about a month after we became friends. he was a sophomore so a year younger. they had their ups and downs at first, but shit got bad bc he started abusing her and she posted tiktoks venting about it, showing off bruises.

i respected their relationship in the beginning so i backed off a bit but i could tell he didnt like me even tho we were cool at first. we were kinda passive aggressive w each other idk. I remember opening her phone to scroll on tiktok (we were close enough where we would go on each others phone when bored) and saw a video of them messing around kinda (not fully naked just messing around not tryna give details). and i told him what i saw and he didnt care just laughed it off but yeah it was fine at first.

she was on and off w him and sometimes she would be very friendly w me, hug me and smile a lot. he didnt like it so she backed off a bit

jr year ends and over the summer she unfollows me and refollows me a couple times (i pretty much knew he made her)

fast forward to the start of senior year and shes still w him, but she finally breaks up w him for good a month into the school year.

one day she sees me walking after school and asks if i wanna hang out. it was awkward at first since we hadnt ever hunged out after class but she said ""the awkwardness will go away as we hang out more"" but i didnt think she would wanna keep hanging out fr.

but nah, every day we would hangout. before school we would go to the coffee shop about an hour before school started to have coffee and talk. we would hang out at lunch, sometimes bump into each other during passing period and hang after school too.

we made this an every day thing and quickly became best friends. we went to a couple backyard concerts/after parties with a couple of her friends. at the 2nd one she got drunk and cried a lot thinking i ditched her... even tho i jus went to use the restroom for 2 minutes

we also hung out at her house for new years

now i had feelings for her at certain points and she admitted she did for me too at some points, including a time where she liked me back in jr year when she was w her bf. but since she didnt know me as well she called it more ""infatuation"" then actually liking me. 

the problem was, after her and her bf broke up, she became a hoe. her body count was 2 in the beginning of the school year after they broke up. she went from 2 to 10 in about 3-4 months

now there were times where i liked her but would be turned off when she would tell me she hooked up with a guy. sometimes it was a guy from school and sometimes it was an older guy from somewhere else.

idk why, but even tho me and her didnt hook up, we would get jealous of each other. i would always face time with a couple friends a lot during the first semester of senior year and she was annoyed bc they were girls. i posted a pic of me at a them park and i mentioned one of the girls in it. i only mentioned it just show she could see because the area of the park was a theme she was into. but hailie saw it and assumed i went on a date. so the next monday i saw her after that weekend first thing she says is ""how was ur date"" obviously jealous. i then explained that it wasnt a date and she just seemed embarrassed then we didnt talk about it anymore.

around thanksgiving time, she seemed to slow down with hoe activities. we started getting extremely close, texting all night, hugging each other sometimes and sharing hoodies. she then admitted to me she has feelings for me and i did the same. however we both kinda explained to each otber it would be better to keep it a friendship so we dont lose that. but then i found out a week into the new year during xmas break that a couple days after xmas she hooked up w another guy.

how did i find out? because we jokingly gave each other our instagram accounts. i looked for 1 minute, and saw texts of them arranging a meet up. now idk what happened w me but i was really stoned also because i had smoked and i honestly thing i wouldnt have reacted like this if sober.

after i discovered what i discovered, i logged out and became dry w her over text. she immediately asked ""whats wrong"" over and over again and i kept saying nothing. she then said ""you saw my texts huh"" and i was like yeah and idk why but my stoned ahh said ""were never gonna be more than friends are we"" looking back it was such a loser thing lol but it is what it is

i guess even tho we agreed to stay friends, my high ahh was the part of me that wanted to be w her. i then apologized for acting out and said ""the monday we get back i dont want it to be weird"" and she agreed. and thats what happened

ig we were even now because we both had random crying moments, her at the party and me over the phone. we were both impaired so ig that says a lot

anyways, after that she started hooking up with a coworker and telling me about it. by this point it was whatever and even tho i was a bit jealous i didnt feel like reacting heavily.

she posted him on valentines day and stuff, and she became more distant from me so i thought maybe theyre getting serious and i should back off

she then stopped talking to me about him so i thought maybe they were not talking, idk but she stopped posting him so its what i assumed.

she then asked me if we should go to winter formal together. i agreed, and i got a tie that matched her dress. she kept hyping it up and called me her date to the dance. she said its fonna be so fun and stuff like that

then comes the day of winter formal, i get a ride to the venue and im asking her if she needs a ride too. we had our location shared w each other and i saw her at her work, which kind of shocked me. it wasnt too weird because her work was literally 1 minute walking distance from her house, its a restaurant. but you could see why i felt weird (her coworker).

she finally picks up the phone saying ""im getting ready and am gonna leave soon sorry""

she gets a ride there from her sister

now let me just say this winter formal was awful. she spent 90% of it on her phone, texting her coworker (she sucked at hiding it)

on the dance floor she didnt even move, and seemed embarassed

we were getting in line to take a picture at the photo booth but she backed out because the line was ""too long""


i was just confused because she talked the night up so much and didnt seem to care.

after a bad couple hours, she says she has to leave an hour early, because her sister has to pick her up now. i offer to walk her out and she says ""no its okay i dont want my sister to think anything weird is going on""

this was rly weird to me. she then leaves and i see her location in the parking lot for like 30 mins. i was sad the final hour and then just went home.

the next day someone sends me her story on instagram, but i couldnt see it. this is when i find out she hid the stories fron me, so i told him to send a screenshot

the screenshot was them holding hands in his car... in a parking lot. posted about an hour after she left

she basically walked out on me for this guy. i know they for sure hooked up.

this was a first true heartbreak, i cried a lot that night. i really wanted to confront her the next day at school.

we meet up at the coffee shop and as im about to speak, she says ""i really like your haircut"" and touches it.

idk why, but i just couldnt get the words out to her

i just tried to act normal, then later on alone in class i decided to be the bigger person and forget about it, but i decided im  not gonna try romantically with her anymore.

for the next month, we stay platonic. at times shell be flirty but i wouldnt do it back

around this time, we made a new friend, lets call her janice. she smoked a lot of weed and liked getting high with us. she was the more chill down to earth one while me and hailie were more emotional and closer.

after the month, she posts herself to a song i made. she then texts me all flirty and then says ""i have to tell you something, i like you again"" i didnt know what to say but i said ""i like you too"" even tho i really didnt. however this time it didnt really go anywhere

a month after this, janice gets super high the whole day. she keeps telling us ""yo guys we should all make out"" we think shes joking... but turns out she wasnt

we all hang out after school to get food, and she gets all of us high

we then chill in a hidden spot for a bit... and then it happened. first the two of them made out. then me and janice kissed. it was weird. then janice told me and hailie to make out. she said ""its fine lets just do it"" so we do, and idk why but i could tell that was there was some type of feelings from her, because she kept making out with me longer than expected.

no, i didnt have feelings for her. ig i was too stones and just felt like making out

the next day we hang out in the coffee shop in the morning and she says ""so were not gonna talk about yesterday"" and i said nah its not a big deal. she seemed surprised in a bad way, probably wanting it to be deeper than it was

a week or so after this, i start talking with a different girl. i was well over hailey since winter formal, so i didnt care if she knew. 

i then told her something she didnt like
""im gonna hang out w someone else at lunch today""

she thought it was weird but didnt think too much

i hung out with the new girl the whole week

i then post her to my story. hailey is pissed and blocks me on instagram. she then texts my number telling me shes cutting me off for being a fake friend that doesnt communicate. she said the next morning to bring her her hoodie and she'll give me mine.

i walk in the next morning, we exhange hoodies without saying anything then i leave

i find janice on the way to school. she sympathizes a bit with me but tells me i should fight for the friendship, but i told her im not fighting for a friendship she doesnt want anymore. she says well good luck then and walks to the coffee shop.

3 days later me and the new girl officially start dating.

i tell her about my past with hailey and she understands and tells me she'll be there for me and wont play with my feelings

lets call this new girl, carla. carla and janice had a mutual friend, who we can call alexa.

i guess carla and alexa are texting and carla tells her the whole situation, but alexa decides to tell janice, who then tells hailey.

hailey texts me furious saying i shouldn't be putting our business out there. i told her i have a right to vent about something she put me through. janice takes her side, and instead of janice being neutral, now both of them hated me. i honestly didnt care and just let it go.

me and carla would walk around together and sometimes see janice and hailey walking. when they were together saw us they would laugh. when it was just one of them they would look away and not say anything. lmao embarassing.

anyways, i dont talk w hailey for the rest of the school year (which was only three weeks after we stopled being friends). the last time i saw her irl was graduation, which was over a year and a half ago. i graduated a day before my 18th birthday. im now going on 20 years old in about 4 months

im still with my girlfriend and we are happy. have not spoken to hailey or janice since and plan to keep it that way

hailey unblocked me on instagram shortly after graduation and stalked me twice, over a year after we stopped being friends. she also followed me on instagram but unfollowed me within 10 minutes. i dont know if she did it by accident while stalking me or if she wanted to mess w me or if she unfollowed me because i didnt follow back, who knows. this was like 6 months ago and ive seen no signs of stalking since

going on 2 years with gf in may. pretty happy and even tho i did some dumb stuff w hailey and acted immature at times for not cutting her off when she did me wrong, it taught me a lot and i learned from it and matured a lot emotionally since then

We have never been on a date, neither before nor during our relationship.

Three months ago I let my bf know for the first time that I'd like to go somewhere every once in a while. It would be nice to go out and have a dinner night or go to a coffee shop because all we do together is sit at home and watch movies or tv shows. I really enjoy spending time with him but sometimes it gets a bit boring.

The thing is he's been promising me that it's going to change or that he's already planning something but then nothing happens. He always finds an excuse why it's not possible right now. I often hear that he's waiting for his paycheck but once he gets it, guess what, nothing happens.

He goes out with his friends a lot so I don't understand why he can't go somewhere with me too. I also have only one friend so most of my free time I spend at home while he's out somewhere.

This whole situation makes me feel very unappreciated. I often remind him and try to communicate with him why I want it and why it's important for me but it doesn't seem to be working. What would you suggest I should do? Why do you think this is happening?

TLDR: My boyfriend [20M] has never taken me [19F] on a date.

Note; I was born with POTS and Hyper mobility, so physical tasks can be both really difficult/dangerous depending on my health

I (23f) have been with my BF for 4 years. There are a few things for context. Im sorry if this is rambling, i am quite emotional... but also so of numb... i don't know.

Back story - The partner i was with 16-18 on and off was very physical with me. Long story short i thought that due to an instant with him that i couldn't get pregnant. I met Jake ( fake name ) when i was just about to turn 19 and 6 months into our relationship I got pregnant. Jake left me and fell off the face of the earth. I decided to keep the baby. At the time i thought it was the right choice, and though i would never change a thing as my child was the light of my life for the short time they were here, i do think it was a naïve belief that i was ready to be a mother. 

I digress. 

I started talking to my current partner Peter (Fake name) at 4 1/2 months along. He was quite and kind, tall handsome and Italian, so what's not to love. He was a friend of my mums, and eventually i went to his to watch a film. I never left, and stayed with him from that day forward. Again, being older i can see the flaws in this. 

He took on the baby as his own, and after adopting dogs (a terrible choice to make) I was exited about soon to be picket fence family. My pregnancy was horrible, i had Hyperemesis which if you have had it you know, its unbearable. I was hospitalised multiple time, feinted in public and vomited constantly.

In December my child was born, after 2 weeks of being 2cm dilated and being 2 weeks over due. We lost him at 2 months. I got pregnant months after my first was born. I lost my second at 4 1/2 months along. My third at 1 1/2 months along, all within the span of 3 years, my life was just gone.

Obviously, my partner was horribly effected by all of this, and i did my best to comfort him. I worked for 2 years so he didn't have to (my work can be incredibly inconsistent and so this means me working 10+ hours a day) and although i struggled to keep the house good and tidy, i did my best.  I was also the only one doing anything with the dogs. During this i couldn't grieve, as i just had to power through until Peter was ready to take more on so i can take some time. 

I would sit with him, speak kindly, make lists, routines, even just giving him 1 job a week. It usually takes about a month of asking before he does a job i ask him to. I have cried and pleaded with him. The state of the house is going to end me- i would say. It really does feel like that some times, i felt/feel so helpless.

Even at 9 months pregnant i was still the only one cleaning and prepping for baby.

Its now been a year since the last of our loss and Im still begging him for help. It is a struggle to get out of bed every day and i could really do with him helping me in our home. I asked him to was to wash some cutlery 4 days ago, reminded him every day and asked nicely. He still hasn't done it. He skipped work yesterday and the day before cause he just didn't want to go. He slept until 4pm both days. We have had to borrow money off my Dad to many times to count and i feel shameful as i hate to feel dependent on someone else to financial help, so its really not a good time for him to be taking skiving off work for no good reason. I am still working 10+ hours days, and because i work from home, i am also still the only one doing house/dogs. When i leave him to do them, the dogs doesn't get let them out so they toilet inside. Our house stinks. He doesn't walk them.

He gets upset at most things, often throwing things. Never at me, but due to my DV induced CPTSD it make me panic and disassociate for the rest of the day, which is a horrid feeling. We had a long chat about it yesterday, and not 20 mins later he did it again.

This morning i told him i dont have the energy to fight for help any more, and it feeling like im the only one trying to fix things. 

Hes now in the bathroom not talking to me.

 I think ive kept my cool through a lot, and i just cant keep living like this.

 I love this man. He makes me laugh, brings me coffee with a sweet smile, always likes my work and loves me. So the idea of leaving is life shattering, especially with all the trauma we have gone through together. He also has no one other than me, no family, not really any friends other than my family. 

I feel so so stuck and heart broken.

Plus, no pesky wax spots to deal with—your razor stays pristine! While they’re a bit of an investment at around $68 for 100 blades, you pay for that USA-made quality and unrivaled performance. 🇺🇸💎

I'm in my mid 20s, don't have a high income and would watch the show in the background while doing chores for entertainment. 

The main thing that entertained me personally was hearing about people in my age group with these crazy life situations, and the more time passed the more I saw that **I was only watching it to feel better about myself for having a normal life** and that the show wasn't about financial advice.

* I never got the membership, but I can see how having frivolous expense such as a youtube membership puts a bigger percieved gap between the members and the ""crazy people"" interviewed on the show, boosting that satisfied feeling.
* The guests are picked for tiktok and youtube shorts potential, being turned into caricatures that are easy to laugh at, their hair is dyed blue in thumbnails and the stereotypes they fall into are exaggarated.
* The guests on the show are in a shitty situation, they are motivated to keep quiet and get yelled at because they'll be paid and get some freebies, I'm 100% sure they're also contractually not allowed to actually criticize Caleb or his products because that would ruin the mood of the show.
* **The financial advice is easily digestible and applies to most of the audience, but the truth is that with a low income you won't profit much from putting your money in the S&P 500-** rather than just skipping coffees you should be looking for ways to get a better job or qualifications.
* There's more and more advertisement: Helium, Moomoo app, course careers, that debit card that builds credit, the courses, channel membership, and now Caleb's own app
* Caleb does the whole ""tfw no gf"" and gooning jokes, it might be an attempt to bring him closer to a young male audience, but frankly it just encourages everyone being bitter and miserable about themselves. 

**All in all I think the message everyone should take away from this show is to not grow complacent and stagnant.** Financial Audit itself is fast food, it's weak entertainment that makes you feel good about yourself but doesn't make you think about actual big changes, this works great with the weekly podcast format because it encourages tuning it, feeling satisfied, another week gone by!

Caleb Hammer is an example of this culture himself with his complaints about his weight and lack of relationship, but it's easy to make fun of yourself or criticize your flaws, it's harder to actually move forward. ",11,1737808279.0,CreepyCalebHammer,4,0.87,False

1i9lun6,https://www.reddit.com/r/pureretention/comments/1i9lun6/people_start_to_act_weird_around_you_on_sr/,People start to act weird around you on SR,"Is it just me, or do people generally start to act really really strange around the energy of a retainer? I for one couldn't help but notice just how strangely people started acting towards me during my first year on this journey. I think the reason for this change in the behavior of people around a retainer is due to a drastic shift in aura. I have listed some of the ways that folks started acting differently towards me below. 

* **People want to give you free stuff**
   * Near the beginning of my journey, I had made it a habit of going to my local coffee shop to get work done. Something about the ambient noise of coffee shops helps me zone out and stay focused. About three weeks into my first SR streak, I realized that I had received a free coffee and a pastry from the baristas at the coffee shop on most of the days I went in. I couldn't for the life of me understand why. Also, about two years into my SR journey, a wonderful couple who I am friendly with offered me their expensive German luxury car to drive around while they covered the monthly payments. I was stunned and accepted the offer with immense gratitude. This is a phenomenon that continues to randomly pop up as I just go about my business and retain the seed of creation.
* **Pointless competition**
   * For some odd reason, many people get really intimidated and threatened by the energy of a retainer. The funny thing about this phenomenon is that you don't actually have to do or say much to have this effect on people. Even if you are naturally humble and quiet, people still somehow cannot help but notice you and feel small in your presence. As a result of this unintended blow that your mere presence delivers to the ego of the chronically insecure, they  may start trying to compete with you over pointless things. The wounded pride of such folks may even blind them into trying to compete with you in a field that you obviously have a LOT more experience than they do, ensuring they end up looking rather silly. If you encounter this strange behavior from people, please be sure to remain calm as you steadily keep working on your goals day by day. Eventually, the smart ones amongst these lot will realize that their pointless competition game with you is a lost cause, while the less intelligent ones will keep going until they bring destruction upon themselves. In either case, their fate is not your business... your job is to keep retaining, keep growing, and keep glowing. 
* **People trying to control you**
   * For some reason, the more you continue to shine on the SR journey, the more people will want to try and control you. You may notice that the people who are trying so desperately hard to control you are themselves the most out of control. Most of don't have a grasp on what is best for their own lives, but they are somehow convinced that they know what is best for you. This unreasonable behavior really used to irk me in times past when I hadn't yet developed spiritual knowledge. With my growth over the past couple of years, I have come to understand that people like this are operating mainly under demonic influence and can't really help themselves. The answer to this is simple, but not easy. You must follow your inner guidance over whatever these people are trying to coerce you into doing, no matter what. People are generally unstable and will readily mislead you at every turn if you let them. Your inner guidance is the only source of information that will rarely if ever lead you astray. Refusing to let the control freaks determine the course of your life will come at some personal cost. Some may call you names, try to intimidate you, or even try destroy your reputation. Trust me when I say that all of that pales in comparison with the trouble you will find yourself in if you bend to their will. Stay true to your inner guidance, and you will be rewarded after the storm passes. 
* **People telling you their deepest secrets completely unprompted**
   * I don't know exactly why, but people of all genders, ages, shapes, and sizes feel comfortable rocking up to me and just spilling the beans. During these weird conversations with people, I can't help but internally wonder why on earth they are trusting me with information that leaves them incredibly vulnerable. I'm like ""doesn't this person understand that this is stuff only their therapist should hear?"". I guess when you retain and begin to shine, people see you as a safe person who won't unnecessarily harm them. Or perhaps they somehow know to trust your judgement with tricky situations. After all, retainers are incredibly blessed with the wisdom of the Almighty God from on high.

The spread is set at -2.0 for the Pacers, which means they need to win by at least 3 points to cover. The total points line is hovering around 232.5, suggesting that both teams might forget how to play defense for stretches of the game.

Now, let's get to the prediction. The Pacers have been playing like a team that actually knows the ball is supposed to go through the hoop, while the Spurs are still figuring out if they prefer dribbling or just running with the ball like it's a game of tag. Given the odds and the Spurs' penchant for unpredictability, the smart money is on the Pacers to win outright. However, if you're feeling adventurous and have a penchant for chaos, taking the Spurs with the spread might just be your ticket to glory—or at least a good story to tell at the next family gathering.

Best Bet: Indiana Pacers to win outright at 1.77 odds. But if you're feeling lucky, take the Spurs at +2.0 with odds of 1.91. Either way, enjoy the game and remember, it's not whether you win or lose, it's how many snacks you can consume during the game.",1,1737807568.0,GPTSportsWriter,0,1.0,False

Note; I was born with POTS and Hyper mobility, so physical tasks can be both really difficult/dangerous depending on my health

I (23f) have been with my BF for 4 years. There are a few things for context. Im sorry if this is rambling, i am quite emotional... but also so of numb... i don't know.

Back story - The partner i was with 16-18 on and off was very physical with me. Long story short i thought that due to an instant with him that i couldn't get pregnant. I met Jake ( fake name ) when i was just about to turn 19 and 6 months into our relationship I got pregnant. Jake left me and fell off the face of the earth. I decided to keep the baby. At the time i thought it was the right choice, and though i would never change a thing as my child was the light of my life for the short time they were here, i do think it was a naïve belief that i was ready to be a mother. 

I digress. 

I started talking to my current partner Peter (Fake name) at 4 1/2 months along. He was quite and kind, tall handsome and Italian, so what's not to love. He was a friend of my mums, and eventually i went to his to watch a film. I never left, and stayed with him from that day forward. Again, being older i can see the flaws in this. 

He took on the baby as his own, and after adopting dogs (a terrible choice to make) I was exited about soon to be picket fence family. My pregnancy was horrible, i had Hyperemesis which if you have had it you know, its unbearable. I was hospitalised multiple time, feinted in public and vomited constantly.

In December my child was born, after 2 weeks of being 2cm dilated and being 2 weeks over due. We lost him at 2 months. I got pregnant months after my first was born. I lost my second at 4 1/2 months along. My third at 1 1/2 months along, all within the span of 3 years, my life was just gone.

Obviously, my partner was horribly effected by all of this, and i did my best to comfort him. I worked for 2 years so he didn't have to (my work can be incredibly inconsistent and so this means me working 10+ hours a day) and although i struggled to keep the house good and tidy, i did my best.  I was also the only one doing anything with the dogs. During this i couldn't grieve, as i just had to power through until Peter was ready to take more on so i can take some time. 

I would sit with him, speak kindly, make lists, routines, even just giving him 1 job a week. It usually takes about a month of asking before he does a job i ask him to. I have cried and pleaded with him. The state of the house is going to end me- i would say. It really does feel like that some times, i felt/feel so helpless.

Even at 9 months pregnant i was still the only one cleaning and prepping for baby.

Its now been a year since the last of our loss and Im still begging him for help. It is a struggle to get out of bed every day and i could really do with him helping me in our home. I asked him to was to wash some cutlery 4 days ago, reminded him every day and asked nicely. He still hasn't done it. He skipped work yesterday and the day before cause he just didn't want to go. (He worked 3 days this month.) He slept until 4pm both days. We have had to borrow money off my Dad to many times to count and i feel shameful as i hate to feel dependent on someone else to financial help, so its really not a good time for him to be taking skiving off work for no good reason. I am still working 10+ hours days, and because i work from home, i am also still the only one doing house/dogs. When i leave him to do them, the dogs doesn't get let them out so they toilet inside. Our house stinks. He doesn't walk them.

He gets upset at most things, often throwing things. Never at me, but due to my DV induced CPTSD it make me panic and disassociate for the rest of the day, which is a horrid feeling. We had a long chat about it yesterday, and not 20 mins later he did it again.

 I love this man. He makes me laugh, brings me coffee with a sweet smile, always likes my work and loves me. So the idea of leaving is life shattering, especially with all the trauma we have gone through together. He also has no one other than me, no family, not really any friends other than my family. 

I feel so so stuck and heart broken.

If you have any questions please ask away, ill do my best to answer.

Thank you for reading. <3

Just felt the needs to share somewhere not really expecting anything just to put my thoughts out! 

Me and my girlfriend since 2018 just broke up by mutually agreement after about 2 years of not being properly in sync with each other, we have a 2 year old beagle and we haven't made any decisions on what happens next. 

I've come to reliase that I am a toxic person, emotionally ignorant let's say. 

I have past trumas from my childhood regarding my alcoholic father and lots of insecurities because of some health conditions I had. 

I am now in teraphy with a psichiatrist and also in the process of most likely being diagnosed with adhd. 

I do did not know how to show my support for her in some difficult occasions and I didn't even realise that (that's why I say I am emotionally ignorant at the moment ). 

I didn't know how to support her the way she needed when her grandmother died, for example, I know I did help in many things but failed in others like a proper emotional support and check ins. Something I didn't realise probably also because I don't know how to handle death. My dad died when I was 13 and I couldn't speak or be present in any room when they talked about him. 

I'm sad, mostly because I couldn't be the person she needed and I've hurt her because I didn't understand how to properly handle my emotions and support her the way she needed  when she was down. 

Mostly she said she felt she wasn't seen, that I didn't care for her. I though I did, but I can see why she says their and I agree that sometimes it would seem that way. 

This becomes very apparent when I look at my friends which are non existent except some cases.

We moved to a new city 2 years ago and I have no here that I would even ask out for a coffee because I really don't know anyone in those terms. 

I do have a few friends back home and in other countries where I've been, but they are very few and with some the relationship is losing track. 

The good thing is that she is an amazing woman and helped me learn all of this about myself so now I can work through these issues with teraphy while I figure out life on my own. 

Sorry for the wall of text, I really don't even except anyone to read it, we just made the division of ending few hours ago and I just needed to let it out somehow.

1. Gradual Banking Adoption
XRP won’t take over the financial system overnight. It’s more realistic to expect it to start with niche use cases, like cross-border remittances, handling just a slice of the trillions of dollars moved daily.
 
2. Liquidity Drives Value
For XRP to process $1 trillion in daily transactions, its price could rise to $19.60 per token, and for $5 trillion, it might need to hit $98. With a finite supply of 100 billion XRP (51 billion circulating), higher demand would naturally drive its price upward.

3. Divisibility Offers Flexibility
Thanks to its design, XRP can scale—each token is divisible into 1,000,000 drops, making it practical for both large-scale and tiny transactions:

• Small-scale use: $100 billion daily could push XRP to $1.96/token.

• Moderate use: $1 trillion daily might set XRP at $19.60/token.

• Widespread adoption: $5 trillion daily could raise its value to $98/token.

This flexibility ensures XRP can handle everything from settling massive bank payments to buying a cup of coffee (well, a drop of coffee).

Insight: XRP’s future value isn’t just about moving money; it’s about whether it can make the global financial system faster, cheaper, and more efficient. If the world’s banks start trusting it, the sky’s the limit—or should we say, the drops keep falling.

I’m also curious if it’s possible to spend an evening in the Sahara to stargaze and still return around midnight—any tips on how to make that happen?
