He wants to do it next week but i'm expecting my period around the 11th, but it can be late sometimes and I am under stress at the moment. 

Thing is, things just got physical, I feel a bit weird bringing up my period right now. Kinda wrecks the mood in my head.  Also I havent dated properly, since my ex, a very long time ago, like many years, one coffee date that went no where... So maybe i'm out of the game. And maybe its fine.

  
Either way, Idk whether to dance around the subject a bit saying ""i really cant wait to stay in a hotel together, but next week might not be the best time for me"" or just tell him, because if it starts late, i kinda want a week after it starts to feel comfortable cause it's usually about 5 days long and some spotting after.  
He knows I'm not that busy at the moment so I could stay technically. I don't want him to feel rejected either if he doesn't realise what im hinting at. Maybe i could just suggest a date that would be after that time frame to show that I do want to.

Is there a way to say it where its highly obvious, but i just don't have to straight up say it? Or should I just man up lol. ",1,1736438939.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
1hxg6dv,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1hxg6dv/am_i_putting_too_much_pressure_on_myself/,Am I putting too much pressure on myself?,"My partner (M 42 straight) and I (F 35 bi) have been on and ENM for roughly the last 3 years, together 13 years total. A couple months ago I expressed the want to lean more into polyamory. Everything about it calls to me. I constantly crave seeing him be sexual with someone, I enjoy the thought of him having more love in his life and watching the beautiful love he gives me to someone else, I want all the personal growth, I want and adore the idea of it all. I, personally, don’t have the want or need to date outside our relationship at the moment because I’m truly fulfilled with the love he gives me, but the door is open for the future.

He’s been dipping his toes into dating solo for the last 4 weeks or so. Chatted with several girls, but no dates yet. However, he feels like he isn’t sure he could form actual feelings for someone and his purpose in doing this is for me, to fulfill my needs, not really for himself. He knows that I get so sexually and mentally fueled by this (because it stretches my personal growth which, in some way, makes me love myself even more) that he’s willing to do it. Every day I’m reminded that I’m his entire world. Sounds like the perfect man right? I’m pretty sure I’m the lucky one here, to say the least.

Here’s my issue. I want him to experience the beautifulness of polyamory and all the extra love it brings… in my heart space. But I’m coming up to reoccurring pitfalls and I can’t placed my finger on why. I want him to date, envision him out to coffee or dinner with someone, but the moment I think that possibility could actually be there, my body goes haywire. This has happened twice. My nervous system acts like it’s on a 12 pack of Red Bull, my throat closed up, my mind starts racing…I feel all the feels. Happiness, excitement, dread, worry, insecurity, compersion all simultaneously, which I think is normal. I tell myself it’s just because it’s the first one…it’ll get better after that because I know I want this.

I also want him to want this as badly as I do and not just do it for me, as sweet as that is, but the moment I think he could actually want it, again, I start to feel the same way. 

I wonder if I’m putting too much pressure on myself to fulfill the calling of my heart that I’m not relaxing in the present moment, but on the flip side, feel that of I don’t start undoing the monogamy wiring in my brain fully, I won’t be prepared for am event that maybe he does unexpectedly fall hard for someone. I want to be ready so I can handle it well. I’m doing all the shadow work and have made awesome strides, but my body sometimes just becomes a giant wack job and my brain gets muddy even though my heart says, “you’re ok”. 

Any advice to help me get over this hurdle? Maybe it’s not something I can fully process until the date or legitimate feelings start to occur? Should I just really listen to what he’s telling me he’s feeling and put down all the pressure of battling myself to become ready just to be ready?",1,1736438903.0,polyamory,1,1.0,False

As a (European) tourist seeking to stay somewhere close to Palm Beach without spending too much during high season we opted to stay in West Palm, in the Downtown area so that we could walk to Palm Beach easily by crossing the bridge. 

To my surprise, Downtown felt very safe and was really nice, especially walking from City Place to Clematis and around that area. Buildings seem new and well decorated, streets are clean, etc. We even encountered the farmers market on Saturday, super cool. And all the nicest restaurants and coffee shops seem to be located in West Palm more than Palm Beach. Tbh, we went there to visit Palm Beach but ended up liking West Palm even more. 

I’m wondering why is it flagged on Google (several forums, posts, etc.) as a dangerous area? Was it dangerous in the past or am I missing something? We visited mostly during the day but our area felt quite safe at night too. Writing this here in case helpful for other visitors. Several people flagged downtown as a dangerous area in the past, but it really didn’t feel so.

I made a coffee as usual, I pushed the excess of water until the hissing sound, I removed the basket and then, while preparing another coffee, I lowered the arms of the robot. No excessive pushing. No special resistance. But there was some kind of odd click when I was doing that. I set the basket on the piston for the second coffee and boom -- the water was all over the desk.

Is it normal for crowns to be sensitive...especially when they're just attached with temporary bonding/glue?

Bitcoin is no longer just the enigmatic currency of the internet underworld. Today, it’s the lifeblood of crypto enthusiasts, the darling of fintech rebels, and the apple of every tech-savvy investor’s eye. But for the uninitiated, diving into Bitcoin can feel like trying to decode an alien language with a soggy napkin. Enter Bitcoin BTMs (Bitcoin Teller Machines)—the shiny, touchscreen knights in digital armor—and our Bitcoin QR Code Maker app, the trusty sidekick that ensures every crypto interaction is smoother than a blockchain on overdrive.

Let’s talk Bitcoin BTMs, our app, and why you’ll soon be asking yourself, “Where has this been all my crypto life?”

# What the Heck is a Bitcoin BTM?

Picture this: You’re walking down the street, craving a burrito, but you only have Bitcoin. No worries—there’s a BTM nearby! A Bitcoin BTM is like your trusty neighborhood ATM, but instead of spitting out dollar bills, it connects you to the magical world of cryptocurrency.

Here’s how it works:

1. **Insert cash.** (Or, in some cases, your debit/credit card.)
2. **Scan your Bitcoin wallet QR code.**
3. **Boom!** Your Bitcoin wallet fills up faster than you can say ""blockchain.""

BTMs allow you to buy Bitcoin, and in many cases, sell it too. They’re the gateway drug to crypto—a simple, physical touchpoint for a digital phenomenon. But here’s the kicker: to use them efficiently, you need a QR code for your Bitcoin wallet. That’s where our Bitcoin QR Code Maker app comes in.

# Why QR Codes are the Real MVP

Let’s face it: typing out long Bitcoin wallet addresses is like trying to memorize the phone book. One typo, and your hard-earned crypto vanishes into the digital abyss. A QR code is the superhero cape that saves the day—scannable, secure, and stress-free.

Our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker app** makes creating QR codes as easy as ordering pizza online (but way cooler). Whether you’re a newbie buying Bitcoin at a BTM or a pro setting up a Bitcoin donate button for your blog, our app ensures that your wallet is always a quick scan away.

# How Our App Complements Bitcoin BTMs

You wouldn’t buy a car without a driver’s license, right? Similarly, you wouldn’t approach a BTM without your wallet QR code at the ready. Here’s why our app and Bitcoin BTMs are a match made in crypto heaven:

# 1. Instant QR Code Creation

No wallet QR code? No problem. With our app, you can whip one up in seconds. All you need is your wallet address, and voilà—a sleek QR code appears, ready to be scanned by any BTM.

# 2. Customization for Maximum Coolness

Why settle for boring black-and-white QR codes? Our app lets you customize your codes with colors, logos, and even gradients. Imagine pulling out a QR code that matches your brand or personality—it’s like accessorizing for the blockchain era.

# 3. Security You Can Count On

BTMs are all about convenience, but security is non-negotiable. Our app ensures your wallet address is encoded in a way that keeps prying eyes and sticky fingers at bay. It’s peace of mind, one scan at a time.

# A Day in the Life of a Bitcoin BTM and QR Code Power User

Let’s take a fun walk through what life looks like when you’ve got a Bitcoin BTM and our QR code app in your arsenal.

# Morning:

You stumble upon a tweet about Bitcoin hitting a new high. Inspired, you decide to stack some sats (that’s Bitcoin slang for small units of BTC). You pull up our app, generate a QR code for your wallet, and head to the nearest BTM.

At the BTM, you insert $100, scan your wallet QR code, and watch as Bitcoin magically appears in your digital wallet. Coffee and crypto in the morning—who needs a stock portfolio when you’ve got this?

# Afternoon:

Your buddy texts you, asking for a crash course in Bitcoin. You decide to send them $10 worth of BTC to get them started. With our app, you create a QR code for your wallet, share it with them, and voilà—they’re one step closer to becoming a Bitcoin maximalist.

# Evening:

You’re at a food truck that proudly displays a “Bitcoin Accepted Here” sticker. You use our app to quickly scan their wallet QR code and pay for your tacos in Bitcoin. No cash, no cards—just pure crypto coolness.

# The Future of Bitcoin BTMs and QR Codes

The synergy between Bitcoin BTMs and QR codes is undeniable. As BTMs become more widespread (seriously, they’re popping up faster than Starbucks locations), the demand for seamless QR code solutions will only grow. That’s where our app continues to shine.

Imagine a future where:

* Every small business has a Bitcoin QR code for payments.
* BTMs are as ubiquitous as vending machines.
* Crypto newbies and veterans alike use our app to manage their wallets effortlessly.

This isn’t just a dream—it’s the next logical step in the Bitcoin revolution.

# Why Choose Our Bitcoin QR Code Maker App?

We’re not just another app; we’re your crypto co-pilot. Here’s why users love us:

* **Ease of Use:** No technical jargon, no headaches. Just simple, intuitive QR code generation.
* **Versatility:** Whether it’s for BTMs, donations, or payments, we’ve got you covered.
* **Custom Features:** Add a splash of personality to your QR codes and stand out in a sea of boring black-and-white.
* **Trustworthiness:** We’ve built our app with top-notch security to keep your crypto safe and sound.

# Final Thoughts

Bitcoin BTMs and QR codes are a dynamic duo, transforming the way we interact with cryptocurrency. Whether you’re buying your first Bitcoin or sending crypto to a friend, having the right tools makes all the difference.

Our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker app** is here to ensure that every step of your crypto journey is hassle-free and enjoyable. So, the next time you spot a BTM, don’t shy away—embrace the future with a QR code in hand.

1hxg13y,https://www.reddit.com/r/mengetbetter/comments/1hxg13y/how_to_build_new_friendships_as_an_adult/,How to build new friendships as an adult,"Hey everyone,

I love my friends.

I actually don’t know what I would do without them and I’m aware that I’m extremely lucky to have it this way. Many people don’t unfortunately.

This post is dedicated to those who kind of grew apart from their friends as they got older but want to reconnect or want to make new friends to hang out with and enjoy spending their time together.

But.

Making friends as an adult feels like a completely different game, doesn’t it? When we were kids, all it took was sharing a Snickers bar or playing on the same team, and BAAMM, you had a new best friend. But as adults, it feels like those easy moments of connection are few and far between. Life gets busy, responsibilities pile up, and before you know it, years have gone by, and you’re wondering where your friend circle went.

If this sounds familiar, you’re not alone. A lot of guys struggle with this, even if no one talks about it. Somewhere along the way, we picked up this idea that friendship isn’t a priority anymore, that it’s a “luxury” we can’t afford with everything else on our plates. But the truth is, we need that

connection. Real connection. Not just the kind where you scroll through updates on social media but the kind where you can call someone up and say, “Man, I’m having a rough day,” and know they’ll listen.

So, how do you build new friendships when life already feels overwhelming? It starts with breaking down the idea that making friends as an adult is weird or desperate. It’s not. It’s human. And while it might take a little effort, it’s not impossible.

First, think about where you spend your time. Are you stuck in the same routine of work, home, and maybe the gym? If so, it’s going to be hard to meet new people. Look for places where connections can happen more naturally. Maybe a sports league, a hobby group, or even a class that interests you. The key is to find something you genuinely enjoy because shared interests are one of the easiest ways to break the ice.

Next, be open. This is the part that feels uncomfortable for a lot of guys because we’re not always great at putting ourselves out there. But being open doesn’t mean you have to overshare or be the life of the party. It just means you show up, be yourself, and be willing to take the first step. Whether that’s just saying hi, asking a question, or inviting someone to hang out. It might feel awkward, but that’s okay. Awkwardness is just part of the process.

Another thing to keep in mind is consistency. Friendships don’t usually happen overnight. They’re built over time through small, consistent interactions. Think about it, how often do you have a good chat with someone, but then you don’t follow up, and the connection fizzles out? Don’t let that happen. If you meet someone you vibe with, make an effort to keep in touch. Send a text, grab a coffee, or invite them to do something you both enjoy.

And here’s the big one. Let go of the idea that friendships have to look a certain way. Not every friend has to be your BEST friend or someone you hang out with every week. Some friendships are about sharing hobbies, some are about deep conversations, and some are just about having someone to grab a beer with and decompress. They all count.

If you’re reading this and thinking, “Yeah, but what if I put myself out there and get rejected?”, that’s a fair worry. Rejection sucks, no matter how old you are. But remember, it’s not a reflection of your worth. Some connections just don’t click, and that’s okay. The important thing is to keep trying. The right people are out there, they’re just waiting for you to cross paths.

Building friendships as an adult isn’t always easy, but it’s worth it. Life gets a little lighter when you’ve got people in your corner. And the best part? It’s never too late to start. So take that first step. You might be surprised by what, and who, you find.",1,1736438531.0,mengetbetter,0,1.0,False

I mentioned in a previous post about my LO wanting to come and watch a show I'm performing in, even though I don't even know her THAT well and we don't talk outside of work. I was doing quite well and then this happened and I'm spiralling again. Initially I thought she was being polite and wasn't that committed to seeing it but it's been brought up again and it seems she's genuinely interested in coming to see it. 

I know it's a bad outcome either way because I'll be a nervous wreck if she does come but equally I will be so disappointed and sad if she doesn't (she cancels quite often on work meetings and is a flaky person generally). She's promised to take me to lunch, meet me for coffee, attend events... it never materialises though. And I'm wondering if this is just another one of those. 

I know deep down she doesnt mean anything by it and is just a super busy person but these little crumbs of hope just drive me insane. Its not even like I've got a chance of a romantic relationship with her (she's female and married to a man and I'm female and gay) but these little snippets of hope at a connection with her always result in disappointment.

Usually a small town or county seat has a coffee shop that writes ""Isaiah 41:10"" on their cups. The interior decor is usually stuff from Big Lots or Hobby Lobby. I remember these started to really pop up a lot a decade ago, and many are still going strong.

What binds the church and coffee shops specifically? The communities support these businesses, and I tend to have nice experiences at these spots. They aren't too heavy on trying to recruit outside of the imagery.

1hxfzg2,https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/1hxfzg2/fpl_swiss_2024_25_stage_4/,FPL Swiss 2024 / 25 | Stage 4,"Good day, everyone!

We've come to the end of Stage 3, and there have been some interesting developments across all three Tiers. Have you survived, or have you thrived? Are you swindling, or are you dwindling? Are you out, or are you still in?

That's enough of that, let's crack on.

As usual, all past, and present, Stages can be found in the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fNW1MRZr7SMG84SAIdcY5tgbXJJ_hFdL8mUODUcjBUU/view?gid=1949867961).

EDIT: Somehow, I managed to take screenshots of the tables with premature Overall Ranks. Fortunately, it has not affected any outcomes as mentioned below... or unfortunately, depending on which side you sit.

# Stage 2

# [Tier 1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fNW1MRZr7SMG84SAIdcY5tgbXJJ_hFdL8mUODUcjBUU/edit?gid=208496951#gid=208496951)

**DIVISION 1**

*Scenarios:*

* A win for ***\_13characters*** will secure the Stage 3 title, but anything less, and ***leosondek*** can nick it.
* If ***Acrobatic\_Employ\_798*** and ***theseane*** both win, it'll go down to a 4-way H2H battle. If either lose, the risk being relegated.
* ***StuartA19*** must win, along with a loss for ***Acrobatic\_Employ\_798***, if there is to be any chance of survival.
* ***EpiKnightz*** will be relegated.

A win for u/\_13characters has indeed secured the Stage 3 Tier 1 title.

u/Acrobatic\_Employ\_798 beats u/leosondek in the final GW and they finish 2nd and 3rd respectively.

u/theseane lost, and u/EpiKnightz won, meaning it went down to H2H, and that was decided in Match 1, with the former winning by a single point. It's quite brutal when you look back at that GW - the final match of the GW was Bournemouth v. West Ham, and until West Ham were awarded a penalty in the 87th minute, u/EpiKnightz was leading. Now, they're relegated to Division 2.

u/StuartA19 lost their crucial tie, and finish bottom.

**DIVISION 2**

*Scenarios:*

* ***Name19389*** (4x wins) is up against their only challenger, ***Fooicus***, in a H2H for the top spot. ***Name19389*** will still be promoted to Division 1. ***Fooicus*** only needs to avoid defeat in order to earn promotion.
* ***FanFareApp*** and ***larsriedel*** need ***Fooicus*** to falter, but a win for both is essential, and ***FanFareApp*** holds the H2H advantage.
* ***Vijaygarv*** has a must-win tie. Anything less, and it's relegation to Division 3.
* ***Dioulio*** is already relegated.

u/Name19389 won the title decider, and finishes top with a 100% record. u/Fooicus remains in the Promotion places after a 3-way H2H where Overall Rank was the tie-breaker.

Despite the wins, u/larsriedel and u/FanFareApp finish 3rd and 4th.

u/Vijaygarv descends once again, down to Division 3, having only won a single match in Stage 3, while u/Dioulio is rooted to the bottom with 5x losses.

https://preview.redd.it/wk69dhemsybe1.png?width=1886&format=png&auto=webp&s=da5564d717fd43c8db987b1ddd38e0096c4a36de

**DIVISION 3**

*Scenarios:*

* ***ZAK5UMA*** will be the Division 3 winner - three Stage wins in a row.
* ***Loosee123***, ***Andrew643521***, ***soximent***, ***JS794*** are all on 2x wins each, so all to play for.
* ***lolAdvantage*** is eliminated.

u/ZAK5UMA was already guaranteed to finish top, so can be forgiven for not putting up a fight against u/soximent, who's win secures their place for now.

u/Andrew643521 beat u/JS794 to claim the next promotion spot and move up to Division 2.

u/Loosee123 losses out to u/lolAdvantage at the bottom, meaning both are eliminated from the league. However, u/Loosee123 has a strong OR to go along with a solitary Division win. As long as that is kept up, a place in the Champions Cup beckons.

https://preview.redd.it/4gmk5d0msybe1.png?width=1888&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9e45ad38c39f0e1b45af8d7d16e07a3beee633d

**DIVISION 4**

*Scenarios:*

* ***rdtalks*** and ***utham12*** lead the way to survival.
* ***JonnyTic*** and ***Justchillin1123*** each need to win, or it's game over.
* ***StraightDifference75*** and ***Zakedawn*** will be eliminated.

u/rdtalk wins, and finishes top, and stays alive in the competition.

Unfortunately for u/utham12, they lost to u/Justchillin1123, meaning they swap places, with u/utham12 eliminated. They should be safe in the Champions Cup, though, with two Division wins under their belt, and a solid top 20k OR.

Given that's the top two sorted, everyone else is eliminated. Commiserations to u/JonnyTic, u/Zakedawn and u/StraightDifference75, who all now await the Consolation Cup.

https://preview.redd.it/v1fz3xilsybe1.png?width=1886&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1b1b4022275660656b7b1439b220bb478a44bb9

# [Tier 2](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fNW1MRZr7SMG84SAIdcY5tgbXJJ_hFdL8mUODUcjBUU/edit?gid=2077603926#gid=2077603926)

**DIVISION 1**

*Scenarios:*

* ***Long-Seaworthiness50*** holds the H2H advantage in a 3-way tie at the top, but there's still work to do. A loss means they will lose the top-spot.
* ***sparrowhawk73*** needs to win to claim the Stage 3 title for themselves.
* ***coolBballer*** has a chance if they win, but needs ***sparrowhawk73*** to not win.
* ***Vegetable\_Design8330*** and ***CardozoSmash*** face off against each other in a fight for survival.
* ***QuantumParadox\_27*** is relegated.

u/Long-Seaworthiness50 was the only manager in that top three that managed to secure a win, so they finish top of Stage 3 Tier 2.

u/sparrowhawk73 and u/coolBballer still finish in safe places, so remain in Division 1 as we head towards Stage 4.

A win for u/CardozoSmash against u/Vegetable\_Design8330 was enough to ensure survival in division 1, as u/Vegetable\_Design8330 is relegated along with u/QuantumParadox\_27.

https://preview.redd.it/1r9rjh7gsybe1.png?width=1908&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b897ad3df6f460d4beda74d51986f7fc8bb0faf

**DIVISION 2**

*Scenarios:*

* ***wo27*** is guaranteed to finish top of Division 2 regardless of any result.
* ***bb53040*** is guaranteed promotion, having a better H2H against any contenders.
* ***FPLExpert*** v. ***NielsRandomShirt*** is effectively redundant, and both will remain mid-table.
* ***NoobyDoobyDoooo*** will definitely be relegated, regardless of any result, due to H2H.
* ***DiamondPalkia*** is guaranteed to go down.

Literally nothing was ever going to change here.

u/wo27 lost, but remains top thanks to a H2H win against u/bb53040, who won their match.

u/FPLExpert beta u/NielsRandomShirt in a mid-table clash. H2H doesn't play a factor.

u/NoobyDoobyDoooo lost, but were destined to be relegated anyway, as was u/DiamondPalkia, despite the sneaky win at the end.

https://preview.redd.it/f88hyutfsybe1.png?width=1904&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc9602d8f0be364e13bda3954e542de2c8f84565

**DIVISION 3**

*Scenarios:*

* ***DrainMember1312*** will definitely finish top.
* ***pa\_ra\_dox*** also has H2H wins over both ***FinnMundy7*** and ***IVIorgz***, so the second promotion place is also secured.
* ***FinnMundy7*** and ***IVIorgz*** will remain mid-table.
* ***Distinct\_Pick6261*** is guaranteed to be eliminated, due to previous H2H
* ***LiteratureCurious42*** is definitely eliminated.
   * Saving grace: ***LiteratureCurious42*** currently has a Division win, meaning they can still qualify for the Champions Cup. All that's needed is a good enough Overall Rank to ensure they stay in it.

De-ja-vu. Nothing was ever going to change in Division 3.

u/DrainMember1312 narrowly wins, and stays top anyway. 100% win record is a bonus.

u/pa\_ra\_dox wins as well, but was already guaranteed promotion.

u/IVIorgz beat u/FinnMundy7 in mid-table.

u/Distinct\_Pick6261 and u/LiteratureCurious42 both lost, not that it would have made any difference.

https://preview.redd.it/4edvkp9fsybe1.png?width=1908&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff22d94c79bcefde7fa19295ec74052aa7da91bb

**DIVISION 4**

*Scenarios:*

* ***newfountain22*** and ***FaustRPeggi*** are currently 1st and 2nd, but a loss for either puts them at risk of elimination.
* ***WEAluka*** will stand them in good stead for promotion, but it's also likely that it'll come down to a multi-way H2H battle.
* ***henkkaasd\_*** must also win if they want their hat in the ring for one of the promotion places.
* ***DoubleDeez21*** and ***rocknil*** will both be eliminated.

Now, here's where things got interesting...

u/WEAluka beat u/newfountain22, meaning promotion was certain, while

u/FaustRPeggi lost, which sent us into a 3-way H2H for the Division 4 title, Promotion, and Elimination.

The 3-way H2H was a tie, so it goes down to Overall Rank, and with u/newfountain22 the only one to finish outside the Top 1M, it's the end of the line.

At the bottom, u/DoubleDeez21 and u/rocknil were already eliminated. Joining them, is u/henkkaasd\_, who failed in their endeavour to give us a 4-way H2H for all of the above.

https://preview.redd.it/f1fdwcdesybe1.png?width=1906&format=png&auto=webp&s=58030899dac56f6b7295b8499ae253e28f55ed95

# [Tier 3](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fNW1MRZr7SMG84SAIdcY5tgbXJJ_hFdL8mUODUcjBUU/edit?gid=675715524#gid=675715524)

**DIVISION 1**

*Scenarios:*

* ***pauld95*** will be crowned Tier 3 Stage 3 Champion, regardless of any result, having already bested ***thepalegreenpants***.
* ***docvampirina*** is probably safe from relegation, with a better H2H record against two other hopefuls.
* ***Gilez\_89*** and ***Just7Callum*** play each other in a survival battle
* ***0ng0Gabl0g1an*** must beat the confirmed champion to have any hope of staying in Division 1.

u/pauld95 has already been confirmed to be Tier 3 Champion for Stage 3, but missed out on the chance to go unbeaten throughout. Solid effort, all the same.

u/thepalegreenpants won, finishing with a respectable 2nd place.

u/Gilez\_89 beat u/Just7Callum, and avoids relegation, while the loser finishes bottom.

u/docvampirina lost, and u/0ng0Gabl0g1an won, giving us a 3-way H2H, where one would lose out to relegation, and that was u/0ng0Gabl0g1an with an inferior Overall Rank.

https://preview.redd.it/zyywmy7csybe1.png?width=1894&format=png&auto=webp&s=994e1d760bc5df39a3ecff87aa5f975fee3f95c0

**DIVISION 2**

*Scenarios:*

* ***WaningCynicism*** is the favourite to take the Division 2 title, a draw will be enough.
* ***eglantinel*** can only finish top with a win, and hope that ***WaningCynicism*** loses, but promotion is still a likely outcome.
* ***macioman\_00*** and ***Gloomy-Strawberry808*** each need multiple results to go their way if they are to earn promotion, but relegation also looms if they lose.
* ***Mundanewisdom99*** will almost certainly mean survival, unless the other two matches end in a draw.
* ***ShadowGallConcierge*** needs several things to happen if they are to escape relegation zone, but none of it will matter unless they win in GW20.

u/WaningCynicism takes the Division 2 crown, despite losing to u/Mundanewisdom99, who avoids relegation.

u/Gloomy-Strawberry808 only lost out on the title thanks to a H2H loss in Match 1, but still earns Promotion.

u/eglantinel lingers on the verge of a shot at the big-time, but will have to wait for Stage 4 if they aim to get there.

u/ShadowGallConcierge won a battle at the bottom on the final day, but it wasn't enough, given results elsewhere, while u/macioman\_00 may feel a little hard-done-by, finishing bottom. A very tightly contested Division.

https://preview.redd.it/29zqxgfbsybe1.png?width=1894&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5c3451a5b499e4f1dcf1f43c1de223e9ce2e6f4

**DIVISION 3**

*Scenarios:*

* ***fusrohdab*** and ***\_LilDuck*** are the current leaders and favourites for promotion
* ***DasHotShot*** and ***the\_Vegetabull***, remain hopeful for mistakes above them.
* Last season's FPL Swiss Champion ***knoxvox*** is at risk of elimination.
* ***TheJet-BlackWings*** will definitely be eliminated after 4x losses so far.

u/fusrohdab  and u/\_LilDuck both win, and finish as they started, earning Promotion to Division 2.

u/the\_Vegetabull takes the biggest bounty, beating u/knoxvox to knock out the previous FPL Swiss Champion.

u/DasHotShot stays alive, despite losing.

u/TheJet-BlackWings finished on 5x losses, and so we bid farewell.

https://preview.redd.it/n6hjtvsasybe1.png?width=1892&format=png&auto=webp&s=a391a90f78d74a14c684aa776a8ac61b305739d3

**DIVISION 4**

*Scenarios:*

* ***bubreadsreddit*** and ***GamamJ44*** will both be eliminated, and await a second chance at glory in the Consolation Cup.
* ***dedosii*** and ***FPL\_06*** lead the charge at the top, but ***appealtoreason00*** is still hanging around in a fight for survival.
* ***This\_is\_so\_not\_right*** has an outside chance, but must produce a win and hope other results go their way.

u/dedosii won their final match, resulting in them topping the table and securing Promotion.

With u/FPL\_06 losing in the final week, and u/This\_is\_so\_not\_right winning, it left us with a 3-way H2H along with u/appealtoreason00. u/FPL\_06 managed to beat both, therefore progresses to Division 3 while the others are eliminated.

u/bubreadsreddit and u/GamamJ44 were both already confirmed to be eliminated, and finish bottom.

https://preview.redd.it/ncrba81asybe1.png?width=1892&format=png&auto=webp&s=84171ae0fdc5d7dc519fc49a6512b562dc7031d3

And that takes us to the halfway point of the FPL Swiss. Stage 4 is up next, and all tables and fixtures have now been set.

As usual, all links can be found below to each Stage and Tier, as well as previous posts.

If I have missed anything, or you've noticed something not quite right with the above, please do let me know as soon as I can as mistakes may not be able to be rectified in an ideal manner, if at all, once the GW starts.

Best of luck to everyone.

1hxfu1j,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_No_Individual_8663/comments/1hxfu1j/help_my_house_keeps_moving_when_i_sleep/,Help My House Keeps Moving When I Sleep,"Last week I noticed something strange, when I woke up from an abnormally long sleep my house wasn’t where it was supposed to be. I live in the suburbs of salt lake city Utah in a house that’s pretty old but for some reason when I woke up that day my house was in a field. 

A wheat field that seemed to stretch endlessly to the horizon. I couldn’t tell if I was dreaming or not so I just got in bed and closed my eyes. The next thing I knew my house was back where it was supposed to be.

Though that wasn’t the last time this happened. About two days later things started to feel off. Everything felt like a dream, as if nothing was real and it was all in my head. But no matter what I did I couldn’t get rid of the feeling.

Yesterday I noticed that all the plants outside were gone. I looked at doorbell camera footage suspecting they were stolen but from what I saw the plants were never there to begin with. I texted my wife who planted said plants but she claimed she has never brought a plant in or around the house since we moved in.

I called my dad asking him about the plants but he said the same thing. I think im starting to go crazy or something because I could have sworn there was two pots in front of the house with some orange and red flowers and a tree out front. In fact now it seemed that my house was the only one without a tree on the property.

Anyways I have decided to write things down and post them online or where ever I put this for now this Is just a note to myself written on a word document.

1/8/24

I got out of bed this morning and had a donut and coffee for breakfast. My wife leaves for her work earlier than me. It makes the mornings peaceful and quiet. But sometimes, especially times like this it makes me feel quite lonely. When I walked out the front door I looked across the street to see my neighbors didn’t have and trees or bushes. As I turned my head and looked down the street I realized no one had any bushes or trees. Everyone gardens were empty patches of dirt bricks laid in circles around nothing.

A feeling of uneasiness filled me but I decided to worry because it was probably just a dream. I debated whether or not I should still go to work or take the day off. As I stood on my front porch it hit me, if I was dreaming I could wake myself up or at least become lucid. I did everything I could but nothing seemed to work. I walked inside and went to lay down for a bit when I hit my hip on the counter “*FUCK”* I shouted out loud. 

The sharp agonizing pain or bumping into a marble corner was indescribable it hurt a million times worse than it should have. I looked at my hip and noticed I was bleeding. It wasn’t bad just a small cut but it still hurt enough for me to call it quits for the day. 

When I pulled out my phone to call in sick I couldn’t find my bosses contact. And I couldn’t remember his number, and for some strange reason I couldn’t remember his name or hers i completely forgot what they looked like what they sounded like. And then I couldn’t remember where I worked. 

I sat down trying to think but I started to question if I even had a job. Nothing felt real and I had no idea what was happening. 

I think I just need to get some sleep.

I woke up to loud bang. 

I jumped out of bed dazed and confused I was sweating and I couldn’t remember what I was doing asleep so late until I saw my laptop open beside me. I heard footsteps that crept closer to the door. “WHO ARE YOU” I shouted the bedroom door swung open and I saw my wife. “Your home? This early?” I asked “its seven, I’m late.” “oh shit its seven but that doesn’t make any sense. I feel like just two minutes ago I was going to go to work but then some weird stuff happened, and speaking of that I need to tell yo…” “work? You got a job?”

“what do you mean you got a job?”

“you said you were going to work why didn’t you tell me that you got a job?”

“What are you saying I’ve had this job for ten years I- I don’t know what else to say.”

“Are you okay?”

“well no there’s a bunch of weird stuff happening and I’m losing my mind about it”

“like the plants you wont shut up about”

“well yeah but the neighbors don’t have any plants didn’t you see?”

“honey you need to get some rest, I don’t know what has gotten into you.”

“what?”

My wife never called me honey before

“its just you need to sleep”

“I’ve been sleeping. ”

“well okay then. I need to run to the store and buy some dogfood.”

“What? For who?”

“for us silly.”

Her voice sounded strange. Monotone and lacking any emotion at all

“while I’m gone you should really go sleep”

“No, What do you mean for us?”

“for our dog its hungry”

“We don’t have a dog”

She looked at me with a blank stare and said

“I don’t know what your talking about he’s right outside.”

I turned around and looked out the back door and saw a small sheep dog running around on a yard full of dirt I couldn’t remember if there was grass in the backyard and then I started to remember having a dog.

I looked back at my wife and I couldn’t seem to fully recognize her. Her face felt off. I could recognize her voice even the strange way she was talking to me but her face I just couldn’t remember even when looking directly at her. I made myself dinner and went to my bed but my wife never came to join. I shouted her name a few times until I forgot what her name was. It was like I had been shouting gibberish I got out of bed and felt lost. 

I walked around the dark house that now felt like I different world and couldn’t find my wife but then it hit me a realization, a fear. I was alone. And I never had a wife. I keep reading this over and over and over again but I cant remember anything I didn’t type in the last five minuets. 

I’m losing my mind.

I have decided to just go to sleep and figure things out in the morning.

I woke up around 3 ish in the morning I was cold so I got up to turn on the heater but when I looked outside I saw a forest I ran to every window in the house to be met with the same sight. A pitch black forest, one of those it eats you alive forests. I couldn’t believe what my eyes were seeing I decided to go back to sleep and pray that this was just some weird dream but as I was getting in bed I saw a not on my nightstand it read “*don’t talk to them, don’t listen to them, don't look at them and never leave the house.”*

2) They work at my dream school, doing research/clinic work greatly aligned with my interests.

3) They too have a PhD, which I appreciate seeing how they bring that perspective into their legal work.

Thoughts on if a coffee chat request email would be appropriate?

It took me a long time to get over losing you. It took me an even longer time getting over the fact that you’d moved on to someone else when I was doing everything to try to get you back. It was like losing you twice. But that was your choice. And I needed to respect that. When you ghosted me instead of telling me the truth, and I had to find out about your boyfriend on my birthday, that awoke something horrible in me. I didn’t know how to communicate the negativity that was radiating through me. We had been talking every day since I returned from that mistake of a journey I went on, months of what felt like slowly rebuilding, for absolutely nothing - I felt blindsided. 

Over the next few months, the actual coping process finally started, even if it was extremely delayed. I drank way too much. My emotions became even less regulated. I stopped working on the album I told you I’d release in the summer because I lost the motivation to create. Content creation and music, two things which you used to love of mine, took a backseat to the summer-long bender that I went on, as I tried to make sense of exactly what I was feeling within this sea of rage, confusion, and sadness. 

This is why talking to an ex is such a bad idea. You never actually deal with the loss of them because they still continue popping in and out of your life, and you’re always thinking about the potential for what once was to return. 

I don’t wish for what once was anymore. I won’t keep chasing ghosts. We both deserve to be able to fully put this to bed. 

I have this dream. It repeats. It’s not a nightmare. I don’t have those about you anymore. I’m on my way to see family, stopping at the Starbucks by your place. It’s the holidays, I’m in my favorite bright-colored, cozy cardigan,  I walk up to the register to order but like in real life during the holidays at Starbucks, I struggle because I never remember the name of their holiday themed coffee (menu’s too damn big and dynamic it’s just dirty water miss me with that bs). As I’m trying to figure out what it’s called I hear a familiar voice to the left of me, giggling a little. “The peppermint mocha?” I turn to face them, it’s you. I say thank you, and mention that I always have trouble ordering this, for some reason I can never remember the name, and you say “I know.” I take my drink, smile one more time, and say, “take care of yourself,” leave, and never see you again. 

Sometimes you don’t get that poetic level of closure. Sometimes you have to find a way to finish and close that book yourself. I’m proud of you for being able to accomplish that. Now it’s my turn. I’m sober now. Writing this in January. It hasn’t been very long since I cut out the booze, but I feel better. I’m not hiding from my emotions the way I have been for most of 2024. I have someone. She wants me to tell you these things and let it go. 

So if by some chance the stars align and you see this unsent letter that might be sent eventually, I’m ready to let it go. I want us both to move on, and away from each other. And be happy with that. If you still think about me, I want you to stop. Not for me, for you. I shouldn’t be a part of your story, not anymore. Remember the day we met, and I kept saying how familiar you looked and I felt like we met before? I’ve tried to make sense of that for the last year. But maybe one day, we’ll run into each other, not remember the other aside from some odd familiarity, and be able to carry on with our individual lives, no baggage or demons following behind anymore.

My insurance is really good so I don't foresee any problems on that score. Taking my third shot of 2.5mg on Sunday night coming and have had minimal side effects (very mild nausea and one episode of constipation). I drink a lot of coffee which is probably why that hasn't been much of an issue. 

Seeing a nutrionist in a few weeks to get my macros dialed in, though, I've been prioritizing protein as that has been the standard refrain on this thread.

My friend (29 F), and I (29 F) had a long friendship since U. While we weren’t best friends, I’d say we were fairly close. 

After graduating, she moved to Belgium for a graduate program and decided to stay there. I've visited her twice since she moved. 

The first visit lasted four days, and we had a wonderful time together. It went so well that I had high hopes for a second visit. 

So the next year I booked a trip for the summer. I thought we were excited for this second visit. This was planned to be a longer trip, so I brought with me all the gifts I could take on my bag, and rand some little errands she had asked me to handle. 

Since we planned a round trip to different countries, I was going to left my belongings at her house during our travels. 

However, things felt different this time. Subtle behaviors made me really uncomfortable. For example: 

1. I was chubby at the time, and during one conversation, she straight-up looked me in the eye and said, ""I think I am fatphobic. I stay skinny because I know people wouldn't love me if I wasn't"" (keep in mind that one of her best friends is actually obese and a body positive activist). Of course I felt immediately ashamed. 

2. Another incident happened while we were rushing to catch a train. She spilled her coffee all over herself. I gave her a bunch of paper towels I had in my bag. After a while I noticed she still had some on her leg, so I gently placed a paper towel on her knee to hep. I barely touched her when she screamed ""Do not touch me!"". I was shocked and incredibly embarrassed. The guy in front of us was looking the scene intently. It felt like she was accusing me of something inappropriate, even SA (for context, she very much know for a fact that I'm straight). 

3. Another time, we were cooking together, and I offered to make a quick dish before our schedule started. She got angry and said the guide was going to left us behind. I reassure her, finished the plate, and said ""I told you so. Girl, have some faith"", trying to lighten the mood. She snapped, saying she didn't like that expression and got angry again.

The final straw happened while we were staying at her friend's house. We were talking about *Sex and the City* characters, and she mentioned she identified with Charlotte. I responded that I didn’t like Charlotte because she was a terrible friend to Samantha, often slut-shaming her while being hypocritical, given her own history of premarital sex. I also admitted that Charlotte reminded me of a close friend who had hurt me deeply in the past. After I said this, my friend’s expression went blank. Then, out of nowhere, she said, “I want you to leave. I need me-time.”

Picture this: we were in the kitchen as her friend was in the leaving room (where we were supposed to sleep) with her daughter, this was not my house, I was in a foreign country, I didn't know the area well enough, and it was pouring rain outside. 

I nervously stood my ground and told her: ""I cannot do that, it is raining"". She insisted. She then ordered me to go (without asking) to her friend's bedroom instead. I refused again, saying, ""This isn't my house, and I don't know your friend. If you want your me-time, ask your friend if YOU could use her bedroom"". She walked out of the kitchen, asked her friend if she could take her bedroom (she agreed), and I was left in the kitchen overthinking. 

After one hour I overheard a conversation between the two of them. She asked, ""Can someone book a room last minute here?"". Her friend immediately replied: ""No way. This is a very famous destination so all the places are already booked and if you find one, it will be astronomically expensive"". 

Hearing that made my soul leave my body. My head was a mess --what if she actually kicked me out? Her friend was going to be on her side. I didn't know if I was going to be able to afford a last minute reservation in this very particular expensive place, and on top of that all my stuff were at her place so I completely depended on her. 

Thankfully, nothing came of it, but I was scared for the rest of the trip. We still had 3–5 days ahead, and she barely spoke to me. I eventually had to ask her what was going on, and she replied that I was “too intense.” I cried, she apologized, but I felt it was very superficial. From that point on, I felt like I was walking on eggshells, as if everything I did—or even just being myself—bothered her.  

Once I was back in my country, I had no desire to contact her again.

I found out she was coming home for the holidays and received a text from her asking to meet up. I didn’t reply. AITA for refusing to see her now that she’s back in our home country? I feel ashamed of my decision because I still feel indebted to her for hosting me, and I do remember that, aside from the issues during the trip, she was a good hostess.",2,1736437701.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

You've just invested time and money into achieving a dazzling, white smile through professional teeth whitening, and then it happens - you accidentally reach for your morning coffee. Panic sets in as you wonder about the potential consequences of your caffeine craving. Will your newly brightened smile be ruined? Can one cup of coffee really make a difference? This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know about drinking coffee after teeth whitening, helping you protect your investment and maintain that brilliant smile.

Understanding Teeth Whitening and Coffee Sensitivity

Immediately after a teeth whitening treatment, your teeth become more porous and vulnerable to staining. The whitening process temporarily opens up the pores in your tooth enamel, making them exceptionally susceptible to color absorption from dark-colored beverages like coffee, tea, and red wine.

Click here to learn more: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com

Why Coffee is Particularly Problematic

Coffee contains intense pigments called tannins that can quickly penetrate the temporarily weakened tooth enamel. These dark compounds are notorious for causing rapid and noticeable staining, potentially undoing the results of your recent teeth whitening treatment.

Critical Timeframe to Avoid Coffee

Most dental professionals recommend avoiding coffee for **at least 48 hours** after teeth whitening. During this crucial period, your teeth are most vulnerable to staining and discoloration. Some experts even suggest extending this abstinence to 72 hours for optimal results.

Potential Consequences of Drinking Coffee Too Soon

1. Immediate staining and discoloration
2. Reduced effectiveness of whitening treatment
3. Increased tooth sensitivity
4. Potential uneven whitening results

Protective Strategies if You Must Have Coffee

If you absolutely cannot resist your coffee fix, consider these protective measures:

- Use a straw to minimize direct contact with teeth
- Rinse your mouth with water immediately after drinking
- Brush your teeth carefully after consuming coffee
- Opt for lighter-colored or iced coffee options

Alternative Beverage Options During Recovery

During the critical 48-72 hour period after teeth whitening, consider these safer alternatives:

1. Water
2. Clear herbal tea
3. White or light-colored beverages
4. Milk
5. Coconut water

Long-Term Coffee Consumption After Teeth Whitening

While initial abstinence is crucial, you can gradually reintroduce coffee. Consider these long-term strategies:

- Practice good oral hygiene
- Use whitening toothpaste
- Limit coffee consumption
- Rinse mouth after drinking

Professional Recommendations

**Dental experts consistently advise patients to:**
- Follow post-whitening care instructions carefully
- Avoid dark-colored beverages initially
- Maintain regular dental hygiene
- Schedule follow-up appointments

Potential Remedies if Staining Occurs

If you've accidentally consumed coffee and noticed staining:
- Contact your dental professional
- Use whitening touch-up treatments
- Consider professional cleaning
- Implement preventative measures for future protection

The Science Behind Teeth Staining

Tooth enamel contains microscopic pores that can trap pigment molecules. Teeth whitening temporarily enlarges these pores, making them more susceptible to staining. Understanding this process helps patients make informed decisions about post-whitening beverage consumption.

Maintaining Your Bright Smile

Protecting your newly whitened teeth requires a combination of professional care and personal commitment. By understanding the relationship between coffee and tooth discoloration, you can make informed choices that preserve your beautiful smile for months to come.

Conclusion

Drinking coffee after teeth whitening requires careful consideration and strategic planning. While the temptation to enjoy your favorite brew might be strong, patience during the initial recovery period can significantly impact your whitening results.

A great ration; bit passed its prime but so far all has been fine.

It was hit by customs, luckily they removed the chicken korma main dish only.

That freeze dried smooth oatmeal with raspberries was absolutely fantastic, one of the best things I've ever had from a ration I think.

BBQ peanuts were fresh, crunchy, and delicious. Both beverage bases were great. Cola bottles were a nice treat; milk chocolate not my favorite, sort of waxy for lack of a better word. Fruit biscuits and PB made a great breakfast along with a 3 in 1 coffee. 3 in 1 tea was great yesterday too.

I’m looking for someone who would like to practice ASL with me through the app Marco Polo or in person if in the palm beach county area.

I tried posting in Facebook groups but haven’t gotten much luck there. The Deaf coffee groups are also quite far from me.

I am a beginner so it will take me some time before I can hold elaborate conversations. I signed up for the courses from Oklahoma School of the Deaf so I’m hoping that will help too! Thank you to the people that shared this resource.

A few times a year, we rent air-bnb's and spend multiple days at a time (skiing, beaching, etc.) to catch up, and enjoy each other's company.

However, a person always brings Switch and Mario Cart which is a ""hit"" for most in the group. I so wish they wouldn't bring it! They almost always play in the main living space, and it's hard to peel off and do something else.

Not only do I find it to be so terribly over stimulating (the sounds, the visuals, etc.), but I also think it gets in the way of our deeply connecting with one another with conversation or laughter. It's such a bummer! They play for hours into the night, or for hours in the morning when we're having coffee or preparing breakfast, etc.

","After finding her boyfriend cheating and getting fired for throwing a hot cup of coffee in her manager’s face, Evelyn is broke, both emotionally and financially. 

Richard Viktor, a billionaire with a cold demeanor, has everything he needs except happiness, which depends on something he can only obtain through marriage. 

In exchange for money, Richard offers Evelyn to be his fake wife. 

Evelyn, hurt by betrayal, and Richard, haunted by a rough past, despise the idea of falling in love. They choose to keep their relationship strictly professional, with no emotions or strings attached. But as Evelyn steps into Richard’s cold, shimmering world, she finds herself battling with more than just her sharp tongue and dry humor. Under his tough exterior lies a man burdened by dark secrets and connections that could either pull them apart or draw them closer.

He is ice; she is fire. 

He prefers silence; she is a storm.

Those who cannot stand each other’s personalities must now pretend to be the happiest couple. 

But how further can they take this act before the lines begin to blur? What happens when the game no longer feels like one?

1hxfftk,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITManagers/comments/1hxfftk/predictability_of_resolution_dates/,Predictability of resolution dates,"I work for a company focusing on SaaS and using the SAFe methodology framework.

The biggest pain point from our customers isn't the amount of time it takes to fix bugs or deploy enhancements, which varies from a couple of weeks to a few months, it's the uncertainty. They want to eliminate uncertainty and are asking us to provide visibility and estimated fix dates.

Similarly to how UBER disrupted the market, suddenly you're not wondering when your taxi will arrive, standing in the cold, outside, miserable. No, now you can follow your driver, you know it'll be 5/10 mins (or 20/30 mins in extreme cases) and users don't mind, they know when the driver will be there and are happy to wait in a coffee shop or something.

The analogy applies to SaaS, customers are familiar with our methodologies, they know (roughly) how long things take to reach production and have their own shifting priorities. So... if we can somehow provide an estimated resolution date in advance, this would increase our NPS dramatically. Even if we don't stick to it, as long as the ""guess"" is an educated one (probably using data for historical bugs per severity ? ) and we proactively update them when we know the ETA will be breached, the vast majority of them won't mind as they can shift their focus to something else.....

Does anyone have any ideas or similar use cases on how to ""predict the unpredictable""?

1hxffs9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/1hxffs9/going_offline_for_good_wish_me_luck/,Going offline for good. Wish me luck.,"A lot of F bombs and rage. You've been warned.

Obviously I'll keep a contact app for my SO and others but it's purely on personal phone number so the people who reach out to me actually know me irl and need me opposed to some random news feed notification. This made me realize half of my family doesn't even have my number. Ha..

I haven't used Facebook in 10 years. I have no idea how Snapchat works. Instagram I only followed for my favourite artists. Twitter I never bothered to even understand, I hate the UI and it's formating. I found out about the existence of Twitch after it was already popular for years. Whatever else I didn't mention I probably never used it anyway. I'm 26 but living like I'm under a rock anyway. Nuking all of these apps won't damage me in any way. I'm already completely uninterested in them and barely use them.

Reddit however... This time sucker will be the end of me. My guilty pleasure is constantly viewing and discussing art on subs. It has gotten to a point where I talk about art and view art more than I make it. I can spend all day here helping people improve their art and how to get better etc. I racked up 2.5k karma on comments alone in one single art sub within 3 weeks. I'm not fucking proud of that whatsoever....

I'll spare you the dramatic 10 year long shitfest that was my teenage life and depression...

But the more I look at people around me the more I realize I should've never ended up like them. I had actual skill I could've mastered by now at my age. Instead I'm 26 creating art in the same quality I did when I was 15. Why? Because I never did it for 8 years straight. I'm chronically online and find it more fun to talk about it than actually doing it. I'd rather watch Youtube art tutorials for hours than sit my ass down and make whatever. Because 15 year old me became addicted to the online bullshit and my parents were too useless and uninterested to prevent it. And that went on and on all the way until now. Fuck them too for that, honestly.

I was under the illusion of productivity. As long as I watch and read art related content I'm actually being productive, right? Yeah. No. I'm still not doing shit.

My work was impressive when I was 15. Now it's average at best and there's kids more skilled than me. That really took a piss on my ego. I'm even bothered by my ego. I want to get rid of it. I don't need it. It only makes me feel miserable and that's just one of the plenty goals I wish to achieve but keep being distracted by the online nonsense. You can't be spiritual when you keep consuming dogshit online that's everything but spiritual. The act itself is opposite of spiritualism.

If it wasn't for all that I could've actually been a professional painter by now. Because to be one you can't stare at social media all day. It takes up your whole day talking to no one and being in solitude with no interruptions to have that as a career. Something 13 year old me hoped 26 year old me would be doing. Yet what am I doing? I'm chronically online talking shit on Reddit, helping everyone when I can't even help myself. I know my time on here wasn't for nothing. I actually helped people. But I damaged myself in the process. And I wish the damage was small. But it's 10 years of my life I'll never get back.

You can't buy time. I watched this video of an old man asking  ""how much is one hour of your life worth?"". Comparing it to the prices of products we buy on daily basis that we believe are as valuable as we pay them. But we can't even determine what 1 hour of our life is worth. We know the 7€ coffee might not be worth it. But we can't tell how worth is the time we spend waiting in long line to actually get it.

Why? Because we don't think about it. We give our precious time to all this and apps every single day. But we don't charge the owners of them for our time. Why is it NOT okay to do a 9-5 for bare minimum money but then in the evening we give Zuckerberg or Musk our time for completely FREE. Apparently that's fine. While they're sitting on their yachts laughing at us for falling for their scams. They're getting paid by our time just like the rest of the 9-5 bosses and CEOs.

But we don't think about that. We get nothing. Absolutely nothing. Yet we lose so much. And then they even bombard us with ads in the process. Turning us into brainless sheep that just consume and buy. Filling their pockets with our own stupidity. Might as well give them our brains while we're at it. Clearly we're all collectively not using them.

My generation isn't fucked because we are as useless as we think we are. We're fucked because we're chronically online whining yet doing nothing about it. We can't see our own potential even if it's right under our noses. Essentially making ourselves useless on our own. That's all there is to it. All bark, no bite. No protests no fights. Just online barking that nobody gives a f about. Including myself.

I was supposed to be a creator. A good one. I had it all and I threw it all away for nothing just like everyone else. For things that didn't enrich me in any way. I neither became good at anything because of it nor did I get smarter. It most certainly isn't paying my bills either. All I grew was hatred and regret for 10 years straight. Like a grumpy old cat that keeps hissing all day thinking she's tough shit. From one chair to another and then finally in bed. Rinse and repeat.

Fun fact, I'm not even an American or from UK. My English is a direct result of this tragedy. It's not my first language.

I had fucking enough and I'm done.

But I found comfort in realising it's never too late as long as I'm alive and able to wake up for the next day. So I'm leaving. It was ""fun"" while it lasted. But I feel like the longer I'm gone the more I'll realize what it means to truly have fun without all this bullshit that kept corrupting me all these years. I lost my sanity and humanity. There's no pill that's going to fix that. It's not my brain. It's my shitty life decisions that all piled up like a mountain. And the more I got used to my bad habits the more I normalized it all in my head. As if there's nothing I can do. Using depression as an excuse to do nothing at all yet expecting something to change. As if my depression is going to go away if everything stays the same. That's rich...

If every day you do the exact same shit thinking there will be a change... You're cooked. 

I'll finally get to read all the books I've bought or downloaded that I've been meaning to read since 5 years ago. But ""I had no time"". Except apparently I had time for this post and all those comments. I'll finally just  paint and get good at it without chronically talking about it instead. I'll decorate my house and room properly to my liking. It's been clean but more like a hospital. No wonder I feel gross staying in it.

There so much I wanted to do that I kept telling myself I don't have time for or energy for... What a moron.

Now that all this AI slop is coming and creating a whole fucking  infestation where you won't even know who's human and who's not... I couldn't have picked a better time to dip. I want nothing to do with that shit. I think that was the final nail in the coffin for this decision. I just pity the rest of the morons like myself who'd rather stay and figure out ways to detect AI instead of just stop being an NPC themselves.

I used to smoke for 10 years and I quit precisely a year ago. I can quit this too. I don't miss that shit therefore I won't miss this one either. All the same.

Thank you so much. Ask and you shall receive — I guess that's proving to be true. I was missing you, placed an intention, and there you were. Inviting. How blissful. Please, don't stop. Being around. Please?

I think might be getting addicted, or maybe it's already the case. You're *super* addictive, do you know that? You're such a treat to be around. Plus I have a bad habit for falling into addictions, and entertaining them. So, that's that. Sigh...

Anyhow, I just wanted to let you know that when our paths cross, you're always the highlight of my day — and on days they don't, I think about you more than I'd ever admit.

I hope you're having good mornings, with a nutritious breakfast and a nice cup of coffee to get you going. I hope you're taking time for lunch, and that you don't overwork yourself during the week. I hope you're driving safely, and that you carry an umbrella with you on rainy days. I hope you're going back home to a warm place, enjoying a nice bath, and getting comfortable in a pair of sweatpants. I hope you're having a good night of sleep, embraced by soft and fresh linen. I hope I show up in your dreams, sometimes.

I hope people around you make you feel happy, secure, fulfilled — loved. Every day. I hope they celebrate your victories and support you during hardships. I hope I get to cross your mind from time to time — and that it makes you smile when I do. I hope your heart feels light and content. 

And I truly hope that if my letters would happen to be sent — *they won't be* — you'd receive my words with open mind and open arms. That you would not feel uncomfortable, but cared for. That you would not feel scared, but protected. I hope you could see the true beauty that lies behind: that of a pure heart — albeit fighting battles with an edgy mind. My raw *unfiltered* thoughts are usually not to be shared — I hope you'd interpret them with the necessary care.

I am planning a wedding for this June. In order to lower my wedding’s ecological footprint, I had the idea of decorating with live, potted plants and flowers, rather than cut flowers.

Anyone done something like this? I’d especially love to see photo inspiration. My mom (who’s really running the show) is concerned it won’t look as nice as cut flowers. I’d love to give her examples of how it could still look beautiful!

1hxf5wk,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1hxf5wk/my_mom_is_completely_delusional_and_living_in_a/,My mom is completely delusional and living in a self-made reality,"Honestly, I don't know how to start this, so I'll give a little backstory first.

My mom (50F) has genuinely lost her mind the last 2 or so years. My parents separated about 2 1/2 years ago and ever since then she has slowly grown more and more mentally unwell.

My backstory is that I am 20 F, still living with my mom and currently in my last year of high school, I didn't achieve graduation at the standard age due to being sent to work when I was 13 for 4 years. I only started back at school at 17 and had to catch up on all that missed work in 3 months. I somehow managed to do it and now am in my final year. My father is out of the picture, he left and didn't continue contacting me because his girlfriend really dislikes me (I genuinely don't know why, I think it's because of the way I dress and my tattoos) so I don't have any family to rely on at all besides my mom. I would have gotten a job and moved out if I were finished with school, but I need to complete this year in order to be able to go to university like I am planning.

  
Anyways, my mom has gotten extremely paranoid over the years, especially the last 6 months.

My father and her are in the midst of a very gruesome divorce, my father has a restraining order again my mom due to verbal harassment, and she got fired from her job. She believes, everyone wants her dead and everyone is trying to kill her (we had a situation with an abusive tenant of our house who got her ex-husband to come beat my mom and I up for God knows what reason) since then she has been utterly convinced that my dad planned the entire thing and tried to get myself and her killed. She also believes people are spying on her (people working for my dad I guess?) and she thinks people are constantly stealing from her. She has accused even me of theft multiple times (which is just silly, I live here too so if I stole something I'd just be shooting myself in the foot) and tried to kick me out of the house multiple times. 

One night I arrived home drunk with my boyfriend (misjudged my alcohol tolerance) and I was crying because it's embarrassing to be that drunk. This somehow led her to slap my boyfriend through the face (to which he did nothing, he walked away) slap me too and push me off our patio into a tree where I fell into the grass and got an extreme allergic reaction (I'm highly allergic to grass).

She's berated me, called me the ugliest things I've ever heard in my life (and I had a horrible childhood of child labor and abuse) yet she still claims to love me and never wants me to leave the house. She is very against the idea of me working, even getting a part time job while I still study and basically still wants me to be a child, which is a massive contrast compared to my childhood, where I was forced to be an adult when I was incredibly young. 

She also does absolutely nothing in the house, like I mean genuinely nothing. I cook, clean when there isn't a domestic worker in (It's very common to have domestic workers in my country, very cheap to hire) I bring her water, make her cereal, do her washing, make her coffee, do all the shopping in the house etc. 

She outright refuses to do anything and preaches she would rather be dead than make a cup of coffee. I am being so serious.

Her temper has actually gotten out of control, and I've become really afraid of her as embarrassing as that sounds. She is a small woman, I know if she were to try attack me, I could defend myself, but I don't think I'd be able to ever lay a finger on my mom, no matter what she does to me.

She often has meltdowns where she will freak out over the tiniest thing, like not being able to find a pair of jeans, and suddenly it's everyone's fault and they need to help her.

I honestly think she needs to be booked into a mental health facility, because her paranoia and anger issues have gotten so bad to the point where I can't handle it anymore. She even slapped my 75-year-old grandmother on the arm when she got so frustrated.

The problem is, she doesn't see the way she's behaving as a problem. Sure, she will apologize when she sees the severe consequences of her actions, but I have never felt a true drop of actual shame or guilt or sympathy from her. It's really scary, actually.

  
We do not have the finances to get her into a mental rehab, nor her willingness so I'm genuinely at loss on what to do. My gran, my mom, my boyfriend and I live here. My boyfriend helps pay for things here and there, and my gran's other daughter helps pay for a lot of things too, my own aunt on my dad's side has helped loads too. All while she sits and does nothing but go crazy and shout and give orders.

I don't know what to do anymore, I am so concerned for my grandmother since she is not very physically able, and her heart is weak. Every time my mom throws a fit my gran has some form of a panic attack, and her heart beats like crazy. I don't think she can take much more of this.

I am assuming it's because I just stored the beans in the bags they came in. I bought an electric Fellow Atmos to remedy this for the future.

Now I'm left with a bunch of coffee that all has this bitter aftertaste. Is this normal, or am I doing something wrong? Maybe it's because I switched water filters, and not because the coffee has gone stale?

If it is the case that the coffee is just oxidizing and this is normal, is there anything I can do to reduce the bitterness? I have tried lower the temp to 90C, grinding much coarser, reducing brew time, even sifting fines. The bitter aftertaste is still there.

Anyway...

Lately I’ve noticed the Intelligent Dose isn’t being remembered, even after a fresh Setup.

I think I’ve seen that in the past going between coffee types and it’s definitely a thing now. I could set it to manual to overcome it but I change beans every two weeks going between 12 and 15 in grind size so intelligent dose is quite helpful, especially that it usually gives around 18g mark. Manual grinding can be set by time (in seconds) rather than by weight which sounds like a faff. Another workaround would be fully manual process using exact amount of beans for each brew but that's counterproductive given the purpose of the machine.

About to do a factory reset to see whether it helps, wondering whether it would reset the maintenance dates also (litres left on the water filter etc).

There is a few posts about similar issues with workarounds effectively rendering the machine as not fit for purpose (see above) which isn't ideal.

I’ve done ADF and a few 2 day fasts before, but just didn’t think I could go longer. However, I sprained my ankle a couple of weeks ago and it was very painful, I ended up going to physical therapy. My doctor told me I’d need at least 10 sessions, but since reading up on autophagy, I thought I’d give a three day fast a chance. 

My ankle has literally stopped hurting completely. I’ve only done 2 PT sessions, today I’ve got my third, but I think I’ll cut them short since I feel amazing and completely healed. 

Today I had some important meetings at work and was a bit afraid of breaking my fast in the morning before work in case I got bowel movement problems (you know what I mean) so I’ve just continued into day 4. 

Yesterday (day 3) was the most difficult day for me, and today I haven’t felt any hunger at all even though I woke up more that 10 hours ago! 

I’m having some cravings, but none are specific, more of a craving for the act of eating, it’s like my mouth is bored haha

I’ve had some trouble falling asleep yesterday, but once asleep I had a great rest. I have a lot of energy and am feeling amazing! I’d recommend this type of fast to everyone!

Oh and also, for the past cca. 2 months, I’ve been kind of halfway to a cold. Not serious enough to take time off work, but the irritating cough was constant and my nose was always stuffed. I got a bit addicted to nose drops (I know, I know, it’s bad but I literally couldn’t breathe without them). Well, since yesterday morning, I haven’t used them even once, and have been breathing with ease! Also, I’ve completely stopped coughing!

After several months of trying to get better results from my Siemens EQ500 superautomatic, I finally decided to take the plunge into the semi-automatic world. I primarily drink espresso and occasionally enjoy a cortado or cappuccino. While my superautomatic was convenient, the coffee often tasted too acidic, even with regular maintenance and adjustments.

Here’s my new setup:

* **Espresso Machine**: Sage Bambino Plus
* **Grinder**: Varia VS3 + Hypernova burr

I chose this combo because I wanted a compact machine with good steaming capabilities (for milk drinks when guests are over) and a nice grinder for precise adjustments.

I am still waiting for delivery of the coffee machine.

# My Questions:

1. **What improvements should I expect compared to my superautomatic?**
   * I’ve heard semi-automatic setups offer better extraction and crema, but I’d love to hear from those who’ve made a similar switch.  I'd also like some confirmation that I've made the right decision with this change.
2. **Any tips for dialing in with the Varia VS3 and Bambino Plus?**
   * I’ve read that finding the right grind size and dose can be tricky for espresso, so any starting points or general advice would be much appreciated.
3. **How do you handle making coffee for multiple guests?**
   * I’m a bit concerned about the time and effort it might take when serving several people. Any workflow tips or advice to streamline the process?

I’m still new to this world, but I’m excited to learn and improve my coffee game. Any feedback, advice, or encouragement would mean a lot!

**my questions** (and i'll give my thoughts after): 

1. how long do you typically message with someone before asking to meet up? 
2. how in-depth do you get with questions to the people you're chatting with? 
3. is it ""best practice"" to tell someone when and why you're unmatching, assuming you haven't met IRL yet? 

**my thoughts:**
1. i would prefer to meet up sooner just to get a vibe check. i'm also not interested in a penpal situation. so i was thinking that if the conversation seems to be flowing fairly well after a day or two, i would ask them for coffee. would you wait longer? 
2. i'm struggling here with not wanting to be too personal before meeting someone, but also wanting to get some more basic details about them before we meet up. for example, i've been speaking with this person over the course of a week and asked them out for coffee. they seemed enthusiastic about it but are currently ill so we haven't set a date. so far we've mainly been talking about hobbies and interests we share, but i'd like to know more about like, their current relationship configuration and what they're ultimately hoping for. is that better to save for first meeting? is it weird to ask that without a segue? 
3. this q is inspired by lacklustre messages with a person who i've spoken with for a few days but am not interested in pursuing further. she also just asked me something that i felt was way too much for someone she doesn't know. i felt like unmatching without a word would be rude? but i don't want to tell her i'm unmatching + why and have *that* be the unkind option. 

sorry for the length and thanks for any insights. i'm just trying to do my best out here but the learning curve is hitting me hard! ",2,1736435062.0,ActualLesbiansOver25,6,0.75,False

- I picked the game up during what is probably the nadir of the game in terms of both power curve and dollar value

Which is to say, most of my cards are from the Revised, Fallen Empires, and Ice Age sets, with a smattering of cards in either direction (Mirage, The Dark, a few cards each from Antiquities and Legends.) Having something like Banding is a respectable power for creatures in these sets, meanwhile I'm looking up the game now and seeing combos that go infinite, decks built to win on the first couple of turns, etc.

23 years old male from London. This was my first solo trip (parents were fuming… they thought when I said I wanted to solo travel i would gain experience in Europe…. They’re proud of me now though)



Starting in December, I landed in Dar Es Salaam. 
I used Airbnb, and made  host aware (home share) that this was my first time in another country alone.

This is what made me realise im about to have the best time ever. Picked me up from the hotel at 1am… the airline lost my luggage, he gave me his clothes to wear until I got my bags. Took me out for breakfast and paid for everything. 
I was quick to learn Tanzanians are good people. 


Exploring Dar solo, I met a local guy who shared the same name as me and was also just 3 years older. After some conversations he told me how he would love to spend more time with me but he has to go to his home village for Christmas break. 

This village was lushoto. I did a quick google while he was talking and learned that this would be a once in a life time experience since… if he took me. So I asked him, I said can I come with you.  He looked so confused as to why I would leave the sandy beaches of Dar to come to his village. In the end when we booked bus tickets, he was more excited for me than me. I met his family, his grand parents, played cards with his friends.. smoked some 🌱.. ate dinner cooked in a brick/mud hut (was delicious). 

After lushoto, I made my way to Arusha. 
Explored the city for 2 days… saw the Maasai cow/bull market which was cool. Held a snake for the first time and just appreciated the locals. 
I made a donation to a children’s orphanage so everyone had a meal for Christmas. Generally just a chilled time while  I waited for my safari.


Safari time. 5 days camping. My tour company was aware of my donations I made because one of the operators was the one who assisted me in contacting the orphanages head teacher. To my surprise, I was upgrading in my safari for this gesture which was absolutely heart warming. I was expecting to rough it out camping 5 days, but I camped for 2 days and spent 3 nights in lodges/ hotels. They also told me to save some money and cancel my hotel where I was leaving my luggage and the agent I was dealing with looked after it in his house. 

Like I said Tanzanian people are the best. 


5 days later, and yes I saw the big 5!! Plugs a cheetah which was awesome. I found myself in moshi. Just to take a picture of Kilimanjaro. 
Unfortunately it wasn’t visible, so I went on an adventure instead. Met a random guy on the street and 2 minutes later we was in a tuktuk together going god knows where. Ended up on another mountain where I was on my own and we was making coffee from scratch… was pretty cool. Met a Jamaican guy and smoked some more with him too. 

The same day I was pretty rushed, I had to get back to my hotel and then to the airport for 9pm.

I was going to Zanzibar! The best way to end what had been truly an incredible journey. 


Snorkelling, eating, drinking and dancing, sunset dinners.

My flight back to London was at 8pm, so what did I do to kill time? 

JUMP OUT OF A PLANE ✈️ 

skydiving over Zanzibar, what an insane view. Breathtaking. The best way for me to close out such a journey. 


If you are still reading this, go do the safari and then chill on the white beach of Zanzibar… you can’t not love it, there’s no way. Ignore all negative things you see about it.. people create issues out of nothing. 

I’m so happy I went, nerves almost got the better of me and I was very close to cancelling the trip. So so glad I didn’t.


I work hard 6 days a week and spend nothing when im at home. I never give myself credit, but im happy and truly believe I deserved such an amazing experience.


The only thing now… I want to quit my job and travel more of Africa and even the world. I have the funds too since im a no life in London. Work eat gym sleep. Im 24 in June. The idea of returning when im 25 mid twenties jobless… scares me. Since im quite career driven too. I don’t know if it’s a good decision to blow my house deposit on this, but god I want too.

NEXE Innovations: Pioneering Sustainable Solutions and Expanding Market Leadership in 2024

https://preview.redd.it/q07m3mngezbe1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfac05abebacb27235a781c4083782b1aa5d51cd

NEXE Innovations Inc. (TSXV: NEXE, Frankfurt: NX5, OTC: NEXNF), a leading player in the compostable materials space, has made remarkable strides in 2024, positioning itself for substantial growth in 2025. Through strategic partnerships, manufacturing advancements, and a commitment to innovation, NEXE is setting new benchmarks in sustainable solutions. Here's a detailed look at their journey over the past year.

# Expanding Market Reach and Strategic Partnerships

NEXE has strategically broadened its market presence through key collaborations:

**U.S. Market Entry with EKOCUPS**

Partnering with EKOCUPS, a major Amazon retailer, NEXE entered the largest single-serve coffee pod market in the U.S. This move strengthens their foothold in a high-demand sector, bolstering revenue and brand recognition.

**Bridgehead Coffee Collaboration**

Expanding its partnership with Bridgehead Coffee, NEXE secured a multi-year manufacturing agreement, delivering a range of new SKUs. This strategic alliance underscores NEXE’s growing influence in the Canadian coffee retail market.

**ecoBeans Relaunch Success**

NEXE also played a pivotal role in the relaunch of ecoBeans Coffee, providing compostable pods to retail and Office Coffee Services (OCS) markets. This partnership highlights the company’s ability to adapt and thrive in various distribution channels.

# Enhancing Manufacturing Capabilities

The consolidation of operations in Windsor, Ontario, following the sale of the Surrey facility for $5.7 million, marks a significant step in streamlining production. This vertically integrated approach enables rapid scaling, ensures quality, and reduces operational complexities.

NEXE’s investment in an in-house tool shop has been instrumental in minimizing machine downtime and fostering innovation. The ability to develop and test prototypes internally accelerates product development and enhances customization for diverse markets.

# Innovating for Sustainability

In 2024, NEXE secured five new patents in Canada and the U.S., solidifying its leadership in compostable solutions. Innovations include enhanced filter designs for better coffee extraction and multi-ingredient beverage pods, catering to evolving consumer preferences.

The NEXE Pod, a flagship product, continues to meet stringent compostability standards. Its compatibility with popular brewing systems offers an eco-friendly alternative to conventional plastic pods, aligning with global sustainability goals.

# Strengthening Financial Position

NEXE ends 2024 on a solid financial footing, with a cash position of $15.7 million and minimal debt. This strong balance sheet provides a secure foundation for continued investment in R&D, new product development, and revenue growth.

The company’s approval for trading on the OTCQB market has significantly enhanced its visibility among U.S. investors, opening up new avenues for capital and market expansion.

# Leadership and Strategic Vision

The addition of Tom Hoyne as a strategic advisor brings over 35 years of expertise in the coffee and food manufacturing industries. His insights are expected to drive further innovation and strategic growth.

As NEXE scales its operations, the company is committed to adding top-tier talent to its team, ensuring it remains at the forefront of compostable material solutions.

# Looking Ahead to 2025

With a strong pipeline of B2B opportunities, NEXE plans to expand its business-to-business coffee segment. By exiting its branded coffee business, the company aims to focus on building direct relationships with coffee companies and brands, ensuring a higher return on capital.

# Conclusion

2024 has been a transformative year for NEXE Innovations, with significant achievements across strategic partnerships, manufacturing, and innovation. As the company moves into 2025, its robust foundation positions it to lead the market in sustainable solutions.",1,1736434291.0,Junior_Stocks,0,1.0,False

To our lovely, lovely customers, please stop ordering oatmeal ""extra hot.""  I know it's apparently an option in the app, but it is nothing that I can control in my store nor any other surrounding ones I've worked in.  The hot water comes out of the spouts, brewers, or other dispensing method, at the temperature it comes out.  We have NO ability to change that.  

I completely understand you don't want cold food.  Valid 👏🏻.  However, requesting something we have no power to control just sets you up for disappointment.  

We can't even control the temperature for brewed coffee.  If you don't want it to be cold (again, VALID 👏🏻👏🏻) then either come in and order at the counter, come through a drive thru (the actual fastest way to get the stuff in your hands at most stores), or put in a mobile for in store pick up right before you leave for the store/right as you arrive and calmly wait for it to be called.  

The only things we make that we HAVE actual control of temperature, are espresso based beverages or something with steamed milk/lemonade/not water.  

We (generally) enjoy our jobs, want to put out quality products, and want you to be happy with your snacks and beverages.  So please, just meet us halfway. 🙏🏻

TLDR: the app is stupid for allowing you to request ""extra hot"" on non-espresso bar things.  It's not a thing.  Don't ask for extra hot oatmeal or brewed coffee/tea, please and thank you. ❤️",32,1736434156.0,starbucks,15,0.91,False

1hxebmz,https://www.reddit.com/r/motherinlawsfromhell/comments/1hxebmz/is_it_me_or_is_it_her/,Is it me? Or is it her?,"Hello, thank you for reading my post. My husband and I have known each other for 8 years. There are several stages of different problems with my MIL.

Stage 1: The first time when we met, she cried a bit in the end because of too much wine and said please don't hurt my son. I really didn't like it. It sounded very selfish. I knew her intention was genuine. But it definitely was not a good first impression.

The first stage lasted until we got married three years ago. She is a nice person in general. She is divorced and has a bf. She would ask me to go to family gathering on holidays to her bf's home (1 hour drive). I would go sometimes. Even though, I don't want to. But I still have interactions with her because I feel I owe it to my husband.

Stage 2: Last year, I had a miscarriage. I was really depressed for months. 2 months after the miscarriage, my MIL started to send messages for meet up on the weekdays just because she has time on weekdays. Even though I work from home, I don't want to leave work during the day just to have coffee with her. So i said I am busy during the day. And then she sent a group message including my husband for dinner. Honestly, I really don't want to go. So I ignored her messages at first. And then she said so 6 pm tomorrow then? That got me really pissed. I was already depressed, so I was not in a good mood. I replied can you just leave me alone and stop asking? She said something like you are just being rude.

This is the first time I spoke what I felt to her. I know I didn't choose the right words. I am tired of my boundaries being pushed. My husband just ignored all the things that are happening. Later on, I did explain to her over text that I am depressed. So, I over reacted at that time.

Stage3: After the text incident, I started to make efforts to foster the relationship. We met a few times, but it has got worse for me. Due to the following reasons:

1. She is always late. She is late for meetup. She is very slow. When we met for tea at her place, I told her I need to be home by 8pm. I know she was being nice for making a pie. But at 7pm, she is still busy with other things.
2. She talks too much. She is always the one the keeps talking and talking. I know she wants to share. But does it have to be every single detail of everything and it takes her forever to get to the point. I am tired of listening and listening. The more she talks, the more I don't want to talk. I know she also wants to get me to share my life. But when I am being pushed to a corner, I really don't want to share.
3. She says she cares about me. But when she asks to celebrate my birthday over a dinner party. She made food that my husband likes. I don't even eat mash potatoes at all. But again, i know she is being nice for buying flowers for me.
4. She asks too many questions and always being very vocal about how great her son is, how much she loves him. We were trying to buy a house. It was stressful already. And she keeps asking how much is it, where is it, do you have any photos. It is super annoying. I don't even have photos.

I know lots of the things are very trivial. And I know I have my own problems for sure. Me and her are just very different. She is trying. I did't set clear boundaries for this relationship. And I didn't speak clear about what I want. At this point, I don't what to try anymore. I don't want to reply to her holiday messages. I really just want to distance myself from her.

Should I keep trying? I just don't know.",2,1736433925.0,motherinlawsfromhell,1,1.0,False

Bone broth and stocks is a up cycled food item that you create from wasted bones and pieces of fats/trimmings, leftover scraps from vegetables…. I don’t think they should be charging this kind of price it’s making me weary of going to grab my favorite cup of broth. 
I guess the conclusion here is and I know people will say it just to make my own at home and save a ton but when your in a pinch and you have a busy schedule I should be able to grab a cup of broth with out spending 10+ dollars it’s just insane to me….

It's something I've been thinking about, but since most of the people I know are Adventists (including family and friends), I end up not having anyone to talk to about it.

If there's something I've always found curious and a little frustrating about the Adventist church, it's how many people there follow what Ellen White says without the slightest critical sense, even if it ends up damaging their health.

There's an example in my husband's family. His mother has been an ovo-lacto vegetarian for years, and recently she decided to become vegan. But besides being vegan, she doesn't eat ANYTHING that Ellen White said you shouldn't eat, like pepper, things with vinegar, sugar, coffee... And every now and then she goes through periods of being a raw foodist.

The funny thing is, she's one of the least healthy people I know. She's had cancer (and I don't think she recovered as well as she could have, her hair never grew back, for example), she has osteoporosis (any fall she takes causes her to break or crack a bone) and she looks much older than she really is, when compared to other people her age.

I'm not saying that being vegan is the problem, I know other vegans who are extremely healthy, but I think that eating only raw food is a bit extreme, I don't even know if it is possible to get all the nutrients a person needs by having a diet like this.

But there is no point in saying anything to her, if Ellen White said that this is how to eat, then that is how she will eat, and to hell with her health.",12,1736433662.0,exAdventist,10,1.0,False

When it comes to diamond quality, understanding the 4 Cs is crucial. Here are the key takeaways:

* Cut is king. It's the most important factor affecting a diamond's sparkle and brilliance. Never compromise on cut quality.
* Color and clarity grades don't always correlate directly with beauty. Many near-colorless diamonds (G-H) look white to the naked eye.
* You can get great value by choosing slightly lower color and clarity grades with an excellent cut. This strategy offers stunning beauty without the premium price.

* Always buy certified diamonds from reputable labs like GIA or AGS to ensure quality.
* Consider how the setting metal can enhance a diamond's perceived color and brilliance.
* **Recommended Vendors**: For a reliable buying experience, consider purchasing [from trusted retailers such as those](https://labdiamondsreview.com/diamonds/) that provide comprehensive grading reports and advanced visualization tools to assist in selecting the perfect stone.

# Who is this for?

* Buyers looking to maximize quality and value when purchasing a diamond
* Those wanting to understand diamond grading to make informed decisions

# Who is this not for?

* Shoppers only interested in flawless, colorless diamonds regardless of cost
* People uninterested in learning about diamond quality factors

# Recommendations for smart buying:

1. Prioritize excellent cut above all else
2. Consider G-H color and VS1-VS2 clarity for great value
3. Look for eye-clean diamonds rather than flawless grades
4. Get familiar with how different settings impact a diamond's appearance
5. Always purchase certified diamonds from reputable grading labs

# FAQ

1. What are the 4 Cs of diamond quality?Cut, Color, Clarity, and Carat weight. Cut is the most crucial for beauty.
2. How much do I need to spend for a quality diamond?It varies, but you can find beautiful 1 carat diamonds starting around $5,000-$7,000 with smart choices on the 4 Cs.
3. Is a higher clarity grade always better?

Not necessarily. Many VS1-VS2 diamonds appear flawless to the naked eye at much lower prices than flawless grades.

1. How does metal color affect a diamond?White metals like platinum can make a diamond appear brighter and whiter.
2. Are lab-grown diamonds of the same quality as natural?Lab diamonds have the same physical properties as natural diamonds and are graded on the same scale.

Remember, the key to finding a stunning diamond is balancing the 4 Cs to maximize beauty within your budget. Don't get too caught up in perfect grades - focus on overall appearance and sparkle.

Stage 1: The first time when we met, she cried a bit in the end because of too much wine and said please don't hurt my son. I really didn't like it. It sounded very selfish. I knew her intention was genuine. But it definitely was not a good first impression.

The first stage lasted until we got married three years ago. She is a nice person in general. She is divorced and has a bf. She would ask me to go to family gathering on holidays to her bf's home (1 hour drive). I would go sometimes. Even though, I don't want to. But I still have interactions with her because I feel I owe it to my husband. 

Stage 2: Last year, I had a miscarriage. I was really depressed for months. 2 months after the miscarriage, my MIL started to send messages for meet up on the weekdays just because she has time on weekdays. Even though I work from home, I don't want to leave work during the day just to have coffee with her. So i said I am busy during the day. And then she sent a group message including my husband for dinner. Honestly, I really don't want to go. So I ignored her messages at first. And then she said so 6 pm tomorrow then? That got me really pissed. I was already depressed, so I was not in a good mood. I replied can you just leave me alone and stop asking? She said something like you are just being rude.

This is the first time I spoke what I felt to her. I know I didn't choose the right words. I am tired of my boundaries being pushed. My husband just ignored all the things that are happening. Later on, I did explain to her over text that I am depressed. So, I over reacted at that time.

Stage3: After the text incident, I started to make efforts to foster the relationship. We met a few times, but it has got worse for me. Due to the following reasons:

1. She is always late. She is late for meetup. She is very slow. When we met for tea at her place, I told her I need to be home by 8pm. I know she was being nice for making a pie. But at 7pm, she is still busy with other things.
2. She talks too much. She is always the one the keeps talking and talking. I know she wants to share. But does it have to be every single detail of everything and it takes her forever to get to the point. I am tired of listening and listening. The more she talks, the more I don't want to talk. I know she also wants to get me to share my life. But when I am being pushed to a corner, I really don't want to share.
3. She says she cares about me. But when she asks to celebrate my birthday over a dinner party. She made food that my husband likes. I don't even eat mash potatoes at all. But again, i know she is being nice for buying flowers for me.
4. She asks too many questions and always being very vocal about how great her son is, how much she loves him. We were trying to buy a house. It was stressful already. And she keeps asking how much is it, where is it, do you have any photos. It is super annoying. I don't even have photos.

I know lots of the things are very trivial. And I know I have my own problems for sure. Me and her are just very different. She is trying. I did't set clear boundaries for this relationship. And I didn't speak clear about what I want. At this point, I don't what to try anymore. I don't want to reply to her holiday messages. I really just want to distance myself from her.

Should I keep trying? I just don't know.",3,1736433191.0,inlaws,3,0.81,False

I have built a tool called that automates lead generation directly from Google Maps—no Chrome extensions, no coding, just easy-to-use functionality for anyone in sales.

Here’s how it works:  
You type in your search criteria (e.g., “Coffee shops in New York” or “Plumbers in London”), and our platform extracts all the relevant business data for you (we scrape data from Google Maps and enrich them with our scripts, so you can get better output).

What you’ll get:  
✅ Business name  
✅ Email addresses (if exists)  
✅ Phone numbers (if exists)  
✅ Website URLs (if exists)  
✅ Reviews and ratings (if you need)

... or any data already available at Google maps.

My tool is designed for sales professionals who want more leads without wasting hours on manual research. It’s especially great for non-technical users who just want results, fast.

I'm looking for some people to test it for free and provide feedback! This will help me validate the quality of leads product able to generate.

Back and forth we looked and smiled at each other, but nothing serious. We didn't even talk although we had plenty of chances. We didn't take them because we are stupid, socially awkward. Next problem is, we are both not very emotional – I'm autistic and he shows some symptoms as well. I don't have problems interpreting signals (at least I'm not better than most neurotypicals) but sending them is an issue for me. So I have seemed distant at occasions where I didn't want it.
Anyway. The signals never really stopped (but for one embarrassing situation I put myself in) and he even came up to me the last time we saw each other with a big grin to talk to me. He got interrupted but I think about this often.

I really think I've trapped myself in limerence. I can't think of anything different than him and a possible future with this guy for MONTHS now. We have almost 0 connection and didn't even talk! It's frustrating, it hurts, especially because of the load of uncertainty around it.
I thought about just letting everything pass, since we won't see each other that much in the future, but that's obviously easier said than done.
Since we have professional relationship with each other (don't worry, no power-dynamics or anything) I just asked him professionally for a meeting via E-Mail. Just to strike up a conversation, maybe destruct my uber-elevated picture of him, maybe to develop something out of it if he still likes me or can see us having a coffee some time. If not, it was just a professional meeting after all (although I'm not quite sure what I could ask him to not make it weird).
A rejection would hurt but this state our ""relationship"" is in is AWFUL. We'll see if it will work out this way.",2,1736433099.0,limerence,0,1.0,False

2. Amped up supplements, including collagen in my coffee
3. Strength training with trainer 3x/week - 30 minute sessions
4. Walking 3+ miles at least 4-5x/week (more when the weather is better)
5. Tracking using LoseIt - calorie deficit 1100-1400/day
6. Eating mostly whole foods vs processed foods.
7. Cutting alcohol (I imbibe occasionally)
8. Journaling almost every day

1hxdxyd,https://i.redd.it/om2infnaazbe1.jpeg,How can you set goals that are both ambitious and achievable?,"How to Set Goals That Are Both Ambitious and Achievable in 2025

Setting goals is like writing the script for your personal success story. Ambitious goals inspire growth, while achievable ones ensure you don’t get stuck in the aspiration quicksand. The challenge lies in balancing the two. Here’s how you can set goals that stretch your potential without setting yourself up for disappointment.

1. Start with Your ‘Why’
Every meaningful goal starts with a purpose. Understanding why you want to achieve something gives your goals depth and motivation.

Ask yourself:
Why is this goal important to me?
How will achieving it improve my life or impact others?

For example, instead of saying, “I want to earn more money,” focus on the reason: “I want to provide financial security for my family.”

2. Use the SMARTER Framework
You’ve probably heard of SMART goals, but let’s level up with SMARTER goals:

Specific: Define exactly what you want.
Measurable: Quantify your success metrics.
Achievable: Ensure it’s realistic given your resources.
Relevant: Align the goal with your broader life plans.
Time-bound: Set a deadline to create urgency.
Evaluated: Regularly check progress.
Rewarded: Celebrate milestones to stay motivated.

For instance, “Run a marathon in six months” becomes: “Train to run a marathon by July 15, completing four weekly runs and increasing mileage by 10% each week.”

3. Break It Down Into Bite-Sized Milestones
Big goals can feel overwhelming. Break them into smaller, manageable steps. Each milestone should feel like a mini-accomplishment on your journey.

Example: If your goal is to write a 60,000-word novel:
Set weekly targets of 1,200 words.
Outline the story structure in the first two weeks.
Dedicate specific days for editing once writing is complete.

Pro Tip: Celebrate every milestone with something small—a coffee treat, a movie night, or a guilt-free Netflix binge.

4. Embrace the Power of Visualization
Visualization isn't just for daydreamers. Science backs it up: seeing yourself succeed builds neural pathways in your brain, enhancing motivation and performance.

Create a vision board with images, quotes, or symbols that represent your goals.
Spend 5 minutes daily visualizing the process and the result.

5. Stay Flexible and Embrace Failure
Ambition requires resilience. Life may throw curveballs, but flexibility ensures you adjust instead of abandoning your goals altogether.

Reframe setbacks: Treat them as lessons, not failures.
Example: If your fitness goal is derailed by an injury, shift focus to nutrition or mindfulness while recovering.

6. Find Accountability Partners
Share your goals with a trusted friend, mentor, or join a community with similar aspirations. Accountability boosts commitment by 65% and increases success rates by 95% if paired with regular progress updates.

7. Measure Progress, Not Perfection
Keep a journal, use an app, or track progress on a spreadsheet. Celebrate progress even if it’s imperfect. After all, “done is better than perfect.”

8. Anchor Ambition in Gratitude
While aiming high, stay grateful for what you’ve achieved so far. Gratitude keeps you grounded and optimistic.

Creating a Disney home kitchen is a fantastic way to bring a touch of magic to your everyday cooking experience. With an array of themed items, you can easily transform your kitchen into a whimsical space that resonates with the beloved characters and stories from Disney films. From cookware to dining sets, the options are endless, ensuring your culinary adventures feel extraordinary.

When designing your Disney home kitchen, consider incorporating vibrant colors and iconic designs inspired by classic Disney characters. Collectible plates featuring Mickey and friends, alongside cookware adorned with Disney princesses, add a playful yet elegant look. Look for:

- **Disney-themed cookware:** Pots, pans, and baking dishes that showcase beloved Disney motifs.
- **Character mugs and glassware:** Perfect for adding charm to your morning coffee or tea time.
- **Table linens and decorations:** Tablecloths, napkins, and centerpieces featuring Disney designs.

Another fun aspect of a Disney home kitchen is incorporating nostalgic elements. Vintage Disney memorabilia can be displayed, such as posters or framed artwork, creating a magical ambiance. Enhance your kitchen experience with themed events, like a Disney movie night with homemade snacks served on adorable Disney-themed platters.

For families, engaging children in cooking can be more exciting with Disney-themed recipes. Create dishes inspired by Disney movies—think ""Frozen"" snowflake cookies or ""Toy Story"" alien cupcakes. This approach not only sparks creativity but also allows for bonding time in a fantastically themed environment.

Incorporating a Disney home kitchen is a delightful way to merge functionality with enchantment. With the right mix of décor and creativity, your kitchen can become a haven of joy and inspiration, reflecting the magic of Disney in everyday life.

Picture this: *it’s dusk, and we’re wandering a quiet city street we’ve never seen before. The kind of place where cobblestones echo with stories and soft light spills from shuttered windows. There’s no set destination—just us, sharing thoughts, laughter, and half-serious dreams of what we’d do if this moment lasted forever. We stop at a little café, where the coffee is warm and the conversation is even warmer. The world feels infinite, but for now, it’s just the two of us—and that’s more than enough.*

I’m here searching for someone who dreams of moments like these. Could that be you?

# About Me

I’m a quiet soul with a curious mind—a writer, future vinyl collector, and lover of golden hours. My passions range from creating playlists that feel like soundtracks to discovering hidden hiking trails and catching fleeting beauty with my camera.

I thrive on deep conversations, small joys, and moments that linger in your memory long after they’ve passed. While I enjoy solo pursuits like gaming or reading, my greatest happiness comes from shared experiences and meaningful connections.

I’m looking to start with friendship—something genuine and unforced, like the first chapter of a great story. Maybe it evolves into something more, but for now, I’d love to connect and see where the pages lead us.

# What I’m Looking For

I’m searching for someone who is kind, thoughtful, and curious—a woman who dreams big, appreciates life’s quirks, and values honesty. You don’t need to have it all figured out (who does?), but you should have a desire to share your world while exploring a new one together.

Whether it’s collaborating on a project, swapping music recommendations, or planning spontaneous adventures, I’m looking for a partner who is ready to dream, build, and laugh along the way.

# What Sets Me Apart

I notice the little things—the way your eyes light up when you talk about something you love or how the world feels quieter under a blanket of stars. Loyalty is my foundation. I show up for the big moments and the small ones, believing that consistency and care are the cornerstones of a great connection.

I’m also a romantic in the best way: someone who leaves sweet notes, remembers your favorite things, and turns ordinary days into something a little magical.

If this resonates, let’s swap stories, playlists, or dreams. Whether it’s the start of a friendship or something more, let’s see where our chapter together takes us.",2,1736432729.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

My current addiction is to caffeine, which is an improvement because my last one was smoking and that has permanently altered how I breathe. My caffeine addiction is controlling me. If I don't have caffeine I go into full on withdrawals, so sometimes I just have to eat coffee granuals with a spoon to stop the insane headaches, vomiting, and heart palpations.

1hxdu8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/StLouis/comments/1hxdu8o/10_downtown_restaurants_for_any_occasion/,10 Downtown Restaurants for any occasion ,"Downtown has 96 restaurants currently, with that number expected to grow to 103–105 by next summer. This includes the Oliver Properties Food Hall on Washington Avenue and multiple new spots in the Jefferson Arms building. Many offices are also increasing their in-person work schedules, US Bank, for example, will require employees to come in three days a week starting in February, as will its Impact Finance division, AT&T, and a few others.

If you're heading back downtown or just looking for some good spots to check out, here are 10 places I frequent. These aren't necessarily a ""top 10,"" but they're worth a visit for various reasons:

1. **Sen Thai** My go-to Thai spot since their days in the Shell Building. Now located on Washington Avenue. (Aubergine Café on 7th Street is also a great Thai option)
2. **Amaizing Arepa Bar** A fantastic Venezuelan restaurant on 14th and St. Charles. You might even spot a Cardinals player grabbing a bite there.
3. **Ukraft** Recently expanded into a larger space in the Peabody Building, facing Market and Kiener Plaza. They offer a diverse menu of great breakfast and lunch options and are also open for happy hour on Wednesdays.
4. **Katie's Pizza** Their roasted chicken pizza has been my recent favorite, and the appetizers are always excellent.
5. **Blondie's** A popular spot for meetings. The food is ok, but it’s great for coffee and a meeting.
6. **San Café**  run by some of the nicest folks you'll meet. It’s a mini grocery store with a deli sandwich counter, pizza by the slice, a coffee bar, and even a spot to grab drinks. a Swiss Army knife of a place.
7. **Sushi AI** The best bet for sushi if you're in the downtown area.
8. **The Train Shed** I usually go for the country-fried steak. Be aware, though, that from November through the holidays, it often has long waits due to Polar Express traffic.
9. **Idol Wolf** Located inside the 21c Museum Hotel, great for happy hour drinks at the bar. 
10. **Fielder's Choice** My go-to breakfast spot for bagels. The bagels are  from Iss-a-Bagel in NYC. If you like a bit of heat, i recommend the ""Heat Bagel.""

i was smoking a pack and a half a day and probably almost an OZ of weed a week. Rolling my own did help cut down on my usage and i tried vaping but those just gave me headaches.

my lungs feel better and my body doesn't get random chest pains. i feel as connected with my body as i can be imo. My moods are more stable. Sometimes i do miss the states that can be unlocked with a nice buzz from a cig or wine. but the side effects that come with those arent worth imo.

with drugs my daily life would go from  me feeling like a 8 to a 3. now i'm steadily around 6-7.

  
i can confidently say if i ever start back up again. im staying the hell away from weed. At least my experience with it. its such a inconsistent drug to enjoy. especially living in non-legal states. Hopefully in decades to come people realize weed is a hinderance.

i think a nice ciggie and drink every once in a while is fine(but dont bother if u can't do it in moderation)

1hxdoha,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hxdoha/do_i_need_to_tell_my_friend_that_we_arent_dating/,Do I need to tell my friend that we aren’t dating?,"This is my first reddit post so take it easy on me if I’m not using the proper etiquette on here. Also a long post, but wanna make sure i give all the background. 

About 2 years ago I (27M) matched with a girl on bumble, let’s call her Ruby (27F). We decided to grab coffee at a local spot, which is always my preferred first date to feel out the vibes. She was reserved at first but opened up more as the date went on. We had good conversation and she was really nice so we parted ways with setting up a second date. No kiss or any physical contact for that matter. Our second date was at Top Golf and went pretty similar to the first; we connected and had good conversation. And while there weren’t crazy sparks, I figured it could be worth seeing where things go. 

Fast forward another two dates and it became more clear to me that even though Ruby was super nice, the romantic connection just wasnt there for me. Mind you, I still hadn’t tried to make a move and since we were 4 dates in, I figured she was wondering where we stood. So i decided to give her a call to talk about us. 

Forgive me as this is where my memory gets slightly fuzzy with exactly what words were used. In an effort to let her down easy (probably a mistake), I essentially said at this moment I’m not really ready for anything and that I’m really focusing on bettering myself right now. This wasn’t a lie at all, but maybe not the best way of approaching it. She took it surprisingly really well (almost as if she didn’t realize this was me kinda breaking it off). And we somehow ended the conversation with “still down to hangout if you want”.

So over the course of the next year, we kept in contact on a somewhatish regular basis and hungout maybe once a month on average. Hanging out always consisted of just the two of us, which isn’t really unusual for me. I have a few friendships that are like that, including 100% platonic female friends. But none of those other friendships started from a dating app or the intention of pursuing each other romantically. 

Let me be clear, even though we hung out several times one on one and even in date-y like settings (watching a movie, farmers market, dinner, mini golf, etc), we have never slept together, kissed, nor had any romantic physical contact. We probably hugged goodbye a few times. So it was clear to me that we are just friends. But in the back of my head, there’s still that lingering thought that she thinks we are more. She’s pretty religious so it’s possible the lack of physical intimacy is common in what she expects from a relationship. So I’ve been trying to distance myself a bit, limiting texting to every couple weeks or so. I was kinda hoping to just let things drift apart naturally. 

Fast forward to the last 9ish months. Ive made a dramatic lifestyle change and am now living in different states rather than my home state for about 70% of the year. So naturally, the hanging out has slowed down since I’m not around as much. Same with my other friendships too. 

I recently met a girl, let’s call her Julie (25F), and things are starting to progress towards what looks like will be an actual relationship with me and Julie. I just got back to my hometown last week and Ruby wanted to hangout, specifically wanting to see a movie and grab dinner. She also said she got me a Christmas gift and wants to give it to me. I’m a little uncomfortable because I was hoping my friendship with Ruby would’ve faded by now, and I don’t really want to hangout with her given that we’ve technically dated in the past and I’m all-in on progressing my relationship with Julie. But Ruby just got laid off from her job and had a close family member pass away, so I don’t want to pile on by ending a friendship just because I might be delusionally thinking that she perceives it as a relationship.

So here’s where my dilemma stands. I am planning on hanging out with Ruby in a couple days. Do you think it clear is in Ruby’s mind that we are just friends and nothing more? Do I need to have a direct conversation with her and risk making things super awkward because it was ‘obvious’ that we are just friends for the past 2 years? Should I casually mention in conversation that I met Julie and am developing a relationship with her, to give her the hint? Should I just continue to try and be distant in hopes that the friendship fades and not pile on while she’s feeling down about her other life events?",1,1736432053.0,dating_advice,8,0.67,False

Never had any dental issues, now in my early 40s I have had my first few cavities, and dentist mentioned some exposed dentin in a back tooth, which was the cause of sensitivity.","I get cleanings every 3-4 months because I generally develop more plaque than average (genetics...) Everyone in my family is religious about taking care of their teeth. I brush with an electric toothbrush and floss at least once a day, often twice. Always at night before bed, and often at work in the bathroom after lunch. Anyway, my teeth have always been pretty resilient and I was shocked when I finally got my first cavity a few years ago. I still get my cleanings every 3-4 months, and yesterday after my xrays, the dentist showed me I have one cavity that will need a filling and 2-3 others that she wants to ""keep her eye on."" When she was doing the scaling, at one point I winced in a bit of pain, and she said, ""Looks like this tooth is sensitive with some exposed denting and a bit of gum recession on that tooth.""

Look, I know this is probably pretty minor compared to others, but I am hyper vigilant about cleaning my teeth. I also eat a pretty clean diet since I work out (still making gains in my 40s!). I don't smoke or drink, but am wondering if my daily black coffee or a caffeine free Coke zero I have 2-3 times a week might be contributing. That said, when I was younger I drank actual soda, drank booze, and ate way more sugary and acidic foods. It feels like this is ""the beginning of the end"" for my mouth. Is this just to be expected with age, or is there anything I can do? I hate going to the dentist, and even though I go 3-4 times a year, it is anxiety inducing, which is another reason I am so paranoid about taking care of my teeth. I love it when the cleanings are quick and effortless.",1,1736432030.0,askdentists,4,1.0,False
