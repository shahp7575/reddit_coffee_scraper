1ijvqrd,https://www.reddit.com/r/MagicArena/comments/1ijvqrd/two_whys_and_a_howhelp/,Two why's and a how/help?,"Been playing since Bloomburrow so not new but certainly not super experienced. Have got to mythic every season with random, home brew janky decks full of one off's and a lot of ""make do's"" due lack of wildcards and what not. Few things in the past few months I've been playing that I want to just ask.

Why do so many people play whatever the flavour of week is? Mtga is no more than a numbers and sprinkle of luck game, there's no need to soullessly play bats, or mono red or mono black demons (insert whatever you see a painfully high percentage of) when you can climb the ranks regardless of what you play? I appreciate the longer you play the more MMR takes a hold but like, what's your goal? If people truly find playing the same decks everyone is playing fun then the discussion ends there, it's all just a bit of fun at the end of the day and I'm all for it. If it's to sweat to try and climb, again, why? The only positive I've found from mythic is the sweats are now diluted by the people that have ""made it"" and are happier to play sillier and more experimental decks. There are SO many cards I'd love to build decks around that I've never seen once in my time playing but money doesn't grow on trees so we just play with what we have.

 Kicked the arse out of that one so we'll move on.

1 in every 4 or 5 games I play (that I'm winning at least) my opponent will go AWOL until they time out. I don't really mind, I put my phone down and get on with whatever else I was doing, but I cannot fathom why tf anybody would also want to waste their own time sitting on the other side of the screen all bitter and twisted (and I'll reiterate, I only play completely unique shit that I've thrown together, I enjoy a golgari Vorinclex-y sorta deck that tries to make use of some cool battles that rarely actually work, probably loses more than it wins) so it's not like I'm playing discard and making people miserable. So yeah, I know some of you must also lurk on reddit - why do you do that? If the game looks completely unwinnable either let the other person play out their win or concede and jump in to the next. 

On to the how/help. I've only played standard and dabbled in draft when I get a free token or something, I am really keen to delve into the other game modes (the commander one and the one with like everything in? I think that's Brawl and Historic???) Any tips to ease that transition. I feel like wandering into a game mode where ever mental card ever lives with a deck barely good enough for standard will be a hilarious but overwhelming wake up call, any way of narrowing that gap at all?

Ironically I began writing this because somebody walked off from their phone/PC 3 mins into a game so I scope for a coffee and a ramble. Any tips or directions to a particularly useful source would be greatly appreciated.",1,1738937175.0,MagicArena,0,1.0,False

1ijvq57,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1ijvq57/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

#Truth Bullets

[Nanami File](#bullet) The victim is Byakuya Togami. Probably. Byakuya should have died at, maybe…10:35PM…ish? I think?

[DICE Directive #1 - The Friend Ship](#bullet) What ship never sinks? That’s right! The Friend Ship! Unfortunately, Hope’s Peak isn’t friendship, it’s a building, and it’s filling up with water with every passing moment. In an undetermined amount of time the entire school will be submerged. Unless…

[Adaptation is Key](#bullet) As the first floor was submerged, the astute staff working hard at DICE realized certain necessary faculties were no longer accessible. The fifth floor biology lab was converted into a room with a kitchen area and a dining area. Showers and additional sinks have been added to each communal bathroom on their respective floors. The Physics Lab on the fourth floor was turned into a theater room. Lastly, all classrooms are equipped with a basic lock that can only be locked from the inside.

[Byakuya's Adapted Library](#bullet) The library showed clear signs of Byakuya modifying to his personal preferences, with furniture shifted and personal items scattered. Some include the many books stacked on the table, a corner to write with a notebook and pens, another to sit and listen to vinyl records, and another for snacking and drinking. One particular modification is that there was originally a small glass vase on the front counter, but now only shattered pieces remain.  
 
[The Archives](#bullet) Byakuya repurposed the Archives, a room inside the Library, to become his sleeping quarters. The walls are lined up with shelves almost fully packed with volumes to long encyclopedias, each row being a different edition. Seemingly, the last book on one of the rows is missing. There is a sleeping bag on the floor and a small coffee table. The door to the Archives can be locked from the inside and showed no signs of tampering. 

[Uneven Coffee Table](#bullet) The coffee table inside the Archives had one of the four legs broken, needing about three inches to balance. Byakuya placed the twenty-first volume of The DICE-Revised Universal Compendium of All Knowledge™️ under the leg to fix this problem.

[Slumber Party Massacre](#bullet) Rooms are less plentiful as the school fills with water ~ so people had to get creative with sleeping arrangements. The following people have confirmed their location of rest (courtesy sleeping bags and pillows provided by DICE): 

Byakuya - Archives

Ibuki + Himiko - Classroom 2A

Mondo + Chihiro - Classroom 2B

Komaru + Mikan - Classroom 3A

Yasuhiro + Gundham - Classroom 3B

Mukuro - Classroom 4A

Kaede + Maki + Kaito - Classroom 4B

Kirumi + Angie - Classroom 5A

Korekiyo - Classroom 5B

Fuyuhiko - Classroom 5C

[Idle Hands are the Devil’s Workshop](#bullet) At 8:00 AM this morning DICE sent a personalized message to every student. It indicated that their orientation period has finished and they are now to begin the training program in earnest. Each student was given a list of tasks unique to them that must be completed before midnight unless they were tired of that whole “living” thing.

[Isolation](#bullet) Upon finding out they were being ~~forced~~ invited into a DICE Killing Game, most of the class used this as a chance to unify. Byakuya was not one of those people. Shortly after the situation was apparent to all, Byakuya claimed the library for himself and would only occasionally leave for minimum periods of time for necessities such as going to the bathroom. 

[Body Discovery](#bullet) Shortly after 11 PM a loud noise sounding like glass shattering was heard coming from the library. Ibuki, Himiko, Chihiro, and Mondo followed the noise and found the library unlocked. They found Byakuya’s corpse after walking into the library and noticing the scent of blood from the Archives room. Upon seeing the corpse the body discovery announcement rang out (11:20 PM) and the remaining class members arrived shortly after. 

[Crime Scene](#bullet) Byakuya was found in the library archive lying face down head towards the door. Blood can be found on his neck where the stab wound was made and a trail can be observed from his sleeping bag to the door. Blood is on his hands and the door knob. 

[Knives Out](#bullet) A knife was found at the scene of the crime next to Byakuya’s body. The knife has stains of blood on the blade.

[Missing Glue](#bullet) Angie noticed that Fast Acting Glue went missing from the art room at 3:30pm. 

[All the World’s a Stage](#bullet) Chiaki and Kokichi confirm that Byakuya's task was to do public dramatic readings. From 3:30-5:00 PM  Byakuya performed different renditions of Shakespeare to the absolute delight of Kokichi. Chiaki and Komaru were there as well.

[Maintenance Issues](#bullet) Korekiyo investigated the Chemistry Lab and something seems to be clogging the drain of the sink.

[Stuck Books](#bullet) Gundham attempted to move some of the books on a shelf of the Archives and was unable to dislodge any book in the row whatsoever.

[Glass Pieces](#bullet) Fuyuhiko tried to gather the scattered glass shards. He used a book to transport the pieces but quickly abandoned the idea when the jagged edges began slicing into the book’s cover with minimal pressure.

[Kirumi's Testimony](#bullet) Kirumi claims that her task entailed cooking a lot of food, so she kept the Kitchen (Biology Lab) occupied from 7:45AM to 10PM. She can testify that Kaito, Maki, Ibuki, Yasuhiro, Komaru, Gundham, Angie, and Himiko, and only these people, entered the kitchen at various times outside of usual meal hours, when the kitchen was not off-limits.

[Knife Holder](#bullet) The kitchen knives are stored in a stand affixed to the countertop, but one of the knives is missing. The object is coated with water on the outside.
 
[Ibuki's Testimony](#bullet) During investigation, Ibuki was investigating the kitchen, and while handling the knife holder, accidentally let her ring fall inside one of the slits. She tried several methods to get it out, but she couldn't find a way into the opening. 

[Mukuro and Maki’s Testimony](#bullet) During their investigation, Mukuro and Maki discussed the possibility of hiding in the Archives. They confirmed that the entrance offered a clear view of all corners. Although they identified a way for a makeshift stack of books to possibly conceal someone, it would stand out enough to arouse suspicion.

[Kitchen's State](#bullet) According to Kirumi, during the investigation period, she found in the Kitchen everything charred, and whatever was not charred was wet, and if they weren't wet they were spattered with grease and leftovers. Who could be the culprit behind this?",1,1738936996.0,DanganRoleplay,0,1.0,False

Winter is going to end eventually and the sad snow will melt, letting my heart be warm once again. I got broken up by some guy who just ghosted me and refused to give me a clean break after months of happiness. 

I was in prague drinking my heart out, i wrote a postcard where i told him i missed the old him, the kind listening warm short man whose smile would light a room. I was planning to give it to him if he wanted to see me one last time, that i would have appreciated a hard no rather than a ghosting session. He chose the latter so now i have a letter to burn (i even added matchsticks to it if he wanted to burn it, so it's sort of intended)

I never wanted to scare him, he never wanted to hurt me. We ended up doing exactly that. I saw his best friend today, wanted to look for her when i was leaving to say bye and give her a little souvenir from prague, but i was afraid of meeting him as well and just went out the side door. He used to be so kind.

Just seeing a tree reminds me of his beauty, every good feeling reminds me of the way he used to treat me, we both liked those reels of peter griffin saying the n word, so my feed is full of his picture next to a heart under every single post i would have sent him.

I went to our coffee spot today with a friend, the barista asked if the guy was sick. she always found us cute and would always send a free sweet to share with our coffee.

So I had mentioned the strong mechanical sound in my ears long after recovering from an illness to my previous Dr. He said there was still some fluid and it would go away eventually. 
I had ""greyed"" out vision, especially when bending over. It got bad enough I called an eye dr. She says I have either a brain tumor or this other thing, which turns out was iih. I freak out, immediately head to the er for an mri. They do a spinal tap, apparently I have crazy high pressure. I freak out on that mri machine, so I go to hartford hospital where they have an open mri. The next morning they finally tell me it's not a tumah! But is iih. I'm given acetazolimide and sent on my merry way. That was about 2 years ago. I went to a neurosurgeon who was like will put in a stint it'll drain to your stomach and then I never heard from him again. I went to a special eye dr who was like yep, that's what you have. And I never heard from them again. I went to a neuro ophthalmologist who switched me to topamax, said my eyes were fine, and the stint guy shouldn't be practicing medicine. The topamax didn't help. I saw my regular eye dr who said I had much improved and that she could manage it in the office, no big deal. Cool. I switched reg drs and my new doc set me up with a new rx for acetazolomide.
I still have symptoms, but nothing terrible. Then I forgot to take my meds for like 2 weeks. I was getting headaches like every day and so confused and then I remembered. I started taking it again and expected all the usual side effects, weird tastes and tingling in extremities. But oh boy has this week been crap. I can barely keep my eyes open. I am cracked with pain, like a baseball bat to the back on my head every morning. I still have mad pressure in my ears. I don't know if this is just me readjusting to meds or if I'm dying right now. 
So I google, I find this subreddit. I start seeing things about restricting caffeine, carbonation, the meds can make you tired, people tossing out numbers like they know things. Ya'll, no one has told me anything. When my feet wouldn't stop tingling I had to Google it to find out that's a normal side effect. Ya'll. I drink coffee like it's my job. When the meds made my McDonald's diet coke taste like spicy earwax I powered through until I loved it again. Coffee and diet coke are easily 99% of what I drink in a day, and that is not an exaggeration. I heard weight loss helps, and I gained a lot of weight quickly so it tracks, but doing anything makes me feel like crap. I can't bend over! 
Anyway what dr do you all see for this that they're giving you medical advice? Or did you have to Google everything too?

Stepped out I felt the ground was moving I really didn't care that much, I went home and slept and woke up at night then went with my brother to a cafe and I ordered cortado again since they don’t sell anything that’s not coffee related, (I drank it on an empty stomach ) and I used their elevator to go up to the washroom and felt the same thing I felt in the morning, then we were heading home I felt dizzy and numbness in my whole face and my feet and hands + they were cold, we went straight to the ER they gave me an IV and did blood tests and they were all good they blame it on the coffee + I didn’t eat anything, after a few hours they discharged me and went home but still felt dizzy and numb in my face and didn’t get out of bed for two weeks I get up only to go to the bathroom because I was dizzy all the time, I got a bit better but started to notice new symptoms like my toes are twitching by itself and sometimes my thumbs, but still can’t do anything without getting tired fast and feeling dizzy, or feeling dizzy because I didn’t eat for 5 hours ( before all of that happened I could not eat for a whole day and don’t feel anything) and I used to walk for hours without getting tired now I barely walk for 30mins and already feel tired and dizzy, fast forward to 2024/September I was getting ready to sleep and felt the same thing that happened to me that night happening again but a bit lighter, I went to the ER again but while I was there I felt better in like an hour all the symptoms got better but the numbness was still there, I did vitamin tests everything was OK except Vitamin D was around 7-8 and they gave me a course for it, but the main diagnosis said it’s a panic attack, but it can’t be it doesn't add up with being in bed for 2 weeks when it happened to me the first time and since April I can’t live my life normally without feeling fatigued or getting dizzy even from the smallest effort like cleaning my room, I’ve been forwarded to a neurologist and did a lot of different blood tests and MRI without contrast and a Holter device for 24 hours the MRI was to rule out Wilson disease.

But now? Was I shocked? Perhaps. Maybe he was right when he said I hadn't reacted as he expected. It would have made sense if I had thrown a vase at his head; that might have even been the right thing to do. But I didn't feel like doing that yesterday.

I come to you today with a plea for you to tell me what I'm doing wrong my Ode w/ SSP burrs. I've had this grinder just shy of 3 years, it is well seasoned, and has brewed MANY cups of coffee since then. However, I feel like about 80% of my cups are just not... *not good.*

My brews are generally very muddy tasting, usually bitter and astringent. Occassionally, some truly AMAZING cups, but those are so few and far between. I've tried numerous recipes (Hedrick's 1:2:1, 4:6. Hoffman 1 cup, 2 cup, Rogue Wave. you name it I've tried it. Also tried recalibrating (have not tried aligning because I honestly can't be assed to do it. It never seemed worth it to me. I bought the grinder with SSP MP burrs installed from Fellow.

My burrs are currently calibrated to 5 clicks past chirp, per Fellow's instructions. I've tried grind sizes varying from 3 all the way to 7,2, to no avail. 

The recipe I've defaulted to these days has been a simple 1 pour recipe. 15g dose, 250g water, 50g 45s bloom, no manual agitation, pour to 250g gently. about an inch from the brew bed, right before water stream breaks up to reduce agitation. I did this recipe this morning with an Ethiopian Aleta Wondo from Florin Coffee (shout out to them), and it was undrinkable. Ground at 5,0, it was super bitter and sour, none of the notes on the can shining through, first time in a while I've dumped down the drain and pulled out my Aeropress.

To those who have an Ode w/ SSP burrs, what do you/did you do that made these burrs work for you? I feel like I'm missing out on truly exceptional coffee, and unfortunately wasting money. I appreciate any insight y'all can give me :)",1,1738936741.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

I started blending random coffees that I like on a whim one day some years ago and have been doing it ever since.. And one day my brother's partner brought me some Starbucks Christmas 2024 blend and decided to blend it with one of my favorite coffees; Death Wish dark roast.. I also added some Starbucks Italian roast that I had lying around for good measure and the resulting coffee was exquisite.

If anyone has any Christmas 2024 still lying around, I recommend you try this blend I made and see for yourself how good it is. 

I grind the ""ground"" coffee further, into an espresso grind. And I don't know how much you like to use for your coffee so I'll just say the ratio I used.

2 parts Death Wish Dark Roast,
1 part Christmas blend 2024,
1 part Italian Roast.

Let me know what you think. 

I think it's the rare aged Sumatra that's in the Christmas blend that makes it so good. I just tried to make it with again substituting in Starbucks Sumatra dark roast but it's not the same.. 

Sadly, I can't find the 2024 blend anywhere.. Anyway, just thought I'd share this for anyone that still has it.. And if you know where I can get a bag, let me know. Thanks. ",1,1738936736.0,starbucks,0,1.0,False

1ijvkpy,https://www.reddit.com/r/rome/comments/1ijvkpy/scam_or_genuine/,Scam or genuine?,"Had something happen today and I really can’t tell if it was a precursor to a scam or a genuine interaction (as I’m still getting used to Italian cultural norms) so any insight would be helpful so I know how to better react if it happens again! 

For context: I’m living Rome for a couple of months by myself and speak some Italian. However, I don’t look Italian in that I’m very fair and blonde (Nordic) so people tend to assume I’m a foreigner regardless.

So I’m walking up Via del Tritone at around 1:30pm this afternoon (Friday). A guy crosses the street and stops me – he looks Italian, and is dressed like a guy just out of the office for lunch (smart casual, work bag, etc.) He asks if I speak English and I say yes; he asks if I have a lighter, I say no. He then asks if he can take me for a coffee. I was so surprised by this that I lied and said I was late to meet a friend and took off.

My reaction was basically auto-pilot: where I’m from, if someone asks you out in the middle of the street, you would assume they’re insane or a creep. But as I walked away, it occurred to me that this might be much more normal behaviour in Italy that I just wasn’t used to. He didn’t look like a guy prowling the streets looking for tourists to pickpocket or scam but then maybe that’s an act?

I felt a little bad for turning him down so fast, especially when I’ve been struggling to meet locals to practise my Italian with (everyone I know here is a foreigner so it’s not quite the same) but at the same time, I’m wary that there are so many scam artists in Rome and similar cities, that maybe I did the right thing to get out of there.

TLDR, is asking strangers out for coffee in the middle of the street culturally normal in Italy or was this guy leading into a scam?

He (34m) hasn’t had a formal salaried or even hourly job in the past few years because he was attempting to run his own business. It’s stalled as of right now. He got a job, carried it through to the end of the 8 months contract and now doesn’t have a job again. This is all relevant. 

He routinely goes to sleep between 3 - 6am because “he’s not tired” or “he wants to have alone time to just zone out” or “he is doing paperwork or doing taxes (for his business that’s in the red).” He then wakes up between 1-3pm, takes an hour to wake up/eat/scroll through socials then maybe does the dishes or puts in a load of laundry or walks our dogs. 

I WFH 40-50hrs/week. I have a routine where I wake up early, take care of our dogs, unload the dishwasher, make breakfast and coffee, clean the kitchen up or put in a load of laundry and begin work for the day. I do 3 out of 5 dog walks a day, I go grocery shopping for dinner on my lunch breaks, and I often do most of the cleaning tasks. It also makes me upset that I go to sleep alone every night and that I basically feel like I’m a single person in a marriage. 

I’ve (32F) expressed how uncomfortable I am with this arrangement. How I don’t like doing an imbalanced amount of work around the house on top of my job. How I hate going to sleep alone every night. How I can’t take the stress of constantly cleaning, grocery shopping, taking care of the dogs, and doing my day job. It’s impacting my health on every level. 

I’ve cried and begged him to change. He says he will go to sleep by 2:30am instead of later and wake up by 12pm as a compromise. He often doesn’t hold true to this. He changes for a bit then doesn’t keep it up. 

It’s all of this plus our families constantly asking me if he’s found a job yet or why is he waking up so late or why doesn’t he help me with cleaning or with the dogs. It’s exhausting. 

I’ve begged him to go to couples therapy to work on this issue and he doesn’t want to go because therapy never worked for him. 

Is this issue with his sleeping schedule a problem only for me or is it truly as ludicrous as I think? ",6,1738936553.0,AmIOverreacting,7,1.0,False

(Throwaway account because my family knows my original)

Me and my cousins sister (whom I will refer to from here onwards as my sister) have not always been super close but have kept in touch through college, work and married life. I had always thought of her as a spoiled child who did not care about the family and got things the way she wanted always. She moved out in her early 20’s to Germany to study and later started working there in corporate.

She had been inviting me to come visit her since years and I decided to go there in December. She usually goes with her friends and their families for a weekend to a house near the mountains that they all rent and since I would be with her then, she invited me to join her too. 

That entire weekend got me questioning my life. I was in the kitchen in the morning and I saw her husband make a cup of coffee to wake her up from bed. She led a yoga class with me and her other friends while all the husbands made breakfast for all of us. I cannot even fathom asking my husband to do this, especially in front of my in laws. My entire morning is filled with getting them ready and going to work, school (I am a housewife). During the day they were talking about their careers, promotions, what they wanted to buy etc. and I felt so left out. It must be nice to have money to buy what you want, especially with 2 people earning. I have to ask my husband even to buy a saree. 

Later in the evening we decided to watch a movie  ‘The great Indian kitchen’ and I hate it that I could not see initially what was wrong with the movie initially because it felt like the life of any woman. But they were talking about how they could never imagine to live like that and later I started seeing how much better their life actually was. And I felt happy that it was not their life. It was nice that they were living a different life.

The thing that I hate the most from the entire holiday was that that could have been me. I could be living a life like that. When we were young, she even fought with my parents to let me do an MBA. I hated her then because she was forcing me to start a career after I got my degree but that meant I had to move away from my parents which I thought was selfish. I was judging her for leaving her mother alone and moving abroad. I thought I was being a good daughter. But she now send money to her mother every month and even took her on vacation around Europe last year, while I have to ask my husband for money. My husband is nice. He has never hit me and loves me and my kids. He also sends money to my parents when his business is doing well. When not, then he supports only his parents. But I see how much of a regressive family I live in now. 

I wish I could live her life but there is nothing I am so now to change that. I just wanted tell this out to someone since nobody around me could understand how I feel now.",3,1738936121.0,OffMyChestIndia,2,1.0,False

I was at peace within myself and laughed when I got off of his bus. I wouldn't trade my world for his. That's for sure.

....

On my way back to the shelter I stopped twice. Found a really nice shade tree in a residential area next to a church with an empty playground. Hi g out for a while. Everyone was at work and I left before kids started getting back from school. 

You don't want to make the natives restless.

Near the shelter there is a park. I was hoping to find a couple of trees for the hammock. That's a big ask in this community so far.

I did find a marginally shady tree surrounded by dog poop that had been there for a minute.

I used the back of my hand to clear a spot. I ended up taking a nice nap and woke up to the sound of my alarm.

Once I get to the shelter, I'm in line for food. Waiting for them to open. Keeping to myself.

I'll be friendly to almost anyone who talks to me, but I rarely initiate any conversations.

I see a dude come up with a lot g, black trench, a bit dirty (crusty even) with a guitar sling. No gear.

Hmmm.

He's one of y'all.

I admire the faith. For real.

It hasn't been cold but it will be. Even a train ride out of here and you're going to have to deal with that.

I admire that as well.

....

I think the tracks go East/West and they aren't far from the shelter. I want to try it, but if I do it will be solo. I'm not trying to be ""locked"" in a moving prison with a cell I barely know.

Too many ""bums"" are the smartest person you ever met, have every skill imagineanle and are fucking bores me to tears.

Sham is the man. That dude is the real deal with real skills. I would still do this solo.

....

Shower time.

My peace isn't even a thing. Two different people playing music on their phones. One fi ammy leaves. The other is still playing music and then talking.

He's a redneck (I'm a redneck too. Except I'm not racist, but in many ways I would qualify).

He's about 5' 4"" tall. Maybe 5' 6"" tall.

130 lbs soaking wet.

I'm not judging. I'm just setting the scene.

There's a guy from Kenya in the shower.

I'm exiting and see these two standing there. I had heard them talking but assumed they were in the shower.

""You're from Kenya?""

(I bet you hate it here. You can't hunt antelopes with spears.""

Inside I'm groaning.

Thinking to myself. This dude is about 6' 3"" tall, wirery and from Kenya.

You might want to lay off the spear chucking talk.

Kenyan dude is chill. Smile. Slight laughter.

(People smile and laugh when they are uncomfortable. I don't know that he was. I just know the smile doesn't mean they like it.)

I've got my eyes on my own paper. Kenyan dude doesn't need me to protect him from little guy like that.

(Don't get mad little guys, but even professional boxers that size can't knock each other out. For real. It happens rarely.) The kid will need a hammer.

This keeps on and I'm still drying off. Getting annoyed, but minding my business.

I can't even remember the question, but the kid looks up at me and tries to get me to crack on the Kenyan dude about spear chucking (I'm using that term for a reason. It's a racial tripe and the kid was ignorant as fuck. Not racist. Just a little fucking dummy.

(My picture and name is all over my posts.)

I paused.

""Dude. It's not the 1950s. Kenyans have guns.""

I looked up to make eye contact with the Kenyan dude.

He smiles.

""Yes. We have guns too.""

Little Man doesn't realize. I don't know about Kenya specifically.

But some of these kids that are from that part of the world have been exposed to extreme violence using assault rifles.

That shit ain't the same as practicing at the range.

....

Where am I going with this post?

There are so many varieties of ""dumb bums"" (me included) that it's exhausting for me 

I just try to keep to myself.

The only thing I know we have in common is that we probably don't have a family situation that we want, or wants us.

We may be there to save money. Maybe not 

We may not even need a roof over our head.

What I know we have in common is that we're there.

That should be enough.

So if you see me (long haired, old dude) keep the ficko g spear comments to yourself.

Once you go down that road, I'll always turn my back on you and act like I don't hear you. I wouldnt give you the time of day much less anything else.

We are not the same.

Redneck or not?

So far my favorites are the double espresso dolce and the cafecito de Puerto Rico. I’ve been making a foam of half & half, hot cocoa powder (cocoa & sugar) lol. Used to get Starbucks a lot and this is so much better I don’t even go there anymore. 

Last time I was in Italy was 2015 where I tried ginseng espresso and have been obsessed ever since. Seems that’s where most people have had it. I ended up finding ginseng (original) pods on Amazon and bought a knock off Nespresso machine. It was great! They eventually weren’t available anymore and buying directly from the company didn’t work because they wouldn’t ship to the US. So I bought 200 pods and shipped them to my aunt in Italy. A family member was going to visit so they brought them back for me. 

Thought I found some recently, but they were for a bialetti machine. It’s just instant coffee so luckily I can open the pods and use my aerocino to make a cup! These pods literally took a month to and a half to get here as they came from Europe. 

Question, and I’ve searched this sub for “ginseng delight” already, but who do I need to talk to in order to get ginseng delight available in the US 😩 I’m about to have my cousin in Italy place and order for me and then have him ship my coffee to me!

Hi there. This is the year I want to be the best version of myself. I’m trying to eat healthier, I go to the gym 2-3 days a week. My problem is I don’t feel like I’m utilizing my mornings but I find it hard on my work days. I’m a hairdresser and I work Tuesday-Friday. The days I work  look like this. 

7am-wake up, brush teeth and take dog out 

7:10- feed dog and make coffee/ pick up living room/ put away dishes if needed 

7:15-8am- drink coffee, read, scroll phone 

8am-8:45- make bed, skin care routine put on make up and do hair 

8:45-9:15- pack lunch and make breakfast 

9:15-9:50 work commute 

10am-7pm: work day 

7pm-7:35: drive home 

7:35-8:15: let dog out then cook dinner for myself or my bf and I 

8:30: shower 

8:30-10pm: watch tv or read then go to bed. 


I would like to feel more energetic in the morning. I know taking a walk or some form of fitness would help me. I feel like my morning is rushed right now and even during my 45 min coffee time I’m just looking at the clock knowing I have to get ready for work soon. With having long work days/ socializing the whole time and standing on my feet I feel like I have no energy and it’s effecting my moods during my work week. I want to feel happier and more positive and I know when I do follow a good morning routine it sets myself up for the day. Where can I make improvements?

Budgeting Tips for College Students: Eating Healthy Without Breaking the Bank
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Eating healthy while you’re in college can be a challenge, especially when you're on a budget. With rising tuition and student loans, finding affordable yet nutritious food options is essential. Here are some practical tips and strategies to help you maintain a balanced diet without draining your bank account.

-Get access to the Ultimate Vegan Cookbook package here--&gt; https://hownow101.com/vegan-recipes  
### Plan Your Meals

Meal planning is one of the best ways to manage your food budget effectively. By planning ahead, you can avoid impulse buys at the grocery store and ensure you have everything you need for the week. Here’s how you can get started:

- **Make a weekly menu:** Choose meals you enjoy that can be prepared in bulk.
- **Create a shopping list:** Stick to it to avoid unnecessary purchases.
- **Utilize grocery flyers:** Check local ads for sales on healthy items.

### Shop Smart

Be strategic about where and when you shop. Here are some tips to help you become a savvy shopper:

- **Buy in bulk:** Items like rice, pasta, beans, and oats are cheaper when purchased in larger quantities.
- **Choose store brands:** These products are often less expensive and of similar quality to name brands.
- **Go seasonal:** Fruits and vegetables that are in season tend to be cheaper and fresher.
- **Stock up when on sale:** Purchase non-perishable items when they are discounted.

### Make the Most of Frozen Foods

Frozen fruits and vegetables can be a great budget-friendly option. They are often just as nutritious as their fresh counterparts and can be stored for longer periods. Plus, you can use them whenever you need a healthy addition to your meals. Consider:

- Frozen berries for smoothies or oatmeal.
- Mixed vegetables that can be easily added to stir-fries or casseroles.
- Frozen whole-grain bread, which can be used for quick sandwiches.

### Cook at Home

Dining out can significantly increase your food expenses. Cooking at home is not only cheaper but also allows you to control the ingredients. Here are some simple cooking tips:

-Get access to the Ultimate Vegan Cookbook package here--&gt; https://hownow101.com/vegan-recipes  
- **Embrace one-pot meals:** These dishes are easy to prepare and clean up. Think soups, stews, or casseroles.
- **Learn some basic recipes:** Familiar dishes such as stir-fries or pasta can be adapted to use lower-cost ingredients.
- **Host potlucks:** Get together with friends and share cooking responsibilities.

### Incorporate Affordable Protein Sources

Protein is essential for a balanced diet, but it can also be expensive. Here are some affordable proteins to consider:

- **Legumes:** Lentils, chickpeas, and black beans are packed with protein and very low-cost.
- **Tofu:** This versatile ingredient can be used in a variety of dishes and is often inexpensive.
- **Eggs:** A great source of protein that can be used in various recipes.

### Stay Hydrated Wisely

Drinking water is vital for your health and budget. Instead of spending money on sugary drinks or coffee, invest in a reusable water bottle. Here’s what to keep in mind:

- **Flavored water:** Add fruits or herbs to your water for a refreshing taste.
- **Learn to brew coffee at home:** This can save you a significant amount over time.

Balancing your health and budget as a college student is absolutely feasible. With some planning and smart shopping, you can enjoy a nutritious diet without overspending. Remember to make the most of seasonal produce, learn to cook, and utilize affordable protein options. Your body (and wallet) will thank you!

### Easy and Healthy Snack Ideas

When hunger strikes between classes, having healthy snacks on hand can help you avoid unhealthy vending machine items. Here’s a list of quick, affordable snacks:

-Get access to the Ultimate Vegan Cookbook package here--&gt; https://hownow101.com/vegan-recipes

Implementing these budget-friendly strategies can help you sustain a healthy diet throughout your college years without putting too much strain on your finances. Prioritizing meal prep, knowing when to shop, and embracing affordable ingredients can go a long way toward achieving your wellness goals in college.

I lost both my cats in 2024Q4, the second one quite tragically (she was a rescued from the streets colourpoint girl). 
A week after her passing, while being devastated, crying over my morning coffee, my mind was dealing with my boyfriend's words from the night before ""You should get a cat, you should navigate all the love you have to a creature in need"". ""Should"" was a very strong word for a grieving catmom. However, he planted a seed in my mind. I was very negative about adopting another cat soon. But that morning my mind was daydreaming: how would I name the next cat that comes my way? The word that came to my head was ""Roxy""... 

Two hours later, the animal welfare group that I adopted my late babygirl, sent me a photo of a ragdoll with a message that read ""This is Roxanne. She's 8yo. Her person was admitted to a nursing home and their family cannot take care of her so she has been living in an apartment alone for some months and they visit her often to feed her and spend some time with her. They are looking for someone who will love her beyond her being a purebreed and they will not trust anyone. We believe you are the one"" (Please let's not judge those people, that's not the point, I have met them and they were lovely, there were specific reasons they could not adopt her). 

When I tell you I was negative, I mean it. Then guilt kicked in. I had a home without a cat. She was living in a house without a person. So I succumbed and arranged a meeting with her and her guardians. My boyfriend came along (he was so excited) and Roxanne was as unfriendly as expected. I liked that. She had an attitude. Not aggressive but assertive.
But I was still negative. I was grieving, I could not take the risk of opening my heart again to a cat. 
A week passed and Roxanne's guardians were expecting an answer from me. The animal welfare group encouraged me to adopt her, my boyfriend was ecstatic and I was feeling a lot of pressure. Out of guilt, I did adopt her... 

3 months later... I am still grieving. While I enjoy her huge personality. She is blooming in front of my eyes. She has lost half a kilo (she has ideal weight now according to my vet) just because she has stopped munching down loads of food at once and she is more active than before. We play, we run, we have fun and lots of cuddles. She is still quite assertive 🤣 My iron lady! Day by day she trusts me more and shows me her personality more and more. I'm forever grateful for the people who encouraged me to welcome her in my home. We rescued each other. 
It's not about her breed.
It's not about her beauty. 
It's about the trust we decided to share. ",3,1738935645.0,ragdolls,0,1.0,False
1ijv7y0,https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/1ijv7y0/the_lord_of_ten_thousand_men_and_ten_million/,The Lord of Ten Thousand Men and Ten Million Grains - A fanfiction tale of Shogunworld,"Sometime in 2035.

Day 1:

Delos HQ was buzzing as the operations team monitored their parks: Westworld was running smoothly, The Raj in good order, and then there was Shogunworld. With its ambitious feudal Japan theme, it was a masterpiece of storytelling, immersive worldbuilding, and detailed renditions of samurai honor, ninja intrigue, and strict social hierarchies. Everything meticulously polished. Controlled chaos, just like Westworld.

But by midday of the park's newest visitor's arrival, things were... odd.

""Who's this guy?"" asked Kelly in the Control Room. She hailed the feed from a set of hosts—a small band of ronin—who were trailing a new guest.

""Reservation says he's a VIP. Charles Weatherby. Supposedly some billionaire who collects literal katanas. Big Kurasawa guy—wrote something in the 'personal visitor goals' about 'defining the spirit of bushido.'""

""Well, he's certainly putting the system through its paces,"" Kelly murmured. But as the narrative feed updated every few minutes, Charles wasn’t just playing the stoic samurai fantasy the park advertised.

He was recruiting.

By sunset, he'd already convinced two ronin and one wandering peasant storyteller to join his ""band."" His weapon? A few calm speeches... and a rough sack of rice.

""Wait,"" said Kelly, leaning toward her monitor, ""is... is that guest giving out rice?""

Day 2:

The Delos team wasn’t alarmed at first. Shogunworld was filled with wandering ronin, peasants, farmers, and ninja clans. Guests were, frankly, encouraged to interact with them. But this wasn't a normal interaction.

The guest had used the in-park currency to purchase rice, and redistributed it carefully. First to attach a couple of ronin to his person. Then to win over a few villagers. And it was rewriting entire host interactions on the fly. Social hierarchies were eroding by the second.

By the middle of his second day, reports began filtering into Operations: somehow, Charles had convinced an entire ninja clan to pledge loyalty to him. Rice and poetic flattery had, apparently, usurped their assassination contract.

Kelly almost spat out her coffee at the news. ""Wait—he’s got ninjas now?! But ninjas are supposed to stay loyal to the daimyo who hired them!""

""Not when they’re offered a ‘year’s worth of rice,’ apparently,"" grumbled Martin, someone from Behavioural. ""He's literally hijacking the subsistence programming. Our entire economic structure for the park assumed guests would throw gold or violence, not food.""

""Okay, so what? what about the daimyos? Fielding an army should make them make moves against him!""

""Oh, he’s already made enemies out of two of the daimyos. They sent assassins after him... and he recruited them.""

Kelly choked on her laughter. ""He recruited his own assassins? How?""

""Rice,"" Martin deadpanned. ""He bribed them with rice.""

Day 3

By the third morning, the park was in chaos. Charles had consolidated an army that was, essentially, the bulk of the wandering ronin from narrative, completely derailing established storylines. Every available samurai seemed to now answer to him.

Operations could barely scramble to respond. ""The daimyos aren't functioning properly anymore,"" one tech said during the daily briefing. ""The balance of power in the northern territories is collapsing. Charles Weatherby has parked his 'loyalists'—which include three ninja clans now, by the way—on the key trade route and has declared himself the future-fucking-Shogun.""

Kelly pinched the bridge of her nose. ""Okay, so... we have narratives derailed, ronin refusing to complete their scripted feuds, ninja clans ignoring contracts, host daimyos sulking in their palaces because apparently, they're 'afraid of Weatherby’s army,' and we can’t even drop in narrative overrides because they’re all still somehow following their cornerstones. How... how did we even let this guy do this?""

By noon, the flood of incident reports reached QA. Charles had initiated battles between guests and his ""army,"" hosted feasts where guests were served virtual rice balls by villagers, and challenged other wandering solo samurai guests to ""duels over ideals."" The chief complaint? Some guests didn’t want to fight; they wanted tea ceremonies or ninja infiltration missions, only to find their objectives had been preemptively co-opted by Charles's ""Shogunate.""

The overseers debated whether to intervene.

""Kill-switch his character data?""

""Deactivate the loyalty flags?""

""If we nuke one VIP's run, all the other guests lose immersion too. And frankly, this is the most entertainment Shogunworld’s gotten since we started scrubbing and tweaking Lee's copy-paste crap.""

Day 4

By the time Charles reached the gates of his first daimyo’s castle on the evening of day four, he had staged three skirmishes, delivered fiery monologues about ""liberating the people,"" and led a mock trial for a captured sumo wrestler-turned-mercenary. His loyal army now included over a hundred hosts, plus a handful of enchanted guests swept up in his emergent narrative.

Delos executives convened as QA observed his latest move: a dramatic poetry duel with one of the daimyos, interrupted only when he offered the opposing samurai **five sacks of rice** to ""lay down their swords and live for the people.""

The room fell silent.

And then someone whispered: ""Do we just... let him win?""

Day 5

Inside the Yama, the Hub of the park, the mood inside the conference room was tense. Coffee was spilled, outlets were unplugged, monitors hummed nervously. An air of doom swirled as three departments—Operations from QA, Narrative, and Host Behaviour faced off across the table. The fallout had arrived from the top, and instead of addressing it calmly, everyone had devolved into yelling.

""HOW did this happen?!"" thundered Carla from Operations, slamming her tablet down. “Because I have guests waiting for their fucking tea ceremony, and their hosts just abandoned them to go fight in a fucking rice rebellion! Explain that to me, Greg! Explain it!”

Greg, a senior narrative designer who took Lee's job, stood up so violently that his chair almost toppled. ""NO, Carla. Don’t even start with me. This is on your Operations high-horses, copy-pasting the Westworld design philosophy onto feudal Japan! You thought you could just slap some fake coins into the simulation, call them ‘yen,’ and declare it the economy?! What did you think the samurai were going to do with them? *Go* shopping?!""

""It made sense!” Carla shot back. “Scrip works in Westworld, doesn’t it? We wouldn’t be complaining if Weatherby just stuck to the usual narratives the way it was designed!""

“The way it was designed?” Greg nearly threw his coffee over the table in frustration. “You mean rigged? Yeah, sure, because there’s definitely a Walmart in 16th-century Japan. Don’t you dare sit there and act like guests handing out coins like it’s fucking tipping night at Benihana fits in this setting! Basic Sengoku Jidai knowledge - you run an economy on RICE. GRAIN. ACTUAL TANGIBLE SURVIVAL RESOURCES. Did any of you Operations geniuses skim the design brief for Shogunworld, or were you all too busy ordering more goddamn fake geishas from Manufacturing for Arrival?!”

Carla’s assistant nervously tapped her wrist. “To be fair,” they murmured, “the geishas are VERY hot—”

“Shut up, Kara!” Carla snapped, watching as Greg stormed to the whiteboard and picked up a marker with a trembling hand, scrawling a quick diagram of medieval Japan on the whiteboard.

“For starters: society is not built on shiny gold gachapon tokens! The Daimyo didn’t give a flying fuck about currency. Peasants didn’t care about coins because they didn’t have goddamn wallets. All they wanted was to survive, which meant FOOD.” He underlined the word so hard the pen squeaked. “You see this word? F-O-O-D? Congratulations, you’ve just met their entire value system.”

“I’m going to stop you right there—” started Carla.

“NO. SHUT UP.” He pointed the marker at her like a spear. “Everyone in this goddamn park is wired to live and breathe **rice**. It’s in their core behavioral settings, right next to ‘don’t stab the guest unless stabbed,’ and ‘be ready with a vaguely insightful haiku whenever prompted.’ This is not a bug for forensics. This is the CORNERSTONES YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO UNDERSTAND.”

""But—"" Carla tried to interject, but Greg continued.

""And don't even get me STARTED on the class dynamics! The samurai—the literal noble class, HATED merchants,"" Greg roared, banging on the whiteboard like it had offended him personally. ""To them, merchants were middlemen. Parasites. They didn’t EARN anything; they just traded other people's hard-earned crops for coin, so the daimyo and samurai despised them. But rice? Oh, rice was divine. Rice meant power. Rice meant armies. You fed those hosts rice, you weren’t just giving some peasants a meal—you were PROMISING THEM LIFE ITSELF.""

Carla folded her arms. “So what? We were supposed to base the whole damn park’s currency system on rice tokens? Because that sounds real playable, doesn’t it, Greg?”

“No, you WEREN’T.” Greg spun back around, marker still in hand. “You weren’t supposed to touch the currency system in the first place! Did you even CONSULT Narrative on this? Or Behavioral AI? Noooo, you just WALKED IN with your Westworld ideas and said, ‘Ooooh, modernityyyyy... let’s give samurai some metal coins and hope they don’t notice their social order is complete bullshit now.’ Meanwhile, you somehow overlooked the literal CONSUMABLE UNIT OF LIFE. Rice isn’t just food to these people; it’s status, it’s economy, it’s military logistics—EVERYTHING. Your idiotic ‘yen-based’ scrip system let Weatherby bypass all the park’s artificial bottlenecks with ONE historically accurate bribe!”

""I mean,"" chimed Evelyn from Host Behaviour, leaning back in her chair, ""he’s not wrong."" She gestured vaguely to Greg with her coffee mug. “Rice *is* hardcoded into the behavioral loops of the hosts. We baked it in because it’s basically survival at every level of the hierarchy. The peasants will go nuts for it, sure, but even the samurai—your big bad ronin and even the daimyo—see rice as their most untouchable resource. Bribing with coins? Sure, that works because we told them to and because it fed the narratives. But rice? Rice answers the **why** of half their core motivations.""

Greg threw his hands toward Evelyn, vindicated. ""See?! She gets it! Why don’t YOU?!”

""WE DIDN’T KNOW RICE WAS THAT BIG A DEAL!"" Carla snapped, slamming her fists onto the table.

Greg’s jaw dropped. ""YOU. DIDN’T. KNOW?! How?! How, Carla? It's LITERALLY IN THE FIRST PAGE OF THE DESIGN BRIEF! AND IN EVERY KUROSAWA FILM EVER MADE!""

""THAT'S BECAUSE NO ONE WATCHES THE KUROSAWA FILMS, GREG!"" yelled Carla back. ""SOME OF US ARE TOO BUSY MAKING A PARK **RUN**!""",2,1738935643.0,westworld,3,1.0,False

It's my last quarter in London before I'm off to Paris for 1-1,5 years before coming back again - only due to visa expiry reasons. I love this city, I'll miss it, so I'm having this massive FOMO.

What you, guys - foodies, culture nerds, museum goers, hikers, music fans (esp jazz, classic rock) - would suggest on putting on my absolute to-do liste before I go?

A bit of background: I've been living here for the past 3 years, but was in and out of the UK with studies and work, so I'm not a newbie. My favourite activities are really good quality 1) music and discovering new music venues playing great jazz, opening up new rock and blues or ethnic jazz bands, then I love international 2) food as I've travelled around the world extensively - your fav food spots in any part of London would go to my list! If you don't want to reveal your secret spots here, I'd appreciate DMs a lot! :)

I love 3) hiking - your fav, the best hiking routes in April/early May around Enland, not too far from London (2-3 hours on the train max). Fav destinations for weekend aways in England with National Heritage sites or just very pretty villages with spas etc?

Also, do you have your list of 4) cultural events for spring season? I'm hunting for ""Seagull"" with Kate Blanchet at Barbican. Things like that! Maybe, then bands or great shows I'm missing out?

Anything else that comes up to your mind - maybe, your fav London routine, like the best coffee spot, the best pretty place to walk around, great second-hand bookstores to go explore, any other spots/activities?

1ijv3n4,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1ijv3n4/why_do_i_feel_neglected_by_parents_even_though_i/,Why do I feel neglected by parents even though I know they care?,"Neglect is probably the wrong word for this, and I'm well aware I may come off as exaggerated or ungrateful to most who will read this, because I won't lie, I probably am. I don't expect this to get much attention, but I just feel like I need to get it off my chest.

My parents had a total of 2 daughters, my older sister and myself. My older sister and I are extremely close, but a couple months ago, she went to California to find work and help the family out since we were struggling through poverty at the time, and ever since then it's just been me and my parents. 

Now, everything was fine at first, I became more responsible over my chores and learned to be more productive in helping my parents around the house. I think I should include that I genuinely consider myself a good daughter towards them, and they seem to think so too; I do everything they ask of me in a good manner, and I'm respectful towards them at all times. This entire sentiment may be due to the fact that I seem to be developing a sort of emotional detachment, I think I should clarify that I have no PTSD, I simply find myself in a low state or point in my life due to the way others perceive or treat me.

After my sister left, I noticed just how low my interactions with my parents were, and with complete sincerity, it was partly if not mostly my fault; I was used to only speaking with my sister that when she left, I had no idea how to speak to them. I spoke to them as if they were my teachers or some store employee: polite and brief. 

My parents are both amazing people and I couldn't be more grateful to have them as my parents, however, it seems anytime I speak with them, they either ignore, or have little to no interest in what I have to say; I understood since we don't exactly have similar hobbies or interest— I would probably consider myself the black sheep in my family when it comes to what I enjoy. 

This wasn't an issue until it actually started affecting me. I always had an issue and felt annoyed that my parents (mainly my mom) were like this, but it actually began taking a toll on my mental health, which was likely due to the fact that I already felt upset about many situations and other events prior to this. 

I spoke about singers I enjoy, they replied vaguely before switching the topic or interrupting with something else that is a conversation between the two of them. I invited them to come watch me dance, they ignored it and claimed to be too busy even when I knew they were both laying on the couch watching TV. I show them a drawing I made, again, they reply vaguely with small words of admiration before switching the topic. Even when I ask my mom a personal or random thing like ""If you could have the abilities of any vocalist who would it be?"" she'd answer and when I go to do the same, she'd listen before finding a way to twist the conversation into religion. 

I have no problem with religion, but I'm partly an atheist and my mom constantly bringing up these conversations annoys me. Anytime I try to have a casual conversation with her, she always finds a way to involve religion and give me a lecture, then when I go to do something similar and knock some common sense into her when she's complaining about whatever and whatnot, she tells me ""I'm just trying to have a casual conversation with you, why do you always have to be so realistic with everything?"" 

My dad and I don't talk very often, but I would actually say he probably hears me out a bit more than my mom because my mom is extremely religious, so I have to watch what I say around her. My dad enjoys watching horror games and movies, and so do I, so I can talk with him a little more about my interest, though, due to the fact we rarely interact throughout the day, I technically never can. I'm also less close or bonded with my dad. 

I can't help but feel like I'm in the wrong when it comes to this, I know my parents genuinely care about me, but I feel like I'm not heard, nothing I say is processed. I can't even speak with my sister, who only has one day off and is technically speaking with my mom the entire time. Even whenever I do call her, the moment I show my mom on the screen, she begins speaking with her for half an hour before giving me the phone back. My talents, hobbies, favorites, all ignored and postponed. They sit at the table and eat dinner with me but talk about their own things or watch a video meanwhile I'm just sitting and eating the food that I probably prepared.

I'm the one who wakes up twice throughout the night to feed the cats, wakes up at 6 am to study, the one to prepare coffee, breakfast and dinner, takes care of in-home and business chores; I also take time to exercise, and draw and sometimes am the one to do the shopping. My parents are not lazy, they do things when it comes to gardening and other outdoor chores, but I really believe that asking for a bit of attention or interest when I speak of things I enjoy or other random topics is reasonable. I feel like I should feel listened to whenever I talk instead of feeling like I'm burdening them. I'm the only introvert in my family and I actually find it really difficult to speak to others; they want me to be more extroverted but how can I when everything I say by everyone I've met is discarded and ignored?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

  
TLDR: My entire family has a good relationship with one another; my sister and I are the closest. However, after she went to California, I can't help but feel affected by the way my parents chose to communicate with me. Anytime I try to spark up a conversation with them about my interest or anything really, they always ignore or give me small and vague responses. I feel as if I'm burdening them with every little word I say. My mom listens to me but quickly shows disinterest if the topic isn't attention grabbing for her, while my dad just completely ignores me since he's watching his phone and believes I'm speaking solely with my mom. Dinners are me sitting silently while they discuss work or watch videos; and the times I am speaking, again, the part of above comes in. I feel like I'm in the wrong because they're genuinely the best parents I could've asked for, I just wish they would make me feel heard and appreciated whenever I speak of the things I like or try to conversate with them.",1,1738935281.0,family,1,1.0,False

We gobble it up like Thanksgiving dinner. I've got some good drama for you all, but in this drama I'm unfortunately very involved. So, get some tea or coffee, sit down and enjoy this shitshow.

\[Disclaimer: English is not my first language, so if I make spelling/grammar mistakes and/or get sayings wrong, I'm sorry.\]

So let me set the mood first: I (31F) am/was together with my (ex)partner (32M) for over 6 years and two years ago we decided to do the registered partnership thing (which is like marriage). We've had our ups, but we've definitely had our downs. We started dating in 2018 and moved in together in 2019. Soon after us moving in, my partner started hearing things that I could not. Finally in 2021, he was diagnosed with tinnitus (after going to the GP multiple times over 2 years and being told it was nothing and it was just stress). The sounds would get louder and louder and soon he couldn't sleep anymore, couldn't work, started becoming very grumpy (which I totally understood and never blamed him for). It was a rough, rough time. It turned out it had something to do with the arteries going to his brain and the sound he heard was the heart pumping blood to his brain. Long story short, it was something they could fix with brain surgery, so he got the surgery and I really thought things would get better from there.

It did not. Since he was used to hearing his own heartbeat 24/7 for 2 years, when it suddenly stopped after the surgery, he started to develop a fear that his heart didn't work properly anymore and started to have panic attacks because of that. There were even instances where I had to call an ambulance because he was convinced he was having a heart attack. Eventually he started going to therapy to work through it and after a couple of years it definitely got better. At this point we were already together for about 4 years and to celebrate the ending of a very stressful period, we decided to become registered partners (I won't go into detail on why I don't want to get married, but basically to me registered partners felt more like equal partners than a marriage felt).

So we had a lovely, small ceremony with his parents and sibling (and partner) and my parents and sibling (and wife). During our whole relationship, he was working on his PhD and the more the finish line came into view, the more stressful his work became--which obviously put a strain on our relationship as well, but I really tried my best to support him in everything.

Last year, he got his PhD and is now finally a doctor! Even though we already had some trouble, I genuinely thought that us getting through all of that, would mean that we would stay together forever. I mean, if we could handle all that, we could handle everything. Right? Well, wrong. I think we've lived in 'survival mode' for so long, so the moment we didn't have to survive anymore and could actually enjoy life, we became more frustrated with small things the other person did. For the longest time, I've wondered if this was the life I wanted to live. We were right at the point where we would start to have children soon, but the closer we came to that point, the more I knew I didn't want to have children with him. I know that sounds so terrible, but it's true. He was in the prime of his life and career (even started a small business alongside his fulltime job) and I wondered if he would have the time to actually care for a kid or if I would become a ""single mother in a relationship"".

Well, last Christmas (qua Wham!-song) I made an advent calendar for him with 24 smaller, funny gifts and 2 pretty nice ones (going waaaay over budget (which is about €50), but that's something I always do as gift giving is something I LOVE! I never expect my present to be the same amount of money, care nor energy). The only thing I asked for my Christmas gift to be was a professional massage. My back sometimes hurts and I just wanted a deep tissue massage and to get pampered. I even checked Groupon and Social Deal and all that and a 1 hour massage would be around €30. Easy, right? Well, wrong again!

One or two weeks before Christmas, he asked me if I would be okay with making the massage a couples massage, because he liked one too and it would be a sort of date night thing. Sounds great!

A couple of days before Christmas, he told me he wasn't going to give me a Christmas present, because my birthday gift (my birthday is in January) was more expensive than he anticipated and he wanted to put the Christmas gift money towards that. I was a little disappointed, but I agreed. So, instead he bought me some smaller gifts so I wouldn't have zero gifts on Christmas: a pocket printer and a 3D printing pen (two things I LOVED!). Want to hear the real kicker? Both presents were about €30 each. Yeah... Anywaaaaay. Let's continue, because it gets worse. So get another cup and let's talk about to my surprise birthday getaway.

My birthday rolled around and my (soon to be ex) partner told me he was taking me to a surprise birthday getaway. We had a little fight over the days of the getaway: every year, I take either the week before or the week after my birthday off, depending on what works best. This year (my birthday was on a Sunday), I took  the week after my birthday off, and I communicated that to him as well as I had important projects and meetings the week before. You guessed it: he planned the getaway the week before my birthday. I managed to shuffle some things around and actually make it work, but I was kind of already done with the whole surprise. So was that the nail in the coffin regarding our marriage? Nope, not really. Patience, young Padawan, I'll get to that!

I'm not great with surprises (I mean to getting surprised, love to surprise others. I know; the irony/hypocrisy) as I like to be prepared and know what to expect, so he told me he would take me and our dog to the beach. I did not like that. I know it's super ungrateful and his surprise sounds so lovely, but let me explain why I was not amused. Two years ago (just after I had gastric bypass surgery), we adopted a 10-year-old dog from the shelter and she was honestly the love of my life (she was my first pet ever and she was so special and I miss her every day) because I needed to adopt a more active lifestyle and a dog was my way to achieve that. Unfortunately, she passed away last July, after turning 11 because of a tumor in het jaw that couldn't be removed. One of the things my (ex) partner regretted was never taking her to the beach and letting her roam free. We actually had a little beach trip planned, but she died before we could go.

Since my gastric bypass, my body has a very hard time generating heat. I'm always--ALWAYS--cold. I sometimes get so cold, no amount of clothes will warm me up and the only thing that helps is (what my (ex)partner called) ""a shower from hell"": a shower so hot it's like being in the depths of hell. So a getaway to the beach in the winter where the temperature is around freezing point (like -5°C to like 5°C) did not sound fun to me. That's why the getaway felt more like a bucket list-thing for him, than something for **my** birthday. He kept asking if I was excited about my birthday. I lied and said yes, but he kept on asking, so I came clean and told him I wasn't really and explained why. We got into a fight.

So, on the day we had to leave for the getaway, we were like chaotic chickens running around, trying to make everything happen because we procrastinated and had to do everything last minute. We had to take the cats to the cat hotel, pack our suitcases and pack the stuff for the dog. Did I already mention it was chaos? Well, it was. So we went on our way and a couple of hours later checked in at a cute, little, picturesque vacation cottage. It was during the unloading of our suitcase, I found out I forgot to pack my own clothes. I only got a pyjama, some thermo clothes for underneath and the clothes I was wearing at that moment. There was a washing machine in the cottage, so I could wash my clothes daily, but I just wanted some extra clothes. So the next day (this is 2 days before my birthday), we went to a couple of thrift stores, but in my perception, he was sighing and groaning the whole time, so I told him we could go back to the cottage and I would make another thrift store run the next day. Alone.

And that, ladies, gentleman and everyone in between is where. it. all. went. wrong. I told him I forgot to pack my clothes because I was too chaotically packing the pet's stuff and helping him pack his clothes and I would really like a spare set of clothing. He kept telling me that he packed his own stuff and he was helping with the pets as well and that it wasn't his fault that I forgot my own clothes--which I agreed to. I never said or implied it was his fault and I told him as much, but he kept on saying how he packed his stuff and bla bla bla. And I lost it. I just absolutely, utterly, fully, completely lost it. I started shouting ""IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU! IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU! IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU!"" over and over and over again, like a stadium full of Uruk-Hai from The Lord of the Rings chanting. My chanting was soon followed by hysterical laughing and crying; all my emotions of the last weeks (maybe even years) finally exiting my body.

When I finally calmed down, we had a very good, deep conversation and I told him I wanted a divorce (which was a blow to his face as he did not see that coming and I understand that). 2 days later, on my birthday, we decided to actually get a divorce, but try and remain friends. And I'd like that, because I think for the last couple of years, we've been friends living together instead of actually being in a romantic relationship. But we'll see how things go. For now I'm just glad we're navigating through this divorce very amicably.

*…and that, kids, is how I divorced your father.*

1ijuv05,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ijuv05/ec685_encore_esp_400/,EC685+ Encore ESP [€400]?,"Hi,

so finally my old cheap espresso machine broke down, so it's time to upgrade. I don't really want to spend arm and leg on a new setup, but I would definitely like to upgrade my espresso experience.  
I am not really interested with anything milk wise, what I like is simply strong espresso. Furthermore, I like bitter and strong taste of it, I don't have anything against acid ones, but wouldn't drink it every day. I have tried those lighter ones, and they might have more subtle flavors, but still, I prefer when it has a strong kick and taste. I have tried several different coffee types and usually dark roast is what I like more, robusta or mixed with arabica. Usually I am making 1-2 cups per day.

So EC685 with ESP should cost me around 350€. 685 looks fairly simple, meaning less things that can break down?

  
Without going much more above that price range (I mean, I could strech it but question is, how noticable would it be if I went 100-200€ above), should I change either of it for something else that would be better? From what I read Encore ESP should be quite good for its price, EC685 is kinda 'basic' when it comes to several times more expensive products, but I am not sure how much am I missing if I invest maybe a bit more, or will I be actually able to tell much difference? Tbh I am not all that picky person or coffee gourmand.

I also saw something like Ninja Luxe Essential is great for basically the same price, but I have to order it online, then warranty or repairs would be quite problematic if anything happens, and since it's still kinda 'new' not sure how is it longevity wise, therfore I don't feel like risking it.

**Chapter 16. Spirit of Darkness**

  
""What are you even supposed to do with the knife?"" Lily said, picking up the blade and turning it over and back.

""You are supposed to prick yourself with the knife and see if the blood that oozes is green,"" Lenora said.

""What kind of backwards test is that?"" Smokewell said.

""You see, since those that are bewitched are infected by the spirit of darkness, it affects their blood and gives it a darker tinge than the pure blood,"" she said.

Smokewell rolled her eyes. She was probably getting tired of listening to the term 'spirit of darkness' being repeated over and over.

""There is one more thing,"" Lenora said. ""When the spirit of darkness sucks on mortal blood, it covers up the teeth marks with some kind of enchantment. That enchantment comes undone when you use the soap that was also provided by the Internal police.""

""That's not how enchantment works,"" Asmod said in a voice that was tight with restrained annoyance.

I held back a groan and rubbed my forehead. ""So you are using a soap other than the one you originally used?"" I asked.

Lenora nodded. ""That's why the teeth marks on my arm got revealed when I started using that soap. Because the enchantment came undone.""

""That's it, I'm fed up with this."" Smokewell hopped upon my shoulder to get face to face with Lenora. ""It's about time we got something out of the way. Woman, you aren't cursed.""

The woman's face was skeptical.

""Don't give me that look,"" Smokewell said. ""You know you aren't.""

""How would you explain my neighbor dying from my wish of her death?"" Lenora crossed her arms.

""You said that lady was old. She sounds quite old since she had a lot of time to gossip and spread rumors about others,"" I said, ""It's very possible that the woman's heart gave out or she had a stroke. You just happened to be at the wrong place, thinking the wrong thing.""

""What about these teeth marks?"" She lifted her sleeve to show the spots on her skin.

""You just said you were using a new soap. And it's issued by the government. We don't know what they made it with in order to make it capable of 'detecting the bad blood'. Your skin is just showing a reaction because the soap probably isn't made with good materials,"" Smokewell said.

""And let's not forget the fact that we are still alive even when we are in your vicinity,"" Lily said.

""I haven't wished death upon any of you,"" Lenora said, her voice uncertain.

""Why don't you do it now?"" Asmod stepped forward. ""I'll volunteer to get cursed. Go on, do it.""

Lenora shook her head, bewildered. ""No! I won't risk it.""

""How about this, if you do manage to put a curse on Asmod, we won't blame you,"" Smokewell said.

""Do it,"" Asmod said again.

Lenora looked torn. I could see a glimmer of hope in her eyes but also fear of actually being someone who could curse someone to death.

""Do it,"" Lily said. Smokewell repeated it. And so did I.

""Alright then,"" Lenora said. ""I'll do it."" She turned to Asmod and with an uncertain look she clenched her eyes shut and muttered something under her breath. We all watched her as she went about coming up with a curse in her mind. A minute or two passed. Lenora opened her eyes.

Nothing happened.

""See?"" Asmod said.

""No..."" the woman took a step back. ""It's probably because I don't hate you as much as I hated my neighbor.""

""Lenora, stop."" I took a step forward. ""Just accept that you are perfectly normal. And maybe...it's something else that scared you. Something else that brought you to that clock tower. Something else that made you want to jump and end it all for good.""

""Maybe it was someone who was going to prick you with a knife to see whether you deserved to live as his wife."" Lily shrugged, poking the tip of the stiletto blade with her finger.

""That's a thought worth considering,"" Asmod said.

""I think our work here is done,"" I said and took the knife from Lily and put it back in its box. Then I took Clyde's diary and held it under my arm. ""If you don't mind, we'd like to borrow these for a bit.""

""Later then,"" Smokewell said as my companions and I turned to leave.

**\_\_**

Back in Asmod's apartment, we were in the sitting room. Lily was lounging on the sofa with her feet over the armrest. Smokewell was in her usual window. Asmod was down in the shop. I sat cross-legged by the coffee table and perusing Old Elsa's journal.

""What exactly are we going to do about Hopper?"" Lily said. The stiletto knife was in her hand, her finger kept poking at its tip.

""That's what I'm trying to figure out,"" I said as I flipped through the pages.

The girl groaned and turned to the cat in the window. ""Madam, why is the government doing this? Are they really this scared of us?"" she said.

""No, Lily,"" Smokewell said, gazing out the window. ""They aren't just scared of us. They are scared of anyone they can't control. Truth be told, in their situation it does make sense.""

""But...does it?"" Lily sat up on the sofa. ""I mean, when was the last time some coven did something truly terrible? Or even a magic user who did something terrible and didn't sign the agreement?""

""You don't actually have to do it, you know?"" the cat said. ""The fact that you are capable is what worries the government. Law is fragile like that. Everyone needs to agree upon it and follow it in order for it to mean something. The funny thing is, it doesn't mean anything even after you do all that. There's always going to be someone who breaks the law and defies it in a multitude of ways.""

""I guess that's true,"" Lily said. ""You know, Miss Elsa, before the Inquisition formed the witch hunter division, there was the news of this one man trying to blow up the temple of the Steam Elemental.""

""Did he succeed?"" I said, keeping my eyes on the page.

""He did!"" Lily said excitedly. ""I only heard rumors of it, but they say the explosion was glorious. Some speculate he was a fire mage. I think he must be a warlock. They are mighty nimble, aren't they?""

""That's one rumor I can actually believe,"" Smokewell said. ""And even that's because of the current state of the law and order regarding magic.""

Lily collapsed back on the couch. ""I miss the days before the Steam Elemental shook hands with the non-users. We could just walk around with our pointy hats and no one would say anything. Well, some were still uncomfortable around us but at least we didn't have to constantly live in the fear of the Inquisition.""

That caught my attention. I kept my face nonchalant. If the world was like that before the steam elemental then why did I remember Old Elsa being jumpy and always cautious. Was it for some other reason?

""I wish you could've experienced it, Miss Elsa,"" Lily said, turning to face me with a gentle smile. ""You are always so cautious and careful. And that was true even before the witch hunters made the burn list.""

I pursed my lips. ""It's okay, Lily. Sometimes life is a bit unfair.""

""I guess it is. Don't worry, though."" She propped herself on an elbow. ""It's only until we are done with this man, Hopper. After that, you and I and Madam and even Asmod, we'll all party at the Volcano lane.""

I raised an eyebrow. ""What's that?""

""It's a street in the neighboring city. The entire stretch of the road is nothing but barbecued meat restaurants and that's not even the best part. All the restaurants are run by drakes!""

""I wonder if they've signed the agreement,"" I said.

""Probably not,"" Smokwell said, ""I'm sure they are an establishment similar to that run by the liches.""

""It's called Skeleton Crew, madam. And you need to admit that it was the best place you've seen since you turned into a cat,"" Lily said.

""That's it,"" I said, closing the journal. ""I think it's about time we dug up something substantial on Hopper."" I went over suitcase to get my ritual knife and Clyde's diary.

""What are you going to do, Miss Elsa?"" Lily said.

""You can come along if you want,"" I said.

Smokewell came along with Lily. I led her down to Asmod's shop and made him open the secret door to his workshop for us.

I came back to the empty spot when I'd carried out the Liberation ritual on Amelia's mirror. I drew a pattern on the ground and placed Clyde's diary at its center.

Lily watched with equal parts curiosity and excitement. ""This is the same ritual that you summoned that giant man with, right?"" she asked.

I nodded.

""Hm, I'd been wondering where you learnt to do that,"" Smokewell said.

""In one of the books of Dark Arcana,"" I said, and it wasn't really a lie. When I'd accessed more memories about the Liberation ritual, Dark Arcana was the book that Old Elsa had referred to.

""So, how does it work?"" Lily asked.

I explained the basics to them as I wiped the grit off my knife and prepared to slit my palm.

""Wait, if you could extract information like that, then why didn't you use the ritual on Clyde while he was still unconscious?"" Lily asked.

""No,"" I said, ""An abyss can either be extracted from the mortal remains of a person or their belongings. Clyde's body and soul are still fused together. I can't extract his abyss from his body while he is still alive.""

Lily nodded. I finally cut my palm and dripped the blood onto the pentacle. The air around us turned cold. There was a whisper as the black mist whirled in front of me. I wasn't surprised as the mist remained shapeless and didn't take any solid form.

""Identity yourself,"" I commanded.

*""Clyde Desmond,""* the voice said. It sounded much firmer than the previous abysses I'd extracted. But that tone of servitude was still there.

""I don't have much time so I'll keep this short,"" I said, ""Tell me whatever you know about General Lloyd Hopper. Other than the fact that he likes his tea with a dash of lemon.""

The voice was quiet for some time. I could feel Lily and Smokewell’s uncertain gazes burning holes into my back. ""Answer me!"" I said sternly.

*""My recollection is rather weak...but I remember the general as a man of...little courage.""*

I raised an eyebrow. ""What is that supposed to mean? Elaborate.""

*""I've fed a lot of officers of various ranks. But if I had to compare General Hopper to the previous one in his position, I would say Hopper is the first man in uniform who seems genuinely afraid of witchcraft. It makes him anxious.""*

I scoffed. ""Is there anything else you can tell me about him?"" I asked.

*""I'm afraid not,""* the voice said after a brief pause.

""Then we are done here. Go away now. I liberate you,""

*""Thank you...""*

The mist disappeared. The coldness was gone.

""So the General is scared of us,"" Lily said.

""I'm not surprised,"" Smokwell said.

I turned to the two of them with a grin. I couldn't help but feel smug, ""This is it then,"" I said. ""If the general is really that afraid of witchcraft. Then we will put a stronger fear in him. Tonight, we'll commence my plan.""

1ijuttr,https://www.reddit.com/r/dairyfree/comments/1ijuttr/potential_dairy_allergy_causing_pain_and/,Potential dairy allergy causing pain and infertility?,"Hi, so I’ve known for a long time that dairy makes me feel not great. I do NOT get typical digestive side effects from it, at most just a little bloated from straight-up milk. No rashes or hives. Dairy primarily seems to affect my female reproductive organs via inflammation. I’ve been hesitant to see an allergist because I feel like I sound crazy. I was wondering if there was anybody else out there who experienced something similar?

I’ve cycled between cutting out dairy, in addition to practically existing on it during several long term keto/low carb diet stints over the years. I keep a daily food diary (and have for 10+ years). And at my peak of reproductive pain, I was eating dairy at every meal of the day (milk in coffee at breakfast, eggs with cheese, cottage cheese, yogurt, and snacking on cheese). It got so bad that I actually visited my OBGYN 2 times in 6 months for debilitating pain and irregular bleeding, to the point of thinking I had uterine cancer. They told me it was just age-related changes (I was 32?)

I have 2 children, both conceived while being mostly dairy free (just small amounts of butter). And then I had 3 miscarriages in the 5 years after my last child, all while eating dairy. This is all just clicking for me, fyi. 

So I began seeing an infertility specialist to determine why I was miscarrying. The month I began my “diagnostic testing”, I decided to begin including a2 milk in my diet as well. For nutrition (facepalm!). All my prior dairy-Inclusion attempts have been with A1. I thought I’d give it a try with a2. I did a ladder approach. Started at 1oz, worked my way up to 5-6oz once per day. Halfway through the month, my uterine pain got so intense I had to stop, it felt like I was going to burst. I couldn’t take it anymore. Note, I did not have ANY pain in the cycles before…milk free. 

During this time I also had a uterine biopsy, which revealed Chronic Endometritis. Note, that’s different than endometriosis. Chronic Endometritis is basically inflammation of the uterine lining, NOT from an infection like an STD (that’s acute, not chronic). The uterine lining inflammation causes implantation failure/infertility. Or, incorrect implantation/miscarriages. 

Well, I could’ve told you it was inflamed without the biopsy...and the pain completely subsided within a few days after stopping dairy, and things went back to normal for me. I was prescribed antibiotics to help the inflammation. 

Well. I conceived during the second half of that cycle, and I’m still PREGNANT! So I’ve stopped my experiments for now. 

My fertility specialist laughed when I told him this info (he’s otherwise wonderful). 
My question for you is… if I went to an allergist with this information, would it be a total waste of time and a copay, or do you think it’d be beneficial? In my own doctor experiences, it seems like most doctors don’t think very critically anymore, and if you don’t fit “the box” they just push you on to a different doctor, and it gets nowhere. Basically a lot of time and money for the diagnosis of  “oh that’s interesting and sucks, come back if you die!” Lol

I feel pretty dismissed by my fertility specialist, but I get that’s not his area necessarily. I’ve never seen an allergist. AI tells me it could be a reaction to the hormones in milk (we think of milk as a common food, but milk really is full of hormones! so maybe that’s it..) idk. I just feel lost. It’s easy to say just don’t have it…I could live without milk, but I love cheeses and butter and really don’t want to go without it unless it’s absolutely necessary. You guys know the feeling, I’m sure. 

I'm avoiding dairy like the plague for the duration of this pregnancy. But afterwards, what do you think an allergist would do in my situation? Do you think it would be worthwhile or a waste of time, since I don’t have any notable digestive/typical allergy side effects?

I am writing this trading diary so that my child can read it and learn from it when I am gone, and hopefully abide by the same principles and earn income from trading. I hope others will find it useful in their trading education as well.

I am an options trader at heart, but I love trading small cap stocks because of their similarities to options. I have formal finance and economics education from a top US college, and was nearly FIRE until we got our newborn, which is when I got back to trading after a long career in finance. Some of my DD has been picked up by Yahoo Finance like my [BIOA](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bioage-labs-inc-bioa-bull-141831408.html) and [RGTI](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rigetti-computing-inc-rgti-bear-132241648.html) articles, and I used to write about stocks on Seeking Alpha.

I scan weekly for stocks which are being accumulated for whatever reason, and I post them on [r/pennystocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/) and [r/shortsqueeze](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortsqueeze/), and I write about 1-2 DDs a month, which I post on [r/valueinvesting](https://www.reddit.com/r/valueinvesting/), [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/), or [r/pennystocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/), as appropriate.

My goal is to code all my strategies and eventually trade them automatically, because no one in my family is versed in finance and trading. I am well underway on my accumulation scanner algo, and the rest are proving a bit harder to code, but eventually I hope to automate my uncorrelated strategies which include accumulation momentum trades, short selling unwarranted runups, and small cap growth and deep value trades.

I’m a non-EU student thrilled to have received an offer for the MSc in Business Analytics at UofB, starting this fall! Before I officially accept, I'd love your honest advice on a couple of things:

1. Accommodation Hunt:
I’m starting to look at accommodation, and I'm feeling a bit lost with all the options! I'm mainly considering university-managed halls.

Priorities: Affordability (non-EU fees, yikes! 😅), proximity to campus, and an en-suite would be amazing if the budget allows.

Basically, I'm looking for the best balance of comfort, convenience, and price. Any insider tips on halls to check out (or avoid)?

2. MSc Business Analytics – Course + Jobs

I'm really keen to hear from current or recent grads of the MSc Business Analytics program:

- What's the course structure really like? Is it more theoretical, or hands-on with tools like Python or AI related?
- Are there opportunities for industry projects/placements built into the program?
- What are the job prospects like for non-EU grads in the UK/EU? Is the market super competitive?
Basically, is the MSc setting people up for success after graduation?

Why I’m Nervous (But Excited!)

Moving to Birmingham is a big leap! Any honest opinions on:
- The vibe of Birmingham for international students? Easy to settle in?
- Tips for navigating the visa/immigration stuff as a non-EU student?

Huge thanks in advance – your advice would be amazing! 🙏 Feeling excited (and a little terrified) to potentially join the UofB community.

P.S. If you're in the Business Analytics program or have lived in UofB halls, feel free to DM me! I owe you a coffee ☕ (or a pint 🍻).

I woke up in my tent in some tall grass near a retention pond. I didn't see any equipment when I got there the night before. It looked pretty new. Some pipes laying around. No jobsite office. 

I hear some heavy equipment outside. Out of the tent. Back facing equipment. Pee. Back in tent. Smoke. Gear packed and out of tent. Me out. Tent dropped. 'These guys don't give one fuck that I'm here.' I was quite a ways out of their way. A work truck rolls by in the distance.  Never makes a move to come my way. I spy a gas station across the street. Make my way around the pond and over to the gas station.

Coffee. Back outside. I pull my stool of my pack. Check phone. 'Message one minute ago...' ""About an hour."" ""I'll be out front."" Stool back on pack. Gear up. Coffee in hand. Over to walmart.

Gear down. Stool off pack. Sit down and enjoy a couple smokes and my coffee. 'Better hit the bathroom.' Gear up. Bathroom. Text, 'Outside where?' 'Walmart. Had to use the bathroom. On my way out.' Outside.

Out to curb in front of walmart. Stand there for a minute or two. See dude drive up. Nods exchanged. He turns down a lane in the parking lot. I follow. Gear in car. Me in car.

An hour or so of driving to an errand he's got to run. Lots of stories between us. Head for his house. More stories. Stop so I can grab smokes. He grabs a can of coffee. Head out. In the country. End of a dirt road. 'Perfect.' Get the tour. He's gotta go knock a job out in a little while. We sit around shooting the shit before he goes. 

I've got some laundry going already. I haven't had a shower in I don't know how long at this point. (Due to limited shore access I wasn't able to get another five gallon bucket to get my shower going again on the boat while I was there. I used all my buckets to keep my pack out of the water in my flooded dinghy when I paddled to shore a couple months ago.) He leaves. I head to the room I'm staying in. 

A lot of screwing around on my phone. Watching movies. A couple smoke breaks. I pass out. Wake up an hour later. Laundry continued. Done. Immediately in the shower. 'So nice! Finally clean! I feel like a new man.' I grab my sleeping bag and blanket out of the dryer. Back to room.

Kick another movie on.  Get in sleeping bag. Out.

I wake up with the sun this morning. Groggy as usual. I'm not really the jump out of bed immediately type. I was for decades, especially when I've had a job on the books. I hear some shuffling around in the house. I'm not moving too quick. I figure I'll stay out of everybody's way while they're getting ready and heading out. There'll be plenty of time to meet anybody I haven't met yet later.

I drag myself out of bed. Outside for a smoke. Time to see if there's enough bottled water to make some coffee...",10,1738934283.0,vagabond,1,0.92,False

1ijuq9p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wattpad/comments/1ijuq9p/i_thought_you_would_cry/,I thought you would cry,"Aiden ended our engagement because he felt I wasn't doing what was expected of me. He was about to sign a big contract with a famous soccer team and the wives of the other players started badmouthing me, saying I was provoking and insulting them.

He came home one day and ended our engagement and I accepted it without arguing. He was outraged by my attitude. What did he expect me to say?


Chapter 4 (draft)

""No,"" I said, wiping my face. This didn't feel right. Tears weren't going to help; crying wouldn't bring me any answers. Calling Aiden didn't seem like the right thing to do. 

""I'm sorry,"" I said, feeling strangely light-headed. Was I really in shock? Maybe not a medical shock exactly... but a shock nonetheless. 

I was shocked that the man who used to massage my feet whenever I wanted had said he didn't want me anymore. I was shocked because I thought I was indispensable. I believed my cooking kept him warm inside, that my love helped him train better, and that my texts throughout the day were something he looked forward to. 

Maybe that was it—I was shocked that I could be replaced so quickly, that my love wasn't enough, and that my preference for homemade coffee was seen as not trying hard enough.

Aiden didn't seem to consider that I wanted only him. Not his rich friends, his million-dollar contract, his important connections, or his beautifully sculpted body. I wanted him—however he came to me—because I had met him when he was just a 17-year-old boy struggling to do a math problem. 

When I showed him the correct way to use a certain formula, he looked at me with his green eyes, the color of a forest after rain, and smiled. He was a sought-after kid; what jock at school wouldn't be? But he was kind to everyone, smiled at the less popular kids, and defended those who were bullied. 

He smiled at me that first day; he kissed me for the first time after school that same day, and it was my name he said when he entered me for the first time when we were both 18. I remember it very clearly. He didn't know exactly what to do or how to do it, but in the end, it worked. Did it hurt? A little. But it felt good. The second time? Better yet. The 850th time? Wow.

But now? Was I shocked? Perhaps. Maybe he was right when he said I hadn't reacted as he expected. It would have made sense if I had thrown a vase at his head; that might have even been the right thing to do. But I didn't feel like doing that yesterday.

1ijunud,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1ijunud/braun_kf6050wh_brewsense_drip_coffee_maker_review/,"Braun KF6050WH BrewSense Drip Coffee Maker Review: The Good, The Bad, and the Coffee","Testing the Braun KF6050WH BrewSense Drip Coffee Maker on a daily basis has been quite an adventure in the world of caffeinated indulgence. As someone who considers mornings incomplete without a steaming cup of coffee, this machine quickly found a special place on my kitchen counter. The promise of Braun's ""pure flavor technology"" intrigued me, and I was eager to see if it could live up to the hype. Spoiler alert: it did, but not without a few hiccups.

**Design & Build Quality**

From the very first glance, the Braun KF6050WH BrewSense Drip Coffee Maker stands out with its sleek stainless steel and white finish. Its compact design is a blessing for smaller kitchens, though its height might make it a bit tricky to fit under low-hanging cabinets. The premium display with LED indicators and easy-to-read buttons adds an air of sophistication, but I have to admit that the clock's lack of backlighting was a letdown. Trying to read the clock in dim light was like squinting at hieroglyphs—futile.

The glass FlavorCarafe is a game-changer, sealing in the coffee's freshness and aroma. It’s durable and easy to handle, though the lid occasionally decides to pop off at the most inconvenient moments. The reusable gold-tone filter is a thoughtful touch, enhancing the flavor by allowing essential oils to pass through. However, cleaning the filter can sometimes feel like a mini wrestling match with coffee grounds.

[Check Braun KF6050WH BrewSense Drip Coffee Maker price on Amazon here.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/braun-kf6050wh-coffee-maker-review-b07cpjf2bg/)

**Brewing Performance**

This coffee maker shines in the brewing department. The pure flavor system ensures the water temperature and brewing time are just right, delivering a robust and consistent flavor. Whether I brewed a full 12 cups for a family brunch or just 4 cups for a quiet morning, the results were equally impressive. The brewing speed is neither too fast nor too slow—it hits the sweet spot.

One feature I love is the brew pause system. It allows me to sneak a cup mid-cycle without creating a coffee crime scene on the counter. The 24-hour programmable timer is another win, ensuring I wake up to the tantalizing aroma of freshly brewed coffee. However, the absence of a notification sound when brewing is complete feels like a missed opportunity. A simple beep would have been nice.

**Coffee Flavor**

Let’s talk about the most crucial aspect: the coffee itself. The Braun KF6050WH BrewSense does not disappoint. The coffee it brews is rich, smooth, and full-bodied. I experimented with different grind sizes and coffee-to-water ratios, and the machine handled them all like a pro. The charcoal filter plays a significant role in enhancing the flavor by purifying the water. However, if you’re someone who enjoys a piping hot cup, this machine delivers but may not boil the coffee to tongue-scalding temperatures.

**Cleaning & Maintenance**

Cleaning is usually the part where I start to lose patience, but Braun made it relatively straightforward. The removable parts, including the carafe and filter basket, are easy to clean, though the gold-tone filter can be a bit of a mess-maker if not handled carefully. The machine even has a built-in cleaning indicator that lights up when it’s time to descale. It’s a handy feature for someone like me, who often forgets this critical step.

**Pros**

1. Sleek design with a compact footprint that fits well in most kitchens.
2. Consistently brews rich and flavorful coffee.
3. Programmable timer and brew pause feature for convenience.
4. Reusable gold-tone filter enhances flavor and reduces waste.
5. Easy-to-clean components with a descaling reminder.

**Cons**

1. Clock display lacks backlighting, making it hard to read.
2. No audible alert when brewing is complete.
3. Lid on the carafe can be a bit flimsy and prone to popping off.
4. Cleaning the gold-tone filter can get messy.
5. Cord length is shorter than expected, limiting placement options.

**Comparison to Competitors**

When pitted against other drip coffee makers in its price range, the Braun KF6050WH BrewSense holds its ground admirably. For instance, compared to the Cuisinart DCC-3200, Braun's machine excels in flavor extraction and design aesthetics. However, the Cuisinart offers a hotter brew and a backlit display, which some users might prefer. On the other hand, the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew provides versatility with its single-serve and full-pot options, but it lacks the sleek design and pure flavor technology of the Braun.

Where Braun outshines many competitors is in its reusable gold-tone filter and the inclusion of a charcoal water filter. These features not only enhance the coffee's taste but also reduce the reliance on disposable filters, making it an eco-friendlier choice.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

While the Braun KF6050WH BrewSense isn’t the cheapest option on the market, it offers excellent value for its price. The combination of design, brewing performance, and coffee quality makes it worth the investment. If you’re someone who values a perfect cup of coffee and appreciates thoughtful design, this machine won’t disappoint. That said, if you’re on a tight budget, you might find similar performance in less expensive models, albeit without the premium features.

Overall, the Braun KF6050WH BrewSense Drip Coffee Maker is a solid choice for coffee lovers who appreciate quality and convenience. It’s not without its quirks, but the pros far outweigh the cons. Whether you’re a coffee enthusiast or just someone who needs a reliable morning pick-me-up, this machine is a worthy contender.

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a new bestie to join me on this journey called life. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.

I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

This isn't for everyone but ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the f*ck out of each other. Someone to get excited to check your phone for.


I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. I will probably p*ss you off.

Some stuff about me so you know I'm not a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself.
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play games. Currently playing POE2 but was obsessed with Satisfsctory the past two months. You'll usually find me AFKing on OSRS.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

Context: in 2023 I got a new job and met my then-colleague, now friend Alex [now 26M]. Back then I was in a relationship with my ex John [now 23M] for three years.

John and started dating when we were both 19, we were each other's first everything. Everything was great for a while until the beginning of 2023 when I felt John started to take me for granted. He dismissed my feelings a lot, wouldn't go on dates but would constantly spend time with his friends, etc. I tried talking to him about it but he would say and promise a lot of things and never follow up on anything. 

Later I got a new job and met Alex. He was treating me like a gentleman from the beginning but never overstepped any boudaries since he knew I was in a relationship. But I noticed how neglected I felt by John because even taking me out and paying for a coffee was too much for him, but not for Alex. In October 2024 I finally broke it off because John started acting worse and worse towards me as time went on and I've moved on pretty quickly.

Ever since then, I've developed a crush on my friend Alex. Nothing happened between us but I don't know how to proceed. I really enjoy his company, he helped me through my breakup, but it's been less than 4 months since I broke off my almost 4 year long relationship. 

I don't know if he's showing any signs that he's interested since we've been friends for over a year and it's hard to tell, but even if he is... it's been barely 4 months since I broke off a 4 year long relationship. I don't know if I'm ready for a new one but I also don't want to wait too long. I want to tell him how I feel but I also don't want to ruin our friendship.

My husband and I had a daughter 4 years ago. I also have a 16 yr old stepdaughter who lives with us 60% of the time. The remaining time she’s with bio mom and her stepdad. We all live together with MIL in a shared duplex and equally split the costs other than groceries. My husband and I go grocery shopping and buy food every week to make meals for dinner. Not sure how often MIL shops  but when she does she’s getting her own stuff. 

MIL was fine at first but once I had my daughter and was postpartum I really started hating MIL. She would tell me I was holding my daughter too much and make comments toward her that I didn’t like. For instance, baby would cry and MIL would be like ‘you just ate! What do you think you are, a princess?’ And it would really tick me off because although it was my first baby, I had done lots of reading and listening to other moms who’d had kids recently and felt I was making good decisions. My late grandmother paid for photography of my baby and when I gave MIL copies of the photos instead of saying something nice about her granddaughter she immediately goes into randomly talking about how one of her nieces takes the most beautiful photos of her daughter on her phone and they always look professional . What really set me over the edge during this time was when she told me she wished I would disappear so she could raise my daughter like her own, the way she did with my stepdaughter. This isn’t even true, no one in the family can confirm that she ‘raised’ my stepdaughter on her own. She very kindly helped out with childcare while my husband worked and bio mom worked. 

The next few years would be mildly annoying but nothing major, she would make comments to me here and there and it would always be when no one else was around. For example I was cooking one day and she walked up to me and asked me if I would be offended by a kitchen decor item she had bought. It read ‘Christ offers forgiveness for everyone everywhere, spelling out COFFEE.’ I said ‘why would you ask me that?’ Just laughing it off because I am Christian and she knows that, and she is catholic. So I thought it was weird. 

She also made a big deal about buying a rug and putting it in her bathroom claiming it drowns out the noise of her walker going across the floor and that she knew I had been complaining about the sound…. I hadn’t said a word about that at all. 

Then last summer she spent some time away getting a surgery and recovering. I spent the summer enjoying the peace and quiet, spending time with my kids, finally having a better opportunity to get closer with my step daughter, which my stepdaughter was happy about too because she posted about it on her social media that she was happy we got closer last year. Come August MIL came home and we all went on a vacation together to the beach. When we got home things resumed to normal, kids went back to school / daycare, my stepdaughter was in sports so games were happening all the time, I was taking classes at the college and my husband was dealing with chemotherapy so he spent a lot of time resting and I helped care for him and get him to appointments. 

It was during this time that MIL really started being ugly toward me but not in a direct manner. Stepdaughters bio mom dropped off her sports uniform and MIL answered the door and immediately started talking poorly about me AND my husband to her. Saying we ignore her and don’t do anything with her (mind you, this was just a few weeks after we’d went on our beach vacation together), that she doesn’t have a choice in what she eats for dinner. Let me just say, this woman is disabled but she has not lost the function or capability to prepare food. She can cook and eat whatever she wants, but if my husband and I get in the kitchen and cook a meal with food we bought she will happily eat it every single time. And she never says a word about not liking it, never suggests or asks if we will cook something specific. So after this ring camera incident my husband confronted her and she basically had an attitude saying she didn’t say anything that wasn’t true.. 

So things started to get awkward. Kitchen appliances that EVERYONE always used (think blender, mixer, air fryer, etc.), MIL started picking and choose who could use what and when. She would say that’s MY this or that’s YOUR that, and anytime any of my dishes would get clean from the dishwasher she would stack them at the end of the kitchen island and say she doesn’t know where I want to put them.. and I would say uh, where they always go? In the cabinet with the rest of the dishes??? It’s like she didn’t want our stuff to be anywhere near each other. I would overhear her talking crap about me to people on the phone, she would complain that my kids got showers and tell whoever on the line that one morning she had to wake up at 5:30 just to shower because the kids got in the shower the night before and how it was bullshit. Mind you, this woman doesn’t work or do anything for that matter besides go to appointments when she has them so it’s not like she was constrained on time. 

So after a few weeks of this my husband basically sat her down and told her that we would be moving and she wasn’t coming with us. She then let it all out how she is angry at me because she feels like I don’t have a right to my stepdaughter to take her to practice and school. Which I only do these things when my husband can’t , but I also like doing them and if I’m already getting out to drop my toddler to daycare I feel it’s easier for me to be the one to take my stepdaughter as well instead of someone else having to get out. Anyway she said she feels like because of me, she can’t spend time with stepdaughter. I just told her no one was stopping her. And after that talk she started going to stepdaughters soccer games, which previously she never went to. But she made it out to sound like no one wanted her there of course which was never the case, she just does nothing but sit at home and talk crap. 

anyway now I’m starting to pay extra attention to how MIL interacts with the kids because I’ve always heard if someone doesn’t like you, they are going to treat your kids some type of way. And boy is it noticeable. First MIL never asks to take my toddler anywhere with her nor does she make a big deal about spending time with her. But she will take my stepdaughter out to the store to shop and get her stuff or they will go pick up food together and never offer anything for my toddler. Secondly my toddler was playing in the living room and MIL made a big deal about it like it was a huge mess. All that was done was a small blanket was laid out and a few toys were lined up on the edges of the blanket. I said to MIL ‘I’m sure (stepdaughter) did the same thing when she was that age’ and MIL was just like ‘I don’t think so!’ With a crappy look on her face. Now she’s telling people that my kid is somehow evil because she’s only 4 and talks about dreams she has and MIL has never heard of a kid that young having dreams before.. and saying that my daughter also has acted like she’s seen stuff in the house that my MIL can’t see. 


TLDR: my mother in law increasingly over the years has begun to treat me poorly and I see the beginning of that same behavior directed toward my toddler now. . And I can’t wait to move and be free from her! 

Edit to add: my MIL’s disdain towards me is nonexistent on Facebook lol there she sings my praises! It’s all a show.  ",2,1738933176.0,motherinlawsfromhell,1,1.0,False

Incorporating regular standing and movement during your workday,using a standing desk topper,can mitigate these risks. It also enhances focus, boosts energy levels, and increases overall productivity.A desktop standing desk riser allows you to transform your existing desk into a more dynamic workstation without the commitment (or the cost) of purchasing an entire new standing desk. For many, especially those starting their journey toward a healthier workday, a laptop standing desk converter is the perfect entry point.

An adjustable height workstation, also known as a converter, provides the versatility to seamlessly transition between sitting and standing postures throughout your day.This combats the negative effects of prolonged sitting and creates a more active and engaging work environment. Essentially, adopting a standing desk extension is less about just standing and more about creating a more mobile and healthy workday. An ergonomic desk converter plays a critical role in this transition, bringing the monitor and keyboard to an optimal height that promotes good posture and reduces strain.

1ijua9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ijua9c/for_cancelling_plans_after_i_felt_she_was/,For cancelling plans after I felt she was uncomfortable around me.,"AITAH ? I'm (26M) an expat in a country where I haven't mastered the language yet (not English), and like speaking English with people when I get the chance. For context, I am big guy, 6ft tall, 93kg, bearded and balding and I imagine myself maybe a bit scary from afar at first, but I always try to remain friendly with people. I have been in a new city for a year, and have made male friends at work to enjoy the city with. At work, we get news that a new group of expats, English speaking (not from my origin country), is being added, guys and a woman, Jane (26F). Note that they were friends before traveling. Excited to meet them, I was friendly from the get go, smiling and trying to chat, offering my help if ever needed. I had not attempted dating in the new city yet and I considered Jane to be very cute, to the point where I was nervous around her. The new group and I had the chance to have lunch twice in restaurants close to work, during lunch breaks. After that, stupidly I admit, tried ask the group out to ice skating, as it was primetime for that. I say stupidly because I was apparently nervous at times, and the guys had refused. Jane proposed that I join them for beers at a bar, and I do. At the bar, we played some pool and got to know that Jane is in a relationship with another woman. I was disappointed yes, but I tried not to show any strong emotions towards that. Throughout these events we were chatting through text, she had some time off and we kept in touch. We had discussed at one time to get plants for our apartments together. When she was back from holiday, hoping that we could be friends, I proposed a plant store in the city to visit, in the morning, together. She countered with another, closer, plant market that was a small event at the time. We agreed to go at 10am, on a Sunday. That Sunday, an hour before our meeting, I had asked if she would like some coffee or breakfast as I was passing by a coffee shop to get myself a coffee. She asked which coffee shop I was passing by and I shared, she liked the place but did not answer the question regarding coffee. She informed that her guy friends were joining us, and I said the more the merrier, and to let them know to get some essentials for the market, and if they would like coffee too. She said no they can get their own coffee, and said she might meet me at the coffee shop too. I said ok np, and had agreed together that I would depart soon to the shop. Once I got there and had my coffee in hand, I asked if I should wait for her. She said no, and that she is late and going straight to the market, and didn't want me to get her coffee. Although I tried to be nonchalant about it, these events were clear to me that she felt uncomfortable, to say the least, around me. We finished the event in peace early morning, both I and Jane got a decent variety of plants while the other guys both got one 1$ cactus plants. She mentioned if the group was down to do something else, I said no and that I had to get the plants home. These events gutted me, and I overthinked about what went wrong, and what I might have done to make her feel this way around me. About how they see me. Finally, early on when we met, we also agreed to visiting a convention together more than a month later. A couple of days after the plant market, I sent her a text saying that my time for the convention is no longer clear, and that it's best we cancel. I also offered her the tickets for the days when we both knew I would not be in the city, and that she could use them freely and can invite a +1.  She replied saying that she hopes she isn't related to this cancellation, and that she would still like me to go to the event even without her. I reaffirmed that it's on me and that my weekend got disrupted but we both knew something was off. Things turned sour at work when crossing paths, no eye contact, and if necessary, a simple good morning.

Now I am no longer looking for any connection, and would like us to stay normal at work and don't want to cause any more discomfort. I am thinking of sending the below apology after the convention had passed. Your opinions would be much appreciated. 

""Gd morning, I hope you're doing well.
I would like to apologize and explain myself, after the plant market, I felt that I might have made you feel uncomfortable, and it was never my intention. I'm gutted to think that I might have, and have thought it best to keep my distance and cancel plans.
Thank you for taking the time to go out together. I do not wish to cause any more discomfort, and would please appreciate if we could stay amicable at work.""",48,1738932754.0,AITAH,11,1.0,False

1iju7ap,https://www.reddit.com/r/OriginalCharacterDB/comments/1iju7ap/announcement_war_grand_world_incursion/,Announcement: “WAR: Grand World Incursion!”,"Greetings everyone, I’m Niuriheim lol. I’m making this post because I’m working on (or rather redesigning) a Major Project called War Across Realms (aka W.A.R.). It is based on my original project of the same name with a sub-project called “[WAR: Underground](https://waracrossrealms.wordpress.com/2024/10/16/war-underground-grand-lords-of-war/)”. That said, this new project won’t include any other Verses other than my own and any indie projects that join (such as anyone here who joins). 

It’s intended to be a collective project where Verses can interact with each other through a controlled medium that possess specific systems and regulations to ensure a reasonable crossover interaction. 

Within WAR there will be multiple event series types, from Main Line Events, Faction Specific Events, Side Events, Matches, and potentially more in the future. Think of it like“WWE” meets “Record Of Ragnorak” meets “God of Highschool” (S1 of the anime). In this project, characters from different Verses will be able to come together via the Citadel of WAR, with interactions that can take place in multiple ways, from VS Matches (1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and up to 20v20), Battle Royals, Military Invasions, Simple Interactions (characters playing games, having coffee, etc), and almost anything else. But with the added benefit of there being a collective of minor to major connecting stories with a shonen/slice of life feel to it. 

Each entry will fall under certain category, and must be a collaborative effort. So for example, if I wanted to do an interaction with let’s say Arctic and Equivalent, I’d get with them and discuss the interaction, and if we all come to an agreement, we’d work together to write said event and submit it to be added to the official WAR Project. WAR will have several locations, systems, & characters that will be universally available within its projects, meaning if you wanted to include a certain WAR character (not referring to another member’s character), as long as they are categorized as universally available, then you won’t need to get with me about it. But if you wanted to include one of the Grand Lords of WAR who will be the characters that oversee the WAR Project story-wise, you’d have to get with that character’s owner. And any events intended to effect the entire Citadel would of course need to go through me to ensure it corresponds with all members. 

The “Grand Lords of WAR” are going to be the head council of the Citadel of WAR. There will be five Grand Lords, each one from a different Verse. In my original project, the Grand Lords were required to be characters who were Monarchs, Kings/Queens, with the first & second council being these characters: 

https://imgur.com/a/Gci58al

But for the Retconned WAR, I want each Grand Lord to be a God. As long as they are considered a God in their Verse, then that is well within requirements. For the first Grand Lord Council, I’m going to focus on the most powerful Verses in the sub. Positions will be Chairman, 2nd Seat, 3rd Seat, up to 5th Seat. And then above the Council there will be the “Grand Overseer of WAR”, who will be filled by someone from my Void Expanse, kind of like a Majority Shareholder & Primary Sponsor in a business. Then later down the line, Seats can be challenged for by other Verses/Characters, so if any of you wanted to hold a seat in the Grand Lord Council, you can challenge one of the seat members to an equal stats fight for the seat. I’ll announcement when these challenges can be made though. Which means active seat holders will need to maintain their strength & abilities since scale will not matter in these challenges. 

The first event of WAR will be focused on the initial encounter between the “to be” Grand Lords Verses. It’ll be a story that leads to the in-story creation of the Citadel of War. The event I have planned will be repurposed from something I wanted to do with the original WAR. And then was the event is pretty much solved, representatives of the five verses will create the Citadel of WAR, where upon then they’ll invite other Verses to join the Citadel. That’s when I’ll open the project to more creators to join. This first event will fall under the Main Line category, meaning it affects the entire WAR Project. 

I plan to eventually adapt most if not all of the Main Line Events into either Manga or Comic style adaptations as well, just as I was in the process of doing for the original WAR, in “[WAR: Underground - Grand Premier](https://imgur.com/a/2w2jrod)” (only had six pages done so far of a specific fight in PT2). Because I’ll be utilizing my own funds to carry this out, I’ll be personally vetting everyone who wishes to join. I want to avoid trolls & griefers as much as possible, and am only looking for those who take their creations seriously (doesn’t need to be like business professional or anything, just mature) but also who are chill enough to have fun with. I have my own trucking business going right now and soon to have my own Publishing App, so I’d like to avoid wasting money (on the adaptations and helping commission character art for those who can’t afford it) if those who join this project are just going to come and act like fools 24/7 you know.

This project will also be using its own tiering system as the mainstream tiering systems are lacking in many aspects. It is called the “[WAR Tiering System](https://waracrossrealms.wordpress.com/war-tiering-system/)” or WARTS for short. Do note: WARTS is not a dimensional scaling tiering system, and near completely disregards spatial dimensions because tiering systems misunderstand them. But that doesn’t mean your spatial dimensions are not able maintain the same scale they already have, it purely just depends. 

This project will not accept NLFs (No Limits Fallacies). No exceptions. A character is only as strong as their proven scale based on feats, cosmology, and valid statements. The same goes for abilities, however they will share their user’s scale by default, if no proven scale has been attained yet. Meaning that an ability that proves via feats to be galaxy level, is no less or greater than galaxy level unless a new feat is displayed to prove otherwise. So just because an attack from a city character has proven to harm a Baseline 1A character, that does not mean it can also harm an H1A character or any higher level. Furthermore, with no NLFs, you must understand that means no character is Omnipotent, or as VSBW puts it, Tier 0. WARTS does not have a “Tier 0”, and instead has an “X-1 Class” which rising indefinitely, and quite literally cannot be maxed out, I’ve already made sure of that. That said, most events are unlikely to take place in situations equal to X-2 and above. 

This project via WARTS, also diminishes statements of being “Above All Concepts” to one’s Verse. Not all Concepts scale the same, thus a character being beyond All Concepts in their Verse, does not mean they are inherently beyond all Concepts in All Verses, as that would too be a NLF.  The non-acceptance of NLFs does not mean you cannot utilize your characters with NLFs. Instead, their NLF aspects of said character simply won’t apply the same, so a character said to be Omnipotent will only scale to one disparity above their respective Verse. 

Additionally, to make things easier, it’d be good to have your Verse recognize the “True Omniverse”. This is intended represent the Fiction itself, since all of our projects are by default, Fictional. No character can scale to the True Omniverse, or above it as it would quite literally just be the X-1 Class itself. And because it should be obvious, fictional interaction with our world is not possible so feats that claim to “interact with our real world” only gain an additional conceptual layer, narrative layer, or ontological layer above one’s cosmology, and not anything above fiction or the True Omniverse.

••• The true omniverse is simply intended to be the medium in which the project can connect our Verses. I don’t rule the True Omniverse, nor does anyone else. My Verse (despite how high it does scale) does not scale to the True Omniverse, and nor would anyone else’s. It's purely meant to be a narrative device to provide a reasonable medium for our Verses to interact story-wise. So it does not need to be Canon in your Verse outside this project of course. 

Getting to requirements, there are bnk: 

1 - Those who wish to join, will need to have an established Verse. This means you have to have at least some form of officialized Lore or Story. It doesn’t need to be a whole Novel or anything like that. Just maybe a Lore Book, a couple of available chapters in a webnovel, a short story (preferably at least about 500 words, it doesn’t need to be high quality or anything), or something that presents your Verse, that showcases actual events and/or lore details. Even an organized Data Book can be acceptable alongside any already established Lore or stories.

2 - Those who wish to join, will need to have an established Cosmology, as this will be pivotal to ranking your Verse via the WAR Tiering system I’ve remodeled for this project. Energy/Power/Magic systems that transcend each other will not meet the requirements of being a cosmology, nor will they get you beyond my tiering systems “Low Outer+” (do note: WARTS “Low Outer” & “Low Outer+” Classes are not the same as VSBW’s “Low Outer” by the way). And for the love of creation, don’t just create some random barely thought out cosmology that scales into oblivion layers of infinity or something. At least put in some effort please, and try giving each section an actual reason for being there. 

3 - Those who wish to join, will need to have established characters, with their own feats & lore/stories. Basically meaning, not just a random character with a bunch of random powers and feats that have not been displayed outside of the your imagination or deathbattle comments. Abilities that certain types of entities have by default are acceptable, as long as it’s displayed as established in the Verse’s Lore/Stories, or noted in the Verse’s Data Book. Foe example, all entities beyond Time & Space would inherently have Irrelevant Speed, or all Gods have Instant Regeneration or something. As long as it is established within the Verse, it is acceptable. 

I don’t plan to start creating the initial event until March, of which I’ll make another post then to gather four interested Verses to be a part of the Grand Lords Council. I’ll be specifically looking for the strongest Verses in the sub, for in-story admin reasons at least one of the Grand Lords should be the 2nd strongest within the entire WAR Project, which means they should likely be from the 2nd Strongest Verse that joins the project. And the rest of the Grand Lords should also be amongst the strongest in the project for the same reason. So anyone who believes their Verse is amongst the strongest (while also being of good quality) in the sub, then use the time until I make the WAR Post in March to make sure you meet the three requirements. Following the initial WAR event, I intend for there to be an in-story WAR matchup battle royal between characters from the strongest Verses who wish to be on the Grand Lord Council.  

Everyone else can prepare as well, since those will basically be the same requirements for regular members too. That said, I won’t be adding member Verses beyond the Council until maybe April. But that doesn’t mean you can’t prep your Verse to join and keep in touch with me or other council members (once they’ve been decided) until then. 

I’m also looking into the Honeycomb community app as a place where we could all meet until my Publishing App gets made in the future sometime late 2025 to sometime 2026. For now, feel free to get ready for WAR, most importantly, lets do our best to just have fun. 

Feel free to DM or message here if you have any questions. I do ask that you bear with me, as due to my work, I can’t always respond immediately, but I will make sure to definitely respond and answer your questions. ",1,1738932473.0,OriginalCharacterDB,0,1.0,False

[Young, Colleagues Reintroduce Bill to Strengthen Critical Minerals Supply Chains  - Senator Young](https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-colleagues-reintroduce-bill-to-strengthen-critical-minerals-supply-chains/)

**WASHINGTON –** U.S. Senators Todd Young (R-Ind.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), and John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) introduced the *Securing Trade and Resources for Advanced Technology, Economic Growth, and International Commerce (STRATEGIC) in Minerals Act* to strengthen America’s supply chain of critical minerals and rare earth elements.

Critical minerals are essential resources but are highly vulnerable to supply chain disruption, and China’s aggressive manipulation of these elements presents significant national and economic security threats. The legislation would empower the president to negotiate and enforce sector-specific free trade agreements exclusively focused on critical minerals and rare earth elements (REEs) with trusted partners and allies, thereby bolstering cooperation, reducing trade barriers, and enhancing national security.

“Our nation depends on critical minerals for everything from consumer goods to defense technologies, and relying on foreign adversaries for these materials is a national security vulnerability we cannot afford,” **said Senator Young.** “Negotiating more trade agreements specific to critical minerals with trusted partners will help shore up our supply of these resources, protect American interests, and strengthen our national security.”

“If America is to remain a superpower, we need resilient supply chains for critical minerals— and that means strong relationships with reliable trading partners around the world,” **said Senator Coons.** “The STRATEGIC Minerals Act will help us achieve that goal, and it’s one more way Congress is doing its part to position the U.S. to produce the technologies that will define the rest of the 21st century.”

“China dominates the critical minerals supply chain, which leaves America vulnerable to national security risks,” **said Senator Cornyn.** “By shoring up America’s critical minerals supply chain, this legislation would increase our competitiveness on the world stage, reduce our dependence on foreign adversaries, and foster greater trade with trusted allies.”

“Critical minerals are key to our clean energy future and American innovation,” **said Senator Hickenlooper.** “China currently controls the supply chain for many of these essential resources. Our international allies will help us diversify our critical mineral supply and strengthen our national security.”

More specifically, the *STRATEGIC Minerals Act* would:

* Authorize the president, through the U.S. Trade Representative, to negotiate, enter into, and enforce specialized trade agreements focused on critical minerals and REEs, subject to congressional approval.
* Set trade negotiation objectives to strengthen supply chains of critical minerals and REEs, aiming to reduce or eliminate trade barriers with trusted allies to ensure reliable access and reduce dependence on adversarial nations.
* Exclude nonmarket economies like China and prevent foreign entities of concern from benefiting, allowing only trusted partners to participate in order to safeguard our national security.
* Require the president to consult with Congress before initiating negotiations, providing details on objectives and potential impacts and ensuring legislative oversight.
* Amends the Defense Production Act of 1950 to include certain businesses from countries party to such agreements in the definition of domestic sources under strict conditions, strengthening U.S. access to critical minerals essential for national security while prioritizing American interests.

The [*STRATEGIC Minerals Act*](https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-coons-introduce-bill-to-strengthen-critical-minerals-supply-chains/) was originally introduced in 2024 and builds on Senator Young’s efforts to ensure the United States has access to critical mineral supply chains and is countering China’s industry manipulation, including by introducing the [*Critical Minerals Future Act*](https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-colleagues-introduce-bipartisan-bill-to-support-domestic-processing-of-critical-minerals/) and the [*Critical Minerals Security Act*](https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-colleagues-introduce-bill-to-secure-critical-mineral-supply-chains-counter-chinese-dominance/) in the 118^(th) Congress.

https://preview.redd.it/vjie47pclphe1.png?width=1479&format=png&auto=webp&s=0059aae290950d0ae9bfcfef13b382a1376756c5

***On 1 February 2025, early into his second term, President Trump took swift action to impose tariffs on goods imported from major trading partners, China, Canada, and Mexico. The announcement followed Trump’s advocacy of tariffs during his presidential campaign to protect US jobs and address national security concerns.*** 

***The US sources a huge proportion of its minerals and metals from these countries – particularly nickel, aluminium, steel and copper – and also leans on their refining capabilities, meaning that trade tensions could have significant knock-on effects to global critical mineral supply chains, compliance and investment.***

***In this article, we unpack what’s unfolded so far and who could be impacted.***

# Background

President Trump announced the following [tariffs](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn93e12rypgo) on 1 February 2025:

* A 25% additional tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico, with the exception of energy resources from Canada, which faced an additional 10% levy; and
* A 10% tariff on imports from China, which had already been the subject to a range of duties.

Canadian energy or energy resources were defined to include “critical minerals”.

A day later, Trump announced that the tariffs imposed on Mexico and Canada would be temporarily postponed for 30 days, following deals that were brokered by Trump and the respective heads of Mexico and Canada. The tariffs on China, however, proceeded as planned, intensifying existing trade tensions between the two economic giants.

In the same week, Trump [hinted](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/trump-says-he-wants-ukraine-supply-us-with-rare-earths-2025-02-03/) at negotiating a deal with Ukraine for rare earth minerals in exchange for US aid.  The proposed agreement would give the US access to critical minerals such as lithium and titanium, which are crucial for the US defence and electronics industry.

Whilst Trump’s use of tariffs in the name of national security is unsurprising, the executive orders were issued [pursuant](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN11129) to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (**IEEPA**), following the [national energy emergency](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/declaring-a-national-energy-emergency/) declared on 20 January 2025. The IEEPA provides the president with [extensive](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-case-against-ieepa-tariffs) powers to address national emergencies and confers minimal procedural requirements for the imposition of tariffs, resulting in little to no time for those affected to brace for the full impact of these measures.

# China's response

In response to Trump’s tariffs, China [retaliated](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-04/china-retaliates-with-tariffs-on-united-states-goods/104896638) by imposing:

* 15% tariffs on coal and LNG;
* 10% tariffs on crude oil, agricultural machinery and large-engine vehicles; and
* restrictions on the export of [five critical metals](https://www.mofcom.gov.cn/zwgk/zcfb/art/2025/art_e623090907fc4e1092f0a4db72f57b95.html) used in defence, clean energy and other industries.

Licenses will now be required to export tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, indium, and molybdenum related products, with the grant of such licenses requiring compliance with regulations. These regulations are unclear at this stage.

While these measures aren’t as bold as the [mineral export bans](https://www.herbertsmithfreehills.com/insights/2024-12/chinas-trade-embargo-on-critical-minerals-to-the-united-states) that China imposed on the US in December last year, which included bans on gallium, germanium, and antimony, additional regulation will undoubtedly increase the complexities and costs to the markets of these critical minerals. The Chinese retaliatory measures will not take effect until 10 February 2025.

The above is in addition to the proposed regulatory changes that China’s Ministry of Commerce [announced](https://www.herbertsmithfreehills.com/notes/mining/2025-posts/chinas-mofcom-proposes-to-restrict-batteries-related-technologies) in January, which would reclassify gallium extraction, lithium processing and refining technologies as “restricted”, and potentially have significant flow-on effects to joint ventures, licensing, technical services and other forms of cooperation. Public consultation for these measures closed on 1 February 2025, with a published draft amendment of the relevant legislative framework likely to follow soon. Learn more about the proposed export restrictions [here](https://www.herbertsmithfreehills.com/notes/mining/2025-posts/chinas-mofcom-proposes-to-restrict-batteries-related-technologies).

# Economic implications

The temporary suspension of the Canada-Mexico tariffs may have provided a short-term reprieve for industries that rely on minerals from these regions. However, Trump’s proposed plans to eliminate the trade deficit between the US and its neighbouring countries suggests the threat of tariffs is not over. There remains a possibility that these tariffs could proceed after the suspension, and even increase to upwards of 60%, which Trump alluded to during his campaign trail.  

Below, we consider the impact of such tariffs on the critical minerals industry.

**Considerations for Canada, Mexico and Australia**

The US and Canada have one of the [largest bilateral relationships](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12595/2) in the world when it comes to trade, and particularly when it comes to energy. Canada is the [largest source](https://www.csis.org/analysis/canadian-tariffs-will-undermine-us-minerals-security) of critical minerals to the US, and conversely, in 2023, the US sent $[30.7 billion](https://www.usitc.gov/research_and_analysis/tradeshifts/2023/minerals) in minerals to Canada.

In particular, the US is a net importer of nickel, aluminium, steel, and copper. Currently, Canada supplies [half](https://www.csis.org/analysis/canadian-tariffs-will-undermine-us-minerals-security) of US nickel imports, critical for the defence and automotive industries, and about [60%](https://www.energypolicy.columbia.edu/the-energy-trade-and-geopolitical-implications-of-the-trump-tariffs/) of aluminium. In the case of nickel, the US has limited refining capability.

Mexico, too, plays a vital role in the supply of goods and minerals to the US. Whilst the US largely relies on Mexico for computers and automobiles, in 2024, Mexico exported [3.19 million tonnes](https://www.fastmarkets.com/insights/exploring-tariffs-trade-policies-economic-impact/) of steel products to the US.

There are no winners in a tariff war. The impact on the US steel and aluminium industries of tariffs on Canadian mineral product imports is increased costs. Tariffs also send a poor message to those considering investing in or developing a US critical minerals mine.

For the Canada and Mexico tariffs are clearly not welcome, but far from fatal. Both jurisdictions would find alternative markets for their product, but there would be a period of disruption and significant changes in logistics.

Tariffs also have flow on effects to industries adjacent to the mining sector, including logistics and shipping providers.   

**Supply chain disruptions**

The imposition of tariffs, particularly on critical minerals, will likely [increase the costs](https://www.piie.com/research/piie-charts/2025/trumps-threatened-tariffs-would-raise-prices-toys-electronics-footwear) of mining and manufacturing processes in the US. Companies with integrated supply chains across both China and the US will likely face higher costs or potential supply shortages of critical minerals, resulting in potential delays to projects (i.e. clean energy) or production of goods (i.e. electric vehicles).

Further, China’s dominance in the global supply chain for many rare earth elements will likely encourage mining companies to reconsider their dependence on China for processing and refining operations. These companies will have to consider exploring new markets or alternative suppliers, to ensure resilience against a possible trade war. This will come with other considerations relating to costs, logistics, and other complexities.

**Increased compliance costs**

As China places export controls on rare earths, mining companies will need to ensure they comply with new regulations and consider national security concerns. This is particularly the case for global corporate groups with Chinese-based subsidiaries, who will now have to seek approvals. Engaging with this new regulatory framework and possible risks for non-compliance will undoubtedly be burdensome for these corporate groups.

**Domestic and alternative investment**

The US currently has limited domestic processing capacities. In particular, China dominates the global refining capacity for over [half](https://economics.td.com/us-trade-critical-minerals) of the critical minerals the US deems critical to its economy and national security. In pursuit of decreased dependence on China, the US will have to look at addressing the gaps in supply. The US markets may see increased investment in domestic mining and refining capabilities, as well as strategic investments in alternative supply chains (i.e. recycling or technology for extraction) or other mining nations.

# Australia

Australia, while not impacted by tariffs, remains a significant supplier of lithium and nickel to the US. The Australian mining industry is unlikely to face similar tariffs imposed on China and Canada, given there is limited overlap between the raw materials sourced from the US and that from Australia. Nevertheless, Australian mining entities with Chinese or American subsidiaries or assets will need to consider the implications of these tariffs on their operations. The US is a common area of future investment focus for Australian mining companies and a tariff war with Canada will be a matter of concern. Domestic Australian mining industry producers will also cautiously hope that an unrelated issue between the US and Australia does not result in tariffs on Australian critical minerals (although there would seem to be many other goods that would receive tariffs before critical minerals).  

# Conclusion

***Whilst Trump’s intentions to diversify away from China are not surprising, the disruptive nature of these emergency tariffs invites some uncertainty and volatility to the future of clean energy. However, as we've*** [***noted***](https://www.herbertsmithfreehills.com/notes/mining/2024-posts/what-will-trump-administration-mean-for-critical-minerals) ***previously, it is likely these tariffs will be a catalyst to longer term investments into US domestic production of critical minerals and a diversification of sources for critical minerals by consumers that are heavily reliant on the US.***

1ijtzww,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1ijtzww/what_kind_of_blood_work_can_i_do_or_else/,what kind of blood work can i do? or else?,"i recently turned 27 (f), pretty lean, tall young woman.

two years ago i started to have EXTREME bone pain in my wrists - few months later - rosacea - eczema - burning inside my body and mental confusion.. so leaky gut was my own hypothesis and further you'll see that my foods and supplements are for this problem. my GP wrote that off as nothing and hehe that i'm a hypochondriac AND it's because my iron levels are too low. i did have covid though before everything started. i'm vaccinated from covid as well.......:)

so. after 2 years i feel better, i cleaned up my diet, i sleep pretty great and do some kind of movement every day. yoga, walking, some light lifting. i feel that my body is getting stronger and better BUT:

i still get low iron every 4 months or so after i take a course of feritin supplements. and now i started to experience body pain again, especially in my hips, during period the pain radiating to my legs (i have ademyosis and endometriosis...:( ) and in my upper back now, radiating to my hands, esp elbows. it feels like bone pain though. and almost all of my joints pop when i move (back, hands, especially shoulders). And my skin and eyes are so so so dry... i gathered that its something connected with dryness in my body?

my general blood work seems ok but feritin and hemoglobin. vit d is ok.

i did autoimmune screening (ANA is higher, but ENA showed nothing) and since i have endometriosis it makes sense. also i have H.pylori and yersinia IGG positive. I don't have Lyme disease. even though the test showed MAYBE. my rheumatlogist said that its a no. for these pathogens i refused to take antibiotics, because i have not many symptoms in my GI from them and i know that my mum took 3 courses of 3iple therapy and she still has h.pylori. although i took mastic gum for a while and i need to check up those pathogens again since i cleaned up my diet and did some natural regimens.

i take: sulphoraphane, MSM, collagen, vitamin C, Vitamin D, magnesium, omega 3, digestive ezyme with heavier in fat meals. L-theanine. and L-glutamine every few months for few months. curcumin +pepper.

my diet is animal based. ground beef, steaks, goat butter. sweet potatoes, rice, buckwheat, broccoli, arugula, eggs, pumpkin, zuchini. some blueberries, mangoes and bananas. sourkraut, cucumbers. some dates. you know, anti inflammatory and animal based. i dont eat gluten or cow dairy, i dont eat anything processed as well. no processed sugar as well. lots of olive oil.

i poop every morning. i drink lots of water (2l +-) everyday. i could drink less coffee though. i do 2 cups a day.

and i meditate and do shadow work and pretty much healed myself from depression.

So what i want to ask is - where can i step up and what can i research more? what can i check more? maybe anyone experienced smth like that as well? what helped?

i know i want to do sauna once a week, but my skin hurts from heat... and my pulse gets high. i guess i'll have to experiment.

  
anywho. seems like i did a long read so i appreciate any detective work from you. thank youuu <3 

P.S. sorry for my weird english.. it's not my mothers tongue:)

Sometimes the chats run dry or seem to fade. But they keep replying. You mention running out of things to talk about or the other person not asking questions.    

Look, not everyone likes texting and trying to have a conversation on the app. It’s an asynchronous conversation and hard to get a rhythm going. 

So just ask the person to meet. Plain and simple. Honestly that’s what a lot of people are waiting for. We are on the app to MEET people not be pen pals. Sure you need to vet a little bit. They should be able to start chatting and sound normal, not get sexual, etc.  I’m just saying when the conversation starts to fade it’s time to move to meeting.  

I just did that. I had a woman that stopped texting me a week ago. We only matched and chatted that one day. I replied but didn’t ask a question. I never heard from her all week. So then I just said “want to grab coffee and talk?” She said “sure that sounds  great”.  So I need to look at my schedule because I have other dates.  ",4,1738931734.0,Bumble,9,0.75,False

I was taking prednisone, which was keeping the shingles virus going fullbore behind my eyes when I stop the prednisone it attacked me like a bomb Eye pressure when I went to the ophthalmologist was at 33 and 22 they injected my eyes with something to get rid of the virus and after my left eye reattachment which was October 30 of 2019 my right eye had 2 pounds of pressure. My left eye was up to 10 with Gas oil in the attached right of the right eye didn’t have enough pressure to do anything with just like a ride a grape five years now I’m still trying to deal with my blindness, but on this journey, I went deaf three months after my retina attachment I realized I couldn’t hear when trying to teach myself how to play the Piano And slowly I lost my hearing. I just had a cochlear implant put in in August 1924. I’m awaiting approval to get the right one in in hopes that technology will come out that will allow more fluid to get into my eyes and I can see you again. I’m feel as if I’m not doing enough to better my situation. I was trying to learn how to use the the stick and I couldn’t hear and that stopped that feeling sorry for myself drinking my wife stepped out on the marriage having an affair for 2 1/2 years before I found out right after I went blind, which caused more negativity within myself friends I thought I had her gone family. Buirley comes around. I love to go off I love to paint that was an artist cartoonist I oh I did so many things that I can’t do anymore like changing experience to say the least and I just recently which was this morning. Listen to a recording of me in my wife Christmas of 2022 when I just found out, she was having an affair by checking text messages knowing something was wrong within the relationship. She was texting him 3500 times a month. I know it’s unreal Along with those texts were pictures mostly on my birthday August 7 which just was a dad in the heart not sure if she could’ve been doing stuff right in front of me. I really trusted her with all my heart and didn’t expect that she’s we still together. I should’ve probably listen to my dad and kicked around right away with the fear of being alone and not having enough Balls or help with fear to do it on my own I I read you know people go on vacations behind and you know got their masters Blind and you guys are very smart and very wealthy. I don’t have either of that. You know why I shouldn’t of reopened the wound but it was nothing but knee sounding like a week man with no hope and her sounding like a very vindictive egotistical vain eccentric just so without empathy I guess it’d be non-empathetic and trying to turn which she did around because I wasn’t spending enough time with her and I was not wanting to go anywhere with her. I don’t wanna do anything anymore so I started this day off. I usually wake up make her coffee make her breakfast and I decided I’m not gonna do that today so as I’m trying to write this post, she’s kicking the bed. You know she’s very selfish childish and a liar and I’m still with her because of the fear of being alone there’s other women out there I don’t know. I’m sure there’s a lot of women out there, but are they good women when people come around they just wanna see how close I am to death or what I have that they can Steal And that family unfortunately my dog is my best friend. She’s wonderful. I would train with her when I was doing marathons are 12 cases now I can’t even walk a block without getting lost. I think my neighbors enjoy watching me get lost in snow storms I use Compass on my phone, but I’m out so long my phone dies. I try calling my wife she never answers and somehow Someway I make it back with my hands about Black and that’s all I need to do is lose my hands. I’ve already lost two senses. I just I’m in a bad way and I’m negative and you know you know you gotta keep putting one step in front of the other Problem is when I do that it seems like I run into the corner of a wall and many mini busted noses no I used to do 2500 steps 25,000 steps a day with my work and my my life is it sucks like Helen Keller without that cochlear implant I was like Helen Keller and hearing aids are terrible Afraid to go anywhere because I don’t know if I’ll ever get home you know I’m my mom will pick me up and I’ll be gone for three or four hours and then she won’t take me home. She says I need to be out but I don’t like to be out. This is very long. I’m just pouring out everything that’s going on in my head right now and I really don’t care if anyone listens I just need to do it and you know it’s just I guess I’m just whining. You know I listen to Joel staying hoping that lift my spirits. You know I tried doing the rosary to help you know it’s like Joel Steen says a friend of the pilot and for things you need to know being a pilot is Lift thrust drag, and weight. Keep the weight in the drag out of your life and keep people around you that help you with the lift and the thrust well the only lift I get from Sirius XM when I listen to him the only Russ I get is when I got a buzz from drinking. My wife doesn’t have sex with me anymore so I have no hope there maybe I put too much weight in sex, but I think I’ve always been hypersexual. Maybe it was from watching porn that I went blind maybe that’s other virus. I don’t know a few friends say he must’ve done something really bad to have this happened to you that makes you feel great. I don’t talk to them anymore. My dad‘s always been positive and no, I think him and my mom are just they don’t like coming around because they’ve been vain their whole life just as I was now I can care less what people look like. I only care about the personality and I’m struggling to keep a positive personality and I don’t I justI just pray. Pray that I can get technology to give me my site back before I drink myself to death who knows what else thanks.

I love them for their simplicity and their lack of pretentiousness. They don't have the newest gadgets or the most updated furnishings, but they provide everything you need and nothing else. Over the years people have come and gone. Left things behind. At any point you think you need to go out and buy something, usually you'll find it in that closet with the wooden door with the metal latch.

The dishes and are from retired sets and mismatched. The pots and pans show wear of years of use. The couch is from the 70s, but still very comfy. They have a small library of books you may never have thought about reading, but call out to be read as many have perused those pages before you while enjoying the same relaxing environment.

You look on the shelves and their are numerous old games you remember as a kid. The boxes are held together with tape and inside are the old pencils and score cards of friends and families who have enjoyed them in the past. Now, everybody is up for playing a game of Boggle that nobody has had the inkling to play for years. Even if they have the same game stuck on the top shelf in their closet at home.

The towels aren't the style you'd normally buy for your home. They may have a beach theme with shells or dolphins on them, but they seem to dry better for some reason. The shower head doesn't provide the same jet of water you're used to but it seems more relaxing and gets you just as clean. 

The cabinets and countertops would be have been replaced years ago in someone's regular home. But no need here. Why? They hold dishes, glasses, cups, coffee and cereal just fine. 

The television might be an old tube-style, with a VCR connected. The picture doesn't seem to be as bad as you thought it would be after years of huge, HD screens. And the dozen or so VHS tapes there are usually classics. Forrest Gump. ET. Movies you'd probably never thought you'd watch again now get played and you wonder why you haven't revisited them in years.

Everybody is relaxed because nobody is trying to impress anyone. What's there is there and that's what you'll be using. There is no embarrassment that the utensils don't match. In fact, it's endearing. There is a bottle cap opener on the side of the house telling you ""Leave your worries at the door. This is a place to unwind. To enjoy life."" 

You go to sleep in a smaller bed then you may be used to but it's fine. For some reason, top covers seems to be more comfortable then what you have at home. They seem to weigh perfectly on your body as you drift off. 

When you wake up it's not because of an alarm clock. You wake up because someone is in the kitchen frying up some bacon and eggs and making coffee. One by one everyone starts trickling out of their bedrooms with messy hair and perhaps a bit of a hangover. Normally you don't see each other in this sort of state but it's completely fine here and is a welcome sight, seeing people with their guard down. Nobody is trying to impress anyone here. 

Someone got up early to get some pastries down the street at the local ma and pa shop that also sells worms for fishing. Your strict diet at home is out the window and this chocolate-filled croissant is the best thing you ever tasted. You hear ice being poured into a cooler outside. A sign of things to come for the day and is just a pleasant sound. As you wash up after breakfast you look under the cabinet for a sponge and notice a large pot for boiling lobster and clams.

After breakfast you open the outdoor shed to see what you have to work with. Goggles, beach chairs, multiple coolers, a beach umbrella, insect repellent, you name it. No need to buy anything. Everybody gathers something under their arms and makes their way down the path to the beach. Everyone is walking slower than normal because there is no need to rush. You'll be doing this again tomorrow.

The only thing bad about staying at a cottage is that last day there. Where everyone has to hug and say goodbye. Time to get back to the ""real world"". As you drive off and the cottage gets smaller in the rear-view mirror, you wish you could just turn around and do it all over again.",15,1738930795.0,simpleliving,3,0.94,False

Other than the disgusting meal bars, the dinner was otherwise uneventful, and Alia did her best to choke them down with a neutral expression. Thankfully, neither Viv nor anyone else asked for her opinion on the meal. Everyone stayed off the topic of Alia’s supposed holiness and asked much more mundane questions, until the topic of Greylock came up.

“Eter-, I’m sorry, I mean, Alia.” Viv said as coffee - instant, Alia sighed to herself - was passed around. “We had tracked what we thought was a lost colony ship braking to enter into this system for nearly a year, and then it just… exploded. We had thought all hands lost, and then we saw your drive fame. What happened?” Viv regarded Alia with wide eyes, and her face radiated concern, but Alia noticed that her jaw was clenched, and her hands - while clasping each other to give the appearance of just keeping them out of the way - had white knuckles, like she was squeezing them very tightly. She very much would like to know what happened to Greylock.

“Actually, before I tell you about my time, I would like to ask you about James Tennigan of Halcyon and the people he called Jimbos.”

Viv’s brow furrowed very slightly and a frown flashed across her face before she regained control. Her voice was breezy as she tried to laugh off Alia’s question. With a flash, she realized that Viv was uncomfortable with the idea of an Alia that did not know how to ask or answer questions… correctly. “Oh them? James was the administrator of a rogue colony. They named it Halcyon did they? That seems rather ironic given their history. Their colony was attacked and destroyed.”

“By…” Alia said

“By us.” Viv finished simply.

“And the Jimbos?”

“Is a *stupid* name, isn’t it?” Viv said and smiled again. “They prefer to be known as the Anomura. That’s not their own name for them, it’s just the name they prefer we use.”

“So they are… aliens?”

Viv frowned slightly. “Alien is a charged word, Alia. They are sapients.”

“I apologize. The Anomura are sapients?”

“Oh yes. We met them about a century ago. A long range explorer Nullship came across one of their colonies. Contact was… confusing at first. But we’re friends now!” Viv’s hair bobbed slightly as she nodded to herself.

“Why were they called Jimbos?”

“It’s a name born from ignorance by the Terran Authority.” Viv said, and gestured like she was brushing the name away. “They did not care to learn more about them, and they were just named that because the first human to meet them was named Jimbo.”

“Why did James say *they* were attacking Halcyon?” Alia said. “He made it sound like they were an unknown species and were attacking without provocation.”

“Oh that?” Viv laughed lightly and then took a sip of coffee quickly. “We were working… with them. I imagine that an Anomura Seeker-Tracker found them first.”

“Seeker-Tracker?”

Once again, Alia caught a glimpse of Viv’s reaction before she answered. She could see her jaw muscle flex and clench, but just as fast it relaxed. Viv was on the ragged edge of control. “It’s one of their class of ships; like a scout, but more heavily armed. Anyway, they were working with us to subdue the rogue colony, and Halcyon had apparently decided that destruction was preferable to being a contributing member of the Allied Planet League.”

“Why?”

“Why what?” Viv said, her eyebrows arched. She put down her coffee cup and sighed very slightly. Alia knew she was getting tired of the questions but she *had* to know, for Greylock’s sake if nothing else. “Why were the Anomura interested in Halcyon? Alia, it’s *their* colony world they’re protecting. Halcyon had nulled into the system; and was going to move it closer and closer to their planet until they could land and…” she spread her hands wide, “make it theirs. They never had a permanent presence in the colony.”

“But, James said that they were there for over… four hundred years.” Alia’s voice was quiet. “When we turned our scopes on the system it looked like something had manipulated their star too, stole most of it’s energy.”

“Did he? Lies.” Viv said and nodded once, with emphasis. “They haven’t been in the system a year. I’m he was just trying to garner sympathy.”

“Why lie about that though?” Alia continued. “There’s no reason to make Halcyon seem older than it is, especially if they hadn’t even settled a planet yet.” Alia trailed off before she said something out loud that she shouldn’t. She was getting more and more uncomfortable being on *Tontine*. It was clear they were keeping something from her, but why? Didn’t Viv worship her? “James sent a message before he signed off. He had said that they were hiding in a hollowed out asteroid and waiting for our “rescue.” I was skeptical because how can you hollow out an asteroid that quickly?”

At the mention of James hiding in the asteroid, the other conversation around the table stopped, and people turned to Viv and Alia. The hair on the back of Alia’s neck stood up as she realized that Viv was *not* the only one who understood her.  Viv’s eye widened slightly and she leaned forward just a bit. “Did he? *Tell me more*. Do you know where he is hiding?”

“Uh no.” Alia said quickly. “We hadn’t worked out where he was hiding. We were er, too far away to triangulate the message laser any better than coming from this system.” Elia looked across the table at her, staring, but said nothing.

“We?” Viv said.

“…Me and Greylock, the shipboard AI.” Alia said, only lying a little bit.

“An AI? You were working with an *AI*? Mystics, now I really am sad that your colony ship was destroyed. I’ve never met one. AI creation was banned a millennia ago. Any AIs left are either so insular as to ignore almost all outside stimuli, or are…” She made a gesture Alia didn’t recognize, “Uh, not within their full faculties anymore. Too bad about James,” Viv said, leaning back in her chair. At her motion, everyone else relaxed as well. “Well, you were probably the last to receive a message from him, so if you’re able to figure out where he’s hiding, let me know. We had thought that the colony was utterly destroyed, but if he’s still around…”

“Yes, of course.” Alia said, and stood. As she did, the entire table stood as well. “I wish to thank you all for your hospitality, and for your welcome. Unfortunately, by our ships time it is quite late, and we should be heading back.” Her team pushed their chairs back in, and walked around to Alia’s side of the table.

“Of course of course! The pleasure was all ours. Please allow us to remain connected a little while longer, and we can provide you with any supplies that you require.” Viv’s head bowed slightly.

“Actually…” Alia glanced at her team and then turned back to Viv. “Can we have a translator? You are doing an admirable job with my language, but I have a feeling that there isn’t many people who can speak it. We’d love to be able to open communication with others.”

“Oh, thank you so much! I downloaded a language soft from the Warchive, and I couldn’t be sure how accurate it was. It dated from Early Eternity, and I wasn’t sure how long you had been gone before that. I’m glad I’m intelligible. We will of course provide you with a translator as well as a few of our computing devices. You’ll need them to run the translator.” Viv gestured and a steward practically ran up to her. She whispered something in her regular language, and they saluted once by crossing their arms over their chest, and then took off through a door. “Anything else you need” 

Alia hesitated, but the worse Viv could say was no. “C-Can we have a nulldrive? We’re at a disadvantage here being the only one who cannot travel FTL. If we are to help find James then we’ll need…”

Viv gasped. “Of course! Your left before the nulldrive was developed! Hmm.” She took a pad out of her pocket and quickly unfolded it. The screen poured with a character set Alia had never seen. “We have the mass *and* spare parts available; I will ask our engineers if we can construct one for you. It will be made of spares and somewhat… lashed together, but it will suffice until you return to greater League space and can refit your ship.” She looked down at a comm on her wrist and frowned quickly, and then smiled again. “I’ll have someone come by in… 10 hours. Will that be sufficient for your rest period?”

Alia nodded. “That will be fine, thank you.”

“Wonderful! Now, if you’ll excuse me, I must return to my duties.” Viv bowed slightly again, and without a look back, exited the wardroom.”

They were escorted by two young looking guards back to the airlock. When they returned to Mountain Memories, Alia closed the airlock and connected to the ship’s network and secured the door. Unless they brought shaped charges, It wouldn’t open without her authorization. Only then, did she relax. “Okay. We have ten hours until they come back, hopefully with a nulldrive, or at least instructions on how to print one.” She said. “What are we going to do?”

“Why did you tell them it was bedtime, Cap?” Bric said, as he shrugged out of his uniform and pulled a t-shirt on.

“I wanted to have them leave us the fuck alone for as long as we could so we can plan our next steps.” Alia said, and unzipped her own uniform most of the way down and left it. It was stifling hot and she felt like she needed a shower after that meeting. Zero gee showers were miserable affairs and Alia missed showering under acceleration. She would stand in the hot water, just letting her troubles melt away until Greylock would chide her about wasting water.

Elia’s eyes flicked to Alia’s unzipped uniform, and Yel thumped her shoulder. “Her eyes are up there, El.” Yel said and smiled lightly. Alia had noticed Elia’s eyes, but didn’t put together she was being checked out until Yel said something. Alia tried to hide her blush, but did not zip her uniform back up. “What do we know?”

“We know that the other yous have set up some kind of government.”Ben said, ticking points off on his fingers. “Not only that, but - in some capacity - they’re still in charge. Lots of people - we don’t know how many - worship you as some kind of religious figure. I have a hunch that the ‘Literature’ Viv mentioned is some kind of proselytizing literature. We know - or rather, we were told - that there is at least one alien-er, sapient group out there, the Anomura.”

“That’s a name for hermit crabs,” Bric said. “I bet they look crabby.”

“Huh, I didn’t know that, thanks Bric!” Ben said and flashed him a smile. “They are working with Viv and her… team, but we don’t know what’s up with James. It sure sounds like he guessed, or was told who we were and was trying to get us to work for him against them. We were also told that James was trying to set up a rogue colony, but I… don’t know how much I buy that.” Ben said and looked up at Bric, who shrugged. “A colony is expensive and complicated. If they had null drives, they could just-” he gestured “-pop over to any system they want and see if it’s occupied already.”

“Maybe there’s licensing.” Yel said.

“What do you mean?” Elia added, looking at Yel, trying to give her more attention since her eyes were caught wandering.

“If the nulldrive has shrunk the galaxy, and there are other species around, then there might be some kind of coalition that handles things like colonization. Like, giving out licenses to colonize things like that. Maybe the Anomura made a wildcat colony and James has the legitimate claim, maybe it’s the other way around.” Yel floated over to a wall, and clipped a tether, so she could stop holding on to things. “Either way, I think we need to find James and get his side of the story.”

“Hey wait,” Elia said and clipped up next to Yel. “How *did* James know your language? If we’ve been gone as long as G said we were, then that’s a tough thing to guess.”

“Maybe James reached out to the TA before talking to us the first time.” Alia said. She didn’t tether herself and floated gently in the HVAC. “That makes the most sense. He could have saw our drive flame, realized what we were - especially if Viv is right about the Eternity - he’d recognize us as one of ‘the lost’ and he sent a message back asking what to do. They told him to tell me to activate Tartarus, or he told me to do it after he was attacked by Viv and the Anomura and hope that I’d come in and, I dunno, blow them up?” Alia looked up at her small crew. “It doesn’t seem like that smart of an idea to me.”

“Maybe James is an idiot?” Bric said, and chuckled at his own joke. “Either way, we should get some rest, and wait for Viv and her folks to show up. Alia, you should go be the ship again. If they’re really going to bring us a nulldrive, you should be there to help install it. If they’re going to try something, then you should be ready to light the drive and get out of here.”

“Or turn the drive on Tontine.” Elia said. Yel looked over at her, horrified. “What? A drives efficiency is proportional to its use as a weapon. If we ramp up to a couple gee and play the exhaust over Tontine, I don’t care *what* they’re made of, we’re melting it.”

Alia stared at Elia for a moment. “We’ll keep that one as plan Z,” she said, quietly.",25,1738930771.0,HFY,7,1.0,False
