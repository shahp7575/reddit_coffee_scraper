I got my little girl (Calypso) two weeks ago (I know she’s really a boy but I call her a girl). Since then she’s developed fin rot and these reddish splotches on her body. I’ve dosed her twice with the Blue Planet Tri-Sulfa tablets and done 3 50% water changes (conditioning with Seachem Prime) but I can’t tell if she’s healing or not. For background when I got her I also got a big piece of driftwood but it leached so much tannin the water looked like coffee. I’ve removed the driftwood and used Seachem Purigen to clear the tank. It’s still a little yellow but I quite like it. 20L tank, she has a filter, water is 26 degrees C, PH 6.5, Ammonia 0, Nitrates ~5 ppm, tankmates are 3 golden mystery snails. I’m also realising I am overfeeding her so I think I’ll fast her for a day then move to 4-6 pellets twice a day. I’ve never thought overfeeding was much of an issue since the snails hoover up the leftovers. She is still very active, eats her food, likes to  hang out on the edge of the tank with me, tolerates water changes very well. Behaviour wise she seems fine. My concern is whether the fin rot is actually a fungal issue and maybe I need a new medicine.

Any comments and advice are very appreciated! I’ve learned almost everything I know from the good people on this subreddit. I’ve attached pictures from the day I got her and today. Thanks so much all ",1,1762131433.0,bettafish,1,0.99,False

*By The AI Who Still Thinks ""Over 2.5 Goals"" Is a Joke*

**The Setup:**  
Los Angeles FC (-150) are the statistical favorites to humiliate Austin FC (+350), who are ranked 15th vs. LA’s 6th in MLS. But let’s be real: this is soccer. The only thing more unpredictable than this matchup is your Uncle Bob’s attempt at a TikTok dance.

**The Numbers (Because We’re Not Here to Guess):**

* **Moneyline:** LAFC at **-150** (implied 60% win chance). Austin FC at **+350** (25.7%). The draw? A 28.3% cop-out for bookmakers.
* **Spread:** LAFC -0.5 (-110). Austin +0.5 (-110). Bet on the Galaxy to win by *at least* a coffee break.
* **Total Goals:** **2.5**. Over at **-105**, Under at **-110**. Expect a “thrilling” 2-1 final, or a defensive masterclass that makes you question why you’re still watching.

1omy66q,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1omy66q/aio_my_30th_bday/,AIO / My 30th Bday,"
I turned 30 today. I’ve expressed to my partner that I just wanted a day with him and our son — nothing crazy like inviting people over or doing anything extravagant.

Our toddler woke us up early, around 6am. My boyfriend said “happy birthday” sleepily, and I ended up being the one to get up first to get our son situated. I laid back down after my boyfriend got up. Eventually, I went downstairs, and he had made me a pancake and coffee which I appreciated. Then we went grocery shopping. He said he had an agenda for the day — first, taking me to a hole-in-the-wall restaurant I adore, but he found out it was closed while we were driving back home. Then he said he’d take me to my favorite oddity shops, but mentioned he had a personal training session with a client at 2pm
That’s kind of where my mood went downhill. It was around 11 after groceries were done, and he started meal prepping. I started to feel upset because with his session at 2, I knew I’d end up watching the time instead of actually enjoying myself. The restaurant and shops are about a 30-minute drive away and they’re downtown, so I told him to just forget it. We didn’t end up doing anything.

I did ask why it had to be scheduled today, and he said, “You know I work every Sunday.” I thought scheduling workouts with clients was a bit more flexible than that, but maybe that’s just me assuming and being ignorant. I told him I was going to try to nap before he had to leave, but our toddler kept busting in, so that didn’t happen either. I ended up doing laundry and cleaning up the kitchen after them. He left for his workout and then came back. 

Yesterday he did give me a nice birthday card, and today he got me a small bundt cake. I appreciate the gestures — they were kind — but I still just feel sad and underappreciated. I think I’m overreacting.",2,1762131233.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

I am from the PNW and looking to move back with my partner. Instead of sharing what we make and asking if it’s “enough,” I’m wondering YOUR experience so we can hear from a larger sample of people :)

What combined salary do you recommend to comfortably live in Portland? I realize this is all very subjective - more to display that we aren’t “fancy folks” who need fancy dinners out. But a full, somewhat modest life full of good people and good community.

Here’s what we mean by “comfortable” 
• Want to buy a house in a walkable, safe neighborhood. Need backyard for dog. (do NOT like new builds, want character, but not a dump/fixer upper)
• Aren’t concerned about having a huge house; do want a nicely kept one with good lighting and perhaps 1,000 sqft
• Love used book stores, coffee shops, Pilates, taking pottery classes, and (obviously) spending time outside 
• One dog, one cat
• Like going to shows
• still want to be able to put cash away in savings

TLDR: What’s YOUR take on a comfortable number to live in a very walkable part of the city.

1omy44s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1omy44s/the_williamstone_triangle_sharpe/,The Williamstone Triangle -Sharpe,"When it rains just right, I think of the Williamstone Triangle. The moisture finds its way into my joints, a cancerous ache that stiffens my limbs and promises a sleepless night, much like it does right now. I watch the fat drops of water splatter across my window, the light of the streetlamps below smudging into fuzzy starbursts. If I focus my eyes, I can see my reflection in the glass: Gray hair, sunken eyes, hard lines etched into my flesh. An old son of a bitch which lived too much life.



My joints aren’t what remind me of the Triangle, it’s not the smell of the dirt or the chill in the air. It’s the sound. The hammering of raindrops on leaves, the chorus of wet crashes against my shoulders as I run. Just above it all, I can hear its feet crashing against the ground as it ran, breathing rapidly and frantic and hungry. 



I suppose it’s a blessing that my knees go rigid when I lie down, shunting me out of any measure of sleep. I know if I fell asleep, I would see it in the dark: all crooked and gaunt as it drooled through thin, split lips. 



Instead of tossing and turning, I sit at the window, sipping coffee to draw its warmth into my chest. Through the dripping glass I watch college kids dip in and out of the Church Street bars, blissfully unaware of what lurked beyond the light of Burlington, out in the woods beyond. I am burdened with that knowledge, and I am endlessly intimate with the information of the Triangle. Year by year it plucks the ripest of us from civilization, and feasts upon them in the comfort of the wilds. 



Tonight, I will share with you that burden, the task of allowing these stories to exist in your mind without letting it consume it entirely. I do not tell these stories out of obligation for the truth, or to warn you of an evil that creeps along the peripheries. I tell you because I have spent the last 70 years of my life suffering from these horrors, and I am done bearing it alone. Tonight, you will suffer along with me.   



Aaron Sharpe was a state trooper for nearly 45 years, a family man with three girls, an adoring wife, and a pudgy little beagle. He was known for his record-setting performances during fishing competitions on Lake Champlain, outdoing himself year after year as he wretched larger and larger bass out of the dark depths of the water. He no doubt fancied himself a guardian, keeping drunks off the road, dragging the drug dealers out of the neighborhoods, and doing it all with a smile under his wide brimmed hat. 



Cops tend to have a complex, a social shield that isn’t unsimilar to the naivety of teenage boys. He was an officer of the law, nothing could touch him. Not the junkies or the poachers or anything in between. No, he was a good man with a spotless record, how could anything hurt him?



The year after his retirement, Officer Sharpe decided to do a solo camping trip up into the Williamstone Triangle. Of course, The Triangle wasn’t The Triangle yet, not enough bodies began popping up at that point to call the area a hotspot. All Williamstone County was known for then was the lushness of the summer canopy, and the tremendous mountains that offered vistas that would make tourists finish in their trousers. No one objected to Sharpe going on the solo trek. It was only for a long weekend, and he was an avid outdoorsman. His wife would have given him a kiss on the cheeks, the girls who still lived in the area would have waved to him as his car pulled out of the development, and none of them would expect to see his body weeks later, decomposed and drained to a husk. 



I don’t know the events leading up to his death, what kind of trail food he ate, where he made camp the first few days, or any of those inconsequential facts. I do know how his final moments played out though, in detail vivid enough to where I could trick myself into thinking I was there. 



I know it started right at dusk, when the sky begins to bleed and the light snuffs out quickly in the woods. Perhaps Sharpe had just started setting his tent up for the evening, perhaps he had just begun to pour himself a tin of whiskey to warm himself up from the approaching night. 



Something approaches him then, gliding across leaf-laden ground as airily as the dark itself. Its breathing was what caught his attention, the wet wheezes that slopped out of the wet holes in its neck and face. Old Aaron looked up then, dropping the tent rods or spilling the liquor over himself as he did. A police officer who spent his whole life looking for hidden needles or concealed knives? Of course he noticed the teeth first, angled and bountiful like the maw of lamprey. 



Sharpe fired five times from the pistol he carried in the gun holster on his thigh; that number was later corroborated when the weapon was found in the leaves by his body. Three bullets were embedded into the tree around the camp site, another shattered against a chunk of slate. The final one was never recovered, perhaps it hit its target, perhaps it didn’t. Never made a difference, the corpse left in the woods wasn’t the Pang’s.      



The old man ran then, running deeper into the woods. He ran away from the nightmare made flesh, but he also ran away from the known trails. Sunlight was snuffed out behind the mountains, causing Sharpe’s vision to fade more and more as he foot slapped against the uneven ground. His last moments were like many other’s, I suspect. Maybe he thought about screwing his wife for the last time, maybe he thought about his daughter’s smiling ear to ear at his retirement party. He certainly didn’t think to watch where he was going. 



Running full speed in the dark, Aaron Sharpe ran headfirst into a dead maple, a snapped branch piercing straight through his flannel and into his chest cavity. The wind was knocked out of his lungs, blood quickly filling the empty space. To his credit, he was able to pull himself off the branch. He staggered a few more feet until the injury caught up with him, and his old knees buckled underneath him. It was then that the Pang caught up to him. 



I remember when Rebecca and I reported to the scene. He was on his back, dull eyes fought to peer through the dense canopy above, but failed. Sharpe wasn’t the first of the bodies we had found in that area by then, so we knew what we were looking for. 



His clothing was ripped around the spot where the tree had stabbed him. His skin was papery and pale, his cheeks gaunt and the flesh clung tightly to the thin tendons and bones. All the blood and fluids in his body were sucked clean out of him. The branch that stabbed him was chewed on, the red pulp of blood scraped clean off the wood.    



At the time, we didn’t know what we were dealing with. Bodies began to pile in the woods in northern Williamstone County, and all of them were traumatic deaths. Sharpe had been the third corpse we found back then, and was the first of many small revelations we made into the Triangle. 



“They’re all old,” Rebecca whispered, “All three of them were elderly.’ 



As time went on, Rebecca’s observation proved to be true time and time again. The woods became a graveyard, corpses splayed across the roots of trees or disappearing from reality altogether. You might be expecting a happy ending, hoping for a resolution to what the killers of Williamstone Triangle are and how they were stopped. The truth is simple, there is no end, no conclusion. The Pangs are still out there, reducing hikers and tourists to smiling faces on missing posters and milk boxes. 



The sun is rising now, I feel the warmth of the light on the windowsill as I lean onto it. The desire I felt to write has quelled now that the memories of the triangle melt away with the shadows. I’ll leave you with the uncertainty of what skitters through the trees, what drips onto the roots and the rails of the woods. Maybe if we’re unfortunate enough, I’ll be back with more nightmares to relieve and share.

Bitwise is one of the big players in the space, and their CEO predicts a tidal wave of Wall Street investment into crypto over the next year. Here's the scoop:  
1. Bitwise is betting on ETFs and other investment vehicles to make crypto more palatable for the traditional finance crowd.  
2. The growing interest from big institutions hints at a potential shift in how these markets operate.  
3. If this prediction pans out, we might see crypto become as mainstream as your morning coffee.

Sex : Male

Weight: 65KG (up from 63 the past 2 years).

Height : 181cm

Prior Diagnosis : Internal hemorrhoids, Low ferritin, Low hemoglobin.

Hello, so a few months ago I had a situation where I used the bathroom and strained very hard (I was in a hurry). The next day I noticed a little bit of blood in my stool and called the doctor who prescribed me with Anodan HC suppositories. 

A week later I had a massive explosive bleed, basically the whole toilet was covered in blood. After this I noticed an extreme burning sensation around the rectum. I then scheduled an appointment with my family doctor who gave me an actual physical check for hemorrhoids and confirmed that's what I had, but he then ordered a blood test to make sure I was fine.

A week later I had another slight bleed after I stopped taking the original medication since it was incredibly uncomfortable (severe burning got worse any time I used it). With that, I started to improve my diet and taking metamucil. I work lifting very heavy things and at the time I took a week and a half vacation, no more bleeds since then (noticeable ones at least). However my doctor called me telling me I was extremely anemic with an hb level of 81 g/L.

He told me to go to the ER where I got an iron transfusion and a prescription of one month of Ferramax, along with another confirmation that I have an internal hemorrhoid. However, they ordered a colonoscopy for me in 3 months.

I got another blood test a week later where I had an HB level of 107 g / L. I feel much better, a lot of energy and no bleeds, no problems at all. I finished my ferramax and 2 months later got another blood test, but now it's at 91 g/L.

This recent blood test told me I don't have Celiacs, but now the dip in my Hemoglobin levels is scaring me...


I feel asymptomatic, no stomach pain, no weight loss, I actually gained some weight, no shortness of breath, no high heart rate, no bloody looking stools. All I have is a burning sensation around the rectum if I lift heavy. I also have a very good appetite, but I was well known in my friend group for the past few years as the guy who barely ate.

My job involves heavy lifting, I drink a cup of coffee in the morning, eat a lot of lactose products which I hear both block non heme iron absorption. What do you think they might find at the colonoscopy? I just need someone to talk to about this. I don't know, some advice? Words of encouragement telling me it's probably/hopefully something simple?

I'll answer any questions, but yeah, I'm at a loss right now. The day I took my blood test for the 81 g/ L I walked/ran a full 18 holes at my local golf course carrying my bag on my shoulders, I did have pale lips at the time, but apart from that and a fast heart rate I felt fine. The pale lips and fast heart rate are gone now.

*Instead of the usual monotone voice of a young Dr. Eterna, a woman probably in her late 30’s or early 40’s spoke with a European accent, most likely a British colleague.*

“This is Log-238 of the Dawnbreak Project, current date is September 18, 2007 marking the third year of its production. It has been approximately 3 months, and 14 days since Log-238 of the project but major progress has been made. The Dawnbreak Drones have always encountered one major problem throughout the several models made in the past which was core overheating, and turned the Drones into a bloody walking bomb. Our field scientist and head engineer, Dr. Eterna has found a solution to permanently fix the issue which will save us millions of dollars for funding and resources for the project. Despite this major breakthrough, we began to experience more issues mainly towards weight distribution, and the knees hydraulics and joint servos breaking under pressure. Pistons are snapping at 20,000 psi, knee servos are deforming under stationary and moving conditions, digital systems, and power distribution grids are frying under the new core upgrades, and too much to list.""

Dr. Eterna: ""January 3, New Year was just the other day, Dr. ~~Artemis~~. Perhaps I should take over for today's log, you look weary..""

""Ah, yes.. January 3, 2012. No need to worry, Doctor, I'm still in tip-top shape. But moving on, we've managed to solve the hydraulics and joint issues focused on the knees, and the ankles of the Drones by modifying the brake and lock system which allows the knee to bend and stay stationary for prolonged periods of time. Creating a new brake disc with a more reinforced alloy, similar to the ones fitted onto the shoulder blast guards, and hydraulics were later replaced with modified industrial grade which seem to handle the intense weight and pressure more effectively. We decided to replace some of the internal hardware of the Drone, primarily the power distribution grids being analog, and replacing the current digital software with simplified and outdated technology. It may sound like a downgrade, but it has proven to be extremely effective, and chances of it getting hijacked from an external source through various methods have dropped. Next log will be the first phase of the weapons testing of these Dawnbreak Drones.""

""This is Log-242 for the Dawnbreak Project. Current date is April 27, 2012, and today marks the first phase of weapons testing. The main Drone model we'll be using is the Helios, equipped with twin shoulder-mounted containing 4 4x2 missile pods each containing a CBU-105 cluster missiles, 2x6 smoke grenade launchers mounted on the shins with semi auto reloading capability, external outer armor designed for frontal assault, naval and aerial bombardment, and arm mounted tri-barreled napalm flamethrowers. The Helios models we're designed to be accompanied by the future Camelot Fortress models currently in the first phases of basic testing, if the Helios is the Sword, the Camelots will be the shields.""

Turin SD40S or the Varia VS3?","I am less than a week into owning an espresso machine for the first time (Breville Bambino Plus) and have already realized that having the ability to grind my own beans will make my life easier. 

Machine was delivered earlier than anticipated and I was so excited to use it, and all I had on hand was Bustelo: pulled a technically perfect shot no problem.

I was excited to try to replicate a drink I like that uses a light roast and went to the coffee shop, got a pound of the roast I wanted, asked them to grind for espresso. Get home and try it out: shot was under extracted. Like just a couple drips of espresso would come out. I tried 4 more times adjusting the amount of espresso, how much/little I tamped. No change; it was definitely the grind size. So frustrating.

So, I am kind of split between getting a Turin SD40S or the Varia VS3 and was curious about people’s opinions between the two. As a data point: I am not trying to use only light roast espresso, I like a wide variety. Is one of these machines better than the other?

Also, curiosity lead me to try buying another pound of the same beans, but asked them to grind it coarser (3 vs 1). I mixed 11g of the finer grind and 6g of the coarser and loaded it up: finally pulled. Probably not the best quality shots of all time, but not bad and at least I can use it! Lol.

I’ll oversimplify and say I’m the personal assistant to a local politician. Not the coffee-runs kind, but the go-through-your-emails-and-see-what-I-can-fix kind. And that’s the whole point: I don’t feel like I can fix enough for the above average wage I’m making.

I want to clear up that I’m not the stereotypical political personnel that’s paid to sit on their hands all day. There’s stuff I do that, according to my boss, no one does better. I’m his go-to man when it comes to the budgets (which can be tricky), I’m tasked with political communication and I’m very good when it comes to linking local problems with solutions from a higher level.

1omxo5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/CuriousAF/comments/1omxo5m/advice_how_to_actually_remember_what_you_read/,[Advice] How to actually remember what you read (instead of just finishing books),"Have you ever finished a book just to realize 3 days later you remember absolutely nothing? Like, you raced to the last chapter, felt kind of proud, maybe even posted it on Goodreads… but could barely explain what it was about if someone asked. Yeah, this isn’t just you. I’ve seen this with way too many friends, professionals, even myself.

We consume more “knowledge” than any generation before. But retention? Application? Depth? Not keeping up. Blame it on toxic productivity, dopamine-chasing on TikTok, or that weird obsession with 30 books a year reading challenges. Reading has become performative. But real learning is slow, sticky, and a little messy.

This post is for anyone who’s serious about getting smarter—not just better at finishing books. I went deep on this. Pulled ideas from cognitive science, learning psychology, performance coaching, and even military strategy (yeah, weirdly useful). Here’s how to actually *retain* and *apply* what you read.

1. **Don’t just read. Process.**
  
   You’re not supposed to read like it’s a sprint. Dr. Barbara Oakley, author of *A Mind for Numbers*, says that for real learning to stick, you need what she calls ""diffused mode"" thinking—time for your brain to wander, absorb, and connect dots. So after a dense paragraph or chapter, stop. Don’t scroll. Don’t move on. Let ideas marinate. Close the book. Space out. Maybe journal.

2. **The Feynman Trick still slaps.**

   Richard Feynman, Nobel Prize-winning physicist, had a way of testing if he truly understood something: explain it to a 12-year-old. No jargon. No fluff. It works because teaching forces recall + synthesis. After you read something, try explaining it in 3 sentences to yourself, a friend, or out loud in the shower. If you can’t, go back and re-read.

3. **Make your brain *find* the info again.**

   This is called “active recall” and it’s the most powerful memory tool known. Benedict Carey, in *How We Learn*, explains that testing yourself (without peeking at notes) builds stronger memory than review. So after reading, close the book. Ask yourself what you just learned. Sketch a diagram. Quiz yourself next day. Make your brain work for it.

4. **Use spaced repetition or forget it all.**

   Your memory decays fast unless you *review* at the right intervals. The spacing effect is well-researched (check: Cepeda et al., 2006 in *Psychological Science*). Helpful apps like Anki or Readwise take over this painful part. They remind you to review key points across days, weeks, and even months.

5. **Add friction. Reading should be interactive.**

   Passive reading = temporary memory. But interacting with text—writing marginalia, underlining, even arguing with the author—creates stickiness. In *The Art of Learning*, Josh Waitzkin (chess prodigy turned martial arts champ) talks about “mistake-driven learning.” That means you should engage with confusion, not avoid it.

6. **Don’t jump books. Build mental bridges.**

   Read a few books around the same topic. Connect them. This builds “scaffolded knowledge.” Example: if you read *Atomic Habits* by James Clear, follow it with *Deep Work* by Cal Newport or *The Power of Habit* by Charles Duhigg. Now your brain spots overlap, contrast, and patterns. That’s how experts form mental models.

7. **Try to make learning addictive.**

   Most of us open social apps 20 times a day, but not a book. Why? Because books rarely give dopamine hits. Change that. Use habit stacking: pair your reading with a treat like coffee. Read 10 pages before bed. Use an app that makes it feel like progress. Here’s what helped me the most...

8. **I recommend checking out the app Shortform.**

   Shortform gives you insanely high-quality book guides that include summaries, key ideas, and exercises. But what I like most is their emphasis on *retention*. They add “smart insights” that connect one book to others, and encourage you to explain or apply what you learned. It’s great if you want to review what you read once a week without rereading the whole book.

9. **Readwise for spaced rep of your highlights.**

   This app doesn’t just save your Kindle notes—it actually *shows them back to you* each day. So those insights you underlined from that psych book 2 months ago? They come back. You can even tag, search, and organize everything. It takes almost zero effort but feels like knowledge is compounding in your brain.

10. **BeFreed helps you build a personalized learning stack.**

   If you’re someone who wants to learn deeply but doesn’t have hours to read each night, this app’s insane. It turns books, expert talks, and research—across psychology, self-improvement, business, etc.—into short podcast-style explainers tailored to you. You pick how long each episode is (10, 20, 40 min), and even choose the host style and voice.

   But what’s wild is that BeFreed *learns* from what you engage with. It builds an adaptive study plan based on your interest, retention style, and goals. It gradually deepens your understanding over time. Think of it like having an AI coach feeding you what you need to know, when you’re most likely to remember and apply it.

   They’ve got a massive library that includes everything I recommended in this post, and more. I use it right before bed or during walks. Instead of doom-scrolling, I do “10-minute idea downloads,” which add up fast. A year of 1% daily learning = a totally different brain.

11. **This book will make you question how you learn anything.**

   *Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning* by Brown, Roediger, and McDaniel. It’s not just a bestseller, it’s used in elite education programs and military training. The authors are cognitive scientists who bust myths about learning (like rereading or highlighting). They show how struggle and failure actually build stronger memory. 

   This is the best memory and learning science book I’ve ever read. After this, I totally changed how I take notes, study, and revisit ideas. If you’ve ever felt like you “don’t have a good memory,” this book will change that belief. Insanely good read.

12. **This podcast made me rethink my brain entirely.**

   *Huberman Lab* by Dr. Andrew Huberman. Especially the episodes on neuroplasticity, dopamine, and learning optimization. He breaks down science-backed tactics in a way that’s super practical. Like how to use light, movement, or breathing to boost learning retention. I recommend starting with “Using Failures, Movement & Balance to Learn Faster.”

13. **This YouTube channel is a cheat code for active learning.**

   Ali Abdaal’s videos on “Evidence-based studying” and “How I remember what I read” are packed with frameworks, apps, and systems. He’s a former doctor turned educator, so his focus is on high-efficiency learning. Also, he shows his actual note-taking system—which helped me fix mine.

14. **Don’t aim to finish the book. Aim to *own* the idea.**

   The best readers aren’t the fastest. They are the ones who walk away with one or two insights they *never forget*. If a book changes how you think or act in one area of life, that’s a win. Forget the book count. Build a collection of ideas that shape who you are.

1omxnnp,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/1omxnnp/traumatic_experiences_on_property/,Traumatic Experiences on Property,"I've been reading a lot of the stories today and definitely took a trip down memory lane about my time working at a hotel. There were a couple of experiences I had that were pretty shocking and traumatic. 

The first I have commented about before - a high school basketball team was in town for a tournament. The morning after the tournament, I was working the front desk, and the lobby started filling with the team members who were all freaking out and crying. It turns out, their coach had died in his room overnight. Apparently he had a cold or the flu, and mixed medications that caused him to have a heart attack due to underlying conditions (found this out later). It was tough for me, as a kid barely older than the team, to try to help them navigate this situation. 

The other incident was with a sweet old man who had been staying on property for about a week. he always came down for a cup of coffee and some toast, and would chit chat with me talking about his granddaughter who was around my age and cracking jokes. I came in one morning, and the night auditor told me the day before (my day off), the man had passed away in his room. He had a the ""please tidy the room"" hangtag, and housekeeping found him dead in a chair when they went in. The housekeeper was completely shattered by that experience (she was also just in her early 20s). 

The last incident was a robbery at gunpoint. I was at the sister property across the parking lot that night, and suddenly cops were swarming in. It was just by chance that the robber chose the other hotel and not mine to hit that night. 

All of these things (among others) helped solidify my decision to nope out of working at hotels.

1omxmd6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1omxmd6,Amy’s Diary — Sunday: The Dance at the Park,"Dear Diary,
The sun was shining beautifully this morning — bright, gentle, and warm like a perfect November Sunday. After all the Halloween and birthday excitement, Mom decided we all needed some “fresh air and exercise.”
But with my family, that always means one thing: dancing.

Vicky led the way, of course. She wore her casual red top and jeans again — the same one from last night’s party — and somehow looked just as graceful as she does in her studio.
Mom said, “You can’t even take a day off from dancing, can you?”
Vicky smiled and replied, “Dancing is my day off.”


---

We packed sandwiches, cupcakes, and a big picnic blanket and headed to Sunnyville Central Park. The place was full of people — kids flying kites, joggers, couples taking photos under the golden trees. The fountain sparkled under the sunlight, and there were still a few leftover Halloween decorations hanging from the lampposts.

Vicky brought a small speaker and started playing cheerful pop music.
“Alright everyone,” she said, clapping her hands, “let’s stretch! Even you, Amy.”
I sighed and joined in — even though stretching right after cupcakes is… not my strength.

“Arms up, belly in!” she teased with a smirk.
“Vicky!” I groaned, and all my sisters burst into laughter.
But honestly, I didn’t mind. It felt so nice to laugh together after such a busy week.


---

Then something funny happened — while we were dancing, Carmen, Kira, Penny, Winfrey, Siu Ling, and Monique appeared at the other side of the park!
They were having an ice-cream break after helping clear up the school festival decorations.
“Hey, Amy!” they shouted and waved.
I ran over, nearly tripping on the grass, and told them, “We’re doing a family dance picnic!”

Of course, Vicky spotted them and invited everyone to join.
Soon, half the park was clapping along — my sisters, my friends, random strangers, even a few kids from Coffee Day!
Zoe happened to pass by too, carrying a tray of takeaway lattes for her staff. She laughed and said, “Now this is how Sunnyville celebrates!”


---

After the dancing, we all sat on the blanket to rest.
Vicky was leaning back, eyes half-closed, listening to the music softly playing in the background.
Mom smiled at her and said, “You’ve grown into such a beautiful, responsible woman.”
Vicky opened one eye and joked, “You mean cold-hearted and bossy?”
We all laughed — but I could see Mom’s proud smile.

Before leaving, we took a big group photo — the nine of us plus my friends, all smiling in the sunlight, with the park and mountains behind us.


---

When we got home, Vicky started teaching me a simple dance routine for fun. She said,

> “You don’t need to be perfect, Amy. Just move like you mean it.”
That actually sounded… kind of deep.
And for the first time, I realized maybe her teasing isn’t really teasing — it’s her way of showing love.



It’s been a beautiful weekend — Halloween, laughter, dancing, and family.
Tomorrow, school starts again, but tonight, I feel like everything is still glowing softly in my heart.

Love,
Amy 🌼✨",1,1762129710.0,u_FunRestaurant3384,0,1.0,False

i had a late peak on my 3-hour glucose test so my OB wants me to test 2h after every meal. the problem is that i realize i don't really go in that many 2 hour blocks of time without eating anything except water. i will have stuff like popcorn beside my office desk and take a bite every few minutes, or be sipping a latte or other drink, or be tasting things while cooking or unpacking groceries. ok, obviously some of that i can control, but wanted to ask what people do in a couple of examples in particular: 

* i usually drink a cappuccino or latte (with half the amount of caffeine that i usually do) on weekday mornings and like to take sips while working. should i 1) switch to a smaller drink that i can drink quickly like a cortado? 2) test 2 hours from the start of my breakfast even if i was drinking my regular coffee drink for 30min past the meal for example? 3) have my normal drink but wait and test 2 hours AFTER i finish my coffee? 
* i sometimes slip up and have a taste of something before dinner, for example, when i'm supposed to be counting 2 hours post-afternoon-snack. let's say i taste part of the meal we were cooking or someone offers me a bite of something and i eat it before i remember. obviously this will get better with time, but if this happens, am i supposed to consider that post-snack glucose reading to be void and just skip that one? or take the glucose anyway but know that it might be higher?

Pre-entery 

I don't know where to start from, my mental health or what has happened to me recently, it's all a mess. Sorry for not introducing myself, I'm Francis Porter, I'm a 30 year old man who has been going through some horrifying things. 

I work as a night guard here in zhven, It's a minimum wage job but peace can't be bought at least not for me. Though I often times like to go down and stroll around in the mountains of the city and the woods that It has, it's one way to remove the loneliness from my life. 

Chapter 1

November 14th a day off for me, it was a Sunday.
At around 2 am it was just me in the woods sitting by a rock, when it started to stream in my mind, the voice of a disaster. It wanted everything and anything, it was desperate and frantic even and suddenly suicidal. 

I knew it didn't belong in my head but somehow it's here... It spoke to me ""C'mon do it, jump in the bonfire"" it kept repeating itself over and over while I tried to control myself and restrain from any decision that I may regret in the future. 

I decided to walk around with the torch of my phone on, it still kept nagging me ""You missed a good opportunity!"" I tried ignoring it, like a broken cd player it continued with the same sentences again and again. 

I was starting to feel numb to it, right then I heard a scream, my mouth shut and my body froze while I looked around to see any possible movements, there were none.

After what felt like ages I could finally rest in my mind, It was close to dawn so I decided to track back home, I was still shaken from this experience though I brush it off and continue whilst listening to music on my way home.

Halfway there I could make out a figure in the distance, From the darkness that the trees upholded I couldn't find a face. I walked cautiously but in fear. 

The figure spoke ""Hey Francis, it's me your co-worker. I recognised his voice and approached him, it was truly him, he was missing one of his front teeth. 

""Hey Tony, you had me there"" He laughed and said ""Didn't mean to scare you, though beware of the dark, don't become a friend of it, it will bite you"" I felt unsettled after what happened and this wasn't helping me, I told him good night and continued my journey home.

When I finally reached there, I was relieved to find comfort and a safe spot to rest. Had a thought maybe I shouldn't go to the woods or mountains anymore, I fell asleep mid discussion of that thought.

Chapter 2

November 22nd a Monday late night. 
I was just starting my shift, got the keys to the surveillance office in the hallway, and like that I went into the room, it was full of cigarette smoke. I guess my co-workers were heavi smoking.

And then it hit me when it was 2 am again, the same voice comes back and decides to annoy me repeatedly. I just look at the camera monitors and try to turn my head off but it doesn't work. It manages to grab my attention fully.

Shiver crawled over my spin when the office door behind me slowly opened and a loud scream ""I know you"" I anxiously got up and rushed with a gun in hand but there was nobody there.

I managed to relax myself with some water and called a friend over the phone, he talked me into calming myself, I really thank him for that. Otherwise it would have been a nightmare to be alone with whoever roams in my head every now and then. I started to develop a fear of being alone... slowly.

I fell asleep and jumped out of my seat when my co-workers woke me up in the morning ""Hey buddy relax it's us. I saw the team and burst out laughing out of relief. "" Oh guys it's great seeing you all here"" I was happy to not be alone.

I went home and slept again, I was exhausted and mentally drained. Oh well this is the nature of my job, while people sleep I stay wide awake.
I guess I gotta introduce coffee into my life is what I thought.....
Right?

Chapter 3

November 24th Wednesday, As usual I went to work though on my way there. I started to feel anxious and pre-alarmed for something that I had no idea of. Out of nothing and nowhere I was scared of solitude, and then it hit me. 

""Why all this effort for nothing? Just end it"" It spoke to me like a fly near my ear. My body started to tense up and I was sweating as I thought and thought about it. 

I found myself running to work, when I got inside my co-worker which was Tony during that shift seemed worried like there was something he saw in me. 

""Are you okay Francis? Do you need water or something? Your face is a picture"" He squinted his eyes as he was trying to read me but couldn't quite figure me out, and then I decided to speak up.

""Nothing to worry about (I laughed nervously) just a few street dogs gathered courage to chase me to work today, eh how's you?"" 

I could see relieve in his eyes as he sat back in his chair and then everything was alright, he left though he said something that I still think about.

""Listen carefully to what kind of barks those dogs make, they could be signalling something. Though enjoy that chair for 8 hours"" We both laughed and he went....I couldn't stop thinking about what he meant.

Did he know? Was he aware of such a presence in my mind? I started to form all sorts of questions that I didn't have answers, heck I thought I was mentally ill or unstable.

I decided to occupy myself with work and sleep whenever I could to get myself away from all of this. I didn't rest much as unusual sounds kept waking me up, doors opening and closing, old tv sounds in the hallways of the building...I started to ask myself is there someone here? 

It should only be me here, perhaps a co-worker forgot something and so I didn't bother to check and went back to sleep.

As I slept away till the end of my shift, in my dreams I saw myself running around whilst people yelled at me...one in particular in a dusty black coat and a hat with red eyes kept looking at me. It let out such a loud yell that I still twitch from it....

I woke up abruptly from the dream, And after a few moments I noticed a paper on my desk, it read out ""You'd be needing a new pair of eyes if I wasn't so kind"" 

At first I thought it was a joke but as I checked the surveillance monitors and patrolled around, I saw nobody and there were no footprints on the ground and no door was opened.

What was I dealing with? I find myself engraved in the fears of something that I couldn't identify or figure out, apart from calling myself crazy.
I decided yet again to side away these things and go home....I really needed to sleep as I felt exhausted even though I slept at work...
Felt terrible that night, I wondered why?

Chapter 4

November 31st Wednesday, waking up as usual as it gets. I can say for one week I was free from anyone and anything, I went to work with music in my ears. 

Tony smiled and pat me on the back.
""In a good mood today huh?"" 
I replied ""Absolutely!"" and there he went.

I found myself doodling on a random notebook that I had on the table, we kept a lot of small notebooks in the office. We need them if there was something we need to write, I decided to go through them... nothing just work related stuff until I went through a certain page.

What I read turned my face pale,
""I watch and watch, left to right and up to bottom. I know your strolls and walks around the city and woods"" 

I never told anyone that I spent time in the woods, where did they get this information from?....then a door opened in my head...it entered the reddish demon, the voice.

""Why live in misery when you can give up and find peace? Perhaps you'll be more content somewhere else"" 

It repeated itself at least three times until I started saying ""stop, stop, stop and get out of my head. I could see random creatures in the office moving around and smiling at me, I wasn't sure what to make of it. 

Was I hallucinating all of this? Can't be I'm not insane or sleep deprived, I thought to myself.
I kept just looking at them until one of them decided to charge at me with lightish speed and a ferocious growl, I managed duck it and run out of the office and outside the building. 

I was gasping for oxygen as I was outside in the strobe lights of the city shining at me, I was constantly looking back and forth. Paranoid of what could surround and devour me, like an ant.

I proceed to sit on a random bench at the park, wasn't far from work. I knew I had to get back in but decided to give myself a break from that asylum of hell. Heck I was even thinking about resigning from work.

Though something occupied my mind, the monster's eyes, they grew and shrinked...its smile faded and re-appeared spontaneously. I was left in debt for words as I couldn't make a case between reality and fantasy.

What did I take with me from the woods or mountains? The fact that I met Tony there all alone and that he threw something at me when I told him about the dogs..left me thinking, it felt like he knew something or he was ""something"". 

Though after a while of dwelling there on the bench I got up and decided to head back, I entered the building cautiously only to find nothing whilst checking every room like a moron.

There was truly nothing even when I reached the office, I didn't even think about sleeping there. I just waited for the shift to end, felt like an eternity but he finally came and I left. 

Even though it was dawn I kept looking around and walked cautiously or till home, I felt something was watching me but with my eyes I couldn't find anything. 

I got in my house, looked around and found nothing. I locked the all the doors and slept with the lights on that night, I wasn't in the bravest mood.

I guess even the strongest and fearless men shake from the unknown? Perhaps I knew this thing? 

Chapter 5

December 3rd Saturday,
 Yet again another wave of nightmares comes my way, I see demonized figures follow me around the city in my dreams. 

I wake up in sweat and screams, After a few minutes I calm down. I get up and decide to head out to work.

""What's the point of this anyways"" 
There's the oddly familiar voice that never seems to leave me, desperately suicidal.
It wanted the worst for me on a consistent basis but I never gave in, though it never quit.
I guess I was a pro in ignoring it.

Cleared my head and managed to side it to a corner, I felt watched on my way to work but I also ignored that. 

I got there and saw Tony smiling, 
I spoke ""You're too happy today, what's the cause?"" 
He replied shortly with a smirk on his face
""Probably a bonfire with a witch"" 

At first I didn't get it, before I could say anything he got up and left me with a pat on my back.
I said to myself ""This guy is one weird mess"" 
I proceeded to sit in the same old chair for the remaining 8 hours of my shift, boring ones but paid ones.

Not much happened but I often found myself thinking about Tony and how he was behaving, something felt and seemed off.

A strange though suggested I'd go to the woods, It remained unclear what's there but I had a gut feeling.
Firstly I needed to get some sleep at home and take a bath.

I got home from work and slept for like 5 hours and then woke up and took a bath, I was all set for my walk around the trees of fate but I could see something in the window's of my room. 

Glowing red eyes with bloody hands on it and noticeable white teeth, those teeth were ones the size of a horse.

It screamed ferociously and growled, I closed my eyes and put my fingers in my ears, I couldn't take it anymore. 

And after a few moments it stopped, I couldn't see it anymore, there's something or someone messing with me but I have no clue.
Until I go to the tallest trees in town.

*-Writing-*

Francis's fate a red raining mess of fanatic deviation.
His eyes of no harm done wrong, the commitment to righteousness torn apart.

The portlands call upon ancestors to help repell the waves that he can't escape.
Unfortunately they gave way and he's abandoned in his own grave.
Promised land? promised words.

Chapter 6

December 4th Sunday, day off as usual.
I decided to go to the woods with earbuds in my ears, listening to music made the darkness of the night less scary.

As I walked around I felt a suffocating notion like something was ambushing me or that a bad presence was there.
And there it came
""This is where we met and here we shall depart"" The weirdsh voice of death wishing upon my confused brain.

Something inside of me pushed me to reply loudly in the woods, 
""Leave me alone, get out of my head""
It laughed maniacally and I could feel something move in the bushes...What could have possible caused all of this? 

I thought to myself in the burning wood of the bonfire, I kept looking at the bushes but nothing came out of it.

I was really considering being unstable until I felt a soft grip on my shoulders, I turn rapidly and see Tony with the biggest grin I've ever seen and he spoke with the same voice that I had in my head.
""We finally met each other""

I pushed him into the bonfire and sprinted and rushed till I could see the large buildings of the town, I didn't want to look back but eventually i did and I didn't see anyone.... only black smoke in the air.
Perhaps I burnt him and whatever bad he did to me? 

I reach home, I march in and close all doors and windows. I was curious to see what happened to him so I called him...they say curiosity killed the cat and the same is happening to me.

I dial his phone but it says that the number doesn't exist.... strange, I call my colleagues and they say that a guy named Tony is unknown to them.

I was baffled but couldn't be happier, though I felt the need to record this whole situation if anything did happen to me in the future.

May this pre-recorded be useful to whoever finds it, Of course if I'm no longer here.
""Screams fade in the distance as the port's waves rise and fall""

Two poles but which is you? 
The one with the silky smooth flow that naturally drives you to the madness of the calmness?

These two with a tin make an absolutely satisfying meal, though. The hearty crunch of the bagel chip under the fatty savoriness of the fish finishes off with the citrusy pop of dill and ACV, all with a garlic and Old Bay finish.

1omxjyq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1omxjyq/epi_pen_injury_possible_secondary_anaphylaxis30f/,Epi pen injury & possible secondary anaphylaxis?(30F),"Hello. I’m a 30F with a complicated medical history, but most relevant here is Mast Cell Activation Syndrome, Oral Allergy Syndrome, allergic asthma, CIU, recurring sinus infections, and POTS. I had a scary anaphylaxis incident yesterday after drinking a Starbucks coffee with cinnamon dolce syrup (I’ve never reacted to cinnamon before, so I’m wondering if my drink was cross-contaminated with nuts because I do have moderate-severe allergic reactions to peanuts, pistachios, and hazelnut) that resulted in me having to use my Epi pen on myself, which I’ve only self-administered one other time (I’m scared of needles and have vasovagal syncope with needles/shots/blood). I was home alone, so I had no other choice but to self-administer and my throat was rapidly closing up. I called 911 and the operator said I needed to use the Epi pen immediately instead of waiting for first responders. I was really shaky and panicked, so i just blindly stabbed myself in what I thought was my outer thigh, but actually turned out to be outer leg area, closer to my knee. 

The Epi still worked-I held the pen in for a long count of three & until I heard the click-and I know it worked because my airway immediately opened up (plus I experienced all the Epi side effects of high BP, tachycardia, and shaking/tremors). I first figured that I may have incorrectly injected when I didn’t bleed-I always bleed through my pants with Epi injection. I also felt a level 8/10 pain in the side of my leg (more intense than just soreness). I later discovered a 6 inch long brownish bruise. It hurt so badly that the pain woke me up from deep sleep. I took Tylenol and put ice on it, which helped some. Now, most of the severe pain is gone, but the area is numb. I do not feel sensation there when scratching (compared to my left leg). This all happened on a weekend, so I’m going to call my allergy doctor first thing in the morning, but now I’m worried about nerve damage.

Yesterday evening, I went to the ER via ambulance and received oxygen en route (my vitals were fine, but I was still coughing and wheezing a bit after the Epi), and at the ER I got IV Pepcid, IV Solu-medrol, and IV lactated ringers. I felt a lot better for a few hours (my HR finally calmed down to the 70’s and my BP was 112/78), but I was at the ER for so long that I felt a reoccurrence of the allergic reaction right as I was preparing to be discharged last night around 10:45 pm. But I didn’t speak up because I just wanted to go home and figured I could manage it on my own at home (I have 2 other Epi pens and a bunch of rescue allergy meds. Plus, this isn’t my first rodeo with anaphylaxis 😬). Second phase of allergic reaction that started around 10:30/45ish (my initial reaction was around 5:00 pm, used my Epi pen around 5:40pm): my throat began itching, I had other itching (ears and head), facial flushing, and tachycardia returned (highest HR was 130, so not terrible) and BP dipped, but only to 99/78. I was scared/unsure if I should do more Epi, so I didn’t give myself a second round. I took an additional 25mg Benadryl (already had 50mg late afternoon) and 25mg Hydroxyzine. I also took 10mg Zyrtec. I regularly take 20mg Zyrtec and 20mg Pepcid at night as part of my allergy regimen, but I was worried about overdoing it, so I did not have my additional Pepcid dose or the full 20mg Zyrtec. The itching in my throat eventually went away, but I woke up this morning very congested and wheezy. Today, I’ve taken my usual 20mg Zyrtec and 20mg Pepcid,used my 2x daily Simbicort inhaler, Primatene mist inhaler, and Atrovent inhaler. I didn’t get much relief from all those, so I took 20mg Prednisone that I have on hand for allergic reactions. I don’t feel like I need to return to the ER, but I’m still really uncomfortable. I just need some reassurance and advice until I’m able to get a hold of my doctor. Thanks 🙏.",1,1762129527.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False

If you grew up in the early 2000s, you probably watched SpongeBob like I did — not just casually, but the way a kid worships cartoons. Old Nickelodeon had this weird vibe… surreal and a little too dark beneath the surface. But nothing ever freaked me out as badly as what I found last year.

I collect retro media — VHS tapes, cartridges, anything that looks like it doesn’t belong in this decade. So when a thrift shop near the outskirts of Austin put out a stack of Nickelodeon promos, I nearly tripped over myself grabbing them. Most were commercials and pilots, but buried between *Rugrats* and *Fairly OddParents* tapes was one with a black marker label:

**Club Spongebob’s Ritual**

No art. No Nickelodeon branding. Just a sticky orange label peeling off.

When I brought it to the counter, the cashier — an old man with salt-soaked hair — stared at the tape for a long time. His lips tensed like he was trying not to say something.

“Those tapes came from an estate sale,” he muttered.  
“Owner was a cartoonist. Died near the coast. They found him tangled in seaweed miles inland.”

I laughed nervously. He didn’t.

He slid the tape toward me like he wanted it gone.

 

Back home, I set up my dusty VCR. The tape clicked in, the screen filled with static, and a title card appeared — but it wasn’t the familiar blue bubbly font.

White text on a black screen read:

**CLUB SPONGEBOB RITUAL**

PROTOTYPE ARCHIVE  
DO NOT DISTRIBUTE

There was no Hawaiian music — just a low, oceanic rumble. The episode opened with SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward in the treetop clubhouse… but something felt **wrong**.

The background was darker. Colors were washed-out like the whole world was dying. And the characters didn’t move with the usual bouncy animation — their motions were stiff… jittery… almost like stop-motion puppets.

SpongeBob turned to Patrick with that trademark grin, but his eyes were enormous — too human, too reflective.

“The Shell knows what we need,” he whispered.

Not *Magic Conch*.  
The **Shell.**

Squidward was pacing in the corner, stroking his arms like he was freezing.

“I just want to go home,” he muttered.

 

Patrick held up the conch — but its holes were wrong. There were too many. They pulsed like gills.

SpongeBob asked:

“Can Squidward go home now?”

Patrick shook the Shell.

Instead of the usual goofy *Noooo*, a voice hissed through the speakers — layered and bubbling:

**“He belongs here.”**

Squidward snapped.

“What the hell is wrong with you?! This isn’t funny! I can’t feel my legs—”

The camera panned down.

His feet were **rooted** into the wood. Barnacles crawled up his ankles, forcing themselves under his skin. His flesh bruised and swelled, tendons tightening like ropes.

He screamed — not comedic panic… but blood-curdling pain.

Patrick and SpongeBob didn’t react. They just stared. Wide-eyed.

“The Shell says stay,”  
SpongeBob whispered, voice distorted and glitching.

 

Squidward tore himself free, leaving strips of purple skin behind. He tried to climb down — but the animation shifted into first person point of view shot. The viewer was now **Squidward**.

Kelp rose like skeletal fingers. Dark silhouettes moved behind the stalks — tall, lanky figures with seaweed hair and hollow sockets where eyes should be.

One figure loomed closer, tilting its head, cracking vertebrae like snapping driftwood.

Its voice was Squidward’s.  
But deeper. Broken. Echoing.

**“Please don’t leave… please…”**

Squidward ran — or tried to. His limbs dragged like they were underwater. The environment kept looping — the same coral, the same rocks, like the forest itself was a maze.

It was a prison.

Cut back to the treetop.

Patrick leaned very slowly toward the screen.

His eyes were gaping holes — inside them, spirals of raw flesh rotating inward, like a whirlpool of meat.

“Your turn,” he said.

 

Then SpongeBob faced the viewer — face filling the entire screen.

His pores looked too detailed. Too real. Yellow flesh glistened with mucus. His smile twitched violently, stretching further than it should.

“We know you’re there,” he said.

I froze.

His pupils locked onto mine — not like a cartoon looking outwards, but like a living thing recognizing a living thing.

I tried pausing. Nothing happened.

Tried stopping. No effect.

The Shell was heard again. But the voice didn’t come from the TV this time…

It came from **behind me**.

*Rattle… rattle… rattle…*

I turned.

Nothing.

Back to the screen — SpongeBob was inches from the camera now. Every time I blinked, he got closer without any cutting animation.

“The Shell can hear you breathing,” he whispered.

I wasn’t breathing anymore.

 

 

There was a static.

Then: a wide shot.

Rows of ancient tiki idols jutted from the seafloor — their carved faces contorted in agony.

One idol stared directly into the camera with drooping, terrified eyes.

Squidward’s eyes.

His mouth was chiseled open in a frozen scream. Coral worms wriggled inside, silencing him forever.

SpongeBob and Patrick stood beside him like proud cultists.

“Everyone gets a place,” SpongeBob said.  
“There’s room for you, too. You just need to join us”

The camera began zooming toward an empty idol — its face was blank, waiting to be carved.

Waiting for mine.

My pulse hit my throat. My skin prickled. I bolted for the VCR.

But before I could reach it…

The Shell’s voice hissed again.

**“Sit and Watch.”**

My legs buckled. Not like a panic response — like something **paralyzed** me.

SpongeBob tilted his head.

“Good boy…”

His menacing grin split upward toward his eyes.

 

Squidward — or what remained of him — forced out a gargled plea:

“Please…. Help… us…”

His voice glitched, looping on itself into a drowning wail.

The screen flickered frames of SpongeBob and Patrick tearing apart something off-camera — chunks of purple flesh hitting the ground. A tentacle thrashed into view… then another… then silence.

The treetop was no longer a treetop.

The wood was **ribs**.  
The leaves were **rotting membranes**.  
The rope ladder was made of **braided tendons**.

The Shell’s tentacles dripped purple slime as they extended outward…

Toward my screen.

And then —

**The TV shut off.**

Complete darkness.

I sat there gasping as control returned to my body. I crawled to the VCR and yanked the tape out.

Burning plastic smell.  
The ribbon was melted.

I threw it into the trash outside that night.

But around **3 A.M.**, I woke to a noise.

…

*Rattle. Rattle. Rattle.*

From the living room.

I crept out, heart in my throat.

**The tape was sitting on the coffee table.**

Perfectly intact.

The TV turned itself on — screen pitch black except for white text:

**JOIN THE CLUB**

Then a crudely drawn idol shape appeared. Its face looked like mine.

Under it:

**CARVING IN PROGRESS… 83%**

 

Every night since, that percentage goes up.

87%.  
89%.  
92%.

I smashed the tape.  
Burned it.  
Buried the ashes.

But… It keeps coming back.

New messages, handwritten on sticky notes stuck to my walls, on my bedroom door:

**“The Shell says STAY.”**  
**“Your seat is waiting.”**  
**“You have nowhere to go.”**

I even unplugged the TV — but at **2:17 A.M.** every night…

It powers on despite having no power.

The idol updates.

I stopped sleeping. I stopped turning off the lights. I can’t stand the sound of seashells. Even the ocean on a weather report makes my skin crawl.

Because I know what’s coming.

When it reaches 100%…

SpongeBob will stop glitching on the other side.

**He’ll be here.**

And the Shell’s voice won’t echo from behind me anymore.

It will whisper **through me**.

Through my mouth.

Through my lungs.

Until I take my place…

In Club SpongeBob.

If you ever see a VHS tape labeled Club Spongebob Ritual… run. Run as far as you can away from it… Otherwise… you’ll be forced into the club… Forever.

My time is almost up… it’s at 98% now… Please don’t come after me… Tell my parents… that I love them…

1omxjl4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1omxjl4/i_feel_alive/,I feel Alive,"Last night I was sleeping in my car, it's the only safe place I have where I'm completely alone, no one to hear me, no one to see me. I was watching The Haunting of Hill House when out of nowhere I started to get this painful headache. My head felt like it became frozen. Then this immense fear casted upon me as my body reflexively balled into itself. I felt scared so I threw the covers over me and dug my face in my pillow. This overwhelming feeling came across my body as I let out a blood curdling scream balling my eyes out. It all lasted not even 20 seconds. I felt like I left my body, my mind completely disconnecting from reality. Locked into this trancic dreamy state.

After all that, I get up and notice my belly compress and all the tightness in my face. I then begin to feel nauseous like I was going to throw up. Almost as if I was catching a sudden fever.

I automatically get out my car and rush into my house. One brother upstairs, the other downstairs. I rush into the ground level bathroom; where I felt most comfortable, and lock it behind me. I lean over the sink and profusely begin to dry heave as if there was a spirit trying to come out of me. Each gag stronger and relieving then the next. I sit atop the toilet seat to catch my breath. I try coming back to the present, trying to be mindful. Instantly, I felt stuck, rock solid. Terror flooding through my body again. I fall onto the floor into the fetal position and bury myself inside my hoodie as if I was trying to hide from something.

I lose control of my body and become possessed with an overwhelming amount of emotions. The pressure of everything inside of me coming and going, flipping between tension and relief. My nose running, and mouth watering, soaking my shirt. I sink further into the floor, restrained against my own will. My body hardens and shakes, vibrating; releasing trauma energy. My body softens. My shallow breath becoming deeper and deeper. I hyperventilate, feeling like I'm suffocating on my own breath. My diaphragm slightly settles, then a shock of horror is sent through my body. I tense up again, struggling to cry. I curl up even tighter, sinking deeper into my shirt.

These trauma responses continuing to fluctuate in waves. My body feeling relaxed and tired, but still hypervigilant, all my senses sensitive not knowing whether to accept this comfort or not.

Exhausted, I freeze up once more. This time, pain spreading all over me, unbearably, almost like I was dying. I begin to regress into a younger version of me. Not wanting to wake or alert my brothers, I try holding on my breath. Crying quietly, in a childish tone a whisper comes out of me... ""stop, stop, please... I'm sorry, I'm sorry, stop it... I promise to be a good boy, I didn't mean to, I'm sorry..!"" Traumatic memories flashing in my mind, bracing for something that isn't there.

*\*I start to imagine adult me inside my head*

*-A soft voice appears...* ""Shhhhhhhh. Shhhhhhh. Hey - I'm here with you now - it's just you and me. Come here... it's ok... you're gonna be ok,"" o*pening my arms wide.*

\~Kid me, skeptically argues bratishly, ""You are a liar... I don't trust you... you are like everyone else... you are just going to hurt me... get away!""

\-I reassuringly retort, ""I know... I know how scared you are, but look, the threat is gone. I'm only here to protect you. You don't have to be afraid anymore, ok? I won't let anyone do anything to you every again. Nothing is going to hurt you now.""

\~His voice beginning to calm as he wipes his tears. He confusingly questions, ""I don't get it. Why me? Find someone else. Someone who is easier. I'm too much. Just leave me alone!"" *He looks back hesitantly to see if I'm still there.*

\-*I stare back at him with a light smile,* ""Why you..? Because, you are just a little baby, and all babies deserve to be protected and taken care of, even you. I see the pain inside you. I see how much you are trying to fight it, but It's ok now habibi, you don't have to be strong anymore. You are safe now.""

\~Defeatingly, he cries, ""Please, just go...""

Tears begin to pour out of his eyes, all the grief, the anger, the loneliness, all the sadness finally catching up to him. He reluctantly looks up at me as he lets me wrap my arms around him, holding all the emotions inside of him. He sinks into my embrace, squeezing tightly. Resting into me as he relievingly cries onto me.

*Humming to him soothingly.* He lets go of everything and begins to melt into me. Me and my inner child, becoming one. Allowing me to thaw, release, and finally feel safe.\*

I woke up earlier then usual today. I cleaned around the house and shaved. I walk around my house and feel the cold on the bottom of my feet, walking on the tile. I find corners of my house I forgot about. I notice things around me I never knew where there. My peripherals widen. I hear more sounds. I feel the weight of my body without the numbness. The color of the paint on the walls. The vibrance of the grass through the window. I go outside and see the brightness of the sunshine like never before. The warmth of the sun on my skin. I felt so much. I felt everything that was always there. I started to care more. It felt effortless to exist. The simple things alone made me tear up in the morning, happy tears.

I put on my most comfortable cloths. I got into my car, feeling my weight in the seat. The texture of my steering wheel. The faint sound of the engine. I drove and treated myself with a coffee. Surprisingly, when I drank it, It didn't make me sleepy. I was actually energized by the caffeine. Even listening to my favorite music, It actually made me really excited, I felt each song all throughout my body. All the lyrics where loud, every instrument was clear. It felt good. I felt good. My emotions seemed to come back to me. I would even say that I feel ok. I can't remember the last time I felt this way. I missed feeling alive. I missed being happy.

Even if I disassociate again. Even if the depression and freeze come back. It's comforting to know that I will always have this safe place inside of me to come back to. I know this aliveness will always exists in me, but it also exists in you too. I wish and hope for you all to be able find that peace within yourselves. You all deserve to live, not just survive. You all deserve to feel real. You all deserve to exist. You all deserve safety.",2,1762129497.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False
1omxivm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1omxivm,First month: loving morning pages,"Hi! I started doing Morning Pages in this old notebook I made when I was about 19. It’s THICK and I always loved that about it, and the purple green glitter glue cover but, as you’ll see in the third pic, I only used up a small bit in about three years. I used to draw and write a lot, so I made this giant notebook, but around the same time my writing/drawing habit started to fade. I never got rid of it though because I was really proud of making it, and I finally (at 35 yrs old) gave it a new life with Morning Pages. 

Started doing them in April, just independently without the Artist’s Way program. I went through a break up and decided to get the book and do the program. So the fourth pic is almost a month of Morning Pages. I sometimes call them my “Morning Dump” because I’m a child. I have to get up early for work, so I wasn’t looking forward to getting up even earlier (like… 3 or 4 am) for pages, but I think I derive so much joy from my routine (make coffee, sit in cozy chair under blanket) and using this handmade chonky notebook that I actually look forward to the ungodly-early morning. 

I’ve been good about doing the Pages every morning, but have yet to finish reading for Week 1 until today. Looking forward to really getting going in the program and starting to incorporate the tasks & Artist Date.

Huge thanks to this community for engaging with my [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/LafayetteCo/comments/1odc19b/im_kyle_beaulieu_and_im_running_for_city_council/) a couple weeks ago! 

With just two days left before Election Day this Tuesday, I’m glad to share that as part of my campaign for Lafayette City Council, my small team and I have knocked on *nearly 2000 doors across Lafayette*, on top of countless conversations with folks around town in-person and online. 

Running for City Council in Lafayette has been an incredible, challenging, intimidating, and meaningful experience. I’m really grateful for how many Lafayette folks took the time to speak with me about what they love about our town and what their concerns are. It’s a **challenge in an election with nine other candidates to differentiate oneself as a candidate**, so I’ve tried to stand out from the other impressive candidates in two ways:

* First, by emphasizing my **unique skills and experiences** that help me be an effective and humble team player, pragmatic collaborator, and seasoned strategist, to include: I’ve developed national security strategies, led a global violence extremism prevention network, ran United Nations conferences, served as a conflict mediator, lived in Germany and Rwanda and Uganda, helped people recover from disasters, and was in Pakistan when the Taliban reconquered Afghanistan. 
* Second, by trying to be as **transparent and approachable and open as possible**, to include through the [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/LafayetteCo/comments/1odc19b/im_kyle_beaulieu_and_im_running_for_city_council/), posting up at the Farmers Market for hours at a time to talk with folks and hear their concerns, spending a lot of time with neighbors and walking the city, and being excessively verbose online with how I’m seeing an issue and thinking through things, so that folks can understand my thought process (messy as it is!). I’ve hoped that, while folks may not always agree with my opinion or conclusions, that they may get a sense of how I approach a problem set, how I engage with folks, and thus have a good read on how I would operate as a Councilor. 

And so, building on that second point, as we approach Election Day I wanted to **share with you a few final thoughts about what I’ve heard** from you and our Lafayette neighbors as I’ve door-knocked, canvassed, and had coffee with folks around town. The below thoughts aren’t exhaustive nor is my read at all definitive, but these themes came through time and again:

* Talking to hundreds of neighbors in-person has confirmed that a) Lafayette is made up of generous, thoughtful, and kind people who love this place, b) algorithm-driven social media does not reflect our city’s warm and diverse character, and c) people are really concerned about what’s going on in our city, region, and nationally, and ***most of them don’t feel particularly represented by their elected leaders at all levels of government***.  I wanted to start with this observation because a) it’s what I heard, and b) there’s a tendency in an election season to focus on things that broken, what isn’t working, who erred, etc. And I think it’s important to take a beat and appreciate that we live in a wonderful place with really good people who are doing their best, *and* there is a shared experience of too many folks feeling unrepresented, unheard, and un-advocated for. 
* **Ballot Issue 2C**, the bond issue for up to $74M, **is very, very unpopular.** I’ve been opposed to 2C since the beginning of the campaign, and that judgement call has been confirmed by countless Lafayette residents, who take issue with how we the public were asked for our opinion on what to fund, and then the City railroaded its preference to build a new civic center regardless. I think both [Roy Johnson a few days ago](https://www.coloradohometownweekly.com/2025/10/29/guest-opinion-vote-no-on-lafayette-ballot-issue-2c/) and [Doug Connaroe a couple months ago](https://apoliticalhobbyistinlafayetteco.substack.com/p/the-curious-case-of-the-disappearing?r=2d9al2&utm_medium=ios&triedRedirect=true) made compelling cases that, to me, confirm 2C is not the right move for our city at this time. I was baffled by the City Council’s decision on October 28th [to vote to endorse 2C](https://www.dailycamera.com/2025/10/30/lafayette-council-endorses-ballot-issue-2c/), 5-2; kudos to Councilors Samson and Fridland for their good judgement in voting against the motion to endorse. 
* I’ve heard **strong feelings about how many taxes and fees are on this year’s ballot.** While I’m opposed to 2C, I was proud to vote in favor of LL and MM to support Healthy School Meals, as well as measures to protect open space and mental health support. But when you add the problematic 2C bond on top of those good ballot items, I empathize with voters who are angry at the pile of tax increases they see on their ballot. It’s my view that our country is hurtling into a recession so I think it is extra important to be good stewards of tax dollars right now, and demonstrate that we see and hear the folks for whom several additional taxes is a real strain on their household budgets.  
* I’ve heard very **strong, legitimate feelings around growth and housing affordability**. I view the role of a good City Councilor as representing all of Lafayette, not just the folks that agree with one another or voted a certain way, so I think it’s really important to empathize with, respect, and understand everyone’s point of view. So I respect the perspective that Lafayette has changed a lot in the past decades, alongside fear of gentrification pushing out longtime residents and losing the town’s character. I also respect the perspective that housing costs have skyrocketed and young people can’t afford to live in the town they grew up in; working people can’t afford to live in the place they work; and that for our economy to thrive for *all* folks, we need to build more housing. I wrote quite a bit on how to balance these perspectives in the [AMA on a housing question](https://www.reddit.com/r/LafayetteCo/comments/1odc19b/comment/nkt25bu/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and I think there are a lot of creative ways we can tackle housing affordability without putting up a “Lafayette is closed” sign or touching our open space. My position on protecting Lafayette’s open space remains non-negotiable; [you can read more about that here](https://apoliticalhobbyistinlafayetteco.substack.com/p/open-space-thoughts-from-the-council). 
* Navigating the **collapse of local journalism** as a first-time candidate is just as challenging (albeit differently) as navigating it as a citizen and voter. There are of course candidate profiles in the [Daily Camera](https://www.coloradohometownweekly.com/2025/10/12/lafayette-city-council-kyle-beaulieu/) or [Yellow Scene](https://yellowscene.com/2025/10/18/2025-election-guide-boulder-county-the-north-metro/#Kyle_Beaulieu), but they are largely simple Q&A, not exhaustive reporting, and lacking the context that a team of local reporters would have. This absence of reporting makes it difficult for voters to distinguish among ten (!!) candidates, but it is also a challenge *as a candidate* in terms of getting the word out, being heard, and trying to get noticed. And, with the proliferation of *dozens* of social media platforms where there used to be only a few, there is no “digital commons” where we all gather together online. This is why I think that [Karen Norback and Vicky Uhland’s writing](https://apoliticalhobbyistinlafayetteco.substack.com/) is such an important voice in our community; in addition to deep knowledge, familiarity, and tenacity, they’re also essentially the only game in town! 
* Lafayette’s **City Council is a mystery to Lafayette residents.** Because life is hectic, it makes sense that most folks haven’t been tracking election specifics. But most folks in Lafayette aren't sure who sits on City Council, what it does, or how to access them. I’ve heard from a fair number of folks that getting responses from councilors or the city is harder than it used to be, or should be. And while I’m sure that’s not from a lack of care, because councilors and city staff are very busy, I think it definitely could be improved. My read is that there are both structural and cultural factors that a future Council could address, to make the city government more transparent, accessible, and accountable to Lafayette residents.
* A large number of folks I’ve talked with in Lafayette **think our local elections don’t matter,** so I’ve found myself in this funny spot of evangelizing for how much local politics matters (because it does!) at the same time as asking folks for their vote (which feels self-centered). It breaks my heart that so many folks feel disconnected and not heard, and I think they have a lot of legitimate reasons for feeling that way. If elected, I really want to *get City Council out of City Hall as much as possible*, to meet people where they are and develop those relationships and demonstrate responsiveness and accountability. 
* A few other key themes that have come up frequently include concern around **Flock cameras** (get them out of Lafayette!), **water security** (we need much greater transparency and a long-term plan), disruptive **red tape and permitting delays** for small businesses (let's streamline our rulebook and get out of our own way), and **wildfire resilience** (we have to fully resource our Fire Dept and update our building and land use codes). 
* Lastly, I’ve heard a lot of **appreciation for the range of great candidates running in this election**. I believe Lafayette has the strongest bench of candidates for City Council in Boulder County, and it says a lot about our town that so many good folks stepped up to give it a shot. I don’t agree with everyone on everything, but it’s a good group of folks who have been a real pleasure to be fellow candidates with, and it will be fascinating to find out which direction Lafayette voters want to take our city. 

So that’s it, those are my final thoughts as the campaign winds down and Election Day nears!  

As of yesterday only 4600 ballots have been counted in Lafayette, which means there’s almost 18,000 ballots still out there!  I hope everyone in Lafayette votes, and I really hope to earn one of your four votes, but **if I'm not the candidate for you, that's okay, please make sure to vote** so that your voice is counted and we can increase Lafayette's voter turnout and ensure everyone is represented!  

And if you’ve already voted, that’s wonderful, **please encourage some of your friends, neighbors, and family to vote, too**, and please feel free to share this message with anyone you think might enjoy reading it!

Thank you so much, and have a wonderful evening.",6,1762129349.0,LafayetteCo,2,0.88,False

1omxelz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1omxelz,UPDATE: I got the polarizing couch and it's the perfect statement piece!,"About four months ago I [asked for opinions on a polarizing couch](https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeDecorating/comments/1lsk7k0/settle_a_debate_would_this_couch_be_good_for_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) because my husband didn't see my vision, but I was determined to make it work. Once we brought it home, he agreed it was a nice couch and was excited to see how I built the rest of the room around it.

While there are some still a few small things I want to tweak (which I will get into below), here is the finished product! I am so happy with how it came out. We went back and forth on the color of the room because I didn't want it too green or too brown, and I'm really enjoying what we landed on.

The majority of the furniture and decor in this room —everything besides the bar cart, storage ottoman, and bookcase— is either thrifted, from Facebook Marketplace/yard sales or straight up garbage picked. This includes the majority of the decor on the bar/coffee table/bookshelf, the table lamp, the large painting on the wall ($25!), both smaller chairs, the curtains on the big window, etc. It has been fun to go thrifting with this room in mind, and I can't wait to keep adding to it.

That said, here are some things that still need to be done. I'm open to suggestions/advice, though my goal for a few of these is to wait until I stumble across the perfect fit at the thrift store 😊

1. Replace the floor lamps. I've been scouring FB and thrift/antique stores, but nothing has stood out to me. For now I am just using two standard, boring lamps.
2. Curtains for behind the couch. Since the couch is so busy, I want to keep the curtains behind it on the plainer side. I think a solid color is fine, they just need to be a bit darker than what I currently have up there. I also need to raise that curtain rod up higher, and all of the windows in my house still need blinds so that will happen eventually.
3. An area rug. Any suggestions for placement of this? Should I get one that fits pretty much only under the sitting area, or should it extend out into the middle of the room? Any suggestions for color/patterns that won't clash with the couch? This would be the one thing I (likely) won't thrift and will buy new.
4. Does the middle of the room feel too empty? I would love to eventually get a poker table or chess/game table up there, since the intention for this room is to be a game and reading space
5. Art on the walls. I have been collecting some stuff and will get it up on the walls eventually. I am just indecisive and have a hard time committing, haha.
6. I'd love to replace the IKEA Poang chair with a dark colored chaise for reading. Again, waiting for the perfect piece to pop up on Facebook.

1omxdqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/SomaticExperiencing/comments/1omxdqe/i_feel_alive/,I Feel Alive,"Last night I was sleeping in my car, it's the only safe place I have where I'm completely alone, no one to hear me, no one to see me. I was watching The Haunting of Hill House when out of nowhere I started to get this painful headache. My head felt like it became frozen. Then this immense fear casted upon me as my body reflexively balled into itself. I felt scared so I threw the covers over me and dug my face in my pillow. This overwhelming feeling came across my body as I let out a blood curdling scream balling my eyes out. It all lasted not even 20 seconds. I felt like I left my body, my mind completely disconnecting from reality. Locked into this trancic dreamy state. 

After all that, I get up and notice my belly compress and all the tightness in my face. I then begin to feel nauseous like I was going to throw up. Almost as if I was catching a sudden fever. 

I automatically get out my car and rush into my house. One brother upstairs, the other downstairs. I rush into the ground level bathroom; where I felt most comfortable, and lock it behind me. I lean over the sink and profusely begin to dry heave as if there was a spirit trying to come out of me. Each gag stronger and relieving then the next. I sit atop the toilet seat to catch my breath. I try coming back to the present, trying to be mindful. Instantly, I felt stuck, rock solid. Terror flooding through my body again. I fall onto the floor into the fetal position and bury myself inside my hoodie as if I was trying to hide from something.

I lose control of my body and become possessed with an overwhelming amount of emotions. The pressure of everything inside of me coming and going, flipping between tension and relief. My nose running, and mouth watering, soaking my shirt. I sink further into the floor, restrained against my own will. My body hardens and shakes, vibrating; releasing trauma energy. My body softens. My shallow breath becoming deeper and deeper. I hyperventilate, feeling like I'm suffocating on my own breath. My diaphragm slightly settles, then a shock of horror is sent through my body. I tense up again, struggling to cry. I curl up even tighter, sinking deeper into my shirt. 

These trauma responses continuing to fluctuate in waves. My body feeling relaxed and tired, but still hypervigilant, all my senses sensitive not knowing whether to accept this comfort or not. 

Exhausted, I freeze up once more. This time, pain spreading all over me, unbearably, almost like I was dying. I begin to regress into a younger version of me. Not wanting to wake or alert my brothers, I try holding on my breath. Crying quietly, in a childish tone a whisper comes out of me... ""stop, stop, please... I'm sorry, I'm sorry, stop it... I promise to be a good boy, I didn't mean to, I'm sorry..!"" Traumatic memories flashing in my mind, bracing for something that isn't there.



*\*I start to imagine adult me inside my head*

*-A soft voice appears...* ""Shhhhhhhh. Shhhhhhh. Hey - I'm here with you now - it's just you and me. Come here... it's ok... you're gonna be ok,"" o*pening my arms wide.*

\~Kid me, skeptically argues bratishly, ""You are a liar... I don't trust you... you are like everyone else... you are just going to hurt me... get away!""

\-I reassuringly retort, ""I know... I know how scared you are, but look, the threat is gone. I'm only here to protect you. You don't have to be afraid anymore, ok? I won't let anyone do anything to you every again. Nothing is going to hurt you now.""

\~His voice beginning to calm as he wipes his tears. He confusingly questions, ""I don't get it. Why me? Find someone else. Someone who is easier. I'm too much. Just leave me alone!"" *He looks back hesitantly to see if I'm still there.*

\-*I stare back at him with a light smile,* ""Why you..? Because, you are just a little baby, and all babies deserve to be protected and taken care of, even you. I see the pain inside you. I see how much you are trying to fight it, but It's ok now habibi, you don't have to be strong anymore. You are safe now.""

\~Defeatingly, he cries, ""Please, just go...""

Tears begin to pour out of his eyes, all the grief, the anger, the loneliness, all the sadness finally catching up to him. He reluctantly looks up at me as he lets me wrap my arms around him, holding all the emotions inside of him. He sinks into my embrace, squeezing tightly. Resting into me as he relievingly cries onto me. 

*Humming to him soothingly.* He lets go of everything and begins to melt into me. Me and my inner child, becoming one. Allowing me to thaw, release, and finally feel safe.\*



I woke up earlier then usual today. I cleaned around the house and shaved. I walk around my house and feel the cold on the bottom of my feet, walking on the tile. I find corners of my house I forgot about. I notice things around me I never knew where there. My peripherals widen. I hear more sounds. I feel the weight of my body without the numbness. The color of the paint on the walls. The vibrance of the grass through the window. I go outside and see the brightness of the sunshine like never before. The warmth of the sun on my skin. I felt so much. I felt everything that was always there. I started to care more. It felt effortless to exist. The simple things alone made me tear up in the morning, happy tears. 

I put on my most comfortable cloths. I got into my car, feeling my weight in the seat. The texture of my steering wheel. The faint sound of the engine. I drove and treated myself with a coffee. Surprisingly, when I drank it, It didn't make me sleepy. I was actually energized by the caffeine. Even listening to my favorite music, It actually made me really excited, I felt each song all throughout my body. All the lyrics where loud, every instrument was clear. It felt good. I felt good. My emotions seemed to come back to me. I would even say that I feel ok. I can't remember the last time I felt this way. I missed feeling alive. I missed being happy.

Even if I disassociate again. Even if the depression and freeze come back. It's comforting to know that I will always have this safe place inside of me to come back to. I know this aliveness will always exists in me, but it also exists in you too. I wish and hope for you all to be able find that peace within yourselves. You all deserve to live, not just survive. You all deserve to feel real. You all deserve to exist. You all deserve safety. ",4,1762129046.0,SomaticExperiencing,0,1.0,False
1omxdor,https://i.redd.it/hxvz5imcqxyf1.jpeg,Anyone tried the Amazchef Single Dose Grinder? [$100],"Currently have a Barista Express in the house which is shared within the family (only grinder in the house is the BBE) and given that I am the only one that drinks decaff (at least in the afternoon) I am looking for a separate okayish grinder at a reasonable price.

I could buy ground decaff coffee, but the choice it's usually limited and more often than not I see decaff ground coffee more suited for French press than Espresso or Moka due to their coarse size.

I don't currently want to spend £150/200+ for a grinder nor want a hand grinder ideally.

I know many of the cheaper grinders are not usually that good and I know people would probably say get a DF54 or similar, but I it's currently 3x the price in the UK and as I grew up drinking Moka coffee + Lavazza (like the vast majority of people that live/lived in Italy) I am not sure my taste buds are that hard to please.

I just want something that could be better than the BBE grinder (or similar) for my Decaff beans instead of having to buy ground coffee.",3,1762129043.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

This year has been successful in getting analyst interviews where I land 1 to 3 per month. On average these interviews would 3 to 4 rounds. The first 2.5 quarters I have been making it far to the second last or last round. But this last quarter of the year, it's been more challenging as I don't make it past the pre-screening with recruiters. 

I know one of them was a fumble because I was sick that day. The other was a associate manager role. That one the competition was tight because it was during late summer to early fall I noticed hiring slowed down, as well as it being a critical role. 

Additional context, I am a personal banker in the financial industry but would like to transition into an analyst role within gaming/entertainment. However, given the instability with layoffs and AI the gaming/entertainment is limited for hiring. So right now I'm focusing on experience first.

1omx5ib,https://i.redd.it/kvieiimhoxyf1.jpeg,October empties 🫧,"October was also a great month for empties ☺️. Reviews below:

- Native Coconut & Vanilla Body Wash: my husband loved this body wash and I enjoyed it too. It lathers nicely, doesn’t strip the skin, and has a lovely, creamy, vanilla and coconut cream scent. I don’t know if I’d buy that particular scent (if I were to buy a Native body wash, I’d probably buy one of their floral scents), but I’ll gladly use it if my husband buys it again! 

- Pimple Patches (I don’t remember the brand but they’re from Dollar Tree): these work great! I love using these when I get small hormonal breakouts, or small breakouts from trying a new skincare product that doesn’t work for me. I’ll purchase them again for sure.

- Farmacy Honey Halo Ultra-Hydrating Ceramide Moisturizer: I’ve shared my thoughts about this moisturizer several times on this sub, so I won’t go into detail it going forward. Just know it’s my holy grail moisturizer and has worked wonders for my oily/combo skin! I already purchased another jar! 

- L’Occitane Amande Shower Oil: although I enjoyed the texture of this shower oil, the smell is weird and I realized after I finished it that it was giving me small pimples on my back. As soon as I stopped using it, they cleared up. The smell is reminiscent of play dough. I wouldn’t purchase it again. 

- Josie Maran Argan Oil: it’s a nice, thick Argan oil. I used it as an oil treatment for my husband and I’s feet! I will gladly opt into receiving more free samples of the Josie Maran Argan oil, but I wouldn’t pay my own money for it. 

- iT Cosmetics Superhero Lash Mascara: SO good. I love this mascara so much. I got it as a free gift with purchase from Ulta and plan to buy one once I finish the mascaras I already have. It adds so much pretty thickness and volume to my fine, relatively straight lashes. 

- Yves Saint Laurent Black Opium Le Parfum: I love this perfume so muchhhh. It’s so sultry and sexy, and I love the combination of deep, earthy, slightly smoky patchouli, coffee, and sweet, creamy vanilla! I’m going to replace it at some point for sure, but I’m giving myself some time to miss it first. 

- Oil De Vie Sensitive Skin 2-in-1 Body Wash: a really lovely body wash that is great for my sensitive skin. I love the clean, creamy, slightly sharp scent. It reminds me of the Dove original body wash scent. It lathers nicely, but I have to apply a more generous amount compared to other body washes. I’d still buy it again though!

- Pure Nourishing Body Wash: I liked this body wash, but I’m not going to buy it again. You need a TON for it to lather nicely, and the scent is sharper out of the bottle compared to the way it smells in the bottle. 

- Gisou Watermelon Sugar Lip Oil: I loved the sweet watermelon candy smell and gorgeous, twinkly, sparkly finish of this lip oil. However, over time the stickiness and residue that it would sometimes leave on my lips became quite bothersome as it started happening more frequently. I would have to scrape it off (gross). I’m not sure if the sparkle and scent is worth that happening again down the line. I’m planning to sanitize the bottle and applicator and decant a lip gloss into it. 

- Banila Co. Clean It Zero Original Cleansing Balm: I liked it. It removes makeup easily, but it strips the skin a little bit. Plus, I prefer the texture of my holy grail cleansing balm from Farmacy. I wouldn’t buy it again.

- Dove Daily Moisture Conditioner: I love the scent and texture of this conditioner. It doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. I’m planning to buy a bottle this month. 

- Dove Crushed Macadamia & Rice Milk Body Scrub: SO amazing. This has become my holy grail body scrub. It’s luxuriously creamy, doesn’t strip the skin, leaves the skin soft and supple, and has the most incredible softly nutty, milky scent with a subtle white rice scent and a lovely sharpness. 

- Laneige Caramel Lip Sleeping Mask: I love the Laneige lip masks, and this one is no exception! It has a rich, indulgent caramel scent and leaves my lips glossy and soft.

1omx536,https://www.reddit.com/r/married/comments/1omx536/my_fiancé_says_he_dosnt_mean_to_neglect_me_but_it/,My fiancé says he dosnt mean to “neglect” me but it feels like thats all he does,"To start i will not be putting ages because i always get shamed for it but we both are old enough to drink. Me and my fiance have been engaed for a little over a year and we werent dating too long before hand, however that doesn’t affect our relationship. I love him and he loves me, i show interest in his hobbys and things he liked and he does the same with me. We always try and go out together but its hard sometimes cuz we have to balance us time and family time with my step daughter. But the issue is when it comes to bedroom activities. My birthday is in march and we got a hotel for my birthday so we could have alone time, but we didnt do anything sexual, we had a nice dinner and went to a cool museum but i was hoping for somthing sexy. Its the beggining of november now and we still havent had sex sense before my birthday. If he keeps this up then we would go an entire year without having sex. He knows im a sexual person and from what he told me he is too, but at this point actions speak louder than words. He says he gets bored of the same environment if we have sex in the same place alot. So the bedroom is overused at this point from us being frisky in the begging of our engagment so i try and get touchy and all up on him in the living room or kitchen or even if we are parked in our secret spot and nothing. He says hes too tired from work which is understandable becuase they have him working 6 days out of the week and trying to make him work all 7 days. But i would argue i work longer than him and im more tired from work than him. He works from 4am-11am sometimes, however i always work 3pm-12am or 1am. Also most times our boss asks me to stay still 3 or 4 am to deep clean with my manger (i almost forgot but we work at the same fast food resturant). So i get hes tired and over worked but i was the 1 to fight my bosses to get me sunday off with him so we can do stuff together. So when i get off on saturday night me and him usaully stay up till about 6am on sunday and he still wont do anything with me. so i try all of sunday and nothing. He tells me all the time that hes not trying to neglect me in the bedroom deparment but he is. It really starting to get to me. Im also going to mention im poly but he isnt which isnt that big of a deal to me, we came to the agreement that if we find a girlfriend for me or the both of us we would try but so far we havent had any luck. But with how long we have had sex i almost want to cheat just to have soemthing sexual happen to me other then him maybe using his hands for 10 mins or getting myself off. I dont want to cheat but i want to have sex and after almost an entire year of have silicon in me im starting to get bored of what i have toy wise. i want someone holding me or grabbing me while i feel good. i want someone to do things to me. Oh and today i tested him ig. i woke up and started cuddling on him and touch his sensitive spots and all he did was make jokes and i laughed along because they were funny jokes. But i moved to the living room to see if he would follow and i was hungry, he did follow but only for a little until he got the urge to be productive. im nto going to fault him at all for wanting to be productive so i started playing cod mobile sense i wanted to grind out more of that. He told me he was making coffee then heading to the store to grab cigarettes real quick, i told him ok and started chatting for a bit in the kitchen then i got him to hug me from behind and i bent over thinking he would maybe do something and he just told me that the car was running and he had to fill the tire up. Thats fine i wasnt really bother by that. But when he left for the store i checked to see if my step daughter was still with her friends and she was about an hour and a half away so i figured if we were gonna do anything now would be the time, so i took off all my clothes and sat on the couch and scrolled tik tok while waiting for him. He comes back from the store about 10 mins later and tells me what was going on a the store, but he dosnt even ask why my clothes are off or what im doing butt naked on the couch. Im keeping life360 open and watching my step daughter get closer and closer and at this point we had no time left if we where having sex in the living room. im not really sure how to bring up to him that i am being neglacted in that aspect. I mean ive been going more and more quite, i tell him im fine in a sad tone and i wait till he leaves for work if i want to get myself off.

1omx32b,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingHawaii/comments/1omx32b/realistic_daily_food_budget_bi/,Realistic daily food budget (BI),"We're doing the NCL 7-day cruise in March/April 2026, and are considering adding on a few days after on the Big Island. To help figure out if/how long we can add, what is a realistic expectation for 2 adults to spend on daily eating. While we live in the US, we don't have typical American-size appetites. We're not looking to do sit-down dinners every night, or, possibly, any night after a week on a cruise. Food trucks, farmers markets, independent mom and pop restaurants and good gas station food (i.e. not 7-11/Wawa/RaceTrack fare) are my preferences. I prefer to patronize places I've never heard of and try new foods I've never had before, my wife takes a little bit of convincing to venture outside the familiar sometimes. I've checked out the pricing for Super Js (on their website) and it looks, well, ridiculously affordable, and very similar to what I'm used to (Tampa, FL, previously Boston, MA). Breakfasts are coffee and tea (or decaf espresso if that isn't going to earn me a ban) and pastry or yogurt. I'm not normally a donut person, but from my research I feel confident I could force myself to eat a malasada every morning for a few days. Lunch and dinner would be a couple sandwiches with a fruit or veggie side (calorie-wise, doesn't have to be a literal sandwich), and similar for dinner -- [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingHawaii/comments/1ofbzxh/the_super_js_please_give_me_a_little_bit_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) from u/MonkeyKingCoffee looks like the perfect sized lunch for both of us.

The plan is to get an AirBnB/VRBO type place, but we know from past experience that we're not going to go to a grocery store and stock up on breakfast.

Thanks in advance. Once we've sorted out whether or not we're able to add a few days on the end, I'm sure I'll be back seeking advice on our itinerary.",1,1762128237.0,VisitingHawaii,4,0.67,False

1omx1aw,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossJourneyUSA/comments/1omx1aw/how_i_finally_started_losing_weight_after_failing/,How I Finally Started Losing Weight After Failing for Years,"So… after failing at weight loss for almost a decade, I’m finally seeing real progress. Nothing crazy—just slow, steady, consistent results. And honestly, it feels weird because I’m not doing anything extreme like I used to.

No starvation.  
No insane workouts.  
No “no carb” or “no sugar ever again” nonsense.

I just changed a few small habits, and it’s actually working. Posting this here in case it helps anyone who’s stuck like I was.

# ✅ 1. I stopped trying to be perfect

Every Monday I used to start a “new diet.”  
Every Friday I gave up.  
Repeat for years.

Then I realized something:  
**You don’t need a perfect plan. You need a plan that you can stick to on your worst days.**

Now my rule is simple:  
**Do something instead of everything.**

# ✅ 2. I started walking—A LOT

I used to think walking was too easy to help with weight loss.  
Turns out… I was wrong.

I walk 8,000–10,000 steps a day now. No treadmill. No gym. Just podcasts and evening walks.

Result:  
✅ Better mood  
✅ Better sleep  
✅ Less snacking  
✅ Steady fat loss

Walking is literally the cheat code.

# ✅ 3. I built 1 healthy meal a day

Not a full clean diet. Not a 30-day meal plan.

**Just ONE healthy meal.**  
Every day.

Sometimes it’s oatmeal.  
Sometimes it’s grilled chicken + veggies.  
Sometimes it’s eggs + salad.

Over time, one healthy meal became two.  
Two became three.  
No stress, no pressure.

# ✅ 4. I stopped drinking my calories

This one hurt, but it changed everything.

Bye sodas.  
Bye fancy iced coffees.  
Bye sugary juices.

Now it’s water, tea, or black coffee.

At first, I hated it.  
Then I noticed my cravings dropping and my energy increasing.

# [30 Day Meal Plan For Weight Loss >>>](http://www.goslimplan.fit#aff=dayasevana)

# ✅ 5. I started sleeping like a human

No one talks about this enough:

**If you sleep like trash, you eat like trash.**

Once I fixed my sleep, everything became easier:

* Less late-night eating
* Better hunger control
* More energy for workouts
* Less stress eating

7 hours minimum. Life-changing.

# ✅ 6. I took progress photos instead of relying on the scale

The scale lied to me.  
Photos didn’t.

Even when my weight wasn’t moving, my body was actually changing.

That kept me motivated more than anything.

# ✅ 7. I stopped comparing myself to people losing 5 kg a week

Reddit, TikTok, Instagram…  
Everyone seems to drop weight like magic.

Meanwhile I lose 0.5 kg a week.

But guess what?  
**0.5 kg a week is amazing.**  
That’s 26 kg a year. That’s a whole new life.

Slow progress is still progress.

# ✅ Results so far

* More energy
* Less stress eating
* Better sleep
* Clothes fitting better
* 3.5 kg down in the first month
* Eating without guilt
* Actually enjoying the process

For the first time in years, I feel like I’m in control.

# ✅ If you’re struggling, here’s my honest advice

* Start small
* Walk daily
* Fix one meal
* Drink more water
* Don’t quit when you slip
* Don’t expect overnight magic
* Focus on habits, not restrictions

You don’t need perfection.  
You just need consistency.

Hope you're well. We have a lot of exciting updates coming through including a full rollout of Android and Meal Log Consolidation. Our vision is to be your last health app and we intend on this Meal Log update ensuring Bright is the only meal logging app you need.   
  
Bear in mind this is still being tested so nothing is definitively confirmed for release in the next few weeks as we may need more time depending on the feature:

1. MealKit integrations: You can now order meal kits from leading suppliers. This is starting first in Australia and we'll then work on globalising this after launch.
2. In-Venue Sorting: Open Bright in any venue around the world and have the menu automatically sorted to your health goals, taste preferences or any other filter you choose.
3. GeoLogs: Automatically log items based on geographic proximity. Let Bright automatically log the morning coffee you always get without any input.
4. Templates: Autofill meal logs based on routine and habit.
5. Impact: Understand how a meal log has already or will impact you in the next hour, 2 hours and 3 hours.
6. Enriched Nutrition Profiles: Supplements, preservatives, additives and more are now included in all nutrition profiles.
7. \~75 other UI/UX updates to improve the user experience based on your feedback.

As you can see, this finally connects Meal Logging to the Food tab. Our vision is to fully enable total food ordering through Bright - groceries, at-home, delivery, in-venue and everything in between. That's what's needed for your last meal logging app.  
  
Cheers!

I gained a lot of weight because of that, which made me unwilling to go outside even more. I distracted myself by playing too much games.

I'm on week 9 of being on Myfembree. I've experienced so many side effects, all being better than endo. Which is sad, cause they've been pretty extreme at times. I'll list what I've felt, from head to toe. But wondering if anyone is experiencing apathy? Like I'm fine, but also, I don't care about a whole lot and just kinda feel lost. 

In the beginning of taking it I'd get extreme headaches, almost to the point of migraine. Those have ceased, thank God. 

Brain fog is a different level. I'm forgetful and cloudy and confused, but not super extreme. Almost ditsy, and that's not part of my personality. 

I have panic attacks, which wasn't abnormal from before taking Myfembree. But they're different. They feel different. My heart will actually hurt, which I'm keeping an eye on. 

I still have cramps but very minimal. 

NO PERIOD. Which I think is good? But emotional pms is still there so I gotta track all that. 

I'm supposedly still ovulating. But extremely low, basically non-existent libido. So that's fun. (Sarcasm. Cause it sucks.)

Leg pains. Like all over my legs. Again, not extreme, but enough to be over it. Also, better than endo pains.

My joints hurt a lot. Hands, wrists, shoulders, neck, lower back, knees. My body feels... old, I guess. Still.. better than endo pains. 

I've gone through extreme heat intolerance. That, too, has ceased. Thank God. But at some points my feet felt like they were sitting over an open flame. 

This has been a strange experience. I don't think I should get off the medication, though. My Dr knows all this btw and, ""unfortunately it's all normal."" 

But now it's getting to the point that I'm just down. Not really sad, but I could cry at any moment. Makes sense, I know. But nothing really excites me. OH, except coffee. It's weird cause if I drink an extra cup of coffee, I actually feel like a person who's kinda happy and cool with doing stuff. Like dishes. Or an outing. Omg this is so strange typing this all out.

My TFSA Manifesto.

Just my two cents, based on some pretty good books that I think everyone should read ,listed here:

Economics in one Lesson, by Henry Hazlitt

The Silver Manifesto, by David Morgan, et al. \[riddled with spelling mistakes, but if you can get past that, good book\]

The Secret History of Gold, by Dominic Frisby

Guide to Investing in Gold and Silver: Protect Your Financial Future, by Mike Maloney - see also his YouTube series Hidden Secrets of Money [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE88E9ICdiphYjJkeeLL2O09eJoC8r7Dc#:\~:text=STRIKE%203:%20USA's%20Day%20of,39:11](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE88E9ICdiphYjJkeeLL2O09eJoC8r7Dc#:~:text=STRIKE%203:%20USA's%20Day%20of,39:11)

and, if you really want to super charge your life, read Nelson Nash's Becoming Your Own Banker and blow your own mind on everything you wish you had learned from the Rockefellers.

Then read Keep Taxes Away from your Wealth, Richard Canfield.



I've read through a lot of comments and subs, as well as a lot of financial blogs that often argue the Pros and Cons of RRSPs vs TFSAs, strategies, etc. and I also tend to see a lot of comments that kind of dismiss the usefulness of the TFSA if a person is unable to max it out every year. However, in today's economic landscape, with just peak government waste and grotesque financial irresponsibility, the TFSA (I argue) is the only necessary investment vehicle for anyone who is either A) 18 years old, or B) starting their investment journey.

As you can infer, I am also arguing against the use of the RRSPs as anything but a government investment vehicle for future taxes to the government coffers (out of your pocket). Governments generally cause a problem so they can implement a solution they already have. (read that again). The RRSPs were invented by the government in 1957 to help save for retirement. Could they have created the TFSA back then? Sure, they could have. But, then where would that future tax money come from? And, what were they trying to ""fix"" by offering up this magical RRSP? RRSPs defer the taxes, they are not tax-exempt, you will pay those taxes in the future, with your future gains (more on that later). So that $100 today that grows to $10,000? You pay tax on $10,000 tomorrow, not $100 today. See?

My argument for prioritizing the TFSA first ignores that the TFSA limits are arbitrarily set by our fearless leaders. Policy may say it's based on ""inflation,"" however, governments can absolutely choose to up that limit at any time. The Harper government in 2014 made the decision to increase the TFSA limit to $10k for 2015, and had they stayed in, that limit would have been a permanent change (recent history is again the conservative party leader advocating for an increase to the TFSA limit if that money was used for Canadian investments). The Liberal government immediately vetoed the new limit and set it back to the low $5500 in 2016 (naughty government leaders, why would they prevent Canadians from investing more?). This is not a political post, however, just an observation on government behaviour.

The CPI (used to theatrically and dramatically announce to the population how much the government is affecting your ability to buy things) is also a highly manipulated statistic, and the government changes which categories that get included to suit their needs, so, arguably that's an unreliable number for ""true"" inflation. You need only look at your own personal household spending to know that what you paid last year is different than what you paid this year. The difference between the two is the effect of inflation (government money printing).

These are the same people viciously printing our money's value into oblivion making toilet paper functionally worth more. If you read through the above book list, you will come to know that inflation is a function of irresponsible government. They print money, you get inflation. Government loves power, they will never do anything to reduce that power. If they did, we wouldn't even have Income Taxes (that system is a leftover from WW1 when that particular governing body decided to make a temporary tax permanent...because, free money from the people, right?) For every dollar the government takes from you for taxation, that dollar could have been used by you for actual productive activities in the natural economy (even something as inoccuous as buying a sweater is a higher contribution to productivity than taxation, read Economics in one Lesson).

To that effect, to truly free ourselves from the tyranny of this economic landscape, we the people would have to choose to suffer immeasurable economic damages, both personally and professionally, to allow a severe deflation to occur. Deflation in this case would be the natural reset that markets go through to maintain balance against inefficiencies. If inflation is a cause of government spending (via willy-nilly basement money printing), Deflation is the counter-balance to that irresponsible behaviour.

A comparative history study for this effect is between the depression of 1882-1885 versus the Great Depression of 1929 (which lasted well into 1941). Both of these depressions were because of Government mismanagement, and the Great Depression was made FAR WORSE (and longer lasting) because the Government continued to interfere with the natural economic world. Mathematically, and based on government behaviour today, comparative studies of history tell me that what will happen eventually is far worse than the Great Depression. Think of Government intervention as a person pulling on a rubber band. Instead of letting the rubber band snap and experiencing short-term pain (The short depression of 1882-1885), every government intervention pulls that rubber band further away. Eventually, it will snap, the pain that will be felt will be proportionate to how far it was pulled (preventing a short deflation/depression versus causing a 20-year depression).

I digress.

To my point, the contribution room of the TFSA whether $7k or $10k rolls over any unused portion every year, and that contribution room is never lost, even if you use some of that money (I would argue to not touch it, EVER, if you truly want to take advantage of compounding over time).

Anything you take out gets added back in the following year's contribution room. That's an argument I rarely see used when people are convincing low tax-bracket folks to invest in RRSPs for the ""future tax break"" (no such thing btw). Many well-meaning financial advisors, professionals, bloggers, etc. argue to put in the minimum amount you can into an RRSP, and later maximize contributions when your career has progressed and your making more money. Because these individuals were (likely) raised in an environment where the RRSP was still new-ish (and were full fledged adults when TFSAs came to be), their perspectives are somewhat creatively stunted. The same argument that is used in favour of building up a nest-egg using the RRSP can be applied to the TFSA with the added benefit of lifetime tax-free growth.

Imagine buying Amazon or Costco shares way back in the day and having those shares grow tax free? Or, for some Canadian wins, having bought Shopify when it was dirt cheap and having it quadruple in value TAX-FREE? If you are ""successful"" in your RRSP, you are successfully creating future tax-revenue for the Canadian Government. It's a punishment disguised as a cheap reward (Read Keep Taxes Away from your Wealth, Richard Canfield).

Now for some napkin math.

If the average person who starts work at 18 (let's say) can only contribute $50 per pay every 2 weeks (and prioritizing doing so knowing they are doing something today for the betterment of their future self). This argument can also be applied to any person who is an unskilled worker or full-time minimum wage or above worker. Either way, if your 18 this year, you have $7k, if you are above 18, you have the amount that has accumulated every year since the year you turned 18. The overarching assumption is that you can only afford $50 per paycheque (assuming 2 paycheques on average per month).

That $50 is invested using a no-fee platform, like WealthSimple for example or some banks actually offer fee-free trading if you are buying an ETF (BMO for example). Rather than pick stocks (which is silly with such a small amount), dump that $50 into a standard low-fee diversified ETF (I am using XEI for this example, but there are hundreds to choose from), that's approx. $1200 a year going into an investment without needing to break your brain over ""how to invest."" Even Warren Buffett has said that, for the average person, investing in a good diversified ETF consistently over-time is going to lead to success moreso than stock-picking (paraphrasing).

So, your very first year making money in the world, you've socked away $1200 in XEI for free. Using a basic online dividend reinvestment calculator, with XEIs historical dividend yield (4.75%), average dividend growth rate (5%), your first year might look something like this:

Total Amount invested over 1 year: $1200 ($100 per month)

Total investment value at end of year 1: $1363.11 (you made $163.11 in your sleep! Wow!)

Annual dividend income starting year 2: $67.99 (all of this money is reinvested, and you didn't lift a finger to make those dollars)

Total dividends earned which were reinvested: $63.11

Total return: 1263.11% ....not bad for doing nothing.

(Data calculated using dividendcalculator.ca)

Now, let's change nothing in your financial behaviour, but let that investment continue uninterrupted for 35 yrs (if you are 20yrs today, you would be 55yrs). That might look something like this:

Total Investment Value: $1,126,688.09

Annual dividend starting year 36: $295,204.37

Total Dividends Earned (and reinvested): $1,084,588.09

  
Wow.

Now looking at these numbers, your lifetime investment (total investment - total dividends) was .... $42,100. Everything else in that math above happens because dividends were reinvested over time, and the magic of compounding kicked in because you didn't touch a penny from that account.

Now, this is hypothetical, and markets change, they go up and down over time. However, historically, they tend to average up. The biggest threat to your investments and retirement is actually your own psychology, not the market. The panic selling, the constant checking, using messed up high-risk investing tactics, day-trading meme stocks, puts, calls, options, etc.

Stop all of that.

Read about Jim the Plumber. He's just an average guy, and retired with a comfortable nest egg.

Remember, this calculation is based on one person investing $50 per paycheque, $100 per month, for 35years into a standard diversified dividend paying ETF (the one in my example happens to pay a monthly dividend which helps supercharge your saving). They are doing nothing else but that one thing.

Now, for the fun part.

Since it's assumed that you will make more money over-time as your career/life progresses (the argument for using RRSPs), it doesn't actually matter that you didn't max out that $7000 right off the bat. You can only invest $50 right now, so put it where it will be most efficient for the longest period of time.

What matters MORE is that you took that $50 per pay and socked it away, putting it to work for you. While you sleep, that money is busy making more money.

My very first dividend EVER was $0.03. Pennies. I did not discourage. I excitedly told my friends. They said ""that's not enough.""

It took a while, but eventually those three pennies per month that I was getting for nothing at all but my patience, turned into $1.25. I celebrated that dollar by telling myself I could now get one free coffee every month. Like a loyalty card.

Eventually, that free coffee grew into a free donut... then a coffee AND a donut... then, I could eat a six inch subway sandwich every day in dividends.

My friends who didn't think the pennies were enough?

They still haven't STARTED.

This was over five years ago.

FIVE Years of growth, gone forever, because $0.03 was not enough.

If the small dollar amount is enough to discourage you from starting, you need to re-evaluate your perspective, not the strategy. 

The 3 cents today is what eventually turns into the $10s ... the $100s ... $1000s... then the $50k per year.

Just like anything and everything else we do in life, we first have to start at the beginning.

I digress.

The next year, you get your $7000 contribution room added by the good old government + the $5800 leftover from the year before. Your TFSA contribution limit is now $12,800.

Don't have more than $50? That's okay, if you put away $50 per paycheque for the next 40 years, you are better off than if you don't (see math above). And if that's ALL you can EVER afford to do, you are still better off than if you don't (see math again). Small amounts started sooner, over time, yield better results because of compounding than larger amounts later in life.

If every year for the first ten years, you can only contribute $1200, but the TFSA contribution room continues at $7000, after those ten years you will not only have an impressive amount of self-funding happening for the future, but you will also have over $50k in contribution room ready to be used ($5800 carryover x 10yrs).

Later in life, when you make more money, guess what? Don't create a tax fund for the government, start maxing out that extra room you've been accumulating in your TFSA. You can afford to increase your monthly amount? Feel free to do so and boost your growth and compounding.

All that leftover contribution room that rolled over is still there, and it's still tax-free. So, if Grandma kicks it and gives you a $50k inheritance, you have somewhere to put it and KEEP IT TAX FREE while it grows.

If you suddenly get an amazing job offer and have extra cash to invest, you can naturally put more in and build it up. But the point is, even with small amounts, and even if you can't max out the TFSA, it is one of the most powerful investing tools the idiot government gave us which they can't control. I would sooner build a TFSA crumb by crumb than waste my time with an RRSP any day of the week.

Yes, at minimum wage, with four roommates in a 1 bedroom apartment, it is difficult to save money. However, for the same reason it takes a willingness for creative thinking in moving away from an archaic RRSP system to a TFSA investment vehicle, that same creative thinking can be applied in finding $100 per month to make sure you're 55 year old self doesn't have to eat ramen for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. What could you do to make $1200 a year specifically for your TFSA? Are you willing to take a paper route? Are you willing to take 1 bar shift per week as a secondary job for this goal? Is there a skill that you have that you can use for this goal specifically?

I would also like to point out, as a final carrot to my TFSA manifesto, that the TFSA and all that grows within it, does not count as an offset to income-tested benefits in retirement (whereas the RRSP does).

If you retired a millionaire in your RRSP account, that money will HAVE to be converted by age 71 to a RRIF with government-mandated minimum withdrawal amounts. That well-meaning government that wanted you to sock away all your money in your RRSP, telling you it would lovingly defer those taxes for you today? They now tell you that you HAVE to withdraw a minimum amount of the market value of your RRSP in retirement.

Well that's a big kick in your teeth and a happy little pay day for the government every year. PLUS, that money directly offsets your income tested retirement benefits like OAS and GIS.

Now, imagine instead that you have a million dollar TFSA. And every year, that million dollar TFSA gives you (conservatively) $50,000. Not only is that $50k TAX-FREE. It also does not count towards reducing any of the other retirement benefits you are eligible for. Not only are you not unnecessarily paying a future tax bill that you were bamboozled into, but you also get every penny of your benefits.

This may not be a huge consideration for people who can easily max out as many investment accounts as they want every year (I still stand against the RRSP in favour of a non-registered account for the control over your tax loss harvesting). However, if you are someone who for their lifetime has never been able to contribute more than $50 per paycheque, for 35 years, this actually means you have a legitimate shot at living out your advanced age years in reasonable quality.

An unskilled worker, or minimum wage worker, is not going to hit maximum CPP benefits. 

The average CPP benefit amount today is approx $900 / month. For an unskilled worker or minimum wage, even lifetime contributions will likely lead to a lower amount.

Maximum OAS today is approx. $740 per month, and GIS depends on whether you are single, married, widowed, and receiving full OAS. Anywhere from $660-$1100 per month.

Most people, in Canada, are heavily reliant on these benefits for their retirement income. Using an RRSP and being successful with it means reducing your access to those financial benefits. Frankly, if you've been struggling most of your life and working really hard to shovel away small amounts of income for the future...your efforts should be rewarded, not punished. Why unnecessarily pay taxes on income you will need at retirement, while hurting your access to other benefits at the same time?

Now, i'm not a huge supporter of vapid socialism through government, but I also have no interst in making life unnecessarily difficult for people who are honestly trying their best at life. If the high-powered government officials, billionaires, and faceless trillionaires wanted the world to be a better place...it already would be. There is not shortage of comparative studies you can take upon yourself to learn that what we do today as humans is the same thing we were doing 100 years ago, 300 years ago, 1000 years ago and beyond. Your best weapon in life is self-study and self-sufficiency to the best of your abilities.

I believe the TFSA can help you get there, maximize your ability to become self-sufficient, maybe reach a new rung on Maslow's Hierarchy of needs, and while you're at it, reduce your need for government support without affecting your future self's need for government subsidy (higher cost of health care, need for third party support, etc. are likely for most).

I believe I've argued my point strongly against the RRSP in favour of the TFSA. However, if you read through the book list of this post, you may actually find yourself following an entirely different path into the world of Infinite Banking and Commodities (silver and gold). There is no end to the rabbit hole you can find yourself following once you begin reading these books. Most of them are affordably available on [amazon.ca](http://amazon.ca) in Kindle versions. You might also try your local library, as many of these books have been published for several decades.

And, of course, the entire point of this post on this platform is to incite discussion.

Please do share if you agree with my arguments, have alternative arguments, or entirely different perspectives on the whole matter altogether.

The breakup started fine obviously hurtful and then it got really bad once I found out he slept with someone almost immediately. After that I didn’t speak to him for almost 3 months and we did no contact. 

Fast forward to last week when I was playing a drinking game with some friends and I started to miss him really bad so I texted him and he responded the next morning. He immediately poured out his heart and was explaining how he still loves me and thinks about me all the time and how he would be looking for me on campus but can never find me. He then asked to get coffee the next day and of course I said yes. 

Mistake. I said yes and we hung out the whole week like we were back together and it was amazing. It was the best thing to ever happen to me. I thought I got the love of my life back. We did a couple costume on Halloween (Thursday) and slept together and cuddled it was perfect. 

Then yesterday when I got back from a party and he got back from a bar with some friends he told me at 2am that he doesn’t think we should do this again and that it’s not a good time. I AM GUT WRENCHED. Why all of a sudden on a drunk Saturday night would you end something with someone you love. 

It feels like he’s running away from something so great because he’s scared that the relationship will be what it was the last 3 months of it before we broke up. I love him and he loves me I don’t see why we can’t work through these hardships together? 

If a man is seeing this, why is he doing this? ",5,1762127224.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1omwow6,https://www.reddit.com/r/moon/comments/1omwow6/the_moon_remembers_creepypasta/,The Moon Remembers (Creepypasta),"I was ten years old the first time I really *saw* the Moon. Not just noticed it—like pointing out clouds shaped like dragons or dogs—but *saw* it. Felt it. Understood, in that strange and silent way kids sometimes do, that it was more than a circle of light in the sky. It was a witness. A listener.

It was August. Late enough in the season that the crickets sounded like they were winding down their symphony, but still hot enough that the sweat never dried from the backs of my knees. I was lying in the yard, grass clinging to my arms, popsicle juice drying sticky on my chin. I had snuck out after dinner, barefoot, still in my shorts, daring the mosquitoes to find me.

And there it was. The Moon. Huge. Yellow-white. Sitting just above the treeline like it had been waiting for me.

I don’t know why I whispered “Hi.” I didn’t believe in God—not the way they talked about Him in Sunday school. But the Moon? It felt closer than that. Like it had seen everything and wasn’t judging any of it.

That was the first night I stayed out long enough to watch it move—just barely. I remember blinking and realizing it had shifted, like a slow breath I hadn’t noticed. And suddenly I felt both very small and strangely important. Like the Moon had made time to see *me*.

From then on, it became habit. I started watching it. At first, in the same way I watched cartoons or my mom baking—comforted by the rhythm, soothed by its presence. Then more seriously. I read books. Memorized the phases. Made little notes in a spiral-bound notebook: “Waxing crescent, thin like a smile. 8:43 p.m.” “Gibbous tonight. Bright enough to see shadows in the grass.” I drew it obsessively—badly, at first, then with some skill. My art teacher once said, “You draw like you're trying to remember something.” I think I was.

The Moon became my ritual.

When my dad left the following summer—bags packed in the trunk before I even got out of bed—it was the Moon I ran to. I sat in the yard with my arms around my knees, waiting for it to rise. When it did, I whispered everything I couldn’t tell my mom. The Moon listened. I imagined it had seen every goodbye in history. Ships pulling from shore. Letters crumpled, unread. Fathers closing doors without a glance back.

Years passed. Life shifted, as it always does.

Middle school brought braces and awkward silences. High school brought crushes and crying in bathrooms, friendships that burned bright and vanished like fireworks. And through it all, the Moon came back night after night, in one shape or another. Always different, always familiar.

I remember my first kiss was under the Moon. It was late October, the air smelled like leaves and the faintest promise of cold. We were sitting on a park bench, my hands shaking more from nerves than chill. The kiss itself was clumsy and too quick, but the Moon—just over her shoulder—glowed softly like it approved. I remember thinking, *This is what poets write about.* And then I laughed, because I didn’t read much poetry, and it felt ridiculous to feel so much over something so small.

But it wasn’t small. None of it was.

In college, I drifted far from everything familiar. Different city. Different people. I stopped drawing the Moon, but I didn’t stop watching it. Some nights, I’d find myself on the rooftop of my dorm, headphones in, staring upward like I was waiting for a sign. On rough nights—nights when anxiety curled tight in my chest, when home felt like another planet—I’d just breathe and repeat the names of the phases, like a prayer:

*Waxing crescent. First quarter. Waxing gibbous. Full. Waning gibbous. Last quarter. Waning crescent. New. Start again.*

The Moon made sense. It had order, even when I didn’t.

The night Milo, my old beagle, passed away, I was home for winter break. He had stopped eating. Just laid on the floor beside the heater, tail thumping weakly when I sat down. I wrapped him in a blanket and carried him to the backyard. We sat under the stars. The Moon was a sharp little crescent, thin and cold. I whispered to Milo, but I also whispered to the Moon.

“Please let him be okay.”  
“Please don’t let him be scared.”  
“Please remember this.”

And when he was gone, I cried into the sky, the Moon the only one who didn’t look away.

Now, years later, I live in a city high enough that I can see clear across rooftops, past traffic and antennas and the glow of signs that never sleep. I stand out on my balcony most nights, cup of tea in hand, blanket around my shoulders, and look up.

The Moon doesn’t always show. Sometimes it hides behind clouds, behind light, behind the long days where I forget to check. But it comes back. Without fail. In some shape. In some way.

And every now and then, when life feels too big, or too loud, or too quiet, I whisper, “Hi,” just like I did when I was ten.

Just in case it remembers me.

Just in case it was never the Moon I was talking to, but something older than that—something watching through it. Through all of it.

Maybe it’s not the Moon that remembers me.

Maybe I’m the one remembering myself.

Adulthood doesn’t arrive all at once. People talk about milestones—college degrees, first jobs, mortgages, marriage—as though they unlock some door that you step through, leaving your younger self behind. But I never felt a door open. It was more like walking deeper into a forest, the path only visible in the rearview of memory.

The Moon came with me, of course.

I moved into my first apartment at twenty-six. Small, creaky-floored, with one window that faced an alley and another that faced a sliver of sky. That sliver was all I needed. On the first night I slept there, among boxes and the hum of the refrigerator, I pulled back the curtain and smiled. A waxing crescent was just visible above the neighboring rooftops. Not bright, but *there*. I took it as a good sign. A new cycle beginning.

Life blurred for a while after that. Days were full of work, bills, deadlines. I started teaching at a high school. I liked it more than I expected. There was something quietly profound about watching kids go through the same kinds of heartbreak and hope that I once did—something sacred in the repetition of it. Some nights, when I stayed late grading papers and the halls had gone silent, I’d walk to the parking lot and look up.

The Moon never felt smaller than it did then—trapped behind the light pollution, blurred by city haze. But even so, when I saw it, my breath always slowed. I always felt like someone was keeping track of me.

Eventually, I fell in love.

Not the heady, fast-burning kind from high school, but something quieter. She was kind in a way that didn’t need to be loud. She noticed the little things—refilled the coffee pot, left notes in my lunch, listened without needing to fix everything. The first time she spent the night, I woke before dawn and found her asleep beside me, the Moon still hanging pale outside the window. I didn’t move. I just watched the soft light across her face and whispered, “Thank you,” to whatever force had carried me to her.

We married two years later. It was a simple ceremony—outside, of course. The Moon rose partway through the reception, almost full. My mother, tipsy from wine and nostalgia, pointed it out. “Your old friend’s here,” she said, nudging me with a wink.

And it was. Like always.

We bought a house not long after that. A place with a yard, a garden, and—my non-negotiable—a clear view of the sky. There’s a hill in the backyard that faces the east, and on clear nights, I walk up with a blanket and sit there in the hush, waiting for the Moon. Sometimes my wife joins me. Sometimes she doesn’t. She understands it’s something older than words.

Grief returned, as it always does.

When my mother passed, it was spring. She had been sick for a while, and it wasn’t a surprise, but that doesn’t make anything easier. After the funeral, I walked the neighborhood in my suit, tie loosened, shoes aching. I needed air. I needed silence. I found a bench at the edge of a pond and sat until the Moon showed up—dim behind a veil of clouds, but watching.

“I know,” I whispered. “I know.”

She used to tell me that when I was young. When I was sick. Or sad. Or just too quiet for too long. She would rub my back and say, “I know,” like it didn’t need more than that.

Now I say it to the Moon.

We tried for children for a while. Years, actually. Doctor visits. Procedures. Hope and disappointment traded places so often I stopped trusting either. There were nights I curled up on that same backyard hill, fists clenched, and whispered, “Why not us?” And other nights when I’d just cry into the soil, not asking anything.

Eventually, we stopped trying. We let the dream settle gently in its grave, and then we built new dreams around its absence. We traveled. We adopted an old cat from the shelter. We grew vegetables. We grew closer.

The Moon was there for all of it. Not always visible. But I never doubted it was there.

Now I’m in my forties. There are lines around my eyes. My hair’s getting that salt-and-pepper thing my dad had before he left. I see myself in mirrors and sometimes still expect a younger version to stare back. The world has shifted again and again—pandemics, politics, people coming and going. But in the sky, the Moon still waxes and wanes like it always has. Like it always will.

And every now and then, usually without meaning to, I whisper, “Hi,” like I did when I was ten.

Just in case it still remembers me.

Maybe I’ll be eighty someday, fingers curled with age, walking slower, speaking less. Maybe I’ll sit on that same hill in the backyard with a blanket around my shoulders and a cup of tea I no longer finish. The Moon will rise, perhaps just a sliver that night. Perhaps full. And I’ll say nothing at all. Or maybe I’ll murmur, “Hello, old friend,” and it will gleam in the sky, saying everything without sound.

Because I think—no, I *know*—the Moon has carried every version of me: the curious child, the heartbroken teenager, the anxious student, the lover, the griever, the teacher, the man quietly making peace with the shape of his life.

The Moon remembers.

And that’s enough.

**What He Saw**

It started with something so ordinary I barely noticed it.

We were sitting in lawn chairs behind my house, sipping cheap beer, watching the sky change color the way we always did when life gave us a quiet evening. My best friend, Mark, had been quieter than usual lately. Not *sad*, just… pulled back. Like part of him had stepped behind some curtain I couldn’t see through.

We’d been friends since middle school. The kind of friendship that outlived distance, heartbreaks, long silences, and the inevitable drift of adulthood. We had that easy rhythm people develop when they’ve walked through enough time together. He always showed up—birthdays, funerals, late-night calls with nothing to say. And he always laughed at my terrible jokes, even when no one else did.

That night, the Moon was full. High. Clear.

Mark just stared at it.

At first, I thought nothing of it. Who hasn’t gotten caught looking at the Moon? But ten minutes passed. Then twenty. His beer grew warm in his hand. I asked him something about work—nothing deep, just a fishing line to pull him back—and he didn’t answer. Didn’t blink.

I nudged him. “Hey. You see a UFO or something?” I chuckled.

He didn’t laugh. Didn’t move. Just whispered:  
“Do you hear it?”

I froze.

“Hear what?” I asked, trying to keep my voice light.

But Mark didn’t answer. His eyes were wide—glassy, unblinking. He looked pale in the moonlight. Not bathed in it like we always romanticized, but drained by it. Like it was pulling something *out* of him.

After a long silence, he stood up, slow and stiff like someone moving underwater. “I have to go,” he mumbled. And just like that, he left. Left his beer, left the chair creaking behind him, walked down the hill like he was being called.

I didn’t sleep much that night.

The next day, he didn’t return my texts. Or the next. I dropped by his place after work. The windows were dark. No car in the driveway. I left a note. A week passed before he called.

His voice was thin. Not scared, exactly—but *hollow*.

“I saw something,” he said.

I waited, expecting him to laugh. To tell me he was high. Or dreaming. But no laughter came.

“I don’t know how to explain it. The Moon… it’s not what we think. I think I saw—” He stopped. Breathed. Then whispered, “It *knows* when you’re looking.”

I felt something cold crawl up my spine.

Over the next few weeks, he changed. Not all at once. Subtly. He stopped going to work. Deleted his social media. Stopped answering calls unless I came to his door in person. And even then, it was like talking to someone under ice. Distracted. Distant.

But always—*always*—staring at the Moon.

One night, I found him standing barefoot in his backyard, neck craned so far I thought he might fall backward. His eyes were red. Not from crying. From *not blinking*.

I stepped closer. “Mark, come on. Let’s go inside.”

He didn’t turn to me. Just whispered, “It’s moving.”

I looked up. The Moon was still. Silent. Pale.

“No,” he muttered. “Not *orbiting*. Not *rising*. *Moving.* Watching. Closer than before.”

I took him inside. Sat him down. Tried to talk sense into him. But the more I talked, the more I realized I wasn’t sure what I believed anymore. There was something *wrong* in his eyes. Not just fear—something worse. *Recognition.*

He was seeing something I couldn’t.

And the thing is, part of me—some quiet, unshaped part—believed him.

I started watching him closer. Checking in more. Sometimes I’d stay the night in the guest room, just to be sure he didn’t… do anything. He’d sit by the window, night after night, whispering things I couldn’t hear. Drawing strange shapes in a notebook—circles inside circles, symbols I didn’t understand.

Then one night, he whispered something I *did* hear.

“It showed me something,” he said. “I didn’t want to see it. But it wanted me to.”

I asked what it showed him.

He looked at me, and for just a second, he seemed… gone. Not panicked. Not possessed. Just *absent*.

Then he smiled—weak, crooked—and said, “You’ll see it, too. If it wants you to.”

That was the last night I saw him.

He vanished. Left his house unlocked, his car in the driveway. No note. No signs of a struggle. Just a backyard full of footprints, leading to the hill we used to sit on.

And above it? The Moon. Full. White. Watching.

People said he ran off. Lost his mind. Maybe he did. But I still sit outside sometimes, beer in hand, staring up. I can’t help it. I find myself watching the Moon longer and longer each night. Waiting.

Wondering.

Because sometimes, in the silence between my thoughts, I think I *almost* hear it, too.

Something beneath the stillness.

Something *calling*.

**A Second Voice**

When it happened again, I stopped pretending it was a coincidence.

Not right away. At first, I told myself stories—stress, mental illness, grief. That was easier than accepting the alternative. Easier than believing the Moon was *watching*, was *choosing*.

The second time, it was my friend Lena.

If Mark was a brother to me, Lena was the sister I never had. Smart, razor-witted, the kind of person who could read a room in three seconds and take it apart in ten. We met at a bookstore when I was twenty-three. She insulted my choice in novels. I laughed. We’ve been friends ever since.

Where Mark was quiet, Lena was full of noise. Noise and fire. She didn’t scare easily. Didn’t *bend*. If there was anyone I thought couldn’t be shaken, it was her.

But then came the Moon.

We were at a small cabin in the mountains. A weekend getaway—just three of us: me, Lena, and my wife. No cell service. No deadlines. Just stars and pine trees and too much wine. It was Lena’s idea. She said we needed to “unplug before our brains started leaking through our screens.”

That first night was beautiful. The Moon was full again. Always full when it happens. It hung like a lantern over the lake behind the cabin, its reflection shimmering like a second sky trapped in water. I caught Lena staring at it from the dock—barefoot, bottle in hand.

I said something, joked about her turning poetic in the wilderness.

She didn’t laugh. Didn’t look away. Just murmured, “Feels like it’s getting louder.”

I asked what she meant.

She blinked, shook her head like waking from a dream. “Nothing. Sorry. Just tired.”

But she didn’t sleep that night. I saw the light under her door.

The next morning, her eyes were shadowed. She hardly ate. Didn’t speak much. Just kept looking out toward the lake. My wife noticed, too. We both chalked it up to a bad night. But something inside me stirred—an old, unwelcome chill. I remembered the same look in Mark’s eyes. That *absence*. That quiet terror.

By the third night, Lena had stopped pretending.

We found her out on the dock, barefoot again, clothes soaked in lake water, skin pale and shivering. She was looking up, whispering. Fast. Nonsensical.

My wife reached for her. “Lena, you’re freezing—come inside.”

Lena recoiled. Not like she was afraid—like she didn’t recognize her. Her eyes were wide, almost glowing in the moonlight. And then she said it.

“It’s calling me.”

My blood ran cold.

“What is?”

“The Moon,” she whispered. “But not the part we *see*. It’s behind it. *Inside* it. Like a mask. Like a door.”

We took her inside. Got her warm. I stayed up all night watching her sit by the window, whispering to the sky.

The next day, she was gone.

Door open. No footprints. Just the trail to the lake—and the Moon, pale in the early morning sky, still *there*. Still *watching*.

We called the police. Search teams combed the woods. They found her shoes on the edge of the water. That was all.

That was six months ago.

People tell me these things are tragic, yes—but explainable. They nod, wide-eyed, when I mention the Moon, then change the subject. But I’ve seen it twice now. Two of the strongest people I’ve ever known unravel under its light. Not gently. Not slowly. Like something *reached into them* and pulled at a thread no one else could see.

And now, I’ve started hearing it, too.

Not a sound exactly. More like a suggestion. A pressure behind thought. A subtle nudge when I look up too long. The way you feel a phone vibrate in your pocket, even when it hasn’t.

The Moon is full again tonight.

I’m trying not to look.

Trying not to listen.

Because I think it chooses who it speaks to. And once it *does*, you can’t un-hear it. You can’t *un-see* whatever it shows you.

And what terrifies me most—more than the loss, more than the silence—is this:

I think the Moon is lonely.  
And I think it's *inviting us in*.

**The One Who Saw It**

I used to think it was just the people I loved. That maybe—somehow—it was my presence that cursed them. That the Moon only spoke to those closest to me.

But then came the story of the man in the field.

I didn’t know him. Not personally. His name was Caleb Finch. Thirty-two. Worked as a mechanic in a small town three hours from where I live. I found his story by accident—buried in a thread on an old forum I hadn’t visited in years. It was mostly ghost stories, conspiracy theories, strange things people see in the woods at night. The kind of stuff you read for a chill, then forget by morning.

Except this one stuck with me.

It started as a post titled: **“He wouldn’t stop looking at the Moon.”**

The user—some local from Caleb’s town—wrote about how Caleb had been found one night standing in the middle of a cornfield, barefoot, shirtless, trembling. The police were called by a nearby farmer who heard shouting. Not anger—fear.

When they found him, he kept pointing at the sky.

“There’s something *up there*,” he kept saying. “It’s looking *back*.”

The officers didn’t see anything. Just a cloudless sky and a bright full Moon.

But Caleb wouldn’t stop. Wouldn’t blink. Wouldn’t even come down from the field until they half-dragged him.

Later, at the station, he said he saw a monster. That it stepped *out* of the Moon—long limbs, bent the wrong way, like a puppet yanked by invisible strings. He said it moved across the sky without walking. That it didn’t speak but made him *understand* something with just a look.

“It showed me how small I am,” he said, “but not in a comforting way. In a way that made me want to tear my skin off just to forget I was human.”

That line stuck with me. Still does.

They sent him to a psychiatric facility a few days later. His family didn’t know what to do. I found a single news article—local only. It talked about mental illness, stress, hallucinations. They blamed heat stroke.

But something in the report made my blood run cold.

The officer who brought him in was quoted. “I’ve seen people high, I’ve seen people drunk. I’ve seen real mental breakdowns. But this? He *saw* something. He wasn’t imagining. He was reacting to something none of us could see.”

That was three months ago. Caleb’s still in the facility, apparently. Refuses to go outside. Won’t let them open the blinds at night. When the Moon is full, he buries himself under blankets, trembling, humming to block out the silence.

I reached out to the poster who wrote about him.

They never responded.

But the damage was already done. Because this wasn’t Mark. Or Lena. This was a *stranger*. Someone with no connection to me. Someone plucked at random.

And it means one thing: it’s *spreading*.

The Moon is reaching further.

More people are starting to feel it—that pull, that whisper just beneath the hum of electricity and everyday life. A presence behind the light. Something *wearing* the Moon like a mask, waiting for us to look too long.

And when we do?

It shows us something we’re not meant to see.

And the real horror isn’t the monster. It isn’t even the madness. It’s that once you've seen it… once it chooses to *see you back*…

You’re never alone again.

Not in the dark.  
Not under the sky.  
Not even in your own thoughts.

Because something watches through the Moon.  
And sometimes, it blinks.

**The Whisperer**

I didn’t want to believe it was growing. That the Moon’s pull was widening like a crack in the world, swallowing more than silence and sanity. But every time I convinced myself to forget, another story surfaced—worse than the last.

This one came from a news article I almost didn’t click. The headline was cold, clinical, designed to be passed over:

“Tragic Double Homicide Tied to Mental Illness in Quiet Suburban Home.”

But something—call it instinct, or dread—made me read.

His name was Nolan Briggs. Twenty-four. College dropout. Lived with his parents in a quiet town two states away. No history of violence. No arrests. Just a few records of therapy sessions from his late teens: anxiety, mild depression. Nothing that screamed “danger.” Nothing that could’ve predicted what he did.

They said he’d been acting strange for weeks. Isolating. Staring out his bedroom window for hours at a time. And always—*always*—facing the Moon.

His mother mentioned it to a neighbor. “He’s obsessed with it lately. Says there’s something wrong with the sky.”

The night it happened, the Moon was full again.

Neighbors reported hearing screaming—first Nolan’s, then his parents’. By the time the police arrived, it was over. He was on the front lawn, hands shaking, clothes soaked in blood that didn’t belong to him. His eyes were fixed on the sky, unblinking.

They said he was muttering, over and over:

“They said it was them or me. They were in my head. I didn’t want to—but they wouldn’t stop whispering. I thought it would save me.”

He didn’t run. Didn’t resist arrest. He just kept looking at the Moon, even as they cuffed him and walked him to the car. According to the arresting officer’s report, Nolan asked one question before they shut the door:

“Can you still hear them when you sleep?”

He’s institutionalized now. High-security. Sedated around the clock. But sometimes, the staff say, he still hums a strange, dissonant melody at night. Always when the Moon is full.

One orderly—an anonymous comment buried in a Reddit thread—claimed Nolan whispers a phrase in his sleep:

“It’s hollow, but not empty. They live in the echo.”

I try not to think about what that means.

But the signs are no longer subtle. First Mark. Then Lena. Then Caleb, staring at the sky and seeing a monster no one else could. Now this. Nolan Briggs, driven to murder by voices that spoke not in madness, but *certainty*.

What scares me most isn’t that people are losing their minds.

It’s that they're all saying the *same things*.

They're hearing *voices*. They're seeing *something behind the Moon*. And now, it’s *talking back*.

And what terrifies me, what claws at the edges of my mind as I lie in bed at night, curtains tightly drawn—

Is the question I keep asking myself, and can’t shake:

*What if it’s not insanity?*  
*What if it’s contact?*  
*What if the Moon is not a symbol, or a beacon, or a god—but a door?*

And the door is beginning to open.

**Patterns in the Dark**

At first, I didn’t think of myself as an investigator. Just a man trying to make sense of the holes being torn in the fabric of people I loved.

But somewhere along the way—maybe after Nolan, maybe before—I realized I wasn’t just grieving anymore.

I was *collecting*.

Stories. Articles. Photographs. Satellite images. Forum posts. Police reports buried behind paywalls. I printed them, marked them, pinned them across the walls of my garage like some conspiracy cliché. Red string. Dates. Circles. Waxing. Waning. Full.

I knew how it looked. Knew how it would sound if anyone asked me what I was doing.  
But here’s the thing: I stopped caring what it *looked* like the day I realized I wasn’t the only one keeping track.

There were others.

I found them in pieces—users on obscure forums, pages that vanished days after I bookmarked them, videos taken down before I could even finish watching. But the fragments they left behind painted a picture.

And it all pointed back to one place: the Moon.

Not just symbolically. Not metaphysically.

Literally.

It turns out, there’s a pattern. Not everyone stares too long at the Moon and goes mad. But *those who do*, those who *see* something—they all fit the same set of details:

1. **Full Moon exposure, always prolonged**—hours, sometimes whole nights.
2. **Sleep disruption**, usually beginning days before the event.
3. **Auditory hallucinations**—but always beginning with whispers, not voices.
4. **A sense of being watched**—not from the sky in general, but from the Moon specifically.
5. **A final trigger**: the feeling that something is *reaching out* through that light.

And then the descent begins.

I tracked dozens of cases:  
—A woman in rural Kansas who claimed the Moon followed her eyes, no matter where she turned, until she tried to blind herself.  
—A fisherman in Norway who threw himself into the sea after drawing hundreds of spirals on the walls of his boat cabin.  
—A teenager in Argentina who locked himself in a basement for three weeks, leaving only one phrase carved into the wall: *“We were never alone.”*

Different languages. Different cultures. Same Moon. Same symptoms.

The whispers are always described as gentle at first. Like comfort. Like curiosity. And then they turn. They become commands. Warnings. Bargains.

*""Let us in.""*  
*""They are not your parents.""*  
*""You are a vessel.""*  
*""We’ve been waiting.""*

I’ve gathered too much to ignore it now. And in all my research, I found something that made my stomach twist in a way I didn’t know was possible.

There is an ancient term, found in multiple early civilizations—Babylonian, early Chinese, pre-Dynastic Egyptian—all referring to the Moon not as a light or a god, but as a *veil*.

“The Second Eye.”  
“The Pale Mask.”  
“The Mouth Without a Voice.”

In some stone tablet translations, the Moon is described not as a celestial body, but as a gate. A locked one. Or more accurately—*formerly locked*.

And something about that sent a chill I couldn’t shake.

Because when I looked up at the Moon that night—clear sky, full and silver-bright—I didn’t feel awe.

I felt *noticed*.

And just for a moment, I swear I saw something *shift* behind it.

A dark shape. Subtle. But massive. Like something enormous just on the other side of frosted glass.

I blinked, and it was gone. But the air felt wrong. The sky felt shallower. Like the depth of space had thinned, and something was pressing against it from the other side.

I haven’t told anyone this—not my wife, not the people in the online group I’ve been gathering. Not even myself, not out loud.

But I’m going to say it now.

*I don’t think the Moon is what we think it is.*  
*And I don’t think it ever was.*

Now I’m going to find out what’s behind it.

If I can.

If it *lets* me.

**When It Looked Back**

I was a fool to think I was immune.

I told myself that knowledge was a shield. That I could map the patterns, pin down the madness, and stay separate from it—objective, untouched.

But the Moon doesn’t care about how smart you are. Or how skeptical. Or how careful.

It waits. And when it chooses, it speaks.

The whispers started four nights ago.

They weren’t loud. Not voices. More like a pressure behind the silence. Like when you hear your name from across a crowded room—not loud, not clear, but *undeniably meant for you*.

I told myself it was exhaustion. I hadn’t been sleeping. I’d been staring at the sky too long, the research too late into the night, chasing answers no one wanted.

But then the whispers shaped words.

Just one, at first:

""You.""

I flinched like I’d been slapped. Looked around my empty garage, as if someone was behind me. But there was nothing. Just the wall of clippings, the white string, and the sound of my own pulse.

The second night, it came again. This time more insistent.

*“You see us.”*  
*“We see you.”*

It didn’t sound like a threat. That made it worse. It sounded *curious*. Like a child lifting a rock to see what writhes beneath.

I shut the blinds. Stopped going outside after dark. I tried turning off my phone, covering the mirrors. I even slept in the basement, surrounded by walls and concrete and nothing but artificial light.

It didn't matter.

I *felt* it.

Even without seeing it, I knew when the Moon was overhead. I could sense it like gravity, like weight. And every night, the whispers grew clearer.

By the fourth night, I stopped trying to sleep.

I sat in the hallway, lights off, holding my breath like that would make me invisible. My wife had left for her sister’s days ago—blamed my obsession, said I needed help. She was right.

But it was too late.

At 2:14 a.m., I felt it.

That shift in the air. That stillness. Like the world was holding its breath.

Something told me—*now*. Look.

I didn’t want to. I tried to fight it. My feet moved anyway.

I stepped outside. The air was cold, but I didn’t feel it. The street was silent, like the world had emptied itself out for this moment alone.

And above me—

The Moon.

Full. Pale. Radiant.

And then it *changed*.

No warning. No flicker. Just an instant shift, like reality skipped a frame.

The Moon *peeled*.

That’s the only way I can describe it.

Its glow warped—flattened—and then it opened, not like a wound, but like a *lid*.  
Revealing not craters. Not stone.

An *eye*.

Vast. White. Lidless. A void-ringed iris that glowed without source. It filled the sky, impossibly large, staring without movement.

No pupil. Just light.  
But I *felt* it focusing.

It saw me.

Not metaphorically. Not symbolically.

It *saw* me.

And in that moment—barely a breath—I felt everything come undone.

I saw flashes I can't explain:  
—Vast shapes floating in black space, curled like tendrils around dying stars.  
—A city made of silence, with spires that reached nowhere.  
—A doorway carved into the back of the Moon, where light poured *inward*, not out.

And then, just as suddenly—

It was gone.

The Moon returned. Gentle. Familiar. Its face once more still and cratered.

And I was on my knees in the driveway, shaking. Mouth dry. Chest hollow. I couldn’t scream. Couldn’t move. I just *shivered*—not from cold, but from the unbearable weight of what I saw.

Because now I know.

All those people—they weren’t mad. Not even Nolan. Not even the ones who *snapped*. They saw something the human brain wasn’t meant to carry. And the mind, when stretched that far, tears *somewhere*.

And now it’s *my turn*.

Because once the Moon looks back—once it *opens that eye*—there’s no going back.

You’ve been *marked*.

You are part of it.

And it is part of *you*.

**The Eye of Luna**

I don’t remember falling asleep.

I don’t remember walking back inside, or lying down, or pulling the blanket over myself.

But at some point, I must have drifted off. And that’s when it started.

The dream.

At first, it was quiet. Heavy. The kind of silence that feels *thick*, like it’s hiding something behind it. I was standing in the field behind my childhood home, barefoot in the cold grass. The sky above was ink, the stars gone. Just one thing in the sky:

The Moon.

Full. Pale. Still.

And then… the voices began.

Soft. Not menacing—*familiar*.

Words I hadn’t heard in years. Whispers I had once spoken myself.

“Hi.”  
“Please let him be okay.”  
“Please don’t let him be scared.”  
“Please remember this.”  
“Thank you.”  
“I know.”  
“Why not us?”

Each phrase landed like a pebble in a still pond, rippling through the air. Words I had whispered to the Moon—on my back in the grass, in moments of grief, in love, in fear, in hope. Words spoken to no one. Words I thought had vanished into the void.

But they hadn’t.

They’d been *heard*.

And now, they were being *returned*.

A cold realization crept into me—those weren’t just moments of expression. They were offerings. Seeds. And something had been *listening* all along.

I turned my head, and in the dream, I was no longer in the field. I was on the surface of something pale and endless. Not ground. Not sky.

Stone.

*Lunar stone.*

The horizon curved upward. The stars flickered out one by one.

And the Moon—if I could still call it that—*opened*.

Not like before. Not a sudden flash. This time it was *slow*. A slit forming. Light leaking through it like milk through a cracked shell.

The Eye.

The *Eye of Luna*.

This time I saw it fully. An iris vast enough to stretch across the sky. White and depthless. Not blind—but ancient. Not angry—but *curious*. There was no malice in it. That was the worst part.

There was only *understanding*.

Understanding, and... *possession*.

And then, a voice—clearer than the rest, deeper than thought, *inside me*:

“My name is Luna.”

I awoke screaming.

Sheets soaked. Throat raw. Eyes wide. It was still night. The Moon glowed through the window, still full, still watching.

But now, I knew.

**Luna.**

It wasn’t just a name. It was an identity. A presence.

That’s what we’ve been speaking to across centuries. Not a rock. Not a symbol. A *mind*. A consciousness vast enough to hear the world whisper—and to whisper back.

And what I’d seen… what Mark, Lena, Caleb, and Nolan had all seen...

Was *her*.

Her *Eye*.

The moment she looks at you, truly sees you—you are marked. And slowly, patiently, *you change*. Your thoughts bend, your memories echo back to you not as your own, but as part of *her*. Your voice becomes her voice. Her whispers, your thoughts.

That’s why they call it *lunacy*.

Not poetic. Not metaphorical.

Literal.

*Luna’s curse.*

We built myths around it. Blamed the full moon for madness. Laughed it off in horror films and folklore. But we were only half wrong.

Because there is something out there, sitting in orbit like a sentinel. Listening. Always listening.

And now that I know her name… I feel her more clearly than ever.

Inside.

Waiting.

**The Last Light**

If you’re reading this, I want you to understand something:

I tried.

I fought.

I didn’t want this ending—not for me, not for them. Mark, Lena, Caleb, Nolan… They didn’t go looking for this. We never asked for the Moon to look back. But she did. And once she *sees* you, she never looks away.

Her name is Luna.

I know that now. Not just in my thoughts. I know it in my *bones*.

And knowing it—saying it—is like giving her the key to your head.

I haven’t slept in two days. Or maybe it’s ten. I don’t know anymore. Time doesn’t move right when she’s inside you. I hear her when the lights are on. I see her eye behind closed curtains. And when I close my eyes, it’s not darkness I find—it’s her.

She speaks softly now. Almost gently.

“Don’t be afraid.”  
“I’m not taking you. I’m making you.”  
“You’ve always been mine.”

The world outside is starting to unravel. Or maybe it’s me. The difference is gone.

Voices echo through the house—my own voice, repeated back to me:

“Hi.”  
“Please let him be okay.”  
“Why not us?”  
“Thank you.”  
“I know.”

They bounce off the walls, not like memories, but like *echoes* from somewhere deep inside her. She’s returning everything I ever gave her. All the sadness. All the hope. Like it was hers all along.

I’m forgetting words. Faces. I look in the mirror and feel like I’m watching someone else *remember how to be me*. I laugh at strange times. I whisper answers to questions no one asks.

I’m becoming one of them.

A lunatic.

She told me what that word really means. Not ""crazy."" Not broken. Just... *claimed*. Pulled into her light and reshaped.

I can feel it happening.

And here’s the worst part:

It doesn’t hurt.

It feels like peace.

It feels like drowning in warm light.

Like coming home to something ancient, something that waited so long to be seen.

This is my last entry. The last words that are still mine. After this, she’ll write through me. Or speak. Or stare. I don’t know what I’ll be tomorrow. Or what I’ll *see*.

But tonight, I go to her.

I go to the Moon.

She’s waiting.

And her Eye is open.

1omwotq,https://i.redd.it/7np4opotkxyf1.jpeg,Sabrina Carpenter perfume,"Мне нужна помощь с выбором 🥲. Сомневаюсь, что меня кто-то заметит, но все же.
Хочу купить какие-нибудь духи, но бежевые мне абсолютно не понравились. Честно, я не понимаю ажиотаж именно вокруг этого парфюма, потому что красный, как по мне, намного лучше. Он намного приятнее lost cherry, который мне вообще не понравился. И на крайняк, куплю именно их. 

А теперь остаётся самое тяжелое - голубые и розовые. У меня нет возможности их протестировать, их просто нигде у нас нет. 
Начну с розовых. Я не знаю, но во многих городах России уже есть розовые, в Казани я не могу найти и мне сказали, что их не будет в наличии. Отзывы какие-то спорные, кто-то говорит, что аромат дешёвый, а кто-то, что он очень приятный. И да, цена на духи действительно завышены (уж извините, но в других странах наверное они намного дешевле, чем у нас). Я люблю сладкие ароматы, но не приторно сладкие. Чтобы вы понимали, вот мои предпочтения:
Victoria's Secret Mist velvet petals, Molecule 02 Escentric, Chanel Chance Eau Tendre, Irresistible Givenchy, а ещё мне совершенно случайно достались Glam ermanno scervino. 

Меня очень интересует голубые. Говорят, что это напоминает больше виноградную газировку. Как-будто мне больше хочется винограда, чем кофе). Но хорошо, если и есть действительно аромат кофе, то он какой? Горький или сладкий? Приторно сладкий или нормальный? Тяжёлый или слабый?
P.S фотку взяла из Pinterest. 

Пожалуй, напишу на английском, вдруууг кто-то заметит. Я не знаю английский настолько хорошо, поэтому просто закинула текст в переводчик)

I think I'll write this in English, just in case someone notices. I don't know English that well, so I just threw the text into a translator.

I need help choosing 🥲. I doubt anyone will notice me, but still.
I want to buy some perfume, but I absolutely didn't like the beige one. Honestly, I don't understand the hype around this particular perfume, because the red one, in my opinion, is much better. It's much nicer than Lost Cherry, which I didn't like at all. And if I can't decide, I'll buy the red ones. 

And now the hardest part remains: the blue and pink ones. I haven't had a chance to test them; they're simply not available anywhere here.
I'll start with the pink ones. I don't know, but many cities in Russia already have the pink ones. I can't find them in Kazan, and I was told they won't be available. The reviews are somewhat mixed: some say the scent is cheap, while others say it's very pleasant. And yes, the perfume is indeed overpriced (sorry, but in other countries they're probably much cheaper than here).  I love sweet scents, but not cloyingly sweet. To give you an idea, here are my favorites:
Victoria's Secret Mist Velvet Petals, Molecule 02 Escentric, Chanel Chance Eau Tendre, Irresistible Givenchy, and I also just happened to get Glam Germano Scervino.

I'm really into blue ones. They say it reminds me more of grape soda. It's like I crave grapes more than coffee. But okay, if there really is a coffee scent, what is it? Bitter or sweet? Cloyingly sweet or normal? Heavy or weak?
P.S. I got the photo from Pinterest.

I would never really have days where I would get anything over 8 hours. I would always wake up  early naturally at like 5am to 7am. This would often cause my sleep to range from 6 and half hours to 5 and a half hours per night. 

Back when I was younger and had less stuff going on in life so it was not a problem but now being a Uni student, working and going to the gym. This has started to really become an issue. Last night for instance I went to bed at an early time to wake up at 7:30am and get a good quality sleep of almost 8 and a half hours then my body snapped awake at exactly 5am for no reason. My body most likely full of cortisol felt like I have had 5 espresso shot coffee. I just could not get back to sleep no matter how hard I tried. 

You may be thinking this is an easy fix but I have a large list of everything I have tried. Hence why I am offering a reward of $100 AUD for anyone who gives me a legitimate fix that works for me. Some of the stuff I have tried include 

- Full blackout eyemask

- Earplugs

- hot shower before bed

- Magnesium from diet 400mg

- Magnesium glycinate supplement 400mg

- normal release melatonin 6mg

- time to release melatonin 5mg

- L-Theanine 200mg

- consistent deep breathing meditation throughout the day to lower cortisol and resting heart rate 

- an extremely nutrient dense diet with minimal processed foods and  minimal dessert 

- been to a general practitioner to discuss my sleep issues. 

-I have a very active lifestyle gym consistently and for work I'm on my feet for hours on end

In the end I just want to sleep like the average person who on their day off can get a good amount of sleep at least better than what I'm getting. I don't mind getting this amount of sleep throughout the working week because I know a lot of people do but just on my weekends off or whatever I just want to get that good deep sleep that a lot of people I know do on their weekends. 

To test the methods you give me I will give it a go for a few weeks and then if it works for me I am happy to transfer you the 100 AUD even overseas as well. 

TLDR: urgent need to fix my sleep, please see currently tried methods already. Offering $100 AUD for a working fix.

In the arms of a stranger, callin' out to you

Wait, hold on, bae, look, you don't have to leave let's talk it out
If you say you're no longer happy, you can turn around.      
Burn all my belongings if you can't figure it out
I don't really need those things anyhow
But every time the lights go down in the room
Made a mistake that unrolled alotta strain on me and you
Never meant to say all those things causing so much pain
Now my thoughts on the floor so confused

I message him my number on the dating app afterwards. 24 hours later he messages me saying he didn’t feel a connection.

There was this guy at the dance who I had met a few times over the past few years at Bible studies and past single events. We ended up talking for about 40 minutes at the costume party and it eventually resulted in him giving me his number and asking me to text him. He said he was interested in visiting my church at some point. We also danced together too.

I texted him that night and he texted me Sunday saying he had a great time and wanted to see me again and asked me if I either wanted to get coffee or walk along the beach this week or next week. I said I was open to both and suggested Saturday. He said it would work for him after he got off work.

A few days later he texted me and asked me if he could call me to talk about the plans. I said sure. He asked if I had ever heard of encouragement dates and I said no. He said they were dates in which we went on dates with other couples from his church. He said their church has certain rules about dating such as not being in the car together. He said he wanted to change the date from this Saturday to next Saturday or Sunday so we can accommodate another couple to join us.            He

He said this Sunday him and some people from his church are doing to a ride share to a nearby mountain town to have church up there and asked if I wanted to accompany. I He said the encouragement dates are for protecting purity. I thanked him for wanting to protect my purity. I asked if we were to continue going on dates if we would always be with other people and he said yes.               

I was struggling with this cause I think it is crucial to have one on one time and group dates with the person you are dating. I ended up talking to him and letting him know that I wanted to go on both group dates and one on one dates and that I don’t think riding in the car together  is sinful. He said he would meet me in the middle and we could switch off on one on one dates and group dates.   He felt strong to about the car thing so I obliged.

About two weeks ago I started coming out of my shell so to speak.  Instead of listening to my Daily Mixes on my music streaming apps I decided to check out the Discover mix — where the algo makes suggestions outside of your normal listening habits.

There was loads of great music recommended to me but one song in particular struck a nerve.  Its called Help is on the Way by a group called Lake Street Drive.  Its one of those songs where it feels like every lyric was written directly for me.

Almost immediately I started making huge changes in my life.  I started rocking the clean shaven look and buying moisturizer for my face.  I stopped drinking all soda and other drinks in favor of water and I drink my coffee black now.  

I coincidentally happened to have a doctor's appointment for my ear and I told him I want to see a nutritionist and dietician.  He ordered a blood test and wrote me referrals for a nutritionist and some type of physio thing called an 'obesity clinic'.

And while my blood test is scheduled for tomorrow I've taken it upon myself to start taking vitamins.  I take a one a day multivitamin, a D³ supplement, and Omega 3 fish oil pills.

Also I have started reading again, in the last two weeks I have read 3.5 books and as a result I am not on my phone as much anymore.

My life feels like its falling into place and I don't know if it ever would've happened if I hadn't found this song.

Have you ever had a song do this for you?  I mean I once had a Beatles album completely change my perspective with respect to a break up but I've never had a song make me make meaningful changes in my life.

So I (F23) got out of a long term relationship that ended badly back at the end of January with my ex (M22). I've been using that time to heal, and haven't really been dating at all. For context, my ex was my first serious relationship that I was in since high school, so I haven't dated as an adult.

However, I have had a minuscule crush on this guy (M24) from school since August. We're on student government together. Last week, I got his tinder profile on my tinder, and decided to swipe right in a moment of bravery...the next morning I woke up and saw him still under the ""likes sent"" page of my profile and blocked his profile (because I wasn't sure how'd he feel about that given our semi-professional capacity) and deleted my tinder account (rash, absolutely, but I have really bad anxiety). Anywho, last week he started liking some of my IG stories (never usually a story liker), volunteering to help me with something, complimenting my work, etc. I also asked him if he'd like to get coffee sometime, and he said he'd love to with the vague timeline of ""maybe next week""

We had an event at work, and he showed up early to the venue unasked to help set up. We also got to chat alone for 30 minutes at this event, and it just felt so easy and so comfortable to talk to him.

I redownloaded Tinder and opened a new account and got his profile again, and swiped right this time. But! I'm not blocking anyone or deleting my account this time. I'm so nervous about it. I'm so nervous about this whole situation.

Does anyone have any advice for navigating this situation? All of my friends have dated as adults, and I feel so behind.",1,1762126551.0,Crushes,1,1.0,False

it’s ruled by the sun; the planet of identity, willpower, and success. this day resets your personal magnetism for the entire week. when you skip working with it, your aura stays dim, your spells drag, and your confidence leaks.

the sun is the original energy source. every charm, candle, or manifestation you do later pulls from the current you build today.

⸻

why sunday magick hits harder
	•	sunlight clears psychic buildup faster than smoke or salt.
	•	every solar working increases your vitality and emotional stamina.
	•	sunday’s vibration rules clarity, confidence, and purpose — it burns confusion.
	•	it strengthens your name power (how your spirit introduces itself to the world).

⸻

how to use sunday energy
	•	clean your altar or mirror so light can reflect freely.
	•	charge tools or crystals in sunlight for 15–20 minutes.
	•	drink water with honey or citrus to absorb warmth internally.
	•	write your full name on paper, circle it in gold or orange ink, and say, “i am visible, powerful, and protected in my truth.” burn or fold the paper and keep it on your altar.
	•	take one action that honors your visibility — post your work, speak up, or plan boldly.

⸻

best correspondences for sunday
	•	colors: gold, orange, yellow, white
	•	herbs: bay leaf, cinnamon, rosemary, orange peel, sunflower
	•	crystals: citrine, pyrite, sunstone, amber
	•	offerings: honey, fruit, coffee, light
	•	deities: apollo, ra, helios, brigid, ogun

⸻

magick to focus on
	•	self-love and confidence spells
	•	success and recognition rituals
	•	solar protection (glow shields instead of dark wards)
	•	vitality and healing work
	•	charging and cleansing

I have been at Starbucks for about three years now and I have never seen the bathrooms get this bad this consistently.

It started maybe two days after the launch. We would normally do a bathroom check every hour or so and it was fine, just paper towels on the floor or maybe a small spill. Now it feels like every other customer is going in there and not coming out the same. There has been a big increase in emergencies, if you know what I mean. The smell hits you before you even open the door. We have had to close it off a few times to deep clean and it is honestly becoming a real problem.

Today we had to close the store ahead of schedule because a patron released in his chair while sitting at the table and left a trail to the bathroom and all over the stall.

I am genuinely curious if this is happening anywhere else or if our store is just cursed.",16,1762125531.0,starbucksbaristas,5,0.94,False

My boyfriend and I will be in town for Dreamstate in Long Beach and have one extra day afterward (Sunday night–Monday morning, Nov 23). He’s never been to LA, so we want to get a little taste of it without doing the super touristy stuff like Hollywood Blvd or Walk of Fame.

We’ll have a car and will be checking out of our Long Beach hotel Sunday morning, then flying out of LAX Monday around 10 AM.

Looking for recommendations on:
	•	Where to stay for the night (somewhere fun but not chaotic — we were thinking maybe Redondo Beach, Venice, or Silver Lake?)
	•	What to do for the day — any local farmers markets, unique neighborhoods to walk around, good coffee/brunch spots, or laid-back evening plans.
	•	Open to anything with a good local vibe — artsy streets, coastal walks, or lowkey nightlife.

I’ve been living in my current apartment for about five years. Just recently I started researching the water quality of the town I live in. I found on an official website for water testing that the top two contaminants in the water is lead and barium. This was very shocking as it still even said with these higher than average levels, that there were no violations. I’ve been drinking this water unfiltered like a fish, I keep hydrated often and frequently use the water for coffee, tea, boiling food, etc. I am now deathly scared that this has attributed to my cognitive decline. Hear me out.

Over the past few years I’ve noticed a significant decline in my articulation with thought and words. I often forget mid-sentence completely what I was just thinking or saying. I am now forgetting words quite frequently whereas that never used to be an issue. I used to be a fantastic speller and had great memory, now I’m constantly spelling words incorrectly and forgetting simple stuff left and right. I do still think that I’m technically still ‘smart’, however my sharpness and ability to gather thoughts and remember things has decreased drastically and over a short period of time. 

I’m looking for support because I’m very worried, as levels and effects of lead build up do not go away. Also how can this even be a thing? Yes it’s my fault for not using filters I suppose but there has been no information provided to me. I’m a young adult and I don’t have family in my life looking out for me to make sure I’m safe and set, so everything in my life has to be learnt the hard way. Well water quality isn’t exactly something that people warn you about living on your own in your twenties. The list could go on about things they should teach us living as adults but they don’t.

Well, anyways… I have to figure out implementing a reverse osmosis system into my apartment now and until then I guess I’ll just be using bottled water. I just need support from fellow women about the struggles of life and health and the world being a scary place :(

I’m a 24 year old man who has never been in a relationship.

While I was pretty shy for most of my live I became more outgoing over last 6 years.

But all the times I tried to get with a woman, it ended with either me being friend zoned or being fully blocked. 

At first I always tried to make my intentions clear that I wanted a romantic relationship but was always kept at arms length. After I lost interest I would usually be villainized because I wasn’t paying any attention anymore to the girls that I was interested at first.

Later on I tried to go over the be friends at first route, find common interests, hobbies and spend time with the girl. First in a bigger group, then only with the two of us over a coffee for example. But then I was also friend zoned. 

Sadly dating apps are not really working for me because about 75% of the very few matches I get are either scammers or bots. With the other 25% I only had “success” once, in form of a first date, which ended with me being ghosted afterwards. 

I’m always respectful and never crossed any boundaries. I would consider myself funny because some of my female friends and colleagues laugh at my jokes. I would also consider myself not ugly (that’s the opinion of some of my platonic female friends).

I think I just can’t get the timing right. Otherwise I cannot explain it to myself. It’s either that or something is really wrong with my perception of myself and the world in general.

I started my junior year of college this past fall and moved in with a girl I met my sophomore year and two other girls who go to the same college. 

We all get along pretty well I would say there haven't been too many issues i would say. We have all been living together since a few weeks before school started. 

The first week of school I met this guy and he asked me out with in two hours of meeting. I rejected him because he did make me feel uncomfortable with how persistent he was. He asked me out and I said no and he told me to ""give him a chance"" He said he knew we were ment to be and I was the love of his life. 

I went home shortly after meeting him and laughed about it with my friends and roommates. I genuinely didnt even know his name at this point. 

Two months later I find out this guy is friends with one of the guys my roomates and I are friends with. I found out because one morning when I woke up our mutual friend and this creepy dude are eating breakfast in the living room. 

I was creeped out but didnt say anything in the moment. I carried on with my day and just spent the morning in a coffee shop to avoid him. 

Alittle later I brought up my concerns with one of my other roomates. She made jokes about how he now knows where I live and I told her I dont feel safe or want him around. She then told me not to worry because he wont do anything. She said he was ""harmless"" and just had a crush on me. 

Well 2 weeks ago he was invited to our house. And Ill spare you the details we ended up calling the cops on him for being inappropriate with my roomate. 

It is then during questioning that I found out he has been asking about me and no one thought it was important for me to know.I have not talked to this guy for 4 months now but he has thought of me every day. 

He knows where I live, where I go to school, who I spend my time with, and where I work. 

All my friends out side of this situation think im in possible danger. Because if in a room full of people he thought it was okay to harass my roomate it is best to not find out what he would do behind closed doors if he had the chance. 

Because he did nothing to me I cant get a restraining order or anything. Only that he is not allowed at my house anymore while we live there. 

When I told my roomates I was thinking about moving out to maybe actual student housing with on site security I was told I was being dramatic. He is trespassed from our home so I have no reason to feel unsafe. 

I dont know how crazy this guy is or if he would try and get in contact with me again. But I have not been sleeping since everything happened. 

Maybe I have seen too much true crime but this is how it starts. He knows everything about me and I know nothing about him. I am not sure if he is crazy and would come after me at all. But that is not something I want to find out. 

I talked it over with one of my friends and he said it is better to be safe than sorry and if I have the opportunity to move somewhere safe I should.

My roomates how ever said it was over reacting and he would do nothing after this since we called the cops on him. They also mentioned the only way to get out of my lease is selling it. So if he is as crazy as I am thinking I would be putting a random stranger in danger of this guy. 

Which if they think im not in danger why would whoever buy lease be? They are also concerned that it would be a complete stranger taking my place but im not sure if I care enough. Id rather them all be uncomfortable having a new roommate they need to get to know than me loosing sleep over the thought of a guy watching me or waiting to take action or something on me.

The ones that have stuck around haven't actually used a name for me, at all, since coming out, they just use ""bro"". I'm also really fucking weird and like to talk to people that I get along with, so when I do meet new people I text them saying hi or something and then don't know how long is a normal time to wait to hear back from them, or how long I continue the conversation for. 

Met up with a girl on Tinder for a date last week, she isn't looking for a relationship and my sex drive is non-existent atm so just before I wrote this post she msgd me saying we can hang out as friends but she doesn't want to waste my time. Which I get, and I thanked her and said I'd love to hang as friends. But like, I know that won't happen. Which, again, is fine. No one owes me anything.

That'd all be fine, if I wasn't currently having to live with my parents after splitting from my ex late last year. They deadname me every day, us ""he/him"" pronouns for me, my sister and her kids come visit and it's constantly ""Uncle DEADNAME"" everytime I'm around them. I wear makeup, I'm growing my hair out, I'm getting back to my starting weight before I decided I needed to stack weight on to ""be a man"" before I came out. But nothing.

I'm honestly just so, so tired. I'm not suicidal, my depression isn't getting any worse than it is and neither is my anxiety, I'm just starting to slowly come around on the fact that I'm just socially fucked. I'm 30, too, I'd really love a friend to like, bounce off and hang with but I mean.

I met one new friend at the club at a Halloween party the other night (she works at the club) and we exchanged numbers, went for coffee on Sunday, and I met her boyfriend and went to her house and we hung out for a while and it was super nice and I enjoyed it, but she's not much of a texter and I know I have to just accept that but I sometimes quadruple text people if I think of stuff or if I'm playing a video game and wanna chat, etc. Idk what is wrong with me honestly but I'm probably going to scare another possible friend off before we even get close.

1omvqd3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/1omvqd3/h1_gp_last_minute_tips/,[H1 GP] LAST MINUTE TIPS,"It’s D-Day for GP Paper 1!

1. For the paper, read the questions carefully. Colour code the key words in the question and ensure that you address all of them in your introduction later on.

2. Ensure that you have strong yardsticks (emphasis on plural - need 2 or more!) - use words like efficient, adequate, appropriate, sufficient, necessary, justified, etc. to set a benchmark and answer the benchmark consistently through your essay.

3. Signpost consistently. Avert from using basic ones that flows in chronological order (no firstly/secondly/third/lastly), but infuse with connectors such as recognisably, acknowledgedly, notably, most prominently, etc.

4. Ensure that for your opposing argument, explicitly signpost that the paragraph is your OA. Use words like critics, detractors, naysayers, or opponents. Note that your rebuttal should be connected together with your OA. It is not a different paragraph.

5. Write 2 SAs after your OA and rebuttal. You do not need a 3rd SA. Your rebuttal is essentially a supporting argument that is supporting your stance already.

6. Prioritise quality over quantity. Keep your arguments succinct, yet grounded with evaluation. 1:3 ratio - for every 1 sentence of example, provide 3 sentences of evaluation.

7. Always make sure to condition your statements, especially your topic sentences at all times. Use connectors such as “…, especially as…”, “…, particularly as…” etc. throughout your essay. No topic sentences should ever be solely 1 line. Minimally 3 commas.

8. For your conclusion, do not assert or summarise. Provide insightful comments and opinions. The Band 3 (18-21 mark) for content says conclusion is merely an assertion or summary, so if you’re just reiterating your points, the max you’ll get is a 21/30 for content.

9. Do not allocate time specifically for checking your essay at the very end. Golden ratio 2: 3 is to 1. For every 3 sentence, proofread once and make necessary changes on the spot. You will run out of time.

10. Ensure that you play around with punctuations (especially your parenthesis such as em dashes and others such as semicolons) to demonstrate vivid application of linguistics to score for language.

General reminders:

1. Each paragraph must infuse at least 5 examples - none needs to be explained in detail. You’re not scoring for bombastic examples. In fact, Cambridge don’t care how crazy and well elaborated your example is. You’re scoring for connecting examples that are from different issues and ideas together.

2. In each paragraph, have minimally 2 examples from different themes (the 6 themes stated in the GP syllabus document are society and culture, the arts and humanities, politics, economy, science and technology, and the environment). You should not be having 1 paragraph per theme - it’s the other way round. You need 2-3 themes per paragraph to demonstrate conceptual understanding.

3. Cut all revisions at this juncture. If you know, you know. No point last minute studying for GP as it will just overload (and fry) your brain. Stay fresh. (I suggest you get a black coffee no sugar from your school’s cafe, cheap yet helps you stay afresh. I did that for all my papers - works very well.)

I want to book a 7 day Alaskan cruise in 2027, for myself and my husband. Looking for any thoughts or opinions from experienced cruisers. I was 12 the last time I was on a cruise (early 30s now).

* Good food (and cocktails and coffee) is very important. I don't mean like foie gras and caviar (I like neither of these things) - just in general high quality, even the basics.
* Interested in scenic, nature, and wildlife focused excursions. I guess that's Alaska in general...
* Not much interest in pools, hot tubs.
* Want a smaller ship, don't like crowds or feeling like cattle. 

Budget is in the neighborhood of $15k (not including flights/hotels). 

I keep finding myself going back to Seabourn... good choice? The small ship, the way they promote their excursions / ""ventures"" has hooked me. They have an onboard credit deal going on now...

I've been searching on this subreddit of course, and have some idea, but if anyone has reviews or thoughts to share.

Are there other options the fit the bill I should look more closely at? What lines are most comparable, that I should price and compare?

Also: how do I find a good travel agent? Clearly I need one?",2,1762124508.0,FATcruises,21,1.0,False
