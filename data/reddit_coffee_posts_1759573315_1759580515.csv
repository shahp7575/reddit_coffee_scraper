( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

I get it. Dating can feel like stepping into a spotlight when you'd rather be chilling in the background. But here's the thing: you don't have to change who you are to find love. You just need to nudge your comfort zone a bit and let your awesome, quiet self shine. I've been there, and these steps helped me build confidence without feeling fake. Start with loving yourself first. Every night, grab a notebook and jot down three things you did well that day, like making small talk with a coworker or holding eye contact with a stranger. It sounds small, but it trains you to see your own worth. Next, practice talking to people in easy, no-stakes settings. Think hobby groups, book clubs, or even a quick ""cute dog, what's its name?"" to someone at the park. Apps like Meetup are great for finding folks who share your interests, so conversations feel natural. When you're ready to date, start small. Try online apps like Bumble or Hinge, where you can chat through messages before meeting up. Keep first dates short, like a 45-minute coffee, and have a couple questions ready, like ""What's a place you've always wanted to visit?"" or ""What's a movie that stuck with you?"" This keeps the convo going without you carrying the whole thing. Rejection? It happens to everyone. Instead of thinking ""I'm not enough,"" tell yourself ""We just weren't a match."" After a few nos, you'll see it's no big deal. Your shyness is actually a superpower. Those thoughtful pauses? They show you're listening. A simple compliment, like ""You have such a warm laugh,"" feels so genuine coming from you. If you get nervous, fidget with a ring or take a slow sip of water to stay grounded. Keep up habits like exercising, reading, or even talking to a therapist to stay strong. Celebrate every step, like sending that first message or surviving a date. You're not racing to find ""the one."" You're just showing up as you, and that's more than enough. Take one tiny step this week, and you'll be amazed at how the world meets you halfway.",7,1759580264.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

this is my first purchase of a moka pot- I had it 8 months and recently moved to a new house. The fire on the stove is very hot- and my handle and top melted off ! Then! the inside was very burned, and i was trying to clean it with a vinegar pass cause i have heard you can do that- 

i let it sit for a week- then decided when my roommates were out i would try clean it by boiling it in vinegar baking soda water! i came back 5 minutes later lots of bubbles, GREAT! UNTIL I SAW THAT IT IS NOW DARK GREY! 

I then tried scrubbing it with a scratchy pan sponge....

I feel like everything I am doing is wrong, and thats okay if it is true! I had a bad coffee luck week with minimum sleep so I see where my mistakes came from.

Is there anyway of saving my corroded moka pot or is it now-- an art piece--

I had found an account where the guy even wood cut his own handle and thought of doing that but with the hot fire now i'm scared it might just catch on fire! is this also because my moka pot is too small for the flame?

Sad day - maybe i am an example of what not to do with your moka pot

-L- chicken Cesar salad or sometimes pizza or egg salad 
-D-  Chicken Orzo or meatloaf or chicken tacos or lasagna (I ALWAYS cook at home)

They were just making jokes and all talk. i.e. I would drive to a place close to where they live to have coffee/beer.

 The moment i stopped making an effort , they would just act like something was wrong with me. And when i stopped putting up with them making the so called ""friendly"" racist jokes on me, they act like i am being senstive.  Now i dont talk to them.

the way your hair looks underwater,

Unseasonable weather, that – I kind of hoped we would have at least until November... 

There is a pair of wood pigeons living in our avenue.  

Over the years, we have established an unspoken agreement: when the weather turns foul, I will crack open the sliding glass pane on my balcony, close the door to my room, and let them have the space until the storms pass.  
 
Lately, they have come to trust me enough to wait on the overhead cables until they see me puttering about with my coffee mug, and then fly over and wait on the ledge for me to let them in.  

Sometimes they'll even let me hang around until I finish my coffee. 

This morning, only one of them flew over.  
I thought it might just be one of those days when they're tired of human company – the gods know I have enough of those myself – so I retreated into the office and left them to it. Surely my reluctant friend would remember I only ever wanted to help, not harm...  

Except, when I checked half an hour later, I still saw its huddled shape outside, hanging onto the wire as if it could make the winds stop if only it could remain motionless long enough. 

I left out some food and went back inside.

But as I peer through the closed door now, with another mug of coffee still hot enough to help the weather in obscuring my view and still only *one* pigeon inside, I can't help but wonder what I could have possibly done to merit this complete revocation of trust.  

And I wonder...

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

First Draft: “What are you guys talking about?” I called out as I walked over, a group of my colleagues sat in front of an inscribed tablet in the Caereos museum, they seemed to be discussing which emperor was truly the greatest. “Oh? Who’d you guys put forward?” I cross my arms, a subtle smirk on my lips curious of their answers, I can probably guess…Aulus, Cassius…oh no wait they definitely said Julius Flavian that pompous dickwad, I shake my head as they all but confirm my hypothesis “you guys have no imagination, it’s always the same ones with you, the same ones that anyone ever talks about” I sigh, prepared to leave before one of them in an off-handed throwaway manner asked ‘Ok then, who would you pick?’ I froze, turning slightly “you really wish to know? Okay…” I clear my throat before taking my seat among them “Cnaeus Leonius” I say proudly, a bit too proud I admit but it’s true, I adore the Leonius line but specifically Cnaeus. Immediately I’m met with ridicule, from ‘the myth? We meant real ones’ to ‘the guy was hyperbolized and even if it was true it led to centuries of tyranny after him because of what he did’. I just sat there and took it, a mix of embarrassment and anger at their words, I studied Cnaeus, STUDIED HIS REASONING, and they dismiss it so quickly “what did he do that was so bad?” I ask quietly, almost hoping they didn’t hear, and that’s when they said it, Cnaeus greatest decision but also his greatest folly ‘that idiot abolished the senate, the very thing that kept Caereos stable and alive’. I snapped, not openly, that’s not my style, but in a collected way, sharp, firm, louder than intended, than ever before “okay then smart ass, do you know why he abolished it?” None could answer, they never could, Cnaeus’s legacy is often met with ridicule due to his actions, but none understand why he did what he did, sure they heard tales but never concrete fact. “Okay then, I’ll tell you, it all began in 59 CE whe…..” the scene shifts, going back in time decades, centuries, millennia, all the way back to the imperial palace of Caereos where a young boy is white mischievously cheating at Lattunculi, that young boy is none other than Cnaeus Leonius Aurelian Amatus, but right now he is simply Cnaeus the newly appointed Princeps.

Second/Improved Draft: “What are we arguing about today?” I asked, wandering over with a coffee I definitely couldn’t afford and absolutely needed. Same old museum lounge, same group of overeducated egos pretending they’re not just gossiping with footnotes. And there it was. Emperor debate. Again. I didn’t even have to hear names, I knew them by heart. Aulus, the golden founder. Cassius, the philosopher king. And of course, Julius fucking Flavian, poster boy for safe, boring opinions. “You guys ever get tired of picking the same three names over and over?” I said, leaning against the bench. “Like, I get it. Found the empire, reformed the taxes, stopped a rebellion. Congrats, give them a cookie.” One of them snorted. Alright then, genius. Who would you pick? I grinned before I even answered. “Cnaeus Leonius.” Silence. Then laughter. Then worse, that slow, condescending smirk people do when they think they’re smarter than you. Oh, come on the myth? The guy who nuked the senate? That guy? Yeah, abolishing the one thing keeping the empire from collapsing. Brilliant choice. I rolled my eyes in annoyance. Here we go. Same recycled talking points, same tired jokes. I swear half of them learned their history from bad documentaries and internet threads. “Do you guys even know why he did that?” I asked. Blank stares. Shrugs. One guy tried to sip his coffee dramatically to avoid answering. “Right. Of course you don’t,” I muttered. That’s the thing, everyone knows the headline: Cnaeus abolished the senate. No one ever talks about why. No one talks about the rebellion, or the betrayals, or the fact that he built one of the most prosperous centuries in imperial history from the ashes of that decision. They just point at the fallout centuries later and scream ‘Bad emperor!’ without an ounce of context. “Fine,” I said, louder this time, heart thumping with that stupid, stubborn fire it always gets when someone insults him. “If you’re gonna talk shit, at least understand the story. It started in 59 CE, when…” and suddenly, the walls of the museum were gone. The centuries peeled back like pages in an old book, and we were in the heart of the Caerean palace, where a boy barely old enough to shave was mischievously cheating at a game of Lattunculi. That boy was Cnaeus Leonius Aurelian Amatus. But back then, he was simply Cnaeus, a young boy who cheats at board games.",1,1759579432.0,fantasywriters,0,1.0,False

I found over the last several years questioning the validity of Astrology, not in a definite way but more of a case of does that fit?

I've tried personal experiments of curiosity, particularly in the sense of ""changing myself"". Trying things like Law of Assumption (particularly Neville Goddard), I tried joining a psychological conservation organisation, different forms of meditation etc. 
But you know what Astrology just makes sense to me.
And being a Scorpio makes a lot of sense to me. None of my close family are and my own personal preferences explain a hell of a lot as to why I am the way I am. On levels that I don't even want to admit. It's the same thing with partners, I've always been dissatisfied. Wanting to give love and receive in certain type of way, and not needing to ask for it, because frankly it spoils the nature of it.

Even to the level of loving very elemental things like cast iron pans, old oak furniture, fresh herbs, good coffee, blue cheese, rich vocabulary etc.

And to me it isn't a sense of wanting it all to be different but to be in and around cohesion and people who share the same sensibilities. I can't assume away my nature, to me that's maddening!

I'm curious to know your own journeys, and whether you can help fill in the blanks. And any decent Astrology books, not shitty New Age marketing MyersBriggs type bollocks, but the kind that their weird Hippie Grandad can betroth to you. I hope you catch my drift.

Yeah, you read that title right - but there is a lot to cover here, so we'll get to the Revenge stuff later. For now, grab some warm dark elixir (or coffee, whatever term you prefer) and enjoy.

# Town Hall Weapon Level Removal

[As was announced previously](https://supercell.com/en/games/clashofclans/blog/news/upcoming-changes-to-spring-trap-th-weapon-level-removal/), this update will remove the Town Hall weapon levels from TH's 12, 13, 14 and 15. These TH weapons were introduced to give (maxed out) players more things to do. However, as time as progressed, these levels now act as bottleneck for players progressing through the game. Other info:

* The weapon will still be there, and will be level 1 for all players at these TH levels - exactly like how TH 16 currently works
* The weapons will have the stats of the maximum level previously possible, so don't worry!
* Any ongoing upgrades will be cancelled, with no resources being refunded. So, cancel that upgrade now if you have one ongoing

# Spring Trap Rework

In the [same announcement as the TH weapon level rework](https://supercell.com/en/games/clashofclans/blog/news/upcoming-changes-to-spring-trap-th-weapon-level-removal/), a Spring Trap rework was announced. The changes are laid out again below - with some stats. And yeah - Builder Base is getting some levels as well. Stats & costs can be seen below.

* Spring Trap is a 1x1 trap that triggers when ground troops enter its Trigger Radius. After a small delay, the Spring Trap picks the highest housing space troop in its Damage Radius, and it applies the following to that one troop:
   * If the troop is lower or equal to Spring Capacity, eject the troop
   * If higher housing than capacity, apply high damage
      * If Hero, half of that damage is dealt
      * If a troop is killed by the trap, eject it
   * If troop is not killed, it gets thrown to the air for a short while
* If two Spring Traps trigger at the same time, we want, Spring Traps ignore targets currently being thrown to the air while looking for targets in Damage radius (to avoid doing damage from both traps to a single target at once)
* Level 5 Spring Trap in Builder Base
   * The same rework has been applied to Builder Base Spring Traps, and level 5 has been added.
   * Spring Capacity of all Spring Trap levels in Builder Base is set to 4 because the increasing value no longer made any difference

[Spring Trap stats thanks to our beloved Clash Ninja](https://preview.redd.it/kciqbkpl43tf1.jpg?width=779&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=34c6c5884ae372213b0ec1f715ac73065d42cfe8)

# Balance Changes

* Diggy will now stun his target upon surfacing, regardless of whether or not the target is a defensive building. This means Diggy can now stun defending Heroes and Clan Castle troops
* Heroic Torch movement speed increase now also applies to Grand Warden himself
* Make Grand Warden less likely to form group with Boogers and follow Boogers
* Defensive Furnace now does a bit less damage so that 1 maxed out Firemite doesn’t kill maxed out Healer anymore

# General Improvements

* Added a toggle in 'More Settings' to hide Obstacles and Decorations in a defender Villages when attacking. Obstacles and Decorations will disappear a few seconds after an attack begins
* Town Hall description has been updated to be more concise
* Builder Base Heroes now have stat bar for their ability level increasing
* Headhunter now shows how much poison damage he does
* Equipment in the Hero Hall are now sorted as such:
   * All Commons, in order of Blacksmith unlock order
   * Equipment will no longer re-arrange based on level
* Clashmas Trees now say what year they are from. Show off your 2012 Clashmas Tree!
* Clan Games configuration has been changed to always display 8 home village tasks and 4 builder base tasks
* Following added to chests
   * Skins
      * LNY '24 RC
      * Space AQ
      * Egypt GW
      * Football RC
      * Wild west GW
      * Clash Games BK
      * Anime RC
      * Clash-o-ween 2024 AQ

# Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue where the Forge would indicate that you could not afford to use it when you could, and vice versa
* Yetimites spawned by Yetis and Super Yetis taking damage will correctly spawn scattered around the Yeti, rather than on top of each other
* Fixed an issue where Goblin Researcher info texts would reference “building” instead of “researching”
* Fix bug where Grand Warden could sometimes die while auto-activating Eternal Tome ability if there was too much incoming damage at precisely the same moment
* Fix bug where units would sometimes get stuck inside Walls after Heroic Torch ability runs out
* Fix erroneous interaction between penetrating projectiles and units protected with Ice Block spell. The spell did not protect units with very low hit points properly
* Fix erroneous interaction between underground units and Ice Block spell. The spell did not freeze them properly
* Fix bugs where arrows didn’t work correctly when being used when scouting in a War, they sometimes loaded wrong things

# Economy Changes

Reduced the resource upgrade costs and upgrade times for a large variety of upgrades across many Town Hall levels, including defenses, troops, spells, heroes, and pets. 5 upgrade levels for the Barbarian King, Archer Queen and Grand Warden will move from Town Hall 15 to Townhall 14 to smooth the distribution of Hero level upgrades across the different Town Hall Levels.

It is too much to just list on Reddit, so if you wanna get into the details, check out this sheet: [October Update Upgrade Cost & Duration Changes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQkrgYZb6GGUVixwL_p189cbiY9dAq91BTQL0iO4NEKbPqLLQW-PvGizGIgSbpHrdrGCp0nq-CPHPBS/pubhtml).

**Loot Bonus**  
In addition to the TH Loot penalty that is currently applied when a player attacks a TH level lower than their own (did you know this existed?), we have now also added a loot bonus when players attack a TH higher than their own.

*Current system*

* The Loot penalty for attacking lower TH levels is calculated and not visible to players. They only see the possible total loot available on the base in multiplayer:

|TH Level difference|Percentage of loot available|
|:-|:-|
|Same or higher|100%|
|1 level lower|80%|
|2 level lower|50%|
|3 level lower|25%|
|4 or more levels lower|5%|

*New system*

* Add a multiplier to loot available in multiplayer attacks against targets that are a higher TH level than the attacker:

|TH level difference|Percentage of loot available|
|:-|:-|
|4 or more levels higher|200%|
|3 levels higher|175%|
|2 levels higher|150%|
|1 level higher|120%|
|Same level|100%|
|1 level lower|80%|
|2 levels lower|50%|
|3 levels lower|25%|
|4 or more levels lower|5%|

**Loot Cart**

Cutting the loot that the Loot Cart pays out from 20% of the largest defense taken to 10% to redistribute this income to more exciting and engaging features. Intended behavior:

* The attacker received the expected amount of loot from each attack
* The first attack spawned a loot cart for the defender
* The amount of loot in the loot cart was 10% of the resources lost to the attacker
* If a subsequent attack looted less of any given resource, the loot cart did not update the loot amount for that resource
* If a subsequent attack looted more of any given resource, the loot cart updated the loot amount for that resource (and only that resource) to the new, higher value

# Shield and Guard Changes

These changes aim to make the game's Shield mechanics more understandable, remove friction when starting a multiplayer battle, and **re-enable the Revenge feature** (yippie!).

* Remove Village Guard:
   * Removed from being awarded after defenses and when Shields expire
   * Removed from the Shop
* Introduce Magic Shield:
   * Magic Shield replaces the Shield
   * It is awarded when **30% or more of the available loot is stolen**
      * Attacks not meeting this criterion do not generate a Magic Shield (nor a Revenge opportunity) for the attacked Village
      * Awarded Magic Shield is **always 8 hours in duration**
   * Villages with Magic Shield can be attacked, and they will always be attacks on Shadow Bases. Shadow Bases are the [""cloned bases"" introduced earlier this year](https://supercell.com/en/games/clashofclans/blog/release-notes/welcome-to-clash-anytime-update/#:~:text=clone%20of%20your%20base%20enters%20the%20matchmaking%20pool)
      * Loot rewards are generated by the economy (and the same applies to Revenge attacks)
      * Generates a defense log entry, but a Magic Shield icon will indicate that no actual loot or trophies are taken from the defender
      * Players can not see when they have attacked a Shadow Base, and these entries will contain all stolen loot and Trophies as currently
   * A Magic Shield can be purchased in the Shop:
      * 1d=100 Gems (4d cooldown)
      * 2d=150 Gems (7d cooldown)
      * 1 week = 250 Gems (35d cooldown)
* Players can choose to remove their Magic Shield
   * Migration: Players' old Shields will turn into Magic Shields on release
      * Shields longer than 8 hours will transform into Magic Shields longer than 8 hours
* Re-engaging players will receive a 48-hour Magic Shield (as opposed to a 24-hour Guard as currently)
* Players in Legend League will have the option to purchase a Legend Shield from the Shop, which is different from the Magic Shield, which protects loot in Battles
   * The Legend Shield allows players to take a break in Legend League
   * It applies to the following League day
   * Players may not attack or be attacked while under a Legend Shield

# Revenge

Ever tried to use the Revenge button only to see that they already have an active shield? Or they are already being attacked? Or they are online? Or they are just existing? Yeah. Well, strap your Revenge tapping fingers, because this update will contain a rework to properly enable the feature to revenge people! Some info:

* Defenses where the attacker took more than 30% of the available loot can be Revenged
   * In the case that replays have been invalidated, defenses cannot be Revenged
* A Shadow Base is generated for every Revenge attack, regardless of the target’s Magic Shield status
   * Targets without Magic Shield do not receive any Shield when Revenge-attacked
* After a defense, defenders have 12 hours to avenge the attack
* Loot in Revenge attacks:
   * Resources (Gold, Elixir, Dark Elixir)
   * League Bonus
   * Stars towards the Star Bonus

**When is Revenge possible?**

*Battles that are eligible to Revenge*

* Any battle that triggers a Magic Shield for the defending player is then eligible to be Revenged within the Eligible Revenge Period with a few exceptions:
   * The Revenge period has expired (see below: Eligible Revenge Period)
   * Revenge is only available if the replay is valid with the current version. If the replays are invalidated then revenge is not possible (“Revenge Ineligible”)
   * If a player hits the Revenge button and then hits the “End Battle” button within the battle UI before they deploy any troops, then the Revenge is cancelled and the Revenge button is no longer active (“Revenged”)
   * Note: attacks where the attacker has upgraded into Legend League after the attack **can** now be revenged in the new system where we have split competitive/casual mode
* Examples of battles that do *not* trigger a Magic Shield and therefore cannot be revenged:
   * Attacks where <30% of available loot is looted by the attacker (no Magic Shield is awarded)
   * Attacks against a mirrored base (mirror defenses do not trigger a Magic Shield because no loot is stolen from the defender)
   * Re-revenge is not allowed (revenging a revenge attack - since the revenge was done against a shadow and did not trigger a Magic Shield), even if the player who attacked is currently not under a shield and a Magic Shield.
   * Revenge attacks that happen against a base that is unshielded will still be done against a shadow (due to the loot top up system) and will **not** trigger a Magic Shield for the defender.

*Loot available in a Revenge Attack*

* In Revenge attacks, players may win:
   * Loot (generated from the system, like a regular shadow attack)
   * League Bonus
   * Stars (that count toward the daily star bonus)
* To incentivize players to use the revenge, even in cases where the defender is “attacking up” to a stronger attacker, revenge attacks will always have at least the amount of loot that was stolen from the original attack that triggered the Revenge. The top up should distribute the resources evenly between collectors/storages and the treasury.

I know a lot of women have this issue. So I'm looking for recommendations for an OBGYN who will hear me out when I talk about my emotional roller coaster during perimenopause and not just throw pills at me. 
I've had doctors tell me to go see a psychiatrist, which I did. I have tried SSRIs, SNRIs, anxiety treatments all which have destroyed my body.

 I just want someone to look at my hormones. My endocrinologist charged me $550 to run my hormones one time because insurance didn't cover it and no further testing was done. 

On paper, I'm a normal functioning 42-year-old female who is athletic and healthy. I have an 18 year old and a 4 year old, am a corporate nurse manager, and just want to feel normal more than one week out of the month.
I'm tired of guzzling gallons of coffee or running sprints to wake up... Hiding in the bathroom to cry because everything makes me emotional, feeling completely nauseous for two weeks out of the month and having terrible night sweats I have tried all the supplements is driving me insane I just want a good doctor who will listen and look at me holistically. 

So much rant :/

# Chapter 10: Toward the Sky

Vesper pulled Jian into the corridor beyond the heavy bay door. Her comms still buzzed with manufactured panic, a thin connection to the living parts of the Hab as she kicked off into the darkness. The airlock that separated this section from the hard vacuum outside had cycled open years ago, its mechanisms long dead. Darkness swallowed them. Their helmet lamps cut weak beams through the scattered debris of a life abruptly interrupted. 

A decade. Ten years of slow decay, and this was where it had begun. She remembered the bright, clean plasteel of these very corridors, echoing with children's laughter back when Hab-Unit 8 had still stood on the red sands of Mars. The recycled air was tinged with the aromas of communal meals from the galley. Vesper used to duck and weave through the crowds here, playing tag with other kids back when Hab-Unit 8 had still stood on the red sands of Mars, when they still had gravity

Later, she’d learned to move without it, squeezing into tight maintenance ducts behind those same living units. Multitool in hand, she had for years tried to coax life back into rusted water systems, patching hairline cracks in bulkheads with a desperation that burned in her lungs and stung her eyes with sweat.

“Keep moving, Jian,” Vesper said, her voice low in her comms as she clutched Jian's hand. She kicked off the wall, ignoring the fresh spike of pain in her ribs as she pulled Jian behind her. His suit patch held, dark and stark against the faded fabric of his thigh, but he still grimaced with every slight acceleration.

She’d spent weeks in this sector, a ghost in a fading machine. Then, the alarms blared the order: *Evacuate. This section is lost.* The last ones out had closed the heavy bulkhead seals, and the Hab's pumps had hummed, methodically reclaiming every molecule of precious oxygen for the still living sections. She could almost feel the walls drawing inward as her world shrunk around her. 

They drifted past rows of defunct environmental controls, their displays dark, buttons caked with a decade of dust. Vesper remembered Tanaka teaching her how to recalibrate the atmospheric scrubbers here, patiently guiding her small hands over the complex interface. Now, everything stood cold and useless, relics of a lost fight.

“This way,” Vesper said. 

They angled into a narrow transit tube, a black vertical tunnel that once ferried residents between decks. It was a tight fit, choked with dangling cables and snapped conduits that scraped against their suits. Her own movements were stiff, her bruised body protesting every push, every twist. Jian, behind her, scraped heavily against the tube walls, his breathing ragged in her ear.

They emerged into what was once a bustling communal living block. Now, it was a silent, sprawling tomb. Overturned chairs floated, bumping softly against the walls. Faded holo-images of smiling people, still pinned to the wall by magnetic clips, mocked the stillness. Personal items—a child’s worn plush toy, a stack of data pads, a mug caked with the remains of synth-coffee—hung suspended in the vacuum. 

Vesper ran her gloved hand along a cold bulkhead. It vibrated faintly with the distant hum of the Hab's living sections, a low, resonant thrumming that seemed to mock the dead silence of this part of their home. 

“We're almost there,” Vesper whispered, mostly to herself. A familiar dread settled in her gut. She knew what lay ahead: the collapsed sections, the tight squeezes, the constant danger of getting pinned. They were in the ghost corridors, running from one dying world to another.

They pushed through a narrow gap where a support beam had buckled, twisting a communal galley unit into a maze of broken plasteel and snapped conduits. Vesper went first, her lithe body twisting, squeezing through a space barely wide enough for her helmet. Her bruised ribs screamed a fresh protest. She ignored it, pulling Jian through behind her. He grunted with effort, his injured leg catching on a floating shelf.

“Here,” Jian rasped, his helmet lamp fixing on a small, collapsed play structure tangled in a snarl of dead cabling. “This is where Tobi… where he used to hide.”

Vesper remembered the bright colors of the slide, the echo of Tobi’s breathless giggles as he babbled about becoming a pilot. Now, only dust and silence clung to the warped plastic. So many hadn't made it. It felt like a march through a graveyard of ordinary lives, lives she had known, lives she was now leaving behind. A dull ache settled in her chest, a grief for a home that was still breathing, but already felt gone.

Ahead, a faint glow cut  through the oppressive blackness—a functioning internal airlock. It promised air, warmth, life. Vesper pushed harder, pulling Jian with renewed urgency. 

Only now she realized the distance they had covered, the sheer volume of abandoned space between them and Sector 7’s cargo bay. The old hydroponics lab, the recreational hall, three full residential blocks—all dark, depressurized, their air reclaimed, their purpose gone. Over the years, the Hab had contracted like a dying star, their lives becoming tighter and tighter within an ever-smaller bubble of warmth and air. 

The airlock’s outer hatch hummed softly with dormant power stirring after a long rest. Vesper guided Jian through, pushing him gently into the inner chamber first. He hung there, weightless, as she found the stiff mechanism of the inner door control. The lever resisted her, but gave in in the end, securing the seal against the hard vacuum of the dead sections with a soft *thump*. 

Then, she slammed her palm against the air cycler’s activation plate. With a low, growing hiss, the airlock began to pressurize. Vesper closed her eyes, the phantom warmth against the fabric of her suit covering her arms in goosebumps. They were through.

The airlock's inner door hissed, then unlocked with a soft *clunk*. Vesper braced herself against the wall, pushing the stiff hatch open.

Sound slammed into her. After the oppressive silence of the dead decks, the cacophony was a physical blow. The roar of hundreds of voices, panicked shouts echoing off the curved bulkheads, the insistent blare of evacuation alarms, the shriek of overworked thruster vents from distant emergency teams—it all crashed over Vesper, vibrating through her suit, overwhelming her senses. Her head swam, a violent disorientation after the vacuum’s perfect quiet.

“We've got to get off our suits,” Vesper stuttered into Jian’s comms, pulling him through the doorway. The EDF was already on the Hab. Two kids in full EVA gear would draw their attention in the stream of civilian evacuees.

She started with her own, fingers fumbling at the neck seal. The sudden rush of warm, humid air as her helmet came free made her gasp. It hit her lungs with a dusty taste, thick and slightly acrid. The Hab’s air was rich with the smells of stale bodies, recycled nutrients, and the faint tang of ozone from failing power conduits. Even in the 'living' sections, decay clung to every molecule.

Her helmet remained hovering where she left it. Her gauntlets followed, then the torso piece. The twisting movement made her bruised muscles scream, but the relief of freedom from the rigid suit overwhelmed the pain.

“Here,” she said, her voice rough, pushing Jian towards a recessed alcove, barely out of the main traffic's flow. “Let me help you with that.”

Jian fumbled at his own suit, his movements clumsy. Vesper locked her magnetic boots against the floor to stop both of them from drifting with the flow of the receding air. She opened the shoulder clamps, pulling at the thick fabric of his arm. Jian hissed in pain, trying to put on a brave face. Vesper offered a reassuring smile as she eased the stiff material away from Jian's injured limb. The blood had thoroughly soaked the faded fabric of his pants.

“Deep breath now,” Vesper told him. 

She ripped open her medical kit again, pulling out the rolled bandage. Her hands worked quickly, efficiently, despite their trembling. The clean white fabric wrapped tightly around his thigh, applying pressure on the wound. It wouldn’t hold forever, but it would buy them time to get to the others. To safety.

“Vesper, we need to hurry,” Jian whispered, his eyes fixed on the growing chaos outside their small alcove. The alarms seemed louder now, the shouts more urgent.

“I know,” Vesper replied, adding an extra knot to the bandage. She took his hand. “Let’s go.”

Tightening her grip, she pulled him out of the alcove and into the main stream of the evacuation. The Hab’s interior corridor pulsed with bodies, a frantic current of teenagers with the odd adult among them. Shouts echoed from every direction, directives from the council members trying to manage the flow.

Behind them, a muffled *thump* vibrated through the deck plates. Another bulkhead slammed shut. Another section sealed off. The Hab’s pumps roared with the effort of reclaiming every molecule of air from the abandoned zones. They were shedding their skin, contracting, pushing everyone into a shrinking space. 

Outside a scuffed viewport, the *Spirit of Deimos* hung against the stars, its utilitarian hull dark and imposing. Like black serpents, thick umbilical conduits stretched from the Hab’s main airlocks to the freighter. Vesper watched as a line of cargo pods crawled along one of the umbilicals, a continuous flow of resources shifting from the dying habitat to their salvation. This felt less like a panicked escape and more like a routine they had been rehearsing for years, ever since the first failing sections had forced them to abandon another block, another home.

They joined the churning current of the crowd, swallowed by the press of bodies. The faces around Vesper were etched with a mix of fear and grim determination, a reflection of every Martian who had watched their world shrink in the distance as it burned amid a corporate war.

“Vesper! Jian!” A sharp voice cut through the din.

Vesper turned her head. Eli, a lanky kid with eyes too old for his face, pushed through the crowd, a battered duffel bag clutched in each hand. He pushed one into Vesper’s arms, then angled to give the other to Jian. Both were surprisingly bulky, packed tight.

“We packed your things for you,” Eli yelled over the alarms.

Vesper nodded, a silent acknowledgment. This felt like it had been a long time coming. Every soul on Hab-Unit 8, every adult, every kid, had been ready to go for years.

Closer to the airlock, Vesper spotted them. EDF officers, spaced out among the civilians, their crisply suited forms a stark contrast to the worn coveralls of the Hab residents. They pointed directions, helped guide groups of children toward the airlocks with the umbilicals. Vesper felt a bitter tang rise in her throat.

*Only when a public display was needed.* Their offers of aid, their solemn faces, it was all for the optics, for the cameras that would surely be broadcasting this 'rescue' across the system. They hadn't lifted a finger to help the Hab when it was slowly dying, but now, with a catastrophe screaming across the comms, they materialized like saviors.

Efficient as they were, the EDF officers looked past Vesper and Jian. The officers' gazes swept over them, focused on the larger picture, the overall flow, the optics. Vesper pulled Jian closer, letting the sheer volume of their peers swallow them. Just two more faces in the current, lost in the mass evacuation of their generation.

Then, a new voice boomed over the public comms, overriding the constant alarm. It was Kaito, his voice clearer now, amplified. “Hab-Unit 8 residents! The *Pathfinder’s* internal pressure has finished equalization! Docking Bay Four umbilical is open for direct transfer!”

A collective sigh rippled through the crowd. Hope. Relief. Vesper felt it too, a dizzying lightness in her chest. They were doing it.

She pushed off the bulkhead, propelling them forward, riding the current of accelerating bodies towards the open maw of the airlock. Air rushed past them, pulled by the powerful fans within the umbilical. They rode the wind from their old home to their new, the acceleration a dizzying pull in Vesper’s gut. Her heart fluttered, not from fear, but from a strange, exhilarating mix of terror and triumph. The *Spirit of Deimos* no longer felt like a tomb. Even with only a handful of its sections glowing like scattered embers in the dark, it felt like freedom.

The airlock cycled, a final hiss before the inner door slid open, revealing the *Spirit of Deimos’s* main transfer deck. 

“We need to find Kaito, he must be worried sick about us,” Vesper said, pulling Jian away from the moving crowd. It wasn’t a long journey, but every push off a handhold, every careful maneuver around a corner, amplified the dull ache in her bruised ribs.

They navigated the freighter’s cold corridors, slowly heating up as the reactor churned with eternal power. The ship was still a skeleton, but a living one now, filled with the murmuring breath of its new occupants. The silence was different here—not the desolate vacuum of the Hab’s abandoned sections, but the expectant quiet of a vessel waiting to begin its true journey.

Finally, a wider bulkhead led them to the bridge access ramp. Vesper pushed through the hatch, her eyes adjusting to the bright illumination of the command deck.

Kaito floated before the main viewport, his back to them, as he watched the Hab’s remaining lights. The comms on the bridge were a low murmur of EDF chatter, of coordinates and assessments. He seemed to carry the weight of every Martian soul on his emaciated shoulders.

“Kaito, we made it back,” Vesper called out to him, her voice softer than she’d intended.

He spun around, his stern features dissolving into a look of raw relief. A controlled push brought him next to them and he enveloped Vesper in a tight, crushing hug, then released her to pull Jian into an equally fierce embrace. 

“You two,” Kaito breathed, his voice thick with emotion. The strictness of the Martian military officer was all but gone. “I can’t believe Tanaka sent you to do something so dangerous. My god, you’re here. You’re safe.”

Jian winced as Kaito’s hug put pressure on his side, but he managed to force a small, brave smile. “She knows that I am the best pilot on the Hab. It went off without a hitch.”

Vesper grinned despite herself. She felt like a liar, playing the hero when they had cut it that close. The relief that washed over her felt warm and dizzying. 

Outside the main viewport Hab-Unit 8 hung before them, no longer a home, but a dying star. Its lights, once a vibrant tapestry, were dimming, winking out section by section as its last people moved to the freighter. Only the green glow of the precious soy plant fields remained, a defiant ember in the heart of their abandoned world.

The EDF chatter began to shift, the rescue protocols slowly giving way to new directives. Vesper heard the clipped voices discussing structural integrity, orbital mechanics, and then, the words that clinched it: “...controlled destruction protocol initiated for orbital object Hab-Unit 8.”

Their home was about to be ripped apart, blown into a million pieces out of the LEO where it had been trapped for a decade. A final, violent act to erase their history.

A green light flashed on Kaito’s console, followed by a crisp voice over the comms: “*Pathfinder*, umbilicals retracted. The evacuation is complete. You are cleared for departure.”

Kaito’s face hardened once again. He pressed a button. “EDF Command, this is the *Pathfinder*.” He paused, letting the words hang. “Due to the long-term microgravity exposure, Hab-Unit 8's refugees won't be able to withstand the artificial gravity of the orbital station. We will proceed directly for the outer planets.”

""Understood, *Pathfinder*. Good travels.""

Vesper watched the EDF response on the main screen, a flicker of relief, almost imperceptible, crossing the face of the EDF officer. They bought the lie. Or perhaps, they just wanted the problem gone—the Martian burden, transferred to a rogue freighter. 

Kaito didn’t wait for them to reconsider. “Helm,” he said, his voice tight with command. “Initiate thrust. Gentle burn. Calculate a vector for the Ceres station.”

The low thrum of the engines deepened, pressing Vesper down against the deck plating. She gripped the cold railing of the console, the gentle pull of the thrust making her bruises ache again. Hab-Unit 8 vanished against the glow of the planet that kept it captive. Earth, too, shrank in the opposite viewport, its beauty an indifferent backdrop to their desperate flight.

The *Spirit of Deimos* accelerated toward the distant pinpricks of the stars. This was the direction they were meant to go. Not merely breaking free of Earth's gravity well, but launching themselves into the great ocean of space itself. Her heart thrummed with something she had never felt before: a strange, exhilarating mix of terror and profound destiny.

They were finally going toward the sky. And the sky, Vesper knew, was infinite.

1nxs1s8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1nxs1s8/first_week_evergaining/,First week ever…gaining 🤪,"just a quick vent…
today is my 5month anniversary on Zep! 
I started at 274, today I’m 202 (5’5” mid 30s female) 

I’ve been hitting cardio 3x a week, weight lifting 2x, cranking hydration, protein, fiber, and hitting my calorie goals consistently. I’ve stayed at 2.5 all the way through. I’ve lost an overall average 3.6lb a week. DEXA scans show I’ve sustained excellent muscle mass and bone density, bloodwork is excellent. I have no loose skin, no side effects, no “turkey neck,” no hair loss, no indications of gallbladder issues. 

In essence—it’s been perfect. 

Until this week. 

Last week, I lost 4.2lb. My weekly weigh in number was artificially low because the night prior I went out to eat, and while the dinner I had was still balanced and fit my goals there must’ve been something sneaky in there my body didn’t like. I was uh…pretty “empty” going into weigh in the next morning. 

So today, I’m technically UP 0.5lb from last week. This is the first time ever—every other week I have lost. I didn’t even know Happy Scale could go RED—ouch! 

I lifted heavy this week, DOMS just subsided yesterday. I got my period (but I have lost every other cycle). I laid off the intense workouts a little, and ate out a few times. I’m moving, had family visiting, and incorporated some intentional celebrations and slowness into these past 2 weeks. 

I’m okay. I don’t let scale “noise” get me down. I love how I look, I know “onederland” is inevitable and coming soon. I understand water retention and other factors that may have caused this to be an “off” week. I’ll go chug my fiber drink, head to pilates, have my protein coffee after, and run errands. I’m just mildly annoyed at losing the “streak.” I’ve had such excellent success this is my first taste of less. Am I still grateful, in awe of myself, loving my body, and riding this beautiful journey? Absolutely. I’ve put in some hard work and taking some extra rest these past 2 weeks was intentional. But I’m also human. And slightly type A…

Anyway, that’s it. Just know even us “super responders” have tough days too 😂 ",3,1759579105.0,Zepbound,3,1.0,False
1nxs1gj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nxs1gj,I built a how to guide generator which makes step by step guides for simple practical guidance questions.,"I've been working on a small project that generates beginner-friendly, step-by-step guides for learning practical skills, anything from fixing a leaky faucet to prepping for a phone interview.

The guides come with simple images for each step and include a chatbot assistant that helps clarify or adapt the instructions based on your specific needs.

It’s still early days, so the generation process takes about a minute, and there’s a limit on how many guides can be made per account for now. Improvements are on the way to make it faster and more flexible.

I’m sharing this here because I’d love to hear your thoughts:

* Does this kind of guide feel useful?
* Are the images helpful in understanding the steps?
* What features would make it truly indispensable for you?

If you’re interested, I’d be happy to share a link in the comments for anyone who wants to try it out and give feedback.

1nxs17e,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1nxs17e/so_my_wifes_going_to_a_gala_tonight_as_her/,So my wife’s going to a gala tonight — as her client’s “date.”,"I’m 44 and my wife is 44. She works on an art advisory committee, so attending galas, events, and client meetings is part of her job. She often meets clients for coffee, lunch, or dinner, and I don’t always know the details and that’s completely normal because it’s part of her work. She’s always professional, transparent about her friendships, and I trust her judgment completely.

Recently, she mentioned she’s going to a gala with a friend, S. He’s a wealthy client she met about a year ago, and they became friends professionally. She introduced me to him once, and he seems like a genuinely good person. He invited her as his “date” to this gala, and my wife said it’s fine.

I did ask her though, if she’s actually going as a “date,” and she just laughed and said, “Date doesn’t always mean romantic.” She said it’s important for her she could get networking and meet new people. Then she smiled and said, “If I get into this gala next time, I won’t need to take that man with me, I’ll take you instead,” while laughing.

She’s been getting ready since morning  picking her dress, hair, makeup, the whole thing. And man, I don’t know why, but I’ve never felt this uneasy about her going out before. I’m jealous, but I don’t want to ruin her opportunity either.

Still, it feels strange… like handing your wife to another man’s arm in front of everyone, even if it’s purely professional. I’m not saying she’d ever cheat  I trust her  but that thought lingers.

So yeah, tonight I’m just going to cope hard. Not sure how I’ll sit here at home while she’s out there shining under the chandeliers, but I guess that’s part of loving someone ambitious.

She said she’ll share her live location, text me during breaks, and not visit any private place or his hotel after. She’ll be back around midnight, maybe later sometimes she comes back to home in the early morning after event

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

# The Helmet

**Classification**: Supernatural Powers, Cosmic-Based Powers, Creation, Reality Manipulation, Chaotic Powers, Conceptual Powers, Reality Manipulation

**Type**: Thought-Based

**Energy Consumption**: None

**Threat Level**: 2

**Summary**:

A rare ability, one day a helmet with the psi symbol appeared in Saiki's room.

Once he put on the helmet, Saiki felt that it contained a great deal of energy, almost comparable to his own. But strangely, the helmet seems to grant him anything he desires.

1,000 coffee jellies? Granted. One day without problems? Granted. No spoilers for a series? Granted.

It seems like the perfect power, or it was, because the helmet broke when he wished to get rid of his powers. In the end, it can't grant everything.

# Trivia

* Saiki regrets not wishing for no more problems in his life.
* The helmet has slowly been repaired over time, and is now almost functional again.
* The helmet only grants Saiki's wishes.

She was nice, helped me get two cookies for free while I was having my coffee. 
Price is okay and affordable, taste is good comparatively to the good coffee outlets here.

We're two adventure-loving guys (23, Blr, chill vibes only) planning a super spontaneous solo-ish trip for Diwali '25. But honestly? We don't have *any* plans yet—and that's the beauty of it! No rigid itineraries, no pre-booked hotels, just pure wanderlust. Here's the vibe:

* **The Plan (or Lack Thereof):** We'll chat budget first (flexible for domestic or international spots—beach, mountains, or hidden gems?), then let a randomizer pick the destination. Focus on stunning nature, epic sunsets, and zero rush. If we love it, we stay longer. Simple as that.
* **What We're Packing:** Good energy, bad jokes, and a shared playlist. Expect bonfires, stargazing, and those ""remember when"" stories.
* **Group Dynamic:** Just us two guys so far, but we're hoping to connect with 1-2 awesome female travelers to make it a balanced crew. Safety first—everyone's comfy, respectful, and on the same page.

If this sounds like your kind of chaos (in the best way), shoot us a DM! We can grab a quick coffee (or virtual chat) to vibe-check and hash out details. No pressure, just potential for some unforgettable memories.

Who's in? Let's turn Diwali into a wild escape! 🚀

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a Premier League clash where Arsenal, the well-oiled machine, faces West Ham, the team that’s currently operating more like a rusty washing machine. On October 4, 2025, at Emirates Stadium, Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal will aim to silence the ghosts of West Ham’s recent upsets while Nuno Espírito Santo’s Hammers try to avoid becoming the latest victims of Arsenal’s relentless march. Let’s break this down with the precision of a surgeon and the humor of a stand-up comic who’s had one too many coffees.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why Your Wallet Should Side With the Gunners

The bookmakers aren’t just handing out free bets—they’re screaming for you to back Arsenal. With odds hovering around **1.2 (implied probability: \~83%)**, Arsenal are favorites to win so heavily that even your Aunt Karen’s “I-just-learned-about-odds” bet would pick them. West Ham? At **15.0 (implied probability: \~6.6%)**, they’re about as likely to win as me convincing my dog to stop stealing socks. The draw? A meager **6.5 (15.3%)**, which is basically the sportsbook’s way of saying, “We’ll throw in a freebie for the optimists.”

The spread? Arsenal are -1.5 goals, meaning they’re expected to win by a margin that would make a mathematician blush. For West Ham to cover +1.5, they’d need to either A) invent a new law of physics or B) borrow Arsenal’s goal net.

---

### Team News: Injuries, Comebacks, and a Dash of Drama

Arsenal’s squad is a Netflix series where the main characters keep returning. Bukayo Saka, fresh off a 96th-minute heroics against Newcastle, is set to play his 200th Premier League game. Will he score? Only Thierry Henry knows, but let’s hope he doesn’t trip over his own ambition like some teams’ strikers do. Key returns include Declan Rice (Emirates’ heartbeat), Martin Ødegaard (the conductor of midfield symphonies), and Eberechi Eze (the magician who turns corners into goals). The only downside? Missing Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus—though Arsenal’s depth is so absurd, they could field a XI made of interns and still outclass most teams.

West Ham, meanwhile, are a cautionary tale. Under Nuno Espíri

Used daily alongside my wet-dry vacuum, this cleaning solution became a companion in my house-cleaning routine, making mundane tasks surprisingly efficient and enjoyable. But like most products, it has its highlights and quirks worth discussing.

**Design and Compatibility**

Right out of the box, what stands out is its compact packaging. Sized at 7.95 x 4.25 x 2.4 inches and weighing just over a pound, it fits perfectly alongside my cleaning supplies without monopolizing space. Paired with its compatibility across various Dreame vacuum models like the H12 PRO, H13 PRO, and several others, it felt great knowing this one formula covered all bases. I tested this with my trusty H12 Dual, and it meshed seamlessly, requiring no effort to set up.  

[Ready to enroll the Dreame Solution ""Solution"" in your daily cleaning routine? **Check Dreame Solution price on Amazon.**](https://reviews.senaar.com/p/b0bm9f5nd2/)

**Usage Ease and Flexibility**

Something I genuinely appreciated was how straightforward it was to use. Diluting it with water, as recommended, was foolproof even for someone like my 14-year-old who entertains haphazard cleaning attempts. The clarity of the dilution instructions ensured there wasn't a situation where I used too much or too little. From hardwood floors to tiled kitchens, this solution showed equal mastery across different surfaces. The simplicity in creating a cleaning formula that caters to so many surfaces is nothing short of brilliance.

**Performance That Speaks for Itself**

Its ability to handle stubborn stains is something I didn’t expect to rave about this much. After an accidental coffee spill on the living room floor, this cleaner tackled the mess with ease. It worked its magic by penetrating the stain, breaking it down, and leaving behind a clean swipe with no residue. What’s more, it didn’t leave my hardwood floors looking dull or stripped of their polish. Instead, they retained their natural sheen, a concern I usually have with cleaning products.

**Positives**

- Compatible with a broad range of Dreame wet/dry vacuums ensuring versatility.
- Efficient cleaning on a variety of surfaces including delicate hardwoods.
- Easy-to-follow dilution instructions that make using it hassle-free.
- Gentle formula that doesn’t compromise the finish of the surface.

**Safe and Pet-Friendly Cleaning**

Having pets running around means safe cleaning is always a top priority. One of the biggest perks of the Solution is its gentle yet effective formula. My fear with most cleaners is the presence of harsh chemicals causing irritation to my cat’s sensitive paws, but this was never an issue. Its safety-oriented formulation allowed me to clean in spaces frequently populated by my little furball without second thoughts.

**Negatives**

- The product only works optimally after dilution, which may bother those expecting an out-of-the-bottle convenience.
- While excellent for most surfaces, it might feel overkill for lighter cleaning tasks where a simpler solution may suffice.
- The packaging material, though sturdy, could benefit from an eco-conscious upgrade to reduce environmental impact.

**Market Rivals**

Comparing it to other household floor cleaning solutions, the Dreame holds its place with its multi-purpose usability and safe formulation. Take Bissell’s range for example, which offers excellent cleaning capacity but often misses the mark with the versatility of product compatibility. Dreame edges competitors with its designed integration for a designated vacuum series while remaining soft yet potent for delicate surfaces. However, rival products like Hoover’s Automatic Cleaning Solution emerge slightly better in terms of fragrance variety. Users prioritizing aromatherapy might lean more toward Hoover, though it sacrifices Dreame’s comparatively better safety features.

**Value Proposition**

Speaking of the Dreame solution’s pricing against that of its peers, it leans more mid-tier. It’s not a budget product, but when factoring in how far a single container stretches after proper dilution, it’s hard not to see the financial wisdom in buying it. While other brands might offer lower upfront costs, they lack the pet-safe assurance and targeted design, making this product feel more like money well spent.

The Trump administration is weighing an equity stake in Critical Metals Corp, a New York-based company developing Greenland’s Tanbreez rare earths project. According to four people familiar with the talks, **Washington could convert a proposed $50 million Defense Production Act grant into an equity stake of roughly 8%.** While no agreement has been finalized, the move underscores U.S. efforts to secure critical minerals vital to electric vehicles, defense technologies, and semiconductors.

Critical Metals purchased the Tanbreez deposit last year for $5 million in cash and $211 million in stock, reportedly outbidding a higher Chinese offer thanks to U.S. government backing. The deposit holds significant quantities of rare earths, gallium, and tantalum—resources largely dominated by China. Once operational, Tanbreez is expected to produce 85,000 metric tons of concentrate annually, with full production targeted by 2026.

**This potential investment follows similar U.S. stakes in Lithium Americas and MP Materials, reflecting a broader strategy to diversify supply chains away from Chinese dominance. The Trump administration has also considered reallocating $2 billion from the CHIPS Act—originally aimed at boosting domestic semiconductor manufacturing—to support critical minerals projects.**

***In addition to the possible equity stake, the U.S. Export-Import Bank is reviewing a $120 million loan to accelerate development of Tanbreez***. That funding would cover technical work and bring the project into production. Despite the momentum, challenges remain, including Greenland’s slow-moving mining sector, environmental concerns, and the harsh Arctic conditions surrounding the site.

Greenland’s strategic importance is not new. Both Trump and Biden administrations have sought stronger ties, with senior officials visiting Nuuk to encourage investment. Trump even floated the idea of buying Greenland outright in 2019. **Today, the focus has shifted to securing rare earths—critical for national security and future technologies—making the Tanbreez project a centerpiece of Washington’s mineral strategy.**

# Oct. 4th 2025~Navigating the Surge: How Mining Can Meet Critical Mineral Demand Sustainably Beyond 2025

[Navigating the Surge: How Mining Can Meet Critical Mineral Demand Sustainably Beyond 2025 - MINING.COM](https://www.mining.com/sponsored-content/navigating-the-surge-how-mining-can-meet-critical-mineral-demand-sustainably-beyond-2025/)

[Meeting Soaring Demand for Critical Minerals](https://preview.redd.it/ymhamhezk2tf1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=26e716cca2fdeb6f119635b14060b7108ef6ca69)

The most critical issue facing global mining companies beyond 2025 is the surge in demand for energy transition minerals—such as copper, lithium, and nickel—against a backdrop of supply chain stress, regulatory scrutiny, and rapidly evolving sustainability expectations. Addressing this challenge requires smarter, more integrated management of mineral sourcing, sustainability impacts, and market risk.

As the world accelerates toward decarbonization, the International Energy Agency projects that demand for critical minerals will at least triple by 2030. Meanwhile, global supply chains remain fragmented, with extraction and refining concentrated in a few countries and complicated by geopolitical tensions, trade restrictions, and fluctuating prices. *Traditional mining operations are challenged to scale up production quickly and responsibly while maintaining transparency, traceability, and compliance across dozens of jurisdictions.*

**Supply Chain Complexity and Ethical Sourcing**

Supply chain complexity and ethical sourcing have become critical challenges for mining companies amid growing global scrutiny on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards. The supply chains for critical minerals now span multiple countries and involve numerous tiers of suppliers, each subject to different regulatory regimes and ethical expectations. This fragmentation creates significant risks—from exposure to labor rights violations and environmental damage to supply disruptions caused by compliance failures or geopolitical factors.

To address these challenges, mining companies require integrated digital platforms that consolidate and monitor real-time data from extraction through processing to final delivery. These platforms automate supplier audits, track certifications, and validate compliance with evolving ESG regulations, including conflict minerals legislation and responsible sourcing frameworks. By creating a single source of truth for supply chain transparency, organizations can detect and mitigate risks earlier, ensure ethical practices across their value chain, and generate the documentation needed for investor reporting and customer assurance.

**Sustainability and ESG Expectations**

Sustainability and ESG expectations are rapidly becoming paramount in the mining industry as stakeholders increasingly demand transparent, accountable, and responsible operations. Mining companies face mounting pressure from governments, investors, local communities, and civil society to minimize environmental footprints, mitigate climate risk, and deliver positive social outcomes.

By 2050, over 60% of mining firms aim to achieve net-zero emissions or carbon neutrality, leading to wide-scale adoption of renewable energy, electrification of fleets, and precision mining techniques designed to reduce land disturbance and pollution.

Robust ESG frameworks increasingly govern mining operations, reflecting the growing demand for responsible and transparent practices. Among the most significant developments is the Consolidated Mining Standard Initiative (CMSI), which unites the best elements of four leading standards—the Copper Mark’s Risk Readiness Assessment (RRA), Mining Association of Canada’s Towards Sustainable Mining (TSM), World Gold Council’s Responsible Gold Mining Principles, and ICMM’s Mining Principles—into a single, unified global standard. This consolidation simplifies the complexity of the current standards landscape and sets clear, high-bar expectations for responsible mining practices across ethical business conduct, worker and social safeguards, social performance, and environmental stewardship.

Alongside CMSI, key international frameworks such as ISO standards and the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol continue to play vital roles in aligning environmental management and carbon emissions reporting within mining operations. Additionally, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Mining Sector Standard 2024 and the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA) 2.0 provide rigorous, auditable benchmarks for sustainability and social responsibility, enabling mining companies to deliver transparent and credible ESG disclosures.

These standards require detailed, auditable disclosures on climate impact, water stewardship, emissions, and social governance, pushing mining companies towards consistent, comparable, and trustworthy reporting.

Together, these frameworks and standards promote continual improvement and accountability in mining’s environmental, social, and governance performance. They guide the industry toward harmonized reporting, diligent risk management, and enhanced stakeholder trust, helping mining companies meet the expectations of regulators, investors, communities, and customers worldwide.

Automated digital platforms that consolidate environmental and social data, support compliance, reduce manual workload, and enable rapid adaptation to evolving regulatory contexts.

**Geopolitical Uncertainty**

Geopolitical uncertainty has emerged as a central risk for mining companies striving to meet the booming demand for critical minerals in 2025. Resource nationalism, shifting regulatory landscapes, and the concentration of mineral extraction and refining in just a handful of countries have made supply chains more fragile and unpredictable. Governments are increasingly enacting export controls, renegotiating mining agreements, and imposing higher environmental and social standards—all of which can abruptly alter the business landscape for global miners.

In this high-stakes environment, advanced risk management solutions provide crucial strategic support—they enable dynamic scenario modeling, track global regulatory changes, and facilitate swift adaptation to new requirements. With real-time intelligence and agile compliance workflows, mining companies can proactively respond to evolving risks, protect their operations, and maintain competitiveness on the world stage.

**Technology’s Role in Meeting Demand**

Technology plays a vital role in helping mining companies meet the rapidly growing global demand for critical minerals by enhancing operational efficiency, transparency, and compliance while reducing environmental and social risks. In 2025 and beyond, digital transformation in mining includes the integration of AI, automation, and advanced analytics into daily operations, enabling companies to scale production sustainably and responsibly.

Advanced platforms enable real-time data collection from connected machinery, sensors, and personnel, providing a comprehensive view of operations that supports predictive maintenance, minimizes equipment downtime, and improves workplace safety. This integration of operational data with environmental, health, safety, and compliance metrics facilitates proactive risk management, faster incident response, and streamlined reporting to regulators and investors.

Transparency and traceability are critical concerns in critical mineral supply chains. Blockchain and digital ledger technologies play a growing role in creating immutable, verifiable records of mineral extraction, processing, and delivery, assuring stakeholders of the ethical and environmental integrity of sourced materials. These technologies automate supplier compliance verification and third-party audit management, making ethical sourcing scalable and credible.

Solutions like IsoMetrix exemplify how integrated digital platforms can transform mining operations. IsoMetrix’s software consolidates environmental, health, safety, risk, and sustainability data into a single system with configurable workflows and intuitive dashboards. This enables mining companies to monitor complex regulatory requirements across multiple jurisdictions, automate compliance processes, and generate transparent, auditable ESG and HSEC reports aligned to global standards. With embedded analytics and alerts, organizations can identify emerging risks early, optimize resource use, and improve decision-making across all operational levels.

Furthermore, IsoMetrix supports the digital upskilling of mine workforces by managing training, competency assessments, and incident investigations in a unified system. This strengthens workforce safety culture and sustains compliance with evolving health and safety regulations.

In sum, the role of technology in meeting the demand for critical minerals extends beyond automation. Integrated software platforms designed for holistic environmental, social, and operational risk management, such as IsoMetrix, enable mining companies to deliver higher productivity, enhanced compliance, and greater transparency—transforming risk into resilience and competitive advantage in today’s complex industry landscape.

# Oct. 2nd, 2025~J.P. Morgan leads groundbreaking rare earth magnets deal

[J.P. Morgan Leads Groundbreaking Rare Earth Magnets Deal](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/banking/investment-banking/mp-materials)

***The public-private partnership between the U.S. Department of Defense and MP Materials accelerates the buildout of a U.S.-based rare earths supply chain.***

https://preview.redd.it/dd2bmybcl2tf1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9cdd8a3dca0cd6ecf2037f6cbbbb7e8542262f7

In late April, on the back of China’s new export controls, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and MP Materials began discussions on how to secure a U.S.-based supply chain of rare earth magnets — essential resources for the production of everything from F-35 jets to iPhones.

That discussion evolved into a deal that saw the DoD become the largest shareholder and customer of MP Materials, which is America’s only fully integrated rare earth magnets producer. This first-of-its-kind arrangement, in which J.P. Morgan was the sole financial advisor and lead left arranger on $1 billion of committed financing, carries key strategic implications for the U.S. and nearshores a critical industry at a time when the evolving geopolitical landscape could disrupt supply chains around the world.

The DoD rarely takes direct equity interests — it mostly issues loans or grants — so there was no blueprint for this arrangement, which included complex commercial, financial and regulatory elements.

***“I think this is one of — if not the most — unique transactions you’ll ever see. There just aren’t a lot of public-private partnerships that resemble an M&A deal like this one.”***

***Andrew Castaldo***

***Co-head of Mid-Cap M&A, J.P. Morgan***

An all-hands-on-deck effort

J.P. Morgan delivered, advising on the structuring and negotiation of the transaction and helping to arrange a $1 billion financing commitment within an ""eight-week timeframe"", which required an all-hands-on-deck effort from senior members of the firm.

“I’ve never done anything like this and I’ve been doing this work for 30 years,” said Andrew Castaldo, co-head of Mid-Cap M&A at J.P. Morgan. “I think this is one of — if not the most — unique transactions you’ll ever see. There just aren’t a lot of public-private partnerships that resemble an M&A deal like this one.”

MP Materials operates the Mountain Pass Mine in California, about an hour south of Las Vegas. It is the only scaled rare earth producer in the U.S. and, with a rare earth magnet manufacturing facility in Texas, has capabilities spanning the entire supply chain for these critical elements.     

The final deal with the DoD will give the company the resources to build an additional manufacturing facility named 10X, which will increase its magnet production to 10,000 metric tons. In practical terms, this will address all of the DoD’s rare earth magnet needs. 

A race against time  

The parties involved reached an agreement on scope early on: both the government and the client were interested in protecting MP Materials’ autonomy and continued growth as a private entity.

However, there were a few hurdles to overcome. For example, the project needed to include funds and planning for the new 10X facility, but things were moving so fast that a site had not even been picked yet, creating difficulties for milestone and timeline-setting.

“This administration wanted to move as absolutely fast as possible while being extremely thorough because we all knew what we were creating was going to be precedent-setting,” said Kevin Colborne, who oversees North American Mining for the Commercial & Investment Bank at J.P. Morgan. “We believe this transaction is intended as a possible blueprint for other industries and companies of national security interest.”

On the finance side, the complex deal demanded an entirely custom structure: a project-based, loan-oriented financing package with an acquisition element. “Everything was built from scratch, fit for purpose and just intense over those eight weeks. The way it came together in the end was extremely fitting for all parties, but intense to the last second,” Colborne said. 

# A template for future public-private partnerships  

***With the government looking to continue this manner of investment, Castaldo noted that the deal has positioned J.P. Morgan as an early expert in advising on and financing public-private partnerships. He said the firm will be looking to mobilize around other, similar situations in different sectors.***

***He also reflected that his biggest takeaways from the landmark deal was a sense of awe at the level of work and effort that happened behind the scenes from such a wide area of expertise — at the client, within the government and at J.P. Morgan. “A lot of people were involved,” he said. “And they were the right people.”***

CENTENNIAL, Colo. (October 1, 2025) – NioCorp Developments Ltd. (“**NioCorp**” or the “**Company**”) (**NASDAQ:NB**) is pleased to announce that the Company took another step this week to advance its application for up to $800 million in potential debt financing to be supported by the Export-Import Bank of the U.S. (“**EXIM**” or the “**Bank**”) to advance NioCorp’s proposed critical minerals project in Southeast Nebraska (the “**Elk Creek Project**”) after executing a professional services agreement with SLR Consulting (“**SLR**”) to conduct an independent environmental and social (**“E&S”**) review, an important part of EXIM’s ongoing project due diligence.

In February 2025, EXIM engaged RPMGlobal USA, Inc., which was subsequently purchased by SLR, to conduct an independent technical review of the Elk Creek Project, which is ongoing.  SLR will now conduct both the independent technical review and the E&S review on behalf of the Bank.

“We are very pleased to advance the due diligence for EXIM’s review of our proposed debt financing by engaging SLR in the E&S review,” said Mark A. Smith, Chairman and CEO of NioCorp.  “The SLR team is an outstanding selection and they are very familiar with our project, given the technical review work they have been conducting since February of this year.  Our team looks forward to engaging with them and EXIM as the due diligence process continues to advance.”

NioCorp’s application for EXIM funding of the Elk Creek Project passed EXIM’s first level of due diligence, known as Transaction Review Committee-1 (TRC-1), in October 2023.  In April 2024, EXIM provided NioCorp with a preliminary indicative term sheet for possible financing.  NioCorp has engaged JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to assist NioCorp in seeking debt financing supported by EXIM. There can be no assurances that the application will advance or be approved by the EXIM Board of Directors nor that debt financing from EXIM will be provided.

[NioCorp: Is becoming a U.S. National Security Asset, for Defense, Clean Energy & Industrial Resilience \(Pending Finance\*\*\*\)](https://reddit.com/link/1nxrjlj/video/zigxmiz5y2tf1/player)

# ✅ Positioned at the center of the U.S. Critical Minerals strategy, NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project offers:

* Multiple **Top 10 USGS-listed minerals**
* Supply chain independence from China
* Vertical integration across mining, advanced processing, and **future recycling**
* Alignment with the **MCS (Multilateral Commercial Stockpile)**, **DoD offtakes**, **EXIM funding**, and the new SMR Critical Minerals Hub

# NioCorp: The Strategic Basket

NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project isn’t just another mine — it’s a **U.S. National Security Asset**. With the U.S. defense and aerospace sector exposed to foreign choke points, Elk Creek’s mix of critical minerals lines up squarely with Pentagon and DOE priorities.

# 🔑 The Mineral Arsenal

* **Niobium (Nb)** – **The** ***quiet giant***\*\*!\*\*! From jet engines to superconductors, SMRs, and quantum systems, niobium is the alloy enabler. **Elk Creek could supply a good portion — potentially all — of U.S. needs, ending dependence on Brazil.**
* **Titanium (Ti & TiCl₄)** – Backbone of airframes, missiles, and armor plating. TiCl₄ doubles as a coatings precursor and is integral to stealth systems and chemical defense. A secure U.S. feedstock is essential.
* **Scandium (Sc & Sc-Al alloys)** – *The game-changer. Sc-Al alloys cut aircraft weight, extend combat radius, and enable Gen VI fighter designs. First scandium metal is targeted for November, with a DoD prime already working alongside NioCorp.*
* **Rare Earths (Nd/Pr, Dy, Tb)** – The permanent magnet core for F-35s, drones, EVs, and Navy ships. *Without them, electrification and defense propulsion grind to a halt. Elk Creek adds a U.S. stream for the most critical magnet REEs.*

# ⚡ Why It Matters Now

* **Defense Assurance** → Elk Creek minerals map directly to DFARS compliance, reducing single-source risk from China (REEs), Brazil (Nb), and Russia/Ukraine (Ti).
* **Industrial Transition** → Aerospace, EVs, quantum, and clean energy all converge on the same supply gaps. Elk Creek is positioned as a multi-sector keystone.
* **Near-Term Catalysts** → 2025 drilling added **9 infill boreholes (+64% more core)** plus 6 step-outs. Assays in mid-to-late October could confirm a resource uplift across all minerals, raising production profiles before the Q4 Definitive Feasibility Study.

# NioCorp Ignition Sequence: Catalysts

* **Scandium Price Floor Set:** Pentagon’s $40M scandium oxide buy from Rio Tinto (\~$6,250/kg) validates scandium’s defense role. Elk Creek is the only U.S. project positioned to deliver at scale.
* **Capital Stockpiled:** $110M— funding momentum into Q4.
* **Government Tailwinds:** Pentagon stockpiling, EXIM/DFC windows, and potential U.S. equity stakes in strategic mineral firms. **(Lithium Americas latest!)**
* **Stacked Catalysts Ahead:** Munich conference, October drill results, scandium-alloy announcements, offtakes, updated DFS, and EXIM FID.
* **Strategic Convergence:** Niobium, scandium, titanium, and REEs — Elk Creek represents U.S. resource independence at scale.

# 🚨 NioCorp: The Flagship U.S. Critical Minerals Strategic Asset Is Now Live (October 2025)

**IMHO- What is starting in Munich just went kinetic!** NioCorp’s presentation at the **Munich Mining Conference (Oct 3–4) is** sparking a wave of institutional buying that pushed the stock to **$7.96 on 16 million shares traded Friday Oct. 3, 2025** — a decisive breakout confirming that the smart money sees what’s coming next. Washington is setting the tone by **taking a 5% equity stake in Lithium Americas**, proving the U.S. government isn’t just *talking* about critical minerals anymore — it’s **deploying capital**. That precedent changes everything. With **Elk Creek**, NioCorp holds the *only* fully-integrated U.S. project combining **Niobium, Titanium/TiCl₄, Scandium, and rare earths** under one roof — a strategic metals platform touching **defense, aerospace, EVs, and clean-energy sovereignty**.

Now the stage shifts to **Washington, D.C.** — the **J.P. Morgan Critical Minerals Forum (Oct 8, 11:05 AM ET)**. Institutions are already defending the **$7.80–$8.20 channel**, positioning for the data cascade ahead: October drill results that could **scale TREO toward 1,000,000 tonnes**, feeding directly into the **Q4 Definitive Feasibility Study**. That DFS locks in **capex, opex, NPV, and RailVeyor efficiencies**, the final metrics big capital has been waiting for. Meanwhile, **Apex’s land expansion** beside Elk Creek confirms district-scale potential, with **Dahrouge** coordinating a synchronized development corridor.

From here, the ignition sequence is fully stacked: **EXIM/DFC financing**, **DoD/prime-contractor equity chatter**, **scandium-alloy adoption news**, and **Maxim’s $12 price target** are converging into a single arc. NioCorp enters Q4 2025 as the *control node* of the U.S. critical-minerals ecosystem **— the project where policy, geology, and finance intersect.** As the U.S. doubles down on resource independence, **Elk Creek stands as the domestic anchor for next-generation materials**. The market sees it. Institutions are positioning. **Ignition window: open.** 🚀

Was spending $127 to acquire customers for a $69 nootropics product. If you're not great at math, that means I was literally paying people $58 to buy from me. Fucking brilliant business model, right?

**Here's what changed everything:**

I was obsessing over our analytics at 2am (as one does when bleeding money) and noticed something weird. The few people who messaged us asking dumb questions like ""does this have caffeine?"" bought at 3x the rate of people who just clicked our ads.

Problem was, I was paying a VA $20/hour to answer the same 5 questions over and over. She was copy-pasting responses like a robot anyway.

So I thought... why not just use an actual robot?

**The Stupidly Simple Messenger Bot That Saved My Ass:**

Instead of sending people to product pages like everyone else, I started sending them to Messenger.

Ad said: ""Not sure which nootropic is right for you? Let's figure it out in 2 minutes""

No bullshit ""SHOP NOW 50% OFF TODAY ONLY!!!"" Just... let's chat.

**The Conversation Flow (Warning: It's Dumb But It Works):**

First message: ""Hey \[Name\]! What are you trying to fix?""

* Can't focus at work
* Tired all the time
* Brain fog
* Just curious

Each answer branches differently. Here's where it gets interesting...

If someone picks ""tired all the time,"" the bot asks: ""Coffee not cutting it anymore?""

When they inevitably say yes (because why else would they be looking at nootropics), bot responds: ""Yeah coffee is so 2019. Let me show you something that actually works without the 3pm crash""

See what I did there? It's having an actual conversation, not just collecting data.

**The Part That Made Me Feel Like a Dick (But Tripled Conversions):**

Question 4: ""Real talk - what's your monthly budget for supplements?""

Anyone who says under $50 gets sent to blog content and a discount code. Sounds harsh? Maybe. But I stopped wasting ad spend on people who were never gonna buy anyway.

**The Results (Holy Shit Edition):**

Month 1: CAC dropped to $98 Month 3: CAC at $81 Month 6: CAC at $67

That's a 47% decrease. From literally losing money to 2.1x profit margin on first purchase.

But here's the part nobody talks about...

**The Messenger List Is Pure Gold**

Everyone who messages you? You own that contact. Free to message. Forever (basically).

* Email open rate: 22%
* Messenger open rate: 87%

Launched a new sleep supplement. Sent one message to our 8,000 person Messenger list. $47k in sales. Zero ad spend.

I almost cried.

**Shit That Went Wrong (Learn From My Stupidity):**

Version 1 of the bot was a disaster. Sounded like a LinkedIn recruiter had a baby with a used car salesman. ""CONGRATULATIONS! YOU'VE UNLOCKED OUR SECRET DISCOUNT!""

People could smell the desperation through their phones.

Version 2: Too many messages. Asked 15 questions like I was conducting a medical exam. Lost 70% of people by message 5.

Version 3: Finally got it right. 5-7 messages max. Casual tone. Actually helpful.

**The Abandoned Cart Recovery That Prints Money:**

Someone adds to cart but doesn't buy?

4 hours later: ""Hey, noticed you left some brain fuel in your cart. Everything okay?""

If they respond (43% do), bot asks: ""What stopped you?""

* Too expensive
* Need to research more
* Changed my mind
* Just browsing

Each answer gets a different response. ""Too expensive"" gets a payment plan offer. ""Research more"" gets customer testimonials.

31% end up buying. FROM A BOT. RECOVERING ABANDONED CARTS.

Meanwhile, my abandoned cart emails get 8% recovery on a good day.

**Technical Setup (It's Not That Hard, You're Just Lazy):**

* ManyChat: $145/month (I have 12k subscribers now)
* Connected to Shopify via Zapier
* Took me a weekend to set up the initial flow
* Now spend maybe 2 hours/month optimizing

**The Psychological Tricks That Actually Matter:**

People engage with quick reply buttons 3x more than typing. Seems obvious now but I wasted weeks trying to get people to type responses.

Also discovered waiting 1-2 seconds before each message makes it feel human. Instant responses feel robotic. Who knew? (Everyone probably)

**My Favorite Part:**

Customer service tickets dropped from 450/week to 120/week. The bot handles all the dumb questions. My VA now actually helps customers with real problems instead of copying and pasting ""Yes, we ship to Canada"" 50 times a day.

**For Those Saying ""This Won't Work For My Business"":**

Buddy of mine sells $2,000 coaching programs. Implemented this same system. Bot doesn't sell anything - just qualifies leads and books calls. His cost per booked call went from $450 to $178.

Another friend in ecommerce fashion. Bot helps with sizing questions. Returns dropped 23%.

**The Bottom Line:**

It's not some secret hack. It's just having conversations with customers at scale without wanting to jump off a bridge.

Most of you won't implement this. You'll read it, think ""cool,"" then go back to burning money on cold traffic to product pages.

Your competitors thank you for your laziness.

**Want the actual templates?**

I have the JSON export files from ManyChat, all 50+ conversation scripts we tested, and the compliance stuff that'll keep Facebook from nuking your account. Let me know in the comment if you want them.

Fair warning: It's a lot. Like, a LOT. But it's literally copy-paste-edit-launch.

PS: To the person who's gonna comment ""this is just email marketing with extra steps"" - yeah, except it works 4x better and customers actually like it. But go off.",1,1759577336.0,dropshipping,0,1.0,False

My best friend F (23) and I F (22) met in freshman year of High-school/end of 8th grade, and we’d been extremely close since. In school we were basically *inseparable* \- I even stayed over at her family’s place for a while when my parents and I were going through a very difficult spot. 

In short summary, our relationship was close to the point we called each other sister, I could walk into her house unannounced for dinner, and she and I were the first people to rant or gossip about literally anything. 

In college, we both got *extremely* busy - on top of having schedules that never matched up, I was at the dorms about an hour away from her, and her campus wouldn’t allow outsiders to visit (not sure if it was because it was a Lutheran University?)College was also, unfortunately, some of the worst years of my life for my depression and chronic health flare ups. 

Communication was far and few between, with me (regrettably) canceling on many plans and her as well. Not as frequently as I did, however, which I to this day feel awful about. At the time I didn’t really know how to ask for help and felt ashamed, and that my life wasn’t measuring up to half of what hers was.

I always made sure to take time to text her whenever she crossed my mind, even just to check up, and showed up to every big event in her life. I.E, art shows, dogs passing, always wanting to hear about her trips and her successes in her growing career and studies. It was difficult, but I NEVER pushed my struggles onto her -  I felt like I would only drag her down. besides; I really cared about her, and I wouldn’t miss those events for the world. 

College didn’t pan out so well. I ended up dropping out - and entering the work force early. 

  
I busted my ass at multiple jobs, and I’m very proud of where I am now with a management job and a decent paycheck. Especially in today’s economy! I’m also in my own apartment with a room mate. 

however; came the problem.

The more my best friend and I met up for coffee or just to catch up, I noticed she was taking less and less interest in my life. I know I didn’t have much going on - she was still in school doing these new things, and I was just… working. But when I DID try to talk, be it a story or maybe a shared memory or even a small update, she would be quick to rush me or shut me down by interrupting or wanting to talk about herself. 

frequently I would notice her giving me these sort of pitying looks or a vibe that I wasn’t meeting her level. 

I won’t lie and say I haven’t changed drastically over the years - I’ve undergone a lot of personal trauma, experienced the death of a childhood animal, worked with many suicidal friends and my own tendencies, and matured into an adult that has had to figure out how tf taxes work. the studious, straight-laced student from highschool was faded - I had finally cracked and broken down, but I was rebuilding myself. 

But I felt like I was a disappointment to her. 

Many of our conversations from that point on were very terse and punctuated - not much of the same enjoyment as when we were in school. but I STILL showed up for her. her graduating art show, for example. 

Out texting had shifted into just me initiating, asking questions, and etc. and I won’t lie and say that she hadn’t initiated before or ever - but I noticed that I had been bad about being consistent during my college years and was trying to make up for it. 

i… ended up missing her graduation. I was scheduled for a work shift even when i had requested off; but my boss was inflexible. I apologized profusely. she said it was okay, with exclamations and big smiley faces. 

She went on a trip - I chatted with her excitedly about it. 

Cut two months in the future, I had been texting her for two days trying to reconnect. at her art show before her graduation we had relit a fire - it felt like we were finally falling back into it! *But she ignored my texts.* 

It took me a bit to realize she had ghosted me. 

I started to get worried - in all my years of knowing her, she had NEVER just ignored me and wasn’t the kind of cruel that just stops listening. I worried that her health condition had put her in the hospital again - it had before, two years ago in college. surely that was it, right? 

After five days I figured out she just didn’t want to talk to me. so, I gave her a text that asked for an explanation, or at least some sort of closure if she had suddenly decided to end the friendship. 

We had a phone call. 

It was one of the worst phone calls of my life. No screaming or blaming- just **utterly emptying.** 

I admitted my faults, for not replying when I should have at times or for canceling on our plans so frequently. I confessed these years hadn’t been kind to me - between college debt, a broken apartment, and my own mental struggles, I had been ripped open raw. But I was finally finding stability. I told her I honestly thought she was okay any time I had cancelled or had to reschedule since she had seemed so genuine, and that I wanted to reconnect. 

She said the opposite. 

Now; I understand growing apart from friends. I’ve parted ways with over 80% of my old friend group due to maturing, people moving, or just naturally letting go with no animosity. this? this was soul crushing. 

My best friend had always been the kind of person who was INSANELY shy and sweet, but confident and could stick up for herself. So I knew she had a backbone. but she cut into me in such a surgically sweet way that I haven’t been able to let it go.

She admitted it had hurt her feelings at first when I kept cancelling - but eventually she didn’t care any more. as a matter of fact, she admitted she hadn’t even thought about me in months. I never even crossed her mind. 

She stated things as if we **both** felt a certain way, kind of looping me into her emotions. saying things like ‘we didn’t see each other as a priority’ or ‘we weren’t important in each others lives.’ 

The real kicker is when she said that she didn’t even notice when I wasn’t in her life anymore. 

She also said in eloquent words that she was only really staying friends with me because of old fond memories - so i could easily summise she didn’t ever really bother to want to know the grown up me. 

I was silent for most of it, and I sounded like a bumbling idiot for the rest. i had just gotten off a 14 hour double shift, i was in severe pain, and it was 12 am for context - but she had asked to call that moment and i couldn't miss the opportunity. I definitely didn’t feel very smart when she was coming at me with dictionary-level diction and sounding as if she was firing an employee rather than saying goodbye to a friend. 

She said she had gone radio silent to hopefully ‘hint to me’, and thought I would accept her intentions. She said she saw it was ‘a long time coming’, when for me, the last few conversations we had ever had she and I had been talking about showing photos and making plans and sending good vibes. it was like a slap. 

At the end of the conversation she said I shouldn’t reach out to her anymore but she would be there ‘in case of an emergency’, but that maybe we could continue our friendship when ‘I had things more together.’ 

At many points during our conversation she hinted through fancy words that she didn’t think I was doing anything with my life or that I was no longer an appropriate friend to have because I was not following the same steps as her. which; I get. it would have been fine if she didn’t rip into me so viciously about it. 

After I had had a chance to sleep, I woke up with lead in my heart. I felt mad - disrespected - and beyond it all, sad. 

I sent her a long series of messages attempting to explain to her how this had been unforseen on my end, how she should have told me that she was upset with me, and that she didn’t need to tear into my so openly. 

I had been there for everything - her hospitalizations, I had driven to her house immediately after her car accident because she couldn’t sleep without company, I had been there for EVERYTHING… but when I really thought about it I didn’t remember her showing up for me like that. or even… ASKING, really, about how I was feeling? 

  
It stings even more recounting how we have a matching tattoo, always talked about me attending her wedding, we came out to each other first, all those sorts of things. Big key moments. 

Ill admit that some of my statements in my response message were passive aggressive. But NEVER would I target her insecurities or curse at her.

But really; am I just overreacting? Was my after-message necessary, or was I just whining about a perfectly valid series of points? Id love some honest opinions from y’all. don’t worry; I can take it! ",3,1759577259.0,AmIOverreacting,3,1.0,False

I’m stage 4, current MELD 10, hospital 10 months, dx 7/24, sober 1y2m now. Just sharing with folks know my experience getting back to whatever “real” life is now. Know that all y’all helped me a bunch, and hopefully I can return some of the love.

So I’ve been teaching HS for 9 weeks now- we have fall break next week- and only missed one day this year, for tests and all. Been keeping some rudimentary data on my overall well being. 

I am finally sleeping pretty solid now. Just mentally and physically worn out at night. I’m sleeping 6 hours a night- one lasik pee break a night. I think that an 8 hour sleep straight may never be in reach again. One thing I’ve kept track of, I have noticed that the fatigue does catch up and you’ve gotta make sleep deposits on the weekend. The fatigue is REAL, I’ve found splitting a half can of Celsius into my water bottle on the AM and the other half in PM and sipping throughout day gets me through. Coffee every AM. I take a B complex shot every Sunday too. 

By Friday, after school, I’m dang near falling asleep at wheel. I don’t nap during the day, and I lm content with 10k steps now. The combo of mental work with basic movements, still knock me out. I’ll do band workouts/stretches for 30 minutes 3 times a week, gym Sat/Sun. I can’t stabilize any dumbbells over 20lbs, use only machine work. Still lose balance if I stand on one leg- not like flamingo stand, but even just self testing with opposite foot just calf high. I don’t trust myself on even a step ladder.

The remnants of HE are pretty evident to me, think it might be me being overly aware of how bad it was for me. Il’ll lose track of my thoughts when speaking and start talking about random, adjacent stories. Almost like the “rambling old man”, but I’m only 44, and im not to that point yet. Overall, I’ve gotten ahold of my moods. I haven’t felt like I’ll snap on a kid anymore at all. Ran into a former student, who’s now subbing, she says “wow, coach, you’re just the same as my senior year”. It made me feel good- and definitely a surprise, as I’m completely other side of city now, and think that I’m a now a nut job. 

Digestion— I went in to the doc for tests, I thought I had ascites again since I’ve gained weight, turns out, no signs at all! So that’s good. I’ve gained weight, not sure why, but I’m not eating with nearly the frequency, still keeping my protein up, but I’m awful thirsty a lot. Still on furosemide, so it’s gotta be related to sodium somehow.

Overall, I’m still figuring it out but I’m SO incredibly thankful to be around all of the life and energy everyday. My administration has told me multiple times that they really appreciate my positivity and how the kids really enjoy my classes. I am in an entirely new school and area of the metro, so the mental challenges of a new place, new rules, new everything was daunting at first, but I’m so glad I’m approaching it all with a new perspective on life, although it’s a crappy underlying reason. 

At any rate, this is my story so far, and I hope to eventually not even think about cirrhosis daily and just get to “living”. 

Thank y’all for all the love and support, hopefully some of my puppy dog energy rubs of on y’all!

Next on the to-do list, figuring out the dating landscape, and maybe having some babies- oh an a family too, I don’t need to add babymommas to everything else. Ha!",2,1759576954.0,Cirrhosis,0,1.0,False

1nxrbzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1nxrbzz/mil_from_hell_my_fiancés_grandma_thinks_my/,MIL From Hell: My fiancé’s grandma thinks my autistic half-brother is my secret love child,"This would actually fit a couple of tags, but Im going with MIL From Hell for now. 

This story is about my fiancé's grandmother, Moira. Who is the spiritual MIL compared to my actual MIL to be. 

For some context: I am 33 and my fiancé is 34. We are getting married in September 2026 and we don't live in the US. We live in Europe. Another big thing about this is, I am bisexual, and my fiancé is gay. So this is a ✨️🌸lavender marriage~🌸✨️ 

My Fiance, (lets call him Alex) and I have known each other since highschool, and have been very great friends throughout our adulthood. I had gone to live in England for some time after graduating, and only recently came back to my home country, after a long and heartbreaking break up. 

Alex lived in a city about 2hrs away, so we mainly kept a texting friendship with him occasionally coming to my city because of work or ""dates"" and then we would spend time together.

To the outside world, this would look like a date between a man head over heels for his gf. For example, he took me to see a ballet of The Swan Lake at the National Grand theatre (names have been changed for reasons, also he knows its my favourite ballet), and then took me out to dinner afterwards.

We were all dressed up, he got me a necklace and matching earrings to wear, and a bouquet of flowers 💐 when we met up for the ballet.

During said dinner, we discussed what we both wanted of our futures, what we were hoping to achieve. We then realized a lot of our goals were somewhat aligned, or very nearly the same. As our country isnt all that kind to the LGBTQ, I had joked, ""maybe we should get married, at least we would get better healthcare and tax benefits.""

But he agreed, and thus our scheme was born. 

Fun fact: he has not ever come out to his friends or family so they don't know he's gay.

Additional fun fact #1: My father and I have not spoken in 10 years. Within those 10 years, he got remarried, had a son who was later diagnosed as non verbal autistic, and a year after the child was born, his 2nd wife died. 

(No one really mourned her passing, not even dad).

Mikey is currently 4 years old, my father is 64. 

Additional fun fact #2: I have been engaged before, to a wonderful man, we spent 5 years together and were gonna get married in my home country and then have a big shindig in England for those that couldnt afford the destination wedding. But due to some... really unfortunate and unforseen circumstances, I ended the engagement, packed up my things, and left England. 

End of context. I promise, this is all relevant. 

Now onto the story.  

Moira is Alex's grandmother and she's the self proclaimed matriarch of his family. She used to be a grand somebody back in her heyday, and then had a very terrible fall from grace, as most did back then. Nevertheless, she still acts very stuff, high and mighty, and snobbish. Her fall from grace has left her with an almost paralyizing fear of being tricked, scammed, and/or taken advantage of in some way, shape, or form. 

She also dotes on Alex. Which *would* be cute, if she wasnt such a raging sociopath. She also completely ignores that she has another grandchild, Alex's sister. Because Alex is the apple of her eye. He is her greatest achievement and her most favourite person. She would burn the world for him, be damned whoever stood in her way.

See where im going with this? 

Now, given that shes also an incredible homophobe, *obviously* she doesn't know what her precious grandson is into. So when we went full steam ahead with our plan, and he introduced me to his family as his girlfriend, later fiance, she seemed over the moon. 

Because yay, she gets to see her favourite most precious treasure in the world continue the family line, and bear a child for her to love and cherish and adore.

🙄🙄

Fun fact: She is so desperate for Alex to father a child that she will actively tell *me*, ""Dont even think about using any pills or contraceptives! Just let the Lord guide you, and if it is His Will, then it will happen."" Despite both him and I telling her that we do not want to have a child *BEFORE* the wedding. That's a financial nightmare.

And yes, she is very religious. 

Naturally, the rest of his (so far seemingly sane) family was also overjoyed by him finally choosing to settle down. 

Now, me not knowing Moira that well in the beginning, and also desperately hoping I'll finally have a family that would love me unconditionally (foolish of me, I know), when Moira asked things about me, I did not sense anything sinister in those questions. Why, it felt only logical that she would want to get to know the future mother of his children (I stressed ONE child, don't get tied up in the how). So when she inquired about my family, and my life, I told her. 

I didnt go into explicit details about anything. But I mentioned that my parents are divroced, my father has a son with special needs from his late 2nd wife, and that I was previously engaged, but due to some differences, we ended our engagement and I moved back home, and ""rekindled our friendship, which led to an amazing relationship""

Personally, I think I deserved an OSCAR for that performance. I held his hand, and a lone tear of joy wistfully trailed down my cheeck from my big disney princess doe eyes, and gave him a lovely smile and called him Sweetheart. I swear you could hear soulful sad violin music in the background.

All while trying not to vomit, laugh, or cringe at the same time. 

Moira didnt make any comments about the G-rated history I had just shared with her. In fact, she kept gushing and glowing and bragging to anyone who would listen, about her ✨️beautiful daughter in law✨️ (we dont have a distinction for the in law titles like English speakers do), and how much she loved and adored me. 

Me being the naive lil emotional orphan that I was, I thought ""finally, they'll love me for me!"" And I daydreamed about wonderful christmas dinners and Easters and birthday parties being surrounded by my husband's family that adored and supported me, and us, in my future.

A few months later though, I noted she became rather chilly towards me. It was a minute shift, barely noticeable, but ask anyone growing up in an abusive and volatile household, *we can tell*.

I asked Alex about it but he reassured me it was nothing, Moira loved me and was overjoyed he had me in his life. She still bragged about me, she still behaved like I was made out of delicate gold. 

In public. 

One day, Alex had to go to a play rehersal (he is part of the local theatre troupe), so he said he would only be gone for 2 hours, and left me and Moira alone. 

We had never really been alone since we met. This was the first time. I was crocheting, and she was scrolling through facebook. Every so often she'd make commenrs about something she's watching, or tell me some long winded story about someone I had no connection to. 

I nodded, and made comments of my own in a polite and respectful tone, while focusing on my craft in front of me. She made odd remarks about my hobby, saying it was strange to see a young person so devoted to something from ""the old days"". I hear that a lot so I just shrugged it off, and told her, for the 5th time, how i got into it (YT tutorials).

Then, something very odd happened. She started to tell me stories of a cousin of hers who was getting married to a wealthy man who adored her, but on the day of the wedding it was revealed she had a secret love child with her ex boyfriend and had left it with her grandfather to be raised like his daughter. 

She tells me a few other stories, similar in theme. I thought it was weird she was bringing it up, but then she started to ask for more detail about Mikey. When was he born, and where? Was I present? When did I end the engagement with my ex? Was it before Mikey was born? Does my ex know about Mikey? How does my father take care of him and his special needs? Do I intend to help him?

Now, I may have been naive in the beginning by telling her any of that G-rated history, but I can still smell a rat when I need to. And I smelled a whole ass horde. 

I answered her questions as vaguely as possible, and then as a half joke, asked ""You're not surely implying what I think you are, are you?""

And there it was. The shoe dropped and the snake reveals herself. 

""I KNOW YOU'RE HIDING SOMETHING,"" Moira shrieks like the hideous banshee she is. ""YOU'RE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF MY SWEET BOY!""

This turned into a full-blown fight so I wont give a play by play. But i will do an overview.

Basically, ever since I told her that Mikey exists and that my father sired him in his 60s, and that I *had* a fiance before I coupled up with Alex, this sent off alarm bells and red flags up in her mind. 

So she went digging. Like any 70yr old sleuth with delusions of grandeur, she used Facebook as her primary tool, and found relations connected to me and my father. Through said relations she found the mother of my male cousin's ex girlfriend, who also happened to be a mutual friend of hers too.

And so she met that woman for coffee. And that woman told her lies upon lies. That Stephan (my father, fake name) was stuck in England taking care of *his daughter's child*. 

Mind you, I have an older sister who is 40, with 3 children of her own, 2 boys and 1 girl. They were visiting him for a month in England when all of this was happening.

But does Moira force the 2 shared braincells she has to rub together to make this logical conclusion? Nope, she went down the Path of Escandalo Drama, and assumed this woman meant me. 

ME.

I DO NOT HAVE CHILDREN. Nor would I abandon them in a completely different contient with a father I dont even speak to!

The fight between Moira and I escalated to such a degree that I threatened her with never laying eyes on the child I birth, keeping her away from every single milestone, and *ensuring Alex will never be around her again*.

Most of them are bluffs, of course, I wouldnt do the latter without discussing it with Alex, he's her legal caregiver after all. He lives with her, and has lived with her for nearly 2 of the 3 decades of his life. So she is essentially attached herself to him in the most unhealthiest of ways. 

But that b**ch folded like a harmonica after that. 

Simce then, I have told Alex I refuse to be in the same room as her, let alone breathe the same air. She has insulted me immensely, and btw hasnt stopped since then either. Shes still insisting im hiding something.

Sometimes she'll call me in the middle of the night to check if Alex is in bed with me, among other things. She's gone so far as try to track my period, give me fertility enhancing teas and every so often will tell me that she would ""gift us with her babysitting services"" when we become new parents. 

All this over the phone. I haven't been able to truly pull the trigger on going No Contact with her because despite *my* issue with her, she is still the woman that sacrificed a lot of her life so Alex could have a home, and an education, good food on the table, a car, a license, etc. And naturally she means a lot to him.

Hes not blind to see that she's been godawful to me and more than once they've had massive arguments about his upcoming marriage to me. She hates me through and through, often claiming that he is too naive or blind to see the kind of snake that I am, that I am clearly taking advantage of him.

I just hope that when we finally move into our new house (currently being renovated, hence why we dont live together right now), that some of this insanity will slow down a bit. 

My entire family is put off by her. My own grandmother is dusting off jewelry I havent even seen before because she cannot stomach the thought of ""some uppity village hag"" upstaging her and treating me that badly.

She doesnt actually care that much about me, but I know she's more looking forward to the 🚨Ultimate Grandma Showdown🚨 to see who is more refined and ladylike between the two of them.

Which I find the thought of it entertaining. 

A few notes: Alex is generally a pretty great guy, and we have been very very clear on communication from the start. He did warn me a little about Moira when we went to meet her, but I was manipulated by the love bombing and show of emotion from her toward me, so I thought for the briefest of moments, that he was overexaggerating. 

He was not.

Moira, on the other hand, has decided to sweep the entire incident under the rug, and focus solely on this dasterdly secret, this trove of closet skeletons I must have, because naturally the issue is me, no one else. 

And yes, she would do this to any other person who would get involved with Alex. This is ""her way of protecting him"". 🙄🙄

I'm 29M. Great job, great career, doing financially well. Idk how, but I ended up on a coffee date with a woman i know - she's 38F. We both had a great time. She said she wants to continue this, but we're ~1000 kms apart for 8-9 months every year. So we kinda know it ain't gonna work and we discussed how it makes no sense.

Now, I've been thinking and I really want to go on a dates with a few ladies with similar age gaps. I'm actively speaking to another woman of the same age. No, it's not a fetish and it doesn't have to end in sex. I'm just surprised - they don't play any games, they know exactly what they want in life, and aren't looking to just lock a guy down for societal pressure.

Is the age gap too weird? Will women in the 35-38 age group want to take a slow dating phase with a younger guy? Indian women who already dated younger guys, do you have any comments or suggestions?

1nxr40b,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_JackOnFinanceYouTube/comments/1nxr40b/what_are_the_fastest_and_easiest_ways_to_save/,What are the fastest and easiest ways to save money without drastically changing your lifestyle?,"Saving money doesn't require budget burnout; it requires identifying and stopping the **unnecessary money drain** you already have.

I struggled with complex budgeting for years until I realized the easiest path to **financial freedom** is focusing on just 5 areas of passive spending. This blueprint instantly helps you **save money fast** and easily.

# My Top 5 Easy Steps to Save Money Right Now:

1. **Cancel Forgotten Subscriptions:** This is the lowest-hanging fruit. Go through your bank statements right now and identify recurring payments for services you haven't used in 30 days. Cancel them. This is the **fastest way to save money** you never even knew you had.
2. **Limit the Daily Coffee Run:** That $5 daily coffee costs over $1,800 a year. Challenge yourself to limit cafe trips to once or twice a week. It's a key **budgeting tip** that makes a massive impact.
3. **Implement a ""No-Spend Weekend"":** Instead of cutting out dining out completely (which leads to failure), commit to one weekend a month where you cook everything at home. Simple, effective, and sustainable.
4. **Master Bill Negotiation:** Pay the ""loyalty tax"" no more. Spend 30 minutes calling your service providers (Internet, insurance, cable). Politely ask for current promotions. I personally save over $40 a month just by asking.
5. **Cure Impulse Buying with the 30-Day Rule:** The emotional urge to buy something non-essential is often gone within a week. If you want something over $50, add it to a list and wait 30 days. You will skip 90% of those unnecessary purchases.

If you want to see exactly **how to save money** using this blueprint with specific examples and tools I use, I created a full, detailed video guide **➡️ Watch my full 5-Step Money Saving Blueprint here:** [**https://youtu.be/M5s6BRJNud4**](https://youtu.be/M5s6BRJNud4)",1,1759576050.0,u_JackOnFinanceYouTube,0,1.0,False

Two of my ex-friends found the post and procceeded to share personal information with anyone who commented on it as well as private DMs designed to make me look as bad as possible. They have exhibited stalkery behavior and I'm not going to allow them to pressure me like this. I am not using real names for this, so people will be referred to by letter (example: ""A, J, B, etc"")**

I had a friend group that established itself online in mid-2020 when the pandemic lockdowns were in full-swing. A mutual friend of a friend had set up a Discord server since a lot of us had lost jobs or switched to remote-work, and were in dire need of socializing. I brought some of my own friends (J, D, C, and L) into this group. J and D are my oldest friends, and we knew eachother since childhood. C is a work friend I knew for 6 years at that point, L is someone I met online earlier that year.

The mutual friend, S, was a furry and on the autism spectrum. He was also prone to meltdowns. He and I had an argument, which leads him to tell everyone he's deleting his server. My friend J, who he met through me, brings us into a new server created by him so we can have a place to hang out online still. A, who is S's best friend, only knew J through me at the time, and assumed that I was the one who made this server. S was not invited into it, and has resented me for ""rallying his friends away from him"" ever since. S is also a huge asshole, a narcissist, and obsessed with buying things for the sake of showing off. I was never his friend, and only tolerated his presence because he was the one who insisted on running events, hosting things, etc. A blames me for S's meltdown, but not to the extent that he stops being my friend because S was prone to causing drama with people. He even admitted to me years later that he only stood by S because no one else was. A is a very kind person, but he's loyal mainly to the people he's known the longest. At the time, he knew me for 3-4 years, compared to 10+ with everyone else.

Now, the friend group is comprised of, at this point, quite a few people. J, D, A, B, E, L, C, and a few others, and myself. B and L start dating, and things are going pretty smoothly from 2021 until around 2023. Now, I had a separate friend online named H at the time. She was crushing on me since 2021, but I was never aware of this. H is homeschooled and very sheltered, and she is not a direct person at all. I'm the kind of person that needs to be TOLD things. Around this time, A is expressing relationship woes to me. So is H. Neither of them have had any luck meeting people. So I invite H into the server to try and set her up with A. It goes pretty smoothly for three months. H visits from out of state, and we hang out. A is not with us because he is working most of the time those two weeks.

Now, B is another one of A's good friends. B has always disliked me because my best friend, D, is wealthy and has given me approximately $70,000 over the course of 12 years because my employment was inconsistent. B also had a habit of snapping at me over the most minor things. He takes games way too seriously, and has screamed/cursed at me for things like talking about minor Elden Ring lore (He thinks that's a spoiler, and he LOATHES being spoiled even in the most minute capacity). Likewise, B and A are basically thick as thieves; they will organize hangouts and exclude me often. A usually never excludes me, but if it's B's hangout, he makes a point to not invite me. Now, A has a hangout with H and B. H asks if it's okay to invite me, to which A goes ""I don't think B will be comfortable with that."" They tell H not to tell me, but she visits my house and does so. Which I appreciate. She feels bad for me and reveals all the shit talking A has done about me. I have a breakdown because I trusted A. One things leads to another, and we have sex. She reveals she liked me but assumed I wasn't interested.

Now here's where shit gets really complicated: H goes to A, and tells him I made her ""uncomfortable"" (not revealing we essentially committed adultery) and they cut me off for five months. Everyone else is still talking to me, and A/H basically stop hanging out with the group. After a new year's party, A reaches out to me and tells me that he wants to break up with H because she essentially wanted to isolate him from our friend group. He is unaware of the fact that I slept with H, of which I tried to tell him earlier but he would keep ignoring my texts or calls. It also turns out H was talking to another guy online during this time, and they are currently married.

Two years later and it's 2025. I reveal to A in August that I slept with H and that I deeply regret it. He does not take it well. He then tells me ""I will make your life a living hell beyond just not being your friend."" He then kicks me out of his personal Discord server, brings all our friends there and makes a channel dedicated to sharing all my private conversations. Little by little, everyone is sharing things about me. For a month, they maintain a facade of cordiality and we still play games, hang out, etc. This comes to a head when J visits us from out of state, and reveals to me that the group has been actively alienating me and shit talking me the entire time. One by one, I tell them off, and leave that group. I make one last attempt to reason with A by driving to his house. He doesn't answer the door, so I assume he's not home, and I leave. It turns out he was there the entire time, and after waiting for me to leave, he calls the cops. The cops do nothing because all I did was drive to his house and knock on the door. I then make a post here on r/lostafriend, after which B and L immediately find my post and start trying to harass anyone commenting on it. Their posts get deleted, L gets banned, and B then makes several long twitter posts about how I'm a liar and how one friend blocked him because I told them what he had did (the stalking my post). L also tells people unrelated to our friend group that I've only met ONCE or TWICE, and has them block me.

C, my other closest friend from a job we used to work at, is pissed at me for having sex with H and betraying A's trust, of which I fully understand. That being said, she had bought us tickets to see the Demon Slayer movie and took off work for a week in September so I could arrange plans to visit her place out of state. This is while she was actively posting in that private server A set up. She even posted things like ""I think FrustratedPacing might be schizo"" to anything A wrote. When I found out about this, I texted her, told her I didn't want to visit anymore or be friends because I didn't want to give anyone in that group more chances to post my private messages, then promptly blocked her. She makes an attempt to message a DND buddy of mine she barely knows, telling him that I'm a liar, but this buddy ignores her due to not knowing her well.

So yeah, in the month and a half since this went down, I basically learned two things: 1). Not all of your friends need to be in the same group.  2) Your friend group is not your family that shares an unbreakable bond. Relationship drama can and will tear it down.

If B and L happen to be reading this or stalking my profiles again, I have one thing to say to you: You both are childish shitheads. B also got fired for throwing a coffee cup at his manager in a hissy fit, and was unemployed and about to be kicked out of his apartment. He is unstable and has major anger issues. B, get help. Get some fucking help. You and L need to leave me the fuck alone. I never liked you, and was only nice to you because I didn't want to rock the boat.

This is part of the publishers blurb:-

The first two chapters give an inviting introduction to the Jehol Biota in terms of its history of study, its main components, its scientific importance, its geographical, geological and biostratigraphic framework, and its renowned fossil discoveries. Each of the remaining chapters deals with a particular organismal group of the Biota written by leading experts. The book is lavishly illustrated with nearly 280 illustrations, which include 200 photographs that show the diversity of the taxa and beauty of their preservation. The colored life restorations, elegantly done by some of China's most celebrated scientific illustrators, give a kiss of life to the dead bones. Although targeted primarily at an educated public, the book is also an invaluable source of information for students and professionals in paleontology, geology, evolutionary biology and science education in general.

* Authoritative introduction to an exciting, classic Mesozoic site home to many of the world's most important and best preserved fossils
* Clear informative text accessible to the professional and lay reader alike
* Over 200 high quality photographs of a wide range of extraordinary fossils
* Beautiful colour paintings depicting reconstructed animals and plants in lifelike landscapes
* Lavish, large format, high quality production",1,1759575779.0,Dinosaurs,0,1.0,False

it's all over now and all i feel is loss. all i have is loss, but all i have truly lost is you. everything else is replaceable, nothing else is beyond fixing. just... us. whatever us were and could have been. 

some days are okay - i get up, i make coffee, i sit at my laptop and try to work, be productive, anything. anything to get the crushing weight of you out of my mind. smoke myself into a stupor to push the emotions away, for now.

i've had to be so strong throughout all of this and now i'm cracking. i feel the weight shifting my foundations. you've made me into something different, now.

as soon as i realized that i no longer wanted to love you, the mood shifted. the grief isn't just in your absence, it's in the way i carry you, even now. in the way i look at the calendar and count the months, wondering if you ever think of me too. do i race across your mind as a memory or regret?

do you miss me? do you also wish that things could have happened differently? 

there's a cruelty in knowing that i would have stuck with you in a heartbeat, had you ever asked. my heart belonged to you, and i can still feel you cruelly hanging on. i would have walked to the ends of the earth for you, and you want to see if i still will.

it would bring me no greater satisfaction than to laugh in your face at a love confession. nothing could make me happier than telling you exactly what i think of you, and how you've treated me. i want you to know true heartbreak as i walk away, knowing that i will never, ever, return to you. i want you to beg, scream, cry, plead, only for me to push you away. i want you to feel the sum of your actions fully, measured in pounds of flesh. 

but those are silly fantasies. you don't care. you never did, or only as far as having the attention of a pretty woman helped to boost your ego. you never cared about me, just how it would look to be with me. i can see you now, in the bar, grinding up against some poor victim that has no idea of how truly cruel and manipulative you are. 

that's what i tell myself. that's what i remind myself. the ice in your veins could never have been melted by my fire, you are too comforted by the cold. i offered you my heart, my soul, everything that makes me, me, and you pushed it away because reality stung. 

the comfort i find is in knowing i will rise above this, rise above you, rise to this and overcome, again. i don't have a choice, but knowing you tried to orchestrate my downfall is enough to fuel my retribution.

you will live, exist, and die knowing that i wanted to offer you everything, forever, for the rest of our lives. you will never hear that offer again, you will never see me smile for you again. 

and i do not need to pray on your downfall, because you will bring it upon yourself.",4,1759575665.0,letters,2,1.0,False

Example: Starbucks. They don’t just sell coffee, they sell the idea of a “third place” between work and home. The cup of coffee is almost secondary — the vibe, the smell, the way baristas interact with you… that’s the real marketing.

Or Tesla: they barely spend on traditional advertising, yet every Elon tweet or fan meetup is free marketing on steroids.

The best brands don’t “sell” directly — they act in a way that makes people want to talk about them.

I wanted to share my experience with cleaning mug warmers since I've been using them daily for the past couple of years. Trust me, keeping these little devices clean is crucial for both longevity and hygiene.

I recently got a new mug warmer from https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer and it's been a game-changer for my home office setup. But I noticed many people struggle with proper cleaning techniques, so here's what I've learned.

First things first, always unplug your mug warmer and let it cool completely. This is non-negotiable - safety first! Once it's cool, I use a slightly damp microfiber cloth to wipe down the heating plate. The key word here is ""slightly"" - you don't want water dripping everywhere.

For stubborn coffee stains or dried creamer (we've all been there), I mix a tiny bit of dish soap with warm water. Dip a cotton swab in this solution and gently clean around the edges and any grooves. Never use abrasive cleaners or scrub aggressively - this can scratch the heating surface.

One trick I discovered is using white vinegar for mineral deposits. Just dampen a cloth with diluted vinegar, wipe gently, and follow up with a clean, damp cloth. Works like magic!

Important note: Never submerge your mug warmer in water or run it under the tap. These devices have electrical components that can get damaged.

After cleaning, I always let my warmer air dry completely before plugging it back in. If you're in the market for a reliable mug warmer that's easy to clean, check out the one I use from https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer - it has a smooth surface that makes maintenance super simple.

For daily maintenance, I've made it a habit to wipe my warmer every evening with a dry cloth. This prevents buildup and makes deep cleaning sessions much easier. I also check the cord regularly for any wear and tear.

Regular cleaning not only keeps your drinks tasting better but also extends the life of your warmer. Mine's been going strong for two years now, and it still works like new.

Remember, a clean mug warmer is a happy mug warmer! Let me know if you have any questions - I'm always happy to help fellow coffee enthusiasts!",1,1759575475.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

Start by considering the setting and your relationship with the person; casual or group environments, like work or social gatherings, often foster friendly behavior, while one-on-one or romantic settings, like a bar or party, may signal flirting. Flirting typically involves consistent, targeted attention, such as prolonged eye contact, personal compliments (e.g., “You have an amazing smile”), or playful teasing, while friendliness feels more general, with neutral topics and equal warmth toward others. Body language is a key indicator: flirting often includes leaning in, light touching (e.g., a hand on your arm), or mirroring your movements, whereas friendly interactions maintain casual distance and minimal touch. Listen to their words—flirty comments are suggestive or hint at future plans (e.g., “We should grab coffee”), while friendly ones stay generic (e.g., “You guys are fun”). Test reciprocity by mirroring their behavior; if they escalate with smiles or compliments, it’s likely flirting, but a polite, non-engaging response suggests friendliness. Flirting often involves extra effort, like texting first or remembering details about you, unlike situational friendly chats. Trust your instincts if you feel a spark, but verify with their actions to avoid misreading charisma or cultural differences, as some cultures view prolonged eye contact as polite, not romantic. Look for patterns over time—flirting builds with increasing warmth, while friendliness stays steady. If unsure, create low-pressure opportunities to clarify, like suggesting a hangout or gently asking, “Am I picking up vibes, or are you just super friendly?” To avoid missteps, don’t overanalyze natural charisma, respect boundaries, and communicate clearly. By observing consistent signs like targeted attention, playful energy, and romantic hints, you can distinguish flirting from friendliness and respond confidently.",21,1759575210.0,dating_advice,4,0.93,False

Takes alot out of you.

Ive been fighting candida for a while now rotating the usual antifungals, wormwood, black wallnut, pau darco,NAC,olive oil.
Super strict keto diet not even berries yall.

Turns out after 2 years i discovered i had liver fluke parasite infection. Seen them while doing numerous coffee enemas and kinesiology confirmation too. 

So the candida is slowly dying but at the stage i need to rotate herbs again.

Ive just read up on Thyme been super effective 
Has anyone used thyme whether be oil or dry to effectively kill off the beast?
And if so how much etc

Also when the candida is dying off i crave sugar so intensely i know its manipulating my taste and cravings, so i end up eating alot of coconut cream mixed with cinamon and organic stevia drops (just a couple drops).
It satisfies me but bloats me so much and is a fukt up cycle *excuse my profanities

Im wondering if the coconut cream feeds it now??

Also why whenever i eat, i feel i want more carbs when im only eating mince meat and chicken (grass fed organic), eggs and Brocoli and non starchy veg like Cauliflower, eggplant, zuccini, cucumber.

Can someone please shed some light not just for me but all that are here trying to heal.

Im supporting my liver, working through grief and doing the inner work also which is important. 

I get so frustrated been so restricted and detoxing all the time it feels. 

Some say slow and steady to slay this but you know sometimes u have those days where u double up on your herbs but feel crappy and soo tired the next day..

I also take the usual binders.

Any advice would be god sent.

1nxqpho,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Smol-cat-/comments/1nxqpho/starting_calorie_counting_once_again/,Starting calorie counting once again.,"I am now 30 years old, a female and 5 foot 7.

I have been over weight my whole life. At one point I was about 18-20 and weighed about 20 stone or there abouts (I never weighed myself at peak weight). I decided to ""watch"" what I was eating, stop snacking, cook meals, take salad to the chip shop i worked at instead of eating the deep fried food i previously was on my break. I swapped the cans of fizzy juice i drank so many of throughout my shift for dilyting juice and stopped putting the two teaspoons of sugar into my 4 or so coffees i drank a day! This alone, made weight drop off me so quickly, i didn't even try much but just stopping the horrific habits i had, it was so easy. I felt amazing and so much healthier. 

At about 25-26, i started calorie counting as obviously it gets harder the lighter you get and this worked amazingly. I was my lightest I've ever been, 13 stone 10. I seem to carry weight well for some reason, this shows still over weight on the bmi but i honestly looked slim and my clothes fit great and most importantly i felt great. 

Between then and now, I have went through phases of calorie counting and losing weight and then stopping, gaining weight and repeat.
I've done this for about 4 years. 

Now at 30, my partner has moved in with me and it's just dawned on me how much weight I've put on. We like takeaways together, I eat the same size portions as him. He's a 6 foot 2 man,  6 years younger than me and clearly needs more food than me, so I'm glad the realisation has hit, I shouldn't be eating the same. I also now eat biscuits and chocolate which i never had an issue with before as I just didn't keep them in the house. 

When I calorie count, I don't restrict anything. 

I am starting my calorie counting again from Monday, when I go back to work from my holiday. I guess I don't really have a question but more wanted to type this out. I think it should be easy for me as I've previously lost about 7-8 stone, I have the knowledge, I just need the commitment! I haven't weighed myself in a couple of years but think I must be about 17 stone. I want to get down to the 13 i was at my lightest. I think I can do it, and this time, for good. 

It should also be easy as naturally over the years, I've never eaten at work as a hotel manager, as I'm not hungry and too busy, and this works nicely as really I'm only drinking zero calories coffee and water/zero calorie diluting juice. I eat at home so less of a window to count. 

Thank you for reading. Any motivation, tips, advice on re starting as that's always been the hard part. 🙏🏻 ",1,1759574679.0,u_Smol-cat-,0,1.0,False
1nxqng3,https://i.redd.it/4so25lnvp2tf1.png,I Built a privacy focused journaling and trip planning app Vuzo (Android & iOS),"Hey everyone,

I’ve been building **Vuzo**, a **journaling and trip planning app**, as a side project over the few months and it’s finally live.

**Why I made it**  
Most travel apps I tried either push ads, force you to create an account, or lock offline access behind a paywall. I wanted something simple and personal, where you can plan and journal your trip without worrying about who owns your data.

**What you can do with Vuzo**

* Plan trips with cities, places, and transport, and see **distances** between activities
* Journal your journey with polaroid style photos and cassette style voice notes
* Add bookings like hotels, flights, and trains so they appear in the right day
* Track expenses and budgets for each activity
* Use live trip mode to get lock screen notifications(iOS only), quickly rate places, or edit expenses while on the go
* Share and backup your trips. You can export your itinerary as: • `.vuzo` file that can be imported back into the app on both iOS and Android • `HTML` to open or share in any browser • `CSV` if you like using spreadsheets

**Privacy first**  
All your data is stored locally on your device. No accounts, no ads, no forced cloud. You own your trip data and can export it whenever you like.

**Tech stack**  
Built with **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)** for shared logic, **Jetpack Compose** on Android, **SwiftUI** on iOS, **Room Multiplatform** for offline storage, and **FileKit** for import and export.

You can check it out here:

1nxqicp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/1nxqicp/i_feel_like_theres_no_space_for_me_anywhere/,I feel like there's no space for me anywhere,"When I started college, I tried so fucking hard to make friends. I went to queer events. I joined a sapphic book club and tried to be consistent about both of those things for at least a few months, but I felt like an outsider the entire time. I was usually the only ace person there, and it felt a little like there was an invisible wall between me and everyone else. I couldn't relate to them properly, and they couldn't relate to me because the whole ""zero sexual attraction"" thing is kind of hard to wrap your head around, I guess. 

Whatever, maybe trying to bond over queerness alone wasn't enough? I transferred out of community college and started joining interest-based groups (crochet club and yet another book club) at my new college. There were a lot of other new transfers looking to make friends, and I even managed to get some people's socials and plan some coffee hangouts. Most people ghosted me when I tried to make plans, but a few didn't! 

A girl who dressed exclusively in shades of green and always had on at least two necklaces at once was the first to accept. I was kind of nervous to talk to her one-on-one because she was just so cool? Luckily, we bonded over complaining about work since we've both worked at restaurants for a bit. We hung out a couple more times after that, and she showed me a pretty cool thrift store, but she got a girlfriend and dropped off the face of the Earth. Literally haven't heard from her in months. I texted her to test the waters once, but she never responded, so I guess she's just off living her life. 

The next contestant was a guy who tried to get me to buy Crypto. Hard pass. The guy after that was in my program, so I thought it would be a better match, but nope. We hung out exactly once, and he decided it would be cool and normal of him to ask if I wanted to be friends with benefits and also talk about how hot the other girls in our program are. Oh, and he somehow found my sister's socials and started trying to talk to her. It was creepy all around, but he was so innocuous over text that I couldn't even try to file some kind of harassment charge with my college's Title IX office. I just have to avoid him when I go to class. 

At that point, I gave up on men. I'd rather just make friends with women anyway, but that's obviously a lot easier said than done. The only other girl who hung out with me more than once ended up just wanting to talk about guys (and girls). She would always be eyeing people on the street and talking about dates she's been on. It was kind of fun, but I also felt super lame the entire time because I am aroace. I feel none of that shit. Of course she didn't seem totally convinced that I'm aroace. According to her, I'm secretly a lesbian in denial. I ended up being the one who ghosted her because I was just so over it. 

Anywayyy, I feel like such a fucking loser. I'll be graduating next semester, and I haven't made a single friend. I have exactly two friends from high school, and they're both dating each and live 400 miles away, so I'm obviously not the priority. I gave up on going to clubs because I feel like I'm third-wheeling the entire room somehow. The only social thing I do outside of class/work at this point is help sort donations at a food pantry once a week. Absolutely none of the people there are my age, but at least I get to feel like less of a hermit for a couple hours at a time. 

I love being ace and all, but I can't help but feel like things would be so much easier if I could just date and partner up like a normal person. Literally all I want is someone who will hang out with me sometimes and text me back. We don't even have to do anything. We can just exist in the same room, but it looks like I'd have to be willing to fuck someone just to get that far. 

I am just so fucking tired of getting discarded over and over again. I know most people don't value friendship the way I do and that's fine, but it still hurts. I want to just opt out and self-isolate so bad that it's not even funny. Like, I'm coming up on another holiday season of mostly chilling by myself and getting little ""where's the boyfriend?"" nudges from my extended family, and I don't know how to handle it. I kind of just want to lie down for a month, idk.",4,1759573958.0,asexuality,1,0.84,False

I'm down to share photos, too. 

I've been drinking a lot of tea lately, too. I'm trying to see what is the best stuff to out in tea for taste and for health. Coffee, I recently tried grinding beans, and it really does make a huge difference. So, I've been trying different coffee beans to see what's best.

I'm into all kinds of different hobbies. I'm really into houseplants and aquarium keeping. I have over 100 different houseplants. I just got a small greenhouse now, too. I'm in the process of setting up a fish tank room. I have 4 tortoises that also live in the fish tank room until I build them an outside enclosure. I also have one cat and one dog too.

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Marvel Rivals, Valorant, Overwatch, Palworld and Ark ASA. Just bought Dinkum, too. I built a PC to play on a couple of years ago.

Nikarudi coffee shop nikikimbia. Yule mtu alikuwa hapo akitafuta chini ya meza, amechanganyikiwa sana. Nikamwendea nikishika laptop yake.
""POLE SANA!"" nikasema nikihema.
Akaona laptop yake, kisha akaona mimi na hoodie sawa, akaanza kucheka. Alikuwa karibia kuita polisi akidhani wezi wamemnyang'anya.

1nxqbzu,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1nxqbzu/female_29_years_old_my_story/,[Female 29 years old ] My story,"I am here to vent, but if you’re here to read what I write, I want you to know that I am always open to constructive feedback, advices. Feel free to share your experience. 

But I want to start with my childhood. I was a very hyperactive kid. I had trouble at school because I had dyspraxia; difficulty writing, so on. I remember that anxiety of wanting to leave to my safe space and jump for hours. My mother noticed something was happening to me, she took me to a neurologist and he suggested her to change me to a less traditional school and even mentioned that I had very high skills but also very low ones. 

As a teen, I started to withdraw completely from other classmates. I was always angry, I consumes up to 17 cups of coffee to be able to cope with class and be able to just sit down (which didn’t work or course, but at that time, I felt I needed to feel different to be able to cope with sitting down from 9am to 2pm). I isolated myself. I read one book per week, a poem every day. I invented an imaginary friend. I developed depression.

At 18, I developed an eating disorder and ate compulsively to be able to cope with the days and with sitting down. 

Around 19-22, I had very low self esteem and felt that I was not capable of doing anything right. I didn’t know I could have adhd, but I did know something was wrong with me, because I loved saying that I had to go to the bathroom just to run to the other extreme of the campus. I copied once in a project, and I was hated by the teacher forever. 
On one hand, I started going to therapy with a psychological, and on the other hand, I got medication for depression and anxiety from a psychiatrist. He said he didn’t think I had adhd. My therapist said she was 98% sure I had it, but I got mad because I didn’t know how to deal with that information. In the end, I wasn’t proud of myself when I graduated. I felt like a failure. 

Then I started working after graduation, and they kept telling me I was good, they were about to promote me but I missed the meeting, and for that reason I wasn’t promoted. That hurt, but I kept working with them for three years while in the process, I kept smoking marihuana everyday just to be able to do the job. 

I kept seeing my therapist, but I moved abroad to a different country (I have to recognize that I didn’t put ADHD in priority and I wasn’t diagnosed, so I was confused). 
I moved abroad for a master degree. It was a nightmare. Sitting down, constant team meetings. I was so scattered. No one liked working with me because of this. My anxiety was too high, during the internship my boss got really impatient with me, I couldn’t do the job properly because it looked very messy. 

Then for the thesis, the advisor lost it and said I had cognitive problems, that I couldn’t even synthesize information properly, that I couldn’t even create a solid structure out of my work. She was incredibly harsh. That destroyed me. I have an appointment for adhd diagnosis on Monday. But I started seeing a new therapist as well, and he says he doesn’t think I like my degree, and that the education system was never really supportive. But on Monday, I will get a proper diagnosis finally. 

If this was my acknowledgment for the thesis (I won’t put it of course), it would be like this: 

“I am hurt, I am tired of feeling like I am deficient.
I wished it was easier. I wished the system wasn’t this blind. 
But in the end we are all fighters, no system fits everyone, because every human is different.”",1,1759573328.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False
