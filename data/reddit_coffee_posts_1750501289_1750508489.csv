Just bought a Philips Lattego 5400. I put in Starbucks espresso dark roast beans. I noticed that every second or third coffee, it cancels the coffee and tells me no beans were found. While the beans seem almost full. Is the machine broken?

I also thought, after looking on google, it could be the starbucks beans. They are extremely oily and smell like fish even.
 
Any tips? It's my first full automatic. I had a nespresso capsule machine before.

1lgv8yt,https://www.reddit.com/r/LightPhone/comments/1lgv8yt/light_phone_vs_goliath/,Light Phone vs. Goliath,"I am so pleased with my Light Phone III purchase and the outstanding improvements to the new device that I just have to share!  So many people just don't understand what this movement is really all about...

The commitment to go ""Light"" is so much more than simply using a ""dumbphone!""  It is making a solid decision and investment to change my life!  It is me saying to myself that I recognize that I have a digital addiction and that I am going to do something about my problem.  

Deciding to go ""Light"" means that I am willing to support a very small company that has initiated their commitment to create ""change"" in how our entire society functions!  It's much like a ""David and Goliath"" scenario!  Yet, this small company, this ""underdog,"" that I believe in is truly taking on an unbelievable massive battle that most people will simply never take the time to comprehend. 

""Light Phone"" is devoted to their mission.  They are dedicated to their beliefs. They have proven this by creating a small device that can have a profound effect on my life and in my society.  

The vision that ""Light Phone"" is offering goes well beyond the purchase of a dumbphone.  By investing in this company, I am investing in their vision and in their integrity!  So, it is important that others be very much aware that buying a Light Phone is so much more than just buying a phone.  **Purchasing a Light Phone is only half of the investment.**  The other half is investing in Light Phone's vision, which is something I can believe in!  

Investing in their vision through purchasing a Light Phone is lot like investing in Apple computer during their lowest and darkest financial periods.  I invested in Apple during that time because they were the ""underdog"" and now look at happened to them!  No matter if it's a digital device, a  computer or even a sports team, it is clear that I will always want to see the ""underdog"" come out on top!

If you're not happy with the Light Phone, then choose not to participate.  The answer is simple... don't buy one. 

As for me, I will continue to praise what this company has done and continues doing.  I will do so proudly, with my Light Phone in my pocket, as I sit on my patio in the cool breeze of the morning and contentedly sip on my cup of coffee while listening to the birds...",1,1750508389.0,LightPhone,0,1.0,False

Our formal complain to the Iowa Public Information Board (IPIB) was accepted and found to be partially valid. You can read that [complaint here.](https://eyesoffcr.org/images/IPIB_Complaint_CityOfCR_vs_EyesOffCR_final.pdf)

Nearly immediately after this complaint was accepted as valid, we received word that The City found the 2000 Flock emails that were missing. 

     Quote from city employee: ""...It took me approximately **1 hour to process the original 8 emails**, so unfortunately, this search is over broad and cumbersome....""   

ü§®

...So we've narrowed the scope a bit. I fear they are going to hide behind insane discovery fees, but we'll cross that bridge when we get there. 

**Other developments:**

One of the city council members ([Maier](https://www.davidmaierforcitycouncil.com/)) reached out and we grabbed coffee. I walked him through the Flock situation, how dangerous this system is to privacy, how bad the lack of transparency looks, and how frustrating the public records process has been. He was already familiar with some of the issues and admitted that all of those are valid concerns. 

When I asked what he knew about Flock, he said it was on the consent agenda, so they knew very little...just assumed it was about traffic enforcement. He also shared that items often get added to the agenda last-minute, giving them almost no time to review or ask questions. He's not up for reelection this year, so I tend to trust him more on that. Expressed some frustrations with that and hinted that Council is a bit ""clicky."" 

By the end of our chat, he seemed to understand a lot of the concerns, but also said, bluntly:

‚Äú...They aren‚Äôt going anywhere.‚Äù

This was in seemingly in reference to the strong support for Flock from the police union, city manager, and some council members. He encouraged me to speak at a future council meeting...something I do plan to do once I grow a pair of testicles. 

Most importantly, he told me the key to getting council attention: mass communication from random citizens. 

His example? The current drama around the animal control department. Public outrage over their shutdown for intakes due to ‚Äústaffing shortages‚Äù suddenly made it a top priority for council. That‚Äôs what moves the needle.

TLDR; 
Past codependent relationship, ruining my life currently, not sure what to do.

Description;
My chicana ex broke up with me 2021 24F, and I went crazy since then 22M. At first the first few months I thought it was normal to experience sadness, mental trouble, hate, and feel loss of control but this evenually spiraled into 4 years of constant paranoia. I've been living with my parents and little sister, whom of all I've been hurting through bad behavior and the like. I'll write a simple break down of before, during, and after.

Before: 
Looking at basically the last few years before I got into this relationship 2014-2016, I had ideas for getting married early and skipping the whole bfgf thing, never thought it was for me. I mainly was a quiet kid, didnt really bother too much about dating, although I had my fair share of people I liked and stuff. I really had no forethought of getting into a relationship, which is sad I guess, but yeah.

During:
I had graduated highschool 2016, went to local cc immediately after, thought it was a good idea to save money and complete studies. I had plans to be more involved being an econ major so I joined the cc student government. I joined, this is when I saw my ex for the first time. I keep thinking about that day because in retrospect I feel I (in the moment) got excited that I felt someone thought I was attractive. I kinda went all in. Some time later, at a local park, I had kissed her in public. I didn't think it was unsolicited, thought whatever there was was enough. I think she got mad later cause she ended up hugging me a day or two later, this one physically hurt, like she took something from me. She was 2 years older than me, and pretty experienced when it came to relationships; think she just felt mad. I ended up just not thinking too much of it. Basically the next 2 years I was in cc was fully horrible, I thought I was in love for the first time, so I discounted what I felt. Those two years were horrible, I always felt like 'the side chick'. This girl basically made an effort to hang out with others, flirt, and move forward with her own agenda. I thought it was some twisted sense of jealousy so I let it be. I tried doing what she liked, helping her study, giving her food, and hang out with her friends and such. Seemed like she was kind of wasting her life at cc, staying in one place for so long. I basically helped her graduate cc, told her to go to classes, and the like. What really bothers me is that in our private times at her house, to say the least, she made me watch crazy  stuff. I vividly remember watching twilight zone, donnie darko, Stanford prison experiment, and that movie teeth where the woman's privates have teeth. We joked about stuff she liked, like how exes never change. I never had an ex so I just went with it. It pains me to say what she did in private but here goes. I mainly asked explicitly and the next thing I know she just grabbed me. We were kissing and stuff so I was ok with it at the time.
Since then, felt like I had no control over my life. I thought she acted out of love but I don't even know. Those two years we never actually did anything. She still continued texting other people, being flirty with others, and giving me mixed signals. I broke up with her somewhere in my second year I think, although I really lost track of time. My intent was to break up before she did cause I was pretty fucking pissed. She had proceeded to just push her own social projections onto me. She was pretty reactive, and down in the dumps most of the time. I saw her run straight to her friends afterwards, basically excited to talk bad about me. As an undergrad, I basically tried to keep whatever dignity I had, and basically said sorry for breaking up and tried to get back together. We got back together, this time she seemed more serious I guess.

After: 
Ultimately after 2 yrs in university where we both transferred to, I basically tried everything to find common ground. Basically thought it was best to break up considering we both weren't really doing well anyways. The last thing she did was offered to buy me coffee from Starbucks, which I declined, considering she never really did anything for me anyways in the first place. Thought it was funny she offered to buy me something when break up was in the works. I gave her a hug for the last time and we basically parted ways. I basically spent 2021 - 2024 drinking coffee everyday out of spite. Like she called me all this stuff and painted a bad image of me, and I'm just second thinking who I am and like my own actions. I really didn't think I was who she said but at this point like idk. 

I've been thinking about how to change myself and grow from the relationship, tried basically everything I could to not repeat the same mistake again; change of habit, change of boundaries, change of products I use, change of speech patterns, and tried changing friends I used to hang out with. I only even chose to do all this because well 1) I was studying econ so I thought I made her act however she studied, and 2) I kissed her first so I felt some sort of responsibility and obligation.

After this long, I feel like this isn't normal for a breakup. I'm too scared to watch movies now, can't keep a job, can't even study properly tbh. I literally have been seeing ghost like images of my ex everywhere basically with others. Even worse, Im seeing some mind reading and teleportation crap. I'm seeing other signs telling me to go find that same girl. Also like everyone is reading my mind, I don't even understand any of this I even see like my mom acting the same way she did. This is what angers me. I know my mom wouldn't be manipulative the way she was, but I'm still acting in that manner. Basically the guilt for worrying my mom at this point is over the top. Basically whatever she did to me, I did to my parents. I think she didn't really give. How I'm acting is pretty dang manipulative, I actually feel some sense of guilt. I've been connecting the dots and putting pieces to the puzzle, ultimately I think I suffered because I was committed and she wasn't. During the relationship, I was mentally, and physically in pain like the whole time. I think people only go this crazy if they were cheated on. Aside from that, I really do feel like I'm living her life now, could just be that she completely scrambled my sense. I see myself living whatever life she lived. Having a streak record of fucking people over, loving the pity, and feeling bad about herself.

I went to therapy early on after the breakup, on this onset, but still same thing. Like nothing seems to work. I can't really get back to who I was nefore. I never really post on reddit, but I'm only doing this cause I completely sucked the life out of people around me, even they wouldnt give a flying fck about me posting about this stuff atm. Also it seems like good practice like not posting random stuff on social media and stuff is useless for me at this point.

At this point, I mean Im asking for advice. My question is like what to do. We never actually did anything other than whatever I said before. I still feel the same sense of obligation as I felt when I first kissed her and I definitely can't get her out of my mind. I have no idea where shes at, how she is, or anything. I never post private stuff like this online. Im also too scared and to get into anything new. Am I responsible for her actions, was I ever?

Even if dinner is already cleaned up, there are always late night snacks and kid messes scattered around. The surfaces need a quick scrub, the coffee pot needs prepped, dog water refreshed... these are simple tasks that I've never consistently accomplished as an adult. 

My partner and I used to joke about 'who closed last night' when we would wander into the kitchen to find a mess of bottles, used glasses, yesterday's forgotten leftovers, congealed wine stains, and crusty food everywhere. It steadily became less funny over the years. 

I stopped drinking this past April, and my partner followed suit a few weeks later. We're still going strong. This group has helped us both realize it is a day-by-day journey, which has been immeasurably helpful.

In the evening, in the farmers‚Äô market located in the west region of Zhong Hai city, there were numerous noisy pedestrians and vehicles indifferently passing through. Vegetable leaves and dirty water were strewn all over the ground. There was an enormous amount of different fading store signboards, and occasionally there would be some single-colored neon lights lit up. There were workers returning home, children that finished school, elderly buying groceries, and the many different travel-worn passersby, causing the gray dusty sky to seem more and more depressing.

Perhaps within a metropolitan city like this, such a region was the stain that people looked down upon the most, a region they wished never existed.

By a wall next to an intersection, was a man who was leisurely and contentedly doing what others viewed as shameful.

This was a young man covered in oil and grime, selling mutton skewers. He was sporting a white vest, coffee-colored pants, and a pair of stiff blue plastic slippers.

The young man‚Äôs hair was messy, but had a rather mature and handsome face, if one took a closer look, one would notice this was a man with backbone. It‚Äôs a pity that no matter how he looked, the ladies walking along the street wouldn‚Äôt even pay him a glance, because, he was just a mutton skewers seller.

The young man placed the mutton skewers he just cooked to the side. With the hot weather, grilling was easy but selling was hard. 50 cents for two skewers was considered cheap, but after a whole day, he only earned a little over 10 dollars, barely enough to have 2 meals.

However, the young man didn‚Äôt seem to be dejected by this, he instead had a relaxed and satisfied expression. He sat down on his stool, looking towards the crowded street, as if such a view was the prettiest scenery.

‚ÄúOld Li, it‚Äôs about time you paid for what you agreed upon 2 days ago!‚Äù A high-pitched male voice suddenly appeared from the side.

The 3 approaching males didn‚Äôt look above 20 and were dressed like gangsters, with upright hair, silver chains, holey jeans, scraggy faces, and a cigarette in their mouths.

OId Li was a peddler selling deep-fried snacks right beside the young man. Similarly, due to the hot weather he didn‚Äôt have much business and was on his seat with a worried expression.

‚ÄúThis‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.‚Äù Old Li showed a bitter face, ‚ÄúMy Young Master, please be patient. With this hot weather, how am I able to pay without any business‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúListen here Old Li, don‚Äôt take a yard after being given an inch. If it wasn‚Äôt for big bro Feng protecting you, this stall of yours would‚Äôve been wrecked long ago.‚Äù A henchman said in a threatening, yet flattering way.

The hooligan called big bro Feng seemed extremely pleased, he patted his henchman, and said, ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs protection fee, you can choose to pay or you can choose not to pay. I must get the money either way. Otherwise, I will wreck your stall now!‚Äù with that said, he picked up a skewer of sausage, took two big bites and threw the remainder on the ground.

Old Li was stuck without a way out and tightly gripped the small stack of notes in his pocket, considering whether or not to spend it like that. The money was meant for his wife to see a doctor, how could he bear to use it as a ‚Äúpresent‚Äù for these rascals!?

‚ÄúI‚Äôll pay for him.‚Äù The man from the mutton skewers stall suddenly walked over, and fished out a few notes from his pocket, not even amounting to 100 dollars. He handed it over and indifferently said: ‚ÄúThis is all I have, Old Li is getting on in years and urgently needs money, you guys should accumulate some good karma.‚Äù

The little hoodlum squinted his eyes and laughed, then took the notes and passed it to his henchman behind, ‚ÄúYang Chen, you want to pretend to be a good person, but you haven‚Äôt paid your own protection fee!‚Äù

Yang Chen creased his eyebrows, lamenting in his heart about why these fellas were not properly studying at their age. Why be a hoodlum, but as he wasn‚Äôt their father, it wasn‚Äôt his position to say anything. He also didn‚Äôt want to stir up trouble, so he dully said: ‚ÄúTomorrow, I will pay tomorrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood, I‚Äôm not an unsympathetic person, everybody should cooperate. I protect your businesses and you pay me money as a matter of fact‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I will come tomorrow to collect then.‚Äù After speaking, the little hoodlum and his two henchmen strutted towards other stalls, bringing them grief.

The eyes of Old Li had already reddened, he bitterly looked towards Yang Chen, ‚ÄúLittle Yang, why do you trouble yourself? You are always helping me pay those thugs, how can I let this go on‚Ä¶.‚Äù

‚ÄúOld Li, don‚Äôt say such a thing. When I just arrived and wasn‚Äôt used to life here, I probably wouldn‚Äôt even have a friend to talk to, if it wasn‚Äôt for you. You are my benefactor, and this is my way of repaying you.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou kid‚Ä¶.. What should I say to you‚Ä¶..‚Äù Old Li seemed to understand that he couldn‚Äôt convince Yang Chen and could only sigh.

Yang Chen didn‚Äôt mind and laughed, it was a dull yet sincere laugh. As if the extortion earlier didn‚Äôt affect his mood, ‚ÄúBy the way, how is your wife‚Äôs illness?‚Äù

Old Li‚Äôs eyes were filled with gratitude, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all thanks to you for giving me the money to have an operation for my wife. Right now she only needs to go for a few more check-ups, take some medicine and then she‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs great! I wish her an early recovery.‚Äù Yang Chen satisfyingly nodded.

Old Li gave a bitter laugh, ‚ÄúLittle Yang, the money you lent me will definitely be returned, if I‚Äôm unable to return everything before I die, my daughter will carry on the debt‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Alas, if it wasn‚Äôt for me, that 100,000 dollars of yours can definitely be used to open a nice shop. You wouldn‚Äôt need to come here and sell mutton skewers, and wouldn‚Äôt need to endure those hoodlum‚Äôs torment.‚Äù

Yang Chen curled his lips, ‚ÄúI somewhat enjoy such a way of life, selling mutton skewers isn‚Äôt bad, it is simple yet able provide enough for meals.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are too‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù Old Li was a little depressed as he said, ‚ÄúLittle Yang, you are only 23 or 24 years old, other youngsters of your age are either studying in university, or diligently trying to build a career. Right now you don‚Äôt even have a girlfriend, are you planning to sell mutton skewers forever? You aren‚Äôt worried, but I feel worried as I watch you.‚Äù

Seeing Old Li genuinely express worry for himself, Yang Chen unconsciously revealed a slightly bitter expression, it‚Äôs not that he was not worried, he just never thought about it at all.

After the night fell, Yang Chen tidied his stall, and pushed the cart back to the crappy apartment he rented.

This was a small apartment that has been around for who knows how many years. The rent for each month was only 100 dollars. It‚Äôs only because nobody wanted to live here that it was this cheap. Unlike other people who worried about the house falling apart, Yang Chen decided to move in the moment he saw how cheap it was.

Yang Chen‚Äôs house had very simple furnishing, it was mostly second hand goods others dumped away. There was a bed, a cabinet, a chair, and a TV that could only watch some basic channels.

After pushing the small cart into his small house, Yang Chen gazed upon the calendar hanging on the wall. He checked the date, suddenly remembered something, and promptly ran to the toilet.

In less than 5 minutes, he took a cold shower, and got out of the bathroom naked. His skin was a healthy yellow colour, his well-proportioned body wasn‚Äôt very conspicuous, but under careful observation, one could perceive a reserved feeling of masculinity.

Walking towards the cabinet beside the bed, Yang Chen scratched his head in distress while looking at the pile of disorderly clothes. He picked out a few and finally put on a yellow shirt, a pair of light linen pants, and wore the same plastic slippers.

After leaving his house, Yang Chen hurried towards the west region‚Äôs most prosperous street, which was also the shabby west region‚Äôs only respectable street, named ‚ÄúBar Street‚Äù.

The nightlife of feasting and pleasure-seeking was all around, there were colorful skirts, and all sorts of different perfumes. The moment one entered Bar Street, the city‚Äôs atmosphere swept through.

Yang Chen didn‚Äôt openly stare like some undisguised and unscrupulous young men, and also didn‚Äôt secretly peep at the thighs of beautiful ladies on the street that the others were drooling at.

The bar‚Äôs neon lit signboard wasn‚Äôt considered dazzling, the bar that could only be considered mid-sized contained a mysterious air, brilliantly colored rose shaped lights were decorated on the signboard.

After entering the bar, Yang Chen walked to the side of the counter in a routine manner, and sat at a corner.

‚ÄúBig bro Chen, you‚Äôre here.‚Äù The young bartender wearing a vest noticed Yang Chen, and revealed a warm smile. At the same time, he brought out a cup of water, ‚ÄúBig sis Rose has been waiting for you for a long time.‚Äù

Yang Chen gave him a smile, then took a sip from the glass, ‚ÄúBig sis Rose isn‚Äôt angry right? I returned home a little late, so I arrived late.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot angry, not angry.‚Äù Little Zhao smiled, it was as if the few pimples on his round face were smiling at him as well. With an imploring tone he said: ‚ÄúBig bro Chen, when you have time please teach me. What sort of method did you use that you even managed to pick up our big sis Rose? You know, if the people in Zhong Hai who were interested in our boss made a queue, they could queue from the west region till the sea. For so many years I‚Äôve never seen the boss so in love with any other man. Yet today, just the question of whether you‚Äôre here yet, had been asked no less than 5 times‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt speak drivel, there‚Äôs nothing going on between me and big sis Rose‚Ä¶..‚Äù Yang Chen helplessly, and unenthusiastically replied.

Little Zhao had an expression of ‚ÄòI won‚Äôt believe that even if you kill me‚Äô, then sighed, ‚ÄúGeez‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ big bro Chen, to be honest, this cold demeanor of yours is too high level, to be able to pick up a world-breaking beauty like our lady boss. Which man wouldn‚Äôt stick to her everyday? There‚Äôs only you, who comes only once in a while and even lets a beauty wait for you. Otherwise why do people say that things that you cannot obtain are the best? This sentence is suited to be used on women‚Ä¶..‚Äù

Right as little Zhao had an expression of a saint at romance and exaggeration, a charming yet dignified and intelligent voice appeared behind him, ‚ÄúLittle Zhao, how many more times do you think your pay can get cut?‚Äù

As if he was shocked by an electric current, Little Zhao was dumbfounded. Once he returned to his senses, he immediately sidestepped and pretended to mix drinks, as if nothing happened, but the cold sweat on his forehead gave away the fear in his heart.

With an elegant modern qipao, her thighs were vaguely displayed through the slit to the side of her leg which released an arousing sex appeal. In addition her plump breasts, and an exquisite waist matched well with that smooth porcelain-like face that looked like a meticulous piece of art. On her shoulder were strands of light purple hair. This was a young lady with an appearance like she came out from a painting, as she leisurely walked towards Yang Chen.

Yang Chen smiled with both his face and eyes, looking right at the lady without a trace of awkwardness, and sincerely said, ‚ÄúBig sis Rose, you‚Äôre really pretty, happy birthday.

**Chapter 2: Money is Needed to Find a Prostitute**

Hearing the praise, Rose slightly blushed, bit her smooth lips, and with a tone full of remorse she said, ‚ÄúWhat use is there being pretty? A certain someone seldom comes by, and even when it‚Äôs my birthday that person still arrives this late.‚Äù

Facing this sweet and charming lady, a tinge of lust welled up in Yang Chen, increasing exponentially due to her mesmerizing eyes looking at him, without any inkling of abhor. However, with a noble heart Yang Chen managed to suppress his wild desires. Restoring his tranquility, he said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt drink, and I‚Äôm also not good at saying words that make ladies happy. Moreover, I set up my stall everyday, and truly don‚Äôt have much spare time.‚Äù

Rose grudgingly glared at Yang Chen, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt speak such useless words to me. Setting up a stall? What‚Äôs good about setting up a crappy lamb skewers stall? Even if you work yourself to death you won‚Äôt earn much money, if you really want to make money, come and be my housekeeper. The salary I‚Äôll pay you every month will be 100 times of what you make from selling lamb skewers!‚Äù

Yang Chen bitterly laughed and said, ‚ÄúBig sis Rose, men don‚Äôt usually become housekeepers.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve told you so many times, call me Rose, why are you always calling big sis, big sis, big sis, am I that old?‚Äù

Yang Chen could only compromise, ‚ÄúAlright, Rose, I was wrong. It‚Äôs just that, I somewhat enjoy my current lifestyle, for the time being I don‚Äôt intend to switch jobs.‚Äù

Unwilling to give up, Rose said, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to be my housekeeper then, being my bodyguard will do right? Or, I could let you be the manager of the bar, I rarely supervise this place anyways, I usually let it be.‚Äù

Hearing these words, Yang Chen felt a little touched, of course he knew this woman truly cared for him, but he had his own stance. Since the day he met Rose, he decided not to get too intimate with this woman.

‚ÄúForget it Rose, I feel that selling mutton skewers is pretty good, the farmers‚Äô market has quite a number of nice people as well.‚Äù Yang Chen lowered his head to drink his water, unwilling to continue on this subject.

Upon seeing Yang Chen‚Äôs stubbornness, Rose frowned, then angrily whispered to herself, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only good if you become my man‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.‚Äù

What she doesn‚Äôt didn‚Äôt realise was, the words that she said, that she herself could barely hear, were words that Yang Chen clearly heard, but Yang Chen knew that he must pretend that he didn‚Äôt hear anything.

No matter how dim the lights in the bar were, Rose‚Äôs face and physique still emitted an irresistible charm. However, from the moment Rose appeared, even when some people noticed her, they would only dare to take one glance before looking away. Some curious new customers asked the surrounding patrons who Rose was, and there was basically only one answer‚Äî‚Äî ‚ÄúDrink your liquor, don‚Äôt court death.‚Äù

Feeling a little defeated, Rose walked to the other side of the counter, sat beside Yang Chen, first poured a glass of whiskey for herself, then poured another for Yang Chen, rolled her eyes and rebuked, ‚ÄúOld ox, I know you‚Äôre tough. It‚Äôs fine that you are unwilling to stay by my side, however today‚Äôs my birthday, can you make an exception and drink a glass of liquor?‚Äù

Yang Chen hesitated for a moment, the truth was, it‚Äôs not that he can‚Äôt drink, it‚Äôs just that every time he drinks, the alcohol would cause disorder to his psyche. There were too many things he didn‚Äôt want to recall, which is why he needed to be calm. Therefore, to him, alcohol is poison‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

‚ÄúAlright, but only one glass.‚Äù Harboring a tinge of guilt, Yang Chen is unwilling to utterly disappoint Rose, so he decided to accept. Silently hoping in his heart that nothing will happen, since it‚Äôs only a small glass.

Sure enough, Rose happily smiled, that smile resembled seeing snow for the first time. Under the dim light, her visage glowed with luster, entering Yang Chen‚Äôs eyes, it made his heart tremble again.

‚ÄúCheers.‚Äù

After clinking the glasses, Yang Chen raised his head and drank the ice-cold liquid without any hesitation.

Rose made a ‚Äògege‚Äô laugh, leaned forward, and pressed her body onto Yang Chen‚Äôs chest and melancholily said, ‚ÄúDo you know, it has been 10 years since I last celebrated my birthday. Although there‚Äôs no cake, no candles, no presents, not even a party‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ there is an unromantic man like you to accompany me to a drink, I feel very contented‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù

This woman‚Äôs physique looked well-developed from any angle and caused men to drool. At this moment, Yang Chen distinctly felt two soft moldable lumps pressing against his thigh, gently stroking it, bringing with it a stimulating sensation.

Slightly lowering his head, he saw the slit of Rose‚Äôs qipao, and the fairly discernible soft porcelain-like snowy skin. Below her exquisite ankles was a pair of fiery-red high-heeled shoes,

The intense visual stimulation along with fierce seduction aroused Yang Chen‚Äôs male hormones.

When a man meets a woman, among hormones, the adrenal glands hormones‚Äô reaction, is the most straightforward evaluation of the woman. Evidently, Rose scored well in this.

Just as Yang Chen did his best to suppress his body‚Äôs reaction, Rose finally stood up, gave him a crafty smile, as if she was a fox who succeeded in her plot, ‚ÄúThis is good, my man, seems like your ‚Äòcapital‚Äô is outstandingly robust huh‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù

Yang Chen forced a smile, of course he knew what Rose was referring to. This woman, she actually peeped on him while she approached earlier.

‚ÄúI can see that you can barely endure sitting here, I‚Äôm going to go entertain my other customers, if you don‚Äôt want to stay any longer, you may leave.‚Äù Rose left the seat in a natural and unrestrained manner, and walked towards the other customers.

The customers of the bar long ago knew that the bar‚Äôs lady boss was very charming, yet they didn‚Äôt dare to forgo their manners. This was due to receiving information that the woman‚Äôs background wasn‚Äôt simple at all. As a result, it was effortless for Rose greet her customers.

As a matter of fact, Rose‚Äôs face contained a passionate smile. That extraordinary temperament was enough to cause the majority of men to feel intimidated, thus they could only look on from a distance. Also, they didn‚Äôt want to reveal any notions of obscenity, as nobody courted a rebuff.

When Rose left, Yang Chen breathed a sigh of relief, and at the same time he silently mocked himself. For the last half a year that he returned to this country, he seemed to have changed quite a bit.

If it was the Yang Chen of the past, facing a mesmerizing lady like Rose who had affection for him, there wouldn‚Äôt even be a need for her to seduce him. He would‚Äôve thrown her onto a bed long ago without a care for whatever the consequences. In any case after the deed was done he could just leave.

However, he can‚Äôt do that now, especially to Rose who can be considered one of his first friends in Zhong Hai, and to him, in his heart she was significant.

Although he only drank a small amount, the alcohol had already started affecting his mind. Yang Chen felt that his craving for alcohol had already been awoken, yet he didn‚Äôt dare to drink in excess, the pain of recalling unwanted things after drinking is something only he understood.

However, seeing that his lower body still had a pitched tent, Yang Chen felt the need to vent some of his pent-up emotions, otherwise ‚Äòit‚Äô would be stifled to death. But of course, Rose won‚Äôt do, once they have that relationship, it would be difficult for him to get away.

After drinking a cup of water, Yang Chen quietly left ROSE bar. When he left, within the eyes of Rose who silently watched him leave, was a sense of disappointment.

Outside the bar, Yang Chen looked around, before finally walking towards a small bar close by. There may be many prey in high-class bars, but the money in Yang Chen‚Äôs wallet wouldn‚Äôt be enough.

**Chapter 3: Initiative**

Soon after walking near this small bar, Yang Chen understood that he came to the right place.

The small bar‚Äôs misty lights were vague yet dreamlike. All around; at the counter, in the corners, and even in the middle of the hall, there were couples with arms over each other‚Äôs shoulders, embracing and hugging, the young men and women intermingled freely. Unrestrained and charming laughter continuously arose.

Yang Chen only got a few steps in, when a lady in heavy makeup and gaudy clothing approached him, her upper body was covered with only a rose-colored bra, while her lower body a black leather miniskirt. Holding an amber-colored liquor in her hand, she staggered and plastered herself onto him.

‚ÄúHandsome, will you treat me to a drink?‚Äù The woman‚Äôs voice was very coy, enough to make any man nauseated.

As it‚Äôs been a long time since he came into contact with alcohol, the already somewhat hot-headed Yang Chen conveniently pinched the protruding tip of the woman‚Äôs bra gently, the woman‚Äôs whole body trembled immediately, then gurgled with laughter, ‚ÄúHandsome you‚Äôre so nasty, pinching that place of mine the moment we met, if you ruin it by pinching, how are you going to compensate me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù On one hand rebuking with discontent, on the other hand pressing herself even closer, a pair of shining white arms already hooked onto Yang Chen‚Äôs neck.

Yang Chen had a nefarious smile plastered on his face, he had not much interest in a woman like that, she seemed too easy. Yang Chen pushed the woman away from his body, ‚ÄúI have no interest in a drunk sow who only thinks of mating.‚Äù

Apparently some parts of her brain was still sober, because when the woman heard ‚Äúsow‚Äù, her blood immediately started boiling, and she fiercely smashed the glass of liquor onto the ground. ‚ÄúStinky brat, you must be tired of living! You wait!‚Äù Done speaking, she angrily walked towards a pile of people at the corner of the bar.

Yang Chen suddenly had a nefarious desire enter his heart, it‚Äôs been a long time since he had come to this kind of place, and dealt with this sort of people. It seemed like today he could rely on the effect of the alcohol to relieve this pent-up desire.

After going to the bar counter to ask for a shot of vodka, a scorching heat began boiling inside Yang Chen, while his eyes revealed peculiar excitement.

There was no way of knowing how that gorgeously dressed woman managed to call in 8 men, all of them were well-built, had the vitality of a dragon and fierceness of a tiger. The moment Yang Chen finished his shot, they surrounded him.

The woman hugged onto the thick and solid arm of the large bald man who stood at the front, she pointed at Yang Chen and sharply called out, ‚ÄúBig bro! It was this bastard who treated me badly, help me beat him to death!‚Äù

The large man took a look at Yang Chen‚Äôs slim physique, and revealed a gaze of disdain. He then signalled two of his subordinates to make a move to teach Yang Chen a lesson.

The two men maliciously smiled as they moved forward, they didn‚Äôt intend to waste words with Yang Chen, and directly swung a sandbag-sized fist.

Yang Chen didn‚Äôt even bother looking, with a calm expression as if nothing had happened, he lifted both of his hands at the perfect timing and his palms collided with the two men‚Äôs fists‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

‚ÄúOWW!!!‚Äù

The two big men screamed at the same time and fell to the ground, then unceasingly rolled about while holding onto their own hand.

This scene that took place in the bar seemed both strange and abrupt. Although fights and brawls often happens in this little bar, never before has this baldy‚Äôs group eaten a loss. Unable to resist, many people looked towards Yang Chen with curiosity.

The baldy saw that things weren‚Äôt going as planned, and he couldn‚Äôt help but frown. He cast a suspicious glance at Yang Chen, then crouched down and picked up the arm of his hurt subordinate. It was no big deal if he didn‚Äôt see the arm, but after he did, his forehead immediately had cold sweat streaming down‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

The other subordinates who stood behind saw their own men being hit, and began raining curses, but before they moved up to attack, they were held back by the baldy who blocked them with his arms.

Without so much as an explanation, baldy bowed to Yang Chen after standing up, ‚ÄúBig bro is a great man with great magnanimity, this time us brothers have offended you, if there‚Äôs anything big bro needs from us in the future, please don‚Äôt hesitate to call out to us, hope to see you again!‚Äù

With that said, baldy had his confused brothers carry the two men wailing in pain out of the bar.

That woman felt that things were inconceivable, as they left the bar, she was still hooting about why he didn‚Äôt help to vent her anger.

Baldy Hu glared at the woman, then said to his little brothers who were also bewildered, ‚ÄúEarlier, that person broke Fifth and Sixth brothers‚Äô arms with his palms, do you guys think you can beat him?‚Äù

Those few guys immediately regained their cool, the two light looking palms earlier actually had that much strength, if he wasn‚Äôt expert then who was he? Immediately, some of them began flattering the baldy, saying things like boss had great foresight.

However, the baldy didn‚Äôt pay attention to their flattering, he instead turned his head towards the bar, while deep in thought. It was unknown what went through his mind.

Meanwhile, Yang Chen who was still in the bar was unaffected. Seeing baldy and the others leave, the space at the corner of the bar was open, so he unhurriedly walked over, intending to carefully search for his ‚Äúprey‚Äù for the night.

Because Yang Chen defeated baldy and his gang so easily, a sense of fear arose in the men and women present in the bar. Occasionally, several hot chicks would send coquettish gazes at Yang Chen, but were ignored, and could only give up seducing him.

Right as Yang Chen was about to sit on the sofa, he realized that at a booth in the corner, there was a person lying down, and it was even a young lady.

With a mere glance, Yang Chen‚Äôs gaze became heated‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Under the dim light, the soft jet-black hair hung from the sofa down onto the carpet, a white one-piece dress wrapped over the beautiful curves, which were like soft and beautiful waves.

After moving closer, Yang Chen could smell an alluring body scent which brought with it a mix of jasmine and alcohol.

The woman seemed to be very drunk. Her fair hand held onto a wine glass, yet her body weakly leaned against the sofa lightly, and shifted about from time to time. That well-rounded butt of hers formed a captivating curvy line.

Yang Chen walked up to her, supported the woman up, and shifted away the messy hair covering her face, revealing a drunk and flushed pretty face.

What made Yang Chen astonished was, this woman‚Äôs looks were actually prettier than Rose who he met earlier. Whether it was that beautifully sculpted face, or the cool elegance and allure from being drunk, either was enough to make any man lose himself.

However, a gorgeous beauty of this level also made Yang Chen feel perplexed. How could this kind of woman be a prostitute? But if she‚Äôs not a prostitute, why would she drink with those people till she‚Äôs dead drunk? Moreover with a lustful and ardent expression.

The woman seemed to have been drunk, without waiting for Yang Chen to ponder further, she casually grabbed hold of Yang Chen‚Äôs shirt collar, then her tender and beautiful lips which were like fresh flowers came kissing.

But because she was unable to find the target, the woman‚Äôs kiss only landed on Yang Chen‚Äôs cheek, then slid away.

Yang Chen was stimulated by that ice-cold yet soft contact on his face to the point where he felt like he was burning all over. Seeing this beautiful and delicate lady‚Äôs limpid expression, with a captivating appearance that anybody would want to take ownership of, he then thought. He himself wanted to indulge for a night, why think so much? Embracing the soft and delicate body with force, he fiercely kissed onto the woman‚Äôs fragrant lips.

**Chapter 4: Reaction**

When the morning light shined its way through the mottled windows and into Yang Chen‚Äôs home, Yang Chen swayed his head in a daze. He wanted to get up, but suddenly felt something soft wrapped around him.

Yang Chen who immediately turned clear-headed looked down, sure enough, it was the drunk woman he brought home last night.

At this moment a lotus-like arm hugged onto his waist. Beneath the blanket, a pair of plump breasts squeezed onto his thigh, that exquisite point of contact felt as smooth as velvet. A pair of white and delicate thighs unreservedly coiled around his lower body, faintly revealing that alluring butt line, with some traces of last night‚Äôs indulgence.

Perfectly matching with the woman soundly asleep was that innocent and absolutely beautiful face, which made Yang Chen can‚Äôt help but lament, among all the women he has met in his lifetime, this woman is definitely capable of entering the top 3.

Just as Yang Chen was lamenting this heaven-sent art piece of a lady‚Äôs figure, out of the corner of his eyes, he abruptly saw that at the tail-end of the bed, there was a dry red bloodstain on the bedsheet!

His heartstrings being pulled, Yang Chen frowned as he looked at the woman who still looked indifferent, somewhat surprised. This blood obviously wasn‚Äôt bled by him, but it was truly unexpected, a beauty that was that deranged was actually still a virgin.

Many things when thought after it happened would seem obvious at a glance, Yang Chen quickly understood, it was very likely that the baldy from yesterday drugged her. If it wasn‚Äôt for him scaring of that bunch due to various causes, this beautiful black-haired lady would‚Äôve been the baldy and gang‚Äôs prey. It also had been because he drunk too much yesterday, as he did not notice this peculiarity even after getting on the bed.

Just as Yang Chen sat on the bed thinking of how to handle this situation, the woman who slept on him finally woke up.

After the woman opened her eyes in bewilderment, she lightly lifted her head, and saw Yang Chen calmly looking at her.

The man standing in front was very unfamiliar, yet also felt familiar. In her nose, there was a heavy scent of a man‚Äôs body and something else. Doing her best to think through what was going on, the disjointed scenes of last night surfaced in her mind‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ The woman quickly understood how everything came to be!

After Yang Chen learned that she was not a prostitute, he was very curious as to what reaction this woman might have, screaming? Beat and scold him? Call the police? Or even extortion? If that were the case, Yang Chen wouldn‚Äôt feel any guilt, she may do as she pleases. If it weren‚Äôt for him, she would‚Äôve been the cleansing tool for a bunch of men. If she had to blame she could only blame herself for not being careful, mistakenly trespassing a wolf‚Äôs den.

However, the woman‚Äôs reaction was mysteriously tranquil.

She unhurriedly sat up, under the dull sunlight, she got out of the blanket revealing that white jade sculpture-like sexy figure. The visual attack made Yang Chen‚Äôs breathing turn deep and heavy.

On her body there were even lovebites, red imprints of spanking, and even some viscous remains from a man, these could let one‚Äôs imagination run wild.

The woman got off the bed without the slightest bit of awkwardness, and even her fragrant lawn could easily be seen.

But it was precisely this type of indifference and tranquility, which made Yang Chen feel stifled in his heart, taking in a deep breath he then said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù

At that moment the woman turned away to put on her underwear, hearing those words, she couldn‚Äôt help but pause for a moment, but she did not speak or turn around, and continued putting on her clothes.

Yang Chen did not say anything more, but felt like there was a stone weighing on his heart, making it hard to breathe. It had been years since he felt guilt from doing a woman.

During those days, majority of women were merely a medication for his wounds, and simply not the same species that possessed their own thoughts to him. Suddenly, a woman he spent a night with made his heart feel perplexed and full of guilt, Yang Chen began to suspect whether he had been too laid back, and his personality softened.

In less than 5 minutes, the woman had already worn her clothes properly, tidied her appearance for a little, to make sure no one could see any peculiarity in her appearance. After that, as silent as before, she walked towards the door.

Yang Chen saw that she was leaving without a word, so he couldn‚Äôt help but ask, ‚ÄúDo you know the way back? Do you want me to send you back?‚Äù

This time the woman did not even pause at all, she walked out of the room, and casually closed the door.

Yang Chen blankly stared at the door being closed, and couldn‚Äôt help laughing bitterly. This woman was considered top quality amongst the women he had seen his whole life. Just as he was about to get off the bed, Yang Chen whose hearing far exceeded the ability of the average person, heard a sobbing sound, coming from the corridor‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Seems like she still cried, however, she wasn‚Äôt willing to let him see or hear it, unfortunately, she did not know he had hearing that far exceeded the average, so she didn‚Äôt manage to evade him hearing.

Once he thought of how during that whole period of time that woman was forcefully withholding her tears, Yang Chen‚Äôs feeling of guilt once again flared up.

„ÄÇ

After tidying up, Yang Chen remembered that he still had to open his mutton skewers stall. Although the stall doesn‚Äôt earn much money, he always enjoyed being in bustling places where he can watch people come and go, the feeling of being immersed in an ever-changing world. Money doesn‚Äôt matter.

After pushing his single-wheel vending cart to his spot, Old Li who had been selling his deep-fried sausages smiled at Yang Chen, ‚ÄúLittle Yang, you came late today, did you have date or something yesterday?‚Äù

In his heart Yang Chen muttered, there wasn‚Äôt a date, but there was a bed, and in reality he dully replied, ‚ÄúHow can there be such a thing? Don‚Äôt let your thoughts drift off, I just overslept.‚Äù

Old Li laughed, and with satisfaction he said, ‚ÄúMy family‚Äôs Jingjing finished her internship and returned home, yesterday she even told me to remember the kindness you showed us. Little Yang, if it wasn‚Äôt for you, how can we possibly manage to afford both letting my wife see a doctor and providing Jingjing enough money to survive during her internship at that far away place?‚Äù

Old Li‚Äôs daughter, Li Jingjing, is the child he and his wife conceived late, their treasure. When she graduated from university, she went to another city for internship for two months, before returning home.

Yang Chen had met that girl twice, she‚Äôs classified as a jade-like beauty, however she‚Äôs his friend‚Äôs daughter, so he wouldn‚Äôt have ideas about her.

‚ÄúHaha, remember what kindness? In the future when I‚Äôm out of cash to eat you can just let me freeload on a few meals and that will do.‚Äù Yang Chen jokingly said.

‚ÄúAlright then!‚Äù Old Li suddenly nodded, ‚ÄúIf you didn‚Äôt mention it I would‚Äôve forgotten, my wife and Jingjing both said to invite you to our house for a meal to properly express our gratitude. Tonight it is then!‚Äù

‚ÄúThis‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Isn‚Äôt necessary right? Your family is having difficulty getting by on your own, what are you inviting me to have a meal for?‚Äù

Old Li pretended to be somewhat angry as he said, ‚ÄúHow expensive can a meal get? Merely coarse tea and plain rice, Little Yang, if you don‚Äôt come you‚Äôre holding my family in contempt.‚Äù

Yang Chen was left without a choice, he couldn‚Äôt out stubborn this tough old man, so he could only nod in agreement, and Old Li delightfully smiled.

But right at that moment, a few hoodlum‚Äôs figures once again appeared in the market, spotting Yang Chen and Old Li, the leading little hoodlum evilly grinned.

I recently bought these beans from volcano:

https://volcanocoffeeworks.com/products/tiramisu-coffee

I‚Äôm using the touch impress and am struggling to dial them in. Essentially the grind setting I‚Äôm using is correct, but only after pulling a few shots. The first come out in drips suggesting the grinds are too fine but then the 3rd/4th comes out perfect. 

I‚Äôm not sure what I need to do to fix this. The temp is currently set at default (91 degrees C I think). Would it be something to do with this? 

Thanks.

I‚Äôm at a point where personal saving isn‚Äôt really for anything and I‚Äôm not sure whether to reduce down what I save each month or even bother at all. 

I‚Äôve got enough for emergencies (boiler replacement, job loss covered for six months, major car repairs etc). My wife and I save via our joint account which I contribute to as part of a lump sum into that account each month and then I‚Äôm saving myself. 

Mortgage is fine, bills are ok. Two children and a dog, all covered. 

I was brought up to save for the future but I have everything I need and I think I might be hamstringing my enjoyment of the present by just putting everything spare I have into a pot that‚Äôs supposed to be for ‚Äòsomeday‚Äô. 

I‚Äôll put off going to gigs or having a coffee when I‚Äôm out and about once a week for this supposed future date.

My family's beloved Majestic movie theater was facing foreclosure, a legacy crumbling after my father's passing. I, Amelia Hayes, an aspiring screenwriter, had one desperate shot: get my script noticed. Then, a powerful Hollywood producer, Marcus Thorne, offered a lifeline: ""Be my companion, and your theater is saved.""  
  
I fell for his charm, mistaking grand gestures for genuine affection. But his A-list ex-fianc√©e, Victoria Sinclair, reappeared, instantly making it clear I was nothing but a temporary distraction, a pawn in Marcus's desperate game to win Victoria back.  
  
Victoria orchestrated cruel tests, and Marcus consistently chose her, culminating in him publicly abandoning me at a gala. She moved into his home, humiliating me, then framed me for an attack, leading Marcus to lock me in his w\*ne cellar without question. Later, at a public university event, he looked straight at me and coldly denied knowing me.  
  
The humiliation, the betrayal, the objectification--how could I have been so foolish, so disposable? Every ""affectionate"" moment had been a calculated lie, designed to make Victoria jealous. The man I thought I loved had used me, broken me, then discarded me.  
  
Enough was enough. I wouldn't be his pawn any longer. I sent him a final, defiant message, severed all ties, and left for Paris, determined to reclaim my dignity, heal my heart, and write my own story, far from the gilded cage of Hollywood.  
  
  
Chapter 1  
The foreclosure notice felt cold in my hand.  
  
The lawyer's words echoed in the stuffy office of the Majestic, our family's movie theater.  
  
""Thirty days, Ms. Hayes.""  
  
My mother, Sarah, sat beside me, her face pale.  
  
The Majestic wasn't just a building.  
  
It was Dad's dream.  
  
His legacy.  
  
Now, his medical debts and some bad calls before he passed were about to swallow it whole.  
  
I clutched the worn screenplay in my lap.  
  
""Hollywood Haze."" My one shot.  
  
I had to save the theater.  
  
I had to.  
  
Somehow, I scraped together enough money for a bus ticket to Los Angeles.  
  
A tiny, almost unknown film festival was happening.  
  
Maybe, just maybe, I could get my script into someone's hands.  
  
I stood awkwardly at a crowded industry mixer.  
  
My pitch felt clumsy, rehearsed too many times in a dusty bus seat.  
  
A man I tried to talk to, some low-level agent, barely glanced at my script.  
  
Then, a voice cut through the noise, deep and confident.  
  
""What's this about?""  
  
Marcus Thorne.  
  
The Marcus Thorne.  
  
His picture was always in the trades, a kingmaker producer.  
  
He was older, maybe early forties, with eyes that saw everything.  
  
He took my script, flipped a few pages, then looked at me.  
  
Not at the script, but at \*me\*.  
  
A slow smile spread across his face.  
  
""The script needs work, kid.""  
  
My heart sank.  
  
""But you... you have potential.""  
  
He leaned closer.  
  
""I have a proposition. I'm looking for a companion. Someone bright, beautiful, to be on my arm. You do that for me, and your little theater in Ohio? Consider it saved.""  
  
A companion.  
  
My stomach twisted.  
  
But then I saw Mom's face, the crumbling facade of the Majestic.  
  
""Okay,"" I whispered.  
  
""The Majestic is safe?""  
  
""As long as you're with me,"" he said, his smile never wavering.  
  
The deal was made.  
  
Marcus moved fast.  
  
One day I was in a cheap motel, the next I was in a sleek, minimalist apartment he provided.  
  
He took me to a struggling art-house cinema I'd once mentioned I loved.  
  
The next week, a sign went up: ""The Hayes Classic Cinema - A Gift from Marcus Thorne.""  
  
He beamed at me.  
  
""For us, Amelia. For our love of film.""  
  
I felt a warmth spread through me, unexpected.  
  
He flew me to a private island film festival on his jet.  
  
Red carpets, champagne, famous faces smiling at me because I was with \*him\*.  
  
I felt like I was in a dream.  
  
Then, I got a terrible flu, right before a major international distribution meeting he was supposed to chair.  
  
I expected him to be annoyed, to leave me with a doctor.  
  
Instead, he cancelled the meeting.  
  
He stayed by my side, brought me soup, read to me.  
  
""You're more important, Amy,"" he murmured, st\*\*king my hair.  
  
Amy. He called me Amy.  
  
This wasn't just a deal, was it?  
  
He seemed to genuinely care.  
  
I started to fall for him, hard.  
  
This powerful, worldly man, showing me such tenderness.  
  
It felt real.  
  
The news hit the trades like a thunderclap.  
  
""Victoria Sinclair Returns to Hollywood.""  
  
Marcus's former fianc√©e. The A-list actress who had left him years ago.  
  
I asked Marcus about it.  
  
He shrugged, his eyes unreadable.  
  
""Ancient history, Amy.""  
  
But a knot formed in my stomach.  
  
A few days later, I was at a quiet cafe, trying to work on a new script idea.  
  
A woman approached my table.  
  
Perfectly styled, impossibly glamorous.  
  
Victoria Sinclair.  
  
""Amelia Hayes, I presume?"" she said, her voice smooth as silk.  
  
She sat down without asking.  
  
""Marcus has told me... so little about you.""  
  
Her eyes scanned me, a polite smile on her lips that didn't reach them.  
  
It felt like an assessment.  
  
A threat.  
  
""You're very young,"" Victoria observed, stirring her untouched espresso.  
  
""Marcus likes... youth.""  
  
I bristled. ""Marcus cares for me.""  
  
My voice sounded small, even to my own ears.  
  
Victoria laughed, a light, tinkling sound.  
  
""Oh, darling, of course he \*cares\*. He cares for all his little projects.""  
  
She leaned forward, her voice dropping.  
  
""But don't confuse attention with affection. You're a placeholder, a pleasant distraction until the real thing comes along.""  
  
""That's not true,"" I said, trying to sound firm.  
  
""Isn't it?"" Her eyes gleamed. ""Let's find out. A little test, shall we?""  
  
My heart hammered.  
  
""Tomorrow, around noon, I'll text Marcus. A little wardrobe malfunction before a minor luncheon. Nothing serious.""  
  
She paused, watching me.  
  
""You text him around the same time. Say you've had a minor car accident. Also nothing serious, just a fender bender. Let's see who he calls first.""  
  
Fear coiled in my gut. This was cruel.  
  
But a desperate, ugly part of me needed to know.  
  
""Okay,"" I whispered.  
  
The next day, my hands shook as I typed out the fake text about a car accident.  
  
I sent it at 12:03 PM.  
  
My phone lay silent on the table.  
  
One minute passed. Two.  
  
My stomach churned.  
  
I replayed his gentle words, his hand on my forehead when I was sick.  
  
The way he looked at me when he dedicated that cinema.  
  
He had to care.  
  
At 12:07 PM, my phone remained dark.  
  
Then, Victoria's call came through on my other line - a burner phone she'd insisted I use for this.  
  
Her voice was triumphant.  
  
""He called me at 12:01, darling. So worried about my dress. Offered his personal stylist immediately.""  
  
A cold wave washed over me.  
  
""Did he... did he call you?"" Victoria asked, feigning concern.  
  
""No,"" I managed.  
  
""Oh. Well, I'm sure he's just busy.""  
  
The line went dead.  
  
My own phone finally buzzed. A text from Marcus, sent at 12:15 PM.  
  
\*""You okay? In a meeting.""\*  
  
That was it.  
  
The warmth I'd felt from him turned to ice.  
  
Later that week, Victoria ""ran into me"" at a gallery opening.  
  
She was radiant, Marcus's hand possessively on her waist.  
  
She smiled sweetly at me.  
  
""Amy, darling! So good to see you.""  
  
She gestured to a ridiculously ornate movie prop on display.  
  
""Marcus bought a failing vintage movie prop house once, just because I admired a little tiara there. He's so extravagant when he truly cares, isn't he?""  
  
Her eyes flicked to mine, knowing.  
  
Then, with a sigh, ""And that private island film festival? We had such memories there, years ago. He always did love that spot.""  
  
Each word was a small, sharp cut.  
  
I felt sick.  
  
At a studio party a few nights later, I tried to avoid them.  
  
But I overheard two of Marcus's executives, their voices slurred by al\*\*hol.  
  
""Thorne's still got it bad for Sinclair. Never really got over her.""  
  
""Remember all those 'business trips' to Europe? Always coincided with her film premieres there. He chased her for years.""  
  
The pieces clicked into place, ugly and sharp.  
  
I was a fool.  
  
The industry gala was a nightmare.  
  
Marcus insisted I attend.  
  
He was all over me, ostentatious k\*\*ses, his arm tight around my waist.  
  
His eyes kept flicking to Victoria, who watched with a cool, amused expression.  
  
He was using me. Showing her he'd moved on, trying to make her jealous.  
  
I felt like a puppet.  
  
Midway through the main course, Victoria pressed her fingers to her temple.  
  
""Oh, Marcus, darling,"" she murmured, her voice faint. ""My migraine. It's come back, terribly.""  
  
Marcus was instantly at her side.  
  
""I'll take you home,"" he said, all concern.  
  
He didn't even glance at me as he led Victoria from the ballroom.  
  
Abandoned. Publicly.  
  
That was the final straw.  
  
I went back to the apartment, my cheeks burning with humiliation.  
  
I found my old, creased acceptance letter to UCLA's film program. I'd deferred it because of the Majestic, because of Marcus.  
  
My eyes fell on the custom-designed, vintage-style clapperboard he'd had made for me.  
  
Engraved on it: ""Our Story.""  
  
I snatched it up and threw it into the tr\*\*h can with all the force I could muster.  
  
Our story. What a joke.  
  
I started packing. Just essentials. My clothes, my laptop, my scripts.  
  
My father's vintage Super 8 camera, his most precious possession he'd left me, went into my carry-on.  
  
Suddenly, the bedroom door opened.  
  
Victoria stood there, a silk robe clinging to her, a smug smile on her face.  
  
She was staying here now. In Marcus's mansion.  
  
""Leaving so soon, little mouse?""  
  
Her eyes landed on the Super 8 camera peeking from my bag.  
  
She picked it up, her perfectly manicured fingers tracing its lines.  
  
""Oh, this looks old. Probably very fragile.""  
  
She dangled it casually.  
  
My bl\*\*d ran cold. ""Please, don't.""  
  
""Kneel,"" she said, her voice soft but laced with steel.  
  
""Kneel and apologize for wasting Marcus's time, for thinking you could ever be more than a temporary amusement. Do that, and maybe I won't... accidentally... drop this.""  
  
My father's camera.  
  
Tears welled in my eyes. I couldn't let her break it.  
  
Slowly, reluctantly, I sank to my knees.  
  
""I... I'm sorry.""  
  
The words choked me.  
  
As I knelt, Victoria made a small sound, a theatrical ""oops!""  
  
She ""tripped"" over nothing, her body lurching.  
  
The camera flew from her hand, arcing through the air.  
  
At the same time, she tumbled dramatically down the two carpeted steps leading into the sunken part of the master suite, letting out a piercing scream.  
  
The camera hit the marble floor with a sickening crack.  
  
Marcus burst into the room, his face a mask of fury.  
  
He saw Victoria sprawled on the steps, clutching her ankle. He saw the broken camera.  
  
""She pushed me, Marcus!"" Victoria sobbed. ""She was angry I found her packing to sneak away! She attacked me and broke your... our... that camera thing!""  
  
Marcus didn't even look at me.  
  
His rage was a physical force.  
  
He grabbed my arm, his fingers digging in like talons.  
  
""You ungrateful little witch!""  
  
He dragged me out of the room, down a flight of stairs, to his expansive, soundproofed w\*ne cellar.  
  
He shoved me inside.  
  
The heavy door slammed shut, the lock clicking with terrifying finality.  
  
Darkness. Cold.  
  
Hours passed. I don't know how many.  
  
I huddled on the cold stone floor, shivering, clutching the pieces of my father's camera.  
  
Finally, the lock turned.  
  
Marcus stood there, silhouetted against the dim hallway light.  
  
He held out the Super 8 camera. It looked... whole.  
  
""It's fixed,"" he said, his voice flat, devoid of emotion.  
  
""Let's just forget this happened.""  
  
Forget? He'd locked me in a cellar for hours because he believed a liar over me.  
  
No apology for his actions, no remorse for his cruelty.  
  
He showed no sign he even considered I might be innocent.  
  
I took the camera, my hand trembling.  
  
Victoria, emboldened, began her torment.  
  
Texts arrived daily.  
  
Photos of her and Marcus at exclusive Hollywood parties I was never invited to.  
  
Close-ups of her wearing a diamond necklace - a necklace Marcus had gifted \*me\* weeks ago, claiming it was a symbol of ""their unique connection.""  
  
Each picture was a fresh stab of pain.  
  
I started my classes at UCLA.  
  
I threw myself into my studies, trying to build a wall around the hollow ache in my ch\*st.  
  
I submitted a short film, a raw, personal piece, to a student film festival.  
  
The night of the festival, my heart pounded.  
  
Then I saw them.  
  
Marcus and Victoria, entering the auditorium, all power and glamour.  
  
They sat in the VIP section.  
  
During a lull, some of my former acquaintances, sycophants who knew of my past with Marcus, spotted him.  
  
One of them, a girl named Tiffany, called out loudly, ""Marcus, darling! Do you remember that little writer, Amelia Hayes? She's a student here now!""  
  
All eyes turned to me, then to Marcus.  
  
Victoria, ever the actress, turned to Marcus, her voice dripping with false sweetness, loud enough for everyone nearby, including me, to hear.  
  
""Darling, do you know her?""  
  
Marcus looked directly at me. His eyes were cold, dismissive.  
  
He wanted to present a united front with Victoria, to erase me completely.  
  
""Never seen her before in my life,"" he said, his voice carrying clearly in the hushed room.  
  
The world tilted. Crushed wasn't a strong enough word.  
  
But I lifted my chin. I would not let them see me break.  
  
Not again.  
  
That night was Marcus's birthday.  
  
He was hosting a lavish party at his mansion, the kind that made headlines.  
  
I was at LAX, a one-way ticket to Ohio in my hand.  
  
I needed to go home, to breathe air that wasn't thick with Hollywood deceit.  
  
To rethink everything. Maybe LA, maybe screenwriting, wasn't for me after all.  
  
The Majestic was safe, that was the core of our deal.  
  
My part was done. His part was done.  
  
Before boarding, I pulled out my phone.  
  
I typed a short text to Marcus.  
  
\*""Marcus, I won't be at your party. The Majestic is safe, so our arrangement is over. I'm going home. Goodbye.""\*  
  
I hit send.  
  
Then, I turned off my phone and walked onto the plane.  
  
Marcus felt Amy's absence at the party.  
  
A small, nagging unease that grew with every passing hour.  
  
His phone buzzed. A text from Amy.  
  
He read it.  
  
""Home."" ""Goodbye.""  
  
The words slammed into him.  
  
He tried calling her. Straight to voicemail.  
  
A sudden, desperate panic seized him.  
  
He rushed out of his own party, ignoring the confused calls of his guests, even Victoria's annoyed frown.  
  
He sped to the apartment he'd provided for Amy.  
  
It was mostly empty.  
  
Her clothes were gone. Her books. Her presence.  
  
In the kitchen tr\*\*h, he saw it.  
  
The custom clapperboard. ""Our Story."" Discarded.  
  
On the small counter, next to the coffeemaker, sat the repaired Super 8 camera.  
  
Beside it, a small, folded note.  
  
His hand trembled as he opened it.  
  
\*""Thank you for fixing this. It meant more than you know. I hope you find what you're looking for. Amy.""\*  
  
The simple sincerity of her words, the quiet dignity, hit him harder than any accusation.  
  
He sank onto a stool, the note clutched in his hand.  
  
The depth of his feelings for her, a genuine, aching tenderness he'd mistaken for casual affection, crashed over him.  
  
And with it, the crushing weight of his own cruelty, his blindness.  
  
He had destroyed something precious.  
  
He had broken her.  
  
And now, she was gone.  
  
  
Chapter 2  
Professor Davies, my screenwriting mentor at UCLA, looked relieved when I told her I was officially enrolled, no longer deferred.  
  
""Good, Amelia. You belong here. Your talent is undeniable.""  
  
Her words were a small balm.  
  
I noted the date on my student ID.  
  
September 15th.  
  
Marcus's birthday.  
  
The irony wasn't lost on me.  
  
He'd be celebrating, surrounded by his glittering world, while I was finally starting mine, free of him.  
  
Back in the small Westwood apartment I'd found, a tiny, sparse place that was all mine, I sorted through the last of my things from Marcus's orbit.  
  
There was a small, beautifully wrapped gift I'd bought for him weeks ago, for his birthday.  
  
A vintage fountain pen, the kind he collected.  
  
I'd imagined giving it to him, his smile, a shared moment.  
  
Now, the thought was bitter.  
  
I looked at the pen, then at the tr\*\*h can.  
  
With a sigh, I tossed it in.  
  
No more illusions.  
  
No more hoping for something that was never real.  
  
The rain that had started as a drizzle the night I left Marcus turned into a persistent downpour.  
  
I'd walked through it, numb, after the gala.  
  
Now, a fever raged through me.  
  
I lay in bed, shivering, my body aching.  
  
My phone buzzed on the nightstand, but I didn't have the strength to reach for it.  
  
It was probably just another tormenting text from Victoria, or Marcus wondering why I wasn't at his beck and call.  
  
Let it ring.  
  
I was too sick to care, too detached from that world now.  
  
A sharp, insistent knocking woke me from a feverish doze.  
  
I stumbled to the door.  
  
It was one of Marcus's assistants, a man named George, looking impatient.  
  
""Mr. Thorne requires your presence at the studio party tonight, Ms. Hayes.""  
  
His tone was flat, a command, not a request.  
  
I felt a surge of annoyance.  
  
I was sick, I had left, our ""arrangement"" was over.  
  
But a lingering sense of obligation, a st\*pid, ingrained habit of obedience, made me nod.  
  
""Fine,"" I croaked.  
  
My desire for independence warred with the deeply etched power dynamic.  
  
I dragged myself to the studio party, feeling weak and out of place.  
  
My head throbbed.  
  
As I stood near the bar, trying to look inconspicuous, I overheard snippets of conversation from Marcus's inner circle.  
  
They were clustered nearby, champagne flutes in hand.  
  
""She's still around?"" one executive slurred, gesturing vaguely in my direction. ""Thought Thorne would be done with the charity case by now.""  
  
""Nah, he's just using her to make Sinclair jealous,"" another laughed. ""Little Amelia is the perfect temporary distraction. Harmless, pretty, and clearly smitten.""  
  
My face burned. Humiliation, raw and sharp.  
  
So, they all knew. They all saw me as a fool, a pawn.  
  
The confirmation of my worst fears, spoken so casually, was devastating.  
  
Marcus finally spotted me. He strode over, a possessive glint in his eyes.  
  
""There you are, Amelia.""  
  
He draped an arm around my shoulders, pulling me close.  
  
His friends smirked.  
  
One of them, emboldened by al\*\*hol, leaned in.  
  
""Marcus, old boy, you've always had a soft spot for the ingenues. But everyone knows Victoria's the one. You flew to Paris for her premiere last spring, didn't you? ‚ÄòUrgent business,' you said."" He winked.  
  
Another chimed in, ""And Rome the year before that. Man's been chasing her shadow for years.""  
  
Betrayal, sharp and cold, twisted in my gut.  
  
He'd lied, again and again.  
  
His affection, his grand gestures, all a carefully constructed facade.  
  
My entire relationship with him was built on his obsession with another woman.  
  
I tried to pull away, to escape the suffocating circle of knowing smiles and pitying glances.  
  
""I... I don't feel well,"" I mumbled, desperate to leave.  
  
But as I turned, Victoria Sinclair materialized before me, blocking my path.  
  
She was stunning in a crimson gown, her eyes glittering with triumph.  
  
""Leaving so soon, Amelia?"" she purred, her voice carrying. ""But the party's just getting started.""  
  
She looped her arm through Marcus's, pressing herself against him.  
  
""Marcus, darling, isn't Amelia looking a little pale?""  
  
She was asserting her dominance, using my presence to highlight her victory.  
  
I felt trapped, exposed, utterly powerless.  
  
Marcus, seemingly oblivious to my distress, or perhaps choosing to ignore it, frowned slightly.  
  
""What was that about a car accident the other day, Amelia? You never fully explained.""  
  
He was trying to maintain a facade of normalcy, of concern.  
  
But his eyes were on Victoria, gauging her reaction.  
  
He commanded, ""Come, join us. Have a drink.""  
  
It wasn't an invitation. It was an order.  
  
He was still playing his game, and I was still his unwilling pawn.  
  
My internal conflict was a raging storm.  
  
Part of me wanted to scream, to expose him, to run.  
  
But I was trapped by his power, by Victoria's predatory gaze.  
  
I swallowed hard, forcing a neutral expression onto my face.  
  
""It was nothing, Marcus. A false alarm.""  
  
My voice was quiet, devoid of emotion.  
  
I looked from his face to Victoria's triumphant smirk.  
  
The clarity was painful, absolute.  
  
I was a chess piece in their twisted game of love and power.  
  
My feelings, my hopes, my desperation to save my family's legacy - none of it mattered to them.  
  
I was just a means to an end.  
  
A profound sadness settled over me, cold and heavy.  
  
I would play my part, just a little longer.  
  
Then I would be free.  
  
  
Chapter 3  
Marcus paraded me around the gala, his hand firmly on my back.  
  
He'd laugh at something I said, his eyes crinkling, but I could see him watching Victoria from the corner of his eye.  
  
Each touch, each seemingly affectionate gesture, felt like a lie.  
  
I was numb, a doll going through the motions.  
  
My heart, which had once fluttered at his attention, was a cold, heavy stone in my ch\*st.  
  
He was so obviously trying to provoke Victoria, to show her he was desirable, that he had moved on.  
  
It was a pathetic, transparent display.  
  
I watched Victoria. She was a consummate actress.  
  
She feigned indifference, then subtle jealousy, then, finally, distress.  
  
She pressed her fingers to her temple, her brow furrowed prettily.  
  
""Oh, Marcus,"" she sighed, her voice just loud enough for him to hear over the din. ""This dreadful noise. My head is splitting.""  
  
It was a classic move.  
  
Marcus immediately dropped my arm.  
  
His focus shifted entirely to Victoria, his face etched with concern.  
  
""My dear, are you alright?""  
  
He guided her towards the exit, his arm securely around her waist.  
  
""I'll take you home,"" he murmured, all tenderness.  
  
He didn't even glance back at me.  
  
Abandoned again. The star of his show one moment, forgotten tr\*\*h the next.  
  
The confirmation was brutal. My role in his charade was complete.  
  
I felt a wave of dizziness, the earlier fever still lingering.  
  
The humiliation, the exhaustion, it was all too much.  
  
I slipped out of the gala unnoticed, a ghost leaving a party of illusions.  
  
Back in the sterile apartment Marcus provided, I began to purge.  
  
The designer clothes he'd bought me, still in their garment bags, went into a donation pile.  
  
The expensive trinkets, the books he'd ""thought I'd enjoy,"" the art prints he'd chosen - all of it.  
  
I kept only my own clothes, my laptop, my scripts, my father's camera.  
  
My life, stripped back to its essentials.  
  
It felt like cleansing a wound.  
  
As I packed, memories flickered.  
  
Marcus laughing as we watched an old movie at the Hayes Classic Cinema.  
  
His hand holding mine on that private jet, the city lights like scattered jewels below.  
  
The future I'd naively imagined with him - a partnership, shared dreams, love - dissolved like sm\*ke.  
  
It hurt, a dull, persistent ache.  
  
But underneath the pain, there was a flicker of something else.  
  
Relief.  
  
The truth, however ugly, was liberating.  
  
The sound of the front door opening made me jump.  
  
Marcus.  
  
And Victoria.  
  
He barely glanced at the piles of discarded luxury, his mind clearly elsewhere.  
  
""Amelia,"" he said, his tone businesslike. ""Victoria will be staying here for a while.""  
  
Not a request. A statement.  
  
My heart clenched. Staying \*here\*? In this apartment that was supposed to be my sanctuary, however temporary?  
  
Victoria swept past him, a triumphant glint in her eyes.  
  
She was moving in, staking her claim.  
  
The air crackled with her victory.  
  
I nodded, my voice surprisingly calm.  
  
""Of course, Marcus.""  
  
My compliance seemed to throw him for a moment. He frowned, as if expecting a fight, an argument.  
  
But Victoria was already issuing orders.  
  
""Darling, that dreadful painting in the living room simply has to go. And my things are arriving tomorrow, we'll need to clear out the guest closet.""  
  
Her voice was musical, but her eyes, when they met mine, were cold.  
  
Marcus, distracted, turned to her. ""Whatever you need, Victoria.""  
  
He was already hers again, dancing to her tune.  
  
I retreated to my small bedroom, a strange sense of detached relief washing over me.  
  
It didn't matter anymore.  
  
I would be gone soon.  
  
This gilded cage would no longer be my prison.  
  
Victoria wasted no time asserting her control.  
  
The apartment, once filled with Marcus's impersonal, expensive taste, began to transform.  
  
Her clothes filled the closets, her perfumes scented the air, her photographs appeared on tables.  
  
She directed staff, redecorated, made demands.  
  
Marcus catered to her every whim.  
  
He personally oversaw the removal of the ""dreadful painting.""  
  
He had her favorite flowers delivered daily.  
  
He even, I noticed with a pang, started stocking the specific brand of imported tea she preferred, the one he'd once told me was ""too fussy.""  
  
I watched it all with a strange detachment, like an anthropologist observing a foreign ritual.  
  
My personal touches, the few I'd dared to introduce, were quietly erased.  
  
My favorite mug disappeared from the kitchen. The stack of classic film theory books I'd left on the coffee table was replaced by fashion magazines.  
  
It didn't sting as much as I expected.  
  
It was just... confirmation.  
  
I was a ghost in their re-established world.  
  
My departure couldn't come soon enough.

1lgurth,https://www.reddit.com/r/ausjdocs/comments/1lgurth/intern_here_thinking_of_resigning/,"Intern here, thinking of resigning","Hello and welcome to my vent. I moved this year for internship to a regional hospital knowing not a single person within a 2 hour drive where I live alone (with my cat). I've made friends but nothing super meaningful. Culture is pretty good.

I just finished my 3rd week on this rotation, which also is my first ward-based rotation. It has been REALLY hard adapting. I feel like a brand new intern, except it's 6 months into internship so standards are higher. Unfortunately due to challenges in med school I felt wildly underprepared for ward-based internship. As a med student I had been to 1 MET call. I didn't even really know what a clinic review was until I started this rotation. I am trying really hard to learn and I definitely have improved.

Med school was pretty rough for me. 2/3rds of the way through 2nd year I got really unexpectedly really sick with a kinda cool niche thing that culminated in the first of many long hospital admissions. The treating team that i was mostly under were so phenomenal, not just medically but at EVERYTHING. I was determined to sit my 2nd year written exams/OSCEs, so they did everything they could to physically help me get there and by some miracle I actually did okay. I lost count of how many admissions I had across the next 4 or so years. Studying medicine was actually what kinda got me through it all. For 3 consecutive years I would enrol at uni, not be able to attend any placement because I was so physically unwell, but be studying on my laptop and watching all the lectures from my bed. I would then have to un-enroll because I couldn't pass without attending any placement (understandably).

Like I said, my main treating team was phenomenal. Several times a week a consultant or reg would drop in and ask me how my studying was going and sit down and give me a mini tute. One of the regs knew I loved coffee and knew my order and would buy me one from the cafe whenever he could.

I know this is kind of a VIP treatment and I'm not expecting myself to buy coffees for my patients. But I know what it feels like for a lot of their struggles and maybe empathise with the non-medical stuff too much. I want to spend the time with them they deserve like my drs did for me, but I stay late every single day trying to do the essentials and I know I need to go home and rest.

I feel like because of my physical health problems and also my personality that I might be unsuited to this profession. I am a very hyperactive, fidgety person and my time with patients is spent constantly trying to suppress all of this and not talk a 100miles a minute. Outside of the patient's room it comes bubbling up. I breathe a sigh of relief when the office is empty and I can wriggle my legs and click my pen so much that it breaks. I have always spoken really fast (even got speech therapy) and I know sometimes people just get so lost. I smile a lot, but I also have to have a quick cry in the toilets most days after any kind of little errors I make (even though I ask for feedback and try really hard to take it on board).

I've been to my supportive GP because I know that physically things also aren't great. I've lost 15% of my body weight in the past 3 months because it takes me like 3 hours to eat lunch, my alarm reminders for meds go off but if I'm with a patient I can't really stuff food in my mouth and pop some pills and then I forget. I know I need to prioritise my own health but I don't know what more to do with the demands of the job. I also have been getting like 2 hours sleep each night for the past month which is probably the biggest issue. I'm already linked in with an incredible psychologist that I'm now trying to see more frequently.

I feel like a failure, like I'm unsuited to this role and I'm just grinding for something that I won't reach my own expectations for. I've had some nice debriefs with regs and the intern supervisor, but obviously didn't go into my pmhx. I'm looking into the resignation process but I'm not about to submit it right now. I do have a wonderful 4 days off ahead of me to decompress, but I still only slept for 2 hours last night. Any help or hugs

More good stuff. I love food and cooking. I'm what the kids call a fatass. I don't think I have a favorite thing to make but as for eating I do enjoy a nice bacon cheeseburger. I do make a mean bowl of fruity pebbles. And I have a tendency to make waffles with ice coffee. 

I love music. Rock and metal. When I wanna get wild I whip out the Macarena or Barbie girl. 

I wish I had the ability to focus on reading. I miss it but I blame phones for making my ability to concentrate not exist. But I do have books I want to read. 

I'm down for swapping selfies and moving onto other platforms if things are cool. 

Bonus points if you like dancing queen. Medical problems - cause I do. Or would be up game on Xbox or ps5. And spamming me pet pics.

I am of Chinese heritage and I love tea, especially single origin and traditional gong fu tea, however, there is something quite magical about western style tea brewing that I've been drawn to lately. 

Recently, I have started exploring blending my own teas at home:

* Flavourings (bergamot, rose etc), food grade and suspended in PG, alcohol or glycerin. I will dilute these in high proof vodka and mist them lightly over the tea in a mixing bowl.
* Decorating them with dried flowers (e.g. cornflowers, osmanthus, rose and chrysanthemum petals), which contributes to aroma and visuals
* Adding in dried fruit rinds and peels for aesthetics
* Finally curing them initially with breathable containers for proper drying and then in tinplate caddies for them to balance and harmonise

Each blend becomes something personal and highly customised, for example:

* A festive blend inspired by mulled wine, black tea with orange and cinnamon flavourings, decorated with citrus rin

* A Strawberry infusion with rosehip, hibiscus and strawberry, great for cold brewing
* A Maghreb inspired mint tea: peppermint tisane blended with green tea

I find this method not only fun but also quite hands on, like crafting a perfume or cocktail. It makes tea more customisable and expressive, something I think could appeal to people who might otherwise gravitate toward coffee culture, with its emphasis on gear, ritual and experimentation.

So I'd love to ask:

* Do you think this kind of DIY, flavour and creative forward approach could sever as a more approachable or palatable gateway into tea culture?
* Could it help introduce people to the world of tea without replacing tradition or gong fu practices?
* Do any of you blend your own teas at home or have experience with similar methods?

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts, whether you are a purist or a fellow blender (or enjoyer), I'd love to exchange ideas and see what this community thinks?

I‚Äôve been hesitant to post, but I‚Äôm reaching a point where I feel like my nervous system is completely fried, and I‚Äôm wondering if anyone else has gone through something similar. I‚Äôm starting to suspect what I‚Äôm dealing with goes deeper than just generalized anxiety or depression ‚Äî it feels more like long-term HPA axis dysfunction or chronic stress burnout.

To give some background, I took Accutane in my late teens, and not long after that, around 19, I developed what I now understand was an anxiety disorder. I started smoking weed heavily, and also got really into intense exercise ‚Äî pushing my body hard with weights, cardio, and calisthenics. I think I was self-medicating without realizing it. For almost 20 years now, I‚Äôve lived in a constant state of internal pressure ‚Äî like I‚Äôve been stuck in fifth gear, even when I‚Äôm trying to rest. It‚Äôs this wired, overstimulated feeling that never fully goes away.

I‚Äôve tried different antidepressants over the years ‚Äî some helped a bit, some made things worse. I‚Äôm currently on Lexapro, which seemed to work okay for a while, but things have taken a turn. Sleep has become a huge issue. It started with early morning wake-ups around 4 or 5am, and then I began having long, vivid dreams that left me feeling totally unrested. Those seem to have eased up a bit, but now I‚Äôm waking sometimes sweating (early cortisol response?)

Physically, I‚Äôm dealing with a tight chest, shallow breathing, and stress-related sweating, sometimes from the most minor triggers. My digestion has also gone off ‚Äî tension in my gut, irregular appetite, bloating. Even my recovery from exercise is different now. I did a moderately intense calisthenics workout a couple days ago and I‚Äôm still sore. A few years ago, that would‚Äôve been nothing.

I guess I‚Äôm posting this to ask: 
has anyone here gone through something like this? A full-body kind of burnout or stress collapse that shows up as mental health issues and physical symptoms? I‚Äôm trying to support my recovery with good sleep habits, hydration, sunlight, clean eating, no alcohol, no weed, and only one cup of coffee a day ‚Äî but progress feels slow and fragile. I‚Äôd really appreciate hearing from anyone who‚Äôs been through this kind of long-term nervous system exhaustion, HPA dysfunction, or whatever this is. How did you get through it? What helped? I‚Äôm open to thoughts, experience, or just knowing I‚Äôm not the only one.

**Permanent magnets primer**

MP Materials‚Äô Fort Worth facility is where refined rare earth materials from its Mountain Pass mine in California are transformed into metals, alloys, and finished neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets.¬†

NdFeB magnets, or just neodymium magnets, are critical for electric vehicles, robots and wind turbines. One magnet manufacturer names their¬†[top 8 uses](https://www.stanfordmagnets.com/top-8-uses-for-neodymium-magnets.html): MRIs, magnotherapy, audio equipment, lifting large loads, permanent magnet motors, magnetic separation technology, microwave communication technology, and magnetization technology.

They are also used in defense applications. A paper titled ‚ÄòAmerica‚Äôs Dependence On and Need to Secure Its Supply of Permanent Magnets‚Äô by USAF Lieutenant Colonel Justin Davey states that ‚ÄúNeodymium and samarium‚Ä¶ have a disproportionate influence on all high technology businesses, especially the defense industry.

They combine with other elements (specifically iron, boron, and cobalt) to make exceptional permanent magnets. Samarium-cobalt (SmCo) magnets have the highest known resistance to demagnetization. This capability, meaning the magnet has higher coercivity, allows them to function in high-temperature environments without losing magnetic strength ‚Äî an essential attribute for most military applications.

Similarly, neodymiumiron-boron (NdFeB) magnets are incredibly strong ‚Äî the most powerful commercial magnet available. Compared to an equal mass of traditional ferrite magnet, an NdFeB magnet has over 10 times the magnetic energy product. Accordingly, a much smaller amount of magnet is required for any particular application. This attribute makes them ideal for miniaturization of motors, electronics, and electrical components.‚Äù

Samarium-cobalt magnets were first introduced in the 1970s. They are stronger than alnico or ceramic material and offer the best heat resistance of all the permanent magnet types, with the ability to withstand temperatures up to 300 degrees C. However, due to their higher cost, they are less popular than the most common rare earth magnet,¬†NdFeB. Samarium-cobalt magnets are highly resistant to rusting, but they are also brittle and may fracture when extreme heat causes them to expand.

Neodymium-iron-boron magnets have similar properties to their samarium-cobalt cousins, except they are less resistant to oxidation, needing a surface treatment, and can‚Äôt withstand such high temperatures. Because they pack such a high magnetic punch,¬†NdFeB¬†magnets can fit into compact spaces, such as electric motors and cordless tools.

Terbium and dysprosium are sometimes added to NdFeB magnets to allow them to tolerate even higher temperatures.

‚ÄúMiniature high-temperature resistant permanent magnets are a key factor in developing state-of-the-art military technology,‚Äù Lieutenant Colonel Davey‚Äôs paper continues. ‚ÄúThey pervade the equipment and function of all service branches, starting with commercial computer hard drives containing NdFeB magnets that sit on nearly every Department of Defense (DOD) employee‚Äôs desk.

‚ÄúPrecision-guided munitions depend on SmCo magnets as part of the motors that manipulate their flight control surfaces. Without these advanced tiny magnets, the motors in ‚Äúsmart bombs,‚Äù like the joint direct attack munition (JDAM), would require a hydraulic system that is more expensive and three times as large.

The generators that produce power for aircraft electrical systems also rely on samarium-cobalt magnets, as does the stealth technology used to mask the sound of helicopter rotor blades by generating white-noise concealment. Other permanent magnet applications include ‚Äújet engines and other aircraft components, electronic countermeasures, underwater mine detection, antimissile defense, range finding, and space-based satellite power and communications systems,‚Äù according to USGS.

The Army relies on REE magnets for the navigation systems in its M1A2 Abrams battle tank and the Navy is developing a similarly dependent electric drive to conserve fuel for its Arleigh Burke-class destroyers. The Air Force‚Äôs F-22 fighter uses miniaturized permanent magnet motors to run its tail fins and rudder.‚Äù

[According to the US Department of Defense](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3700059/dod-looks-to-establish-mine-to-magnet-supply-chain-for-rare-earth-materials/),¬†*Rare earth permanent magnets are not only essential components in a range of defense capabilities, including the F-35 Lightning II aircraft, Virginia and Columbia class submarines and unmanned aerial vehicles, but also a critical part of commercial applications in the United States. They are also used to generate electricity for electronic systems in aircraft and focus microwave energy in radar systems.*‚ÄØ¬†

*Since 2020, DOD has awarded more than $439 million to establish domestic rare earth element supply chains. This includes separating and refining rare earth elements mined in the U.S., as well as developing downstream stateside processes needed to convert those refined materials into metals and then magnets.*‚ÄØ¬†

*In addition to the F-35, Virginia and Columbia class submarines, magnets produced from rare earth elements are used in systems such as Tomahawk missiles, a variety of radar systems, Predator unmanned aerial vehicles, and the Joint Direct Attack Munition series of smart bombs. The F-35, for instance, requires more than 900 pounds of rare earth elements. Each Arleigh Burke DDG-51 destroyer requires 5,200 pounds, and a Virginia class submarine needs 9,200 pounds.*¬†¬†

Anti-ballistic missiles like Israel‚Äôs ‚ÄúIron Dome‚Äù use samarium-cobalt and neodymium magnets for various functions within the missile‚Äôs guidance and control systems. It was¬†[recently reported](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-and-us-exhausting-supplies-ballistic-missile-interceptors-source-says)¬†that Israel and the United States are using ballistic missile interceptors at a rapid clip after four days with Iran. There are even concerns that a direct US strike on Iran could lead to bigger Iranian retaliation against Israel that would drain the US‚Äôs global stockpile of missile interceptors to a ‚Äúhorrendous‚Äù level, one US official said.¬†

**Other military applications**

Rare earths are central to the whole spectrum of defense technologies that are vital to every military. Without them, countries would be unable to produce much of the military hardware and equipment required for national defense. In most case there are no substitutes. Moreover, switching from current suppliers (i.e. China) would cause major disruptions to supply chains. According to the US Government Accountability Office, it would take 15 years to overhaul the defence supply chain, meaning any changes to it need considerable lead time.

Apart from permanent magnets, of which the US military is an important buyer, other applications of rare earth elements include:

* Radar and sonar¬†used to prevent collisions, for surveillance and navigational aids. The Patriot Missile Air Defense System employs radio frequency circulators to magnetically control the flow of electronic signals in the radar and missiles. Rare earths required: gadolinium, samarium, yttrium.
* Communications and displays¬†required by soldiers, sailors and airmen to see analog and digital data. Examples are lasers that help line-of-sight communication links in satellite and ground-based systems; old and new computer monitors; and avionics terminals. Rare earths required: dysprosium, erbium, europium, neodymium, praseodymium, terbium and yttrium.
* Lasers¬†employed on vehicle-mounted systems like tanks and armored vehicles. They can identify enemy targets up to 22 miles. According to¬†[DefenseMediaNetwork](https://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/rare-earths-provide-critical-weapons-support/), ‚ÄúThe laser-equipped computer main gun sight on the Abrams M1A/2 tank combines a Raytheon rangefinder and integrated designator targeting system used to obtain a high-probability first hit.‚Äù Rare earths required: ¬†europium, neodymium, terbium and yttrium.
* Precision-guided munitions (PGMs)¬†take in a number of missile classes including cruise, anti-ship (ASM) and surface-to-air (SAM), as well as bunker busters. The heat-seeking AIM-9 Sidewinder missile has four fins on its fuselage that use rare-earth magnets to control its flight trajectory. Rare earths required: dysprosium, neodymium, praseodymium, samarium and terbium.
* Guidance and control systems¬†that steer missiles and bombs towards their targets. Rare earths required:¬†terbium, dysprosium, samarium, praseodymium and neodymium.
* Electronic warfare¬†refers to a range of equipment that includes high-capacity power sources, storage batteries and electronic jamming devices. Rare earths required: yttrium-iron-garnet.
* Jet engines.¬†The rare earth element erbium is added to vanadium to make it more malleable for use in vanadium-infused steel that goes into jet engines. While not specifically a rare earth element, the rare element rhenium is alloyed with molybdenum and tungsten. The F-22 Raptor and the F-35 Lightning II stealth fighter reportedly use 6% rhenium in their engines. The electrical systems in aircraft employ¬†samarium-cobalt permanent magnets to generate power.

**Not enough**

According to the US Geological Survey, MP Materials produces a rare earth concentrate that annually contributes around 15% of the rare earth minerals consumed each year.

MP Materials is focused on refining a compound of neodymium and praseodymium ‚Äî one of the most common materials used to make rare earth magnets ‚Äî as well as lanthanum and cerium. These elements are classified as ‚Äúlight rare earths.‚Äù

The US government clearly wants MP Materials to also produce heavy rare earths concentrates that it can use to make specialty magnets, especially samarium-cobalt magnets. The DoD awarded MP Materials a $35 million contract in 2022 to build a facility to process heavy REEs. A 2023¬†[article by National Defense Magazine](https://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2023/2/10/us-begins-forging-rare-earth-supply-chain)¬†says the heavy rare earths will be refined in a different building than the lights, and that the project is just getting started.

The article notes that heavy rare earths terbium and dysprosium are needed to make rare earth permanent magnets that can operate in high temperatures, while samarium is used to produce samarium-cobalt magnets found in aerospace and defense applications.

As I said earlier, I don‚Äôt see anything at the Independence facility in Texas to indicate that HREEs are being turned into magnets. Yet.

Rare earths expert¬†[Jack Lifton provides some perspective](https://investornews.com/market-opinion/rare-earths-magnets-and-missiles-unmasking-the-wests-military-metals-gap/)¬†on the US military‚Äôs rare earths gap. He starts with the observation that a permanent magnet production facility currently under construction in South Carolina would produce 2,000 tonnes annually, of which 1,200 tonnes is earmarked for current military demand.

But Lifton isn‚Äôt optimistic about the ability of US companies to develop this industry:

*The few U.S.-based companies vying to establish themselves as domestic sources of rare earth permanent magnets for private industry possess aspirations, not achievements. They lack the capacity to produce at scale, the technical experience to compete globally, and the balance sheets to operate without subsidy‚Ä¶*

[A good read with your Coffee....  ](https://preview.redd.it/89l48xfh998f1.png?width=320&format=png&auto=webp&s=27eef49e772f812df0dd7f44869a2f685eb3cf7d)

**Collectively, the U.S. and European consumer sectors represent a modest portion of global demand for rare earth permanent magnets‚Äîapproximately 40,000 tonnes annually spread across more than 30 nations. This figure amounts to just 10% of China‚Äôs installed production capacity. China itself consumes an estimated 80% of what it produces, underscoring both the scale and self-sufficiency of its domestic industry.**

**Can the rest of the world construct a rare earth permanent magnet industry capable of global cost-competitiveness with China? No. Can select non-Chinese firms develop limited-scale, financially sustainable magnet production capacity for strategic or niche markets? Possibly.**  
  
**Mark Smith, the former boss of Molycorp, which ran the Mountain Pass mine before it went bankrupt and was bought by MP Materials, says Western nations will take years to develop enough rare earth processing capacity to limit China‚Äôs dominance over them. The current CEO of NioCorp Developments is developing a new mine in Nebraska that could produce rare earth elements, but notes that even with approved mines, production would start in 2029 at the earliest.**

**No firm outside of China can yet produce significant quantities of the terbium, dysprosium or samarium limited by Beijing and necessary for magnets to endure high operating temperatures. (**[**Bloomberg**](https://www.mining.com/web/rare-earth-boss-sees-long-hard-process-to-loosen-chinas-grip/)**)**

Clyde Russell, a¬†[metals columnist with Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/china-us-trade-deal-kicks-rare-earths-can-down-road-2025-06-12/), thinks the US-China deal on rare earths will probably hurt both economies due to the high tariffs now in place (55% on Chinese imports, 10% on US imports). Moreover, Russell believes the deal does little to solve the underlying problem with rare earths, magnets and other refined metals such as lithium and cobalt, which are dominated by Chinese supply chains:

*At best, the agreement this week is a kick the can down the road type of deal, insofar as it prevents an immediate crisis in manufacturing in the United States but leaves open the possibility that Beijing will once again threaten supplies if there are problems between the two sides in the future.*

[The Guardian notes](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/11/trump-china-trade-deal)¬†that China has a stranglehold on the production and export of samarium, which, as explained above, is needed to make samarium-cobalt magnets used to withstand the intense temperatures in military-grade technology. Examples include guided missiles, satellite-guided smart bombs and fighter jets, but the Guardian says supplies of those weapons have been depleted through deliveries of missiles and other ordnances to Ukraine and Israel.

China controls 100% of world samarium supply. There is also no commercial production of dysprosium and terbium outside of China. High-performance NdFeB magnets require trace amounts of these rare earths to function at high temperatures.

[Stanford Magnets concurs](https://www.stanfordmagnets.com/usa-worried-about-chinas-restrictions-on-the-export-of-rare-earth-magnets.html)¬†that consumption of rare earths in the United States, including rare earth magnets, is highly dependent on China.¬†More than 90% of the world‚Äôs rare earth permanent magnet supply comes from China, and the United States also needs to import nearly 70% of rare earth magnets from China.¬†

*At present, the United States does not have enough R&D capabilities to manufacture rare earth permanent magnets.¬†For example, the United States does not have the ability to produce high-temperature and corrosion-resistant¬†samarium-cobalt rare earth permanent magnets, which can be used to make rare-earth permanent magnets for precision-guided missiles, smart bombs, and military aircraft. However, China has this technology.*

*At present, China‚Äôs rare earth processing capacity is five times the total rare earth processing capacity of other regions in the world.¬†This means that it will take at least a few years to build a processing plant that can match China‚Äôs rare earth production capacity.*

Remember, MP Materials‚Äô plant in Texas can produce 1,000 tonnes of neodymium magnets per year. China produces an annual 300,000t.

MP Materials and Lynas may have the capability of producing rare-earth materials that are necessary for making military-grade magnets, but the amounts are so small as to barely make a dent in China‚Äôs overwhelming global advantage.

A dated (2013) report indicated the US military needed about 1,000 tons of permanent magnets annually, but current demand is likely higher, with some estimates suggesting 3,000 tons ‚Äî about triple what MP Materials is currently capable of producing.

Lynas‚Äô Texas plant is scheduled to start up next year but again the amounts are small.¬†[According to Fastmarkets](https://www.fastmarkets.com/insights/lynas-to-produce-dysprosium-terbium-oxide-in-malaysia/#:~:text=Start%2Dup%20of%20the%20plant,per%20kg%20on%20June%2020.), Lynas‚Äôs facility will have estimated production capacity of 1,000-1,300 tonnes per year of light rare earth NdPr oxide, and 2,500-3,000 tpy of heavy rare earth oxides.

The company announced a year ago it plans to start producing separated heavy rare earth products at its light rare earth‚Äôs refinery in Kuantan, Malaysia. The estimated throughput capacity is 1,500 tonnes per year of a mixed heavy rare earth compound called SEGH (samarium, europium, gadolinium, holmium).

The US Department of Defense recognizes the problem and has spent $439 million since 2020 in contracts to establish domestic rare earth supply chains. Yet according to a 2024 report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), ‚ÄúCritical materials such as rare earths, are materials needed to supply U.S. military, industry, and essential civilian needs during a national emergency and are not found or produced in sufficient quantities in the U.S. Rare earths and certain other critical materials, such as tantalum and tungsten, are overwhelmingly mined and processed abroad, making the U.S. reliant on foreign suppliers ‚Äî particularly China.‚Äù¬†

The GAO also pointed out, ‚ÄúAlthough the U.S. has some domestic resources and mining capability for rare earths, United States Geological Survey (USGS) identified in its¬†*2024 Mineral Commodity Summaries*¬†report that the U.S. imported more than 95 percent of the total rare earths that it consumed. USGS‚Äôs report also noted that, from 2019 through 2022, most of the total rare earths imported into the U.S. came from China, leaving DoD weapon systems vulnerable to supply chain disruptions by an adversarial nation.‚Äù¬†¬†([Cipher Brief](https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column_article/the-pentagons-rare-earth-problem-is-a-china-problem-too#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20proposal%2C%20the,thecipherbrief.com%20for%20publication%20consideration.))

A last¬†[opinion by New Security Beat](https://www.newsecuritybeat.org/2024/08/mine-the-tech-gap-why-chinas-rare-earth-dominance-persists/#:~:text=The%20two%20biggest%20rare%20earth%20mining%20companies,indigenize%20)¬†notes that¬†*China built an entire ecosystem around the rare earths, from mineral production and processing to manufacturing finished products, and most importantly, rare earth magnets.*¬†

The country has an effective monopoly over processing heavy rare earths dysprosium and terbium, and light rare earths neodymium and praseodymium.

*China has mastered this process, while Western companies lack the*¬†[*expertise*](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-u-s-wants-a-rare-earths-supply-chain-heres-why-it-wont-come-easily-dfc3b632)¬†*to achieve similar results.¬†The two biggest rare earth mining companies outside of China, MP Materials and Lynas, have*¬†[*struggled*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/world-battles-loosen-chinas-grip-vital-rare-earths-clean-energy-transition-2023-08-02/)¬†*to expand refining capacity despite huge US government investments.*

**Conclusion**

Let‚Äôs go back to something Jack Lifton, the rare earths expert, wrote:

*Collectively, the U.S. and European consumer sectors represent a modest portion of global demand for rare earth permanent magnets‚Äîapproximately 40,000 tonnes annually spread across more than 30 nations. This figure amounts to just 10% of China‚Äôs installed production capacity. China itself consumes an estimated 80% of what it produces, underscoring both the scale and self-sufficiency of its domestic industry.*

Note: these civilian-use magnets are made from light rare earths.

Samarium, terbium and dysprosium, the heavy rare earths required to build military-grade, temperature-resistant magnets, are still not commercially available outside China.

MP Materials is the only non-Chinese company currently able to complete the rare earths supply chain loop ‚Äî from mining to separation/ refining to making the metal used to make permanent magnets. But MP only has the capacity to make 1,000 tonnes of neodymium magnets per year, against China‚Äôs 300,000 tpy.

The US military requires about 3,000 tons of permanent magnets a year. MP is clearly not producing enough heavy rare earths elements to meet the US military‚Äôs needs. The actual amount of HREEs required is likely classified, but in a best-case scenario, MP will make 1,000 tonnes of neodymium magnets a year ‚Äî some of which will have a military use, but many will not because they lack the addition of dysprosium and terbium needed to make the magnets high temperature-resistant.

Granted, MP Materials is working on expanding its processing capabilities, including a heavy rare earth separation facility in Texas, but it still faces challenges in scaling up production to meet the military‚Äôs requirements.¬†

When Lynas‚Äôs plant come online next year it could make 1,000-1,300 tonnes per year of light rare earth NdPr oxide, and 2,500-3,000 tpy of heavy rare earth oxides. But there is nothing to indicate that Lynas‚Äôs facility will make permanent magnets. What will Lynas do with the oxides it refines? They will likely be shipped to China for turning into military and civilian-use rare earths magnets.

The bottom line? America‚Äôs efforts to wrench control of the rare earths supply chain have so far failed despite the expenditure of nearly half a billion US dollars. In a way this is no surprise. China has had a multi-decade lead over the US rare earths mining, refining and permanent magnet manufacturing.

In another way it‚Äôs no different from the crisis America is facing regarding its lack of graphite production. Graphite is a necessary component of lithium-ion batteries; it‚Äôs used in the anode.

A¬†[report last year from the Hague Centre for Strategic Studies](https://hcss.nl/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Strategic-Raw-Materials-for-Defence-HCSS-2023-2.pdf)¬†found that¬†*natural graphite and aluminium are the materials most commonly used across military applications¬†and are also subject to considerable supply security risks that stem from the lack of suppliers‚Äô diversification and the instability associated with supplying countries.*

The report assessed the degree of criticality for each of 40 materials deemed critical or soon to be critical. Natural graphite was rated ‚Äúvery high-risk‚Äù for air applications, and ‚Äúhigh-risk‚Äù for sea applications.

In the table below, natural graphite is rated red, very high risk, for its use in fighter aircraft, main battle tanks, submarines, corvettes, artillery and ammunition. Aluminum, used in fighters, tanks, missiles, submarines, corvettes, artillery, ammunition and torpedo‚Äôs, was also rated a very high-risk material.

[Source: Hague Centre for Strategic Studies](https://preview.redd.it/a0r2lh0t898f1.png?width=973&format=png&auto=webp&s=9cf5791ce0e18155623c7cc83bb85636f807ef8f)

The report says aluminum and natural graphite¬†*are the two most used materials in the defence industry and can be found in aircrafts (fighter, transport, maritime patrol, and unmanned), helicopters (combat and multi-role), aircraft and helicopter carriers, amphibious assault ships, corvettes, offshore patrol vessels, frigates, submarines, tanks, infantry fighter vehicles, artillery, and missiles. These materials are used in components such as airframe and propulsion systems of helicopters and aircrafts as well as onboard electronics of aircraft carriers, corvettes, submarines, tanks, and infantry fighter vehicles. The impact of supply security disruption would hence be very significant, given the multiplicity of aluminum and natural graphite‚Äôs applications.*

In the fighter plane graphic below, notice the use of natural graphite (red dots) in almost every part of the plane, including the body, wings, tail, nose, nozzle, propulsion system, landing gear, electro-optical systems, and sensors and electronic systems.

According to the report, the most used of the 40 materials across the air domain are aluminum, natural graphite, copper and titanium:

*These materials have several applications in aeronautics. In aircrafts (fighter, transport, maritime patrol, and unmanned) and helicopters (combat and multi-role), aluminium, natural graphite, and titanium find their main application in the airframe, where they are used in the body, wings, tail, nose, and axis of the aircraft. They are also employed in the production of propulsion systems‚Äô components such as combustors, nozzle, drive shaft, and propellers, as well as in landing gears, connectors, and electronic systems.*

A second graphic of a tank shows natural graphite in the inertial navigation system, combat identification equipment, and coaxial machine gun.

According to the report,¬†*For the construction of tank guns, Howitzer machine guns in infantry fighter vehicles, and GPS/SAL guidance systems in ammunition, natural graphite is found in combination with other materials to construct these components.*

[Source: Hague Centre for Strategic Studies](https://preview.redd.it/4brzamoz898f1.png?width=989&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb252b9176324d863600da5aa2a19040f7ec354)

China is by far the biggest graphite producer at about 80% of global production. It also controls almost all graphite processing, establishing itself as a dominant player in every stage of the supply chain.

Deficits are expected to kick in by 2025 as new graphite mines fail to keep up with surging demand from automakers. According to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, as many as 97 average-sized graphite mines need to come online by 2035 to meet global demand. That‚Äôs about eight new mines a year, which at first may seem doable but considering the number of graphite projects worldwide and the time it takes to develop them into mines, we‚Äôre really up against it.

The US is heavily reliant on imports for graphite. In 2024, the US imported 60,000 tonnes of natural graphite, with 87.7% being flake and high purity.¬†

The US military could not function without graphite and the US currently does not produce any graphite from domestic mines.

Aluminum, also crucial for military equipment, is fast becoming a problem to source. Earlier this month, the Trump administration doubled tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50%. The tariffs make it more difficult for American firms to buy imported aluminum that is turned into US military equipment.

Only one US mine, Mountain Pass in California, mines and processes rare earth elements. But most of what Mountain Pass produces are light rare earths ‚Äî easier to process than heavies but not as valuable to the US military. The United States currently imports nearly all its military-grade samarium-cobalt magnets from China, a fact that I don‚Äôt see changing any time soon.

Despite the US-China rare earths agreement, despite what MP Materials is doing, despite what Lynas is doing, and despite more handouts from the Department of Defense, China is still hamstringing the US military. We could soon feel the effects of China‚Äôs rare earth restrictions on F-35 inventories, and on depleted US and Israeli anti-ballistic missiles. The automobile industry is shutting down production lines because it can‚Äôt get the rare earths. China makes the specialty magnets required, and it‚Äôs unwilling to share them.

In a 2024¬†[column in Real Clear Energy](https://www.realclearenergy.org/articles/2024/02/27/dwindling_us_stockpiles_of_minerals_for_military_use_should_be_a_cause_for_concern_1014693.html), Eastern New Mexico University professor Jim*Constantopoulos writes that, should a conflict escalate into a war, the US would have shortfalls in 69 minerals, most of them used in weapons production.*

*In a world that is getting more dangerous by the day, with missiles being flung between Israel and Iran, and war still raging between Russia and Ukraine, that is one scary thought.*



# FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS & CONCLUSIONS ABOVE:

# Given shared responses from Jim Sims yesterday June 19th, 2025.

**Morning Jim...**

***Not sure if this is possible but ""AI"" makes this look good!¬† As you did say ""Other Sources"" might be in play?***¬† ¬†

***Gotta ask while we wait for material news...***

¬†***1) Could NioCorp's proprietary new process with SX beneficiation be utilized OR licensed to separate additional sources of ""Concentrate"" from other sources in the future?¬† (At the Elk Creek site or potential Satellite separation site?)***

***RESPONSE:***

""The hydrometallurgical process we intend to employ at Elk Creek should allow us to introduce rare earth concentrate from other operations, although there would be limitations on that.¬†

***a)***¬†***For one, the mineralization of the concentrate matters:¬† we would not likely accept silicate-based minerals, such as eudialyte (Tanbreez), given that such minerals would not be compatible with our process.¬† At present, we are unaware of any commercially viable process to extract rare earths from silicate-based minerals.***

***b) There are also other limitations to consider, such as the level of naturally occurring radioactive elements that can accompany some concentrates.***¬†

***That said, introducing additional rare earth concentrates from external sources could potentially enable us to expand our production of individual rare earth products.¬† We have also shown at bench scale that we should be able to feed post-consumer NdFeB magnets into our process as well.***¬†

At some point, adding more feedstock into our system would require expansion of currently planned solvent extraction circuits, which would impact both CAPEX and OPEX.¬†¬†***So, at present, we envision such a potential expansion would make sense once we complete financing and get the project as currently designed constructed and into operation and then examine the technical and economic feasibility of introducing additional feedstock streams.***

All the best,

Jim Sims""

My last company had me covering 26 states. I was remote from the office. I was doing 40+% travel. I did it for 8 years. The first 5ish was pre-Covid and it was fun. Make a couple of appointments, plan the trip, then fill in the in between time with last minute meetings or drop ins. Ate out every night. 

Then Covid hit. Company restricted travel for 5 months. Once we were able to get back on the road, it was completely different. People were remote, doors were locked, things needed to be scheduled in advance and only for ""needs"" vs my wants. In a 3 day trip, I'd go from 3 scheduled meetings and 3 or 4 last minute/drop ins to 1 meeting. Maaaaaybe 2. Things would be canceled last minute, regardless of I had flown in for that specific meeting. Takeout only for dinner. 

Then, I got recruited into my current company, same industry/role, still remote.  Much smaller territory but more money and volume of sales. It went from 3 day trip to see 1 customer to an hour drive. It went from 50+ hotel stays a year to 5 or 6. Most of my stays are within a 2 hour drive and usually because someone else (management) is in town or a conference/trade show, plus the occasional trip to the office. 

I thought I would miss the ""thrill"" of the travel adventure. New cities, states, rentals etc. You get the idea. Guess what? I don't. At all. Looking back, I can't believe I did it for 8 years. 

This week, there is a conference at my nearby city (45 min drive depending on traffic). Originally I was going to just drive in but the restricted the number of people from my company going (after things were booked/hotels reserved) so I decided to take over one of the rooms and am now staying over for the 2 nights. This is what my travel is now, 2 nights in a hotel 45 minutes from my house. ",7,1750504764.0,sales,14,1.0,False

Yeah, I know. I have no idea what he's going through at the moment but I'm definitely not doing this for attention. I just need to get this of my chest because I have no one else to tell this too. 

3 days ago I was posted about how MIL want to name baby after SIL. And the day of the post we found out how badly SIL is actually doing. Since then fiance has been using me as a punching bag. He'd go off on me at the most random of times for the most random of things. This morning he was making coffee for himself and apparently the way I organised the coffee and teas and sugar pissed him off and he said I should ""stop being so fucking OCD"" then proceeded to mess up my cans. Even putting some of my tea in the same containers as others. I don't have OCD I just like my things placed neatly were I can easily find them. It's been like this since Wednesday. 

Our first obgyn appointment is this coming week. He's going to fly 2 days after the appointment to his sister. (Not enough money for both of us to go if anyone is wondering). When I asked him if he's still willing to go, because I totally get it if hes not up too it. ( Those words exactly) He said and I quote ""how can I fucking care about anything other than my sister now.""  I hate how he's being. He plays pc games with his friends and he's not nearly such an ass to them like he is with me. 

I've been thinking about getting the abortion to eliminate a stressor for him. By my calculations baby will be born next year Jan. I'm praying SIL will still be here by then but as things are looking I'm not as positive as I was 3 days ago. I was on anti depressants for a bit in high school and I'm very afraid that I'll get PPD after baby gets here. That, with maybe his sisters passing. I don't see how he will be able to handle all this mental load. I am worried about him. I'm worried about my mental health as well. 

This baby just feels like bad timing. It's something that's so desperately wanted and with me having PCOS we started saving for IVF thinking that's going to be our way. But I don't think it's something that should happen now. Idk. I'm just so stressed about everything. I don't want to do this pregnancy alone. And as it seems I don't think fiance will really be present with me. 

I hate this. I feel like him only thinking about my needs and I hate how I feel alone in this while he must be going through so much worse. ",76,1750503909.0,TrueOffMyChest,48,0.92,False

We're playing it cool, and months go by before the ice finally breaks. We meet up for coffee, and I'm feeling nervous. A little anxious. That's fair, I think. Right out the gate, she tells me she's in an open relationship, and I'm the first... idk... ""extracurricular"" dude she's attempted at being with. My last relationship was 'open', so I thought, ""OH! This is easy! Right in my wheelhouse"".

I couldn't be more wrong. I'm the extra wheel, now. I never knew what it felt like to be the spare tire until now. So... tonight, just a couple hours ago, I had my head on her lap as she was running her fingers through my hair, and life felt perfect. It came to an abrupt end because she has a life to live without me. And, thats what I signed up for. I'm only there when its convenient. Outside of that, tough shit. I'm an idiot. I know. But, I suppose pain is the price to pay for experience. But, God damn... the fact that I can still smell her on me now kinda makes it all worthwhile :)

The crystal chandelier at the entryway refracted blades of light sharp enough to kill me.

My hand trembled around my phone. My nails dug deep into my palm, the taste of blood spreading between my teeth.

It was our one-year wedding anniversary. The champagne bucket that should‚Äôve been chilling a bottle was still sitting in the foyer cabinet‚Äînow filled with nothing but ice-cold dread.

Beneath Verona‚Äôs glittering surface, the Feron mafia family‚Äôs underworld churned quietly.

I‚Äôd been married into the Feron mafia family for three years. I knew this family, which ran underground casinos and a smuggling empire, was soaked in danger. Even the air carried a threat.

And Vincent‚Äîmy husband, the smooth-talking heir who always wore his suits like armor and held court at family parties‚Äîwas currently grinding all his charm into another woman‚Äôs body.

Shreds of gift wrap littered the Persian rug in the living room‚Äîthe tie set I‚Äôd picked out with care this morning, now torn apart.

From the crack beneath the bedroom door upstairs came breathy, skin-flushing moans, tangled with wet kisses and the clink of leather restraints.

‚ÄúBaby, I‚Äôm already divorced‚Ä¶‚Äù the woman whimpered between gasps, cloth tearing audibly. ‚ÄúTie me up with that tie... just like the first time... fuck me hard, make me come!‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, you filthy little slut! Stick your ass up higher!‚Äù

The bed slammed harder against the wall. Her whimpering cries mixed with his low grunts, pounding in my skull like a migraine.

I never imagined this would be how I found out‚Äîon our anniversary‚Äîthat my husband was cheating on me.

No... maybe he‚Äôd been cheating all along. I was just too blind to see it.

After all, I was supposed to be on a flight to Minch right now.

But after debating it all night, I‚Äôd canceled the trip last minute. I‚Äôd ordered flowers, a cake, and a bottle of red wine to surprise him instead.

Well. Surprise, indeed.

Then I heard Vincent moaning back at her: ‚ÄúDivorced... ah‚Äîfuck! Your pussy‚Äôs so tight! Shit, I‚Äôm gonna wreck you with this dick. Don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs only a matter of time.‚Äù

That voice‚Äîthose filthy words‚ÄîI‚Äôd once heard whispering love to me during countless sleepless nights. Now they stabbed through my chest like poison-tipped knives.

I thought of last week, when he came home late. There‚Äôd been an unfamiliar lipstick stain on his collar. He just laughed and said he brushed up against someone at the party.

I‚Äôd seen that woman before. She worked at his company‚Äîhis boss.

Vincent had even mentioned that if he wanted a promotion, he had to butter her up.

So this was what ‚Äúbuttering up‚Äù meant? Trading his body for a raise?

I felt sick. I bit down on my lip so hard it nearly split, forcing myself to stay silent‚Äîfighting the urge to barge in and scream.

Logic held me back. I didn‚Äôt drop the flowers or cake. Instead, I pulled out my phone, opened the camera, and snapped a photo of what was happening inside.

The image shook in my trembling hands‚Äîtwo bodies tangled in silk sheets. She was on all fours. Vincent was riding her from behind. And his familiar cock was thrusting into her like a piston.

*Vincent, you son of a b\*tch.*

‚Ä¶

I stormed out the apartment door, dumped the flowers and cake into the trash, and flagged down a cab.

Just as I reached for the door, my phone started to ring in my pocket.

I ignored it and slid into the back seat, but the screen kept flashing nonstop‚Äîrelentless.

Annoyed, I finally picked up.

A familiar voice screamed through the speaker‚Äîhis mother.

‚ÄúLuna! What the hell is wrong with you? I went out of my way to book you an appointment with the best fertility specialist in the city, and you blew her off! And now you won‚Äôt even answer my calls? If you don‚Äôt want to give the Feron mafia family a child, then get the hell out! Divorce Vincent already! There are plenty of women out there dying to carry my son‚Äôs baby!‚Äù

I stared out the window, remembering our wedding day‚Äîhow she grabbed my chin right after the ceremony and sneered, ‚ÄúGirls from the slums should know their place.‚Äù

I tightened my grip on the phone and answered her word for word.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. I‚Äôll divorce him. You don‚Äôt need to push me. You want a grandson? Fine. I‚Äôll have one.‚Äù

But it won‚Äôt be Vincent‚Äôs.

I didn‚Äôt say that part out loud. It burned in my chest like a bloody vow.

‚ÄúSir, take me to the Leisure Palace,‚Äù I told the cab driver, catching his wary glance in the rearview mirror.

That place was the most decadent hellhole the Feron mafia family owned‚Äîthree floors underground, hiding their money laundering ledgers and weapons trade records.

And I was going there to find a man who‚Äôd humiliate Vincent for life.

**Chapter 2 She Came to Cheat‚Ä¶ With Me?**

Silas Feron's POV:

Dim red light spilled across the marble floors of Leisure Palace.

This place was the Feron mafia family‚Äôs central hub for money laundering and intelligence trading. But on the surface, I‚Äôd turned it into a legitimate entertainment venue‚Äîeven the cops couldn‚Äôt find a single crack in the foundation.

I stood in the VIP section with a glass of whiskey in hand, listening to my men report on recent arms smuggling activity. The updates weren‚Äôt great.

I tipped the glass back, draining the whiskey in one go. As my assistant lowered his voice, I started wondering if it was time to shift to a more profitable cargo.

*Drugs, maybe‚Ä¶*

I frowned, tracing the rim of my glass with a finger. Back when the old man was still alive, drugs were off-limits. That had been his bottom line.

Suddenly, a staggering figure entered my line of sight.

A woman in ten-inch heels moved like a blooming red rose, swaying with every step.

Her bronze skin shimmered under the neon, glowing like warm honey. The satin gown clung to her hourglass figure‚Äîher full chest nearly spilling out of the plunging neckline. Her narrow waist and round hips formed a dramatic curve, and her toned thighs flashed between the high slit of her skirt.

She weaved through the dance floor unsteadily, her hair catching the flickering lights.

Every man she passed instinctively swallowed hard, eyes glued to her back. But she seemed oblivious, walking straight toward me.

‚ÄúUgh‚Ä¶ so dizzy‚Ä¶‚Äù Her voice trembled deliberately, playing weak. I could tell right away she was trying to seduce me.

Before I could react, her soft, warm body fell against mine. The men around me looked visibly shocked‚Äîsome were even ready to throw her out for crossing the line.

I shot them a look.¬†*Back off.*

Her waist was slim and pliable. I held her instinctively. The scent of whiskey on my breath mixed with the faint fragrance of roses from her body, rushing up my nose.

I wasn‚Äôt the type to indulge often. I only sought out a virgin once a month to satisfy my physical needs.

I‚Äôd already had my fix this month. Normally, I wouldn‚Äôt feel a thing toward another woman. But the second her scent hit me, my mind flashed with images of bending her over and fucking her senseless.

That was the only reason I didn‚Äôt push her away immediately.

She‚Äôd successfully triggered my primal urge.

‚ÄúYou smell‚Ä¶ incredible,‚Äù she murmured, tilting her head up. Under the red neon, I caught the flush at the corners of her eyes.¬†*I bet if I really railed her, her whole face would turn crimson.*

But then I realized‚Äîthis face looked familiar. I‚Äôd seen her before, probably at one of the family banquets.

She was likely one of ours‚Ä¶ and I didn‚Äôt mess around with women from inside the mafia family. Not worth the trouble.

‚ÄúMiss, I suggest you show some self-respect.‚Äù My voice turned cold as I tried to push her off me.

Her eyes went wide, the color draining from her face. It took her a moment before she parted those plush, sultry lips.

*If I shoved my cock into that mouth‚Ä¶ it‚Äôd probably feel amazing‚Ä¶*

Then she whispered, disbelief lacing her tone, ‚ÄúSilas?‚Äù

I raised an eyebrow. That‚Äôs when it hit me‚ÄîVincent‚Äôs barely-there wife.

I‚Äôd heard the rumors: Vincent was screwing his boss now. And it looked like his wife was bold enough to play the same game.

She stammered out an apology. I let go of her and turned to leave. Stuff like this happened every day around here. I just never expected Vincent‚Äôs wife to be one of the players.

*Interesting.*

She suddenly called after me, voice trembling with tears. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm having a bad day. Had too much to drink. You‚Äôre really just gonna leave me in a place like this? It‚Äôs not safe.‚Äù

I turned back. She was pretending to twist her ankle, pale fingers clutching her skirt. Her cleavage was in full view.

A few curious glances had already landed on us. Some rival family spies were watching with interest.

Clever girl. She knew no one would dare lay a finger on someone in my orbit here.

If she wanted to use me, fine. I was curious to see what kind of game she thought she could play.

‚ÄúYour foot hurts?‚Äù I leaned in, watching her pupils contract with tension. ‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll take you somewhere safe.‚Äù

With that, I picked her up.

She gasped, arms looping around my neck on reflex. The air filled with a chorus of shocked murmurs. I carried her through the club, feeling how stiff her body was in my arms.

Anyone scheming against the Feron mafia family was probably already trying to figure out who this woman was.

The bulletproof black SUV rolled smoothly toward the Intercontinental Hotel. In the back seat, she was still in a daze.

I glanced at her hand clutching the hem of her dress, knuckles pale.

*She‚Äôs starting to realize this little move might drag her into something way deeper than she expected.*

But that‚Äôs fine.

In Verona‚Äôs underworld, once you step onto my turf, you don‚Äôt walk away clean.

**Chapter 3 Happy With What You See?**

Luna Feron's POV:

Oh my god. I actually hooked up with Silas‚Äîthe real power behind the Feron mafia family.

When Silas carried me out of the Leisure Palace, I could feel every eye on us. Gasps rippled through the crowd, followed by hushed whispers.

I knew what this meant. The Feron mafia family‚Äôs top dog was walking out with a woman in his arms‚Äîand that woman had just become the juiciest rumor in all of Verona‚Äôs underworld.

The spies hiding in the shadows were probably already reporting back to their bosses: Vincent‚Äôs wife seduced his cousin.

The thought made me want to die on the spot. No, no, no‚Äîknowing Silas, he‚Äôd never let a scandal like that leak beyond the Leisure Palace. He‚Äôd take care of it. He had to, right?

It wasn‚Äôt until I was laid down in the backseat of the car that I finally came to my senses. I opened my mouth to speak, but Silas had already told the driver, ‚ÄúThe Continental Hotel.‚Äù

His voice carried a kind of unquestionable authority that made my throat tighten. He sat beside me, one hand resting casually on his thigh‚Äîthose long, clean-cut fingers. I couldn‚Äôt help thinking about the rumors: that these were the same hands that took care of traitors in the family without blinking.

And now I was starting to panic.¬†*What if Silas is some devout traditionalist? What if seducing him means‚Ä¶ he‚Äôll kill me to keep things quiet?*

But who takes someone to a five-star hotel just to kill them?

*What if he plans to sleep with me first, then kill me?*

The alcohol was wearing off fast. My fight-or-flight instincts kicked in.

Still, under Silas‚Äôs watchful eyes, I had no choice but to follow him into the penthouse suite at the top of the Continental Hotel.

As soon as the door shut, Silas grabbed me, slammed me against the wall, and kissed me hard. His right hand yanked up my dress, slipped into my thong, and teased my clit.

The jolt of pleasure shot straight to my brain. That‚Äôs when it finally hit me‚Äî

*I‚Ä¶ I actually pulled it off. I seduced Silas. He brought me to a hotel.*

This felt way easier than I thought it‚Äôd be.

*Is this a trap?*

But I didn‚Äôt have time to think it through.

Every time I remembered Vincent ramming that woman from behind‚Äîhis boss‚ÄîI felt nothing but hatred. Add the alcohol to that, and I wasn‚Äôt scared of what came next. I was actually looking forward to it.

Silas was hot. Way too hot. And the way he touched me‚Äîthis man clearly had a lot of experience in bed.

Not to mention‚Ä¶ he was Vincent‚Äôs cousin.

*This is the perfect revenge.*

‚ÄúGo shower,‚Äù I said suddenly, a thought flashing through my mind.

I wasn‚Äôt about to sleep with him right away. I had something I needed to take care of first.

Silas‚Äôs eyes darkened, but then he let out a low chuckle. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back to satisfy you in a minute.‚Äù

With that, he headed to the bathroom‚Äîno sign of concern that I might run.

*Maybe he actually wants me to leave while he‚Äôs showering?*

I quickly grabbed my purse and dug through it. I needed to take my medication before he came back out.

Back in college, I had a boyfriend. I didn‚Äôt realize what kind of monster he was until I refused to sleep with him‚Äîand he tried to rape me.

I fought him off with everything I had. He didn‚Äôt succeed, but after that, I developed a serious aversion to physical intimacy. Even the thought of sex made me nauseous.

After I married Vincent, I tried to work through it. But every time things got physical, I‚Äôd feel sick. Vincent always told me it was fine and eventually started sleeping in the guest room.

The nicer he was, the more guilty I felt.

I‚Äôd even asked a friend overseas to help me buy some medication for my condition. I planned to try again on our one-year anniversary.

Instead, Vincent gave me the world‚Äôs most disgusting ‚Äúsurprise.‚Äù

I turned my purse inside out‚Äînothing. That‚Äôs when I remembered: I‚Äôd switched bags before I left the house. The meds were in the other one.

Suddenly, the bathroom door swung open. Silas walked out.

I stared straight at him, swallowing hard. I could feel myself getting wet.

He was a fucking god. His body looked like it belonged on a muscle magazine cover.

Under the lights, his skin had a faint glow of heat.

He scrubbed a towel through his hair and started walking toward me, one step at a time.

‚ÄúStill happy with what you see?‚Äù he asked, his voice low.

‚ÄúY-yeah‚Ä¶ very.‚Äù

I was swimming in his masculine scent, head spinning.

But then I blinked and snapped back to my senses. ‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶ I need to step out for a minute. I need to buy something.‚Äù

The last thing I wanted was to puke all over him mid-act.

*I have to do this. I need to sleep with Silas at least once. He‚Äôs too damn perfect. If I miss this chance, it‚Äôll be my loss.*

**Chapter 4 Goodbye, Uncle**

Silas Feron's POV:

The way she panicked and pushed me away reminded me of a kitten I used to have that scratched me when it got scared.

I‚Äôd already finished showering, and she was still in the room. That made her my prey now‚Äîand I had no intention of letting her leave my sight.

Tonight, I was going to fuck her until the corners of her eyes turned red‚Äîuntil she cried for me.

I glanced toward the nightstand to remind her: the hotel had condoms neatly arranged in various styles.

The Continental Hotel, after all, was one of the Feron mafia family‚Äôs crown jewels. Every detail of the guest experience was taken care of.

She looked a little surprised. Didn‚Äôt seem like the type to frequent a place like this.

‚ÄúI-I‚Äôm gonna take a shower,‚Äù she stammered. I could hear the tremble in her voice. Her wide eyes looked like a startled fawn‚Äôs.

I stared calmly at the tips of her ears as they turned pink and smirked. ‚ÄúYou should‚Äôve just showered with me. I could‚Äôve taken you in the bathroom.‚Äù

Her ears flushed even redder. That was cute.

She‚Äôd clearly thrown herself into my arms on purpose. Every move calculated. But now, when it came down to actual sex, she was acting like a blushing virgin.

Strange. You‚Äôd think that now we were alone, she‚Äôd keep pushing the seduction. But instead, she was flustered‚Äînervous, even afraid.

When she came out of the shower, wrapped in a towel, I was already hard. I‚Äôd wanted to fuck her back at the Leisure Palace.

She was beautiful. Her figure was insanely tempting. And most importantly, her scent didn‚Äôt put me off.

‚ÄúCome here.‚Äù My voice came out rough, almost hoarse. My desire was boiling over‚Ä¶

‚ÄúDammit‚Ä¶ You b\*tch. You really dared to seduce me, huh?‚Äù She whimpered beneath me, her pussy wet and warm. I pounded into her. I knew how to make a woman come. One hand gripped her throat while I drove deep into her.

‚ÄúOh‚Äîno, Silas! I‚Äôm gonna die!‚Äù Her legs locked around my waist. I got what I wanted‚Äîher crying beneath me, her eyes red and watery.

For once, I left the lights on. I wanted to see her‚Äîwanted to watch her fall apart under me. Wanted to see the way her whole body flushed when she came.

She was like a drug, addicting, pulling me into endless thrusts, slamming into her over and over again.

Every now and then, I‚Äôd slow down, just to tease her. She‚Äôd look back at me like a lost deer, craving more.

‚ÄúBeg for it.‚Äù I kept my rhythm slow, my hand tight around her throat.

‚ÄúPlease‚Ä¶‚Äù she murmured. But it wasn‚Äôt enough. A proper little slut should beg better than that. So I slowed even more.

‚ÄúNot good enough,‚Äù I teased. Then I motioned for her to turn around‚Äîget on her hands and knees.

Right then, I wanted to make her fall for me. I wanted her to come back, beg for more, become mine willingly.

‚ÄúPlease, fuck me‚Ä¶ fuck me hard! I‚Äôm just a filthy slut who needs your big cock‚Ä¶‚Äù I‚Äôd been holding back long enough. That was all I needed to hear. Before she even finished the sentence, I was pounding into her again, fast and rough.

My hands moved to her tits. They bounced with every thrust. I squeezed and grabbed without mercy.

She moaned like a dog, crying that she was going to die again.

I didn‚Äôt even know how long we kept going. At some point, she passed out. Weak little thing. I kept fucking her‚Äîher pussy soaking wet, clinging to me like it never wanted to let go.

Eventually, I realized if I kept going, she wouldn‚Äôt be able to walk tomorrow. I went to wash up, cooled myself off, then came back and wiped her down. I even dressed her in a fresh pair of panties that my assistant had sent over.

When I finally lay down beside her, my dick was hard again. Damn it.

I didn‚Äôt know how long I‚Äôd been asleep, but the second I felt her stir, I was fully alert. Still, I kept my breathing steady, pretending to sleep.

In the underworld, the tiniest sound could wake me. I wanted to see what she‚Äôd do after a night like that.

Would she ask me to punish Vincent? Or maybe go after the woman Vincent was screwing?

Then I heard the door open. I opened my eyes.

There was a stack of cash on the nightstand. I nearly laughed.

In the financial empire the Feron mafia family controlled, that money wouldn‚Äôt even pay for a bottle of whiskey at my club.

She‚Äôd also left a note. The line ‚ÄúGoodbye for good‚Äù read more like a slap in the face.

She actually thought she could treat me like a one-night stand.

I tossed the note in the trash and pocketed the cash.

Just then, my assistant Carl called. ‚ÄúThe plane tickets are ready.‚Äù

I fastened my cufflinks and said coldly, ‚ÄúHave someone investigate that woman from last night. I want everything‚Äîphone records, social media, bank statements. Go back three months. I want to know everyone she‚Äôs come into contact with.‚Äù

Before hanging up, I added, ‚ÄúPay special attention to any links with rival families.‚Äù

If she‚Äôs clean‚Äînot a plant from another mafia family‚ÄîI might just keep her around as a mistress. Help her get revenge on Vincent.

As for Vincent‚Ä¶ the guy‚Äôs a horny fool with a temper.

It‚Äôs about time he learned a hard lesson.

**Chapter 5 Just Get Divorced Already**

Luna Feron's POV:

My heart was still pounding as I walked out of the hotel lobby.

A blast of disinfectant-scented air hit me as the revolving doors of the Continental Hotel spun open. It stung my cheeks and sobered me up a little more.

Verona‚Äôs streets bustled with traffic. Every man in a suit I brushed past reminded me of the cold darkness in Silas‚Äôs eyes‚Äîthat ruthless glint only a mafia boss could carry.

*I really slept with the head of the Feron mafia family‚Ä¶*

This wasn‚Äôt a dream. It was real. My body still ached with the memory of last night‚Äôs sex.

I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about the way he‚Äôd wrapped his hand around my throat, fucking me to the edge of breathlessness and pulling me into an orgasm...

The thought alone left my mouth dry, a wave of heat tingling through me.

I smacked myself in the head and quickly flagged down a cab to head home.

Vincent‚Äôs family wasn‚Äôt particularly impressive compared to the rest of the Feron mafia family. Most of the time, they were the ones doing the sucking up.

Before stepping inside the house, I double-checked that no suspicious marks were showing on my skin. Only when I was sure did I walk in.

At the foyer, my mother-in-law Claudia‚Äôs Herm√®s scarf lay draped over the carved wooden armchair‚Äîone of the ‚Äúfiner pieces‚Äù smuggled through the mafia family‚Äôs luxury goods ring.

I adjusted my clothes and hair several times in the entryway mirror, making absolutely sure there were no traces left on me‚Äîno scent, no signs. Then I took a deep breath and stepped in.

‚ÄúMom.‚Äù I greeted her, keeping my tone sweet.

‚ÄúYou dare show your face here?!‚Äù Claudia slammed her coffee cup down. The sharp clatter of porcelain made me flinch.

Funny. I remembered when I first moved in with Vincent‚Äîshe‚Äôd told me all the dishes were expensive bone china and warned me to be extra careful during chores.

She jabbed a red-lacquered finger at me. The three-carat diamond ring on it glinted with a harsh light‚Äîanother trophy from the mafia family‚Äôs money-laundering casinos.

‚ÄúDivorce! You‚Äôre divorcing my son‚Äînow!‚Äù she screamed, her voice echoing through the entire living room. The house staff scattered immediately.

That was how things worked in Vincent‚Äôs family. When the master of the house got angry, no servant was allowed to witness it.

I clenched my hands so tightly my nails dug into my palms. My eyes drifted to the rhinestone-covered belt on her robe, remembering what she‚Äôd said three years ago when I married Vincent: ‚ÄúA girl from the slums who got herself into this family by spreading her legs.‚Äù

I knew my background wasn‚Äôt impressive. Even as a side branch of the mafia family, Vincent‚Äôs family had real power.

But I‚Äôd worked hard. Even if I didn‚Äôt have access to the mafia family‚Äôs underworld, I had carved out my place. A ‚Äúgirl from the slums‚Äù had risen to become the chief senior translator at the mafia family‚Äôs legitimate corporate front. I wasn‚Äôt talentless.

I had endured it all‚Äîfor love, for this home. I never fought back when Claudia insulted me. I never touched a dime of Vincent‚Äôs money. And yet Vincent had still cheated.

I told myself to hold it together. I took a breath and said, ‚ÄúMom, I didn‚Äôt skip the appointment with that doctor on purpose. Something came up at work‚Ä¶‚Äù I forced a smile and reached out to take her stiff arm, trying to calm her down before she exploded again.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt call me Mom!‚Äù Claudia yanked her arm away. A strong whiff of Chanel No. 5 hit me, and I wrinkled my nose.

‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt give me a grandson, then divorce my son!‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. If I can‚Äôt get pregnant this time‚Ä¶‚Äù I paused, struggling to keep my voice steady, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll divorce Vincent.‚Äù

Outside the window, a crow landed on the iron railing and let out a harsh screech.

Claudia‚Äôs expression immediately softened.

Her thick palm smacked against my belly like she was checking the quality of a product on a shelf. In her eyes, I was nothing but a surrogate.

I fought the urge to vomit. I thought of Silas‚Äôs burning touch on my waist last night‚Äîfirm and inescapable in a completely different way.

I didn‚Äôt bother with Claudia after that. I went upstairs, changed clothes, and drove straight to the office.

Standing in front of the Feron mafia family corporate tower, I caught my reflection in the glass wall‚Äîpale and tired.

Between the thirty-third floor where Planning was and the ninth floor where Translation sat, the distance wasn‚Äôt just physical.

My eyes burned. I swallowed the lump in my throat and stepped into the elevator. As it rose, the mirrored wall reflected my empty hands.

No wedding ring. Not even a mark.

We‚Äôd been married a year, and Vincent had never once worn a ring. He‚Äôd told me the mafia family hated nepotism and that we had to keep our relationship secret.

So no one at the company even knew we were married.

Looking back now,¬†*God, I was so stupid.*

From the start, he was just worried our marriage would ruin his value on the family matchmaking circuit‚Äîafraid I‚Äôd ruin his fun chasing other women.

I dropped my car keys into my purse and caught sight of something: a square cufflink. I recognized the brand‚Äîluxury. Just one of those cufflinks cost over 200 grand.

I stared at it, holding it between my fingers.

Vincent could never afford something like this.

And in a flash, Silas‚Äôs face appeared in my mind.

My heart skipped a beat.

**Chapter 6 That Woman‚Äôs Perfume**

Luna Feron's POV:

Why was Silas‚Äôs cufflink in my bag?

In the vast underground empire controlled by the Feron mafia family, a $200,000 cufflink was probably nothing more than a rounding error in their laundering accounts. But right now, it felt like a searing brand against my skin‚Äîproof of the madness that had unfolded the night before.

Verona‚Äôs midday sun was almost blinding. The glass fa√ßade of the Feron mafia family Group‚Äôs skyscraper reflected the silhouettes of smuggling freighters docking at the port.

I stepped through the revolving doors in my ten-centimeter heels‚Äîonly to hear a familiar laugh at the corner. Mixed with the sharp scent of Black Opium.

Vincent ¬∑ the Feron mafia family. My husband, at least in name. His arm was wrapped around the waist of his boss, Erica.

There was a hickey on the side of her neck, barely hidden beneath the collar of her custom Chanel blouse. I stared at her a moment longer than I should have.

It was her. The same woman I‚Äôd seen him screwing last night.

‚ÄúVincent.‚Äù I called his name, my voice colder than the ocean wind blowing in from the Verona port.

He turned. His pupils contracted sharply‚Äîhis wife, the one who was supposed to be in Minch, was now standing face-to-face with him and his mistress.

Erica‚Äôs fingers, painted in dark polish, traced his collar lazily. She didn‚Äôt bother hiding the mark on her neck. Before walking off, she even arched a brow at me‚Äîmocking me, laughing in my face.

Once the elevator doors closed behind us, Vincent dropped the act.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs my boss,‚Äù he said, loosening his tie. ‚ÄúShe was just asking me about last week‚Äôs report.‚Äù

As his Adam‚Äôs apple bobbed, I couldn‚Äôt help but recall the way he‚Äôd looked and sounded in bed with her last night‚Ä¶

My whole body trembled from rage.¬†*Stay calm. Don‚Äôt lose it here.*

In the tight elevator, the scent of his cologne was suffocating. It was the same one Erica wore‚Äîstrong, pungent, overwhelming.

He noticed me sniffing the air and quickly explained, ‚ÄúMy boss is obsessed with perfume. She sprays so much of it, I can‚Äôt even escape it!‚Äù He even threw in a pained expression for effect.

‚ÄúWeren‚Äôt you supposed to be on a business trip to Minch?‚Äù he added, clearly trying to change the subject.

I clutched my clutch bag tighter, my gut twisting, emotions mixing with bitterness.

After what happened to me in college, I developed a trauma around sex. Even after marrying Vincent, I just couldn‚Äôt do it. We‚Äôd never once consummated our marriage.

Vincent was a normal man. Of course he had needs. He could‚Äôve just been honest with me‚Äîtold me he needed it. I would‚Äôve tried even harder to face my issues.

But he never said a word. He just ran straight into his boss‚Äôs bed.

And now‚Ä¶ the thrill of last night‚Äôs revenge on him was starting to fade.

‚ÄúDid you forget?‚Äù I said, voice sharp. ‚ÄúYesterday was our one-year wedding anniversary.‚Äù

Vincent‚Äôs face twitched. My eyes drifted to the bulge in his jacket pocket‚Äîsquare, box-shaped. A jewelry box.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. I completely forgot about it. But‚Ä¶‚Äù He pulled the box out and opened it. Inside was a diamond ring. ‚ÄúI did get you a gift.‚Äù

I stared at the ring.

It was identical to the pair of earrings Erica had on.

Probably meant for her, too.

Disgust rose in my throat. I instinctively took a step back.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong? You don‚Äôt like the ring?‚Äù

‚ÄúI do. But we‚Äôre at the office. It wouldn‚Äôt look good if anyone saw.‚Äù I gave the perfect excuse and took the ring from his hand.

He didn‚Äôt doubt me for a second. He placed a hand on my shoulder and said gently, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go out for dinner tonight. I‚Äôll make it up to you.‚Äù

That sickly perfume of hers clung to him‚Äîit was nauseating. I fought the urge to shove him away.

Ding. The elevator doors slid open. A coworker stood outside.

He was about to step in, but froze when he saw how close Vincent and I were. His eyes lit up with curiosity.

Vincent reacted quickly. He moved his hand off my shoulder and said to the guy, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs wearing heels‚Äîalmost lost her balance. Just lending a hand.‚Äù

That explanation‚Äîtrying to hide our marriage while his mistress could parade around in public‚Äîdisgusted me more than Erica‚Äôs smug smirk.

Back at my desk, my hands trembled as I opened my laptop. The clack of the keyboard mixed with the distant blare of cargo horns from the port outside. An email popped up‚Äîfrom my lawyer. The divorce papers.

I had hard evidence of Vincent‚Äôs cheating. He wasn‚Äôt going to screw me over financially. I‚Äôd make sure I walked away with at least half.

As the sun set, my phone lit up with an emergency assignment from the New York branch.

I didn‚Äôt even have time to pack.

I headed straight to the airport that night.",1,1750503643.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

I get the freebie is under (¬£50), and not linked to performance, but how is it that if the perk comes in every month, and provided to all employees, this the regularity is not considered as ""expected by the employee"" and therefore not a tacit contractual expectation?

Is it because its monthly and not weekly? Or is it just borderline illegal but both employers and Perkbox realise that HMRC won't know as the money paid to perkbox goes unnoticed through the various fees?",1,1750503522.0,AskHR,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve always been the **kind of person who freezes up when the spotlight hits**‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs meetings, parties, or just ordering coffee. I used to rehearse conversations in my head for hours, only to trip over my words when it actually mattered. It got so bad that even simple, everyday interactions felt like pop quizzes I hadn‚Äôt prepared for.

Last year, I decided to do something about it. I signed up for improv classes (terrifying, but worth it). The first few sessions were a total disaster‚Äîlots of blank stares and awkward silences. But over time, I learned to stop chasing the perfect line and just respond to what‚Äôs happening in the moment. That shift changed everything for me: I started speaking up more, stopped over-planning, and actually began to enjoy the unpredictability of real-life conversations.

The problem was, once the class ended, **there wasn‚Äôt a good way to keep practicing.** Most online improv resources were boring or repetitive, and nothing really stuck. That‚Äôs why I started building Mythia‚Äî**an improv training app designed for people who want to get better at thinking on their feet, not just on stage, but in everyday life.**

Mythia gives you improv games that get harder as you improve, instant feedback, and a progress tracker so you can see how you‚Äôre growing. It‚Äôs not about becoming a performer‚Äî**it‚Äôs about finding your voice when life goes off-script.**

Left the school and stopped at the gas station to pump gas. All of a sudden it hit me that I had to piss. And not just an average piss, a full blown monster piss.

I workout 4-5times a week I‚Äôve noticed that after day 3 I‚Äôll be super tired and sleepy. Even though I eat enough (I think) and get 6-7 hours of sleep. I‚Äôm used to running on 5hours of sleep, this was before I started consistently working out and I think my body is still tuned into my older sleep schedule. I have to force myself to get that 8hours of recommended sleep. Like if suppose I go to sleep at 10pm I‚Äôll be awake at 4am or earlier and have to force myself back to sleep because I know if I don‚Äôt I‚Äôll be groggy the whole day at work. This would go on until mid week or somedays later I‚Äôm too tired to function and will sleep for 13hours straight. 

I don‚Äôt think working out like crazy or anything and have been consistent with gym for 6months. I‚Äôm not in a deficit currently either and meals are relatively balanced. Is it the water? I try to finish 8glasses of water a day and eat plenty of fruits/veggies with high water content. 

Any tips to improve sleep quality would be helpful!

**How did your father rule ‚ÄúEast Pakistan‚Äù from underground?**

{ Before you begin reading, it's important to acknowledge that each of us has a uniquely different personality and mindset. Our perspectives are shaped by a variety of influences, including our upbringing, the friends we've had, and our family, cultural, social, and religious backgrounds. As you read this piece, I encourage you to approach it with an open mind and a willingness to understand rather than to judge based on your own experiences or beliefs.}

It's important to clarify the misconceptions surrounding my father's situation regarding the term ""underground."" He was not hiding in a bunker; rather, he chose to live a simple life in his native village. He preferred to maintain a low profile, avoiding public attention while still traveling to major cities like Sylhet, Dhaka, Chattogram, and Cumilla when necessary. Rest assured, he was not in hiding.

Characteristically, my father adhered to strict religious principles, believing that taking photographs was forbidden and that striving for personal recognition for doing things for people was disfavored by Allah. As a result, his real name remained largely unknown to the public, only being used when necessary for official documentation. He grew up in the vibrant city of Calcutta during the 1930s, a time when the streets buzzed with life and stories waiting to unfold.

In the historical context of British India, the social class system among Muslims was divided into three primary groups: the Krishak (peasants), the Sramik (manual laborers), and the Praja/Proza (those who lacked land ownership rights). This division led to significant challenges for these groups. The Hindu community operated within a rigid caste system. Within this British India legal framework, my father's social standing was comparable to that of the Hindu Zamindars, who were affluent landowners and held considerable respect in society.

Politically, in the 1960s, he played a pivotal role as a Presidium Member of the Pakistan Muslim League, helping to shape Pakistan political landscape of the time.

During the period from 1969 to 1975, East Pakistan experienced significant turmoil characterized by violence, political instability, and civil unrest. This tumultuous environment posed serious challenges to the safety and security of many individuals. As a result, ensuring one's safety became a top priority for people living in the region, as the complexities of the situation made it difficult to discern the motivations behind the actions of others.

On April 8, 1971, my father was elected as Chairman of the Standing Committee of the East Pakistan Peace Committee. He received support from all pro-Pakistani parties, including a segment of the Awami League, the United Pakistan military, and the East Pakistan government. These groups accepted him as their civilian leader. This role enabled him to connect with political leaders and gain a better understanding of the diverse political views of that time.

When my father learned about the formation of the ‚ÄúMitro Bahini‚Äù in India, he recognized that India would likely take control of East Pakistan without direct intervention from the USA. As India intensified its attacks and caused considerable destruction in East Pakistan, it became increasingly clear to my father that the United Pakistan Military and the East Pakistan Rangers were struggling to defend their positions and counter the guerrilla tactics being employed.

During this critical time, my father had a conversation with Shah Azizur Rahman, who was in New York City attending a meeting at the United Nations. My father inquired if there was any discussion of a ceasefire in light of India's escalating air attacks, but Shah Azizur Rahman informed him that there were no positive developments on that front.

On the night of December 13, 1971, my father reflected deeply on the situation, considering several factors: A) The historical ties between Bengal and India over thousands of years. B) The foundation of Pakistan on Muslim nationalism, with a significant portion of the population lacking a strong connection to religious identity. C) The multitude of Muslim sects, which made it challenging to unify under a single nationalistic banner. D) The rise of regional nationalism. E) The emergence of diverse political ideologies. F) The alarming levels of poverty resulting from decades of exploitation under Hindu zamindar rule.

After contemplating these elements, my father made a decisive choice. Early the next morning, he sent telegrams to the Presidents and Secretaries of Peace Committees across 64,000 villages, 5,000 unions, 64 Mohokumas, 16 districts, and four divisions, dated December 14, 1971.

In his telegram, he expressed his strong belief, based on discussions with Shah Azizur Rahman, that after eight months of conflict and under the ineffective leadership of Yahya Khan, it was evident that the Indian military would march into Dhaka. He urged that if an invasion occurred, there should be no resistance or violence, emphasizing their oath to protect the safety of the people in an effort to preserve their sovereignty. He acknowledged their inability to defend sovereignty but insisted that the well-being of the population was paramount. This important telegram remained in my father‚Äôs records until his passing, and I have read it numerous times, though he had asked me to keep its contents private. It clearly indicated an acceptance of the potential changes ahead.

On December 16, 1971, the Peace Committee took the significant step of destroying all war records, followed by actions in 1972 by Ms. Indira Gandhi to eliminate war documentation. Additionally, in 1974, Bangladesh‚Äôs President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman restricted media freedom by burning and banning all newspapers except for a select few.

**Mitro Bahini**

The Mitro Bahini was established as a result of intense negotiations between Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and Tajuddin Ahmad following Indira's visits to the United States, France, and West Germany in November 1971. During these discussions, Tajuddin Ahmad agreed to the concept of an ‚ÄúIndia-Bangladesh Confederation‚Äù but acknowledged that the situation could change if Mujib returned from West Pakistan.

In 1971, the Indian Army had a standby force prepared with the specific objective of launching an offensive against East Pakistan. This readiness was one of several factors that influenced India's delayed response to Pakistan's initiation of Operation Searchlight in March of that year. At that time, the Indian Army's Eastern Command was primarily focused on defending the northern and eastern borders and addressing ongoing insurgencies in regions such as Nagaland, Mizoram, and among Naxalite groups in West Bengal. The Mukti Bahini, a guerrilla force engaged in the fight against the Pakistan Army, received support from the Indian Army through a coordinated effort known as Operation Jackpot. Under the leadership of General M. A. G. Osmani, the Mukti Bahini forces were organized into 11 geographical sectors to enhance command and control efficiency. Their ranks included approximately 30,000 regular soldiers, comprising three brigades, eight infantry battalions, and three artillery batteries.

It's worth noting that General Osmani was committed to maintaining strict military regulations. He did not allow the training of underage individuals in the Mukti Bahini. Contrary to some claims suggesting that children as young as ten were trained to assist the Mukti Bahini, Osmani's leadership upheld the standards of military conduct. The Mukti Bahini conducted operations from within India, collaborating with the Border Security Force (BSF) and employing guerrilla tactics against the Pakistan Army. They were not operating from inside East Pakistan.

In preparation for operations in Bangladesh, the Indian Army Eastern Command restructured its forces by merging two existing infantry corps, the IV Corps and the XXXIII Corps, and establishing a new corps known as II Corps. Additionally, the 101 Communication Zone was reorganized as a combat formation.

On November 21, 1971, a joint command structure was formed for the Indian and Bangladeshi forces in the eastern theater, led by Lieutenant General Jagjit Singh Aurora. This unified force became known as the Mitro Bahini. Alongside 29 battalions of the Border Security Force (BSF), Mukti Bahini guerrillas, who were operating near the border or stationed in camps within India, were organized into infantry companies and assigned to various Indian military formations.

Initially, General M. A. G. Osmani expressed his refusal to the creation of the ""Mitro Bahini"" and acknowledged Lieutenant General Jagjit Singh. Following this, Tajuddin Ahmad engaged in negotiations with General Osmani for several days. During their discussions, General Osmani made it clear to Tajuddin Ahmad that he held the position of Chief of Command and that Tajuddin was also under his authority.

Afterward, Tajuddin Ahmad briefed Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on the situation. In response, she consulted with General Sam Manekshaw. As a result of their discussions, General Manekshaw issued a verbal order to Lieutenant General Jagjit Singh Aurora to proceed with the formation of the ""Mitro Bahini,"" effectively bypassing General Osmani's authority.

**Aftermath of the East Pakistan Civil War:**

Following the East Pakistan Civil War, from December 14, 1971, to March 14, 1972, East Pakistan was under the occupation of the Indian military, led by Lieutenant General Jagjit Singh Aurora. Upon the withdrawal of Indian forces on March 14, 1972, Bangladesh faced significant challenges and crises.

During this period, different groups discussed how to form a military organization in the country. ¬†Some suggested the creation of a Red Army, while others advocated for a Confederate Army, the Rakkhi Bahini, or the Gonobahini. Amidst these discussions, my father advised General Osmani to organize a military organization in preparation for the imminent Indian withdrawal. However, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the Bengalis‚Äô Father, opposed this idea, asserting, ""We have no enemy; we do not need an army."" Instead, he proposed the formation of the Rakkhi Bahini for civil defense.

Following the establishment of the Bangladesh military, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi engaged in discussions with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. During their conversation, Mujib expressed the necessity of forming a military force, stating the importance of appeasing the Razakars. He emphasized his commitment to creating the ‚ÄúRakkhi Bahini,‚Äù a paramilitary organization intended to enhance security and support the emerging nation.

The military of Bangladesh, which includes the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Bangladesh Rifles (BDR), was established with personnel and structures that originated from the former Pakistani military, including the Army, Navy, Air Force, as well as the East Pakistan Rangers and Razakars. It is a common misconception that all members of the Mukti Bahini were absorbed into the Bangladesh military. In reality, the Mukti Bahini consisted of various groups, and many of its members faced significant losses during the coup, counter-coup, court-martial and gang fight, which impacted the efforts to stabilize the war-torn country.

Different leaders had varying visions for the military structure: Serajul Alam Khan supported the Gonobahini, Khaled Mosharraf favored the Confederate Army, and Colonel Taher advocated for the formation of a Red Army. These differing perspectives highlighted the complexities and divisions within the leadership of the newly formed government.

If we thoroughly analyze the situation, it is evident that there were attempts on his life. Additionally, some prominent leaders of the Muslim League, such as Abdul Monem Khan and Fazlul Quader Chowdhury, were actually killed.

The world acknowledges the existence of lawless countries like Haiti, Mexico, Venezuela, Yemen, Lebanon, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Mali, South Sudan, Sudan, Somalia, Pakistan and Syria. However, my father had a unique influence in a lawless, anarchic nation that the father of the Bengalis, Mujib, labeled as the ‚ÄúNation of Thieves and Criminals.‚Äù Through his relentless efforts, my father provided stability and governance to 80 million people from behind the scenes‚Äîsomething Mujib would never have achieved, no matter how many times he was born. My father's actions were shrouded in secrecy, demonstrating that true impact doesn‚Äôt require public recognition. It‚Äôs not about name and fame; integrity and social respect create real change. My father stands as the greatest example of this principle.

My father passed away on February 29, 1992, but he left behind a country that still has a functioning government, unlike many other lawless nations. He told Shah Azizur Rahman, ‚ÄúThe interest of the party is greater than personal ambition, and the country‚Äôs interest surpasses party interest.‚Äù My people are poor and suffer from political and religious ignorance. This weakness makes them easy to manipulate, requiring constant vigilance to keep watch over them.

**In Short:**

In a few words, my father played a significant role as political advisor to key political figures such as MAG Osmani, Khawaja Nazimuddin, Nurul Amin, Abdul Monem Khan, President Ayub Khan, Fazlul Qadir Chaudhry, Mohammad Ali Bogra, Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad, Shah Azizur Rahman, as well as prominent Bengali leaders like Mujib and Zia. Although he did not hold a position of power himself, his insights were highly valued, and those leaders respected his advice, implementing his recommendations whenever feasible and necessary.

My father primarily interacted with the individuals mentioned above through informal means, such as telegrams, telephone calls, and conversations over coffee or tea. Unlike formal cabinet meetings or public speaking engagements, these interactions were more personal and casual in nature.",1,1750502846.0,u_khalisdar,0,1.0,False

We joke, we gossip, we bet coffee gift cards on sports games.  He is an older man almost about to retire.  When the strata changed management companies, I rallied our community to keep him employed.  He is a good watchman.

  
Recently, he was chatting with another tenant as I pulled into the garage.  I heard a loud bang on my car.  I went out to investigate.  He apologised, he had thrown a 3-4 inch stick towards my car for the tenant's dog to fetch.  It struck my car by accident.  I went into the parkade and inspected my car for damage and to my dismay there is a feint dent in the area where the stick struck.

  
I discretely spoke to him about it and he spazzed out.  Vowing to fight it all the way and force me to prove that he did it.  The entire time I spoke to him with graciousness and an effort for an amicable solution.

  
The following night he tried to avoid my gaze.  an hour later as I was parking he was in the parkade and so I respectfully addressed him again.  At first the conversation was amicable, he again admitted that he did throw the stick, it was an accident and it did strike my car.  However he refuses to admit that the damage I showed him was caused by him.  Repeating again if it went to court or insurance or any type of adjudication he would even lie and deny everything.

Eventually he just stated he doesn't want to talk about this anymore and we both turned and left.



Am I the asshole here if I want to take this to the full extent of adjudication, expecting him to do as he said he would ie lie to a court.  In my heart I want this to happen because if he breaks the rules... then I can also break the rules.  Outlaws are not bound by the protection of the law.  And I can be quite the devil.

His shirt is unbuttoned halfway, his tie long abandoned, and his cheeks are flushed from too much whiskey.

‚ÄúAnd I‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶will always love you‚Ä¶..‚Äù he sings, closing his eyes.

His voice is terrible.

Standing next to him, practically glued to his side, is his secretary, Emily. Her left arm is around Ryan's waist, her fingers lightly grazing his back as she sings along. She‚Äôs younger than me, at least by half a decade, all wide eyes and perfect curves, dressed in a tight, low-cut dress that makes it impossible to ignore her presence. She leans into Ryan, whispering something in his ear, and he throws his head back, laughing. He looks at her like she‚Äôs the funniest person in the world.

I‚Äôve never seen him this happy.

The last time I saw him this happy was on our wedding day, seven years ago. Back then, his eyes sparkled when he looked at me. Now, the light in them has grown dimmer; they're shining for someone else.

Around me, everyone is laughing. It‚Äôs the company‚Äôs quarterly review party, and the employees are loose after a few too many drinks, finding Ryan and Emily‚Äôs performance hilarious. But I know what they‚Äôre really laughing at. They‚Äôre laughing at me. The CEO‚Äôs wife, sitting here while her husband practically gropes his secretary in front of everyone. The whispers, the side glances, they don‚Äôt even try to hide it.

‚ÄúDo you think they‚Äôre going to kiss?‚Äù someone whispers behind me.

‚ÄúDefinitely. Bet they‚Äôll be doing more than kissing after this,‚Äù someone else replies, and they both chuckle.

I turn around to look at the people talking. Young, drunk, probably high on weed too. They must be interns. Only people with zero knowledge of the company‚Äôs hierarchy would make such a statement close to their employer‚Äôs wife.

Or maybe they just don‚Äôt care.

The girl, with messy blonde hair and red cheeks, locks eyes with me. ‚ÄúHi!‚Äù she says, a little too loud. ‚ÄúDo you work here?‚Äù

Do I work here? My eyes narrow. She's definitely an intern.

She‚Äôs pretty, the kind of pretty that comes with youth and arrogance. The boy next to her drapes his arm lazily over her shoulders.

I don‚Äôt respond. I just stare at them, cold and unblinking.

Before I can say something that would make them regret their existence, I hear my name called.

‚ÄúJulie!‚Äù the voice says, drawing my attention.

Even before I turn, I know who it is. Samantha, the vice president of marketing. We both work for Paragon Jewels, Ryan‚Äôs company, the leading manufacturer of luxury jewelry in North America. Her position is just below mine, so she‚Äôs one of the few who calls out my name like we‚Äôre friends, even though we‚Äôre not.

‚ÄúSamantha,‚Äù I reply, forcing a polite smile.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know you were here, Julie. I was just telling the marketing team we have to get you involved more!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh?‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúWhy‚Äôs that?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôre the head of marketing, and everyone wants to meet you! You‚Äôre so hard to catch these days. And besides, we never get a chance to chat at work,‚Äù she says, with an overplayed wink.

Her gaze drifts to the stage where Ryan and Emily are swaying together, sharing the mic, laughing like they‚Äôre on some private date instead of a work event.

‚ÄúSo, Mrs. O‚ÄôBrien,‚Äù she says, smirking, ‚Äúhow are you enjoying the show so far?‚Äù

She's mocking me. The fucking bitch.

I force a bright smile. ‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ fantastic,‚Äù I say, struggling to keep a straight face. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm thrilled to see my husband‚Äôs hard work is being rewarded with such‚Ä¶ dedication from his staff.‚Äù

The crowd is clapping now, giving Ryan and his secretary a standing ovation. I guess they're done with their nonsense.

But then Ryan speaks into the microphone. ‚ÄúBefore we get down, we‚Äôve got one more song for you!‚Äù

More applause. More laughter. And I just want the ground to open up and swallow me.

Samantha looks at me with pity in her eyes. ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ umm,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll catch up with you later.‚Äù

She quickly excuses herself.

Behind me, I hear those interns whispering again. ‚ÄúOh, my God. Did you hear what she said? That's Mrs. O‚ÄôBrien.‚Äù

I turn to glare at them one last time, and the boy shifts uncomfortably, pulling the girl to her feet. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go,‚Äù he mutters under his breath, and they stumble away, sneaking a look at me before disappearing into the crowd.

Good. Let them run.

I turn back to the stage, my heart pounding in my chest. Ryan is singing ‚ÄúEverything I Do‚Äù‚Äîif you can call that singing. Emily is now pressed against him, her hand running up his arm in a way that makes my stomach twist. She‚Äôs completely shameless, and he‚Äôs too drunk to even notice‚Äîor worse, he doesn‚Äôt care.

I can‚Äôt take it anymore.

Without thinking, I push my chair back and stand. My heels click against the floor as I march toward the stage. I can feel the weight of everyone‚Äôs eyes on me, the whispers dying down as they realize what‚Äôs happening. They‚Äôve been waiting for this‚Äîwaiting to see if I‚Äôll crack.

But I don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm done playing the perfect wife.

I climb the steps to the stage, each footstep feeling heavier than the last. Ryan doesn‚Äôt notice me at first, too lost in his drunken performance, but Emily spots me and her smile falters. Good.

‚ÄúRyan,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre leaving now.‚Äù

Ryan looks at me, surprised. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù he slurs, still holding the microphone. ‚ÄúThe party's just getting started.‚Äù

I grit my teeth, my fists clenched. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go. Now.‚Äù

‚ÄúJulie, come on,‚Äù he says, sounding annoyed now, as if I‚Äôm the one ruining his night.

I can‚Äôt help it. Something inside me snaps.

Without another word, I turn and walk toward the back of the stage. The technical operators sitting in the booth look up as I approach, their faces going pale.

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs in charge here?‚Äù I ask.

They all point to a man standing near the soundboard, holding a half-eaten donut. His eyes widen as he sees me.

‚ÄúMrs. O‚ÄôBrien,‚Äù he stammers, quickly setting the donut aside. ‚ÄúIs there something‚Äîuh‚Äîsomething I can do for you?‚Äù

‚ÄúShut it down. All of it,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúThe party‚Äôs over.‚Äù

He blinks, not sure if I‚Äôm serious, but one look at my face and he scrambles to obey. His hands fly across the controls, and within seconds, the speakers cut out with a harsh screech. The lights dim. The music dies. Silence falls over the room like a heavy curtain, and all that‚Äôs left is the sound of my heels as I walk back to center stage.

Ryan is standing there, his microphone useless in his hand.

‚ÄúJulie, what the hell?‚Äù Ryan mutters.

I meet his eyes, feeling the weight of everything I‚Äôve been holding in for too long. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve had your fun,‚Äù I say quietly, but with enough steel in my voice that it stops him from saying anything else. ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs over.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt wait for a reply. I grab his arm and start leading him down the stairs.

Ryan stumbles slightly, caught off guard by my sudden forcefulness. His eyes flick to the crowd, scanning their faces for something, maybe support, validation, but all he finds are wide eyes and muted whispers. Everyone‚Äôs too shocked, too entertained by the unfolding drama, to come to his defense.

The whispers start immediately. I hear snatches of conversation as we pass. Let them talk. Let them laugh.

Ryan's too drunk to fight me, too embarrassed to protest. For once, he‚Äôs the one who‚Äôs quiet, and I‚Äôm the one in control.

Justin, Ryan‚Äôs bodyguard/chauffeur, sees us coming and is already moving into action. He steps forward, opening the back door of the car without a word.

Ryan mumbles something under his breath‚Äîmaybe an apology, maybe an excuse‚Äîbut I don‚Äôt stop. I don‚Äôt even look at him. I tighten my grip, forcing him into the backseat with a firm push, and he collapses into the car.

‚ÄúTake us home,‚Äù I say, climbing in behind Ryan. Then I slam the door shut.

It‚Äôs true what they say about marriage: one partner is always happier than the other.

In my case, I‚Äôm the unhappy one.

I‚Äôm the one who can‚Äôt sleep. I‚Äôm the one who watches her husband‚Äôs sleeping face at night, looking for a sign‚Äîanything to prove what I‚Äôve suspected all along, that he‚Äôs cheating on me. Just say a word, goddammit, a name, something, dear God. That‚Äôs all I want. Say Emily, Ryan. Say Emily.

But Ryan never does. He‚Äôs too controlled for that.

I‚Äôm the one checking his phone, seeing notifications from the same person, the same tiny image. But I can‚Äôt see the name of the sender, can‚Äôt recognize the face due to the image size‚Äîthough it looks like Emily. I can‚Äôt even read the messages because Ryan has privatized his pop-up notifications.

I‚Äôm in the kitchen right now, already on my fifth cup of coffee. And it‚Äôs just 6 AM.

‚ÄúMorning,‚Äù Ryan says, walking in, rubbing his temple. ‚ÄúFeels like someone took a chainsaw to my head. Last night was fun.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you had fun,‚Äù I reply, trying to keep my voice steady, but the bitterness slips through. He notices it, of course. He always does.

‚ÄúSomething wrong?‚Äù Ryan asks, eyeing me cautiously.

‚ÄúWrong?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou seem‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know, off.‚Äù

I‚Äôm counting down from ten in my head. Calm down, Julie. Calm the hell down. But how can I? Ryan disgraced me last night, and he doesn‚Äôt even remember?

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine,‚Äù I say.

Ryan fetches himself a cup of coffee and joins me at the table. He‚Äôs watching me with that innocent look of his.

Sometimes I forget how handsome he is. With his lovely, sharp jawline and his bright green eyes. The eyes were the first thing I fell in love with. We were freshmen in college, and Ryan mistook me for some girl he brought to the frat party, a girl he swore was his girlfriend. And well, I played along. I enjoyed playing the part, letting him call me Vivian. And in the morning, when he was sober again and didn‚Äôt recognize me, I told him Vivian no longer wanted him and I did.

Funny how things turn out.

‚ÄúYou say you‚Äôre fine,‚Äù Ryan says, breaking the silence, ‚Äúbut you keep looking at me like you want to murder me.‚Äù

I grip the edge of the table, my nails digging into the wood. ‚ÄúYou humiliated me last night, Ryan. How is anyone supposed to respect me when my own husband doesn‚Äôt?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm talking about your stupid karaoke performance yesterday with that bitch, Emily.‚Äù

Ryan slaps his forehead dramatically. ‚ÄúOh, not this again. I‚Äôve told you a hundred times, Julie, there‚Äôs nothing to worry about. You always bring her up, like you‚Äôre obsessed or something.‚Äù

‚ÄúObsessed?‚Äù

I want to throw my coffee cup at something, and it definitely isn‚Äôt the wall.

‚ÄúYou have a life most women would kill for,‚Äù he continues. ‚ÄúA great job, a husband who comes home every night. Do you know how many women throw themselves at me? And yet, I come home to you. I pay your family‚Äôs bills. I‚Äôve set up trust funds for your nieces and nephews. But it‚Äôs never enough, is it? You‚Äôre always whining about the same thing‚ÄîEmily this, Emily that. It‚Äôs exhausting.‚Äù

I‚Äôm shaking now, my heart pounding so hard I can barely breathe. But if I say anything more, he‚Äôll call my mother again, and she‚Äôll tell me I‚Äôm being ungrateful. ‚ÄúStop trying to push Ryan into divorcing you, Julie,‚Äù she‚Äôll say. ‚ÄúNo one wants hand-me-downs. Do you want to be alone forever? Go on your knees and tell Ryan you‚Äôre sorry for being a bitch.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow would you like me to show my gratitude, my lord?‚Äù I say, glaring at Ryan. ‚ÄúShould I commission a carven image of you and worship it?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not in the mood for your sarcasm, Julie. My head is already pounding enough.‚Äù Then something crosses his eyes, a strange look. ‚ÄúActually, there‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been meaning to discuss with you. I feel like now‚Äôs the right time.‚Äù

Oh, God. My stomach tightens. He‚Äôs going to ask for a divorce. I can feel it. Mom‚Äôs going to kill me. She already planned a vacation in Rio in December.

‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù I ask, bracing myself.

‚ÄúI want an open marriage.‚Äù

For a moment, the words don‚Äôt register. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I say.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when a couple decides to give each other room to see other people, and‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI know what an open marriage means, Ryan. Jesus Christ. The answer is no.‚Äù

He looks at me with disdain. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt asking. From now on, we‚Äôre in an open marriage. When you see me with someone else, don‚Äôt bother asking questions.‚Äù

My heart slams in my chest. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only an open marriage if I agree. And I don‚Äôt.‚Äù

I‚Äôm on my feet now, pacing the kitchen, trying to contain the rage and hurt boiling inside me. Seven years of marriage, and I‚Äôm already gearing close to a heart attack.

‚ÄúI want kids, Julie,‚Äù Ryan says. ‚ÄúHow am I supposed to have any if I don‚Äôt date someone else?‚Äù

I can‚Äôt help it; I begin to cry. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs not my fault.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not my fault either. Maybe it‚Äôs just us together.‚Äù

I can‚Äôt believe he said that. We‚Äôve tried for seven years, spent a lot of money. And it‚Äôs always the same reply: you‚Äôre both healthy. The embryos are just acting weird. Nine IVFs.

I untie my robe and let it fall to the floor, stripping down until I‚Äôm standing naked in front of him. Ryan‚Äôs eyes widen in surprise.

I move closer and straddle him. I then grab his hand and place it on my chest. ‚ÄúDoes this not move you anymore?‚Äù

‚ÄúJulie‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúAm I ugly to you now?‚Äù I reach into his pants, but he quickly stands, pushing me away.

‚ÄúStop it,‚Äù he says firmly, putting space between us. ‚ÄúPut your clothes back on.‚Äù

Trembling, I watch as he walks away, heading for the stairs.

‚ÄúWait,‚Äù I call out, my voice shaky.

Ryan turns, impatient. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cool,‚Äù I say, my voice hollow. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs have an open marriage.‚Äù

Ryan nods. ‚ÄúGood.‚Äù

And just like that, he walks away, leaving me in a million pieces.

\~\~

I like to say I‚Äôm a calm person. Sometimes I swear I‚Äôm the most level-headed person I know. All my family are maniacs. My sisters, my brothers. My parents. I‚Äôve always been the one bailing people out of prison. I‚Äôve been the designated driver during college wild night parties. I‚Äôve been the cover-up story for my friends in high school. Yeah, everyone claimed they were spending the night at Julie‚Äôs house. Because their parents knew I‚Äôm a decent person.

But for the first time in my life, I think I want to kill someone.

I‚Äôm watching our driveway from the window, and Ryan is stepping out of his car with none other than Emily. Fucking Emily. And she‚Äôs carrying suitcases.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù I ask as soon as Ryan and Emily step into the house.

Ryan smiles. ‚ÄúJulie, meet Emily.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know who she is, Ryan.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. Then I won‚Äôt need to explain. Emily‚Äôs moving in.‚Äù

I‚Äôm honestly too stunned to speak. What does he mean by that? After what feels like ages, I ask, ‚ÄúIs she homeless?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Ryan says. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs my girlfriend now.‚Äù

I look at Ryan, then Emily. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù

Ryan doesn‚Äôt even look at me, just grabs Emily‚Äôs hand and starts leading her away. ‚ÄúStop being such a bad host, Julie. We‚Äôve had a long day.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo way, Ryan. She‚Äôs not staying in this house,‚Äù I say, my voice shaking with disbelief.

He doesn‚Äôt respond. They‚Äôre already halfway up the stairs.

‚ÄúDo you hear me? She‚Äôs not staying here! Take her back to wherever you picked her up. I don‚Äôt want her in my house.‚Äù

Ryan stops, turning just enough to glare at me. ‚ÄúYour house? I put a roof over your head. If I say she‚Äôs staying, she‚Äôs staying. If you don‚Äôt like it, go somewhere else. I don‚Äôt have the energy for your nonsense, Julie.‚Äù

Oh, my god. My chest tightens. ‚ÄúHow could you do this?‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt walk away from me, Ryan. Stand here and answer me.‚Äù

Emily turns to look at me, smirking. ‚ÄúBy the way, you‚Äôll need to move your things into the guest room. I‚Äôm not sharing a bed with you and Ryan. It‚Äôs bad enough sharing him with you.‚Äù

All the energy in me evaporates. I just stand there, speechless. I can‚Äôt move. I can‚Äôt breathe. I hear them whispering and giggling as they head into our bedroom. My room. They‚Äôre kicking me out of my own room.

The living room suddenly feels too small.

I stumble to the front door, fling it open, and run outside, needing to escape. I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôm going, but I can‚Äôt be here.

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, are you alright?‚Äù Justin, Ryan‚Äôs bodyguard, asks as I approach, breathless. He‚Äôs wiping down Ryan‚Äôs Rolls-Royce, eyeing me with concern.

I hold out my hand. ‚ÄúThe keys.‚Äù

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe damn keys, Justin.‚Äù

He hesitates for a second, but hands them over. I know he‚Äôs wondering why I need Ryan‚Äôs car when I have my own. Honestly, I don‚Äôt know either. But if I stay here for one more second, I might lose it completely.

‚ÄúMrs. O‚ÄôBrien, let me drive you‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, Justin. I‚Äôll drive myself.‚Äù

I pull out of the driveway and speed off into the night.

\~\~

It‚Äôs been over an hour, and I‚Äôm still driving aimlessly. My mind is a blur of everything‚ÄîRyan, Emily, their smug faces. Initially, I‚Äôd planned a Saturday evening manicure and pedicure, just to get my mind off things. Things that involve Ryan. But I‚Äôm no longer in the mood to get my feet and hands pampered. It‚Äôs not even been two days since he dropped that bombshell about an open marriage, almost giving me a heart attack, and now he‚Äôs bringing his mistress over? Emily? The same Emily?

The craziest thing is I can‚Äôt cry. I feel nothing. No tears, no anger‚Äîjust this hollow emptiness. The last therapist I spoke with said it‚Äôs a defense mechanism. That I‚Äôm in denial of my actual emotions. Cry it out, Julie, she used to say. Let yourself be free of the burden.

Well, they can all go to hell. Ryan. Emily. The therapist. My entire family.

I know what I need. A drink.

I pull into the nearest bar and head inside.

‚ÄúA shot of whiskey,‚Äù I tell the bartender. ‚ÄúNeat. And keep them coming.‚Äù

‚ÄúLong night?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to talk about it,‚Äù I say.

He pours the first shot, and I throw it back, welcoming the burn in my throat. It‚Äôs harsh, but it‚Äôs better than the alternative‚Äîthinking about what‚Äôs happening back home.

As I down my second shot, I hear someone call out, ‚ÄúMaggie! Maggie!‚Äù

I turn, confused, and see a tall, handsome man approaching me, his eyes locked on mine. Before I can react, he‚Äôs wrapping his arms around me. ‚ÄúThank God I found you,‚Äù he says, pulling me into a tight hug.

I stiffen. ‚ÄúWho the hell are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease, just go along with it,‚Äù he whispers in my ear. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll explain later. I promise.‚Äù

Before I can push him away, a furious-looking woman storms over.

‚ÄúLuke! I knew it. You can‚Äôt hide from me.‚Äù

The stranger‚ÄîLuke, apparently‚Äîturns to face her, still keeping his arm around me. ‚ÄúVeronica, what a surprise,‚Äù he says, feigning nonchalance.

‚ÄúMy name isn‚Äôt Veronica, it‚Äôs Evelyn.‚Äù

Luke flashes her a sheepish smile. ‚ÄúRight, sorry. I get those mixed up sometimes. Anyway, this is Maggie‚Äîmy wife.‚Äù

He lifts my hand, showing off my wedding ring, and I nearly choke. What is happening?

Evelyn glares at me. ‚ÄúYou married this scumbag?‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know what to say, so I just nod.

‚ÄúYou should divorce him,‚Äù she snaps. ‚ÄúHe spends one night with you and disappears the next. Who does that?‚Äù

‚ÄúBut that's what we agreed on. A one-night st‚Äî‚Äù Luke begins, but Evelyn cuts him off.

‚ÄúFuck you, Luke.‚Äù

And with that, she storms off, leaving the two of us standing there, stunned.

Luke breathes a sigh of relief. ‚ÄúWell, that one was a stalker. At least she's off my back now.‚Äù He turns to me, smiling. ‚ÄúCan I buy you a drink? You‚Äôve definitely earned it.‚Äù

I stare at him and then stare at the spot where the angry lady once stood. It all happened so fast. I can't even process it. I think I need that drink.

‚ÄúMake it two,‚Äù I say.

And Luke smiles.",1,1750502739.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

Yesterday her card wouldn't work so we called. They asked us about a 300 dollar check that was deposited yesterday... at first I thought they were talking about her paycheck deposited, but no. So I said we had no idea. She pulled up the transactions on her phone and saw that an actual check was ""pending"" with the memo line ""my dad is a cop"" Capital One asked how she accessed her account, android or iPhone. I told them it was an android and so is mine if I log on to check her account. 

   They put me on hold and came back on the line and basically said that this was a fraudulent check and that they were closing her account because they determined that she was a liability and could no longer have an account with them. 
  I was in shock and pissed so I didn't ask any questions that I now have. I'd like to see a copy of this check, and I'm curious HOW it was deposited. My daughter is heartbroken and scared how this happened. We also are completely puzzled by the memo line because it's so odd... her dad is NOT a cop and she hasn't even talked to him in many years, and what a weird thing to have on it.

   I feel like my daughter was targeted for some weird reason for her account to be screwed up... is it possible this is a bizarre scam? Has anyone ever heard of this happening?",1,1750502684.0,Scams,20,1.0,False

* Living in a very high cost of living area.
* Planning to Coast Fire in 4-8 years (market dependant).

Seeking out feedback on my budget plan from July 2025 for the following 12 months.  Few things to note:

* My numbers are VERY conservative.  eg I'd expect the property expense to come well below but that's worst case scenario.  What ever I don't spend goes to shares...
* I'm in a deficit with a few properties, as I'm waiting for capital gains / long game.  This yearly deficit should close in the next few years.
* I haven't purchased property 3 yet, but will buy within the next six months.
* The ""fat"" is in my travel in luxuries - I don't plan a big trip in the next year.  Also carry over $60k for emergencies.
* Day2day category covers everything from public transport, meals out, coffees, shopping, etc.  
* Bills covers all the things you can't control, eg medical gaps, utilities, medications, groceries.

nagulat lang din talaga ko sa ex ng friend ko, she told me na sa zus coffee nagwo-work yun and umaabot ng 8-9k per cutoff yung salary niya which is larger than us. kaya parang ayun din dahilan why i want to apply as a barista. 

anyway, thank you in advance po!

Sienna‚Äôs POV

""Sloppy form on that dismount, Reyes!"" Coach Foster's voice cut across the gym like a whip crack.

He stormed toward me, clipboard clutched in his white-knuckled grip.

""And those landings‚Äîare you gaining weight again? It's getting obvious!""

Around us, the other gymnasts froze mid-routine, their eyes darting between George and me like spectators at a gladiator match.

Sarah stopped her floor routine entirely. Maya's hands slipped on the beam.

""I hit my marks,"" I said, my voice steady despite the fire burning in my chest.

""Don't you dare argue with me!"" George stepped closer, invading my space until I could smell his stale coffee breath. ""Your body fat percentage is up. Your form is deteriorating. And if you think attitude is going to get you to the Olympics‚Äî""

""My weight is exactly what it was last month.""

The gym went dead silent. Even the sound system seemed to pause between songs. George's face flushed red, his jaw working like he was chewing nails.

""Extra conditioning. Tonight. And tomorrow morning at five AM."" He scribbled furiously on his clipboard. ""Maybe hunger will teach you respect.""

I stayed still, heart pounding from more than just exertion.

In gymnastics, perfection isn't a goal, it's a demand, and the price is your body, your mind, and everything in between.

I learned early enough that pain gets praised and silence keeps you safe. But even silence can't shield you when everything starts to shift.

The gym doors creaked open, and Maria Holloway, the center director, stepped inside.

Clipboard in hand. Tight jaw. I could tell something was off before she said a word.

‚ÄúGeorge. Sienna.‚Äù Her heels clicked across the floor. ‚ÄúWe have an update. Ford Callen is joining our coaching staff.‚Äù

The name hit harder than George‚Äôs insults. I glanced at him, and the reaction came fast, pure disdain.

‚ÄúCallen?‚Äù His voice climbed. ‚ÄúThat washed-up has-been? Couldn‚Äôt handle being second best, so now you're bringing that reform zealot into my program?‚Äù

""Our program,"" Maria corrected sharply. ""And he starts today.""

""Over my dead body!"" George's face went purple. ""That man is poison! He destroys everything he touches with his soft-approach nonsense. My girls are champions because I make them champions!""

""Your girls are breaking down,"" Maria shot back, her composure cracking. ""Injury rates are through the roof. Three girls quit last month alone.""

""Weak links!"" George slammed his hand against the nearest apparatus. ""I don't coddle quitters!""

I stayed quiet, processing. I‚Äôd heard of Callen, of course. Everyone had. Olympic prodigy turned coach with a reputation for... well,¬†*a lot*.

He was either ahead of his time or a walking controversy, depending on who you asked. George hated him, clearly. That alone made me curious.

""I..."" I started, but the gym doors opened again.

Ford Callen walked in like he owned the place.

Tall, broad-shouldered, dressed entirely in black athletic wear that made him look like death incarnate. His dark hair was tousled, a thin scar cutting through his right eyebrow like a battle wound.

But it was his eyes that commanded attention‚Äîsharp, observing, missing nothing as they swept the room.

He didn't announce himself. Didn't smile or offer pleasantries. He simply stood there, taking inventory of the chaos he'd walked into.

""Callen."" George's voice dripped with venom.

""Foster."" Ford's response was flat, emotionless.

The tension between them was electric, crackling across the space like live wires. Every gymnast in the room felt it.

We'd all heard the stories‚Äîformer training partners, rival coaches, bad blood that went back years.

Something about the way he looked at me, not lascivious, not cruel, but clinical, and it made my pulse jump. And then I hated myself for noticing how attractive he was.

He looked like trouble.

The kind that didn‚Äôt yell but dismantled you with silence. I broke eye contact, jaw tight, and resumed stretching like it hadn‚Äôt happened.

""Sienna Reyes,"" he said, my name carrying weight in his deep voice.

""That's my athlete,"" George snarled, stepping protectively‚Äîor possessively‚Äîin front of me.

‚ÄúSienna, I know this is sudden,‚Äù Maria started. ‚ÄúFord Callen has a different approach, but he‚Äôs been brought in for a reason. He‚Äôs highly respected.‚Äù

‚ÄúI already have a coach,‚Äù I said, keeping my voice even. ‚ÄúCoach Foster‚Äôs methods work.‚Äù

Her eyes softened. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not asking you to switch loyalties. Just‚Ä¶ be open. We all want you at the Olympics. Callen‚Äôs here to help.‚Äù

I nodded once. No promises made.

That evening, I stayed late for my second round of conditioning. It wasn‚Äôt mandatory, but I‚Äôd built a routine that didn‚Äôt allow rest. The gym was quieter than usual, lit by half the overheads.

My arms ached, legs heavy, but I worked through it. Floor passes, rope climbs, core sets until the burn dulled into background noise. My phone buzzed mid-cooldown.

*\&gt; Coach Foster***:**¬†*Callen watched your floor today. Claims your landings are unstable. Wants access to your training logs. I told him exactly where he could shove his opinions. Don't speak to him. Don't listen to him. Extra conditioning tomorrow, 5 AM sharp. We'll show him what real commitment looks like.*

I stared at the message, thumb hovering over the screen. My body screamed for rest, but I typed the only reply George expected.

*\&gt; Me:*¬†*I‚Äôll be ready.*

But as I packed up my gear, movement caught my eye. A figure in black sat motionless in the bleachers, arms crossed, watching. Ford Callen. Waiting.

This time, I didn't look away. Didn't pretend he wasn't there. We stared at each other across the empty gym, two predators sizing each other up.

""Rough day?"" he called out, his voice echoing in the silence.

""I've had worse.""

He stood slowly, deliberately, and walked down from the bleachers. Each step seemed calculated, purposeful. When he reached the floor, he stopped just close enough to make his presence felt.

""George thinks he owns you,"" he said simply.

""Nobody owns me.""

""Good."" His eyes held mine steadily. ""Because tomorrow, we're going to find out what you're really capable of.""

Ford‚Äôs POV

They brought me in to clean up the program, but no one warned me the rot started at the roots.

Five minutes into Elite Performance Center and I'm already cataloging the disasters.

State-of-the-art equipment crammed into a space designed by someone who clearly never coached a day in their life. Apparatus placement that forces athletes to weave around each other like they're playing human Frogger.

And the coaching methods? Christ. It's like stepping into a time machine set to ""toxic masculinity circa 1985.""

‚ÄúThis place could be Olympic-grade,‚Äù I told Maria during our initial sit-down, gesturing at the chaos visible through her office windows, ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs operating like a glorified high school gym.‚Äù

She winced and nodded, tight-lipped.

I knew what she wanted from me, to play nice, integrate quietly, don't rock the boat. Classic institutional thinking‚Äîlet's fix the problem without actually changing anything substantial.

But I didn't drag myself out of semi-retirement to be a diplomatic wallflower. I'm here because this system is systematically destroying kids, and everyone's too invested in the status quo to admit it.

My first real glimpse of the damage comes courtesy of George Foster's afternoon masterclass in psychological warfare.

He's circling this girl like a shark who's caught the scent of blood, and she's performing her floor routine with the emotional range of a well-programmed robot.

I remembered her name from competition footage.

Sienna Reyes. Twenty-two. Olympic potential, a rising senior with clean technique and stiff expression, like someone trained to perform on autopilot.

She was in the middle of a floor routine when I stopped near the edge of the mat.

Perfect technique. Dead eyes. Every landing hit with mathematical precision, but zero soul. It's gymnastics performed like she's solving calculus problems in real-time.

I've seen this before, athletes trained to chase approval instead of excellence. The difference between performing and simply executing commands.

Sienna moves like someone who's forgotten that gymnastics used to be fun, assuming it ever was for her.

""Tuck tighter on that third pass, Reyes!"" George barks loud enough for the entire gym to hear. ""You're starting to get heavy!""

I glance at Sienna's frame‚Äîall sharp angles and visible ribs. If she's ""heavy,"" then I'm a fucking elephant.

The casual cruelty hits me like a punch, but what really twists my gut is how she absorbs it without flinching. Like she's been conditioned to accept this shit as normal feedback.

Maria's standing beside me, studiously avoiding eye contact. The institutional blindness is stunning‚Äîeveryone can see the abuse, but acknowledging it would require actually doing something about it.

The staff meeting later that week is peak corporate theater. Folding chairs arranged in a circle like we're about to share our feelings at summer camp, instead of discussing how to revolutionize an entire training philosophy.

George struts in fifteen minutes late because punctuality is apparently beneath him, radiating the kind of arrogance that makes my teeth itch.

""Nice of you to join us, Callen,"" he says, sliding into the chair directly across from me with a smirk that could curdle milk. ""Hope the transition from retirement isn't too rough.""

The condescension is so thick I could spread it on toast. But I've learned that responding to every provocation is amateur hour.

I keep my expression neutral while he launches into his usual sermon about discipline and medal counts.

I didn‚Äôt bother replying.

Ten minutes of George's self-congratulatory bullshit and I'm already plotting escape routes.

He's rambling about his ""girls"" like they're prized livestock he's personally trained, completely oblivious to the fact that half the room looks ready to fake their own deaths to get out of here.

Then came the shot I knew was coming.

""Some athletes just aren't built for the long haul,"" he says, his gaze finding mine with surgical precision. ""Physical limitations, mental weakness‚Äîit all comes out eventually. Wouldn't you agree, Callen?""

I could let it slide. Should, probably.

But George Foster represents everything I spent five years trying to forget about competitive athletics‚Äîthe casual cruelty, the manipulation and willingness to sacrifice athletes for personal glory.

""My focus is on building athletes who don't just survive long enough to collect hardware,"" I say, my voice carrying just enough edge to cut through his smugness. ""I'm interested in creating careers that last, not training programs that break people for sport.""

Direct hit. Boom. The room goes dead quiet, a few coaches are suddenly fascinated by their water bottles while Maria clears her throat and pivots to scheduling, but the damage is done.

George wasn‚Äôt used to being challenged. Especially not by me.

After the meeting, I didn‚Äôt linger and headed back to the gym to review footage. But when I walked past the floor area, Sienna was still there, running passes alone.

She didn‚Äôt notice me at first. Her hair was down now, clinging to the sweat on her neck. No music, just the soft echo of her landings and the faint sound of her breath.

The moves were cleaner than they‚Äôd been earlier, but the same tension held her shoulders rigid. Every step looked rehearsed, not felt.

When she notices me watching, her posture shifts almost imperceptibly. Not defensive exactly, but definitely guarded.

I don't approach‚Äîshe's not my athlete, and I've already stirred up enough trouble for one day.

But I see enough to confirm my worst fears.

Someone has systematically trained the joy out of this girl. She's all control, zero instinct. All performance, no presence.

Athletes like her burn out spectacularly, whether they make the Olympic team or not.

That night I pulled her training logs‚Äîsix months of detailed documentation that reads like a blueprint for athletic destruction. Overtraining schedules, obsessive weight tracking, zero flexibility in conditioning plans.

It's a masterclass in how to destroy a girl's relationship with her own body.

So the next morning, I brought the files to Maria‚Äôs desk.

""She's going to break,"" I say without preamble. ""This regimen isn't sustainable, especially with Olympic pressure ramping up. We adjust her training philosophy now, or we lose her completely.""

Maria sighs, suddenly looking every one of her forty-something years. ""George has her on a path that's produced results.""

""Short-term ones that'll destroy her long-term potential. Do you want her to win a medal, or survive this sport intact?""

She doesn't answer, which is an answer in itself.

I know I'm crossing every professional boundary by interfering with another coach's athlete. Stay in your lane, mind your business, don't rock the boat‚Äîthe unwritten rules are clear.

But what I see in Sienna, beneath all that manufactured polish and fear-based discipline, is raw talent that doesn't need to be broken down to reach elite level.

It needs nurturing. Building up instead of systematic destruction.

She needs protection.

Ford Callen moves through the gym like he's collecting evidence for a crime scene.

Most coaches announce themselves‚ÄîGeorge literally bellows his presence across three zip codes. But Ford? He's in pure stealth mode.

Silent, observing, watching me like I'm a technical problem he's already solved but wants to triple-check his math.

The internal negotiation starts immediately:¬†*Ignore him, stick to your routine, don't let some washed-up ex-gymnast mess with your head.*

Easier said than done when someone's laser-focused on cataloging every micro-mistake you make.

I'm running beam routines, trying to nail the sequences George drilled into me yesterday, but Ford's presence is like having a critic sitting in your brain. Not hostile‚Äîworse.

Completely detached.

Like he doesn't give a shit about impressing anyone, just wants to know what's broken and how to fix it.

Maya slides up during water break with that conspiratorial whisper of gymnasts perfect for sharing drama between rotations.

""He's totally jealous,"" she says, pressing a bottle into my hands. ""Coach Foster told us Ford never bounced back after his injury. Couldn't handle coaching real athletes, so now he's here playing bitter observer.""

""What pisses me off is how he just stands there,"" I say, taking a swig of water. ""Like he's collecting data for some psychology experiment. At least George tells you what's wrong. Ford just... staring. It's creepy as hell.""

""Right?‚Äù Maya nods eagerly. ‚ÄúLike, say something or fuck off, you know?""

""Exactly. The silent judgment thing is so much worse than just getting yelled at. At least yelling is honest.""

Here's the thing about George: he saved my ass when nobody else would.

Before him, I was the fragile ‚Äòtinee-tiny 5'2"" girl‚Äô coaches looked at and immediately started planning alternative careers for. Too small, too delicate, maybe try dance or rhythmic gymnastics instead of real gymnastics.

At twelve, I had a coach literally suggest I wasn't ""built for elite level."" Like my body was a design flaw instead of an instrument I was still learning to use.

But George saw something different. Told me I was special. Not just talented‚Äîspecial.

When I tore my ankle two years ago, it wasn‚Äôt my parents or my old coaches who fought for me, it was George. He made the calls. He kept my name in the running.

He made sure I stayed relevant.

His methods are harsh? Yeah. Sometimes they sting in ways that have nothing to do with physical training. But they work.

And in gymnastics, results are the only currency that matters.

""Tighten that pass,"" George's voice cuts across the gym like a blade. ""Landing was lazy. You're hesitating, and don't think I haven't noticed your weight creeping up. That's why your timing's off.""

The familiar knot forms in my stomach, but I don't respond. These aren't conversations, they're statements of fact from someone who genuinely believes he's saving me from bigger problems.

I've trained myself to hear warnings instead of insults. George isn't trying to hurt me, he's trying to keep me sharp. Focused. Aware of how quickly everything can fall apart if I get complacent.

""You're walking a fine line,"" he continues. ""This routine needs to be competition-ready by next week. Get back on the scale tonight. Track everything. No exceptions.""

I nod quickly, swallowing the tightness in my throat.¬†*This is how champions are made. This is the price of excellence.*

After practice, I stay behind for extra work because I know I haven't been clean enough. Haven't proven whatever I need to prove.

*Stay until it's perfect, stay until George would be proud, stay until you've earned tomorrow's training.*

That's when Ford materializes beside the beam like he's been waiting for this exact moment.

""Reyes,"" he says, tone completely neutral. ""Your aerial walkover's too vertical. You're killing your speed on the landing. Bring it lower, make it fluid instead of forced.""

I pause mid-setup, turning toward him with what I hope is polite dismissal. ""My technique's clean. Coach Foster taught me that sequence personally.""

His expression doesn't shift at all. No defensiveness, no ego, no indication that my loyalty to George bothers him. He just nods like my response was exactly what he expected.

""Just an observation,"" he says with a shrug. ""Do whatever works for you.""

Then he walks away like the conversation never happened. Like it doesn't matter whether I listen or completely ignore him.

The casual indifference is somehow more unsettling than if he'd argued with me.

I stand there, fists clenched, trying to process what just happened. I want to dismiss it completely‚Äîchalk it up to professional jealousy or whatever psychological damage Maya claims he's carrying around.

But something about how he delivered the feedback sticks in my head like a splinter.

No pressure, no emotional manipulation, no making it about him at all. Just technical input delivered with the enthusiasm of someone reading a grocery list.

And I hate that it's rattling around in my brain.

I've spent years training myself to tune out doubt, second-guessing, alternative opinions that could derail my focus. You have to in this sport.

Every coach has their own version of perfection, and none of them agree on what it looks like.

Ford doesn't know where I came from or what I've sacrificed to stay on this path. Doesn't understand the ecosystem George and I built together, the trust that carried me through injuries and setbacks and moments when quitting would've been easier.

So I push his words out of my head, reset my position, and launch into the sequence again.

But something shifts. Something subtle in how I approach the aerial, a slight adjustment I tell myself is coincidental. The landing feels different‚Äîsmoother, less jarring impact that usually leaves my ankles screaming.

*Fuck.*

The change didn't come from George's voice in my head. It came from Ford's casual, throwaway observation delivered like he was commenting on the weather.

I reset and try again, this time deliberately using George's original technique. The landing feels off‚Äîtoo much vertical force, exactly like Ford said.

I switch back to the adjustment, and it flows better.

*Double fuck.*

Watching Sienna Reyes train is like watching a Ferrari that's been programmed to drive exactly twenty-five miles per hour‚Äîtechnically flawless and completely fucking tragic.

She moves through George's brutal session with the kind of mechanical precision that wins medals and destroys souls. Form tight, transitions crisp, landings precise enough to satisfy a Swiss watchmaker.

But I'm not just watching the routine‚ÄîI'm cataloging the dysfunction.

Every smile after each pass is manufactured bullshit that doesn't reach her eyes. Every sequence ends with her gaze darting to George like a puppy waiting for scraps of approval.

When she doesn't get them, her shoulders bunch up around her ears like she's bracing for impact.

And then there's the way she lands‚Äîclean but cautious, like she's masking serious pain. The slight favor of her left leg, the micro-hesitations that most people would miss.

I've spent enough time around overtrained athletes to recognize the signs of someone whose body is staging a quiet rebellion.

Professional boundaries say stay in my lane. Basic human decency says this girl's about to break, and everyone's too invested in the status quo to give a shit.

When George steps away to take a phone call, probably coordinating another athlete's systematic destruction, I make my move.

Sienna's toweling off near the corner of the mat, jaw clenched like she's grinding her teeth to powder.

""Sienna,"" I say, keeping my tone neutral. ""That last floor series‚Äîif you adjust your elbow position slightly on the layout, you'll take pressure off your ankle. Might reduce strain long-term.""

She turns toward me with the kind of slow-burn fury that could melt steel.

""I know exactly who you are,"" she snaps, voice calm but loaded with practiced venom. ""You're the has-been who couldn't handle losing to Coach Foster. Now you're trying to crawl back by sabotaging his athletes.""

*Well, shit.*¬†That's not her voice‚Äîthat's George's greatest hits collection coming through her mouth. The loyalty is so blind it's practically weaponized.

""I don't need your help,"" she adds, like I'd offered to perform surgery on her grandmother. ""Keep your analysis to yourself.""

She walks off with perfect posture and enough suppressed rage to power a small city.

I let out a breath, run a hand over my neck, and just watch her go. Not surprised, but definitely impressed by the intensity of that verbal evisceration.

George has trained her well, not just in gymnastics, but in defending his methods against anyone who might suggest alternatives.

Later that day, I pulled up competition footage spanning her entire career. I want to see the full arc‚Äîwhere she started, what changed, when the light went out.

Her early routines are fucking beautiful.

She moves like she owns every inch of floor space, with an unpolished brilliance that makes her impossible to ignore. Raw talent wrapped in genuine joy for the sport.

But over time, something shifts. The spark gets systematically trained out of her, replaced with mechanical precision that's technically superior and emotionally dead.

Her power dulls, timing becomes too exact, like she's programmed out every instinct that made her special.

I slow the footage down frame by frame, hunting for details people miss.

Hand tremors between passes, delayed blinks that signal exhaustion, micro-adjustments that suggest chronic pain. All signs of an athlete being methodically run into the ground by someone who mistakes destruction for discipline.

If I could access her training logs, I'd have the full picture of exactly how far George has pushed her toward the breaking point. But that would require cooperation she's clearly not interested in providing.

The next morning, I get to the gym early because sleep is apparently optional when you're obsessing over someone else's impending athletic suicide.

Sienna's already there, of course she is; alone on the balance beam, moving through her routine with the kind of forced determination that screams¬†*""my body is betraying me but I'm pretending everything's fine.""*

Her ankle visibly gives out during the dismount. She catches herself before eating shit, but barely.

The wobble, the overcorrection, the way she immediately looks around to see if anyone noticed‚Äîclassic signs of someone training through serious injury.

I step forward, ready to call her off the beam before she does permanent damage, but Maria walks in wearing her ""everything's about to go sideways"" expression.

""Callen,"" she says, motioning me aside. ""George Foster was in a serious car accident last night. He's stable, but doctors say he won't be returning to coaching anytime soon.""

*Well, fuck.*¬†The universe has a twisted sense of timing.

""You'll be taking over his athletes,"" Maria continues. ""Effective immediately. Including Sienna Reyes.""

I don't flinch, but I'm not exactly celebrating either.

The last thing I want is inheriting someone else's athletes under these circumstances, especially one who thinks I'm the devil incarnate.

Sienna steps forward before I can process the full implications.

""I'd rather train alone than work with someone who's spent years trying to destroy my coach's career,"" she says, voice flat and cold as January pavement.

She starts to walk away, but her ankle wobbles on the landing. Not just soreness‚Äîthat joint is genui

A month later I picked up Assmil French With Ease and have been working my way through it. Currently, I have finished the passive phase (113 lessons) and I am on lesson 84 of the active phase. 

Here is my current method:

Shadow lesson 4x (no text); Shadow lesson 4x (with text); Read Notes; Make notes of important grammar points; Complete all exercises; Full translation of Assmil dialogue English ‚Äî> French 

2. Inner French Podcast (30 mins per day)
I listen to 1 episode per day while out walking. Once I reach every tenth episode, I loop back to the beginning (e.g., if I reach episode 20, I go all the way back to episode 1).

3. Anki Flashcards: (30 mins per day)

The audio recordings are on the front card. The text, translation and Assimil notes are on the back card.

4. Reading L‚Äô√©tranger by Camus alongside English translation (15 minutes)
I read a couple of pages a day alongside an English translation.

When I complete Assimil French With Ease, I plan to use Assimil Using French which is the next book in the series.

Ultimately, my language learning goal is to read classic French authors: Sartre, Camus, Voltaire, Proust etc.

After lunch, they x-rayed my leg, got me back to the room without any further information and then suddenly there were EMTs to take me home. I was completely unprepared, a nurse I had never spoken to before packed my bag, I was nauseous and exhausted and things seemed to just happen to me from that point on. I don't remember much. I was brought home, threw up next to my bed once I was on my own, called my angel of a home help not knowing what to do. She came and cleaned up despite being off the clock already. I went to bed before 9 pm and slept until after 10. I still feel weird and not quite awake and lucid.

1lgtirx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1lgtirx/revenge_on_my_hateful_husband_quick_summary_and/,Revenge on My Hateful Husband: Quick Summary and Reading Link Included,"**Just finished the story ‚Äî say something below if you need the link**

**Chapter 1**

""My birthday wish is for Phoebe to be my mommy,"" Estela Leon heard her daughter Rowena Leon say from behind the door.

She clutched her mouth, trying to muffle the sobs that broke out-Phoebe Silva was her husband Vance Leon's mistress.

She had already stolen Vance. Now, she wanted to take her children too.

But today was Rowena's birthday. Estela didn't want to ruin the celebration.

She wiped away her tears and stepped into the room with a gift. Rowena, who loved looking pretty, pulled away the moment she reached to touch her head.

""And Mommy, you have a cold. Stay away from me-don't mess up my hair. Phoebe did these braids. If they get messed up, she'll be upset.""

Estela watched Rowena and her son Josh Leon excitedly talk about making clothes for Phoebe. In the corner, a little doll meant to be ""Mommy"" lay forgotten, tossed aside.

Her chest tightened, and a bitter taste spread in her mouth.

She had been in a secret marriage with Vance for three years. To everyone else, Phoebe was seen as his rightful wife.

But after just a few months apart, even her own children-flesh and blood-now seemed to prefer another woman.

Estela lowered her eyes and stood in silence for a long while, only heading upstairs to shower and rest when the housekeeper quietly reminded her.

Just then, Vance's secretary arrived. He paused for a moment, surprised to see her.

""Ma'am, Mr. Leon won't be coming home tonight. He asked me to pick up the gift he prepared for Ms. Silva,"" the secretary said.

""Alright,"" Estela said softly.

Once the secretary left, a sharp pain shot through her chest.

He remembered to prepare a gift for Phoebe-but not once had he ever given her anything.

She dialed a video call.

It connected quickly.

""What is it?""

The screen showed Vance's private lounge.

Elegant, luxurious, bathed in dazzling light-every inch oozed the extravagance that Zrefast was known for.

He wore a six-figure tailored suit, held a wine glass, and lounged casually on the sofa.

There was nothing calculating about him-just cool elegance. His expression was calm, aloof, and untouchable, like frost or snow. He was the kind of man people dreamed of but could never reach.

Estela had loved him for six whole years.

Her voice softened. ""It's been a while since we saw each other. Tonight, maybe-""

""Vance-""

Before she could finish, a soft, feminine voice chimed in on his end.

It was Phoebe.

The call cut off immediately.

Just before the screen went black, Vance said simply, ""We'll talk later.""

Estela tightened her grip on the phone, staring out at the towering skyline beyond the window.

Cars streamed through the streets like rivers of light. The city shimmered-so bright and beautiful it almost didn't seem real.

Her husband, Vance, controlled a financial empire and moved markets with ease. But for her-his wife-he had no warmth, no time, no care.

Six years, and he'd never changed. Always cold. Always distant.

Behind every kind word or gentle look was a wall she could never get past.

She'd spent all these years trying to win back his heart.

But in that moment, for the very first time-Estela felt something shift. She was tired.

Estela didn't call him back. She drifted into a restless, heavy sleep.

The next day, Vance finally sent a message: \[Sorry. Happy third anniversary.\]

Then another: \[This is to make up for it.\]

Not long after, a bank alert came through-an eight-figure deposit.

She scrolled past the messages, just as a notification popped up from Phoebe's social media.

\[A custom-made diamond ring from Egoset-eight months in the making. A once-in-a-lifetime piece. Thank you, Mr. Leon.\]

In the post, Phoebe was all smiles, radiant and charming. A dazzling diamond sparkled on her pale, delicate hand.

Dressed in a rose-red gown, she posed beneath a famous tower, the fabric swirling around her like wine. The whole image screamed luxury, decadence-and intention.

Estela suddenly remembered the day before she married Vance.

It was in the family's quiet, old estate. He'd walked past her along the corridor. His eyes were calm, unreadable-but they had seen straight through her illusions.

He said, ""I'll marry you. But that's all.""

Back then, she'd thought the line ""I want love, not money"" sounded childish-naive, even.

But now, for the first time, she got it.

For six years, she'd chased a fantasy-thinking all she wanted was his love.

And she'd never had it.

She forced down the emotions building inside her and quietly went downstairs.

In the garden, she heard Rowena's innocent, sing-song voice, laced with a hint of complaint. ""Why did Mommy come back? Phoebe promised to take us to see the bear ballet today. I wish Mommy just never came back.""

**Chapter 2**

""Yeah,"" Josh said softly, eyes downcast. ""Billy said Daddy only married Mommy because he couldn't marry Phoebe. Mommy's pretty, but I still like Phoebe more.""

The words hit Estela like ice water down her spine-sharp, sudden, cruel.

'He couldn't marry her?' she thought.

The shock took a moment to fade, and when it did, her heart felt hollow.

She looked at her children.

She'd nearly died giving birth to them-both times. Complications, hemorrhaging.

They'd been weak, sickly babies, and she'd cared for them around the clock. Barely slept, barely ate. It ruined her health.

Then something happened in Zrefast. Vance's father Reggie Leon fell gravely ill.

Vance went back to take charge-and brought the kids with him.

Since then, she'd been traveling back and forth between two cities. But every time she came back, the children seemed farther and farther away.

She didn't even remember how she got back to her room.

The kids had private lessons scheduled. The nanny took them out.

Even with everything on her plate, Estela messaged Vance again to ask for a meeting.

She was his wife. Whether it was about the kids or about Phoebe, she had every right to demand answers.

But he brushed her off with a single line. ""I have something important. Let's talk tomorrow night.""

There was no way to describe the bitterness welling up inside her.

She left the house without thinking and wandered to the place where she and Vance had first met-an old amusement park.

It was small, tucked away in a corner of the city.

Just as she stepped in and approached the Ferris wheel, she heard a familiar little voice. ""Phoebe, I want to ride the Ferris wheel!""

""Okay, I'll go get the tickets.""

Estela looked up-and there they were.

Not far away, Phoebe and Vance, each holding one of her children's hands. They looked, unmistakably, like a perfect family.

Soon, Estela heard her children's voices. ""You're the best. I want to be with you forever.""

Phoebe laughed softly, teasing, ""If your mom hears that, she won't be happy.""

""I don't like her. Why should I care if she's mad?""

The words hit Estela like a blast of arctic wind.

She stood frozen, watching in silence as Vance and her children walked hand in hand with Phoebe into the Ferris wheel.

The man she had loved for six years. The children she had brought into the world.

Without another moment's hesitation, Estela turned and walked away.

She'd been holding on for six years-it was time to let go.

Back at the old house, she quietly packed up all of her belongings.

Then she sent Vance one final message: \[Have the divorce papers ready.\]

She left her wedding ring on the nightstand, walked out without a backward glance, and called a cab to the airport.

\*\*\*\*\*

After leaving the church, Vance returned to the old house with the children.

The area outside the church was packed. Just as he was about to check his phone, someone shouted-

""Stop! Thief!""

A commotion erupted.

The bodyguards instinctively moved to shield him, but in the chaos, Phoebe was shoved forward-right into Vance's arms.

His phone slipped from his hand, crashed to the ground, and was crushed under the stampede of feet.

""Vance, I'm so sorry-your phone."" she said.

He frowned briefly, then said calmly, ""It's fine. I'll get another one.""

The phone was mostly used to keep in touch with family anyway.

Not that anyone in the Leon family texted much. If anyone messaged him at all, it was usually Estela.

But her messages had never seemed urgent.

\*\*\*\*\*

On the way home, the kids were buzzing with excitement.

Rowena tugged on his sleeve, eyes sparkling. ""Daddy, is Phoebe really going to stay with us soon? She promised to take me to Candyland!""

Even Josh looked hopeful.

""Yes,"" Vance nodded.

But Josh hesitated, frowning slightly. ""But Daddy. Mommy said we're not very healthy, and the air at Candyland might make us sick. She didn't want us to go. Won't Mommy be upset if she finds out Phoebe's moving in?""

Vance responded gently, ""Phoebe is trained in medicine. She once saved Daddy's life. With her here, you'll both be fine. Your mommy won't be staying long anyway. Phoebe's just visiting for a while to help take care of you.""

The kids had always been frail. Having Phoebe around might actually do them some good.

""Yay!"" They both shouted in delight as they arrived home.

But the moment they stepped inside, they found something that made them even happier-Estela had gone back to Trurgh.

Vance noticed the wedding ring placed neatly on the nightstand and paused, mildly surprised.

Ever since they got married, no matter how badly they fought, Estela had never taken off that ring.

**Chapter 3**

Now she had left without a word-and taken the ring off, too.

'Is she upset again? Feeling neglected?' he thought.

Estela had always been gentle and soft-spoken-like most women from Trurgh, traditional and reserved. No matter how coldly he treated her, she never pushed back.

'Well, even the calmest person has a breaking point,' he thought.

Still, Vance didn't take it too seriously.

He tossed the ring aside without a second thought.

""Mrs. Leon won't be coming back for a while. Pack up her things. Clean out the room-Ms. Silva will be moving in soon,"" he ordered.

Rowena and Josh's eyes instantly lit up.

'Now that Mom is gone, Phoebe can finally move in,' they thought.

'And no one would be breathing down our necks anymore-asking the doctors endless questions about our physical activity.'

'Mom always makes such a big deal out of everything. She insists we meet our monthly exercise quotas and hovers over us every time she comes home.'

""It's just a pity,"" Josh muttered gloomily. ""Mom said she'd help us finish building that spaceship. It's super hard.""

The puzzle had thousands of tiny pieces. Once completed, it would become an intricate model of a spaceship. Josh had been planning to give it to Phoebe as a birthday gift.

But it was exhausting and hard on the eyes-he'd been waiting for Estela to help.

Rowena pouted too. ""She was supposed to finish sewing clothes for my doll before she left.""

Every time Estela came back, she'd make a whole new wardrobe for the dolls. Phoebe always said how good Estela was at picking fabrics and matching colors.

But this time, Estela left so suddenly that the clothes weren't ready.

Now Phoebe wouldn't see them, and there'd be no compliments.

Estela wasn't as fun or glamorous as Phoebe, but when it came to fiddly little projects like this-she was actually really good.

\*\*\*\*\*

Meanwhile, in Trurgh-miles away-Estela returned to the home she once shared with Vance.

After he moved back to Zrefast with the kids, Estela had stayed behind. Officially, it was for work, but in truth, it was mostly to care for his parents.

Reggie had long settled in Zrefast, but the rest of the family had moved to Trurgh over a decade ago.

High society in Zrefast had its own rigid rules-everything from dress codes to dinner etiquette was micromanaged.

Rosalyn Leon never got along with Reggie and had no interest in returning to that life. She was used to being pampered and calling the shots-and preferred life in Trurgh, where things went her way.

The Leon family wasn't fond of women who were too outspoken or ambitious, so for Vance's sake, Estela had kept a low profile and stayed behind as the dutiful daughter-in-law.

Her job at Leon Group had always been in name only.

But now that she had made up her mind to divorce Vance, none of that mattered anymore.

She packed up everything in their marital home and prepared to hand over the keys.

Just as she came downstairs, suitcase in hand, the butler happened to see her.

""Mrs. Leon, you're back. Rosalyn mentioned she was craving that fish soup you made last time.""

But when he saw the luggage, he froze mid-sentence.

Estela handed him the house keys.

""I won't be living here anymore,"" she said with a faint smile. ""If she wants soup, tell her to hire a chef.""

Without waiting for a response, Estela turned and walked out-ignoring the butler's stunned expression.

That night, Rosalyn didn't get her fish soup.

\*\*\*\*\*

Later that evening, Vance video-called Rosalyn. She didn't waste time voicing her discontent.

""Honestly, you never should've married a woman from Trurgh. Can't even cook a simple dish of fish soup,"" she said.

He looked mildly surprised.

Estela had always been respectful and compliant, especially toward elders. Her defiance this time? Unexpected.

""It's just a dish,"" he said indifferently. ""If she won't make it, get someone else who will.""

Rosalyn looked uncomfortable.

Truth be told, she'd already tried hiring several chefs-but none of them could get it quite right. Not like Estela did.

Still, she couldn't admit that in front of her son. She muttered a vague reply and left it at that.

Off to the side, the butler hesitated, unsure whether to say anything about Estela moving out of the house.

""Mr. Leon. Mrs. Leon, she. she's moved out.""

He barely got the words out before Vance cut him off, voice cold and flat. ""Forget it. Leave her alone.""

Vance ended the call without a second thought.

Through the floor-to-ceiling windows of his office overlooking Zrefast, a faint trace of annoyance flickered across his otherwise impeccable face.

He glanced at his newly replaced phone, but in the end, didn't call the contact at the top of his list.

**Chapter 4**

Back at the church, both his phone and SIM card had been destroyed.

At first, he'd intended to let Estela know-she was still his wife, after all.

But lately, it seemed all the special treatment he'd given her over the years had gone to her head.

A little lesson wouldn't hurt.

Unaware of any of this, Estela slept soundly through the night.

The next morning, she returned to the Leon Group and submitted her resignation.

It went through without a hitch.

When Vance had placed her in the company, it was a low-level, nominal role. No one really knew her true identity.

So once she completed her handover, she could leave cleanly.

When word got out, a coworker remarked with a knowing smile, ""Must be for your kids, huh? They're what, four? Five? That age clings to their mom like glue. You always had their pictures on your desk-and that necklace with their little faces on it. You've always treated them like treasures.""

Estela paused.

She had loved Vance-deeply. And naturally, she loved the two children they had together. Even now, separated by cities, she still cared deeply for Rowena and Josh.

But.

She shook her head, offering a small smile. ""It's not about them.""

And that was the truth.

The Leon Group was massive and well-connected internationally, but its focus-construction and real estate-was never her passion.

Before, as Vance's wife, she hadn't questioned it. The expectations from the Leon family left little room for her own ambitions.

But now that she had chosen to leave him, she needed to choose her own future.

Her gaze drifted to her phone, where a headline flashed across the screen. \[National Heritage Expo: The Fragrant Arts.\]

Perfume blending. Coffee ceremony. Modern reinterpretations of traditional craftsmanship.

Something about it caught her eye.

Without hesitation, she texted her cousin, Wilford Warren: \[Any chance you can get me a ticket to this event?\]

He responded almost instantly. \[Of course. But aren't you always too busy? Between the Leon family and the kids, when do you ever have time for this kind of thing?\]

\[I do now.\] Estela replied calmly. \[I'm divorced.\]

There was a pause.

\[Wait-seriously?\] Wilford's response came with a stunned breath. \[You actually divorced into that Leon family?\]

The same Leon family who had built a private rooftop amusement park in the heart of Zrefast-just for their grandchildren. No outsiders allowed.

Back when Estela's parents died, the only reason the Leon family even considered the marriage was because her grandfather Keven Warren had once done them a great favor.

Otherwise, no way would they have let Vance marry the daughter of a university professor.

Even if that professor's father was none other than Keven-the renowned scholar of classical arts.

\[If it doesn't feel right, walk away.\] Estela replied lightly, with a smile.

Wilford couldn't tell if he admired her courage or pitied her choices. Maybe a bit of both.

Wilford: \[But... what about Rowena and Josh? Can you really let them go?\]

Estela glanced at her phone.

When the kids had moved back to Zrefast, she'd made sure they each had a phone-just in case they missed her and wanted to call.

But over the past year, unless she reached out first, neither of them had ever called her.

They had everything now: a powerful family name, a life of privilege. and a woman they already saw as their mother.

'So why should I keep clinging to a connection that only exists in blood?' she wondered.

\*\*\*\*\*

Back in Zrefast, inside the Leon family's estate, the nutritionist gently reminded the children, ""Josh, Rowena, did you forget what Ms. Warren said? No being picky with food. Your bodies are still fragile-you need a balanced intake of fat to grow up healthy. And no overdoing it with sweets.""

Josh hesitated, looking uncertain.

But Rowena waved it off like it was nothing.

""Mom already missed her check-in call! She won't know anything. Besides, Phoebe said kids should be happy! And right now, the thing that makes me happiest is eating all these cupcakes!""

Just then, a light laugh floated down from upstairs.

Phoebe came down, smiling as she walked over and gently tapped Rowena on the forehead. ""You little troublemaker. Alright-whatever Rowena and Josh want, they can have.""

""Yay! Phoebe, you're the best! I wish you could stay with us forever!""

Their innocent cheers made Phoebe's smile deepen.

The nutritionist frowned. She opened her mouth to object, but when her gaze landed on Phoebe, she hesitated-and fell silent.

At first, she had assumed Estela was the lady of the house. But now it was clear: Phoebe moved around the Leon family like she belonged. The kids were clearly attached to her.

If she upset Phoebe, it might not sit well with Vance.

Josh, meanwhile, was conflicted.

**Chapter 5**

Last time he ignored Estela's advice, he ended up really sick.

Phoebe was sweet, and he did like her-but Estela had warned him that if he kept eating recklessly, he'd get seriously ill again, and Vance would be worried too.

He didn't want to cause either of them stress. So as he ate, he held back, choosing more carefully.

Rowena, however, wasn't as cautious. She ate too much-mixing cold and hot foods, creamy desserts, and sugary treats. By nightfall, she was doubled over in pain.

Curled up on her bed, she trembled from the stomach cramps. Her soft, pale face looked pitiful, flushed and tear-streaked.

When Vance heard Rowena wasn't feeling well, he rushed home immediately.

Rowena tugged on his sleeve with teary eyes and a trembling voice.

""Daddy. did I get sick because I was bad? Did Mommy punish me with a stomachache? She said if I ate too many cupcakes again, a witch would curse me. I didn't mean to. I want Mommy to come back and undo the spell."" she said.

More than anything, she missed how Estela would always make her warm soup whenever she was feeling sick.

Now, all she could do was cry, a mess of tears and runny nose.

Beside them, Phoebe bit her lip, looking guilty. ""Vance, I'm so sorry. I wasn't paying close enough attention. I let Rowena eat too many sweets.""

Rowena quickly jumped to her defense, worried her father might be upset with Phoebe. ""Daddy, it's not her fault! It's because Mommy forgot to call me! She doesn't care about me anymore.""

Josh blinked in confusion. Thankfully, he'd remembered what Estela said last time he got sick.

Even if Estela didn't laugh and play like Phoebe, she always paid close attention when it came to their health.

Still, since Phoebe was always so kind, he couldn't help but speak up for her too.

""Daddy. Mommy used to remind us a lot. Rowena's still little-she just forgets things sometimes.""

""Understood,"" Vance said, his tone a bit firmer now. ""From now on, both of you need to follow the nutritionist's instructions. No more sneaking snacks.""

He didn't blame Phoebe for what happened. In fact, he found himself even more frustrated with Estela.

'Isn't this exactly what she is supposed to be doing? She used to handle all of Rowena's meals and routines,' he thought.

But now that she couldn't even be bothered to check in properly, Rowena had gotten sick. As far as he saw it, this was on her.

Estela had no idea Rowena had been sick.

That Sunday, she still thought to check in and called the kids over video chat.

She was their mother, after all. Even if the emotional bond wasn't what it used to be, she still had a duty to them.

When the call came through, Rowena and Josh were busy helping Phoebe try on evening gowns.

In just a few days, Reggie would be discharged from the hospital.

Normally, that would mean Vance had no reason to stay in Zrefast and would head back to Trurgh to continue expanding the business.

But the idea of returning made the twins visibly glum.

They weren't ready to see Estela again. And they definitely didn't want to leave Phoebe.

Seeing their downcast faces, Phoebe smiled and gently ruffled their hair. ""Hmm. let me guess. Why are my little prince and princess so upset?""

She paused dramatically. ""Is it because we're heading back to Trurgh? I thought you'd be excited to see your mom again.""

Rowena's eyes welled with tears. She pouted and mumbled, ""What's so great about seeing Mom? We don't want to leave you.""

Josh nodded. He did miss Estela a little, but the thought of parting with Phoebe made him hesitate.

""Well then,"" Phoebe said with a playful glint in her eye, ""I have some good news.""

She let the suspense hang for a second, then smiled.

""I've got work to do in Trurgh. I'll be staying there for quite a while-so I'll be coming with you!""

""Really?"" Rowena lit up, cheering with joy. If Phoebe was coming to Trurgh too, then everything would be perfect.

Right at that moment, Estela's video call came through.

The ringtone echoed a few times. Rowena stared at the screen, then deliberately let it ring out before hanging up.

Estela called again. And again.

Annoyed, Rowena finally blocked the number.

Phoebe chuckled and gave her a gentle poke on the forehead but didn't scold her. ""Rowena, why didn't you answer your mom's call?""

""She didn't call me the other day on purpose, and I got sick. She's so mean-I don't want to talk to her!"" Rowena pouted.

Besides, they'd be going back to Trurgh soon. She'd see Estela then anyway.

And if Estela found out Phoebe was moving in, she'd definitely be upset.

**Chapter 6**

Rowena didn't want anyone messing with her and Phoebe's time together.

Phoebe pinched her cheek with a warm smile. ""As long as our little princess is happy, that's all that matters.""

Josh had a fleeting sense that something about all this wasn't quite right. But when he saw the calm expression on Phoebe's face, his doubt faded.

Vance always said Phoebe was special-not like other women.

And if she didn't think Rowena had done anything wrong, then maybe it really wasn't a big deal.

Besides, they'd be seeing Estela again soon anyway.

On the other end of the line, Estela stared at the red exclamation mark on her phone screen, stunned.

This was a phone she had specially set up just for the twins.

No one else used it. No one else had access.

She'd known their relationship had grown distant since they'd gone to Zrefast-but she never imagined they would block her.

Still worried, she called the housekeeper at the villa, the one in charge of the children's daily care.

""Ma'am, the children are doing great,"" the woman said cheerfully. ""Right now they're helping Ms. Silva try on dresses.""

The mention of ""Ms. Silva"" hit Estela like a pin to the chest.

Those were her children-children she had nearly died bringing into this world.

And now, they were looking to another woman for comfort and care.

""As long as they're okay,"" she replied quietly.

She didn't bring up the fact that her children had blocked her.

She knew their personalities-spoiled since birth, prone to sulking. Blocking her was just another form of acting out.

If this had happened before, she might have kept calling. Again and again. Refusing to give up.

But now. she found she no longer had the energy.

As long as they were safe and healthy, that was enough.

Whether or not they still saw her as their mother-that was no longer something she could control.

Two days later, Reggie was discharged from the hospital.

Vance soon made the decision to return to Trurgh and expand the Leon Group's presence there.

Before leaving, Rowena and Josh said their goodbyes to classmates at school.

The farewell gifts were chosen by Phoebe.

But the kids who received them didn't seem all that thrilled.

""Barbies and toy cars? These are kinda old now,"" one of their closest friends muttered. ""I liked those teddy bear cakes your mom made way better. Why didn't you bring those?""

Rowena pressed her lips together.

Those teddy bear cakes were Estela's specialty. They were complicated to make-Estela had burned her hands several times trying to get them just right.

But Phoebe didn't know how to make them. 'If only Mom were here.' Rowena thought.

Josh looked down too.

Ever since Rowena had blocked Estela's number, she hadn't called them once.

He hadn't heard her voice in what felt like forever-and honestly, he kind of missed her.

Still, he'd be seeing her soon.

But if Estela was back, that probably meant less time with Phoebe.

Vance had no idea what the kids were thinking.

When the housekeeper called to inform him, she said, ""Sir, Mrs. Leon hasn't been back to the villa for over a week. Would you like us to let her know you're returning?""

He frowned. His tone cooled immediately. ""No need. If she's not coming back, then clear out the master bedroom. I'll be moving in there with Rowena, Josh, and Phoebe.""

In the past, he'd only stayed in the marital home when visiting the children.

But since Estela insisted on giving him the cold shoulder, she had no business returning to that house.

Meanwhile, back in Trurgh, Estela had moved into her old apartment and started growing flowers on the balcony.

She wasn't particularly skilled at gardening, but maybe it was the peace of being on her own-or simply being free from her marriage-that made everything feel lighter.

Her neighbor, Cleveland, was quick to scold whenever he saw her plants. ""Girl, if you don't know how to grow flowers, stop drowning them! They're about to keel over!"" he'd grumble, beard twitching with annoyance.

After stepping in to rescue the plants himself, another neighbor pulled Estela aside, smiling apologetically.

""Don't mind the old man-he's been extra cranky lately. Word is his grandson's refusing to get married, and they had a big falling out. He stormed off and moved in here to cool down.""

Estela just smiled.

The Leon family had been steeped in strict rules and formality. She'd spent years tiptoeing around, doing everything to please them.

Cleveland might be grumpy and old-fashioned, but with his help, gardening suddenly felt more manageable.

Over time, the two formed an unexpected friendship, one that felt strangely comforting.

That evening, Estela got a message from Delia Allison, her senior from university.

**Chapter 7**

When Delia learned Estela would be attending the National Heritage Expo, she immediately suggested they go together.

Estela had studied design in college-sharp, creative, and full of fresh ideas. She had once joined Delia's design studio under the pseudonym Smile, contributing to several dazzling, standout projects.

But after marrying into the Leon family, she'd quietly stepped away.

Delia's studio, meanwhile, had steadily risen to prominence. It was no surprise she'd been invited to such a major industry event.

When Estela arrived, Delia was already surrounded by admirers, navigating the room like a star.

In recent years, she'd made quite a name for herself, with a strong presence in the design world.

People gravitated toward her effortlessly, eager to introduce themselves, eager to be seen.

A successful woman always shone brightest-men, in contrast, felt more like props in the background.

Estela watched from a distance and lowered her gaze.

For years, she had poured her heart into Vance and their children-so much so, she had nearly forgotten who she used to be.

'Could I still be that bold, brilliant designer I once was?' she wondered.

Just as the thought surfaced, Delia made her way over.

""This year's expo is really something. A lot of new talent showing up,"" she said with a knowing smile. ""Watching them today reminded me of you. Back when I tried to keep you at Allison Group-it's a shame how things turned out.""

Allison Group had been the name of Delia's college startup-the predecessor to her current firm.

Estela gave a small, bittersweet smile. ""Allison Group's doing just fine without me.""

In the world of design, fresh talent emerged constantly. No one could stay on top forever.

Besides, she hadn't been part of that world for years.

""I don't agree,"" Delia said, lighting a cigarette and finally saying what she'd been holding in all these years.

Estela looked up when she heard the words, her long lashes fluttering slightly as she gazed at the artwork on display.

Delia raised an eyebrow. ""The Rangel Group has been focused on developing a modern aesthetic these past couple of years - from jewelry to fashion. That just happens to be your area of expertise. Estela, I need you.""

Estela was no stranger to the Rangel Group.

In recent years, it had expanded rapidly, especially in traditional industries.

Its head, Wesley Rangel, though young, had already earned a reputation for being ruthless and calculating, with a sharp eye for the future.

It didn't surprise Estela that Delia was trying to team up with the Rangel Group to carve out a space in the design market.

'But... could I really go back to that world?' she wondered.

Just as the thought crossed her mind, a cold, aloof voice called out from nearby. ""Estela? Shouldn't you be taking care of Mom? What are you doing here?""

It was Thelma Leon- Vance's younger sister, and a star student at Choross University.

Ever since Estela married into the Leon family, Thelma had kept her at arm's length.

She had nothing but disdain for women like Estela - women who relied on men, buried themselves in housework, and, in her eyes, had no real worth.

Estela hadn't expected to run into her here.

She didn't offer much explanation. ""Just came to take a look.""

""These pieces have significant artistic value,"" Thelma said coolly. ""Even the simplest design here is probably beyond your understanding. My brother, Josh and Rowena will be back soon. You'd be better off focusing on them.""

To her, Estela was nothing special. Sure, she'd heard that Estela had a decent education and some design talent before marrying in, but in the end, she was just another woman who landed on her feet by marrying well. 'What real ability could she possibly have?' she wondered.

Estela stood frozen for a moment. 'Vance is coming back?' she thought.

Her fingers curled slightly, a trace of bitterness rising in her chest.

Even though they were getting divorced, he was returning with the child - and he hadn't even bothered to tell her.

In his eyes, the woman who had once been Mrs. Leon really didn't matter at all.

Thelma, never one for small talk with Estela, was about to leave when something crossed her mind - the fish soup Rosalyn had been craving.

""Oh, right,"" she said offhandedly. ""If you've got time, make some of that fish soup. You're not exactly busy, and your cooking's still passable.""

In the past, Estela would've agreed without a second thought.

Back then, she'd done everything she could to win the Leon family's approval. No matter how complicated the request, if Rosalyn asked for it, she'd make it happen.

But now? She didn't care anymore.

Ingreidents only found in the New World: Corn, potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassava, quinoa, amaranth; beans (pinto, black, kidney, lima), squashes, chilli peppers, bell peppers, tomatoes, peanuts, cashews, pecans; cacao/chocolate, vanilla, maple syrup, pineapple, bison, papaya, avocado, blueberries and turkey.
