1im9q08,https://v.redd.it/ayoa35dy5cie1,I get the Etheopian light roast hype,"Went to a local caf√© that sells local roast coffees and thought I'd try out a light roast etheopian coffee that I keep hearing about. So far I'm loving the nutty, fruity tastes of this roast. I'm pretty sure everyone smells there beens and they smell AMAZING. I love how I can taste exactly what I'm smelling with this roast, cherry, caramel, nuts, vanilla. When drinking the texture is also very light, I do wish it was more creamy/oily but I guess the oils aren't as extracted with light roasts? Acidity is also not overwhelming, it subtle and smoothly fades out. Overall very happy!

For the shot, I always do a 5sec pre-infusion, 18g in 36 out. 97¬∞c temp. This shot was a couple grams short as it's still being dialed in but came out great. I'm just not sure if the lack of oils is the reason it didn't merge together into a single stream from the portafilter? ",1,1739203882.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

1im9ogl,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfpublishing/comments/1im9ogl/looking_for_feedback_re_first_published_writing/,Looking for Feedback RE: First Published Writing / Children's Book,"Hey all,

Long story short; I've always had a fondness of writing, and since I recently opened my Coffee Shop; whenever I time I have been dedicating it towards writing. I write pretty much anything ranging from poetry to self-help affirmations, and I thought I'd give a go at a children's book. This has been a very useful outlet for me as the strains of starting a business has greatly taken a toll on my mental health. If I am able to hopefully help others with these works; it would make me feel all the more better.

I started my career within pediatrics healthcare i.e. occupational, speech, etc, and I was also an educator. Having been around teachers of all sorts, and having been one myself; I always fancied the idea of one day publishing works that could maybe be utilized for educators or therapists and help benefit children or students in general.

I am not necessarily looking to sell this to you; but I am looking to you all for guidance and constructive criticism. I appreciate any feedback very much.

It's just a simple e-book, but I have devised it to where it aligns and can be utilized for early development education (i.e. speech, occupational, etc).

Attached are the images showcasing the first few pages.

I‚Äôm looking for advice on how to best arrange this lounge space. I‚Äôve attached a few pictures of the room with dimensions. It‚Äôs a narrow, rectangular space, and I want to incorporate:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Option 1 ‚Äì A sofa and a coffee table (similar in length to the sofa).

2Ô∏è‚É£ Option 2 ‚Äì A sofa, a coffee table, and a TV stand.

Given the layout, I‚Äôm concerned about making the space feel functional and open without it looking too cramped. The fridge cannot be moved to another room but can be moved around here. Everything else can be moved elsewhere. The carpet part isnt a rug so its also fixed in its location. I am open to considering different sofa types and sizes as long as they dont make the place look weird.

Should I go for a floating arrangement with annoyingly weird amount of space behind it? If so, how to best make use of that space? Or push the sofa against the longer wall next to the fridge? Also, if I include a TV stand, where would be the best place to put it?

Wifey said reddit is the place to ask so here i am. Thanks in advance!

I‚Äôve used it daily as a centerpiece for my living room, and it‚Äôs quickly proven itself as more than just a decorative piece. Starting with its design, the table boasts a modern industrial vibe, combining a distressed ashwood finish on the top with a black metal frame. The mix of materials gives it a sleek yet rustic look, making it versatile enough to fit into contemporary and minimalist spaces alike. It feels like the kind of table that effortlessly pulls the whole room together without being overbearing.

The dimensions, 31.5 inches in diameter and 16 inches in height, make it just the right size for a standard living room. I‚Äôve found it functional enough for hosting movie-night snacks, stacking a couple of magazines, or simply serving as a casual laptop desk. Despite its compact stature, the table doesn‚Äôt feel too small. It balances space efficiency with utility, which is a big win for someone like me living in a medium-sized apartment.

Stability and sturdiness are always a concern with budget furniture, but this table pleasantly surprised me. The steel cross-frame base provides excellent support, and I haven‚Äôt noticed any wobbling, even with heavier items like a ceramic vase or books stacked on top. That said, the 100-pound weight limit ensures that you won‚Äôt overburden it, though it‚Äôs more than adequate for most coffee table purposes.

[Check Household Essentials 8079-1 Coffee Table price on Amazon.](https://decorgurus.com/product/household-essentials-8079-1-coffee-table-review-b01fxoljbq/)

Assembly was straightforward. I‚Äôm not exactly a DIY enthusiast, but this piece took me less than 30 minutes to put together. The package included all necessary hardware, and the instructions were easy to follow. The pre-drilled holes aligned perfectly, which is more than I can say for some other furniture I've assembled.

Maintenance is another area where this coffee table shines. The ashwood laminate top is resistant to spills and easy to clean. A damp cloth takes care of most minor messes without leaving streaks or marks. However, a lack of stain resistance means you‚Äôll need to be cautious with red wine or anything prone to leaving permanent stains.

**Pros**

* Stylish industrial design with a modern edge.
* Compact but functional size, ideal for small to medium spaces.
* Sturdy construction with a stable steel frame.
* Easy and quick assembly process.
* Low-maintenance surface that‚Äôs simple to clean.

**Cons**

* Laminate surface isn‚Äôt entirely stain-resistant.
* Slightly darker in real life than in online pictures.
* Packaging could be better to prevent minor scratches during delivery.
* Limited weight capacity of 100 pounds.

**Comparison to Competitors**  
I‚Äôve tested similar coffee tables from brands like IKEA and Sauder, and while they offer stylish options, none perfectly balance affordability and build quality like this one. IKEA‚Äôs tables in the same price range often feel less sturdy, with lightweight materials that can wobble over time. Sauder, on the other hand, tends to focus on heavier, more traditional designs, which can become bulky and harder to move around. What sets the Household Essentials coffee table apart is its combination of lightweight engineered wood and a steel frame that offers stability without the bulk.

However, if you‚Äôre looking for hidden storage, this table might fall short. Competitors like the SONGMICS Lift-Top tables offer additional storage compartments, making them a better choice for those needing extra space to stash remotes or board games. That said, the open-frame design of the Household Essentials table keeps the room looking airy, unlike storage-heavy options that can feel clunky.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**  
In terms of value, this coffee table hits the sweet spot. It‚Äôs affordable but doesn‚Äôt skimp on quality, making it a great investment for those on a budget. While there are cheaper options out there, many lack the durability or aesthetic appeal this table provides. The neutral taupe finish also ensures it blends seamlessly with most decors, reducing the need to replace it as trends change.

The absence of premium features like a lift-top mechanism or storage is noticeable but expected given the price point. If you‚Äôre after a no-nonsense, stylish coffee table that gets the basics right, this is an excellent choice.

Every feature of this table‚Äîfrom its sturdy base to its easy-clean surface‚Äîfeels well thought out. The round shape is a bonus for families with kids, as it eliminates sharp corners, making it a safer option. The distressed ashwood finish is not only pleasing to look at but also masks minor scuffs, which is particularly useful if you have pets or children.

As someone who juggles work, family, and a million daily tasks, having a coffee maker that caters to my caffeine needs has been a game-changer. While it‚Äôs not without imperfections, the combination of style, functionality, and versatility makes it worth diving into the details.

From the moment I unboxed this machine, it was clear that its design was carefully thought out. The matte Dark Charcoal finish adds a sleek, modern touch to my countertop, and despite its relatively large size (14.17""D x 17.32""W x 14.41""H), it doesn‚Äôt feel overly bulky. The build feels solid, though I noticed the water reservoir and frother lid have a somewhat flimsy quality. They require a bit of finesse during use, but nothing too concerning.

What stands out is how this coffee maker transforms ordinary mornings into an almost coffeehouse-like experience. Whether I want a quick cup of coffee or feel fancy enough for a creamy latte, this machine delivers. The brew options include sizes of 6, 8, 10, and 12 ounces and a special ""SHOT"" mode for concentrated brews. The frother is where the magic happens for me‚Äîit effortlessly whips up hot or cold milk froth, allowing me to create cappuccinos or iced lattes that rival my favorite caf√©.

[Check Keurig K-Cafe K-Cafe price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/keurig-k-cafe-k-cafe-review-with-model-b07c1xc3gf/)

The brewing performance impressed me the most. It‚Äôs quick, delivering my coffee in under a minute, and the ""Strong Brew"" setting provides that extra caffeine kick I often need on groggy mornings. I also tested the machine with various milk types‚Äîskim, soy, and almond‚Äîand it handled them all without issue, producing rich froth every time. My personal favorite is using almond milk on the cappuccino setting for a slightly nutty, frothy delight.

The controls are intuitive, too. With straightforward button functionality, I didn‚Äôt find myself flipping through a manual for hours. The ""Smart Start"" feature, which heats and brews in one seamless process, means I can hit the brew button and walk away without waiting for it to heat first. However, the frother buttons occasionally act finicky, requiring me to unplug and restart the machine‚Äîa minor frustration, but worth mentioning.

Cleaning is where this machine shines. The dishwasher-safe frother is a blessing, and the removable water reservoir simplifies refilling and cleaning. Descaling, while necessary periodically, isn‚Äôt overly complicated‚Äîsomething I appreciated after dealing with more cumbersome coffee makers in the past.

For households like mine, capacity matters. The 60-ounce water tank is a lifesaver, letting me brew six cups before needing a refill. Whether it‚Äôs for me, my partner, or when hosting friends, this capacity saves time and ensures everyone gets their caffeine fix.

**Pros**

1. Versatile brewing options (regular coffee, lattes, cappuccinos, iced drinks).
2. Frother delivers creamy, caf√©-quality milk froth with both hot and cold settings.
3. Large 60-ounce water reservoir minimizes refilling.
4. User-friendly interface and ""Smart Start"" feature.
5. Dishwasher-safe frother simplifies cleaning.

**Cons**

1. Some parts, like the water reservoir and frother lid, feel flimsy.
2. Frother buttons occasionally malfunction, requiring resets.
3. The coffee could be a bit hotter, especially when paired with frother use.
4. Larger size may take up significant counter space in smaller kitchens.

**Comparison to Competitors**

The Keurig K-Cafe K-Cafe stands out for its ability to brew both coffee and specialty drinks, but how does it compare to similar machines? The Nespresso VertuoPlus, for instance, excels in espresso brewing and offers a more compact design. However, it lacks the versatility of brewing traditional coffee or accommodating reusable filters like the Keurig does. Meanwhile, the Breville Bambino Plus delivers a more authentic espresso experience with a professional steam wand but comes with a steeper learning curve and higher maintenance.

Where the Keurig wins is in its simplicity and accessibility. It bridges the gap between casual coffee drinkers and budding baristas. Unlike competitors that may focus solely on espresso or coffee, the K-Cafe offers the best of both worlds. That said, it does fall short in terms of durability compared to Breville‚Äôs more robust models, and its frothing isn‚Äôt quite as consistent as Nespresso‚Äôs Aeroccino.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

While the Keurig K-Cafe K-Cafe isn‚Äôt the cheapest coffee maker on the market, its features justify the investment. The price sits comfortably between budget single-serve machines and high-end espresso makers, making it an excellent choice for those seeking versatility on a mid-range budget. Given its ability to brew multiple drink types, accommodate reusable filters, and include a frother, it offers solid value for money. Just keep in mind that recurring expenses, like buying K-Cup pods or ground coffee, can add up over time.

One feature that enhances its value is compatibility with the ""My K-Cup Universal Reusable Coffee Filter,"" allowing me to use my favorite ground coffee instead of K-Cup pods. This not only saves money but also reduces waste‚Äîsomething I value as an environmentally-conscious consumer.

The Keurig K-Cafe has become a cherished companion in my kitchen. From creating quick morning pick-me-ups to indulging in frothy lattes on lazy weekends, it‚Äôs proven itself to be a reliable and versatile coffee maker. Sure, it‚Äôs not perfect, but for its price point, it delivers a coffee experience that feels far more premium than expected.

My name is Cassie. My daughter‚Äôs name is Lia. 

I was having coffee, it was a normal 10:00am Saturday morning. She comes up to me, looks me dead in the eyes and smiles. I smile back at her, thinking she is just being cute. Her face goes from happy to pure horror. She says, whimpering, ‚Äúyour one too?‚Äù Which confused the hell out of me. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I said, feeling shivers down my spine. ‚ÄúHoney, what do you mean? I smiled at you?‚Äù And she looked blank at me. ‚ÄúOh! I was- uh- thinking about stuff in my book! Love you mummy!‚Äù And she ran to her room. Later, she came and smiled at me again. I did not return the look and she looked sad. I had seen that she had a camera which I had never given her, and nobody had been round to give her it. Something was up. ‚ÄúGive it. Now.‚Äù I demanded. Following this up, she refused to do so and I snatched it. She ran upstairs screaming, ‚ÄúDADDY!!!‚Äù Which made me shiver. ‚ÄúHoney? You can have it back! Come back!‚Äù I said, needing to reassure myself. I was met with silence. I went up to investigate, and I peeked through her door since I heard noise. I saw a tall, slim figure stumbling about, and she looked like her one second, like the monster another. ‚ÄúA mimic.. I responded to her, several times‚Ä¶‚Äù I muttered. After this, I left the house, locked the door, and went to my car. I have never driven faster, and when I say that, I mean I broke the limit. Then my fear was met. The figures were behind me. ‚ÄúMummy don‚Äôt leave me..‚Äù she said, turning back to her.
‚ÄúMiss me honey?‚Äù The figure said, turning in to her father. 
I screamed and drove faster, and they stood there staring at me, eyes fully white. I went to the first house I saw and let myself in. ‚ÄúILL EXPLAIN IN A MINUTE.‚Äù I said loudly, slamming the door. I then explained it to them and they understood somehow. They helped me hold the door, and at this point I was crying so hard. My poor baby was suffering and I wasn‚Äôt helping her. But I couldn‚Äôt. She wasn‚Äôt my baby, she was a mimic. She began to bang on the door, nearly smashing it. ‚ÄúMUMMY HELP ITS COMING!‚Äù She screamed, then silence. Dying noises were all I heard. I looked out, my daughter was crying and no figure was there. ‚ÄúMUMMY IM SCARED!‚Äù She was balling her eyes out and I opened the door. I had imagined it all. I was crazy. 
‚ÄúDONT DO THAT AGAIN PLEASE MUMMY!‚Äù She said screaming and crying and nuzzling into me. 
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go home‚Ä¶‚Äù I said, rushing to the car, carrying my daughter. I was crazy. Then I saw it. She lashed out on me. Attacked me. I had matched nearby and burnt her fully, before making marshmallows. I hadn‚Äôt cared at all. I never liked the rat. Then I felt like I was mimicking something. I was a mimic too.

1im9dsu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1im9dsu,The PS1 Games That Some Countries Loved and Others Ignored,"

I was born in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. In my city, gaming clubs were, and still are, insanely popular. This was likely due to the low standard of living‚Äîmost parents simply couldn‚Äôt afford to buy a gaming console for their kids.

Back in the '90s, these gaming clubs were awful. They were set up in basements, private houses, and even garages. There was no comfort at all‚Äîjust old TVs, broken chairs, and no air conditioning or fans in the unbearable 50¬∞C (122¬∞F) heat.

As years passed, consoles evolved, and gaming clubs transformed into comfortable entertainment hubs. Even today, you can find PS5 gaming clubs in Tashkent, some equipped with projectors and high-quality sound systems. The most played games? Football simulators and fighting games. Many of these clubs also serve alcohol and hookah.

But I want to talk about the games that were popular back when all these clubs had PSX consoles and I was just a school kid spending countless hours there. Some of these games you‚Äôll recognize, but others have been almost forgotten. And those are the ones I want to highlight!

Rogue Trip: Vacation 2012

The vehicular combat genre was always a hit in gaming clubs. Everyone played Twisted Metal and Vigilante 8. But there was another contender that, for a brief moment, managed to outshine them.

Rogue Trip: Vacation 2012 was developed by the same studio behind Twisted Metal. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic 2012 (which, in hindsight, was a pretty optimistic prediction). The characters and their vehicles were extremely memorable, and there was even a flying car, which added some variety to the gameplay.

Visually, the game was on par with Twisted Metal, but the objective was different. Instead of simply destroying your rivals, you had to compete to pick up a single passenger on the map to earn money. Though, to be fair, you could also make money by blowing up everything in sight. There was even a way to destroy the entire planet, which instantly ended the game.

One thing that stuck with me was the soundtrack‚ÄîI still listen to some of the tracks today. I honestly don‚Äôt understand why this game didn‚Äôt become as popular as Twisted Metal. Then again, I don‚Äôt understand why the vehicular combat genre disappeared altogether. If you‚Äôve never played Rogue Trip, you should definitely give it a try!

Hogs of War

When it came to multiplayer games, Worms Armageddon was the undisputed king. We spent years battling each other, creating countless memories. But at some point, we needed something fresh.

Enter Hogs of War. As the developers themselves put it: ""It‚Äôs like Worms, but with pigs and in 3D!""

The game was both challenging and hilarious. It copied Worms in many ways but also introduced some new mechanics‚Äîcharacter progression and different soldier classes, for example. The catch? To unlock all weapons, you had to complete the single-player campaign.

Luckily, I managed to get my hands on a save file with the campaign fully completed. I struck a deal with a gaming club‚Äîif I gave them the save file, my friends and I could play for free for a few hours.

Looking back now, after all the failed attempts at 3D Worms games, I would never trade Worms Armageddon for anything. But at the time, 3D felt new and exciting, and Hogs of War was a great product of that era.

Thrill Kill

Now, here‚Äôs a game that was never officially released. Yet, you could find it on pirated discs. In my city, almost every gaming club had it.

So, what made Thrill Kill so special? Well, for starters, it was insanely violent. You played as maniacs and psychopaths trapped in hell, fighting for a second chance at life.

Everyone loved Mortal Kombat, mostly for its fatalities. So when we heard about a game that was supposedly even more brutal, we lost our minds. But was it really more violent? Not exactly.

Sure, the characters were grotesque, and the game leaned heavily into sexual and sadistic themes. But the finishing moves weren‚Äôt necessarily more brutal or creative than Mortal Kombat‚Äôs.

The combat system was interesting, though. Instead of a health bar, there was a ‚Äúrage meter‚Äù that filled up with successful attacks. Once it maxed out, you could execute an opponent‚Äîif they didn‚Äôt escape in time. The fights were chaotic, with four characters battling in a fully 3D arena. Unfortunately, due to the small map sizes and limited move sets, the game quickly became repetitive.

Still, it stood out among other fighting games of the time. It‚Äôs a shame it never got an official release.

Pepsi Man

We didn‚Äôt know the term ‚Äúrunner‚Äù as a genre back then. And not everyone could afford to play for long. The minimum gaming session was 15 minutes, which wasn‚Äôt enough to dive into a complex game.

Enter our savior‚ÄîPepsi Man.

More of an interactive ad than a full-fledged game, Pepsi Man was a bizarre but addictive experience. First, you‚Äôd watch a funny live-action Pepsi commercial. Then, you‚Äôd control Pepsi Man, running through chaotic environments, dodging cars, and crashing through obstacles, all while collecting Pepsi cans.

At first, only little kids played it. But soon, older gamers wanted to prove they could beat it without losing a life, and they got hooked too.

I only recently learned that Pepsi Man was a Japan-exclusive release. But the entire game sound was in English, so pirates had no trouble spreading it. That‚Äôs one of the best things about growing up with bootleg games‚Äîthere were no regional restrictions. We got to experience titles that never made it outside Japan. And Pepsi Man was one of them.

Boasting stainless steel blades and a one-touch push-button control, this small device promised consistent grinds for coffee lovers and spice enthusiasts alike. As someone who grinds coffee beans daily for that morning kick, I dove right into exploring the grinder's features.

The design strikes a balance between simplicity and functionality. It‚Äôs lightweight, sitting comfortably on my crowded kitchen counter without drawing too much attention. The stainless steel finish gives it a modern look, but it doesn‚Äôt feel overly flashy. At 3.5"" x 3.4"" x 7.28"", it‚Äôs compact enough to store easily but sturdy enough to stay put during use. The lid-locking safety feature deserves a shout-out‚Äîit ensures the grinder won't start unless the lid is secured, which saved me from a potential powdery mess when my nephew decided to ""help.""

[Check BLACK+DECKER CBG110S Coffee Grinder pricing on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/blackdecker-cbg110s-coffee-grinder-review-b07z8g97py)

Using the grinder was straightforward. The push-button mechanism means there are no confusing dials or settings. Just press, wait, and release. While grinding coffee beans, I noticed how quickly it worked, delivering a consistent grind in mere seconds. However, I quickly learned that getting the perfect texture required a bit of trial and error, as holding the button too long could turn beans into overly fine powder.

The grinding mechanism itself is a blade system. While it‚Äôs not as precise as a burr grinder, the stainless steel blades deliver remarkable uniformity, especially for its price. It‚Äôs versatile, too‚ÄîI tested it with spices and nuts, and it handled them with ease. That said, cleaning the grinder isn‚Äôt as simple. Since the grinding bowl isn‚Äôt removable, I had to carefully wipe it out, which felt a bit tedious after grinding spices with strong aromas.

**Pros**

1. Compact and lightweight design, perfect for small kitchens.
2. Simple one-touch operation, ideal for quick grinding tasks.
3. Versatile use for coffee, herbs, spices, grains, and nuts.
4. Lid-locking safety feature prevents accidental messes or spills.
5. Durable stainless steel blades provide consistent grinding.

**Cons**

1. Cleaning is somewhat challenging due to the non-removable grinding bowl.
2. Limited capacity might not suit larger households.
3. Noise level can be noticeable, especially during early mornings.
4. Blade design lacks the precision of a burr grinder.

**Comparison to Competitors**

Compared to burr grinders like the Baratza Encore, the BLACK+DECKER grinder falls short in precision. Burr grinders cater to coffee aficionados who demand specific grind sizes for brewing methods like espresso or pour-over. However, the BLACK+DECKER model shines in its versatility and price point, making it a better fit for casual users or those who want a multi-use grinder for spices and herbs. Against other blade grinders, like the Hamilton Beach Fresh Grind, the BLACK+DECKER edges ahead with its safety features, though the Hamilton Beach offers quieter operation and a removable bowl for easier cleaning.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

For its price, the BLACK+DECKER CBG110S Coffee Grinder delivers solid performance. It‚Äôs not an investment for coffee connoisseurs but rather a budget-friendly option for everyday households. Considering the safety features, durability, and multipurpose use, it offers great value for casual users. However, those who prioritize precision and ease of cleaning may want to explore higher-end alternatives.

Every feature of this grinder feels thoughtfully designed for convenience. From the intuitive push-button control to the compact size, it seamlessly integrates into daily routines. Its ability to handle a variety of ingredients‚Äîcoffee beans, spices, nuts‚Äîmakes it more than just a coffee grinder, turning it into a reliable kitchen assistant.

# Umirin's Unwavering Indifference and Taki‚Äôs New Persona After Growth

‚Äî‚ÄîThe TV anime¬†BanG Dream! Ave Mujica¬†(hereinafter referred to as¬†Ave Mujica) presents shocking developments in every episode. What are your overall impressions of the story?

**Hayashi:**¬†Initially, I was a bit worried that longtime¬†*BanG Dream!*¬†fans who started with¬†*BanG Dream! It's MyGO!!!!!*¬†(hereinafter referred to as¬†*It‚Äôs MyGO!!!!!*) might find it hard to accept.¬†*It‚Äôs MyGO!!!!!*¬†depicted the realistic journey of a high school girls‚Äô band, while¬†*Ave Mujica*¬†is a dark fantasy suspense series‚Äîthe contrast between the two is just too drastic‚Ä¶ However, the response on social media has been overwhelmingly enthusiastic, with comments like, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait for the next episode!‚Äù I‚Äôm really glad that everyone is enjoying it.

**Okada:**¬†The scene where Mutsumi's consciousness is swallowed by the alter ego Mortis was completely dark fantasy. Seeing such developments within the¬†*BanG Dream!*¬†universe was a huge shock for me as well, but that very moment was what firmly established¬†*Ave Mujica*‚Äôs unique world-building.

‚Äî‚ÄîBy Episode 6, have you noticed new sides of Umirin and Taki?

**Okada:**¬†Up until now, Umirin has remained indifferent to everything, rarely showing emotions. Many viewers have commented, ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt get her at all.‚Äù It‚Äôs true‚Äîthe anime hasn‚Äôt explicitly revealed her motives for joining Mujica or her inner thoughts. As a band member, she gives her all in performances and even handles scheduling and other tasks diligently, yet she deliberately keeps her emotional distance. Even when Mujica disbanded in Episode 4, she just accepted it calmly. This very attitude hints at her having a complicated past.

**Hayashi:**¬†But that level of indifference was way too extreme! Even Taki couldn‚Äôt help but call her out, saying, ‚ÄúUmirin, are you even taking Mujica seriously?‚Äù‚Äîthat reaction was just too real.

**Okada:**¬†Exactly! After hearing that, Umirin dropped her usual honorifics for the first time and muttered in frustration, ‚ÄúWhat exactly are you trying to say‚Ä¶?‚Äù‚Äîa moment that really left an impression. It was as if Taki had hit on a sore spot that Umirin had always been avoiding. But in my view, Taki‚Äôs choice not to press further was a display of her unique kindness‚Äîbecause overcoming Umirin‚Äôs reluctance to communicate is something she has to realize for herself. Knowing this, yet still caring for Umirin in her own way, Taki‚Äôs thoughtfulness really moved me.

**Hayashi:**¬†Umirin has a wide social circle, but Taki is probably the only one who speaks to her so bluntly. Through¬†*It‚Äôs MyGO!!!!!*, Taki came to understand that a band is not just about playing music together‚Äîit‚Äôs about connecting on a deeper level and growing as a unit. That‚Äôs why she‚Äôs determined to wake Umirin up from her emotional detachment. This growth of hers is truly remarkable. And despite Taki‚Äôs usual awkwardness, she shares an unspoken understanding with Umirin, as if saying, ‚ÄúYou get what I mean, right?‚Äù

**Okada:**¬†Exactly! If it were anyone else, they‚Äôd probably just laugh it off, but because it was Taki, it really struck a chord.

**Hayashi:**¬†That being said, even though Taki has matured a lot, she still turns into a total mess in front of Tomori. Normally, she‚Äôs perceptive and level-headed, but when it comes to Tomori, she can‚Äôt see anything else. Like that time when Tomori murmured, ‚ÄúWhat exactly is happiness‚Ä¶?‚Äù and Taki, all flustered, responded, ‚ÄúI-I‚Äôm happy right now, okay!?‚Äù‚ÄîI couldn‚Äôt bear to watch (laughs).

**Okada:**¬†That gap between Taki‚Äôs usual coolness and her awkward moments is just too good! I absolutely love that kind of charm (laughs).

# Surprisingly Close!? The Relationship Between Umirin and Taki

‚Äî‚ÄîCompared to before, Umirin and Taki seem to have grown closer. How do you see their relationship?

**Hayashi:**¬†They don‚Äôt go out of their way to please each other, and they even throw in some occasional jabs, but that ‚ÄúYou two are actually super close, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù kind of vibe is amazing. I‚Äôve always loved cool beauty-type characters, so I‚Äôve been a Taki fan from the start. In fact, her lines often feel like they‚Äôre speaking directly to me‚Äîit‚Äôs a weird feeling (laughs).

**Okada:**¬†Wait, really!? If you weren‚Äôt voicing Taki, would you still be her fan?

**Hayashi:**¬†Definitely! I‚Äôd 100% be a Taki fan!! Plus, I absolutely love Umirin‚Äôs cool aura‚Äîher stage outfit, like the jodhpurs, is insanely stylish. And seeing how effortlessly „ÇÅ„ÅÑ„Åó„ÇÉ„Çì (Okada) pulls it off always makes me think, ‚ÄúWow, she‚Äôs so cool!‚Äù

**Okada:**¬†Whoa\~ Thank you!

**Hayashi:**¬†But the best part is that Umirin only shows her affectionate side to Taki!

**Okada:**¬†Taki really is the only one Umirin acts spoiled around. There‚Äôs a scene in¬†*It‚Äôs MyGO!!!!!*¬†where Umirin tells Taki, ‚ÄúCome to me if you ever need anything,‚Äù but Taki just replies, ‚ÄúThat won‚Äôt be happening anymore.‚Äù And yet, Umirin still smiles and says, ‚ÄúI see.‚Äù That moment was incredibly heartwarming‚Ä¶ It made me wish I could be one of their classmates and experience that atmosphere firsthand (laughs).

**Hayashi:**¬†Umirin‚Äôs smile is such a rare sight. And in Episode 4, when Taki lent her notebook to Umirin, who was too busy with Mujica activities, that scene left a strong impression on me. I originally thought Umirin had no friends at school, but it turns out their bond is surprisingly strong.

**Okada:**¬†Taki really helped Umirin out there. It‚Äôs wonderful to get glimpses into their everyday lives.

‚Äî‚ÄîWhat should we look forward to in Episode 7 and beyond?

**Hayashi:**¬†Starting from Episode 7,¬†*It‚Äôs MyGO!!!!!*¬†viewers will be deeply moved by the developments‚Äîplease look forward to it!

**Okada:**¬†And in Episode 8, Umirin finally takes action! When I got the script, I discussed it with the cast, saying, ‚ÄúSo Umirin actually has this side to her!?‚Äù Please keep an eye out for it.

# Specially Illustrated Message! By Mei Okada √ó Coco Hayashi

**Hayashi:**¬†It‚Äôs rare to see Taki drinking a matcha Frappuccino! This coffee addict must‚Äôve been influenced by Raana. Just imagining that she finally has a schoolmate she can casually grab snacks with after class makes me so emotional.

**Okada:**¬†Seeing these two, who usually give off an aloof aura, being spotted in such an everyday setting would definitely become a hot topic in their class. ‚ÄúWait, Yahata-san and Shiina-san are actually close!?‚Äù But that ‚ÄúOh no!!‚Äù expression on Taki‚Äôs face when they got caught was hilarious‚Äîthere was nothing to be flustered about (laughs).

**Hayashi:**¬†She was just drinking a Frappuccino with a classmate after school, but she reacted like she‚Äôd been caught in a scandal (laughs)‚Ä¶ What‚Äôs she even nervous about!?",5,1739202630.0,BanGDream,1,1.0,False

1im95rq,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/1im95rq/alternatives_for_new_tea_drinker_enamored_with/,Alternatives for new tea drinker enamored with TWG 1837 green tea,"Hi All! 

I recently quit coffee and ordered a cup of TWG 1837 green tea at a local coffee shop. I feel in love with the grassy, fruity taste and mouthfeel of this tea. After researching, I found most folks don't recommend TWG, but I'm not sure where to start with finding a better company, quality and something that I might similarly enjoy. I understand 1837 in a recreation of Mariage Fr√®res, Th√© Vert Marco Polo - thought about trying that instead but some threads indicate Mariage Fr√®res is better than TWG, but still  more marketing than freshness and quality.

**Does anyone have recommendations for quality green tea that might be similar in profile to TWG 1837 green tea? Alternatively, any beginner green tea recommendations to try?**

TWG description: *1837 Tea is a voyage, boasting a lofty fruit and flower bouquet that leaves a delicious aftertaste of red fruits and caramel with a light touch of astringency*

  
Apologies in advance to the purists - I know the below list is going to cause some pain, but I'm excited to learn and try something new. 

**My tea experiences and feedback so far:**

* Southern US based, grew up on iced sweetened Lipton tea. Warm tea was not a norm to me.
* Have tried some (likely poorer quality) earl grey teas, but not a fan of the flavor. It tasted like I sprayed perfume in my mouth.
* Tried August Tea sampler, but didn't like the heavy artificial flavors (now aware this wasn't a great sampler attempt given quality and flavoring). Tried some of their black teas with milk and not a big fan of tea + milk - at least not my execution of it at home. There was a white tea that was more enjoyable in this mix.
* Enjoyed Teavana's jade spearmint tea.
* I enjoy licorice flavor in some herbal tea's I've tried like Traditional Medicinals throat coat and most herbal boxed tea (tisanes?) I've tried (e.g., Yogi brand mixes that have various lemon, ginger, hibiscus, vanilla notes).
* In general, I haven't tried a green tea I can't drink - whereas I can't finish most black teas I've tried. 1837 was the first I really enjoyed and have thought about for a week straight.
* Enjoy masala chai - fortunate to have had some delicious homemade masala chai from a friend and occasionally order at local coffee shops that make it fresh without syrups or flavors. While enjoyable, not something I crave daily.
* Tried a matcha latte from Starbucks and hated it - I also hate their chai, so that doesn't totally discourage me from trying in future. A friend who traveled extensively in China brought some fresh quality matcha and made me a matcha latte, that was better, but the intense grassiness will need to grow on me, so not my first choice.
* I'd prefer something I can drink warm and with minimal sweetener. Open to a taste that needs to grow on me a bit.

Or at least begin the process. At the minute my savings are depleted thanks to a few things that came up at the start of this year.

I work in IT and earn just over 39k a year. I pay 400 rent to my mam, and also have car loan and maintenance payments to my ex partner for our child. Aside from mandatory payments, I put aside 300 euro a month for groceries, and 600 for day to day spending (hobbies, grabbing a coffee or a lunch, going to the pub etc). Anything left over at the end of the month goes into savings.

My partner works in the hospitality industry and in their last job was earning around 27 to 29k a year. They weren't paying rent and had no loan or payments other than bills. I'm not sure what their savings is like currently but they've been saving for this abroad trip so will likely be using a bunch for that.

Because of my kid in Dublin, I need to stay within an hour commute, so we've been looking at North county Dublin (Balbriggan, Skerries area) and also parts of Meath and Louth. Ideally we'd love somewhere with a nice garden, preferably somewhere rural but looking at daft, I feel not all our requirements are going to be met.

Why choose Nuan Cafe over all the other caf√©s in Pampanga? Because why not!

Nuan Farm Cafe offers all the amenities you need for a perfect place to relax, refresh, and reconnect with your companions. Located slightly away from the city, it provides a more peaceful and unwinding atmosphere. With its vast hectares of land, the space is well-utilized and beautifully balanced, allowing it to accommodate hundreds of guests.

Beyond being just a caf√©, Nuan Farm and Cafe also features a resort and an event venue available for overnight stays. In addition, they have been very strategic with their parking area, making it convenient for guests, and even offer a free shuttle service for those parked at a distance.

The ambiance is refreshing, as the farm setting is complemented by lush greenery and plant-themed decorations. Aside from its eco-friendly and green surroundings, the place is impeccably clean and modern, boasting aesthetic chandeliers, a well-maintained restroom, glass walls, high ceilings, wooden furniture, and many other Instagram-worthy details.

Nuan Farm and Cafe offers a variety of amenities, including swimming pools, an event space, a garden, indoor and outdoor dining areas, and a huge playground for children to enjoy. It is truly a place for everyone whether for grand celebrations or simple dining, from breakfast to dinner, and for both adults and kids. 

Nuan Coffee Shop is located in Bacolor, Guagua, Pampanga. It's a bit outside the city, giving it a calm and peaceful ambiance. The area is surrounded by trees, creating a quiet space to relax and enjoy your coffee. The drive to the coffee shop can be convenient for those with cars, but the road can be risky due to trucks, making it harder for motorcycle riders or those relying on public transport. While it's a bit of a hassle to get to if you're commuting, the peaceful environment and the cozy vibe of the coffee shop make the trip worth it.

When visiting a cafe, one of the things we most look forward to‚Äîaside from their specialty coffee‚Äîis the food. At Nuan Cafe, the menu features home-style yet sumptuous dishes crafted from simple, quality ingredients. They offer a wide variety of choices, from hearty breakfasts, pasta, and √† la carte meals to crispy chicken wings, fresh salads, nachos, burgers, sandwiches, pizzas, and an array of sides. And, of course, no cafe experience is complete without indulging in their delectable cakes and pastries. With such an extensive selection, deciding what to order can take a while! 

To make it even better, Nuan Cafe also ensures that every dish is beautifully plated, making it truly ""picture-perfect""‚Äîa feast for both the palate and the eyes. More than anything, dining at Nuan Cafe is an experience that brings people together over great flavors and even greater conversations.

At Nuan Caf√©, their beverage menu offers a delightful mix of coffee-based and non-coffee options, perfect for every preference.
For our drinks, we had Chocolate Chip, Caramel Macchiato, Salted Caramel Macchiato, Chocolate Latte, Biscoff Latte, and Hibiscus Tea. The Salted Caramel Macchiato had a nice balance of sweetness and saltiness, while the Chocolate Latte was smooth and creamy‚Äîideal for those who love a comforting chocolate drink. Also, the Biscoff Latte is worth trying if you enjoy the warm, spiced flavor of cookie butter. For a refreshing, non-coffee option, the Hibiscus Tea was light and slightly tart, making it a great palate cleanser.

Beyond the drinks, Nuan Caf√© is a place where flavors and aesthetics come together. Their well-curated menu, paired with beautifully crafted beverages, makes for an experience that‚Äôs both satisfying and Instagram-worthy. Whether you‚Äôre a coffee lover or just looking for a cozy spot to relax, Nuan Caf√© is definitely worth a visit!

The servings at Nuan Caf√© align with its emphasis on mindfulness. Every dish is presented as an artful composition, prioritizing fresh, locally sourced ingredients. Meals are intentionally portioned to encourage savoring flavors rather than overindulging. For example, their signature bowls feature just the right mix of proteins, grains, and vegetables balanced in taste and nutrition. Similarly, desserts are served in petite portions, allowing for indulgence without excess.

One of the most important factors in deciding to return to a caf√© or any place is the quality of service. At Caf√© Nuan, their hospitality truly stood out from the moment we arrived. The staff welcomed us warmly at the gate and even provided a golf cart ride to the caf√©, ensuring a smooth and pleasant experience.

Inside, the service remained just as exceptional. The staff greeted customers with genuine warmth, serving with a smile and creating an inviting atmosphere where guests could relax without feeling judged. They went above and beyond to make everyone feel welcome, always ready to assist with kindness and attentiveness, making each visit feel special.

With its serene ambiance, delicious food, and warm hospitality, Nuan Caf√© is more than just a caf√©‚Äîit‚Äôs an experience. So, if you‚Äôre in Pampanga, make sure to visit Nuan Cafe and see for yourself why it‚Äôs a must-try destination!

A new AI tool, ""C the Signs"", shows promise in early colorectal cancer (CRC) detection. Based on a retrospective study of 894,275 patient records, the AI achieved high sensitivity (93.8%) in identifying CRC risk, even up to five years before a physician's diagnosis in 29.4% of cases. This tool could significantly improve early detection, particularly important given the rising incidence of CRC in younger individuals who are often not routinely screened. The model's speed and ability to identify at-risk patients warrant further investigation for improved CRC outcomes. The research was presented at the **ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium and reported in the** ***American Journal of Managed Care*****.**

**What this means:** This advancement could lead to significantly improved survival rates, reducing the burden on healthcare systems and allowing for more proactive interventions. \[[Listen](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/ai-tool-can-diagnose-some-colon-cancer-years-before-doctors/id1684415169?i=1000690855121)\]

Ijust got out of a relationship but like a year ago but we still talk here and there... I was in it for 4 years and he didn't make me lift a penny wallet or pay a bill. Commercial Spaces for Christmas, moncler coats to celebrate good revenue months etc etc I'm not a gold digger I just work hard asf like nice stuff and I expect my partner to feel the same way about their self. I was even able to save money for a home with his help. Now Fast fwd.... This past year being single I knew my standards.. I'd date guys who did take me on dates and buy me things come up w creative ideas to do etc but those were never long lived as I do not hook up. Now, I keep meeting men who KNOW about how my ex treated me (we own a public Facing business and we kinda like what ppl cringey say 'relationship goals' ) like I mean the guy would always comment how lucky my bf was to have me. He messages me a few weeks back asking if I was single yet lol I said yes... and then goes on this weird IG story spree about how he takes care of his girls he dates showing screenshots etc etc now stuff like that don't appease me but he seemed respectful so I texted him for a bit..

asked him to buy me coffee just to Test his weather (I'm a single mom and sometimes coffee helps relieve not being able to afford it) and he couldn't because he didn't have a cash app... which to me is a red flag as a mom what if I'm In an emergency? Ok well whatever again I'm assuming I'm
Trying something new... so l still give it a chance. Now little things, like he lives w his parents still... I'm not picky about that there could be many reasons but if you invite me to hang out at your house and then invite yourself to mine?? Which i don't let men in my home... as a mom Almost 30 it almost
Feels awkward? So I leave it be cause anything could cause that. So he tells me ""I don't have w33d you're gonna be pissed"" Which I didn't cop because men smoke women up? I expressed to him that I don't pay for mine & I'll grab some.. as a man why you letting another man give a girl you're interested in free w333d? So again whatever.
So we met, and I really liked his vibe.. he feels comfortable I just wanna ensure l'm not just being lonely and desperate or if I should actually
Try something new... so l
Keep my mind open.
Next few days i invited him over and he was never able to due to ""not having a ride"" which now this is insane atp. Like order a Uber then? Why don't you have a bank account? And then when he came over a few days later he kept pushing me to put in on w333d after I expressed to him I don't pay for it and would rather call a guy friend who lives buy.. and then it had to be the nerve to be more expensive then I would pay if I did pay.. Just the whole thing pissed me off and I don't think I like him. He reminds me of a homeboy and imma
Likely keep it like that. I know I sound like a gold digger and shallow but I have standards.
I'm adventurous I'm too old and too deserving to be snacking up in some guys house smoking like I'm 16?? And even inviting men over my house when I have a kid and an ex boyfriend who when he's happy he pays my bills and without me asking ... I wanna change my dating style so bad because obv what I'm used to didn't work but I also don't wanna settle or lower my standards cause then l'll be miserable and sad... and mean to him....

I am a few weeks lurker on r/ Vermiculture and I just started my first 3 bins and I would like some extra advice.

Please let me know if I am missing something‚Ä¶except 3 more bins obviously.

3x 55L ( 20 gallons ) stackable plastic boxes with lids.
1x paper shredder. I shred Amazon boxes with it. 
4 x sheets of fine stainless steel mesh to cover the air intake holes. 
16 kilograms dehydrated coco coir.
1 kilogram European red wrigglers ( large ).

Right now they reside in my basement with a dehumidifier that works 24/7. Air humidity level is at 50% at all times and goes up to 90% without it. There are no windows or any other air source.

I didn‚Äôt layer my stuff by the book but  I just hydrated the coco coir and mixed well with shredded cardboard. Added some used soil from my houseplants that I had hanging around for a while, 2 handfuls of spent coffee grounds, 1 handful of pulverised egg shells and voila. 

We are a household of two and a half and I plan on not spending 10 ‚Ç¨ for 10x 30L plastic bags to discard my waste. 
I freeze all  of my veggie peels, drying citrus peels and egg shells.

My worry is that they will try to hit the road and I am undecided on leaving the lid on or off the boxes while they are down there. Once I can take them out lid will stay on for obvious reasons. Rats are a thing at night around here for some reason.
Lights on or off?
Did I purchase too many for the size of my boxes ? What means too many worms for my boxes and what are you doing with them if hey are overpopulating ? 
How wet my boxes should be? I am afraid of overwatering and making a mess. I don‚Äôt have holes for leakage either. 
What is your experience with similar setups , advise me pls.

Anyway, thanks again everybody !

1im92mc,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1im92mc/are_my_friends_still_my_friends/,Are my friends still my friends?,"I'm in my twenties and have had the same group of friends since high school.

We often go out, travel when we have time, and get to know each other's families well.

For the past year, I've felt a bit of an outsider. Lately, they haven't started conversations with me, and the last few times I went out with them, I couldn't hold conversations because it was about a show that only they were doing or because of another activity they'd been doing.

I thought we were at a stage of not talking to each other as much because we have a group together, but they have been talking to each other.

The last summer was strange. We did almost nothing compared with other years, I had a lot of free time on weekends, and when I asked if someone wanted to go for a walk or have a coffee to talk, they often saw the message and took hours or even a day or two to respond.

However when I went on vacation with my family they went camping, I found it strange that they did not comment anything about me, but I did not care much, because although I was on vacation does not mean that they could not have fun, when I returned home I asked again if they wanted to go out to talk and no one could, and from

After that one of us had a birthday and the vibe was super strange as soon as I arrived, (I arrived a little early) and everyone was already there, and besides a ""hello"" and ""How are you?"" Practically no one talked.  A week later I saw stories they posted, that they had gone out without me and the excuse was ""it was last minute"" and another was "" we thought you woudnt wanna come.""

There were other little things, one time I was talking about a movie that I saw in the cinema that I had loved and that I didn't mind seeing again, and they wanted to go see it too, but they said it wasn't worth me going because I had already seen it, or when I need a ride because I didn't have my car and they said it wasn't worth it because they were just having a drink even though I had do the same for them other days.

After that, we had a couple of nights where it was spectacular, and everyting felt normal again.

And out of nowhere, when we hang out last time, they talk nonstop about the new year holiday trip together they had, without even commenting or asking if I wanted to go. I was so shocked that the only thing I did was act perfectly normal.

Am I being paranoid? Is it normal for ""friends"" not to ask you if you want to go somewhere even if ""they're not sure""? This never happened before, being with them is so good, there are few thing i wouldnt do for them and all of a suden i feel like an outsider.

Even if I didn't want to go with them, they never talked about going on vacation. A few weeks before they left, we were together and neither of them said anything about it at all, which leads me to believe they really wanted to hide it from me.

I can't stop thinking about what I did wrong, or what happened to get to this point.

Is this a phase? What should I do?",1,1739202277.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,0.99,False

She was 21 and I 29 we meet at the mall where we used to work and after a while I asked her out and from there it went fast, we moved in together in her apartment after 6 months dating. She decided to end our relationship before the summer because she felt I was controlling and jealous when I several times had questioned why she needed to have men that her friends knew on her socials. They almost every time tried to hit on her or ask her out but she told them she was with me but it still didn‚Äôt sit right with me. When we broke up we both were sad and cried, she told me she loved me and was going to miss me. Over the last 8 months I reached out 2 times first time she was kind and loving but the last time she was distant and cold. Now to the point we meet at a bar random 1 month ago where she approached me and asked me about if I were seeing somebody and maybe wanted to grab a lunch or coffee. I said maybe and I wasn‚Äôt seeing somebody, later in the bar we talked again and went home together and spent the weekend. After that weekend we kept contact and decided to have open contact without pressure but when I‚Äôve reached out 2 times she doesn‚Äôt seem to have time to talk with me. And she hasn‚Äôt made an active choice to reach out after that just once before. Now I don‚Äôt know what she really wanted with everything she said.

1im90p7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1im90p7,"Next : Alinea, Year One (*, Chicago)","Wife and I celebrated an early valentines day meal at Next. We had the Charlie Trotter menu a few months prior and looked forward to this menu as we started our Fine Dining experience a few years prior at Alinea. Being able to revisit the theatrics without the price tag was great, and being able to get the classics without feeling like it was a rehash at Alinea was nice. On this menu, the only item we'd had previously was the truffle explosion as it is frequently on the menus for cocktail tastings at The Aviary/The Office.

Of the courses, the only one I wasn't a huge fan of was the lamb, but it was still tasty and was our first experience with the scented pillows that slowly release aroma to impact the flavors of the meal.  

The wine pairing was good, though I am not really qualified to determine if it was worth the cost, but I would agree that it enhanced my enjoyment of the meal. I was a huge fan of the nori liqueur paired with the matsutake dessert dish, as the flavor from one bloomed and carried into the other between sips.

Service was great, kind and attentive. Our service team was loose and familiar in a comfortable fashion, which was great as we are certainly not fans of stiff service. 

Missing from my photos is the classic Hot Potato Cold Potato as it was delivered to our table and we were asked to eat with urgency due to the mismatch of temperatures in the dish. As someone who has had the truffle explosion at least three times - I think I'm a bigger fan of the potato.

1im90e8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1im90e8/what_is_the_best_way_to_handle_an_extremely_toxic/,"What is the best way to handle an extremely toxic, and abusive couple living in the apartment below yours?","I'll try to make this short, but I am pissed and worried. I'll preface this by saying that they have three young kids in the apartment, and they always cry when these two are fighting. I have never heard anything directed at the kids, but who knows what goes on behind the door.

These two middle aged adults seem to know only one style of communication, and it's yelling at each other, slamming doors, and breaking stuff. When I say yelling, I mean threats, crying, moaning, things that I have never been exposed to. Last night the lady was crying and moaning for HOURS. I literally missed work today because she kept me up all night. 

Sometimes she'll scream ""you're hurting me"", sometimes it sounds like she's being murdered, last night sounded like she was either giving birth, or mourning the death of a child. 

This arguing happens almost every day. It's not always as scary as last night, but it's always a constant drumbeat of toxicity. The kids are almost always in the background crying, and I don't know how to help them.

The police have been there many times, and nothing ever changes. The apartments are supposedly trying to evict them, but that's not going to help those kids. That is my main concern.

I'm no expert, and I don't know anyone like these people, but I am fairly convinced that if she's not dead after last night, it's not going to take much for someone to die in that apartment. 

The guy came out drinking coffee this morning, and came outside as I was finishing walking the dogs. He NEVER comes out of the apartment, and I have never seen him do anything as human as drinking coffee in the morning and greeting neighbors. I don't know what else to assume except he was trying to see if I heard anything last night. As I write this, I don't know if she's dead, or a kid is dead, or what is going on. 

I don't know what to do besides call the police, but it's never changed. Those kids are so cute, and sweet, and I just don't know what I can do to help them. The parents both need some sort of mental evaluation, but the guy is unhinged, and possibly dangerous. 

I could honestly write about a hundred similar situations that have happened in the past 5 months, but this situation happened over the course of the last two days. This is the first time I have missed work over it, but it's certainly not the first, or even the 40th time I've lost sleep. I'm almost conditioned to write it off as ""oh, it's how they communicate, and it's none of my business"". 

What am I supposed to do, what can I do after the police come for the tenth time? Those kids are in such a terrible situation, and I don't know how to handle it anymore. I don't even know that it's my business to try, or if it's my duty to try. 

TLDR; Abusive couple in neighboring apt are so vocally, and likely physically abusive to each other that I worry for their kids. The police have been called multiple times, and nothing has changed. ",1,1739202119.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

Context: I have 4 kids under 8. The youngest is 3 months old and breastfed. My husband works from home full time, I am on maternity leave still but my job allows me to stay home with the kids (no daycare) and I work random off shifts or weekends. We are moving in a few months so everything needs packed and house projects need completed before we list.

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs pissing me off:
-I was gone with the older two kids at a sports thing all weekend. I brought the baby with me. So my husband just had our preschooler all weekend. I came home to him emptying the dishwasher - the *only* chore he did the ENTIRE weekend. He also went grocery shopping but didn‚Äôt even get enough for the week - just grabbed ‚Äúsome stuff that looked good‚Äù without considering meals, etc. so basically just a bunch of snacks and cereal. Toys everywhere, food left out, dirty laundry littering every surface. Just pure mess everywhere. ‚ÄúWe were busy‚Äù he says. We had discussed him tackling some house projects while he was home, but not only did he *not* do any projects, he made double work for me this week with catching up on cleaning. I need probably 6-8 hours of just cleaning top top bottom before I can even start on the house projects. All of this with a week of appointments for myself and the kids, sports in the evenings, etc. I feel like my job in the home is undervalued and under appreciated and everyone gets a break except me. 

-I am struggling to lose the baby weight. I am miserable in this body and have been very open talking about how I am trying hard to eat right, move more, etc and how self conscious I am. I have about 30 pounds to lose. Every single phone call I have with my mother is how little she eats and how much she works out and how skinny she is getting. She was telling me she saw my brother and his girlfriend this weekend and ‚Äúomg everyone looks so good and skinny it‚Äôs amazing.‚Äù THEY ARE ALL ON OZEMPIC. Even my normal weight mother found someone to prescribe it to her! So YEAH‚Ä¶I‚Äôm happy you‚Äôre skinny‚Ä¶but sharing your ‚Äúdiet and exercise tips‚Äù to me is not helpful bc our circumstances are not the same! You are just making me feel shittier about myself. I want nothing more than time to exercise and care for myself but I‚Äôm up all night with a baby and if I can snag 30 mins for a workout, I have a preschooler climbing on and around me. It‚Äôs so frustrating!!!!

-my friends all suck. They have babies and I drop off meals, have coffee delivered, bring them groceries, check in on their mental health. Yet I have literally the most traumatizing pregnancy and postpartum experience and I could count on one hand how many times someone checked in. I had a lot of ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bring over dinner!‚Äù And then didn‚Äôt hear from anyone in weeks. I just feel so hurt that I am not worthy of the same love I showed them - my friends have all said how I ‚Äúsaved‚Äù them when they were in the postpartum trenches, yet here I am just going on with business as usual. Yet they are constantly texting and calling me for help/advice for their own kids. I‚Äôm hurt. I spent weeks of my pregnancy in the hospital concerned for mine and baby‚Äôs health and then weeks after the pregnancy in the NICU. We had some help from the grandmas but once we were home the help fizzled out. 

Anyways - thanks for the rant. Im just scratching the surface on my life the past few months. I‚Äôm just so so tired and just feel totally overlooked and like no one really *sees* me. I‚Äôm sick of crying and being sad and feeling angry.

I'm looking for a roommate to move into a 2 bedroom apartment in Lower Allston that I have lived in for the last 5 years with someone else. Here are the details:

\* Location: Lower Allston, close to many parks, Trader joes, HBS, Star market, restaurants, public transit (66, 86, 70 within 5m, red/green line about a 15 minute walk).

\* Availability: 3/1 would be the move in date, upon moving in the landlord would like us to sign a new lease that would run until 7/31.

\* Rent: $1200/month + utilities (usually \~$175 depending on season).

\* About the Apartment: Spacious 2 bedroom with a full living, dining and kitchen space. Washer and dryer are in the unit. Street parking is typically available. The bedroom available isn't huge but has a great closet and the apartment has a good amount of space. It's an older apartment but i've much enjoyed the time I've spent here. Photos are of the furnished room but it would not come furnished (TBD depending on what the person moving out takes).

\* About Me: I'm 31 year old guy, I quit my full-time job last year to pursue an undergraduate degree while I work at a local coffee shop. I'm pretty quiet, clean and laid back. I love to cook, take long walks and watch the NY knicks! I don't drink or smoke but do enjoy the 420.

\* Pets: I have a cat that is extremely cute but the landlord will not allow additional pets.

If you're interested or have any questions, feel free to DM me! I‚Äôd be happy to share more pictures and info.

Here‚Äôs the backstory: My husband had heard that coffee grounds are good for plants, so he added some used coffee grounds to the topsoil ( I found out to late ). Ever since then, my poor ZZ plant has gone downhill.

I‚Äôve already spoken to some of my mom‚Äôs friends, and they suggested that I repot it, but I‚Äôm not sure what kind of soil to use or the best way to revive it. I‚Äôve attached some photos to show its current condition (you can see some mold on the soil, which I‚Äôm guessing is from the coffee grounds).

What‚Äôs the best way to bring my ZZ plant back to life? I water once a week and it‚Äôs not on a sunny spot so it gets low/medium light. So, what kind of soil should I use? Should I prune it or do anything special to the roots?

Any advice or tips would be so appreciated. I‚Äôm determined to give this plant a second chance!

I also experienced a globus sensation (also a feeling that something like hair was stuck in my throat) during this time, but that sensation has now gone away. I think it may have been due to the stress I was under because of my exams. Because of this, I‚Äôve developed a fear of choking. However, I still have difficulty swallowing solids and can only eat pureed foods, yogurt, and protein shakes. 

A week ago, I visited a gastroenterologist. She said she couldn‚Äôt determine what might be causing the issue without an endoscopy. I‚Äôm scheduled to have the endoscopy tomorrow.

1im8nmm,https://www.reddit.com/r/endometriosis/comments/1im8nmm/possible_endo_without_terrible_periods/,Possible endo without terrible periods?,"**TLDR;** I'm F31. Intense dull aches in my lower right abdomen which radiates into back and leg. Bloods/ultrasounds are fine. I've wondered about endo, but I'm reading accounts of women with excruciating periods losing a lot of blood. Yes mine are painful, but not to the level which I'm being seen described online. 

**Full background:** 

I first went to my doctor in 2021 with pain in my lower right abdomen that seemed to appear around ovulation, plus bleeding after sex and a change in menstrual patterns (I'm UK based). I had normal pap and bloods, plus a normal ultrasound scan of my ovaries so nothing else happened. 

This window of abdominal pain has increased over the last few years, to the point where it's not just during ovulation but is now constantly there. Every damn day and night, all the time. 24/7. It's this persistent, dull, radiating ache that feels like it's centred where my right ovary would be - just for the purposes of explaining where it is. This radiates into my lower back down into my right leg. OTC painkillers do absolutely nothing. I've tried 'pain packets', which are two ibuprofen, two paracetamol, and a strong coffee. Doesn't help. 

I went back to the Doctors in July, and saw a GP who sent me for another ultrasound which showed my ovaries are normal, and my kidneys/liver were checked too and were fine. They noted the left ovary was mildly cystic whilst my right ovary 'looks great'. Weirdly I have absolutely zero pain on the left side where the tiny cysts are, and it's always, always on the right which is apparently clear of any ovarian cysts. 

I pushed for a gynae referral which my GP was happy to do, so I'm on the waiting list (who knows how long that'll take!)

I guess my main query is - I keep reading accounts of women with endo who have these excruciating periods and are losing high volumes of blood. I wouldn't say I have particularly bad or heavy periods. Yes, they're painful and I am much lower energy, but I have never considered them excruciating. They are over within 4-5 days and I'm still able to get out and about, even if I'd rather not. Neurofen plus (ibuprofen + codeine) works when I'm on my period.

Could I have endo, or is the absence of terrible periods an indicator that it's not that? Anyone had similar symptoms who has since been diagnosed? ",1,1739201215.0,endometriosis,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm a 28 y/o male, I‚Äôve been in San Fran for the past couple of months for work and I‚Äôve gone a few casual dates, they‚Äôre extremely easy to find here and it‚Äôs a fun way to meet new people.

I‚Äôm totally cool with listening rather than talking in conversations with new people, I‚Äôm an extrovert and can be a bit obnoxious to introverts so I like to give the stage early on. 

On most of these dates it‚Äôs been women complaining about three things: 

1. Trump (understandable)
2. Men
3. How impossible it is for a woman to date in todays society 

I have not run into this before, I usually live in and around the midwestern states, I saw it here and there but not to this extent. 

I‚Äôm not trying to be an ass, but I‚Äôve been on dates with ‚Äúex 4B‚Äôrs‚Äù and ‚Äúextreme‚Äù (their word not mine) feminists. Why even say yes? It just ruins my weekend and yours, if they hate men why bother?

I do not believe in walking out on somebody or ‚Äúghosting‚Äù. I‚Äôve done it multiple times since being out here.

For context (largely unimportant and can be skipped)

Last night I went out at about 7 pm, just a quick dinner date from a girl I met the previous week at the gym. We had been texting all week, grabbed coffee on Thursday, she seemed really chill.

By 8 pm she was telling me how it‚Äôs not some but ALL men shouldn‚Äôt be trusted (ever), that men are extremely dumb, and that the only reason she went out with me is because I don‚Äôt seem threatening. I asked her to elaborate and she said I look more feminine. Didn‚Äôt take it as a dig, kept trying to move it along because at this point (830ish) I wanted to go the fuck home. 

She continued to go on complaining about men and honestly by 9 I was done and just asked her if she thinks bashing men all night would make me want another date. I got up, paid the bill, ordered her an uber and left.

I will never be more feminine and will not change my personality, but I am embarking on this weight loss journey to see what happens when I lose weight. 

I told him: ‚ÄúHey. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm capable of having a friendship with you at this time. I hope you understand.‚Äù

And then blocked his number. I have no idea whether he saw it or responded.

I am sad. Not at his rejection, because everyone is entitled to their preferences, but because once again I encountered a dime a dozen superficial man who values looks over substance.

I am getting ready for a flight. While I am back in the USA, I scheduled an appointment to get Botox and lip fillers. I don‚Äôt want to, but it‚Äôs temporary. I am just going all into this appearance thing, to see what happens. 

I am also going to try and catalog what I eat in a day today I had an iced latte with oat milk. No sweetener. Just coffee and milk. 

I also had a homemade rosemary salt bagel, with dill cream cheese, lettuce, arugula, onion, jalape√±o, tomato, and turkey. I know. I fat girl like me shouldn‚Äôt eat carbs. No bagel. No cream cheese, but I will cut the calories elsewhere. Maybe do a ‚Äúsnake meal‚Äù today, where I only eat once. 

I wish I had found a man who cared about me when I wasn‚Äôt in my top physical shape. I wish he cared about me to go with me to the gym and we got in shape together. I know I will resent any man who likes me when/if I get fit. I will doubt his intent and I will never care about him the way I would have if he has loved me when I wasn‚Äôt in shape.

Other stats:

1. I haven‚Äôt had sex since October 2021 (more by choice, as I need an emotional connection for intimacy.‚Äù
2. I swear a size 11 (I know, ‚Äúso gross‚Äù üôÑ) 
3. My ex husband is happily moved on with a physically beautiful woman, who is everything I am not. She is the feminine, submissive kind that many men want. That will never be me. 
4. I haven‚Äôt stepped on a scale, but guess I weigh between 180-190. 


Experiment Goals:

1. Weight: 125-150 (I don‚Äôt know, it depends on what I look like). 
2. Size: 6-8 
3. Dating: Find a man to court me and see how I respond to this. 

Right now, if I added photos to myself as I am now, I could get 100 men yo swipe right in a few hours. But maybe only 5-10 matches and one or two low quality messages (e.g. ‚Äúhi. How are you.‚Äù Nothing of substance. I wonder if the effort of men increases with weight loss? 

I pray that I find my man before I lose weight, so I know he likes me for me. I am very afraid of losing weight and finding someone, but being incapable of loving him because of doubting his intention.

It doesn't happen every night, but when it does, it makes me feel unsatisfied with my sleep.

There are nights when i go to sleep, then wake up around 4am, fall asleep right away, wake up at 4:45am, fall asleep right away, and do this until I'm supposed to wake up around 7am.

I notice I have very confusing/illogical dreams that just repeat themselves everytime this happens, like I'm stuck in some weird loop.

The only way to break out of it, is to consciously calm down, recognize what's happening, and to mentally relax and focus on staying asleep.

Otherwise, I end up waking up and immediately looking at the time, as if I'm worrying about the time, even though I know I have an alarm that will wake me up.

It's very annoying, and only started happening to me last year. Any ideas what it can be and how to make it better?

For context, I don't drink coffee/alcohol, smoke, etc.
I do spend a lot of time In front of a screen. But I always use a blue light filter. And I'm not interested in taking pills, gummies, shoots, etc. Just looking for a natural solution.

She makes more time for me than any friend I've had. I've been having a hard time adjusting to civilian life after a year of trying to get disability, going to doctors, looking for a job, so moving in is a huge weight off my back. 

I'm not worried I won't get along with her, we text daily and meet up regularly in person just to grab a coffee or some fries and soda. She's usually the one inviting me out, so I know she's comfortable with the time/place and not feeling pressured to say yes (because of the implication). We game together in groups and have movie nights about twice a month. 

My big thing is, right now she wants me to rest between doctors visits, save up money, and write like I always say I'll do more if I have time. I'm grateful! But my bad health keeps me from standing more than 5 - 10 minutes a pop so I can't help around the house much, or help clear up the spare room where I'll be sleeping.

She likes my writing, so I can dedicate myself to doing that in between hunting for a job, but she already reads all my work so it doesn't feel special. We loosely made plans for Friday since both of us are free, but I can't splurge much right now. I want to, but she rarely lets me get the whole check anyway. Not much of a thank you to her if we go somewhere nice, she dies a little inside at how much things cost when we do get dinner. I'm the exact opposite, I used to do takeout pretty much every night. I mostly lived by myself for the past six years, so not like I was feeding a whole family. She does, so I can see why she prefers to cook. 

She always tells me to try Google when I get wrapped in my head, but all the suggestions I found are too expensive, too romantic, or involve a lot more physical activity than I should be doing. I know she likes books, games, doom scrolling (she hates that word so much), and horror movies. She's a homebody, back when I used to go out more with my friends she never went, but always encouraged me to go and never minded when we changed our plans around. She'll show up if it's something like a small dinner or if they need help with renovations, but if it's a bar or restaurant she tells me to have fun. Obviously I cut back on going out cause of current situation, so I'm glad to have someone who I can hang out with at home. 

She likes to write too but doesn't use notebooks like I do, I've tried that as a gift on some holiday before and she admitted it's a pretty addition to her bookcase but isn't using it. Her hands hurt if she writes a lot. I have gotten her gifts before for her birthday or randomly, it's usually stuff like a classic anthology of literature or vintage thesaurus, cute dolls, a big coffee mug, or a movie we can't find on our streaming services. But this feels different, this is a big deal and I want it to be more than a one time thing.

1im88ur,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1im88ur/blackdecker_cm2046s_coffee_maker_review_a/,BLACK+DECKER CM2046S Coffee Maker Review - A Dependable Brew Companion,"I‚Äôve been a coffee enthusiast for years, so testing the BLACK+DECKER CM2046S 12-Cup Thermal Programmable Coffee Maker felt like embarking on a mission to make my mornings smoother. This machine has become a staple in my kitchen, brewing cup after cup with ease. While I‚Äôm impressed with its performance, a few things stood out that potential buyers should know.

The **design and build quality** grabbed my attention right out of the box. Its sleek black and steel finish fits perfectly in a modern kitchen. The thermal carafe, with a 5-layer vacuum seal, feels sturdy and is cool to the touch even when the coffee inside is hot. However, I noticed the lid of the carafe can trap water, which requires some extra effort to clean. It‚Äôs a minor inconvenience but worth noting.

In terms of **brewing performance**, this coffee maker delivers rich and flavorful coffee consistently. The Vortex Technology evenly saturates the coffee grounds, extracting maximum flavor. I tested it with both pre-ground coffee and fresh beans, and the results were impressive each time. The brew strength selector allowed me to experiment with different boldness levels, and I found the ‚Äústrong‚Äù setting ideal for my taste. Yet, I wish the coffee stayed hotter a little longer than the advertised two hours.

[Ready to snag BLACK+DECKER CM2046S? See Amazon‚Äôs price.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/blackdecker-cm2046s-coffee-maker-review-b0c2jk9y8v/)

The **customization and controls** are intuitive. The programmable brewing feature is a lifesaver for those early mornings when I need coffee to wake up. I appreciated the 1-4 cup brewing option for smaller batches, which still maintained the coffee's strength and flavor. The LCD display‚Äôs fresh brew timer is a thoughtful addition, letting me know how long the coffee has been sitting. However, I found myself wishing the clock had a backlight for easier visibility in dim lighting.

**Ease of use** is another strength of this coffee maker. The buttons are responsive, and the overall interface is user-friendly. My teenage nephew even managed to program it without asking for help, which speaks volumes about its simplicity. On the flip side, the reusable filter isn‚Äôt included, so I had to buy one separately.

When it comes to **cleaning and maintenance**, the removable parts make the process straightforward. The auto-clean function is a bonus, especially for someone like me who sometimes forgets to descale the machine regularly. That said, I had to pay extra attention to the spring-loaded valves in the carafe lid to ensure they didn‚Äôt clog with coffee grounds.

The **capacity and size** make this coffee maker suitable for families or frequent coffee drinkers. The water reservoir holds enough for 12 cups, and the thermal carafe ensures there‚Äôs enough coffee to go around. Despite its larger capacity, the coffee maker doesn‚Äôt hog counter space, which is perfect for my compact kitchen.

**Pros**

* Sleek, modern design with a durable thermal carafe.
* Vortex Technology ensures even saturation for rich flavor.
* Programmable settings with brew strength selector.
* Easy-to-use interface and auto-clean feature.
* Compact design that fits well on smaller counters.

**Cons**

* Coffee doesn‚Äôt stay piping hot beyond two hours.
* No reusable filter included with the coffee maker.
* Carafe lid requires careful cleaning to avoid clogs.
* Lack of backlight on the clock can be inconvenient.

**Comparison to Competitors**

Having tested other coffee makers like the Cuisinart DCC-3200 and Ninja CE251, I found the BLACK+DECKER CM2046S holds its own well. The Cuisinart offers a heated plate to keep coffee warmer longer, but it lacks the vacuum-sealed thermal carafe, which I feel maintains flavor better. Ninja‚Äôs brewers are known for their versatility, but their glass carafes are more prone to breakage compared to BLACK+DECKER‚Äôs sturdy thermal alternative. What sets the CM2046S apart is its focus on simplicity and efficiency without unnecessary frills.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

In terms of pricing, this coffee maker strikes a balance between affordability and functionality. While it‚Äôs not the cheapest option available, the features it offers‚Äîlike the programmable timer, brew strength customization, and thermal carafe‚Äîmake it worth the investment. If you‚Äôre someone who values a straightforward, reliable coffee maker without a hefty price tag, this one is a solid choice.

From its **Vortex Technology** to the **programmable brewing options**, this coffee maker blends convenience and quality seamlessly. It‚Äôs not perfect, but it caters to most coffee lovers' needs effectively.

While these polymers are approved for food contact, whether they leach depends on several factors:

1. **Temperature** ‚Äì Nespresso machines brew at around 83-86¬∞C (181-187¬∞F). Some thermoplastics can degrade or release small amounts of compounds at high temperatures, though food-grade coatings are tested for stability under expected use conditions.

2. **Acidity** ‚Äì Coffee is acidic, which can increase the potential for chemical leaching over time, depending on the specific polymer used.

3. **Repeated Exposure** ‚Äì Since each pod is single-use, the exposure time is relatively short, reducing the likelihood of significant leaching compared to long-term food storage.

While manufacturers claim these coatings are safe and comply with regulations (such as EU and FDA food contact standards), independent studies on long-term exposure and cumulative effects of such linings in high-heat, acidic conditions are limited.

But in reality?

* Five different productivity apps cluttering my phone.
* A bunch of YouTube videos about ‚Äúhabits of successful people.‚Äù
* Still scrolling Reddit at 2 AM, wondering where my time went.

So I decided to try something new. I turned my entire life into a game.

For 30 days, I gave myself points for everything:

* Waking up early? +10 XP.
* Deep work session? +20 XP.
* Mindlessly scrolling TikTok? -50 XP.
* Skipping the gym? -100 XP.

I even set up little rewards ‚Äî extra gaming time, a fancy coffee, whatever kept me going.

At first, it was amazing. I felt like I had finally hacked my brain. Productivity was actually fun. I was getting shit done, waking up on time, and finally sticking to habits.

Then... things got weird.

Somewhere around week two, I caught myself doing push-ups just to earn five extra points. I started ‚Äúoptimizing‚Äù stupid things ‚Äî like drinking water ‚Äî because hey, free XP. At some point, I realized I wasn‚Äôt actually enjoying anything unless there was a number attached to it.

By the third week, I completely broke. I was so focused on tracking everything that I stopped caring about why I was doing any of it. I caught myself skipping a spontaneous walk with a friend because ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt part of the system.‚Äù

That‚Äôs when I realized I had basically turned my entire life into a checklist. And honestly? It kind of sucked.

I still think gamification works, but only in small doses. If everything becomes a game, you stop enjoying things just for the sake of doing them.

So now I‚Äôm wondering ‚Äî has anyone else tried something like this? Did it actually work for you, or did it just make things worse? Would love to hear how you guys approach this stuff.",351,1739199954.0,selfimprovement,67,0.97,False

The trick is to avoid all supermarket meats in the refrigerator section, and use a local grocery store with a butcher on the premises.  I order 50 pounds at a time, and he grinds it fresh for me, and packages it in 4 pound packages for me, then immediately freezes it for me.  I thaw it out, brown it loose, then repackage it in ZipLoc bags in meal size portions, then refreeze it. Then I microwave it and eat it. 

The store also freezes cases of 93% Turkey for me, and I cook it the same way I do the beef.  I use a stick of butter per 4 pounds of turkey  mainly to prevent sticking. 

I also eat steaks, but only freshly cut, then frozen for me. 

The last order I bought 50 pounds of Ground Round, 2 cases of 93% Ground turkey, and 10 Top Sirloin steaks at an discounted price beyond the sale price. Having a deep freezer is great. 

My diet is Ketovore, eating instant coffee with Pure Stevia and a splash of Heavy Cream, with 2 meals of beef or turkey.  After being on this diet less than a month, my heartburn/GERD/Reflux was GONE.

1im83t6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestCoffeeTables/comments/1im83t6/rolanstar_coffee_table_review_model_b08sbj45mn/,Rolanstar coffee table review model B08SBJ45MN insights: modern functionality meets retro charm,"Having spent some time with the Rolanstar coffee table, I can confidently say it‚Äôs more than just a piece of furniture; it‚Äôs a multitasking marvel. I decided to try it out in my living room, where space is at a premium and every piece of furniture needs to serve a purpose. As someone who works from home and often juggles family activities, this table seemed like a perfect fit.

The **design and style** of the table immediately caught my attention. Its retro industrial vibe feels both nostalgic and modern, blending seamlessly into my living room‚Äôs neutral d√©cor. The Espresso finish is rich yet understated, and the particleboard construction is surprisingly resilient. It doesn‚Äôt scream ‚Äúcheap furniture,‚Äù which is an issue I‚Äôve encountered with similar options in the past. The metal frame adds a touch of industrial sturdiness, and it‚Äôs clear that Rolanstar has put thought into durability here.

**Size-wise**, it‚Äôs compact enough for smaller spaces but still offers plenty of functionality. Measuring 19.7""D x 39.4""W x 18.2""H, it fits perfectly in front of my couch without overwhelming the room. Despite its manageable dimensions, the table doesn‚Äôt feel cramped or limited in utility.

The **storage and stability** are where this coffee table truly shines. Hidden compartments, two drawers, and an open lower shelf collectively provide ample storage. I‚Äôve used the drawers for remotes and coasters, while the hidden compartment under the lift-top is perfect for hiding away magazines, laptop chargers, and even some of my son‚Äôs toys. The lift-top mechanism, though a bit stiff at first, operates smoothly and quietly after some adjustment. I did notice a slight unevenness when lifting the top, but it hasn‚Äôt caused any real issues. The table feels stable, even when the lift-top is extended, and the weight of the tabletop (up to 100 pounds) speaks volumes about its sturdiness.

One of the best aspects is the **ease of maintenance**. The melamine veneer surface is resistant to water, heat, and dust, making it easy to clean with just a damp cloth. My niece spilled her juice during a family game night, and cleanup was a breeze‚Äîno stains, no stress.

**Assembly**, while not overly complicated, did require some patience. With clear instructions and a provided screwdriver, I managed to put it together solo in about an hour and a half. It‚Äôs worth noting that having an extra set of hands would have sped up the process. The additional screws and corner protectors are thoughtful touches, especially if you have little ones running around.

**Pros**

* The retro industrial design pairs well with various room styles.
* Lift-top mechanism provides a convenient, raised surface for dining or working.
* Multiple storage options, including hidden compartments and drawers, keep clutter at bay.
* Sturdy construction that feels durable and well-made.
* Easy to clean and maintain, thanks to a resistant veneer surface.

**Cons**

* Slight unevenness in the lift-top when opening.
* Drawers feel a bit thin compared to the rest of the table.
* Assembly can be time-consuming for one person.

In comparing this table to competitors like the SONGMICS lift-top coffee table or the Yaheetech coffee table, the Rolanstar excels in storage and style. The SONGMICS table offers a similar lift-top function but lacks the additional drawers and hidden compartments that make the Rolanstar so versatile. Meanwhile, the Yaheetech model, while cheaper, doesn‚Äôt quite match the sturdy feel or aesthetic appeal of the Rolanstar. However, the SONGMICS table does have a softer lift-top mechanism, which some users may prefer.

**Cost analysis and value for money** is always subjective, but I believe the Rolanstar strikes an excellent balance between affordability and quality. It‚Äôs well-priced for the features you‚Äôre getting, and it feels like a long-term investment rather than a temporary fix. While other tables might be slightly cheaper, they often sacrifice durability or storage capabilities.

The **features** of this table are what elevate it from a functional piece to an indispensable part of my living room. The lift-top is a game-changer for work-from-home days or casual meals in front of the TV. The hidden compartment has become a lifesaver for keeping clutter out of sight, and the lower shelf is ideal for books or decorative items. I‚Äôve found myself using this table far more than I expected, and it‚Äôs held up beautifully under daily use.

====================================================================================

I see many men struggle with weight. Sometimes, diet and exercise are hard. What if there was something extra to help? This is where **weight loss supplements for men** come in. But, wait! Are they truly good for everyone?

It can be confusing. So many options, and so many promises! I will help you understand the basics. **Weight management supplements for men** are not magic. But when used correctly, they may assist you.

First, I will talk about the important things to think about. Then I will explore how these supplements work. I want to guide you to make safe choices for your health. Consider this your starting point to learn if **weight loss pills for men** are right for you. There are many kinds of fat burner. Some work, and some do not.

Top Weight Loss Supplements for Men That Actually Work
------------------------------------------------------

Many men want to know: what really works? Let's talk about **effective weight loss supplements for men.** It is a crowded market, so I will share about proven options that are safe.

One great option is caffeine. Next, I want to discuss green tea extract. Green tea helps boost your metabolism. And then, there's protein powder.

Important note: supplements are *not* miracle workers. They work best with a good diet and exercise plan. So, remember to eat healthy foods and move your body. You will be able to see which **supplements to help men lose weight** are best with diet and exercise.

Protein Powder: The Cornerstone of Muscle Building and Weight Loss for Men
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Protein powder can be a great tool for **men‚Äôs weight loss**. It is not just for bodybuilders. I find that protein helps keep you full. This means you will not eat too much.

Also, protein is needed for muscle building. When you build muscle, your body burns more calories, even when resting. So, using protein powder can boost your **weight loss aids for men.**

There are many kinds. Whey protein is fast-digesting. Casein protein is slow-digesting. Choose what fits your needs. You need protein to build muscles.

Caffeine: The Energy Booster for Weight Loss
--------------------------------------------

Caffeine is not just for morning coffee. It also aids in weight loss. Caffeine is often found in **fat burners for men**.

Caffeine helps boost your energy and makes you feel more alert. It can also increase your metabolism, so you burn more calories. I want to say: be careful with caffeine. Too much can cause problems like jitters and sleep issues. So, start with a small dose.

Caffeine alone will not solve everything. Think of it as a helpful push when you combine caffeine with a workout plan and a healthy diet.

Evaluating The Effectiveness of Weight Loss Supplements
-------------------------------------------------------

It is important to assess if they truly work to determine the **effectiveness of weight loss supplements**. Remember, not all supplements are created equal. Some have strong research backing them. Others, not so much.

Look for studies that show the supplement works. Pay attention to the size of the study and who participated. Be careful of claims that sound too good to be true. These are often marketing tricks. Focus on finding **natural weight loss supplements for men**.

Also, think about your body. What works for one person may not work for another. Everyone is different. What works for one person may not work for you. Be aware of all the ingredients in the supplements you take.

Safety and Side Effects: What Men Need to Know Before Taking Weight Loss Supplements
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Safety is key before using any **weight loss supplements for men**. Do research. Understand the possible side effects. Many products have ingredients that can cause problems if used incorrectly.

Some supplements might raise your blood pressure. Others could interfere with medicines you take. It is smart to talk to your doctor before starting any new supplement. This is important, especially if you have health issues. They will advise you on the **safe weight loss supplements for men.** Your doctor will have your best interest at heart when looking at different supplements.

Common Side Effects of Weight Loss Supplements: Awareness and Management
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Be alert to side effects when taking **weight management supplements for men**. Side effects vary, from mild to serious. Mild side effects include stomach upset, headache, or trouble sleeping.

More serious side effects are also possible. These can include heart problems or liver damage. If you notice any unusual symptoms, stop taking the supplement. Immediately seek medical attention. The first time I took caffeine pills, it made me feel dizzy. So start small to avoid any symptoms.

Do not ignore changes in your body when starting something new. Listen to your body. It is important to take care of yourself.

Interactions with Medications: Consulting Your Doctor Before Taking Weight Loss Supplements
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do you take other medicines? Be careful about interactions. **Weight loss pills for men** can sometimes interfere with how other drugs work.

For example, some supplements can change how your body processes blood thinners. This can be very dangerous. Always tell your doctor about all the medicines and supplements you are taking. This includes vitamins and herbal products.

Your doctor can check for possible interactions. They can also tell you if a supplement is safe to take with your current medications. It is better to be safe.

Lifestyle Changes for Maximum Weight Loss Results
-------------------------------------------------

Supplements alone are not enough. To see real results, you need to also make changes to your lifestyle. Supplements will boost your weight loss and exercise routine.

Eat a healthy diet. Focus on whole foods like fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. Reduce processed foods, sugar, and unhealthy fats. Get regular exercise. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week.

Also, make sure you get enough sleep. Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep per night. When you combine these changes with **natural weight loss supplements for men**, you'll see results.

Dosage and Timing: How to Take Weight Loss Supplements for Men Effectively
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Understanding dosage and timing is important. Taking too much of a **supplement for men‚Äôs weight loss** is harmful. Not taking enough is pointless.

Read the label carefully. Follow the directions. Start with a lower dose to see how your body reacts. Pay attention to when you take the supplement. Some supplements work best when taken before a workout. Others are better taken with meals.

You need to know how much is right for you. You may not be losing weight if the dosage is too low.

### When to Take Your Weight Loss Supplements for Optimal Results

Timing matters when it comes to **weight loss aids for men**. Some supplements should be taken before a workout. This can give you more energy and help you burn more fat.

Other supplements are better taken with food. This can help your body absorb them properly. Some supplements, like protein powder, can be taken any time of day.

Figure out what time works best for you and your body. To figure this out you may need to try different times of the day. This will help you figure out when you need a boost in energy.

### How Much Weight Loss Supplement Is Right for You?

The right amount of a supplement changes from person to person. Many things affect the **weight loss supplements for men**, like your weight, height, and health.

What works for one person may not work for another. It is best to start with the lowest recommended dose. Watch how your body reacts. You can slowly increase the dose if needed.

If you experience any bad side effects, lower the dose or stop taking the supplement. Always listen to your body.

Conclusion
----------

- I want you to remember supplements are just one part of the weight loss journey. Diet, exercise, and sleep are equally important.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I cried and prayed so hard‚Ä¶ eventually it went away after an hour of so until i fell asleep‚Ä¶.

30th Jan - The attacks came back, this time at 2am after i slept at 11pm instead. Same symptoms as the previous day. I started to think if there is something wrong with my brain‚Ä¶ am i having a brain aneurysm, stroke or cancer‚Ä¶.? I started falling into a depressive state‚Ä¶


6th Feb - After a week since the last attack, when i thought the attacks have ended, the ninja headache strikes and slices my brain with the same symptoms, this time leaving behind a lingering headache after the attack.

7th Feb - The headache strikes back‚Ä¶. Same symptoms happen around the same time, i immediately grab the medicine and took a tablet each‚Ä¶. Headache went away within 30 minutes, but the caffeine kept me up all night‚Ä¶. Shadow headache continues to linger‚Ä¶

8th Feb - i started to wonder if the attacks are from triggers like coffee or alcohol (I don‚Äôt drink much in the first place, like a cup of coffee a day and a glass of alcohol twice monthly) so i stopped those. But attack still came that night‚Ä¶. Didnt eat medicine as I felt it is not a good long term solution to eat painkillers forever‚Ä¶. Started to sit in the shower to try to take the pain away‚Ä¶.cluster eventually faded but shadow headache persist

9th Feb - no attacks, i slept until 11am after many sleep deprived nights, shadow headache persisted but this time it went slightly to the right side(?)

San Diego, California, is a beautiful city known for its pristine beaches, stunning weather, and vibrant community. However, many people don't realize that the tap water quality in San Diego can vary depending on the location. While the water is generally safe to drink, it may contain contaminants such as chlorine, chloramines, lead, and other minerals that can affect the water's taste, odor, and overall quality.

This is where water filtration systems come in. By installing a water filtration system at home, San Diego residents can enjoy several benefits, including:

* **Improved taste and odor:** Water filtration systems can remove chlorine, chloramines, and other contaminants that can cause unpleasant tastes and odors in tap water.
* **Reduced health risks:** Some tap water contaminants can harm human health. Water filtration systems can help to remove these contaminants, providing cleaner and healthier water for drinking, cooking, and bathing.
* **Protection** **for** **appliances:** Hard water can damage dishwashers, washing machines, and coffee makers. Water filtration systems can soften hard water, protecting appliances and extending their lifespans.

Someone I was writing with came out of nowhere and told me that they don't think we're this great writing match. I can totally respect it, but they just totally hit me with the slew above.  
  
Let's hold on a second...

They ran my posts through an AI detector? For the record, AI detectors are notoriously inaccurate, often misjudge human writing and even made authentic writers leave the industry, because they'll be flagged. After receiving the message, I even ran my own work through 5 different AI detectors to only receive **0%  AI-Generated, 0% AI-Generated & AI-Refined, 0% Human-Written & AI-Refined**. They admitted the detector may be inaccurate, but still justified their reason for leaving due to it.

Not every writing pair will work out. Totally fine! However, comparing my writing to AI just because my writing is polished? That stung! Especially when I have to pick up the pieces of what's felt off.  
I assured them that I don't use AI. I just put effort into my posts and pointed out assumptions like this can be uncomfortable and insulting.

They wished to leave on amicable terms, which I appreciate. But I still couldn't get rid of the frustration of it. I don't mind if someone will say ""Hey, this isn't working out for me"" and then leaving as opposed to trying to force it to become right after that. The whole AI comparison--especially when it's not even true---just felt like drama I didn't need when I was sipping my coffee.

People who feel like they need to justify their own writing by deciding someone's too good and, therefore, must be using AI--please stop! It is hurtful. At the end of the day we're here to relax away from work, school and other responsibilities. If it doesn't mesh, then that's okay. But let's not turn this into some sort of robot interrogation.",7,1739198274.0,BadRPerStories,7,0.77,False

Welcome back to our¬†[UPG of the Week](https://imgur.com/a/XtSEkM3)!

**Quick reminder**: Typically I avoid smaller people groups. They absolutely need prayer but the research is wildly more difficult, up to the point that unless I want to dig up academic journals on JSTOR or something, I usually cannot find much info more than whats on Joshua Project.

*There is an aside here that I wish more missionaries would publish more about the peoples they work with and Joshua Project would compile more.*

Anyways, after u/Ciroflexo got me to do a ""small"" people group, I think that I will spend January and February doing smaller people groups that I haven't done before. Instead of millions they may have a few thousand.

This week we are looking at the¬†**Huasa in Congo**.

# Region: Congo - Sembe

**Stratus Index Ranking** **(Urgency): 60**

*It has been noted to me by* u/JCmathetes *that I should explain this ranking. Low numbers are more urgent, both physically and spiritually together, while high numbers are less urgent. The scale is 1-177, with one number assigned to each country. So basically on a scale from Afghanistan (1) to Finland (177), how urgent are the peoples physical and spiritual needs.*

**Climate:**¬†Since the country is located on the Equator, the climate is more consistent year-round, with the average day temperature a humid 24¬†¬∞C (75¬†¬∞F) and nights generally between 16¬†¬∞C (61¬†¬∞F) and 21¬†¬∞C (70¬†¬∞F). The average yearly rainfall ranges from 1,100 millimetres (43¬†in) in the¬†Niari Valley¬†in the south to over 2,000 millimetres (79¬†in) in central parts. The dry season is from June to August, while in the majority of the country, the wet season has 2 rainfall maxima: 1 in March‚ÄìMay and another in September‚ÄìNovember.

**Terrain:** Natural landscapes range from the¬†savanna¬†plains in the North Niari flooded forests, to the Congo River, to the rugged mountains and forests of¬†Mayombe, and 170¬†km of beaches. Congo lies within four terrestrial ecoregions:¬†Atlantic Equatorial coastal forests,¬†Northwestern Congolian lowland forests,¬†Western Congolian swamp forests, and¬†Western Congolian forest‚Äìsavanna mosaic.

**Wildlife of Congo:**¬†There are like 400 mammal species in the Republic of Congo, so naturally I won't list them all. Among the notable ones are elephants, lowland gorillas, hippos, African buffalo, duiker, sitatunga, hyena, bongo, leopards, giant forest hogs, a few species of mongooses, aardvark, pangolin, some bats, warthogs, otters, and lions. There are also whole bunch of awful snakes, some lizards, and a bunch of birds.

Unfortunately, there are a ton of monkeys and apes there :(

**Environmental Issues**: The primary environmental issues in Congo Brazzaville center around¬†deforestation due to unsustainable logging practices, illegal wildlife trade, oil extraction pollution, and the associated impacts on biodiversity loss within the Congo Basin rainforest, exacerbated by poor regulation and enforcement, leading to significant concerns regarding climate change and local community livelihoods;¬†population growth in certain areas also contributes to environmental pressures on the land and resources.

**Languages:**¬†Ethnologue¬†recognizes 62 spoken languages in the country.¬†The¬†Kongo¬†are the largest ethnic group and form roughly half of the population. The most significant subgroups of the Kongo are¬†Laari, in Brazzaville and Pool regions, and the¬†Vili, around Pointe-Noire and along the Atlantic coast. The second largest group is the¬†Teke, who live to the north of Brazzaville, with 16.9% of the population.¬†Mbochi¬†live in the north, east and in Brazzaville and form 13.1% of the population.¬†Pygmies¬†make up 2% of Congo's population. *The Huasa speak Huasa*

**Government Type:**¬†Unitary dominant-party semi-presidential republic under an authoritarian dictatorship

# People: Huasa in the Republic of Congo

[Huasa woman](https://preview.redd.it/ea0uvnrtmbie1.png?width=2304&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1198e543cd0049a4e1f51d843e6db2ca5a477f8)

**Population**: 13,000

**Estimated Foreign Workers Needed:** 2+

**Beliefs:** The Huasa are 0.68% Christian. That means out of their population of 13,000, there are *maybe* 88 Christians. Thats one believer for every 147 unbelievers.

The Hausa culture is strongly linked to Islam, which makes it difficult to reach this people group with the gospel. There has been intense persecution of the Christian Hausa. Because Islam has been carried throughout West Africa by Hausa traders and priests, nearly everyone expects a Hausa to be Muslim. This could be one of the main reasons why the Hausa stay so resistant to the gospel and have difficulty leaving their Islamic faith.

**History:** *This is a history of all the Huasa people (mainly Nigeria I think), not just the ones in the Congo.*

Daura, in northern¬†Nigeria, is the oldest city of¬†Hausaland. The Hausa of¬†Gobir, also in northern Nigeria, speak the oldest surviving classical vernacular of the¬†language. All of the various ethnic groups among and around the Hausa live in the vast and open lands of the Sahel, Saharan and Sudanian¬† regions, and as a result of the geography and the criss crossing network of traditional African trade routes, have had their cultures heavily influenced by their Hausa neighbors.

In the 7th century, the¬†Dalla Hill¬†in¬†Kano¬†was the site of a Hausa community that migrated from¬†Gaya¬†and engaged in iron-working. The¬†Hausa Bakwai¬†kingdoms were established around the 7th to 11th centuries.

The Hausa Kingdoms were independent political entities in what is now¬†Northern Nigeria. The Hausa city states emerged as southern terminals of the Trans-Saharan caravan trade. Like other cities such as¬†Gao¬†and¬†Timbuktu¬†in the¬†Mali Empire, these city states became centres of long-distance trade. Hausa merchants in each of these cities collected trade items from domestic areas such as leather, dyed cloth, horse gear, metal locks and kola nuts from the rain forest region to the south through trade or slave raiding, processed (and taxed) them and then sent them north to cities along the¬†Mediterranean.¬†By the 12th century AD, the Hausa were becoming one of Africa's major trading powers, competing with¬†Kanem-Bornu¬†and the¬†Mali Empire. The primary exports were¬†leather,¬†gold,¬†cloth,¬†salt,¬†kola nuts,¬†slaves, animal hides, and¬†henna. Certainly trade influenced religion. By the 14th century, Islam was becoming widespread in Hausaland as¬†Wangara¬†scholars, scholars and traders from¬†Mali¬†and also from the¬†Maghreb¬†brought the religion with them

By the early 15th century, the Hausa were using a modified¬†Arabic script¬†known as¬†ajami¬†to record their own language. The Hausa compiled several written histories, the most popular being the¬†Kano Chronicle.¬†Many medieval Hausa manuscripts similar to the¬†Timbuktu Manuscripts¬†written in the Ajami script have been discovered recently, some of them describing¬†constellations¬†and¬†calendars.

The legendary Queen¬†Amina¬†(or Aminatu) is believed to have ruled¬†Zazzau¬†between the 15th century and the 16th century for a period of 34 years. Amina was 16 years old when her mother, Bakwa Turunku became queen and she was given the traditional title of¬†*Magajiya*, an honorific borne by the daughters of monarchs. She honed her military skills and became famous for her bravery and military exploits, as she is celebrated in song as ""Amina, daughter of Nikatau, a woman as capable as a man.""¬†Amina is credited as the architectural overseer who created the strong earthen walls that surround her city, which were the prototype for the fortifications used in all Hausa states. She subsequently built many of these fortifications, which became known as ganuwar Amina or Amina's walls, around various conquered cities.

The objectives of her conquests were twofold: extension of her nation beyond its primary borders and reducing the conquered cities to a vassal status. Sultan¬†Muhammad Bello¬†of¬†Sokoto¬†stated that, ""She made war upon these countries and overcame them entirely so that the people of Katsina paid tribute to her and the men of Kano and... also made war on cities of¬†Bauchi¬†till her kingdom reached to the sea in the south and the west."" Likewise, she led her armies as far as¬†Kwararafa¬†and¬†Nupe¬†and, according to the Kano Chronicle, ""The Sarkin Nupe sent her (i.e. the princess) 40 eunuchs and 10,000 kola nuts.""

At some point maybe the Huasa kingdoms fell?

From 1804 to 1808, the¬†Fulani, another Islamic African ethnic group that spanned West Africa and have settled in Hausaland since the early 1500s, with support of already oppressed Hausa peasants revolted against oppressive cattle tax and religious persecution under the new king of¬†Gobir, whose predecessor and father had tolerated Muslim evangelists and even favoured the leading Muslim cleric of the day,¬†Sheikh¬†Usman Dan Fodio¬†whose life the new king had sought to end.¬†Sheikh¬†Usman Dan Fodio¬†fled¬†Gobir¬†and from his sanctuary declared Jihad on its king and all Habe dynasty kings for their alleged greed, paganism, injustices against the peasant class, use of heavy taxation and violation of the standards of Sharia law. The Fulani and Hausa cultural similarities as a Sahelian people however allowed for significant integration between the two groups.

British colonial administrator¬†Frederick Lugard¬†exploited rivalries between many of the emirs in the south and the central Sokoto administration to counter possible defence efforts as his men marched toward the capital.¬†As the British approached the city of Sokoto, the new Sultan¬†Muhammadu Attahiru I¬†organised a quick defence of the city and fought the advancing British-led forces. The British emerged triumphant, sending Attahiru I and thousands of followers on a¬†Mahdist¬†*hijra*.

On 13 March 1903 at the grand market square of Sokoto, the last Vizier of the Caliphate officially conceded to British rule. The British appointed¬†Muhammadu Attahiru II¬†as the new Caliph.¬†Lugard abolished the Caliphate, but retained the title¬†*Sultan*¬†as a symbolic position in the newly organised¬†Northern Nigeria Protectorate.¬†In June 1903, the British defeated the remaining forces of Attahiru I, who was¬†killed in action; by 1906 resistance to British rule had ended with the conquest of Hadejia and the death of Sarki Muhammadu Mai Shahada of Hadejia as the last Emirate standing in Sokoto Caliphate. The area of the Sokoto Caliphate was divided among the control of the British, French, and Germans under the terms of the¬†Berlin Conference.

The British established the¬†Northern Nigeria Protectorate¬†to govern the region, which included most of the Sokoto empire and its most important emirates. Under Lugard, the various emirs were provided significant local autonomy, thus retaining much of the political organisation of the Sokoto Caliphate.¬†The Sokoto area was treated as just another emirate within the Nigerian Protectorate. Because it was never connected with the railway network, it became economically and politically marginal.

The Sultan of Sokoto continued to be regarded as an important Muslim spiritual and religious position; the lineage connection to dan Fodio has continued to be recognised. One of the most significant Sultans was¬†Siddiq Abubakar III, who held the position for 50 years from 1938 to 1988. He was known as a stabilising force in Nigerian politics, particularly in 1966 after the assassination of¬†Ahmadu Bello, the Premier of Northern Nigeria.

Following the construction of the¬†Nigerian railway system, which extended from¬†Lagos¬†in 1896 to¬†Ibadan¬†in 1900 and¬†Kano¬†in 1911, the Hausa of northern Nigeria became major producers of groundnuts. They surprised the British authorities, who had expected the Hausa to turn to cotton production. However, the Hausa had sufficient agricultural expertise to realise cotton required more labour and the European prices offered for groundnuts were more attractive than those for cotton. ""Within two years the peasant farmers of Hausaland were producing so many tonnes of groundnuts that the railway was unable to cope with the traffic. As a result, the European merchants in Kano had to stockpile sacks of groundnuts in the streets."" (Shillington 338).

[A depiction of a Huasa man from 1909](https://preview.redd.it/ygh7kvxnmbie1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=e214e19d6506876873694ab9969826cbb99d0fef)

**Culture:**¬†*Typical qualification that all people groups can't be summed up in small paragraphs and this is an over generalization.*

The Hausa in West Africa have been heavily involved in long distance trading for centuries. Traders exchanged gold from the Middle East for leather, crafts, and food.

There is inter-marriage between the Hausa community and the peoples of Benin. Marriages between the two communities are very common. Today members of the Hausa community are highly trained, educated, and assimilated into the political and social life in Benin. Some of the Hausas have become very rich. They are deeply involved in the politics of their communities.

The Hausa people have a restricted dress code related to their Muslim religious beliefs. The men are easily recognizable because of their elaborate dress which is a large flowing gown known as Babban riga and a robe called a jalabia. These large flowing gowns usually feature some elaborate embroidery designs around the neck. The women can be identified by wrappers called zani, made with colorful cloth atampa, accompanied by a matching blouse, head tie, and shawl.

Hausa buildings are characterized by the use of dry mud bricks in cubic structures, multi-storied buildings for the social elite, the use of parapets related to their military/fortress building past, and traditional white stucco and plaster for house fronts. At times the facades may be decorated with various abstract relief designs, sometimes painted in vivid colors to convey information about the occupant.

[The Hausa emblem is an older and traditionally established emblem of Hausa identity - the 'Dagin Arewa' or 'Northern knot' - in a star shape, used in historic and traditional architecture, design and hand-embroidery](https://preview.redd.it/d5tc4pgkfbie1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=366e11b7a44049995c101347ede75642b65774f4)

**Cuisine**: Huasa food varies across countries but by and large is does have staples:

* Koko¬†‚Äì A porridge made from¬†millet,¬†maize,¬†guinea corn¬†and¬†tiger nut.
* Kosai¬†‚Äì A dish made from peeled beans formed into a ball and deep-fried in¬†palm oil.
* Kunu¬†‚Äì A beverage made from millet.

* Coffee¬†and¬†bread¬†‚Äì Although not a traditional breakfast item, these have become common in Hausa cuisine as a result of¬†British colonization.
* Dambun shinkafa - an¬†hausa¬†delicacy made from¬†maize¬†known as tsaki or rice, moringa leaves and¬†carrot
* Dan wake¬†‚Äì Bean dumplings, eaten with either palm or¬†peanut oil.
* Olele - a¬†steamed¬†or boiled bean¬†pudding¬†made from a mixture of washed and peeled¬†beans¬†and onions, fresh red peppers, spices, and often fish, eggs, chicken and/or¬†crayfish.
* Tuwon masara¬†‚Äì A¬†swallow¬†madricee from maize, millet or guinea corn flour.
* Tuwon shinkafa¬†‚Äì A swallow made from rice.
* Miyan kuka¬†‚Äì A soup made from dried baobab leaves ground into powder.
* Miyan taushe¬†‚Äì A soup made from pumpkin.
* Okra¬†soup
* Funkaso - savoury fried¬†dumpling made with wheat and eaten with soup, honey or sugar
* Tuo Zaafi - consists of cooked maize dough with a little dried cassava dough and¬†water¬†without¬†salt.
* Kuli-kuli¬†‚Äì A deep-fried snack made from ground peanuts and spices.
* Masa ‚Äì A type of rice cake that is typically served with a spicy sauce.
* Kunun gyada ‚Äì A sweetened peanut milk.
* Dakuwa ‚Äì A sweet snack made from crushed peanuts and sugar.

# Prayer Request:

* Pray for the majority culture of Congo that is largely Christian to get off their butts and go share the Gospel and love their neighbors, the Huasa.
* Pray for the few Huasa believers to be filled with the love and the power of the Holy Spirit so they will be equipped to preach, teach, and disciple.
* Pray that Bibles will be effectively distributed throughout the Congo and have a strong spiritual impact on the Huasa people.
* Ask the Lord to raise up strong local churches among the Huasa in the Congo.
* Ask the Lord to tear down barriers to the Gospel so that those Christian workers who live and work among the Huasa will see fruit.
* Pray that God will establish missionaries among them who are committed to their needs.
* Pray against Putin and his insane little war.
* Pray for our nation (the United States), that we Christians can learn to come alongside our hurting brothers and sisters and learn to carry one another's burdens in a more Christlike manner than we have done historically.
* Pray that in this time of chaos and panic that the needs of the unreached are not forgotten by the church. Pray that our hearts continue to ache to see the unreached hear the Good News.

*Brothers, my heart‚Äôs desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved. (Romans 10:1)*

I (M24) was in a 14 month relationship between the ages of 20-21 (for context, she was 18-19 and is now F22). Almost 3 years ago, she left due to losing feelings, but immediately after the breakup she was a mess and was really affectionate with me - she also couldn't stop reaching out. She couldn't make up her mind on the situation, but then suddenly went quite cold. So, I put us in No Contact and we have been in it ever since (between the breakup and NC, we texted about two times and she met me one night, where she was a mess and had been all over the place - it's the weirdest loose end breakup I've ever experienced).

Since then I've moved through life and grown up a lot, I genuinely believe myself to have moved on to the extent possible. I've dated other people and I'm not daft enough to assume she hasn't. But for quite a while now, I really cannot stop thinking about her, who she'll be/was, and what she'll have been up to/what's next for her.

I've been really thinking about reaching out for a coffee or even a quick catch up. What do you guys think? Or are the odds not in my favour?

I graduated 2 years ago and have changed significantly since. She'll be graduating soon. We live in the same city, really quite near each other. We were really important parts of each other's lives during essential, formative periods, and were best friends until the breakup.

I feel that my fire has been put out and slowed due to Vata tendencies (skipping meals, erratic sleeping, etc) and maybe also kapha sluggishness. 

I tried to search for something like this but I could only find Vata. 

I think my issue with not losing weight has to do with not living in alignment with my dosha. I just learned this. 

But I believe in 2017 I lost 40ish lbs due to, (unknowingly) adhering to my dosha. I did 10 min of yoga every morning and night, I ate 3 meals a day whether I was hungry or not, I drank 2 liters of lukewarm water everyday, I slept 9+ hours and took naps whenever I felt like it, and i kept my stress low. 

Now I have more  life stress and my routine, I gained 60 lbs, and any attempt of cutting calories has made my hunger insatiable and then I binge. 

I read that this is what pitta dosha does when skipping meals. 

I heard that skipping breakfast is the biggest bad thing a pitta can do for weight loss. So I'm now drinking slightly cool smoothies. And instead of iced coffee, I'm drinking warm coffee in the morning. 

Any advice is very appreciated!

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I'm now turning 30, a practicing barrister with two masters degrees in law. And I am struggling. Majorly. I haven't been sending out invoices for over a year, I feel overwhelmed all of the time and even the tiniest things like making a cup of coffee feel overwhelming. The only thing I'm able to do is my work in court - it's the only time my brain feels functional and I survive off the high it gives me. I struggle to eat, make food, dress, clean up, communicate - sometimes I go days without being able to talk.

My dad works nearby and I see him every now and again. We have a good relationship, but I have always worked so hard to make sure he doesn't have to worry about me and that I can look after myself - he's been through so much in his life. 

Here's what I need advice on - would it be wrong of me to ask him to come over a few times a week just to help with day to day stuff?

1im72h1,https://www.reddit.com/r/JanabMadamIbrahim/comments/1im72h1/it_was_a_well_planned_move_by_the_couple_pipika/,It was a well planned move by the couple.. Pipika is way more cunning and clever than we think her to be ! Till yesterday I was wondering what exactly made them wake up suddenly and reopen the rumour but here is my two cents regarding how their minds played behind this whole scenario.. (long read),"1. In few vlogs NF had threatened to come with ""proofs"" if only Madam ever denies the claim of having a daughter! NF also mentioned couple of times how they came contact with some ""main characters"" of Madam's past. Now when they were finally getting some good comments from their supporters, they just probably wanted to instigate NF to come with the ""proofs"" . They wanted to know to what extent NF knows about that kid. How strong their ""proofs"" are. Remember them repeatedly emphasising on ""valid proof leke aao"". Somewhere they knew NF were never going to provide anyyy direct proofs , it would somewhere still be limited to Chats screenshots and max to max voice recordings, which they can still deny saying those are fake and aren't ""true"" ! They knew NF were never going to use their official names either, so they took the risk ! 

2. At very starting of their speech, Janab clearly mentioned ""jisko believe karna hain kare, na karna hain na kare, iske baad humare taraf se aur koi reactions nehi ayega, hum iss baat ko yehi end karte hain"" ... This is the biggest trick they played! Inn dono ko definitely pata tha NF chup nehi beithenge aur wo kuch na kuch leke to ayenge. Inn dono ko bass yehi dekhna tha ki wo kaisa proofs hain. Baki baat hain trolling ki,in end 2022, She was brutally trolled for award function night fiasco, then Dabba's wedding outfits and if those were not enough, MR came into the picture ! They went underground and came back with her pregnancy news ! eventually sab chup chap ho gaya tha ! Coming to current scenario,Wase bhi unke haters NF proofs laye ya na laye, inke baaton pe kabhi nehi believe karne wale the ""oh now they have denied ,to MR nehi hain"". Wo to wase bhi Maasoom Rishta me believe hi karne wale the ! To kya phadak padta hain inn dheeth creatures ko ki phirse ye haters ekbar pher troll kare ! At this point they don't really bother what their hardcore haters think because they have overcome the main shock which they got when MR was exposed for the very first time , 
At least NF kya proofs leke aye ye to pata chale. 

3. They also can do this for Ruhaan.I am sure they have discussed it with their manager, advisors and also with Dabba Ammi Mummy before reopening this topic. In future if Ruhaan ever questions them, they can at least show the videos or articles how they had have dismissed the rumours while it were just some ""jealous"" haters spreading ""baseless rumours"" against his so called not so famous parents ! 

4. Pipika doing master chef and Janab may also join a new show. If by chance any media house questions either of them regarding this, they can say we have clearly denied this rumour and we will not talk about it anymore. Their most favourite line ""jisko jo sochna hain sochne do"". 

5. The first time it was exposed, neither they nor the public were prepared. It was a massive shocker for all ! But this time when they themselves came forward and rediscussed this after two years , you know they weren't fools. They knew what they were doing. They knew unless or untill the ""Ex"" himself comes forward and says something ( which he's not going to do anyways who knows due to NDA may be) , no screenshot or indirect proofs without names going to create reactions among public as massive as the last time ! This time it will be limited among the haters , NF followers ,sub reddit, Bee podcasters and Tea coffee pages ! And obviously, people who follow these pages already strongly believe in MR so nothing major going to change for them even after them denying or NF producing the ""proofs"" ! 

6. Coming to media , Saniya's case caught the direct media attentions and exposure as she directly used Pipika's actual name - she didn't use names like Madam Pipika etc. but regarding this, neither NF nor the woman Prachi used Pipika's name. Even if we share the videos or tag the media pages, they are not going to cover stories based on the videos where no official names are used - media won't cover news of ""Madam"" ""Janab"" ""Massom Rishta"" and ""Dabba"" ! Pipika is too clever to miss this point ! 

7. I watched her clips at MC set today and she looked least bothered ( unlike last time ) and she knows this MasterChef thing and May be Janab's new show ( if he gets one ) will eventually silent this Massom Rishta rumours again. But as overall outcomes at least now they know to what extent NF knows about MR. It's Still about Amma Amir Maudaha people and some screenshots from the people of her past - strong enough to make us believe in MR but not strong enough to send some chills through her spine ! 

8. Last one but least possibility - as it was first leaked from Janab's side ( which is also Pipika's side ) , NF exposed this due to Pipika, so may be ..may be, they got some notice from Samsung for breaching of contacts and ruining the kids privacy!? Remember her saying ""she has grown up ,goes to school and people make assumptions that she is my daughter"" ( though she said this about her child co actor from ssk, but you never know ! It could be indirectly regarding MR as well ! )
So may be they had to now break their silence and deny this ,knowing Samsung or his direct family members are never going to reveal anything!? 

Phew ! I know it was a long read and I took more than half n hour to put these thoughts in words but this is all I could guess as the probable reasons of their sudden ""unnecessary"" move ! What do you guys think !? ",10,1739196947.0,JanabMadamIbrahim,7,0.81,False
1im71ii,https://www.reddit.com/r/skincaredevices/comments/1im71ii/circadian_optics_lumine_light_therapy_lamp_review/,Circadian Optics Lumine Light Therapy Lamp Review: A Daily Boost for Energy and Mood,"As someone who often struggles with the darker winter months, I had high hopes for the Circadian Optics Lumine Light Therapy Lamp. This lamp, with its promise of combating Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), caught my attention for both its design and functionality. After using it daily for several weeks, I can confidently share my experience‚Äîboth the highs and the lows.

The design of the Circadian Optics Lumine is modern and sleek. I found its compact, square-shaped build to be a perfect addition to my desk without taking up much space. It's lightweight yet feels sturdy, and the gray color blends seamlessly with my home office setup. The materials, though plastic, don‚Äôt feel cheap and seem durable enough to withstand daily use.

The light intensity is impressive. It boasts 10,000 lux of full-spectrum, UV-free brightness, which is the recommended level for effective light therapy. I initially underestimated how bright this small device could be; it‚Äôs not something you want to stare directly into, but when placed at arm‚Äôs length, it provides a natural, energizing glow. There are three adjustable brightness settings, which I found helpful for tailoring the light intensity based on the time of day or my sensitivity.

I appreciated the color temperature, which sits at 5500K. It mimics natural daylight without the harshness of traditional blue light, making it easier on the eyes. My mornings now start with the lamp on its highest setting while I sip my coffee and check emails. It‚Äôs a ritual that has genuinely elevated my mood and energy levels.

Using the Circadian Optics Lumine is a breeze. The single-button control is intuitive‚Äîjust a tap cycles through the brightness levels. However, I did miss having a built-in timer, which would have been a convenient addition. I ended up setting a timer on my phone to ensure I didn‚Äôt overdo my sessions.

Portability is another highlight. Weighing just one pound and measuring 6.69 x 3.94 x 6.3 inches, it‚Äôs easy to move around the house or even pack for travel. I‚Äôve taken it to my office on particularly gloomy days, where it comfortably sat on my desk without feeling intrusive.

Safety is paramount with any light therapy device, and this lamp delivers. Being UV-free means it doesn‚Äôt expose users to harmful radiation, and the flicker-free LED lights are gentle on the eyes. I felt confident using it daily, knowing it‚Äôs both effective and safe.

While I experienced many benefits, there are a few areas where the device fell short. The lack of a timer, as mentioned, is a noticeable oversight. Additionally, the lamp‚Äôs power cord, though long, isn‚Äôt detachable, which can make packing it slightly awkward. Lastly, while the lamp‚Äôs brightness is undoubtedly effective, it may be too intense for individuals sensitive to light, even at the lower settings.

**Pros**

* Compact and stylish design that fits well in any space.
* High-intensity 10,000 lux brightness with three adjustable settings.
* UV-free, full-spectrum light that‚Äôs safe and comfortable for daily use.
* Lightweight and portable, making it easy to move or travel with.
* Simple, one-button operation for user-friendly control.

**Cons**

* Missing a built-in timer, requiring external timing devices.
* Non-detachable power cord can feel cumbersome for storage or travel.
* Brightness levels may still be too intense for some individuals.

Compared to competitors like the Verilux HappyLight and the Carex Day-Light Classic Plus, the Circadian Optics Lumine stands out for its modern design and portability. The Verilux HappyLight, while effective, tends to be bulkier and less visually appealing, making it less suitable for small spaces. On the other hand, the Carex model offers a broader light surface and a built-in timer but comes at a significantly higher price point. If you‚Äôre looking for a balance between performance, design, and cost, the Circadian Optics Lumine strikes a sweet spot.

Speaking of cost, this lamp offers great value for its features. It‚Äôs not the cheapest option on the market, but its durability, design, and effectiveness justify the investment. Considering its long-lasting LEDs with a 50,000-hour lifespan, it‚Äôs unlikely you‚Äôll need a replacement anytime soon.

One of the standout features I noticed was how quickly it worked for me. After just a couple of days, I felt more alert and less sluggish during my mornings. My coworker, who also struggles with SAD, borrowed it for a week and reported similar improvements in mood and focus. Even my plants seemed to thrive under its light when I left it on longer than usual‚Äîan unexpected bonus!

If you‚Äôre someone who battles the winter blues or just needs a mood boost on dreary days, this lamp is worth considering. Even my skeptical friend, who initially dismissed light therapy as ‚Äúfancy desk lighting,‚Äù admitted to feeling more energized after a few sessions.
