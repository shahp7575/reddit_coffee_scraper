1q2cck6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1q2cck6/lately_ive_been_enjoying_mornings_a_lot_more_than/,Lately I’ve been enjoying mornings a lot more than I used to,"I used to hate mornings. Everything felt rushed — alarms, getting ready, immediately thinking about what I had to do next. I was basically just trying to get through them.

Recently, though, I’ve noticed a small shift. I wake up a bit earlier without forcing it, make a coffee or tea, and just sit quietly for a few minutes before the day really starts. No productivity goal, no big routine — just a slow start.

It’s nothing life-changing, but it feels grounding in a way I didn’t expect. Almost like the day feels more manageable when it doesn’t start in a hurry.

Anyone else find their relationship with mornings changing over time?",1,1767392004.0,CasualConversation,0,1.0,False
1q2cbxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/rollercoasters/comments/1q2cbxd/phantasialand_trip_report_ending_my_14year_roller/,[Phantasialand] Trip Report - Ending my 14-year roller coaster hiatus,"I had a 14-year (unintentional) hiatus from theme parks and roller coasters (my last trip was Fiesta Texas in March 2011). After 14 long years, I decided to break this hiatus with a trip to…Phantasialand. Most of my theme park experience has been mostly Texas based (SFAW, SFFT, SFOT, Schlitterbahn) with one time trips to SFMM, CGA, SDC, & WDW, so I was excited to finally visit both my first foreign park and first non-English speaking park. 

Walking into this park, I literally felt like a kid on Christmas morning, knowing you're about to have one of the best days of your life. And oh man, does this park deliver.  I didn't have a set plan, so I just wandered around for a bit and would ride the first coaster I came across. 

Winja Force - The first ride to break my 14-year hiatus. This was also my first wild mouse and spinning ride. I was quite excited to finally cross those off my list of firsts. Since the line was building for both Winjas, I decided to save Fear for later. 

Crazy Bats - my first VR coaster. The VR feels lower resolution and outdated. I think my preference would be to ride it as a dark ride instead. The ride does feel quite long with three lift hills and overall I enjoyed it. 

Rookburgh - I can only describe the experience of walking through the tunnel into this area as like stepping through the doors of Narnia (the steampunk version). The coaster gliding around in the background feels like some mythical flying machine soaring overhead. It's diving in and out of buildings. Since you can't see the entire track, the ride feels like it pops out of nowhere. F.L.Y. has this long meandering queue, which starts from the center of Rookburgh and it makes its way over towards the side and then weaves around the edge. Fortunately, there weren't many people in line, but it would be hard to judge the length of the line from where you are at any point. You get excellent views of both the ride and Rookburgh. There's even a few sets and offices adding the way. Eventually as you make your way closer to the station, you'll get a wristband for a locker. You have to pull everything out of your pockets and go through a metal detector. The park does not have netting or other protective measures in place between the ride and the walkways. 

F.L Y. - Have you ever entered a ride station and knew immediately you're about to ride your next \#1? The track is sideways (as if you're looking top down), with the seats rotated 90°. So you start off sitting down into the seat, and then the train rotates both seats as the track bends into the flying position for the launch. F.L.Y.’s setting is incredible. Every turn feels like a near miss and you're gliding over people down below. There's very little in place as far as netting, so this feels like the closest you could get to an active roller coaster.

Talocan - incredibly well themed top spin with a long ride time. It was a walk on. There are more people watching this ride than actually riding it. 

Colorado Adventure - Vekoma Custom Mine Train - one of the more kid friendly rides. The nice forces in quite long at 3 minutes with 3 lift hills

Black Mamba (2) - B&M Custom Invert - definitely my new favorite B&M inversions. Another ride where the setting puts on a whole other level. First time I've seen a Park put a pathway through a vertical loop (RCT). Two rides, including one front row. This was my first custom invert. 

Taron (2) - Intamin multi launch - most popular coaster in the park. Incredible setting. Turns a very snappy and lots of close calls over the walkways. Some interaction with Raik. The second launch is definitely exhilarating. 

Raik - Vekoma Custom Family Boomerang - my first custom boomerang. Walk on. Very short by Phantasialand standards. It has some nice interaction with Taron. Definitely one and done for me. I had a funny interaction with the ride op. I had just gotten coffee prior to this ride, and was expecting to drink it while waiting in the single rider queue. I get to the front, and there's no line. I back away from the entrance a few feet just to make it clear I am not expecting to hop on the next train while I finish my coffee, but the ride op seemed to interpret it as me expecting to take my drink on the ride and started telling me this in German. Even after retiring, he kept muttering to himself in annoyance about it.

My one complaint about the park is the lack of water fountains (uncommon in most of Western Europe). It's not a huge issue for me to refill water bottles from a sink, but I did see several employees having to cup water into their hands to drink it. Not a great look for the park. 

Mystery Castle (2)  - indoor drop tower - walk on. Another new favorite of mine. Incredible theming. 

Chocolate Museum - this might be more fun if you have family or friends with you, but I enjoy the line theming more than the actual ride 

Fun House - this might be my first true long fun house. Lots of fun. Would do again 

Winjas Fear - I enjoyed Force more, but still a great ride. 

F.L.Y. (3) - I wrapped up the day with three more rides on F.L.Y. I did meet a fellow American Thoosie from Chicago. And I got front row seat on my final ride. For some reason, the only other people on the train were at the back, so I felt like I had the whole train to myself.

I did enjoy dinner at Brühler Wirtshaus am Schloss (train station restaurant) it would recommend after a long day at the park. 

Overall, I would call this my top theme park experience. The rides at this park feel long, which is remarkable to me considering they're using a relatively small plot of land. The theming is just incredible. Every little detail has some kind of theming, even the bathrooms. I did skip the water rides (temps were in the 50s), which I will definitely check out the next time I visit. Of the parks I've been to in 2025, this one definitely felt like the best value. The entrance ticket was about average, but food was relatively inexpensive inside. And it didn't feel like the park was trying to upsell you.

13 rides on all 8 coasters 
3 flat rides
1 dark ride

They quickly took away the ""oopsie"" sets. Thank you Coffee for introducing me to Jmail and inspiring me to do this compare and contrast project that has since been haunting my dreams.

  
I have spent an inordinate amount of time comparing the thumbnails between the first oopsie, the second oopsie, and the final release. Most changes happened between ""oopsie 1"" and ""oopsie 2"". As I spend more of my weekend compiling that portion, and verifying my scribbly pages of notes, I decided to leave you all with the shorter set. 

I present to you, The files on ""oopsie"" volume 2 that were removed or altered for the final release. Please use the wonderful Jmail Jfiles to view these hidden gems. I will upload a snippit from some of them. The file numbers presented to you can only be found in the version 2 files of volume one. (vol8-2 on Jdrive). It seems Jdrive links now work again <3 Thank you Jmail for making this all possible <3

Files on Version 2:

19416 (replaced on the final version)(aka lines up with #19416 on the final version)

19424 (skipped on final version)

21663 (replaced on the final version)(aka lines up with #31251 on final)

UNNUMBERED (skipped on final. I added better redactions in the image.)

Like I said, the change log between version 1 and 2 is going to be much, much longer. I am still working on typing that up and imaging some of them. It is very time consuming and a labor of love that I hope to complete this weekend. 

As I have seen so far, most of the removed items had nothing to do with witness information, but some did. I will continue to do my best to protect the innocent, while providing you unbiased numbers and documents. Therefore, when there is witness information in any volume changes/alterations set, I won't include the file number in those logs and will do my best to make sure they are better censored to further protect their privacy. of course I may provide pertinent information to journalists (for verification) though direct message, though they will need to assure protection of the witness's details.

I don't have preferences if shoulder bag or handbag, so this is not helping to chose

**Oleada**

Pros

Really nice combination of colors and materials to combine with outfits and add a nice texture.

Practically Oleada can fit more/bigger things such as a small notebook or a book.

Plus, multiple options on how to wear it - crossbody, shoulder bag, backpack, handbag.

I know that Oleada is heavily inspired by Loro Piana but in terms of budget this is optimal option for me.

Cons

Shipping from NA, which makes me upset as there are lots of EU handbag options. Would be logically to consider something closer... But I like to be irrational.

**Polene**

Pros

I was eyeing Polene for a long time and couldn't afford it before. I really love this #9 version. Insanely beautiful design, closing the itch of wanting Polene for such a long time. I wanted a shoulder bag for casual outings for coffee and city walks and dates. Ahh... a dream.  
I am worried that Black cherry might not look bad in summer, not sure, that's why considering also camel.  
Jewel tones suit me most - I am thinking that clothes in dark colors (burgundy navy) and these 2 color options would match nicely.

Cons

This bag looks a bit stiff in different positions on the shoulder as straps are not flexible.

Polene is also pricier than Oleada. How do you gals justify for yourselves such spendings? I am so uncomfortable to allow it to myself psychologically, even tho I can afford it.",1,1767391625.0,handbags,1,1.0,False

In this hobby it’s really easy to fall into the cycle of influencers and marketing teams building up the fomo…leading many of use to fretfully wonder what our coffee could be if we just had a different grinder, a new dripper, a different kettle, etc. In reality I think 99% of us would just be happier if we just used the gear we already have and learn to brew around its strengths and potential shortcomings, while  ignoring the hype. 

I had be searching high and low trying to find the perfect vessel for weighing, sorting, and transferring beans to my grinder.

Most AI advice sounds like “just use ChatGPT”, which is way too vague. What actually helps is having tiny, focused tools that do one job extremely well.

Here are 10 mini AI tools I use for real-life work and side projects – each takes 30–60 seconds to use and costs less than a coffee:

**1. AI-Powered Lead Generator**  
Give it your audience, offer and goal, and it suggests specific lead gen angles and assets (lead magnets, outreach angles, hooks) you can ship this week – not “in theory”, but concrete campaigns you can test.

**2. Buyer Journey Audit**  
Drop in your site and get an audit for awareness, consideration and decision stages. It tells you where you’re losing people and gives suggestions for extra pages, proof and CTAs.

**3. Value Positioning Analyzer**  
Paste your offer and a few competitor summaries. It highlights where you sound generic and suggests sharper, more differentiated positioning.

**4. Smart Job Application Assistant**  
Paste a job description and your CV. It helps you reframe your skills, write a tailored letter and align your LinkedIn profile in one workflow.

**5. LinkedIn Post Idea Generator**  
Tell it who you are and who you serve, and it outputs a list of angles and post ideas that actually fit your niche, not generic “hustle” quotes.

**6. Story & Reel Caption Generator**  
You describe the clip in plain language, and it gives you ready-to-post hooks, captions and CTAs tailored to your platform.

**7. Personal Brand Story Coach**  
Answer a few questions, and it helps you structure your story in a way that’s clear, memorable and relevant for your ideal audience.

**8–10. Visual fun & utility tools**  
– Turn yourself into a Pixar, Ghibli, GTA or action-figure style character.  
– Turn any photo into a bold cartoon portrait.  
– Remove unwanted objects/people from photos in seconds.

I bundled all of these into a small “AI for Growth” tool library so you don’t have to glue prompts together yourself. Each tool is built to do one job well and not waste your time.

I have been prepping for RCM Level 10 certification for piano, for which I have been studying the prerequisites like L8 theory and L9 harmony/history. I have been taking lessons for piano and classical singing. As for singing, I love all genres--classical arias, theatre/musical songs, jazz, pop as well. 

I just thought I'd love to make some friends with like-minded people. I'd love to jam with other singers/instrumentalists, be someone's accompanist, have someone be my accompanist for singing, etc. Or just be each other's encouragement by staying in touch and maybe linking up every now and then for a jam sesh, or just a nice talk over a cup of coffee.

It's always been my life motto to just don't give a fuck and do my own thing, yet through bad experiences, hurt, and rejection, I'm realising that my version of ""not giving a fuck"" is just masking a deep rooted fear and being this emotional stunted is preventing me from making real friends.

That being said, I just don't know if writing heartfelt thank you notes for my coworkers is the way to go. I have selected only a few that are close with me, as close as coworkers can be. Like our elderly office cleaner, who gives me motherly hugs and homemade freshly baked goodies from her home country. I asked her once why she's doing this for me and she said that I'm always kind with her when others are not. Or a senior dev, really positive guy, have not seen him in a bad mood ever. Yet he always sniffs when I am and takes like 10 minutes to just talk with me. Not drilling into my why's or what's, just random stuff and takes my mind off. Then comes around a few times during the day just to shoot some shit and be hilarious. Or a coworker one office over, who takes coffee or smoke breaks with me, talks with me about her husband and kid happenings, gives me decent advise, I would consider a friend. 

The first and foremost advice is always ""coworkers are not your friends"" and i am walking around the office with this beware! sign in my mind constantly. Yet these people seem genuine. Should I just ignore them this year again? Is just a small present without any pouring of the soul note card the real play here?

We met the summer going into our freshman year of high school. After meeting, we became really good friends right off the bat. We have been strictly friends up until a month ago. 

Starting August, we had begun to go out for coffee 2-3 times a week and talked for an hour or two with our drinks. We had gotten to know each other much better during our bi-weekly outings. Around a month and a half ago, he told me he thought I was beautiful. I know I'm not ugly, however, I am slightly insecure, I just don't like to display that to others. I took this comment as him trying to make me be more confident with my appearance. Around three weeks ago, we had to serve at a high-end event. The event ended around 10 PM at night, and we sat in my car and talked until midnight. This is when I realized I may have feelings for him. I thought he may have feelings for me as well, so I asked if we could plan to go watch a movie together and grab dinner. He agreed, so we had been planning for the past two weeks to do this. Tuesday before last, we had planned to go to the movies and grab some food. However, he had to cancel due to plans his family had. Instead we just grabbed some coffee.

I don't mind small dates, I was a little disappointed, but stuff happens. Then we planned another date with the same core events. However, after he had picked me up from my house we decided to go to a local restaurant due to him having family plans that night. I was slightly upset due to the unknown change in plans, however, I told myself again- stuff happens. Then today, we had planned to hang out today for these two weeks, and spend all day together. Last night, he texted me saying we needed to work on a project instead with our other teammate. I agreed, because I thought it might be a good idea to knock some work out. I was bummed, but decided I should get over it, as it is a project. 

This morning as the group project leader I checked if our group could even meet today, since the idea was sprung on me last night, to which we could not due to the other teammate. So now, we are meeting tomorrow. 

I was already ready, so I was a little excited this might mean that we could hang out today. I texted him and asked what the plans were now, to which he said he needed to help his family remove Christmas decorations and they wanted him to be at their dinner tonight. I said it was okay, but I am slightly agitated he keeps flaking on me.

I talked to my mom about it today, and she said he could only see me as a friend. Which is a possibility, however, he has told me recently he's liked me for the past four years and would deliberately become knowledgeable on my interests in order to have reasons to talk to me, so I don't think this is the case. 

I feel conflicted on how to bring up this issue to him. I'm not sure if he views me as a potential partner or girlfriend, or if he's decided if we are just friends. I thought since maybe he had spent all this time liking me, after talking to me as more than friends he has lost interest. Another possibility is that he treats me as something he can show off, having a girl who really likes him and does not typically get upset or something along those lines.

I am posting this to ask for advice for my situation, such as how to bring this up with him. ",2,1767391144.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

c) Level/align the burrs… is that something I need to do, and how?

I’m honestly a bit nervous to open it, I’ve heard there’s a spring in there and I don’t want to make things worse or making it unusable...

5) Seasoning + retention

I’ve never been able to hear speech in loud settings, like restaurants and coffee shops. Using a remote microphone helped, but in “stand up” settings like neighborhood gatherings, I couldn’t hear a damned thing because the microphone couldn’t be used in those scenarios.

I’m currently trying a single Phonak Audeo Sphere i90 in my working ear. (Phonak doesn’t make this aid in a BICROS design.) I’ve read lots of reviews describing how the Sphere aids work well in noisy environments. After just a few days‘ use, I agree with that — the Phonak allows me to hear much better in noisy places.

Now I need to address the issue of not receiving sound signals from my deaf side. Phonak makes a remote microphone that is reported to work very well, but it’s ridiculously expensive. I have a Google Pixel 9 phone that comes equipped with the Google Sound Amplifier app. That app seems like it could be helpful, but I can’t get it to work consistently. Since Phonak uses standard Bluetooth to connect to the phone, the hearing aid shows up as a headphone instead of a hearing aid using LE Bluetooth. My aid is connected to the phone, but the Sound Amplifier app will only broadcast sound to the aid about once every 20 tries. I’ve tried every disconnect/connect sequence that I can think of, but nothing works consistently.

I’ve posted a couple questions in different threads and didn’t get any replies, so I’m trying my luck with one clear post. I’d genuinely really appreciate the help and I’ll be forever grateful ❤️🙏

How can you tell which version a DF83 is? Is there an easy way to confirm it? Anything on the box, a sticker, serial number, markings on the grinder itself, etc.?

I bought one and the guy in the store doesn’t even know what I’m talking about…

2) De-clumper

What are the common complaints about the DF83 de-clumper? What should I look out for in real use?

3) Cleaning the chute + plasma generator

Can anyone share links to good videos showing how to clean the chute and the plasma generator?

4) Maintenance (regular + deep)

Can someone point me to a solid guide or video for what ongoing maintenance I should be doing?

a) Regular cleaning vs deeper cleaning, and how often

b) I keep seeing people say “zero it”, how do you actually do that?

c) Level/align the burrs… is that something I need to do, and how?

I’m honestly a bit nervous to open it, I’ve heard there’s a spring in there and I don’t want to make things worse or making it unusable...

5) Seasoning + retention

Do I need to “season” it by running some cheap beans through it?

Right now what comes out isn’t always what goes in, sometimes there are small and sometimes bigger differences. Does that improve with time?

For what it’s worth, my coffee already tastes like 10x better with this grinder, so I’m happy, I just want to make sure I’m using and maintaining it properly.

They said it may be related to a known issue with a clogged hose of some sort. They sent a replacement and the replacement after 2-3 weeks started draining water around the tray and inside the puck bin. The old unit never did that. Every time I’d pull out the tray there would be a puddle of coffee water on my counter. Are others having these frequent issues? I love the machine but I’m worried they don’t last or weren’t engineered appropriately.

IMDb Summary: A waitress desperate to fulfill her dreams as a restaurant owner is set on a journey to turn a frog prince back into a human, but she has to face the same problem after she kisses him.

Starring the voices of Anika Noni Rose, Bruno Campos, Michael-Leon Wooley, Jim Cummings, Jennifer Cody, John Goodman, Keith David, Peter Bartlett, Jenifer Lewis, Oprah Winfrey, and Terrence Howard. 

Zedd and I have only been to New Orleans one time but it was completely magical. It’s one of those places I would love to visit more, or perhaps once I win the lottery, buy a nice home in the Garden District. 

I would love to visit again at a minimum. While we were there, we went on a ghost tour. Set it up in advance. It tried to be a failure but I fought to get it done. It was just me, Zedd, and LMZ on a horse-drawn tour of the city. 

We also saw the cemeteries, got some beignets, and went to the art museum. We did not go in to the museum, instead we had a blast in the sculpture garden. 

We also went to the zoo and the aquarium, two places which were so much better than I expected. 

How does this all relate to this film? Of course it was based in NOLA and is an incredibly beautiful film. They are both magical, the city and the film! 

We regret not seeing this in the theatre, especially if we had been able to see it in 3D, those swamp scenes especially, with all the fireflies.

If you can’t take a trip to New Orleans yourself, I’d suggest popping this film in to your player and taking a little trip that way, it’s a \*\*\*Movie On\*\*\* style vacation! 

Just don’t forget the beignets and chicory coffee!  ",1,1767390515.0,500moviesorbust,0,1.0,False

1q2bp0y,https://www.reddit.com/r/mounjaroaustralia/comments/1q2bp0y/week_1_review/,Week 1 review,"I have just finished my first week and have lost 2.3kg without trying. This is after years of trying and failing to lose weight.

Side effects: Minimal. I had a mild headache on days 2 and 3 despite drinking lots of water but that faded by day 4. On day 6 my stomach was mildly upset, just a bit of wind pain. Oh, and burping. I am doing tiny burps more often, especially after drinking coffee.

Food noise: I am no longer craving snacks between meals. I used to get hungry at 10am, 3pm and 9:30pm, despite eating a well-balanced breakfast, lunch and dinner, and that's just gone. I'm not getting hungry, so I'm not eating snacks. Snacks were always my problem foods - biscuits, muesli bars etc - so that has eliminated a good amount of sugar and saturated fat.

Food enjoyment: I feel like my sense of taste is heightened. When I eat a bowl of salad I can taste each separate ingredient. And I am enjoying eating. It doesn't feel like a chore or something shameful.

Exercise: My usual strength training classes are on a break but I have been trying to do at least 30 minutes of planned exercise six days a week (which is slightly less than I normally do).

So far, so good.

The hardest aspect was taking the before photos as I have avoided taking photos of myself in swimwear for many, many years. ",4,1767390456.0,mounjaroaustralia,1,1.0,False

1q2bmjx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dizziness/comments/1q2bmjx/dizziness_when_speaking_on_video_calls_some_other/,Dizziness when speaking on video calls + some other random moments,"Hi all,

Over the past couple of months, I’ve had several episodes where I suddenly get really dizzy/lightheaded out of nowhere, and I can’t figure out what the common thread is.

A few weeks ago it happened during a new client kickoff (zoom) call while I was presenting and I suddenly felt very lightheaded and had to stop speaking, which was pretty embarrassing. Because I was worried about it happening again, for the following week I skipped coffee and ate more before my meetings but still felt lightheaded when speaking and had to turn my camera off. Larger (5+ people) video calls have been the main trigger recently, which is perhaps because I was unemployed most of the year and haven't had many until starting a new gig recently. But it’s also happened in a few totally different situations:

* During a recorded interview
* At breakfast with friends
* While eating spicy noodles
* When putting my head in the little chin rest contraption at the eye doctor during my exam

I don’t really feel like I have the leeway to keep “experimenting” and hoping it resolves on its own, especially now that it’s affecting my work but I have no clue? My labwork came back fine. My eye doctor said my eyes are fine. Sometimes I’ve had caffeine, sometimes not. Sometimes I’ve eaten recently, sometimes not. Sometimes it’s a high-pressure moment, other times it’s a totally normal time.

I keep wondering if it’s anxiety, blood sugar, eye strain, hormones, or something else but I can’t connect the dots, and now that it’s starting to affect my work, I’m getting worried.

My eye doctor suggested meclizine in the meantime, but I’m wondering whether something like propranolol or another anxiety-targeted medication has helped anyone in similar situations. I obviously know this is something to keep discussing with doctors, but as this subreddit knows, dizziness can be an annoyingly elusive symptom, so I wanted to see what others have had success with in similar scenarios.",1,1767390290.0,Dizziness,0,1.0,False

I gave the 'Worst Scores' section a little revamp this week. Instead of a table it's now a list since it's way easier to include extra details (Reddit tables are more limited than I thought). Now you’ll see each entry's past inspection scores + links, plus a median score from their history. It’s a quick way to see if this week’s score is a total fluke or just business as usual.

That's all for this week. Have a great start to your year! 🍻

These are all the places that scored a perfect 100 in their latest inspection. That's a real achievement. A 100 score shows a commitment to quality, keeping the establishment clean and sanitary, which is what we all want.

## Worst Scores

These are all the places that scored worse than 85. Similar to the previous Rotten Restaurant Report format, I don’t include scores between 85 and 99 since these are typically just minor misses in an inspection and likely not worth worrying about.

Recently, after I drink coffee, I get anxiety. I feel a pit in my stomach, I lose my appetite and I get worried. I used to drink coffee and nothing happened--now everytime I drink coffee, I get to 5/10 anxiety. Now, even when I drink something like green tea, I get mild anxiety.

Is this in my head? Why is this happening now when previously it didn't? I don't think I'm particularly stressed, definitely not more stressed than before, and before I didn't get anxiety from caffeine. Anyway to deal with this issue other than cutting out caffeine?

I don't drink caffeine everyday, and I am not addicted.",2,1767390109.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

With the weather turning, I've spent most of the last two months really in a cozy girlie/hibernate mode and, while I love it in some ways, I'm getting a bit antsy, and my step counts are faltering. 

With that in mind, I'm looking for ideas or quests that help me get out of my house/immediate neighborhood this winter. Ideally, I'd love to do something cozy, but just not-my-house cozy. 

For example, last year, I told myself I'd try a new coffee shop (for matcha) in a new neighborhood every weekend, which was pretty successful in getting me out and about while still being cozy and not terribly expensive. 

While I could continue the same thing, in the spirit of the New Year, I am looking for new ideas! Some thoughts I was considering: teahouses, bakeries, hotel lobbies, museums, libraries, pancakes, but would love to hear other suggestions or if anyone has done something similar successfully!

I was wondering if we already have a Facebook group (or something similar) where like minded people here can interact? I feel like a group could also add a layer of security for many of us since we don’t always know who we’re talking to on the other side online.

If there isn’t one, maybe we could create it?

A bit about me: I enjoy evening walks, trying new cafes for coffee, playing video games now and then, and I really enjoy deep, thought provoking conversations. I know a lot of us want to try new things and step out of our comfort zones, so maybe a group like this could help with that.

It could even be used to organize small, casual meetups for example, meeting in a park like Roma Street. We could bring food for each other to try. I am pretty sure many locals haven’t tried baklava, and I would be happy to bring that or other things I bake.

It could also be a group where we genuinely lift each other up and help each other grow in whatever capacity we can.

It might also be a good way to find people to do activities with, like playing tennis or other sports, going for walks or just hanging out.

Whether you're moving for work, uni, or just the lifestyle, the housing market in 2026 is fast-paced. Use this thread for any questions you have about housing in Glasgow, or anything you want changed in the sticky below.

# The 2026 Market Reality

* **Average Rent:** Expect to pay roughly **£1,100–£1,350 pcm** for a decent 2-bed tenement in popular areas.
* **Availability:** Demand remains high. Most flats are listed and let within **48–72 hours**. If you see a place you like, have your documents ready to go.
* **Buying:** The ""Offers Over"" system is standard. Properties often go for **10–15% above** the Home Report value.

# Neighbourhood Deep-Dive

Glasgow is a ""patchwork"" city where one street can feel entirely different from the next.

|Area|The Vibe|Pros|Cons|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|West End|Trendy, academic, leafy.|Best food/bars, Botanic Gardens, Subway.|Highest rents; studenty.|
|Southside|Artsy, family-friendly, hipster.|Queen's Park, good coffee, community feel.|Trains can be unreliable; very competitive.|
|Dennistoun|Up-and-coming since 1998.|Walkable to City Centre, cheaper than West/South.|Patchy street quality; one big park.|
|Finnieston|The Foodie Quarter.|Proximity to the Hydro/SEC and top-tier dining.|Can be very loud/busy.|
|Merchant City|Sleek, historic loft living.|Walkable to everything, high-end bars.|Pricey; noise from nightlife.|
|Partick|Gritty-meets-cool hub.|Amazing transport hub (Subway/Train/Bus).|Very busy; parking is almost impossible.|
|Hyndland|Refined, quiet, Old Money.|Beautiful flats, village atmosphere.|The Hyndland Premium (expensive).|
|Govan|Regenerated riverfront.|New bridge access to West End, great value.|Still transitioning; patchy amenities.|
|Bridgeton|Authentic East End.|Right next to Glasgow Green, lower prices.|Some streets still feel run-down.|
|Maryhill|Outdoorsy and mixed.|Scenic canal walks, affordable student options.|Further from Subway; varies street-by-street.|
|Suburbs|Bearsden, Giffnock, Newton Mearns.|Best schools, quiet, safe.|Requires a car; longer commute.|





# Understanding SIMD (The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation)

You will see people reference the **SIMD map** constantly.

* **What it is:** A government tool ranking areas from 1 (most deprived) to 10 (least deprived).
* **The Reality:** Use it as a **guide, not an oracle**. A ""Red"" zone (SIMD 1-2) might just be a street with lots of shops and few residents, which skews crime-per-capita stats.
* **Pro Tip:** Look for ""the overlap."" Areas where SIMD 3 meets SIMD 8 often offer the best value before gentrification fully takes hold.

# Avoiding Scams & Bad Landlords

2026 has seen a rise in ""Ghost Listings."" **Never pay a deposit before seeing a flat in person.**

1. **Landlord Registration:** Every private landlord *must* be registered. Check their 2-part number on the[Scottish Landlord Register](https://www.landlordregistrationscotland.gov.uk/).
2. **The 28-Day Rule:** In Scotland, there are **no fixed-term leases**. You can leave any time with 28 days' notice. If a landlord tries to lock you into a 12-month contract, they are breaking the law.
3. **Deposit Protection:** Your money *must* go to a third-party scheme (e.g., SafeDeposits Scotland). It is illegal for a landlord to hold it in their personal account.

# Transport & Logistics

* **The Subway:** Only covers a small loop of the West End, City Centre, and South. If you live outside this, you are at the mercy of **First Bus** or **ScotRail**.
* **Low-Level Trains:** Glasgow has the **largest suburban rail network in the UK outside London**.
* **Low Emission Zone (LEZ):** The City Centre is a strict LEZ. If your car is older (pre-2006 petrol/2015 diesel), you will be fined £60+ every time you drive into the center.
* **Council Tax:** Don't forget to factor this in! A Band C/D flat can add **£150–£200** to your monthly costs. Students are exempt but must apply for the discount.

# Top Tips from the Sub

* **""The Wallace St Rule"":** If you see a suspiciously cheap modern flat in Tradeston, search this sub for ""Wallace Street"" before signing. You've been warned.
* **Factor Fees:** If buying a tenement, check who the ""Factor"" (property manager) is. Some are notoriously expensive or unresponsive.
* **Viewing Kit:** Take a photo of the **Home Report** and check the ""Damp/Rot"" section (Category 3 is a red flag).",22,1767389556.0,glasgow,4,0.89,False

So to start off, the woman in question ""Q"" (30F)we'll call her, and I (29M), used to date a long time ago, years ago, when we were both still immature. Admittedly at the end of day I was the one who was immature mostly, and that is what caused the premature ending of that. 

Since we dated we have both been through a serious, long term, public relationship, with both of us leaving those relationships in the past due to our partners not being picture perfect, with my ex doing some light cheating during our relationship, and her ex just not being an example of a dateable person. Still we both lasted about a year in these relationships. 

Now I must preface, that when we did break up years ago, I took it very hard, and struggled quite a bit to get through that. Now, for work purposes I have moved abroad, and away from our home country, while she is still there for now (no plans on leaving as far as I know). I am going to be working in this foreign country for the next three years, including the start of 2025, so I will be heading back early-mid 2028.

Now here comes the emotional part of this post. I headed back to the home country to visit some friends and the little family I have left there, and decided to shoot her a message and go for a coffee, which Q agreed to, enthusiastically if I do say so myself, and so we did. Nothing happened, we talked for few hours, went over our recent  is me being optimistic. Now I am heading back to the foreign country, currently typing this on the flight, and I will not be heading back to the home country until the summer, when I will be there for a full three months (in 4 months, and 22 days to be exact).

 So my question is, do I pursue this in the summer, and hope that she hasn't found anyone, or wait until I am properly back? Personally I am infatuated and really want to text her before I am even back for summer, and just be super up front, start it up with something like ""tired of not talking, what are you up to"", I know I sound like one of those cringy tiktokers, but I really want to pursue this woman, she has a lot of what I am looking for currently, and I want to explore this in a serious manner.

With the help of some friends, I built the below itinerary for me, my partner and some of our close friends as we're going to Colombia on a holiday around the time of my 30th birthday.

Getting to Bogota, Medellin, Ciudad Perdida hike and Cartagena are a must i think - but we want to get into nature/culture/coffee region + maybe visit the Casa en el Agua hostel as well as a friend from there went and said we'd love it.

Any parts you'd avoid or recommend skipping/replacing? Bogotá is a must for the start/end because of flights or else direct from Cartagena on the way home maybe if possible! Is Cartagena fun for a birthday night out or better to be somewhere else like Medellín or Palomino? Is it way too busy what's worth cutting?

I put in Palomino and Tayrona National Park as one section. No idea which to do

We're planning it all on a budget so it'd be backpacking hostels etc

She began to get weird, but it was small things, like a back handed comments here and there, or not taking my side sometimes when it came to defending me. 

I wasn’t phased really, I’ve had this happen before, and I just assumed its average girl cattiness, nothing more nothing less. Now don’t get me wrong, I KNEW these were red flags but I gave her the benefit of the doubt since we weren’t that close yet. 

We hangout plenty of times during the summer, it was fun! Other than what I had mentioned before, and she was objectively a good friend. 

NOW here comes my first semester of sophomore year. 

Everything is fine and good, were going out on the weekends like normal college students, and boundaries are respected. But, here’s where it gets weird. She starts picking up the guys who hit on me at parties. At first, this is fine, I’m not one to be made over men they’re essentially fly over my head at this point in my life, and I do get a fair amount. 

But then, she keeps making it known, I fucked him or I'm snapping him and mind you, I don’t ask, but I listen because I'm her friend and friends have interest in each others lives. 

 Here comes October. I get close with a group of guys in my apartment, it was by accident since I left my keys in their bathroom after going to a party of theirs. I get close with this one in particularly, let name him Jake.

Jake and I are pretty obvious that were getting close, romantically, or lets call it a ""situationship” I liked him, but I wasn’t interested in dating at this point in college, I’m trying to focus on my goals and career and I’ve dated a lot in the past. 

Sarah lies to him, that I left her party to fuck some a guy I met that night apparently. He gets PISSED. I don’t know why she said that or what context that would have come up in, his friend calls me entitled for not having the 9 dollar change for something he bought both me and my friend the other day. SHE FUCKS HIM TOO, and starts dating him for a solid week, after I told her what happened. (Mind you, I told him calmly I will give him the 9 dollars back once I get back to my apartment.) 

Now, I this is when I was getting weirded it out. I told her was talking to this guy in our hometown, she gets his number and starts sexting him. At the end of semester, I recently crashed into someone ON ACCIDENT BTW in my parking garage, he told me to come to discuss the insurance that night later on and I brought her with me. Shortly after I left, SHE FUCKS HIM TOO. 

Am I the problem? I don’t get what she’s trying to prove, maybe its validation? Or just jealousy?

I haven’t talked to her in 2 weeks and have been ignoring her messages and calls, Im not sure how to confront this.

At 4 a.m., while Bai Shikun slept soundly beside her, Wang Rong sat up in bed, slipped on her robe, tiptoed out of the bedroom, quietly closed the door, went downstairs, and sat on the leather sofa in the spacious living room—Bai Shikun’s usual seat.

In front of the sofa was an entire wall of floor-to-ceiling glass windows. This villa was perched near the mountain peak, so during the day, sitting here you could see the rolling mountains outside. But Wang Rong never had the chance to enjoy the view—she always came here at night.

At night, the mountains were pitch-black, but if you looked far enough, you could see the dazzling city lights beyond the mountains—like a sparkling jewel pinned to the edge of the dark sky. This view was not visible during the day.

The nightscape was the only thing Wang Rong liked about the villa. She found the decor overly gray and cold, with not a single extra ornament—not even a painting on the wall—as if the owner wanted to leave no trace here.

This thought made Wang Rong uncomfortable.

Every time Bai Shikun fell asleep, she would quietly come downstairs, sit here, and gaze at the night, thinking about her future plans. But tonight, for some reason, memories from the past kept surfacing in her mind.

Suddenly, Wang Rong frowned and shifted her waist, wanting to change her sitting position to ease the sore, awkward spot on her body.

Her relationship with Bai Shikun had lasted for two years.

Two years ago, Wang Rong met Bai Shikun at a business social event. Of course, she knew who he was: a man worth tens of billions, and, according to the newspapers, a paragon with no hint of scandal.

At least, that’s what the media said.

So when he openly expressed his admiration for her, she was instantly conquered. At the time, Wang Rong had just taken up the presidency of the Society of the Virgin Mary and was at the height of her fame.

“You are unique. There are many beautiful women in the world, but I have never met one as beautiful and capable as you.” That was Bai Shikun’s compliment to her. Every time Wang Rong recalled these words, her vanity was stroked—after all, this was praise from a super-wealthy man.

But she knew it wasn’t enough. To truly win his heart, she had to make herself even more valuable.

Wang Rong knew the Bai family’s business empire included real estate and land development. She also knew Bai Shikun was planning a major redevelopment in the slum district where the Society’s primary school—her own childhood home—stood, to build a new middle-class community combining commercial, cultural, and residential use.

The Society’s complex, including the school, nuns’ dormitory, community hospital, and clinic, sat at the heart of these plans.

With a century of history and deep community ties, the Society’s buildings would not be easy to remove.

So Wang Rong took the initiative to tell Bai Shikun she could clear this obstacle for him.

And she succeeded.

Of course, besides fundraising and government support, most of the land purchase and new school construction funds came from Bai family enterprises.

This was only the first step. Soon, under her leadership, the nuns’ dormitory, hospital, and clinic would also be relocated and rebuilt.

Outside, the villa was enveloped in darkness—no stars, no moon, only a distant patch of lights glowing red at the horizon.

For some reason, tonight she found herself missing Xing Jun. She hadn’t thought of him for a long, long time.

Her affair with Xing Jun had only lasted a little over a year. When she was a trainee at the law firm, she learned that Xing Jun was a VIP client—also a charming, well-known figure in the financial world.

On her 35th birthday, the boss and colleagues threw her a party, and Xing Jun unexpectedly showed up.

She couldn’t recall exactly how their affair began, only that he brought her a kind of delight and intoxication she’d never felt as a woman.

Xing Jun was handsome, elegant, witty, always making her laugh—and most of all, he knew how to flatter her.

After marrying Fang Ming in her youth, Wang Rong had to bear the responsibilities of being a wife and mother.

Fang Ming treated her well, but was strict and controlling, and after marriage, all sweet talk disappeared—her biggest complaint about him. Perhaps it was because he treated her so seriously as a wife that he became so dull.

But Xing Jun treated her like a princess—even a queen.

That was the difference.

With Xing Jun, Wang Rong felt young and girlish again.

Fang Ming had been the husband of her childhood dreams, but Xing Jun was the perfect lover—beyond her imagination.

She knew there would never be a real future with Xing Jun, and she didn’t want one. They both had families; they just wanted a romantic, fleeting affair.

But her feelings for Bai Shikun were different.

She saw a report in a magazine about Bai Shikun’s golden wedding anniversary—his wife, now wheelchair-bound and heavily made-up, unable to hide her frail spirit.

Wang Rong knew that Mrs. Bai had been ill for ten years, dependent on medicine and technology.

So Wang Rong revived a childhood habit.

The newly built Society of the Virgin Mary Primary School included a chapel—small, but in a beautiful classical Western style.

The Virgin Mary statue, once in a playground corner, now stood inside the chapel.

Though busy, Wang Rong made time every night she was in the city to visit the chapel, offer fresh flowers, and pray by candlelight, asking the Virgin’s blessing—that she might soon become the next Mrs. Bai.

Wang Rong was certain the Virgin would grant her wish, just as she’d once sent her Fang Ming.

This day, Fang Ming behaved unusually: instead of having afternoon tea alone at a café, he had lunch with a young man.

Fang Ming sat across from the young man, unable to stop studying his features, barely able to contain his agitation and disbelief.

The young man, on the other hand, showed no discomfort, carrying himself with poise and warmth.

He even… had the same temperament.

Fang Ming was shocked.

The day before, on his way home, a tall, handsome young man had approached and politely asked, “Excuse me, are you Mr. Fang Ming?”

At first sight, Fang Ming was stunned—the youth looked almost exactly like her, Xia Yu.

“Hello, my name is Xia Lixian. I’m Xia Yu’s son,” the young man said gently, resolving Fang Ming’s confusion.

At the café, Xia Lixian took out his phone and showed Fang Ming a photo of two teenagers, about sixteen or seventeen, sitting on campus grass, laughing happily.

One was Xia Lixian, the other—his own son, Fang Zheng.

After looking at the photo, Fang Ming gazed blankly at Xia Lixian.

“That year, Fang Zheng had just arrived in San Francisco from this small city and entered the same university as me. We were assigned as roommates, even though we were in different departments,” Xia Lixian explained.

Father and son, separated by continents, but keeping close contact. Fang Ming knew his son had made a good friend upon arriving in the U.S.—a local Chinese boy who’d helped him with both studies and life, and with whom he was lucky enough to share a dorm.

But Fang Ming never imagined that this friend was Xia Yu’s son, Xia Lixian.

“Mr. Fang, do you believe in fate?” Xia Lixian asked, his eyes radiating a maturity beyond his years.

“So… why did you come to see me?” Fang Ming asked, conflicted.

“My mother sent me. She wanted me to tell you the truth she knows. She said maybe it’s fate,” Xia Lixian replied.

“You want me to break up with Ming? Impossible!” Xia Yu said calmly but firmly to the beautiful young woman before her.

She was angry. Though gentle by nature, even she had limits—especially at Wang Rong’s outrageous demand.

Of course, she knew about Fang Ming’s affair with Wang Rong. Long before this, her intuition had told her Fang Ming’s heart was straying.

“Miss Wang, we’ve been together for twenty years—longer than you’ve been alive. I won’t leave him, and neither will he,” Xia Yu said, her tone calm but resolute.

“That’s exactly why you should leave. You’ve made enough over the years, haven’t you?” Wang Rong sneered, her voice softer than Xia Yu’s but her words sharp as knives.

“If he really loved you, why wouldn’t he marry you after twenty years?”

“You—!”

Xia Yu couldn’t bear it. Shaking, eyes red, she almost slapped Wang Rong, but restrained herself.

Why didn’t Fang Ming marry her?

She knew the unspoken reason—that painful spot in her soul, her fatal weakness. Worst of all, Wang Rong seemed to see right through it.

Wang Rong looked Xia Yu in the eye and sighed.  
“Miss Xia, maybe you should believe that all this is God’s arrangement!” she said, her gaze even tinged with pity.

Xia Yu laughed coldly. “God arranged for you to be Fang Ming’s wife? We’ll see. I’m not leaving. If your God is so powerful, have him get rid of me.” She turned to go, unwilling to face this frightening girl any longer.

“We’ll see indeed. If you refuse to leave Ming within a month, the whole city’s media will dig up all the gossip about Fang Ming’s girlfriend Xia Yu working in sleazy bars,” Wang Rong said, her voice cold and lips curved in a cruel smile.

Xia Yu spun around, eyes wide in shock, staring at Wang Rong.

Wang Rong’s lips curled, her next words uglier still: “And… she even posed for filthy nude photos and adult films to make a bit of money…”

“Shut up!” Xia Yu screamed.

She had never, in her life, screamed so shrilly.

Both Xia Yu and Fang Ming had grown up in the slums, neighbors in the same building.

In that environment, hardship and temptation had led Xia Yu astray in her youth.

So Wang Rong’s first accusation was true.

But she hadn’t stayed long in that world; soon, Fang Ming had come to her and said, “Stop. From now on, I’ll take care of you.” He’d spoken calmly, not even meeting her eyes, but Xia Yu felt the weight of his words.

For the next twenty years, through danger and fortune, except for marriage, Fang Ming had kept his promise.

So Wang Rong’s second accusation was baseless.

So Xia Yu laughed bitterly. “I never did those things. What evidence do you have? Are you going to fake it?”

“I don’t care if you did or not, and neither does anyone else,” Wang Rong replied coolly. “Truth doesn’t matter. What matters is: people would love to see the successful businessman’s woman exposed as filthy and fallen.”

And the media would oblige, turning the public’s desires into “fact.” You can protest, but no one cares about the truth. The only certainty is that Ming’s reputation will be ruined.

That’s how people are: they idolize successful men, then crave to see them fall; they praise pure women, then want to see them dragged through the mud.

Wang Rong spoke calmly, but her eyes glinted with something that chilled Xia Yu.

Xia Yu was stunned by the malice in someone seventeen years her junior.

“And you know, I have plenty of friends in the media. If I want to ruin you, I absolutely can.” Wang Rong seemed to declare victory.

Xia Yu wasn’t afraid for herself, but she couldn’t bear to see Fang Ming’s reputation destroyed.

Seeing Xia Yu trembling, Wang Rong’s tone softened. “Miss Xia, I know you love Ming as much as I do. I’m leaving now—think it over.”

After Wang Rong left, Xia Yu finally let her tears fall.

She laughed—a sad, desperate laugh.

Wang Rong, you’re wrong. I love him so much more than you ever could…

In the café, Fang Ming listened quietly to the story. Most of the time, he stared at his cup of coffee, untouched and long cold.

Neither man touched their lunch.

“When she met my mother, she didn’t say she was pregnant—she wouldn’t show weakness to her rival. Only when you asked to break up did my mother learn Wang Rong was carrying your child,” Xia Lixian said, sipping cold coffee.

“If she’d simply told my mother she was pregnant, my mother’s nature would have made her leave anyway.”

Guilt choked Fang Ming, leaving him speechless.

He’d never imagined Xia Yu had suffered such bullying.

He’d never realized how ruthless Wang Rong had been, even as a girl. It seemed he’d never truly seen what kind of woman Wang Rong was.

The sense of defeat was worse than the failure of his marriage or career.

At least now, he understood why Xia Yu had that look of realization when he told her Wang Rong was pregnant.

“She… your mother sent you to tell me all of this?” Fang Ming finally managed to ask.

Xia Lixian smiled kindly, his gentle gaze making Fang Ming feel as if he were seeing an old friend.

“You know Zheng and I are friends. One day I invited him home, and as soon as my mother saw him, she froze—she knew right away he was your son.”

As a boy, Fang Zheng had resembled Wang Rong, but as he grew, he looked more and more like Fang Ming. Now, he was a younger version of his father.

Fang Ming was proud of his dutiful son; this was why he’d compromised, hoping to give his boy a complete family.

“My mother only told me these things recently, after much thought. She’d assumed you’d gone your separate ways, never to cross paths again.

But then, your son came to San Francisco, attended the same university as me, became my roommate, and my friend.

She thought this must be fate: that Heaven wanted her to tell you the truth. That’s why she sent me.”

Fang Ming was silent for a long time, then took a deep breath.

“So…”

He looked at Xia Lixian, forcing out two words.

He seemed to realize what the “truth” was.

Suddenly, unable to hold back anymore, he blurted out, “You’re my child?”

Xia Lixian looked at the weary, weathered man before him, his eyes brimming with tears. “My mother only realized in San Francisco that she was pregnant with your child.”

The handsome young man took a deep breath and continued, “My mother loved me deeply, but never spoke of my father. I never asked—I didn’t want to make her sad. If she wanted to tell, she would.”

He paused, then looked at Fang Ming. “Yes, I am your son. Zheng is my older brother; he was born a month before me.”

Xia Lixian seemed to have inherited his mother’s temperament—calm even in emotional moments. So when he said, “I am your son,” his tone was gentle, but his eyes shone with tears.

This was a cozy, literary café.

At that moment, the summer evening breeze drifted in through the dark green window, brushing past the long-separated father and son.

At night, Fang Ming couldn’t sleep. He got up, went to the living room, watched TV, and drank whisky.

Suddenly, he heard a strange noise from the bedroom—a heavy object falling.

Fang Ming was instantly alert. Was a thief climbing in the window? But this was the top floor—what kind of cat burglar would be so bold?

He quietly picked up an iron rod and crept toward the bedroom. Suddenly, he heard men’s and women’s voices arguing inside.

Impossible, he thought.

Could there be a female thief too?

The door was ajar; he peered inside and saw a man and a woman.

The woman stood by the window; the man was outside.

Outside was a drop of twenty floors.

The man was terrified, voice trembling and almost crying. “Rong… don’t… don’t be crazy! This won’t work! Let me in!”

The woman stood guard, blocking his return. “Why are you so useless? Isn’t there a beam? Is it that hard to climb over?”

The man really did cry, but kept his voice down so as not to alert neighbors—he had a reputation to protect. “You crazy woman! You think I’m some acrobat? I can’t make it! Just let him catch us, so what!”

The woman’s voice dripped with venom.

“Of course it doesn’t matter to you! Your wife doesn’t care if you have an affair. You say sorry and you’re a good husband, a good father.

But Ming will never forgive me. He wants to catch us red-handed so he can divorce me, with just cause!”

She laughed bitterly. “Then I’ll lose my family, my child—everyone will laugh at me. And you! You’ll lose nothing!”

The man dropped all pretense of being a gentleman. “You blame me? This was mutual! If you were so afraid of divorce, you should have been a good wife! Why have an affair?” He ignored her and tried to climb back inside, but he was no longer young and struggled.

The woman rushed to the bedside, grabbed a bronze statue—a two-foot-long rod-like sculpture.

She gripped it and lunged back to the window, jabbing the man in the chest.

It wasn’t a hard blow, but he hadn’t expected it—startled, his sweat-soaked hands slipped, he lost his balance, and fell.

Breathing hard, she calmed herself, placed the statue on the bed, wiped it with the quilt, wrapped it in a towel from the wardrobe, and put it back in place.

Fang Ming finally saw what it was: an abstract bronze sculpture of two nude figures entwined, so close they looked like a single rod.

He remembered—on the night he’d caught them at Wai Cheung Garden, when Wang Rong opened the door and he burst into the bedroom, the sculpture was on the bedside. He’d been furious just seeing it. “You… you wretch!”

He was shocked at himself for cursing his wife—something he’d never imagined he could do. At the time, the sculpture felt like a red-hot knife in his heart.

He’d never noticed the man he’d expected to find was already lying in a pool of blood below.

Fang Ming woke from his dream.

This time, he wasn’t startled—he didn’t feel afraid in the dream.

As he watched the scene from the doorway, it felt like a movie.

He got out of bed and took a cold shower.

The coolness washed over him, body and soul.

He didn’t care whether the dream was true or false.

He thought of Xia Yu, and of his other son, Xia Lixian.

At that moment, Fang Ming had made his decision.

He’s turning 4 months in a few days, and sleep has been absolute chaos since around 2.5 months. Before that, he was sleeping 7–8 hour stretches in his crib without waking. Now we’re lucky if we get 3 hours.

I’ve basically given up on sleeping in my own room because I was running back and forth every 10 minutes, so I now sleep on a mattress on the floor of his room. We end up co-sleeping most nights. The bassinet is a no-go because he moves so much that he rotates and gets stuck sideways. The crib is suddenly rejected too. Even when we co-sleep, he moves constantly and seems uncomfortable, so I barely sleep and i feel like he doesnt get the best sleep either. We're stuck between ihe needs his space to sleep and move but he wants me close (i'm talking nose to nose, thats how he calms down when we co sleep and he starts to wiggle)

I exclusively breastfeed and he eats 2–3 times a night. Lately (no idea if it’s the holidays or what), sleep went from chaotic to basically nonexistent. At night he only wants to sleep in our arms. All naps are contact naps too, which honestly doesn’t bother me as much — it’s the nights that are killing me. On top of that, I think he might be teething 🥲

Otherwise a super happy, chill baby. He doesn’t cry much. He went from falling asleep easily and doing long stretches to… this. I’m surviving on coffee at this point.

I need help, tips, reassurance, literally anything. Did anyone else go through this? I thought maybe he hit the 4-month sleep regression early since everything started around 2.5 months, around the same time he started rolling, but it’s been almost 2 months of nonstop chaos and I don’t even know anymore.
I’m even considering sleep training (Ferber or fading), but I’m so stressed about letting him cry and worried I’ll cave because I can’t handle him being upset, can anyone tell me if sleep trainjng was or wasn't succesful with their velcro baby? And how long did it take?

The goal is to automate it and add ""Grind-by-Weight"" functionality using a load cell and 4 buttons to trigger certain states (i am not worried about the coding....yet)

My plan is hooking into the grinder's existing interface, which provides 5V, GND, and a Relay Trigger pin. I'm using an ESP32-C3 SuperMini to control everything, read a load cell via an HX711, and manage user input through 4 buttons.

My main questions:

The Relay Driver: Since the grinder expects a signal to trigger its internal relay (or the board acts as the relay switch), I implemented a transistor circuit using a BC337. I am specifically concerned about the Flyback Diode placement. Does the schematic look correct for protecting the transistor from inductive kickback?

ESP32 Antenna: I tried to keep the area under the ESP32 antenna free of copper (both top and bottom layers) to avoid interference. Did I use the keep-out zones correctly in KiCad?

Both Minnesota and Anaheim have cashed the Over in their last 3 straight games. With the Ducks having allowed at least 4 goals in their last 3 outings, I think it’d be tough for this encounter to be a low-scoring one. While I do think the Wild bags a win here, watching the SJ Sharks get 4 goals past them just a few days ago makes me think Anaheim will do at least that. I’m on the Over to hit here, friends

1q2ay6i,https://i.redd.it/433hjksu50bg1.png,FolderCrafter - A simple Folder Structure creator that I needed desperately and vibe coded in a couple of hours,"I'm a freelance video editor doing 5-7 jobs per month. I always start with similar folder structures when working on a project, if it's a video near 15 folders, if it's a film then 20. Yesterday I needed to create 3 different project folders and collaborate with a teammate and then I thought, why not build a simple software for this in Antigravity?

So I googled a bit and found some python scripts that can do this job, found a couple of libraries for GUI (Tried flet first but couldn't manage to make it work so decided to tell Opus to use customtkinter) and told which features I want and how I want it to look. After a couple of hours, boom. What a great time!

And I made FolderCrafter. It's not only generating folder structures, you can also create folder structure templates, export them as json and send teammates/friends and import jsons. Who knows maybe some they there will be folder structure libraries for this app :)

1q2axnh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q2axnh,"""wet"" Chocolate filling for DIY wedding cake","Hello! I will be making the wedding cake(s) for my friend in July of this year and I've been recipe testing for a while already and have things pretty well narrowed down. The bride (and groom!) is very reasonable and has no idea I've been struggling so hard with the last remaining cake flavor, so if I tell her this is an impossible task, I am certain she will let me veto it and suggest a better option. With all that said, here is my situation: I am making 5 total 10"" cakes (one is carrot cake, we can ignore that one since it doesn't fit in with the rest). I've added some photos of test bakes over the last year or so, just for fun, I guess. 

The other four will use the same vanilla cake recipe that I've perfected. I like to slice my layers pretty thin (about 3/4""), so I needed something that is strong enough to hold up to 9ish layers of cake without getting squished. I also needed the right balance of oil/butter so that I could avoid needing a soak since three of the cakes are straight up fruit flavors that will have compote and curd fillings, which inherently moisten the cake. I've done a lot of test freezes and thaws... 

Anyway, the last remaining cake flavor request was chocolate/orange/coffee (um, gross?). The three together was immediately vetoed by me, but I agreed to give it a try if I could make a chocolate filling work with the vanilla cake. 

So I need a flavor profile that is either chocolate/orange or chocolate/coffee and accomplished via filling alone (since the cake will be vanilla). Another inconvenient part of this puzzle is that the frosting needs to match the other four cakes, which means white (cream cheese buttercream). 

So far I've tried a fudge filling with orange zest and chocolate ganache with orange zest (obviously leaning into the orange side of things). Neither of these were as good as the other cakes and the cake stayed slightly too dry. My next thoughts are perhaps a diplomat cream or pastry cream. Maybe French buttercream? I don't think these will be ""wet"" enough either though, since what I'm looking for is for the filling to actually soak into the layers a little. I also don't think the diplomat cream will be strong enough to support the layers. I'm starting to think what I want doesn't actually exist, so before I give up, I'm coming to you! 

Just for context, the other cakes/desserts are below. If a different buttercream is listed, they will still be coated on the outside with a uniform white cream cheese buttercream.

1. Lemon curd/blueberry jam (vanilla cake)
2. Lime curd/blackberry jam (vanilla cake)
3. Strawberry honey jam/honey buttercream (vanilla cake)
4. (??) Chocolate/coffee or chocolate/orange (vanilla cake) (??)
5. Carrot cake, filled with brown butter cream cheese buttercream (a la Claire Saffitz)

I'll also be making a cocktail inspired macaron, current contender: chocolate shells, toasted marshmallow brown butter Swiss meringue buttercream, cherry bitters jam filling. 

Please help me with cake number 4 before I give up and suggest another random fruit flavor and force the bride and groom to give up on their idea of having chocolate flavor in one of their cakes! I'm already maxed out for the logistics part of this and can't really afford the time it will take to test and develop another base cake that I can trust to freeze and thaw and travel. I do have a day job 🙃

... chocolate jam? I don't think that's a thing. Chocolate curd? Pretty sure that takes me full circle back to pastry cream. Save me please. ",12,1767388702.0,Baking,14,0.93,False

We texted all day everyday for a week leading up to our first date. Two days into texting her created a shared note of all the things we could do together such as trips, camping, etc. Then come our first date, it started with two hours of coffee which I thought would end there. He ended up saying “I don’t want to stop seeing you” and it turned into a 6+ hour date on a Monday. Two days later on a Wednesday he asked if I would go to a concert with him to a band I’ve never heard of. We live about 50 miles apart from one another so I drove almost 2 hours in traffic to his place, then to the concert, back to his place to sleep about 4 hours of to then drive to work early which took about one and a half hours. Three days later he came to my place and slept over. So that was the first week of marathon dates. At this time, we both agreed we wanted to find something long term and monogamous. He also told me he deleted his hinge, so I did the same.

The next few weeks we have seen one another at least twice a week, all involving sleepovers. This last week with Christmas, we spent three straight days together. I hesitated getting him a gift so I just got him a bag of coffee but he ended up gifting me new trekking poles, a running vest, running water bottles, and a bunch of goos and electrolytes. For context, he is an ultra runner and encouraged me to sign up for a half marathon about a week and a half into us dating which he is helping me training for now. Around this time, he talked about having a race in Morocco he wants to do in 2027 and that I should come along. Additionally, he suggested that we hangout with two of my best friends during New Year’s so he could meet them, but this did not end up happening as a result of scheduling conflicts.

Overall, all of this has happened in about a month. One week of talking before our first date. Now into exactly one month of dating. He’s very sweet and respectful and I think things are going well but will admit they are moving very fast and it’s intense. One thing that does bother me a little is that he always talks about his ex’s.

What I didn’t expect was to feel like I slowly stopped being a friend and started being a backup plan.


I’m a stay at home mom, and early on I agreed to help her out with babysitting occasionally when she needed it. She never offered to pay, which I didn’t mind at first because we were close and I genuinely wanted to help. We were never explicit about payment, but the understanding was that this would be short term help between friends; not full day childcare.


Over time, the babysitting became more frequent and lasted much longer than what was originally discussed. She would often say she’d be gone for “a few hours,” but there were multiple times where she didn’t come back for 12+ hours. At that point, it wasn’t just helping out; it was rearranging meals, routines, bedtime, and plans for my own kids with no notice. Another child is another mouth to feed, and it started to feel like my time was being taken for granted.


On top of that, most of the time she contacted me, it was to ask for babysitting or another favor. When I asked for small favors myself, the answer was almost always that she was too busy, or she’d say she’d get back to me and never did.


I also tried to maintain the friendship outside of favors. I suggested coffee, playdates, or just spending time together, and she never seemed to have time for that. Yet she always seemed to have time when she needed to go on dates and concerts with other friends. That’s when it really started to hurt.


I kept saying yes longer than I should have because of our history and because I didn’t want to lose the friendship we used to have. But eventually, I finally realized that I felt anxious and resentful every time she reached out, because I already knew what she was going to ask for.


When I finally stopped babysitting and pulled back, she noticed and asked what was wrong. I explained how I felt. She got upset and told me I was being unfair because I “have more free time” since I am a stay at home mom, which made me feel like she didn’t value my time at all.


Now I feel guilty, sad, and frustrated. I miss the person she used to be, but I don’t miss feeling used. I know motherhood changes friendships, but this didn’t feel like a natural drift; it felt one sided.

1q2ascb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q2ascb,Hario Switch Can’t Get a Flat Bed,"Just got a Hario Switch (size 03) and it is my new favorite brewer! I see it as a simpler version of the Aeropress, while still having the joy of making a pour over.

The issue I’m running into is I have inconsistency with the coffee bed. Sometimes it’s flat with a ring at the top, sometimes there are multiple rings, and sometimes it’s just a mess lol. 

First off, I want to know if this is a brewer where I should expect a flat bed since it’s an immersion brewer. Secondly, if a flat bed is achievable and expected, would the issue be the lack of uniformity in my grind?  

I have a Baratza Encore that I’ve had for about three years. I love it and it is very sentimental, but I do notice the variation in grind size. As you can see in the photos, it’s the larger pieces that tend to be stuck around the top.  The coffee usually tastes great, as I stick with a specific recipe and adjust my grind size and water temperature based on brewing method and roast level. It just really bothers me that I’m not getting a flat bed lol. 

I do a two minute steep and I stir the crust with a spoon at about one minute. Any thoughts on stirring are welcome as I’m not sure if that has anything to do with it.  I have also tried swirling during the drawdown which tends to help sometimes.  But, I’m new to this Brewer and I’m just looking for anyone with experience to offer me some guidance.

Thanks!

It just started randomly on night when I was trying to eat dinner. I just brushed it off as me being extremely stressed as I had a really long day at work. So I just thought that I will just sleep it off and I will be fine.

Next day rolls around I skip breakfast because I was running late for work, but I did manage to get some coffee, as the bus was quicker than usual. I drink it fine, by the time it’s lunch I have completely forgotten about last night. So I buy a big sandwich.

It was a struggle for me to swallow it and once I did it was just stuck in my throat. It was absolutely terrifying and I was too scared to eat anything else.

From that day onwards I have been strictly on a liquid/puree diet. And even at times that is difficult for me to swallow. I went to my GP and they at first prescribed me with amoxicillin and numbing throat spray. They thought I might have inflammation in my pharynx as  the back of my throat was red.

I finished the whole course and my problem didn’t dissipated. In order to find out the cause of my dysphagia. I have so far done blood tests, a nasal endoscopy and a gastroscopy. So far nothing life threatening thankfully. And I will be doing an MRI soon. 

I appreciate how serious they are taking this as I am quite young and every single medical professional I have been seen by is completely baffled as to why someone as healthy as me is going through this.

I am currently on lansoprazole and fexofenadine. As they did find that my voice box is damaged by acid reflux and my adenoids are swollen. I don’t always take the fexofenadine as it is a pill (I tried to protest for a more easier way for me take). Thankfully the lansoprazole I take dissolves in my mouth (btw I had to demand for that one as well).

The reason for this post is the mental toll it has taken on me. I can’t eat anything I like, food was literally one of the greatest joys of my life. Now each time I have to eat I am dreading it, I have to think of every single bite I take. Because one delayed swallow and I am choking. 

I also can’t even eat anything that is even nutritious for my body, and I am already started to lose weight. Which isn’t what I need since I am already skinny.

I feel a constant tightness in my throat, and sometimes I am also dehydrated because there are times I struggle to drink water. And I just have to put up a brave front for everyone. I have to pretend that I am not slowly withering away. It is horrible.

And to see that there are people, who have been dealing with this for years, makes me feel hopeless that I will never get back to normal.

1q2aqjd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttractionDynamics/comments/1q2aqjd/how_to_tell_if_shes_attracted_the_psychology/,How to Tell if She's ATTRACTED: The Psychology Behind 10 Signs That Actually Work,"You know that feeling when you're talking to someone and you can't tell if they're into you or just being polite? Yeah, that confusion is universal. I've spent way too much time digging through psychology research, dating podcasts, and behavioral science books trying to crack this code. Not because I'm some smooth operator, but because reading people accurately is a legit life skill that nobody teaches you.

Here's what I found: Most advice about attraction is either overly simplified garbage or wrapped in so much pseudoscience it's useless. But there ARE real psychological patterns backed by research that signal genuine interest. I pulled this from sources like Matthew Hussey's work, behavioral psychology studies, and evolutionary biology research. This isn't about playing games or manipulation. It's about understanding human behavior so you can stop second-guessing everything.

The truth is, our brains are wired to send and receive attraction signals subconsciously. Society and media have made us overthink every interaction to the point where we miss what's right in front of us. But once you understand these patterns, things get clearer. So let's break down what actually matters.

## Step 1: Watch the Eye Contact Game

Real attraction shows up in how someone looks at you. Not just that they make eye contact, but HOW they do it.

**The research**: Studies in social psychology show that prolonged eye contact (3+ seconds) triggers the release of phenylethylamine, the same chemical associated with attraction. If she holds your gaze longer than socially necessary, especially during conversation pauses, that's your first sign.

But here's the kicker: Look for the **triangle gaze**. This is when someone's eyes move from your eyes to your mouth and back. It's subconscious and happens when someone is genuinely attracted. Dr. Monica Moore's research on nonverbal courtship behaviors found this pattern consistently appears in attraction scenarios.

Also watch for **pupil dilation**. Yeah, it sounds technical, but you can actually notice this. When someone's attracted, their pupils literally get bigger. It's an autonomic response you can't fake.

## Step 2: She Mirrors Your Movement

Mirroring is one of the most reliable indicators of interest, and it's backed by solid neuroscience. When someone likes you, they unconsciously copy your body language, gestures, speech patterns, even your energy level.

**The science behind it**: Mirror neurons in our brain fire when we observe actions in others, but they activate MORE intensely when we're attracted to someone. It's your brain's way of building rapport and connection.

Pay attention if she:
* Leans in when you lean in
* Crosses her legs in the same direction as you
* Picks up her drink right after you do
* Matches your speaking pace or adopts phrases you use

This isn't conscious. People don't sit there thinking ""let me mirror this person."" It happens automatically when there's genuine interest. The book **""The Like Switch"" by Jack Schafer** (former FBI agent who literally studied human behavior for national security) breaks down mirroring as one of the most reliable friendship and attraction signals.

## Step 3: The Proximity Test

Attraction makes people want to be physically closer. Simple as that.

If she consistently positions herself near you in group settings, finds excuses to be in your space, or reduces physical distance during conversation, that's a green light. Research in proxemics (the study of personal space) shows that people maintain larger distances from those they're not interested in.

**Key indicator**: She touches you during conversation. Light touches on the arm, shoulder, or knee are massive signals. Touch is intimate, and people don't casually touch others unless there's comfort and attraction. Dr. Matthew Hertenstein's research found that touch communicates distinct emotions, and attraction-based touch has specific characteristics like lightness and repetition.

## Step 4: Her Voice Changes Around You

This one blew my mind when I learned it. Women's voices actually shift when talking to someone they're attracted to. Studies published in the Journal of Nonverbal Behavior found that women raise their pitch slightly and speak more softly when interested.

But it's not just pitch. Listen for:
* Increased playfulness in tone
* More laughter (even at your mediocre jokes)
* Longer responses instead of one-word answers
* Questions that show genuine curiosity about YOU

The podcast **""The Art of Charm""** did a whole episode on vocal cues in attraction, featuring communication experts who work with everyone from politicians to celebrities. They confirmed that voice modulation is one of the most overlooked but powerful signals.

## Step 5: She Asks Personal Questions

If she's asking about your life beyond surface-level small talk, she's investing mental energy in understanding you. That's huge.

Look for questions about:
* Your background, family, or childhood
* Your goals and dreams
* Your opinions on meaningful topics
* Your past relationships (this one's a dead giveaway)

**Why this matters**: The psychology of attraction shows that curiosity indicates interest in someone's inner world. If someone just wants to be polite, they stick to safe, boring topics. Real interest digs deeper.

The book **""Attached"" by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller** (absolutely insane deep dive into attachment theory and relationships) explains how people with secure attachment styles actively seek to understand potential partners through questioning. It's a sign of healthy interest.

## Step 6: She Remembers Tiny Details

Memory is selective. We remember what matters to us. If she brings up something small you mentioned weeks ago, that detail stuck because YOU stuck.

This could be:
* Your favorite coffee order
* A story about your friend she's never met
* Your work deadline you casually mentioned
* Your dog's name or that movie you wanted to see

Cognitive psychology research shows that emotionally significant information gets encoded more strongly in memory. If you're emotionally significant to her, she'll remember your details without trying.

## Step 7: The Preening Behavior

This is straight out of evolutionary psychology. When attracted to someone, people engage in preening: adjusting their appearance to look better.

Watch if she:
* Plays with her hair (classic for a reason, it's self-soothing and draws attention)
* Adjusts her clothing when you're talking
* Checks her reflection when you're around
* Applies lip balm or fixes makeup in your presence

**The science**: These behaviors stem from our evolutionary drive to appear attractive to potential mates. Dr. David Buss, evolutionary psychologist and author of **""The Evolution of Desire""**, has documented these courtship displays across cultures. They're hardwired.

But here's the thing, preening only matters if it happens specifically when YOU'RE around. If she does it constantly with everyone, it's just her normal behavior.

## Step 8: She Laughs More, Especially at Your Bad Jokes

Humor response is a massive indicator. Studies show that women laugh significantly more around men they're attracted to, even when the jokes aren't that funny (sorry).

**The research angle**: Robert Provine's work on laughter found it's more about social bonding than actual comedy. Laughter releases endorphins and creates emotional connection. If she's laughing with you, she's building that bond.

Pay attention to whether her laughter seems:
* Genuine (reaches her eyes, not just mouth)
* Frequent during your conversations specifically
* Accompanied by touching you or leaning closer

It actually includes content from books mentioned here and hundreds more, all fact-checked and science-based.

## Step 9: She Initiates Contact

This is maybe the biggest one. If she texts first, suggests hangouts, or finds reasons to reach out, she's investing effort. People don't expend energy on people they're not interested in.

Look for:
* Double texting without apology
* Sending memes or content that reminded her of you
* Following up on previous conversations
* Making concrete plans instead of vague ""we should hang sometime""

**Reality check**: Modern dating culture makes women cautious about seeming ""too interested,"" so ANY initiation is actually significant. The book **""Modern Romance"" by Aziz Ansari** (yeah, the comedian, but he partnered with actual sociologists) explores how digital communication has changed courtship signals. Initiation in the age of ghosting and playing it cool means even more than it used to.

## Step 10: Her Friends Know About You

If her friends already know who you are, congratulations. She's been talking about you. People discuss who matters to them with their inner circle.

Signs this is happening:
* Her friends smile or react knowingly when they meet you
* They mention something about you that you only told HER
* They seem unusually welcoming or interested in you
* She mentions you to them while you're around

**The psychology**: Social validation through friend groups is crucial for women. Introducing someone into that circle, even just conversationally, means they're considering you as a real potential partner, not just a casual interest.

## The Bottom Line

Here's what matters: One sign alone means nothing. But multiple signs showing up consistently? That's your answer. Trust patterns over isolated incidents.

The biggest mistake people make is overthinking individual moments instead of looking at the overall pattern of behavior. Attraction isn't a mystery when you know what to look for. These signals exist because humans are wired to communicate interest, even when we're trying to play it cool.

Stop second-guessing yourself into paralysis. Pay attention to how someone acts around you compared to others. That difference tells you everything. And if you're seeing most of these signs? Stop reading and actually make a move, because she's probably wondering why you haven't already.",4,1767388235.0,AttractionDynamics,0,1.0,False

1q2ap6k,https://open.substack.com/pub/davidrmann3/p/three-predictions-on-the-economy?utm_campaign=post-expanded-share&utm_medium=web,Three Predictions on the Economy and How It Will Affect Restaurants in 2026,"**Three Predictions on the Economy and How It Will Affect Restaurants in 2026**

The economy was supposed to crash completely, but never did. The consumers were supposed to bounce back, but split into two groups. The labor shortage was supposed to ease, but it’s now permanent.

Most operators are waiting for the weather to change. The smart ones are preparing for the storm.

Here are three economic forces shaping 2026. Each one is backed by hard data. Each one requires action now.

**Tariffs Will Compound Costs Beyond Food**

The National Restaurant Association warned that tariffs on food and beverage imports from Mexico and Canada would cost the restaurant industry $12.1 billion and cut profits for the average independent operator by 30%. The industry spent months lobbying to exclude food and beverages from tariffs. Some were temporarily lifted in November, but country-specific tariffs remain. The costs are real. They’re here.

Tariffs hit more than avocados and coffee. Kitchen equipment from China carries tariff costs. Aluminum for packaging carries tariff costs. HVAC systems and electrical components for new construction carry tariff costs. All of these flow downstream to operators already running on 3% to 5% margins.

Restaurant operators had to increase menu prices at 31% between February 2020 and April 2025, while their food and labor costs each jumped to 35%. The math doesn’t work forever. The National Restaurant Association noted that wholesale food prices stood 38% above pre-pandemic levels as of September 2025. Operators who held the line on pricing through four years of inflation now face a second wave.

Independent restaurants lack the purchasing power of national chains. Chains shift suppliers or spread costs across hundreds of locations. Independent operators eat the increase or raise prices and risk losing customers. There is no third option.

Equipment replacement creates the secondary hit. Commercial kitchens run 12+ hours a day, seven days a week. Equipment breaks. When it does, replacement costs will now run higher than in 2025. Equipment financing will cost more. Development timelines will stretch longer. Expansion plans will slow.

Operators who assume 2025 prices when planning 2026 openings will blow past their budgets. Factor in 10% to 15% higher costs before signing leases. Order equipment early. Lock in financing now. Tariffs don’t care about your timeline.

**The Labor Shortage Won’t End, It Will Shift**

The restaurant industry added 120,000 jobs over five months in mid-2025. That sounds promising until you learn the industry still needs 450,000 workers to reach pre-pandemic staffing levels. Full-service restaurants post the highest number of open positions, while limited-service operations recovered their workforce.

The shortage isn’t easing. The shortage is redistributing. Quick service is fine. Full service is bleeding.

A TD Bank survey of 253 restaurant franchise leaders found that 54% cited a shrinking labor pool as their biggest concern for 2026. This isn’t a hiring problem. This is a structural realignment of how people choose to work.

Younger workers entering the labor force want flexible schedules and predictable hours. They find warehouse jobs with consistent shifts. They drive for DoorDash and control when they work. They take retail positions with lower stress. Restaurants can’t compete on flexibility alone because service hours are fixed.

The operators who win in 2026 will redesign operations around the workforce they have, not the workforce they wish they had. Streamline menus to reduce kitchen complexity. Invest in technology that cuts the number of bodies needed per shift. Pay above minimum wage and offer real benefits.

Some operators eliminated tipping for guaranteed hourly wages. Others added mandatory gratuities regardless of party size. Health insurance and paid time off are no longer nice-to-have perks. They’re table stakes for attracting workers who have options.

Today, operators have to adapt quickly to the labor market. Operators who wait for the old days to return will operate short-staffed while watching competitors pull ahead.

**The K-Shaped Consumer Will Define Winners and Losers**

Consumer spending split sharply by income in 2025. Bank of America data from November showed spending from consumers in the top third of income distribution rose 4% year over year, the fastest growth in four years. Consumers earning under $50,000 reduced restaurant visits to once a week or less. The middle got squeezed in between.

The K-shaped economy isn’t new. The K-shaped economy is accelerating.

Higher-income consumers dine out at pre-pandemic levels or higher. They show minimal price sensitivity. They want experience, quality, and convenience. Lower-income consumers cut back on frequency, trade down to cheaper restaurants, or order less expensive items. Middle-income consumers try to maintain their habits while absorbing stagnant wage growth and persistent inflation.

This creates two distinct markets. Restaurants serving higher-income demographics will see stable or growing traffic in 2026. Restaurants relying on lower-income consumers will face continued pressure. The brands that succeed across both segments deliver value, not discounts.

Chili’s proved this in 2025. The chain posted 31% same-store sales growth in Q2 by combining operational improvements with a $10.99 value meal that competed with fast food. The chain streamlined its menu, upgraded kitchen equipment, and invested heavily in marketing. Applebee’s followed with its Two-for-$25 deal, and ended years of same-store sales declines.

Value isn’t about discounting. Value is about giving consumers a reason to choose your restaurant. For higher-income consumers, value means experience and quality. For lower-income consumers, value means price and portion size. For middle-income consumers, value means all of it.

The restaurants that win in 2026 will know which segment they serve and deliver what that segment wants. The restaurants that try to be everything to everyone will keep losing market share to focused operators.

**What This Means For Operators**

The National Restaurant Association projected the foodservice industry will reach $1.5 trillion in sales for last year, with modest growth continuing on into 2026. It’s really hard to predict what the economy is doing now. Economists seem to do a better job looking back on data 10 or 15 years, rather than seeing what is in front of them now.

These projections could mean restaurants will keep growing, or not. Margins will tighten regardless. Operators who react to these trends early will gain market share. Operators who wait will fall behind.

Tariffs are here. Budget for them now. Labor shortages are permanent. Redesign your operations to work with fewer people or pay more to attract better people. The K-shaped consumer isn’t going away. Pick your segment and deliver what they value.

The economy in 2026 will reward operators who adapt and punish operators who hope for a return to 2019. The restaurants that thrive will stop waiting for conditions to improve and start building operations designed for the conditions that exist.

I shared this tool earlier and have since added some big updates, so reposting.

Now supporting both all Minecraft editions!

I’ve been working on this tool that helps you find the cheapest anvil order for combining enchantments in real, survival gameplay scenarios.

Check it out here:  
[https://enchantmentoptimization.vercel.app/](https://enchantmentoptimization.vercel.app/)

What it does:

* Takes items that already have enchants and works with them
* Handles merging two enchanted items, not just enchanted books
* Supports item + book and book-only anvil combinations
* Figures out the exact anvil sequence to keep XP costs as low as possible
* Covers newer enchantments like Lunge for the Spear

This is meant for real survival play and considers items pulled from loot chests, villagers, or enchantment tables, not just for starting each item from scratch.

This has been a genuinely fun project that I’ve put a lot of time and care into, and I’d love for people here to try it out and tell me how it works for them. Feedback, recommended future updates, and suggestions are very welcome.

Since launching this website, I received my very first coffees (donations) on New Year’s Day on Buy Me a Coffee. I originally created it hoping to earn a little support for my college fees and personal projects, and that encouragement really motivated me.

Inspired by it, I’ve now launched a small shop where I offer fully custom, simple web pages/websites, along with help in deploying and setting everything up. I’m also offering a **15% launch discount** (using code **LAUNCH15**) for the first few customers.

I’d really appreciate it if you could check it out [here](http://buymeacoffee.com/codewithbottle). Thank you so much for the support, and wishing everyone a very happy New Year!",1,1767388078.0,SideProject,0,1.0,False

1q2ampg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q2ampg,Mini Chemex(ish) Testing,"For Christmas, my wife found me this adorable, small version of the popular Chemex brewer. It's designed to brew maybe 2-3 cups (the lines go up to 400ml) at most vs the 6-10 cups you'd get out of a normal Chemex in this shape. While Chemex does make 3-cup brewers, they don't have the typical 60-degree filter chamber on top like this one does. So it's a bit of an unusual brewer, being the same shape as the larger classic Chemex brewers but so small.

I've never brewed with a Chemex before, so this will be a bit of a learning curve. I believe drawdown times are typically longer than V60-style drippers. According to my internet research, Chemex coffee is known for clarity, brightness, and lighter, tea-like coffees. So this might be a great pairing with some of the floral coffees I picked up in the Luminous End of the Year box set.

For my first brew, I went with the Perc Diego Bermudez Colombian coffee that I've brewed before, resulting in notes of cinnamon and coffee cake. I also decided on a whim to use unbleached V60 filter paper just to see what it would do. Since Chemex 3-cup papers won't fit, and 6 or 8 cup filters are way too huge, standard V60 filters will have to do.

Overall, the coffee mimics the style of Chemex. Drawdown was a bit longer, around 3:45 compared to the usual 2:30 I might see in my Origami or Colum drippers. The coffee has a much lighter body and lower intensity of flavor. I'd say it's borderline weak, so I may just have to grind finer next time and see what an even longer brew will do. I still get some lighter spice notes, caramel, and roast, but it isn't as rich as other brew methods.

For my second attempt, I decided to test out one of my more floral coffees with faster Cafec Abaca filter paper.

I noticed it's challenging to seat the paper really well against the glass, so it's a bit finicky. Anywhere that has an air bubble under the paper can allow some bypass of brewing water, leading to a weaker, less-extracted cup of coffee. This is also true of the pouring spout, but you can't really get around that aspect with this brewer without risking stalling when the filter plugs the spout.

I pulled out another coffee from Luminous, their Colombian washed typica with tasting notes of jasmine, honeysuckle, apricot, and floral aspects. The brew is very light and tea-like. It's sweet, though, even without sugar. But the aromatics and flavors are light and subtle. I do notice a honey-like flavor, as well as the apricot. Any floral notes are very subtle in the background, and I'm not really getting much jasmine.

The subtlety and lack of clearer flavors could be a reflection of the water chemistry at our new home. I haven't been able to mix up my normal coffee water and have been using the filtered tap water through the fridge to make my brews. Perhaps if I pick up some distilled water and make my normal water recipe I'll get more of the flavors I'm expecting to taste.

Still, I'm surprised at how quickly I've been able to make fairly decent coffee without over-extracting. I've noticed no harsh, bitter or astringent characteristics in my first two cups at all, despite the brews taking longer than I'm used to. Maybe it's time to push the grind even finer to see where that limit is.",5,1767387987.0,pourover,2,0.86,False

She has been on blood thinners and follow up appointments to make sure everything resolved. At 9am I get a call from her in tears asking about what it felt like when I had an ovarian cyst rupture. She describes the pain to me  and tells me she cannot drive to urgent care/ER bc of it. She said that her fiancé is on a job but would try to hurry through it (replacing two air filters @8:45am). He asked if the neighbor could take her to urgent care, but that neighbor is out of state. I live 45 minutes away from my sister. After hearing her level of pain, I offer to come get her immediately. On my way there I stay on the phone with her so she doesn’t pass out or anything. Before her turn, we discuss if I should go in with her or not. I am 8 months pregnant and have been trying to avoid exposure to illness. We both agree that I will wait in the car for her. She also tells me if I want to go shop around while waiting (she was still 3rd in line) that she didn’t mind if I left and came back. I stay in the lot for about an hour ( but again 8 months pregnant) and don’t have water, and need to use the bathroom. There is a coffee shop 1/2 a block away so I ask if she’s okay if I go over there while waiting (via text) and she says that’s fine. While there waiting I’m texting with her the whole time getting updates and such. She tells me they did the CT and will have results in 15-30 minutes. I finish up my food and go straight back to the urgent care lot, again 1/2 block away. I park and see her fiancé walking up to my car within a minute of me being there (11:40am) He tells me thanks for taking her. I tell him something like well I wanted her to get here because it could have been her appendix or worse. No tone or anything, just wanted to stress that it was important she got immediate care. He starts talking like he’s been there for a long time and telling me about the CT and waiting for results. I’m like are, you up to date on everything? He’s like oh ya. I tell him they also did a blood test, urine test and IV. I was so confused that he was there at all, I figured my sister could have at least told me if he had been there. Still, did not regret going to get her at all, just confused. He makes a comment like he was surprised when I wasn’t there that I would just leave her at the urgent care like that. I tell him we had both decided for me to wait in the car to avoid exposure to illness. He tells me that no one seemed sick. I texted her and asked since fiancé was here if she wanted me to stay. She said no you’re good, I’m so sorry for making you wait I didn’t know he was coming otherwise she wouldn’t have made me wait up there for her.

I'm a freelance video editor doing 5-7 jobs per month. I always start with similar folder structures when working on a project, if it's a video near 15 folders, if it's a film then 20. Yesterday I needed to create 3 different project folders and collaborate with a teammate and then I thought, why not build a simple software for this in Antigravity?

So I googled a bit and found some python scripts that can do this job, found a couple of libraries for GUI (Tried flet first but couldn't manage to make it work so decided to tell Opus to use customtkinter) and told which features I want and how I want it to look. After a couple of hours, boom. What a great time!

And I made FolderCrafter. It's not only generating folder structures, you can also create folder structure templates, export them as json and send teammates/friends and import jsons. Who knows maybe some they there will be folder structure libraries for this app :)

# HiBREW H1B 6-in-1: Nespresso Rival or Reigning Champ?

Choosing a home coffee maker can feel overwhelming. If you're torn between the familiar ease of Nespresso and the versatile promise of the HiBREW H1B 6-in-1, understanding their core differences is key.

Nespresso machines are renowned for their consistent espresso shots and straightforward operation. They leverage proprietary capsules, offering a curated coffee experience with minimal fuss. The HiBREW H1B, however, aims for broader appeal with its ""6-in-1"" capability, allowing it to brew using not only Nespresso-compatible pods but also grounds, K-Cups, ESE pods, and even milk for lattes and cappuccinos. This flexibility comes at the cost of a slightly more involved process compared to Nespresso's push-button simplicity.

*   **Nespresso's Strength:** Unmatched convenience and crema for espresso lovers.
*   **HiBREW's Edge:** Adaptability for various coffee types and brewing methods.
*   **Consideration:** Nespresso offers a vast, consistent pod ecosystem, while HiBREW opens doors to loose grounds and alternative capsules.

Ultimately, the best choice depends on your priorities: pure, simple espresso convenience or a wider range of brewing possibilities.

Since launching this website, I received my very first coffees (donations) on New Year’s Day on Buy Me a Coffee. I originally created it hoping to earn a little support for my college fees and personal projects, and that encouragement really motivated me.

Inspired by it, I’ve now launched a small shop where I offer fully custom, simple web pages/websites, along with help in deploying and setting everything up. I’m also offering a **15% launch discount** (using code **LAUNCH15**) for the first few customers.

I’d really appreciate it if you could check it out [here](http://buymeacoffee.com/codewithbottle). Thank you so much for the support, and wishing everyone a very happy New Year!",1,1767387769.0,IMadeThis,0,1.0,False

Founders hate pitching.
Investors hate cold outreach.
Everyone hates pretending they “should grab coffee.”

So I built Catalyst Intro — basically Tinder, but instead of dating, it’s founders + investors swiping on each other without the fake enthusiasm.

No decks. No intros from “mutuals.”
Just mutual interest or nothing.

Is this genius or just peak founder delusion?

She sees a new guy literally every week and every week I get the same damn messages about a different dude. “He’s so kind.” “Green flags all around” “he’s a dad and has a good relationship with his ex so he must be great” “he bought me a coffee, who is this man’s???” Like STFU and stop falling for guys after one week. 10/10 times these dudes all end up ghosting her after sleeping with her. We work together and all day everyday at work she’s non stop talking about men, telling me the same stories she told me in text the night before, etc. If you dare to bring up anything about your life, it’s instantly compared to some thing her new man has done for her in the 2 days she’s known him. If I go to my friend ranting about my marriage, it’s instant “don’t settle for that crap- find a man like mine (insert name of guy she met on tinder last night). It’s driving me insane! I can’t have a normal conversation with her without her relationship or the week becoming the entire topic of conversation. She is more of a coworker than a BFF but I spend lots of time with her each week at work and it’s suffocating how much I hear about her boyfriends. I’m not the only coworker that’s noticed it, infact I’ve heard 3 coworkers in the last month alone make passive aggressive comments to her about her situationships and she was completely oblivious (or just didn’t care?)

I’m ready to block her and not speak to her at work at all anymore because it is genuinely so god damn annoying. Would I be the ass if I confronted her? How does one silently distance yourself from the person you sit next to every day, 8 hours a day?? and no, changing desks is not an option unfortunately. 🫠",2,1767387726.0,AITAH,6,1.0,False

1q2ahis,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1q2ahis/aita_for_waiting_next_door_for_my_sister_while/,AITA for waiting next door for my sister while she is in urgent care?,"For some background, back in July my sister had blood clots that were in her legs and had moved to her lungs. She has been on blood thinners and follow up appointments to make sure everything resolved. At 9am I get a call from her in tears asking about what it felt like when I had an ovarian cyst rupture. She describes the pain to me  and tells me she cannot drive to urgent care/ER bc of it. She said that her fiancé is on a job but would try to hurry through it (replacing two air filters @8:45am). He asked if the neighbor could take her to urgent care, but that neighbor is out of state. I live 45 minutes away from my sister. After hearing her level of pain, I offer to come get her immediately. On my way there I stay on the phone with her so she doesn’t pass out or anything. Before her turn, we discuss if I should go in with her or not. I am 8 months pregnant and have been trying to avoid exposure to illness. We both agree that I will wait in the car for her. She also tells me if I want to go shop around while waiting (she was still 3rd in line) that she didn’t mind if I left and came back. I stay in the lot for about an hour ( but again 8 months pregnant) and don’t have water, and need to use the bathroom. There is a coffee shop 1/2 a block away so I ask if she’s okay if I go over there while waiting (via text) and she says that’s fine. While there waiting I’m texting with her the whole time getting updates and such. She tells me they did the CT and will have results in 15-30 minutes. I finish up my food and go straight back to the urgent care lot, again 1/2 block away. I park and see her fiancé walking up to my car within a minute of me being there (11:40am) He tells me thanks for taking her. I tell him something like well I wanted her to get here because it could have been her appendix or worse. No tone or anything, just wanted to stress that it was important she got immediate care. He starts talking like he’s been there for a long time and telling me about the CT and waiting for results. I’m like are, you up to date on everything? He’s like oh ya. I tell him they also did a blood test, urine test and IV. I was so confused that he was there at all, I figured my sister could have at least told me if he had been there. Still, did not regret going to get her at all, just confused. He makes a comment like he was surprised when I wasn’t there that I would just leave her at the urgent care like that. I tell him we had both decided for me to wait in the car to avoid exposure to illness. He tells me that no one seemed sick. I texted her and asked since fiancé was here if she wanted me to stay. She said no you’re good, I’m so sorry for making you wait I didn’t know he was coming otherwise she wouldn’t have made me wait up there for her.

Price sits in that premium lane versus a lot of whirlpool/ge and even some samsung units, so I expected near-zero drama for the money.

Cleaning performance is legit. PrecisionWash type behavior is noticeable, since the sprayed-on oatmeal bowls and coffee cups came out clean without pre scrubbing. Noise level is the standout: it’s basically whisper quiet, and you depend on the InfoLight to know it’s running. InfoLight visibility is good on most floors, though bright sun on light tile can wash it out a bit.

CrystalDry effectiveness is mixed. Plastics do come out drier than typical condensation drying, but the drying technology still leaves moisture on the stainless interior walls and sometimes the door, which can turn into a slight musty smell if you keep it shut. Drying also ties into cycle length options, since CrystalDry is not available on the shortest cycle, and even the “short” end still feels long compared to competitors with auto door pop-open drying.

Third rack flexibility is great for lids and utensils, yet rack layout and adjustability feel a little “European.” Tall mugs and big glasses can be fiddly, and loading capacity at 16 place settings is real only if you load it just right. People arent kidding about sensitivity: a misloaded item can trigger an error (folks mention a red blinking light) with zero helpful guidance, which is maddening.

Installation experience was straightforward for me: level it, secure it, 120V hookup, water line connections, and a few shims, done. Interior build quality is solid stainless. Door and handle design (pocket handle) keeps fingerprints down. Maintenance and cleaning are easy, the filter/food trap twists out and rinses quick.

Customer support experience sounds hit or miss, plus delivery/3rd party scheduling complaints. Reliability over time is the big question with reports of units arriving dead or not powering up even with confirmed power.

It was written in my native language, and I used ChatGPT to translate it and fix errors that I made, that’s why it looks like a typical ChatGPT structure. I used ChatGPT quite often these last weeks, I know it’s not the smartest decision, but I think it helped me come out of the worst moments.

And of course, this is a throwaway account.



**The Whole Story**

**Characters (with anonymized names)**

* **Abigail** – my girlfriend
* **Oliver** – my best friend over the past year
* **James** – my former best friend; lately I spend more time with Oliver
* **Evelyn** – James’s girlfriend, basically my best female friend

**Events**

* **Dance School**: A tradition in my village where graduating elementary school students can attend ballroom dance classes during the summer. In the final week there is a competition, and the very last event is an exam ball.
* **Bachelor Party**: One of my friends got married in October; a few days before that, we held a bachelor party for him.

**Locations**

* **ThePub**: A relatively upscale entertainment venue in my village, more refined than a simple pub.

  


**Timeline**

**Summer 2012:**  
Abigail was my dance school partner in 2012. We got together for about three months, then I broke up with her.

**Late 2015 (around prom season):**  
I randomly saw her on a train. We started chatting on Messenger, I invited her to my prom, she came, we went to the afterparty, and we slept together at a friend’s place.

**December 2015:**  
There was a party at a friend’s place. I invited her, she came, but when I started asking whether something could happen between us, nothing did. She lived in a more distant city (I think she said the distance would be too much, but I’m not completely sure anymore).

**2015–2024:**  
We wished each other happy birthday every year. We did this for years, with only small breaks at most. We maintained a friendly relationship.

**May 2024:**  
Again, birthday wishes. After that we talked every few months, had good conversations. Even then it was already clear that she was trying to pick me up.

**October 2024:**  
She invited me out for tea. I went, we talked a lot, and it turned out she was single because she had separated from her husband, and of course she has two daughters. I already knew about the kids from Facebook, but not necessarily about the separation. After that, we kept talking.

**November 2024:**  
She organized a ball in her hometown and invited me. I felt that we shouldn’t really be together yet, and that going together would strongly imply something, so I didn’t go. Later I apologized. We talked occasionally.

**December 2024:**  
At Christmas we wished each other happy holidays.

Around this time, when I was partying with friends (James, Evelyn, Oliver), if I had drunk enough, I sometimes sent her photos or selfies, often with Evelyn. From this she assumed Evelyn and I might be together, but she never asked directly.

**2025:**  
I don’t remember everything exactly anymore, but we continued talking from time to time, I occasionally sent photos, etc.

**Summer 2025:**  
Before dance school, at an outdoor spritzer terrace, I got drunk. I had been thinking for a long time about what to do. I messaged her, telling her that there were big parties going on here, that dance school warm-ups were happening because the competition and exam ball were the following week. She said she would love to come to dance school; it would be nice to reminisce.

  


**Final Week of Dance School**

**Tuesday:**  
The last regular dance class. We sat around talking, maybe danced once. This is where I introduced her to Oliver.

After that, we talked on Messenger, maybe Snapchat too. It became more and more obvious that she wanted something. I invited her to the competition/exam ball as well, but told her I wouldn’t have much time because I would be filming. She said she would come to the competition, but couldn’t make it to the exam ball.

**Thursday – Competition:**  
She met Evelyn and James too. My parents saw her, recognized her, and the family also asked who she was that I was there with.

We kept stepping out to ThePub during breaks for soft drinks.

People joked, including James and the others, that Oliver had a girlfriend because they saw him with someone at ThePub. Then they realized who she was, and I explained the situation, since I had already told them about her and they knew who she was. She danced a bit with Oliver while I was filming. After I finished, she danced with me. All five of us joined the group dances.

We talked; she said she could manage to come to the exam ball as well if I wanted her to. We agreed that afterward we could go for a drink at ThePub.

**Saturday – Exam Ball:**  
There was a lot of filming, so she mostly sat around. She danced with Oliver in a few dances. When I finished my work, we danced together. It ended, I quickly took my equipment home, rushed back to ThePub, but by the time I arrived she already had to head home.

After that, we talked constantly. On Snapchat she started sharing more and more spicy information, sometimes even photos.

  


**Late Summer – Vacation**

We were on vacation with my family, talking nonstop, video chatting. I had a huge internal dilemma about whether to get into this whole thing. I talked about it with others too. Because of the vacation, we couldn’t meet for a week, and something always kept coming up afterward. (See later: “the universe”.)

She told me how much bad stuff had happened to her over the years: boyfriends who hit her, how mentally exhausted she was.

She noticed my overthinking; we even argued a bit.  
She said she couldn’t survive being broken again, and asked if I wouldn’t break her. Of course I said I wouldn’t; it wasn’t even a question. Eventually we reconciled and everything settled.

I think around this time I told her for the first time (maybe not in exactly these words):  
“If you don’t feel happy with me, tell me.”

  


**After Vacation**

Evelyn was doing student work, selling fruit on the street. Abigail came over for ice cream, because I had promised during dance school but we hadn’t had time due to filming. I then offered to drive her home, so since we had time, we went to see Evelyn at work. We talked a lot with her; Evelyn was watching what was happening.

Days or weeks later, at a random party with James, I asked what everyone thought. Evelyn said she thought something wasn’t right and I should be careful. James didn’t like it either, but he hadn’t known her long, so it was up to me. Oliver said I should go for it.

I started moving toward her more seriously. We developed an inside joke that “the universe” didn’t want us to get together. Once she didn’t come to a date/party—I don’t remember exactly—because she had an “accident,” twisted her ankle, went to the hospital, didn’t work for a week, and couldn’t go anywhere.

After that, something always came up; it never worked out.

  


**September 2025**

After moving every stone and going against the universe, she came over to my place. My parents were away. She originally could only stay for an hour, but I arranged a car so I could drive her home, so she stayed longer. What had to happen, happened.

By this time I had already been asking her for a while what we were—whether we were together or what. There was never a clear answer. This time I asked: if someone asks, what should I say? Can I say you’re my girlfriend?  
She said she was still mentally very exhausted, not ready, and needed some time. I said okay, no need to rush; I could wait.

I drove her to her hometown and helped her pack. In two months there would be another ball, and preparations slowly began.

She had started working at a supermarket sometime in late summer or September. I occasionally went to her current village just to run into her while she was working. We didn’t really had much time to talk or do anything, so it wasn’t that useful, but we were happy to see each other.

I also had to go to City A for work, 3 days of my week was always full, so dates never really worked out. But we video chatted either in the morning or evening, usually for at least an hour.

She was transferred to City B for a week due to workforce redistribution. Again, meeting got delayed (the universe, haha). I drove to City B to see her. The first day we walked around, saw the local river, collected pretty shells, talked, had a great time. Then we went to a restaurant there—I knew it was nice because I had been there with my parents earlier that year. We ate, talked, and she told me she had never been taken to a restaurant before. I couldn’t believe it—what kind of terrible men had she been with? She felt so good with me. In the evening I drove her to her accommodation and went home.

That night she said I could have stayed; it would have been possible under the accommodation rules or by bending them a bit. I could hear how much she wanted me there, but I was already home, so nothing happened.

The next afternoon we agreed I’d come over in the evening, stay the night, and leave in the morning. That’s what happened; I won’t go into details.

Either that was the first day or there was also a third day—my memories blur—but we were sitting in a park looking at a beautiful fountain. She was almost trembling, clearly wanting to say something. I finally got it out of her: she said she felt really good with me and offered that once she moved into her new apartment, how would I feel about getting a spare key so I could come over whenever. I agreed. Things were moving fast, but we had known each other for 13 years—even with long breaks—so we went with it.

It turned out her goddaughter Mia would be moving in with her too, around 16–17 years old.

(Around here there was a small party at my place with the three of us: Oliver, Abigail, and me. I talked less and less with the others; James and Evelyn were arguing a lot at the time and never had time.)

Housewarming party: Oliver and I went over together. We drank, there was a party. There were some issues; I don’t remember much, but overall it was okay. Present were Abigail, Mia, one of Mia’s friends, Oliver, and me.

At first I just went over occasionally; I don’t think I always slept there.

Sometimes we agreed in the morning that I’d go over in the evening, then no news all day, and in the evening she’d call saying she’d been home for ages, showered, and was already falling into bed. I’d grumble a bit, then she’d say I should come over anyway, and I did.

After that my memory gets fuzzy, but slowly I moved in with her permanently. We partied about once a week; Oliver usually came over.

  


**Conflicts and Collapse**

I once took Abigail and Mia shopping in a city where Evelyn studied. The idea came up to see how Evelyn was doing. She was depressed, complaining about James, school being bad—the usual, and it had been going on for a long time. I wanted to drop it, but Abigail insisted we pick her up and take her shopping with us. We did. Evelyn complained nonstop. That evening, the topic came up again. I talked to Evelyn on Messenger; she kept throwing tantrums there too. Abigail told me to ignore her because she could see she was just stressing me out. I then accidentally said that Evelyn didn’t like Abigail either. During the summer I had once asked her opinion of Abigail; she said based on what she heard from me and saw during the visit we did while she worked her job, she felt I’d become like a “puppy,” and that something was off with the kids too. Abigail got furious, blocked Evelyn, and never wanted to talk to her again. (This kind of reaction happened at least one more time, whenever her kids were targeted she become a furious and protective person) I distanced myself from Evelyn too—and with that, from James as well.

Time passed; parties continued.

  


**October 2025 – Discovery**

She left her phone unlocked in the room and went away. I saw a Messenger conversation pop up and glanced at it. I saw she was talking to a guy. I remembered that sometime around the tea phase or shortly after, sometime in 2024–2025, there had been a Facebook post that they were together—so this was definitely her ex. Curiosity got the better of me, and I read back.

“No, no, no. This can’t be happening.”

Messages like:  
“Oh, I miss you so much, I still love you, I’m suffering alone.”

I found out that during the bachelor party they had even arranged a meeting a few streets away from the apartment, since I wasn’t home then—we slept at the bachelor party location. She claimed they only talked, there was nothing between them, there hadn’t been for a long time, and there wouldn’t be; she hated him.

I lost it. I asked what the hell this was. She made excuses, said it was nothing, not to take it seriously, and blocked him in front of me. I told her there were two options: either she was lying to him and stringing him along out of spite or something—which would be extremely cruel—or it was true and she loved him. She said she didn’t know why, but what she wrote wasn’t true, she didn’t love him, she only replied because he had cheated on her before and hurt her.

I said this wasn’t going to work. She broke down, had a panic attack, everything you can imagine. I told her I’d stay the night so she could calm down. In the following days we talked it through; I calmed down a bit and gave her a second chance. But from then on, the first real problem started: my trust was badly shaken, and suspicions kept popping up.

  


**November 2025:**  
The organization of the ball was in full swing. We kept having small parties in a group of four, sometimes with an extra random girl brought along by Mia, but basically the core group was always the same four people: Abigail, Mia, Oliver, and me. We had our own little friend group, and around this time Luna became a permanent fifth member. She was about the same age as Mia, from my partner’s hometown, a substitute dancer, Mia’s close friend, and Abigail had known her for a long time as well.

Out of a random joke, we ended up giving each other “family roles,” creating a sort of family vibe:

* Abigail was the mom,
* I was the dad,
* Mia and Luna were the daughters,
* and Oliver was the godfather.

We joked around, spent time together, partied, went to dance rehearsals, and the days passed.

  


**November 12–14, 2025 (Wednesday to Friday):**  
I had to go up to City A for work. Because of all the ball preparations, I hadn’t been there for about five weeks, always finding some excuse to be able to work from home. She never wanted me to leave home. Twice I really didn’t go because of illness, and there were also cases when the office day was canceled by the company.

Abigail came with me this time; she was on vacation anyway—or maybe by then she had already been fired from the supermarket, that’s another story. We had a good time there: went on the Ferris wheel, and on Friday we went hiking at a famous hike trail.

On Thursday during the day (it turned out I didn’t have to go into the office), I worked from home. I tried to pay attention to her too, but at one point I wanted to quickly check something on my laptop again. She got offended. I told her I had to work. She suddenly said that then she didn’t even need to be here and wanted to go home. She started throwing a tantrum completely out of nowhere. I didn’t understand how she even planned to get home—she didn’t know which district she was in or when trains ran.

I got angry and said that then she was probably done here. I handed her the garage key, saying she’d probably need that too. She started crying, saying I was breaking up with her. We argued. For the umpteenth time, I told her that if she wasn’t happy like this, she should tell me, because I wouldn’t stay if she didn’t want me to—but she told me not to say things like that. Eventually, we managed to calm things down and reconcile.

  


**Back at our apartment:**  
From time to time my distrust kept resurfacing. Even the smallest thing made me suspicious. In the days before the ball, during a random weekday drinking session, I saw from the window that when Abigail and Mia came home from shopping, they were talking to two guys. My mind started racing; I couldn’t handle it. Oliver and I went out to the car as an excuse, saying something had been left there. By the time we got back, only one guy was still there, and from a distance we couldn’t tell who it was.

They came inside. I didn’t bring it up, and they didn’t really say much either. We kept drinking. We got into a random argument about something, Abigail stormed off. I didn’t care. Others told me to go see her, but I brushed it off. Later I went up to her; a huge fight broke out. I don’t remember exactly what was said, but I’m sure I told her again that if she wasn’t happy, she should say so—this was probably the fifth time by then.

That evening they took me upstairs to sleep; I usually passed out earlier than the others.

After that, things were more or less okay. The ball finally arrived. We went as usual, the five of us: the two girls, “mom,” “dad,” and the “godfather”.

At the ball she didn’t dance much with me; she kept dancing with dancers from other villages. She was the head of the minority self-government in her hometown, so it wasn’t surprising that she danced with everyone—but then she commented to me about how much the guys were hitting on her. That made me grumble internally again about why she danced with them if that was the case, but I didn’t say anything.

That night we got home, Oliver collapsed onto the couch as usual. I took Abigail and suggested we go upstairs, but she said she still wanted to talk and wanted us to stay downstairs. The three of us fell asleep there. I woke up because it was incredibly uncomfortable. I tried to wake her, but she was completely out cold, so I went upstairs alone.

  


**The next morning – back to her hometown:**  
We packed, tidied up, and so on.

The days passed relatively smoothly. There was a lot of happiness. She got a new job, working in a café in my hometown. On those days we slept at my parents’ place. The job itself was pretty boring, but I always stopped by during lunch to bring her food and chat a bit. In the mornings, Oliver would also stop by on his way to work to grab a coffee with her.

My parents liked her a lot too. During November, when we were sick, they brought us lunch so we wouldn’t have to deal with cooking. At one point Abigail had blood pressure issues (she has some kind of heart condition, maybe she takes medication to lower her pulse?), so they brought us a blood pressure monitor to keep at home. They also gave us frying pans. It was clear how welcoming they were toward her. Sometimes it came up in conversation, and we were happy about how well everything seemed to be going.

  


**Last week of November 2025:**  
We agreed that we should go see *Zootopia 2* and watch the first movie together at home beforehand. Then she remembered that the ice rink was open and suggested we should go ice skating too, because it would be so romantic. I had never skated before, but I agreed for her sake.

One day we went to the cinema and invited Oliver as well. The day ended nicely; it was a great evening.

The next day we went ice skating, again the three of us. I was pretty hopeless, and I was scared too. They couldn’t really help much. It wasn’t the best evening. She said she could see how bad it was for me and that she wouldn’t organize more programs like that. I reassured her that it was fine and that it wasn’t a problem.

  


**December 6, 2025:**

She (and her partner, so me) was invited to the neighboring village that had a similar minority-organized show/event, similar to the ball she organized, but it was a show, so no dancing for us. We stayed in bed until about 11 a.m., then she said it was time to get ready. She looked out our bedroom window and complained about how many leaves were in the yard. She looked at me and told me to go down and take care of it.

(I had always kept the yard in order, but I hadn’t had time for a few weeks. She never had to ask; I always did it willingly. I helped her clean too—I really tried to contribute my share to the relationship in every way.)

So, I went down and did it. In the meantime, she showered, put on makeup, did her hair—the usual.

We went to the show, and I jokingly told her that her “husband,” the one she danced a lot with at the ball, was there.

Abigail: Why would you say that? That’s not funny. And also, I don’t have a ring on my finger, because You hadn’t put on there yet.

Me: Alright then, wife.

As a “funny” side note: a few weeks earlier she had told me that out of the roughly six men she had been with, about five had proposed to her, and she had said yes to all of them—yet only one actually became her husband. (Who she divorced like two years ago…. Well not really because the papers were not filled yet, there were some complications with it, never knew the details.)

That evening we had to go pick up my mom; that was the deal since I had borrowed the car. We agreed that if we were already going into the city, we should do some shopping—Christmas tree, decorations, and so on. Then we thought maybe we could drink a bit in the evening too—the usual five-person party with board games (we had a funny game and a drinking game). So: shopping, pick up my mom, go home, pick up Oliver, go to the house. Then we decided to take Oliver with us to pick up my mom too, so we went the three of us.

That night we drank heavily. I passed out and was carried upstairs to sleep.

  


**December 7, 2025:**  
She spent the day in her hometown with the girls (she usually went there on Sundays, always during the day). I went home to my parents in the meantime. Around 3 p.m. she told me she’d be home by 4, not 5 or 6. I headed to the train, got home, and we agreed we’d eat, rest, watch a movie—everything. Almost none of that happened. We ate, then collapsed on the couch, stayed there for hours, showered, and fell into bed.

By this point, my lack of trust had been driving me insane for weeks. No matter how much I tried to work on it, sometimes I checked her phone and looked at her Messenger messages, waiting to see her ex or someone else appear again—but there was nothing.

I felt super bad, breaking her trust like that. I was terrified that she would see me do it one time, and it would be over for the relationship. But I couldn't shake the feeling from my head that there was something there.

  


**December 7, 2025, around 9 p.m.:**  
She fell asleep. I took her phone and unlocked it. Snapchat was open, but it was locked too. I already knew this was where the problem would be. I unlocked it—and there it was.

(There are screenshots of this as well.)

“Alright, good night, I’m going to sleep now, my love, I love you, kiss.”

I thought, okay, I was right. Let’s see who the hell this is.

**Jackson.**

Wait. Let’s look.

Abigail: *“Baby is senile, forgets everything.”*  
Jackson: *“That’s not good. Just don’t forget last night—that wouldn’t be good. But you won’t, I guess.”*

Last night? What… what?!

I scrolled up.

Abigail: *“Are we sleeping together tonight?”*  
Jackson: *“I’d like to, but what about (me)?”*  
Abigail: *“We’ll get him drunk lol.”*

That night I lost the drinking game badly and I drank almost all the time. (They probably cheated so I’d have to drink.) And by now you’ve probably figured out who Jackson was.

Yes.  
It was **Oliver**.

They were sitting right in front of me, messaging each other about sleeping together. They got me drunk and carried me upstairs to sleep, like they did at almost every party, so they could fuck downstairs while I was just a few meters away. Then they always laughed about how hungover I was the next day—poor me.

The morning after that night, I went downstairs and again found Oliver half-naked at one end of the couch and Abigail curled up at the other end. The usual. This had happened several times before. It felt a bit strange, but what was I supposed to think? I went to places with Evelyn a lot of times, she was my best female friend, I had other friends whose girls I was very close with. Never. Not a single second, would I feel like that I want to do something with them, they are my friends girls, and also my female friends, so obviously no chance of something happening. It’s such a basic principal.

 He was my best friend, and Abigail always reacted with “Eww, never” whenever Oliver came up jokingly as a potential guy. In hindsight, all those signs are painfully obvious.

I completely broke down. Even writing this now, I’m shaking.

I went into the next room to Mia and asked if she knew.

Mia: “Knew what?”  
I showed her the pictures.  
Mia: “Holy shit, that’s Oliver?”  
Me: “Yes.”  
Mia: “Oh my God. What are you going to do?”

  


**I woke Abigail up.**

Abigail: “What is it? Come sleep.”  
Me: “Why should I sleep?”  
Abigail: “Because it’s night, lie next to me.”  
Me: “Why?”  
Abigail: “Because I love you.”  
Me: “You love me? Are you sure? Me, only me, there’s no one else?”

I asked every single question, one by one. Every answer was that yes, of course, I was the only one, she didn’t need anyone else. (In the previous weeks, when I helped her clean, she even bragged to her coworker that I was helping and that I was the best guy.)

I showed her the phone and asked: then what is this? You’re fucking behind my back? Since when? (That never got answered.)

I messaged Oliver too, asking what the hell this was and since when. He didn’t say. At first he claimed it had been going on for at most two weeks. The first Snapchat message I saw was dated November 12, (sound familiar?) that was when we were together in City A. It had been going on for at least a month. Or worse, since the first day or first months.

I told him he was still lying to me and that I never wanted to hear from him again.

**Back to Abigail.**

The only excuse she could come up with was that she didn’t love me as much anymore. I asked why.  
Abigail: “Because of all the arguments.”  
Me: “What arguments?”  
Abigail: “Well, there’s always arguing, and you always say that if I’m not happy, you’ll leave.”

I said yes—and then what? You don’t love me the same way, you’re not happy, so why didn’t you say so?  
She didn’t know.

I started packing my things and managed to reach my cousin to come pick me up.

I yelled at her, called her everything imaginable. At first, she barely reacted; after about 30 minutes she started crying.

I went downstairs to keep packing. I saw our shelf with memories on it, took the small photo from the Halloween party and the wedding name card, and went into the garden to burn them.

She noticed, came out, saw it, and completely collapsed. She sobbed on the ground—real crying, not like before.

I left. Since then, once my father and I brought back her belongings.

I still talk to her a bit, mostly because Mia keeps messaging me, asking whether I can reach her. Abigail only replies to Mia about every second day, and even then barely. Supposedly she’s not willing to communicate with anyone. Mia went to a very far city on Monday (supposedly, but I heard about plans to her visiting relatives, but I’m not sure about anything anymore), so Abigail is alone at home.

Yesterday she posted stories like: *“I should have learned by now that the blade cuts.”*

Mia was worried all day about what if she hurts herself.

I messaged her in the evening, asking, “You’re not cutting yourself, right?” It was hard to figure out what it meant, but she could easily have hurt herself somewhere. I tried to encourage her. I know I shouldn’t—or rather, it shouldn’t be me. I should cut off all communication, but I’m terrified that if I do, she might actually do something terrible.

She supposedly talks to no one. She spoke with her brother the night after the breakup; I spoke with her then too. She said she couldn’t eat and wasn’t taking her heart medication. I decided someone had to be informed. Lacking anyone else, I told her brother. He completely lost it—he only then found out about her heart condition, yelled at her, and now apparently doesn’t talk to her anymore.

So she’s there alone. Mia is at the end of the world and will only return around the end of December. She’ll be alone at Christmas too. And on top of that, her grandfather—whom she adored and who partly raised her (along with her grandmother, since her father was an alcoholic nobody, and still is)—died at Christmas when she was younger.

She talks to no one.

And here’s my dilemma. Should I tell someone—maybe her kids father? They aren’t together and haven’t lived together for 2–3 years (oh yeah, I heard rumors that know seems more like facts, that they separated because she cheated on him, seems like a pattern…), but still, maybe he should know, or know what to do. But… What if he also loses it like her brother did, and then she can’t see the girls anymore?

I try to keep her going by reminding her that she’s a mother, that she has an important role, that she should think of her daughters, pull herself together, heal, and that the pain will slowly pass.

So yeah. If I tell someone, it might blow up. If I call emergency services and it turns out there’s no real danger, she might completely lose it and everything will be ruined anyway. If I tell no one and block her, what if that’s the final straw?

I don’t think my conscience could handle that—even if I technically have nothing to do with it anymore.

I understand that this isn’t my fault. They made their choices. This isn’t because of me. It’s not my responsibility. I should be focusing on healing, and instead I’m holding myself back.

But if something happens to her, and there are two little girls without a mother…

So this is where I am mentally right now.

  


**Conclusion**

**January 2026 – Update:**  
I no longer talk to her.  
People have since seen her going to work, Mia has returned home, so she seems to be okay.

**Where I am now:**  
I can’t forget. At least once a day it crosses my mind. In the mornings I wake up thinking about some part of the story, trying to piece together more details.

13 years I was thinking about her, not always, there were those big pauses. And I had one other girlfriend during the middle of these years, but still, 13 years, and at least half those years were about me thinking “what would have happened if I didn’t broke up with her?” Now I had the chance. I felt happy. Thing looked great… well mostly. A dream, a future, the “what if” that finally manifested…. All gone…. My partner…. My best friend…

I’ve talked about it with several friends; it helped a bit, but it’s still very painful.

Evelyn is still mad at me a bit, but we’re starting to make up. I had been to James for a few times now, so my old friendships are being repaired.

Logically, I know this relationship wouldn’t have worked long-term anyway. Based on the patterns she showed, she’s incapable of committing to one person for long. It couldn’t have ended differently. Still, the good moments were very good. I was happy. I felt I had a purpose, a future vision, a reason to move forward every day. Now I just feel like I’m drifting, waiting for something to happen.

Overall, she had a very positive effect on me. (I overheard my mom saying the same thing, one of her boys finally got a good girl, but know she knows about the whole thing so, not anymore.) I became much more diligent—like I mentioned before, I cleaned the apartment, kept the yard in order, did the grocery shopping, and if she cooked, I went to help her. Before that, I was much more sloppy, and now I’ve slipped back into that state again. I don’t live in filth, but I won’t dust or wash windows unless things already look really bad.

**What did I do wrong?**  
It’s a typical question. The first days were all about me blaming myself, not doing enough, being to protective, well at least in my mind, because I always let her go to do what she wanted, I never said she couldn’t go to somewhere. But maybe if I did, maybe then she would think twice about doing this? Probably no, she would only been more careful, and it would have lasted some more time, and even would have been way worse.

Now I think objectively, this wasn’t my fault. They chose to betray me, to stab me in the back, to laugh at me. I told her to communicate if there is something wrong, she did not. She chose to betray me, to use me, to use my best friend, whom she doesn’t talk to anymore. Well, that’s what both said to me, but people saw them talking at the café where she works so….

The lessons are clear: I need to learn to set boundaries. I need to learn to talk about my problems instead of burying them. I need to listen to my friends and to my own instincts, instead of blindly believing that “there must be an explanation.”

But this pain… The constant agony… I know the cliché saying “time will make it better”, and that’s probably true, and the only thing I can do. Wait. Never talk to her again. And try to never meet with her again ever.",0,1767387478.0,BreakUps,0,0.5,False

How do you know when to end things in a long-distance relationship?,"Hello! I am new to reddit so I hope I that I am using the correct details and community to share my predicament. Currently, I’m struggling with a breakup decision and could really use outside perspective.

I’ve been dating my girlfriend for about 10 months. About 8 of those months have been long distance. Overall, the relationship has been genuinely wonderful. She is kind, thoughtful, emotionally present, and has treated me better than I ever expected. I love her, and she has done nothing wrong in our relationship.

The problem is that the long distance has slowly made me realize I don’t feel that confident about our long-term compatibility anymore.

We’re currently living in different states. She still has about another year of school and an internship before we could realistically be in the same place again, and the expectation would be that she moves to where I live. When I imagine our future, I realize that I don’t feel excited anymore. I worry I’d feel responsible for making the move “worth it” for her, and I’m realizing that I may not want to keep pushing towards that future.

We have talked about our long-terms goals and  I realized that we are quite different in what we want in our future. I’m very career and stability oriented and plan carefully around finances, retirement, and future plans. She’s expressed that she imagines moving between jobs fairly frequently as she gets bored. There’s nothing wrong with that, but I’m realizing I might want more stability in a long-term partner than I thought I did. I feel like these differences should be manageable, but it's harder to reconcile when I imagine building a shared life.

What makes this situation a lot harder is timing. A few months ago, we bought very cheap plane tickets for her to visit me for a week in late January, which would also overlap with her birthday. At the time, I was trying to stay hopeful and take things “one day at a time.” Now I feel really conflicted about whether it’s fair to continue this trip knowing I’m having serious doubts.

A couple of days ago, she stopped by to visit me briefly for a few hours. We had a nice time getting coffee, going climbing, and exchanging Christmas gifts. She gave me incredibly thoughtful, personal gifts that made me feel so special. It was two CDs she put together herself with custom covers and carefully coordinated playlists. It was genuinely one of the most thoughtful gifts I’ve ever received. We also got physically close, if you know what I mean, and it reminded me how good things feel when we’re together. And yet, afterward, the same doubts remained. I still don’t feel as excited as I feel that I should about sustaining long distance for another year or confident about our future after that.

I feel so shitty because she’s been nothing but good to me. There’s no betrayal, no mistreatment, no big incident. I just feel like the relationship isn’t going anywhere I truly want it to go anymore, and that dragging it out would be unfair to both of us.

I’m at war with myself because part of me wonders if I’m giving up on something good, while another part of me feels like I already know this isn’t right for us long-term. I don’t want to hurt her, especially with the upcoming visit and her birthday, but I also don’t want to keep investing in a relationship I don’t believe in anymore.

I’m a dad looking to connect with other dads (or soon-to-be dads) in the area. I was thinking about organizing a casual monthly meetup where we could grab coffee, maybe hit up a park with the kids, or just hang out and talk about dad life, parenting wins and struggles, or whatever’s on our minds. We can also start by meeting over zoom as I think that might be easier. 

No agenda, no pressure - just a chance to build some community and maybe make some new friends who get what this whole parenting thing is like.

If you’re interested or have ideas for what would make this work best for you, drop a comment or shoot me a message. Would love to gauge interest and figure out what works for people’s schedules.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

When I run it without coffee I notice that there are uneven bursts of air coming through the pump. I already tried getting rid of any trapped air by running water through the steam wand, also in combination with the blind gasket. No improvement. The machine is heated up properly (running for over an hour!) and also flushed after fast heat-up. The same problem keeps on happening every time, even after 10+ times.

1q2abl2,https://i.redd.it/ikxz4wdr10bg1.png,FolderCrafter - Folder Structure Creator I Vibe Coded today,"I'm a freelance video editor doing 5-7 jobs per month. I always start with similar folder structures when working on a project, if it's a video near 15 folders, if it's a film then 20. Yesterday I needed to create 3 different project folders and collaborate with a teammate and then I thought, why not build a simple software for this in Antigravity?

So I googled a bit and found some python scripts that can do this job, found a couple of libraries for GUI (Tried flet first but couldn't manage to make it work so decided to tell Opus to use customtkinter) and told which features I want and how I want it to look. After a couple of hours, boom. What a great time!

And I made FolderCrafter. It's not only generating folder structures, you can also create folder structure templates, export them as json and send teammates/friends and import jsons. Who knows maybe some they there will be folder structure libraries for this app :)

P.S. Only on windows right now.

Problem is, every method of scaling either scales up the individual balls themselves, or if I parent the cloners with the dynamics tag to a null and try to scale that up it is just a horrible mess with both local and world axis. I also tried adding a plain effector and using the scale values there but no combination of options seems to do what I believe should be pretty simple. Any help? I just want to take these as they are and just scale it up, not the individual balls. Thanks!

Empty glass heard hitting hard atop of the kitchen table. ""Look kid, Everyone has been worried sick trying to find you."" 

Hard to tell just how much the boy understood the situation he was in. Busy trying to show off the scrunched up face he had spent much of the night practicing. Blank was the expression the boy now made at The Detective's question. To stare into those squinted eyes that had done well to mask what The Detective truly felt. Smiling had been the face of the plastic pumpkin that was now held to the detectives face. Forced to lean back in the chair he sat.

""Come on kid, Enough games."" Hand reached to take the bucket from the boy's hand. 

""Kid we need to know who gave you all this."" Quick had been the glance he took inside the bucket taken from between the boy's hands.

Left to stare down into a bucket of candy he didn't recognize. ""Kid. . . "" 

At first glance one could easily mistaken each individual paper and foil wrapped candy for the usual kind sold at the local mom and pop shop. Problem was none of it had been written in English. Whatever it had been, looked rather foreign. 

""Hey you ever see anything like this?"" The Detective having been calling to some one else in the room, reaching for one of these strange candy pieces. Thirty years without falling out of a chair, Only to have it happen twice in the same week. 

Sitting upon the chair still, even now as his back lay pressed against the kitchen floor. Left to stare up at that damn thing that now stare down at him from the edge of the Candy Basket. Within the muzzle it held the piece he had been reaching for. Swore the damn pup had just tried to take a few fingers with how high it had leapt, how loud this things jaws snapped. Least he wasn't the only one caught off guard. Damn near everyone in the room that had been looking his way jumped. All but the kid that had been offering the pup a half eaten slice of charred bread.

Wasn't too sure if it had been for the leaping pup, The loud slam of the chair hitting the floor, or that unspeakable string of words the detective unleashed. Either way everyone had been left speechless, and looking his way. Two officers quick to tip him back upright on the spot he'd been. ""Where you even learn such things."" One of the officers joked.

Strait faced had been The Detective that acted as if falling back had never happened. Finger left to point at the candy basket. ""Kid before you raise any more questions, How about answering a few first?"" 

His father's face had been quick to cut in, and follow that of his own, Kneeling down beside the boy as he often did, hand placed upon his shoulder. ""Son, we need you to tell us where you got the candy, It's very important you understand?"" 

The boy soon gave an answer, one they had not expected. ""Jack"" 

Heavy was the expression his father gave, One that looked as if it might break. Soft had been the sigh now given. ""Alright, Jack. . . All these nice men need to know where you went tonight, To be given this basket full of candy, and this stray puppy."" 

No matter who it had been that spent a few minutes trying to get answer from this boy, it always felt as if it had dragged on for hours. Least this time, It actually hadn't. ""Houses"" 

Something about this answer alarmed one of the officers that had been present. Maybe more, but he had been the only one that showed it. Quick to write something down upon a clipboard held beneath one arm. Quick had been this officer to speak. ""Which ones?"" 

How many eyes had been left to stare down upon the boy that felt as if he had been caught beneath the circle they made. Jack thinking long and hard, before he would finally speak, having been staring square in the eyes ""All"" 

Eyes left to turn, to look upon one another now as none seemed to know exactly what that answer meant. Didn't really make sense seeing how one in ten had anyone moved in, And those that had, had all been down either at the school, or local church. Most having missed the moment Jack spent fishing a orange flyer from his coat pocket, One shown to all those that had been watching, One quick to be taken by The Detective.



**|                           Candy?                            |**

**|                           Treats?                            |**

**|  Trick or Treat! , Right down the street! |**

**|                  Only On Halloween!                |**

  
Squinted had been those eyes that stared upon the paper. Left to stare upon it a moment, before flipping it over to look upon the back. He really didn't know what to make of all this. Handing it to one of the other officers. That look one gave when they had been lost in there own thoughts. Hat pulled from atop his head, to scratch at it a moment. Just what had been missing. Parent's getting ready to take him down to the school. Never made it to school. No one seen him since before turning up on the doorstep just passed 3 am. Let his emotion get the best of him. Needed to clear his mind, try to think. Damnit Jack, Think.

Reaching for the lighter within his pocket, he felt something else brush across his fingers. Partially crumpled had been a neatly folded piece of orange paper. One he had taken from the boy that had been following him around with the better part of the week. Had been the same orange flyer that had been hanging about the school. Just what had been said for The Detective to pull the cigar from between his lips, to tuck it away. ""Where did you get this kid?""

""School"" had been Jack's answer. Now being shown the other flyer. ""This one?"" The officer asked

""School"" had been Jack's answer. Other officers quick to catch on to just what The Detective had been thinking, whispering a few things to one another, before heading off and out the door. The one that had been in charge giving a tip of his hat. ""We'll see you down at the station"" 

""Ya ya"" Dismissive had been the wave The Detective gave. ""Just make sure to have a fresh pot of coffee waiting."" 

No matter how many times, how many ways The Detective had asked, the answers had always been the same. Swear he'd shoot the next rooster he heard on his way to the station. Hard to tell how much of what had been in his cup had been month old coffee, or whiskey. Left to stare at the five pound slab that had been the only recognizable thing amongst the bunch. The only thing written in English. 

""Who gives a kid a her"" creaking of a chair drowned out part of the word the moment he leaned back in his chair. ""bar this size."" 

This case looked to have stirred up the hornets nest. Couldn't remember the last time he saw everyone in at the same time. Having to call in some one from out of town to try and make sense of this language. Makes him wonder if some remnant of the war decided to lay low in town. Only thing that even half way made any damn sense, with those spooks sniffing around. Just how long till they find some one to fill his shoes.

Downing the mug, The detective tossed the orange flyer upon the desk, was time he tried to get some rest.

# Chapter 1

Anabella

 

The hum of fluorescent lights and the clack of keyboards are as familiar to me as my own heartbeat. The WPD bullpen is chaos at its usual volume—phones ringing, radios buzzing, a low thrum of tension always simmering under the surface.

I take a sip of my lukewarm coffee and scan the latest report on my tablet, trying not to think about the text my sister, Isabella, sent this morning—*There’s a math test today. I might die.*

“Kid problems?” Detective Wesley Logan asks, sidling up next to my desk with that unreadable expression he wore like a second badge.

I glance up at him, arching a brow. “Twelve-year-old drama. You’d think she was prepping for the bar exam.”

Logan smirks. “You’re doing alright, Gomez. Better than alright, actually.”

I don’t know how to respond to that, so I shrug and leaned back in my chair. “What’s the latest?”

“Stalking case. Cyber angle. Reilly is pulling files now. It’s personal for him. His woman.” He says pointedly.

I am halfway through my second cup of gas station coffee when Detective Griffin Reilly drops a file on my desk like it owed him money.

“Morning to you too, Detective,” I say, glancing up.

He looks tired—more than usual—and his jaw is tight, like he hasn’t slept in a while. “You got a second?”

I nod. Logan follows close behind, sliding into the chair across from me and tossing a granola bar onto my keyboard like it’s some kind of peace offering.

“What's this?” I ask.

“Breakfast,” Logan says. “You forget to eat when you're stressed.”

“I'm always stressed,” I mutter, but I unwrap it anyway.

Reilly leans forward, elbows on his knees, and when he finally looks at me, it’s like something shifts. Not cop-to-cop. Not quite friend-to-friend, either. Something in between.

“I need your help, Gomez.”

Those words alone are enough to make me sit up straighter. “Okay…”

“It’s about a case,” he says. “But it’s personal. Real personal.”

He opens the folder, flipping to a photo of a woman—pretty brunette, big amber eyes, soft smile. I recognized her. Not by name, but in that way where your brain goes, *I know her from somewhere*.

“Genevieve Beaumont,” Reilly says. “Everyone calls her Evie. She’s been getting cyber stalked—messages, account hacks, real-time pings to her social media, deleted emails. It’s escalating.”

“Jesus,” I mutter, eyes scanning the details. “Has he made physical contact?”

His jaw clenches and he grits, “Possibly.”

I raise an eyebrow in confusion. “We suspect that he’s the same asshole from a few months ago but he’s getting bolder,” Logan cut in. “He’s ‘bumped into her’ at First Bites.”

Griffin doesn’t say anything for a moment, and I can see it on his face—this is someone he cares about. Deeply.

“He fucked up,” he growls. “He messaged her directly. But we can’t draw him out unless we give him something to bite on. A target that looks like her, moves like her… someone he’ll believe is her, from a distance.”

Then it clicked.

“You want me to be bait.”

Reilly nods. “You match her build. Same hair, similar features. If we keep you to the right lighting and angles, it’ll work. He’s careful, but he’s obsessed. If we stage it right—he’ll come to you.”

I stare at the photo again, this time seeing something else. The vulnerability in her eyes. I thought about my little sister, Isabella. Twelve, smart-mouthed, too brave for her own good. If someone ever watched her like that, hunted her in the shadows… I’d burn the world down.

“I’m in,” I say before they could ask again. “Whatever you need. Just tell me when and where.”

Reilly lets out a breath he’d clearly been holding. “Thank you. We’re meeting tomorrow at the S3 warehouse. I’ll shoot you the address.”

“How is S3 involved?” I ask.

“S3 caught this first and reached out. Kenya, Saint’s woman, was the original target—so we thought.” He explains as he clenches his fists.

I nod as Logan stands, clapping his hands together. “Alright, Gomez. Time to play decoy. Hope you’ve been practicing your damsel-in-distress face.”

I smirked. “Oh, sweetheart. I’ve been surviving PTA meetings and tweentage breakdowns. I *am* the damsel in distress.”

Logan laughed—only a slight grin from Reilly—but the weight of what I’ve agreed to settles deep in my gut.

Let him come.

I’m not afraid of being watched. But he should be afraid of watching me.

I show up at the address at 0550 after a long night studying everything I knew about Evie—in a cardigan, pencil skirt, and flats, as instructed.

Someone buzzes me in as I reach for the door. I step into the building with its industrial décor, all wood, metal, and glass and walk towards the muffled voices in the back. The volume increases as I walk into the room.

My spine goes ramrod straight when I see him.

“Morning,” I say. It comes out sharper than I intend.

“Officer Gomez,” he replies, with a nod. “Rome Torres. Appreciate you doing this. Evie is family.” He grunts yet the impact is like a caress. *Holy hell.*

I nod, or at least I think I do, then settle on the bench as we run her through the final checks.

“Are you sure about this?” I turn at the question from Reilly.

I lift a brow at him, though my eyes flick briefly toward *him*. “He’s a predator who thinks women are soft targets. That pisses me off. So yeah, I’m sure.”

They continue running through the op.

“We close in,” Logan finishes. “Fast and clean.”

“I’ll have eyes on you every second” he says, and something in the way he says it makes my pulse increase.

Wager Amount: 1U to WIN 1.7U

League: Orlando Magic vs Chicago Bulls (7PM CST)

**Recap**: Mavs looked good from the jump but trail pretty much the entire game after the hot start. They just could not close the distance. Definitely was not my best bet, certainly was not the best value bet either.

**Matchup:** Magic should win this game despite missing Franz Wagner. They handily beat the Bulls on their last matchup and they are missing two key playmakers in Coby White and Josh Giddey. I think Bulls make this competitive but I still think Magic will be too much firepower for them to handle.

**The Play & Prediction :** 1U on Bulls ML. No prediction on this one as well!

Normally I wouldn't care so much but some days ago I was talking to some friends who were reminiscing being bullied all their lives. Been particularly upset about that and the severity of these kinds of things since then and now this happens.

Some of my closest friends and family members were bullied, one was almost killed by their bullies and it was a miracle he survived. In school, I hung out with some special needs children who would obliviously talk about being bullied by their entire classes and I have nieces and nephews who tell me the same thing happens to these kinds of kids in his school.

She’s one of those people who remembers the tiny stuff, like your coffee order and the name of your dumb childhood dog. She’s always been good to me, and I’m the type who loves people but also gets weirdly panicky about plans. This year was rough for me mentally, not in a dramatic way, just constant low grade dread. When Maya texted our little group chat a week before her birthday like ""hey lets do a quick dinner on Friday, nothing big"" my stomach dropped. I didn’t want to go. Not because of her, not because I hate birthdays. I just didn’t want to do the whole thing, sit there, be ""on"", talk, smile, pretend I’m fine, then drive home exhausted and mad at myself. So when the day came I saw the reminder on my phone at 9:03am, and I just stared at it. I could have texted happy birthday in 5 seconds. Instead I swiped it away. I told myself I’d do it later. Then later came and I still didn’t want the follow up ""are you free tonight?"" So I did the grossest thing, I acted like I forgot. I even did this little performance in my head, like oh nooo I’m so scatterbrained. Maya posted a photo of a cupcake someone brought her at work, and I left it on read. The next day she messaged me ""you alive?"" and I replied something dumb like ""lol barely, my week is chaos"" and still didn’t say it. Three days after her birthday I finally sent ""OMG I’m the worst, HAPPY BDAY!!"" with too many exclamation points, like that would cover it. She replied ""thanks :)"" and nothing else. That little smiley face felt like being slapped. Now I keep replaying it, how obvious it probably was. This is a person who would notice I didn’t say it, then she probably told herself I was busy, then she realized I was active online anyway. I basically made her feel unimportant because I didn’t want to be mildly uncomfortable for two hours. The stupid part is, I still ended up anxious, just in a slower , uglier way. I’ve been avoiding her since, because if she brings it up I’ll have to admit why. I dont even know how to say, ""I used your birthday as a shield for my avoidance"". I hate that I did it, and I hate that I’m still trying to protect myself by staying quiet. I keep thinking I should just call and apologize without excuses, but I’m scared she’ll laugh like ""wow ok"" or worse, be polite and distant forever. Either way I earned it.

1q29yhs,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofattraction/comments/1q29yhs/a_manifestation_experience_i_had_years_ago_trying/,A manifestation experience I had years ago trying to understand how it worked and how to reach that state again,"Hi everyone,

I’d like to share a personal experience related to the Law of Attraction and ask for advice from more experienced people here.
A few years ago, I was working in a very crowded office. I’m a bit introverted and don’t really enjoy crowded environments. At that time, my girlfriend introduced me to manifestation concepts like visualization and imagining.
During that period, I didn’t consciously try to change my job, but I kept imagining a different workplace without really noticing it. Let me explain my method back then:
I’m a smoker, and every morning around 9:00–9:30 I would go out for a coffee and cigarette break. During that time, I wouldn’t say any affirmations out loud. I would just casually imagine myself working at another place.
In real life, my workday started at 8:00, but in my imagination, I was starting at 8:30. I imagined a small workplace with very few people, and I imagined it being close to my home.
Normally, I find jobs by applying online, and the process usually takes at least a week. But this time, I didn’t apply anywhere at all. One day, I randomly received a phone call. They were looking for a third person for a 3-person team, very close to my home, with a starting time of 8:30.
I went to the interview and was hired immediately. I’ve been working at the same place for 3 years now.
After that, I broke up with my girlfriend. I’m still at the same job, but financially I’m not doing very well.

My questions are,
How do you think this happened?
Why did it work so naturally back then?
How can I reach that same “frequency” again?
This time, my main goal is to earn more money. I’m also curious about manifestation related to money or even luckbased things like lottery (I know this can be controversial).
Since then, I’ve tried manifesting intentionally and doing visualization again, but it hasn’t worked the same way.
I’d really appreciate your thoughts, experiences, or any advice.
Thanks 🙏",1,1767386438.0,lawofattraction,2,0.67,False

I also will say I’ll probably be all over the place in this, my mind is not in a good spot right now. Some of it might be irrelevant.

After my father died(When I was 10) in 1993, it was just me and my mother she decided when I was 13/14 to move us to Alabama. It was there were and she met a Canadian on AOL. He flew down, and 24 hours later proposed to her at my baseball game, 3 months later we moved to Canada.

I can’t and wont say anything negative about my Stepfather. He’s always treated and loved me as his own and is one of the Kindest and smartest people I’ve ever met. Him and I don’t agree on a lot outside of Sports but I respect and love him regardless.

My mother is a different story.

They are both very religious(Catholic) and it is the centre of their lives and marriage. Growing up in this household was rough on me because of this. I hated going to Mass and didn’t agree with Catholicism at all but any time I questioned it, I was punished. They ranged from being banned from using the internet for a year, to confiscating CDs that they thought were “too vulgar”.

I’ve always struggled with School. I flunked out College at 21, and moved back home. I got a job in a grocery store and was promoted fast. I didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life, but knew I couldn’t stay there anymore. I moved out and kept on working. Still trying to think about what to do with my life.

I got married when I was 24. She was a single mom to a one year old(No dad in the picture) and worked in a coffee shop. After about 5 years, and one child of our own. I find out she had been cheating on me for the last year of our marriage. I confronted her, told her I’d forgive her if she would go to marriage counseling but she refused and told me to leave. I did reluctantly only because I had thought maybe if I did what she wanted, maybe she’d come to her senses. The only apartment I could afford was in the “Ghetto” part of the city.I ended up losing a lot. I was paying her alimony + child support. My health and finances took a huge toll.

Sure, I dated but when most of my money was going to her, my rent and what little food I could afford. It wasn’t the easiest thing to do.

Two suicide attempts later.

I ended up meeting this girl, we got along great and my depression started to get better. She asked me to move in with her and I agreed. My finances were starting to improve as well as my health. I was eating better and taking better care of myself. Paying off debt(that my ex wife and run up when we were together that was in my name) . She got pregnant but had an abortion behind my back and told me she miscarried. While I am not mad at her about the abortion, I am about the fact she just wasn’t honest with me about it. That caused the break up. This was in 2020 at the height of covid.

The whole situation caused my depression to come back. When I got into my own apartment, I was struggling to get by. It seemed every time things started going well, something bad happened. I had really bad dental issues, root canals failing and having to have those teeth yanked. My debt got worse as I was borrowing from A to pay B and then borrowing from C to pay A and borrowing from D to buy food. Stuck in payday cycles, credit card debt. Losing my teeth. I was at my wits end. I ended up calling my mother and broke down(who had moved back to the states with my stepfather and half brother 11 years prior) . Told her I couldn’t do it anymore and I had no clue what to do.

They(mom and stepdad) called me the next day and offered me an out. They’d pay off my debt and pay for my teeth and help me pay for trade school, IF I moved back to the States. I agreed only because I knew with my job I couldn’t afford a job in the rental market.

I sat my daughter down(who was 12 almost 13) at the time and was brutally honest to her about my situation. She understood but was upset that I had to leave. I’m crying as I write this just thinking about being away from her. While I’ve been up twice since I left(2023) for a week each time. I still miss her despite us talking every day.

Trade school didn’t work out for me, due to my NF causing issues with me not being able to hold tools steadily enough. So I’m back to working in a grocery store. I’ve been promoted pretty quickly at this location and make ok money doing it. But still I find it soul crushing and depressing.

I pay my folks back around 40% of my monthly income as I am still in the hole to them about 26k. Because of my past poor financial choices and them bailing me out part of the agreement was me having to send them screenshots of my bank balances(just the balance) and credit karma to show I am making progress and not falling into old “habits” I resent this greatly and wish they understood that while I know the decisions I made that got me into this best were bad, I was doing it out of survival.

I’m mentally tired, I’m lonely, I have 0 friends. I’m madly in love with a woman(probably my only friend left actually) whom Ive known for 30 years and she lives in another state from me

I don’t know what to do and I feel like my dark suicidal thoughts are coming back. These meds aren’t helping, therapy only makes things worse I feel.

1q29u0x,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_NewNeptuneSaturn/comments/1q29u0x/new/,New,"Alright. Leaving behind the other stories/dynamics and focusing on New. 

New story is just a few scenes so far. It’s different though. She watches me but not the way the others do. This is different. It feels different. 

The way she watches me is different from the others in the sense that she’s not longing and playing games like the others. It’s not a push pull dynamic. It’s not high/low. She’s content on her own, she’s watching to make sure I’m ok but she has boundaries. She’s not pulled into my grief and intensity. She’s not overwhelmed or repelled by my intensity either. She has a pretty good read on me, and I find her realism and grounded presence soothing. 

She can hold and ground my depth and I’ve never felt that before. She’s not phased either way. This part of me is new to me too. The old me, old dynamics are gone. I’m getting used to a new energy and way of being. Maybe I’ve always been this deep and intense? Either way, this is who I am now. The old me, the detached self-sacrificing responsible one is gone. I’m much more in touch with my feelings and my Scorpio energy. 

We see each other on and off in the coffee shop. We don’t talk much. She’s always working on her computer, she just kind of glances up every now and then to check in and make sure I’m doing ok. I am. Slow and steady, I’m finally where I need to be. 

She didn’t rescue me. That’s for the best. She likes me though and I don’t understand why. 

I like watching her work at the coffee shop. She’s serious about whatever she’s working on.  I obviously only see her a few minutes at a time here and there. It’s not like we know each other. We just *see* each other. 

She’s not my usual type. She’s not hyper or reactive. She doesn’t need attention. She’s not immature. She doesn’t need to be rescued. She’s calm, composed, grounded, extremely kind towards everyone but she also commands respect effortlessly. 

Once I find my balance and I’m not so needy things shift between us. We start talking a bit. She invites me over for dinner. 

I like being around her. She’s capable and I feel safe. She’s a lot smarter and more grounded in reality than I am. The truth is I need someone realistic like that. Obviously I need to integrate that for myself but certain personality traits and temperaments are fixed. I’m not good with spreadsheets and conference calls. I’m not great at the reality of running a business, she is. She’s an extremely competent leader. I like that. I’ve been masking my whole life trying to be like that or who my family wants me to be. I’m not that person. I’m emotional, spiritual, family oriented, and I feel things deeply. 

We make dinner together and I like that she hasn’t sexualized me at all. Obviously there’s attraction but she leads with gentleness and helpfulness. That feels good. 

She doesn’t reject my feeling function, she holds space for it. Not rescuing or making it her problem…she just understands that’s part of me. I’m allowed to be me. 

I can’t quite figure her out, and maybe I’m trying to hard to understand her out of a need to control or challenge her. She’s so rooted she’s unphased by it. I stop trying so hard and start surrender a bit. That’s what I want, isn’t it?

After a few dates, we’re making food at her place again and she walks over and wraps her arms around me. I feel a lot. She doesn’t react, she just stays warm and safe. I melt more and more and let my defenses down. This person is safe to let close. 

She’s always known what I needed, now is the time it’s safe to actually have that between us. I’ve always dated/rescued emotionally unstable women, or with my ex the withholder who was unstable underneath the cold detachment. My ex could never and would never hold me like this. I’ve always needed this. I’m not the intellectual anymore, and tbf that was a response to childhood. I had to be the strong detached one. I’m not detached, I do it to protect myself. I don’t have to do that here. With her, I’m allowed to be the feeler. I’m allowed to reach for connection and safety. I’m allowed to desire her intellectualism and stability. It’s not a performance-this is who she is and I’m finally allowed to be who I really am. I need someone practical, grounded and realistic. I have that too but it’s come at the expense of my whole self. With her, I’m allowed to be whole. My feelings matter. It’s safe to be the feeler. 

I can’t control her at all. I don’t need to. She chose to be here. She chose to hold me. I’ve never had to chase or long for her. She’s clear and honest, warm and practical. I love her touch. It’s not kink, it’s home. She’s smart, warm, steady, real and I trust her. She doesn’t play games. 

I don’t know what sex is going to be like with her. Different than before. Probably because this might be real love and I’ve never slept with someone that way before. Not as the person I am now, not from this authentic of a depth. This might actually be safe surrender. 

She’s not trying to control me. We’re not in polarity. Just presence and soft kindness. She’s making space for me to feel safe and loved. The more we date the safer I feel, the more attracted I am. Is this what I’ve always needed but didn’t know I needed?

The safer I feel the more courage I have to love her, and then I understand what she likes about me. It’s not something I have to fake or worry about…it’s who i am and how i love when i let someone close. She can have that because she’s worthy. I’ll give it to her all day. It’s not sex, it’s love. I’ve never been more myself. This is *right*. Finally. 

She saw the part of me I hide and protect the most, even from myself, and she waited for me to be ready. 

(Obviously free writing this as I go. Unplanned just letting my mind tell me.) 

This person doesn’t exist. At least not yet. I don’t go to coffee shops I pick up my mobile order or make it at home lol. No one is watching me. But at least I have an idea of what kind of dynamic shift I actually need.

I test little kitchen motors pretty regularly, and this one sits in that not-cheap-but-not-premium price tier where a lot of competitors cut corners on attachments or speed control.

Motor power and performance is the main selling point here: that 500W motor actually has torque. Blending efficiency is legit for an immersion blender, but it can also get you in trouble fast. A smoothie test in a tall cup had ingredients climbing the sides and wanting to fling out until I learned to start deeper in the mix and feather the button. Speed control range is decent with the multiple speeds plus turbo, although the lowest speed still feels a bit too fast for delicate stuff like folding in powders or starting a mayonnaise. Turbo is basically “commitment mode.”

Attachment quality is better than I expected at this price. The blending shaft locks in firmly and the stainless steel blade end feels solid. The whisk and milk frother are useful add-ons, not just filler, and whisk and frothing results were strong: quick whipped cream in a mason jar, and the frother handled coffee powders that normally clump. Soup and smoothie results were smooth for butternut squash and potato soup, and it chewed through beans for refried-style puree without whining.

Ease of use is good with simple push-button controls, though handling and ergonomics depend on your wrist. Build and materials lean sturdy, but it is a little heavy, and long blending sessions in a big pot can fatigue you. Noise level is typical high-RPM stick blender loud, not ear-splitting, still not exactly quiet.

Cleaning and maintenance is one of the better parts. Detachable attachment design means the shaft rinses fast and doesn’t have a ton of nooks. Dishwasher compatibility seems fine for the attachments per user experience, while the motor body just gets wiped down. Cord length and storage were fine in my kitchen, long enough to reach across the counter, but there’s no fancy cord wrap, so it ends up coiled in a drawer.

Safety features include a safety lock setup and the general benefit of a covered blade area, though suction can “grab” the bottom of a cup if you pin it too low. Durability over time looks promising based on long-term heavy use reports, but I also saw a note about tearing the rubber pot protector if it’s installed wrong, so yeah, read the instructions even if you hate doing that.

Customer support experience seems unusually responsive for a small appliance brand, with quick replacement parts reported. Value for money feels strong versus pricier immersion blenders that don’t include a whisk and milk frother, though the too-fast low speed is a real annoyance.

Anybody else used this long-term for daily soups or smoothies, or had the attachments wear out? Curious what broke first, if anything.",1,1767385998.0,KitchenStack,0,1.0,False

Her head leaned against the window, feeling vibrations emanating from the train, getting lost in the clutter of its countless wheels. Ah, so many uncertainties, so many doubts. She felt the weight of her family’s issues on her shoulders, even if only partially.*

*“Maybe it’s not going to be that bad?” She thought to herself, glancing for a moment at an old suitcase she placed beside herself. “But when will I get to see them again? In months?” A sigh followed, a futile attempt at dispersing worries. Soon enough her new life would begin, yet what will it bring?*

**Greetings, everyone!**

*₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚*

Hope you're all doing amazing! 
I am aware that the sample above does not tell much about the actual plot, yet I wished to include it as an example of my writing (I can write more, depending on the situation in the roleplay itself ;).

But Frog, you may ask, what is this roleplay even about? Well, let me tell you:
Zofia, a 19 year old daughter of a financially-struggling family, is sent to work as a maid in a noble household, somewhere distant. My main goal for this roleplay is to explore how her new life would look like, everyday chores and challenges that her occupation brings, relations between her coworkers (both camaraderie and conflict) and other members of the household as well as perhaps events happening in the town they’d live in. It's a simple premise, but one that gives us so many possibilities! I'd love to hear your ideas as well ^^

A bunch of extra details:
- *Please know that even though I am looking for someone to GM this story, I’ll contribute as much as you wish. Be it brainstorming, playing some side characters, you name it. As someone who knows how it is to GM, I wish for you to enjoy the roleplay as well (＾-＾)*
- *While this roleplay is meant to be wholesome and cozy, there will be some more somber tones from time to time.*
- *Brainstorming and worldbuilding! Whether we decide to place it in our real world Victorian era, or perhaps a fictional setting, I’d appreciate it if we dedicated some time to setting up the plot, adjusting it and tailoring to our wants, deciding on the core themes as well as worldbuilding (the household, for example).*
- I’d love to capture the aesthetics of manga/anime, even with the ways we’d write our roleplay. Some exaggeration, tropes and so one are very welcome :D
- *I am open to romance, although only between two women ^^” I don’t mind it being a sizable part of our story, however, I don’t want it to overshadow everything else, nor feel rushed.*

(I'd also be open to a similar roleplay inspired by ""Bride's story"" :3)

*₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚*

**About me:**

*₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚*

Why hello! I shall introduce myself a bit, so that you also know who you’re dealing with. You may call me Frog. I’m a passionate, 18+ roleplayer from CET/GMT +1 timezone. However, I do not think those pose any obstacle in terms of writing, so don’t be deterred by that even if you’re from a completely different part of our space-roaming disc silly autocorrect, I meant globe :P. Besides that, I don’t have much to share about me, I reckon. I love cats though, that’s worth a mention!

The [X4Y] tag does reflect the gender of my characters, not my own. I prefer not sharing it. I hope you’ll understand <3

₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚

**About you:**

₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚

Here you’ll find a few requirements, so that we are sure we match.
- *Be 18+. Do not tell me your exact age or real gender, just confirm if you are 18+*
- *Be literate. I love writing, especially descriptions, which I find to greatly enhance the storytelling. I usually provide around 2-4 paragraphs per response and would ask for my partner to be able to match that. However, I’ve recently been hoping to try a short-length approach for conversations to make them more dynamic ^^* 
- *Be creative! Cheesy, I know, but hey, I don’t want to be the only one coming up with the ideas. This premise has so much potential for unique and intriguing tales, let’s brainstorm them together!*
- *Be excited! Yeah, another cheesy one. Yet, I find it so fun to see an enthusiastic reply!*

*₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚*

Anyway, that is all from me, I believe. If you are interested, perhaps have some questions, feel free to poke your head in my DMs! Hopefully hear from you soon!",0,1767385913.0,RoleplayPartnerSearch,0,0.33,False

With the help of some friends, I built the below itinerary for me, my partner and some of our close friends as we're going to Colombia on a holiday around the time of my 30th birthday.

Getting to Bogota, Medellin, Ciudad Perdida hike and Cartagena are a must i think - but we want to get into nature/culture/coffee region + maybe visit the Casa en el Agua hostel as well as a friend from there went and said we'd love it.

Any parts you'd avoid or recommend skipping/replacing? Bogotá is a must for the start/end because of flights or else direct from Cartagena on the way home maybe if possible! Is Cartagena fun for a birthday night out or better to be somewhere else like Medellín or Palomino? Is it way too busy what's worth cutting?

I put in Palomino and Tayrona National Park as one section. No idea which to do

We're planning it all on a budget so it'd be backpacking hostels etc

1q29odo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1q29odo/what_in_the_actual_fk/,What in the actual f**k,"All of you thank your lucky stars you didn’t have to live thru anything CLOSE to what I have lived over the last 9 days. I wish this upon no one…..

Fiancee (engaged last month) woke up last Monday, on what looked like deaths door. I called EMS to help by 8:00 am, decided it wasn’t the day to work at that point even tho I had work all week. Well, she’s wayyy sicker than anyone could have imagined. I spent 4 hours in a local ER with no resources, they finally transferred her down by ambulance to the ICU in the big city 50 miles away. Since Monday her parents and I have been with her every day as much as possible. I have been staying at their house, as they live about 10 minutes from the hospital she is in. I’m already also basically out of my job as they didn’t really accept my leave of absence and just expected me back immediately. I told them, our new life is in this new city. She needs better medical care and that is here.

We got answers the 2nd day. Hapatarenal failure, kidney and liver failure caused by alcohol. She’s in….bad shape. She has every complication involved with the disease and she has them all in a bad way. Her scores are almost off the charts (in a bad way) and she would go straight to the top of the liver transplant list due to having MELD scores so high and being at such risk of death.

We didn’t get much communication from her from last Tuesday to Friday, as when the liver fails it releases ammonia into the brain causing confusion, disorientation and complete brain fog. Friday we got the transfer we wanted to a hospital with a better liver team and a transplant team. Saturday and Sunday, she came alive. Talking, eating, feeling better and coherent even tho we still have a long road ahead.

Then came 8:00 am Monday. I’m always there first thing so I stopped to grab a coffee, chatted with a nice lady about how my 31 year old fiancée was in the ICU and things weren’t great. 10 seconds later, I turn a corner just to see 2 nurses SPRINTING toward ICU, I said “no no no” and I started after them with my full cup of coffee, they turned again, toward my fiancées room. I sped up again, turned the corner and saw about 8-10 nurses in her room with the bell dinging. I ran inside and said “WTF is going on?!?”  “Oh, her heart stopped we are having to do CPR” and they guided me out of the room quickly. 15 minutes later that had her intubated and stable enough.

I spent all day with her today 8:00 am to 9:30 pm actually. Her tests were looking better today, they believe we can take the ventilator off tomorrow. She also had a friend visit, who has been taking care of our place and has been bringing down some of the items we need from our house.

Well, I go back to my fiancées parents house tonight after being with her all day and her mom absolutely loses her complete fucking shit on me. I have NEVER seen a grown adult have a tantrum like this. They “like their space” and now I’m invading it, even tho they offered and their daughter is fucking close to death. They don’t spend half the time I do at the ICU and her mom “has to leave by 4:00 pm because she won’t drive in the dark” 😐😐

And she was pissed tonight that I stayed past the 8:00 pm hours, even tho that’s just on the nurses discretion and because I didn’t tell her about a “breathing test” they did on her at the end of the night, even tho it was minor and I told her about it as soon as I got home, plus we all knew about it from the doctors during the day.

She blamed me for EVERYTHING finally. “Why didn’t you do more!?!” “You live with her, why didn’t you save her?!?” “She shouldn’t be with you”

The drinking problem isn’t because of me. I only drink a couple of beers here and there. I have minimal influence on her drinking, we never “party” and we’ve maybe only been drunk together once or twice in 2 years. She’s hides the majority of the drinking from me. I have even encouraged her to drink less and to go to the doctor preemptively. She has other people she drinks with and we’ve only been together 2 years. This liver failure has been a long time coming.

And about 3 years ago she went to drug/alcohol rehab and 1 month after she completed it, her parents were giving her alcohol. 😐😐😐

They act like I’m stepping all over their toes, their life and their daughter. Her mother accused me of not giving a shit about her daughter and went so far to say that she doesn’t want me at the hospital anymore. Even tho she had actually caused a bunch of shit for the nurses and a couple have already mentioned something about her to me.

So I may never see my fiancée again because her mother decided while she is dying in the ICU that I’m not good enough for her now and this is all my fault specifically.

I’m going to try to wrap it up. But any guidance or advice is appreciated.

UPDATE:

I went into the room this morning while the parents were in there. Asked if we could have a rationale discussion. Her Mom immediately flipped out and started yelling in the ICU. Her dad physically got in my face and is telling me I can’t ever see her again. No social workers here to help at all, chaplains can’t do anything either.

UPDATE 2: The mother and fathers rage continues into day 3. Literal, psychotic rage, the look in the eyes of these 2 is straight out of hell. ANY comment, ANY apology is met with instant visceral disgust on their face followed by some snide comment that’s out of context. I contacted security right when I got to the hospital and had them walk up with me, also brought one of my fiancées best friends to be witness. I attempted to make an apology, in front of my now conscious and extubated fiancee with 2 nurses in the room. The father refused to look at me and the mother walked out of the room in a rage before I could finish the apology. Their main issue…..I was staying at their house. Again, they offered…during a changing and difficult time. I never stayed more than 2 nights in a row. Never left a mess or made noise. Went to bed early, got up early. Why am I not surprised that 2 asshole boomers can’t live with a millennial for even a modest 3 days during a full on crisis? 😂

we agreed on splitting the day in half so we can all see her and avoid each other. But that took a gargantuan effort from the nursing staff, the doctor in unit, charge nurse, security, and the chaplain. They also came within seconds, and told me so, that one more outburst from the mother and they were going to remove her from the building permanently.

UPDATE 3: day 4, their absolutely vitriol and rage continue. half days have started. These 2 jackass parents are even more pissed off now (if that’s possible) because now I have confirmed hours I can be here and they can’t. When they just wanted me to be gone and out of here altogether. Actually a hilarious backfire on their part 😂

Well….you stupid fucking idiots….if you wouldn’t have started ALL this shit for no reason whatsoever, it wouldn’t have come to this and we could all still be in the room peacefully during any hours we want. The nursing staff told me today too, that if her mother had had one more outburst in the middle of the ICU yesterday around other patients, staff and families, security would be escorting her out of the building permanently. They also said if she has one more outburst at any point going forward, permanently banned from the building.

Fiancée is doing better I would say. Unfortunately we had to start dialysis today :( but her mental status and her being able to communicate with us is the best it’s been. We’ve gotten answers from her, we’ve told her some of the things that transpired to get us here, she’s pretty upset with the way that her mother is acting because she’ll even yell and rage right next to her ICU bed. So she’s heard all of it.

I’m also at the point where I’m somewhat worried about my safety now. Her father has told stories where he had intention of going and killing one of her ex-boyfriends with his gun. He went so far as to fly from Colorado to Maryland on a moments notice to do so. And as told by him, he just couldn’t track the guy down when he got to the east coast so it never happened.",0,1767385783.0,Advice,0,0.5,False

Soo I’m pretty positive (no diagnosis, just a hunch based off symptoms) that I have GERD stemming from my caffeine addiction, diet, and stress. (Symptoms include chest pain, either on the right or left side or both, burning throat, cough, hoarseness).

I’ve honestly given up on managing my stress as a high school student but I want to try putting down the caffeinated drinks, which I honestly find just as impossible.

It’s so, so incredibly hard not to drink caffeine. I’ve tried so hard to stop and my longest streak just barely hits a day. I actually cannot function as a normal human being without it, especially as a distraction from all of the anxiety that school puts on me.

The symptoms are getting worse and more frequent and happen even when I don’t eat or drink anything. 

I’m a rather frequent public speaker so I’m paranoid that I’ll wake up one day to a doctor’s appointment in which I am told that I will never speak normally again because of this.

The bog standard response is to make sure you start closing ***towards*** the end of the shift and not after. 

But. In many shops, there’s queues till closing time. 

AND your closing partner is likely to be a supervisor/manager. 

They + You would need to;

\- Close the till

\- Count the stock and stales

\- Restock the fridge

\- Prepare TooGoodToGo bags

\- Close the coffee machines and ovens

\- Empty the coffee pods

\- Unload the gates from the driver

\- Bake cookies for next shift

\- Wipe all surfaces

\- Wash & Wipe all utensils

\- Wash & Wipe all trays

\- Change the bin bags 

\- Sweep and mop the front and back

\- Bag all stales

\- Take out all bin bags

\- Close the shop

All. In. 30 minutes. 

If you’re unlucky and the supervisor takes long closing the till + counting stock, or the driver comes late, you do all of these by yourself. 

One could be forgiven for thinking its an intentional way to get you working for free?

Is this not crazy?? Am I blowing things out of proportion?

Is there a body that can look into this?

Since its pretty much the same thing just smaller particles, i was trying to figure out if i could use my stone pestal and mortar to grind it up since i dont own a food processor (i do this all the time with coffee beans, turning granulated sugar to powdered instead of buying it, litterally anytime i need to grind something up, im thinking that i can apply the same thing here) till the texture looks the same. Im assuming i may need to dry it out again since im grinding up the fibers, therefore its likely going to release oils, and if thats the case strain it with cheesecloth (or dont for xyz reason?) And put it on a cookie sheet with parchment paper, set the oven to 200°F (93-94°C i think) and check it every 20 minutes till its a golden color? Any advice given would be great, even if it turns out i must buy a food processor or abandon this endeavor completely and just order the dessicated coconut😅

Coconut Truffle recipie:
140z(400g) unsweetened dessicated coconut
14oz can of sweetened condensed milk
1/3 cup of extra dessicated coconut

Place the desiccated coconut in a medium bowl and pour the sweetened condensed milk over the coconuts. Using a spatula, mix everything together until all the coconut is coated in sweetened condensed milk.
Roll a tablespoon worth of the coconut mixture into balls then roll each ball in the remaining shredded coconut and chill in the fridge before serving!

1q29h5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1q29h5w/convenience_stores_being_anything_but/,Convenience stores being anything but.,"I'm sick of how slow convenience stores are.  It should be a super simple and fast transaction, but it isn't.  First, the POS terminals have, like, 30 screens that must be navigated just to pay.  Then, there's the reward program.  I use the reward program too because it saves money, but I get the QR code ready on my phone so when it's my turn in line, the dude can just scan my phone and it's all good.  Nobody else seems to do this.  They take 20 minutes putting in their goddamn phone number.  It looks like they're trying to check their email on that thing or something.  

The worst offenders, though, are the motherfucking Lotto people.  They always take their sweet-ass time picking out their tickets.  And god forbid they have won something because now there's a whole side-quest the clerk has to go through to pay this lady her $5 just so she can buy more fucking tickets with it.  

I just want to buy my coffee and doughnut and go to work.  Can't you do you lottery bullshit at, like, 10 AM?  

Also, why do people wait until they get all the way up to the counter before they start dicking around with their wallet or their phone or whatever?  You just stood in line behind the Lotto lady for half an hour and you never thought it might be a good time to get your own shit in order?  Of course you didn't.  

And then, when you're done paying, move to the side to put all your shit away so the next person can conduct their business.  People spend a ridiculous amount of time sorting out their shit.  

I'm not perfect, but I have my QR code ready and then I tap to pay.  Boom.  Done.  And then I step to the side to bag my shit and put my phone in my pocket.  I'm a courteous motherfucker.  

I realize this is probably a fairly popular rant, but I had to vent.  ",5,1767385322.0,rant,2,1.0,False
1q29ge0,https://i.redd.it/0fd3srqsvzag1.jpeg,New feature discussion thread - accountability partners,"I’ve been thinking through a **new feature** and wanted your opinion.

Right now, Dawdle lets you:

* set a short focus timer
* choose a reward for finishing (coffee, walk, episode, etc.)
* block distracting apps during the session

This works decently for getting started **once**. But something both I and users keep running into is this: *internal motivation and self-rewards don’t always carry over to the next time you’re procrastinating.*

**You finish a session, feel good… and then later, you still don’t start again.**

So I’m exploring accountability partners. The idea:

* You choose a partner (friend, partner, sibling, parent, etc.)
* Every time you complete a focus session, they get a notification
* They can respond with simple reactions or messages like “Nice job,” “Proud of you,” “I see you showing up”

The key thing here is that the encouragement is real — not AI, not gamified points — but coming from someone whose opinion actually matters to you. It’s meant to feel more like a personal cheerleader than a productivity cop.

I’m planning to release the feature soon and would really appreciate honest feedback! I really value this community, and am genuinely curious about what you think.
