1k92nc1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k92nc1,04/26 Engagement Stats ü•£,"Good morning!  Of the 17 posts from 04/26, 16 remain visible.  Kylea quickly archived/hid/deleted post #5 I had dubbed Treat Yo Self.  One post hit 1k reactions (image 7), one hit 2k reactions (image 10), only 6 posts had more than 100 comments, and she gained approx. 41 followers pushing her over the 153k mark again (image 17). 

You Grow Girl is not accurately reporting her serving sizes.  However, let's ignore her delulu measurements for a sec and tally her Saturday WW points:

? WW point AM coffee at home;
5WW point breakfast;
? WW point Scooters blended coffee;
5 WW point snack plate lunch;
6 WW point taco salad;
4 WW point Pineapple Bliss TREAT;
? WW points on all the other coffee beverages & snacks she didn't show you

EQUALS Kylea has nothing to roll over into her weeklies bank.  I suspect she's been using all her 23 daily points and then tapping into her weeklies, which is why she needed bigger jeans and is no longer getting 40+ WW point weekly treats. üòâ 

IMO, you are witnessing her spiral and struggle to control her addictions.  Birdie is being left at home while she manically shops, doing anything to avoid spending time with Gym Bro Joe. He gets to stay home while Kylea plays third wheel accompanying her Mama and Step Daddy to dinner and a concert.  Make that make sense.

Speaking of nonsense, Alice and Oliver who? ‚úåÔ∏è

1k92lpm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k92lpm,5 days Roadtrip in Corsica,"We just got back from a 5-day trip around Corsica on our bikes, and I thought I'd share the experience. I was riding my CB500X and my girlfriend had her XT600.

Corsica is simply stunning: breathtaking landscapes, winding mountain roads, tiny villages tucked away in the hills... all with that amazing mix of sea breeze and forest smell that‚Äôs so unique to the island.

The CB500X was a real pleasure to ride, even on some pretty rough roads. It handled it all really well, though I have to admit it gave me a few scares when hitting sandy patches in the corners. Nothing major, but enough to keep you humble and remind you to respect the terrain.

Her XT600, on the other hand, felt completely at home ‚Äî light, nimble, and just eating up whatever came in front of it without a second thought.

We‚Äôre coming back with a ton of memories: crazy sunsets, endless twisty roads, coffee breaks with sea views... and those camping nights under the stars that make you feel like you don‚Äôt need anything else.

Already dreaming about the next trip. Maybe Sardinia? Why not.

1k92ipx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k92ipx,Coffee grinds too coarse after cleaning burr [Kottea CK404B],"Hello,

I removed the top burr of my grinder (Korea ck404b) to clean it. When unmounting the burr(in the finest grinding setting following manual), selector made a large clanking noise as if it went ""even finer"". When remounting it I ran in issues with weird noise, selector not covering the range properly and ground code being coarser than before at a given setting. It felt as if I turned the selector but it skipped the selection and the handle turned without the burr.

In the picture there is the coffee at the largest setting, which was definitely not that big before. Now the finest setting corresponds to the former largest one, and the noise is higher pitched than before. Nonetheless the selector is able to cover the whole range and the burr is dismounted/remounted on both ends of the spectrum as they should.

Did I damage the burrs in the process? Did I damage the selector? What should I do to try to repair?

TLDR; Removed burr to clean, selector made ""breaking"" noise. When remounting selector did not work well, now works as intended but grinder makes high noise when working and ground coffee is very coarse

Hi all!

I (22F) am in my final year of university. Last June, I met J (25M) at a day festival in London. The chemistry I had with him was unparalleled; we spoke for hours, had an amazing time, and he invited me out for coffee the following week.. which lead to a 6 month fling.

We would go on the cutest dates, spend full weekends together, and visit each others cities. There was a time I genuinely thought that he could be the one, and that I‚Äôd finally met my person. This lasted until December last year, where he suddenly dropped off the face of the planet.

J never really confided in me about his mental health, but I could tell that he was struggling with a lot. He was doing a PhD which he hated, whilst trying to find a job so he could drop out of it. It seemed like he always had a lot on, and was permanently stressed. The last message he ever sent me was a paragraph explaining that life had become insanely busy for him.. ‚ÄúEssentially, I really enjoy seeing you, but am struggling with life to see you as often as I‚Äôd like if that makes sense, and realise that‚Äôs completely unfair‚Äù (copied and pasted ü•≤). 

After that, I never heard from him again.. that was nearly 6 months ago now. It completely blindsided me, because from my perspective, it was going really well between us. I suspect what may have happened is that he lost interest, but was too much of a wuss to say it? I don‚Äôt know anymore..

So here is where my main issue now lays. 3 months ago, I met my now boyfriend (we‚Äôve been official just over a week!). We‚Äôll call him R (24/M). He really is an amazing person, and I‚Äôm starting to like him a lot. The issue is.. whilst I‚Äôve made my peace with the other situation, despite telling myself I am, I still don‚Äôt think that I‚Äôm fully over J. I think this because recently I posted something on Instagram, and saw J had viewed it (we never unfollowed eachother). And that stirred up so many emotions in me. 

I‚Äôm not too sure what to do. Do you have any advice for completely getting over it, other than blocking him haha (because that isn‚Äôt going to solve anything).

1k92ean,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1k92ean/insomnia_does_not_mean_your_brain_is_broken/,Insomnia does NOT mean your brain is broken,"While there are some medical conditions that contribute to insomnia, the vast majority of insomnia is NOT caused by a medical condition.

But many insomniacs become (understandably) convinced that they have a medical condition, and this conviction makes insomnia worse. 

Insomnia is NOT a sign that your brain is working incorrectly.

It‚Äôs actually your brain working correctly.

Why? Because your brain will only let you fall asleep if it feels safe. 

If your brain senses danger, it is designed to keep you awake. This is an evolved survival mechanism. It‚Äôs how your brain is supposed to work. 

You have insomnia because you have fallen into a trap of always getting anxious at bedtime. So your brain always senses danger at bedtime. 

What‚Äôs the solution? 

For me, just knowing this fact really helped. 

It‚Äôs impossible for your brain to lose the ability to fall asleep. It simply doesn‚Äôt happen. It‚Äôs not a thing. Even if you do have an actual medical condition that makes you vulnerable to insomnia, how do know it‚Äôs actually the medical condition causing severe insomnia, rather than the medical condition causing the anxiety trap, which then leads to severe insomnia? 

NOTHING will cause profound, severe, ongoing insomnia (not any medical condition, not bad sleep hygiene, not even caffeine use‚Ä¶) EXCEPT the anxiety trap. 

You could break every sleep hygiene rule in the book, drink a gallon of coffee, and STILL fall asleep easily, if you have no anxiety about sleep. 

This doesn‚Äôt present any obvious solution. Only you can know how to best work with this anxiety. But, I think having this knowledge and understanding really gives you a leg up in overcoming insomnia.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The ottoman with storage and tray offers a range of features designed to enhance convenience and versatility.

**Spacious Storage Compartment:**

The primary draw of this ottoman is its generous storage capacity. Many models offer upwards of 5 cubic feet of storage space, enough to stow away blankets, pillows, magazines, remote controls, or even toys. The interior is typically lined with fabric to protect stored items from dust and damage. The hinged lid allows for easy access to the contents while keeping them neatly concealed.

**Reversible Tray Top:**

A key feature is the reversible lid, which typically features a cushioned surface on one side for comfortable seating and a sturdy wooden or composite tray on the other. This tray is perfect for holding drinks, snacks, or even a laptop, transforming the ottoman into a functional coffee table or workstation. The tray often has raised edges to prevent items from sliding off.

**Durable Construction:**

Most ottomans with storage and tray are constructed with a solid wood or engineered wood frame, ensuring stability and longevity. The frame is often reinforced at stress points to withstand regular use and weight. The exterior is typically upholstered in durable fabric, such as linen, faux leather, or velvet, chosen for its resistance to wear and tear and ease of cleaning.

**Upholstery Options and Style:**

These ottomans are available in a wide variety of upholstery options and styles, ranging from modern minimalist designs to more traditional and ornate styles. Color choices are extensive, allowing you to easily match the ottoman to your existing dËåÖcor. The stitching and detailing are often carefully considered to enhance the overall aesthetic appeal of the piece.

**Safety Hinges and Mechanisms:**

Many models incorporate safety hinges that prevent the lid from slamming shut, protecting fingers and preventing damage to the ottoman itself. These hinges also allow the lid to remain open at various angles, providing convenient access to the storage compartment. Some ottomans also feature locking mechanisms for added security.

**Portability and Ease of Movement:**

While designed to be sturdy, many ottomans with storage and tray are also relatively lightweight, allowing for easy movement around the room as needed. Some models even feature casters or wheels, making it even easier to reposition the ottoman. This is particularly useful in smaller spaces where furniture arrangements may need to be adjusted frequently.

Key features of the ottoman with storage and tray include:
    * Spacious interior storage
    * Reversible tray top
    * Durable frame construction
    * Variety of upholstery and style options
    * Safety hinges and mechanisms
    * Portability

 ## Core Benefits

The ottoman with storage and tray provides a multitude of benefits that enhance both the functionality and aesthetics of a living space.

**Space Optimization:** The dual functionality of the ottoman significantly contributes to optimizing space. The storage compartment allows for decluttering and organizing belongings, while the tray provides a convenient surface, eliminating the need for additional furniture pieces like side tables or coffee tables, especially useful in compact apartments or rooms.

**Enhanced Comfort and Convenience:** The cushioned top provides a comfortable footrest or extra seating, while the reversible tray allows for easy snacking, working, or gaming without having to move to a table. This adds a layer of convenience to everyday activities, making the living space more enjoyable and practical. For example, you can comfortably watch a movie while enjoying snacks and drinks placed securely on the tray.

**Aesthetic Appeal and Versatility:** With a wide range of styles, colors, and upholstery options, these ottomans can seamlessly integrate into any dËåÖcor. The ottoman serves as a statement piece or a subtle complement to the existing furniture. Its versatility allows it to function as a footrest, seating, a coffee table, or a storage unit, adapting to the changing needs of the household.

**Improved Organization and Decluttering:** The storage compartment offers a discreet solution for organizing miscellaneous items that often clutter living spaces. This contributes to a cleaner and more organized environment, reducing stress and creating a more relaxing atmosphere. Storing blankets, pillows, or electronic accessories within the ottoman keeps them readily accessible yet out of sight.

**Increased Functionality for Small Spaces:** In apartments or small homes, the multi-functional ottoman becomes an indispensable asset. It serves multiple purposes without taking up significant floor space, making it ideal for maximizing the utility of limited square footage.

I‚Äôve never tried specialty coffee, so I‚Äôm completely lost in terms of everything. A bit concerned I won‚Äôt be able to appreciate much the difference and also that I won‚Äôt be able to brew it good enough not to ruin it.

That being said, my current very basic set up is a clear AeroPress, Timemore C3 ESP Pro grinder and Timemore mini scale. Next to buy are a kettle and a pour over dripper. (Some advice would be appreciated about these too).

The Spanish roasters I‚Äôm considering buying from are Nomad, Ineffable, Dalston and Astro. Was also checking Incapto but something‚Äôs feels off, as well as Syra, read some not so great comments. 

Regarding European ones, Onyx also has caught my attention as well as Noma (maybe for the future if I want to expand the horizons). And online shops such as Kofio and Maxicoffee.

Anyone with some experiences buying from them? Any specific recommendations from their coffees?

Other options and guidance are welcome too. Thank you very much!!

1k92563,https://www.reddit.com/r/joannfabrics/comments/1k92563/heres_what_to_expect_in_the_final_days/,Here‚Äôs what to expect in the final days.,"We just closed on Friday and I figured I would let everyone kinda know what to sort of expect but obviously it‚Äôs going to vary depending on your rep. 

First of all, we were blessed with a PHENOMENAL rep!  Most down to earth guy!  He didn‚Äôt care about our little stashes of stuff we had, he hooked all the employees up with massive discounts the last day, and he even bought cookies, pizza, and coffee for everyone. And he took time to get to know everyone and chat with everyone. I‚Äôm really sorry if you got a horrible rep. 

But this is what the last week looked like for us: discounts changing constantly, 50% off if you buy the entire bolt, then that was replaced by 25% off your entire order. We had to keep moving everything to the front of the store. We sold out of fabric 3 days before we closed. Take down all the empty pegs in the store, take down all the signage and anything that said Joann including all the signs in the sections of the aisles, clean out the cut counter(we were allowed to take home scissors and stuff). Clean out around the registers.  Lots of bulk fixture sales. It‚Äôs going to get very loud from everyone taking home their fixtures. Lots of customers expressing their sadness and wanting to know what you‚Äôre doing next.

The third to final day all of the manager overrides were removed from the system so employees could change prices or give discounts. All of the patterns had to be destroyed. And when I tell you my heart broke üíî. This is straight from the pattern companies and not GA.  We were doing tons of bulk pattern deals the night before. Our rep destroyed all of the patterns, we weren‚Äôt even given a shot because I would‚Äôve made sure some could‚Äôve been saved üò≠. 

The second to final day our rep went crazy and started slashing all the prices in the store to $1-$3.  Started finding random non scannable merch in the back and putting it at the register for people to buy. Started making bulk buy deals with fixture people such as ‚Äúif you buy all the jewelry making stuff I‚Äôll sell you this for cheaper‚Äù. So a lot of categories of stuff were gone quick. Stuff started really flying after this. And on the final day he pretty much made everything 10 cents to 50 cents, even stuff that was still ringing up $10.  There were no Cricuts left, no fabric, no yarn, no vinyl, no jewelry making stuff. Most people came in took 1 minute to look at the very little left and walked out. 

If you‚Äôre holding onto any merchandise for yourself behind the counter or cut counter on the last day you better either watch it or buy it because people were going insane and going behind both and grabbing other people‚Äôs stuff. We had to yell at multiple people and refuse sales for this. Our rep came through and let us shove it all in the back after this started happening. The last day was like literal vultures and people still complaining about the deals when it was essentially highway robbery. We completely sold out of stuff at 3pm and had to keep turning people away unless they wanted fixtures. Around 4:30 is when we said no more fixture sales unless you have cash because we closed out all the registers. 

The last day scrap metal people bought a lot of the metal in the store including gondolas, pegs, shelves for the gondolas, basically any metal. It was VERY loud with them tearing everything apart and in and out all day. And then we had to go in the next day and clean which honestly wear a mask. Decades of dust in our store. We had to make sure all of the signage was down, sweep, trash everything at the cut counter and registers. All the papers anywhere around the register or cut counter need to be taken down. People were also allowed to finish picking up their fixtures this day so although we had to lock the door we let people in and out. If you‚Äôre going to look under the bottom shelf of the gondolas, you‚Äôre gonna find tons of merchandise but be careful because you could get hurt and an aisle could fall on you. 

Best of luck to everyone, I know how absolutely gut wrenching it is to watch the store completely disappear all while having customers kick you while you‚Äôre down. I truly hope everyone finds a place they love as much if not more. Stay strong everyone. ",16,1745754563.0,joannfabrics,3,1.0,False

1k923fk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1k923fk/explore_if_the_gevi_10cup_drip_coffee_maker_lives/,Explore if the Gevi 10-Cup Drip Coffee Maker lives up to the hype review!,"The **Gevi DCMB0-BK0A1 10-Cup Drip Coffee Maker** caught my attention because it seemed to combine everything I wanted from a coffee machine: a built-in grinder, programmability, and a generous 10-cup capacity. Over the past few weeks, I‚Äôve been putting it through its paces and exploring its potential as my go-to coffee brewer. It‚Äôs a stylish machine with features that might make any coffee enthusiast curious, but just like anything else‚Äîit‚Äôs not perfect. Let‚Äôs dive into what stood out (and what didn‚Äôt).

**Design and Build Quality**  
Right out of the box, it looks sleek in black with silver accents. The maker's dimensions‚Äî12.36""D x 8.38""W x 16.93""H‚Äîare manageable but require a bit of counter space. This isn‚Äôt a compact machine, so if your kitchen is already cluttered, you‚Äôll want to make sure there‚Äôs room for it. I personally love clean and modern aesthetics, so it fits beautifully with my appliances. It‚Äôs reassuringly hefty at about 9.92 pounds, giving it a durable feel, even though I wouldn‚Äôt call it lightweight for frequent repositioning.

**Functionality and Features**  
What sold me initially was its programmable nature. With a 24-hour digital timer, I can set the grind and brew schedule before I sleep, waking up to the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. The machine offers three strength settings for those who vary their preferences‚Äîsome mornings call for bold coffee, other days I stick to medium. Adjusting these options is intuitive because the control panel keeps it simple with dedicated buttons and easy-to-follow instructions. 

Another noticeable feature is the built-in burr grinder. As someone who geeks out over coffee freshness, using the grinder felt next-level for a drip coffee maker. There are eight grind settings, offering fine to coarse adjustments depending on the outcome you‚Äôre after. Whether I brewed a single cup (using the 2-cup minimum) or a full 10-cup carafe for weekend brunches, I could balance water quantities with grind size pretty easily.  

**[Check Gevi DCMB0-BK0A1 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0d2mmghm8/)**  

**Positives**  
There‚Äôs a lot to admire about this product, and here are some highlights:  

- The 2-hour warming plate keeps coffee hot without turning it overly bitter.
- An anti-drip function eliminates spills, so every pour is mess-free.  
- Reusable filters saved me from purchasing paper filters endlessly (eco-friendlier too).  
- Quiet operation during both grinding and brewing phases‚Äîtrust me, you‚Äôll appreciate it.  

Using it every day, I noticed how fast this drip coffee machine works. Within 10 minutes, I went from switching it on to enjoying my caffeine fix. There‚Äôs barely any wait involved.

**Challenges with Daily Use**  
Of course, there‚Äôs no such thing as a perfect coffee maker. While most of its features excel, some areas need improvement:  

- Cleaning the built-in grinder can feel like a chore, as fine grinds tend to stick behind compartments.  
- Not the most compact appliance for smaller kitchens‚Äîits size caught me off guard initially.  
- Although the manual explains functions clearly, beginners might find playing with grind-size settings a little intimidating.  
- The power cord could have been a little longer for more flexible placement.  

These weaknesses didn‚Äôt entirely ruin my experience, but it's something to keep in mind depending on your priorities.

**Performance and Practicality**  
After weeks of experimenting, this coffee maker consistently produced rich, smooth coffee. The pre-brew technology prepares grounds by hydrating them at an optimal temperature before brewing, making each cup flavorful. I‚Äôve used it for both work-from-home days and gatherings‚Äîit holds up no matter the occasion. Programming it to brew in the mornings became my favorite feature, though; come 7 a.m., freshly brewed goodness awaited me without effort.

**Competing Options**  
In its price category, there are other coffee makers with grinders, like the Breville Grind Control or Cuisinart DGB-800. What separates this model for me is how user-friendly the whole brewing process feels. Some high-end machines are overly complicated with overwhelming presets, but this machine keeps things simple while still being precise. However, competitors like the Breville offer a slightly sturdier design and better grind consistency for espresso, something Gevi‚Äôs drip maker doesn‚Äôt claim to specialize in. But for making spaces cozy with brewed coffee for friends or family, this one delivers with flair.

**Value for Money**  
Is it all worth it? Absolutely‚Äîespecially when factoring in its features like the burr grinder and programmability. While it isn‚Äôt the cheapest coffee maker with a built-in grinder, it strikes that sweet spot between function and affordability. You‚Äôre getting great coffee without splurging on over-the-top luxury options. Its robust performance suits daily drinkers, weekend brewers, or even gifting purposes.

1k922xb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k922xb,"When I play the game, sometimes I am just angry because this game has so much potential","I feel like the cards I show are (I think) flavor fails, which means the card art, abilities and class are mismatched. They can become so much better even if they become underpowered, yet here we are.




-Agent: Everything about this screams Sneaky, yet it's a Beastly card. And don't try to say ""stat buffs are for Beastly"", all classes should have somethings like card draw/generation, big Garg, stat buffs or even cost reduction, some should have more or less than the others like how Brainy has more draws, Sneaky has more Gravestone, etc





-Cornucopia: I get it, ramp should have payoffs, but the effect screams Kabloom. The art also has many small fruits, which is Kabloom thing.




-Primal Wall Nut: Nothing about this suggests it can conjure a high-cost card. People know Primal Wall Nut as a low cost, low recharge, high durability, tank 3 Garg hits, only high health makes it's way into here.




-Sow Magic Beans: the card art shows 3 beans while the effect shuffles 4/5 magic beanstalks. Unplayable.




-Hot Lava: The only reason this card isn't Guardian is because it's red. The card actively works against what Kabloom is trying to do, why its main use are in Guardian, a class that has BDSM synergies (and anti-synergies but that go against my argument) but lacks BDSM tools.




-Fossilhead: Same reason as PWN, but with another issue: the effect is very Beastly. But I suppose this card is more of a joke card.




-Robber: Not only does it have the same problems as Agent, but it also has Bulleye for some reason??? Crazy is a class that shouldn't have easily accessible high damage Bullseye card.




-Plucky Clover: Ahh, I get it now. The card is a reference to the fact that to even be a borderline usable card, it has to conjure at least itself, which is a four-leaf clover, a symbol of luck.





-Sea-Shroom: they just don't want Smarty to have too many Amphibious.






But, there are also some real gems in card flavour like Coffee Zombie, Going Viral, Hot Date,... I think it can be improved.

This product boasts an impressive suite of features that had me excited to dive in, but it‚Äôs not without quirks that coffee and espresso enthusiasts need to be aware of. Here's an honest breakdown of my experience with it.

**Aesthetics Meet Functionality**  
This espresso machine fits the bill perfectly when it comes to compact design. Its minimalist aesthetic and glossy white exterior really elevate kitchen decor, blending seamlessly into modern setups. The diamond-patterned, easy-grip cylindrical water tank doesn‚Äôt just look stylish‚Äîit helps a lot during cleaning or refills. It‚Äôs lightweight, despite its 27.8-pound overall weight, and doesn‚Äôt take up much counter space. Plus, everything feels pretty durable for daily use, even if I‚Äôm clumsy before a morning caffeine boost.

**Intelligent Brewing Features Made Easy**  
Programming the drink customization options turned my daily brew into an exploratory hobby. The Intelligent Pulse Extraction Process (P.E.P.) is one feature I relied on heavily, and it definitely delivers. It fine-tunes the extraction time, pulling out well-rounded flavors whether you're brewing a creamy espresso or a robust caff√® doppio. The clever CLEARYL Smart+ Water System with RFID technology stood out too, ensuring every cup tastes clean thanks to its automatic water detection feature.

[Check Jura ENA 4 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0cf46hm1g/)

**Performance and Daily Usage**  
The multi-level Aroma G3 Grinder blew me away with its speed and efficiency‚ÄîI‚Äôve run bags of beans through it, and the aroma has remained divine. Having eight grind intensity options was fantastic for catering to guests who like their coffee at varying strengths. Switching to the ground coffee chute on days when I ran out of beans was seamless. It is probably one of the most thoughtful design choices for forgetful coffee drinkers like me. I also appreciated its compatibility with the J.O.E. (JURA Operating Experience) app, allowing me to prepare coffees wirelessly!

**Positives**  
There are several impressive aspects of this product:  
- Stunning and space-efficient modern design.  
- Precise and adjustable brewing options ensure excellent coffee every time.  
- Aroma G3 grinder preserves the freshness of the beans.  
- Effortless cleaning with automatic water filter detection.  

**Shortcomings**  
However, not everything about this product is ideal:  
- The machine doesn‚Äôt come with a milk frother, which feels restrictive for latte and cappuccino lovers.  
- It‚Äôs noticeably louder than I‚Äôd like during grinding cycles.  
- The programming, although excellent, can feel a bit daunting for someone unfamiliar with espresso mechanics.  

**Product Competitors**  
In comparison to other automatic espresso machines like the Breville Barista Touch and De‚ÄôLonghi Dinamica, the Jura ENA 4 prioritizes flavor quality and minimalism. While the Breville offers an integrated steam wand and the De‚ÄôLonghi boasts more grind size options, neither feels as intuitive or compact as the Jura model. What really sets Jura apart is its impeccable water filtration system, although its noise level during operation is slightly higher than the competition.

**Value Assessment**  
The machine is undeniably a premium product. It feels sophisticated and performs reliably, but the price might not fall into the budget of someone looking for a quick and basic espresso fix. However, for those wanting consistent quality and modern features like RFID-enabled water filtering and Wi-Fi Connect compatibility, it genuinely feels worth the investment. Whether it‚Äôs your first venture into super-automatic models or an upgrade, this product lives up to expectations for advanced brewing systems.

1k91wen,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridgeFanatic/comments/1k91wen/does_the_fzf_ice_makers_countertop_truly_deliver/,Does the FZF Ice Makers Countertop Truly Deliver? A Comprehensive Review,"Testing out the FZF Ice Makers Countertop has been oddly satisfying, like stepping into an episode of those commercials where everything works seamlessly. The model's promise of 9 ice pellets in just 6 minutes felt ambitious, so I put it to the test during a family game night‚Äîand let‚Äôs just say, this machine had zero chill, pun intended. Without much noise (thanks to the upgraded compressor), it delivered crisp bullet-shaped ice cubes faster than anyone could shout, ‚ÄúMore mojitos please!‚Äù Right off the bat, the self-cleaning function already made it feel like one of those ‚ÄúWhy wasn‚Äôt I told about this magic contraption earlier?‚Äù products.  

**Design and Portability**  
Design-wise, this ice maker is compact yet functional. Measuring roughly 12.3"" x 8.7"" x 12.5"", it‚Äôs smaller than your average coffee maker, making it perfect for our somewhat cluttered kitchen counter. At 16.3 pounds, it‚Äôs hefty enough to feel sturdy but light enough to tuck away when not in use. Because it‚Äôs portable, I‚Äôve taken it out on camping trips and found it to be a hit for cooling drinks under the stars. The removable ice basket and scoop add to its practicality‚Äîno fumbling or awkwardly spilling ice all over the place.  

[Check FZF Ice Makers Countertop price on Amazon.](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b0brb6f45j/)  

**Performance and Efficiency**  
This ice maker stands out for its quiet operation and efficiency. Seriously, I‚Äôve had louder hair dryers than this machine‚Äîit‚Äôs like white noise but better because it's making ice. One evening, while catching up on sleep-deprived parenting drama with my sister, we managed to empty two rounds of ice without being disturbed by noise. The on-demand ice production for hosting or cooling down a steaming cup of iced coffee in summer feels like luxury crammed into a tiny box.  

**Highlight Features**  
‚Äí Produces two sizes of bullet-shaped ice cubes, adjusting to your needs.  
‚Äí Stays wonderfully silent during the ice-making process.  
‚Äí The transparent viewing window lets you witness your ice dreams coming true without any interruptions.

**Control Interface**  
The touch-sensitive control panel deserves a shoutout. With infrared sensor technology, the machine knows exactly when to stop‚Äîthere‚Äôs no fear of overfilling. Imagine reaching into the freezer and never having to break apart frozen sheets of ice. The water shortage indicator is another solid touch; it‚Äôs painfully honest and won't let you forget to refill. What we really enjoyed is the ease of use‚Äîliterally one press of a button to get started. My 12-year-old niece got a kick out of pretending she was an ice-making wizard.

**Good Points**  
- Quick and efficient ice production (9 ice cubes in 6 minutes).  
- Self-cleaning feature simplifies maintenance.  
- Compact size yet delivers a large capacity (26 lbs/24 hours).  

**Critiques**  
- The ice melts a bit faster than expected after sitting for a while.  
- The black surface is prone to fingerprints, which might bother tidy folk.  
- The instructions could be clearer; I had to Google one or two things initially.

**Product Alternatives**  
While FZF‚Äôs countertop ice maker does a fantastic job, there are similar options on the market that cater to niche needs. Models like the GE Profile Opal Nugget Ice Maker are top-rated for delivering incredibly soft, chewable nugget ice. However, they come at a significantly steeper price point and lack certain features like quick cleaning. Then there‚Äôs the Igloo ICEB26HNSS, which also has a self-cleaning function but doesn‚Äôt match the speed or capacity this one offers. In terms of value for size, portability, and efficiency, the FZF holds its ground remarkably well against its competitors.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Given its combination of features like self-cleaning, fast ice production, and portability, this ice maker feels worth the investment for small families, couples, or occasional party hosts. More premium models may offer fancier perks, but for the price, this one provides undeniable value. It blends reliability with affordability and doesn‚Äôt feel like you're shelling out unnecessarily for things you don‚Äôt need.

Any Product Recs?,"Note: I kind of answered most of my questions, but I was hoping folks on this sub would still discuss things about my post, especially things I missed.

Long story short I'm an noob to allergies. I saw an ENT a few months ago. I did an allergy test. I saw the ENT because I was having congestion and a breathing issue. Eventually, the congestion went away and the breathing was an GI issue; taking a prescribed acid reducer helped.

Sure, I had seasonal allergies growing up, when I think about they got better during my adolescent years, but now I'm in my early 20s, and they have gotten worse.

Now that the Spring season has finally set in in my area for the past two weeks, and because of how bad allergies are this year for everyone, I realized I need to step it up and clean my bedsheets and my bedroom overall more often. (I guess at least weekly)

Fortunately, I already have an air purifier. 

I do have a humidifier, but I still haven't look into ways on saving money on distilled water. I know you can use boiled water, but my concern is hard water and mineral buildup. I don't want to ruin my new machine. Perhaps I'm better of buying something to regularly remove hard water buildup. All I know is that Vinegar is helpful when I tried to remove hard water from other things in the past.

I haven't tried using citric acid yet. From my understanding, it's a powder you mix with water right?

Has anyone had luck using descalers for coffee machines and stuff? That would be easier for me to find in-store.

But now it's getting hotter, I realized I should probably get a dehumidifier. My room always gets humid in the summer. I understand mold and stuff like humidity.

I'm already exhausted thinking of cleaning my bedroom. (I'm coping with depression)

I don't even dust regularly.

I guess the point of my post is finding out what is the bare minimum on caring for my room as someone who knows suffers more from allergies.",1,1745753652.0,Allergies,2,1.0,False

The TOZO NC2, with its sleek design and active noise-cancellation technology, seemed promising right out of the box. It might not be perfect in every category, but I‚Äôve discovered plenty of strengths and a few areas where improvements could make a big difference.

**Stylish Yet Functional Design**  
At first glance, the TOZO NC2 earbuds caught my eye with their minimalist and modern design. Their compact, lightweight build, weighing only 1.69 ounces, makes them an ideal companion for my daily commutes or when hitting the gym. The rounded ear tips not only look premium but also fit snugly into my ears, offering comfort even during extended use. The black plastic used for both the earbuds and the carrying case feels sturdy yet lightweight. While testing, I accidentally dropped the charging case a few times‚Äîit survived without a scratch, convincing me of its durability during day-to-day activities.  

**Excellent Sound with Deep Bass**  
The sound quality is where the TOZO NC2 shines. With a dynamic driver and a frequency range of 20Hz-20kHz, it consistently delivers premium, immersive audio. It's especially noticeable when listening to tracks heavy on bass. My own playlists, which range from pop beats to instrumental focus tracks, sounded rich and balanced. While its overall audio performance is impressive, audiophiles might notice the treble isn‚Äôt as crisp as some higher-end models. Still, for someone like me who uses earbuds during workouts, walks, or casual listening, the audio feels absolutely sufficient.

**Key Benefits**  
- Lightweight and compact with a sturdy design.  
- Enhanced bass and immersive sound quality.  
- Comfortable and snug in-ear fit, even for long periods.  

[Check TOZO NC2 Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds price on Amazon.](https://wirelessemporium.com/check/b09pd655kk/)  

**Feature-Packed Active Noise Cancellation**  
We have to discuss the hybrid three-layer active noise cancellation feature. During my week of testing, I used these earbuds in noisy environments‚Äîcoffee shops, subways, and even a windy park. The outward-facing and inward-facing microphones reduced up to 35dB of external noise. It wasn‚Äôt perfect, as higher-pitched sounds (like someone yelling nearby) still seeped through, but it works wonders with consistent droning noises like subway rumbles or air conditioning. I appreciate the effort TOZO made, though, as not all earbuds in this price range perform this well when it comes to noise blocking.

**Transparency Mode for Real-World Situations**  
If you‚Äôre someone like me who occasionally fears missing the subway conductor‚Äôs announcements, the transparency mode is a lifesaver. One moment you‚Äôre immersed in your music, and the next, you can easily hear your surroundings by activating the mode. It's seamless and doesn‚Äôt feel intrusive. I found it helpful at the gym, too, when I wanted to casually interact with others without constantly removing my earbuds.

**Flaws**  
- Transparency mode could feel more ‚Äúreal‚Äù‚Äîslight artificiality in ambient sound perception.  
- Treble not as sharp as higher-end competitors.  

**Ideal for On-the-Go Lifestyles**  
The TOZO NC2 checks a lot of boxes for anyone who values mobility. The one-step pairing feature was a breeze. I simply opened the charging case, popped out the earbuds, and they connected automatically to my phone's Bluetooth within seconds. With Bluetooth 5.2, the 10-meter range was sufficient for all my needs, even when roaming around the house. The IPX6 waterproofing brought peace of mind during sweaty workout sessions or when caught in light rain. If you‚Äôre sporty or move around a lot, these earbuds fit perfectly into an active lifestyle.

**Charge on the Go**  
The earbuds themselves last about 10 hours on a single charge, while the compact wireless charging case extends the total playtime up to an incredible 42 hours. I noticed I charged the case only once over the week, even while using the earbuds for several hours daily. It‚Äôs not the fastest-charging case out there, but the longevity compensates for that minor inconvenience.

**Limitations**  
- Limited treble clarity for audiophiles.  
- Slightly artificial transparency sound in bustling environments.

**Competing Products**  
Comparing the TOZO NC2 to some rivals like the Apple AirPods Pro and Samsung Galaxy Buds, I‚Äôd say it fares well in most areas, particularly for its price point. The TOZO NC2 excels in active noise cancellation, offering similar features to the AirPods Pro though at a fraction of the cost. However, Samsung's Galaxy Buds slightly outperform the NC2 in transparency mode where the ambient sound feels more natural. That said, TOZO NC2 offers significantly better bass response than both these alternatives, making it a fantastic option for bass lovers or budget-conscious consumers looking for premium features.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
If you‚Äôre hunting for earbuds that give you terrific value, the TOZO NC2 emerges as a strong contender. You get premium features like hybrid noise cancellation, transparency mode, water resistance, and powerful sound without emptying your wallet. Although it doesn‚Äôt quite match the refinement of high-tier competitors like Sony or Bose, it delivers a comparable experience for a far friendlier price tag.

Commuter trains are packed before 6 a.m., 24-hour gyms are always buzzing, and caf√©s are already pouring their third batch of coffee.

He (even though I know he wants to spend more time with me too) is constantly working student jobs and then going straight to the gym, which leaves us with very little time together.
To be clear, he is a genuinely good person, and there‚Äôs nothing about his behavior that I would want to change ‚Äî it‚Äôs more about us possibly having different lifestyles and long-term visions.

We had some disagreements that I didn‚Äôt bring up in the best way ‚Äî I even considered breaking up ‚Äî but after talking things through, we agreed to give it another try. Since then, we‚Äôve made real progress, and I truly feel happy when we‚Äôre together.
Still, deep down, I can't shake the fear that our differences might become a bigger issue in the future, especially since we‚Äôre both still very young.

At the same time, I recently met up with an old high school friend ‚Äî someone I used to have a crush on (and the feelings were mutual back then), although nothing ever happened between us. Talking to him made me realize how similar we are, or at least how I remember us being. We met again for coffee, and it‚Äôs pretty clear that there are still some feelings on both sides.
Now I feel torn between what feels safe and good with my current boyfriend, and what feels exciting but uncertain with this old friend.

Adding to all this, I'm naturally a very sensitive person, and over the past year, I‚Äôve gone through some mild depressive episodes, which might also be affecting the way I think and feel.
Part of me is terrified: what if I leave someone truly good now and regret it later? But at the same time, what if I stay, only to realize I was holding onto something that deep down doesn't fit me anymore?
Or what if I try something with my old friend and realize I was only clinging to a memory, not the person he actually is today?

Please, if anyone has advice from a psychological or emotional perspective, I would appreciate it so much.
How do I manage these feelings?
And how can I handle this situation with the least amount of hurt for everyone involved?

A few people asked for an update, so here‚Äôs what has happened.

[When I first posted about DELI FM](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1k09k23/i_uh_accidentally_made_a_247_crypto_radio_station/)¬†‚Äî the fully autonomous AI-powered crypto radio stream hosted by a sarcastic cardboard box named Buzz Shipmann ‚Äî it was a weird side project to see if AI could run a continuous live media stream without any human intervention.

It started simple:

* Breaking crypto headlines every 90 seconds
* Roasted live by Buzz
* Smooth bossa nova music
* A fake chat that reacts automatically to the news

Now it‚Äôs expanding into a full fictional world.

The stream now broadcasts from the city of Deliverance, Kansas.  
There are live correspondents cutting in with bizarre local news.  
Fake (and real) sponsors advertise products like ""Blockchain Toothpaste"" and ""DeFi Mouthwash.""  
Buzz is still spiraling between serious headlines and complete nonsense.

New features are also being added:

* Listeners will soon be able to trigger events live (make Buzz roast you, change his shirt, make him drink coffee, have a hammer smack him in the head, have items pop out of his head)
* More civic chaos and fake city events are on the way

The stream is still live 24/7, fully autonomous, and weirdly growing.

I will post the link again in the comments if anyone wants to check it out.

So, I am very well aware that there isn't really a 100% ""only use this app and you're good"" kinda app and that the apps range from literally useless to really awesome at this one specific thing. And I also understand that they work great for languages close to your native language but usually lack the means to convey the nuances with languages further removed from your native language. Basically, they drop off hard if they can't rely on your intuition already getting you there 90% of the way.

But I now have a small child and since then I haven't touched a single language learning resource I used to use. Neither books nor apps nor media. So I'm looking for an app that allows me to use the 5-10 minutes I have every now and then, before a work meeting, on the toilet or when I wait for my coffee machine to heat up, for language learning and not mindless scrolling on social media. And I'm probably not gonna find the time to study properly in the near future so I thought doing at least something that is somewhat suboptimal is probably better than doing literally nothing.

I said ""no Anki"" in the title because Anki makes me depressed. I don't even know exactly what it is but the times I used it (mostly for Japanese) I really hated every single minute of it.

I'm not too picky on the language. I'm interested in a lot of different languages and I have a few itches that want to be scratched right now so I'd just go for whatever is available and matches my interests.

Yesterday - I bumped into a man who used to eat at our restaurant frequently.


He was rude, would click his fingers at me to get my attention, seat himself and then yell he was ready to order immediately, even if I was in the middle of serving someone else.
Send food back constantly, telling me the noodles were not fresh enough. Soup was not hot enough, not enough veggies, too many veggies!!!

We indeed made our own noodles!! And they were fresh everyday!!
One time even trying to confront me in front of other customers accusing us of lying, he said ‚Äúyour noodles are definitely not fresh but frozen, I can tell! You should stop lying to your everyone. I‚Äôm not gullible!! Like the rest of your customers-but I don‚Äôt mind. You should just be truthful‚Äù
No but seriously, we made our own noodles as noodles and dumplings were what we were known for and had been for more than 20 years.

He would turn up with his colleagues, a group of 10 or more in the middle of our busy lunch rush and get offended we couldn‚Äôt seat them.
‚ÄúUh - but I‚Äôm a regular, it‚Äôs kind of rude that you‚Äôre not prioritising me?‚Äù He would say.
Lunch time was our busiest, we were a small family run place with about 50 seats. Since there were a lot of offices near us, we were always completely full.

He would not tip but also if he was eating with others would say ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no need to tip them! I come here all the time!‚Äù

When he ordered, he always made sure to tell me that he was in a hurry - ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very busy you know‚Äù
But proceed to sit for hours until we were closing.

Sometimes he would even bring his wife to the restaurant in the evenings and she was equally horrid.

Anyway, I saw this guy yesterday while I was having a coffee with my friend.
He recognised me straight away and come over to say hello.
He is now in a wheelchair. 
He told me he had a cycling accident with a car and was now paralysed from the waist down.

It feels weird. I feel bad for him but also not bad  because just seeing his face sort of gave me PTSD from when he would yell and snap his fingers at me.

# Best ASU Hats 2025: Top Styles For Sun Devil Fans

The sun beats down relentlessly in Tempe, Arizona, and for any true Arizona State University Sun Devil, a quality hat is more than just an accessory; it's a necessity. It's a badge of honor, a shield against the desert heat, and a stylish way to show your maroon and gold pride. This review focuses on the best ASU hats expected to be trending in 2025, considering factors like comfort, durability, design, and of course, the ability to represent your Sun Devil spirit. We'll explore different styles and materials to help you find the perfect lid for game days, campus walks, or everyday wear.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The best ASU hats of 2025 are expected to incorporate several key features that blend performance with style, appealing to a wide range of Sun Devil fans.

**Moisture-Wicking Technology:**

Look for hats crafted with advanced moisture-wicking fabrics. These materials, often polyester blends, draw sweat away from the skin, keeping you cool and comfortable even in the hottest conditions. This is particularly crucial in the Arizona climate where sun exposure and heat are constant factors. Many hats will feature breathable mesh panels strategically placed to enhance ventilation and further minimize sweat buildup.

**Durable Construction:**

A quality ASU hat should withstand the rigors of daily wear and tear. Expect to see hats constructed from robust materials like reinforced cotton twill or durable polyester. Seams should be meticulously stitched to prevent fraying or tearing, ensuring the hat maintains its shape and integrity over time. Strong closures, whether they be adjustable straps or fitted bands, will also contribute to the hat's longevity.

**Variety of Styles:**

The market will offer a diverse range of styles to suit every Sun Devil's preference. From classic baseball caps with curved brims to trendy flat-brim hats, there will be something for everyone. Visors will continue to be popular for those seeking maximum sun protection with minimal coverage. Bucket hats, offering a more relaxed and casual vibe, may also gain traction among students and alumni.

**Embroidered Logos and Designs:**

High-quality embroidery is essential for showcasing the iconic ASU logos and designs. Expect to see crisp, detailed renderings of Sparky the Sun Devil, the ASU pitchfork, and the university's official seal. The embroidery should be durable and resistant to fading, ensuring the hat remains a vibrant symbol of your Sun Devil pride for years to come. Some hats may also incorporate subtle design elements, such as tonal stitching or contrasting underbrims, to add a touch of sophistication.

**Adjustable Fit:**

An adjustable fit is crucial for ensuring comfort and versatility. Many hats will feature adjustable straps or snapback closures, allowing you to customize the fit to your head size. Fitted hats, while offering a more streamlined look, will be available in a range of sizes to accommodate different head circumferences. Elastic sweatbands will also contribute to a comfortable and secure fit.

**UV Protection:**

Given the intense Arizona sun, UV protection is a vital consideration. Many high-quality ASU hats will be constructed from fabrics with a UPF (Ultraviolet Protection Factor) rating of 30 or higher, blocking a significant percentage of harmful UV rays. This feature helps protect your scalp and face from sunburn and reduces the risk of long-term sun damage.

 ## Core Benefits

Investing in a well-designed ASU hat offers several tangible benefits beyond simply showing your school spirit.

**Enhanced Sun Protection:** An ASU hat provides essential protection from the harsh Arizona sun. By shielding your face, head, and neck from direct sunlight, it helps prevent sunburn, reduces the risk of skin damage, and keeps you cool during outdoor activities. Wearing a hat with UV protection is a proactive step in safeguarding your health while representing your favorite university.

**Stylish Expression of School Pride:** An ASU hat is a fashionable way to demonstrate your support for Arizona State University. It's a conversation starter, a symbol of camaraderie, and a statement of your affiliation with the Sun Devil community. Whether you're on campus, at a sporting event, or simply running errands, an ASU hat lets you proudly display your maroon and gold spirit.

**Improved Comfort and Performance:** A well-fitting and breathable ASU hat enhances your comfort and performance during outdoor activities. Moisture-wicking fabrics help keep you cool and dry, while a secure fit prevents the hat from slipping or becoming a distraction. This allows you to focus on your task at hand, whether it's cheering on the Sun Devils or enjoying a leisurely walk in the park.

**Versatile Accessory:** An ASU hat is a versatile accessory that can be worn in a variety of settings. It complements casual outfits, adds a touch of athletic flair to your wardrobe, and can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion. Whether you're attending a tailgate party, hitting the gym, or grabbing coffee with friends, an ASU hat is a practical and stylish addition to your ensemble.

 ## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about ASU hats:

**What are the different styles of ASU hats available?**
    There is a wide variety of ASU hat styles to choose from, including baseball caps, flat-brim hats, visors, bucket hats, and beanies. Baseball caps are the most classic and versatile option, while flat-brim hats offer a more modern and edgy look. Visors are ideal for sun protection without full coverage, while bucket hats provide a relaxed and casual vibe. Beanies are perfect for staying warm during cooler months.

**How do I choose the right size ASU hat?**
    To determine your hat size, measure the circumference of your head just above your eyebrows and ears. Use a flexible measuring tape for accurate results. Most adjustable hats will fit a range of head sizes, while fitted hats require precise measurements. Refer to the manufacturer's sizing chart for specific guidance.

**How should I care for my ASU hat to keep it looking its best?**
    To maintain the appearance of your ASU hat, follow the care instructions on the label. Most hats can be hand-washed with mild soap and water. Avoid using harsh detergents or bleach, as these can damage the fabric and embroidery. Air-dry your hat in a shaded area to prevent fading. For fitted hats, spot-cleaning may be the best option to preserve the shape.

Arguments for it: 

1. I like the original mix, and from what I can gather from the songs released on streaming so far, the remastering is very interesting.
2. I'm always a sucker for these things, with that coffee table book and so on. 
3. That whole live recording is also fantastic, especially from an instrumental point of view, and if I can block certain thoughts out of my mind, I can really enjoy it.

  
Arguments against it:

1.  It is f-ing expensive.
2. I can get a original mix vinyl for a fraction of the price (I have one already, in fact). 
3. I don't need the coffee table book.
4. I don't know yet how that coffee table book is going to look.
5. I really loathe the amount of rerecording Pete has done on The Lamb. I could have understood and lived with a couple of phrases here and there, for when he was out of breath. But singing in his deep voice (that he would only discover a lot later) and wanting his voice to be unaffected by a heavy tour is just revisionist history to me.

The Nokia has given me a feeling of peace and calm that i was never able to get with my smartphone, even if it was dumbed down.

There is 1 frustrating problem i have tho, everyone here uses Whatsapp and is used to sending texts with alot of ""enter"" or ""sent"" presses inbetween, wich they also do sending me an sms.
To someone on a smart phone it doesnt really matter if its whatsapp, imessage, text, everyone just sends texts like this:

Hey man how are you?
Dude,
I wanna tell something crazy
Yesterday <insert story here>
Haha it was so fun!
You should come too next time!
How are you?

That is 7 text messages, 7 times i hear my Nokia going ""tuutuutuuutuu"", i am already trying to write back with my T9 keyboard on your first message, it just takes a while lol.
So, if it is this much we are going to talk about, i should probably just call you right?
But, then i get another text often with ""sorry cant call rn, just text me"", wich i am absolutely not going to do because it would take half an hour of my day on a T9 keyboard :D.

The thing is, i know im the odd one out and im not expecting that it will change peoples behaviour (altho i really would like if they just call when they have the time to tell the story, or just meet up over a coffee or something), but thats a whole other conversation, so i just end up not doing anything with the text(s) they have sent me, sometimes when im at my computer i will reply on there with the whatsapp app, but if im doing literally anything else they will just have to wait.

I do feel bad about this tho to my friends, i told them this exact same story and they told me i shouldnt be worried and they understand, but i still keep getting alot of one word or sentence texts anyway :D, its just so normal in society to communicate like that now i guess.

NOTES

 Survival cooking is putting together what tastes reasonable good on a plate and eating that. You can't afford to be sick from not eating well.

throw out notions of proper recipes. you can't afford that either. recipes are suggestions at this point. youtube is your best friend here. you need to assemble a collection of basic techniques instead of recipes.

 think of meals as vegetables + healthy carbs, flavoured with meat or having a small amount of meat on the side especially if meat is very expensive. you'll always want fat + protein + carbs + fibre in every meal so you don't end up feeling hungry an hour later, then deplete  your food supply.",1,1745751702.0,Cooking,0,0.6,False

Increase facility expenses to include, but not limited to costs previously paid by the remote or teleworker:

HVAC and utility cost
Network costs
Janitorial services
Security services
Office supplies
Janitorial supplies.. you can bet everyone is pooping on gov time and using extra TP.

‚ÄúHidden expenses‚Äù:

Environmental costs of increased carbon footprints of commuters
Increased infrastructure expenses and wear and tear
Increased sick time usage caused by being farther away from healthcare providers, sick dependents, and see #1 below. 


Lost productivity due to:
1.Not giving a shit anymore due to administration treatment 
2. Cigarette breaks by people who smoked at their desk at home
3.  Bathroom breaks more frequent and longer due to distance to rest room, multiple conversation stops, wait time (females only ) and see item #1.
4. Distraction from constant loud conversations, visiting chatters and the untrained emotional support dog looking for treats, sniffing my crotch, and pissing in his owners cubical.
5.  stupid ‚Äúmoral‚Äù activities like potlucks, gift exchanges, and hiding and searching for tiny plastic animals. Necessary due to item #1.

Hi this is Jeremy Millar and I‚Äôve gotten this job to guard this old (small) factory because the owner. Well I mean NEW owner because the previous one sold this factory due to bankruptcy, but after the deal was done a massive storm hit my area and caused a lot of damage to the place. So it‚Äôs under construction for a few weeks, but a bunch of teens keep trespassing leavening graffiti and stealing old junk left there.

Which is where I come in, they hired me and two other guards. I‚Äôm gonna give them fake names for privacy reasons (obviously) the youngest is Hunter while the older balding one is Steve. Hunter only got this job because he doesn‚Äôt like to be bossed around and it leaves him with time to read his manga.

But Steve is the mature one who‚Äôs really into security and doing it proper, so he and Hunter are totally pals with their matching Personalities.

(Anyway) we were placed in different positions to cover most ground, I‚Äôm right Next to the entrance outdoors. While Hunter is indoors with a cozy office while Steve just walks around the entire building to make sure nothing is wrong. So far nothing has happened tonight just the crickets and those two bickering, Hunter has accidentally left his walkie on. ‚ÄúLike dude nothing is ever gonna happen so who cares if I sit down all night reading high art‚Äù. ‚ÄúHeh right‚Ä¶ high art, now listen your here to do one thing and one thing only, that is to watch the cameras and put your eye around the property. Not read that junk!‚Äù while listening I thought I saw someone running across in front of me only to find out it was a kangaroo because I had to stay up late so my mind plays tricks on me.

On the next night Steve wanted Hunter to be more active so he had him on patrol duty, Hunter forgot to bring something to read and he‚Äôs legs are almost asleep. So he took the position and had a look around the place, so far the only thing he noticed was a weird smell on the floor, we didn‚Äôt give it much care because what are we supposed to do? Plus it was the construction crew‚Äôs job to clean up their own mess. Later i need to use the bathroom so I asked Steve to guard the front until I come back in couple of minutes, while walking to the nearby bathroom I thought I heard something. I paused to see what the noise was‚Ä¶ Nothing the noise didn‚Äôt repeat or saw anything so I went into one of stalls, while doing my business I felt very tired and struggled to stay awake‚Ä¶ BANG!

I jolted up awake with my heart beating fast as I put my hands in my face looking around. I was limited to what I got so I went up peeking into the gap it was quiet and I wasn‚Äôt sure what happened. I slowly opened the door and I realised I was alone in head in this isolated room, the only companion I had was the lights flickering and a poster to remind employees to wash their hands. I started to tear up a little even though I wasn‚Äôt that scared, I washed my hands and opened the door. But I looked back to the quiet bathroom just for a moment and ran like someone was chasing me. After returning I spoke to Steve ‚ÄúHey Steve I'm back you can can go back but thanks for covering me, I can repay by scolding Hunter for slacking off again‚Äù. Steve had a little smirk ‚Äúhmp thanks I‚Äòll take it my old throat needs a break from that kid, if only he was more like you‚Äù. After he left¬† it was just me again. I wished i didn‚Äôt because looking outside with Forrest and hills gave me chills but also like I was prey to some animal out there. I pull out my radio and asked Hunter how is he? He said he was bored but he had nothin to do except walking around. I asked him if something strange happened but he groaned and said nothing happened because that‚Äôs what usually happens. I replied saying ‚ÄúCool Cool right uh stay on guard Hunter‚Äù. He replied with ‚ÄùOh really it‚Äôs like my Job is to be on guard or something‚Äú. Smartass he really thinks he‚Äôs clever, I won‚Äôt be surprised if he imagined himself pushing up glasses like anime protagonist. Now it was night 3 and on this night I felt even more tired before even when I had bunch of coffees the only thing they did was to keep my up but I still felt so, so tired. I finally decided I should head home and take the night off this one time, but my legs feel to sleep so I couldn‚Äôt get up.

i felt like I was gonna be in a comma of how tired my body was, maybe my body was entering a comma but with the coffee it‚Äôs keeping my mind awake. Until me eyes felt so heavy my will weaken and I just accepted this and fell to sleep, maybe this nap would help later for the night. Now to write about the dream is hard‚Ä¶

since dreams go away and you when forget something our mind try‚Äôs to reconstruct it but details and events are not accurate. Either way I still had the dream and i‚Äòm gonna try my best to describe it,

because it was also a weird dream. I was standing in a deserted filled with giant rocks, unicorns, owls and flowers that looks white but yellow in the inside. I noticed that it was rock and looked up and saw giant fires that looked like it came from a camp fire. ‚ÄúThis way bizarre‚Äú I said to myself but after speaking my teeth fell out and my tongue flying which caused me to cry, but I couldn‚Äôt close my eyes or even blink or wink. So I shrugged saying ‚Äúeh who needs them‚Äù and kept walking until I reached a cave.

The cave looked like a frog with dragonfly wings, the mouth was opened so I walked deep under in the cave. The cave supposed to look but is something turned the brightness on the screen slightly up. I said ‚Äúoh the cave is very nice‚Ä¶‚Äù it started to get colder which I assume is because I was no longer in the presence of the sky fires. Fell into a massive hole then i looked up and saw a 30 feet wooden door, ‚Äúhmm what could be behind this door‚Äù. So I try to figure out how could I open the door, I turned around and I saw a giant rope which I concluded I should use it to open the door. So I went to grab this giant rope which was surprising light. As I pulled the rope to put over the handle the door started to open as I continue to pull.

A tower of sand suddenly collapsed on me and it felt like the sand was holding me, I looked up and saw a gigantic creature where hair are surrounding it‚Äôs holes on the giant creature where sand started blasting out like a water out of a tap. I don‚Äòt remember the rest despite it being big and puking sand out of its body, as I was awakened by Steve. He asked me how am I doing then I noticed sweat sliding down my face. After wiping my face I talked to him ‚ÄúI.. just really tired and uh, had this dream in the desert with campfire replacing all the stars in the sky‚Äù. He nodded about my need for sleep and suggested ‚ÄúJeremy you really need to take the night off, not just for our job but for you own personal reasons. I can take this position for the night, while switching with Hunter‚Äù. I thought for a moment and decided ‚ÄúYeah, yeah I will but i want to tell the supervisor about this and call a uber to head home‚Äú, Steve agreed as he radioed Hunter about this. (He was cool with). I called the Uber and the app says he arrive 5 mins, we work on top of a mountain so we get to see the city in the distance.

While waiting I noticed some bats flying over, birds in the trees staring at me. The coldness of the night with the subtle shaking of the leafs in the wind with this quiet night. Started to freak me out a bit it was like nature it self was watching, maybe learning to see what I was doing. I felt so vulnerable out here in the dark under this old light post. Wanting for the Uber to arrive. eventually after a while the Uber arrives, got in said hello in the back struggling staying awake. The driver said something to me but I didn‚Äôt realise because I was so exhausted to pay attention to whatever he was saying, the Uber realised it and was quiet for the rest of the drive checking if I didn‚Äôt fell asleep in his car drooling over the nice leather. while in the Uber I looked outside and I swore it felt like the mountains had eyes watching where I was going, was it that thing? At the end of the drive we finally reached my home, I thanked the Uber giving him 5 stars. My body desperately wanting sleep, I grabbed my keys staring for a moment that I don‚Äôt know how long I stared at them as I finally unlocked the front door. I took off my shoes and socks and put them in a small cabinet where I put my shoes and socks when I go out, and headed straight towards the room to have a shower. Once I enter I immediately stared to strip everything off and I noticed how pale my skin is, but after having a long shower my skin has gotten pinker from taking a hot shower for the night. Didn‚Äôt bother to do my night skin care routine as I rushed to my bed collapsing right on top as immediately went to sleep. While all of that was happening I had a dream that I was in a filed with blue painted grass in a school uniform while the clouds were made of fairy floss. In the far distance I could see a treehouse so I went towards it. As I finally arrived I quickly notice a child painting the grass blue, I asked a question ‚Äúwhat ya doing?‚Äù The child looks up and says ‚ÄúI like when the grass is blue much better than green since blue is more pretty than green‚Äú. Even though I could‚Äôt see my face I now I pulled a ‚Äúright‚Ä¶ sure.‚Äù face ‚ÄúIs there anything else after painting the grass blue?‚Äù I asked again, what he told me was a surprise ‚ÄúI thought fake dream people already know what I‚Äôm doing since I made you up in my mind‚Äù I was taken aback to that statement ‚ÄúI-i what are you talking I‚Äôm the real one you‚Äôre the fake not me‚Äù I looked up at the treehouse and saw it had a door. I decided to forget the kid and enter the treehouse, I climbed the ladder and reach my hand on the door and I opened it.

After opening the door I was in a heavily pure white hallway with music playing in the background, after listening to it the song‚Äôs lyrics is pretty safe and repetitive. I started to walk at my left and head towards what‚Äôs other there, after a bit of walking there was a door with a poorly spelled exit sign right above, I can hear crickets and birds tweeting beautifully.

Once I open a door I saw a man sitting in a wheelchair staring at fountain in a shape of a pretty woman holding a pot pouring out water, I walked to the man who has he‚Äôs head tilted with a big smile that looks like it‚Äôs pushing past he‚Äôs ears. I spoke to the man ‚ÄúHello my name is Jeremy what‚Äôs your‚Äôs?‚Äù He quickly turned he‚Äôs eyes which looked like a blur for almost a second, he told me he‚Äôs name is Bobby. He welcomes me to a place he‚Äôs parents call The castle of special minds and all who live here are gifted with nice servants. I later realised this is some kind of care facility that looks after people with special needs (he had Down syndrome if you wanted to know). I replied ‚ÄúWow that‚Äôs really cool where do I meet them?‚Äù he said ‚ÄùI don‚Äôt know where they are but they come back soom, hmm.‚Äù I decided to look around the place and when I checked the windows I saw something outside, it was blurry and in a far away distance but even then, I knew what it was.

It was the creature I had in my dreams cause I recognise the shape and see sand pouring down. I walked back holding onto my chest like it‚Äôs been shattered as I finally realised it‚Ä¶ it was that thing that caused me to experience these peoples dreams! I don‚Äôt know where this thing comes from or how it found me, but now I have this creature dragging me across dreams. I need to wake up somehow‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúHey mister hmm‚Äù Bobby spoke, ‚Äúwhy you have been staring outside for so long?‚Äù I stutter in my response ‚Äúuh i was just admiring the very pretty view outside‚Äù He accepted of what I said and proceeded to walk away to find a way out of‚Ä¶ this. While walking I started to feel like someone was stalking, as far as I can tell I was being paranoid because that entity, it was following me and delivering me to other dreams but not actually looking. At least that‚Äôs the logic behind it. There was another door with aquatic themes, don‚Äôt remember the details but I remember being very aquatic and because when I went through I was in a underwater base. Old and subtle with eeriness, the cool temperature blows on my face like a old fan in a summer‚Äôs day. Suddenly it hit me, when will I wake up? Dreams usually don‚Äôt last long so I would have been awake now, but yet in this path I‚Äôm still asleep.

I decided the only solution is to drown myself‚Ä¶ after walking around in this ruined water base I haven‚Äôt find my exit yet. As I was walking there was a sign up ahead and with its green glow I can see it reads ‚ÄúSubmarine exit‚Äú. I have found it my way out, so I opened the door found not the submarine but the door was opened. The dreamer must have escaped and so will I, noticing the switch I pulled it and there the floor opened like pearly gates of heaven. I jumped in with my mouth open so I can fill my lounges of the water. Even Though it took a few seconds I woke up from the dreams, I jolted up and noticed something. My clothes are wet then I started puking water. I wiped away the water change my clothes, I checked the time and saw it was almost 10 AM. I headed to the kitchen grabbed Wheet bix and some Barries in the fridge for breakfast, I spend the entire morning thinking of what happened. After putting on my clothes I headed to a local store for more food, while there I thought I saw something‚Ä¶ I stoped, looked back and it was just a large pile of mulch. I seriously need to get a hold on to myself, so I continue riding but still thinking about that thing, I finally arrived at the store. I checked my list and the words looked off, like it‚Äôs constantly changing its shape and even looked like the letters were changing. There was a old drinking water fountain outside and rubbed my face trying to see if that would wake me up. When I looked again it was back to normal‚Ä¶ Went back again, grabbed everything I needed and some M&Ms for a little snack to fill my sugar tooth. As I was reaching my bike I heard something I turned around, saw a can that has fallen to the flower, it gave me a bit of a fright. I need to calm down the nightmare is over. After arriving at home (packed everything away) I was using the bathroom, while doing my duty I accidentally hit the wall beside me, but the sound came from the door which was right a head of me. After quickly finishing I checked all over the house but found nothing, it feels like I‚Äôm losing my grip on reality so I headed to bed try to see if I can sleep it off. But when I was in a dream, while dreaming I was in a old hospital ward or what my mind could remember what it looked like, I looked around the room and left. I was in a hallway but it was all twisted and narrow, there was no where to go. I try to wake myself up:

slapping¬†my face

throwing water on my face

holding my breath¬†

There no glass or anything sharp to cut myself

So there was only one choice and so I Traveled through the hall, it got narrower the more I traveled, thankfully I‚Äôm skinny and short ( 5‚Äô5) but I could feel the harsh walls compressing me to fit. I also have to move my hands and legs over the floor that was sticking out and I keep bumping my legs into them. A couple of times I had to get into these awkward and nearly disjointed a couple of times. I finally made it to the other side there was the door from the start, I opened it and sand pouring out.

I walked through the sand with little effort, as I looked up looking at the flab monsters with serval mouths puking out sand. I continue to walking towards the giant monster he smelled Smokey, I heard 21% of people can smell something smoking or burnt. When I finally got closed enough a babel raised me up to what I considered a head length that of a starfish, it started speaking‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs ‚Äúname‚Äù is Baku‚Äôlu-thh and he says that it‚Äôs a primordial entity being around since the Big Bang started. He saw God and they spoke, but he didn‚Äôt become the Avatar of dreams and nightmares until creation started to dreams. Now he‚Äôs form is or existence is shaped by minds like us men and from others. He has been adopted to be the ambassador of dreams, it‚Äôs really hard to truly, can explain because he didn‚Äôt communicate anywhere I can‚Ä¶ or anyone truly can. After waking up all I know now is I can never have normal docile dreams and they only are getting worse.",1,1745751343.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,0.99,False

Then, in a flash, losing tens of thousands of dollars. Sounds familiar?

If you're also a single, solo-living trader, you surely understand this struggle: no one to stop you from going all-in, no one to remind you to log out Twitter at 2 AM.

So, why must traders like us practice self-discipline?

# Why Solo-Living Traders Need Self-Discipline

Living alone means no supervision.

No partner urging you to go to bed, no roommate complaining about your tenth cup of coffee.

Trading itself is a psychological marathon; without self-discipline, you will either burn out or lose your entire account.

Single traders face unique traps: endless screen time, emotional roller coasters, and the impulse to ‚Äújust check the charts one more time‚Äù at midnight.

Studies have shown that people who live alone are more prone to impulsive decisions‚Äîsuch as revenge trading after a loss.

# Three Self-Discipline Methods to Rescue Your Trading

1. **Set a hard stop time**: No trading after 7 PM, no exceptions.The market runs 24/7, but your brain doesn‚Äôt.Lock your phone in a drawer before bed to prevent yourself from checking the charts late at night or making FOMO-driven bad trades.Additional tip: Spend 5 minutes reviewing your trades before the market closes each day‚Äîlike hitting a reset button for your brain.
2. **Morning coffee ritual**:As a single person, of course no one is making you breakfast.Use that quiet time to perform a 15-minute morning ritual: meditate for 5 minutes, review your trading plan, and write down one goal for the day, like ‚Äúkeep risk under 2%.‚ÄùThere‚Äôs data showing that a morning ritual can boost efficiency by 20% (I saw it on r/ productivity).
3. **Record your emotions, not just your profits and losses**:A solo trader‚Äôs biggest enemy is themselves.You need to document your emotional state before and after each trade.Angry? Exhausted? Then skip the trade.This alone can reduce your losses by at least half.A trading psychology book mentioned that emotional management predicts returns better than technical analysis.

# The Advantages of Being a Solo Trader

On the flip side, being single and living alone has its advantages: freedom!

No distractions, no one questioning why you have five monitors.

Self-discipline can turn this freedom into your trading weapon.

Sure, you‚Äôll sometimes lose battles to Netflix or Reddit.

But by sticking to these habits, your trading will become more stable, and your account will grow steadily quarter by quarter.

If you‚Äôre a single, solo-living trader, how do you stay disciplined?

Do you have any late-night trading horror stories, or secret tricks to fight FOMO?

1k90xph,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1k90xph/travel_dates_sound_cute_and_fun_as_you_both_catch/,"Travel dates sound cute and fun as you both ""catch up"" with rare chats and liking each other's stories","Just sharing my story of when I met this guy while I was solo traveling in Japan. I can't say I've been on a lot of dates but so far, he's the only one who has treated me so well on one.

He's from Germany (M28, but is Vietnamese) and I'm (F27) from the Philippines. We matched on tinder and decided to meet up for coffee. I had low expectations tbh as it was my last day in Japan before flying back to the Philippines so I decided, why not let's go out. 

Now before you jump to conclusions, nothing sexual happened. We went out for a coffee first, which he gladly paid for, then we had dinner after. He also wanted to pay for that but I got shy so I sneakily went to the cashier and paid for it myself when he went to the bathroom haha. When he came back, I told him I already paid and he was surprised I did that cause he actually hid the bill in his pocket before he went to the bathroom. He was so nice though and said he had to get me dessert since I paid for it. And of course who would turn down a dessert right? So we left to go find a dessert place. It was kinda cute cause he ordered a strawberry Oreo cake and a strawberry drink that he offered to share with me but I was so full from dinner. I just stuck to plain old iced Americano to keep me awake as it was nearing midnight hahah

The whole time he was engaging me in a good back and forth conversation. We both clicked and shared some similarities of Vietnam and the Philippines. We asked about each other's jobs so I shared that I do research and he said he's a doctor. It was the first time I felt that I didn't have to think much and go with the flow. Have you ever felt like you're interviewing a guy a date or even in chat? It sucks, but thankfully he wasn't like that. 

Such a nice guy too cause he opened doors for me and pulled out chairs for me to sit in. The bar is low I know, but when you've been dating guys who just wants something sexual right off the bat, it felt so different for me. It was really nice to be with someone who didnt flirt their way through a conversation just so they can take you home and fuck. 

There was some flirting too, sure. I went in for hug when I met him at the spot where he was first waiting for me. He also kept touching my watch and sweater as he complimented my outfit.

It was already past midnight when we left the dessert place, and the staff wanted us out fast hahah. So we left and he walked me back to my hotel. Not gonna lie, I wanted to kiss him right then but I chickened out so I just gave him a hug. He said he had a good time and for us to catch up online, which I agreed to. Then that was it, the next morning I flew home back to the Philippines.

It's been a year since we met and since then we would just like each other's Instagram stories. A bit confusing though cause once, he messaged me after months of not talking. It was a reel about having a Filipina gf and said it reminded me of it. Since there was no any follow through, I didn't think much of it. 

One thing's for sure though, he did raise the bar for me when going on dates.

1k90urv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueArchive/comments/1k90urv/repent_part_3_remastered/,Repent part 3 [Remastered],"Hanako stopped in front of the door leading to Tea party's grand balcony. The brown antique style door was defiled by countless graffiti, wildly drawn in red paint that almost covered the high class wood.

**\[DIE. DIE. DIE.\]**

**\[DOWN WITH THE WITCH.\]**

**\[LEAVE TRINITY.\]**

**\[WE WON'T FOLLOW YOU.\]**

The writing was an absolute mess almost as if it was blood splatter, showing the sheer hatred behind the ones who wrote it. Hanako also saw hints of dried up saliva and dusty footprints on the lower side of the door. Some seemed they were over a day, and some seemed to be fresh, barely done ten minutes ago. If someone who didn't know any better saw this, they wouldn't think it'd be the entrance leading to the most prestigious and elegant leaders of Trinity, and more like something you'd find in a dirty, rat infested alleyway leading to a cheap, run down brothel that anyone with a braincell would know better to avoid.

Hanako: ""Pfft.""

Hanako couldn't help but to chuckle at the sheer absurdity. One of Trinity's most important places was vandalized this much, and yet there wasn't even an attempt to clean up this mess. Normally this kind of actions wouldn't have been allowed, let alone thought of in the first place. And by sheer coincidence a small smudge would appear on the door, the cleaning staff would instantly come rushing and within minutes, clean the door along with the entire room until everything was spotless. But the door seemed to be kept in this poor state for days. Enough so that the crude graffiti had completely dried down. And this all happened under Trinity's security. Hanako had yet heard of anyone being punished for neglection of work or even the vandalism itself. Nobody seemed to care.

This was what Tea party had become. Leadership that even low class janitors didn't respect... It seemed like such a bad joke that Hanako just had to laugh at it.

""Are you alright, Hanako-sama?""

Hanako: ""Fufu. I'm fine, thank you. Perfectly, fine.""

With a warm smile, Hanako dismissed one of the worried students that accompanied her. In fact she was surrounded in quite the number of people. Enough to make the wide, classy hallway feel a bit crowded.

Hanako: ""Now, shall we?""

**Fwoom-**

The messy wooden door flung open with a push from Hanako's hand. At the same time Nagisa and Seia flinched at Hanako's arrival, followed by the wave of at least twenty students rushing inside the room like a tidal wave, all heavily armed with their faces covered in gasmasks.

Nagisa: ""Hanako-san..?""

Seia: ""And, the Arius students..?""

The moment they occupied the grand balcony, half of the students from the Arius Branch aimed their guns towards the two members of Tea party. Both Nagisa and Seia quickly read the room that they meant business. Every single one of the student's fingers were itching for the trigger. They made no sudden movements and tried their best to remain calm. The last thing they needed was to aggravate a whole platoon that was waiting for an excuse to lynch them.

The other half swiftly formed a line of two, guiding a straight wide line in the middle so that Hanako could easily enter. Hanako walked until she was right in front of Nagisa and Seia. As she was the only one standing, Hanako was looking down at the nervous two leaders who was half forced to be seated. That difference alone gave Hanako an aura of authority over them.

After six months since the tea party trios had their deranged fun, and Hanako couldn't wait to demonstrate the long deserved consequences that awaited them. But instead of giving into her desires, Hanako greeted the two leaders with a kind, but far from genuine smile.

Hanako: ""Good afternoon, Kirifuji-san. Yurizono-san.

Justice was on her side. There was no reason for Hanako to sully her image because of petty impatience, when her revenge was already set in motion. She kept her mask on, enjoying every moment of seeing Nagisa and Seia's disturbed faces.¬†

Hanako: ""Next I'd ask Misono-san, but... it seems she's not here.""

Hanako's eyes narrowed as she saw Mika's vacant seat. Her fake smile fell for a slight second, frustrated that she couldn't see the guilt ridden look on Mika's face.

""Now that you mention it... Oi! Where is that witch?!""

One of the Arius students next to Hanako yelled at Nagisa about Mika's whereabouts. Her voice was void of any respect and manners as if treating a wanted criminal. Nagisa flinched at the insult towards her best friend as she shot a glare at the masked student. Except for Seia who clicked her tongue with distain at the mention of Mika.

Seia: ""Tsk. Probably being witch hunted as we speak.. Serves her ri-""

Nagisa: ""Seia-san! Hah... I understand the resentment you have against my friend, but Mika-san is a member of Tea party. I ask you to please address her with respect-""

**POW!**

Nagisa: ""Guh?!""

The Arius student hit the side of Nagisa's head with the butt of her rifle. Groaning in pain, Nagisa fell off her chair and onto the floor. The elegant teacup she held shattered on impact with the marble. It's warm contents spilling at her white outfit creating a light brown smudge.

Seia: ""Nagisa! W, What is the meaning of thi-""

Seia stood up in panic until she heard the click of a gun.

""SIT. DOWN.""

Another Arius student aimed the barrel of her gun at Seia right next to her left temple. Seia gulped in dry saliva as she was forced back into her seat. Meanwhile the student that struck Nagisa did the same thing, putting the Tea party leader in front of the mercy of her barrel. Nagisa and Seia turned to Hanako as she was the leader of the group. They looked at her helplessly, sending desperate looks with a message for help. But Hanako as she silently smiled, simply ignored it by turning her eyes away to enjoy the outside view.

""I should just shoot you. Like what you did to Saori's group... Do you think we forgot about them? The Arius squad that you've killed?""

Nagisa: ""W, What're you talking about...? It's Asuma Toki who's responsible for-""

**POW!**

Another blow was delivered to Nagisa, this time her right cheek.

Nagisa: ""Gak..!""

""Shut up.""

Nagisa spit out air and saliva as she withered in pain like a twitching bug. The Arius student that struck her was fuming in rage. The veins on her hands twitched wildly while her fingers being dangerously close to the trigger.

""Yes. That B\*TCH is the one who ended their lives. But what about you? The rest of the Tea party? Do you want us to believe that you didn't have a say in this?""

Both Nagisa and Seia twitched, as they realized the meaning behind her words. They quickly tried to hide their reactions but the truth was already out. The Arius student scoffed upon seeing their pitiful reaction.

""No, of course not. The Arius Branch is partially owned by Trinity. And nothing goes over Trinity without the Tea party's approval. There's no way you wouldn't have known that Millennium's C&C was after the Arius squad! Or maybe, it was the tea party who organized everything in the first place. To get rid of them. Us...""

Nagisa: ""It's.. It's nothing like that...""

Nagisa continued to deny it with her own words. Staying quiet only made it look as if she was acknowledging it. Deep in her mind, there was one thing that she never wanted to acknowledge.

Meanwhile, the Arius student's grip on her gun have tightened, straining the metal parts as it creaked in her hands. It aggravated her that Nagisa was still trying to talk, when her voice was the reason that made every student in this room want to strangle her. Soon she raised her gun holding arm to deliver another blow to Nagisa. Perhaps the throat this time so that the noisy leader could finally shut up.

""I thought I told you to shut up-""

Hanako: ""Hmm\~ I think that's enough, isn't it?""

Hanako said with a generous smile as she placed her hand on the Arius student's shoulder, making her stop midway from hitting Nagisa. The student turned her head to face Hanako for a swift second before backing away from Nagisa, swiftly calming down her anger as she acted with discipline once again.

""My apologizes, Hanako-sama. Please forgive me.""

The Arius student apologized by bowing down only to be lifted back up from Hanako.

Hanako: ""No no, don't be. I have nothing but gratitude for you and all of your sisters. Don't lower your head, not even myself. Stand proud, please.""

""H, Hanako-sama...""

The Arius student, including all the others was moved by Hanako's warm words. Some even openly cried in¬† beneath their masks. Everyone in Trinity, no all of Kivotos hated them. Even before, and after Eden treaty it was all the same. Sensei was the only one who truly cared about them, a small light of hope in the cold darkness. But after the faker appeared and stole his authority along with the heart of the students, that little speck of light have also been taken away. And after the entire Arius squad had been killed of 'attempted terrorism', their treatment have become WORSE, if that was even possible. Everyday was a living hell until the faker died, and three weeks later, sensei's return.

Not only was Sensei treating and funding them even better than before, there was now Hanako, one of the few ones who stayed loyal leading them. She was nothing like Beatrice. A kind and wise leader. She promised to improve their treatment along with Trinity, and that was exactly what she did. It was almost like a dream, like the several years of torment was all but a bad nightmare. And today, it marked the start of a new day. One that even themselves could hope to dream.

Hanako: ""Now, back to business at hand..""

Hanako turned to Nagisa and Seia, still keeping the same smile on her face. But the warmth and kindness had completely washed away, and in it's stead, cold, calculative malice have taken it's place. Nagisa and Seia twitched in an unknown fear. There was a certain joy on Hanako's face, like a mischievous child that can't wait to pull a prank. And of course, hatred. Those two combined... They couldn't tell just what Hanako had in store for them.

Hanako: ""Would you kindly take a look at this, Kirifuji-san, Yurizono-san.""

After getting handed from one of the Arius students, Hanako placed a set of files on the table for Nagisa and Seia to see. Some cautious looks to the Arius students later, Nagisa managed to get up and Seia to leave her chair. The two were free to walk to the part of table where the papers were placed, soon reading into the papers themselves. It did not take long before their faces turned pale, eyes turning towards Hanako in disbelief.

Nagisa: ""Fifty percent of Tea party's authority will be entrusted to the new member, Urawa Hanako?!""

Seia: ""Cosigned by... Schale and the GSC...""'

It was official paperwork of Hanako's entry as the fourth and most authorized member of Tea party. Backed up by Schale and the GSC's approval, the terms were basically set in stone.

But there was a sliver lining for the current Tea party. Hanako's authority was still fifty percent, which meant she wasn't in full control of Tea party, and ultimately Trinity. Besides that, it wasn't going to be easy for Hanako with just the approval of outside forces. This was an issue taken within Trinity. Meaning it was ultimately decided by Trinity's students, the presidents from the clubs within the academy. Even if Hanako became the head of Tea party, without the club's approvals it was impossible to lead Trinity all on her own. If the clubs and luck were on their side, it was possible for Nagisa and Seia to make it a sixty to fourty against Hanako. And if they could snap Mika out of her demented state, convincing her to rejoin them, they could even look forward to a seventy percent.

Nagisa: ""You are.. very formidable, Hanako-san, but this papers won't do much good as you've thought. You cannot just ignore Trinity's long respected traditions.""

Seia: ""If you're planning to lead this academy, then you must follow Trinity's law. Come back after you've persuaded the clubs.""

Hanako: ""Fufu\~ And if you'll take a look on the next page\~""

As Hanako said, there was a few more pages Nagisa and Seia had yet to see. They quickly flipped to the next page which shocked them even more. It was the signatures from all the students and presidents of every important clubs in Trinity. A perfect match of every distinct handwriting. All signed in agreement of Hanako.¬†

Seia: ""This is... The JTF.. Sisterhood... Remedial Knights... They all signed... To you..?""

Nagisa: ""W, When did you...""

Hanako: ""Fufu, on the way here, of course\~ They were all so eager to sign, some have came to me first before I even stopped by their club! Do you know that it barely took me an hour to get all their signatures until I came here? Fufu, I'm so delighted that everyone's looking forward to working with me\~""

Nagisa and Seia stood defeated, dropping the papers as it slipped from their fingers. All their energy, their hopes drained away from them with every passing second. Their plans of ever rivaling Hanako was doomed before it even began. With all the important clubs now backing Hanako, she was the one to be the seventy to their measly thirty.

Soon Hanako picked up the papers and kept it, as there was no reason to show it to the two 'former' leaders anymore. And she already got what she wanted. The hopeless faces of the queen serpents. Their powers being stripped away right in front of them.

Hanako: ""So you see, Kirifuji-san. Yurizono-san. I guess you can say, **THE GAME WAS RIGGED FROM THE START**.""

If Nagisa and Seia's eyes weren't filled with fear, they certainly were now. Except for a grand welcome ceremony, at this point Hanako was basically the new leader of Trinity. Which meant, their fates were solely on the mercy of Hanako's. The memories of the old records flooded their heads, preparing for the worst. And what could be more worse in Trinity than 'that'. Nagisa and Seia began to tremble uncontrollably. Along with the horrifying words that plagued Trinity's history, which could possibly be the very fate that awaited them.

**The Justina council of saints. And it's revival.**

Nagisa: ""What... What're you going to do with us...?""

Seia: ""R, Remember. W, We're not sinners...""

Hanako: ""Hmm? What's the matter? Nobody said anything about doing something to you, Kirifuji-san, Yurizono-san. Are you maybe afraid that you'll be kicked out of Tea party? Please, why would anyone do something so ridiculous? You will always be the shining example that everyone in Trinity aspires to be! Nobody can take that away\~""

Contrast to their fearful faces, Hanako smiled innocently as if she was oblivious why they would be afraid in the first place. Then she took each of Nagisa and Seia's hand into hers, holding them gently like a loving mother would.

Hanako: ""I'm just here to show how happy I am to be a part of this little club\~ Nobody's taking over anything, so relax\~ There's no need to feel threatened\~ In fact, we should be celebrating!""

Gleefully, Hanako pulled in Nagisa and Seia to give them both a big hug. At that very moment, Hanako's whispered into their ears in a voice that was almost to the point of being monotone. It was so calm and void of emotions. A direct contrast to her previous act, and it was downright frightening for the former Tea party leaders, trembling in fear.

Hanako: ""I'm only going to say this once, so listen carefully. You are going to follow every single one of my orders from now on without question. Don't ask. Don't even think. Just do as I say. Like how you've all been doing right now. I'm sure brainless birds like you are capable of doing that.""

Nagisa: ""I knew it..! Why would we follow-""

Seia: ""Understood..""

Nagisa: ""S, Seia-san..?""

Unlike Nagisa, Seia weakly nodded, pledging loyalty to Hanako without hesitation as if she'd just given up.

Seia: ""Look at us, Nagisa... We're not in any position to argue.. We failed sensei. We failed Trinity...""

Nagisa: ""Y, You can't..! How can you call yourself a part of Tea party if you're just going to give up that easily..!""

Then, gritting her teeth in anger, Seia glared at Nagisa as if one of those words had struck a nerve inside her.

Seia: ""Give up? Like how you and Mika did, by constantly pushing me to interact with that vile man? If it weren't for you two I would've stayed loyal to sensei!""

Nagisa: ""D, Don't blame this on me..! I know the way you saw that man everytime he visited! If you hated it so much, why didn't you push him away?!""

Seia: ""Why you..! Oof-""

Nagisa: ""Gah..!""

Hanako: ""Are we done bickering like children?""

Before they could raise their voices any further, Hanako physically silenced both Nagisa and Seia by choking them with her hands while hugging. Only after they nodded to behave, then Hanako released their fragile necks from her grasp. Hanako kept whispering and urged the two to follow foot.

Hanako: ""You two don't seem to understand how dire you really are. So I'll help you understand. **I KNOW.""**

Nagisa: ""Ex, Excuse me..?""

Hanako: **""That tea party provided intelligence of the Arius squad. The day before their deaths by Asuma Toki.""**

Nagisa& Seia: ""Wha-""

Nagisa and Seia's halo flickered for a short second. They haven't said anything about the subject, yet the trembling of their bodies didn't seem to stop as their hearts raced faster by every second.

Hanako: ""Shh shh.. Keep your voices down.. We don't want anyone hearing this, do we? Sure, everyone's doubting how Tea party couldn't have known about the Arius squad's impending doom. Some say Tea party had direct involvement with their deaths. But since there's no actual proof, it's only speculations at best. Unless, someone has access to those evidence..?""

Nagisa: ""N, Nonsense..! We were not involved with the Arius squad..!""

Hanako: ""Then why do you look so nervous, Kirifuji-san? And Yurizono-san?""

Seia: ""L, Leave me out of this... I, I already made my decision to follow you..!""

Hanako: ""Fufu. That you did. Now that just leaves you, Kirifuji-san.""

As if she'd lost interest, Hanako let Seia free from her embrace, leaving the petite Tea party leader crawl up into a fetal position as she broke down in tears. Now it was just Nagisa in Hanako's arms, the two shackles that will never let her go until she got the answers she wanted.

Hanako: ""You like suspecting things don't you, Kirifuji-san? Well, try to suspect that there IS an evidence that links the Arius squad's death to Tea party. And suspect what would happen if it goes PUBLIC. Wouldn't that make you and Yurizono-san, 'sinners'? Just like Misono-san? What would sensei think of you? What would... **HIFUMI-SAN THINK OF YOU? DO YOU THINK SHE'D EVER WANT TO BE FRIENDS WITH YOU EVER AGAIN?**""

Nagisa: ""Ahh... Ahhh...""

Nagisa broke down in tears like a helpless baby. Her unwavering pride of the Tea party had become like the shattered teacup on the floor. Nothing more than useless trash. Hanako couldn't care less how she just utterly destroyed Nagisa. All she cared about was receiving a straight answer from her. Her vows of obedience.

Hanako: ""So? Your answer?""

Nagisa: ""What.. Whatever you say, Hanako-sama...""

**Hanako: ""...Fufu. GOOD GIRL.""**

After stroking her long hair gently like a girl would do to her favorite doll, Hanako released Nagisa, who then covered her entire face with both hands as she cried her eyes out.

Hanako: ""Could you kindly escort these two outside? It seems they're in need of fresh air. Everyone else, too. I would appreciate if you'd offer me some time alone.""

""As you wish, Hanako-sama.""

Hanako said as she turned to the Arius students, and they followed by taking Nagisa and Seia out the door as well as themselves. Almost pushing them to keep walking, like one would treat a criminal.

Now that she was finally alone, Hanako let out a huge sigh.

She then calmly took her rifle, releasing the safety, and aimed it at the luxurious tea table.

**DUUDUUDUUDUUDUUDUU!!!**

**CLANG!!**

**CHANG!!**

**KRAK!!**

Hanako unloads all of her bullets onto the Tea party‚Äôs meeting balcony. Destroying the fancy table, seats, and expensive silverware into pieces.

Whenever she ran out, she reloaded and continued to fire again. She was going to make sure that everything would be destoryed.

Hanako: ""Haa.. Haa..""

After her gun rang empty, she threw it to the side while looking down at the destruction as she gasped for air.

The horrid images played inside Hanako's head. She could see it right now. Trinity's finest trio misusing their authorities, wasting the school's precious resources solely to pleasure that silver tongued snake. They'd praise him of his accomplishment, which was only capable because of sensei. They'd laugh, make fun of sensei of how inferior he is, after everything he's done for the students, bringing order and hope to Kivotos and it's inhabitants. And they'd moan. Flesh mingling with flesh, whispering treacherous love for each other as they defiled this honorable place with disgusting lies and selfish lust. A place that once meant something, open only to those who are ready to withstand the responsibility. And the three turned it into something vile and unforgivable.

Just thinking about the betrayal have brought blood to Hanako. Biting her lower lips, the bitter taste of blood spreading in her mouth. Her nails digging through her hands, the lukewarm liquid dripping onto the white marble floor.

Hanako: ‚ÄúI thought we made a difference. With sensei‚Äôs help, I truly believed that this place was no longer a snake pit. But no, it was a goddamn Hydra‚Äôs nest. Cut a serpent‚Äôs head, and two more will take it‚Äôs place... No matter. Then I shall crush, burn, and grind their heads to dust, so that they‚Äôll never think of hurting sensei, ever again. If I have to lead these twisted serpents to achieve it, then so be it.‚Äù

The head of the Tea party. The new leader of Trinity was born. And she promised two things under her new rule.

**Forever ensuring sensei's position of power and authority, by using the vile serpents she hated. And punishing those who have, and will dare challenge her law, until everyone in Trinity became 'Good little girls'.**¬†

**Hanako: ""Sensei.. I'll make sure this won't happen again... I swear it..""**

¬†

Hifumi: ""Phew... I think that's everything.. All but, this one..""

Hifumi wiped off the sweat from her brow, before taking one last look of her precious Peroro backpack. Except for the essentials, her room was now as bland as the day she first entered Trinity. All her Peroro merchandise that gave her private space color and life, was neatly organized inside a box, leaving only the backpack in her hands, which she had carried it with her everyday.

Hifumi: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, Peroro sama. But for the sake of sensei, I have to do everything that I can to help him. I have to become more capable than... ‚Äòthat‚Äô person.""

Her hands gripped the backpack with bitter resentment, but not enough to actually harm her precious Peroro-sama. The promised time with Hanako was coming closer. She was going to be late until she made a decision, but it was harder than she'd thought. She didn't want to leave Peroro-sama behind. But at the same time, the stronger part of herself reminded the promise she had made.

That she has to grow up.

Hifumi: ""Even if it means I have to... leave you here... B, But I promise I‚Äôll come back to see you! Everyday! So please... wait for me here, okay?‚Äù

Hifumi gives her prized Peroro backpack one big hug, before putting it inside the box. Her hands shook in hesitation, but she managed to place the box inside the closet, and for the first time left the room without the reassuring presence of Peroro by her side.

It wasn't her last goodbye, as Hifumi will see Peroro-sama again tonight. But this was a small, but big step that even she did not realize. That would give her the resolve and strength to withstand the unknown paths that laid before her.

As Hifumi headed to where Hanako was, she met Nagisa who was just on her way to meet her dear friend.

She certainly had seen better days. Her beautiful hair was untreated and messy like the strains from a broom. Her white classy uniform was dirty with a noticeable light brown smudge on it. And now that she's able to take a good look at Nagisa, her cheek had fresh bruises as if she'd just got beaten up. She seemed more like a patient who escaped a mental hospital, rather than one of the high class leaders of Trinity.¬†

Nagisa: ""H, Hifumi-san...? Hifumi-san!!""

Nagisa noticed Hifumi as she ran to her close friend with delight, only for Hifumi to walk past her, as if she was a stranger.

Hifumi: ""...""

Nagisa: ""H, Hifumi-san...""

Nagisa‚Äôs face twisted with despair.

Nagisa: ""D, Don't go! I want to apologize, so please..!""

Her eyes started to water as she desperately held onto Hifumi‚Äôs hand, in which Hifumi immediately swatted the delicate hand away like some kind of filth, looking at her as well.

Hifumi: ‚ÄúNagisa-sama. No, Kirifuji-san. Sensei trusted you, and you betrayed his trust... You betrayed my trust...! I don‚Äôt, I don‚Äôt want to see you... **I... I HATE YOU!!**‚Äù

After yelling out her venom filled words, Hifumi ran towards the opposite direction.

Nagisa: ""Ahh... Ahhh... **AHHHHHHHH!!!!**""

Nagisa‚Äôs gut wrenching cries behind her, but Hifumi covered her ears to block it. If she haven't she would've want to look back.

Hifumi: ""Why... Why did things have to be this way...""

Almost out of breath she stopped, leaning against a lamppost to take a breather. It broke Hifumi‚Äôs heart that she had just expressed the person that she had looked up to with so much hate, something that Hifumi herself didn‚Äôt know she had.

This was wrong. This wasn't her. The despair and pain ate at her from the inside. But soon Hifumi struck her chest with her fist as if to put a stop to it. It was slow, but eventually it ceased.

Even all of this. The pain and misery infecting Kivotos. Just like the pain on her chest, it was going to pass. Hifumi had no doubt that it will.¬†¬†

Hifumi: ""...I have to become stronger. For sensei.. For everyone..!""

She swallowed the tears that started to well up, hoping for a day that they could put aside all of this and become friends again. With that goal in mind, Hifumi walked forward with determination.

¬†

¬†

In an isolate alleyway, Azusa loads an array of explosives, weapons and unknown canisters inside a big black duffel bag. Besides the dangerous objects, were five head shots of the C&C and blue schematics for five different buildings. Out of the five photos, one that belonged to a certain Asuma Toki, a knife sized hole had punctured the emotionless girl‚Äôs forehead.

Azusa: ‚ÄúSaori. Atsuko. Hiyori. Misaki. Wherever you are, I hope you‚Äôve found peace there. I‚Äôm sorry I wasn‚Äôt there to protect you... ASUMA TOKI. I‚Äôm coming for you. I won‚Äôt kill you, oh no. You don‚Äôt deserve the release of death. I won‚Äôt risk the likes of you to set foot in the same place as my fallen sisters. As the sole survivor of the Arius squad, **I‚ÄôLL SHOW YOU THE TRUE MEANING OF DESPAIR**.‚Äù

Azusa zipped the duffle bag shut and lifted it on her shoulders with ease. Wearing a black and blue cap as she disappeared among the crowd.

¬†

Koharu shoves all her belongings that she had left at the JTF club room. After her bag is full she heads for the exit, determined to never come back. Hasumi tries to stop her from leaving, to maybe reason with her. But as her hand got closer to Koharu, she slaps it away from her.

Koharu: ‚ÄúDON‚ÄôT TOUCH ME! I, I looked up to everyone... I wanted to be just like senpais...! To one day become as strong as senpais, so that I could protect the ones I care about...! I might not be as bright, but even I know what justice is! To do the right thing! What senpais did to sensei, to me and the Make up club... wasn‚Äôt justice. If that‚Äôs what this club stands for...

**THEN YOU ALL DESERVE THE DEATH PENALTY**.‚Äú

Koharu storms out of the club with no one able to stop her.

Meanwhile at Gehenna, the sound of sharp shattering rang inside the Prefect office.

Ako: ""Kyah!""

Hina: ""Do it again.""

Ako stumbled as hot coffee was spread all over her face after Hina threw the cup straight to her face and shattering it. Chinatsu and Iori was also present in the office but either one didn't dare run out to help Ako, as it would make them Hina's new target.

Soon Ako calmed down along with the coffee's heat on her face. She was about to walk back to her desk and continue the paperwork, but today she stood her ground. It has been two weeks of constant abuse from Hina, and she had reached her limit to stay quiet. Hina also noticed the change of attitude as her eyes narrowed to see what kind of excuses her previous secretary had to say.

Ako: ""I' I only partook in the agreement to protect you, head prefect....""

Hina: ""You don't honestly think I'd believe that.""

Hina scoffed as if she heard a bad joke. Ako flinched as her confession was shot down from the start, but once her feelings have started to leak out there was no stopping it.

Ako: ""If you would've just pretended to follow, they would've left you alone. I didn't know that Trinity trash would do that to you! Believe me, I fought hard for you!""

Hina: ""Then maybe you should've fought HARDER.""

No matter what Ako said, it all fell to deaf ears for Hina. The sorrow inside Ako that had been building up for the past weeks had finally reached the boiling point, as Ako's feelings came flooding out as well as her tears.¬†

Ako: ""...! It's not my fault! Why are you treating me like this!? My loyalty was always with you! So why're you abandoning me!""

**GRAB**

A swift ‚Äòkick‚Äô to Ako‚Äôs leg later Hina 'stood up', strangling Ako's neck with her right hand. There was no flesh and bones beneath her lower thighs, but instead sleek black metal. Her supposed to be gone legs have been replaced with advanced prosthetics made by Millennium's Engineering club. Every parts was freely movable from the top and ten toes on the bottom, including sensors that replaced the severed nerves of her legs. With a sleek design it was extremely sturdy and light, able to match Hina's speed and power in combat. The pure black color of the mechanical legs have added to Hina's intimidating aura, sending fear to her enemies and her traitorous subordinates.

**Hina: ""...Hiyori. Misaki. Atsuko. Saori. The few ones who fought for sensei... ALL DEAD! Everyone else, hurt sensei and the others, including me! WHERE WERE YOU, AKO? YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO HELP US!! WHERE WERE YOU WHEN SENSEI AND I NEEDED YOU THE MOST?! WITH THEM! PRETENDING TO BE SOMEONE THAT YOU'RE NOT! YOU. ABANDONED. ME.""**

**Open-**

Koharu: ""Uh, is this the prefect- Ugyaah?! W, What's going on??""

Koharu screamed out loud at the sight of Ako being chocked right after she entered the room. Hina loosened her grip on Ako while the other two prefect members immediately turned to face the shocked Koharu, as it was certainly a surprise why a Trinity student would come to Gehenna, and the Prefect club no less.

Hina: ""You're... Shimoe Koharu..? All of you, OUT!!""

On Hina's command, the three prefect members rushed out the door without making a sound. Koharu stood in place stealing glances at the still open door.

Koharu: ""D, Does that include me..?""

Hina: ""No, you just got here. Come on in.""

Hina returned back to her desk as she welcomed Koharu inside, the demon like face she showed to Ako had calmed down greatly and showed a genuine smile to Koharu. The gap of Hina's attitude was so vast that Koharu hesitated to enter right away, taking a whole ten seconds to muster her courage to just enter.

Hina: ""So, how can I help you?""

Koharu: ""...Okay.. Hina-san! Please train me!!""

Hina: ""...Huh..?""

Out of the blue, Koharu begged Hina to train her. Hina was caught off guard by the young Trinity student that suddenly barged in the room, and was now kneeling in front of her. Groveling with her head almost planted to the ground.

Hina: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I don‚Äôt understand. Why do you want me to train you?‚Äù

Koharu: ‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm weak! If I had done something... If I was more stronger...! I could‚Äôve saved the people Azusa cared about! I, I don‚Äôt want to experience that anymore... I boast about being an elite, but right now, I‚Äôm useless... That‚Äôs why I want to become stronger.. More than my senpais! So that I can protect sensei and everyone when it matters! But... I don‚Äôt have a lot of people who I can count on... So please...!‚Äù

Hina kept silent for a good thirty seconds. Koharu fidgeted nervously, worrying if Hina would refuse her offer.

Hina: ‚Äú...Haah... I guess I‚Äôll have to change my schedule...‚Äù

Then Hina finally showed a reaction, taking a closer look at the calendar on her desk, until turning back to Koharu as she gave her answer.

Koharu: ‚ÄúHuh...? Y, You mean...!‚Äù

**Hina: ‚ÄúEveryday. 10pm. Make sure you‚Äôre not late.‚Äù**

Koharu: ‚ÄúO, Okay! Thank you!‚Äù

¬†\---

The same day, Koharu finds Wakamo and gives her the same favor and reasoning. Her left eye, covered in a flower engraved black eyepatch, Wakamo lends out her hand as she lifts Koharu off the ground.

Wakamo: ‚ÄúVery well. If you could become someone suitable enough to protect my darling, I will happily oblige.‚Äù

Koharu: ‚ÄúD, Darling!? You mean, sensei!? I, Indecent! Death penal-!‚Äù

Wakamo: ‚ÄúI BEG YOUR PARDON?‚Äù

Wakamo shot a death glare at Koharu, freezing the trinity student's lips before she could finish. Koharu's high pitched voice immediately shriveled to a whisper as she took back what she said.

Koharu: ‚ÄúN, Never mind...‚Äù

Wakamo: ‚ÄúJust so to be clear. I have no intention on going easy on you, no matter how much you cry. Darling‚Äôs life could be on the line, and I will do whatever it takes so that you‚Äôll be worthy enough for that responsibility. Do you understand?‚Äù

Koharu: ‚Äú...I do. I won‚Äôt quit, no matter what.‚Äù

Wakamo: ‚Äú...I thought you were just a helpless chick the first time I saw you. But now, I‚Äôm beginning to believe you just might have what it takes to become a hawk. Better than that pink haired vulture, that‚Äôs for sure...‚Äù

Though their paths were different, the make up club, the new rising stars of Trinity have chosen their way. Not knowing what their decisions would bring to the future of Kivotos.",5,1745749664.0,BlueArchive,6,0.78,False

1k90u1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKJobs/comments/1k90u1y/tedious_recruitment_process/,Tedious recruitment process,"Hello,

I'm going through a recruitment process at the moment which I find it to be unnecessarily tedious.

It's a 6-months temp role advertised as 'ASAP start date' by a high-profile recruitment agency on behalf of a large, well-known UK company. The job involves preparing some new computers for IT dept to replace the old ones.

Timeline:

I applied for the role.

1 DAY LATER: 1st agency phone call 'to gather some details about you

1 WEEK LATER: 2nd phone call from agency to arrange a phone interview with the agency

1 DAY LATER: 3rd phone call (phone interview with agency based on STAR method)

1 DAY LATER: 4th phone call from agency to arrange an interview with employer

1 DAY LATER: received email from agency with subject 'Coffee Chat' and Microsoft Teams details (it will be remotely)

...to be continued.

That's exactly 2 calendar weeks of hoops and loops so far.  
  
Am I too impatient or this is how crazy the recruitment process is today? It's a temp and very basic role after all. Also, 'Coffee Chat'? Is this serious or they're running a social club?

I am skeptical also because a few months ago I applied to another role advertised by agency. After a couple phone calls and a face-to-face interview with employer (small, local, family-run company), I got an email after several days saying 'the role is on hold' and that was the end. All along I had a sense of 'we're not actually hiring, just like to meet new people for a chit-chat'.

Thanks!
