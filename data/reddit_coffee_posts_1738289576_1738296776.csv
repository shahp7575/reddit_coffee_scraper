We’ve had him now for 4 weeks and he will not come out from underneath the coffee table we have in the corner of the living room. We take him out on a leash to go to the bathroom and he does okay. We have another dog Redneck that’s a border collie lab mix that doesn’t bother him at all. I know he’s not scared of him because we take them out together and they walk side by side touching. 

I’m wondering what we can do? He will occasionally take a treat from our hand but doesn’t like to be pet. Under no circumstances will he come out from under the table unless we put the leash on him to go out. We took him to my mom’s house one day to let the dogs run together in the yard and after a few sniffs and a pee he ran and found the farthest corner sit and hide. He stayed in the same spot four 4 hours until we put the leash on him and left.  

Today we got him a bed to put under the table for him to make it a little more comfortable and he ran under the kitchen bar chair and hasn’t moved.

You don't have to read it. 

It's to keep me accountable for tracking changes/progress,etc. And maybe something will resonate or click for you on occasion. I just like this reddit community cuz we are all wading in the same crap.

Today marks the 2nd day of full awareness of silent reflux being a major contributing inflammation marker for me. All thanks to some redditor who recently wrote about their experience. I then realized my mega flare started around the same time I started a 5 day z pack for a tooth infection. And then got worse after another round of Augmentin by some crooked ENT. For months I had a dry cough and mega inflammation. Face tingling too. I did NOT think the reflux was causing my symptoms to be worse, because I already been suffering for years. This was just a little stronger flare up I thought. Wrong.

So anywho, today was mostly a good day. I had no coffee this morning, went to PT. I got my ears,jaw and neck needled, told my PT my c2 was rotated which he confirmed and adjusted. I felt so great after I ran 2 miles and then bought myself a honey cinnamon latte. Well I didn't need the latte at all. I'm just an addict whose winning on their first day trying to quit coffee for a while for the reflux. It didn't take long to taste the acid in my mouth. 

I still felt mostly great,got a lot of work done, and let my 7 and 9 year old beat the shit out of me at the gym pool...that i regret. I have small headache right now and muscle twitches above both eyes. Good job dad. I also really wanted a peanut butter banana smoothie at gym after I wallowed in pity over my wrestling match in the pool. Soooo now I gotta wait at least another hour or so before I lay down and taste some yummy acid. Maybe I'll pop a Nasty Tum. I heard those things can screw your stomach over time if abused. Can't be worse then daily ibuprofen I guess. 

Im gonna try NOT drinking a latte tomorrow or a peanut butter smoothie at 8 pm. GOALS.

I hope everyone had a decent day.

It’s just CHAI!

At least where I live Chai is a type of tea, or a flavour used in desert or coffee shop beverages (not even necessarily tea)

Was this correct and if so can someone give me a more linguistic explanation.

(Part 1),"When I first started doing freelance journalism Terry and I agreed that if anything interesting ever happened to him I got to report it first. 

“Eric, if I kick the can in a fantastic way, I’ll put it in my will that if anyone reports on it before you that my family will sue their ass. ” I remember him saying. (I doubt that’ll hold up in court though, but it's the thought that counts.) 

So when the Cargo ship he worked on was discovered deserted I knew it was time to take him up on his promise.

When the rescue team let it slip that they discovered a detailed journal in his bunk I did what any self respecting journalist would do and harassed them and the coast guard for several months until I finally got my hands on a copy. 

Terry was a great friend, even though after college we drifted apart I will always love him and cherish our time together. When I heard he’d started going to school to become a cargo ship deck officer I wasn’t overly surprised, he was always the kid in class coming in every month with a different broken bone and a hell of a story. 

He had talked about his love for travel and adventure so much it only seemed like the perfect fit for him. I remember him telling me that all he wants in life is to be remembered, moralized in some way even if it is just in the memory of his loved ones. 

In the spirit of him being remembered I have transcribed the entirety of his journal below. I not only do this to honor my friend, but because if what he describes in this journal is true? the world needs to know.

    They stuck the newbie with the early morning and midnight rotation. I can’t say they didn’t warn me when I was doing my practicum with APM. 

“I’m not doing that shit, get the rookie to do it” Carlos told the pilot Benjamin.

What Carlos lacks in subtlety he makes up for in knowledge and work ethic. He had been used to AB life for 2 decades. No one knows his age, I guessed mid 50s but everytime someone asks he gives a different answer, when I asked he told me he was 15.

“Not my problem, talk to the new Master, I’m sure hearing your bitching is the first impression he needs.” Benjamin responded.

Ben was a lanky white dude that wouldn’t look out of place drinking gluten free beer at an indie rock concert. He’s the closest to me in age, only being 2 years older than me, and honestly even though he looks kinda like a douche I he’s one of the better guys to talk to.

“Have any of you guys met the new master yet?” I asked.

“Nope.” Carlos responded, pouring his second coffee of the day. 

“Don’t even know his name, they don’t tell us shit.” Ben added clicking the mouse on the control panel. 

There’s about 20 guys on staff on the ship, most of them old timers like Carlos, only one rookie besides me. Sam, he graduated the same year I did and from all I could gather in the 30 second conversation we had in line at the mess hall isn’t much for talking. 

Not rude by any means, just keeps to himself. I think he chose this job to get away from people, can’t blame him. I guess we all have our specific reasons for being here. 

After a while more of chatting shit and dodging Carlos’s putrid smelling hug of gratitude after I agreed to switch to the night watch for him. The new master walked in. Of course everyone is new to me but when he walked in I felt oddly better, like I wasn’t the odd man out anymore and that the old timers and I had something we could both agree on. That being the new master looked like a complete ass. 

He was a tall skinny guy with oddly broad shoulders, his buzz cut seemingly keeping his head from exploding from its own inflated sense of self. 

He wore a spotless white pilots jacket with long black trousers and carried his pilot's hat in his hand. 

Ben and Carlos immediately shot each other looks, waiting for the other person to break out into laughter. The master was dressed like he had just come from a stock photo shoot and had never even seen a cargo ship before. 

“Gentleman, my name is Captain James Pettersson. It’s an honor to pilot this fine vessel.” He said with his perfect posture revealing his previous military experience.

“That’s actually my job.” Ben said, easing his hand awkwardly. 

“Well of course!” Captain James— no that’s too weird I’m just gonna call him James— said making his way over to the front of the bridge. 

Feeling the awkward silence grew heavier than the ship I decided I needed to leave. 

“Well I better go do my rounds.” I said to no one’s reaction, Carlos was still holding back laughter as he finished up his watch log notes. 

Opening the metal sliding door on the starboard side of the bridge I immediately realized we may be in port for quite some time. A thick fog had descended on the entire port, I couldn’t even see the 40 foot containers in the shipping yard just over the railing. 

The air was crisp and chilly with the never ending sounds of New York posing as an infinite soundtrack to our work. 

Walking from line to line checking the auto-tension is still working properly (it almost always is) I got an odd feeling of dread. 

It was probably just new job anxieties not helped with the ere setting surrounding me. Walking through the deck I realized just how thick the fog actually was, the only visible objects in my line of sight were the railing around the bow of the ship leading to white fog so thick it looked more like a blank piece of paper than one of the busiest ports in the country. 

Finishing my round I reported to the bridge, Carlos was gone, Ben was still at his post drawing busy looking doodles on a piece of paper. James was standing straight with his hands clasped behind his back and staring out at the white cloud surrounding our ship.

“Hoping the fog clears sooner rather than later.” He said trying to cut through the silence that fell on the bridge since his arrival.

“A vessel like this yearns for the sea” James adds. 

Ben dropped his head in his hands in exhaustion. 


Feb 24th, 2024.

Holy shit was I right that we weren’t leaving port for a while, I just got off assisting with departure. 

James was on the verge of canceling the whole departure until the fog finally began to lift at around 1 pm today.

When I got there Carlos was ranting to Sam who had a look of either fear or annoyance in his eyes. I didn’t hear much of what he said but something about him was “a fine woman waiting for me in Manhattan.” And that he wanted the departure would just get cancelled already.

When I saw the fog lifted, it lifted just enough for the crane operators to actually see where they were loading the crates onto the cargo line, the fog was still present throughout departure. 

The white mist in the distance seemingly rendered the beautiful New York City skyline as we went for a visual treat for our tired eyes.

Now just the simple 15 day trek to Dublin!

Feb 27th, 2024.

Something is wrong with Sam. His watch notes are getting shorter and shorter. He has been missing random information in the last three entries. First he missed the hatch status, then he didn’t mention if there was any discharge in the VCP. 

Stuff that's easy to forget when we first start out, but when I tried to mention it to him in the mess hall today he just didn’t say anything, just sitting there staring at me with his blank expression. I’m not sure why but the look he gave me freaked me out. He just looked at me like I was speaking an alien language and like he was trying to kill me with his eyes. 

Safe to say, I’m staying the fuck away from that weirdo until he hit Ireland. 


March 9th, 2024. 

Sorry for the lack of entries, it’s hard thinking of interesting ways to write the same day over and over. 

Big development though… We hit Dublin! 

James is still the Hollywood trope equivalent of a ship captain. The other day I saw him leaning over the radar with his head in his hands in utter confusion. As soon as he noticed me there he sprang up like a soldier at attention. 

I never saw exactly what he was looking at but it clearly confused him. We were in the middle of the atlantic, the ocean can have odd effects on people, maybe he was just looking for a path between other ships. 

“Everything okay?” I asked

“Of course, She’s running like a dream!” he said with an air of delusional confidence. 

Good enough for me. Weirdo.

Oh also can’t forget Sam, his watch notes are still missing shit and honestly I’m too scared to call him on it, he definitely seems the type to “accidentally” push you overboard when you're going for a smoke. 

Anyway this port is pretty busy so we are probably gonna be here a while once we dock. I'm gonna go do some sight seeing!


March 11th, 2024. 

Gotta love 48 hours stuck in port. 

At least James let us off to go around the town, he even gave us a curfew of 1 AM. Maybe he’s not so bad after all. 

He even came out with us to the bar last night. Sam even came out, which is like spotting a unicorn in the wild. As per usual he kept to himself and barely said a word, I think he’s getting the can as soon as we get back to NYC. 

As soon as James saw him come out of his uber in front of the bar it looked like he just saw someone get shot, there was an awkward tension between them all night. 

After about an hour of chatting shit and drinking far too much Guiness I noticed both Sam and James were no longer sitting at the long table with the other crewmen. 

I went out for a cigarette shortly after and when I walked out the side of the bar I heard a heated conversation, not quite yelling but clearly a topic of passion. 

Trying not to look nosey I slowly walked my way toward the source of the sound in the alley. When I reached the corner I saw Sam and James in a heated argument. 

I couldn’t make out exactly what they were saying but I think I heard James say; 

“How can you expect me to rationalize it?” 

They noticed me staring and quickly stopped talking and walked towards me. Sam went directly back inside but James came over to me with his shit eating grin. 

“Gotta spare buddy?” He said pointing at my half ashed cigarette. 

When I tried to ask what they were talking about James just kept saying, “Sam just has some ideas he hasn't quite thought through.” 

I tried to press further on what those ideas were exactly but he just kept saying it’s gonna be fine and not to worry about it.

Eventually I just gave up and we finished my butt and went back inside.


March 12th, 2024 

Finally made it back to sea. Don’t get me wrong Dublin was amazing but with the tension between Sam and James I’m ready to get this voyage over with.

I will say Ireland couldn’t say a more beautiful goodbye during our departure. The setting sun paints the sky a gorgeous shade of red, giving our tired eyes a glimpse of Mother Nature's infinite beauty before being plunged into the black void of the ocean at night. 

Setting course for Jacksonville, then back to NYC for the end of my month at sea. 

It’s currently 2 AM and I’m sitting here with Ben completely dead asleep at his post even though I can hear the Dead Kennedys album blasting in his headphones from here. 

If James walks in we’d both be in shit. I should probably wake him up. He’s taught me how to watch the radars and steer clear of any oncoming ships so I think he’s comfortable enough to leave me to keep watch of the bridge for his beauty sleep. 

There’s something about the sea, especially the sea at night. You are in an environment that you — by any measure of human comprehension — are not welcome in. 

Right now I could take a step over a railing the height of my nipples and there would never be a trace of my physical body again. No matter how strong you are or how well you can swim, the endless waves just a few feet away have infinite energy and infinite time. 

I hate the way my mind wanders during these night shifts. I’m gonna wake Ben up. 


March 14th, 2024.

I’m done with Sam’s shit. If he’s having some mental breakdown he needs to just get off in Jacksonville and get help. 

His notes still suck, he refuses to take any accountability or even listen to me when I try to show him what he’s missing. I even offered to join him on watch and show him how to communicate what you do in the notes. The fucker just looked at me with a threatening silence that made the ice cold ocean seem welcoming. 

He also started doing this thing, I don’t know how to explain it without just showing you the notes. Ever since we left Dublin he has added seemingly random words to the end of each of his notes. 

I’ll write down an example here if that helps.

“Lights and Gainway tended, Cargo inventory complete, security LVL 1 is maintained. SOON”

The last word in that makes no sense. “SOON”. 

That was the first one that happened yesterday. Today he left the word “BACK”. 

I don’t even know what to make of it or if I should care at all. I’m gonna talk to James about sending him home once we reach Jacksonville, some people just aren’t built for the isolation of the ocean. 


March 17th, 2024 

I think the tension on the ship is reaching a boiling point. Carlos and I seem to be the only ones getting along. Ben still hates James, James hasn’t left the bridge in almost 24 hours. 

Sam is still being weird, still doing the weird random words thing. The last few have been; “STILL, FINGERS, STOPPED, WARMER.” in that order. 

I’m getting so sick of these guys man, most of my time not on shift I just hide in my room or exchanging rants with Carlos in the mess hall. 

I just have this feeling I can’t get over that something is coming, the nights are long. I have been losing more and more sleep every night since we left Dublin. Last night I had an awful panic attack as soon as I set foot on the bridge. 

My heart was pounding in my chest, I felt freezing but began to sweat like a pig. Carlos saw me standing in the doorway of the bridge and just before my knees buckled he grabbed me a desk chair and practically forced me to sit down and grabbed me a water. 

“Don’t worry about it man, everyone gets a bit jittery in the open ocean from time to time.” He said, patting me on the back before returning to finish his notes. 

I really like Carlos, with everything that's been going on I feel like he's the only normal person on this ship. In the few hours of sleep I have been getting I have been having recurring nightmares that the men on this ship are the last people on earth. 

We keep sailing forward for weeks and weeks never reaching land. Like we are sailing on another planet that has nothing but ocean that goes on forever. 

Jacksonville can’t come fast enough. 


The next couple pages are dated but there is no actual text. The dates start from March 18th to March 20th. It seems he went to write something but just couldn’t for an unknown reason.

His given name was Superman. We’ve since been calling him “Shy Guy” due to his behavior. He turns 5 in February. He has yet to be neutered. We have a long wait at our vet. We’ve had him now for 4 weeks and he will not come out from underneath the coffee table we have in the corner of the living room. We take him out on a leash to go to the bathroom and he does okay. We have another dog Redneck that’s a border collie lab mix that doesn’t bother him at all. I know he’s not scared of him because we take them out together and they walk side by side touching. 

I’m wondering what we can do? He will occasionally take a treat from our hand but doesn’t like to be pet. Under no circumstances will he come out from under the table unless we put the leash on him to go out. We took him to my mom’s house one day to let the dogs run together in the yard and after a few sniffs and a pee he ran and found the farthest corner sit and hide. He stayed in the same spot four 4 hours until we put the leash on him and left.  

Today we got him a bed to put under the table for him to make it a little more comfortable and he ran under the kitchen bar chair and hasn’t moved. 

What should we do? I thought we were doing the right thing giving him his space and allowing him to slowly start to trust us but he hasn’t showed any interest in us at all. ",1,1738295381.0,sheltie,0,1.0,False

March 17th, 2024 

I think the tension on the ship is reaching a boiling point. Carlos and I seem to be the only ones getting along. Ben still hates James, James hasn’t left the bridge in almost 24 hours. 

Sam is still being weird, still doing the weird random words thing. The last few have been; “STILL, FINGERS, STOPPED, WARMER.” in that order. 

I’m getting so sick of these guys man, most of my time not on shift I just hide in my room or exchanging rants with Carlos in the mess hall. 

I just have this feeling I can’t get over that something is coming, the nights are long. I have been losing more and more sleep every night since we left Dublin. Last night I had an awful panic attack as soon as I set foot on the bridge. 

My heart was pounding in my chest, I felt freezing but began to sweat like a pig. Carlos saw me standing in the doorway of the bridge and just before my knees buckled he grabbed me a desk chair and practically forced me to sit down and grabbed me a water. 

“Don’t worry about it man, everyone gets a bit jittery in the open ocean from time to time.” He said, patting me on the back before returning to finish his notes. 

I really like Carlos, with everything that's been going on I feel like he's the only normal person on this ship. In the few hours of sleep I have been getting I have been having recurring nightmares that the men on this ship are the last people on earth. 

We keep sailing forward for weeks and weeks never reaching land. Like we are sailing on another planet that has nothing but ocean that goes on forever. 

Jacksonville can’t come fast enough.

At my new org, I feel like there's... tail chasing, to say the least. bunch of jargon word salads and doing things because ""its what the successful orgs do"". for example...

  
As a small startup, we recently had a small release that did a UX update to an internal tool. We identified a problem from our internal users, brainstormed a solution, then put it into development. Got approvals from the stakeholders of the internal tool that it would be a well liked change by the core user base.

  
so it was built. then released. the \~40 users then adopted using the new ux and liked it. awesome. 

  
then came a big  thread discussing the analytics of how before the UX change, it took users \~7.2 seconds on average to complete the action, but now its 8.3seconds. and then product/eng back and forth discussing why this would be and if its good or bad. then higher ups asking ""why is it now longer?!?!""

  
after a bunch of jargon. the resolution was that ""its okay for now, and we will check back in next month to see if the numbers improve""

  
I personally, want to scream.

we have 40 f$\*#%ing internal users. why are investing so much time in analyzing the analytics of our internal users on a change that they verbally said they liked and said improved their workflows???

  
with 40 users, if Kevin decides to warm up from his coffee while he's doing that workflow, then he will increase the average time to complete the action by 3 damn seconds. what are we doing.

  
do we just want to sit in a room and sound smart? move tf on to something important before we go under in this economy.

  
yes google will analyze their analytics. its because they have millions of customers, so its much better data. but even then its hard. we are a startup with limited cash. I dont care how many seconds it took Kevin to do that workflow.

maybe someone can ease my mind. Because after coming from a straight forward Product mindset of ""the ship is sinking because we are a startup, we need to focus on the most important things"", the above drives me crazy.

1ie5z3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1ie5z3u/my_friend_went_missing_at_sea_i_found_his_journal/,My friend went missing at sea… I found his journal (Part 1),"
When I first started doing freelance journalism Terry and I agreed that if anything interesting ever happened to him I got to report it first. 

“Eric, if I kick the can in a fantastic way, I’ll put it in my will that if anyone reports on it before you that my family will sue their ass. ” I remember him saying. (I doubt that’ll hold up in court though, but it's the thought that counts.) 

So when the Cargo ship he worked on was discovered deserted I knew it was time to take him up on his promise.

When the rescue team let it slip that they discovered a detailed journal in his bunk I did what any self respecting journalist would do and harassed them and the coast guard for several months until I finally got my hands on a copy. 

Terry was a great friend, even though after college we drifted apart I will always love him and cherish our time together. When I heard he’d started going to school to become a cargo ship deck officer I wasn’t overly surprised, he was always the kid in class coming in every month with a different broken bone and a hell of a story. 

He had talked about his love for travel and adventure so much it only seemed like the perfect fit for him. I remember him telling me that all he wants in life is to be remembered, moralized in some way even if it is just in the memory of his loved ones. 

In the spirit of him being remembered I have transcribed the entirety of his journal below. I not only do this to honor my friend, but because if what he describes in this journal is true? the world needs to know. 


Feb 22nd, 2024.
 
    They stuck the newbie with the early morning and midnight rotation. I can’t say they didn’t warn me when I was doing my practicum with APM. 

“I’m not doing that shit, get the rookie to do it” Carlos told the pilot Benjamin.

What Carlos lacks in subtlety he makes up for in knowledge and work ethic. He had been used to AB life for 2 decades. No one knows his age, I guessed mid 50s but everytime someone asks he gives a different answer, when I asked he told me he was 15.

“Not my problem, talk to the new Master, I’m sure hearing your bitching is the first impression he needs.” Benjamin responded.

Ben was a lanky white dude that wouldn’t look out of place drinking gluten free beer at an indie rock concert. He’s the closest to me in age, only being 2 years older than me, and honestly even though he looks kinda like a douche I he’s one of the better guys to talk to.

“Have any of you guys met the new master yet?” I asked.

“Nope.” Carlos responded, pouring his second coffee of the day. 

“Don’t even know his name, they don’t tell us shit.” Ben added clicking the mouse on the control panel. 

There’s about 20 guys on staff on the ship, most of them old timers like Carlos, only one rookie besides me. Sam, he graduated the same year I did and from all I could gather in the 30 second conversation we had in line at the mess hall isn’t much for talking. 

Not rude by any means, just keeps to himself. I think he chose this job to get away from people, can’t blame him. I guess we all have our specific reasons for being here. 

After a while more of chatting shit and dodging Carlos’s putrid smelling hug of gratitude after I agreed to switch to the night watch for him. The new master walked in. Of course everyone is new to me but when he walked in I felt oddly better, like I wasn’t the odd man out anymore and that the old timers and I had something we could both agree on. That being the new master looked like a complete ass. 

He was a tall skinny guy with oddly broad shoulders, his buzz cut seemingly keeping his head from exploding from its own inflated sense of self. 

He wore a spotless white pilots jacket with long black trousers and carried his pilot's hat in his hand. 

Ben and Carlos immediately shot each other looks, waiting for the other person to break out into laughter. The master was dressed like he had just come from a stock photo shoot and had never even seen a cargo ship before. 

“Gentleman, my name is Captain James Pettersson. It’s an honor to pilot this fine vessel.” He said with his perfect posture revealing his previous military experience.

“That’s actually my job.” Ben said, easing his hand awkwardly. 

“Well of course!” Captain James— no that’s too weird I’m just gonna call him James— said making his way over to the front of the bridge. 

Feeling the awkward silence grew heavier than the ship I decided I needed to leave. 

“Well I better go do my rounds.” I said to no one’s reaction, Carlos was still holding back laughter as he finished up his watch log notes. 

Opening the metal sliding door on the starboard side of the bridge I immediately realized we may be in port for quite some time. A thick fog had descended on the entire port, I couldn’t even see the 40 foot containers in the shipping yard just over the railing. 

The air was crisp and chilly with the never ending sounds of New York posing as an infinite soundtrack to our work. 

Walking from line to line checking the auto-tension is still working properly (it almost always is) I got an odd feeling of dread. 

It was probably just new job anxieties not helped with the ere setting surrounding me. Walking through the deck I realized just how thick the fog actually was, the only visible objects in my line of sight were the railing around the bow of the ship leading to white fog so thick it looked more like a blank piece of paper than one of the busiest ports in the country. 

Finishing my round I reported to the bridge, Carlos was gone, Ben was still at his post drawing busy looking doodles on a piece of paper. James was standing straight with his hands clasped behind his back and staring out at the white cloud surrounding our ship.

“Hoping the fog clears sooner rather than later.” He said trying to cut through the silence that fell on the bridge since his arrival.

“A vessel like this yearns for the sea” James adds. 

Ben dropped his head in his hands in exhaustion. 


Feb 24th, 2024.

Holy shit was I right that we weren’t leaving port for a while, I just got off assisting with departure. 

James was on the verge of canceling the whole departure until the fog finally began to lift at around 1 pm today.

When I got there Carlos was ranting to Sam who had a look of either fear or annoyance in his eyes. I didn’t hear much of what he said but something about him was “a fine woman waiting for me in Manhattan.” And that he wanted the departure would just get cancelled already.

When I saw the fog lifted, it lifted just enough for the crane operators to actually see where they were loading the crates onto the cargo line, the fog was still present throughout departure. 

The white mist in the distance seemingly rendered the beautiful New York City skyline as we went for a visual treat for our tired eyes.

Now just the simple 15 day trek to Dublin!

Feb 27th, 2024.

Something is wrong with Sam. His watch notes are getting shorter and shorter. He has been missing random information in the last three entries. First he missed the hatch status, then he didn’t mention if there was any discharge in the VCP. 

Stuff that's easy to forget when we first start out, but when I tried to mention it to him in the mess hall today he just didn’t say anything, just sitting there staring at me with his blank expression. I’m not sure why but the look he gave me freaked me out. He just looked at me like I was speaking an alien language and like he was trying to kill me with his eyes. 

Safe to say, I’m staying the fuck away from that weirdo until he hit Ireland. 


March 9th, 2024. 

Sorry for the lack of entries, it’s hard thinking of interesting ways to write the same day over and over. 

Big development though… We hit Dublin! 

James is still the Hollywood trope equivalent of a ship captain. The other day I saw him leaning over the radar with his head in his hands in utter confusion. As soon as he noticed me there he sprang up like a soldier at attention. 

I never saw exactly what he was looking at but it clearly confused him. We were in the middle of the atlantic, the ocean can have odd effects on people, maybe he was just looking for a path between other ships. 

“Everything okay?” I asked

“Of course, She’s running like a dream!” he said with an air of delusional confidence. 

Good enough for me. Weirdo.

Oh also can’t forget Sam, his watch notes are still missing shit and honestly I’m too scared to call him on it, he definitely seems the type to “accidentally” push you overboard when you're going for a smoke. 

Anyway this port is pretty busy so we are probably gonna be here a while once we dock. I'm gonna go do some sight seeing!


March 11th, 2024. 

Gotta love 48 hours stuck in port. 

At least James let us off to go around the town, he even gave us a curfew of 1 AM. Maybe he’s not so bad after all. 

He even came out with us to the bar last night. Sam even came out, which is like spotting a unicorn in the wild. As per usual he kept to himself and barely said a word, I think he’s getting the can as soon as we get back to NYC. 

As soon as James saw him come out of his uber in front of the bar it looked like he just saw someone get shot, there was an awkward tension between them all night. 

After about an hour of chatting shit and drinking far too much Guiness I noticed both Sam and James were no longer sitting at the long table with the other crewmen. 

I went out for a cigarette shortly after and when I walked out the side of the bar I heard a heated conversation, not quite yelling but clearly a topic of passion. 

Trying not to look nosey I slowly walked my way toward the source of the sound in the alley. When I reached the corner I saw Sam and James in a heated argument. 

I couldn’t make out exactly what they were saying but I think I heard James say; 

“How can you expect me to rationalize it?” 

They noticed me staring and quickly stopped talking and walked towards me. Sam went directly back inside but James came over to me with his shit eating grin. 

“Gotta spare buddy?” He said pointing at my half ashed cigarette. 

When I tried to ask what they were talking about James just kept saying, “Sam just has some ideas he hasn't quite thought through.” 

I tried to press further on what those ideas were exactly but he just kept saying it’s gonna be fine and not to worry about it.

Eventually I just gave up and we finished my butt and went back inside.


March 12th, 2024 

Finally made it back to sea. Don’t get me wrong Dublin was amazing but with the tension between Sam and James I’m ready to get this voyage over with.

I will say Ireland couldn’t say a more beautiful goodbye during our departure. The setting sun paints the sky a gorgeous shade of red, giving our tired eyes a glimpse of Mother Nature's infinite beauty before being plunged into the black void of the ocean at night. 

Setting course for Jacksonville, then back to NYC for the end of my month at sea. 

It’s currently 2 AM and I’m sitting here with Ben completely dead asleep at his post even though I can hear the Dead Kennedys album blasting in his headphones from here. 

If James walks in we’d both be in shit. I should probably wake him up. He’s taught me how to watch the radars and steer clear of any oncoming ships so I think he’s comfortable enough to leave me to keep watch of the bridge for his beauty sleep. 

There’s something about the sea, especially the sea at night. You are in an environment that you — by any measure of human comprehension — are not welcome in. 

Right now I could take a step over a railing the height of my nipples and there would never be a trace of my physical body again. No matter how strong you are or how well you can swim, the endless waves just a few feet away have infinite energy and infinite time. 

I hate the way my mind wanders during these night shifts. I’m gonna wake Ben up. 


March 14th, 2024.

I’m done with Sam’s shit. If he’s having some mental breakdown he needs to just get off in Jacksonville and get help. 

His notes still suck, he refuses to take any accountability or even listen to me when I try to show him what he’s missing. I even offered to join him on watch and show him how to communicate what you do in the notes. The fucker just looked at me with a threatening silence that made the ice cold ocean seem welcoming. 

He also started doing this thing, I don’t know how to explain it without just showing you the notes. Ever since we left Dublin he has added seemingly random words to the end of each of his notes. 

I’ll write down an example here if that helps.

“Lights and Gainway tended, Cargo inventory complete, security LVL 1 is maintained. SOON”

The last word in that makes no sense. “SOON”. 

That was the first one that happened yesterday. Today he left the word “BACK”. 

I don’t even know what to make of it or if I should care at all. I’m gonna talk to James about sending him home once we reach Jacksonville, some people just aren’t built for the isolation of the ocean.

Last week she lost her best friend to lung cancer and today we found out my uncle is likely going to die very soon due to a brain bleed. 

Me an my mum used to be best friends, I can't put into words the lengths she would go to see her kids smile. Seeing her lose so much in such a short and the effect its had on her mental state, has been torture. She lashes out often over small things, she's developed a pretty heavy spending problem on apps on her phone. I don't blame her for these things, she's in so much pain mentally an physically she's doing anything for a distraction. I just help where I can. 

With all of this going on I've had no opportunity to properly grieve the things I've lost, what I used to have, who I used to be, my relationship, my brother, my mum, my friends, my job, my future. I lost it all.

""Don't worry about it, it's free. Thanks for coming in, I'm glad I got to see you"" 

I don't know this girl very much at all an I haven't had a kind gesture like that in a long time. But it was what she said that hit me so hard, I've not felt appreciated or seen in a such a long time it felt almost alien to me, I even questioned if there was some kind of supervisor watching her an she was just being nice.

1ie5qwk,https://www.reddit.com/r/digimarketeronline/comments/1ie5qwk/how_do_i_use_augmented_reality_ar_for_local/,How do I use augmented reality (AR) for local business marketing?,"Using **augmented reality (AR)** for local business marketing can be a powerful way to engage customers, create memorable experiences, and differentiate your business from competitors. AR technology allows businesses to overlay digital content onto the real world through smartphones, tablets, or AR glasses, creating an interactive and immersive experience. Here’s how you can leverage AR to boost your local business marketing:

# 1. AR-Enhanced Storefronts and Window Displays

* **Virtual Product Try-Ons**: For businesses like clothing stores, beauty shops, or eyewear retailers, AR can allow customers to virtually try on products before purchasing. By simply using their smartphone, customers can ""try on"" clothes, glasses, makeup, or other accessories, creating an engaging in-store or window shopping experience.
   * **Example**: A fashion store could allow customers to try on clothes virtually by scanning the store's window display with an AR app.
* **Interactive Window Displays**: Turn your physical storefront into an interactive experience by integrating AR technology into your window displays. When customers point their phone at the display, they could unlock discounts, product information, or even access a digital tour of your store.
   * **Example**: An AR-enabled window display could let passersby scan a QR code to unlock a virtual tour of your store’s product collection.

# 2. AR-Powered Loyalty Programs and Discounts

* **Gamify the Shopping Experience**: Use AR to create **interactive loyalty programs**. For example, customers could unlock rewards by scanning specific products or store displays using an AR app. The AR app could offer special discounts or reward points as customers explore different parts of your store or shop online.
   * **Example**: A coffee shop could offer a loyalty program where customers scan cups or posters in-store using an AR app to receive a stamp toward a free drink or a discount.
* **AR Coupons and Deals**: Create location-based AR promotions that can only be unlocked when customers are near your store. These can appear as digital coupons or special offers that are accessible only when customers engage with your AR experience.
   * **Example**: A customer walking by your store could use an AR app to see a special “50% off” coupon appear on their screen when they point their phone at your storefront.

# 3. Local Business Navigation with AR

* **AR Maps and Directions**: Local businesses can use AR to help customers navigate to their location or find specific areas inside their store. This can be especially useful for large shopping centers, malls, or complex retail environments. An AR app could provide turn-by-turn directions, directing customers to a store or specific section of your business.
   * **Example**: A mall could use AR to guide visitors to stores, offer indoor navigation, and highlight promotions along the way.

# 4. Virtual Tours and Experiences

* **Enhance In-Store Experience**: Offer customers a **virtual tour** of your store or service offerings through AR. For example, a real estate agent could offer virtual property tours, a restaurant could showcase a digital version of its menu, or a museum could provide AR-guided tours of exhibits.
   * **Example**: A furniture store could use AR to help customers visualize how furniture would look in their home by allowing them to use their phone’s camera to place virtual pieces of furniture in their living rooms.
* **Interactive Product Demos**: Use AR to provide virtual demonstrations of your products. For instance, if you're a fitness equipment store, AR can help potential customers see how to use the equipment correctly, or if you sell cosmetics, it can show how makeup products look on different skin tones.
   * **Example**: A paint store could allow customers to use AR to see how different paint colors would look in their home before purchasing.

# 5. AR for Local Event Promotions

* **AR Event Invitations and Flyers**: Use AR to make local event invitations more interactive. For example, AR-enabled flyers or posters can allow potential attendees to scan them and view interactive event details such as video previews, schedules, or directions.
   * **Example**: A local restaurant hosting a live music night could hand out flyers with AR codes that, when scanned, show a video of the upcoming performer or an exclusive coupon for the event.
* **Event Engagement**: At local events, you can use AR to engage attendees in fun ways. This could include interactive games, challenges, or scavenger hunts with virtual clues and rewards that encourage customers to visit your store or engage with your brand during the event.
   * **Example**: At a food festival, you could create an AR scavenger hunt where participants use their phones to find virtual food items or discounts hidden around the venue.

# 6. AR-Based Business Cards and Branding

* **Interactive Business Cards**: Use AR to make your business card stand out by embedding digital content that can be accessed when customers scan the card with an AR app. This could include your portfolio, a video introduction, or even a special offer to encourage them to visit your store.
   * **Example**: A local photographer might print business cards with AR codes that, when scanned, show a short video reel of their work.
* **Augmented Branding**: AR can be used to bring your business branding to life on various materials, such as posters, packaging, or advertisements. For example, scanning a brand’s logo on a product could unlock special digital content, adding an extra layer of engagement for customers.
   * **Example**: A coffee shop might use AR to animate their logo on cups, creating an interactive, visually appealing experience that brings more attention to the brand.

# 7. AR for Customer Reviews and Feedback

* **Virtual Reviews**: You can use AR to provide **customer reviews** or **product ratings** in real-time by allowing customers to scan products with their smartphones and view feedback and ratings from other customers through AR.
   * **Example**: A local bookstore could allow customers to scan books to immediately see reviews or see ratings from other readers before making a purchase.

# 8. Integration with Social Media

* **AR Filters for Social Sharing**: Many businesses use **custom AR filters** for platforms like Instagram and Snapchat to engage customers. You can create branded filters that customers can use and share on their social media profiles, increasing brand visibility and driving engagement.
   * **Example**: A local fitness center could create an AR filter with their logo and a motivational quote that users can share after completing a workout.

# 9. Analytics and Data Collection

* **Track Customer Behavior**: AR can provide valuable insights into how customers interact with your business in real-time. By analyzing how customers use AR features (e.g., which product try-ons or virtual tours are most popular), you can fine-tune your marketing strategy and improve customer experiences.
   * **Example**: A local clothing store could track which virtual try-ons were most commonly used to understand which products are most appealing to customers.

# Conclusion

Incorporating AR into your local business marketing strategy can **boost customer engagement**, create **memorable experiences**, and **differentiate your brand** from competitors. By offering innovative and interactive ways for customers to engage with your business—whether through virtual try-ons, in-store navigation, event promotions, or social media filters—you can drive more foot traffic, enhance loyalty, and increase sales.",1,1738294274.0,digimarketeronline,0,1.0,False

# **Part IV: The Brotherhood Never Dies**

Firefighters knew loss. It was an unspoken truth, buried under the jokes, the late-night coffee, and the smell of smoke that never truly washed off. Every man in the firehouse understood that one day, the alarm might sound, and someone wouldn’t come back.

This time, it was Mike ""Mickey"" O'Connor.

Patrick had known Mickey for over twenty years. They came up together—rookies straight out of the academy, breaking in their first helmets side by side. Mickey was the loudest guy in the room, always cracking jokes, always making the job a little lighter when the weight of it got too damn heavy. He was the kind of guy who showed up when your kid was born, when your old man died, and when you needed someone to help fix a leaky sink at two in the morning.

And now he was gone.

It happened on a warehouse fire—a bad one. A collapse. One second, Mickey was on the radio, barking orders. The next, silence. By the time they dug him out, it was too late.

The funeral was packed. Dress blues, white gloves, the wail of bagpipes cutting through the cold morning air. Patrick stood with the rest of the crew, watching as the flag was folded, listening as the bell rang out one final alarm for their fallen brother.

And then came the hardest part—the long walk to Mickey’s widow, Colleen, and his two sons. Patrick knelt down, looking into the eyes of a ten-year-old boy who would never see his father walk through the door again. He placed Mickey’s badge in the boy’s small hands, swallowing back the lump in his throat.

""Your dad was the best man I ever knew,"" he said, his voice steady despite the storm inside him. ""And we’re always gonna be here for you. Always.""

That night, Patrick sat alone in his backyard, a half-drunk beer in his hand, staring up at the stars. The firehouse would move on—it always did. New rookies would come, old ones would retire. But the empty chair at the kitchen table, the missing laugh in the locker room… those things never went away.

Still, he knew one thing for sure.

Mickey was still with them, in every fire they fought, in every life they saved. Because the brotherhood never died—it just kept burning, passed from one firefighter to the next, like a torch in the dark.",2,1738294058.0,RobloxAvatars,1,1.0,False

We met a few months ago and we hit it off really well. During August 2024, she was seeing this guy whom I have always had a bad feeling about and warned her several times about him. She did not listen. A few months pass and this boy cheats on her with several other women and mind you, he is 23 , way older than her. 
After a few more months, he decides to come back after seeing her at a coffee shop with someone else. I was there and I saw the way he looked at her and her new potential suitor. I felt disgusted. I told my best friend about me seeing him but she apparently did not see him so she tried to convince me that I was schizophrenic and need to get my eyes checked. 
After 5 minutes, she gets 3 phone calls from her ex and she runs out for “ air”.  I look out of the window and I see my best friend talking to her ex. I immediately run down and see what the whole commotion was about. He was drunk on his bike. I immediately knew what he was trying to do, and that was try to manipulate her into going back with him. I had a personal talk with him and he was so annoying and didn’t let me speak and so I told him that he’s so annoying. He told me to slap him, if I feel that way. I slapped him twice
I felt like the situation was really bad so I waited for my best friend to finish “her talk” with him. 
When it reached 3 hours, I told her it was time to go. 
She, with a little bit of nudging, decided to give in and go back home. 
The next day, she starts to act weird around me. My other friend told me that it was out of line for me to hit someone who is the brother of her friend. My best friend said that she didn’t like that I went out of my way to slap him and she wanted to have more time with him, possibly go back to his place.

The Office of Personnel Management issued a memo yesterday making it federal policy to [ban trans people from using the restroom on federal property](https://thehill.com/homenews/lgbtq/5117077-trump-transgender-bathroom-ban-opm-gender-ideology/) (like the building I work in). Meaning, if one of my colleagues chooses to report me for peeing while trans, I may end up fired, unless I allow them to debase me by forcing me into the men's room, but I promise you that will not happen. Alternatively, I can learn not to pee. I only live 10 min from work, so if I cut out coffee, I can swing home on my 30 min lunch for a quick pee, and there would be nothing to catch me on.

However, if I do somehow survive for an indefinite period without getting reported for having human bodily functions, I just need to worry about the suitability review that I go through in 2026. It’s a routine background check every 5 yrs or so to make sure you're suitable for your position, apparently. If I had to guess, I'm thinking existing as a trans person will be enough to lose suitability. 

After all, the [Fork in the Road email](https://www.opm.gov/fork) said ""The federal workforce should be comprised of employees who are reliable, loyal, trustworthy, and who strive for excellence in their daily work."" I don't like the outlook when you compare that with the [executive order banning trans people from military service](https://www.them.us/story/trump-hegseth-executive-order-paveing-way-trans-military-ban-dei) (""adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual’s sex conflicts with a soldier’s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one’s personal life.  A man’s assertion that he is a woman, and his requirement that others honor this falsehood, is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member."")

So my options are (1) put in my 2 weeks' notice and get away from that Gestapo bullshit, (2) take the deferred resignation and hope I don't get ripped off or fired before I get there, (3) get fired for peeing, or (4) hold out until I fail my suitability background check next year. I have some pipe dream that if I choose option 3, I might get reinstated with back-pay by some sympathetic judge or future administration. What do you think?

You know, the phrase “Beauty is in the eye of the beholder” might sound cliché, but it’s one of those sayings that gets richer the more you think about it. It’s almost like peeling an onion—layer by layer, you uncover deeper truths about the world, about others, and about yourself. At its heart, this phrase captures something profoundly human: the way we perceive beauty is deeply personal, influenced by our experiences, values, and even our culture. But let’s unpack this together—let’s dig into why this idea matters and how it shapes our interactions with the world.

### Beauty as a Personal Experience

Have you ever had one of those moments when something strikes you as breathtakingly beautiful, only for someone else to shrug and go, “Meh”? It’s fascinating how subjective beauty can be. For example, I once went hiking in the mountains, and as I reached the summit, the view took my breath away. Rolling hills stretched endlessly into the horizon, bathed in golden sunlight. To me, it was perfection. Yet, a friend I was with—someone who prefers cities to nature—barely looked up from their phone. That moment was a lightbulb for me: what I see as beautiful isn’t universal. It’s shaped by what I value and what moves me.

This subjectivity doesn’t just apply to landscapes. Think about art. Some people find abstract paintings mesmerizing, full of emotion and depth, while others see random splashes of paint. The beauty of a piece lies not in the canvas but in the person looking at it. What memories or feelings does it stir in them? What story do they see in the colors or shapes? The art itself doesn’t change; the viewer’s perspective does.

### The Role of Culture and Upbringing

Our ideas of beauty aren’t formed in a vacuum. They’re influenced by where we come from, what we’ve been taught, and the standards society sets. Take fashion, for instance. What’s considered stylish in one era or culture might be completely out of place in another. Remember when bell-bottom jeans were all the rage? Or how certain cultures prize intricate, colorful patterns while others lean towards minimalism? These trends and preferences reflect the environment we’ve grown up in.

Even more poignant is the way beauty standards affect people. In some parts of the world, lighter skin is idealized; in others, darker skin is celebrated. These preferences are often rooted in history and societal dynamics, and they shape how people see themselves and others. It’s a reminder that what we find beautiful is often a reflection of the stories and values we’ve inherited.

### Emotional Connections and Beauty

Sometimes, what makes something beautiful isn’t its appearance but the emotions it evokes. I remember visiting my grandmother’s house as a child. Her garden wasn’t the kind you’d see in glossy magazines—no perfectly trimmed hedges or exotic flowers. But to me, it was magical. Each plant held a memory: the rose bush she planted when I was born, the herbs she used in her cooking. The beauty of that garden wasn’t just in how it looked but in what it represented—love, history, and home.

This emotional connection extends to people, too. Have you ever noticed how someone becomes more beautiful to you the more you get to know them? Their laugh, the way they light up when talking about their passions, or the kindness in their eyes—all these qualities can outshine conventional good looks. It’s proof that beauty isn’t just skin-deep; it’s layered, complex, and deeply tied to how someone makes us feel.

### Beauty and the Power of Perspective

One of the most liberating things about “Beauty is in the eye of the beholder” is that it encourages us to broaden our perspectives. It’s an invitation to look for beauty in unexpected places and people. When we understand that beauty isn’t a fixed standard but a fluid, personal experience, we open ourselves up to appreciating the world in richer, more meaningful ways.

I once took a photography class where the instructor challenged us to find beauty in the mundane. We were given the task of photographing everyday objects—a rusty fence, a puddle, an old shoe. At first, it felt like a chore. But as I experimented with angles and lighting, I began to see things differently. The rust on the fence had intricate patterns, the puddle reflected the sky like a mirror, and the old shoe told a story of journeys taken. That exercise taught me that beauty isn’t about perfection; it’s about perspective.

### The Flip Side: When Beauty Becomes a Source of Judgment

While the subjectivity of beauty is freeing, it can also lead to misunderstandings and judgments. If we’re not careful, we might dismiss something—or someone—because they don’t align with our idea of what’s beautiful. This narrow-mindedness can rob us of opportunities to connect and grow.

For instance, think about how society often judges people based on appearances. Someone might be overlooked for a job, a friendship, or even a romantic relationship because they don’t fit conventional beauty standards. But if we take the time to look beyond the surface, we might discover qualities that are far more compelling—intelligence, humor, resilience. Recognizing that beauty is subjective helps us move past these superficial judgments.

### Finding Beauty in the Everyday

One of the greatest gifts of embracing this philosophy is that it makes life richer. When you realize that beauty is everywhere, you start to notice it more—like how the morning sunlight filters through your curtains, the sound of rain on the roof, or the way strangers smile at each other on the street. These small moments might seem ordinary, but they’re bursting with beauty if we’re willing to see it.

I’ve started keeping a journal of “beautiful moments.” It’s not about big, dramatic events but the little things that make me pause and smile. Like the time I saw an older couple holding hands in the park or the way my coffee smelled on a cold morning. These entries remind me that beauty isn’t rare—it’s all around us, waiting to be noticed.

### A Closing Thought: Beauty as a Reflection of Ourselves

In the end, what we find beautiful says as much about us as it does about the thing we’re looking at. It reveals our values, our memories, and our way of seeing the world. And that’s what makes beauty so fascinating—it’s not just about what’s out there; it’s about what’s within us. So, the next time something catches your eye, take a moment to reflect on why it moves you. In doing so, you’ll not only appreciate its beauty but also gain a deeper understanding of yourself.

We were instantly attracted to each other, but he was in a new relationship. We would see each other occasionally, mostly for coffee or lunch. We were definitely building a strong emotional attraction, some might consider it an emotional affair. And we eventually kissed.

We both felt guilty after, but it didn’t stop us from seeing each other. Long story short, he recently told me he and his partner broke up (ironically, found out they were cheating as well). He has been withdrawn, but still texts, still agrees to meet for coffee, etc. He’s transparent about needing to figure things out; about liking me / being with me; that he doesn’t know about dating (in general) right now. He also still sees his ex “occasionally” he says, due to overlap of friends and a history. 

I understand I’m not innocent in this. I fell hard for someone who was in a relationship.

I can’t tell if he’s trying to distance himself from me or if he’s really just being pragmatic (like an Aquarius). The texting has significantly decreased, tho he’s quick to assure me it’s just him figuring things out (his ex, possible work relocation, etc.).

1ie5cda,https://www.reddit.com/r/PulmonaryEmbolism/comments/1ie5cda/probable_pulmonary_endarterectomy/,Probable Pulmonary Endarterectomy,"My sitch: about a year ago was having breathing difficulties and began seeking medical advice. Misdiagnosed for a few months with bronchial asthema. Got really really sick. Ended up with my whole system compromised and got facial shingles and Type A influenza in rapid succession. Awful time. Got proper meds for those and came though them. Persistent racking cough. 

Then one morning I woke up coughing and staggered into the living room only to pass out. I woke up flat on floor and banged up from cracking a rib on the coffee table. Quickly arranged a hospital appointment and made my way there the next morning. 

After much testing, my great pulmonary cardiologist there told me that yes I had a pulmonary embolism (acute PTE) in the right side of my artery from lung to my heart. Put in hospital for a week, where I was drenched in IV blood thinner (Heparin). Then put on Rivaroxaban (Xarelto) and also a vascodilator for months. Have improved but still somewhat breathless with increased activity and constant choky cough. 

My doctor told me he thinks I have CTEPH (chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension). The best treatment option is a PEA (pulmonary endarterectomy), surgery involving open chest and manually remove large hardened clot from pulmonary artery. 

This is a serious operation so they have three tests to confirm if this CTEPH is truly the case or not: CT scan, scintigraphy radioisotope lung scanning, and right heart catheterization. I have already done the first two, and will go in on Monday morning to have the catheterization test. (not looking forward to that😖). 

Anyway, I think (and my doctor thinks) that CTEPH will be confirmed and then two days later we will meet with a specialist pulmonary heart surgeon to have the endarterectomy done in a few weeks. 

Has anyone had this open chest surgery done? I like and trust my doctors and the excellent hospital but would like to hear others’ experiences who have had this procedure done. Scary? Painful afterwards? Recovery time? Prognosis for normal lung capacity? Looking for practical info. Thanks. ",1,1738292993.0,PulmonaryEmbolism,0,1.0,False

(31F),"11 months ago I left my partner 39M of 3 years after I found out he was cheating on me and lying about it for the entire relationship. In the last year of the relationship it was horrific, he was violent, verbally abusive, distant and incredibly secretive. For that whole year I found myself slowly losing my love for him the more and more he called me ""stupid"" choked me, kicked me out, for questioning his shady behaviour. Turns out I was right all along when a mysterious woman messaged me one day and told me he was talking to women online and organizing meet ups (especially when I was caring for my mother who had cancer) I finally had the solid proof and left. I did not feel sadness, I felt relief. I no longer felt like I was crazy, I was right all along and I knew I didn't deserve any of it. 


I got a job traveling around the country and concentrated on myself for the past 11 months. My mother passed away, but I reconnected with my sister. My friend groups have never been stronger. And I now focus on health and personal growth. Suddenly I started to notice people's flaws more, things I would have overlooked, like what I did with my ex. I'm more careful with who I let in.


Well about a month ago, I messaged a friend of mine 30M, who I've known for 7 years. We had a great conversation about the past, our futures, the conversation lasted 5 days. He posted a picture online and I thought he looked really cute. So I asked him on a date. I wasn't looking for anything serious but I thought it would be cute, he knew this and agreed. 


Well turns out, it was a fantastic date! We found ourselves talking in the restaurant for 4 hours, then talked some more later on for 4 more hours! He was kind, respectful, and we were bouncing off each other with ease. I felt like my old self again. 


We see each other once a week now, we're about to go on our 5th date, and I'm meeting him today for coffee. We're both excited to see each other and we're giddy like school kids. I've always thought he was wonderful, hence why we've been friends for 7 years. But now I see him as remarkable. The most respectful, level headed, gentle and loving person I've ever had the pleasure of knowing.


So my question is this, am I in the wrong for having feelings for someone 11 months after the end of a 3 year relationship? I mean, I don't think I am. Seeing as I feel like I've been single for 2 years. That last year of my relationship was pure hell, I had no love left. I feel ready to find someone who won't hurt me, won't waste my time. I have so much love to give and want to support someone who deserves the very best in this world, like my friend. We're nothing too serious at the moment but I can definitely see a future in him, and he agrees. But I cannot shake this guilt that it may look like I'm man-hopping.",5,1738292772.0,AITAH,16,1.0,False

**The Pregnant PUMA**

  
Major Klaus Krieger prided himself on being a soldier first and everything else second. He wasn’t one for politics or paperwork, but as the head of the PUMA Infantry Fighting Vehicle project, he had been dragged into more meetings than battles in recent years. And this morning's briefing? It was shaping up to be the worst yet.

The conference room smelled faintly of burnt coffee and stale ambition. Across the table sat Colonel Dieter Schmitt, a bureaucrat so uptight his uniform creased itself out of sheer fear of displeasing him. Next to him, Dr. Anna Wunderlich, the Ministry of Defense's newly appointed diversity officer, adjusted her glasses with enthusiasm that seemed entirely out of place for a defense contractor meeting.

Klaus leaned back in his chair, arms crossed, as Colonel Schmitt cleared his throat. ""Major Krieger,"" Schmitt began, his voice as dry as the Bundeswehr’s coffee. ""We have a new operational mandate for the PUMA. It must… accommodate all potential combatants. Everyone.""

Klaus raised an eyebrow. ""Everyone? It’s a tank, not a taxi.""

Dr. Wunderlich leaned forward, her eyes gleaming like a kindergarten teacher explaining finger painting to skeptical parents. ""Major, inclusivity is the cornerstone of our modern army. That means the PUMA must be able to safely transport highly pregnant women into combat zones.""

Klaus blinked. Then he blinked again. Surely, he’d misheard. ""Pregnant women? In a tank? While under fire?""

""Exactly!"" Wunderlich beamed as though Klaus had just solved an equation. ""We’re setting a new global standard for inclusivity in military operations.""

Klaus rubbed his temples. ""Ma’am, with all due respect, pregnant women shouldn’t be anywhere near a combat zone, let alone inside an IFV.""

Wunderlich’s smile didn’t waver. ""That’s why the PUMA needs to be safe, Major. To ensure their well-being in even the harshest conditions.""

Over the next ten years, the PUMA project devolved into a bureaucratic circus. Every practical design element was scrutinized, debated, and either vetoed or painstakingly modified to fit the new ""inclusive"" standards. The engineers were forced to make the crew compartment larger, ""for leg space,"" and add a state-of-the-art air conditioning system, ""to prevent overheating."" The turret was redesigned to ensure it wouldn’t jostle an imaginary pregnant passenger. And, of course, a bottle warmer was installed in the crew compartment, because—why not?

By the time the PUMA rolled off the assembly line, it was a masterpiece of compromise. Twice as expensive as the original budget, it was equipped with some of the most advanced features ever seen in an IFV. Unfortunately, few of them involved combat. The PUMA was now the most baby-friendly tank in the world, complete with reclining seats and a suspension system so smooth it could have been a luxury car.

And then came the kicker.

Shortly after the PUMA was declared combat-ready, the military issued a policy forbidding the transportation of pregnant personnel in combat zones. The entire point of the redesign—every bottle warmer, every ergonomic seat, every centimeter of extra legroom—was rendered moot with a single memo.

""It’s for their safety,"" Colonel Schmitt explained during the final review meeting, looking remarkably unbothered by the irony. ""Pregnant soldiers shouldn’t be in combat zones. But the PUMA is still a triumph of engineering!""

Klaus was tempted to throw his coffee mug at Schmitt but settled for glaring at the man instead. ""So we’ve spent a decade and billions of euros to build a tank that can babysit no one?""

Schmitt shrugged. ""Well, the air conditioning is top-notch.""

The PUMA was finally adopted by the Bundeswehr, albeit ten years behind schedule. On paper, it was a capable infantry fighting vehicle. In practice, it was a very expensive, very comfortable box on tracks. Soldiers quickly discovered that the extra space and air conditioning in the crew compartment wasn’t terribly useful for combat operations, but it was perfect for poker games during downtime.

""Deal me in,"" Private Uwe Hofmann said, squeezing into the circle. The crew had folded down the bottle warmer to use it as a makeshift card table. The hum of the air conditioning provided a pleasant backdrop to the clink of poker chips and the occasional muttered curse.

""You know,"" Hofmann mused as he shuffled the cards, ""this thing’s not half bad. Plenty of legroom, great AC, and it doesn’t shake you to death like the old Marder.""

""Yeah,"" another soldier chimed in, ""we might not win wars, but at least we’ll be well-rested.""

The crew laughed, though Klaus—now promoted to General—did not join in. He stood at the back of the compartment, arms crossed, watching his soldiers play cards in the vehicle he’d spent a decade fighting to build. He had to admit, the PUMA wasn’t a total disaster. It was functional, reliable, and, yes, surprisingly comfortable. But every time he saw that damn bottle warmer, he felt a pang of frustration at how the project had turned into a monument to bureaucratic absurdity.

Dr. Wunderlich, of course, declared the PUMA a ""resounding success."" She retired shortly after the vehicle’s adoption to write a memoir about her time in government, titled *Tanks for Everyone: How Inclusivity Won the Day*. Klaus never read it.

The PUMA became a fixture of the Bundeswehr, its quirks gradually accepted as part of military life. It was a decent IFV, though it was hard to shake the lingering sense of what could have been. Klaus often wondered how history would remember the PUMA. As a triumph of engineering? A cautionary tale about military procurement? Or simply a really expensive poker lounge with tracks?

They occasionally meet for walks or coffee, and I’ve expressed that I’m not comfortable with certain settings, like intimate dinners or them being alone at her home.

She’s expressed frustration with these boundaries, saying trust should exist regardless of the setting. I’ve been in therapy for the past five months, actively working on my trust issues, and I’ve communicated that this situation is difficult for me.

Today, she brought it up again, saying she doesn’t like letting friendships fade and hopes we can move past it. I’m trying to find a balance between respecting my own boundaries and being open to her perspective.

I’d love to hear from others—how have you navigated situations like this in your own relationships?",0,1738292404.0,relationship_advice,8,0.5,False

1ie51kq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1ie51kq/im_kinda_lost/,I'm kinda lost,"Okay, for just a moment, I'd like to let out some things that are eating me inside.

In a couple of months, I will be thirty.

And I'm broke, have nothing to my name, and almost all the time, it feels like I can't actually trust anyone or truly open up with others without some stares.

My girlfriend of almost three years and I have been living together for almost a month, but she's made some arguments about how we should live together. She didn't even let me put my things on her bookshelves or in her closet. Okay, I don't have many things, but really? Can't you give me at least a full shelf and a drawer? Right now, I have some boxes with my stuff and half a shelf, while she uses two closets. She doesn't really like any food I make, but we agreed to try eating healthier and at least better, not just ordering in. I'm making something different every day because she doesn't like to repeat the same lunch twice in the same week. And since I really like to live in a clean place, I'm always cleaning, organizing, doing laundry, and maintaining OUR apartment. But I'm really tired. I have a full-time job, and every day I walk to the bus, work all day, and then take the bus back.

But there are two things that are really bothering me: she's not really a dog person and has two cats that she adopted after we started our relationship, knowing I'm not really a cat guy. But my dogs, that she already knew me with, I somehow convinced myself to leave with my mother (which is another black hole of situations). And nothing against her cats, but I'm cleaning, feeding, and treating them even better than she ever cared for my dogs. And we've come to this cycle of asking for more and more things that ""I could do to help her week be easier."" Then, one of my dogs died this weekend, and she didn't even let me touch on the subject. She just ignored it.
Then, my mom, who just sold her apartment and is burning through this cash (even the part she promised me when I paid for all the renovations and other things she was doing for all of 2024), left my own house to her, moved here to live with my girlfriend, bought everything new, took almost all my furniture and is giving it away to any of her ""friends,"" and is trying to make me pay for the rent of both of her houses while I'm paying my rent here.

On top of all that, my grandmother, my mom's side, who basically raised me, had a stroke, and everyone in this family is acting like nothing's changed.

And I just started a new job that's finally making me some nice money, and everyone in my family and my girlfriend's family is asking for something, like I owed them something, but no one showed up to even help me move here.
So, today, after all this, for a brief moment while walking home, I smoked a cigarette, listened to some blues, and ignored everyone. For those fifteen minutes, nothing bothered me. And now, I'm really asking myself, ""What the hell am I doing with my life?""

P.S.: I don't smoke regularly. Sometimes when I'm really losing it, like today. My last one was six months ago. And that's a whole other chapter of my life. My father left, and the smell of coffee and Marlboros in my other grandmother's house was the closest I ever was to the guy. No, he wasn't there ever, but for some compensation, my mom sent me there to be with my father's family, with all the hope for a guy who never shows up.

So this was bigger than I expected. Thanks for being here with me, even if it is just for a moment.

Okay, now it's time for some sleep. Tomorrow I should probably start looking for a new place.",1,1738292036.0,Vent,3,1.0,False

Hey everyone, I know this is for product photography and not exactly for prop/set styling but this was the only relevant subreddit I could find. Product/commercial photographers seem to work with prop stylists all the time.

I moved to a new city last year and was trying to break into the prop/set styling world here. Before moving, I worked in interior styling, but I’ve had a really hard time finding similar work.

I ended up taking a corporate job to pay the bills, but I’ve been assisting on styling jobs whenever I can to break in. The problem? It feels impossible to actually get anywhere.

What I’ve Been Doing:


	•Reaching out to people I’ve assisted before → no response

	•I made sure I left on good terms, so I’ve even just asked for a coffee meetup → no response

	•Networking on set, exchanging IGs with photographers, etc. → no response

	•Worked for free for photographers in exchange for photos → they never send me anything


Is it normal for people in this industry to be this unresponsive? I get that everyone is busy, but it’s getting discouraging when I’m doing everything I can and still hitting a wall.

Any advice on better ways to network or actually get gigs? Also, if you’ve broken in, how long did it take you?

Still with some pretty bad body aches. Took the last two Tylenol I had, and promptly fell back asleep. Woke up about an hour later. 'It's the one day the church here feeds. And they have a shower truck. I need a shower in the worst way. That would be awesome!' Take a look out the companionway door over to my friend's boat.

There's a sport fishing boat pulled up really close to his. I see him on deck, something getting passed to him. 'Well, it doesn't look like he made it to the trial again.' Shoot him a text, ""Hey."" I know he'll get back to me when he's got a minute. One thing about living on a boat... Sometimes we're busy dealing with boat stuff. I'm not stopping in the middle of something like say water pouring in for some unknown reason, to answer a text or a phone call. Boat first. Outside people when I have the boat secured, coffee made, whatever I'm currently doing. We both know this. It ain't a thing. When you're on boat time nothing happens fast.

I haven't had the energy to do anything but not die. I need to get these dishes done. They're pretty gross. I string my pot and pan up and toss them over the side. Tie them to a cleat. Better to let nature deal with that first. 

I left the boat in what was pretty much an emergency. No food. No water. For two days. No working dinghy. Too far to swim. My friend's dinghy out of commission. I called the sheriff, FWC, and Coast Guard for a rescue. Explained my situation They all told me to go fuck myself. Fuck those assholes. No love from me.

Rant over.

""Yo. VHF"" Since this phone has limited minutes and data, the VHF radio we all have onboard is the way to communicate. ""Hey man watcha up to?"" ""That dude just came by and gave me a diesel heater for my boat."" ""Nice!"" ""I don't know where I'm gonna put it. I really don't want to cut a hole in my deck either."" ""Yeah with your layout I wouldn't know where to put it either. If you're gonna hit the church later I'd love to tag along. I can hook you up with some propane to cover your cost on that a little."" ""Yeah I'm getting ready to leave here shortly. I'll shoot you a text."" ""Cool. I'll get my act together. Out.""

I drag a comb through my sickness slicked hair, grab what's left of my Winstons, lighter, wallet, shades, hoodie, boat lock, keys. I'm really looking forward to a good meal and a nice hot shower. Text, ""Omw."" 

He doesn't mean he's closing the boat down, getting in the dinghy, and heading my way. I look out the door, his dinghy has left his boat headed my way. Answering this text is futile. I don't bother. Double check I've got everything, open a couple portlights for ventilation, out of the boat, companionway hatch shut and latched, door closed and locked. He pulls up on the port side of my boat two minutes later. Trash bag in his bow, me and my hoodie in his dinghy. 

He takes off slowly as I'm going for a seat. He only does this because he knows I'm not gonna lose my balance. It's not a dick move. I'm so used to working, standing, walking, and moving stuff from boat to boat in bouncy conditions. It ain't no thing. 

Some chatting about his fucked up family, a little about the new leak I've got that doesn't make a lot of sense to either of us. It seems a lot of boats both in the river and on the other side of the causeway, either ran aground on shore or sank in that storm my dinghy left in.

Both our boats... Perfectly ok. But we don't fuck around with our ground tackle. We've both spent whatever it took to get that straight. Me back in the early days. He's caught up on a couple things to where I'm at right before the back to back hurricanes that hit before I left. 

You ever spend $135 on a 35 foot rope? Hashtag Boatlife! 😆 I got to buy a 100 foot rope. It gets a little cheaper if you order online, but not much. And if you need one in a hurry you're paying $4-$5 a foot at the local boat supply shop. Very specific types of rope. Has to handle several thousand pounds of force. Mine has a break strength of 31,000 pounds.

We both have full size backup anchors ready to go on the bow. Run through our bow rollers and cleated off. Just toss it over, after you make your way up there on a bouncing boat in a storm, and pray it grabs. Or at least slows you down enough for your primary anchor to reset. We've both got two different but very sticky anchors onboard each boat.

We hit the docks on the pier. I go to tie off his bow rope. ""I'll get that. Everyone wants to help and that's the only time things go wrong."" ""Oh I know, but it's me."" ""You're right. Sorry man."" He gives me a look that says, 'I have complete faith in you, I'm just not used to you being here.' ""No worries. I don't trust anybody's knots but my own either."" We laugh knowingly.

Trash out of boat, in trash can. We head down the pier cathing up. Him, ""I never got to bilging your boat out. Right after I got the rundown of how to do it on your boat from you that storm came up and blew for days. Then it got fucking cold here."" "" No worries."" I can understand that. It really hadn't rained much while I was gone. That was my only real concern. And in hindsight maybe him catching the new leak, but it appears it might stabilize on it's own, and didn't start until I got back.

Off to the church. I'm pretty happy to not be bumming smokes off him. There was two or three months before I left where I was completely flat broke with an unusable dinghy that I couldn't fix. He really went out of his way a lot to keep me alive out here.

No shower truck at church. (I have a shower on the boat, but I used the bucket I put my shower pump in to keep my backpack out of the water when I left. I'll figure something else out. Part of boat life is sometimes working with what you got.) New people have taken over. Inside. Usual prayer before we eat. Self service for food. Chicken enchiladas, baked Mac 'n Cheese, a killer salad, salsa, sour cream, beef chilli, bread, rice crispy treats... All home made! Some other various deserts, coffee with a few different creamers and sugar, tea if you're into that, bottled waters. Plenty for everyone to eat as much as they want.

It's a pretty good group that goes to this place. We're in a decent area of this broke county, and all of the usual nightmare homeless won't make the trek this far from downtown. Lots of friendly greetings, a few 'We tried looking for your boat to see if it was ok after the storm', a few questions about the trip. I tear this wonderful food up and thoroughly enjoy a couple cups of coffee. It ain't quite as strong as boat coffee, but I'm very grateful to be sitting in a chair comfortably drinking it at my leisure. That meal was *exactly* what I needed.

Me and friend bail out for a smoke. Some more chatting. I can feel our friendship going right back to normal. Back inside. They start calling names to run down the line picking out food pantry items to take with us. I don't have refrigeration yet on the boat so I usually stick to some bakery deliciousness from Publix. I always grab a thing of meat for my friend.

Another boater we know comes over talking about a little construction work he's got coming up, wants me to get in on it. This guy tends to party like we don't. Keeps it under raps for the most part, but I'll believe it when I see it. I tell him I'm bailing real soon for some work. Give him my number.

We're out. Back to the pier. Food in dinghy. Friend's got some business to tend to. We hang out. More catching up. 

The reason he's using one pound propane cans on his dinghy motor is because he has old aluminum twenty pound tanks which are good on boats, but the hose that came with the motor doesn't fit right and leaks. He's got a bad freeze burn on his hand from attempting to hook one of his tanks up when he got the motor. 

Him, ""Hey do you mind if we try that hose on your propane tank and see if it leaks?"" ""Yeah man of course."" I go use the bathroom at the library. Come back. ""Hey if you're cool with it, and that hose works, you mind running  down to go see if my dinghy is still there and towing it back to the boat? We'll use my twenty pound tank. I'd much rather fix mine than buy a new one, especially with my current net worth."" ""Yeah we can do that."" ""Cool.""

Of course, everything takes five times longer if there's a boat involved. The sun sets before he gets his stuff handled. Neither of us is gonna go out in the dark for what is a solid two hour dinghy ride to go hopefully get my dinghy. 

Back down the pier. Into his dinghy. Out to his boat to get adapter hose. Over to my boat. Tank out of cockpit, up on deck. Hose attached. Valve open...

No leak! Success!

""As soon as you got time let's go see about my dinghy."" ""I got this trial, etc."" ""Yeah I get it. I'll put off work for a day, maybe two. But if it comes down to it I'm gonna blow that dinghy off and go make money."" ""Yeah..."" ""Let me know as soon as you can run me down there."" ""Yeah man. Will do."" ""Cool. Thanks man!"" ""You're welcome."" Off he goes back to his boat.

This is the first day since the flu hit that I can move anymore than bathroom breaks and eating ready to eat food. I still feel like shit, but I can remain upright for a while.

I open the boat up. Head down below. 'Musty in here.' Open hatches. The wind is dead calm. The water's been glass pretty much all week. 'You know what? I've got a freshly filled propane tank, and a heater in here. Fuck it. It's time to toast this boat and get some air circulating in here. Take tent light into cockpit. Hook twenty foot propane hose up to tank. I already had the other end hooked to the heater from when I hit the boat, just never finished the execution. I try to get the heater going. Pilot flame is small, won't stay lit after usual twenty second hold. Several tries later, 'Maybe some percussive maintenance will help. Where's that hammer? Right where it should be. Just the way I like it. 😁' 

Holding knob down in pilot position, lightly tapping bottom of heater. Well, not too lightly. Just lightly enough to not damage it. Flame gets bigger with each solid tap and drops back down again. A few minutes of this it starts to stay big enough to heat the thermocouple that let's the gas flow to the burner. Pilot now staying lit on it's own. Everything goes out when I switch to heat mode. 'Hmmm thermocouple is probably stuck.' Grab screw driver. Get pilot going. Reach screwdriver through grate. Tap thermocouple a bunch of times. Turn knob. Hear gas, but pilot is still not as big as it should be to get heater going...

Woooosh! Heater fires up. 'Might've lost a few hairs on that one. 😆' Heater burns off general salt funk from fire brick. Operates flawlessly. It's done this thing where it will run great for about twenty minutes and then make squealing noises and shut down. I've learned how to tear it apart and clean it out and get it running good again. I'm hoping having an actually full twenty pound tank, instead of the fifteen you get when you swap one out will force this thing to act right. I haven't fired it up since last winter.

All was well. I shut it off after about an hour and a half. It's not actually cold in the boat, but it was nice to be toasty for a while and relax.

Got all my hodgepodge self wired lights going in the boat. Solar system seems to be doing a good job still. Got some tunes going. 'Bout to burn one of my last few Winstons...

Hopefully boat checks, battery maintenance, and leak cause determination tomorrow.

And, if I'm really lucky, getting my dinghy back in the next day or two...

I’m struggling to figure out if I’m being unreasonable or if my concerns are valid. Here’s the situation:

My girlfriend is a professional artist, and she used to collaborate creatively with her ex for fun. We’ve been dating for about 2 years now. Early in our relationship, her ex made an incredibly inappropriate comment, suggesting he’d like to watch us have sex. Ever since, I’ve felt really uncomfortable about him, and there was even a period where they didn’t talk.

Eventually, they reconnected and became friends again. I can tell this guy still has feelings for her, and it seems like my girlfriend enjoys the attention. It’s made me feel like she might be keeping her options open, even if she doesn’t realize it. They occasionally meet for walks or coffee, and I’ve set some boundaries to protect my comfort level. Specifically, I asked that they avoid more intimate settings—like dinners or hanging out alone at her home.

She’s been pushing back, saying I’m insecure and that I should trust her regardless of the setting. I’ve been in therapy for five months now, working on my trust issues, (been cheated on & mommy abandonment stuff ) but I’ve also made it clear this is a dealbreaker for me. 

Today, she brought it up again, saying she doesn’t want to let her friendship with her ex die and hopes we can move past this. I feel stuck. I’m trying to be fair, but I also want to respect my own boundaries and comfort level.

so I come from a background of ""coffee=instant"" and that's what I drank for most of my life, couple years back I randomly bought aeropress, but with 0 research and knowledge, buying preground grocery store coffee and using random amounts of everything, I decided it's not really any better than instant while having a lot less convenience so I stopped using it.


but lately after drinking some nice coffee in a cafe and somehow finding myself in a loop of youtube vidoes about coffee I wanted to give it a honest try this time. I bought a grinder, scales and the ""flow control"" thingy for the aeropress. as well as some coffee beans that sounded nice

having watched (kind of at random) different videos about coffee, I now realize there is a lot of different aspects that impact the taste etc. that being said, it was mostly just mentions about it and not a real guide.

what I'm looking for is:

1. a starting point, I'm completely lost on where to start with, how much coffee, how much water, how fine to grind, how long to brew etc. 

2. after having a starting point, I would like to know what are the  ""levers"" I can pull to impact the taste, i.e. if I find that the coffee is too bitter, what do I change? If it's too ""watery"" what do I change? etc

My husband knows I grew up in a town that had a lot of burglaries. My neighbors when I was a kid, The Newbies, kept having stuff stolen until they installed a security system. So, I think my husband knew I was nervous about this woman, because he squeezed my hand reassuringly. 

She came into talking about how great it was to get a cup of coffee because she doesn’t have a machine yet. She also started saying how great our bath was. The last straw was when she told us the ending to the movie we were watching! I started yelling at her to get out of my house. She quickly left muttering that I shouldn’t be such a llama. Any chance to be romantic was ruined. 

My husband complained that I was very harsh, seeing as we know all our neighbors so she probably was just the new neighbor for the house that was just built.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-34 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

I have several compost systems going in my food forest, one is a hot compost system, currently about 6’x6’ that is a mixture of last years garden plants, alfalfa, composted horse/steer manure, wood shavings, etc. I also have a vermiculture bin going really well too. I wanted to create a third option by raking leaves from the neighborhood (cottonwood, sycamore, oak) and piling them within a roll of 5’ fence I had, which is similar to one of those bio bins I thought. 

I started the leaf compost pile a little after Christmas, added a bit of my hot compost mix (maybe five to ten gallons layered in), wet it and turned it once a week. It quickly got up to 145° which was great, but a week later it tempered down to 90° and I haven’t been able to get it to climb. I left town for a while, and came home to still see it sitting in the 80-90° range and it compacted a decent amount. 

Now I have added another couple truck beds full of leaves on top, wet the pile again (it was pretty dry due to being left alone for three weeks) and I haven’t started adding biochar from a pile of brush I have been burning to get out of my yard. 

I’m wondering if biochar is going to hinder my attempts to get it back up to an active temperature, or if I just keep adding the golden liquid of my loins, along with some coffee grounds from local coffee shops. 

Can I add too much biochar to the leaf pile? so far I have probably added 100lbs or so (five to six wheelbarrows) and gently mixed it into the top two feet of leaves. I want to utilize this leaf mulch/compost/mould/whatever to mulch my fruit trees in the spring. Starting it in December wasn’t going to give me much time to get it broken down, I thought since most of the leaves were fairly brown and crispy, so I have been trying to find ways to speed up the process. It’s currently kinda tough to find good nitrogen sources due to the weather and I want to save the manure for the hot compost pile I already have going. I have also read that adding too much manure around trees can be less than optimal. 

I also wanted to thank this sub for all of the quality content, it has really lit a fire in me to be more sustainable with my food waste, yard/garden organic material and my piss. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk.",1,1738290135.0,composting,0,1.0,False

Pain was very bad every day from morning until night, went to my doctor not much help from him so I was on my own but is has improved greatly since then to the 
point that I basically forgotten about it daily. I would look on this site for help and see what has worked for other people so I will report on what has worked for me in the hope that I can help others. Here is what I have done:

:Othortics from amazon in my shoes, the ones I use are called pinnacle the blue coloured ones. The have helped outside of the house.


:  I have a TRX strength trainer that I have been using daily. I have been doing a arms and shoulders and a chest and back 15 minute routine daily routine. I wanted to build some muscle in my chest and back because I have gotten lazy in my old age ( 63 btw). The exercises that I do have alot of foot and arch stretch to them so I'm killing two birds with one stone by doing this.

: I take a low dose of naproxen every morning,  200mg with my coffee and I roll a foot massager under my foot while I drink my coffee. It's just a wooden one with some raised pattern on it to stimulate my foot in the am. The naproxen is just an over the counter NSAID from my pharmacy. I know drugs are not the answer but it really helps me for the whole day.

: I have a massage therapist that I go to once a month and have her beat the living hell out of my feet and calves for a solid half hour the other half hour is back and shoulders because damn it feels good. You will be tender for a day or so after each session but then it gets better after that. I used to have coverage for this with my employer when I was working but that is long gone and now I pay out of my own pocket. It's a $100 per hour and she is a legit RMT.

: If I am sitting watching tv I will massage my foot or use the wooden roller as well.

: I play indoor golf once a week and it is good for foot movement and stretching as well. A month ago I would have thought my golf days were over but yet here i am playing.

This is what i have done to make my life tolerable since and the improvement from Xmas on has been fairly dramatic. I also always wear something on my feet around the house at all times but  I have found myself walking around without shoes without even realizing that I forgot my slippers. Getting up to pee at 4 am is still tender but nothing like the discomfort I had a month or so ago.  

So for all of you out there don't give up hope and try many things ,some of these  things may help you or maybe they won't but you have to try. The key for me is the naproxen, massage and the strength training I believe and movement even if it hurts to do so.

I initially met them at work and connected via linked in, then coffee chatted them last summer. In the fall I reached out to them but didn’t hear back for a couple months. In that waiting time I think I followed up once or twice. When they replied they apologized for missing my message and expressed having a family matter that caused them to be out of office. I responded to their message stating my understanding and appreciation of their efforts but since then haven’t heard anything again. This was in mid November. I followed up a few weeks later, and then a final time in the new year. Every time I have corresponded with them I have been professional and acknowledged their time and efforts. When they have answered and connected they have been very receptive and willing to assist me. I haven’t heard still since November and am wondering if I should accept that they might not answer. I am very keen on connecting with this person and am wondering how many times is too many to follow up. I know persistence is key but I don’t wanna come off as bothersome to them. Any advice would be great. 

Also as a side note. In the email that they did respond to, I mentioned to them that if now was not a good time or they weren’t interested in connecting with me to let me know.
