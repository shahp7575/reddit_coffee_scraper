This community wouldn’t let me post images, but here’s the write up…

S tier: Relyte and Saltt

A tier: Gu 

B tier: Liquid IV, Buoy

C Tier: LMNT, Gatorade drink mix in, Nuun
 

Allow me to explain… 

Nuun leaves chunks in your water and isn’t the saltiest. LMNT, on the other hand, is a fan favorite but was too salty for me. They don’t even try to hide pot, giving names like ‘raspberry salt’. Gatorade is a good drink but a terrible drink mix. Bad flavor, lots of sweetener, bad dissolving.

Next tier, buoy. I tried their unflavored drops. Of course they were t unflavored and added a weird texture to my drink. I will add them to my juice, coffees, smoothies, but cannot have it in plain water or black tea. Also on this tier, Liquid IV. Simply not my thing in flavor, and I like little more salt in mine. It’s also pretty expensive.

Next tier, Gu. I loved this one for so long but can no longer drink it because even smelling it gives me a headache, likely because I drank 100 Oz of the same flavor every day for a year. I also don’t like the carbonation, but over all it is a great electrolyte.

Top tier, relyte. This one takes the cake. You can buy in bulk and it comes in tubs so it’s cheaper and you can add however much you want. Flavors are great, it has lots of salt and things like potassium and magnesium. It also uses Stevia instead of real sugar to make it more healthy. This one is AMAZING.

Saltt is pretty new to me and their flavors are hit or miss , but the good ones are really good. I love the flavor, it is REALLY salty and I can feel the difference after drinking this.

Feel free to ask any questions about my tier list! Hope this helps!",1,1745463465.0,ChronicIllness,0,1.0,False

The territories I said I'd be open to are 
Option 1 - CO + NM + AZ + UT 
Option 2 - SC + NC + GA + Eastern TN + North FL 

I picked these 2 because I'm from CO, so that's easy. And I grew up going to the SE coast and I love that whole region. I don't mind humidity. 

I currently have lived in Chicago for a year and determined quickly while I love the walkibility and access to lots of art and culture... the weather has been a heavy wet blanket on my back since November and I'm okay never going through winter and spring in Chicago. I am originally from Northern CO. 

Things that are important to me: 
(1) urban - ish, a town or city that has a walkable area i can live in, cute local shops, coffee shops, good restaurants, yoga studios, art galleries 
(2) art scene, film/acting scene would be amazing 
(3) some kind of natural beauty to escape to easily 
(4) weather better than Chicago

Iv been trying to detox while still living in the mold, I sleep downstairs away from the mold but my computer room is upstairs in the mold still. The mold isn’t visible in the room but outside of my windows there is a lot of black mold on the roof and I suspect the mold is in the carpet inside my computer room.

So far iv lost 25kgs, gained some cognition back and able to work 3-4 days a week now from nothing

I just can’t seem to beat low libido (my balls have atrophied), IBS, Brain fog etc. 

Iv finally ordered a dehumidifier and air purifier for my computer room but not sure if that’s even going to help. Did it help any of you? 

My main question is what’s the best way to overcome Ochratoxin A? It seems like one of the hardest to beat. Iv tried turpentine, Iv done so many coffee enemas and 18 liver gallbladder flushes, saunas, so many other supplements but I’m still only 40% healed I think.

I’m looking into CDS/MMS and food grade hydrogen peroxide, along with HBOT and ozone therapy but far out it’s getting expensive. Iv spent atleast 60k on my health the last 2 years of being sick and it’s getting too much for me. 

What should I do? Iv been arguing with my parents to let me change rooms completely to downstairs which has no carpet and isn’t as humid but it’s been a struggle as they don’t really understand what’s going on.

1k6hs6e,https://www.reddit.com/r/luxsolotravel/comments/1k6hs6e/review_of_vietnam/,Review of Vietnam,"Hey Everyone, this sub has been quiet so I thought I would post a review of my recent trip to Vietnam! Feel free to ask any questions if you have them. 

Length of Trip: 2 weeks 
Time of year: Mid to Late March
Cities visited: Ho Chi Minh (Saigon), Hoi An, Da Nang, Hue, Hanoi

Ho Chi Minh is a super fast-paced and modern city for Vietnam, arriving here in a heat wave the city never went below 30 degrees C (90 Fahrenheit) The locals were also very friendly and the city was easy to navigate, a lot less touristy so there were far fewer store vendors trying to sell/barter. The Post office and Saigon Opera House are a bit overrated but if you have time they are lovely to see!
Favourite activity: Bui Vien Street, unmissable!! The energy was amazing, cheap drinks and the best people watching. 
Favourite bar: LeFe Rooftop bar on Bui Vien Street, the best view of the street and a quieter setting to chill out before going back down to the craziness of the street.

Hoi an: Tourist central but not in a bad way! Hoi an is set up to accomodate a huge amount of tourists who stay there or do day visits from Da Nang. Easily the most beautiful city I visited and with the best shopping! Vendors here are very pushy and everyone will be calling you into their shops so if thats not your thing I would avoid. Food and coffee here were the best basically everywhere you go.
Favourite actvitiy: Early morning tour (5:30am) of My Son and Marble Mountains with Hoi An Local Tours Company Ltd. This tour was incredible, the sites were amazing but the vehicle and small group made the expereince so much nicer + the early morning meant no lines or crowds!
Best coffee: Uncle Huan's coffee
Best cafe/cooking class: Chickpea Eatery

Da Nang: This was easily my favourite place, very modern city and has a lot of ""western comforts"". Da Nang is a great place to have in the middle of your trip  because if you miss western comforts you will find them here! The beaches were all great and the traffic was the most chill out of anywhere I went in Vietnam. Perfect place in the middle of your trip to have 3-4 relaxing beach days.
Hotel: Sofiana My Khe Hotel & Spa - highly recommend!! Lovely staff and a great spa.
Favourite food: Roots Plant-based cafe, has great raw vegan healthy deserts!
Favourite activity: Hue Imperial city Full-day tour with My Viet trip, this was a really lovely tour of Hue with some great stops along the way it was a LONG day though my tour was 11 hours.

Hanoi: Hanoi was unfortunately probably my least favourite city in Vietnam, beer street was great and there were plenty of good restaurants and stores but overall I don't think it interested me enough Plenty to do if you want to be out each night drinking and partying! The lake was beautiful and the French Quarter was lovely for morning coffee walks. From Hanoi I also did an overnight river cruise of Ha Long Bay, it is amazing but the quality of boats is hugely variable!! So be super careful when you book as sometimes when you book they use misleading photos or photos of completely different boats! 
Hotel: Mina Hotel and Spa, lovely hotel with a great rooftop! Staff were great and the location is perfect, central but not noisy. 

Overall I loved Vietnam, I am predominately vegan and it was incredibly easy for me to find vegan-friendly food everywhere I went (especially Da Nang). The locals were lovely and I found other tourists to be friendly too, no issues at all making friends at bars or on tours. I think the tailors in Hoi An are a bit overrated but buying off-the-rack silk shirts is a no-brainer there, so cheap! Hotels, restaurants and spas were all great quality at super low prices. Going in March was okay but the weather was getting cooler the further south I went, I would recommend booking in April or May for hot but still dry weather. I will go back and explore more of Vietnam! It would be very easy to stay for a month +",1,1745463045.0,luxsolotravel,0,1.0,False

1k6hj7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1k6hj7q/should_i_stay_friends_with_person_a_because_of/,Should i stay friends with person A because of our kids?,"Background:
I grew up in a small town in East Europe where everyone knew everyone. I had siblings, bunch of cousins and my neighborhood was full of kids. I used to play wholeday, everyday outside with kids younger, older and my age. But now, I moved to big city in Florida. City where people don't know their neighbors and city full of old people. It didn't bother me until I got a kid. Now  I got 5 year old and my kid almost has no friends. My kids cousins live far away, there are no kids in the neighborhood, only time my kid plays with other kids it is at school, soccer practice, mosque and if I take my kid to park. I hate this, I want my kid to have a childhood friends or at least one chilhood friend. Most of my friends are not married, the few that are married either don't have kids or just got a little baby. None of them have 5 year old kid.

Problem:
Now, at the coffee shop I go to with my friends, i meet a person A. He overheard us talking about economy and jumped into conversation. Person A is 15 years oldet than me and he has 5 year old kid, he is kind of in same boat as me. Except, his friends have kids but they are all in high school, too old to play with his kid. So A and I,  became friends and we started doing play dates. At first I was so happy because our kids like to play with each other. He is also from East europe so that was huge plus. 

But, there is always but, lol. But A is divorced, his ex-wife has the kid every other week. Therefore when he has a kid, he wants to maximize the time with it. He wants to be a favorite parent. A takes the kid out of school early just so kid can have more play time. This is something I would never do, bydw. A also spoils his kid like crazy, giving it all the junk food his kids want, unlimited screen time, constantly buying toys and getting membership for his kid into all kids of indoor parks. A is then constantly pushing me to do the same, but there is no way.

Another thing that bothers me about person A, and I think this might be because we belong to different generations. 15 years age gape. But if I want to cancle plans with my friends, I would just txt them, saying that I can't make it. But with person A this is not possible. He would start calling me and would not stop until I pick up. When I do then he would ask me why am I canceling. Our conversation would go like this:

Person A: hey, what is going on?
Me: oh, I can't do a play date today, I am going to go play soccer with my friends.

Person A: man, forget about soccer, tell them your leg hurts, that you can't make it.
Me: nah, to late I already told them I am coming. I haven't play in a while I miss it.

Person A: soccer is stupid. You are too old to play kids sports. Our kids will never be 5 again, we should spend time with them.
Me: our kids will be 5 tomorrow, let's do play date tomorrow.

Person A: where are you leaving your kid, today when you go play soccer?
Me: at my moms, she didn't see her grandkid in forever!

Person A: you can bring your kid to my house, my kid is crying want to play with your kid, I hate when my kid cries, I cant take it. 
Me: but I already told my mom. She is excited to babysit.

Person A: i am about to put my kid on the phone, so you can her it cry. You tell it not to cry, you tell it why it can't see your kid.

As you guys can see, this is so annoying. Last time we had a play date it was at a festival and his kid got board in 10 minutes and wanted to leave. I didn't want to leave but left because person A kept begging me to listen to his kids desires. We then went to McDonald's, and person A bought us junk food from there. Then we went to some indoor park where he has membership. After 30 minutes of indoor park the kid wanted to go to Chuky Cheese. I was like: f that, I am going home. I am not following little 5 year old with no attention span commands. 

Question:
I am seriously considering telling person A not to call me anymore and that we will never do play dates again. But at same time my kid will never have a friend. Am I being selfish or is this some crazy behavior? ",1,1745462287.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

Found this subreddit and wanted to have a safe/non-judgmental space to get some ugly thoughts and feelings off my chest that I didn't feel appropriate on the other thread.  Yes, I'm being mean/petty and resentful, I know - hence I'm calling them my ugly thoughts.  
  
There's a nuance here I can't seem to verbalize.  
  
I’m frustrated there were views of having to accept someone in my life that I don't want to nor feel I should have to as a sign of maturity. It reinforces the feeling of not being seen, heard, understood or respected by my in-laws as this is what they think we should be doing as well.   
  
I feel her needs and comfort are prioritized over mine and my husband. While I agree safety is of utmost importance - I'm not heartless -  I truly think there are different ways to go about this problem where we all have our needs met.   
  
However, there has been no concessions, effort to try, or recognize the emotional/logistical impact it has on me and my husband.

Long and short of it is that my in-laws are taking care of my husband's ex wife and she lives with them. She's 31, and has been living with them for over a decade during the course of her relationship with my husband and post-divorce.   
  
She's clothed, fed, and housed by the generosity of his parents and she has not made any efforts to improve her life outside of hitting the gym post divorce. If she goes to therapy and they call her out, they are suddenly ""not a good fit"", when she got a job she quit within the month because she was ""bullied"" or it was too hard on her physically (or so I’m told by my husband because I don’t speak to my in-laws aside from cordial exchanges).  
  
She does not have any known impairments other than the fact that she comes from an allegedly abusive family so she does not have a home she wants to or can go back to. My husband divorced her due to the lack of any contribution to a relationship (she basically acted as a child), gas lighting, emotional manipulation, and the covert narcissistic abuse he endured. Supposedly all unintentional because she’s immature. 

From my perspective, she has the family wrapped around her finger by playing victim and has unintentionally turned his parents against him. Basically everything she does is painted in a good light because of how ""helpless"" she is and somehow twists what he does as inappropriate or “bad” because he should know better coming from a safe family, and now by extension, me as well.

During their divorce, and well after he started a relationship with me (6 months in) they still pushed him to talk to her, be friends, and comfort her when she's upset or say on his behalf that he still cares as a friend.  When she throws a fit, starts crying, they all rush in to comfort her and force him to take her out for coffee, be cordial and ""mature"" etc. He did this at the beginning of our relationship until I put my foot down on how inappropriate it is when I found out. 

Long and short of it, I don't think it's wrong of me or my husband; who wants to move on with his life, to not be reminded of his past if he's trying to be with his family, nor have to accept her as part of our lives simply because his parents see her as an adoptive daughter. 

He has an ex-wife, not a child.  
  
That chapter has closed and we want to move on.   
  
I'm tired of the fact that they can’t understand that she’s not **just** their pseudo-daughter. She has a past with their son and involving her in every single daily activity with the family, holidays and being in their home does not give space for my husband to move on, nor for me to feel that I have a role in the family or accepted as the wife if someone is already being treated as such. I'm not trying to replace her, simply be accepted as a new family member and redefine boundaries.

It irks me because family is important to me and I have dreamed of having a close relationship with my in-laws.  
  
Her role and place in the family has not been redefined for me to feel like I have that space. I don’t feel I’m being super pick me or petty - again, not trying to say the parents need to cut all ties, but simply help her grow, move on, and give space for their son (and I) to be part of their lives in parallel vs. forcing us to all get along. 

The lack of effort for them to acknowledge or understand us makes me feel like an outsider, and them calling us childish for not being able to be friends while praising how amazing she is for wanting to be friends (well duh her livelihood is dependent on keeping them happy to stay there!) makes me resentful.

Thank you for letting me vent.

All communication with the inlaws has been through my husband, it's his problem to solve, his baggage to clear up, but I can't help but feel like collateral damage. Yes, I signed up for it but I didn't realize how deep it went or long it's going to keep going. ",1,1745462172.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

correct me if i'm wrong (which i probably am) but the whole point of it was that even though Blaine left Dalton he still has an attachment to The Warblers and they supposedly don't have anywhere else to go but realistically, is there not another school in Westerville they can go to?

let's say the warblers had to go to McKinley high everyday for real classes and not just for glee club practices. all of them would have to travel about 1 hour and 30 minutes to Lima for a 6/7 hour school day then back to Westerville which would be another 1 hour and 30 minutes and they'd have to do that 5 days a week

i *know* it's not that deep and it's just a tv show but it's one of the many inconsistencies/plot holes in the show and out of all of them it's the most confusing one in my opinion but again it's kinda been awhile since i watched the show so i could be remembering it all wrong 

and another thing which is kinda unrelated, the Lima bean is in Lima which once again, Lima is 1 hour and 30 minutes away from Westerville so why are some of The Warblers (well technically just Sebastian) always showing up there? why is he taking an hour an a half long trip just to get coffee? are there not any coffee shops in Westerville? how is he getting there? like i've said it's been awhile since i watched the show but as far as i can remember he never talked about having a car so is he just magically teleporting there or what?

Each group will have a maximum of six songs as we don’t want to go over a full week, which also explains why there may not be some of your favorite category-named songs. (I limited it to maximum 2 songs per artist.)

But I was constipated for years prior to this pregnancy anyway. I always feared pregnancy would make it worse but it hasn’t. I’m not sure what or exactly when my constipation started but it may have been after a round of antibiotics I had about 5-6 years ago for an ear infection. Either way my bowels have never been the same since. Pebble poops and I’d only go every 3-4 days. Even when I’d go daily, still pebble poops. I think after awhile I just accepted it although it has always bothered me. I’ve tried drinking more water, adding fiber, magnesium, prune juice, senna tea, probiotics, gut motility supplements, etc,. Either it just didn’t work, or it made really gassy or bloated, or it would trigger motility, but still be pebble poops. The senna tea gave me cramps and diarrhea, so I wouldn’t call that a fix at all either. Anyway, fast forward to this pregnancy and I was taking a stool softener daily, Seed probiotics, magnesium citrate and electrolytes and still the same old same old. Well, I kept hearing/reading about Miralax working for some people (especially in pregnancy forums) and I was coming to the conclusion that what I was doing wasn’t working. I think I feared the Miralax because I thought it was an actual laxative and I didn’t realize it was non-habit forming. Well, I decided to start taking it daily. I got the little premade packets and have been putting it in my morning coffee for a couple weeks now. This is the first time in years I have had normal, soft bowel movements and I can’t even explain the feeling. It literally feels like a miracle.  All I can say is that I wish I had tried it sooner.

1k6h38p,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasy_books/comments/1k6h38p/through_the_unicorns_looking_glass_mike_resnicks/,Through the Unicorn's Looking Glass: Mike Resnick's John Justin Mallory and the Evolution of Urban Fantasy Noir,"In a literary landscape where worlds collide and reality bends, few series have captured the delightful absurdity of urban fantasy quite like Mike Resnick's chronicles of John Justin Mallory. Beginning in the late 1980s and spanning over two decades, these tales follow a hard-boiled detective from our mundane Manhattan who finds himself navigating an alternate New York where magic rules, mythological creatures roam freely, and the laws of physics take frequent coffee breaks. Through Mallory's journey, Resnick crafted a masterclass in genre-blending storytelling that combines film noir aesthetics with fantasy adventure and wry humor.
The Origin Story: ""Stalking the Unicorn"" (1987)
The journey begins on a cold New Year's Eve in 1987 with the publication of ""Stalking the Unicorn: A Fable of Tonight."" Mallory, a down-on-his-luck detective whose partner has absconded with his wife and their agency's funds, finds himself approached by Mürgenstürm, a small elf with an unusual case. The elf has lost a unicorn entrusted to his care, and if it isn't recovered by dawn, Mürgenstürm will face a fate worse than death. With nothing better to do and desperately needing the money, Mallory accepts the case, only to be drawn into a parallel Manhattan filled with fantastical creatures and peculiar rules.
What makes ""Stalking the Unicorn"" so captivating is Resnick's commitment to maintaining Mallory's hard-boiled detective persona against an increasingly bizarre backdrop. Mallory approaches this strange world with the same methodical investigation techniques and dry wit he would use for any other case. His first-person narration maintains the clipped cadence and world-weary perspective of classic noir, creating a delightful friction against the fantasy setting.
The book introduces many characters who would become series mainstays: Winnifred Carruthers, a middle-aged woman with extensive knowledge of the magical Manhattan; Felina, a cat-girl who becomes inexplicably attached to Mallory; and the Grundy, the kingpin of magical Manhattan's criminal underworld and Mallory's nemesis throughout the series.
After its publication, fans had to wait over two decades for Mallory's next adventure, but the foundation was laid for what would become a cult classic series.
The Long-Awaited Return: ""Stalking the Vampire"" (2008)
Twenty-one years passed before Resnick returned to Mallory's world with ""Stalking the Vampire: A Fable of Tonight,"" published in 2008. This gap between publications gives the series a fascinating meta-narrative quality—while only a year has passed in Mallory's world, the real world had seen massive changes in urban fantasy literature, with the genre growing exponentially in popularity.
The sequel finds Mallory now established as a detective in the magical Manhattan, having decided to stay after the events of the first book. When his partner Winnifred Carruthers appears with two puncture wounds on her neck, Mallory begins investigating her nephew, who appears to have become a vampire. The case leads him through magical Manhattan's vampire community, revealing new dimensions of this parallel world.
Resnick's writing in this second installment shows a confidence and playfulness that comes from returning to a beloved world. The tone remains consistent with the first book, but the worldbuilding expands significantly. We see more of magical Manhattan's neighborhoods, political structures, and social dynamics. The Grundy returns as a villain, though in more complex ways than before, and Felina continues to be Mallory's loyal if somewhat puzzling companion.
What's particularly notable in ""Stalking the Vampire"" is how Resnick pokes gentle fun at the vampire fiction boom that had occurred in the years between his first and second Mallory books. His vampires adhere to some traditional tropes while subverting others, maintaining the series' approach of using fantasy elements to both honor and satirize genre conventions.
The Trilogy Expands: ""Stalking the Dragon"" (2009)
Riding the momentum of the series' revival, Resnick published ""Stalking the Dragon: A Fable of Tonight"" just a year later in 2009. This time, Mallory takes on a case involving a missing pet—a prize-winning dragon the size of a Chihuahua that's been stolen before the big Eastminster pet show. The case leads Mallory through magical Manhattan's elite social circles and seedy underground, revealing yet more facets of this bizarre mirror world.
By this third installment, the series formula had been well-established: Mallory takes a case that seems straightforward but quickly becomes complicated by the magical elements of his adopted world. He relies on his pragmatic detective skills while navigating increasingly absurd scenarios, maintaining his deadpan demeanor throughout.
""Stalking the Dragon"" deepens the characterization of the supporting cast. Winnifred shows more of her past and her adaptation to working with Mallory, while Felina's attachment to Mallory develops in unexpected ways. The Grundy's role in magical Manhattan becomes more nuanced, revealing the complex ecosystem of power in this alternate reality.
Resnick's worldbuilding grows more ambitious here, introducing concepts like pet shows for magical creatures and the social hierarchies among different fantasy species. The humor becomes more self-assured as well, with Resnick finding the perfect balance between noir mystery and fantasy comedy.
Expanding the Universe: The Mallory Short Stories
Between and after the novels, Resnick expanded Mallory's world through several short stories that appeared in various anthologies and magazines. Stories like ""The Chinese Sandman"" (2002), ""Card Shark"" (2008), ""Stalking the Zombie"" (2012), and others allowed Resnick to explore smaller cases and character moments that wouldn't sustain full novels.
These short stories showcase Resnick's versatility with the character and setting. Some lean more heavily into the comedy aspects, others emphasize the noir mystery elements, but all maintain the distinctive voice and worldview that make Mallory such an enduring character.
The short stories also allowed Resnick to collaborate with other writers. ""The Long and Short of It"" (2012), co-written with Jody Lynn Nye, brings Mallory into contact with other detectives from magical Manhattan, highlighting how his ""mundane world"" approach differs from those who grew up in this fantastical realm.
By this point, Mallory had evolved from a fish-out-of-water protagonist to something of an institution in magical Manhattan—still an outsider in many ways, but respected for his unique approach to solving the realm's problems. His relationships with Winnifred and Felina had deepened, and even his antagonistic dynamic with the Grundy had developed nuances.
Resnick's passing in 2020 means the Mallory series is now complete, giving it a distinct beginning, middle, and end—something increasingly rare in fantasy literature, where series often extend indefinitely. The four novels and handful of short stories provide a complete arc for the character and his world, while leaving enough unexplored territory that readers can imagine Mallory continuing his investigations.
A Genre-Defining Series
Looking at the Mallory series as a whole reveals Resnick's significant contribution to urban fantasy. Though the first book predates what we now consider the urban fantasy boom, it contains many elements that would become staples of the genre: the collision of mundane and magical worlds, the noir-influenced protagonist, the alternate version of a familiar city, and the mixture of mystery plotting with fantastical elements.
What sets the Mallory books apart, even decades after they began, is their distinctive tone. Where many urban fantasy series opt for gritty darkness or epic scale, Resnick maintained a perfect balance of hardboiled detective fiction, fantasy adventure, and gentle satire. Mallory never loses his pragmatic approach or his dry wit, no matter how bizarre his surroundings become.
The series also stands out for its willingness to embrace the absurd. While many urban fantasy authors strive to make their magical elements seem plausible or internally consistent, Resnick revels in the inherent silliness of concepts like demon-possessed subway trains or unicorns running numbers rackets. Yet this absurdity never undermines the genuine mysteries at the heart of each story or the authentic human connections between characters.
Through the Looking Glass
There's something wonderfully meta about the Mallory series when viewed across its full publication timeline. Beginning before urban fantasy was a recognized genre, going dormant during its rise to prominence, and then returning when the genre had become established, the series serves as both a forerunner and a commentary on urban fantasy's evolution.
Mallory himself undergoes a parallel journey—from a man out of place in a world he doesn't understand to someone who has found a niche in that world while maintaining his original identity. He never fully acclimates to magical Manhattan's strangeness, and that's the point. His outsider perspective is precisely what makes him valuable in this world, just as Resnick's distinctive approach to urban fantasy set his work apart from the crowd.
In the end, John Justin Mallory's adventures remain a unique landmark in fantasy literature—a perfect cocktail of noir mystery, fantasy worldbuilding, and humor that continues to delight readers. Through his looking glass of unicorns, vampires, dragons, and cat-girls, we see not just a distorted reflection of our world, but a perspective on genre fiction that remains as fresh and engaging today as when Mallory first crossed the threshold between worlds on that fateful New Year's Eve.

I'm an experienced barista in both specialty coffee and what I'll generously refer to as ""mainstream coffee,"" but I only have a theoretical knowledge of roasting at best. I'm pretty familiar with the flavor wheel, origins, etc., and have a pretty solid idea what I like in a coffee (I tend to favor lighter roasts with pronounced brightness and fruity notes) and would like to try my hand at creating something that satisfies my tastes more than what I can find at the grocery store or my current place of work. I've browsed sites like Sweet Maria's and this sub extensively and I'm seeing a ton of info regarding everything from absolute bare-bones setups ranging from the oven to  various combinations of household objects to personal-size purpose-built roasters, but I still just don't feel confident deciding which will be most suited to my purposes. 

I'll be roasting primarily indoors (possibly outside occasionally in the summer) in a relatively small apartment. I have a hood over my stove, but it's old and not super powerful, and a large window and screen door off my kitchen for ventilation. I have plenty of fans for dispersing smoke, but I'd still like to deal with as little as reasonably possible. I'd also like to keep fire risk to a minimum (I've set my kitchen on fire before and I'm not looking to repeat the experience) and contain chaff as much as possible. I don't expect to do a ton of dark roasts but would still like it to be an option so I can experiment. I don't anticipate needing to roast large amounts at once but am limited to being able to do it once or twice a week max so need to be able to make enough for one to two espressos or pourovers a day over the course of a few days. For me, probably the most important factor is being able to consistently replicate a roast once I have a quality I'm satisfied with. I can spend up to a few hundred dollars to set myself up but also don't want to waste money on something with more features than I need or know how to use, so I've been considering the Whirly Pop as possibly the best fit. Can someone confirm that this sounds like a good choice? You folks on this sub seem to be a wealth of information, so I'm hoping someone with more experience can point me in the right direction, and maybe suggest other factors I might not have thought about before I get too invested.

God (yes, that one) and Satan (ditto) once attended the same cosmic office party.
There was ambrosia. There was brimstone punch. There were questionable slow-dance decisions that only make sense when you’ve downed three chalices of Pure Existence and you’re both old enough that eternity itself has lost its novelty.

Nine-ish celestial months later—because time is a suggestion when you’re omnipotent—Eric Smith happened.

Both parents took one look at the squirming fusion of halo-glow and sulfur-fume and said, “Nope.”
In the resulting custody argument (a shrieking, galaxy-cracking blame-match that ended when Reality filed a restraining order against them both), Eric was punted onto a hovering, mottled chunk of metaphysical backwash locals call Eyearth.

Thus condemned, Eric did what any unloved half-angel, half-devil would do:
he sulked under a broken streetlamp that dripped holy water one minute and magma the next, kicked a dent in a passing cherub-cockroach hybrid, and decided to hate literally everything.

Cue the jazzy doom overture.

1 ▪ WELCOME TO EYEARTH, MAYBE DON’T TOUCH ANYTHING
Eyearth isn’t round. It’s a jagged floating plank of urban detritus glued to a thundercloud. Skyscrapers jut in impossible angles like crooked teeth; alleys bleed fluorescent mucus; vending machines dispense existential dread for loose change.

Tattered billboards howl contradictory slogans:

BE GOOD—OR ELSE!
BUY SIN! BUY SIN!
SMILE ☺ WHILE YOUR ORGANS ROT!

Eric reads them, spits a glob of half-halo plasma (it sizzles, smells like burnt cupcakes), and mutters,
“Such inspiring civic engagement.”

(Authorial Aside™: Yes, he’s fluent in sarcasm; it was his first language after Screaming-at-Birth.)

Inside his skull, two voices bicker:

Shame—a faint, nasally angel-chirp with permanent coffee jitters:
We should find purpose! Maybe feed the poor wretches!

Rage—a guttural demon-growl that sounds like a chainsaw gargling nails:
Let’s puree them and drink the marrow slushy!

Eric tells them both to shut up, which earns him weird looks from passers-by (one headless, one extra-headful). But public sanity ratings on Eyearth are… flexible.

He trudges past a cathedral-casino hybrid. Priests in roulette collars chant hymns while taking bets on which sinner will combust first. One bursts into sacrificial confetti right on cue. The croupier rings a bell. Applause. A dove steals someone’s eyeball and flies off.

Eric sighs. “Peak civilization.”

2 ▪ A “MEANWHILE…” INTERLUDE (Because Attention Spans Are for Suckers)
MEANWHILE—in a sewer shaped like a Möbius strip—
two bureaucrat cherublings stamp DENIAL forms on applications for redemption, humming off-key. One stamps so hard he fractures the paper continuum; a soul slips through, screaming in gratitude for the clerical error.

The cherublings shrug and break into a tap-dance.
—End tangent, back to Eric—

3 ▪ CUSTOMER SERVICE IS HELL (LITERALLY)
Eric needs information: Why here? How leave?
A flickering neon sign promises INFERNEX™ VISITOR CENTER—Questions Answered, Limbs Optional.

Inside: pastel walls, motivational posters (“BURN BRIGHTER TODAY!”).
At the counter, a receptionist angel—porcelain smile, eyes like photocopiers—greets him.

“Welcome! How may I misdirect you?”

ERIC: “I am the cosmic accident of your bosses’ reckless nookie. Where do I file a refund on existence?”
RECEPTIONIST: “Awk-ward! You’ll want Form 66-6-6. We’re, um, out. Check back… never.”

Eric feels Rage purr. His palm crackles with unholy static.

Shame whispers, Diplomacy, please!
Rage roars, Staple her face to the desk!

Eric compromises: he flicks the receptionist’s halo. The delicate ring detonates into a razor-bright gyroscope, ricocheting around the lobby, shredding pamphlets and a tourist made of congealed prayers.
The tourist thanks him for the mercy of oblivion as it dissolves.

Receptionist, smoldering: “That was uncalled for.”

Eric grins. “My brand.”

Security imps rush in, wielding compliance batons (basically electrified holy relics). Eric bolts through a fire exit, which leads—of course—to a dead-end balcony suspended over a molten bureaucracy pit. Below, rejected paperwork burns, emitting screams shaped like bar graphs.

He leaps.

Mid-plummet, he remembers he might have wings. Lacking practice, they sputter like defective lawnchairs. He belly-flops onto a stack of flaming spreadsheets. Pain? Moderate. Dignity? Never existed.

(Footnote: This stunt earned 6.5 points from the watching Harpy Judges, who deduct for incomplete wing extension but applaud the splash radius.)

4 ▪ THE DEMON CALLED CUSTOMER SUPPORT
Crawling free, Eric encounters a squat, pug-faced demon entangled in telephone cords.

“Name’s Clippyath, Department of Agony Outsourcing,” it croaks. “Hold please—”
It presses a charred earbud. Somewhere, someone’s head explodes in hold music.

Clippyath hangs up. “You new? You smell like cosmic custody dispute.”

Eric: “That obvious?”

Clippyath nods, a stapler embedded in its skull jingling. “Got a proposition. We demons respect lineage. You’re Hell-adjacent royalty, kinda. Help me sabotage Upper Management and I’ll get you a portal coupon off this crap-rock.”

Shame hisses: Consort with fiends?
Rage licks metaphysical chops: Yes, sabotage!

Eric weighs ethics for roughly two nanoseconds, then says, “Outline the plan, stapler-head.”

The demon thrusts a greasy scroll at him. Step 1 involves kidnapping a Seraphic Auditor whose wings double as extradimensional keycards. Step 2 is redacted—literally, black tape covers it, occasionally twitching. Step 3 reads: ??? PROFIT/ESCAPE.

“Seems legit,” Eric mutters, already regretting nothing.

5 ▪ RANDOM EYEBALL WEATHER
As they stroll to commit Step 1, the sky splits, disgorging a downpour of blinking eyes. Some smash on impact like water balloons of vitreous humor; others skitter on optic nerves, squeaking.

Eyearthians pop umbrellas. One sells souvenir buckets: “EYEAJUICE—100% ORGANIC DESPAIR!”

Eric and Clippyath push through. An eyeball blinks up at Eric, iris swirling galaxy patterns. It projects an image: God and Satan mid-argument—

SATAN: “He got your chin!”
GOD: “And your soul-death stare! Veto!”
SATAN: “Rock-paper-scissors for who pays child support?”
GOD: “Jinx! Infinity hold!”

Eric kicks the eyeball down a drain.
“Parents,” he snarls, “are disappointing marketing campaigns.”

6 ▪ INFILTRATION, OR SOMETHING RESEMBLING IT
Target: Seraphic Auditor Rha-k’LITE—apartment #777 in a spire that hovers via positive self-affirmations.

Eric and Clippyath ride a rickety elevator whose Muzak loops “Ave Maria” played backward through kazoo. Halfway up, a power surge turns the elevator cables into worms; they writhe, snapping. Elevator plummets. Eric commandeers a worm, surfing its spasms to safety like a nihilistic Tarzan.

They burst onto the auditor’s balcony. Rha-k’LITE is mid-yoga, chanting tax codes. He spots them, glares.

“Unauthorized presence! Penalty: existential audit!”

He swings a briefcase that opens into a yawning ledger-maw. Pages snap like shark teeth. Eric dodges, ripping a wing off a decorative cherub statue to use as shield—irony not lost.

Rage’s voice: Eviscerate the holy bean-counter!
Shame: We could negotiate… maybe bake cookies…?

Eric chooses door Rage. He head-butts the auditor with diabolical horns (sprouted just for flair), then force-feeds him a contract full of loopholes. The auditor gags, shrinks, collapses into a neat origami of red tape. Clippyath pockets it.

“Nice work, Hybrido,” the demon chortles, stuffing the origami auditor into a fax machine that appears mysteriously for exactly that reason. It spits out portal coupons embossed with screaming cherubs.

Before Eric can savor victory, alarms bray. The spire tilts; self-esteem thrusters falter. Inhabitants tumble out, reciting affirmations while plummeting: “I DESERVE SUCCESS!” SPLAT. “I AM VALUABLE!” SPLAT.

Clippyath conjures a portal. “After you, Prince-ish.”

Eric hesitates. On the horizon, he glimpses The Sanctimonium—a vast cathedral where rumor says God and Satan occasionally hold mediations (mostly to argue parking validation). Answers might lurk there.

Rage urges, Storm the place, make them pay.
Shame squeaks, Closure! Hug it out?

Eric pockets the coupon. “Rain-check. Bigger fish to immolate.”

He vaults a railing, wings sputtering, aiming toward The Sanctimonium—a silhouette flickering between halo-gold and hell-fire, like a migraine given architecture.

I (43F) have been married for 16 years and together for 20+ to my husband (45M). My husband has started to grow jealous of a friend (50M) whom I have known for over 25 years and very dear to me,  but we have never been more than friends and will never be more than that. 


My friend was married , widowed and now in a stable relationship. He lives in a city quite distant from us, and I only communicate with him via text message or voice notes and the very sporadic phone call maybe once a year. My husband has never met him because husband was never interested, but knows of his existence, the extent of our friendship, how I met him, and the little updates about his life and family. When friend visits our town,
I meet him for coffee if our schedules align. The schedules have not aligned in 3 years. 


Friend and I used to exchange voice notes every week or maybe twice a week when there was something of significance to share.
On one occasion, I received a very romantic voice note. The note was clearly not for me and ment for his long term GF. He realized his mistake and sent another voice note apologizing for the mistake, and mentioned he never thought of me in such a way. Then, he questioned if it was true that he never thought of me that way, laughed about it and that was the end of it. I never responded to this two  voice notes because I saw no point in continuing the subject. Moved on, as if the voice notes never happened. 


I am an open book, I don’t delete messages , my husband knows my passcode, and I have no problem with him using my cellphone or looking through it. What I didn’t know was that He wakes up in the middle of the night and goes through my phone, through my messages , through all my social media account, through my email and who knows what else. He listened to the “mistake” voice notes at some point, and hell broke loose. He gave me the silent treatment for a week. I explained to him the mistake, but to no avail. The damage was done. 


Since then, he has asked me to stop talking to my friend, a request I have refused to comply with. There is no romantic interest between friend and I , and also it takes two to tango and I am not interested in breaking my marriage. I love my husband, and I would never jeopardize our relationship any way. But it feels unfair to stop this friendship I cherish so much. 

I did decrease the amount of communication and now I send only texts instead of voice notes, and asked my friend to do the same. I also asked friend to be mindful of what he says because I don’t want any misunderstands. 
My friend has complied. 


My husband insists I banish friend from my life. He has blocked my friend  numerous times on my phone , deleted my apps, and once deleted my accounts ( which was bad because I lost a bunch of info not related to my friend or the issue). Today my friend sent me a reel on IG and my husband saw it. Now we are back to my husband giving me the silent treatment. 


I feel like I am waking on eggshells. If I tell him the truth , bad. If I get a message, bad. I know he won’t stop checking my phone which is another issue in itself. 


AITAH for insisting on preserving this friendship or should I comply to my husband’s request 
and stop this friendship because my husband feels like it? Please help !

1k6gtpw,https://i.redd.it/qzl0yqfhxowe1.jpeg,"Thursday, April 24, 2025 | Word of The Day ""Mindfulness"" - Finding Appreciation Before Criticism • [Click to Expand]","## **Embracing a Heartful Perspective**


In our daily lives, it's easy to get caught up in what's not working, what's frustrating, or what could be better. Complaints often flow freely, sometimes without us even realizing it. But what if we paused before we criticized? What if we took a moment to find something to appreciate first?

This idea resonates deeply with me because I've experienced firsthand how shifting from criticism to gratitude can change not just my perspective, but my entire day. There's a subtle yet profound shift that occurs when you choose to notice the good before the bad.

Imagine this: You wake up in the morning feeling groggy and rushed. The coffee spills, you hit traffic on the way to work, and your computer crashes as soon as you sit down. It's so easy to grumble about these inconveniences, to let them set the tone for the rest of your day. But what if, instead, you took a deep breath and found something positive? Maybe the spilled coffee made you pause and appreciate the aroma, or the traffic delay allowed you to listen to a favorite podcast uninterrupted.

This practice isn't about ignoring problems or pretending everything is perfect. It's about cultivating a mindset where gratitude precedes criticism. When you approach life with a heart full of gratitude, complaints seem to lose their grip. There's less room for negativity because your focus shifts to what's good and meaningful.

I remember a time when I was teaching kindergarten, and there was a particularly challenging student who tested my patience daily. It was easy to get frustrated and dwell on the difficulties. But one day, I made a conscious effort to appreciate the small moments of progress this student made. It didn't magically solve all our challenges, but it did create a more positive atmosphere in the classroom. By acknowledging the small victories, I found myself more patient and empathetic, and that made a significant difference in how I approached each day.

Gratitude, I've learned, is not just a passive feeling but an active choice. It's a practice that requires effort and mindfulness. When we intentionally seek out things to appreciate, we train our minds to notice the good even in challenging circumstances. This doesn't mean denying hardships or injustices; rather, it's about maintaining a balanced perspective that acknowledges both the struggles and the blessings.

In the grand scheme of things, practicing gratitude isn't just beneficial for our mental and emotional well-being—it's also a pathway to deeper connections with others. When we express gratitude, whether through words or actions, we uplift those around us. It fosters a sense of empathy and strengthens relationships because people feel valued and appreciated.

So, next time you find yourself on the brink of complaining, pause for a moment. Take a breath. Look around and find something—anything—to appreciate. It could be as simple as the sunshine streaming through your window or the smile of a loved one. By cultivating a heart full of gratitude, you'll find that life becomes richer, more peaceful, and filled with moments worth savoring.

1k6gtip,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1k6gtip/ginza_hachigo_my_experience_and_what_may_help_you/,"Ginza Hachigo, my experience and what may help you.","So me and my wife frequent Japan, as with most people, it's our preferred holiday destination.

Last time we were there was for our honeymoon, and I only found out about Ginza Hachigo during that trip. I usually have tsukemen, so I don't go much for the soup ramens. I tried booking when I was there, but found that it was pretty difficult to do so. This time proved to be no different, as the bookings only open for the week ahead, and as many mentioned - they go pretty quickly. I think when the reservation page opened, I clicked on the time that was available, but as soon as that subsequent page loaded, it was already gone. Maybe it was bad luck, maybe it was the lack of high speed internet, or maybe it was just bad luck.

  
So this time, instead of trying to book, I decided to chance queueing up. I initially decided to head over around 9:30, as it was only about 5 minutes walk from my accommodation. However, I was already up, and had my morning coffee. I was bored, and my wife was still asleep. I figured, why not go for a walk and see what it's like. Maybe some people had already begun queueing. I was right, there were already 7 people in the queue. This was about 8:50 am when I got there. There's a coffee or pancake place just down the road from Ginza Hachigo that had at least 20+ people queuing up. Anyway, I got in line, and within 5 minutes 3 others got in line after me. At this point the very nice lady came out and placed a sign after the 10th person that basically says walk-ins are done for the day. Everyone else after us would be those who have reservations only.

  
She instructed us that they will open at 11, but they would start serving from around 10:30am. We were to go and purchase our tickets when instructed, then get back in line and wait. A lot more came after us, and were pretty disappointed to find that the queue was only 10 people long. A few even tried to haggle or bargain the owners into letting them join the queue.

  
My take from this is that they are simply that much more popular now, and with the increased number of people travelling to Japan, it might be easier for them to handle most of their customers through reservation. I'm not sure however if they have different allocations of seating between walk-ins and reservations that differ from day to day, but it was only us 10 on a Saturday.



Like most ramen places, as soon as you sit, your meal is served within minutes, and they're all very nice. The special, containing truffle ravioli, and pretty much the works - was very much worth it. I would queue for this again. Probably one of the more refined bowls of ramen I've had.

  
If you're looking to get in, try reserving, it would definitely save you from having to queue up. However, if you are going to get in line, get in early. Most of the people in the queue with us were locals.

Especially if you're running Facebook ads, the timing couldn’t be better with all the recent platform changes and tracking issues. Todd’s methods cut through the fog and help you see what’s really going on under the hood.

# Where Does This All Happen?

It’s a digital course, so you can watch from your couch, your office, or even that random coffee shop with killer Wi-Fi. Everything is online and easily digestible—even the more technical tutorials feel like a conversation with a friend who just *knows their stuff*.

# Why Should You Care?

Here’s the deal: Most marketers are stuck because they either don’t understand their numbers or they don’t have a mentor to help them make smart decisions. **Todd Brown – Mentor to a Million** bridges both gaps. You get a blend of expert guidance + tactical execution. That’s rare.

This isn’t one of those courses where you finish and think, *“Cool, now what?”* Nope. You’ll walk away with actionable steps and frameworks you can apply *immediately* to your business.

# How Does It Actually Help?

It helps by giving you the behind-the-scenes clarity that the best marketers use to scale. From tracking purchases to segmenting reports, Todd shows you how to speak the language of data in a way that informs every campaign you run.

Instead of guessing or “spray and praying,” you start making decisions that actually move the needle.

**Bottom line?** If you’re serious about building a business that doesn’t just survive but scales like crazy, **“Todd Brown – Mentor to a Million”** is that secret weapon you didn’t know you needed—but will never want to market without again.",1,1745459746.0,SdorLearning,1,1.0,False

I am new to this sub and wanted to ask some advice to support my mom (50F) who was recently diagnosed with late stage lung cancer in January. She has also had Spinal Stenosis and Multiple Sclerosis (M.S.) since she was in her early 20s, so she is in consistent pain all of the time. Her immune system and overall body has never been the strongest due to everything she has gone through and currently battling cancer has taken a toll on her. 

My mom has never really been huge on eating. She isn't picky, she just only ate when she felt like it, and she often never felt like eating much for as long as I could remember. I think she fluctuated between 110 - 135 but I'm not sure of specifics, I just know she's always been smaller. 

6 or so months prior to her diagnosis, her and my step-dad decided to be more mindful of their diet and health. They started baking their own bread, shop local butchers versus supermarket meat, growing their own veggies, etc. They enjoy it a lot and they've taught me a lot about it as well. 

However, with her cancer diagnosis, food and eating in general has gotten difficult. She gets nauseous all of the time from the chemo, but doesn't throw up that often. She says that food tastes completely different. We kind of prepared for that metallic taste a lot of people mention, but her taste buds have completely changed. One day she can eat a favorite meal, the next day it turns her stomach thinking about it, or the next time she eats it, it'll taste different. My mom is rapidly losing weight because she (1 - isn't getting enough calories, and 2 - avoids eating due to the potential nausea or taste change). 

Is this change in taste something that others have gone through as well? Were there any foods that didn't trigger this reaction, or did you have to take something to help soothe it? Any advice on some food and snack ideas to suggest to her to get her excited to eat a little, or foods that can help her build up some calories? She can't even drink coffee anymore because she says it tastes ""different"", and this woman has been drinking coffee for decades.

Thank you so much for reading this! Any advice or insight is greatly appreciated! If there is anything I can clarify or if there are questions, happy to answer the best I can! :)",2,1745459658.0,lungcancer,4,1.0,False

now let me go into what my panic attacks are like;
the worst one i’ve ever had, i was seeing in stop motion, i couldn’t form the right words or make a full sentence, my body would shake uncontrollably and my finger would stiff up and bend back, it almost feels like a seizure or what i would think a seizure would feel like. my head shot back and my eyes rolled to the back of my head and i blacked out at that point while still shaking but it had only been for a second. my heart rate was at 180 at the highest (it was monitored) . now this is where it gets scary and im embarrassed to say but i turned aggressive when my friend was trying to touch me to calm me down and i punched him, i also was having auditory hallucinations and vision hallucinations but that only happened once. this is the only time my panic attack or whatever it is has ever been that bad. now it’s usually just me seeing in stop morion more than i usually do, my heart rate will still spike, words will still be slurred, i have the urge to usually run away from wherever i am at the moment and i have experienced auditory hallucinations again.

We're both in our mid-twenties now. Since catching up, we were talking about what we've been up to, how we've been, life updates, etc. 
I told him I have a better job now, lost a lot of weight, my improved mental state, my legal name change in the works, and how I got sterilized and it was the best decision I've ever made. You know..

I was hurt, but accepted it at first because I didn't know what he meant by ""we want different things"" yet, until tonight...

The Humvee Mikhail and I were riding in, as well as the ambulance carrying Mikhail’s father, couldn’t move further into the city, because a Remus military BMD-4 tank and accompanying troops were just a few meters ahead. Our convoy of three vehicles immediately turned around upon spotting them. They fired at us, and we quickly turned onto a side street. We weren’t hit directly by the shell, but the explosion struck a building, causing a large amount of tiles and steel bars to fall from it. The ambulance ran over the shrapnel and blew a tire, making it unable to move.

The medics were busy transferring Mikhail’s father from the stretcher into our Humvee. Another Humvee stood guard nearby. Upon seeing Remus soldiers approaching, it immediately opened fire with its machine gun, preventing the soldiers from advancing. Once the stretcher, the ambulance driver, and two medics were all on board, we and the other Humvee tried to flee. However, the enemy’s BMD-4 advanced and fired, destroying the other Humvee. The explosion scattered debris in all directions. I pushed Mikhail’s head and mine down to avoid getting hit by the fragments.

Our Humvee turned again into an alley, but it was too narrow, and the vehicle quickly crashed into a streetlamp.

Although it could still move, the Humvee couldn’t pass through, and reversing would expose us to enemy fire. I pulled Mikhail out of the car. Along with the soldier driving and the ambulance crew carrying the stretcher, we hid in a nearby building. We entered the front door. It looked like a department store. We went into the lobby and ran into a coffee shop, where some civilians were also taking shelter.

We hid together in the café. I knew that the Remus troops would search floor by floor, and when that happened… I might have to kill again.

Mikhail’s father was still unconscious. Mikhail anxiously asked the medics if his father would be alright. Although the medics kept trying to comfort him, everyone knew clearly—he had to be taken to a hospital for surgery as soon as possible...

“I’m sorry, I’m a surgeon. I might be able to save him,” said a civilian who was also taking shelter.

“But I need equipment—from the pharmacy upstairs,” he added.

In this country, pharmacies even sold scalpels and anesthetics—though only licensed doctors could purchase them.

“I’ll go with you,” I said.

At that moment, I had to take initiative to save Mikhail’s father.

At the strong request of the other refugees, I asked the store clerk for a kitchen knife. Then, together with the surgeon and a soldier, we went upstairs to the pharmacy. We climbed the stairs to the second floor and ran into the pharmacy. It was empty.

The surgeon found a locked cabinet with the needed equipment. I searched the counter for the key, but then heard gunshots—the soldier fired his AK-74M at the cabinet, breaking the lock and opening it.

I knew very well—this would surely alert the enemy to our presence in the building.

“Sorry, but we’re out of time,” the soldier said.

The surgeon froze for a moment, then came to his senses and quickly took out the needed tools from the cabinet. I carried part of the equipment, and under the soldier’s cover, we hurried downstairs back to the café.

At the far end of the café, the doctor and medics began the surgery. I waited with Mikhail and the other civilians.

“It’s going to be alright. The doctor is performing the surgery now. And someone with the same blood type is even willing to donate blood to your dad. We’re really lucky—your dad will be okay,” I comforted Mikhail.

Mikhail nodded repeatedly, sobbing. No wonder—his father had been seriously injured in a sudden attack. It was impossible for an ordinary student to stay calm in such a situation.

A soldier guarded the café entrance. Suddenly, he opened fire, and someone returned fire—shooting and breaking open the soldier’s head.

A woman quickly covered her mouth, trying not to scream.

The situation was dire. I rushed to the door, careful not to expose myself to enemy fire, and took the soldier’s assault rifle.

It seemed the enemy’s footsteps were getting closer. I held the gun—it had a bayonet attached. I waited until the footsteps were nearest, just before the enemies stepped into the café, then slipped out and used the wall for cover to open fire, killing three Remus wolfkin soldiers.

I aimed the gun around to make sure no one else was there. Then I picked up the AKM from one of the soldiers I had killed and took a few magazines from his vest. I returned to the café to inspect the newly acquired weapon—because I was more familiar with how to operate an AKM.

Mikhail looked at me in surprise from behind. Of course—he was probably shocked that I was so familiar with how to use guns. I only hoped the sight of that soldier getting shot in the head wouldn’t become a trauma for him.

Everyone’s eyes were on me. I tried to ignore them and guarded the café entrance with my gun.

The city has a lot to offer and figured that someone out there would appreciate my favorite food spots - I hope you pay them a visit someday!

I was thinking about listing out restaurants too, but I was worried the list would get too long or it would break some sort of rules. If people find this interesting enough, I'll write out the restaurant ones.

*Context: I'm not really an extremely high spender / trend-oriented food person. Also not a super fancy specialty food / coffee expert as well, just a person who likes their silly little snacks and beverages. Totally understand if you've had different opinions + experiences at some of these places!*

**PART 1: CAFES**

* **Slowpokes**: seasonal drinks are fun and nice snacks, great place especially to work or study. Coffee is usually nice but inconsistent quality since they started expanding to new locations. If you're getting a snack, I'm fond of the soft pretzels they have with all three dips.
* **Anonymous Cafe:** one of my all time favorite places to eat. The selection of loaf cakes is AMAZING and the barista is really sweet and makes the cutest doodles on your lattes. The food is really amazing too, I highly recommend their chicken souvlaki plate. Wifi spotty so not great for working.
* **Pavon Coffee Den:** lovely and comfortable place to work with nice drinks. Their brisket bear claw is one of the best pastries I've had if you get the chance to grab it.
* **Croissant-Brioche:** the cake selection is delicious, especially their tiramisu. Coffee is tasty and on the sweeter side + croque monsieur is nice. Gets super busy on the weekends and wifi is non-existent, so more of a leisure / people watching location.
* **Sunday Press:** beautiful interior and delicious food and coffees. That includes so many pastry options and lots of savory ones. I thought it'd just be a pretty place with mediocre food, but I was pleasantly surprised even if a little pricey.
* **Grinder's Coffee Bar:** nice croissants and coffees; wifi is spotty and seating is a little limited, so just be aware before trying to stay there. CBD offerings if that's your thing. 
* **Day 6 Coffee:** the Texas latte is banger and so are the unique muffins. Good and comfy place to work downtown plus really kind staff + supplies in the bathroom if you need things.
* **Tiny's Milk and Cookies:** especially cute in the spring and summer. Amazing cookies and my favorite ice cream is amazing, such good flavors like Vanilla Caramel Crunch and I remember a dark chocolate peppermint flavor. Be aware these are like small counter-pick up spots so you usually sit outside.
* **La La Land Kind Cafe:** cute place to sit and work and the coffee is nice. I think it's a little pricey for what it is, but if you're loving a vibey place then this is good.
* **Siphon Coffee:** food and wifi is good, but be aware the kitchen closes at certain times and the place get filled up quickly on the weekdays by a lot of people working.
* **Refuge:** the coffee is nice and great place to co-work, but a bit pricey. Really beautiful spot if you wanna take someone on a date and chat.
* **Bluestone Lane Rice Village Café**: beautiful interior and great place to meet family and friends and dates. Bit pricey for what you get but the meals are nice and I love the Iced Milo drink.
* **Fellini Caffè:** good place to work and the coffee is fine. The time I went the pastry I got was stale, but hopefully that's not how it is all the time.
* **Citizens Of Montrose, A Breakfast Restaurant & Cafe:** food was nice and a fun place to hang with others. Parking is a nightmare though.
* **Blacksmith:** coffee is tasty, I feel like theirs is particularly strong and high on the caffeine side so just a heads up if you're sensitive like I am or someone who just REALLY needs that boost.
* **Coffee Fellows:** love the bagel sandwiches here, infinite charging spots and strong wifi. The peak place to work and super comfortable, just sometimes a fight for parking.
* **Dandelion Cafe:** a shame because I heard really good things about this place, but my food came out cold and my coffee tasted super bitter.
* **Common Bond Bistro & Bakery:** another Houston favorite, but I'm sad to say I find it just okay and don't really revisit the place. Not good not bad.
* **Kona Reserve:** I feel like this is a hidden gem. It's at the bottom of an office building but their coffees are lovely and milky and sweet, which is my preference. They also have spam musubis which I love having alongside a coffee.
* **Luce Coffee Roasters:** I found this place to be rather mid. Coffee tasted more like milk than anything.
* **French Riviera:** love the spot and the food is good, an even selection of both savory and sweet things to go alongside your choice of coffee. Pretty busy on the weekends but there's a cute plant shop next door that's fun to browse and shop around.
* **Ella Coffee:** inside of Mercto and Company. Absolutely beautiful place to get work done and they stock Love Croissants there. Good selection of fancy sandwiches from what I saw too. The star of the show though is the Tiramisu Latte - I cannot recommend this drink enough, I dream of it.
* **Le’DRIP Coffee and Tea:** love it and so do all my friends when I bring them here. My favorite is the egg coffee, which is so velvety and lucious. Pretty cramped and limited seating so I tend to grab + go with my drink.
* **Bean & Bottle:** super cute place and I enjoy the food and coffee. Kinda pricey but good place to work and they have wine options if you want to work in the day and drink in the evening.
* **Sweet Paris:** Chicken Florentine is my ride or die. Their coffee is fine but together with the crepe, it really is quite nice.
* **Badolina:** I think the coffee is okay but the pastries, especially the savory ones, are really unique and interesting. I remember some sort of sweet potato tart that I really enjoyed. Mainly it's the outdoor seating that was the strong selling point for me, really lovely.
* **Tom N Toms Coffee:** the coffees I find are quite sweet, even for me. The food options are really nice and interesting though and a good place to chill and work.
* **The Morii Coffee:** cute vibes, awful coffee. So bitter and watery even when ordering sweeter and milkier drinks. It's a shame because the interior is so nice. Previously named BLK Dog I believe.
* **Cucharita:** super duper cute place but expect a wait on the weekends. Coffee is not on the super sweet side and you can get some hefty meals there. I love when they bring around the bread basket for you to choose from - I had an amazing strawberries and cream croissant.
* **Minuti Coffee:** coffee is fine and dandy but for some reason, I just really really love the cookies there. On the thicker side and not too soft not too crumbly. The chocolate chips in them are just the perfect amount of chunky and melt so nicely if they heat it up for you.
* **Agora:** a pretty famous spot; I find the fight for parking and the hassle to not be worth it. Coffee is just okay and so are the food offerings.
* **Koffeteria:** the pastries there are so interesting. I recall having I think a guava and cream pastry that was lovely there and a nice coffee with butter.
* **Ema:** I was worried this was just an overhyped place, but the pastries really are amazing and interesting. In my opinion, worth the visit. The food is also quite nice and ambiance is lovely. However, parking is awful so try to visit on off-days and hours.
* **Central Market:** technically not a cafe, but the coffee there is genuinely so good and so are their matcha offerings. I had this cinnamon matcha in the winter that changed my brain chemistry; I will never forget her.

**PART 2: BAKERIES**

* **El Bolillo:** I don't know if I'm in the position to say if it's super authentic or not, but it's been a childhood favorite of mine. They have this croissant looking bread filled with cream cheese and a flower shaped tart filled with cream cheese that I absolutely love.
* **85C Bakery:** yes it's a chain but incase you haven't encountered one before, they're filled with a lot of different Asian-style breads and goods. I also love the Strawberry de Leche in the spring / summer.
* **Love Croissant:** the croissants are quite expensive but are one of my absolute favorites in the entire city. The goat cheese and turkey is my personal favorite. A hefty amount of turkey, delicious goat cheese, and a good blend of the flakey outside + pleasantly soft inside.

*Thanks for making it to the end + hope it's helpful! I have a little over a month left around here, so if there are any recommendations you have for final cafes + drinks to try, feel free to let me know!*",110,1745458695.0,houston,21,0.95,False

Dandenong? Canberra? Where ‘genuine local’ Julian Hill lives,"Labor member for Bruce Julian Hill seems to be juggling so many houses that he's now confused as to where he lives -

# Port Melbourne? Dandenong? Canberra? Where ‘genuine local’ Julian Hill lives

In flyers sent to voters in recent weeks, Hill describes himself as a “genuine local” who “grew up in the south-eastern suburbs”.

There has been a persistent rumour thought that this isn’t the full story. One of the first things I heard when I started covering Bruce for this blog were whispers that Hill lives in the city, and drives to the electorate each day.

The claim was repeated and twisted by voters I spoke with on the street, and Liberal campaign staffers pushing the message through Zahid Safi’s social media.

Disgraced campaign manager Andrew McNabb routinely posted online that Liberal candidate Zahid Safi “actually lives in Bruce … unlike other politicians that don’t live in the electorate”.

We asked Hill to tackle the issue head on. How is he a local? Where does he live? What’s with the rumour?

His campaign responded to confirm:

* Hill grew up in Burwood and went to high school in Glen Waverley (part of Bruce before the boundaries were redrawn).
* He bought a house in 1997 in Port Melbourne, where he “still stays sometimes depending on the diary and commitments noting it’s much closer to the airport and CBD”.
* He moved to Notting Hill in 2015 to campaign for the seat.
* He moved to Dandenong in 2018, where he rents a unit that is his primary residence today.
* Hill also has a flat in Canberra and has to “spend time interstate most weeks which is unavoidable as a minister and federal MP”.

“All of this has been publicly declared on Julian’s parliamentary register of interests,” his campaign said in a statement.

“They’ve run this rubbish every election – last time wandering up and down polling queues saying Julian lived in St Kilda – he has never lived in St Kilda!”

Mostly on Twitter. I’ve sent thousands over the years, but always hid this from my real life. Recently (as of the last year) I’ve been trying to be more open about it with girls I know in real life. Basically not hiding my foot fetish or the fact that I enjoy paying girls. I’ve had very positive success so far.

I started off by bringing it up to girls in friends with, commenting on their feet, offering to buy them coffee, ETC. eventually started messaging girls on instagram. My go to way of bringing it up was asking if they had a tattoo on their foot because I’m interested in getting more tattoos. And then eventually saying they have cute feet. Usually they then ask if I like feet and that starts the whole thing. Obviously if they are not Into It I don’t bother them further, but almost everyone I’ve mentioned it to has been cool about it and open to the idea. 

In several cases so far I’ve been lucky enough where they are into the findom side of things as well. This usually starts with me sending to them for feet pics and then saying that they could make me send more. I’ve been fortunate enough to do findom drains with 5-10 girls I know in person at this point and it’s been a blast. I’ve posted a few stories about them in some subreddits as well. I see them sometimes and they are still friendly with me and don’t judge me

For the first time, crypto users will have the chance to use their digital assets like regular money—no hassle, no delays, and most importantly, no high fees.

The card is said to be directly connected to your crypto wallet. This means you won’t have to convert your crypto to fiat first, or send it to a bank before making a purchase. Just a swipe or tap of the card, and you’re done, anywhere that accepts Mastercard, from the corner coffee shop to the big department stores.

The project is the result of a collaboration between a crypto platform and Mastercard itself, a move that aims to bridge the gap between decentralized finance and everyday use. If implemented, it will open the door for millions of crypto holders to use their assets in the real economy, not just as an investment but as real money.

In an era where technology is rapidly evolving, this kind of innovation is not just new, it’s revolutionary.

What impact might the merger of crypto and traditional financial systems have on the future of finance?

I’ve built a reliable income stream through online trading. It’s going well and doesn’t require much of my time anymore — maybe an hour or two a day at most.

That leaves me with a *lot* of free time… and I’m honestly not sure what to do with it.

I know this is a good problem to have — many people are working crazy hours trying to *get* to this point. But I’m relatively young (mid-20s), and it feels like I’m missing something. I don’t feel creatively fulfilled, and I’m starting to realize how isolating working online can be. I’ve never had a job in the physical world or built something tangible that involved community, collaboration, or creating a space people actually go to.

So now I’m exploring ideas that would let me build something more real-world and community-oriented. Initially, I thought about starting something like a coffee cart or a creative hybrid space. But I’m also open to other directions — like buying an existing business (for example, a nail salon, since I have family in that industry who could run the day-to-day). Something family-owned and locally rooted really appeals to me, especially if I can offer jobs to people I trust and build from there.

**Here’s what I’m trying to figure out:**

* Have any of you transitioned from an online/remote income to a physical business? What did you learn the hard way?
* If you were in my shoes — time-rich, income-stable, creative itch to scratch — what kind of business would you consider?
* Any advice on buying vs. building from scratch?

I really appreciate any stories, insights, or even cautionary tales. I want to build something meaningful — not just for myself, but something that gives back a bit and feels connected to people again.",0,1745457510.0,smallbusiness,6,0.5,False

There are over 200 plants in our modest 1200 square foot house.

Then I will find plants sitting on the bar, on the coffee table, on the dining room table. When I mention that she needs to move them, I get blasted for suggesting that they don't belong there.

She gets mad that I don't tell her how much I have in my bank account. She also pays close attention to what I buy (even if its just starbucks coffee!) And she organized my room without asking me while she was at my house. She rearranged everything in my closet and moved my furniture around without asking me. She says she did it to ""help"" me but I did not need her to do that and I did not ask her to do that either. I think her real motive was to be nosey. And more recently when we were talking about pets she gave me a scary look when I said ""I don't want any pets cause I can't afford any right now"". Her eyes turned slightly yellow when I said that and were extremely dramatic. She also waited 8 years to tell me that my great grandma left me an inheritance. She waited until 8 years after my great grandma died to tell me that. I eventually got it but I think my mom wanted it for herself.

My bio dad use to also accuse my mom of being a golddigger when I was a kid (she got remarried a decade after she divorced my bio dad). I am starting to think my bio dad is right though. I don't think he knew about everything she took from me though because she did not start to steal from me until years after their divorce.

And to be clear: no my mom is not on drugs.",6,1745456716.0,motherinlawsfromhell,14,0.81,False

“How the-” Uppil hiccuped wetly. “How the hell did you lose your boots?!”

Anfilid polished off her sixth margarita with a burp that was quickly followed by a hiccup, and she looked down into the cup with perked ears. “What are the guys doing?”

“Bowling.” Dimili answered, gleefully taking a fresh plate of churros from a waiter and pushing her three empty margaritas aside. “They’re drinking beer with the Humans.”

“Weren’t tha’ P’ah and Lilgu’ra supposhed’ to join ush’?” Enflia piped up as she drunkenly pushed a whole sopapilla into her mouth.

This sparked a memory in Rhidi, and she pulled her own data-slate free from her belt with numb fingers.

She tapped along the messages with a fair amount of struggle, then let out a snort of a laugh. “Ha! They found something called a ‘sports bar’ and got too drunk to meet us. Something called ‘jägerbombs’ made Shasta nose dive into the floor on his way to the latrine.” 

“Shasta juss’posted that he loves french fries an’ blue cheese…” Oin said, holding up her glass to a waiter to take some of his offered grilled pineapple margarita pitcher.

Rhidi hiccuped, something that was happening more and more now, as well as the strong urge to *laugh* as she raised her glass. “Well, if it’s just us, I guess it really is a Kafya ladies night!”

The Kafya around her all cheered while fighting through their own hiccups, and they all took a sip of their drinks in a toast.

With a blood alcohol content that could puzzle even the most logical of Human doctors, the Kafya stumbled out of El Sabueso Salado two hours later and made their way onto the bus when it arrived.

Inthur was half naked, still sweating through her clothing as if she were baking in the Summer sun, and ended up shirtless and bootless on the military transport. Oin, for some reason, had stolen a fork and spoon from the restaurant, Uppil had taken an entire stack of tortillas to go, and Saffi had ended up with several pockets full of tortilla chips.

As a matter of fact, *all* of the Kafya had pockets filled to the brim with tortilla chips, and were happily munching on them while hiccuping and struggling to keep their vision straight.

Pobilo, who was not *quite* as endowed as Inthur but still impressive by blue Kafya standards, was sitting upside down on a bus seat while licking all the salt from her finger fur.

Rhidi was the most normal, just hiccuping while scrolling through all the pictures she had taken with her data-slate; The waitstaff brought out multiple games for them to play, one of them being “charades” where they could only talk through gestures.

The kitchen crew, hearing all of their bickering in Kafya-hi, had come out to see just who they were working for in the first place. They then broke the Kafya into groups in order to teach them how to play dominoes, jenga, and a rather odd game called “faro”.

Rhidi had liked faro quite a bit, as gambling had been illegal in Kafya society for nearly three hundred years. She looked over to Inthur, who had been quite the faro sparring partner, then glanced down at her exposed bra. Inthur, as well obviously known, had enough cup sizes on Rhidi that she may have well been a kitchen *cabinet*, and watching her large, blue furred breasts wobble with the sway of the bus made Rhidi’s face burn with envy.

Yellows were lithe, and despite her being able to best the browns and reds in raw strength via training… Rhidi could not *grow* breasts.

The drunken thought made Rhidi so quickly angered that she pelted Inthur with her sweaty uniform shirt.

“Hey!” Inthur spat out, turning to look at Rhidi and balking at the look on her face.

“Put those things away!” Rhidi barked back, pointing angrily at Inthur’s chest. “Put those stupid… fucking… *milk tanks* back where they belong!”

A light ripple of tittering laughter echoed around the bus as Inthur quickly put her sweaty shirt back on, though the blue Kafya did smirk to herself; Rhidi may be first in many things, but Inthur knew one thing that she came in *last* place on.

The laughing and teasing continued on for quite a few miles as Rhidi settled back down, though Inthur had beat a hasty retreat further down the transport in order to rip her shirt back off and open a window vent for herself.

Arriving at the barracks was another messy affair as they piled out of the transport in a stumbling mess; The Human tequila was quite slow in leaving their system, and they were still madly drunk even though they should have been easing into the territory of “buzzed”. The requirement of walking in a straight line became a task as difficult as wearing their armor, and the looming stairwell appeared more like the final boss of a video game than a mere escalation of first, to second, floor.

“*Shas’ko hah?*” Dimili groaned out, too drunk to even bother remembering the English words.

Rhidi drew in a deep, chilly breath through her nose, even though she was seeing two stairwells instead of one. “*Tor’la ren. Ha keekin’lo dubta yu’wololo i len ha’len po ap shushlo arli kek.”*

“*Ye’ra rowa’lo ba’bahlo*.” Uppil muttered, spitting out a large wad of pre-vomit spit from her mouth. “*Er’li rowa’lo la hrecky*.”

“Onward ho, ladies!” Saffi called out gamely, even though she kept hiccuping. “If we can fall from the void, we can tackle these stairs!”

Saffi took two rapid steps forward, stopped, then darted off towards the decorative bushes to loudly vomit into them.

Rhidi rolled her eyes, looking over to Oin who just shook her head.

“Be sure to kick some dirt over that, Saffi.” Oin shouted out as the bus hissed and pulled away from the barracks. “If they find it, they’ll make us clean it up.”

“Okay!” Saffi gurgled out in a strained whine, though her shoulders bucked again and she vomited wetly onto the ground again in a splash.

Rhidi sniffed, then giggled to herself. “Strawberries…”

“She didn’t have to drink the *entire* pitcher…” Inthur said with a twist of her mouth, though the sound of Saffi littering the ground with her stomach contents caused her own to give a pang of worry.

After Saffi had caused ten more female Kafya to sympathy vomit into the bushes, in which an impromptu landscaping detail was roused to hide said evidence, they all took to the stairs.

Rhidi could usually take these stairs three at a time if she wished, and not even be panting at the top of the stairs. 

At the current time, she was wheezing after just a third of the way up, already having to support Oin on one shoulder and a whining Saffi on the other.

Rhidi’s head snapped around as best it could when Inthur gave out a soft gurgle, clutching her mouth with her hand as her eyes went wide.

“Don’t you *dare*!” Rhidi hissed as Enflia went stumbling past with a few of the other Kafya. “Don’t you *dare* puke on the fucking *stairs*!”

Inthur’s back began to curl as her eyes filled with tears, her other hand joining the first.

“Don’t you puke, Inthur!” Rhidi shouted now in a panic, knowing how much the blue Kafya had drank and eaten. “It’s going to go all the way down the stairs! Swallow it!”

Inthur shook her head rapidly as her cheeks filled with vomit.

“Swallow it you blue dipshit! Swa-fuuuuuuuuuck!” Rhidi howled as Inthur lost her literal internal battle.

Bright pink vomit sprayed out from between Inthurs fingers as she choked, but nothing could stop the deluge of fruity margarita from hitting the stairs and dripping down along the rail-wall.

When Inthur had finished emptying her stomach and splattering it along the tiled stairs, she looked up at Rhidi’s furious face; Saffi, having heard the wet splat, had given another weak bout of stomach expulsion. This stream of bile and partially digested chips was now running down Rhidi’s shoulder, and the yellow Kafya was so angry that her ivory eyes were nearly glowing.

“Sorry.” Inthur said thickly as bile dripped down her blue chin.

Rhidi turned without another word, trudging up the stairs while still supporting the other two. She arrived at the top step out of breath and wheezing, both of her fists clutching the back of both Oin and Saffi’s uniform bottoms so deeply, that she had given the two drunken Kafya the harshest wedgies of their lives.

Depositing them both into the showers with the other struggling Kafya, Rhidi made her way over to grab a mop and bucket from the laundry room. Inthur was crawling towards the showers by the time she left the laundry room with a suds filled bucket, and the blue Kafya rolled over onto her back with a wobble of her chest.

Inthur looked up at Rhid, holding up a hand. “H-help me, Rhidi.”

“Sure thing.” Rhidi replied icily, then splacked her wet mop right onto the face of Inthur.

Inthur let out a spluttering plea for mercy that was deftly ignored by Rhidi, giving the blue Kafya a quick scrubbing before stabbing the mop back into the bucket.

“That’s not f-funny!” Inthur howled out, gasping for breath as Rhidi wheeled the bucket back out into the hallway.

Rhidi ignored her, focussing on getting the bucket down the stairs without spilling it and cleaning up vomit trailing footprints along the way. With the main puddle of what Rhidi believed was cherry margaritas mopped up, and double checking the buried remains outside, Rhidi had been up and down the stairs multiple times by this point.

With a final heave, Rhidi hauled the mop bucket back up onto the top stair and slid down the wall by her shoulder, dragging in what air she could as her yellow hair stuck wildly to her face.

Rhidi heard the showers going, the groans of the lamenting, and oddly enough the crunch of someone eating more stolen tortilla chips. The wet burp of Oin as she pulled more chips from her pockets was just a little too much for Rhidi, and she was just able to pull her hair away from her mouth as she bent over the mop bucket.

The morning after the great “Margarita Massacre” was a dark day indeed, as Rhidi found herself blinking, bleary eyed along with all the other Kafya, Pwah, and Lilgara that had imbibed just as deeply as the females. Rhidi and her group had been the first back, and through the night the rest of the troopers had stumbled, filed, or were *dragged* back in by the helpful hands of the Humans.

Not a single Human appeared to be affected by their libation littered celebrations, though Humans consumed Earthen alcohol as early as the age of sixteen.

Alias, his face the color of fresh milk and both of his eyes blackened, regaled Rhidi in how *their* night had gone; The male Kafya were all dragged in, bodily, by the Humans, as they had favored the flavors of beer far too heavily and the bubbles had gone straight to their heads. Like the females, Kafyan biology grabbed onto Human alcohol and *savored* it, meaning that none of the Kafya sobered up at all until three in the morning.

Lilgaran biology saw their legs simply ceasing to work when drunk on Human alcohol, and the formidable jägerbomb had rendered the Lilgarans into intermittent states of their knees cutting out from under them. This resulted in heavily liquored Lilgarans slamming into the bar, ground, bar stools, or toppling into Human waitresses trying to serve food. Shasta himself had run into a table of Human veterans and face planted into their plate of wings; Nonplussed, one veteran mid poised to dunk a wing in sauce just chuckled and wiped ranch off of Shasta’s face with it.

The Pwah were no strangers to alcohol, as many kinds of brews were beloved by the elvish race, but these were soft wine-like drinks more known for their flavor than ABV. Having been lured into a false sense of security with the alcohol rations, the Pwah had began sampling other kinds of Human alcohols and found their achilles heel; Plymouth Gin.

“It was like drinking pure *happiness*.” Alias said, running his hand down his face as they all wobbled back and forth in formation. “I’ve never… we’ve never tasted anything like it before. Humans make it from evergreen tree berries, and it’s just… I can’t even describe it…”

Toibil, another male Pwah beside Alias, pushed his currently frayed gray hair over his ears. “It hit us so fast… we didn’t even know what was going on until it was too late. The ration alcohol always took a long time to hit us, but the gin hit us right in the side of the head within minutes. Alias had a few shots, got up to piss, and ate floor within seconds.”

“The entire bar saw.” Alias groaned, puffing out an angry sigh. “Someone got up to help me up, and then didn’t even make it five feet before doing the same.”

Toibil grimaced. “We tried to stop drinking it but… we *couldn’t*. It was so good…”

“We had to start taking away the bottles and the bar had to measure them out for refunds.” Morris said as he leaned in from behind Rhidi, causing her heart rate to spike. “We had just managed to get them to the barracks when the male Kafya rolled up. Looked like a multi-colored fur rug fell out of the bus.”

“Hi Morris.” Rhidi said sweetly and out of the blue, giving him a bright smile as she fought to keep her tail under control.

Morris raised a brow, but smiled. “Hi, Rhidi.”

“Hi.” She replied back, grinning happily as her tail rebelled and forced a single wag.

Morris let out a confused laugh. “Hi?”

“Hi.”

“Hi…”

Alias, so hungover that his feet hurt, reached up and grabbed Rhidi by the nose in order to turn it towards the oncoming NCOs. “Could you not?”

“I ssstill smell like buffalo sssauce…” Shasta murmured glumly, blinking slowly as his brain struggled to fully function.

The formation tried to come to full attention, Humans withstanding, but their outward appearance was hard to miss.

“Jaysus b’y, the hell happened to you lot?” Drill Sergeant Curahee called out, his lips cracked in a smile. “Looks like a shambling mass of the walking dead!”

Drill Sergeant McPhsiton chuckled. “Judging by the bill my credit card got hit with, the female Kafya were mugged by pitchers of margaritas.”

“The males found out what Guinness is.” Drill Sergeant Almoore said with a smirk. “I was there with my daughter bowling when they started drinking it like they were fish finding the ocean for the first time.

“I *told you* that was her!” A male Kafya hissed from the middle ranks, causing many of the Humans to titter.

“My old First Sergeant was at the bar with the Pwah and Lilgara, there was a special on drinks and it hit them a little harder than normal.” Drill Sergeant Prince said as she came around the corner, cup of coffee in hand and wearing an oddly off-colored uniform. “Shasta! How were the wings my little ranch head?”

Shasta looked away in shame, hissing out more in anger to himself than anyone else.

“Well, it was their day to celebrate, we can’t be too hard on them.” Drill Sergeant McPhiston intoned, and the odd note of seriousness to his voice made Rhidi a little worried.

“Unless…”

All of their heads turned as Senior Drill Sergeant Fairymoss came around the back end of the Company area, her massive form strapped in nothing but socks, running shoes…

… and her *PT uniform*.

“Formation run!” Senior Drill Sergeant Fairymoss shouted, slamming her two massive hands together in a thunderous clap. “Out on the street!”

“On the street you boozehounds!” Drill Sergeant Curahee crowed as he ripped off his garrison uniform to expose the PT uniform underneath it.

Drill Sergeant Prince tossed her now evidently *empty* cup to the side and had actually worn a *tear away* costume uniform, pulling away the pants to expose her high cut PT bottoms. “Time to sweat out your sins aliens! Let’s go!”

In a panicked blurr, Rhidi and the rest of the training Company were thrown out onto the road and forced into a jog, despite the fact they were in their garrison uniforms and boots. None of them, not even the Humans, had been ready for a *run* of all things, and many a trooper were putting up spiritual white flags of surrender after just a mere mile.

Rhidi had the unfortunate luck of finding herself at the rear of the formation, breathing in the sweat of everyone else in front of her; She could *smell* beer, martinis, margaritas, and gin that was sweating out of the pores of her fellow drop troopers, and the stench was nauseating.

Since they would be soon losing these history-making recruits, the Drill Sergeants made sure to send them off on a memorable note, forcing them to do a complete run around the *entire* Battalion area.

It was blessingly short, but that did not mean that Rhidi had not stepped in multiple trails of vomit and shoved away a few Pwah who were threatening to coat her in bile. 

After the Drill Sergeants had their fun and reminded the recruits about what “excessive” meant in the Uniform Code of Military Justice, they were released to change into a fresh uniform. Since it was a Saturday, they were given an extended, full day pass to go onto base and buy civilian clothes.

The thought had not really occurred to Rhidi, and as she was changing, she took an actual look into her locker; All she had was her small collection of Kafya body suits, and her uniforms.

Rhidi half turned to look at Shorsey’s locker, and she had a large collection of t-shirts, jeans, shorts, and other forms of civilian wear. They were colorful, personable… and frankly, the exact opposite of most Kafyan clothing except for the upper echelons of society.

“Shorsey.” Rhidi began, slowly closing her locker door and putting the lock into place.

Shorsey, halfway through putting on a pink pair of underwear, stopped mid foot-lift and looked at Rhidi with angry eyebrows. “What?!”

“... Can you take me shopping?” Rhidi asked her, turning around to fully face the fiery haired woman. “Like, show me what I should wear?”

Shorsey, her eyebrows once drawn together, immediately relaxed with a bright smile. “You want me to take you shopping?”

“I guess?” Rhidi said, though multiple female Kafya heads began to rapidly pop up around the rack.

“Shorsey will show us what to wear?” Saffi asked, her newly braided hair still as chaotic as normal. “At the Human store?”

Uppil slammed around the corner of Shorsey’s locker, her excitement visible. “I want to learn Victoria’s secret!”

“I too want to learn of Victoria’s secret!” Inthur said as she raised her hand, jogging down the main aisle of the racks. 

Shorsey rapidly put on her underwear and a pair of ripped jeans, then clapped her hands together rapidly while stamping her feet. “We’re going shopping!”",1,1745456668.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1jwo74t/aio_for_threatening_to_take_my_sister_to_court/)**: April 11, 2025**

Hi Reddit. I’m F25 and I’m honestly at my breaking point with this one. I need outside perspective because my entire family is acting like I’m Hitler for standing my ground.

So, I (25F) am a student software developer and a pretty serious PC gamer in my free time. I live alone in a one-bedroom apartment that I’ve spent years making cozy and functional. I saved up for a long time to build my dream PC setup … triple monitors, custom mechanical keyboard, ergonomic chair, the works. Altogether, my rig is worth a bit over $2,000, and I take care of it like it’s a damn child.

Last weekend, my older sister (30F) asked if she could crash at my place for one night because her apartment was being fumigated, and her husband was out of town. She has a 3-year-old son, Max, who’s… let’s say “spirited.” I love him, but he’s a little chaos goblin. I hesitated, but she swore she’d keep an eye on him and that it’d just be for one night.

They show up Saturday afternoon, and immediately it’s clear she wasn’t kidding about Max being a handful. Within ten minutes of arriving, he’d pulled four books off my shelf, thrown my houseplants on the floor, and spilled juice on my area rug. I tried to stay chill, he’s three, I get it … but I asked my sister politely to please keep him out of my office, where my PC setup is.

She rolls her eyes and goes, “He’s just exploring, he’s curious, it’s normal.” But she closes the office door anyway.

Cut to Sunday morning. I wake up to screaming. Max had apparently woken up before his mom, managed to open the office door, and decided my setup was his new jungle gym.

He pulled down one of my monitors, cracking the screen. He stuck crackers into the PC tower’s ventilation slots (I’m not kidding), yanked out my keyboard’s keycaps, and had colored on my chair with permanent marker. The cherry on top? He poured apple juice INTO the tower. INTO IT.

When I tell you I went silent… I mean dead silent. My sister comes in, sees the damage, and just says, “Oh nooo,” in this incredibly flat tone, like someone knocked over a cup of coffee. I start freaking out, and she has the AUDACITY to say, “You should’ve baby-proofed the room if it was that important to you.”

I lost it. I told her that 1) she KNEW he wasn’t supposed to be in there, 2) this is my space, not a damn daycare, and 3) baby-proofing a $2,000 gaming setup is not a standard requirement for adults living alone.

She told me to “calm down” and said that “he’s just a kid, and stuff is replaceable.” I told her she could replace it then. She said she didn’t have the money right now, but maybe in a few months she could give me a few hundred. I told her that wasn’t acceptable and that she needed to take full responsibility.

She left in a huff and now my whole family is blowing up my phone. My mom says I’m being “materialistic” and should understand that my nephew didn’t mean it. My dad said I should’ve “locked the door” if it was that important. My brother actually said, “Why do you even need three monitors anyway? That’s kind of overkill.”

I’ve filed a claim with my insurance but there’s no guarantee it’ll be covered since it was technically “guest damage.” I also told her that if she does not pay up, I'll take her to court for what happened.

Now I’m getting texts from my sister demanding an apology for “blaming her kid for being curious.” I told her I’d drop it if she covered the cost of repairs and replacements … or at least met me halfway … and she BLOCKED me.

So… Am I overreacting if I take my sister to court over this?

UPDATE: Wow. Just wow. Four hours later, I wake up from my nap to this. Thank you guys, it'll take a bit for me to read all of this.

My sister still has not unblocked me, but her husband reached out to find out what happened. I'm sorry I don't have more to tell yet, but I'll update again when I do. Seriously, thanks for the insights everyone. My head is a lot clearer now ❤️

**Update 2 (Same Post): Another 4 hours later**

UPDATE2: Hey all. My sister’s husband reached out as mentioned earlier, and we’re working out a solution if possible. He’s been really understanding as have all of you.

Also, to clarify the office situation: my one-bedroom apartment is on the smaller side (33m2/355sq ft?), so the landlord converted an old ex-clothes cabinet into a makeshift ’office.’ It’s weird, but the building is from the 40s, and ig they had to get creative with the space with an old tenant or something. So its living room (sister and her kid slept there) + kitchen (i slept there) + the ’office.’

Thanks for all the support. And the award. I really don't have the words for how nice people have been in both DMs and the comments. ❤️‍🩹

>**OOP:** I really appreciate your comment, I feel as if you nailed exactly how I’ve been feeling but couldn’t articulate in the moment.  
It’s comforting to know I’m not totally off-base here. I will need to see what I’m willing to do with this situation, I don’t want to lose my family, but I don’t want to start begging to be heard either.  
Thank you. ❤️

*Going no contact:* 

>Yeah, I’m not ready to go full no contact right now, but I really appreciate your perspective.  
It’s definitely something I’ll keep in mind if things keep escalating and no one starts showing even a little respect for my boundaries.  
I just want accountability, not drama. But if they keep pushing, I won’t hesitate to step back. I don't think I want to know my family if they can’t appreciate the work I put into my hobbies.  
Thanks for the insight. ❤️

Commenter (downvoted): Questions -

1. does your office door lock, if so why wasn't it locked?
2. how was this unattended 3 year old able to get his hands on crackers & apple juice in an apartment that he is presumably not familiar with? Why were these items so easy for him to get to?
3. if you knew in advance that he & your sister were coming, why wouldn't you make *any* effort to either secure delicate/important items or move them somewhere he can't reach?

>**OOP:** 1. The “office” is a converted clothes closet. The apartment’s from the 40s and has a weird layout. There’s no lock on the door, the door is just a heavy old one.  
Tbh I’ve been wondering if my sister might have opened it for him. I just don't get why???  
2. The crackers and juice weren’t mine, sister brought them. I had no idea he had access to them during the night until after the fact.  
3. I didn’t get much notice. I saw her message around 10AM Saturday, and they arrived around 2PM. My place was a mess, so I spent most of that time cleaning before they came by.  
In hindsight, yeah, I should’ve been more cautious with my setup, but it didn’t even cross my mind that anything like this would happen as I thought the office area was inaccessible to him. What he did pull off of the shelves was moved higher up and out of reach and in an area where he could be kept an eye on.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1k0jehq/update_aio_for_threatening_to_take_my_sister_to/)**: April 16, 2025 (5 days later)**

Hey again.

Just wanted to post a quick update since it’s been a little under a week and a few people asked what happened next. Things are better, pretty fucking weird, and still ongoing, but here’s where we're at.

Last Saturday, my brother-in-law (BIL) came over to check out the damage himself. He actually brought Max (toddler) with him, which I was almost livid about at first, but he had a reason. He asked Max to try opening the office/closet door. The kid couldn’t do it. The door was too heavy for him.

You probably can guess where this is going. :=)

BIL offered to take my PC to the store that originally built it for me, just to see what was fixable. I agreed, but asked for something in writing just so I had some peace of mind. We put together a little agreement that he’d be responsible for it while it was with him. Yeah, yeah, it was just a formality and would not hold much merit anywhere, but it helped me feel a bit more in control.

On Monday, he dropped it off at the shop and gave them my number so they could keep me updated. He also told me he confronted my sister about how things played out. I sent him my original Reddit post too, he read the comments and apparently showed them to her. She still hasn’t unblocked me, and from what I’ve heard, was not happy about the fact my BIL is actually listening to me.

I also shared the post and some comments with my parents and brother since no one really believed me before. My parents still don’t fully get it, but they’ve at least stopped pushing back. My brother is more understanding now, though for some reason he mostly wanted to talk about how many people saw the post. I don't think either of those three still care, really, and I'm fine if they see this. Do better.

Anyway, I went to see the PC today (wednesday here). The shop said it’s mostly salvageable. It needs a very very careful internal clean and a few fans replaced, and some wiring fixed, but overall the main parts survived somehow. BIL told me he’ll cover the cost of the repair, no hesitation.

When I brought up what my sister said about not being able to pay even $200, he said she’s lying. He also said he’s not sure Max actually did all the damage. He thinks the door was left open on purpose, or that my sister might have even done some of it herself. Based on the height of the tower and where the crackers ended up, it didn’t quite add up to a toddler acting alone.

Apparently, she’s been telling him I have a “gambling addiction” (I did get a bit hooked on Genshin like 4 years ago I guess?) and that maybe this whole thing will “wake me up,” which is… new. She used to be supportive or at least indifferent. No idea where that switch came from.

So yeah. That’s where we’re at:

* My PC is being cleaned up and fixed, and BIL is covering the cost.
* Sister still has me blocked and won’t talk to me. Still tempted to start something with her tbh, especially if she actually did all of this on purpose.
* Still not ruling out small claims court depending on how things go.

Thanks again to everyone who responded to the original post. Seeing how many people understood what happened really helped me hold the line with my family when I felt like I was losing my mind.

One thing I’ve been turning over in my head lately is what if my sister *did* do something to my setup on purpose?

I don’t want to believe that, it feels like a stretch, but the more I think about it, the less so, I guess...? But then I remember how she acted when I asked her to keep Max out of the office. The eye-roll and the ""he's just curious"" comments like she didn’t take any of it seriously...??? And now hearing from my BIL that she’s been saying I have a “crippling gambling/gaming/whatever addiction” and needed to “grow up”????

It’s just… weird. She used to be cool about it. Never super into games herself, but she got that it was important to me. If something changed, I don’t know when or why. And if this was some weird way to make a point or “teach me a lesson”… that’s messed up. You're not our mom. How about talking first instead of this? I don’t want to jump to conclusions, but the more I think about it, the less it makes sense that Max could’ve done all of that alone. It's sick if she blamed her own son for it.

So yeah. Not accusing anyone outright, but that thought is there now.

And if you're my sister reading this… Which I'm guessing you are, because I bet you'd love to look at the comments that are on your side a lot. :)))

I don’t know why you blocked me. I don’t know what shifted in your head about all this. But if you actually had anything to do with damaging my setup whether it was on purpose or just through complete carelessness... Fuck. You. You know I worked hard for that. You know what that rig meant to me, and you know I would never do something like this to your stuff.

And if Max really did all of it on his own… I hope you’re paying closer attention now. Not for my sake, but for his. Read the comments on my first post again, from other parents and people with younger siblings who CLEARLY know better than you. That's all.

Thanks for reading, those who did.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: Wait - I thought the whole family was blowing up your phone telling you how mean you were?

>**OOP:** Yes a week ago, before my first post. Is there something I can clarify for you here? My sister was talking incredible smack about me to them, making it seem like I ”screamed at her child” over a ”minor mistake.” I do see the people going ”haha blowing up her phone” and I do not understand what is wrong with the wording?

Commenter: I think chatgpt is being used a lot on Reddit lately, especially in AITA type subs and a common indicator that it’s a fake post is that AI always uses the “blowing up my phone” phrase so that’s probably why they’re questioning it

>**OOP:** Ohh… I see. 🤣 Thank you for clarifying! Beep, boop.

Commenter: I’m really glad things are turning for the better. But what about the other damages (Gaming chair, keyboard, etc)?

>**OOP:** My chair is okay, the cushion, legs and back are stained with red permanent marker but I’ve learned to live with it. Coworkers and I are trying to find a chemical to fix the situation on the cushions, but an ethanol solution (small amounts, i dont want to ruin the chair further) has slowly been working at cleaning the other parts. (being a janitor does have its perks)  
Keyboard… ehh. I could not find all of the keycaps that were pulled off. I replaced the missing ones with an old keyboard’s ones (both mechanical) so it’s a bit awkward but it works for now. I might get custom ones for it if I find some that fit.  
The cracked monitor on the other hand needs to be replaced. I guess calling it ”cracked” was a kindness in itself. Still got the other two left and at least it wasnt the most expensive one… but yeah. 3:

Commenter: Um, why aren't you just having your bil pay for a new keyboard and monitor? Or professional cleaning for the chair? That's all part of the repairs.

>**OOP:** We are waiting to see if my sister confesses to anything. If so, she will be paying out of her own pocket (and paying back), not my BIL. If she confesses and refuses, then, well… 👨‍⚖️📝🔒  
The computer is essential, but the keyboard works and I still have two monitors. Thats why I am willing to wait for the other damage to be solved.

*The 'addiction':* 

>I'll admit, during covid, I did spend $300 on Ganyu when she came out, but that was the ’worst’ of it. (And it was so worth it)  
I don't play much anymore, (mostly stuck on Marvel Rivals rn) but the overall margin from Genshin release to this day I've spent under $600.  
I get it, even that might look crazy to people who don't play video games, but sheesh. GAMBLING addiction…? Bruh.  
She should be more concerned of what I spend on Pokemon packs in this economy, if she's gotta be concerned over something. 🤣🤣🤣",1377,1745456642.0,BestofRedditorUpdates,239,0.96,False

I scooped the whole scene on a board without disturbing the detached fur or even the surrounding dirt.  I would like to turn it into an acrylic coffee table.  Is there any technique to pour it and  not disturb the fur or dirt.

I assume that it is pretty much impossible, but hope springs eternal and that fine creature deserves to be properly memorialized!
