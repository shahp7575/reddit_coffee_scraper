As mentioned by Dark Cacao Cookie in my head “we’ve lost two great kingdoms, and two great cookies” so that means that both the Marshmallow Kingdom and the Coffee Kingdom are gone. But, what happened to Peppermint Mellow and Pumpkin Latte?

What if they were sealed away in something similar to the Tower of Frozen Waves, and their beast counterparts were somehow able to escape the fate of being sealed away in Beast Yeast.

Well, buckle up because the **AI Content Vault** just leaked some viral blueprints, and you’re going to want to grab these before they’re gone! 💥

I’m talking about strategies that make your content not just good—*but viral*. Imagine the likes, the shares, the comments! It's like unleashing the Kraken of engagement. 🌊 But seriously, what does this all mean for us? Let’s break it down.

### Here’s what’s inside the vault: 

1. **The Attention-Grabbing Hook**  
   Think back to the last thing that made you stop scrolling. What was it? A bold question? A crazy fact? Learn to craft hooks that make your audience go, ""Wait, what? I need to read more!"".

2. **Listicles for Days**  
   Who doesn’t love a good list? They’re digestible, sharable, and easy to skim. Plus, you can pump out ideas like:  
   - **5 Ways AI Will Transform Your Content Game**  
   - **3 Mistakes Even Pros Make**  
   - **10 Questions to Ask Before Hitting Publish**

3. **Visuals That Pop**  
   Ever noticed how certain posts just *look* better? Utilize images, gifs, and even memes to accentuate your points. It’s the difference between a sad PowerPoint slide and a vibrant Insta post. 🌈

4. **Emotional Appeal**  
   Content that connects is content that converts. Tap into emotions by telling stories—*your* stories. Share your struggles, triumphs, and the LOL moments. People relate to *real*.

5. **Enticing CTAs (but not the boring kind!)**  
   Instead of the old, tired “Like and follow,” why not get creative? Make your audience feel like they’re part of something big. “What would you do with limitless content ideas? Tell me below!” 

Here’s the kicker—this isn’t just some random advice. Much of this came from analyzing content that actually went viral in the past year! It’s like having a cheat sheet to success. 

Oh, and before I get too lost in this, picture this: What if you could **combine** these elements into one killer post? What if you started that blog you’ve always talked about or launched your own AI content consultancy?

**Now you’ve got the tools. What’s your next move?** 🤔 

I can’t wait to see what you all create with these blueprints. Don’t just keep them to yourselves; spread the knowledge! Who knows? Your next piece of content could be the one that takes the internet by storm. 🌪️💻 Happy creating, and may your ideas flow like coffee on a Monday morning! ☕🔥",1,1752329371.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

The wellness industry is booming — and at the heart of it is **Pilates**. From celebrities to CEOs, more people are turning to this mindful movement practice to improve strength, posture, and flexibility. If you’re passionate about fitness and dreaming of launching your own Pilates studio, **2025 is the perfect year to do it — especially in Texas.**

Why Texas?

Because it’s *thriving*. The fitness economy is growing, real estate is more accessible than coastal markets, and Texans prioritize wellness like never before. But how do you go from an idea to a successful Pilates studio that attracts loyal clients?

Let’s break it all down — step-by-step — with trusted tools and services to help you start strong.

# Why Texas is a Thriving Hub for Pilates Entrepreneurs

Texas is *big* — not just in size but in opportunity. The Lone Star State offers:

* **Low state taxes** and business-friendly regulations
* A health-conscious population with disposable income
* Urban centers like **Austin, Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio** that love boutique fitness
* A growing number of residents working remote, prioritizing wellness

It’s no surprise more Pilates professionals are skipping saturated markets like L.A. and heading to Texas instead.

# Building the Right Mindset for Fitness Business Success

Before any reformers are delivered or clients walk through your doors, you need to work on something else — **your mindset**.

Ask yourself:

* Are you ready to be both a coach *and* a CEO?
* Can you handle slow seasons, unexpected expenses, and marketing challenges?
* Are you willing to invest in your business the way you’d want your clients to invest in themselves?

Success starts with believing you’re capable, learning fast, and staying resilient. Business isn’t a straight line — it’s a powerful personal transformation, too.

# Licensing, Certifications, and Legal Requirements in Texas

To run a legal and respected Pilates business in Texas, you’ll need:

* A valid **Pilates certification** (such as BASI, STOTT, Balanced Body, or Peak)
* A Texas **sales tax permit** (for retail or class packages)
* **Business insurance** (liability, workers’ comp if hiring)
* If hiring, you must comply with **Texas labor laws**

Make it easy on yourself by getting help with legal filings. I recommend [MyCorp](https://www.pasosdeals.com/mycorp) to handle your **LLC registration, EIN setup, and state paperwork** — all in one place.

# Creating a Business Plan Tailored for Your Pilates Studio

Think of your business plan as a GPS for the journey ahead. It should include:

* Executive summary
* Market research (your niche and target audience)
* Budget and funding needs
* Pricing model and projected revenue
* Class types and schedule
* Marketing strategy
* Milestones and goals

This plan isn’t just for banks or investors — it’s for **you**, so you stay clear and focused even when things get hectic.

# Finding the Perfect Location in Texas

The right studio location can make or break your Pilates business.

Look for:

* High foot traffic near coffee shops, juice bars, or yoga studios
* Parking access or proximity to public transit
* Natural lighting and open space for equipment
* A lease that doesn’t eat up more than **30% of your monthly revenue**

If you’re not ready for a brick-and-mortar yet, **start small**. You can even launch **online** — with a beautiful branded website.

I recommend using [Bluehost](https://www.pasosdeals.com/bluehost) for your domain and hosting. It’s reliable, beginner-friendly, and helps you build a stunning site that attracts clients 24/7.

# Funding Your Pilates Business: Loans, Grants, and Investors

To open a Pilates studio in Texas, you’ll need anywhere from **$20,000 to $75,000+**, depending on size and scope. Some ways to fund it:

* **Small business loans** (SBA or local lenders)
* **Fitness-specific grants** (check with wellness organizations)
* **Investor pitch** (if you’re scaling fast)
* **Personal savings** or crowdfunding

When applying, your business plan will be your strongest asset — so make sure it’s tight and realistic.

# Designing and Equipping Your Pilates Studio

This is the fun part — but don’t go overboard. You’ll need:

* Reformers and accessories (Cadillac, Wunda chair, mats, resistance bands)
* Mirrors, flooring, storage racks
* Reception desk and waiting area
* Ambient lighting, plants, essential oil diffusers

Hire a **Fiverr Pro** designer to help you create a **high-end brand identity** and logo that reflects your studio’s vibe. You can find talented creatives through my link: [Fiverr Pro Branding Services](https://www.pasosdeals.com/fiverrpro).

# Hiring and Training Certified Pilates Instructors

If you’re not teaching all classes yourself, you’ll need **certified instructors** with experience. In Texas, look for:

* Nationally certified trainers
* Experience with private clients and small groups
* CPR/First Aid certified
* A good cultural fit and customer service mindset

Offer regular training, and have clear policies for scheduling, substitutes, and payment. Consider offering **intro classes** where new instructors can be evaluated.

# Developing a Signature Pilates Class and Program

What makes your studio *special*?

In a crowded market, your **signature class** or method is what builds loyalty. Think about:

* A themed series (e.g., “Pilates for Posture” or “Core & Confidence”)
* Specialty programs (pre-natal, men’s fitness, seniors)
* Hybrid formats (e.g., Pilates + strength or cardio bursts)

Naming your classes creatively helps with **marketing and SEO** too!

# Marketing Strategies That Work in the Texas Fitness Market

Texas consumers love **authentic, community-centered marketing.** Here’s what works:

* **Email marketing**: Send class schedules, promo codes, and wellness tips using [Constant Contact](https://www.pasosdeals.com/cc)
* **Instagram + TikTok**: Show transformations, tips, and instructor moments
* **Google Business Profile**: Collect reviews and show up on maps
* **Referral programs**: Offer class credits for friend referrals
* **Local partnerships**: Partner with nutritionists, chiropractors, and healthy cafes

With [Constant Contact](https://www.pasosdeals.com/cc), you can build an email list and automate your outreach — keeping clients engaged and informed without you lifting a finger.

# Using Technology to Streamline and Scale Your Studio

Running a studio means wearing many hats — but that doesn’t mean you have to do it all manually.

Use tech to automate:

* **Class scheduling and check-in**
* **Online bookings and payments**
* **Payroll and invoices**
* **Client waivers and communication**

[Square](https://www.pasosdeals.com/square) is perfect for **invoicing, POS, and managing payroll** for instructors. Their platform is user-friendly and built for small fitness businesses.

Plus, it helps you track performance, so you can make smarter decisions and grow faster.

# Creating a Client-Centered Experience That Drives Retention

Client experience isn’t just about results — it’s about **how people feel when they interact with your brand.**

Simple ways to create an unforgettable experience:

* Learn names and celebrate milestones (class 50? Birthday? Send a note!)
* Offer cold eucalyptus towels or herbal tea post-class
* Provide free mat cleaning spray and cubbies for personal items
* Build community through events, pop-ups, or workshops

When clients feel seen and valued, they stay longer — and tell their friends.

# Navigating Competition and Building a Local Brand

Yes, there’s competition. But here’s the truth: **There’s room for everyone when you focus on value.**

Your job is to make it impossible to ignore your studio by:

* Becoming *the* studio for a niche audience (e.g., busy moms, remote workers, seniors)
* Owning your story (why YOU started this studio and what you stand for)
* Delivering consistency — in quality, vibe, and messaging

Need help building a consistent visual brand? Hire a **Fiverr Pro** expert through this link: [https://www.pasosdeals.com/fiverrpro](https://www.pasosdeals.com/fiverrpro)

# Scaling Your Pilates Studio into a Profitable Chain or Franchise

Once your studio is thriving, it’s time to think bigger:

* Open a second location in a nearby city
* License your **signature program** to other studios
* Offer **on-demand classes** through your website
* Develop branded **merch, mats, or equipment**
* Create a franchise model (with support materials, brand guidelines, and training)

That’s how fitness empires are built — one reformer at a time.

And remember, as you grow, you’ll need systems that scale. From registering multiple LLCs with [MyCorp](https://www.pasosdeals.com/mycorp) to upgrading your website hosting with [Bluehost](https://www.pasosdeals.com/bluehost), these tools will be your best partners.

# Final Thoughts: You’re Not Just Opening a Studio — You’re Starting a Movement

There’s never been a better time to combine your passion for Pilates with the boldness of entrepreneurship.

Texas is ready for more fitness leaders who want to serve their community, create jobs, and transform lives.

# And you don’t have to do it alone.

* Register your business the right way with [MyCorp](https://www.pasosdeals.com/mycorp)
* Build your dream site on [Bluehost](https://www.pasosdeals.com/bluehost)
* Keep clients coming back with [Constant Contact](https://www.pasosdeals.com/cc)
* Simplify payments and payroll with [Square](https://www.pasosdeals.com/square)
* Polish your brand with [Fiverr Pro](https://www.pasosdeals.com/fiverrpro)

You have the vision. These tools can help you turn it into something incredible.

**Now take a deep breath, believe in your potential — and take the first step. Your Pilates studio in Texas awaits.**

1ly17tw,https://v.redd.it/09j3929q9gcf1,How Can You Cultivate a Culture of Continuous Improvement in Your Organization?,"Small Shifts, Big Gains: Building a Workplace That Never Stops Getting Better

In a nutshell: Organizations that thrive long-term have one thing in common: they don’t rest on yesterday’s wins. Cultivating a culture of continuous improvement means creating habits, systems, and mindsets that make learning and progress part of daily work. This guide breaks down how to foster this culture, why it matters, and what practical steps you can take to embed improvement into your company’s DNA. (Keyword: continuous improvement culture)

Why Continuous Improvement Matters

In today’s fast-moving world, standing still is the same as falling behind. Companies that embrace continuous improvement stay nimble, competitive, and resilient.

A culture of continuous improvement is more than adopting Lean or Kaizen principles; it’s about making progress part of everyone’s job. Like compound interest, small, steady changes yield big results over time. Think of it as tending a garden: daily watering, pruning, and care lead to healthy growth.

Key benefits:

Keeps teams engaged and motivated
Sparks innovation and creativity
Improves efficiency and reduces waste
Enhances customer satisfaction
Core Principles of a Continuous Improvement Culture

Before jumping to tactics, it helps to anchor your efforts in core principles:

Empowerment: Everyone should feel they can suggest improvements without fear.
Transparency: Problems aren’t hidden—they’re opportunities to learn.
Consistency: Improvement is not a project; it’s a habit.
Collaboration: Cross-functional teamwork drives broader, better solutions.
These pillars form the foundation for lasting change.

Practical Steps to Build the Culture

1. Lead by Example

Leaders must model curiosity and openness. When managers ask, “How can we do this better?” they signal that questioning the status quo is encouraged. As Peter Drucker said, “Culture eats strategy for breakfast.”

2. Create Safe Spaces for Ideas

Psychological safety is crucial. If people fear blame, they won’t speak up. Develop rituals like regular team retrospectives or “improvement huddles” where everyone shares what’s working and what’s not.

3. Celebrate Small Wins

Don’t wait for massive breakthroughs. Recognize small, incremental improvements. This reinforces that every step forward matters.

4. Provide Tools and Training

Give your people the skills to spot waste, solve problems, and test solutions. Training in Lean, Six Sigma, or simple root-cause analysis can make a big difference.

5. Build Feedback Loops

Use short cycles of feedback. For example, Toyota’s famous “Andon Cord” lets workers stop the line if they spot a problem. It’s a vivid symbol of trust and real-time improvement.

Real-World Examples: The Toyota Way and Joe’s Cafe

Toyota’s culture of Kaizen (continuous improvement) is legendary. Any worker, no matter how junior, is expected to spot inefficiencies and suggest fixes. Managers support these ideas and help test them quickly.

At the same time, consider Joe’s Cafe, a small coffee shop that introduced a “suggestion jar” for staff and customers. A barista’s idea to pre-grind coffee during off-peak hours reduced wait times by 20%—a tiny change with a big impact on customer satisfaction and daily sales.

Overcoming Common Challenges

Creating a continuous improvement culture isn’t always smooth sailing. Here’s how to tackle common hurdles:

Resistance to change: Start small. Pilot improvement practices with one team. Share their success stories.
Silos: Encourage cross-team projects to break down barriers.
Short-term focus: Remind leaders that the payoff compounds over time. Share metrics that show long-term gains.
How to Measure Progress

You can’t improve what you don’t measure. Pick metrics that show both effort and impact:

Number of improvement suggestions submitted
Percentage of ideas implemented
Time saved or cost reduced
Employee satisfaction scores
Check in regularly, share results widely, and adjust as needed.

Quick First Steps Checklist

✅ Pick one pilot team or project
✅ Schedule a short improvement huddle
✅ Identify one small pain point
✅ Test one change
✅ Celebrate the result and repeat

Keep It Human: The Power of Storytelling

Stories inspire action. Share real examples of how someone’s idea made a difference. When people see peers being recognized, they’re more likely to get involved.

A simple analogy: Continuous improvement is like pushing a flywheel. At first, it takes effort to get it moving. But as momentum builds, progress gets easier and faster.

Bring It All Together

A culture of continuous improvement doesn’t happen by accident. It grows from daily habits, open dialogue, and leaders who encourage curiosity.

When your organization treats problems as treasures, empowers everyone to solve them, and celebrates learning, you unlock a force that keeps your business competitive—no matter what tomorrow brings.

🧬 QuestionStrings to Practice

In a world where the right question often matters more than the answer, here’s a powerful type of QuestionString to sharpen your inquiry:

🔍 Improvement Loop String
For refining processes continuously:

“What’s working well?” →

“What could we do better?” →

“What’s one thing we’ll try this week to improve it?”

Try weaving this into your team meetings or personal reflections—watch small changes compound into big progress.

When you make continuous improvement part of your culture, you unlock the hidden potential of every person in your organization—and that’s the ultimate competitive edge.",1,1752328981.0,QuestionClass,0,1.0,False

U know that feeling of waking up daily and not feeling pretty or confident? Like you have to face ur subordinates at work and look them in the eye and think, I wonder if these people actually respects me just because I’m their boss and behind me they laugh at meand having relatives who kept fat shaming me telling me you are too fat but ure not even getting pregnant. That feeling where I kept coming up with excuses to not work in the office and just WFH because I can’t face my people, our clients as well thinking how fat I look in every dress I wear. Every night after my exhausting work, I face the mirror and tell myself how ugly I am. Not because my definition of beauty is slim but u know that feeling of not feeling beautiful because ur fat? I have that feeling everyday.

Until one day, I looked at the mirror and told myself, I need a miracle! My lifestyle is very dirty, j smoke, I drink, I work 12-14hrs daily 6days a week, no time or too lazy for gym, not even to walk 5mins! I tried every single pill there is, teas, coffee and even those RF/Lipo non evasive treatments— nothing worked! So I needed a miracle — something that is applicable to my lazy arse and dirty lifestyle.

I met SF thru search for anything slimming, pinged them out of desperation and I was at the point where I’d do anything to loose weight but not exceed much effort. I told myself, if this does not work, I will go for invasive surgery — Lipo.

Gladly they responded! And in 30mins my order is being packed. I didn’t even ask of the basic questions, I was desperate. Didn’t ask for any purity whatever. I already knew SF as basis on the people’s feedback and I didn’t need to exercise (compared to the other one I inquired from before that I apparently had to walk 10,000steps a day, like hell no, I’m fat I’m lazy, I work longhours and I can’t be bothered to be walking daily)

I started with the initial dosage, boom! I still eat but gets full easily. From a box of pizza to just a quarta slice.

I forget if she’s either ex-Amish or Mennonite. I don’t remember. And all my life, she would always walk around my neighborhood in her high heels and her dress with her bright red hair and also hold a coffee mug while walking. Also, cherry red lipstick too. But she would sort of walk funny. The legs and feet were crooked and apart (it’s hard to explain it in text). My family would always call her showtime lol. But then, like a couple of years ago, she sort of stopped walking around the neighborhood, but the weirdest thing happened was her screaming! I’m not joking about her screaming; I’m always outside (as every kid should be) and across the street. I hear this very loud, yapping, gibberish screaming noise coming from her house. 
Also, every house in the neighborhood has some characteristics/personality like different decorations , flowers, all of that stuff, but not her. She has no decorations at all. It’s just very perfectly, uncanny, bland. Her blinds were always shut, so I could never see what the inside looked like. The only time she ever decorates is Halloween -since that’s her favorite holiday. 
So anyway, no one believed me when I said I think “Showtime” is screaming. After many months of convincing everyone around , they noticed her screaming too. One day I went up to her neighbor (who, funny enough, is an actual Mennonite), and she too always noticed her screaming. She told me that she went up to “Showtime” one day to tell her to be quiet. But the craziest thing was “Showtime” said to the neighbor that it wasn’t her who made the screaming- it was the tv! And we both agreed that was a load of baloney. 

As I said, she doesn’t walk anymore, but once in a random blue moon, she’ll go up to certain people’s houses with cookies. And according to them, she’s very nice. 

But besides that, all she does outside is to cut her grass - all the time…in her dress and heels! 
And idk if she’s autistic or what, but she’s super crazy about sweeping the sidewalk perfectly clean with her broom, like sometimes every day. 

Oh, the weirder part is her driving. She drives an old red Ford sedan, but she’s very peppy/jerky with her driving. It’s like she has both feet on the gas/brake. Also, she leans to the side—sorta under the dash— when she drives. Idk if she also has a back problem, but that’s gotta be dangerous if she runs into something. I would not wanna be her driver at all.  

Now her screaming sometimes happens every day or not at all for a while until recently she did it again….outside…in public….
So that confirms that she is the screamer after all. But she was doing something with her lawnmower in the driveway—like something was broken— and she starts whacking it with her infamous sidewalk broom! I’m not joking and dead serious—not exaggerating! It looked like something straight from a cartoon. Well, I guess she literally is “show time” after all !! 

Now I’ll admit, it was pretty funny at first, but now I’m slightly concerned. I wonder if she has anger issues or she’s getting attacked by something more serious. 

Edit: This is a real story—unlike these other stories on this subreddit. 
Also, as I’m writing this, the more unsettling this situation is - or am I making a bigger deal out of this?",3,1752328941.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1ly176j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ly176j/should_i_ask_her_to_get_coffee/,Should I ask her to get coffee?,"My last relationship ended 3 years ago, my ex had been locked in a cycle of abusive behavior toward me, so it took about that long to get my head mostly back together. I went on a few dates here and there, but I wasn't really ready, and they weren't really interested in me.

Last Halloween I popped in to this sandwich shop a block away from my workplace, which is where I met her. Since they had a standard uniform, her only ""costume"" for the holiday was a pair of pointy ears. I asked her if she was supposed to be an elf or a Vulcan, and she laughed. I said maybe she was a gremlin, and she smiled and said ""Oh, so you already know, huh?"" When she smiled, it made me feel things. We chatted a little more as she made my sandwich, and I ended up being all smiles the rest of the day.

After that, I'd stop in once a week for a sandwich on my break. Really, though, it was for the chance to spend a couple minutes talking to her. I never worked up the courage to even ask her name, but I always got the feeling she liked when I came in. Sometimes, even if she wasn't the one making my sandwich, she'd stop to say hi before moving to the next customer.

Earlier this year, I took a new job. It's only about a mile away from the shop she works at, but the hours run later and the break structure is different. So I haven't been to her store in months. This week, I went to the gym for the first time. I want to lose a little weight, and I'm hoping by getting into the habit of exercising more, I'll be able to cut back and eventually quit smoking. After, I don't know why, but I decided to stop for a sandwich.

When she saw me was all smiles and asking me how I was. I couldn't help it, I said ""Hey gremlin, how are you?"" And the smile she gave me gave me the butterflies. We chatted again while she made my sandwich. She told me how she almost took a new job but decided to stay there for the time being, I told her about my new job. And i finally asked for her name, and gave her mine. During the conversation, we both ended up repeating one anothers' names, and there were a few more smiles. It was getting a little busy, but she didn't seem in a rush to get to the next customer. I did tell her where I was working, if she ever needed some of our crappy products, though I'm not sure if we sell anything she would actually need. But I was all smiles the rest of the day. Again.

It's embarrassing. I'm an adult, but my mind keeps drifting back to the things she said, the way she smiled. I think I have a crush, and I think I want to get to know her. At the same time, it feels inappropriate to ask a woman out while she's at work and probably has to deal with shitty men a lot to begin with. I also can't really tell if she likes me, or it's just the customer service mask.

So I'm not sure if I should bite the bullet and ask her if she wants to get coffee or tea or something, or if I should just bury this and leave her alone.",1,1752328930.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

But they almost always send the food back down to Earth to study in a laboratory to see how growth in space has impacted it. Usually this is a hydroponics setup, UV lamps and roots growing directly in water or in a sponge soaked in nutrient-rich water because a pot of soil is inconvenient in zero gravity. Sometimes they will eat a single tomato as a taste-test or as part of a publicity photo but this is NOT the main source of their food supply and it's only a fraction of a percent of their dietary needs. Most of their food is essentially army rations, sealed packets of specially prepared long shelf-life meals plus a few days of fresh fruit/vegetables as a treat after each new supply ship arrives.

The trip to Mars takes 6\~9 months, with another 6\~9 months to come home again. But you need to wait for the planets to be in the correct positions to make the journey easier so you might need to wait 12\~18 months before coming home. There's a few permutations, alternate routes and ways to reduce the time but it's 24\~36 months away from Earth. Several proposals include spending much of that time on the Martian surface instead of on the ship, either way that's a LOT of time eating army rations without resupply.

In the movie The Martian, Matt Damon grows potatoes in poop as an emergency procedure because his rations are going to run out. Could something similar be done as Plan A. A hydroponics greenhouse with UV lamps to grow a significant fraction of the food needed to feed the crew for 2\~3 years away from Earth. And this could also be an opportunity to recycle some of the waste produced by the crew, the plants can absorb CO2 and the poop produced by the crew can be used as fertiliser to help grow the crops. Now this likely won't be sufficient alone and the crew will need to supplement it with pre-packaged food but it can help reduce the amount of food packets they need to bring and the amount of poop they'll be producing. The water is already recycled (Today's coffee is yesterday's coffee) and their CO2 needs to be split back into O2, so why not recycle their poop too?

However, there are a LOT of flaws in this plan. Human poop contains harmful bacteria and pathogens, is it safe to grow crops in it? Is there a step that could be added to the process to make this safer? Sterilise the poop with radiation, or expose it to vacuum to kill any bacteria? Or maybe dissolve the poop in an acid/solvent slurry and boil it to kill the bacteria then extract out the useful nutrients chemically, the nitrates, phosphates and potassium compounds that plants crave. There are some bacteria that plants need in their soil (or soil substitute) so perhaps the solution is to sterilise the poop mix then re-introduce a dose of pre-approved soil bacteria that are growing in a dedicated soil-enrichment-incubator?

You can look at it as a mostly closed loop, the same carbon atoms going around and around the food cycle. It won't be fully nutritionally complete, they'll still need to take vitamin supplements and eat dried fruits and proteins from the packaged meals but it'll be a step in the right direction. But what impact would this have on a person's gut microbiome? Could probiotic drinks help nudge the microbiome in the right direction too? What if this works fine for the first couple of months but some trace element like selenium is lost with each cycle and eventually the crops grow sickly and die?

Has anyone done any research projects towards this? I remember one about the psychological effects of being locked in a small marsbase with the same people for over a year, it was a fake marsbase in the Nevada desert. But they weren't testing the air/water/food recycling systems, it was more human oriented than the chemical level.

Kettle's on :),"At the risk of sounding mean, which i'm really not. I'd just like to chat with people who are seeking a little escapism today, or most days for that matter. So if talking about the political landscape of your country etc is important to you then maybe don't reach out. I really respect activism, honestly. But it's just not my speed. Hope you understand. 

Let's just talk about food (cooking & baking tips) travel (bucket-lists, i have my first Tokyo trip pencilled in for February) film (exchanging tv & movie recommendations) anime (very selective with this, my 3x3 has been called pretentious) gaming (this has been relegated to a rainy day activity recently, i'm just a little burnet out from 1 million hour rpg saves) 

A little about me: 37, 5'6, in shape, 9.5 stone (60kg or 133lbs) brown hair, blue eyes, Taurus, INFJ-A (but chatty 1v1) sense of humour & effort in messaging is important to me. Love my tea & coffee, rarely drink alcohol, don't smoke, rarely eat red meat (but don't judge anyones decision to eat or drink whatever they feel like) Actually, if you made me tacos or a lasagna, i'll be tempted :) 

Ridiculous stream of consciousness over. Side note: i'm open to any timezone. In fact, i have no international friends, so i find the idea of that exciting. I wonder if you find rainy days as relaxing as i do? Ok, enough of this! see ya.

1ly15yi,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassF/comments/1ly15yi/part_13/,Part 13,"**Danny**

The first shot missed.

Too soft. Too slow.

The blood strand slapped against the pillow pinned to my closet door and slid down like paint.

I clenched my fist. Focused harder. The cut on my arm pulsed open again, thin and controlled — the way I’d learned.

A second strand floated out, twisting midair, sharp as wire.

This one hit dead center.

“Better,” I muttered.

I wasn’t training for glory. Or for grades.

I just needed to prove to myself that I was stronger than yesterday. That every failure from before was just groundwork for control.

Even if I had to bleed for it.

A knock pulled me out of focus.

“Danny?” my mom called through the door. Her voice was soft but tense. “Honey, come out here… please.”

I wiped the sweat off my forehead, careful not to smudge any blood, and opened the door just a crack.

She was standing in the hallway, holding her tablet like it had just punched her in the chest. Her eyes were already glassy.

“You need to see this,” she said, and her voice broke a little.

I stepped out, heart already sinking.

She tapped the screen, turned the volume up.

A news anchor filled the feed — smooth voice, practiced sadness.

“—tragic loss for the Senate and the nation. Vicente Calderon, longtime political leader and vocal advocate for powered youth reform, was found dead late last night in his private office. While no official cause has been released, sources suggest health complications linked to stress and overwork may have contributed. Authorities are advising against speculation as the investigation continues.”

I didn’t move.

Didn’t speak.

I just… stared.

“Health complications?” I muttered.

She didn’t answer.

The screen split to show photos of Vicente shaking hands, giving speeches…

Then it cut.

To her.

Lívia.

She was standing near an officer. Not crying. Not moving. Just holding her sketchbook to her chest like it was the only thing keeping her from disappearing.

She looked so small.

So empty.

I felt it before I even realized what was happening.

Warmth on my cheeks.

I touched my face.

Blood.

Not a wound.

Not training.

Just…

Feeling.

My mom stepped forward. “Danny…”

But I turned before she could see my eyes.

Because I wasn’t okay.

Because nothing about this felt okay.

She placed a gentle hand on my back, didn’t say anything else.

And I was grateful for that.

Because I couldn’t have answered.

Couldn’t explain why it hurt so much to see someone else’s grief.

Couldn’t explain why it felt like something inside me had cracked wide open.

All I knew was that Lívia had lost her father.

And all I could think about…

was how I couldn’t do anything to stop it.

——

**Sofia**

The spiders were restless.

They crawled up the corners of the living room, silent, twitchy, like they could feel something wrong before I even saw the news.

Mom was sitting on the couch with a tea she hadn’t touched. Dad kept switching channels like that would change the headline.

It didn’t.

“Vicente Calderon, leader of the current Senate and a long-standing ally of the Association, was pronounced dead late last night. Authorities report no signs of foul play.”

I stood behind the couch, watching the screen.

Lívia’s name wasn’t mentioned.

Not even once.

But I saw her. Just for a second. In the background. Standing next to a car, arms around her sketchbook. The same way I held my spiders when I was scared.

“They’re already blaming it on the other party,” my father said. “Of course.”

“Figures,” my mother muttered. “One less mouth in the Senate.”

I looked at them.

Then at the news.

Then at the spider on my wrist — a small one, black and gold.

It was shaking.

And for the first time in days, I felt like I was the one being watched.

⸻

**Tasha**

“What the hell?” I muttered, flipping through the channels like I didn’t already know what I’d find.

“Language,” my dad warned from the kitchen, but even he wasn’t really listening.

My mom, was sitting at the table, staring at her phone. Not scrolling. Just staring.

“Senator Calderon’s passing leaves a significant void in national defense policy,” the anchor said.

Void?

He’d been murdered.

I didn’t know how I knew. But I did.

“This is shady,” I said, turning the screen toward them. “You guys don’t think this was random, right?”

My dad frowned. “Well, news says it was health issues.”

“And since when do they ever say the truth?”

My mom exhaled. “Sweetheart, don’t get involved with politics. It’s dirty and dangerous.”

“Exactly,” I said under my breath.

Because if they could do that to a senator…

What could they do to us?

⸻

**Trent**

“Yo,” I called out from the hallway. “Y’all see this?”

No one answered. Figures. Mom was at work. Dad probably asleep on the couch again.

I turned the volume up.

“…massive loss for the Gold Capes initiative, with speculation already rising over who will inherit Calderon’s role in the Association’s advisory board.”

I didn’t know the guy personally.

But anyone that important, dead without warning?

That didn’t sit right.

I checked the group chat.

Nothing from Danny.

Nothing from Lívia.

That’s when I knew it was real.

⸻

**Clint**

I saw the headline in the corner of the screen while waiting for my mom to finish folding laundry.

Didn’t say anything.
Didn’t blink.
Just stared.

“Another one bites the dust,” my stepdad muttered, not even looking up from his beer.

I kept my mouth shut.

The news kept rolling.

“—new reports suggest Senator Calderon may have been under investigation for alleged misuse of federal funds linked to powered youth programs. While the investigation was never made public, sources now claim internal audits were underway prior to his death.”

I felt it before I understood it.

Something deep, slow, sinking. Like a memory slipping under water.

I turned away from the screen, but the words stuck to me.

Misuse of funds.
Powered youth.

It wasn’t just noise.

It was familiar.

But I didn’t know why.

Like I was forgetting something important and couldn’t even remember what it used to feel like.

My mom said something. I didn’t catch it.

I just nodded and picked up another towel.

And tried to ignore the way my hands were shaking.

⸻

**Mina**

I was brushing my teeth when the bathroom screen lit up with breaking news.

Toothbrush halfway to my mouth. Foam dripping down my chin.

The name hit first.
Then the photo.
Then… Lívia.

Only for a second.

She wasn’t crying.

She wasn’t blinking.

She was just standing near a patrol car, clutching her sketchbook like it was the only thing still keeping her body together. Eyes wide. Frozen. Like something inside her had already left.

I stopped moving.

Just… froze.

The voice on the screen kept talking, too calm to be real.

“…authorities confirm no foul play, and urge the public not to indulge in conspiracy theories or unreliable statements. While some online posts claim the senator’s daughter witnessed the incident, early reports suggest she may be in a state of psychological shock and is not currently available for comment.”

My fingers twitched.

I swallowed wrong. Choked on the foam. Spat into the sink — pink and sour.

The screen blinked out.

Black. Dead. Too fast.

“Signal interference,” the house AI said like it meant nothing.

But I didn’t believe it.

No one ever does… when the darkness shows up exactly on time.

——-

**The Teacher**

I leaned against the wall long after the others had gone, still trying to steady my breath. The blood had dried under my nose. My heartbeat hadn’t.

Leo hadn’t moved.

He just sat there, hands in his lap, gaze far away — like he was watching something I couldn’t see. Or maybe waiting for something I couldn’t stop.

“Elis,” I said, still breathless. “Stay with him. Don’t leave him alone.”

She didn’t argue.

Just nodded and crossed the room, taking a chair by the far wall. Close enough to watch him. Far enough not to provoke.

I dragged my feet toward the hallway. Every step felt heavier than the last. Not just fatigue — distortion. Like reality itself was still shivering from the ripple he left behind.

I barely made it to my office before slumping into the chair.

Elis followed minutes later.

She didn’t sit.

She just stood there, arms crossed, like if she kept her muscles tense enough, the truth wouldn’t collapse the room around us.

“That wasn’t normal,” she said.

“No.” I closed my eyes. “It wasn’t.”

“You didn’t just lose blood.”

I nodded slowly. “I lost… something. For a moment, I forgot your name. Forgot why I was even standing there.”

Elis stayed silent, her eyes darkening.

“We need to be careful,” I said. “He’s not just unstable. He’s fragmented. And I don’t think he understands any of it.”

“He’s scared,” she muttered. “And so are we.”

I looked at her.

“No,” I said. “We’re not scared. Not yet. We’re guessing. That’s worse.”

A pause.

Then I continued.

“We have to understand what he is. Not just the power. The pattern. The origin. The rules — if there are any.”

Elis didn’t reply right away.

Then she sighed. “So what? Research? Interviews? Psychic scans? You almost got erased just by touching his mind.”

“I know.”

A long silence settled between us.

Then I said it.

“There’s only one person I’ve ever met who’s dealt with something close to this. Not the same, but close enough to build a frame around it.”

Elis didn’t look up.

“You’re not talking about—”

“I am.”

Her jaw clenched. “Zenos. Don’t.”

“I have to.”

“She hates anomalies. You know that. She hates when things don’t fit. She’ll break him before she tries to understand him.”

“She’s also the only person who might survive analyzing him without losing her identity.”

Elis stepped forward, voice sharp now. “She tried to get your whole class shut down. She called Leo ‘biohazard trash’ before even meeting him.”

I stood up.

“She’s also my mother.”

That shut her up.

I didn’t say it with pride. I didn’t say it with hate. I just said it like a fact I’d spent years trying to forget.

Elis stared at me for a long time. Then finally, softly: “She won’t help us.”

I looked at her.

“She will,” I said. “Because this time, I’m not giving her a choice.”

——-

When I opened the door again, Leo was exactly where I’d left him.

Same chair. Same posture. Same impossible stillness.

But the air around him was quieter now.

Not safe — but… steadier. Like something inside him had settled just enough to stop flickering.

I stepped in, let the door close behind me.

He didn’t look up.

I spoke anyway.

“My place has a spare room. It’s nothing fancy. Smells like books and coffee. Sometimes blood, if I forget to clean.”

Still nothing.

I kept going, tone dry as ever. “It’s not exactly a five-star retreat, but I think you’ll sleep better there than here. And… I’d feel better having you under a roof I can control.”

That got a flicker in his eyes. He didn’t move, but he was listening.

I took a step closer.

“You don’t have to say anything. Just nod, and we go.”

He hesitated. Then — one nod. Small. Barely there.

But I saw it.

And that was enough.

⸻

Elis met me at the end of the hallway.

Her arms were crossed. Same as always. But her eyes had softened — just a fraction.

“He said yes?” she asked.

“He nodded.”

“That’s basically a contract,” she said, deadpan.

I smirked. “He’ll be staying with me.”

She raised a brow. “You sure that’s wise?”

“No.”

“Same old Zenos. Leaping into volcanoes with a stick and a guess.”

I exhaled. “He needs distance. Space to stabilize. I’ll watch him.”

She nodded, then added with a faint smirk, “You do remember who else lives in your house, right?”

I grimaced. “Believe me. I’m counting the hours until she threatens to dissect me.”

“I’ll join you both later,” Elis said, stepping aside to let us pass. “Bringing a few bodies. For, you know… enrichment.”

“Lovely,” I muttered. “Bring flowers next time.”

She gave me a two-finger salute. “Drive safe.”

Leo followed me without a word.

⸻

The car ride started with the usual awkward silence.

Old seats. Cold windows. The dashboard light flickered like it knew what we were carrying.

Leo sat in the passenger seat like he didn’t know how to fit into it. Like maybe it would reject him if he breathed too loud.

I didn’t push.

Just turned on the engine and started driving.

Three blocks in, I tried.

“You allergic to music?”

Leo shook his head.

“Good.”

I tapped the stereo. It clicked, whirred — then failed.

Typical.

I slapped the side of it. “Of course.”

Leo glanced at me. Then, cautiously, looked at the stereo again.

He didn’t speak.

But I felt something shift.

The air bent slightly.

A pressure, faint and wrong.

And then — the stereo blinked out of existence.

No static. No spark. No crack.

It was just… gone.

Like it had never been there at all.

We both stared at the hole where it used to be.

I looked at him.

He looked at his hands.

Then at me.

“…Sorry,” he whispered.

I didn’t shout. Didn’t react.

Just kept one hand on the wheel and said, “At least it wasn’t the engine.”

He blinked.

And for the first time — the first time — Leo smiled.

Not big. Not long. But real.

And just like that, the silence didn’t feel so hostile anymore.

⸻

Fifteen minutes later, we pulled up to a house that looked like it wanted to be left alone.

Three floors of weathered brick, vines choking the balcony rails, and windows that didn’t believe in curtains.

Leo looked at it with something between fear and curiosity.

“This is where I live,” I said.

He didn’t reply.

I added, “And also where my mother lives. Don’t worry — she hates me more than she’ll ever hate you.”

He gave me a look. A questioning one.

I nodded. “You’ll see.”

We stepped out of the car.

The gate groaned in protest.

And I led the most dangerous student I’d ever met… straight into the lion’s den.

We purchased roasted coffee from one roaster at 27 EUR/kg for coffee harvested last year. Now, for the new batch, the price has increased to 35 EUR/kg.

A few details:
	•	The roastery is quite new, operating for about 6 months.
	•	They mostly do omni roasting.
	•	The coffee scores around 84 score (SCA).
	•	The coffees are good but not rare or competition-level lots.

We are based in Europe and understand prices can fluctuate, but:

🔹 Do you think this 30% price increase is reasonable and justified given the current market conditions?
🔹 What price changes are you seeing for similar roasted coffee (e.g., Costa Rica, Nicaragua, washed or honey processed) from your suppliers or roasters?

I won't claim it reinvented hot beverages for me, but I did notice a significant upgrade compared to my older, slower model. Between its sleek design and sturdy performance, there’s plenty to discuss, both good and bad.

**Sophisticated and Functional Design**  
Visually, this electric kettle is stunning. The blend of clear borosilicate glass and brushed stainless steel feels premium yet understated, adding that touch of charm to my countertop. Watching the water boil through the glass body, with the blue LED light glowing softly, is oddly satisfying—it’s functional and aesthetically pleasing. The wide mouth is a small yet brilliant feature, making refilling and cleaning far easier than other kettles I've owned. Its 360° rotating base offers flexibility, allowing me or anyone else in the household to grab it from any angle without hassle. The cord storage in the base was a thoughtful touch for tidy countertops, an often-overlooked detail by other brands.

**Upsides**  
- Boils water fast, thanks to its 1,500-watt motor, saving time on busy mornings.  
- Auto shut-off feature prevents accidental dry boiling—essential!  
- The concealed heating element keeps toxins at bay while maintaining an evenly heated brew.  
- Lightweight and cordless when off the base, making it easy to carry and pour.

**Reliable Performance but Not Without Its Quirks**  
This kettle's performance stands out because it delivers what it promises—boiling water quickly and safely. I tested it for both small and full water capacities, and the consistency in performance was impressive. However, I noticed the kettle can be a bit noisy at times, particularly when reaching a full boil. It’s not ear-splittingly loud, but if you’re someone who prefers silently tiptoeing around in the morning like I sometimes do, it might catch your attention. Still, the job gets done swiftly, and I rarely feel like I'm wasting time waiting for my morning coffee water.

**Pitfalls**  
- Slightly noisy towards the boiling point—nothing major but noticeable in the wrong setting.  
- The lid doesn't lock into place when pouring, meaning hot steam can create a cautionary moment.  
- Glass, though beautiful, shows smudges easily, requiring extra cleaning if you want it to look spotless.  

**Safety Features Fit for a Family**  
One of my favorite aspects is its robust safety features. The handle is cool to the touch even when the water is scorching hot, making it safe for my absentminded family members who grab things without thinking. The auto shut-off mechanism kicks in the moment all the water has boiled, which is reassuring for someone like me who occasionally forgets to check it in time. Still, I do wish the manual mentioned the advice ""Do not pour with the lid open"" more prominently. It’s a small detail, but one that feels really important when hot liquids are involved.

**Compared to Other Competitors**  
Before settling on this electric kettle, I debated between this and the Hamilton Beach 40998 model. This Peach Street option, with its borosilicate glass body, feels slightly more sophisticated compared to Hamilton Beach’s plastic build. While they both offer auto shut-off functions, Peach Street edges ahead with the concealed heating element and easier visibility thanks to its glass design. On the downside, the Hamilton Beach version is quieter, so for those who prioritize minimal noise, it might be worth considering. But if you want a combination of design and strong functionality, this one wins hands down.

**Affordable Quality**  
For its features, build quality, and everyday effectiveness, I found it to offer great bang for the buck. It feels durable and thoughtfully engineered for the price point, performing just as well as higher-end electric kettles you’d find at double the cost. Its quick boiling time alone makes mornings smoother, which, to me, validates the investment. While its competitors like Cuisinart and Breville tend to lean towards premium pricing, this kettle walks the balance between price and efficiency.

Like you have to face ur subordinates at work and look them in the eye and think, I wonder if these people actually respects me just because I’m their boss and behind me they laugh at meand having relatives who kept fat shaming me telling me you are too fat but ure not even getting pregnant. That feeling where I kept coming up with excuses to not work in the office and just WFH because I can’t face my people, our clients as well thinking how fat I look in every dress I wear. Every night after my exhausting work, I face the mirror and tell myself how ugly I am. Not because my definition of beauty is slim but u know that feeling of not feeling beautiful because ur fat? I have that feeling everyday. 

Until one day, I looked at the mirror and told myself, I need a miracle! My lifestyle is very dirty, j smoke, I drink, I work 12-14hrs daily 6days a week, no time or too lazy for gym, not even to walk 5mins! I tried every single pill there is, teas, coffee and even those RF/Lipo non evasive treatments— nothing worked! So I needed a miracle — something that is applicable to my lazy arse and dirty lifestyle. 

I met SF thru search for anything slimming, pinged them out of desperation and I was at the point where I’d do anything to loose weight but not exceed much effort. I told myself, if this does not work, I will go for invasive surgery — Lipo. 

Gladly they responded! And in 30mins my order is being packed. I didn’t even ask of the basic questions, I was desperate. Didn’t ask for any purity whatever. I already knew SF as basis on the people’s feedback and I didn’t need to exercise (compared to the other one I inquired from before that I apparently had to walk 10,000steps a day, like hell no, I’m fat I’m lazy, I work longhours and I can’t be bothered to be walking daily) 

I started with the initial dosage, boom! I still eat but gets full easily. From a box of pizza to just a quarta slice.

As someone trying to get the perfect coffee every morning without having to step out of the house, this high-tech coffee maker felt like a piece of art sitting on my kitchen counter. But, no machine is perfect, and there’s plenty to unpack when it comes to this one—both the brilliant and the so-so.

**Elegant Design, But It’s a Countertop Beast**

This machine does turn heads with its glossy diamond-black finish. It’s like owning a luxury car, but for coffee. However, I had to make significant room on my counter because the machine’s dimensions, 17.75”D x 12.62”W x 15”H, make it *massive*. It’s not something you can tuck away, so if you’re tight on space, be ready to sacrifice some real estate. Despite its size, the sleek, modern style makes it a centerpiece in my kitchen, and the premium materials scream Swiss engineering—precise and high-quality.

**A Technology Lover’s Dream: The Customization and Automation**

Coffee customization takes a new level of fun with this espresso maker. I tested its whopping 32 specialty coffee options on some busy mornings and quiet afternoons, from a simple espresso to the trending cold brew drinks. Thanks to the Product Recognizing Grinder (P.R.G.), it adjusts the grind just right with no room for human error, allowing every cup to suit the specific drink. The touchscreen is responsive, and the optional AI and WiFi functions add a futuristic touch.

That said, the WiFi Connect feature drove me crazy. It felt like fighting with a stubborn toddler—it refused to cooperate! I eventually gave up trying to use the J.O.E. app altogether because it wouldn’t sync properly. Eh, manual interaction isn’t the end of the world, but for a machine at this price point, I hoped for flawless connectivity.

**Highlights**

- Truly versatile: from creamy lattes to icy cold brews.
- Touchscreen and optional AI simplify coffee brewing.
- Quiet and efficient coffee grinders adjust grind levels swiftly.
- The automatic milk frother does wonders—my cappuccinos look café-perfect.

**Daily Maintenance: Manageable but Diligent**

Routine maintenance is almost meditative at times, yet it’s a commitment. Its automatic cleaning programs ensure hygiene and prolong its lifespan. Cleaning the milk system takes about three minutes. What caught my attention, however, was the frequent cleaning prompts even after short usage bursts. I get the logic—clean machine, better coffee—but the drip tray needed emptying so often that it turned into its mini workout!

The cost of Jura’s cleaning products creeps up over time. Replacing water filters and maintaining the frother weekly kept adding to my grocery bill in ways I hadn’t anticipated.

**Perks**

- Automated cleaning cycles make maintenance straightforward for busy mornings.
- Sturdy build means fewer mechanical breakdowns even with intense use.
- Milk system’s precision makes frothing a breeze.


**Shortcomings**

- WiFi features are pretty much useless—a huge disappointment for remote brewing.
- Small liquid capacities leave larger cup lovers wanting more.
- Frequent prompts for drip tray emptying could’ve been minimized with a bigger tray.
- Beans occasionally need manual stirring as they don’t always feed naturally into the grinder.

**Competing Products**

I know what you’re thinking—should you spend on this, or are there more wallet-friendly options? Having tested the Jura Z10 alongside my father-in-law’s De’Longhi Magnifica and even hearing friends rave about the Breville Oracle Touch, I see the gaps in Jura’s pricing strategy. De’Longhi may lack the sheer customizability of this unit, but for less than half the price, its espresso quality comes close. On the other hand, Breville adds a bit more theatrical flair with its manual steam wand, which felt more engaging as a coffee enthusiast.

What Jura does best is convenience—it’s button-push efficiency at its finest when paired with super-rich milk-based drinks like flat whites. On the flip side, not everyone wants to shell out this much for slightly faster, more convenient brewing when other brands can give you a solid coffee experience with a bit more work.

**Cost Efficiency**

I hesitated to splurge initially, but after weeks of ditching frequent Starbucks runs, I felt the machine began paying for itself. For households brewing multiple cups a day or a collective group of coffee drinkers, the Jura Z10 might prove worth the premium. However, if only one or two cups are needed, the ROI sinks quickly.

For those still debating, consider whether the cold brew specialty or premium automated milk frothing truly matter to your routine. If absolute perfection isn’t necessary, compact budget-conscious machines might suit you better.

I really like the all in one design - no need to find a place to set down the dripper, just toss the filter and pour. I don't want to brew directly into a cup, so either an all in one or a dripper and dedicated carafe. Aesthetically I'm partial to clear glass, but have definitely discovered the hard way that it may not be the safest choice! I still have like 3 boxes of chemex filters though. 


I also haven't gone too deep down the rabbit hole. I have a decent budget grinder (Capresso) and a good gooseneck kettle (bonavista). My hands hurt in the morning so no hand grinder for me. I weigh my beans on a tiny old scale I had laying around, spritz, grind, bloom, pour.  I figured out a steady rhythm for my pour and got pretty consistent results without a scale and timer. I'd definitely consider a better scale/timer and more involved method in this potential upgrade.


I also have a ""bottomless"" coffee subscription at their ""basic"" price point, single origin, light to medium range. I usually pick African beans, occasionally Mexican or South American. 


With all that background info, I'd love some dripper and scale recommendations! Hoping to keep it all under $150, which seems like it shouldn't be too hard. ",1,1752327938.0,pourover,8,0.6,False

I'm a lesbian woman, and I wasn't sure about her, but suddenly she started gazing and smiling at me for some seconds longer than usual (and longer than with other people). She was receptive when I started chatting with her, she was curious about me. Also, I showed her I *see* her by making a comment about some detail I noticed about her, and then she also made the same thing about me. So I thought, well, there miiight be something going on here. I followed her on instagram, she was fast at following me back, seeing my stories, messaging me and so on.

But, we only met at the gym, and we couldn't have a proper conversation to know each other better because everytime there was someone interrupting. I'm pretty shy and I can't relax to have a nice conversation if people keep interrupting me or speaking louder at my side, it's quite annoying.

I know she runs in a park close to my house, so I messaged her and asked if she would like to go grab a coffee or some coconut water after her training this weekend. It was not an invitation for a romantic date, nor did I wanted more than to have a nice talk in the park at this very first moment - actually, I would be pretty much open to a nice friendship before anything else. I made sure to keep my message light-hearted too. Her answer was pretty much like

*""I will not be in town this weekend. in fact, there will be a lot of weekends in which I will not be in town. I'll be travelling in all of them this month.""*

It was the weirdest reply, because it was cold as hell and, well, I felt like she was running away from me - as if I wanted to grab her and force her to do something.

I don't feel bad for asking her out and I don't think I did it wrong, as I wasn't expecting nothing more than a nice chat in the park. I also don't think I imagined those long eye contacts exchanged, but I wasn't assuming 100% she was into me. I just thought we were having a good exchange.

We went into Julie's house, my brother telling me to ignore what happened outside. Her family was great, except for her brother, Matt.

I wanted to bail on the trip, but I powered through it. We got to the cabin, settled in, and chilled. Around 7 pm, we started on the chips my brother and I brought. I grabbed my bag of Takis, and Matt asked if I was sharing. I said yeah, but didn't touch any. We watched movies, played Nintendo, and relaxed until midnight. My brother and Julie went to bed.

I’m 28 and from the UK. Like a lot of us on here, looking to find a connection that flows. Something you actually look forward to. Rare, but not impossible.



Love story telling in all its forms, but especially reading. Escaping into another world, yes please. Currently reading a bit of a guilty pleasure genre. Still fun though. You can ask what it is if you’re feeling brave. Or guess. Bonus points if you’ve got your own guilty pleasure read, or watch, or playlist to swap.



I keep telling myself I’ll get back to my other love, history, but so far it’s mostly the band Sabaton keeping the dream alive. I’m seeing them live later this year, which is proof I still love history, even if it’s in a slightly unconventional way. If you’re into bands with historical flair or just like great live music, I’d definitely recommend them.



I’ve also caught the running bug. Help! Got into it on a whim, became even more obsessed after my first race, and now I’m deep in the running cult. I’m not above posting my Strava stats on Insta, but I’m definitely not cool enough for the curated fitness reel life. The meditative state during a good run, the post-race high, and a good coffee or pint after — all part of the running experience I happily subscribe to.



As a self-confessed member of the totally not running cult, I feel like you should reciprocate the baring of my soul. Which one are you part of? 🤣



Now that I’ve rambled like I’m surviving on very little sleep and too much caffeine, (cough cough,) both true, it’s only fair you tell me about yourself. What’s your thing? What’s the hobby or obsession you’d like me to get into?



Honestly, I just enjoy getting to know people. The deep stuff, the dumb stuff, all the in-between. I’m into tangents, chats that spiral in the best way, and before you know it, we've landed somewhere unexpectedly lovely. Basically, the kind of connection that actually feels like something worth seeing through, wherever it leads, friendship or something with sparks.



Got a book that’ll hit me in the best way? A running tip that doesn’t involve buying yet another pair of shoes? I’m listening.



If you made it all the way down here, clearly we both have commitment and stamina. Promising start already.

I keep telling myself I’ll get back to my other love, history, but so far it’s mostly the band Sabaton keeping the dream alive. I’m seeing them live later this year, which is proof I still love history, even if it’s in a slightly unconventional way. If you’re into bands with historical flair or just like great live music, I’d definitely recommend them.



I’ve also caught the running bug. Help! Got into it on a whim, became even more obsessed after my first race, and now I’m deep in the running cult. I’m not above posting my Strava stats on Insta, but I’m definitely not cool enough for the curated fitness reel life. The meditative state during a good run, the post-race high, and a good coffee or pint after are all part of the running experience I happily subscribe to.



As a self-confessed member of the totally not running cult, I feel like you should reciprocate the baring of my soul. Which one are you part of? 🤣



Now that I’ve rambled like I’m surviving on very little sleep and too much caffeine, (cough cough,) both true, it’s only fair you tell me about yourself. What’s your thing? What’s the hobby or obsession you’d like me to get into?



Honestly, I just enjoy getting to know people. The deep stuff, the dumb stuff, all the in-between. I’m into tangents, chats that spiral in the best way, and before you know it, we've landed somewhere unexpectedly lovely. Basically, the kind of connection that actually feels like something worth seeing through, and hopefully along the way, sparks fly and find us.



Got a book that’ll hit me in the best way? A running tip that doesn’t involve buying yet another pair of shoes? I’m listening.

I fell in love with her when I saw an ad including her while I was jerking it to Ken. My sexuality changed. I suddenly came to this beauty instead of my beloved Ken. I couldn’t believe what had just happened. Ever since that day, I never got hard to Ken ever again. I couldn’t get hard to him. But Luna turned me on every single time. Hearing her name, hell even writing this even makes me so excited that I’ve already leaked quite a load in my pants.
I quit Clash Royale and Brawl Stars just for my queen. I hop on mo.co and endlessly goon to her. I go into worlds, searching for the quest where you protect her. I can’t even play the game normally because my brain just forces me to take my pants off to jerk off violently right when she appears on my screen.
It has completely changed my life in so many ways. Yesterday I was at Starbucks and I heard the minimum wage slave yell “Luna” in my ears. I couldn’t resist. I instantly ran to her and took the cup, licking the sharpie written on the cup clean and I did my thing and came inside the coffee. A girl stared at me in awe. It’s not even my choice anymore, it’s pure muscle memory and I cannot control it at all.
I love Luna so much. I just want to embrace her hot body and have her tell me how much of a good boy I am and let me tell her how much I love her. I would be perfect for her. I need her. She needs me. I’d show her the full jars just for her, each jar representing 1% of my pure loyalty for my wife. I would put all of the loads from the jars into her and create so many perfect babies with her. I want to create a world where me and her live in a house beside a farm where our kids play and where we make sweet love every day and night. I exist purely for Luna.

1ly0p8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1ly0p8o/my_short_but_annoying_gerd_success_story/,My (short but annoying) GERD success story,"2-3 months ago I started experiencing extremely severe back pain, localised to the mid-right. It started during the night and it hit *HARD*. I spent a few sleepless nights like this before one night it started, and simply did not stop throughout the following day. I rushed to see a doctor, who formally diagnosed me with GERD and slapped me with some Gaviscon for 2 of weeks.

Based on ChatGPT’s advice I spent 6 weeks on Gaviscon + also Omeprazole. It was some of the worst 6 weeks of my life. The pain was horrible, the fear of triggering it was intense, I had to let go of everything I loved eating and drinking. When the pain came it was brutal, and when I had a flare up it was made significantly worse by dry swallowing. All symptoms (including lack of heartburn, globus sensation, mild dyspepsia) pointed to esophageal motility disorder. I was aghast finding out how hard those are to treat, and how bad some of them (Achalasia) can get.

After 6 weeks of no improvement, I want to a GI and got an endoscopy done the same day. He found antral gastritis and tested me positive for h. Pylori. I spent the next two weeks on esomeprazole + PPI’s + ulcefate and probiotics. During this time I also definitively tied my pain episodes to spicy food - they would reliably come on 1-2 hours after ingesting anything with capsaicin. 2 weeks later + a couple of 24h fasts, I am practically cured. I am drinking coffee again, eating spicy food, and experiencing virtually none of the symptoms that plagued me.

The two biggest take aways from this are:
- GI diseases are *complex*. I saw multiple doctors and consulted ChatGPT extensively. The GI that saw me through to the end suspects my symptoms were a cascade of dysfunction from my antral gastritis, and the mid back pain was peristaltic spasming near the duodenum. Others think it is all esophageal spasming. I am still not 100% sure which is which.
- My biggest leaps in improvements were after fasting. 24h fasts greatly turned the dial down on any symptoms I had. If they came back, they were lighter and weaker. A small regimen of 1 day eat/1 day fast for a week basically eliminated all my leftover symptoms after triple therapy, and I’ve read that they can take months to get better after h. pylori. 

I found very little information about my specific symptom profile. I hope this post helps others like me in the future. All the best to you all!",2,1752327550.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

Okay, so, this is really happening, and I'm still trying to figure out how to deal with it. I'm 19, and my older brother, who's 27, and his girlfriend, ""Julie"" (she's 28), decided to escape this crazy heat by spending a week in a cabin up north. My brother's been working like crazy, so Julie surprised him with the trip, which was really cool of her. She thought it would be a good idea to invite me along, and for her brother to come too, so we could bond. Seemed normal enough, right?

We woke up super early, like 6:30 AM, and hit up WinCo for what we thought were ""essentials""—basically a mountain of snacks. Then we went to Walmart for actual essentials, you know, toiletries, real food, the works. The trip was on. We even stopped for donuts and iced coffees on the way to Julie's.

I'm a total introvert who's obsessed with video games, so I was hoping her brother would be similar. I really thought we could be friends, but now? No way. We get to Julie's house, and there he is: a 21-year-old dude, maybe 6'2"", and seriously heavy-set, wearing an MHA shirt that's way too small. Okay, whatever. I introduce myself, and he barely even looks at me. Then, get this, he shoves me out of the way—shoves me!—to run and hug my brother. A 21-year-old hugging my brother like they haven't seen each other in years. It was just...weird. I'll drop a part 2 soon, I need to process this.

Into The Breach - Chapter 3: Black Spots

A new day began on Galileo station. Newly installed solar panels on the west side of the station shone bright in the dim light of distant star, as the lights scattered across them  bouncing off innumerable sparkly spikes of frost on the mostly dark surface of the fourth Galilean satellite. Sharp shadows outlined the protruding edges of each module. The sun hung high up in the sky, meaning it was three earthen days until the sunlight would be obscured by an enormous body of the gas giant.

Jason yawned. ""You know what?"" he asked his mentor, without turning his head. ""You were right, the view here is amazing. No anomalies, no thrown away probes, just a calm landscape of grey cosmic dust and shiny icy peaks. It's nice.""

""Ha, knew you'd dig it! It can even rival the sight of a sun rising above Antarctic wastelands in its beauty.""

""But I would still prefer a cup of Linguini's steaming bitterness to it. 'Dark As My Soul', as they say."" A cheeky grin crept onto Jason's face, as he anticipated all-too familiar conversation.

Allan, of course, could not see his student's face, and the same was true the other way around. His grimace, on the other hand, contorted in a display of disgust and repulsion. Sure, on Phobos station 'Linguini's' was a more than decent option to catch a bite, but whatever beverage was sold there under the guise of coffee was positively abhorrent. Which was probably somehow connected to the old Italian's partial blindness. ""Not gonna lie, kid, I actually believe you can effectively halve your expected lifespan by drinking it daily.""

""M-hm,"" Jason acknowledged, smacking his lips. ""Makes you cherish every moment.""

""Horseshit. For the life of me cannot understand how in the hell you are drinking it.""

""With my very own mouth, duh. You should give it a try someday."" Simple banter like this really made one feel a little bit better. Of course, it was closely followed with complaints of how boiled soot made for a better beverage than 'Linguini's' special coffee, but complaining about it was not in the spirit of 'The Club'.

""You spoke something about Antarctic wastes,"" remarked Jason, ""consider me intrigued.""

""Yeah, it sure is something I tell you. No wonder 'Below Zero' is selling cruise tickets like hotcakes despite their prices - the view is to die for.""

""Huh? You've never told me you've been there.""

""'Das 'cause I haven't!"" - Allan bursted out laughing.

""Then how-"" Jason stuttered, before coming to a realization. ""You old fleabag. Holorooms do not count.""

""I take it you're not a fan?"" the Main Engineer asked. ""You know, day will come and you won't be able to tell the holoroom apart from the actual place.""

""I dread the day,"" Jason replied with a sigh. ""I hope tech won't ever be able to replicate it one-to-one.""

""Why so? Would take away the *feeling*?""

""Yeah, kinda sorta."" Allan smirked to that, this time keeping his thoughts to himself. ""You know, I sometimes feel bad for Divit,"" the younger of the two added, yawning.

Allan let out an intrigued hum, demanding further elaboration.

""He'll never be able to see Earth's sights firsthand."" Jason thought for a bit and continued, ""I mean, he can, but it would be more 'see Paris and die' kind of a visit, being born on Mars and all that shit.""

""It's not often I get the chance to say it, but I'll be damned, you're being quite an optimist thinking any of us would be so lucky as to visit Earth once again in our lifetimes.""

""I mean... You're not wrong, but I would still like to believe I will at least be able to see a nice little sunset before I kick the bucket.""

Allan shrugged. ""May be, may be. Let's hope someone will come up with a better form of rehabilitation program while we are stranded here watching after some space-time bullshit. Speaking of watching after stuff"" - Allan had finally decided the time had come to change the topic, his tone shifting drastically - ""if you've got sharp enough eyes, you can spot our little Carnus somewhere o-o-over there,"" - as he pointed at the black sky, the man standing next to him squinted his eyes, turning to his right. ""Now, where's that friend of yours? I did not get a chance to speak to him properly yesterday.""

""He's brushing his teeth, or something,"" Jason replied, trying to make out the shimmering light that was the probe.

""And you?""

""And I am not. Don't want to waste such a precious resource as clean water. And I'm a lazy ass,"" the younger engineer admitted tiredly. ""To be honest, I wouldn't mind staining my teeth even further with something hot, black and bitter right now."" Allan simply sighed in response. As they stood there appreciating the frozen scenery, the younger engineer continued, ""Now that I think of it, I don't even remember the last time I experienced an actual twenty-four-hour long solar day, be it on Earth or on Mars.""

""Don't you dare tell me you're feeling homesick already. It's been like what? Sixteen hours?""

""Nevermind. Just thinking out loud.""

""You better goddamn be,"" Allan retorted. ""Oh fuck, we're outta time, gotta go now. I bet your friend is already looking for us."" With that being said, the Main Engineer turned away from dancing lights.

As they approached the main entrance, Jason yawned once again. ""Fuck"" - he cursed and shook his head - ""do you know if Michael happen to have some magic caffeine pills, or something of sorts?""

""Nah, don't think so. They're not *essential* after all. And he sure as hell ain't giving you any adrenaline microshots.""

""I guess I should've taken a pack of these glazed cacao beans or whatever then. Might've came in handy.""

""Next shipment, my boy, next shipment. And a full can of coffee. Now chop-chop, time's waiting for no one,"" Allan concluded, shutting the airtight doors behind them.

Alina stood up, looked around taking in her work and sighed, fanning herself with the back of her hand. It felt great to finally relax her stiffened back after a couple of hours of poking sticks at flowers. ""Well, it took a bit longer than I expected when you said you needed help with vegetation real quick.""

""Yea, my bad. Sorry 'bout that"" - Sophie apologized without any apparent remorse in her voice - ""that 'coupla patches got a bit out of hand, I give ya that. It doesn't get much more bangin' than that, but there's not much else we can do. These guys needed to be pollinated, and quick.""

""Ah, nevermind. I wouldn't call this experience *enthralling*, but it was not *too* bad. The more we do now, the less we have to do later. If only we had some lunar bees though…""

""...We woulda had a whole lotta more work to do. Besides, transporting those little buzzers all the way over here would've been just a pain in the ass both literally and not."" - the woman beside her laughed at her own joke.

""I guess you are right. Well, can't say I was missing this, but hey, at least my head is somewhat occupied."" Locking her fingers behind her head, she stretched out once again. ""I could have sworn I felt my mind falling into the cabin fever out there."" She slowly tilted her head to the left trying to get rid of stiffness in her neck. An audible 'pop' echoed throughout the room. ""Jeez, I guess I could really use a break, and you?""

""'Course! We're done here for now anyway,"" noticing Alina doubtfully raising her brow, Sophie elaborated, ""I've dealt with whatever we had right before your arrival, and 'tats don't need to be pollinated at all for now, so we have all the time in the world 'till five p.m. station time.""

""Good. And then what?"" Before Sophie could answer however, Alina erupted in a subdued howl - ""Aeuugh! I came here hoping to explore Europa and now the only suitable probe is thrown away! What the fuck am I going to be doing here?""

""You know, I'm a bota-""

""Jesus Christ, Sophie! I know you are a botanist! You have all *this!*"" Alina cried, spreading her hands. ""I can do nothing, at this point I am just a token fourth side participant! And I cannot even prove it wrong with no access to samples!"" - she kept punching her thigh to drive the point home. ""I'm sorry, I didn't mean-""

""There-there, das alright, shit happens girl, nothing to be sorry 'bout there,"" - Sophie's mind raced to find something to lighten her colleague's mood. And she was a great talker - ""But you still got the second one, right? I'm sure there's a way to send it to Europa instead of Ganymede. Ugh, believe it or not, I still get confused by these Greek names sometimes. Why'd they give up on such beautiful names as 'Curiosity', 'Perseverance' and 'Excellence'?"" - she steered the topic away from uncomfortable thoughts.

""Because it got to the point where the public was constantly confusing one for the other."" Alina sighed deeply, still feeling down. ""Yeah, we did bring a probe, but Ilus was specifically designed to explore Ganymede, not Europa. Guys said it just does not have proper sensors, or something along those lines, so it would be a complete waste of time and resources to send it on a mission it is not suited for.""

""What 'bout the one that's somewhere on this ball? It can be refit to a certain extent, right? Al said all the important sensors are here, in case they would come in handy later.""

""If only it was that simple. Probes are not made out of legos, you can't just plug whatever you want however you want onto it. Besides, it is somewhere on the north pole. Retrieving it is just not worth it right now."" She sighed and continued, ""About the one we brought - I doubt there are any plans on sending Ilus anywhere in the near future with that thing floating above our heads. It kinda threw a monkey wrench into our plans.""

With a sly smile on her face Sophie made an attempt to lift her roommate's spirits, ""I wouldn't be so sure 'bout that if I were you. You're kinda forgetting that UMN are *very* eager to get their hands on the Europa ice chunks and get the steady supply chain going asap. 'Tis in their interest, so mark my words, they *will* figure somethin' out."" Upon getting no response, she tried to fill the awkward silence, changing the subject to lift her friend's spirits, ""So… You up for some exercises?""

""I came here with the hopes to find new life yet now I have to rely on Martians of all people to score the next vote by majority to even have the *chance* to explore Europa further,"" murmured Alina, depressed. She then lifted her distant gaze off the green sprouts. ""I think I'll pass on this one, thanks. And yes, I know, we should keep ourselves in check, but one day never hurt any-""

""Oh, come on! You've spent your last dozen days sittin' in a chair, don'tcha dare tell me you're tired! Keep that up, and you won't stay this good for long! SAS ain't a good thing to have, ya know? Your bones go fragile, your muscles go floppy and your blood goes dumb. Now, you wouldn't want all this happenin' to you, do ya? Besides, boys prefer girls who keep themselves in shape,"" Sophie concluded, winking.

""All I'm asking for is one day."" When her roommate finished, however, Alina's eyes became round in surprise, as the realization hit her. ""What are you insinuating?""

Lowering her voice, the botanist whispered conspiratorially, ""I may or may not be talkin' 'bout a certain young man. I've seen the looks you gave him durin' our stay on the Moon.""

""Excuse me?!""

Divit impatiently shifted from one foot to the other, feeling the tension rising in the room. ""So... What does it say?""

""Well, as of now, nothing Interesting,"" Allan replied. ""I expected to see at least *something* at this point, but sensors ain't picking any deviations from estimated values right now. Maybe Terry was right yesterday and it has indeed finally come to rest.""

""And these sensors would be?.."" Jason asked, rubbing his nose. Not having enough sleep last night, he was back in a particularly bad mood, his cheer from an hour ago vanished seemingly without trace. The thoughts inside of his brain were moving way too slow for his liking. ""All I see is a camera feed. Is there even anything left besides it, or is it all somewhere in that pile of scrapmetal?"" he said, gesturing towards a table in a far corner of a chamber with his free hand.

The astrophysicist turned around to address the grumpy person standing behind him. ""Dude, it's all state-of-the-art technology, so this 'pile of scrap' is worth more than all of our savings combined! The specterometers alone are worth at least a couple hundred grand each!""

""And yet they are of no use to us currently. What a fucking shame.""

""Man, where are your spirits? I feel like if i get any closer to you I'm going to cut myself on all this edge. Come on, we're exploring the unknown after all! ""

""Because yesterday someone vanished like a…"" - Jason stopped, looking for proper words.

""*Like a fart into the wind*,"" Divit suggested with a sly smile on his face.

""Yes! Vanished the moment we were done connecting this"" - Jason tapped his foot to deliver the point - ""very module to a power grid, leaving me to deal with the remaining panels!""

""Okay, okay, point taken, but it still was not really my area of responsibility, just so you know.""

After a moment of silence the Main Engineer gave both disputants a stern look. ""You both done yet?"" he grumbled and turned on his seat back to the screens. ""Carnus is equipped with two seismometers and a coupled accelerometer which is precise enough for this mission. We will enter its gravity well any minute now. And Divit, stop fiddling with your fingers, the sound is very *distracting*.""

""Sorry,"" the astrophysicist said, grabbing one of his hands with the other behind his back.

The next twenty minutes passed mostly in silence as the probe closed the distance, broadcasting everything in its vicinity onto the tiny screen in the research sector of the Galileo station. Second screen was occupied by the view from the station's telescope, aimed directly at the probe. As Carnus was slowly approaching the anomaly, however, nothing happened.

Allan impatiently drummed his fingers on the table. ""How long can this go on? We should have entered the gravity well five minutes ago, yet there are no visible changes. Where the hell is this damn thing?"" Jason could've sworn he heard the old man mutter something about poor performance to himself.

""It is… where it is supposed to be - somewhere ahead of the probe,"" Divit remarked contemplatively with a frown on his face, his eyes running across the screen in a futile attempt to find at least some explanation. ""Carnus should be getting closer to it. And fast.""

""But the pull we are experiencing there is just as strong as at the station! Nothing changed! Like, zero deviation, null! This simply *cannot* be!"" Allan exclaimed. Both of them looked at each other, two very different emotions on their faces. ""We should get closer to it. The question is: do we slow down, divert the course to stay somewhere on its orbit or straight up headbutt it?""

""According to the currently available information I can safely say the probe can pass *through* the anomaly, if moving fast enough.""

Jason did nothing to hide the fact that he wasn't a fan of the idea. He crossed his arms, and tilting his head questioned doubtfully, ""What did the Captain say about it? We should have at least some instructions regarding the different approaches to acquiring data, right?""

""He said, and I quote"" - Allan coughed, and summoned his best impression of the Captain - ""'Explore this thing as thoroughly as you can within the shortest possible timeframe.' Now we have nothing, so it is a reasonable idea to get as close as possible.""

""And HotO?"" Jason asked incredulously.

""I can condense his speech to basically:"" - the main engineer's voice changed once again - ""'Proceed at your own discretion. The probe is worth a lot, but the knowledge is invaluable.'""

""Maybe diverse the course *a bit* so our little probe won't crash into it?""

""I don't think it is at all possible at this point,"" - the astrophysicist shook his head. ""And even if it is, a good idea it certainly is not. Probe is going too fast now. We don't want it to perform an uncontrollable Icarus maneuver and shoot out of it in a random direction. Or even be crushed by tidal forces passing too close to the rim, since we cannot safely say where *exactly* it is to divert the course, because we cannot reliably define it. With its current speed, however, Carnus might just be able to fly straight through the anomaly if we let it fall into it, if it is what I think it is, of course. Besides, all the data the probe collects in the process would be priceless.""

Jason rubbed his chin and asked, ""So what you're saying is that orbiting it is not on the table?""

""Exactly. We cannot say how far it is from the probe, we can only triangulate its approximate position, which is not great, if the probe starts slowly descending into its lower orbit.""

Allan put his face in hands and sighed. ""Fine. But if we lose Carnus to this bloody thing, it will be on you too, I hope you understand that,"" he said, lifting his head.

""Even If we do lose it, we still have Ilus, and I'm sure HotO would understand the circumstances. If it is-""

""*Ahem*. Not to interrupt you, but something is fucking with the probe's sensors. Accelerometer's readings are a bit funky,"" Jason interjected from behind.

Allan eyed the screen, evaluating the data. Aberrations were getting more and more clear with every second passing. ""This thing be damned! Dis shite is all over the place!""

""Uhm, Allan, can I ask you to increase reading frequency and put out the results, please?"" Divit asked, awkwardly rubbing his hands in excitement. Something finally caught his eye.

""These can neither be static, nor EM radiation, the camera feed is intact,"" the man continued without acknowledging the request, seemingly lost in thoughts. ""Yeah, sure, I can do that, but I don't see how it is going to help the situation. We tried different intervals here but it gave us nothing,"" he finally replied. A couple of long seconds and one chaotic graph later Allan turned to an astrophysicist and said, ""See?""

""Can I… Can I have a look at the top frequency readings?""

""You sure can. Well, it's time to see if the guys on the blue ball went cheap on us."" Allan tapped something into the console, opening a new window. ""'Ere you go.""

Shaking hands giving away his anxiety, Divit looked at a freshly formed graph. ""It fluctuates, but why..."" Rounding his eyes in understanding, he continued, ""There is no gravity well and these are not static either. These are ripples."" Divit traced the graph with his index finger, and, after receiving a disapproving grunt from the Main Engineer, continued, ""Chance is high you could not tell them apart from here because they overlapped, which is probably the case if the thing emitting them is of irregular shape.""

""But if these waves are overlapping, then they should've completely canceled each other, right?""

Divit shook his head with a slight smile creeping onto his face. ""I'm afraid gravitational waves might behave a bit more complicated than that. Besides, if anomaly is emitting *something else* alongside them, the end result might end up looking just as some kind of gravitational pull."" He suddenly collapsed into the chair next to the table, closing his eyes, as sudden realization hit him. ""Not of irregular shape, but rotating...""

""Rotating *what*? What even can interfere with gravitational waves?""

The astrophysicist covered his scrunched up face and started rubbing his nose with ring fingers. ""They are… They are..."" Taking his hands off his face, he looked up at two engineers. His eyes blazed with excitement. His shaking voice was overwhelmed by emotions. ""Oh my God, that's worth a Nobel Prize! Jason, you're a genius!""

""What the fuck? I will not be subject to such accusations.""

""Back when we received the data, remember? You said that we're waiting for the green men to *pop* out, didn't you?""

""To be frankly honest I don't remember shi-""

""They are dumping excess comperessed space through gravitational waves! That's how they jumpstart their A-drives! And stop too!""

""Yeah, right,"" Allan chimed in. ""Divit, please elaborate? I appreciate the enthusiasm, lad, but you'll have to break it down a bit.""

""Right, right. You see, you cannot just stop powering an Alcubierre drive, well, you can, but if you do so, comperessed space in front of the vessel will end up pushing it back in the general direction it came from, so you would need to *overshoot* your target, hoping that you'll end up where you wanted to end up. This is *incredibly* energy inefficient, so you do not want to do so anyway, or if you do, you're either a genius or a madman, maybe both."" One friendly reminder that he was getting a little sidetracked later, however, the speaker returned to the matter of the question. ""Anyways, if you do not want to do so, you not only have to slowly power down the bubble, because it would take ridiculous amounts of time, you'll have to somehow *unwrap* it to let the vessel out without being pushed in a random direction. Gravitational fluctuations are there to help to form and disperse the bubble,"" he concluded with a modicum of satisfaction.

Hearing this, Allan felt somewhat worried, rightfully so. ""'Tis an awful lot of space to spew out from one point if I'm reading this right. You sure it won't affect us?"" he asked concernedly. Divit shrugged in response.

""It is one point for a vessel. For an observer, however, it would look somewhat like a long tube. A corridor, if you will. And the whole corridor is emitting *space* right now, we just happen to be situated at the end point of the corridor, that's why we can detect it at all, so no, it should not hurt us."" He pondered the question a little more and added, ""At least not in a way we could do something about.""

""Sounds very reassuring, thank you.""

Ignoring this rather sarcastic remark by Jason, the Main Engineer continued questioning. ""Okay… so what information we're hitting Terry with today when he wakes up?""

""Tell him that-"" he was denied the chance to finish the sentence, as the probe finally hit the center of an anomaly. Everyone in the room focused on the main screen only to find it filled with static. The little window allocated for the accelerometer's graph proudly displayed a flat line, resting at zero. First seismometer, however, made himself a star of the show, having registered a huge spike of force.

""What in the ever-living 'ell! Did ya see dis shite? Divit, the fock was that?""

""The probe breached the surface of the corridor,"" the man replied, keeping an eye on the main screen - ""now it is in a bubble. Seems like it was badly damaged by the tidal forces.""

""Where the fock did it go?! 'Twas there a moment ago!"" Allan exclaimed, examining the footage from a station's point of view on a second screen. ""You said it would come out from the other side just fine!"" On one frame the probe was still there, and on the other it was already not. Jason just leaned closer to the screens.

""Although now that I think of it, these could very well be not tidal forces, but most probably a problem caused by a length contraction after passing through a high space density area with one end and not the other,"" Divit continued, scratching his chin. Lacking opportunity to shave properly for a couple of weeks has taken its toll. His thin beard was forming once again. ""Like in some kind of a ladder pa-""

""The probe is still broadcasting data. It means it is still operational to a certain degree, right?""

""Shite, you're right! Quick, what can we-"" - the part of the screen displaying readings from the last functioning sensor went blank, after erupting with an enormous spike of data - ""-do…""

""Rest in pieces, Carnus. You were a great probe and got smashed for a greater cause.""

""Golly gee willikers.""

""Pice of shite!""

Index finger with a well-groomed fingernail lightly tapped the shoulder of the sleeping figure. ""Excuse me, Captain, I did not want to wake you up like this, but it appears we have guests and said guests have news, although I am not one hundred percent sure what kind of news these are.""

The previously addressed man attempted to stand up, pulling himself out of the half-closed sleeping bag. ""Who? Whozzat? Who the hell is there?"" he grunted, struggling to do so, as the newcomers stepped into the tightly packed room.

""Allan,""- Michael greeted the Main Engineer, acknowledging his presence with a nod - ""Divit, Jason,"" - he repeated the procedure - ""to what do we owe the visit? I must inform you that the Captain might currently be… *a bit light in the head*, for the lack of a better word, due to poor sleep he experienced, so I would kindly ask you to express yourselves in simpler terms.""

Allan was about to speak when the Captain pushed himself up and proclaimed in his booming voice, ""Thank you for your concern, Michael, but I'm totally fine. And I can speak for me'self."" He then turned his head towards newcomers. ""So? Spill it.""

""Terry, sit down, please."" Captain hesitated momentarily before looking at the doctor beside him, who returned the look with a reassuring nod. ""Carnus is gone, Terry. We've sent it straight into the thing.""

""You… You what?"" he asked not so much to make sure he did not mishear anything, as to have a bit more time to unravel the huge implications behind said words in the small operational space of his now dizzy head. ""YOU WHAT?!"" the man roared, coming to senses in an instant, springing back up. Weak gravity of the fourth Galilean satellite could not handle his might, and the Captain soon found himself rapidly approaching the room's floor. He, however, was caught by Michael's sinewy, yet strong arm halfway through the fall. The latter gently pushed him back onto the bed. Maybe it would have been a great laughing matter for everybody in the room if not for the situation.

Without lifting his arm from the Captain's shoulder Michael said, ""Terry, for the love of everything, calm down. Rushed decisions are just about the last thing we need in such a crucial moment like this.""

Allan decided not to wait for the next outburst. ""The probe has crashed into something. And I for the life of it cannot imagine anything that can fit the description this fine gentleman gave us. I believe he can explain the whole situation to you better than any of us."" With that being said, the engineer pushed the young scientist forward. ""Fire away, lad.""

Divit swallowed hard, looking at the Captain's red face, shifting his eyes towards the doctor, however, he was met with a seemingly emotionless face. In the eyes, however, he noticed traces of a keen interest. Noticing the astrophysicist's hesitation, Michael subtly frowned in return. ""You are planning on keeping us waiting for how long, exactly?""

""So… All I can say is that it is *not* a natural object. That's for certain."" He trailed off, unsure what to say next, following it with a nervous chuckle.

""That's it? You wrecked a multi-billion piece of equipment to find out that anomaly is indeed fucking anomalous?"" the Captain asked, his breath catching.

""N-no, not really."" He closed his eyes and took a deep breath before continuing, weighing the words he was about to let out of his mouth. ""I believe it to be an artificial object of extraterrestrial origin. In other words, *made* by someone intelligent.""

For a solid ten seconds the sounds filling the room were limited to a soothing hum of electro-magnetic field generators, as everyone in the room tried to fully comprehend these words. The silence was disrupted by a heavy breathing of Captain Terry Rheinland, as he locked his eyes with Divit's. ""Bullshit. You gotta be fucking kidding me. It's a prank. Another one of your stupid jokes about aliens once again."" No response. Everybody turned to look at their Captain, awaiting a command. ""Well, that's it,"" he said, addressing no one in particular and closed his eyes. The whole world was spinning. Blood rushed in his ears. He took a deep breath summoning a Herculean amount of willpower, counted to ten in his head and opened his eyes. ""To the main hall. And call the girls.""

1ly0nii,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoweredByExperience/comments/1ly0nii/explore_best_espresso_machine_nespresso_pixie/,Explore Best Espresso Machine Nespresso Pixie Worth Buying or Not,"The Nespresso Pixie Espresso Machine EN127BL quickly became the centerpiece of my mornings. This little powerhouse fits right into my compact kitchen, and honestly, it feels like it was designed just for spaces like mine. With its sleek navy blue exterior, hammered metal sides, and solid steel handle, it adds this modern-industrial vibe that any minimalist would appreciate. It’s not just about looks, though; the build quality whispers durability every time I close the lid. 

The two-button system is a minimalist's dream—it brews either espresso or lungo with just a quick press. Operating at 19-bar pump pressure, every cup feels like a coffee shop experience without me having to leave the house. It heats up ridiculously quickly—30 seconds to boiling water? That’s faster than my patience for waiting! I tested it with a range of Nespresso-compatible capsules, and each time, the flavor was consistently rich and aromatic. Coffee aficionados, take note: this machine delivers a punch.  

**Upsides**

- Brews Espresso and Lungo with ease.
- Built to last with high-quality construction.
- Compact size fits seamlessly in small kitchens.
- 19-bar pressure ensures barista-quality coffee.
- Energy-saving mode shuts it down automatically.  

[Find the best price for Nespresso Pixie Espresso Machine EN127BL on Amazon.](https://techieupdate.com/p/b0djg16y9s/)  

**Drawbacks**

- Doesn’t accommodate larger cups due to its compact design.
- The water reservoir, while adequate, needs frequent refilling for heavy users.
- Slightly loud while brewing (though it doesn’t bother me much).  

The semi-automatic operation mode means you still feel somewhat involved in the brewing process. However, it’s practically foolproof—I got my cousin, who usually struggles with any gadget more complex than a spoon, to use it flawlessly. What caught my attention is the descale warning system, a subtle yet vital feature that ensures the machine’s longevity and my coffee’s taste consistency. 

Compared to other products like Keurig single-serve brewers or Breville espresso machines, the Nespresso Pixie excels in espresso flavor depth. Keurig might give you a wider range of coffee options, but if an authentic espresso shot matters to you, the 19-bar pressure here simply outshines. Breville machines, on the other hand, often require more counter space and skill to operate, making the Pixie a winner for the everyday, time-conscious user.  

**Price Performance**

Assessing its price-to-quality ratio, it’s clear that the Pixie is geared towards those who value quality over sheer quantity. While it may come at a slightly higher cost compared to generic coffee makers, the consistently excellent output and sleek aesthetic make it worth the investment. Beyond taste, there’s the convenience to factor in—it’s a tiny robot barista right on my counter.

Please help me survive this ungodly UK heat. If you’re also in the UK, commiserations.

I’m 28 and from the UK. Like a lot of us on here, looking to find a connection that flows. Something you actually look forward to. Rare, but not impossible.



Love story telling in all its forms, but especially reading. Escaping into another world, yes please. Currently reading a bit of a guilty pleasure genre. Still fun though. You can ask what it is if you’re feeling brave. Or guess. Bonus points if you’ve got your own guilty pleasure read, or watch, or playlist to swap.



I keep telling myself I’ll get back to my other love, history, but so far it’s mostly the band Sabaton keeping the dream alive. I’m seeing them live later this year, which is proof I still love history, even if it’s in a slightly unconventional way. If you’re into bands with historical flair or just like great live music, I’d definitely recommend them.



I’ve also caught the running bug. Help! Got into it on a whim, became even more obsessed after my first race, and now I’m deep in the running cult. I’m not above posting my Strava stats on Insta, but I’m definitely not cool enough for the curated fitness reel life. The meditative state during a good run, the post-race high, and a good coffee or pint after — all part of the running experience I happily subscribe to.



As a self-confessed member of the totally not running cult, I feel like you should reciprocate the baring of my soul. Which one are you part of? 🤣



Now that I’ve rambled like I’m surviving on very little sleep and too much caffeine, (cough cough,) both true, it’s only fair you tell me about yourself. What’s your thing? What’s the hobby or obsession you’d like me to get into?



Honestly, I just enjoy getting to know people. The deep stuff, the dumb stuff, all the in-between. I’m into tangents, chats that spiral in the best way, and before you know it, we've landed somewhere unexpectedly lovely. Basically, the kind of connection that actually feels like something worth seeing through.



Got a book that’ll hit me in the best way? A running tip that doesn’t involve buying yet another pair of shoes? I’m listening.

I ended up waking up this morning and looked and saw my medical alarm was due to go off in 6 mins, so I got up took care of the medical situation because I knew if the alarm went off it would wake her up and she wouldnt be able to go back to sleep. 

I knew we had plans at 11 and knew we would need to leave around 1030, so to be nice and surprise her when she gets up I would have breakfast for her, nothing major but enough to hold us over until 11. So I went and picked up breakfast and came back home.

She was up, no biggie she is normally a very early bird. I greeted her and said I got us some breakfast. I was met with such hatred upon my return. ""Why the fuck did you leave, gald to see it wasn't emergency, I'm going back to bed; we have stuff here you could eat and when i wake up i make myself coffee and sit here""

I want to be clear I disaled the alarm before I left and did not leave through the kitchen or garage as not to wake her. And yes she normally gets up around 6 on the weekends and drinks a cup of coffee. However her coffee making abilities involves her slamming every cabinet and drawer shut and I never complain and it normally wakes me up and I just getup and join the family.

It's literally more easy to mix this protein in water than to mix horlicks.. you can do it with spoon or use shaker for 1-3 seconds.
Cons: tasted pretty shit in overnight oats ( could be my fault, I made it first time) 

Pretty expensive....

to describe what I feel for you?
Maybe the word love is too grand,
too fast — but it felt right.

I’m not even sure sometimes.
It feels like I’m floating somewhere
between liking the real you
and liking every version of you —
even the version you haven’t become yet.

But maybe...
maybe we can safely call it love.

Because I didn’t fall in love with you all at once.
It was slow.
Subtle.
Like warm sunlight through half-closed blinds.
Like a favorite song I didn’t even realize was playing
until I caught myself humming it.

I didn’t love you
because you were perfect,
or because you made promises,
or because you fit some checklist.

I loved you
because even in your chaos,
you made me feel calm.
You made me feel heard.
You made me feel seen.
You made me feel wanted.
You made me feel like
you knew me more than I knew myself.

I loved you
in the way I remembered
how you sometimes don't like coffee
but drink it anyway.
In the way I stayed up late
just in case you had something random to say
before you knocked out.

I loved you
through your walls.
Through your sarcasm.
Through your silence.
Through your brokenness,
your gentleness,
your softness,
your kindness.

You didn’t ask me to stay.
But you never really asked me to leave either.

So I did what I always do —
I stayed.
In the in-between.

Because I wasn’t here to demand.
Or to beg.
Or to win.

I was just here —
loving you
quietly,
gently,
steadily —

like someone rooting for their favorite person
without needing to be front row.
Like planting a flower
and tending to it
without asking it to bloom for me.

I was never the loud kind of love.
But I was the steady kind.

The kind who listens
when you don’t talk.
Who stays,
even when it hurts a little.
Even when you avoid me.
Even when you weren’t always honest with me.
Even when I’m unsure
if I’ll still have you tomorrow.

The kind who cheers you on,
even when I know
your finish line isn’t me.

Maybe someday,
you’ll look at me
and realize someone loves you this way.
Someone who roots for you
in the quietness of things.
Someone who still chooses you
without needing to be chosen back.

You may not remember all the words I said —
but I hope you feel it.
I hope you remember
how good and safe it feels
to be understood by me.
To be heard by me.
To be seen by me.
With no expectations.

That is me.

Quiet and steady.
Still here.
Still loving.
Still yours —

The melody on my lips faded as a frown lighted momentarily on the old visage. Breakfast, preferably a long leisurely affair, with mountains of bacons and eggs, the odd kipper, and a plentiful supply of coffee, is what makes Bertram the man he is. After a night out, the thought of receiving visitors before breakfast makes the mind boggle. But, then I heard Jeeves' voice - calm measured and soothing, filter through the shower curtains, no doubt warning the visitor off, and the tune returned to my lips.

When I stepped out of the bath, towel wrapped around the torso, feeling that God was in his heaven and all was right with the world, a cough awoke me from my musical dreams. 

""Yes, Jeeves?"" I asked, steeling myself for the daily debate on the choice of the morning beverage. 

""I am afraid, sir"", he said with an apologetic look, ""that you have a visitor."" ""Lord Proudfoot is in the drawing room. I regret to state that he wishes to meet you at once."" I brushed off the man. ""I never see anyone before breakfast. One might make an exception for a prime minister or a Pope, but Proudfoot belongs to neither category."" I mentally made the note that Proudfoot was a silly ass, a blot on the Drones club book.

I reached out a long hand for the coffee, while pulling on a dressing gown. The last night, while long, late and satisfying, had taken a toll. I searched my mind for the details. The party itself was clear enough. The later part of the night was more vague, clouded so to speak. I remembered the girl in the black cocktail dress, dancing, refreshment of the liquid sort and so on. The early morning hours seemed to have vanished into thin air. A cab had deposited me on the front door and Jeeves had helped me in - a faintly disapproving eye taking in the unbuttoned shirt, the loose collar and the unsteady walk. 

As I finished buttoning my shirt, there was a loud bang on the bedroom door, and a large man burst in. Lord Proudfoot was built on a massive scale, as if Providence had desired to make (wrongly, in my opinion) several Proudfeet, and repenting, settled on one massive Proudfoot. His face was crimson and   he seemed more in need of a doctor than a pre-breakfast Bertram.

""I say, old man"", I said. ""Are you all right?""  He was incoherent in his reply, but I caught several phrases better suited to the dockyard than to the young gent's bedroom. ""His Lordship"", said Jeeves, his face looking like a stuffed fish, ""is under the impression that you spent the night in his bedroom."" I was surprised. While B Wooster has been known to spend the night in clubs and theatres and occasionally even in what my Aunt Dahlia calls houses of ill repute, the Proudfoot Old Proudfoot was becoming more coherent in his speech, perhaps fortified by the port Jeeves had wordlessly given him. ""I was at my country estate yesterday"", he spluttered. ""I arrived by an early train and found my wife in bed, clad in the flimsiest of underclothes, her black cocktail dress on the bedroom floor.” I felt compelled to remontrate with the man. ""I understand your chagrin, is that the right word Jeeves?"", i said, a trifle frostily,""with your wife's mode of dressing in bed, but I fail to see how I am concerned in the matter."" establishment is one that I give a wide berth. 

Proudfoot cursed my impertinence, adding a few select words that made me marvel at the language he had picked up in the House of Lords. ""Your tie was lying on the bedroom floor"", he said, producing a maroon Drones club tie, with 'B. W."" embroidered in it, in large golden letters. His voice took on a beastly tone of sarcasm, ""Forgot your tie, did you?"" he said, adding that he wished to wring my neck. ""I have been nowhere near your bedroom"", I said, taking a step back. He expressed the opinion that I should be hanged, before adding that shooting was too good for the likes of me. 

Just as I was assessing the distance from my position, to the open window, Jeeves coughed. “If I may intervene,” he said. His soothing voice felt like manna from the heavens. “I fear what I have to say may grieve your Lordship”, he continued, with a slightly pained air. “I am afraid that the tie was left in your bed chamber by my friend Alfred”, he finished, as though that settled matters. 
""A likely story!"" exclaimed the last of the Proudfoot clan. ""Why should your friend Alfred be in my bedroom? Bertie was once engaged to my wife"", he said, irrelevantly, I felt. I endeavoured to let him know that half the girls in London were once engaged to me. He expressed, a tad too volubly, I felt, the desire that the entire feminine population of London be dashed . “I believe that my friend Alfred has good reason to be in your house, though the propriety of his being in your bedroom is open to criticism"", said Jeeves, with a sorrowful glance. ""Your Lordship may know him better as Richards. I am given to understand that he recently entered your Lordship's employment in the capacity of gentleman's personal gentleman

Old Proudfoot seemed to deflate like a popped balloom. He sat heavily in a chair. ""I don't believe it"", he said through clenched teeth. ""He wouldn't dare..."" his voice trailed off.  Jeeves produced a receipt from his shirt pocket ""Received - three Drones club ties, purple, unused. Two pink shirts"", read the receipt. ""I am in the habit"", he continued, ""of obtaining receipts for clothes since an unfortunate situation I had to face while in the employment of the Duke of Chiskwick. I had given his Grace's old clothes to the head gardener. A few weeks later, the kitchen maid was found in the summer house, in questionable circumstance, in the company of the Duke's trousers. The Duke might have been seriously compromised, had the gardener not been found in one of the trees near in the summer house, clad only in one sock."" 

Proudfoot was at the door - subdued and silent. As the door closed behind him, I asked Jeeves, ""Isn't your friend in for a rough time once Proudfoot reaches the old family manor again?"" I took the liberty of  telephoning him immediately after his Lordship told me of the matter, while you were still in your bath. 

"" My friend, Alfred"", he continued, “while an excellent man in many ways,has a weakness for the ladies. It was following an exceedingly uncomfortable night up a tree, with the Duke's mastiff baying for his blood, that he gave up gardening and became a valet. I took the liberty of advancing him fifty pounds, for the trouble of accepting his role in the fiasco and leaving his Lordship’s service with immediate effect.” “Then who…..”, I expostulated, sweat breaking out on the old brow. He gave a discreet smile. “The simpler explanation, sir”, he said, “is often the correct one. I anticipated this incident after discovering this handkerchief in your trouser pocket last night.” He handed me a dainty bit of muslin with L. P . on it. Lydia Proudfoot.

Mix of LPR and asthma, been on 40mg esomprazole in the morning and 20mg pepcid for about a week and a half. Doctor said to stay on esomeprazole for 6 weeks, pepcid for 2 weeks only. Doctor also said its most likely silent reflux. Throat clearing has improved drastically, occasional chest tightness. Throat clearing gets the worst after carbonated drinks. Coffee with milk in the morning does very little to nothing to me.

My symptoms are weak, but strongest right when I wake up. Should I take the pepcid right before I hit the pillow? I've been taking it a few hours before bed when it's nighttime.

Why are my symptoms right when I wake up? before I drink anything.

SHould I continue drinking my coffee+milk if it doesn't flare anything up?

How long till full recovery? (Is that even possible)

edit: Would like to note my flare ups after being on esomeprazole + pepcid have gotten shorter. Throat clearing/chest tightness only lasts about 2-5 minutes. Used to last 10+

1ly092g,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1ly092g/advice_from_my_failure/,Advice From My Failure,"I want to share two crucial points that I failed to implement when I quit coffee and which eventually led me to resume coffee consumption. 

1. Do NOT go low carb and make sure you are on a healthy way of eating and at your desired weight. 

At the same time with quitting caffeine, I “cleaned up” my diet and went low carb by removing dry fruit I used to binge on in the evenings. 

Low carb diets take away energy, no matter how adjusted you think you are. I thought I was very well adjusted. I believed that low carb is how we all should eat so we stay healthy and trim. As a result I tortured myself for years on low carb. 

Removing caffeine from low carb landscape is a bad idea. Probably this is why keto people swear by their bulletproof coffee. 

There is tons of BS about how to eat to stay healthy. Now I eat high carb whole foods plant based diet, where my central dish is starch: oatmeal, rice, potatoes, even bread. Tons of veggies and fruits. No added oils. This gives tons of energy and the weight I gained on low carb high fat diet is finally melting away. 

Yes, I restarted coffee due to weight gain and total depletion of energy, but I do think I might quit caffeine again once I restore my health, get down to my ideal weight (125). I may approach it in October. I have already heard quite a few comments from people who eat like me that they naturally discovered that they do not need coffee anymore. 

2. Know your reason to quit. 

Quitting caffeine like me on advice from someone else just to see what happens is not good enough. I never truly noted why I wanted to quit coffee. The desire to quit was not born inside of me. Instead I used outside instruction. If you do this, it is just a matter of time when you ask yourself “why on Earth I think that person was right?” 

However if you know your reasons, you are equipped much better. Also, have the list of what you will be sacrificing by quitting. To me these two lists look like that currently: 

Pros to Quit:
1. Better sleep
2. Potentially unnecessary food item

Cons to Quit:
1. I love my morning coffee
2. I hate teas, so I will need to accept that the only liquid I will be consuming is water. It is not easy for me. 
3. Losing a go-to comfort break during trips, conferences, etc. 
4. Coffee revs up my metabolic rate. 

In order to move to caffeine free life for me is important to be in a great physical and energetic shape, so I could accommodate the loss of boost. I also need to work on my lists of pros and cons. Going to the ideal weight and developing a more muscular and more agile body will tackle the need for boost in metabolism. Working on picturing myself drinking only water and finding it to be meditative, desirable, spa-like, I would be able to tackle another con I currently have.

We're not just talking minor updates here—these are blockbuster collaborations and acquisitions that could redefine the very essence of what it means to operate a modern enterprise. We're looking at you, Accenture and Microsoft, with your AI-powered cybersecurity solutions that might just put traditional security teams out of a job. It's okay, they'll be teaching AI how to outsmart AI in no time.

In case you're wondering if AI has grown a bit of a backbone, Capgemini's $3.3 billion acquisition of WNS aims to fortify their position as a global AI dominance powerhouse. And let's not forget Cerebras, which is not-so-quietly launching Qwen3-235B, a model that's supposed to be the Usain Bolt of AI reasoning, leaving other models gasping in its 131,000-token dust. Meanwhile, Cloudian is out there simplifying AI infrastructure with a new platform that promises to make enterprise IT nerds as happy as a cat in a sunbeam.

Then there's the real meat of AI chaos—a whopping 97% of IT leaders are freaking out about ""shadow AI,"" those rogue unauthorised tools infiltrating their systems. But guess what? 91% of employees think the risks are a tiny price to pay for the innovation these tools offer. Clearly, perception is everything when it comes to risks versus rewards in AI usage.

In a world where SambaNova casually introduces a turnkey AI inference solution that sets up faster than your Ikea bookcase, the heart of the issue isn't just the technology—it's how we humans adapt to wield these digital leviathans. Will businesses maintain their cultural identity when AI starts running the show? Are we ready to redefine the workplace as AI agents take over traditional roles?

So, here’s the lingering thought: As AI muscles its way into every crevice of modern enterprise, what's the role of human intuition and creativity in the face of machine efficiency? Who knows, maybe one day we'll find AI agents trading stories over water coolers—or wherever AI agents hang out.

Imagine your web browser booking your vacation while you sip coffee. Sounds futuristic? According to a Reuters report, that's what OpenAI plans to deliver with its new AI-powered browser. Think Google Chrome, but with a twist—an AI that acts as your personal assistant, ready to book flights or fill out forms. Utah’s Office of AI director, Dr. Zach Boyd, isn't surprised. ""It’s inevitable,"" he says. ""AI is set to become our digital Swiss Army knife.""

**The AI Advantage and the Inevitable Learning Curve**

Unlike traditional calculators, AI isn’t infallible. ""Expect hiccups,"" Boyd warns. Imagine booking a Paris, France vacation and finding yourself in Paris, Arkansas. Yikes! Yet, the potential is vast. From healthier ad revenue (bye-bye, Google) to valuable data collection, OpenAI is geared up to reshape internet browsing dynamics.

**Regulation and Privacy: Treading Carefully**

Control over data is power, and OpenAI knows it. While the browser promises elevated personal assistance, it also raises privacy concerns. Boyd states, ""Utah's paving the path for AI regulations aiming to balance innovation with consumer protection."" So, will AI-driven browsers become the norm?

From the first brew to the tenth cup of the week, this sleek, glossy black coffee maker has become an integral part of my morning routine. It offers versatility with both hot and iced brewing options and compatibility with K-cups and ground coffee, but as with any product, it has its strengths and areas where it falls short.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The modern and minimalist design caught my eye immediately. Its compact dimensions (11.46"" D x 11.93"" W x 5.28"" H) make it space-efficient on my countertop, even in my relatively cramped kitchen. The glossy black finish gives it a premium feel, but fingerprints and smudges can become visible pretty quickly if you're not careful. Despite its lightweight frame of just over 4.8 pounds, it feels sturdy, and the removable tank feature is a great touch—it makes refilling and cleaning the coffee maker incredibly convenient.

**Ease of Use and Features**  
Using this coffee maker is straightforward, as it is fully automatic in its operation mode. I like how user-friendly it is. The SHARDOR KM-802B offers three-in-one compatibility for K-cups, ground coffee, and even tea, making it versatile for all members of the household. The reusable filter is an excellent feature, saving me money on disposable pods and reducing environmental impact. Operating it barely takes more than a minute for a fresh brew, which is a lifesaver during my rushed mornings. 

[Discover if SHARDOR KM-802B is on sale at Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0drfzq8cn/)

**Taste and Performance**  
This coffee maker offers a strength selection option, letting you choose between a standard or stronger brew. Personally, I experimented with both and found that the bold setting enhances the richness in a way that's perfect for iced coffee iterations. It caters to brewing capacities of 6, 8, 10, 12, or 14 ounces, a flexible range that works whether I'm brewing for myself or my partner. The results are consistent, with no bitter aftertaste—something I've noticed in cheaper alternatives before. However, I've had issues on occasion where the machine would sputter slightly with larger 14-ounce brews. That said, these incidents were rare.

**Energy Efficiency and Maintenance**  
One of its more practical features is the energy-saving auto-off function. The coffee maker shuts itself off five minutes after brewing, which is reassuring when you're juggling multiple tasks (and sometimes forget to power it down). Maintenance is relatively low-effort; the removable drip tray and water reservoir make cleaning a breeze. Moreover, the machine easily accommodates my 6.8"" travel mug, which is not something every single-serve brewer can promise. Still, I did notice that the reusable filter can be a bit finicky to clean out entirely, especially if you're using finely ground coffee.

**Highlights**  
- Compact and space-efficient with a sleek, modern design.  
- Strength selection function for personalized brews.  
- Compatible with K-cups, ground coffee, and tea.  
- Removable water tank and drip tray for easy cleaning.  
- Energy-saving auto-off feature enhances efficiency.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The glossy black finish easily collects fingerprints.  
- Occasional sputtering during larger brews.  
- Reusable filter can be challenging to clean thoroughly.

**Market Rivals**  
Comparing it to brands like Keurig or Hamilton Beach, I found the SHARDOR KM-802B excels in providing a more budget-friendly option for single-serve brewing. Keurig may dominate the market with sleek aesthetics and additional features, but the SHARDOR wins in its three-in-one compatibility. Additionally, it performs faster than most Hamilton Beach products I’ve tested, which tend to take a bit longer for single servings. On the downside, the SHARDOR's fingerprint-prone surface and occasional sputtering put it a notch below these competitors in terms of reliability. However, in terms of energy-saving features and ease of cleaning, it holds its own among its peers.

**Affordable Quality**  
Despite its minor drawbacks, this coffee maker punches above its weight in value. It's not a luxury espresso machine by a long shot, but considering its flexibility, ease of use, and the flavor it delivers, it's a worthy contender for budget-conscious buyers. It offers much of what more expensive options would provide, doing so effectively without breaking the bank. If all you're after is a reliable coffee companion capable of preparing hot and iced drinks quickly, this machine will suit you well.

1ly02gk,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamersupps/comments/1ly02gk/how_many_scoops_is_too_much/,How many scoops is too much ?,"So I got my order a couple days ago and yesterday I finally decided to take them. I, obviously, started with the sample packages. In my rush to taste them I didn’t really read the back of the package and just put all the pack in my new and beautiful Russian Badger cup, poured water until the cup was full and shaked it  until I couldn’t see the dust. Then drank it. I really liked it and finished the first cup in like 5 minutes. I realised I probably will need a new dose so I poured a different sample pack (it was lemonade or something) wasn’t the biggest fan of it but still liked it and drank it whole. After about one hour I opened the next sample (Brand Risk) ,which I really love actually and ordered a full 100 servings of, and also drank it in like 15 minutes. And since I was weirdly thirsty I just filled one more cup with the last sample pack. 

Anyway. After finishing the sample packs and deciding that I will order the Brand Risk one, I finally opened my Guacamole Gamer Fart 900 bottle of 100 servings. I wasn’t sure how many to take but the instructions mentioned 1 scoop for every 250ml of water. So I of course put 4 scoops in the cup cause I never believe instructions and was sure it wouldn’t be enough. 

After drinking half the bottle I poured more water cause that shit was very intense but good. After finishing said cup as well I couldn’t help but notice my hand felt very itchy and I was feeling like a lot of energy going through me. 

It was at this point I remembered “ah, right this contains caffeine.” So I checked the package and found the “do not exceed 4 servings daily”. In my mind I was like, “Ah, oh well I’m sure I’ll be fine. I only drank these 4 and the 4 packs which must have been like what, 1 scoop each ?”. 

Anyway the sample packs have 2 servings so I had drank 12 servings by 7pm. I couldn’t sleep last night, crazy, I wonder why. 

Anyway, after seeing it’s 5am and I had to wake up soon to get work cause of course I took the Saturday shift I decided “I’m need coffee… wait, I’m sure I could take some more GS.” So I took the box with me and drank 6 more scoops. 

Anyway, should I be worried ?",0,1752325717.0,gamersupps,9,0.4,False

1lxzzao,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lxzzao,I built a food analysis app to fix my diet after years of binge eating,"Hey SideProject Redditors! I wanted to share my side project that turned into something deeply personal for me. For years, I struggled with terrible eating habits. I was living on autopilot, thinking my diet was “fine” because it looked like what everyone else around me ate. In reality, I was binge eating family-sized bags of chips in bed, gaining weight rapidly, and blaming it all on stress and anxiety.

One day, my doctor gave me a harsh wake-up call. She told me I was on track for serious health issues if I didn’t change immediately. That was the day everything shifted.

I spent months learning about nutrition, then went on to study it properly, but what helped me most was building a tool that gave me clarity without the overwhelm. I created **MealSnap**, an iOS app that uses AI to analyse meals instantly, giving a health rating, NOVA food processing score, and clear suggestions to improve each meal.

The goal was simple: stop obsessing over calories alone and build true awareness of what I was eating. Over time, it became my daily habit and helped me get back to a healthy weight while feeling energised and in control for the first time in my life. Here’s the app (if you’re curious) [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mealsnap-ai-food-log-tracker/id6475162854](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mealsnap-ai-food-log-tracker/id6475162854) 

I’d love your feedback – I built it as a side project for myself at first, but it’s now helping hundreds of others too. If you’re building a health or nutrition side project, I’m happy to share what worked technically and UX-wise too :)

I’ve suffered from migraines since I was a teenager, but 2-3 years ago they progressed into chronic migraines along with worsening sciatica (couldn’t walk for periods, and relied on a walking stick a lot of the time when I could walk).
I changed my diet. I stopped eating “processed” food all together (junk food really), and concentrated on whole foods and high protein and fibre. I still drink coffee because I know lack of caffeine is a trigger for me.
I joined the gym and started lifting weights and made sure I hit my steps. I started this during a period where the sciatica had calmed down, and it seems to have massively helped that too.
I’m not sure if it’s a coincidence or if improving my general health has had that much of an impact, but it’s a simple thing to try and see if it helps. It’s been 4 weeks, and while my hormonal migraines are sticking around, I’ve only had one other migraine day. I was having migraines nearly every day previous to this.
The doctors haven’t been able to help as much as this has, all the medications gave me side effects with no relief so it feels like they’ve given up (still waiting on that brain scan…). I do think the sciatica and migraines are connected so it may not help everyone depending on the cause, but I feel like I’m getting my life back, so couldn’t not share just in case it helps one person who is in the same position.",7,1752325392.0,migraine,1,0.89,False

I am on a sit that has been a challenge for me cleanliness wise. There are several reviews giving five stars in all categories including cleanliness, and the issues are in areas that weren’t apparent from video call nor posting (it looks very clean in the listing photos- I double checked). Maybe they were in a rush and didn’t have time to deep clean before I arrived? 
There was a nail clipping on the counter next to the desk, and a flossing pick stick thing on the floor under the desk, along with popcorn kernels. There are a ton of crumbs in the silverware holder. They left coffee grounds in some sort of accessory I didn’t use and I had to clean it out because mold had formed. There are many sticky oozings in the fridge. I accidentally pulled out a freezer drawer and there is a buffet of dog hair, crumbs, and what looks like kibble under there. The bathtub has a book stand thing that is covered in what I’m guessing is mildew. I was warned that it’s impossible to keep up with the dog shedding but it should have been cleaned out of the drawers where they keep crockery at least. the bathroom is seemingly under a bit of renovation that was cropped out of the photos and everything on the floor or behind the toilet is covered in dog hair and dust.
I know we shouldn’t expect hotel quality clean, but it has been uncomfortable and I really haven’t had the time or energy to do a deep clean. I cleaned as best as I could because I don’t want them getting back and thinking I had left the nail clipping or floss stick around and I think they probably didn’t notice the state of their house and might assume it’s my doing. I want to be honest to warn others, but I don’t want to kick off a nasty reply or keep others from wanting to do the sit.

As you can see, I use a gallon sized zip lock to store my ""open"" creamer. We have ants, easily, so we container everything, even if it might seem a bit redundant. The little bits of creamer dust you can't always see will attract them at times.

The bag has worked for the last year plus--but I hate it. It's bulky, and if the creamer is half empty, the extra baggage makes it sit uneven (causing it to want to fall over). Pulling things out next to it (the coffee) it's annoying to constantly push it over with one hand while trying to grab the thing with the other.

I thought this morning ""I bet a container could be 3D printed for these odd shaped things.."".

I don't own a caliper tool, but the measurements in the picture are slightly larger than the bottle, so it wouldn't be a ""snug"" pod like hold by any means, but it would fit Walmarts and Krogers creamer bottles easily. 8⅞"" tall, 3"" wide. 

If you HAVE a caliper tool and would want to make it more precise and snuggly, I wouldn't be upset by that, but I imagine it would make the design more difficult.

Over my life I’ve worked 9 different jobs, had a happy childhood, good education, all 4 grandparents lived into my adulthood. I’ve earned over £200,000/year at one point, and I’ve also been completely broke, unable to afford healthy food or accommodation. I’m one of the rare people who has gone from bottom 1% (from a relatively poor family, I worked from age 12), to top 1% (self earned) to bottom 1% again (something very rare on this earth to happen to people)… lost everything I had, not through laziness or irresponsibility, but through being a victim of crime & not protected by “the system”. I’ve seen the extremes from many angles & here’s what I’ve learned:

* **“Money can’t buy happiness” is a false motto perpetuated by the elite to keep the poor under control:** the freedom it gives you to rest, eat healthy, pursue purpose, spend time with family, and *not* work yourself into the ground. Anyone saying “money doesn’t buy happiness” has never been truly rich or truly poor, or just doesn’t know better.
* **Almost all relationships are conditional.** The only people who seemingly truly loved me were my grandparents on one side (I say this in hindsight). When I had money, a home, charisma, “young energy”, looks, finances and plenty to offer, I had lots of people wanting to be around me. But when I lost everything including my age (I got older, lost my looks), they ALL vanished. Including my own parents, siblings, literally everyone. All I had left was my love but that isn’t enough to keep people around you. People want entertainment, resources, or benefits. If I wasn't useful to them in some way, I was forgotten. I’d literally go for months without a single phone call from parents.
* **Even close family love is transactional.** My parents… once I hit my late 30s.. made it clear they weren’t willing to catch me when I fell (for the first time in my life, I might add). After I lost everything, they wouldn’t even let me stay in their huge home with plenty of space, to get back on my feet. My dad literally paid me £400 to hire a car to sleep in. They live in a 4-bed house. It was such a shock to realise the “family support” you always think is there actually isn’t.
* **My grandparents, from the WWII generation, would never have done this.** Their door was always open, even when they had very little. My parents, raised with love and stability, can’t relate to what it’s like to have no options, no safety net. They’re grandfathered into the system in a house they could never afford today, they only show love to my siblings who have kids.. because they get something in return (grandkids).
* **The ""self-made millionaire"" myth is mostly timing, luck, family you’re born into, & elite access.** I’ve known many wealthy people. Also been in top 1% myself… but I can tell you something no one does: most built their careers before over saturation… in the early internet days or earlier. Today, following their advice doesn’t work the same way. They were “grandfathered in” as markets weren’t oversaturated and were they told to repeat their success today, they wouldn’t be able to - yet they’re walking around giving advice to young people nowadays who think they know what they’re talking about.
* **“Rely on yourself” is another myth:** That’s what hit me even “just rely on yourself” only works if you’re healthy. And when you're not, you're on your own. I almost died because I couldn’t get out of bed for weeks, I was so unwell. No one took care of me. Literally people didn’t care. NHS told me they don’t have enough ambulances (and were so rude on the phone that you realise you’d rather die alone in your own nice company than surrounded by hateful people in a hospital who don’t like or care about you)
* **People love to tell others what to do, but can’t follow their own advice.** Especially the wealthy. They’ll tell you to “just hustle” while living off family wealth or early investments that no longer exist… they couldn’t do what they’re advising others to do…
* **Love is more valuable than money (but much rarer and only if u have enough money to live!).** I’ve seen people with so little (like my grandparents), but overflowing with love… I’ve also seen people who had everything financially yet still treated one of their own children like a stranger (like mine)… 
* **Western culture is emotionally dead.** I've travelled widely around the world. In other parts of the world.. in poverty… they’re way better off than we are in the west, without realising it… people share tiny flats, cook together, love each other. Here, people plan a coffee & chat months in advance... then cancel. There's waaay more loneliness in a UK suburb than in a crowded flat in the Middle East. I know which I’d rather choose… but having said that,  I’ve been in a middle eastern family (partner’s family) who showed me more love than I ever received from my own family yet it turned out to be fake as they abandoned me the moment that relationship ended (and this was after telling me I’m like their son)…
* **The people who are most rejected are the ones who care the most..** I am. I’ve learnt to value family, connection, kindness… yet I’ve ended up with none. Perhaps that’s why I’ve learnt it matters most. 
* I’ve got zero love, no real friends. I crave realness and can’t stand fake anymore. The time I lost everything and everyone of my friends & family disappeared made me realise I’d rather be alone than around fakeness.
* I go months or years without any family calling me. I once stopped calling to see what would happen (I heard nothing for 8 months), until they needed something…
* **Some people are born into overflowing love and don’t even appreciate it (like my parents). Others are starved of it and would give anything for a hug or a just a 10 min conversation.**  
* Last point: Most ignored who speak out about this are largely ignored again. This post will likely get buried.

I wish I had known how cold things can become after 35. I would have built more loving relationships earlier.. no one told me. 

I assumed love would always be there. I’m sharing this because if even one person reading this is in their 20s or 30s….. *don’t assume your family will always be there.* 

Build love consciously, with a family who actually cares. Have children if you can, but know that even they can abandon you if they choose to (I’ve seen this happen to the least deserving)..

And if you’re someone with love in your life, please don’t take it for granted. You may not have visibility of people like me, but believe me, we exist. I’m here as proof of it.",198,1752324284.0,Life,59,0.94,False
1lxzk92,https://v.redd.it/in3g88x5ufcf1,Lore in OmniStat Recording,"So, when I was playing Catalyst, I found these audio tapes about a group of KSEC officers finding OmniStat-branded gold in the tunnels beneath Rezoning. But in the 4th tape (shown above), they mention their retirement plans.

One of them says that if the squad leader retires he would just end up living out on some rural property in the Greylands, sipping his coffee and waiting to die. Now, does this mean that the Greylands aren't as bad as we've been led to believe. Now, the Greylands are probably still post-apocalyptic wastelands in some parts, but is it plausible that the Greylands still contains forests and is still relatively-hospitable for human life.

On another note, one of the officers mentions Saint Peter, now Catalyst is set far in the future after a global war and an environmental collapse.

I used to think all these dating apps were just failed concepts masquerading as tech solutions to loneliness, ya know? 😂 But there I was, swiping through an endless sea of shirtless selfies and bizarre bios (who knew liking pineapple pizza was such a deal breaker?), when I matched with this guy.  

I was ready for the usual awkward small talk, but to my surprise, our convo turned into this super interesting chat about our mutual love for cheesy retro sci-fi movies. Honestly, I was half expecting him to ghost me, but plot twist: we actually kept chatting! 

A few messages in, he suggested meeting up at this nostalgic-themed café. Tbh, I went in with zero expectations—thinking hey, at least I'll get some decent coffee, if nothing else. But we hit it off like long-lost nerdy friends reunited by the gods of the algorithm! We caught ourselves laughing-to-tears discussing the absurdity of our past dates and geeking out over the lamest sci-fi tropes...

Fast forward a few meetups and we're not only regulars at that café but are firmly established platonic movie buddies. It's kinda wild, right?

Primarily interested in women (cis & trans) romantically at this time, but open to friends of all stripes 💖

Messy craft rooms, overgrown gardens, and beaches just after a storm are my favorite spaces. I am a huge kid at heart, and I’m happy to listen about all of your new favorite fandoms and hyper-niche hobbies.

I’m very happily married with an additional long term partner.  I absolutely gush about my partners, and we will get on well if you do the same.

Politically I am progressive, and we probably won’t get on well as partners if you’re the exact opposite.

Happy to discuss all things fun and kinky since they are very important to me.

On the physical side, I’m 5’10”, US size 18 with a style that is a mix of fluffy skirts, corsets, and So. Much. Glitter. I can also be frequently found in bikinis and biker shorts because balance is everything. 

I’d love to find new poly friends or a potential partner somewhat locally to Tampa. I currently live in Tampa around half the month, and will be here full time by next year. Someone to binge watch horror movies, go on tea dates, and gush about the latest shark research or retro games. Bonus points for someone that can easily switch between laughing hysterically, steamy situations, and deep discussions.

I do prefer someone who likes to spoil and be spoiled in their relationships in various ways. Someone who enjoys texting daily, sharing all the sides of their life, and experiencing something new is definitely going on my dance card.

If this sounds like what you’re looking for, send me a DM with one of your interests that you can just drone on for days about.

To be up front, I don’t really respond to messages that just say “hi” and I’d love to meet up for coffee within a month of chatting.

Sharing my positive experience with the HSG in case it helps calm someone's nerves. I just had mine done a few minutes ago, and I was anticipating a lot of pain per others' experiences I've read about on here. For me, the pain never came and the whole thing was over in about 1 minute. It was less uncomfortable than my IUD removal.

I prepared by taking 800 mg of Ibuprofen AND 1000 mg of Tylenol 1.5 hours beforehand AND drinking a cold brew coffee on the way there. (It is well established that caffeine reduces sensitivity to pain, especially when combined with OTC pain relievers.) I also hyped myself up with confidence boosting music and affirmations beforehand and did breathing exercises during the procedure.

The doctor said my tubes were clear, which likely correlated to less pain during the procedure. I've also previously given birth vaginally after induction with a balloon catheter. Not sure if this contributed to an easier experience or not.

We advocate and care for them daily. We provide everything they need, physically and mentally. We evaluate how they might be feeling, anticipate their future needs,
relish our time with them. The responsibilities is great, yet we wouldn’t have it any other way. The final gift is letting them be healthy, happy dogs again, the dog we met and fell in love with. The void is vast, expectedly so, when they leave us. But we can know we had something very special that not everyone commits to. We gained a best friend, maybe our closest friend in life.

Food poisoning \~9 months ago, constant vomiting for 10 days. allergic reaction to cat \~3 months ago. History of asthma as a child, turns out have a strong allergy to cats (did prick test). Recent blood test shows high immunoglobin e count. Healthy otherwise.

Mix of LPR and asthma, been on 40mg esomprazole in the morning and 20mg pepcid for about a week and a half. Doctor said to stay on esomeprazole for 6 weeks, pepcid for 2 weeks only. Doctor also said its most likely silent reflux. Throat clearing has improved drastically, occasional chest tightness. Throat clearing gets the worst after carbonated drinks. Coffee with milk in the morning does very little to nothing to me.

My symptoms are weak, but strongest right when I wake up. Should I take the pepcid right before I hit the pillow? I've been taking it a few hours before bed when it's nighttime.

Why are my symptoms right when I wake up? before I drink anything.

1lxz6w0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1lxz6w0/crying_over_my_coffin_novel_my_funeral_was_quite/,Crying Over My Coffin Novel_ My funeral was quite the spectacle.,"My funeral was quite the spectacle.

A crystal coffin surrounded by white roses—my favorite flowers when I was alive.

My four brothers stood by the coffin in black suits, their faces as pale as ghosts.

At the front, my fiancé, Enoch Leblanc, stood frozen. His trembling fingers brushed the edge of the coffin. His usually indifferent eyes were now swollen and bloodshot with grief.

How ironic.

When I was alive, none of them could even be bothered to look at me. Now that I was gone, they acted like they couldn't live without me.

I hovered above them, watching with cold detachment from the ceiling. If souls could laugh, I'd be laughing my head off right now.

\*\*\*\*\*

""Erika..."" Enoch croaked, his voice hoarse. He choked out, ""I'm sorry. I...""

It was funny that he only knew he was wrong now.

I floated right in front of him. Even though I knew he couldn't hear me, I couldn't help but sneer, ""Oh, Enoch, who exactly are those crocodile tears for? Back when Denise framed me for stealing her necklace, weren't you the one who said, 'I never thought you were that kind of person'?""

Muffled sobs echoed through the funeral hall. Jayden Kline, my eldest brother, punched the wall and scratched his knuckles. He was a titan of business, but at that moment, such an invincible man like him seemed as vulnerable as a child.

""It's my fault,"" Jayden murmured. ""If only I'd listened to her back then.""

Marcus Kline, my second elder brother, stood silently in the corner and clenched something tightly in his hand.

I approached him, stunned to see it was the handcrafted leather wallet I'd given him for his birthday last year. Back then, he tossed it aside with a sneer, saying, ""I don't need this cheap trinket."" Now, he was clutching it like a treasured possession.

Dylan Kline, my third elder brother, was a rational lawyer. Now he stood there with tears streaming down his face and kept his gaze fixed on my face in the coffin.

Sherman Kline, my fourth elder brother, was on his knees. His shoulders trembled uncontrollably. He had always defended Denise most fiercely, but now he couldn't even bring himself to look at my lifeless form.

A nurse entered solemnly and handed an envelope to my adoptive mother, Simone Yarwood. ""These are Ms. Kline's personal effects,"" the nurse said quietly. ""She wrote this during her lucid moments in the hospital.""

All eyes were glued to that thin envelope. I sneered because the real deal was inside. It was irrefutable evidence of all Denise's misdeeds over the years. I risked my life to find the truth.

With trembling hands, Simone opened the envelope. A stack of photos spilled out, revealing my brothers' beloved Denise in a secret meeting with the CEO of their corporate rival. They exchanged documents, including the very confidential files that had nearly bankrupted the Kline Group.

""Impossible!"" Sherman sprang to his feet. ""Denise... How could she...""

More photos lay scattered across the floor. They revealed how Denise tampered with my father, Farrell Kline's medicine, bribed a servant to frame me for theft, and conspired with Enoch's cousin to sabotage my engagement to Enoch.

Enoch picked up a photo, his face instantly drained of color. In the photo, Denise was smiling as she poured something into my cup. That night, I suddenly suffered ""food poisoning"" and nearly died.

""What... have we done to her?"" Dylan said, his voice trembling in anguish.

I floated above the crystal coffin, gazing down at my own peaceful form. How ironic. Now they finally knew who truly loved them, but it was far too late.

""Not too late at all,"" I whispered, though nobody could hear me. ""My vengeance has just begun.""

The air in the funeral hall grew thick with tension. Photos lay scattered across the floor like daggers, mercilessly ripping away the carefully crafted facade Denise had maintained for years.

Jayden was the first to react. His veins bulged as he gripped the photos. He barked, ""Get these checked immediately and see if they photoshopped!""

Dylan wiped his face and picked up several photos, examining them carefully. He said, ""No need for verification. They're real. The angles are covert, but the details are sharp. There's no sign of digital manipulation."" Even the usually composed lawyer's voice was trembling.

I sneered from above. Of course, they were real. I nearly died getting these photos.

""Impossible! Denise would never do something like this,"" Sherman shouted, his eyes blazing with denial. But as soon as his gaze landed on the photo of Denise tampering with Farrell's medicine bottle, his voice died in his throat.

Enoch stared at the photo of the poisoning. Suddenly, he spun around and bolted for the door.

Marcus grabbed his arm, stopping him in his tracks. ""Where the hell are you going?"" he demanded.

""I'm going to make that bitch pay!"" Enoch said, his eyes burning with terrifying fury.

Seeing them like this didn't bring me the relief I'd imagined. If only they had believed me earlier, even just once, and maybe things wouldn't have come to this.

Memories came flooding back like a tidal wave, taking me back to that day a year ago when I was first recognized and taken to the Kline residence.

# Chapter 2

A black stretch limo pulled up in front of the Kline residence. My fingers twisted the hem of my dress, and my palms were sweaty. Only after my adoptive parents, Dalton and Simone Yarwood, passed away did I discover the truth. I was the true heiress of the Kline Group and the long-lost member of the Kline family.

""Erika, we're home."" Farrell gave my shoulder a reassuring pat, his eyes filled with both remorse and hope.

The grand doors of the residence swung open, revealing my four brothers standing in perfect formation. My breath hitched. They looked so accomplished and so utterly untouchable.

Jayden was the current CEO of the Kline Group. He stood there with piercing, cold eyes and was impeccably dressed in a suit. With a slight nod, he said, ""Welcome home."" His voice was polite yet aloof.

Marcus, a renowned painter, had his long hair tied back in a messy bun. His charming eyes sized me up with a scrutinizing gaze. He remarked, ""So you grew up in a small town? Tell me. Can you even paint?""

Dylan adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses and offered a professional smile. ""I'm an attorney. For any legal matters, feel free to consult me.""

Sherman was about my age. He popped his gum and gave me a sidelong glance. ""So you're my real sister,"" he drawled.

Behind them, a girl in a white dress peeked out timidly. Farrell quickly introduced her to me. ""This is Denise. Though we now know she's not our daughter, we'll still raise her as our own.""

Denise dashed over and threw her arms around me. ""Welcome home, Erika!"" Her embrace was uncomfortably tight as she hissed in my ear, ""Don't even think about taking what's mine."" Her voice was low enough for only me to hear.

I froze when she finished speaking.

\*\*\*\*\*

At dinner, I felt like I was totally an outsider.

My brothers chatted about things beyond my understanding. They frequently burst into laughter at Denise's words. She cooed to Jayden, asking him to peel shrimp for her. Marcus immediately piled more food onto her plate. Dylan listened patiently as she prattled on about school, and Sherman even surrendered his dessert to her without a second thought.

""Erika, eat some more,"" Farrell said. He was the only one who noticed my silence.

I forced a smile, but Denise's gaze pierced through me. It was cold and sharp like a knife.

\*\*\*\*\*

That night, I overheard Jayden on the phone in his study. He said in a tired voice, ""The company's stock is still falling. If the loan isn't approved by next week...""

I wanted to do something to soothe him, so I dug out the special coffee recipe Simone had taught me, brewed a pot, and carefully carried it to the study.

Just as my hand was about to knock, Denise suddenly appeared from the side. ""Erika, still awake at this hour?"" she said, her voice deliberately loud. It instantly cut off the conversation inside the study.

""I made some coffee for Jayden,"" I murmured hesitantly.

""Oh, how thoughtful of you!"" Denise said. She flashed a sweet smile as she reached out. ""Let me deliver it for you.""

I instinctively dodged, but she suddenly shrieked and threw herself backward. Scalding coffee splashed on my hand, instantly reddening my skin.

The study door burst open as Jayden stormed out, demanding sharply, ""What the hell is going on here?""

Denise sat on the floor, tears springing to her eyes on cue. ""Maybe it was just an accident. Erika probably didn't mean it."" As she spoke, she showed the small red mark on her arm.

""What the hell did you do?"" Jayden shoved me aside and immediately crouched down to examine Denise's ""injury.""

I clutched my hand, which was far more severely scalded than hers. The pain rendered me speechless.

Farrell rushed over when he heard the commotion. ""Jayden, the company is already in enough trouble. Don't cause more problems at home.""

Jayden shot me an icy glare. ""Causing trouble right after you come back? You're just as uncultured as expected.""

My lips parted, but no sound came out. The pain in my hand was nothing compared to the ache tearing through my heart.

That night, I cried under the covers. It wasn't until the early hours that I finally crept out of bed and gently applied ointment to my burns.

In the mirror, I saw my eyes were swollen like overripe peaches, and my hand was dotted with blisters.

""Is this really my family?"" I whispered to my reflection in the mirror.

As I looked into the mirror, my gaze gradually hardened with resolve. ""No,"" I told myself firmly, ""they don't deserve to be my family.""

From that day on, I learned to mask my feelings and began watching Denise's every move from the shadows. She thought I was just a country bumpkin, but little did she know that I was quietly documenting every one of her schemes.

# Chapter 3

""Found her. Denise's at the Milinton Hotel!"" Sherman burst into the funeral hall with his phone in his hand. His voice brought me back to reality.

Without a second thought, Enoch bolted straight for the door. Jayden snatched up the car keys, with Marcus and Dylan hot on his heels. Their faces were contorted with a fury I'd never witnessed before.

I hovered above the coffin, watching their rushing figures disappear, and I murmured with a cold smile, ""Go on. See for yourselves what your doted-on Denise is really doing right now.""

My soul tagged along. There was no way that I would miss out on this show.

\*\*\*\*\*

The blisters on my hand took three full days to heal. During those three days, not a single family member came to see me, except for the housekeeper Marlene, who brought my meals.

""Erika, your meal is ready."" Marlene set the tray on the bedside table, her eyes full of quiet pity. In this household, even the housekeeper could tell who the favored one was.

""Thank you, Marlene."" I forced a weak smile. With my right hand still bandaged, I awkwardly scooped up food with my left hand.

Marlene hesitated, then finally sighed and said, ""Denise said you were unwell and needed complete rest.""

I clumsily spooned some porridge into my mouth.

Hearing what Marlene said, I sneered.

It was clear that Denise wanted everyone to ignore me.

After that incident, Farrell went on a business trip, leaving me without a single soul who would stand up for me.

The door suddenly swung open, and Denise swept in like a social butterfly. Her pristine white dress was spotless.

""Erika, are you feeling better?"" she said, her voice sickly sweet. Then she sat down on the edge of the bed and reached out to touch my bandage.

I recoiled. Her manicured nails looked nice, yet I was well aware of just how vicious those hands could be.

Denise was dismissive. Leaning in until her lips nearly brushed my ear, she whispered, ""You really think Dad can protect you forever? He's leaving for Topandia on business tomorrow, and he won't be back for a whole month.""

She flashed an innocent smile. ""This month, I'll show you who the real heiress is in this family.""

I tightened my grip on the spoon. ""Why do you have to be like this? We could have gotten along.""

""Get along?"" she scoffed, as if she'd just heard the most ridiculous joke. ""Do you have any idea how many years I've spent making everyone adore me? Why do you, a country bumpkin, think you can just waltz in and take what's mine?""

I looked her straight in the eye and said firmly, ""I want nothing but my family.""

""Family?"" Denise scoffed in disdain.

She added, ""They've been my family for a long time now. Jayden peels shrimp for me. Marcus teaches me how to paint. Dylan tutors me, and Sherman follows me around all day.""

She stood up, looking down at me. ""As for Enoch, he's promised to marry me ever since we were kids.""

That was the first time I had heard Enoch's name.

Denise seemed delighted by my reaction. She said, ""Oh, you didn't know? You and Enoch are engaged. It was arranged by our grandparents."" With a triumphant twirl, she added, ""But don't worry. This engagement will soon be mine.""

After she left, I couldn't take another bite. No one had told me about the engagement.

\*\*\*\*\*

That afternoon, I removed the bandages. The skin on my hand was still red, though the pain had eased. Feeling suffocated by staying cooped up in my room, I decided to take a stroll in the garden instead.

The Kline residence's huge garden was alive with vibrant roses. As I bent down to breathe in their fragrance, footsteps suddenly approached.

""Oh, Denise, there you are,"" a man said.

I turned and saw a strange man standing on the garden path. He wore a charcoal-gray suit. His face was chiseled, and his features were sharp and angular. When our eyes met, he visibly froze for a moment.

""You're not Denise,"" he said.

I stood up, brushing the grass off my skirt. ""I'm Erika, her sister.""

He gave me an appraising look. ""So, you're the Kline family's long-lost heiress?"" he said coolly. ""I'm Enoch Leblanc. Nice to meet you.""

I finally saw Enoch, the man Denise claimed would marry her. I didn't know what to say. All I could do was give a nod.

""Where's Denise?"" he asked, his tone noticeably softening.

""I'm not sure. Maybe inside,"" I replied.

Enoch frowned. ""She told me to meet in the garden at three."" He checked his watch, his expression darkening. ""It's already twenty past three.""

I shrugged. ""Maybe she got the time wrong?""

""Impossible. Denise is never late,"" Enoch said flatly, as if I'd just slandered Denise.

Just as the awkward silence dragged on, Denise's voice rang out from behind. ""Enoch, I'm so sorry I'm late!"" She trotted over and immediately linked arms with Enoch in an intimate gesture. ""I was baking a cake for Erika. I wanted to surprise her, and I completely lost track of time.""

Enoch's expression instantly softened. He said tenderly, ""You're always so thoughtful.""

Denise flashed a sweet smile and then ""suddenly"" noticed my hand. ""Does it still hurt, Erika? I was so worried about you that day,"" she said, reaching out to grab my hand. I instinctively dodged.

My movement was unmistakable. Enoch's gaze turned icy in an instant. ""Erika, is that how you respond to your sister's concern?""

I opened my mouth, but words failed me. Should I say, ""She was actually aiming for my wound?""

""It's alright,"" Denise said in a kind voice. ""She just got home, and she isn't used to things yet."" Turning to Enoch, she added, ""Let's go to the gazebo. I made your favorite macaroons just for you.""

Enoch gave a curt nod. Before leaving, he shot me an icy glare.

I bit my lower lip as I watched their retreating figures. It had only been a few days, and Denise had already succeeded in turning everyone against me.

# Chapter 4

Back in my room, I pulled a new notebook from the drawer, and on the first page, I carefully wrote down the date and every misdeed Denise had committed.

My adoptive father, Dalton Yarwood, once told me that when the enemy was too powerful, one should keep a record of their every move and wait for the perfect moment to strike back.

""Denise,"" I whispered under my breath, ""you think I'm some pushover, but you're dead wrong.""

\*\*\*\*\*

That night, laughter and chatter drifted up from downstairs.

Peeking through the stair railings, I saw Enoch and Denise sitting on the sofa, surrounded by my four brothers. Denise was playing the piano while Enoch gazed at her tenderly.

Sherman was the first to spot me. He called out cheerfully, ""Hey, Erika. You came downstairs. Want to join us and listen to Denise play the piano?""

All eyes suddenly turned to me. Denise's smile faltered for a brief instant before she plastered on an even brighter grin. She urged, ""Yes, Erika, come sit next to me.""

""No thanks,"" I said, taking a step back. ""I've got a bit of a headache. I'll turn in early.""

""Wait,"" Marcus called out to me. ""There's an art exhibition tomorrow. The whole family's going. Why don't you come along?""

I looked up in surprise. This was the first time Marcus had ever invited me to a place.

""Sure—"" I said.

""Denise's friend is coming, too,"" Sherman cut in excitedly. ""None other than the supermodel Lillian!""

It dawned on me instantly.

Marcus only invited me because Denise's friend was coming.

""But I might not be feeling well tomorrow,"" I murmured softly.

Dylan adjusted his glasses. ""Suit yourself,"" he said, his impatience barely concealed.

Enoch didn't even glance my way. His eyes stayed glued to Denise the entire time.

As I ascended upstairs, I heard Denise ""whisper"", ""Don't blame Erika. She's probably just not used to gatherings like this.""

""She's just a country bumpkin. I bet she has never seen anything this fancy, huh?"" Enoch's clear voice rang out.

My nails dug deep into my palms, but I felt no pain. At that moment, it finally hit me just how dire my situation was.

Back in my room, I added a few more lines to my notebook and then carefully slid it beneath the mattress.

The cold moonlight streamed in through the window. I told myself, ""Erika, starting today, you must learn to stand up for yourself.""

\*\*\*\*\*

Three weeks into Farrell's trip to Topandia, I finally made a shocking discovery.

Late that night, I went downstairs for water. As I passed by Farrell's study, I caught faint noises coming from inside.

Who was in his study this late?

I crept closer on tiptoe. The door stood slightly ajar, and a thin beam of light seeped through the gap.

Through the crack in the door, I saw Denise standing at Farrell's desk with her back to me. She was holding a small medicine bottle, adding some suspicious substance to it. My breath hitched. Instinctively, I pulled out my phone and quietly snapped a few photos.

""Who's there?"" Denise snapped, whipping around.

I hurriedly hid around the corner of the hallway. My heart pounded as her footsteps drew nearer. Just then, the sound of the front door opening came from downstairs. Jayden was back.

Denise stopped, and then I heard the study door click shut. Only then did I finally let out the breath I'd been holding. I slipped quietly back to my room. Only after locking the door did I dare to check the photos on my phone.

The angle wasn't perfect, but the photo clearly captured Denise pouring suspicious white powder into the medicine bottle.

Farrell had high blood pressure and needed to take his medication daily.

What was Denise doing? I stared at the photo, my hands trembling uncontrollably.

This was way too serious. I thought I must tell Jayden about it immediately.",1,1752323088.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

To the Grizzly Don Novel_Alcee woke with a start and clutched her chest as the loud bang of furniture being knocked over forced her to an upright position.,"Alcee woke with a start and clutched her chest as the loud bang of furniture being knocked over forced her to an upright position.

Hollering in the adjoining room was coupled with the sound of fists flying and she scrambled from the bed. Digging around for the clothing and trench coat she’d worn to this hotel room, she considered her clothes were returning to her body with far more alacrity than her paramour from the night before removed them.

The sound of a man begging another to not kill him raised her hackles. Looking around frantically she knew there was only one door from the bedroom to the main hotel door but as she looked at the sliding balcony door, she deliberated whether the balcony met with the other room she’d crossed through the night before.

Grabbing her phone, purse, and shoes in her hands she quietly tiptoed to the balcony, flinching when the unmistakable sound of a silenced gun went off. She knew the pop sound as sure as her last name was Mariani.

“Fuck, fuck, fuck, Alcee you idiot!” she whimpered to herself as she stepped onto the patio. The sun was barely breaking the horizon, and the view would have been breathtaking had she not quite possibly just heard someone being murdered in the adjoining suite. “Please don’t let them be Dad’s men.”

Desperately she leaned over the balcony and noted the height of the room she was in and mentally berated herself for falling asleep. Turning to slide along the cool concrete of the balcony, she peered through the crack of the curtains into the room and saw the man she’d spent the night with unscrewing the silencer off the pistol in his hand and glaring down at the body on the floor.

She didn’t recognize him at all and as she looked around the room, she admitted even the three other men in the room who were on their knees in front of her lover and two other men towering over them, were also unknown to her. It wasn’t like she knew all of her father’s men but if someone was coming to drag her sorry ass back, he’d send someone she knew.

Which meant, she was in a hotel room with a man who in the last several minutes committed murder, and she was a witness and if her father found out, he’d order a clean up of the entire group. Not that she’d live to see it if he found out what she’d done before she made her escape. Or worse, if the man in the next room opted to simply get rid of the witness he’d fucked the night before.

She looked around again and grimaced as she looked upward. They were in a penthouse suite. The man who’d purchased her virginity for a cool million the night before was living large. She dropped her trench coat, figuring if she was going to have to shimmy onto the roof of the balcony and try to get to the roof of the hotel, she wasn’t going to be able to do it wearing a long coat. Then her eyes caught the drop again and she knew there was no way she was going to be able to get off the balcony.

She needed to find another way. She was a nerd not an athlete and scaling a building to a rooftop was going to lead to her death and she hadn’t just boldly defied her father and grandfather by giving up her virginity to a stranger instead of the man they’d betrothed her to since she was a teenager to die falling off a building.

“Good going Alcee,” she muttered under her breath, “you managed to find your escape from the Mariani family only to stupidly fall into bed with a murderer. Fuck.” She kicked a chair and then cringed as the metal scraped along the concrete floor of the patio then clattered against the glass door.

When the patio door slid open and her lover from the night before stuck his head out, she immediately cowered in the other chair. Bruno was drop dead gorgeous and incredibly massive. Easily six foot six with shoulders as wide as a linebacker’s and his feet were twice the length of hers. Her body clenched with the memory of what else was humungous on him and she shivered. If she hadn’t been so terrified in this moment, she’d be parting her legs like Moses did the sea.

“What are you doing out here?”

“Watching the sunrise,” she met his gaze fearfully, swallowing her terror where it boiled like a festering sourdough-starter in her gut. “I was going to leave but you seemingly have company.” Her hands were visibly shaking.

“Aya,” he spoke her fake name gently, moving to kneel in front of her, his hand brushing a dark curl off her forehead before gripping her fingers. “You should still be sleeping. Did I not wear you out enough?”

She shook her head unable to meet his gaze, “you, um, there was yelling, and I don’t like confrontation, so I came out here until the yelling stopped.”

“Did you look in the window?” He motioned from where he just emerged.

“No. I came out here as soon as the yelling got really loud, and I simply sat here.” She rested her chin on her knees and prayed he bought her story.

“Good girl,” he leaned forward and kissed her forehead. “I would very much like for us to see each other again but I can’t do so if you’re poking your nose where it doesn’t belong.”

“I understand, Bruno,” she whispered twisting her lips.

“You are so fucking beautiful,” he whispered as he leaned closer stroking her cheek. His eyes were a warm honeyed brown with flecks of gold, and they stared into hers like he was staring into her soul.

The scent of gunpowder was on his fingers, and it made her heart pound with fear, but she feigned ignorance as she closed her eyes when his lips connected with hers.

**Chapter 2**

When he broke the kiss she was almost distracted from the goings-on in the adjoining room.

“I told you before, I am a very wealthy man. Do you know why I bought you last night, darling?”

She shook her head, “rich men do crazy things all the time.”

“My last lover gave me an STD.” her eyes flicked to his in horror and he held up his hand, “I am clean now, as attested to by the medical report you insisted, I provide ahead of our meeting, but getting chlamydia a year ago made me want to try something completely different. A virgin was going to ensure I was safe from the machinations of a twisted, cheating, lover’s mind. I wasn’t expecting you to be as,” he paused, the back of his knuckles dragging over her bottom lip, “responsive and excitable as you turned out to be. I want you to stay. If you can be a good girl and sit here and wait until my men finish their discussion,” he drawled the word out, “then we can pick up where we left off. Since I’m your first I was hoping we can continue to see each other.”

She finally met his gaze, “you paid me a million dollars for one night, Bruno. I didn’t think it would lead to more than the one night. I have college classes, and my family is likely waiting for me.” She looked at his watch, “my family always does brunch on Sundays. I can’t miss it.”

“I would like to meet your family. I’m not letting you go, darling girl. Last night was bar none, the most exquisite night of my life and knowing you are untouched by any other man is bringing out the most primal part of me to keep you as mine and mine alone.”

She was truly terrified now, “I don’t understand.”

“I want you to be my mistress. Long term. We will fuck every night and likely every morning too,” his dark eyes were heated as they looked her over, “and in return, I will take care of your every need. There is nothing you or your family should want for. If you wish to continue your education, I have no issue with this. Where do you go to school?”

“NYU.”

“What are you taking?”

“Graphic design.” All the back story she’d concocted when she’d started this game came to her easily. She’d practiced it enough.

“Then you will continue. I’ll have your courses paid for. It won’t cost your family anything.” He frowned, “why did you sell your virginity online? What prompted you to do so?”

Alcee found herself wondering how he could hold a conversation as he was while there was a dead man in the next room but then it dawned on her, he was distracting her while the men cleaned up the situation.

“I needed the money.”

“For?”

Twisting her fingers nervously she shrugged, “school is expensive, and my parents have three kids including me. My program is sixty thousand dollars over four years. I have student loan debt and then when I graduate, I want to start my own business, and the start-up is expensive. One of my girlfriends suggested doing this black-market thing as an auction. One of her cousins did it to pay off her student loans instead of stripping. I was only looking for the sixty thousand for my program, but you bid a million and here we are.”

“You come from a large family.”

“Yes.”

Her family consisted of five children, with four older brothers, another lie told. All four of them were in arranged engagements and marriages. Her eldest brother Mercurio was married seven years ago when he was twenty-five to the daughter of his father’s Consigliere Panfilo. Panfilo was her father’s second cousin which meant her brother married within the family. She herself couldn’t fathom having sex with someone they shared DNA history with but to keep it in the family, her brother toed the line. If he wanted to be Don someday, he did what was demanded of him by their father.

“I will provide for your family.” He said as he rose to stand in front of her, extending his hand out.

A man stuck his head out the door, “Bruno, sir, we have relocated our guests, if you and your companion would like to head to the other suite across the hall for breakfast.”

“Thank you,” he nodded to the man. “Come. We will have breakfast together and discuss our future.” He lifted up her trench coat off the patio table and wrapped it over her shoulders.

Draping his arm around her he edged her through the room where the body had been, and she made certain to keep her eyes averted. Twenty-one years of living as the princess to the Mariani family, she knew when she was supposed to keep her eyes and mouth shut.

Just as he escorted her into a room across the hall, another man wearing an obvious holster came into the hall and she flinched.

“He is my head of security. As I said, I am quite wealthy and have many enemies.”

“Sir, a word?” the man motioned for Bruno to return to the suite they’d just vacated.

She didn’t waste any time. The moment the two men disappeared into the room and closed the door; she was pulling the door to the suite she was in open and racing to the far end of the hall through the emergency stairwell.

After racing down multiple flights of stairs she stopped to take a breath, wheezing like an asthmatic missing their inhaler. “Holy shit, Alcee, you need to exercise more,” she hissed at herself.

Eventually she reached the bottom floor and then made her way to the parking garage. It didn’t take long to find her way into the early morning traffic and to flag down a yellow taxi.

Giving directions to her parent’s estate, she was dropped off outside the gates and made the slow walk up the driveway.

Her mother was right behind the butler who opened the front door, her hand going to her mouth in horror, as she took in her daughter’s walk of shame, “Alcee, what have you done?”

Taking a deep breath, she met her mother’s gaze directly, “if anyone was going to sell off my virginity it was going to be me. You can tell Papa unless Don Lozano is interested in a bride who is no longer pure, I’m of no use to either family.”

A fleeting thought of the passion of the night before taunted her as she considered perhaps, she should have stayed with the murdering rich man named Bruno as all hell broke loose.

**Chapter 3**

“Susana,” Alcee groaned into her cell phone as she knelt under the desk of one of the administrators from the upper management floor, “I don’t have time for this.”

“Make time.”

The constant demands of her friends on her time was something they fought about constantly. While they were under the protection of their family, she was without and they seemed to always forget she was putting her life at risk each time she stepped outside her front door. Life wasn’t so easy when you were an ex-principessa and the streets knew the Mariani Don didn’t care if you lived or died.

“Can’t. I’m working overtime tonight.”

“Ditch it.”

“Unlike you who still has her trust fund,” she grunted as she adjusted an HDMI cable and sighed, “I need to work.” There was always a terrible fear her money would run out and she’d be struggling to provide for Antero.

“You have money in the bank!”

“There are savings in the event something happens, and I lose my job or get sick or suffer an accident or all of the above. My nest egg protects me and my family. My job keeps us fed and housed.” She backed out from under the desk and shoved back up her glasses which slipped down her nose. She plunked herself down in the chair and booted up the computer on the desk and waited for it to come back on.

“Alcee, you need to live a little.”

“Look, I’m working right now. There are six more computers I need to get set up before I can go home at the end of the day. I would very much like to focus on my task.”

“You work too hard. This isn’t good for you.”

“I work exactly hard enough to keep me alive and out of my father’s crosshairs, Susana.”

“You owe me.”

“How? On what planet does me declining a dinner invite which is a double date, a blind date for me, turn into me owing you one? This isn’t adding up.”

“I don’t know how, but you owe me. We are going do to do this double date at some point so stop putting it off.”

“Whatever,” she hung up the phone and then typed on the keyboard and watched with pleasure as the system came up and running. One down. Six more to go.

When she left her parent’s home six years ago, or more accurately when her father threw her out with nothing but the clothes on her back for being a disgrace, she’d managed to find her footing relatively quickly.

Getting hired on as an IT general specialist straight out of college at a large security firm in Manhattan, she’d been able to make a career for herself. The only hiccup was when three years ago, the company switched hands, and the Lozano family purchased the company lock stock and barrel. She’d been terrified for months they would note her last name on the employee list and fire her, or worse, kill her.

Instead, despite the sale, the new owners of the company hadn’t set foot in the building in the three years they’d owned it. The rumor mill said they were quite happy with the way the current president of the company was running things.

The current president of the company, Kylen, was hired by the previous CEO. Kylen was an ex-Navy seal who hired mostly the men and women he’d worked with in the forces or were referred to him. Alcee who was hired by the previous CEO remained one of the few outliers taken on with the recommendations of one of her college professors. She’d passed the vetting process, all the background checks and even her last name hadn’t been able to stop them from hiring her and the prior CEO took her under her wing and made her his honorary granddaughter. When he’d retired and sold the company, she knew he’d insisted to Kylen to keep her on.

It seemed the new owners presumed the current company president kept staff in place he trusted and as such nobody even breathed her name the wrong way during the transition of the company following the sale to the Lozano family. Mr. Kylen Burgess stayed on as the president and the Lozano family never bothered too much.

She knew they came to attend board meetings and the like, but she was what the upper management group called a troll. She and the other six IT generalists lived in the lower levels of the company, often referred to as the bowels of hell, by the rest of the employees. She personally found the moniker funny because in her Italian Catholic upbringing, hell was supposed to be hot, and the computer lab floor was colder than the rest of the building.

She was smirking to herself at the thought when one of her counterparts came grumbling in her direction. “What’s up, Tank?”

Tank was one of the military-trained IT guys and in command of their department. He reported directly to Kylen. He also lived up to his name in terms of size but he was usually a gentle soul, happy to sit behind his desk and plug along on a keyboard.

“All the fucking bigwigs are upstairs. Kylen let me know the CEO is moving from his office in Europe to New York. He let me know now, as in right this minute instead of, you know, giving me a heads up so I could prepare for this shit.”

She felt her stomach drop to her feet. She’d jinxed herself by even thinking of the Lozano family.

“The CEO?”

“Torquato Lozano.”

Fuck. She was going to puke. She was going to projectile vomit all over the desktop she’d put together.

**Chapter 4**

Torquato Lozano. To the business world he was a hard-nosed businessman but to those who knew what la famiglia meant, he was the Don of the Lozano family. He’d boldly and brutally overthrown his own father for the title when his grandfather stepped down. He’d been thirty-two when he took control of his family. He’d done so only one year after his family rescinded the marriage agreement once they found out she wasn’t a virgin any longer.

Now he’d be roughly thirty-seven years old, a Don for five years now and he’d made a hell of a name for himself. Her brother and he were the same age and while her brothers still talked to her and kept her in the loop about things which she needed to be aware of for her protection, the one thing her eldest brother always said was Don Lozano scared the fuck out of him, and they’d grown up with Edgardo Mariani for a father.

To this day, there wasn’t a single direct photograph of the Don of the Lozano family. Unlike his father who frequently postured and grandstanded for the notoriety of it all, Torquato operated in the shadows. Rumors swirled that he was ugly with scars running over his face and a temper to match.

It was why, of course, she’d gone through the lengths she’d gone to avoid marrying him. The last thing she wanted was to be the unwilling bride to a sadist who was ten years older than her and wanted a wife who was nothing more than a brood mare to be raped and bred day in and out until she popped out the heir to his throne.

She’d taken a big risk doing what she’d done but it paid off. Auctioning off her virginity on the dark web had been a burst of insanity. Nobody could trace who she was because she was a damn good hacker so Bruno would never be able to find out anything more than the backstory, she meticulously created and left breadcrumbs about. Her family would never figure out who to whom she’d sold herself because all traces of the experience were wiped clean, by her own hand. Once her mother threw her into her room to await her father’s arrival, she’d been on her computer in seconds, eradicating all the images of her from the hotel surveillance and nearby traffic lights, she’d transferred the money she’d received to an offshore account and erased every digital print of the night as if it never happened.

She knew she’d also done Bruno a solid because in removing every trace of herself from the computer system, she also got rid of all the evidence of his men disposing of the three bodies.

Emerging from her memory she crinkled her nose at Tank, “I’m sorry, what did you say?”

“I need you upstairs with me to help me set up the two offices. I can do the programming for the security systems we need to run but I need a second set of hands to get this done.”

“Tank, I must get the other desks set up. I’m already working overtime.”

“Not my problem. You’ll stay later.”

“Are you going to arrange the babysitter?” she shot back at him angrily, shoving her glasses back up her nose. “In case you forgot I have a kid at home who I’d like to at least see for a few minutes before he goes to bed.”

Tank sighed, “look, let’s set the offices up upstairs and then you and I will come down here and get this done.”

“Which part do you not get? My sitter is only there for two more hours. Not a minute more. If I lose my sitter, I will quit my job and then you lose one of our IT team.”

“Fine. You can come in early tomorrow.”

“Do they call you Tank because you run roughshod all over people like a tank?” It was a comment she’d made multiple times over the years.

He chuckled. “I’ll call one of the other guys to come in early. Deal?”

“Deal.” She dropped what she was doing and followed him down the hall towards the elevator. Her stomach was still churning. “When you said they were upstairs, they’re not in the offices, are they? I mean there is nothing set up yet.”

“They’re working out of the boardroom for now. They showed up unannounced or, according to Kylen with one hour’s notice. Also, the secretary or admin assistant or whatever the socially appropriate name is now for the woman who gets his coffee and dry cleaning, is a piece of work. She’s wearing six-inch heels, more lipstick than a Vogue cover girl and makes me feel every bit as insecure as I did when I got picked on by the cheer captain in middle school. I swear she’s every nerd’s worst nightmare.”

“You were a nerd, Tank?”

“I got big in the army, Alcee and switched my coke-bottle glasses for contacts but in here,” he tapped his chest, “fifteen-year-old skinny Ezekiel who preferred playing chess against the computer than talking to people still doesn’t like bitchy women who chew little boys like me up.”

She chuckled, “she can’t be so bad.”

“She took one look at Kylen, and he made sure to put the entire length of the board room table between them. I’ve known him a long time and let me tell you, even he is steering clear of her. Her name is Genevra and she’s the reason the term mean girls was coined.” He pushed the button to the top floor and jammed his fists into his pockets. “These are the days I miss mine-clearing operations.”

As the doors opened to the top floor, she found herself heartily agreeing with him. A sinking feeling the risk of her being on this floor or doing the task he’d now mentioned were equally devastating if the Lozano family found issue with her working in their building.

**Chapter 5**

She was quickly trying to get the desk set up with dual monitors, ergonomic keyboards, state of the art laptop with all the bells and whistles as far as printers and speakers and all the other accoutrements went.

The longer she worked, the more she realized she needed to resign. She’d worked for three years too long here. The minute the company shifted hands, despite the fact the CEO was rumored to be in Italy and intended to keep his base there, she should have sought employment elsewhere. She’d taken false safety in hiding right under the enemy’s nose.

The clicking of heels on the tiled floor coming in her direction made her cringe as she heard Tank utter a muffled “fuck me”. She looked into the open doorway of the CEO’s office where the giant of a man was working and saw the shudder go through him as he heard the woman approaching before, he saw her.

The woman’s muttering in Italian, a series of curses about how slow the staff was and how uncultured New Yorkers were made Alcee’s head throb and suddenly Alcee forcing herself not to divulge she could speak the language. Instead, she kept her head bent and unravelled a long cord. If she didn’t engage the woman perhaps, she’d be left alone. Her thought was incredibly short lived.

“Make sure those cords are not anywhere I am going to trip on them.” The woman’s voice shrilly skittered along Alcee’s spine.

“Yes ma’am,” she nodded, not looking up to make eye contact. She held up a clip which would conceal and pin the cords to the underside of the desk. “This will keep them off your feet.”

“Ugh, how much longer will you be?”

“Another thirty minutes, forty max.”

“Not acceptable. I want it done in fifteen minutes.”

Alcee shot a glance at Tank at the other desk, and he pressed his lips together in frustration. She felt the same sense of foreboding at the woman’s tone and knew she would not like the answer. “I’m afraid it’s impossible.”

“Make it possible.”

“And if I can’t?”

“Then you’re fired.”

This time the look she shot to Tank had him sitting up and getting ready to rush towards her. She knew the glint in her eye was not anything he could miss. This woman gave her a get out of jail free card and she’d never lost a game of Monopoly in her life. She was taking this little card and running with it.

“No, no, no, Cee, let me help.” Tank moved far faster than a man his size should as he vacated the desk he was working to prepare to come assist her.

“You cannot help her. You need to finish Mr. Lozano’s set up. He needed in his office hours ago. Instead, he is working at an uncomfortable table.”

Her accent was thick, and Alcee was convinced she was exaggerating it because she knew she could do the exact same thing if she wanted. Despite sounding as American as apple pie most of the time, if Alcee were in Italy right now, she’d blend in with her family as if she’d never left the country. The woman was trying to act as if she were better than them because of her Italian background. It made Alcee want to leave all the more. Phony bitch.

“You are given fifteen minutes, or you’re done.” The woman glared at her.

Alcee stood up from the desk, ignoring Tank’s groan and dropped the cords. “You don’t need to fire me. I quit. Ciao stronza,” she bowed deeply at the waist and turned to look at Tank with a smug grin. “Call security to meet me at my locker since it’s protocol to escort all employees who are fired or resigned from the premises.” She considered skipping to her locker.

“No, Alcee, you can’t quit,” he chased after her.

The other woman was blinking incredulously as if she’d expected Alcee to argue and try to keep her job. Did the woman actually believe she’d beg? As if. She was a Mariani. Mariani don’t beg. She might not be her father’s principessa but the name on her birth certificate was deep in her DNA. Her pride ran in her blood thicker than any other of her traits.

Kylen happened to be coming out of the board room as she hit the button for the elevator. “Tank, where are you two going? The set up can’t be done yet.”

“The ice princess over there, fired Alcee because Alcee said it would take thirty-to-forty minutes to finish the desk set up. I’m trying to beg her not to leave. Genevra wanted it done in fifteen minutes and it’s impossible. Not only that but the physical set up can be done in thirty or forty minutes but then I need to get into the computer and get it up to the standard of the company. If their laptops hadn’t gotten destroyed, then we wouldn’t be in this situation, but Mr. Lozano made it clear his personal computer is not to be associated with the business and the one he brought from Italy was destroyed in the car accident this afternoon.” He mumbled under his breath about bullets in a laptop making Alcee’s spine straighten. “We’re setting up a brand-new system for the pair of them and she’s making impossible demands. We were rushing as best we could. As it was, Alcee was supposed to be setting up the new marketing department upgrades this evening, and we let it go until tomorrow. I arranged for a crew to come in at six tomorrow to do what Alcee was taken away from completing downstairs.”

**Chapter 6**

“Alcee,” Kylen reached out to stop her from entering the elevator. He put a hand on her shoulder to keep her still. “We can clear up this misunderstanding.”

“It’s not a misunderstanding, Mr. Burgess. She told me to get it done in a fraction of the available time or I’m fired. I harbor no illusions about my abilities to perform magic and as a result, I’ve accepted my termination. I’ve asked Tank to request security walk me out.”

“While Ms. Verrilli is indeed the assistant to the CEO, she is not HR, and she can’t hire or fire.”

“The hell I can’t,” the woman approached, her heels smacking the floor. It made Alcee think of her mother who often wore the same type of shoes, but you’d never hear her coming. One was graceful, the other was not. The woman’s annoying voice was more evidence she was playing dress-up, trying to be more than she was because elegance and decorum were not anything she possessed. “She is done here. She was talking back to her superiors, and she cursed at me.”

“You heard her.” Alcee flapped her hand as the bitchy woman stomped her heel with enough force, Alcee was surprised the spike didn’t snap off. “She’s my superior and I denied her request to finish in fifteen minutes. I’m done here.”

Kylen grabbed the other woman by the arm and began dragging her away, looking over his shoulder at Alcee. “Alcee, please finish the desk setup. If you still want to quit when you’re done putting it together, then I’ll write you a glowing letter of recommendation. In the meantime, I’m going to beg Mr. Lozano remind Ms. Verrilli of her job demands and expectations.”

“Unhand me you American barbarian.” The woman was yanking on her arm as she was dragged unceremoniously down the hall.

“I’d really rather quit than deal with her,” Alcee met Tank’s eyes and knew the truth was blaring right at him in the soft brown of her irises.

“If you walk out with the job undone, he’ll make sure you can’t get hired anywhere else.” Tank threatened her. “Do you want a letter of recommendation, or do you want to be unemployed forever?”

“Ugh,” she threw her hands up in the air and marched back to the desk. “When I was in high school, I once hacked into the school system and fucked with the SAT results of my bully and made sure she didn’t get into any college and when she retook them, I did it again. I miss how easy those days were compared to this shit,” she found herself back on her knees under the desk setting up the wires she was working on earlier.

The sound of yelling down the hall, coming from the lone female voice at the end, made them both perk up and then not ten minutes after Kylen dragged her away, the woman was back in front of Alcee muttering a not-very-heartfelt apology.

“Take your time and make sure it’s done right.” The woman finished her monologue.

“Yup.” Alcee didn’t even look at the woman as she continued working.

“You are a rude American.”

She heard a man clearing his throat and a rapid exchange of Italian again and the woman stormed off furiously.

“I am sorry for my sister’s behavior.”

“Your sister?” Alcee looked up to meet the eyes of the man now standing opposite the desk she was putting together.

He extended his hand, “Bastiano Verrilli. I am the head of corporate security for Mr. Lozano. It’s nice to meet you Ms. Mariani.”

The way he said her last name sent a shiver of fear down her spine. His eyes were dark and searching and she knew without a shadow of a doubt the man knew who she was. He wasn’t the head of security for Torquato Lozano without knowing who was here on his floor.

“I’m sure the pleasure is all mine,” she whispered back without reaching to shake his proffered hand, instead ducking back under the desk to hook up the cable in her hand. The telltale sound of the printer starting up made her smile with relief. One more thing done.

“When you are done here, you are to come to the board room to see Mr. Lozano.”

She poked her head back out, smacking the top of her skull against the hard wood, “is it an order from the CEO?” The other half of her question, “or the Don,” was left unspoken but the way the man in front of her quirked an eyebrow told her the answer.

He leaned over the desk, his huge meaty hands gripping the top of it to stare straight at her, “does your father know you work for the Lozano family?”

“My father,” she grunted as she yanked on an extension cord from under the desk, “doesn’t miss a trick, Mr. Verrilli, but if you’re asking if I’ve personally been in contact with him to let him know of my day-to-day activities, I have not been permitted to speak to anyone in the Mariani family since he threw me out of their home six years ago. Aside from the occasional call from my brothers who defy his orders to check on my wellbeing, I haven’t spoken with anyone else in the family. If my father knows what I do, it is because he has looked into it, not because I volunteered information.”

The man seemed surprised, “he threw you out?”

“The minute my father found out the one thing he was using to bargain me off to Mr. Lozano was no longer intact, he tossed me on my ass. I cost him a lot of money and his face.”

“Mr. Lozano cancelled the contract.”

“Yes, because my hymen was no longer intact. I was no longer of value to the family without my virginity, so I got thrown out. It was better than the bullet he threatened me with, I suppose.”

“Wait, wait,” Mr. Verrilli seemed completely perplexed, “are you telling me your father threw you out because you weren’t a virgin?”

“Yes. He’d promised my virginity to Mr. Lozano, and I broke the covenant.”

“Mr. Lozano broke the agreement but not because –” he stopped speaking as if he was aware he was talking out of turn. “Excuse me.”

She grimaced as he almost ran to the boardroom at the end of the hall.

Mafia men were strange.

  'Brace yourself,' said Miles Mollison, standing in the kitchen of one of the big houses in Church Row.  
  
  He had waited until half-past six in the morning to make the call. It had been a bad night, full of long stretches of wakefulness punctuated by snatches of restless sleep. At four in the morning, he had realized that his wife was awake too, and they had talked quietly for a while in the darkness. Even as they discussed what they had been forced to witness, each trying to drive out vague feelings of fright and shock, feathery little ripples of excitement had tickled Miles' insides at the thought of delivering the news to his father. He had intended to wait until seven, but fear that somebody else might beat him to it had propelled him to the telephone early.  
  
  'What's happened?' boomed Howard's voice, with a slightly tinny edge; Miles had put him on speakerphone for Samantha's benefit. Mahogany brown in her pale pink dressing gown, she had taken advantage of their early waking to apply another handful of Self-Sun to her fading natural tan. The kitchen was full of the mingled smells of instant coffee and synthetic coconut.  
  
  'Fairbrother's dead. Collapsed at the golf club last night. Sam and I were having dinner at the Birdie. '  
  
  'Fairbrother's dead?' roared Howard.  
  
  The inflection implied that he had been expecting some dramatic change in the status of Barry Fairbrother, but that even he had not anticipated actual death.  
  
  'Collapsed in the car park,' repeated Miles.  
  
  'Good God,' said Howard. 'He wasn't much past forty, was he? Good God. '  
  
  Miles and Samantha listened to Howard breathing like a blown horse. He was always short of breath in the mornings.  
  
  'What was it? Heart?'  
  
  'Something in his brain, they think. We went with Mary to the hospital and - '  
  
  But Howard was not paying attention. Miles and Samantha heard him speaking away from his mouthpiece.  
  
  'Barry Fairbrother! Dead! It's Miles!'  
  
  'Sam and I went in the ambulance,' Miles enunciated clearly. 'With Mary and the body. '  
  
  Samantha noticed how Miles' second version emphasized what you might call the more commercial aspect of the story. Samantha did not blame him. Their reward for enduring the awful experience was the right to tell people about it. She did not think she would ever forget it: Mary wailing; Barry's eyes still half open above the muzzle-like mask; she and Miles trying to read the paramedic's expression; the cramped jolting; the dark windows; the terror.  
  
  'Good God,' said Howard for the third time, ignoring Shirley's soft background questioning, his attention all Miles'. 'He just dropped down dead in the car park?'  
  
  'Yep,' said Miles. 'Moment I saw him it was pretty obvious there was nothing to be done. '  
  
  It was his first lie, and he turned his eyes away from his wife as he told it. She remembered his big protective arm around Mary's shaking shoulders: He'll be OK . . . he'll be OK . . .  
  
  But after all, thought Samantha, giving Miles his due, how were you supposed to know one way or the other, when they were strapping on masks and shoving in needles? It had seemed as though they were trying to save Barry, and none of them had known for certain that it was no good until the young doctor had walked towards Mary at the hospital. Samantha could still see, with awful clarity, Mary's naked, petrified face, and the expression of the bespectacled, sleek-haired young woman in the white coat: composed, yet a little wary . . . they showed that sort of thing on television dramas all the time, but when it actually happened . . .  
  
  'Not at all,' Miles was saying. 'Gavin was only playing squash with him on Thursday. '  
  
  'And he seemed all right then?'  
  
  'Oh yeah. Thrashed Gavin. '  
  
  'Good God. Just goes to show you, doesn't it? Just goes to show. Hang on, Mum wants a word. '  
  
  A clunk and a clatter, and Shirley's soft voice came on the line.  
  
  'What a dreadful shock, Miles,' she said. 'Are you all right?'  
  
  Samantha took a clumsy mouthful of coffee; it trickled from the corners of her mouth down the sides of her chin, and she mopped her face and chest with her sleeve. Miles had adopted the voice he often used when speaking to his mother: deeper than usual, a take-command nothing-fazes-me voice, punchy and no-nonsense. Sometimes, especially when drunk, Samantha would imitate Miles and Shirley's conversations. 'Not to worry, Mummy. Miles here. Your little soldier. ' 'Darling, you are wonderful: so big and brave and clever. ' Once or twice, lately, Samantha had done this in front of other people, leaving Miles cross and defensive, though pretending to laugh. There had been a row, last time, in the car going home.  
  
  'You went all the way to the hospital with her?' Shirley was saying from the speakerphone.  
  
  No, thought Samantha, we got bored halfway there and asked to be let out.  
  
  'Least we could do. Wish we could have done more. '  
  
  Samantha got up and walked over to the toaster.  
  
  'I'm sure Mary was very grateful,' said Shirley. Samantha crashed the lid of the bread bin and rammed four pieces of bread into the slots. Miles' voice became more natural.  
  
  'Yeah, well, once the doctors had told - confirmed that he was dead, Mary wanted Colin and Tessa Wall. Sam phoned them, we waited until they arrived and then we left. '  
  
  'Well, it was very lucky for Mary that you were there,' said Shirley. 'Dad wants another word, Miles, I'll put him on. Speak later. '  
  
  '""Speak later,""' Samantha mouthed at the kettle, waggling her head. Her distorted reflection was puffy after their sleepless night, her chestnut-brown eyes bloodshot. In her haste to witness the telling of Howard, Samantha had carelessly rubbed fake tanning lotion into the rims.  
  
  'Why don't you and Sam come over this evening?' Howard was booming. 'No, hang on - Mum's reminded me we're playing bridge with the Bulgens. Come over tomorrow. For dinner. 'Bout seven. '  
  
  'Maybe,' said Miles, glancing at Samantha. 'I'll have to see what Sam's got on. '  
  
  She did not indicate whether or not she wanted to go. A strange sense of anti-climax filled the kitchen as Miles hung up.  
  
  'They can't believe it,' he said, as if she hadn't heard everything.  
  
  They ate their toast and drank fresh mugs of coffee in silence. Some of Samantha's irritability lifted as she chewed. She remembered how she had woken with a jerk in their dark bedroom in the early hours, and had been absurdly relieved and grateful to feel Miles beside her, big and paunchy, smelling of vetiver and old sweat. Then she imagined telling customers at the shop about how a man had dropped dead in front of her, and about the mercy dash to hospital. She thought of ways to describe various aspects of the journey, and of the climactic scene with the doctor. The youth of that self-possessed woman had made the whole thing seem worse. They ought to give the job of breaking the news to someone older. Then, with a further lift of her spirits, she recollected that she had an appointment with the Champ??tre sales rep tomorrow; he had been pleasantly flirty on the telephone.  
  
  'I'd better get moving,' said Miles, and he drained his coffee mug, his eyes on the brightening sky beyond the window. He heaved a deep sigh and patted his wife on her shoulder as he passed on the way to the dishwasher with his empty plate and mug.  
  
  'Christ, it puts everything in perspective, though, doesn't it, eh?'  
  
  Shaking his close-cropped, greying head, he left the kitchen.  
  
  Samantha sometimes found Miles absurd and, increasingly, dull. Every now and then, though, she enjoyed his pomposity in precisely the same spirit as she liked, on formal occasions, to wear a hat. It was appropriate, after all, to be solemn and a little worthy this morning. She finished her toast and cleared away her breakfast things, mentally refining the story she planned to tell her assistant.  
  
  II  
  
  'Barry Fairbrother's dead,' panted Ruth Price.  
  
  She had almost run up the chilly garden path so as to have a few more minutes with her husband before he left for work. She didn't stop in the porch to take off her coat but, st  
ill muffled and gloved, burst into the kitchen where Simon and their teenage sons were eating breakfast.  
  
  Her husband froze, a piece of toast halfway to his lips, then lowered it with theatrical slowness. The two boys, both in school uniform, looked from one parent to the other, mildly interested.  
  
  'An aneurysm, they think,' said Ruth, still a little breathless as she tweaked off her gloves finger by finger, unwinding her scarf and unbuttoning her coat. A thin dark woman with heavy, mournful eyes, the stark blue nurse's uniform suited her. 'He collapsed at the golf club - Sam and Miles Mollison brought him in - and then Colin and Tessa Wall came . . . '  
  
  She darted out to the porch to hang up her things, and was back in time to answer Simon's shouted question.  
  
  'What's ananeurysm?'  
  
  'An. Aneurysm. A burst artery in the brain. '  
  
  She flitted over to the kettle, switched it on, then began to sweep crumbs from the work surface around the toaster, talking all the while.  
  
  'He'll have had a massive cerebral haemorrhage. His poor, poor wife . . . she's absolutely devastated . . . '  
  
  Momentarily stricken, Ruth gazed out of her kitchen window over the crisp whiteness of her frost-crusted lawn, at the abbey across the valley, stark and skeletal against the pale pink and grey sky, and the panoramic view that was the glory of Hilltop House. Pagford, which by night was no more than a cluster of twinkling lights in a dark hollow far below, was emerging into chilly sunlight. Ruth saw none of it: her mind was still at the hospital, watching Mary emerge from the room where Barry lay, all futile aids to life removed. Ruth Price's pity flowed most freely and sincerely for those whom she believed to be like herself. 'No, no, no, no,' Mary had moaned, and that instinctive denial had reverberated inside Ruth, because she had been afforded a glimpse of herself in an identical situation . . .  
  
  Hardly able to bear the thought, she turned to look at Simon. His light-brown hair was still thick, his frame was almost as wiry as it had been in his twenties and the crinkles at the corners of his eyes were merely attractive, but Ruth's return to nursing after a long break had confronted her anew with the million and one ways the human body could malfunction. She had had more detachment when she was young; now she realized how lucky they all were to be alive.  
  
  'Couldn't they do anything for him?' asked Simon. 'Couldn't they plug it up?'  
  
  He sounded frustrated, as though the medical profession had, yet again, bungled the business by refusing to do the simple and obvious thing.  
  
  Andrew thrilled with savage pleasure. He had noticed lately that his father had developed a habit of countering his mother's use of medical terms with crude, ignorant suggestions. Cerebral haemorrhage. Plug it up. His mother didn't realize what his father was up to. She never did. Andrew ate his Weetabix and burned with hatred.  
  
  'It was too late to do anything by the time they got him out to us,' said Ruth, dropping teabags into the pot. 'He died in the ambulance, right before they arrived. '  
  
  'Bloody hell,' said Simon. 'What was he, forty?'  
  
  But Ruth was distracted.  
  
  'Paul, your hair's completely matted at the back. Have you brushed it at all?'  
  
  She pulled a hairbrush from her handbag and pushed it into her younger son's hand.  
  
  'No warning signs or anything?' asked Simon, as Paul dragged the brush through the thick mop of his hair.  
  
  'He'd had a bad headache for a couple of days, apparently. '  
  
  'Ah,' said Simon, chewing toast. 'And he ignored it?'  
  
  'Oh, yes, he didn't think anything of it. '  
  
  Simon swallowed.  
  
  'Goes to show, doesn't it?' he said portentously. 'Got to watch yourself. '  
  
  That's wise, thought Andrew, with furious contempt; that's profound. So it was Barry Fairbrother's own fault his brain had burst open. You self-satisfied fucker, Andrew told his father, loudly, inside his own head.  
  
  Simon pointed his knife at his elder son and said, 'Oh, and by the way. He's going to be getting a job. Old Pizza Face there. '  
  
  Startled, Ruth turned from her husband to her son. Andrew's acne stood out, livid and shiny, from his empurpling cheek, as he stared down into his bowl of beige mush.  
  
  'Yeah,' said Simon. 'Lazy little shit's going to start earning some money. If he wants to smoke, he can pay for it out of his own wages. No more pocket money. '  
  
  'Andrew!' wailed Ruth. 'You haven't been - ?'  
  
  'Oh, yes, he has. I caught him in the woodshed,' said Simon, his expression a distillation of spite.  
  
  'Andrew!'  
  
  'No more money from us. You want fags, you buy 'em,' said Simon.  
  
  'But we said,' whimpered Ruth, 'we said, with his exams coming - '  
  
  'Judging by the way he fucked up his mocks, we'll be lucky if he gets any qualifications. He can get himself out to McDonald's early, get some experience,' said Simon, standing up and pushing in his chair, relishing the sight of Andrew's hanging head, the dark pimpled edge of his face. 'Because we're not supporting you through any resits, pal. It's now or never. '  
  
  'Oh, Simon,' said Ruth reproachfully.  
  
  'What?'  
  
  Simon took two stamping steps towards his wife. Ruth shrank back against the sink. The pink plastic brush fell out of Paul's hand.  
  
  'I'm not going to fund the little fucker's filthy habit! Fucking cheek of him, puffing away in my fucking shed!'  
  
  Simon hit himself on the chest on the word 'my'; the dull thunk made Ruth wince.  
  
  'I was bringing home a salary when I was that spotty little shit's age. If he wants fags, he can pay for them himself, all right? All right?'  
  
  He had thrust his face to within six inches of Ruth's.  
  
  'Yes, Simon,' she said very quietly.  
  
  Andrew's bowels seemed to have become liquid. He had made a vow to himself not ten days previously: had the moment arrived so soon? But his father stepped away from his mother and marched out of the kitchen towards the porch. Ruth, Andrew and Paul remained quite still; they might have promised not to move in his absence.  
  
  'Did you fill up the tank?' Simon shouted, as he always did when she had been working a night shift.  
  
  'Yes,' Ruth called back, striving for brightness, for normality.  
  
  The front door rattled and slammed.  
  
  Ruth busied herself with the teapot, waiting for the billowing atmosphere to shrink back to its usual proportions. Only when Andrew was about to leave the room to clean his teeth did she speak.  
  
  'He worries about you, Andrew. About your health. '  
  
  Like fuck he does, the cunt.  
  
  Inside his head, Andrew matched Simon obscenity for obscenity. Inside his head, he could take Simon in a fair fight.  
  
  Aloud, to his mother, he said, 'Yeah. Right. '  
  
  III  
  
  Evertree Crescent was a sickle moon of 1930s bungalows, which lay two minutes from Pagford's main square. In number thirty-six, a house tenanted longer than any other in the street, Shirley Mollison sat, propped up against her pillows, sipping the tea that her husband had brought her. The reflection facing her in the mirrored doors of the built-in wardrobe had a misty quality, due partly to the fact that she was not wearing glasses, and partly to the soft glow cast over the room by her rose-patterned curtains. In this flattering, hazy light, the dimpled pink and white face beneath the short silver hair was cherubic.  
  
  The bedroom was just large enough to accommodate Shirley's single bed and Howard's double, crammed together, non-identical twins. Howard's mattress, which still bore his prodigious imprint, was empty. The soft purr and hiss of the shower was audible from where Shirley and her rosy reflection sat facing each other, savouring the news that seemed still to effervesce in the atmosphere, like bubbling champagne.  
  
  Barry Fairbrother was dead. Snuffed out. Cut down. No event of national importance, no war, no stock-market collapse, no terrorist attack, could have sparked in Shirley the awe, the avid interest and feverish speculation that currently consumed her.  
  
  She had hated  
Barry Fairbrother. Shirley and her husband, usually as one in all their friendships and enmities, had been a little out of step in this. Howard had sometimes confessed himself entertained by the bearded little man who opposed him so relentlessly across the long scratched tables in Pagford Church Hall; but Shirley made no distinction between the political and the personal. Barry had opposed Howard in the central quest of his life, and this made Barry Fairbrother her bitter enemy.  
  
  Loyalty to her husband was the main, but not the only, reason for Shirley's passionate dislike. Her instincts about people were finely honed in one direction only, like a dog that has been trained to sniff out narcotics. She was perennially aquiver to detect condescension, and had long detected its reek in the attitudes of Barry Fairbrother and his cronies on the Parish Council. The Fairbrothers of the world assumed that their university education made them better than people like her and Howard, that their views counted for more. Well, their arrogance had received a nasty blow today. Fairbrother's sudden death bolstered Shirley in the long-held belief that, whatever he and his followers might have thought, he had been of a lower and weaker order than her husband, who, in addition to all his other virtues, had managed to survive a heart attack seven years previously.  
  
  (Never for an instant had Shirley believed that her Howard would die, even while he was in the operating theatre. Howard's presence on earth was, to Shirley, a given, like sunlight and oxygen. She had said as much afterwards, when friends and neighbours had spoken of miraculous escapes and how lucky that they had the cardiac unit so nearby in Yarvil, and how dreadfully worried she must have been.  
  
  'I always knew he'd pull through,' Shirley had said, unruffled and serene. 'I never doubted it. '  
  
  And here he was, as good as ever; and there was Fairbrother in the morgue. It only went to show. )  
  
  In the elation of this early morning, Shirley was reminded of the day after her son Miles had been born. She had sat up in bed all those years ago, exactly like this, with sunlight streaming through the ward window, a cup of tea that somebody else had made her in her hands, waiting for them to bring in her beautiful new baby boy for feeding. Birth and death: there was the same consciousness of heightened existence and of her own elevated importance. The news of Barry Fairbrother's sudden demise lay in her lap like a fat new baby to be gloated over by all her acquaintances; and she would be the fount, the source, for she was first, or nearly so, to receive the news.  
  
  None of the delight frothing and fizzing inside Shirley had been apparent while Howard had been in the room. They had merely exchanged the comments proper to sudden death before he had taken himself off to the shower. Naturally Shirley had known, as they slid stock words and phrases back and forth between them like beads on an abacus, that Howard must be as brimful of ecstasy as she was; but to express these feelings out loud, when the news of the death was still fresh in the air, would have been tantamount to dancing naked and shrieking obscenities, and Howard and Shirley were clothed, always, in an invisible layer of decorum that they never laid aside.  
  
  Another happy thought came to Shirley. She set down her cup and saucer on the bedside table, slipped out of bed, pulled on her candlewick dressing gown and her glasses, and padded down the hall to tap on the bathroom door.  
  
  'Howard?'  
  
  An interrogative noise answered over the steady patter of the shower.  
  
  'Do you think I should put something on the website? About Fairbrother?'  
  
  'Good idea,' he called through the door, after a moment's consideration. 'Excellent idea. '  
  
  So she bustled along to the study. It had previously been the smallest bedroom in the bungalow, long since vacated by their daughter Patricia who had gone to London and was rarely mentioned.  
  
  Shirley was immensely proud of her skill on the internet. She had been to evening classes in Yarvil ten years previously, where she had been one of the oldest students and the slowest. Nevertheless, she had persevered, determined to be the administrator of Pagford Parish Council's exciting new website. She logged herself in and brought up the Parish Council's homepage.  
  
  The brief statement flowed so easily that it was as if her fingers themselves were composing it.  
  
  Councillor Barry Fairbrother  
  
  It is with great regret that we announce the death of Councillor Barry Fairbrother. Our thoughts are with his family at this difficult time.  
  
  She read this through carefully, hit return and watched the message appear on the message board.  
  
  The Queen had lowered the flag on Buckingham Palace when Princess Diana had died. Her Majesty occupied a very special position in Shirley's interior life. Contemplating the message on the website, she was satisfied and happy that she had done the right thing. Learning from the best . . .  
  
  She navigated away from the Parish Council message board and dropped into her favourite medical website, where she painstakingly entered the words 'brain' and 'death' in the search box.  
  
  The suggestions were endless. Shirley scrolled through the possibilities, her mild eyes rolling up and down, wondering to which of these deadly conditions, some of them unpronounceable, she owed her present happiness. Shirley was a hospital volunteer; she had developed quite a little interest in matters medical since starting work at South West General, and occasionally offered diagnoses to her friends.  
  
  But there was no concentrating on long words and symptoms this morning: her thoughts skittered away to the further dissemination of the news; already she was mentally assembling and reshuffling a list of telephone numbers. She wondered whether Aubrey and Julia knew, and what they would say; and whether Howard would let her tell Maureen or reserve that pleasure for himself.  
  
  It was all immensely exciting.  
  
  IV  
  
  Andrew Price closed the front door of the small white house and followed his younger brother down the steep garden path, crunchy with frost, that led to the icy metal gate in the hedge and the lane beyond. Neither boy spared a glance for the familiar view spread out below them: the tiny town of Pagford cupped in a hollow between three hills, one of which was crested with the remains of the twelfth-century abbey. A thin river snaked around the edge of the hill and through town, straddled by a toy stone bridge. The scene was dull as a flat-painted backdrop to the brothers; Andrew despised the way that, on the rare occasions when the family had guests, his father seemed to take credit for it, as though he had designed and built the whole thing. Andrew had lately decided that he would prefer an outlook of asphalt, broken windows and graffiti; he dreamed of London and of a life that mattered.  
  
  The brothers marched to the end of the lane, ambling to a halt on the corner where they met the wider road. Andrew reached into the hedge, groped around for a while, then drew out a half-full packet of Benson & Hedges and a slightly damp box of matches. After several false starts, the heads of the matches crumbling against the strike, he succeeded in lighting up. Two or three deep drags, and then the grumbling engine of the school bus broke the stillness. Andrew carefully knocked out the glowing head of his cigarette and stowed the rest back in the packet.  
  
  The bus was always two-thirds full by the time it reached the turning for Hilltop House, because it had already skirted outlying farms and houses. The brothers sat apart as usual, each of them taking a double seat and turning to stare out of the window as the bus rumbled and lurched on down into Pagford.  
  
  At the foot of their hill was a house that stood in a wedge-shaped garden. The four Fairbrother children usually waited outside the front gate, but there was nobody there today. The curtains were all closed. Andrew wondered whether you usually sat in the dark when somebody died.  
  
  A few weeks previously, Andrew had got off with Niamh Fairbrother, one of Barry's twin daughters, at a disco in the school drama hall. She had shown a distasteful tendency to shadow his movements for a while afterwards. Andrew's parents were barely acquainted with the Fairbrothers; Simon and Ruth had hardly any friends, but they seemed to have had a tepid liking for Barry, who had  
managed the minuscule branch of the only bank still present in Pagford. Fairbrother's name had cropped up a lot in connection with such things as the Parish Council, town hall theatricals, and the Church Fun Run. These were things in which Andrew had no interest and from which his parents held themselves aloof, excepting the occasional sponsorship form or raffle ticket.  
  
  As the bus turned left and trundled down Church Row, past the spacious Victorian houses ranged in descending tiers, Andrew indulged in a little fantasy in which his father dropped dead, gunned down by an invisible sniper. Andrew visualized himself patting his sobbing mother on the back while he telephoned the undertaker. He had a cigarette in his mouth as he ordered the cheapest coffin.  
  
  The three Jawandas, Jaswant, Sukhvinder and Rajpal, got on the bus at the bottom of Church Row. Andrew had carefully chosen a seat with an empty place in front of it, and he willed Sukhvinder to sit in front of him, not for her own sake (Andrew's best friend Fats referred to her as TNT, short for 'Tits 'N' Tash'), but because She so often chose to sit beside Sukhvinder. And whether because his telepathic promptings were particularly powerful this morning or not, Sukhvinder did indeed choose the seat in front. Jubilant, Andrew stared, unseeing, at the grimy window, and clutched his school bag more closely to him, to conceal the erection brought on by the heavy vibration of the bus.  
  
  Anticipation mounted with every fresh pitch and heave, as the cumbersome vehicle edged its way through the narrow streets, around the tight corner into the village square and towards the corner of Her road.  
  
  Andrew had never experienced this intensity of interest in any girl. She was newly arrived; an odd time to change schools, the spring term of the GCSE year. Her name was Gaia, and that was fitting, because he had never heard it before, and she was something entirely new. She had walked onto the bus one morning like a simple statement of the sublime heights to which nature could reach and sat herself down two seats in front of him, while he sat transfixed by the perfection of her shoulders and the back of her head.  
  
  She would be here any minute, and if she sat beside square and sulky Sukhvinder, as she so often did, she would be close enough to smell the nicotine on him. He liked to see inanimate objects react to her body; liked to see the bus seat give a little as she dropped her weight into it, and that copper-gold mass of hair curve against the steel bar at the top.  
  
  The bus driver slowed, and Andrew turned his face away from the door, pretending to be lost in contemplation; he would look around when she got on, as if he had only just realized that they had stopped; he would make eye contact, possibly nod. He waited to hear the doors open, but the soft throb of the engine was not interrupted by the familiar grind and thump.  
  
  Andrew glanced around and saw nothing but short, shabby little Hope Street: two lines of small terraced houses. The bus driver was leaning over to make sure she was not coming. Andrew wanted to tell him to wait, because only the previous week she had burst from one of those little houses and come running up the pavement (it had been acceptable to watch, because everyone had been watching), and the sight of her running had been enough to occupy his thoughts for hours, but the driver hauled at the big wheel and the bus set off again. Andrew returned to his contemplation of the dirty window with an ache in his heart and in his balls.  
  
  V  
  
  The small terraces in Hope Street had once been labourers' houses. Gavin Hughes was shaving slowly and with unnecessary care in the bathroom of number ten. He was so fair, and his beard so sparse, that the job really only needed to be done twice weekly; but the chilly, slightly grubby bathroom was the only place of sanctuary. If he dawdled in here until eight, he could plausibly say he needed to leave for work immediately. He dreaded having to talk to Kay.  
  
  He had only managed to head off discussion the previous evening by initiating the most prolonged and inventive coupling they had enjoyed since the very earliest days of their relationship. Kay had responded immediately and with unnerving enthusiasm: flicking herself from position to position; drawing up her strong, stocky legs for him; contorting like the Slavic acrobat she so closely resembled, with her olive skin and very short dark hair. Too late, he had realized that she was taking this uncharacteristic act of assertion as a tacit confession of those things he was determined to avoid saying. She had kissed him greedily; he had found her wet intrusive kisses erotic when the affair began, now he found them vaguely repellent. He took a long time to climax, his horror at what he had started constantly threatening to deflate his erection. Even this worked against him: she seemed to take his unusual stamina as a display of virtuosity.  
  
  When at last it was over, she had cuddled close to him in the darkness and stroked his hair for a while. Miserably he stared into the void, aware that after all his vague plans for loosening the ties, he had involuntarily tightened them. After she had fallen asleep, he had lain with one arm trapped underneath her, the damp sheet adhering unpleasantly to his thigh, on a mattress lumpy with old springs, and wished for the courage to be a bastard, to slip away and never return.  
  
  Kay's bathroom smelt of mould and damp sponges. A number of hairs were stuck to the side of the small bath. Paint was peeling off the walls.  
  
  'It needs some work,' Kay had said.  
  
  Gavin had been careful not to volunteer any help. The things he had not said to her were his talisman and safeguard; he strung them together in his mind and checked them off like beads on a rosary. He had never said 'love'. He had never talked about marriage. He had never asked her to move to Pagford. And yet, here she was, and somehow, she made him feel responsible.  
  
  His face stared back at him from out of the tarnished mirror. There were purple shadows under his eyes, and his thinning blond hair was wispy and dry. The naked bulb overhead lit the weak, goaty face with forensic cruelty.  
  
  Thirty-four, he thought, and I look at least forty.  
  
  He lifted the razor and delicately strafed off those two thick blond hairs that grew either side of his prominent Adam's apple.  
  
  Fists pummelled the bathroom door. Gavin's hand slipped and blood dripped from his thin neck to speckle his clean white shirt.  
  
  'Your boyfriend,' came a furious female scream, 'is still in the bathroom and I am going to be late!'  
  
  'I've finished!' he shouted.  
  
  The gash stung, but what did that matter? Here was his excuse, ready-made: Look what your daughter made me do. I'll have to go home and change my shirt before work. With an almost light heart he grabbed the tie and jacket he had hung over the hook on the back of the door, and unlocked it.  
  
  Gaia pushed past, slammed the door behind her and rammed the lock home. Out on the tiny landing, which was thick with an unpleasant smell of burnt rubber, Gavin remembered the headboard banging against the wall last night, the creaking of the cheap pine bed, Kay's groans and yelps. It was easy to forget, sometimes, that her daughter was in the house.  
  
  He jogged down the carpetless stairs. Kay had told him of her plans to sand and polish them, but he doubted that she would ever do it; her flat in London had been shabby and in poor repair. In any case, he was convinced that she was expecting to move in with him quite soon, but he would not allow it; that was the final bastion, and there, if forced, he would make his stand.  
  
  'What have you done to yourself?' Kay squealed, catching sight of the blood on his shirt. She was wearing the cheap scarlet kimono that he did not like, but which suited her so well.  
  
  'Gaia banged on the door and made me jump. I'm going to have to go home and change. '  
  
  'Oh, but I've made you breakfast!' she said quickly.  
  
  He realized that the smell of burning rubber was actually scrambled eggs. They looked anaemic and overcooked.  
  
  'I can't, Kay, I've got to change this shirt, I've got an early - '  
  
  She was already spooning the congealed mass onto plates.  
  
  'Five minutes, surely you can stay five - ?'  
  
  The mobile phone in his jacket pocket buzzed loudly and he pulled it out, wondering whether  
he would have the nerve to pretend that it was an urgent summons.  
  
  'Jesus Christ,' he said, in unfeigned horror.  
  
  'What's the matter?'  
  
  'Barry. Barry Fairbrother! He's . . . fuck, he's . . . he's dead! It's from Miles. Jesus Christ. Jesus fucking Christ!'  
  
  She laid down the wooden spoon.  
  
  'Who's Barry Fairbrother?'  
  
  'I play squash with him. He's only forty-four! Jesus Christ!'  
  
  He read the text message again. Kay watched him, confused. She knew that Miles was Gavin's partner at the solicitor's, but had never been introduced to him. Barry Fairbrother was no more than a name to her.  
  
  There came a thunderous banging from the stairs: Gaia was stamping as she ran.  
  
  'Eggs,' she stated, at the kitchen door. 'Like you make me every morning. Not. And thanks to him,' with a venomous look at the back of Gavin's head, 'I've probably missed the bloody bus. '  
  
  'Well, if you hadn't spent so long doing your hair,' Kay shouted at the figure of her retreating daughter, who did not respond, but stormed down the hall, her bag bouncing off the walls, and slammed the front door behind her.  
  
  'Kay, I've got to go,' said Gavin.  
  
  'But look, I've got it all ready, you could have it before - '  
  
  'I've got to change my shirt. And, shit, I did Barry's will for him, I'll need to look it out. No, I'm sorry, I've got to go. I can't believe it,' he added, rereading Miles' text. 'I can't believe it. We only played squash on Thursday. I can't - Jesus. '  
  
  A man had died; there was nothing she could say, not without putting herself in the wrong. He kissed her briefly on her unresponsive mouth, and then walked away, up the dark narrow hall.  
  
  'Will I see you - ?'  
  
  'I'll call you later,' he shouted over her, pretending not to hear.  
  
  Gavin hurried across the road to his car, gulping the crisp, cold air, holding the fact of Barry's death in his mind like a phial of volatile liquid that he dare not agitate. As he turned the key in the ignition, he imagined Barry's twin daughters crying, face down in their bunk beds. He had seen them lying like that, one above the other, each playing on a Nintendo DS, when he passed the door of their bedroom the very last time he had gone round for dinner.  
  
  The Fairbrothers had been the most devoted couple he knew. He would never eat at their house again. He used to tell Barry how lucky he was. Not so lucky after all.  
  
  Someone was coming down the pavement towards him; in a panic that it was Gaia, coming to shout at him or to demand a lift, he reversed too hard and hit the car behind him: Kay's old Vauxhall Corsa. The passer-by drew level with his window, and was revealed to be an emaciated, hobbling old woman in carpet slippers. Sweating, Gavin swung his steering wheel around and squeezed out of the space. As he accelerated, he glanced in the rear-view mirror and saw Gaia letting herself back into Kay's house.  
  
  He was having difficulty getting enough air into his lungs. There was a tight knot in his chest. Only now did he realize that Barry Fairbrother had been his best friend.  
  
  VI  
  
  The school bus had reached the Fields, the sprawling estate that lay on the outskirts of the city of Yarvil. Dirty grey houses, some of them spray-painted with initials and obscenities; the occasional boarded window; satellite dishes and overgrown grass - none of it was any more worthy of Andrew's sustained attention than the ruined abbey of Pagford, glittering with frost. Andrew had once been intrigued and intimidated by the Fields, but familiarity had long since rendered it all commonplace.  
  
  The pavements swarmed with children and teenagers walking towards school, many of them in T-shirts, despite the cold. Andrew spotted Krystal Weedon, byword and dirty joke. She was bouncing along, laughing uproariously, in the middle of a mixed group of teenagers. Multiple earrings swung from each ear, and the string of her thong was clearly visible above her low-slung tracksuit bottoms. Andrew had known her since primary school, and she featured in many of the most highly coloured memories of his extreme youth. They had jeered at her name, but instead of crying, as most of the little girls would have done, five-year-old Krystal had caught on, cackled and shrieked, 'Weed-on! Krystal weed-on!' And she had pulled down her pants in the middle of class and pretended to do it. He retained a vivid memory of her bare pink vulva; it was as though Father Christmas had popped up in their midst; and he remembered Miss Oates, bright red in the face, marching Krystal from the room.

1lxz2gx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1lxz2gx/his_laugh_made_my_eyes_prickle_hey_love_bug/,"His laugh made my eyes prickle. ""Hey love bug.","Please don't do this."" I begged over and over, but no one was listening. ""I am your luna."" I screamed at the top of my lungs, but then his laugh from the other room broke all the fight in me.

""Luke please."" I begged once more time, my voice horse.

""Take it once it's done. Toss her out. She will have to survive on her own from here on out.""

He can't mean that. This was our baby.

""Is a mistake from the Moon Goddess. One I will rectify."" His voice called again from the other room. He wouldn't even face me. ""Now do it. That's a command.""

""Yes, Alpha.""

""Oh, and doctor?"" Her sweet voice called from the other room. My stepsister, Shannon. I gritted my teeth. ""Don't use any anesthetic. She should feel everything.""

""Yes, Luna."" The doctor turned back to me with sad eyes, but when he picked up the scalpel, I knew I was screwed.

I'm sorry, baby. Momma couldn't save you. I tried to rub my stomach, but the nurses had strapped me down. When the doctor approached, I realized he was using a silver blade.

""Silver?"" My whisper was almost silent, but he nodded. I knew then that Shannon didn't want me to survive. She wanted my life so badly that she lied about me cheating on my mate, showing photos as proof.

I cried silently as the doctor cut into my abdomen, and I felt my baby thrash inside. He knew it was too early to be born. This was a death sentence for both of us.

""Bring me the body of the pup.""

""Yes Alpha.""

I felt every slice as he cut into me, and finally I could take it no longer. I thrashed against the restraints. But the silver had made me weak.

""Doctor, now.""

""Yes Alpha."" The doctor picked the baby up and rushed out, leaving me spread open to the elements.

I felt my life slipping away as the door opened and Shannon came in. Her smug smile was firmly in place.

""I told you I would take your life, Amy. I would have your mate. "" Shannon walked over and laid a kiss on my face as I snarled. ""He is perfection. And don't worry. I will give him another son."" She laid her hand on her stomach and I started to laugh. ""What's so funny?""

""I can smell the beta on you. That's Derek's child, and it's a girl. Nice try though.""

She snarled and raised her hand, growing her claws to deliver the final blow, but the door was ripped open and my mate, the man I now hated most in the world, stepped inside. His eyes were red, and I started to laugh again.

""You runt!"" He snarled and struck out, whipping Shannon to the other side of the room.

""Brandon!"" Shannon shrieked as she hit the wall. ""What's wrong?"" She staggered to her feet, but more blood dripped out of me and I closed my eyes.

""You lied!"" He screamed, shaking the walls as his aura struck out, but I could barely feel it. I felt the silver travelling in my veins getting closer to my sluggish heart. ""This was my pup. I can smell me on him."" Brandon's eyes grew redder as the tears gathered. ""She did cheat on you. I guess I was wrong about the pup.""

""You said you smelt it."" From the sound of it, he lunged for her again, but him clutching our baby in his arm was the last thing I saw. And I wanted to never see it again. He did this to us. Not Shannon.

She played her part well, sure, but him not believing me, not waiting for a few more days to smell the pup, that was his fault. And all of our downfalls.

I prayed for the moon goddess to take me. I no longer wanted to be here. I wanted to be with my pup.

""Save her.""

""No!"" Shannon screamed. ""I am the Luna now, you marked me last night."" Ah, so that was the pain I felt last night.

I cracked my eyes to see my mate, Brandon, hovering next to me. ""Stay with me Amy.""

""No!"" I slammed out, putting all of my power in it.

Brandon looked down at me, pleading. ""Let me save you.""

""I am descended from the Moon Goddess, and you don't deserve to save me. You don't deserve our pup. You were weak. And now you lost everything."" I smiled up at him as I felt my life from my body.

Chapter Two

I opened my eyes to find myself surprisingly alive. ""Amy hurry, you're going to be late."" I jolted up and look around, confused. What was going on? Where was I? ""Amy!"" The voice called again and I shook myself. I stood up from the bed and looked around again. I recognized this room. It was my childhood bedroom.

I hadn't stepped foot in this room since I found my mate, Brandon. I heard a knock on the door and my mother opened it. Before I could process what was happening, I ran into my mother's arms. ""Mom, you're here."" I started to cry. ""I've missed you so much.""

""Amy. My girl."" She laughed as she patted my back. ""I saw you yesterday."" She pulled back and I looked into her amber eyes that matched my own. ""Happy birthday, baby.""

I leaned into her hands and realized that today was the last day I spent at home. I found my mate on my eighteenth birthday. ""Thank you, mom.""

""Hopefully, you will meet your mate today and start your new life."" She smiled at me and I felt my blood freeze. I didn't want to meet Brandon. Not when I knew what was going to happen.

""I'd rather stay here with you."" I smiled as I kissed her cheek. ""I don't want to miss you and Morgan.

And I knew that when Brandon thought I cheated on him, before he treated my baby and me like that. He also did the same to my mother for her involvement. Shannon's father, my mother's husband, watched her die.

""Baby. You won't miss us. We will be there every step of the way."" She kissed my cheek, and I wrapped my fingers around hers.

""Mom, can we just leave? You and me? Leave Shannon and Morgan and move back to daddy's pack?"" My father, the Alpha of the Silvermoon pack, wasn't a good husband, but he was a good man. He cheated on my mother, betraying her when he was drunk.

His betrayal cost the life of my brother growing inside of her, and she refused to move past it.

""No baby. I can't go back."" My mother's face fell as she turned away.

""I don't want to be betrayed, mom. Not like you and not any worse. I don't want a mate."" I whispered my new truth.

""What do you know?"" I watched as her eyes searched mine.

I pulled her back into my room and away from the door. ""I don't know for sure, but I am terrified that if I am mated to Shannon's boyfriend, I will die after we are mated. Mom, the chances that he will match with an Alpha far outweigh the chance that he is mated to the daughter of the beta."" I pulled back. ""I don't want this for me.""

She weighed my words, and I watched as she came to the same conclusion. ""Okay baby. But you can't leave. It would be too conspicuous. You will have to mask your scent whenever he is around.""

I tossed my hands in the air. ""How would I do that?""

""There is much you don't know that I would leave in the past but if you are sure..."" She trailed off and I just nodded my head. ""Then let me make a few calls. You don't have to go to school today.""

I lept back into her arms. ""Thank you, mom. I don't know what I would do without you.""

""I love you, baby. You will never be without me. That I can promise you."" She kissed my cheek and then left me alone in my room.

I ran to my phone and checked the date to make sure. It was twenty eighteen; I went back six years. Six years to the day that I met Brandon. I could relive everything, make better choices. I could live, and maybe this time around, so would my pup.

I went into my ensuite and jumped into the shower. No way was I going to face today, looking like I just crawled out of bed. I stood in side my closet in a towel trying to figure out what to wear when I heard my bedroom door open.

I was about to turn and call out to my mother, but I heard a soft step, which my mother wouldn't do. So I hid behind my winter coats and I waited.

""I'm telling you, if she is Brandon's mate, I'm going to destroy her.""

""You can't mean that, Shan."" The nasily voice of Megan, Shannon's best friend, came from the cell phone pressed to her ear.

""Of course I do. Brandon is mine.""

""Only because you put out. He was hoping Shannon would notice him.""

""You shut your mouth, Megan."" Shannon snarled and her eyes flashed. ""He's mine.""

""Whatever I gotta go,"" Megan called, and then the line went dead. A honk sounded from outside and Shannon was snatching something before I grabbed her hand.

""What do you think you're doing in my closet?""

""Amy?"" Shannon's mouth dropped out. I squeezed her hand until I heard a crack. Her scream was muffled by my hand.

""You're lucky I only broke one finger. You just threatened to destroy me. Didn't I hear that correctly? A beta's daughter threatening an alpha."" I tsked.

""I didn't do anything."" She snarled back at me as her hand reformed.

""Lie again and I will break all of your fingers and hold them while the bones heal."" I couldn't stop my grin as I felt her tremble. ""Did you threaten me?""

""Yes."" she screamed at me. ""You're going to take Brandon from me.""

""I don't want your pathetic alpha now or ever. Keep him."" I pushed her away. ""Now get out of my room before I change my mind about maiming you."" I turned back to my clothes and picked out low-rise jeans and a tank top.

""What is your problem?""

""You. Now leave."" I let my wolf come forward and my eyes flashed. I pushed my alpha command into my words and forcing her out of my room. Foolish girl. How dare she come into my room to take something of mine? My wolf growled lowly. This was our den. I shook myself and refocused. Closing the doors, I hopped back into bed, pulling out my phone. I tried to remember everything that happened in the last six years that could help me with my plan. Because make no mistake, Brandon and Shannon would pay.

Chapter Three

""Pack your bags, Amy."" My mom came in, surprising me from the list I was making.

""What?"" I looked up. ""Why?""

""You are going to spend the summer with your father. I already got the approval from the Alpha."" Mom smiled down at me. ""Come on, baby. Pack your bag and get ready.""

I jumped to my feet and ran to my mom. ""I can go?""

""Just for the summer, baby, then you will be back here with me. I had to promise that you would be returning here.""

I pouted. ""Mom, I really don't want to be here."" I wanted to make them pay, but I wouldn't risk him finding me.

""It's okay baby, you will understand once you see your dad."" She patted my hair and kissed my cheek. ""Now get ready.""

""Okay mom."" I kissed her back then she left me alone. I grabbed my phone to lock it and then turned back to my closet. I packed my bag and then headed into my bathroom when I heard the downstairs door slam open.

""I knew it."" I heard Shannon scream down stairs. I ignored her as I grabbed everything from my bathroom and then I grabbed my laptop and chargers. I stuffed everything in to my backpack and headed downstairs.

""Shannon, why are you screaming?"" Morgan was at the table with his coffee, and my mom was running around when I pushed my suitcase into the room.

""I'm not Brandon's mate, daddy."" Shannon flew into the room and dove into his arms.

""How are you so sure?"" Morgan wrapped his arms around her, but I just snickered. She snapped her eyes to me and she flew at me.

""It's you."" Shannon tried to claw out my eyes. But I just sent her flying with a backhand.

""Amy!"" Morgan got to his feet but my mom tsked.

""Morgan, you can't yell ay Amy for protecting herself. Shan attacked her first."" My mom placed my breakfast on the table. ""Amy, come eat. You have a long day ahead.""

""Babe? Why does Amy have a suitcase?""

""She is going away for the summer. To her fathers."" My mother turned to me and opened her arms. ""Come baby. Come eat. The car is coming and you need to be ready to go.""

I walked over and sat down, and dug in.

""Why is she going to her dads?"" Morgan walked over to pick Shannon up.

""She wanted to spend the summer with her dads before college and who am I to say no?"" My mom smiled down at me and I smiled back at her. I didn't know what was going to happen this summer to protect me from Brandon finding out I was his mate, but I needed it. Whatever it was, I needed it.

""Yeah, my dad called me this morning and since I haven't seen him since Christmas break and when he offered to fly me out, I asked my mom."" I smiled sweetly over at Morgan, and Shannon smiled.

""You're leaving?"" Shannon stood up.

""Yup. I'll be gone the full summer."" I smirked over at her. ""But my room is locked, and it will stay that way."" My smile dropped away as I stared at her and used my alpha command.

""Amy!"" Morgan yelled out. ""You know you're not allowed to alpha command your step sister!""

""And I wouldn't have Morgan, if I hdn't found her in my room this morning, trying to take things out of my closet."" I turned and raised my eyebrow, daring her to try to lie.

""Is that true?"" Morgan looked down at Shannon and I just stared at her. I watch her open her mouth to deny it.

""I wouldn't lie. I'll just command you to tell the truth."" She screeched and stomped her foot.

""Yes!"" she screamed. ""Are you happy? Yes, I went into her closet to steal some clothes because I know she is Brandon's mate.""

""How?"" I threw up my hands, playing like I didn't know the truth. ""How could you possibly know that I am his mate? Neither of us has scented each other.""

""Because he scented you on me!"" Her voice was hitting a higher octave, and my ears were starting to hurt.

""Calm down. You're hurting everyone's ears and just explain yourself."" My mom sat next to me at the table, rubbing her head.

""Last month, Brandon turned eighteen, and I was wearing Amy's dress. He scented around me and said I smelt divine. But when I'm not wearing her clothes, he has zero interest in me."" Shannon pouted.

""So he likes the way I smell, doesn't mean we are mates."" I pointed out. Completely and utterly denouncing Brandon as a mate. If I didn't accept him, he would never be my mate anyway, and I would never accept him. That was the only thing I was sure of.

Brandon would be the last male I would ever touch this time around.

""Stop being obtuse Amy. We all know what it means when a wolf likes your smell."" Shannon started to cry and buried her head in her hands. ""He's the male I want, daddy. The only one I would ever accept. But he wants her."" She pointed to me.

I scoffed. ""I don't want your sloppy seconds, Shannon. Even if he was my mate, and I am not saying he is. It would be a cold day before I accepted him as a mate. I would take the Lycan King over Brandon."" I threw my head back and laughed when she gasped.

The Lycan king was the bogeyman of all wolves.

The last Lycan to exist and one who lives in the wild. It's said the only wolves that ever see his face are the council that oversees the packs.

But either way, I wasn't lying. I would take the King as a mate before I would even look in Brandon's vicinity.

""You're lying. He's the alpha.""

""And?""

""Everyone wants to be the luna.""

""Idiots want to be the luna."" I turned back and finished my food as Morgan calmed her down. My mom stood when she heard a horn.

""That's for you.""

I nodded as I stood and kissed my mother goodbye before I left.

Chapter Four

I slipped into the back of the car after putting my bags in the back and buckled in. I had barely takin a breath before I launched myself over the seats and into the driver's arms.

His laugh made my eyes prickle. ""Hey love bug.""

""Uncle Ronnie. I've missed you."" I climbed over the seats and sat up front. ""What are you doing here?"" Ronnie was my dad's beta. Not related, but he had been there for most of my life.

""You think I was going to let my cheeky niece come to pack lands alone? Not on your life.""

""Dad sent you?"" I laughed.

""Dad sent me. He is a worry wart your da."" He smiled over and laughed with me. ""As soon as your mom called, he sent me with the jet.""

""He didn't have to."" I just shook my head and buckled my seatbelt.

""Of course he did. He never gets to see you enough, and now you're sending in the summer. What's going on?"" My uncle looked at me and I just shook my head.

""I don't want to be here.""

""Why?""

I looked down at my hands that were twisted. ""I'm afraid that my mate is here and I don't want to be right. I figured if I ran away, I could push off the inevitability.""

""Why wouldn; t you want your mate?"" My uncle asked as he zipped down the highway toward the airport.

""I'll tell both you and dad, just not now."" My uncle looked over at me, searching my face and then nodding.",1,1752322706.0,BlackNovel,1,1.0,False

At Tatsunokuchi, Nichiren casts off his transient status and reveals ""The Buddha of Limitless Joy."" This morning it is my turn!","I am very excited to keep studying the first section of the July installment of Daisaku Ikeda’s lecture on “The Opening of the Eyes.” It is entitled [‘The Opening of the Eyes’ Is a Paean of Victory](https://www.worldtribune.org/2025/the-three-powerful-enemies-part-1-the-anatomyof-persecution-arising-from-fundamental-darkness/). 

Let me start with a bit from MY Fantasy Life. 

*The big tell-all AMA coffee with MY Fantasy Life Hockey Mom friends starts in a couple of hours. Dee is baking her acorns (yes, you read that right!) muffins for us. We hired our consultants to babysit for our and their kids. We asked the lifeguard to come in early.*

*At my therapy session yesterday, my doctor provided coaching on icebreaking, how to maintain barriers and comfort levels for all (including me), and being aware of my tendency to talk much too much especially when I’m nervous.*

*”You have to remember, Julie, that your goal is to win support for your school construction project; you are not there to entertain or to provide grounds for gossip. You have to balance taking risks yourself and asking them to take risks. I mean after all, they are hockey moms who can be as competitive as the young players on ice. You need the eyes and ears to see people who you will not be able to win over. Be in control and pace yourself, don’t rush! You are very trustful, transparent, and sincere--but that doesn't mean that they are. You need to do a lot of your Buddhist chanting.”*

Good point and I hope to report tomorrow on what transpires. In the meanwhile, let's jump back to Daisaku Ikeda’s lecture. He next cites Nichiren’s interpretation of the Tatsunokuchi Persecution.

***On the twelfth day of the ninth month of last year [1271, on the occasion of the Tatsunokuchi Persecution], between the hours of the rat and the ox (11:00 p.m. to 3:00 a.m.), this person named Nichiren was beheaded. It is his soul that has come to this island of Sado and, in the second month of the following year, snowbound, is writing this to send to his close disciples. [The description of the evil age in the “Encouraging Devotion” chapter seems] terrible, but [one who cares nothing about oneself for the sake of the Law has] nothing to be frightened about. Others reading it will be terrified. This scriptural passage is the bright mirror that Shakyamuni, Many Treasures, and the Buddhas of the ten directions left for the future of Japan, and in which the present state of the country is reflected. (WND-1, 269)”***

Daisaku Ikeda comments: 

>At the beginning of his discussion on the twenty-line verse section, the Daishonin explains the significance of his undergoing the Tatsunokuchi Persecution. In other words, he starts by revealing his state of life in having vanquished the three powerful enemies. It is a declaration of spiritual triumph. This important passage signifies that “The Opening of the Eyes” as a whole can be viewed as a paean of victory. 

Wow! “A paean of victory”! I feel deeply in my heart that if I am able to win the support of my half dozen or so friends, our bond issue will be successful! 

Dr. Ikeda:

>In writing “this person named Nichiren was beheaded,” he is declaring that his status up to that time—in which he conducted himself as an ordinary person—came to an end at Tatsunokuchi. 

>The Daishonin is indicating here that at Tatsunokuchi he cast off his transient status and revealed his true identity. He uses the word *soul* to refer to that true identity—the Buddha of limitless joy enlightened since time without beginning. His soul, he says, has come to Sado. This represents a declaration of his state of life, his towering resolve from his place of exile to henceforth, as the original Buddha of the Latter Day, take the lead for the widespread propagation of the Mystic Law. 

Let me cast off a bit of my transient status this morning, vanquish some inner and outer powerful enemies,  declare some spiritual triumph, and reveal a bit of my “Buddha of limitless joy!”

1lxz106,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1lxz106/explore_aglucky_z5880_red_countertop_ice_maker_is/,Explore AGLUCKY Z5880 Red Countertop Ice Maker: Is it Worth It?,"Testing out the AGLUCKY Z5880-RED has been a game-changer for someone like me who loves hosting gatherings and keeping the fridge stocked with ice-cold beverages. It’s marketed as a countertop portable ice maker that produces 26 pounds of ice in just 24 hours. Naturally, I had to see if it delivered on its bold promises, especially since my previous ice maker was a bit of a disappointment. I’ve spent a solid few weeks letting it work overtime, and I have plenty of thoughts – both good and bad – about this machine.

**Design and Build Quality**

Right out of the box, the sleek, compact design of the portable ice maker caught my attention. Its bright red finish stands out boldly in the kitchen, adding a modern vibe while taking up minimal counter space. Measuring 12.3 inches deep, 8.7 inches wide, and 12.6 inches tall, it’s surprisingly compact for its capacity. It easily tucks into any corner without obstructing my workflow in the kitchen. The transparent top window is a clever addition; I can check the ice level at a glance without opening the lid. Its lightweight build at approximately 15.82 pounds makes it easy to move around, whether I want it on my counter or at a friend’s backyard BBQ. However, while the exterior feels sturdy, the plastic on the inside feels a little flimsy – something that could be a concern for durability in the long run.

**Performance and Ice Production**

AGLUCKY claims this machine produces 9 bullet-shaped ice cubes in just 6-8 minutes, and honestly, I was pretty skeptical. But after multiple trials, the claims hold—this ice maker is impressively fast. By the time dinner’s ready, I’ve got a fresh batch of ice cubes for everyone’s drinks. What’s even better is that it’s efficient enough to churn out up to 26 pounds of ice daily, perfect for parties or even everyday use in a larger household. The two size options (small and large cubes) are convenient depending on what you’re using the ice for. The smaller size works great for blended drinks, while the larger cubes stay solid longer for drinks like iced coffee.

**Ease of Operation**

Everything about how this machine works is intuitive. I didn’t even need to look up the manual (though there’s one included). The interface is straightforward, with indicators that notify you when the water reservoir is empty or when the ice bucket is full. With these reminders, I never had to second-guess whether everything was running smoothly. And let’s not forget the built-in self-cleaning function—a lifesaver! All you need to do is press a button, and the machine does the dirty work of cleaning its interior. No muss, no fuss.

**Highlights**

- Produces 9 ice cubes in under 10 minutes.  
- Can generate up to 26 pounds of ice per day.  
- Compact and portable for versatile usage.  
- Transparent lid to monitor ice production.  
- Self-cleaning function for added convenience.  

**Areas for Improvement**

While the ice machine has plenty of upsides, a few things stood out as less-than-perfect. The first drawback is the noise; while it’s quieter than many alternatives, you can’t ignore the low hum it produces. Not deafening, but certainly noticeable in a quiet space. Additionally, the plastic ice tray and scoop feel a little cheap, and I found myself wondering if they’d hold up without cracking over time. Lastly, for anyone looking to store ice long-term, this machine lacks a freezer compartment. Ice that’s not used quickly begins to melt and recirculates back for future production.  

- Slightly noisy as it operates.  
- Plastic parts feel fragile compared to the rest of the build.  
- Doesn’t store ice long-term due to the absence of freezing capability.  

**Competing Products**

When measured against competitors, this ice maker fares well for its efficiency and compact nature. For example, models like the GE Profile Opal tend to outperform in long-term ice storage due to their built-in freezer aspects, but they often cost significantly more and are bulkier—making them less portable. On the other hand, some cheaper alternatives might cut corners on features like self-cleaning or customizable ice sizes, so the AGLUCKY Z5880-RED strikes a good balance in terms of portability and functionality.  

**Quality for Price**

Balancing its price point with its capabilities, the AGLUCKY ice maker provides solid value for someone after a quick, easy-to-operate ice machine for personal or frequent party use. Its two ice size options, self-cleaning mode, and compact design make it an excellent option in its category. While it doesn’t have the bells and whistles of premium-tier units, you won’t feel like you’ve overpaid for what it delivers. Essentially, you get what you pay for: a reliable, hardworking machine that can handle your daily ice demands.

1lxz0yd,https://www.reddit.com/r/delhi/comments/1lxz0yd/went_to_a_business_interaction_today/,Went to a 'business interaction' today.,"Before you feel bad for me that I fell for such a well known scam, I must clarify that I had a very good idea of this being a scam. I just went there to have an experience with these scammers, to see how the scam world has evolved and also an excuse for a solo date😂
So starting from the beginning, I know this friend from Reddit itself. He and I both are Bangalis( Bengalis; that's what we like to call ourselves, 'Bangalis') and I enjoyed talking to him. We exchanged contacts as well and everything was well except when in March, all of a sudden he tells me ' I have quit my job to focus on my start up and making huge profits' Okay, great for him I thought. Then he used to call me often, usually when I am busy so didn't get time to contact him. Recently, as I was sharing my CV to a company for an internship, I thought of sharing it with him as well because he had been asking me for my CV for a LOOOOOOOONG time. He contacted me, said my CV is 'impressive' and his senior partners really liked it. He asked me if I am free tomorrow and that he would schedule a meeting with the 'senior business partner' at Starbucks, CP.
Red Flags till now:

🚩 If this were a profitable venture why would he be calling me several times when I don't even know him that well? Why would he chase after people instead of people chasing him, willing to be a part of such a venture?


🚩The 'senior business partner' just happens to be free the next day at 12PM for a meeting at Starbucks with a random college student?


🚩When I asked him what skills can I bring to the team as I am not formally educated in business administration? He's like business needs no education, just like a Chaiwala sells chai and makes profit, you just need to sell your product and make profit. Seriously?🙏😭


🚩After this a team acquistion member called me, trying to be as professional and Bona Fide as she can. ""Bring aadhar card, don't carry huge luggage, be on time, as our senior partner will be there and we value their time a lot"". Okay bro, the same senior partner who will be meeting a teenager with 0 exp for a business interaction?


🚩Why schedule a direct offline meeting with a potential member? Why at a cafe and not a office? Oh, that's because you don't have one and one only needs to work 2-3 hours a day 
I thought to myself, let's go and see what this scam is about (10% of me wanted to trust this guy has he had shared a lot about himself and seemed genuine. Woke up early and all.. this discipline is not wasted at least!)


🚩 My friend's social media was filled with pictures of him in Malaysia. You mean to say you can make enough to fund a trip to malaysia after working for 3 months for 2-3 hours a day??💀


🚩The talent acquisition woman could barely talk to me in English. If only they took the time to learn English themselves or better yet send a formal email written by ChatGPT, they would probably still have a better chance at fooling someone
Went to starbucks 15 minutes before the meeting, ordered an overpriced orange drink which cost me 280 INR, at least got the container in which I can collect coins✨


The 'partner' came 13mins after Noon. I was about to leave at 12:15 and go grab lunch at Sandoz with a very sweet woman I had met at Starbucks itself. He asked me if I want a coffee or sm to which I replied in the negative. He then ordered one coffee for himself and we sat down to talk. He explained to me everything about business, their venture, history of the company, adulated the 'senior business partner' to such an extent I thought she is the CEO of an MNC💀
He shared so much about this personal life, anyone naive enough would fall for this act, espcially if they had money to spare.
Red flags:


🚩 Didn't drink his coffee in the enitre 1 hour we talked and we know how much starbucks coffee cost, I even reminded him that your coffee will be cold he is like no matter. You trying to show me you are so rich that you don't care for a meagre 400 rupees capuccinno? Would have been better if you had it. You think the self-made rich waste food they buy to flex their wealth? 


🚩Dodged my questions of:what skills can I bring to the table, what's the history of the company, how did you come up here etc


🚩Poor communication skills. For someone working with international clinetele, you would expect them to have a strong hold on English and basic communication skills. 


Then the 'Senior partner' came along and oh god she told me everything about her family, marriage, son..how she is paying 54000 for her son's tuition without batting an eyelid when she couldn't afford more then 15k before, that she even purchased a home for her parents in Delhi.
She told me the business is about back end web development and research, for companies like Apple,Kent etc and you have to provide market analysis to them, so that they can start their company websites in new countries. Apparently Post-Covid, the whole business shifted online.
She talked to me like a mother and for a moment I genuinely enjoyed talking to her.
She talked about how this business was started by her sister, how she found her two business partners through similar 'interviews'
Ofcourse, my heart sank when I heard initial investment of '3lakhs'. I knew I was right, even though a tiny bit of myself wanted them to be genuine so that I could at least gain some skills and add them to my CV, money was not a priority
She even gave a very genuine sounding breakdown 'You will have your own website, certificate, licence, etc etc'
I told her that  I don't have access to such funds and she's like 'just discuss with your friend about how to arrange the money etc etc'
You yourself struggled with money and you are asking a college student to shell out 3 lakhs out of nowhere??? Like bro?? At least try to tie up the loose ends when you are making such an effort.
I guess I don't need to point out the red flags here.
Thing is, money doesn't come this easily. People work for years after years to be successful and a business is built on ethics. If I was expanding my small, tight-knit business, why would I ask a member to pay money to join when I already have profits? I would rather bear their starting costs and then take a share of their profits.
I am not exposing their names as they will be burnt out soon anyway. If they had just worked hard with the presentation skills they had, I am sure they would have gone a long way and have a strong, ethically grounded career. 
Sadly, these scams are very common as people might see them as a way of easy money, similar to black money, maybe?
My friend and the junior partner who met me first even have genuine, well connected LinkedIn profiles. Baffles me how far these scams have come.
My friend seemed genuine,but then again only had known him for a year and that through via reddit. I had hoped for a good future for him and his family. Alas. Maybe got scammed himself and is now looking to scam others. Don't know how he got to Malaysia though, maybe other people had fell for it and given him this 'start up money' or he invested in a trip to Malaysia to make this business seem 'genuine'

🚩She didn't even offer me to buy an expensive Starbucks coffee to flex her wealth. Though I don't drink coffee but would have been fun to exploit this scammer who thought she had me in the palm of her hand.

🚩 My friend didn't even come to the meeting,he had an 'urgent meeting'. The senior partner was late too. They think this creates an image of busy bodies making them seem credible. Ofc the usual  'you are lucky she is in Delhi today to meet you'. They think being late will impress me. I thank the Universe for giving me enough sense to smell this and other Bullshit logic.

Will report their profiles on LinkedIn and block my friend after calling him out.


Also, it seemed like 80% of Starbucks was filled with these 'business interactions'💀💀💀 Do they all decide on the time and venue or what?
TLDR; MLM scams are very prevalent these days. Easy money is a sham. Stay safe and work hard to live a good life. Stay away from these schemes.

Alcee woke with a start and clutched her chest as the loud bang of furniture being knocked over forced her to an upright position.



Hollering in the adjoining room was coupled with the sound of fists flying and she scrambled from the bed. Digging around for the clothing and trench coat she’d worn to this hotel room, she considered her clothes were returning to her body with far more alacrity than her paramour from the night before removed them.



The sound of a man begging another to not kill him raised her hackles. Looking around frantically she knew there was only one door from the bedroom to the main hotel door but as she looked at the sliding balcony door, she deliberated whether the balcony met with the other room she’d crossed through the night before.



Grabbing her phone, purse, and shoes in her hands she quietly tiptoed to the balcony, flinching when the unmistakable sound of a silenced gun went off. She knew the pop sound as sure as her last name was Mariani.



“Fuck, fuck, fuck, Alcee you idiot!” she whimpered to herself as she stepped onto the patio. The sun was barely breaking the horizon, and the view would have been breathtaking had she not quite possibly just heard someone being murdered in the adjoining suite. “Please don’t let them be Dad’s men.”



Desperately she leaned over the balcony and noted the height of the room she was in and mentally berated herself for falling asleep. Turning to slide along the cool concrete of the balcony, she peered through the crack of the curtains into the room and saw the man she’d spent the night with unscrewing the silencer off the pistol in his hand and glaring down at the body on the floor.



She didn’t recognize him at all and as she looked around the room, she admitted even the three other men in the room who were on their knees in front of her lover and two other men towering over them, were also unknown to her. It wasn’t like she knew all of her father’s men but if someone was coming to drag her sorry ass back, he’d send someone she knew.



Which meant, she was in a hotel room with a man who in the last several minutes committed murder, and she was a witness and if her father found out, he’d order a clean up of the entire group. Not that she’d live to see it if he found out what she’d done before she made her escape. Or worse, if the man in the next room opted to simply get rid of the witness he’d fucked the night before.



She looked around again and grimaced as she looked upward. They were in a penthouse suite. The man who’d purchased her virginity for a cool million the night before was living large. She dropped her trench coat, figuring if she was going to have to shimmy onto the roof of the balcony and try to get to the roof of the hotel, she wasn’t going to be able to do it wearing a long coat. Then her eyes caught the drop again and she knew there was no way she was going to be able to get off the balcony.



She needed to find another way. She was a nerd not an athlete and scaling a building to a rooftop was going to lead to her death and she hadn’t just boldly defied her father and grandfather by giving up her virginity to a stranger instead of the man they’d betrothed her to since she was a teenager to die falling off a building.



“Good going Alcee,” she muttered under her breath, “you managed to find your escape from the Mariani family only to stupidly fall into bed with a murderer. Fuck.” She kicked a chair and then cringed as the metal scraped along the concrete floor of the patio then clattered against the glass door.



When the patio door slid open and her lover from the night before stuck his head out, she immediately cowered in the other chair. Bruno was drop dead gorgeous and incredibly massive. Easily six foot six with shoulders as wide as a linebacker’s and his feet were twice the length of hers. Her body clenched with the memory of what else was humungous on him and she shivered. If she hadn’t been so terrified in this moment, she’d be parting her legs like Moses did the sea.



“What are you doing out here?”



“Watching the sunrise,” she met his gaze fearfully, swallowing her terror where it boiled like a festering sourdough-starter in her gut. “I was going to leave but you seemingly have company.” Her hands were visibly shaking.



“Aya,” he spoke her fake name gently, moving to kneel in front of her, his hand brushing a dark curl off her forehead before gripping her fingers. “You should still be sleeping. Did I not wear you out enough?”



She shook her head unable to meet his gaze, “you, um, there was yelling, and I don’t like confrontation, so I came out here until the yelling stopped.”



“Did you look in the window?” He motioned from where he just emerged.



“No. I came out here as soon as the yelling got really loud, and I simply sat here.” She rested her chin on her knees and prayed he bought her story.



“Good girl,” he leaned forward and kissed her forehead. “I would very much like for us to see each other again but I can’t do so if you’re poking your nose where it doesn’t belong.”



“I understand, Bruno,” she whispered twisting her lips.



“You are so fucking beautiful,” he whispered as he leaned closer stroking her cheek. His eyes were a warm honeyed brown with flecks of gold, and they stared into hers like he was staring into her soul.



The scent of gunpowder was on his fingers, and it made her heart pound with fear, but she feigned ignorance as she closed her eyes when his lips connected with hers.



**Chapter 2**



When he broke the kiss she was almost distracted from the goings-on in the adjoining room.



“I told you before, I am a very wealthy man. Do you know why I bought you last night, darling?”



She shook her head, “rich men do crazy things all the time.”



“My last lover gave me an STD.” her eyes flicked to his in horror and he held up his hand, “I am clean now, as attested to by the medical report you insisted, I provide ahead of our meeting, but getting chlamydia a year ago made me want to try something completely different. A virgin was going to ensure I was safe from the machinations of a twisted, cheating, lover’s mind. I wasn’t expecting you to be as,” he paused, the back of his knuckles dragging over her bottom lip, “responsive and excitable as you turned out to be. I want you to stay. If you can be a good girl and sit here and wait until my men finish their discussion,” he drawled the word out, “then we can pick up where we left off. Since I’m your first I was hoping we can continue to see each other.”



She finally met his gaze, “you paid me a million dollars for one night, Bruno. I didn’t think it would lead to more than the one night. I have college classes, and my family is likely waiting for me.” She looked at his watch, “my family always does brunch on Sundays. I can’t miss it.”



“I would like to meet your family. I’m not letting you go, darling girl. Last night was bar none, the most exquisite night of my life and knowing you are untouched by any other man is bringing out the most primal part of me to keep you as mine and mine alone.”



She was truly terrified now, “I don’t understand.”



“I want you to be my mistress. Long term. We will fuck every night and likely every morning too,” his dark eyes were heated as they looked her over, “and in return, I will take care of your every need. There is nothing you or your family should want for. If you wish to continue your education, I have no issue with this. Where do you go to school?”



“NYU.”



“What are you taking?”



“Graphic design.” All the back story she’d concocted when she’d started this game came to her easily. She’d practiced it enough.



“Then you will continue. I’ll have your courses paid for. It won’t cost your family anything.” He frowned, “why did you sell your virginity online? What prompted you to do so?”



Alcee found herself wondering how he could hold a conversation as he was while there was a dead man in the next room but then it dawned on her, he was distracting her while the men cleaned up the situation.



“I needed the money.”



“For?”



Twisting her fingers nervously she shrugged, “school is expensive, and my parents have three kids including me. My program is sixty thousand dollars over four years. I have student loan debt and then when I graduate, I want to start my own business, and the start-up is expensive. One of my girlfriends suggested doing this black-market thing as an auction. One of her cousins did it to pay off her student loans instead of stripping. I was only looking for the sixty thousand for my program, but you bid a million and here we are.”



“You come from a large family.”



“Yes.”



Her family consisted of five children, with four older brothers, another lie told. All four of them were in arranged engagements and marriages. Her eldest brother Mercurio was married seven years ago when he was twenty-five to the daughter of his father’s Consigliere Panfilo. Panfilo was her father’s second cousin which meant her brother married within the family. She herself couldn’t fathom having sex with someone they shared DNA history with but to keep it in the family, her brother toed the line. If he wanted to be Don someday, he did what was demanded of him by their father.



“I will provide for your family.” He said as he rose to stand in front of her, extending his hand out.



A man stuck his head out the door, “Bruno, sir, we have relocated our guests, if you and your companion would like to head to the other suite across the hall for breakfast.”



“Thank you,” he nodded to the man. “Come. We will have breakfast together and discuss our future.” He lifted up her trench coat off the patio table and wrapped it over her shoulders.



Draping his arm around her he edged her through the room where the body had been, and she made certain to keep her eyes averted. Twenty-one years of living as the princess to the Mariani family, she knew when she was supposed to keep her eyes and mouth shut.



Just as he escorted her into a room across the hall, another man wearing an obvious holster came into the hall and she flinched.



“He is my head of security. As I said, I am quite wealthy and have many enemies.”



“Sir, a word?” the man motioned for Bruno to return to the suite they’d just vacated.



She didn’t waste any time. The moment the two men disappeared into the room and closed the door; she was pulling the door to the suite she was in open and racing to the far end of the hall through the emergency stairwell.



After racing down multiple flights of stairs she stopped to take a breath, wheezing like an asthmatic missing their inhaler. “Holy shit, Alcee, you need to exercise more,” she hissed at herself.



Eventually she reached the bottom floor and then made her way to the parking garage. It didn’t take long to find her way into the early morning traffic and to flag down a yellow taxi.



Giving directions to her parent’s estate, she was dropped off outside the gates and made the slow walk up the driveway.



Her mother was right behind the butler who opened the front door, her hand going to her mouth in horror, as she took in her daughter’s walk of shame, “Alcee, what have you done?”



Taking a deep breath, she met her mother’s gaze directly, “if anyone was going to sell off my virginity it was going to be me. You can tell Papa unless Don Lozano is interested in a bride who is no longer pure, I’m of no use to either family.”



A fleeting thought of the passion of the night before taunted her as she considered perhaps, she should have stayed with the murdering rich man named Bruno as all hell broke loose.



**Chapter 3**



“Susana,” Alcee groaned into her cell phone as she knelt under the desk of one of the administrators from the upper management floor, “I don’t have time for this.”



“Make time.”



The constant demands of her friends on her time was something they fought about constantly. While they were under the protection of their family, she was without and they seemed to always forget she was putting her life at risk each time she stepped outside her front door. Life wasn’t so easy when you were an ex-principessa and the streets knew the Mariani Don didn’t care if you lived or died.



“Can’t. I’m working overtime tonight.”



“Ditch it.”



“Unlike you who still has her trust fund,” she grunted as she adjusted an HDMI cable and sighed, “I need to work.” There was always a terrible fear her money would run out and she’d be struggling to provide for Antero.



“You have money in the bank!”



“There are savings in the event something happens, and I lose my job or get sick or suffer an accident or all of the above. My nest egg protects me and my family. My job keeps us fed and housed.” She backed out from under the desk and shoved back up her glasses which slipped down her nose. She plunked herself down in the chair and booted up the computer on the desk and waited for it to come back on.



“Alcee, you need to live a little.”



“Look, I’m working right now. There are six more computers I need to get set up before I can go home at the end of the day. I would very much like to focus on my task.”



“You work too hard. This isn’t good for you.”



“I work exactly hard enough to keep me alive and out of my father’s crosshairs, Susana.”



“You owe me.”



“How? On what planet does me declining a dinner invite which is a double date, a blind date for me, turn into me owing you one? This isn’t adding up.”



“I don’t know how, but you owe me. We are going do to do this double date at some point so stop putting it off.”



“Whatever,” she hung up the phone and then typed on the keyboard and watched with pleasure as the system came up and running. One down. Six more to go.



When she left her parent’s home six years ago, or more accurately when her father threw her out with nothing but the clothes on her back for being a disgrace, she’d managed to find her footing relatively quickly.



Getting hired on as an IT general specialist straight out of college at a large security firm in Manhattan, she’d been able to make a career for herself. The only hiccup was when three years ago, the company switched hands, and the Lozano family purchased the company lock stock and barrel. She’d been terrified for months they would note her last name on the employee list and fire her, or worse, kill her.



Instead, despite the sale, the new owners of the company hadn’t set foot in the building in the three years they’d owned it. The rumor mill said they were quite happy with the way the current president of the company was running things.



The current president of the company, Kylen, was hired by the previous CEO. Kylen was an ex-Navy seal who hired mostly the men and women he’d worked with in the forces or were referred to him. Alcee who was hired by the previous CEO remained one of the few outliers taken on with the recommendations of one of her college professors. She’d passed the vetting process, all the background checks and even her last name hadn’t been able to stop them from hiring her and the prior CEO took her under her wing and made her his honorary granddaughter. When he’d retired and sold the company, she knew he’d insisted to Kylen to keep her on.



It seemed the new owners presumed the current company president kept staff in place he trusted and as such nobody even breathed her name the wrong way during the transition of the company following the sale to the Lozano family. Mr. Kylen Burgess stayed on as the president and the Lozano family never bothered too much.



She knew they came to attend board meetings and the like, but she was what the upper management group called a troll. She and the other six IT generalists lived in the lower levels of the company, often referred to as the bowels of hell, by the rest of the employees. She personally found the moniker funny because in her Italian Catholic upbringing, hell was supposed to be hot, and the computer lab floor was colder than the rest of the building.



She was smirking to herself at the thought when one of her counterparts came grumbling in her direction. “What’s up, Tank?”



Tank was one of the military-trained IT guys and in command of their department. He reported directly to Kylen. He also lived up to his name in terms of size but he was usually a gentle soul, happy to sit behind his desk and plug along on a keyboard.



“All the fucking bigwigs are upstairs. Kylen let me know the CEO is moving from his office in Europe to New York. He let me know now, as in right this minute instead of, you know, giving me a heads up so I could prepare for this shit.”



She felt her stomach drop to her feet. She’d jinxed herself by even thinking of the Lozano family.



“The CEO?”



“Torquato Lozano.”



Fuck. She was going to puke. She was going to projectile vomit all over the desktop she’d put together.



**Chapter 4**



Torquato Lozano. To the business world he was a hard-nosed businessman but to those who knew what la famiglia meant, he was the Don of the Lozano family. He’d boldly and brutally overthrown his own father for the title when his grandfather stepped down. He’d been thirty-two when he took control of his family. He’d done so only one year after his family rescinded the marriage agreement once they found out she wasn’t a virgin any longer.



Now he’d be roughly thirty-seven years old, a Don for five years now and he’d made a hell of a name for himself. Her brother and he were the same age and while her brothers still talked to her and kept her in the loop about things which she needed to be aware of for her protection, the one thing her eldest brother always said was Don Lozano scared the fuck out of him, and they’d grown up with Edgardo Mariani for a father.



To this day, there wasn’t a single direct photograph of the Don of the Lozano family. Unlike his father who frequently postured and grandstanded for the notoriety of it all, Torquato operated in the shadows. Rumors swirled that he was ugly with scars running over his face and a temper to match.



It was why, of course, she’d gone through the lengths she’d gone to avoid marrying him. The last thing she wanted was to be the unwilling bride to a sadist who was ten years older than her and wanted a wife who was nothing more than a brood mare to be raped and bred day in and out until she popped out the heir to his throne.



She’d taken a big risk doing what she’d done but it paid off. Auctioning off her virginity on the dark web had been a burst of insanity. Nobody could trace who she was because she was a damn good hacker so Bruno would never be able to find out anything more than the backstory, she meticulously created and left breadcrumbs about. Her family would never figure out who to whom she’d sold herself because all traces of the experience were wiped clean, by her own hand. Once her mother threw her into her room to await her father’s arrival, she’d been on her computer in seconds, eradicating all the images of her from the hotel surveillance and nearby traffic lights, she’d transferred the money she’d received to an offshore account and erased every digital print of the night as if it never happened.



She knew she’d also done Bruno a solid because in removing every trace of herself from the computer system, she also got rid of all the evidence of his men disposing of the three bodies.



Emerging from her memory she crinkled her nose at Tank, “I’m sorry, what did you say?”



“I need you upstairs with me to help me set up the two offices. I can do the programming for the security systems we need to run but I need a second set of hands to get this done.”



“Tank, I must get the other desks set up. I’m already working overtime.”



“Not my problem. You’ll stay later.”



“Are you going to arrange the babysitter?” she shot back at him angrily, shoving her glasses back up her nose. “In case you forgot I have a kid at home who I’d like to at least see for a few minutes before he goes to bed.”



Tank sighed, “look, let’s set the offices up upstairs and then you and I will come down here and get this done.”



“Which part do you not get? My sitter is only there for two more hours. Not a minute more. If I lose my sitter, I will quit my job and then you lose one of our IT team.”



“Fine. You can come in early tomorrow.”



“Do they call you Tank because you run roughshod all over people like a tank?” It was a comment she’d made multiple times over the years.



He chuckled. “I’ll call one of the other guys to come in early. Deal?”



“Deal.” She dropped what she was doing and followed him down the hall towards the elevator. Her stomach was still churning. “When you said they were upstairs, they’re not in the offices, are they? I mean there is nothing set up yet.”



“They’re working out of the boardroom for now. They showed up unannounced or, according to Kylen with one hour’s notice. Also, the secretary or admin assistant or whatever the socially appropriate name is now for the woman who gets his coffee and dry cleaning, is a piece of work. She’s wearing six-inch heels, more lipstick than a Vogue cover girl and makes me feel every bit as insecure as I did when I got picked on by the cheer captain in middle school. I swear she’s every nerd’s worst nightmare.”



“You were a nerd, Tank?”



“I got big in the army, Alcee and switched my coke-bottle glasses for contacts but in here,” he tapped his chest, “fifteen-year-old skinny Ezekiel who preferred playing chess against the computer than talking to people still doesn’t like bitchy women who chew little boys like me up.”



She chuckled, “she can’t be so bad.”



“She took one look at Kylen, and he made sure to put the entire length of the board room table between them. I’ve known him a long time and let me tell you, even he is steering clear of her. Her name is Genevra and she’s the reason the term mean girls was coined.” He pushed the button to the top floor and jammed his fists into his pockets. “These are the days I miss mine-clearing operations.”



As the doors opened to the top floor, she found herself heartily agreeing with him. A sinking feeling the risk of her being on this floor or doing the task he’d now mentioned were equally devastating if the Lozano family found issue with her working in their building.



**Chapter 5**



She was quickly trying to get the desk set up with dual monitors, ergonomic keyboards, state of the art laptop with all the bells and whistles as far as printers and speakers and all the other accoutrements went.



The longer she worked, the more she realized she needed to resign. She’d worked for three years too long here. The minute the company shifted hands, despite the fact the CEO was rumored to be in Italy and intended to keep his base there, she should have sought employment elsewhere. She’d taken false safety in hiding right under the enemy’s nose.



The clicking of heels on the tiled floor coming in her direction made her cringe as she heard Tank utter a muffled “fuck me”. She looked into the open doorway of the CEO’s office where the giant of a man was working and saw the shudder go through him as he heard the woman approaching before, he saw her.



The woman’s muttering in Italian, a series of curses about how slow the staff was and how uncultured New Yorkers were made Alcee’s head throb and suddenly Alcee forcing herself not to divulge she could speak the language. Instead, she kept her head bent and unravelled a long cord. If she didn’t engage the woman perhaps, she’d be left alone. Her thought was incredibly short lived.



“Make sure those cords are not anywhere I am going to trip on them.” The woman’s voice shrilly skittered along Alcee’s spine.



“Yes ma’am,” she nodded, not looking up to make eye contact. She held up a clip which would conceal and pin the cords to the underside of the desk. “This will keep them off your feet.”



“Ugh, how much longer will you be?”



“Another thirty minutes, forty max.”



“Not acceptable. I want it done in fifteen minutes.”



Alcee shot a glance at Tank at the other desk, and he pressed his lips together in frustration. She felt the same sense of foreboding at the woman’s tone and knew she would not like the answer. “I’m afraid it’s impossible.”



“Make it possible.”



“And if I can’t?”



“Then you’re fired.”



This time the look she shot to Tank had him sitting up and getting ready to rush towards her. She knew the glint in her eye was not anything he could miss. This woman gave her a get out of jail free card and she’d never lost a game of Monopoly in her life. She was taking this little card and running with it.



“No, no, no, Cee, let me help.” Tank moved far faster than a man his size should as he vacated the desk he was working to prepare to come assist her.



“You cannot help her. You need to finish Mr. Lozano’s set up. He needed in his office hours ago. Instead, he is working at an uncomfortable table.”



Her accent was thick, and Alcee was convinced she was exaggerating it because she knew she could do the exact same thing if she wanted. Despite sounding as American as apple pie most of the time, if Alcee were in Italy right now, she’d blend in with her family as if she’d never left the country. The woman was trying to act as if she were better than them because of her Italian background. It made Alcee want to leave all the more. Phony bitch.



“You are given fifteen minutes, or you’re done.” The woman glared at her.



Alcee stood up from the desk, ignoring Tank’s groan and dropped the cords. “You don’t need to fire me. I quit. Ciao stronza,” she bowed deeply at the waist and turned to look at Tank with a smug grin. “Call security to meet me at my locker since it’s protocol to escort all employees who are fired or resigned from the premises.” She considered skipping to her locker.



“No, Alcee, you can’t quit,” he chased after her.



The other woman was blinking incredulously as if she’d expected Alcee to argue and try to keep her job. Did the woman actually believe she’d beg? As if. She was a Mariani. Mariani don’t beg. She might not be her father’s principessa but the name on her birth certificate was deep in her DNA. Her pride ran in her blood thicker than any other of her traits.



Kylen happened to be coming out of the board room as she hit the button for the elevator. “Tank, where are you two going? The set up can’t be done yet.”



“The ice princess over there, fired Alcee because Alcee said it would take thirty-to-forty minutes to finish the desk set up. I’m trying to beg her not to leave. Genevra wanted it done in fifteen minutes and it’s impossible. Not only that but the physical set up can be done in thirty or forty minutes but then I need to get into the computer and get it up to the standard of the company. If their laptops hadn’t gotten destroyed, then we wouldn’t be in this situation, but Mr. Lozano made it clear his personal computer is not to be associated with the business and the one he brought from Italy was destroyed in the car accident this afternoon.” He mumbled under his breath about bullets in a laptop making Alcee’s spine straighten. “We’re setting up a brand-new system for the pair of them and she’s making impossible demands. We were rushing as best we could. As it was, Alcee was supposed to be setting up the new marketing department upgrades this evening, and we let it go until tomorrow. I arranged for a crew to come in at six tomorrow to do what Alcee was taken away from completing downstairs.”



**Chapter 6**



“Alcee,” Kylen reached out to stop her from entering the elevator. He put a hand on her shoulder to keep her still. “We can clear up this misunderstanding.”



“It’s not a misunderstanding, Mr. Burgess. She told me to get it done in a fraction of the available time or I’m fired. I harbor no illusions about my abilities to perform magic and as a result, I’ve accepted my termination. I’ve asked Tank to request security walk me out.”



“While Ms. Verrilli is indeed the assistant to the CEO, she is not HR, and she can’t hire or fire.”



“The hell I can’t,” the woman approached, her heels smacking the floor. It made Alcee think of her mother who often wore the same type of shoes, but you’d never hear her coming. One was graceful, the other was not. The woman’s annoying voice was more evidence she was playing dress-up, trying to be more than she was because elegance and decorum were not anything she possessed. “She is done here. She was talking back to her superiors, and she cursed at me.”



“You heard her.” Alcee flapped her hand as the bitchy woman stomped her heel with enough force, Alcee was surprised the spike didn’t snap off. “She’s my superior and I denied her request to finish in fifteen minutes. I’m done here.”



Kylen grabbed the other woman by the arm and began dragging her away, looking over his shoulder at Alcee. “Alcee, please finish the desk setup. If you still want to quit when you’re done putting it together, then I’ll write you a glowing letter of recommendation. In the meantime, I’m going to beg Mr. Lozano remind Ms. Verrilli of her job demands and expectations.”



“Unhand me you American barbarian.” The woman was yanking on her arm as she was dragged unceremoniously down the hall.



“I’d really rather quit than deal with her,” Alcee met Tank’s eyes and knew the truth was blaring right at him in the soft brown of her irises.



“If you walk out with the job undone, he’ll make sure you can’t get hired anywhere else.” Tank threatened her. “Do you want a letter of recommendation, or do you want to be unemployed forever?”



“Ugh,” she threw her hands up in the air and marched back to the desk. “When I was in high school, I once hacked into the school system and fucked with the SAT results of my bully and made sure she didn’t get into any college and when she retook them, I did it again. I miss how easy those days were compared to this shit,” she found herself back on her knees under the desk setting up the wires she was working on earlier.



The sound of yelling down the hall, coming from the lone female voice at the end, made them both perk up and then not ten minutes after Kylen dragged her away, the woman was back in front of Alcee muttering a not-very-heartfelt apology.



“Take your time and make sure it’s done right.” The woman finished her monologue.



“Yup.” Alcee didn’t even look at the woman as she continued working.



“You are a rude American.”



She heard a man clearing his throat and a rapid exchange of Italian again and the woman stormed off furiously.



“I am sorry for my sister’s behavior.”



“Your sister?” Alcee looked up to meet the eyes of the man now standing opposite the desk she was putting together.



He extended his hand, “Bastiano Verrilli. I am the head of corporate security for Mr. Lozano. It’s nice to meet you Ms. Mariani.”



The way he said her last name sent a shiver of fear down her spine. His eyes were dark and searching and she knew without a shadow of a doubt the man knew who she was. He wasn’t the head of security for Torquato Lozano without knowing who was here on his floor.



“I’m sure the pleasure is all mine,” she whispered back without reaching to shake his proffered hand, instead ducking back under the desk to hook up the cable in her hand. The telltale sound of the printer starting up made her smile with relief. One more thing done.



“When you are done here, you are to come to the board room to see Mr. Lozano.”



She poked her head back out, smacking the top of her skull against the hard wood, “is it an order from the CEO?” The other half of her question, “or the Don,” was left unspoken but the way the man in front of her quirked an eyebrow told her the answer.



He leaned over the desk, his huge meaty hands gripping the top of it to stare straight at her, “does your father know you work for the Lozano family?”



“My father,” she grunted as she yanked on an extension cord from under the desk, “doesn’t miss a trick, Mr. Verrilli, but if you’re asking if I’ve personally been in contact with him to let him know of my day-to-day activities, I have not been permitted to speak to anyone in the Mariani family since he threw me out of their home six years ago. Aside from the occasional call from my brothers who defy his orders to check on my wellbeing, I haven’t spoken with anyone else in the family. If my father knows what I do, it is because he has looked into it, not because I volunteered information.”



The man seemed surprised, “he threw you out?”



“The minute my father found out the one thing he was using to bargain me off to Mr. Lozano was no longer intact, he tossed me on my ass. I cost him a lot of money and his face.”



“Mr. Lozano cancelled the contract.”



“Yes, because my hymen was no longer intact. I was no longer of value to the family without my virginity, so I got thrown out. It was better than the bullet he threatened me with, I suppose.”



“Wait, wait,” Mr. Verrilli seemed completely perplexed, “are you telling me your father threw you out because you weren’t a virgin?”



“Yes. He’d promised my virginity to Mr. Lozano, and I broke the covenant.”



“Mr. Lozano broke the agreement but not because –” he stopped speaking as if he was aware he was talking out of turn. “Excuse me.”



She grimaced as he almost ran to the boardroom at the end of the hall.



Mafia men were strange.

1lxyzn9,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lxyzn9/fallen_crest_public_by_tijan/,Fallen Crest Public by Tijan,"Mason and Logan Kade are two brothers who did their own thing. They were rich and expected to attend her school, Fallen Crest Academy. They chose public school and now Samantha has to live with them. The problem is that she doesn’t care at all: about them, about her friends, about her cheating boyfriend, or even about her parent’s divorce. But maybe that’s a good thing. Maybe change is a good thing.  
  
  Samantha and Mason are together. Everyone knows it. Not everyone is dealing with it. While Mason’s ready to give them the middle finger, there’s one not going away. Her mother. Threats are issued. Ultimatums are given. Even blackmail is used, but only Samantha can put a stop to Analise. However, when a trauma from her past is triggered, she may not have the courage or strength to do what’s needed. If she doesn’t, Mason’s future could be destroyed.  
  
  I woke to a hand sliding under my top and cupping my breast.  
  
  Mason!  
  
  Then I became aware of a very masculine and muscled thigh sliding between my legs and rolling me to my stomach. As he slid my tank’s strap down, his lips went to my naked shoulder and nibbled on the back of my neck. Goosebumps broke out as I sucked in a breath. My legs pressed together, and a deep, strong throbbing started. It was pounding in a steady beat. As his lips moved down my spine, I gasped out loud. Arching my back for him, I was pressed against him. He was hard, but Mason didn’t grunt, he didn’t make a sound. Instead, his hand fell to my hip, and he pulled me even further into him. His hand caressed down my back and my tank top was bunched together into one tiny scrap of fabric. Slowly, so goddamn slowly, he pressed his chest to my back, but he was holding me up now.  
  
  I needed him now.  
  
  He slid my top up my back, trailing kisses on my spine as he did. When it was lifted over my head, I pushed up from the bed, pushing him upright with me at the same time. Enough. I couldn’t handle it anymore. I needed more of him. We were now kneeling together. As the top fell to the floor, I reached behind me for him. I needed to taste him.  
  
  My hand slid around his neck to his hair, and I grabbed a fistful of it, taking a firm hold and anchoring him to me. He grunted now, grinding into me as his lips went to my ear. I could feel him smiling as his teeth took hold of it, sucking on it. Still holding me to him, one hand cupped my breast firmly while his other hand went to my underwear. They were pushed out of the way as he slid a finger inside me. Then a second.  
  
  “Mason,” I wrenched out, turning my head for his lips.  
  
  A deep chuckle came from him as he nuzzled along my jawline, so achingly close to where I wanted him. I needed him inside of me. Now.  
  
  A shudder went through me.  
  
  God. I was already wet. The throbbing was pounding through me. To wake up like this, feeling him slowly rocking against me, I was almost panting.  
  
  His fingers pushed further inside of me, building a tempo, going slow. Leaning back into him, my hand fell to his and I urged him to go faster. It was building, but I needed it harder. Faster. His lips curved up as he nuzzled along my cheek. His other hand was rubbing over my breast, teasing me, and I fell against him. He was holding all of me up. I could barely kneel anymore, but I moved my head, searching for his lips. The desire was so blinding, but he wouldn’t kiss me, and I growled in frustration. He chuckled as his lips nipped at the corner of my lips.  
  
  “More,” I rasped out. “Now.”  
  
  “More?”  
  
  A thrill went through me when I heard the thick lust in his voice. I wasn’t the only one nearing combustion. He was barely holding back—I could tell—his hips were moving against me harder, faster. Then he started to bend me over. His hand left my breast and it cupped the side of my hip. He whispered against the back of my neck, “Hold onto the headboard.”  
  
  Shit.  
  
  “Mason,” I whimpered again. It was too much, but my hands grasped onto the headboard. My fingers curled around it, and I held on. I had no idea how. I was so focused on him, at how he was almost in me now. I could feel him through his boxers. His hand was still between my legs, but he pulled out. Instantly, I ached for him. I was too empty. I groaned in protest. “No …”  
  
  Then he was back. He had switched his angle now; he was firmly behind me. Urging my legs further apart, his fingers began pistoning in and out of me faster than before.  
  
  I was going crazy.  
  
  I needed him, all of him, and I began moving faster, riding his hand at the same time.  
  
  “Jeezus,” he grunted over me, his mouth next to my ear.  
  
  A delicious shiver rushed through me as his breath caressed my skin.  
  
  “Now,” I cried out, gritting my teeth.  
  
  His fingers kept ramming into me, sliding back and forth, going deeper until I wasn’t sure they could go any deeper.  
  
  “Mason.” I was panting now. Goddamn. “Please.”  
  
  A deep guttural groan was my answer and his hand left me. His boxers were shoved down and in one smooth movement, he thrust deep inside of me.  
  
  Finally.  
  
  I closed my eyes and welcomed the heat. He was home now. We moved together, knowing each other’s bodies so well. Turning my head to the side, his lips were there and they opened for me. I needed him. Sweeping my tongue against his lips, I tasted what was mine. He was mine. All of him was mine.  
  
  Bent over me, he held me anchored in place with a hand gripping my hip, but his other reached under me and took a firm hold of my breast. His thumb rubbed against my nipple. Shit. I gasped, pushing back into him so he’d go harder.  
  
  “Sam,” he whispered against my lips.  
  
  I needed him to go faster. I couldn’t handle it anymore and began to rock against him faster and faster.  
  
  “Shit,” he gasped now, but he straightened. Both of his hands held onto my hips and he slammed into me, pushing me into the headboard now. I didn’t care. My face was to the side now and I was gasping for breath. Some of my hair had fallen into my face so I couldn’t see. The strands dipped into my mouth, but Mason moved them. They were tucked behind my ear and I was gasping for breath. He kept thrusting into me.  
  
  I was nearing.  
  
  I could feel it.  
  
  “Mason.” A low groan came from the bottom of my throat.  
  
  I was right there.  
  
  Then, as his hands dug into my hips one last time, he emptied into me. I was right with him. My body shot over the edge and trembled as the waves rocked over me. He collapsed on my back and chuckled. His hand skimmed past my hip and he pushed off from the headboard. As our skin separated, he grunted.  
  
  I couldn’t move. I hung onto the headboard, panting for breath. My body was still trembling as the waves kept coming.  
  
  “You okay?”  
  
  I shook my head. I couldn’t even attempt to speak. I’d been weakened by that climax, but then he slid a hand in front of me and I was lifted into the air. Curling into him, my arms wound around his neck and my legs wrapped around his waist. His hands gripped my ass now as he moved from the bed. Mason carried me to the bathroom and tested the water before he stepped underneath. I hung onto him, clinging like a monkey as he washed his hair and then mine. When his fingers started to massage my scalp and he rinsed the shampoo from my hair, I closed my eyes. I enjoyed every last minute of his attention.  
  
  I loved him.  
  
  A feeling of contentment swept over me, and I could’ve hung onto him until next week. However, after washing both of us, he moved me back to the counter and I unhooked myself, giving him a rueful grin as he tossed me a towel. When he started to dry himself off, I didn’t do a thing. I just watched. My eyes drank in the sight of him.  
  
  Broad shoulders. Every muscle defined, all the way down to his abdominals and obliques. Even the muscles in his legs bulged and shifted as he bent low to dry the rest of him. A trim waist. Angular cheekbones. Luscious eyelashes that covered his emerald eyes and lips th  
at a girl would die for. Not me. I just died to touch them and feel them against mine.  
  
  I let out a deep breath. I was addicted to him.  
  
  He grinned as his eyes darkened. He knew exactly what I was thinking or feeling. He asked, “Are you going to get ready?”  
  
  “Sure. When my legs can work again. What was that?”  
  
  “That,” he moved closer, pulling the towel from me, “was the best way to start my last semester.”  
  
  I flinched as if a cold bucket of water was dumped on me. Those words left me cold. Plucking the towel from him, I hopped off the counter and shoved past him to the bedroom.  
  
  “What’s wrong?” He followed me.  
  
  “That was the best way to start your last semester?” I dried myself off and stopped to glare at him. Seriously? He was an idiot. “Screw you.”  
  
  The corner of his mouth curved up. “You just did.”  
  
  “Not funny, Mason.”  
  
  He frowned and narrowed his eyes at me. “What’s wrong?”  
  
  “You’re leaving.”  
  
  “Just to college. I’m not going forever.”  
  
  I rolled my eyes and turned my back. Says you, you big ass. Just to college. It’s not that simple.  
  
  “Wait, are you really mad at me?”  
  
  Ignoring him, I grabbed some underwear, jeans, a bra and a shirt. Stopping once, I glanced in the mirror to make sure I looked presentable—I’d do. My dark hair hadn’t been cut so it fell below my shoulders. I’d twist it up in a braid later, but the jeans and shirt were snug. Good. I didn’t care if every inch of me was on display. The jeans were washed out, but clung to me and my shirt was a simple long-sleeve white shirt. The front dipped low, giving a good view of my cleavage, and my black lace bra showed through the thin material, but I didn’t care. Mason was just going to college, my ass. Still ignoring him, I grabbed my backpack and purse. Stuffing the purse inside of the bag, I brushed past him and headed downstairs. As I got into the kitchen, Logan was just putting the coffee pot back on the burner. He turned and stopped. Seeing me when I entered, his eyes went wide and a low wolf whistle came next.  
  
  “You’re smoking, Sam.” He gave me a wicked grin. “Mason must’ve pissed you off, huh?”  
  
  “I know I look pissed.”  
  
  “Nah.” He shook his head, his brown locks had been gelled to perfection. “You’re smoking hot. I know you’re mad because you got that cold as ice look in your eye you always get when you are, but that’s not what I meant. You only come out looking hot as hell when my big bro’s pissed you off.” Checking his watch, he whistled again. “That was fast because I just heard you two going at it like wild animals.”  
  
  Oh. Jeezus. Flushing, I ignored his comments and gestured to the coffee pot. “Are you going to start that?”  
  
  “Nope. It doesn’t work.”  
  
  This morning went from great to crap. “Oh.”  
  
  Grabbing his keys, Logan dangled them at me. “But if we leave now, we can stop at The Quickie. I need to get gas anyway.”  
  
  “Sold.”  
  
  Mason was coming down the stairs as we moved past them. He was pulling his shirt down, and I tried not to watch the movement of his abdominals or how his jeans rode low on his narrow hips. He paused when he saw us. “Where are you guys going?”  
  
  My lips were pressed tight together, and Logan smirked from behind me. He shook his head. “Whatever you said must’ve been good. You pissed your woman off. Not a good move, not on the first day of the semester.”  
  
  Wincing at how close his words hit the target, I gritted my teeth and shoved out the door.  
  
  Mason called after me, “Sam.”  
  
  “What?”  
  
  He looked ready to say something else, glanced at Logan and closed his mouth.  
  
  It didn’t matter. I didn’t want to hear it. “The coffee pot’s broken. I’m going with Logan to get some. Did you want some too? I can serve it to you, another thing to add to the ‘best way to start your last semester.’” A ball of anger rolled over me.  
  
  “Come on …” An apology flashed in those emerald eyes of his.  
  
  “You said that?” Logan chuckled. “Dumb move, dipshit.”  
  
  Moving closer to the door, Mason flashed a warning at his brother. “Give us a minute.”  
  
  “What if I don’t?”  
  
  He bared his teeth at him. “Not a request, dipshit.” Then he shoved him and stepped closer to me. His hand fell to my arm, but he added to Logan, “March. I’ll bring her.”  
  
  Logan smirked at him. “We’re going for coffee. Besides,” he gestured inside the house, “you’ve gotta wait for your other girlfriend. His car’s still blocked in from the party last night.”  
  
  “People are still here? Where is he?”  
  
  He shrugged. “Nah, they all got rides home, but their cars are still here, and as for your girlfriend, I have no idea. Check his room. I think I heard Parker down there.”  
  
  “Parker?”  
  
  “Yeah. Pretty sure I heard her voice from downstairs. I was headed down to see if he knew how to fix the coffee pot.”  
  
  Mason cursed under his breath and twisted around. His hand fell from my arm. “He agreed to the exile.”  
  
  “Guess it starts later today for him.”  
  
  “Not helping.”  
  
  “Not trying to,” Logan sniped back.  
  
  “What is your problem?”  
  
  “With you? Nothing. With your other girlfriend, figure it out.” Logan’s eyes darkened, letting his anger show.  
  
  I held my breath. There hadn’t been a lot of times when the two bickered, but I could tell that Logan was fed up. Not that I could hold it against him. I was getting fed up as well, but I knew that Mason hadn’t let his friendship with his best friend affect our relationship. Not yet. As the two glared at each other, I stepped in between them. Softening my tone, I gestured to Logan’s Escalade. “Let’s go and get coffee.”  
  
  Logan turned on his heel, his jaw rigid as he went to his vehicle.  
  
  Mason caught my wrist and held me back. “Are we okay?”  
  
  “Yeah,” I sighed. I had already melted as soon as I saw his regret earlier. “It just sucks, Mason. You’re leaving. You. Leaving. As in you’re not going to be here on a daily basis anymore. I’m not the only one bothered by that.” I jerked my head over my shoulder, where Logan had started the car and was waiting for me.  
  
  “That’s not Nate’s fault.”  
  
  “No, but it’s not the three of us or even the two of you anymore. Nate came back. This is Logan’s last semester with you, but …” I gestured inside. “Your best friend gets you for the next four years, you know. You’re leaving early for football.”  
  
  He groaned and his head fell back. “Shit, I didn’t even think of it that way.”  
  
  I shrugged. “Anyway, I really want to get some coffee, and I have to talk to my coach. He said to come by his office this morning.”  
  
  Mason’s head lifted back up and he grinned, his eyes darkening as he tugged me close. “Coach Grath is lucky to have you. He knows that.”  
  
  I was about say thanks, but then I stopped thinking. He bent closer to me. Closing my eyes, I felt his lips softly touch mine. One damn touch was all it took. A tingle began and the lust for him sparked again. I became heated as he deepened the kiss, and I burrowed closer to him.  
  
  BEEEEEP!  
  
  Jerking back, I twisted and glared at Logan, who still had his hand on the horn. He flashed me a grin, but hollered out the window, “Let’s go! You can screw later.”  
  
  “Idiot,” Mason muttered under his breath.  
  
  “He’s right. Go see Nate, see what’s going on. I’ll see you at school.”  
  
  He nodded, but flipped off his brother. Logan’s laugh was heard clearly and I gave Mason a quick wave as I got into the yellow Escalade.  
  
  Reversing the vehicle, Logan extended his middle finger in the rearview mirror and gunned the engine. He didn’t pause when we got  to the road. Clicking my seatbelt in place, I settled back in my seat. Logan liked to drive fast, but he had the reflexes to keep us safe, so I wasn’t worried. I did comment, “All you had to do was say something to him, you know. Mason’s a good brother to you.”  
  
  He jerked in his seat. His face grim. “Yeah, well, it’s easy for you to say. You’re supposed to talk to him. You don’t come across as bitching and whining.”  
  
  “I said something.”  
  
  “No.”  
  
  “Yes.” It was getting ridiculous. “You used to be friends with Nate.”  
  
  “That was before he turned shady. I know he had Parker over last night.”  
  
  “You said this morning.”  
  
  “Last night. This morning. What’s the difference? He still violated the exile. Mase won’t forget that.”  
  
  I heard the anger in his voice. It was low and underlining. Frowning, I asked, “Are you mad at Nate about something else? I thought it was just because he came back for his last semester.”  
  
  Logan jerked a shoulder up, holding the steering wheel with one hand. “What does it matter? He’s so far up Mason’s ass, I’m surprised my dipshit brother could even hear you.”  
  
  “Logan.”  
  
  “It’s true.” But his voice lost some of the aggression. “Nate’s not the same. Mason needs to know that.”  
  
  “So just tell him.”  
  
  “Why don’t you tell him?” he shot back, throwing me a sidelong glance.  
  
  “Maybe I will.”  
  
  Rolling his eyes, he looked back to the street. “Mase won’t listen to you.”  
  
  “Yes, he will.”  
  
  “No, he won’t.”  
  
  “Mason’s always listened to me.”  
  
  “Things are going to go to shit. I know it.”  
  
  I frowned, but the knot tightened again in my gut. As Logan turned into The Quickie, I agreed with him. This semester wasn’t going to be an easy one.  
  
  For anybody.  
  
  When Logan turned into the gas station, I laughed when I saw who was sitting on the bench outside of Quickie’s—Jeff. When we got out, a quick grin came over him and he stood up. His hands were pushed deep into his pants pockets and he rolled his shoulders back. His dark hair had been gelled, much the same as Logan’s, and as he came closer, I saw the idol worship he had for the younger Kade.  
  
  “Hey.”  
  
  Logan narrowed his eyes at him, but I asked, “What are you doing here?”  
  
  He jerked a shoulder up. “My car broke down.”  
  
  I glanced at his phone. “Who were you going to call for a ride?”  
  
  “Not that girl I was telling you about on Friday. She hooked up with this guy Saturday.” He gestured to Logan, who had started to reach for the gas nozzle.  
  
  “Me?”  
  
  “Yeah.” Jeff lifted a corner of his mouth up. “No worries. I’m not heartbroken. At least I know what she’s like now.”  
  
  He looked ready to say more, but Logan interrupted after he started the gas, “I’m going in. You want your coffee?”  
  
  I nodded. “Thanks.”  
  
  As he went inside, Jeff laughed to himself. “Man, I forgot how scary—” He stopped suddenly. His eyes darted past my shoulder and widened. I turned to see Mason’s black Escalade pulling into the lot. He parked next to us, on the other side of the gas pump, and hopped out. When he came around, Jeff put a few feet between us. “Hey, man. How’s it going?” His voice sounded strangled as he jerked a hand up and grabbed a fistful of his hair, making it spike even more.  
  
  Mason reached for the nozzle, but turned to me. “Logan’s inside?”  
  
  I nodded. “Where’s Nate?”  
  
  The corner of his mouth dipped down into a brief scowl. It was so quick—there and gone in the blink of an eye—but I caught it. No one else would’ve noticed it. That wasn’t good. A knot tightened in my gut. “Did he have company?”  
  
  “No, but he did last night.” Mason’s tone was cold. I knew it wasn’t because of me.  
  
  “Uh,” Jeff’s hand tightened on his hair, and he tried to give me a halfhearted grin. His other hand shoved down in his front jean pocket, and his shoulders hunched forward. “Maybe I should get going …”  
  
  “Did you call someone for a ride?”  
  
  Jeff’s eyes darted back to Mason.  
  
  Even though he was filling his vehicle with gas and his back was turned to us, I knew he was listening. He was waiting for Jeff to leave.  
  
  “Did you?”  
  
  “Not yet, but since you’re here …” His voice trailed off again. “Oh shit.”  
  
  Two car doors slammed shut, but it wasn’t the sound of them or the alarm that flitted over Jeff’s face that sent alarms off in me.  
  
  It was Mason.  
  
  He wasn’t moving. An unnatural stillness had come over him. His hand fell from the nozzle, and he stopped everything for a second. It was a small pause as he took a breath. It lasted only a second. Then his hand reached over and he flipped up the handle so the gas stopped. The nozzle was left in his vehicle as he walked forward.  
  
  Then I saw them.  
  
  Brett and Budd Broudou. They had gotten out of their car and one yelled inside it, “Hurry up, Shannon. We’ve only got twenty minutes and you’re going to make us late.”  
  
  She climbed out from the back seat, straightening her skirt so her ass didn’t hang out. “Shut up, Brett. I’ll take my time if I want to.”  
  
  “No, you won’t,” Budd interjected. “Not unless you want to call for your own ride. You better piss here too. We’re not stopping.”  
  
  Her lips clamped shut, but if looks could kill.  
  
  Her older brother didn’t care. He gave her a look of death right back. “Bitch.”  
  
  “Screw you.” Jerking forward, she tried to hurry inside but stopped and slowed to a casual walk. Her shirt had ridden up, showing a good dose of skin, including the top of her butt crack. Muttering under her breath, she reached up and pulled it back down. As both her brothers started laughing, she turned towards them, but stopped when she caught sight of us.  
  
  Mason was in front of his vehicle, a human wall between them and me. I knew he had done it on purpose, but I was surprised when Jeff took two steps and positioned himself in the same manner. He was facing them squarely with me right behind him.  
  
  I scooted to see what was going on, but Jeff moved with me. When I went to the right, he went to the right. “Stop. He doesn’t want them to see you.”  
  
  I started to protest, but remembered how Heather had acted when they were at Manny’s. She’d been terrified. Heeding all of their warnings, I stayed put. If Budd recognized me from that night, he’d say something and that was still a conversation I needed to have with Mason.  
  
  Then Logan came out of the gas station. He had two coffees in hand with his head down, clueless of the Broudou brothers as he crossed the lot. There still hadn’t been a word spoken between the brothers and Mason. Yet.  
  
  It was coming.  
  
  A shiver went down my spine.  
  
  Slipping my hand inside my pocket, I made sure my phone was there and pulled it out. If they made one violent move, I was calling 911. I wasn’t going to risk them being hurt. Mason’s future had already been threatened by Analise. It wasn’t going to be threatened again.  
  
  Then it happened.  
  
  I gulped as I watched it in slow motion. Logan stepped forward, he frowned, and then lifted his head. His eyes found me first. He paused. His foot came down hard in mid-step and he glanced around. He saw Mason before he trailed his head where they were.  
  
  It was as if they’d been waiting for him to join.  
  
  Everything happened then, at the same time.  
  
  Shannon’s features scrunched together in an ugly snarl. Her hands found her heavier hips and her arms pinched the sides of her breasts, making them rise from the motion. It was then when her brothers saw us too.  
  
  I jerked forward.  
  
  Mason shifted in front of his car, and Logan disappeared from my eyesight. I moved to see better, but Jeff moved with me, obscuring my view.  
  
  “Stop.” I  
tried to push him aside.  
  
  He remained facing them, but his hand went behind him to touch my arm. “Get in the car, Sam.”  
  
  “No.”  
  
  He hissed, “Get in the car! Now.”  
  
  “No.”  
  
  They weren’t going to do anything to them. They couldn’t. Terror started to rise up, and the hair on the back of my neck stood up.  
  
  They couldn’t hurt Mason or Logan.  
  
  Then a low baritone spoke up, “Kade.”  
  
  The other one added, “Shannon, go inside and get your coffee.”  
  
  “No!” she hissed. “I’m staying, Brett.”  
  
  “What are you doing here, Budd?” Mason asked. I closed my eyes, falling against Logan’s Escalade. He sounded in control, amused even, and a wave of relief went through me at the sound. That meant he was fully in control of the situation. “Quickie’s is in Fallen Crest territory. Not Roussou.”  
  
  “Sam,” Jeff twisted around, his cheeks flushed from insistence. “Get inside.”  
  
  “Who’s that over there?”  
  
  I held my breath, and Jeff froze.  
  
  That was Budd speaking.  
  
  “What are you talking about?” Logan tried to sound casual.  
  
  One of them, probably Budd, snorted. “You’re hiding someone. I heard you have a girlfriend, Mason. That true?”  
  
  “Is that her back there?” Brett added.  
  
  “You never answered my question.” Mason’s tone went cold as ice. “What are you doing here?”  
  
  A shrill, but cocky laugh came from them. “We don’t live far from your butt-buddy’s home. Remember? Quickie’s is on the way to Roussou.”  
  
  “That’s right.” Soft gravel was smashed down. Mason must’ve taken a step forward. His tone was full of quiet authority. “You have a farm a few miles away.”  
  
  Logan let loose with a swift curse. “Forget that. This is Fallen Crest. What are you doing coming to this gas station?”  
  
  “Fuck off, Kade.”  
  
  Mason spoke again, a lethal note in his voice, “This is our town. You’re not welcome here.”  
  
  “Last time you came around here, your cars exploded. Are you back for round two?”  
  
  I shook my head. That was enough; I had to see. I pushed forward, but Jeff caught me. His arms came around me, and he opened the door before lifting me inside.  
  
  “Jeff!”  
  
  “Stop.” The serious warning in his voice made me pause. I hadn’t heard that from him, not in a long time, and my eyes widened. There was a grave note in his usually jovial brown depths. They were as flat as the scowl that hadn’t lifted from his face. His hand went and caught his hair, grabbing chunks of it again. “Just stop, Sam. Stay here.”  
  
  I didn’t say a word as he shut the door and then started forward. His hands went into his pockets and his skinny shoulders hunched down. I knew it was his ‘I’m serious’ walk. It used to excite me during the first year we dated, but it wasn’t amusing anymore. My mouth went dry, and I sat back in the seat.  
  
  Jeff was serious. Jeff was never serious.  
  
  Through the car, I heard Mason’s muffled voice. “Take your sister and leave.”  
  
  Someone snorted. “Who’s in the car?”  
  
  “Leave.”  
  
  “Tsk, tsk, Mason. Your little bro is showing his cards. He must care for her as much as you do.” The voice grew louder as if he’d stepped closer. “Come on, just between you and me. Your little bro loves her, too, doesn’t he? At least, that’s what I’ve heard.”  
  
  Then there was silence. I had stopped breathing and clung to the car’s upholstery. My fingers dug into the seat, and I couldn’t move. It was like a nightmare coming to life. Then I heard a scream. That was it. Flinging open the door, I rushed out. Jeff caught me in the air. “Come on, Sam.”  
  
  I heard another scream followed by a car’s brakes and then a thud. Someone was on the ground. I knew it. “Let me go.” I dug my nails into his arm.  
  
  “No.” He cursed, flinching as I drew blood. “They left me to watch you. Stop it.”  
  
  I dug harder, hard enough that he cried out in pain, and I was dropped. Scrambling up, I burst around Logan’s car. Then I heaved to a stop. Mason and Logan were a united front, but Nate was there, too. All three stood next to each other, another human wall.  
  
  Someone was on the ground, and the girl cried out again, “Pick him up, Brett! You’re so damn slow.”  
  
  “Shut up, Shannon. Open the door.”  
  
  The body was hoisted from the ground, but I couldn’t see who it was anymore. A car door was slammed shut, then two more followed it. The car reversed and sped off as dirt kicked up from the tires. There was five seconds of silence before Logan threw his head back and howled in laughter. He clapped Nate on the shoulder. “I can’t believe you did that.”  
  
  Nate’s shoulder tensed under his hand, but he shrugged. “Trying to make up. I’ve recently learned that I’ve been a dick lately.”  
  
  “You have.” Logan kept chuckling, turning to see me. “You missed it, Sam. Nate clipped Budd Broudou with his car.”  
  
  Mason’s eyes narrowed at Nate. “What were you going to do? You hopped out of your car like you were going to take a bat to him.”  
  
  Nate shrugged again. A brief glimmer of regret crossed his face, but it was gone instantly. “I needed to make sure he stayed down … and to make sure that I won’t get sued.”  
  
  “He’s down now. Don’t worry, you just clipped him. Budd’s a cockroach. They think a lawsuit is a pansy way to deal with a fight.” Logan’s hand was still on him, and he used it to push up from the ground in a semi-skip. His eyes sparked from giddiness. Before I knew what he was doing, he had rushed over to me, and I was thrown over his shoulder. “That was awesome, Sam. I can’t believe you missed that. Shit. I’m horny.”  
  
  “On that note.” An arm slid underneath my waist and I was lifted from him. Mason slid me down his body and kept his arms around me. I wasn’t inclined to leave his shelter. He spoke near my ear, a deep chuckle in his voice, “I’ll be taking Sam with me to school.”  
  
  “Whatever.” Logan’s grin widened. “I’m off then. Got something to do.” He darted to his Escalade, stopping once to punch Jeff in the arm before he climbed in and took off.  
  
  “Ow! That hurt. Oh, Sam. Hey …”  
  
  I knew what he was going to ask and started to answer, but Mason beat me to it. “We’ll give you a ride.”  
  
  Jeff flashed a bright smile quickly before the stoic mask of coolness slid back into place. I shook my head. This would be interesting. Mason didn’t wait around. He got into the front and I climbed into the passenger seat. Jeff got into the back. No one said a word as he turned onto the road leading to Fallen Crest Academy.  
  
  The irony didn’t escape me—my boyfriend was driving my ex-boyfriend to my old school. A lot had changed in such a short amount of time.  
  
  “So, um,” Jeff started, leaning forward, “how much does one of these cost, Mason?

There's been a few promotions in my work place (me included) and now Stacy (47F) has taken it upon herself to organize a last minute lunch/dinner for everyone at 2:30 this afternoon. The problem is that I (32F) have to work until 4. She comes up to me, while I'm getting some coffee, and says ""You're really gonna miss a lot if you don't show up.""

Like what can I do? I have bills to pay and I don't even know half of the people she's invited and although I don't care to go, she's gonna make it personal if I don't show up.

I just told Stacy ""I have bills to pay and can't just skip out whenever.""

She's pouting now (setting her coffee mug down loudly and huffing) and idk why it's such a big deal. We tolerate each other and I don't even care to hang out with coworkers. I'm honestly glad I have to work later than usual. I'll catch dinner highlights when everyone comes in Monday.",2,1752322378.0,AITAH,2,0.76,False
