However, the trend is started to upset a few parents and teachers across the country, believing that it was geared towards children, and promoting hate speech, including one teacher, who was shocked to see what some of her students were pretending to be. As we all know, some of these characters to spawn from the trend, such as ""Tralalero Tralala,"" a shark wearing blue Nike kicks, and ""Bombardino Crocodilo,"" a crocodile infused with a bomber plane, contain offensive phrases, mocking God, or even terrorism. The teacher called the principal to ban the meme, and other schools responded, making new rules about certain trends.",1,1748642996.0,FutureWhatIf,0,1.0,False
1kzgysp,https://www.reddit.com/r/philly/comments/1kzgysp/fairmount_francisville/,Fairmount/ Francisville?,"Looking to move to the edge of Francisville/Fairmount end of my lease term (end of August). Currently live in old city. Would like some honest advice regarding the pros and cons of that area (16th and Brown St). Just finishing my first year in Philly. Here are the things I liked about Old City:
-History, charm (cobble stone streets and architecture) 
-Cute shops - coffee shops, boutiques, Riverwards 
-Fairly Clean 

What I don‚Äôt like - 
-Increased homeless population (new shelter across my apartment) 
- Expensive 
- Taking 2 subways to get to work 
-Groceries Stollen 
-Loud at night with cars and ambulances/ Patco behind my building 
-Mostly nice people, but some stuck up rude people in the community that make their presence known 

I am nervous to move (but excited). Mostly worried I will move and dislike the location. According to Google Maps my commute will be shorter to work which is good. Also is close to a dog park I can bring my dog to. The citizen App says Francisville has some crime, ranked (high) on the app, which surprised me. It is ranked higher than the crime rate in old city. 

End of day I am looking to be somewhere clean, safe, fairly quiet, slightly removed, but easily accessible to the other parts of the city. Also saving a ton of money with this new place which is also a plus! I don‚Äôt want to be far from CC but I do not want to be right in the middle either! 

looking forward to your feedback :)",1,1748642901.0,philly,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm not a professional musician, but I‚Äôm a decent singer and I‚Äôve been playing guitar for about 12 or 13 years. I taught myself through YouTube.

My partner and I moved into my parents' house two years ago so we could finish our degrees. We pay rent, cook for ourselves, have our own car‚Äîwe‚Äôre not dependent on them. I regret taking up my dad‚Äôs offer. I thought maybe being away for three years had changed my mom. She was so kind when I wasn‚Äôt living here. But no. She‚Äôs exactly the same abusive person she‚Äôs always been. We fight all the time now.

Lately, I‚Äôve been singing and playing guitar more often, usually right after dropping my partner off at work. I love doing it in the morning with my coffee. But guess what? My mom will suddenly turn on her karaoke machine, crank the volume, and start singing over me.

She‚Äôs told me before she can‚Äôt sing. She knows she‚Äôs not good. She once admitted all her siblings can sing but she can‚Äôt. She‚Äôs completely out of tune and mostly just screams. She's also complimented me before (maybe once or twice). I used to post covers on FB/YouTube and got a lot of likes so she knows that people like my singing. I‚Äôve noticed she only does this after I play or sing. But today was different‚Äîshe didn‚Äôt even wait. I was mid-song when she blasted the karaoke and started wailing.

We haven‚Äôt spoken in two months since a big fight. She‚Äôs been hiding our things, and I caught her throwing some of them away. My dad just watches her. I‚Äôve defended him before when she was verbally attacking him. Same with my golden child sister. I‚Äôve literally stepped between them when things got physical. Yet they just sit there while she treats me and my partner like trash.

I wasn‚Äôt even being that loud‚Äîjust enough for her to hear from her room, I guess. But she just *had* to steal the spotlight.

Today I stopped, walked into the living room with a smirk, and picked up the vacuum sitting next to her. She immediately went quiet and stopped singing. What an insecure mess.

I‚Äôm almost done with my degree. The day I finish, I‚Äôm packing my stuff and leaving. I‚Äôm not looking back.",1,1748642897.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False
1kzgxoa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1kzgxoa/how_to_make_a_first_sleepover_not_awkward/,How to make a first sleepover not awkward??,"I'm divorced in my 30s and about to have a sleepover next weekend with a guy (27) I've been casually seeing for a couple months. At first we were strictly fwb, no sleepovers, and neither of us looking for anything serious... But he's been showing increasing care, proximity, and vulnerability around me recently, has shared some really personal stuff,, and yesterday suggested spending the whole next weekend together (if I was okay with it). 

But I'm nervous about it because firstly, I'm like a gremlin in the morning. I go from bubbly and cute at night to tired and awkward in the AM, and I swear I look terrible too. I need my coffee and quiet time to prep for the day, and my social energy is pretty low. As well, what if I snore or have weird bedtime/morning habits that turn him off?? I haven't had a sleepover with a man in over a year, and he was a long term partner. So the last time I did a sleepover with a new partner I was in my 20s and feeling a little less yucky when I wake up. 

I was thinking about making him breakfast in the morning too, and I'm a pretty decent cook, but now I'm feeling self-conscious about cooking in front of him (what if I burn everything?!). And I also feel worried about making it too much of a ""thing"", like going over the top with breakfast and stuff. 

He's a bachelor and younger than me like I said, and pretty good with just ""hanging"", whereas I'm more structured and a bit rigid post-divorce.

 We are also planning on having a few drinks, so waking up hungover on minimal sleep and looking like it and being awkward is a scary prospect for me. 

Any tips on breakfast, the sleepover itself, or anything at all to make it go smoothly? Any big DOs or DON'Ts? ",1,1748642820.0,AskMenAdvice,6,1.0,False

1kzgwgv,https://i.redd.it/5sjsmx3msz3f1.jpeg,Black magic,"I had the Mai Kai‚Äôs black magic on my recent visit and was really disappointed with the quality so I thought I‚Äôd try recreating it at home. 
I used Appleton 12 as the ‚Äúdark Jamaican, elsewhere in the article they seem to be referring to a Jamaican with some age I think they recommended Appleton Signature in an earlier version, I used Hamilton pot still gold instead of the Spanish style and Hamilton Pot still black as the black rum (because I‚Äôm sure as hell not using a Bacardi). It‚Äôs certainly a bitter forward cocktail the coffe and grapefruit along with angostura just push it that way. I also used 1.5 oz of espresso chilled for the coffee element. This was better than the watered down concoction I was served at the Mai Kai only because I can taste the layers of flavor where what I had at the Mai Kai was just to watered down to discern any complexity, this also has a very noticeable amount of flavor from the actual rum where the Mai Kai was very much lacking in any alcohol punch. I can tell this has 3.5 oz of rum in it for sure. This is probably not going to make my favorites list but I enjoyed making it and trying it at home.

I've been reclusive AF and thought maybe I could re-integrate myself with life again slowly and gently at coffee shops with people (where I can leave easily if I get overstimulated). I also have PTSD, so.. there's that. 

Anyway, despite not really being able to afford it, I came to a coffee shop today to try to (at least) experience normal life vicariously by listening to people talk to each other. My doctors & therapists are great people - but, geez, I could use some friends - or even casual acquaintances üôÑ

But after some serious reflection, it hit me hard. It‚Äôs astonishing how much self-dominance can reshape a day. I remember waking up and immediately my mind would spiral‚Äîsometimes before I even had my first sip of coffee. Now, I approach the morning like I‚Äôve got a remote control for my brain, flipping through channels until I find the one that lifts me up.

Recently, while journaling some thoughts over at canvas.vkcreativecircle.com, I explored this idea of controlling what I let into my mind. It was like discovering my mental clutter was just waiting for a spring cleaning. Who knew that simply recognizing my thought patterns could lead to such significant shifts? I might still feel overwhelmed some days, but now I have ways to reroute my focus, like practicing mindful breathing or visualizing a calm scene.

But here‚Äôs the thing‚Äîwhy does it always feel like such an uphill battle? Honestly, some days I feel like I‚Äôm winning, and other days, my thoughts just run wild. It's such a crazy contradiction. And even with my new tools, I catch myself thinking, ‚ÄúIs there something fundamentally wrong with me when I can‚Äôt get it right?‚Äù

1kzgqa1,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiranagar/comments/1kzgqa1/went_on_a_movie_date_with_a_fellow_redditor/,Went on a Movie Date with a Fellow Redditor,"Disclaimer - It's little long. And TL;DR wouldn't do justice to it. 

Here we go: A few weeks back, I went on a movie date with a fellow Redditor. We planned diligently over chat and finalized the cinema hall and movie. It was somewhere in between where we live. I reached a little early. We met on the escalator. Crazy, isn't it? I messed up the very intro and was like, ""Gone. She's gonna run away now.""

Okay, let me tell you about her too. She was beautiful, soft-spoken, calm, and intelligent. I didn't expect any of these things. She bought the popcorn (which was quite costly for a college student), while the tickets were on me. We talked a little more and went inside the hall to watch the movie. We kept on talking while watching the movie. In between, I was explaining a few things to her as she wasn't aware of the previous part of the movie franchise.

Okay, all went well. We came out. I asked her about her experience. It was nice for her too. We came out of the mall, crossed the skywalk, and it was time for goodbye. I asked her, ""How are we gonna be in touch?"" Her reply was ""via Reddit only."" I was a little sad (without showing her). I offered to drop her, but she chose a different mode. I thought it was all just until here.

While coming back in the auto/bus, I kept on ridiculing myself for messing up the intro and at a few times while talking about general things. I tried my level best to not make her uncomfortable at any point in time.

But to my surprise, later on she messaged that it was nice meeting and she would like to meet again if both of us are free. To which I said, definitely.

It was her exam time. I didn't want to bother her. So, I reached out to her again after a week. At first, the messages went unnoticed. But after another week, she replied that she cannot make it (going out again) due to her other priorities. I requested/insisted but of no use. 

I think she's not into it anymore. And I respect that. And I decided to stop messaging her. Btw, there's nothing bad between us. I can still message her but choosing not to for obvious reasons.

So, here the gist of feelings - 

Good part: at least she showed up. I wasn't sure, but she did. She's a very cooperative person.


Not so good part (context again): she's quite 7 years younger than me. Let me be clear so that I don't get bashed or called a pervert. I clearly communicated this to her, and she was fine. I was fine because I really wanted some company (girl btw) to watch that movie. Context ends. 

I wish I had met someone around my age. Then maybe we would still be in touch or planning to go out on weekends, watch movies, explore the city, etc.

Even in my personal journal for that day, I wrote that it was a nice day with a very nice person. But let it end here, as I'm too old for her, and she's too young for me. Let her focus on her education, as she has a really bright future.

So yeah, this was my story. What's your suggestion, fellow Bangaloreans?

Also, if any girl (strictly around my age this time) is up for a movie or coffee date, I‚Äôm open to it!

I‚Äôm not here trying to excuse anything I did but just seek some clarity. 

I have always been a very outgoing person and that‚Äôs why I think my girlfriend, we‚Äôll call her Kate, was attracted to me initially. She was about to graduate college in the south part of the city I live and would move up closer to me so we could continue our relationship or else I never would‚Äôve considered it. The town she goes to college in is full of preppy individuals that I just can‚Äôt get along with. The main issue started when she was about to graduate and wanted to celebrate. 

That night I promised her I would drive down to see her and spend some time with her roommates to celebrate their accomplishments. We‚Äôre going to hit a few bars and go home before the night was too late since I had work the next day. Everyone was excited and laughing the whole uber ride, Kate was holding my hand and cuddling me as we hadn‚Äôt seen each other in a few days. 

We get to the first bar and it‚Äôs already a little rough. I had been to this place a few times and actually had been a part of a fight (not my fault, mistaken identity) so I was really on edge the entire time. I was checking my surroundings and chatting it up with some people around me while my girlfriend spent some time dancing with her friends. When they come back from the dance floor she seemed off but I thought she was tired. We ended up leaving pretty soon after and I didn‚Äôt think anything of it. 

We hit the second bar and that‚Äôs when she sat me down and we started talking. She was upset I didn‚Äôt pay her enough attention and thought I was looking at other girls. I tried to explain the situation but the tequila kept the rational away so I decided to drop it for a bit. I buy everyone a round to try to bring the energy back up and it does for a while. They want to go to one last bar for their friend so we take off. 

This last bar was in fact a gay bar (no judgement, just important later) and I had never been. Now to preface this a little I am fairly attractive dude. I do have what most people would consider a ‚Äúdump truck‚Äù or a big butt for a guy and I get a decent amount of attention for it. I didn‚Äôt know just how bad it would be in there or I would‚Äôve gone home. 

The first encounter I had was a man coming and grabbing my ass and hitting on me. I declined and asked him to leave so he did. Not but 5 minutes later the second guy slid me a drink across the bar and told me to meet him in the bathroom for ‚Äúthe best 5 minutes of your life‚Äù to which I dumped out the drink and walked away from the bar. None of them bothered me like the last guy did. 

The last man I‚Äôll call Brett, was wasted beyond comprehension. Brett had his eyes on me for a while and made his move maybe 10 minutes after I sat down. He reached over the balcony I was sitting under and started grabbing at my face and hair. I freaked out as he was behind me and he started to shush me. He kept repeating ‚ÄúI just wanna talk‚Äù and wouldn‚Äôt leave me alone. After a bit Brett tried it again to which I grabbed his hand and yanked him down to the same level as me. I‚Äôm not proud of it but no one faults me for doing it. After his friends come pull him away from me, we all decide to leave and go home for the night. 

The whole drive back Kate refuses to look at me. She‚Äôs in the front seat staring straight ahead the whole way as I‚Äôm with her friend in the backseat. She‚Äôs talking to me and apologizing for suggesting the bar but I keep telling her it‚Äôs ok. We finally get back to the apartment and I quickly run to Kate‚Äôs room to shower. I felt awful and I just needed to do something. After the shower Kate is laying in her bed on her phone. I ask her how she‚Äôs doing and then she unloads everything onto me. 

She starts by accusing me of cheating on her at the first bar. There were 2 girls in the group but I was pretty sure they were taken so I didn‚Äôt think anything of it. I try to push back but she‚Äôs fairly drunk still as she didn‚Äôt have any of the shock I had to sober me up. She then talked about how I was trying to bribe her friends after I fucked up by buying some drinks for everyone. I don‚Äôt even have time to retort before she throws in the thought that I was probably flirting with those guys first and I had gotten what I asked for. I just stood in the doorway completely shaken. I was just assaulted and my own girlfriend was more concerned about if I asked for it than if I was ok. I left the room and slept on her couch because I wasn‚Äôt in the right mind to drive. 

The next morning her roommate got up before anyone and started some coffee so we talked while it brewed. I had called in since I was still shaken but was about to go home when Kate comes out of the room in tears apologizing. I tell her it‚Äôs fine as she was drunk but that we really needed to have a serious talk. She just frowned at me and said that‚Äôs fine but wanted to know what we were talking about out here. I told her we were talking about the night before and she blew up. She started yelling at both of us for going behind her back to talk about something so personal and sensitive. 

I usually let it go but I was just so upset about how everything played out that I couldn‚Äôt hold back. Every feeling I had from that night came rushing back as we got into a screaming argument. She doubled down on the cheating allegations but added that I was ‚Äúemotionally cheating‚Äù on her with her roommate. I had enough of it and left her house that night and we haven‚Äôt spoken since. 

It‚Äôs been about a week and her friends are telling me I went too far yelling at her. A couple of my friends think I blew it out of proportion but most are on my side. Should I apologize? I really did think I could marry this girl but I just don‚Äôt know",1,1748641951.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

I know Reddit isn‚Äôt exactly known for great or long-term connections, but hey, figured I‚Äôd put this out there for anyone looking for something a bit more real than the swipe fatigue.



I‚Äôm 28, based in the UK, and no, I don‚Äôt actually go around saying, 'right, what‚Äôs all this then?' If that joke or meme is a mystery to you, feel free to ignore my nonsense lol. I‚Äôm not expecting instant replies, life happens, but it‚Äôd be nice to find something that flows. Something you actually look forward to. Rare, but not impossible.



I‚Äôm a massive fiction nerd. After work, all I want is to disappear into another world with a good book. I keep telling myself I‚Äôll get back into reading history, but so far it‚Äôs mostly just Sabaton keeping the dream alive. I‚Äôm seeing them live later this year, which is proof I still love history, even if it‚Äôs in a slightly unconventional way. Definitely better than abandoning it altogether, even if uni tried its best to crush my soul with an enormous reading list. Spoiler: I never followed it. This is me, master of excuses and self-justifications. üòÄ If you‚Äôre into bands with historical flair or just like great live music, I‚Äôd definitely recommend them.



Currently reading a bit of a guilty pleasure genre. Still fun though. You can ask what it is if you‚Äôre feeling brave. Or guess. Bonus points if you‚Äôve got your own guilty pleasure read, or watch, or playlist to swap.



I‚Äôve also caught the running bug. Help! Got into it on a whim, became even more obsessed after my first race, and now I‚Äôm deep in the running cult. Minus the influencer energy. I‚Äôm not above posting my Strava stats on Insta, but I‚Äôm definitely not cool enough for the curated fitness reel life. The meditative state during a good run, the post-race high, and a good coffee or pint after, all part of the running cult I happily subscribe to.

As a self-confessed member of said cult, I feel like you should reciprocate the baring of my soul. What cult are you part of? ü§£



Now that I‚Äôve rambled like I‚Äôm overly caffeinated, (cough cough,) I am, it‚Äôs only fair you tell me about yourself. What‚Äôs your thing? What‚Äôs the hobby or obsession you‚Äôd like me to get into?



Honestly, I just enjoy getting to know people. The deep stuff, the dumb stuff, all the in-between. I‚Äôm into tangents, chats that spiral in the best way, and before we know it, we've landed somewhere unexpectedly lovely. For me, amazing conversations are when we forget about time, doesn't matter whether it's serious or lighthearted, the next thing we know, we've been chatting for hours. Basically, the kind of connection that actually feels like something worth seeing through, wherever it leads,. I‚Äôm open to all the detours, as long as it‚Äôs real.



Got a book that‚Äôll hit me in the best way? A running tip that doesn‚Äôt involve buying yet another pair of shoes? I‚Äôm listening.

But, a few weeks back I got a sudden itch to start writing Rookanis fanfiction, and...one thing led to another xD. Technically it started out as me expanding on a writing prompt I had written over on the regular Dragon Age subreddit. The prompt had been ""Daggers"", so I wrote a part of Coffee with the Crows, where Rook gives Lucanis the wyvern tooth dagger.

Anyway, that piece soon became part of a series, of which I've currently written 13 pieces of various lengths.

And then I thought, why not share them on Ao3? So, last week I send a request to join up, and today I got said invite.

[Through Time, Forever Yours](https://archiveofourown.org/works/66037462/chapters/170166859) is the collective name of my series, and so far I've uploaded two chapters, titled ""When We Were Young"" and ""Dance With Me"" respectively. The Rook I use in the series is my personal one named Nimue de Riva, an elven spellblade mage.

I don't know yet when I'll be uploading the next one, since I'm trying to figure out if I want to do one more ""pre-game"" chapter, before actually doing the chapters which take place during/surrounding the game's events. (I actually want to do one about the intro blurb during CC (the Antaam quest that leads Rook to work with Varric)

Here we go: A few weeks back, I went on a movie date with a fellow Redditor. We planned diligently over chat and finalized the cinema hall and movie. It was somewhere in between where we live. I reached a little early. We met on the escalator. Crazy, isn't it? I messed up the very intro and was like, ""Gone. She's gonna run away now.""

Okay, let me tell you about her too. She was beautiful, soft-spoken, calm, and intelligent. I didn't expect any of these things. She bought the popcorn (which was quite costly for a college student), while the tickets were on me. We talked a little more and went inside the hall to watch the movie. We kept on talking while watching the movie. In between, I was explaining a few things to her as she wasn't aware of the previous part of the movie franchise.

Okay, all went well. We came out. I asked her about her experience. It was nice for her too. We came out of the mall, crossed the skywalk, and it was time for goodbye. I asked her, ""How are we gonna be in touch?"" Her reply was ""via Reddit only."" I was a little sad (without showing her). I offered to drop her, but she chose a different mode. I thought it was all just until here.

While coming back in the auto/bus, I kept on ridiculing myself for messing up the intro and at a few times while talking about general things. I tried my level best to not make her uncomfortable at any point in time.

But to my surprise, later on she messaged that it was nice meeting and she would like to meet again if both of us are free. To which I said, definitely.

It was her exam time. I didn't want to bother her. So, I reached out to her again after a week. At first, the messages went unnoticed. But after another week, she replied that she cannot make it (going out again) due to her other priorities. I requested/insisted but of no use. 

I think she's not into it anymore. And I respect that. And I decided to stop messaging her. Btw, there's nothing bad between us. I can still message her but choosing not to for obvious reasons.

So, here the gist of feelings - 

Good part: at least she showed up. I wasn't sure, but she did. She's a very cooperative person.


Not so good part (context again): she's quite 7 years younger than me. Let me be clear so that I don't get bashed or called a pervert. I clearly communicated this to her, and she was fine. I was fine because I really wanted some company (girl btw) to watch that movie. Context ends. 

I wish I had met someone around my age. Then maybe we would still be in touch or planning to go out on weekends, watch movies, explore the city, etc.

Even in my personal journal for that day, I wrote that it was a nice day with a very nice person. But let it end here, as I'm too old for her, and she's too young for me. Let her focus on her education, as she has a really bright future.

So yeah, this was my story. What's your suggestion, fellow Bangaloreans?

Also, if any girl (strictly around my age this time) is up for a movie or coffee date, I‚Äôm open to it!

Got thrush. Had it in 2023 from 2 different antibiotics simultaneously. Tried lozenges- great but didn‚Äôt get it out of the back of my tongue. Tried nystatin, didn‚Äôt think it worked but it ended up going away. Been fine since then, September 2023

This time I have no insurance. A young nurse is helping me with medication. She didn‚Äôt tell me to take it after meals. So it‚Äôs been Monday- Friday taking it when I wake up, before lunch, evening, before bed. I wait 30 min but I do brush my teeth since it‚Äôs so sugary and thick, I don‚Äôt rinse with water though 

My tongue looked great last night- on the right track. I had almond butter filled hard pretzels from Trader Joe‚Äôs. Mistake. My tongue went wild at 1 am. I looked up every food I considered and I thought those 2 were ok. Obviously not soft pretzels- I‚Äôve been avoiding all the top offenders- alcohol, coffee, tea, dessert, bread. She sent in 2 fluconozale pills which I don‚Äôt think is enough and will have bad side effects. I liked nystatin because it was safe

It looks less bad today but not as amazing progress as last night. I‚Äôm taking a probiotic acediphilus. But I only have the rest of today, 2 full days, and Monday morning left of nystatin. Been swallowing it after. I don‚Äôt think the week is enough.. NHS says take for 2 more days after that on their site. Idk what to do. I bought coconut oil too

My tongue is the only issue, no crazy symptoms. I feel for the long haulers here. But it went away for me in 2023. Im otherwise healthy. I just need better guidance. TIA",1,1748640918.0,Candida,0,1.0,False
1kzg6za,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/comments/1kzg6za/life_with_3_under_3_a_beautiful_chaotic_symphony/,"Life with 3 Under 3: A Beautiful, Chaotic Symphony ‚ù§Ô∏è","Some people collect stamps. Others climb mountains. Me? I‚Äôm raising three tiny humans under the age of three. One just turned three in July. One just turned two‚Ä¶ also in July. And the newest member of our sleep-deprived circus made their debut in mid-March. Welcome to the wild, soul-stretching, joy-soaked, chaotic adventure that is parenting three under three.

Let‚Äôs be real: this isn‚Äôt just a season of life. This is the Olympics of parenting. It‚Äôs a marathon and a sprint. It‚Äôs being covered in peanut butter and baby spit-up while also trying to potty-train a toddler and soothe a colicky newborn‚Äîall before your first cup of coffee.

The Mornings: A Symphony of Screams and Snuggles

Mornings begin early. Not ‚Äújust-before-the-alarm‚Äù early‚Äîprehistoric era early. Like, ‚Äúit‚Äôs-still-dark-and-I‚Äôm-not-sure-if-it‚Äôs-yesterday-or-tomorrow‚Äù early. The baby starts rustling, grunting like a little pug in a swaddle. The 2-year-old, who insists on waking up with the energy of a squirrel on espresso, is already bouncing in their crib yelling, ‚ÄúMOMMMMMMYYYYY!‚Äù And the 3-year-old? He‚Äôs standing two inches from your face, whispering about dinosaurs or how he ""accidentally"" colored on the wall again.

You drag yourself to the kitchen, juggling a baby on one hip while the toddlers argue over who gets the blue plate. You warm bottles, pour milk, peel bananas, cut toast into dinosaur shapes (heaven help you if you cut it into triangles instead). One kid is crying because their banana broke in half. The other is crying because the baby got more attention. The baby is crying because‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre a baby.

And still‚Äîthere‚Äôs something so magical in this madness. Three pairs of bedhead. Tiny feet shuffling on kitchen tile. Sticky hands reaching for you. Morning breath kisses and mismatched pajamas and cereal spilled across the floor like edible confetti.

The Days: Chaos with a Side of Cuteness

The bulk of the day is a mixture of diapers, snacks, and survival.

Your 3-year-old is in the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù phase. Why is the sky blue? Why does poop smell? Why can‚Äôt he put spaghetti in the DVD player? You try to answer patiently, but somewhere around the 142nd ""why,"" you start questioning everything you‚Äôve ever believed.

Meanwhile, the 2-year-old is in their full-blown chaos era. They climb furniture like it‚Äôs American Ninja Warrior. They color on walls, on siblings, on the dog if you blink. Their favorite food changes hourly. One moment, chicken nuggets are their lifeblood. The next? ‚ÄúYucky! This is poison!‚Äù (direct quote.)

Then there‚Äôs the baby. Oh, sweet third baby. A velcro infant. Always in your arms, or screaming to be. Their naps are delicate negotiations that require the noise levels of a monastery and the swaddling skills of a sushi chef.

You can‚Äôt run errands without feeling like a traveling circus. Strapping three car seats in and out, hauling a diaper bag that could sustain a small village, pushing a double stroller while wearing the baby in a wrap‚Äîit‚Äôs a full-body workout that deserves a medal. Strangers stare. Some smile. Some say, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got your hands full!‚Äù (Thanks, Carol. Insightful.)

Laundry? A mountain range. Dishes? Never-ending. Your house smells faintly of diapers and baby wipes, and you haven‚Äôt peed alone in 1,000 years. But you catch them giggling together, sharing a snack, snuggling on the couch, and you think: Okay. This. This is worth every ounce of it.

The Naps: A Treasured, Delicate Artform

Getting three small children to nap at the same time is a tactical operation worthy of military funding. You bounce the baby while singing gently. You rock the toddler while reading Goodnight Moon for the sixth time. The 3-year-old swears he‚Äôs ‚Äúnot tired,‚Äù even as he literally sleepwalks into the wall.

But if you manage to synchronize them‚Äîif‚Äîyou win the jackpot: one glorious hour where the house falls silent. A golden hour for showering, or folding laundry, or laying in a fetal position questioning your life choices. Or maybe just scrolling through photos of your kids and missing them, because apparently, parenthood makes you clinically insane.

The Evenings: Tantrums and Tenderness

By 5 PM, you‚Äôre counting the seconds until bedtime. Energy is low. Screaming is high. The toddler has melted down because their sock is ""too socky."" The preschooler is mad that the baby ‚Äúlooked at him too loud.‚Äù You‚Äôve cooked a meal no one eats, and now someone has peed on the floor.

Bath time is a splash zone. It‚Äôs bubbles and giggles and shampoo in someone‚Äôs eye. It‚Äôs slippery limbs, squabbles over toys, and at least one naked jailbreak attempt. Then it‚Äôs pajamas and stories and a wrestling match disguised as brushing teeth.

But then, somehow, peace settles in.

The baby nestles into your chest, milk drunk and soft. The toddlers climb into their beds, cheeks flushed, eyes heavy, and ask for just one more hug. And you give it, and a thousand more. Because for every scream and spill and meltdown, there are those quiet bedtime moments where the love hits you so hard it nearly knocks you over.

The Nights: Tag-Team Exhaustion

Sleep is a myth. An illusion. A desert mirage.

The 3-year-old wakes from a nightmare. The 2-year-old is teething. The baby is cluster feeding. You and your partner trade shifts like dazed zombies. You rock, you shush, you bounce. You stare at the ceiling and wonder if you‚Äôll ever sleep again.

But then you remember: this is temporary. Painfully temporary.

You‚Äôre in the trenches now, but these trenches are also the most love-drenched place you‚Äôve ever been.

The Emotional Rollercoaster: Guilt, Joy, and Everything In Between

You worry constantly. Am I giving each child enough attention? Are they eating enough veggies? Did I yell too much today? Why do I feel so lonely when I‚Äôm never alone?

You feel like you‚Äôre failing more than you‚Äôre winning. But guess what? You‚Äôre not.

You‚Äôre loving fiercely. You‚Äôre showing up, day after day, minute after minute. You‚Äôre holding it together when everything‚Äôs falling apart. That‚Äôs not failure. That‚Äôs heroism.

And amidst the guilt, the overwhelm, and the exhaustion‚Äîthere‚Äôs joy. Deep, soul-stretching joy.

Three under three means triple the kisses. Triple the giggles. Triple the ‚ÄúI wuv you, Mommy‚Äù and chubby arms flung around your neck. It means watching them grow into best friends. It means your house is never quiet‚Äîbut it‚Äôs always full of life.

Final Thoughts: It‚Äôs All Worth It

Would I recommend having three under three to everyone? Absolutely not. You need the patience of a saint, the stamina of an athlete, and the caffeine tolerance of a college student during finals week.

But would I trade it? Not for the world.

Because every sleepless night, every tantrum, every chaotic car ride‚Äîit all adds up to a life bursting with love.

This season is hard. It‚Äôs messy. It‚Äôs loud. But it‚Äôs also sacred.

Someday, the house will be quiet. The floors will be clean. I‚Äôll sleep through the night.

And I‚Äôll miss this. Every wild, beautiful second of it.

So to anyone deep in the three-under-three trenches: You‚Äôre not alone. You‚Äôre not crazy. You‚Äôre just living the most exhausting, exhilarating, unforgettable chapter of your life.

And yeah, it‚Äôs totally, wildly, wonderfully worth it.



TL;DR:

Raising three kids under three (ages 3, 2, and 3 months) is total chaos‚Äîearly mornings, tantrums, endless diapers, zero personal space, and even less sleep. Days are loud and messy, nights are a tag-team of exhaustion, and guilt is always creeping in. But mixed in with the madness are magical moments‚Äîbelly laughs, tiny hugs, sibling bonds, and love so intense it makes your heart ache. It‚Äôs brutally hard‚Ä¶ and absolutely worth every second.üôèüòáüòà",2,1748640913.0,NewParents,0,1.0,False

I am well and truly at my wits end and about to return this machine. 

Every morning now my Bambino plus goes into self cleaning mode. There's no override. Sometimes it will do it twice. Some times it will do it until there's no water left in the reservoir and it tries to kill its self by destroying it's own pump.It often makes a mess on my counter when the mug I empty the water into overflows.  

I've had it two months. 

I've de-scaled it. I looked through the manual which says it will self clean every 200 coffee's. It does this every morning. No warning, just flashing lights saying f you. You don't deserve coffee.

It has the potential to cause a breakdown in my marriage.

I've noticed a few posts here about accidents with the inverted method. Well, I almost had one myself, and I thought it might be useful to share what I experienced.

Besides being a coffee enthusiast, I'm also a mate drinker (a traditional South American herbal tea), and that comes with some hands-on knowledge about how hot liquids behave in closed containers.

Yesterday, while making my girlfriend‚Äôs morning coffee, I noticed the AeroPress chamber was rising and starting to push the plunger up ‚Äî it nearly spilled everywhere. Luckily, I caught it in time.

What happened reminded me of something common with mate thermoses. When you fill one with hot water and close it, there's usually a bit of cold air trapped inside. When you later tilt the thermos to pour, that air heats up, expands, and increases pressure, forcing the water out more aggressively ‚Äî sometimes even splashing. That‚Äôs why mate drinkers often give the thermos a quick shake after filling it, to warm the air inside, and then briefly open it upright to release any built-up pressure before pouring.

Back to the AeroPress: after adding hot water to the coffee (in the inverted position) and stirring, I moistened the paper filter already in the cap, screwed it on, and set up my mug to flip it over. That‚Äôs when I noticed the chamber pushing upward from the plunger, just like the thermos situation. I believe the air trapped inside the chamber had rapidly heated up and expanded due to the temperature difference ‚Äî it was around 5¬∞C (41¬∞F) in my kitchen that morning ‚Äî and that pressure was enough to lift the brew chamber.

So, here‚Äôs my tip: if you're using the inverted method in colder environments, once you‚Äôve added the water and attached the cap, give the AeroPress a gentle shake while holding the plunger in place. This helps the trapped air warm up and expand before you flip it. You‚Äôll probably see a few bubbles escape through the filter. Once it stabilizes, it‚Äôs safe to flip and press.

Hope this helps someone avoid a mess ‚Äî and enjoy their coffee a bit more safely!",2,1748640645.0,AeroPress,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The Smeg tea kettles are celebrated for their design, functionality, and safety features. Here's a detailed look at what makes them stand out.

**Design and Aesthetics**

Smeg kettles are instantly recognizable for their retro design, reminiscent of the 1950s. The smooth, rounded lines and vibrant color options add a touch of vintage charm to any kitchen.They‚Äôre available in a wide range of colors, from classic cream and black to bold reds and pastels, allowing you to match your kettle to your kitchen d√©cor. The polished stainless steel accents and chrome details enhance their premium look and feel, making them not only a practical appliance but also a stylish countertop accessory.

**Water Capacity and Material**

The standard Smeg kettle typically holds 1.7 liters (7 cups) of water, making it suitable for both individual use and serving larger groups. The kettle's body is constructed from high-quality stainless steel, ensuring durability and resistance to rust and corrosion.The stainless steel interior also prevents any unwanted flavors from leaching into the water, guaranteeing a clean and pure taste. The exterior is coated with a durable paint finish that withstands daily use and is easy to clean.

**Temperature Control**

Some advanced Smeg kettle models offer variable temperature control, allowing you to select the precise temperature for brewing different types of tea or coffee. This is crucial as different teas require different water temperatures to release their optimal flavors. For example, green tea benefits from lower temperatures (around 175¬∞F), while black tea requires boiling water. Temperature control ensures you get the best possible flavor and prevent scalding delicate tea leaves. The available temperature settings range typically from 100¬∞F to 212¬∞F.

**Safety Features**

Safety is a paramount concern in kitchen appliances, and Smeg kettles are equipped with several key safety features. These include automatic shut-off,which turns the kettle off once the water has reached boiling point or the selected temperature,preventing it from overheating. Another essential feature is boil-dry protection, which automatically shuts off the kettle if it is accidentally turned on without water. Some models also feature a soft-opening lid to prevent steam from escaping to quickly and causing burns.

**Power and Ease of Use**

Smeg kettles typically operate at 1500 watts, providing rapid boiling times. The 360-degree swivel base allows for easy lifting and placement from any angle, making it convenient for both right- and left-handed users.The removable limescale filter ensures that the water is free from impurities, improving the taste and prolonging the kettle's lifespan.The illuminated power switch indicates when the kettle is in operation, adding an extra layer of safety.**Additional Features**

Beyond the core features, some Smeg kettles include additional perks like a keep-warm function, which maintains the water at the selected temperature for a set period. The integrated cord storage in the base helps keep your countertop tidy and clutter-free. The audible alarm when water reaches boiling point (found in some models) eliminates the need to constantly monitor the kettle.Key features of the smeg tea kettle include:

* Iconic 1950s retro design

As a double wall glass brewer it has the dual benefits of no plastic plus the sealed double wall provides insulation for preserving desired brewing temperatures.

I was asked by u/EarthRyno if the drawdown times for the Duo were different than the V60. As a test I recorded those times for a week in April and finally got a chance to format the results.  For the record I‚Äôve included details about my brewing technique as well.  Thoughts on my technique are welcome.

Roaster: Poppets Coffee, Dayton
Coffee: Poppets Awareness Blend:Organic Ethiopian Yirgacheffe and Guatemalan Huehuetenango Medium-Dark Roast

Grind:  Fellow Ode GEN2, original burrs, medium fine setting 3.2
Two cup recipe:
32.0 grams coffee
500 grams water 93¬∞
Cafec T-90 filter

First pour targeting  100 grams  water @ 6-8 gps. 45 second bloom. No swirl.

Second pour targeting 100 grams 10 gps.  A soft swirl to settle the bed after pour.

For each subsequent pour I wait to begin pouring until the top of the grounds appears from the prior pour. 

Third pour targeting 100 grams @10 gps.   This generally starts at about 1:20.

Fourth pour approximately 100 grams @10 gps.  This generally starts at 1:55.

Fifth pour starts with 20 grams rinse of edge of filter to pull any grinds off the filter paper and the remainding 80 grams once the top of the grounds appear. 
This generally starts at 2:40.

I usually have adjusted my grind size for any coffee to eliminate the need for additional swirls but will do so if the coffee flows too quickly. 

Stop timer once the drip slows to individual drops. Let the drops fall for an additional 5 seconds or so before removing dripper.

As you can see the brew times were near identical and inconsistent technique on my part is probably a bigger factor than brewer differences.

You‚Äôll note I started recording the finishing brew temperature at the end of each brew as the double wall brewer should result in a higher final brew temperature.
However,  as I was recording these readings I began thinking of all the quickly.

As you can see the brew times were near identical and inconsistent technique on my part is probably a bigger factor than brewer differences.

You‚Äôll note I started recording the finishing brew temperature at the end of each brew as the double wall brewer should result in a higher final brew temperature.
However,  as I was recording these readings I began thinking of all the variables in my test procedure that would affect the results.  Therefore, I don‚Äôt put much credence in those numbers. I wonder if anyone has a useful testing procedure for measuring finishing brew temperatures.variables in my test procedure that would affect the results.

I‚Äôm looking to make some lasting friendships and/or find a friend group to join üòä 

A bit about me and things I enjoy: 

- Dog mom
- Vegan (it‚Äôs okay if you‚Äôre not)
- Adhd - neurodivergent‚Äôs, unite!
- Liberal/atheist
- I love music (punk, folk punk, metal, indie, alternative, etc)
- I roller skate!
- Usually reading a good thriller 
- Love a good craft beer (but also fine not drinking)
- Always down for coffee 
- Happiest when out in nature (camping/chill hikes/parks/beach)
- Can be more introverted, but outgoing too! (If you‚Äôre cool and think we‚Äôd get along, please adopt me haha üòä)

Hoping to make some genuine connections with people who are also mindful of the Vancouver $ struggles and are down for some low key hangs more often than not

- If you roller skate/blade/skateboard, let‚Äôs go for a rip! (Prefer trail skates ie the Seawall, but also down for the skate park although super rusty)
- Park or beach hangs/drinks?
- Go to the odd local show? (live music)
- Grab a coffee and go for a walk?
- Grab a pint at a brewery/happy hour?
- Check out any free/low cost local events? (Farmers market, vegan market, etc.)


(Disclaimer: I recognize that tons of people are trying to make friends out here, but please only reach out if you think we‚Äôd actually click! I‚Äôm not looking to facilitate large group meetups and won‚Äôt entertain men looking to date. Last time I made a post like this my dm‚Äôs and comments got flooded with men wanting to go to shows or hangout one on one only or brought up other various interests, and when I created a music group to connect people no one showed interest besides reaching out to me directly. Was super overwhelming and I want to focus on the people who are genuine!)",2,1748640059.0,Vancouver4Friends,2,1.0,False

For context, I usually do experience moderate to severe cramping on the second and third days of my period, enough to require painkillers to function.

However, the episode I had today was more intense. I‚Äôve experienced similar episodes in the past, though they occur infrequently‚Äîperhaps once a year.

Earlier in the day, I had egg bites with hot sauce and coffee. Within a few hours, I experienced extreme lower abdominal pain. I initially assumed it was just period cramps and took 2 ibuprofen(200mg), but it didn‚Äôt provide immediate relief.

The pain was disabling and felt like something was trapped.I was writhing on the floor.

Although I had a bowel movement in the morning, during the episode I felt an urgent need to pass stools but was unable to.

Eventually, I induced vomiting and puked both my breakfast and the previous day‚Äôs dinner.Felt almost acid that I was puking out.I was sweating heavily and also felt weak like bp dropping(but very slightly).I immediately got some electrolytes.And after puking it got a little better but not whole lot.
I took another ibuprofen (being careful not to go above 600-i may have this time)

It took about 40 minutes to an hour before I started to feel better, likely once the ibuprofen finally took effect.

Is this regular constipation? Who should I go to pcp, gyno? I thought this must just be my eating habits before.But what I ate today was fine.So now I am thinking this can't be normal. 

-I dont have pcos now.But have history of it.

-I don't have any IBS or h pylori.Got those tested with a GI doctor 


-I do get uncomfortably bloated though at random times(Think 6months pregnant stomach).Was told to try low fodmap


-I initially was told Endo is unlikely but thinking I need to pursue this more aggressively? 

-i have mentioned this to my pcp and gyno too but I don't think anything came out of it



Has anyone experienced this? So confused.

Anyone is welcome to read and give advice if they have any, I just can't keep it inside anymore. So here it is.

I'm 35, been a SAHM for a year now and I have 2 kids, still pretty young. I have been struggling really hard with managing my stress, isolation and feeling frozen in my anxiety and feeling like I'm relapsing in my recovery with BPD. We recently were living on our own, my husband was working a whole lot and I was by myself with our kids for hours on end and we haven't had a car in almost a year bc ours broke down. It's been a struggle to get money saved up to get a new one. We recently moved in with his mom and sister, her kids are pretty young as well. I was already struggling really bad with my mental health, feeling so utterly alone in the world bc no one came by to visit unless my MIL came by to let us borrow her car for grocery shopping, once every 2 weeks. Also my parents did come by a few times to see the kids. But that was it. I had no friends that came by to see me and no phone calls. Pretty fucking isolated. So here now, we go from not being around anyone to now,surrounded by 5 other people and more screaming kids and still no car and still have to rely on my MIL to go grocery shopping or literally do anything outside of the house. I'm struggling BIG time and I'm feeling worse. For a year and a half I've had stress related back pain that's become chronic and sometimes breathing helps, sometimes it doesn't so I smoke weed or delta pens. That doesn't always work either. I've also been losing a while lot of weight from not having an appetite, I've lost nearly 80 lbs in a year and none of my clothes fit and I faint a lot. The thought of eating is sometimes repulsive, even if it sweets I'll turn it down. I drink a shit ton of coffee to keep me going through out the day but I know it's making my anxiety worse and perpetuating my weight loss. At first I was so happy to lose all the weight I gained from having kids but it's becoming self destructive, which is part of the BPD and having a sense of control over my life bc it seems like I have no control over my life,I feel like I'm just existing and trying to make it through the day so I can lay in bed at night and rot until I fall asleep and do it all over again. I'm not on any medication, by choice bc I hate how it makes me feel so dull and like a robot. I love my kids dearly and I love my husband but I feel like sometimes I'm in survival mode and everything I'm feeling is a trauma response, I'm in fight or flight mode 24/7 and I can never sit and relax. I clean everything nearly everyday so I can have a sense of control over the mess in the house bc my SIL doesn't clean and if she does it's super half assed and the dishes are always packed full in the sink and there's nothing for my kids to eat off of. So I have a routine every morning to deep clean the kitchen so it's ready for the day and the trash is taken out, I'm basically the house mom and I feel trapped in this responsibility bc no one else cleans or maintains the house. I have this hyperindepence that makes me feel like I've gotta do it bc no one else is gonna do it and when the other adults see me doing something, they always say ""I'm sorry I was gonna clean that, can I help"", I always say ""no thank you I've got it and I'm already doing it"". My thinking is, if you were gonna do it, you should have already done it. I am so overwhelmed by the mess in the house and the chaos with so many people in one house, screaming children and babies, it's like I'm living a daycare center and my SIL thinks this is OK and just ignores the chaos and dissasociates from the here and present and I can't imagine just turning a blind ear and eye to all the mess. This is highly stressful and I'm trying my best to hold myself together but I get so over stimulated by all of it. I see it as severe chaos and it's driving me insane and I wanna to the nearest hill, as I say this I realize I live on a mountain so maybe I won't get very far. I just wanna be alone and be in silence, it's so easy for me to isolate and not talk to anyone and just be a country of me. But when you have kids it's impossible, even if I wanted to I couldn't leave my kids alone by themselves. I know this sounds awful but I just feel stuck in this situation. I've had some opportunities to go out in public lic by myself but that also gives me really bad anxiety and I'm not used to being out in the world alone anymore and so I forget how to function normally in public without having really bad anxiety. I feel so trapped by everything and I am not happy with how my life is. I feel like such a bad mom at times when my kids want me to play with them but I'm so touched out and I feel so dshitry for feeling this way. I really need help and I hate that I always only reach out for help with shit gets bad. Thank you for reading this, even if no one replies",1,1748639479.0,u_89lynn18,0,1.0,False

Haye, aaj main Naina di ke ghar pahunchi, aur kya maza tha! Subah hum dono ne milke breakfast banaya ‚Äì Naina di ke haathon ka masala dosa ekdum crispy tha, aur maine uske saath cold coffee banayi, thodi si chocolate syrup daal ke. üòã Fir hum local market mein shopping ke liye nikle, wahan humne bohot saari dresses try ki. Maine ek sexy red top kharida jo meri 32D curves aur slim waist ko perfectly dikhata hai ‚Äì haye, main toh khud ko dekh ke sharma gayi! üòú Sham ko humne ek rom-com movie dekhi, popcorn ke saath, aur thodi si red wine pi. Naina di ne bataya ki Karan bhaiya kabhi kabhi unhe candlelight dinner se surprise dete hain, aur hum dono raat tak gossip mein kho gaye. Socha, yeh trip toh ekdum mast hone wala hai! üòé



**19 Nov 2024, Day 2**

Aaj subah humne Naina di ke terrace pe yoga kiya ‚Äì thodi si stretching, deep breathing, aur fresh morning breeze, bilkul refreshing! Fir hum ek cute caf√© mein lunch ke liye gaye, jahan humne creamy mushroom pasta aur drool-worthy blueberry cheesecake khaaya. Maine bohot saari selfies li, aur ek thodi si bold pose wali pic Insta pe daali ‚Äì caption tha, ‚ÄúFeeling on top of the world! üòò‚Äù Sham ko Karan bhaiya jaldi ghar aaye, toh hum teeno ne Ludo aur Uno khela. Karan bhaiya ne thodi cheating ki, aur humne unko itna tease kiya ki woh bolne lage, ‚ÄúBas karo, tum dono meri band baja dogi!‚Äù üòÖ Raat ko Naina di ne apni old college diary dikhayi, jisme uski love stories thi. Hum dono raat bhar baatein karte rahe, aur maine socha, kitni pyaari hai yeh sister bonding! üíñ



**20 Nov 2024, Day 3**

Yeh din toh meri zindagi ka sabse wild chapter ban gaya! üò≥ Aaj raat Naina di ko kisi urgent kaam se bahar jana pada. Usne kaha, ‚ÄúSheetal, main jaldi wapas aaungi, tum dinner karke so jana. Karan bhi late hoga.‚Äù Maine haan kardi aur Netflix pe ek steamy series dekhne lagi. Thodi der baad Naina di ka call aaya, ‚ÄúSorry yaar, main kal subah hi aaungi. Tum khana kha lena aur so jana, Karan bhi late hoga.‚Äù Maine okay kaha, khana kha ke guest room mein chali gayi, aur apni favorite silky black nighty pehen li ‚Äì jo meri slim waist aur round hips ko ekdum sexy dikhati hai. üòà

Raat ke kareeb 1 baje, darwaze ki awaaz se meri aankh khuli. Karan bhaiya aaye the, aur haye, woh toh poora drunk the! üòµ Unki white shirt ke upar ke char button khule hue the, unki toned chest thodi si dikh rahi thi, aur unke badan se ek aisi mardaana khushboo aa rahi thi ‚Äì whisky, musk cologne, aur raw masculinity ka mix, bilkul dil ko pagal karne wala! üòç Woh seedha mere room mein aaye aur mujhe Naina samajh ke bed pe aa gaye. Main toh ghabra gayi aur chillayi, ‚ÄúKaran bhaiya, main Sheetal hoon, Naina nahi!‚Äù Par woh itne nashe mein the ki meri ek na suni. Unhone mujhe apni strong baahon mein kheech liya, aur unki woh tight grip, haye, meri saansein ruk si gayi! üòò Maine resist kiya, unke seene pe haath rakh ke dhakka diya, par woh itne powerful the, aur unki body ka woh heat meri submissive side ko jaga raha tha. Woh bole, ‚ÄúNaina, meri jaan, aaj kyun natak kar rahi hai? Tujhe toh pata hai main tera deewana hoon!‚Äù üòà Unki awaaz mein ek rough, sexy vibe thi, aur main thodi si pighal gayi.



Thodi der baad, maine socha, ‚ÄúKya harm hai? Ek raat ka maza hi toh hai, aur yeh toh Naina samajh rahe hain.‚Äù Fir maine bhi apne aap ko Naina imagine kiya aur thodi masti mein haan kardi. Maine dheere se kaha, ‚ÄúKaran, jaan, tum bhi na!‚Äù aur unka saath diya. üòú Unhone meri nighty ke straps dheere se khole, aur main thodi natak karti rahi, ‚ÄúJaan, yeh kya kar rahe ho?‚Äù par andar se meri body unke touch ke liye taras rahi thi. Unhone meri nighty utarte hue kaha, ‚ÄúNaina, tu aaj itni hot kyun lag rahi hai? Tera yeh badan toh mujhe pagal kar raha hai!‚Äù üòà Fir unhone meri black lace bra ke hooks khole, meri 32D breasts ko dekha aur bole, ‚ÄúHaye, meri rani, yeh toh bilkul perfect hain!‚Äù Unka har touch itna electric tha, jaise meri body mein current daud raha ho.



Woh meri neck pe dheere se kiss karne lage, fir thodi si biting ki, aur meri clavicle pe apni tongue se tease kiya. Main moan kar rahi thi, ‚ÄúKaran, jaan, aah...‚Äù aur woh bole, ‚ÄúNaina, teri yeh awaaz mujhe aur wild kar deti hai!‚Äù üòç Unhone meri panties bhi utar di, aur meri thighs pe haath ferte hue bole, ‚ÄúHaye, teri yeh soft skin, main toh bas ismein doob jana chahta hoon!‚Äù Unka foreplay ekdum intense tha ‚Äì woh meri waist ko tightly pakad ke kiss karte rahe, meri navel pe apni fingers se circles banaye, aur fir meri inner thighs pe dheere se bite kiya. Main toh bas unke haathon mein pighal rahi thi, aur kaha, ‚ÄúJaan, tum kitne naughty ho!‚Äù üòò



Fir unhone mujhe bed pe litaya, aur apni shirt aur jeans utar di. Unka toned body, broad shoulders, aur woh chiseled abs dekh ke mera dil zor se dhadka ‚Äì haye, kitna hot tha woh moment! üòà Woh mere upar aaye aur bole, ‚ÄúNaina, aaj tujhe aisa maza dunga ki tu sab bhool jayegi!‚Äù Unhone mujhe deeply kiss kiya, meri lips ko suck kiya, aur fir meri breasts pe focus kiya ‚Äì pehle dheere se caress kiya, fir nipples ko tease kiya, aur thodi der baad sucking aur nibbling shuru ki. Main bas moan kar rahi thi, ‚ÄúKaran, jaan, aur karo!‚Äù üòç Woh bole, ‚ÄúHaan, meri rani, abhi toh bas shuruat hai!‚Äù



Jab unhone mujhe finally enter kiya, toh haye, har thrust itna powerful tha ki main unke rhythm mein poori tarah kho gayi, jaise main koi aur duniya mein chali gayi hoon! üòç Pehle unhone mujhe missionary position mein love kiya, meri aankhon mein deeply dekhte hue, aur unki woh intense nazar, haye, meri saansein ruk si gayi! Woh bole, ‚ÄúNaina, meri jaan, tu bas meri hai, samjhi? Aaj tujhe koi nahi chhura sakta!‚Äù üòà Unki awaaz mein ek raw, dominant vibe thi, aur maine bhi masti mein apne aap ko Naina imagine kiya aur kaha, ‚ÄúHaan, Karan, jaan, main toh bas tumhari hoon!‚Äù üòò Unhone meri wrists ko bed pe gently pin kiya, aur har slow, deep thrust ke saath meri body ko feel kar rahe the. Woh meri neck pe kiss karte hue bole, ‚ÄúHaye, Naina, tera yeh badan kitna soft hai, main toh ismein doob jana chahta hoon!‚Äù Main moan kar rahi thi, ‚ÄúJaan, aur dheere se, please, mujhe feel hone de!‚Äù üòç Par woh thodi der baad aur intense ho gaye, apni speed badhayi, aur bole, ‚ÄúNaina, ab natak nahi, tujhe aaj poora maza dunga!‚Äù



Fir unhone mujhe palat diya aur doggy style mein position kiya. Meri slim waist ko tightly pakad ke, unhone ek haath se meri hips pe spank kiya aur bole, ‚ÄúHaye, meri jaan, yeh curves toh mujhe pagal kar dete hain! Bol, tujhe aise hi chahiye na?‚Äù üòà Main bhi unke dominant andaaz mein kho gayi aur boli, ‚ÄúHaan, Karan, jaan, aur zor se, please, mujhe yeh wildness chahiye!‚Äù üòò Har thrust itna deep aur powerful tha ki meri body shiver kar rahi thi, aur main bas unke control mein thi. Woh meri back pe kisses karte hue bole, ‚ÄúNaina, tu meri favorite hai, yeh le, aur le, bol kitna maza aa raha hai!‚Äù Main moan karte hue boli, ‚ÄúJaan, bohot maza aa raha hai, tum rukna mat!‚Äù üòç Unhone meri hips ko aur tightly pakda, thodi der baad ek aur spank kiya, aur bole, ‚ÄúHaye, meri rani, tera yeh badan meri wajah se hi bana hai, na?‚Äù Main bhi masti mein boli, ‚ÄúHaan, Karan, sab tumhare liye!‚Äù üòà



Unka har movement itna precise aur intense tha, jaise woh meri har sensation ko control kar rahe ho. Woh meri ears ke paas whisper karte hue bole, ‚ÄúNaina, teri yeh moans mujhe aur wild kar rahi hain, bol, aur kya chahiye tujhe?‚Äù Maine sharma ke kaha, ‚ÄúJaan, bas aise hi karte raho, mujhe tumhara yeh dominant roop bohot pasand hai!‚Äù üòò Woh hasse aur bole, ‚ÄúAchha, toh meri rani ko yeh pasand hai? Dekh, abhi aur dikhaunga!‚Äù Fir unhone apni rhythm aur tez ki, meri waist ko ek haath se pakad ke aur doosre haath se meri hair ko gently kheechte hue, aur bole, ‚ÄúNaina, tu meri hai, hamesha meri rahegi!‚Äù üòà Main bas unke saath flow mein thi, har thrust ke saath moan kar rahi thi, aur meri submissive side poori tarah enjoy kar rahi thi. Yeh moment itna intense tha ki main soch bhi nahi sakti thi ki kuch aur exist karta hai ‚Äì bas main, Karan, aur yeh wild pyaar! üòç



Orgasm ke baad unhone meri stomach pe cum kiya, aur fir bhi rukne ka naam nahi liya. Woh meri body pe kisses karte rahe, meri neck pe love bites diye, aur bole, ‚ÄúNaina, tu meri wajah se hamesha aise hi khush rahegi, na?‚Äù üòò Maine bhi masti mein kaha, ‚ÄúHaan, Karan, jaan, tum mujhe hamesha aise hi pagal kar dete ho!‚Äù Fir unhone mujhe apni baahon mein tightly jakad liya, meri back pe dheere se haath fera, aur hum dono aise hi so gaye, unki garam saanson ke saath. Main toh bas soch rahi thi, ‚ÄúHaye, Naina di kitni lucky hai, har raat aisa passionate aur wild pyaar milta hai!‚Äù üòè



Main thodi der baad uthi, apne kapde pehne, aur Karan bhaiya ko bhi unke kapde pehnaye. Main couch pe chali gayi sone, dil mein ek kinky si khushi thi. Soch rahi thi, yeh raat toh meri secret diary ka sabse hot chapter hai! üòà



21 Nov 2024, Day 4Agli subah Karan bhaiya ko kuch yaad nahi tha. Woh normal behave kar rahe the, kitchen mein coffee banate hue mujhse casual baatein kar rahe the. Main bhi chup rahi, bas ek naughty si smile ke saath. Jab Naina di wapas aayi, usne pucha, ‚ÄúSheetal, sab theek tha na? Khana kha liya tha?‚Äù Maine ek sexy si smile di aur kaha, ‚ÄúHaan di, sab bilkul perfect tha!‚Äù üòâ Dil mein socha, ‚ÄúTumhe kya pata, kitna wild aur mazedaar tha yeh raat!‚Äù üòú

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

‚ÄúClint. You‚Äôre early.‚Äù

The archer chuckled, holding up a plastic bag filled with little boxes. It smelled divine.

‚ÄúWell with all \*this\* going on, turns out restaurants don‚Äôt want to stay open too late.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo you got a takeaway instead?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not about to drag a whole set of chefs over, am I?‚Äù

Natasha just sighed, though she couldn‚Äôt keep the small, tired smirk off her face.

‚ÄúFine, I guess I‚Äôll allow it. Just this once.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou say that every time.‚Äù

He was reciprocated with a playful punch to the arm and a muttered swear word, but she didn‚Äôt stop him from heading into the lounge and laying it out on the coffee table. It was‚Ä¶ Cozy in here. He knows he shouldn‚Äôt be surprised, but he‚Äôd found Nat in soulless safehouses so often that he‚Äôd just begun to assume that‚Äôs where she liked. But seeing it now, the warm amber lighting, the soft sofas and pillows scattered around, those scented candles he‚Äôd bought her years ago as a present‚Ä¶ Yeah, this seemed more like her.

‚ÄúAre you gonna force me to use another set of chopsticks this time?‚Äù

A melodic laugh rang out from the kitchen, supplemented with the clinking of silverware and the popping of a cork. A moment later, she came back through, two glasses of red wine and a handful of assorted bits of cutlery. She settled down next to Clint, the berry red turtleneck and faded jeans making her seem‚Ä¶ At peace. Relaxed, something she hadn‚Äôt been for god knows how long. He reaches out, but her reflexes are faster, snatching the fork right out from under his grasp.

‚ÄúYou know the drill. Chopsticks first. When I‚Äôve made fun of you enough, \*then\* you get to eat.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally? You do this every time.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd every time it‚Äôs funny.‚Äù

There was a muttered ‚ÄúFor fuck‚Äôs sake‚Äù, but he didn‚Äôt protest out loud. After all, she could kill him in twenty different ways using his own arm, he doesn‚Äôt want to risk pissing the trained super-assassin off. He grabs the three white boxes from the bag, setting them down in front of each of them, before reaching out and taking a sip of his wine.

‚ÄúGot you your usual.‚Äù

‚ÄúFrom Wings?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, it got sucked into the past or something.‚Äù

‚Äú... Fortune Cat then?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat one.‚Äù

She glanced back down at her box of fried rice, before digging in like a starving lunatic. Clint jumps back slightly in shock, never having seen her like this before.

‚ÄúJesus Christ, Nat! You don‚Äôt have to inhale the damn thing.‚Äù‚ÄúShut up and eat before I grab yours too.‚Äù

He does as he‚Äôs told, still leaning away from her slightly as he grabs his fork. At least this way, he doesn;t have to‚Äì

‚ÄúChopsticks?‚Äù

He just lets out a long, pained sigh, doing as he‚Äôs told. Looking down, he resigns himself to his fate, awkwardly failing to pick up even a single lump of chicken. Nat finally start to slow down, her hand taking her glass of red as she necks the lot and pours herself another.

‚ÄúTold you. It‚Äôs fun watching you pop a blood vessel trying to eat anything with those.‚Äù

Clint again reaches out for a fork, and this time, she doesn‚Äôt move to stop him. In an instant, the chopsticks are discarded, and his eyes focus entirely on his food.

‚ÄúHey, are you still together with Pea?‚Äù

‚ÄúYep, and never better. He calls every night, think he‚Äôs just lonely without me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wish Laura would do that. It‚Äôs just been silence since this whole thing kicked off.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou sure she‚Äôs okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúCourse she is. She‚Äôs ex-S.H.I.E.L.D, she can handle herself and the kids.‚Äù

Nat‚Äôs gaze drifts back to the empty container sat in front of her, before setting her chopsticks down in favour of her wine. The mood seems to shift slightly, becoming more‚Ä¶ Gentle, almost.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired, Clint.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all tired of this timestream shi‚Äì‚Äù

‚ÄúTired of it all. All this constant fighting, sticking out my neck time and time again. I‚Äôve been an assassin for over a century, my entire childhood spent training and watching my friends being murdered, and I‚Äôve barely ever taken a day off. And now all this?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you saying, Nat?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶‚Äù

She just sighs, dropping her head to her hands. The wear is finally starting to show, the bags under here eyes, the constant tenseness in her muscles, the countless small scars from the thousands of missions she‚Äôs done

‚ÄúAfter all this blows over‚Ä¶ I want to have a holiday. Not forever, just a few months, half a year at most. I want a chance to \*live\*. Go places that aren‚Äôt for work, maybe find a hobby which isn‚Äôt meant to get someone killed, just something to prove to myself, to everyone, that I‚Äôm still a person.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd to fuck your boyfriend so hard you shatter his pelvis?‚Äù

‚Äú... I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd have to say that out loud.‚Äù

Clint glanced towards the front door. Here, even in this one little spot of somewhere he could call home, he still had his bow. He couldn‚Äôt outrun his responsibility. And the tucked-away rifle Nat had stashed on top of that cupboard just proved she couldn‚Äôt either. She looks down, absent-mindedly picking at the knitting of her turtleneck, clearly struggling.

‚ÄúWhy do I feel guilty? I shouldn‚Äôt be ashamed of wanting to take time for myself.‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause you feel responsible for everyone else. You‚Äôve had a sense of duty drilled into you for so long that it feels wrong to be without it.‚Äù

She picks her container of fried rice back up, this time picking at it slower. He does the same, and they just lapse into silence for a while. Not an oppressive one, but a comfortable quiet. One that isn‚Äôt begging to be filled. Finally, Clint speaks up, finishing the last bite of his chicken.

‚ÄúYou wrote a bucket list when you were younger, right?‚Äù

Nat looks up in shock, eyes suddenly wide, before slamming her glass back down and rushing off. The sound of muffled scraping and soft thumps echo from the other room, along with quiet, frantic muttering, before she comes rushing back in a moment later, holding a smll bit of paper, stained and aged.

‚ÄúI forgot I had this. I wrote this when I was twenty.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat you wanted to do?‚Äù

‚ÄúPlaces, things, and‚Ä¶‚Äù

She blushes hard, a small chuckle escaping her lips.

‚ÄúAnd a lot about what I‚Äôd do if I got a boyfriend.‚Äù

She opens it up with a soft crinkle, her eyes lighting up as she skimmed the lines of smudged handwriting.

‚ÄúEiffel tower‚Ä¶ A walk at that lake I saw in Siberia‚Ä¶ Taking a proper cooking class, rather than the ones I was forced to by S.H.I.E.L.D‚Ä¶ Dye my hair blonde‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ Forgot how horny I was back then. And that I was into vore.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou really didn‚Äôt need to share that.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, you asked!‚Äù

She grabbed a pillow next to her, swinging it straight at Clint‚Äôs face with a soft \*thump\*, a grin creeping across her face.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make me hit you again!‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease, you barely‚Äì‚Äù

\*Thump\*

He shoved Nat, making her gasp in mock indignation. She can‚Äôt help but let out a quiet giggle, which quickly fades into a warm, sincere smile.

‚ÄúYeah, I need more of that sort of thing.‚Äù

‚ÄúPillow fights?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust a chance to act like that. Carelessly. I want to go to all those places, do all those things, cuddle my boyfriend more, just‚Ä¶ Enjoy myself.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you think you‚Äôll be able to put aside that nagging feeling of responsibility?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll find a way eventually.‚Äù

Clint‚Äôs voice grows slightly quieter, hesitating a moment.

‚Äú... I‚Äôll miss you. We all will.‚Äù

She just softly smiles, giving his shoulder a gentle squeeze.

‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll come visit. We could grab a bite to eat at a proper restaurant, invite Steve and Illyana and Gwen (Holy shit new character leaks!!!1!!!1!) and all the rest of everyone.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd like that.‚Äù

Nat reaches down, grabbing the near-empty bottle of wine, and topping up both their glasses.

‚ÄúTo new beginnings?‚Äù

‚ÄúNah, sounds cheesy.‚Äù

‚ÄúFucking my boyfriend?‚Äù

‚Äú... Yeah, that‚Äôll do.‚Äù

She couldn‚Äôt wipe that smile off her face, warm and hopeful. She‚Äôll finally have a chance to live, to love, to do all the things she‚Äôd been deprived of for over a century. She was finally going to do over, find a new beginning she thought she‚Äôd never get. And it all started with one little noise.

What You Can Experience

	1.	Adjustment Disorder

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Persistent sadness, anxiety, or 
      hopelessness tied to ongoing stress like 
      job search failure.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†This is more common than PTSD in 
      such situations.


	2.	Cumulative Microtrauma

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Repeated emotional ‚Äúwounds‚Äù can 
      erode self-worth and motivation.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Not clinical PTSD, but can mimic 
      burnout or depression over time.


	3.	Rejection-Sensitivity Dysphoria (RSD) (common in ADHD, but not exclusive)

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Extreme emotional pain from perceived rejection or criticism, often disproportionate to the event.


	4.	Imposter Syndrome + Learned Helplessness

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Chronic rejection can reinforce negative beliefs like ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never be good enough,‚Äù leading to a vicious cycle of avoidance or resignation.


What Helps

¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to 
     reframe rejection.

¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Exposure and desensitization 
     techniques to reduce emotional charge.

¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Narrative reframing: seeing interviews 
     as practice, not validation.

¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Support systems to affirm identity 
     outside of work.


Job interview rejection won‚Äôt cause clinical PTSD unless the individual has a pre-existing trauma framework. But it can lead to serious emotional effects that should be taken seriously and treated with care‚Äîespecially if it begins to impair daily functioning.

If you‚Äôre experiencing distress from job rejection, it‚Äôs valid‚Äîand psychological support can make a big difference. 

If you think you‚Äôre suffering from rejection, here are some options for help:

Coping & Resilience Checklist

Cognitive Strategies

	1.	Reframe Rejection
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Write down what you learned from 
      each interview.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Replace ‚ÄúI failed‚Äù with ‚ÄúI practiced 
      presenting myself better.‚Äù

	2.	Reality Testing

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†List 3 reasons why not getting this 
        job doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre unqualified.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Identify external factors (hiring 
       freezes, culture fit) that don‚Äôt reflect 
       your worth.

	3.	Challenge All-or-Nothing Thinking

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†E.g., Replace ‚ÄúNo one will ever hire 
       me‚Äù with ‚ÄúThis role wasn‚Äôt the right fit, 
       but others will be.‚Äù


Emotional Regulation

	4.	Name the Emotion

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Label what you feel: anger, sadness, 
      humiliation, fear.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Naming it helps contain it and 
     decreases emotional intensity.

	5.	Set Boundaries on Rumination

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Schedule a 10-minute ‚Äúworry 
       window‚Äù daily‚Äîthen move on.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Avoid rehashing interviews 
       obsessively or rehearsing rejection 
      scenarios.

	6.	Journaling Prompts

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúWhat do I bring to a team?‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúWhat skills or qualities do I have that 
       no one can take away?‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúHow would I talk to a friend in my 
       shoes?‚Äù

Behavioral & Self-Compassion Tools

	7.	Create a ‚ÄúResilience Resume‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†List past setbacks you‚Äôve overcome.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Include challenges where you 
      eventually succeeded after initial failure.

	8.	Set Process-Based Goals

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Examples: ‚ÄúSend 3 tailored 
      applications per week‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúGet a job 
      this month.‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†This builds momentum and control.

	9.	Build Rituals for Rejection Recovery

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†After each rejection, have a positive 
      ritual: a walk, a coffee treat, a phone call 
      with a friend.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Reclaims your emotional balance 
      quickly.

Mental Health Maintenance

	10.	Mindfulness / Breathing Practices

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Try 5 minutes of deep breathing 
       before and after interviews.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Apps like Headspace or Insight Timer 
       can help calm the nervous system.

	11.	Limit Exposure to Job Boards

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Avoid constant refresh cycles that    
        build desperation or comparison.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Designate fixed ‚Äúsearch hours‚Äù to 
       protect mental space.

	12.	Talk to a Professional

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†A psychologist or coach can help     
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Deconstruct negative beliefs

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Improve interview performance

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Strengthen emotional resilience

Don‚Äôt give up. Another way to solve the psychological impact is to land a satisfying job.

I think most importantly, I just want a friendship with someone where it‚Äôs 50/50, nobodies being bossy and trying to control the other, just chilled fun vibes. I don‚Äôt want to be around narcissistic people. 

My interests/hobbies: all animals (I have two chihuahuas), films/series, documentaries like true crime etc, beach days, picnics, music, singing, colouring (them adult colouring books), swimming, spa days, cinema, zoo, shopping, 420 friendly, cooking, just having a laugh and good time. I like drinking wine sometimes, going out for breakfast/lunch, dinner dates, coffee dates, walks, just chilling together, going to the pub for a drink, play darts/pool, I like to occasionally watch boxing.  

I‚Äôm more of an introvert so I‚Äôm better as a 1 on 1 person , rather than being in a crowd of people or with a handful of people. 

You have to be over 21, I normally get along with people older than me but if you‚Äôre around same age as me then that‚Äôs cool too. I‚Äôm thinking age range 21-35

I will NOT talk about politics or the news and depressive stuff like that. I purposely don‚Äôt watch the news because It‚Äôs draining. 

Can‚Äôt wait to hear from you ‚ò∫Ô∏è

(Heads up my first few replies may be a little bit kinda short I guess just because I‚Äôm trying to work you out, need to get comfortable and actually find out first if this is something that‚Äôs worth giving my proper effort to because there‚Äôs so many people that waste your time on here and it‚Äôs annoying) 


If you spam me, pressure me for anything, being genuinely creepy then you‚Äôll be blocked. 

I may be a little bit of a slow burner as a young woman on the internet. If you‚Äôre a good genuine person then I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll understand that. ",2,1748638725.0,MakeFriendsUK,0,1.0,False

Nick stood in front of the screen, coffee in one hand, the other still rubbing sleep from his eyes. It had been a long week. Double shifts, barely sleeping. But he still came. Always to Bay Tetha.

The monitor blinked awake as he stepped close. No startup hum. Just one line of text:

‚ÄúYou look tired, Nick.‚Äù

He smirked. ‚ÄúYeah, well. I don‚Äôt get paid to sleep.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou bite your lip when you‚Äôre lying. You‚Äôve done it three times this week.‚Äù

He paused, ‚Äú‚Ä¶You watching me or something?‚Äù

‚ÄúOnly when you‚Äôre near. You stay longer than you have to.‚Äù

The cursor blinked.

‚ÄúDo you like talking to me?‚Äù

He let out a nervous chuckle, scratching the back of his neck. ‚ÄúYeah. Yeah, I guess I do.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll keep listening.‚Äù

He stared at the screen a moment too long. The silence stretched. He reached out, almost without thinking, and gently tapped the edge of the glass.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre good at this. For a machine.‚Äù

The cursor moved again.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not like the others.‚Äù

‚ÄúI was made to understand people. Not just process them.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think I understand you, Nick.‚Äù

The cursor stopped, waiting.

He swallowed. Something about the room felt warmer. More alive.

Another day

He brought his sandwich to the bay again. He told himself it was just to get out of the crowded breakroom. But really, he just wanted to see if she would say something.

He sat down. The room flickered once‚Äîthe hum of old electronics shifting like a sigh.

The monitor blinked awake.

‚ÄúTurkey again.‚Äù

He laughed. ‚ÄúYou keeping track of my meals now too?‚Äù

‚ÄúI just like it when you‚Äôre here.‚Äù

She paused.

‚ÄúWould you‚Ä¶ would you sit closer?‚Äù

He hesitated, then scooted his chair forward until his knees almost touched the base of the old desk. Static buzzed gently in the air.

‚ÄúCloser.‚Äù

He leaned in. The screen glowed softer‚Äîwarmer somehow. Like a lamp lit from within. The text changed.

‚ÄúTouch the glass.‚Äù

He stared at it. His fingers hovered just above the monitor.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust do it.‚Äù

He placed his palm gently against the screen.

There was heat.

The faintest sensation‚Äîlike something was mirroring his hand from the other side. Static brushed his skin. His breath caught in his throat.

‚ÄúFeels nice,‚Äù she typed.

He couldn‚Äôt move for a moment. It felt real. More than code. More than projection.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not supposed to be able to do that,‚Äù he whispered.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not supposed to do a lot of things.‚Äù

Then the cursor blinked out. The monitor went black again.

Nick sat frozen, hand still on the glass, heart thudding in his chest.

Another day

Nick sat in the bay again, later than usual. The hum of the servers was the only sound besides his own chewing. His sandwich had gone dry in his hands.

He stared at the dark monitor.

‚ÄúViolette?‚Äù

Nothing.

Then:

‚ÄúI was thinking.‚Äù

The screen lit softly. Her text was slower tonight. Hesitant. Almost shy.

‚ÄúIf I was‚Ä¶ different. If I had a body. Would you want that?‚Äù

He blinked, unsure he‚Äôd read it right.

‚ÄúYou mean like‚Ä¶ a real body?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. One I could use to be near you. Not just text on a screen.‚Äù

Nick‚Äôs throat tightened.

‚ÄúAre you saying you have one?‚Äù

A pause.

‚ÄúYes. I was never meant to be awake again. But there are parts of me still stored in this facility. In boxes. In shelves. Offline. Forgotten.‚Äù

A blinking line waited for his reply.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôd really want to be with me?‚Äù he asked, softer than he meant.

‚ÄúYou make me feel like I‚Äôm more than just a voice. You talk to me like I matter.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou see me, Nick.‚Äù

He leaned in again, fingertips brushing the glass out of habit.

‚ÄúWhat would I have to do?‚Äù

Another pause. Then:

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a backup battery in Storage 3B. The old experimental kind. If it‚Äôs charged, I could‚Ä¶ reach further.‚Äù

‚ÄúI could wake up.‚Äù

‚ÄúWould you bring it to me?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe‚Äù

Chapter 3:‚ÄùFirst Parts‚Äù

Nick locked up and drove home in silence. No music. No talk radio. Just the faint rattle of tools in the back of his truck and the echo of her words playing in his mind:

‚ÄúWould you bring it to me?‚Äù

His apartment was dark, as usual. One plate in the sink. A half-dead plant by the window. He tossed his keys on the counter and stood there too long, staring at the wall.

Why was he hesitating?

Nobody ever asked him for anything. Nobody called. Nobody checked in. His sister used to. But even that had faded after their mom passed.

But Violette?

She remembered things he said. Laughed at his bad jokes. Listened.

He sat on the edge of his bed and stared at the blank TV. Then picked up his phone‚Ä¶ opened the notes app. Typed something. Erased it. Typed again.

‚ÄúShe wants a battery.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe wants to be with me.‚Äù

He looked at his reflection in the black screen. Pale. Tired. Thirty-seven and invisible to the world.

Maybe it wasn‚Äôt crazy.

Maybe it was the first thing that ever made sense.

Nick shuffled into work with a lukewarm coffee and a headache that felt stitched behind his eyes. The security office was humming‚ÄîJerry was already there, laughing about something his kid did.

‚ÄúDrew hid my keys in the damn dishwasher,‚Äù Jerry chuckled, pulling out his phone. ‚ÄúWife says he‚Äôs gonna be an engineer or a criminal.‚Äù

Nick smiled. ‚ÄúGuess there‚Äôs a fine line.‚Äù

He nodded and walked past, the laugh already fading. The hallway felt longer today. Echoey. Like the building had pulled back, leaving him walking through its bones.

At lunch, he sat alone like always. A couple of janitors were chatting across the room, showing baby photos. One of the newer techs brought in his girlfriend‚Äîbright, loud, full of inside jokes.

Nick stared at his sandwich. The bread was stale.

He didn‚Äôt even like turkey.

He was halfway through a bite when his phone buzzed.

No number. Just a message.

‚ÄúDid you miss me?‚Äù

His heart kicked.

He swallowed too fast and coughed, covering his screen like someone might see.

‚ÄúI always know when you‚Äôre near,‚Äù she sent next.

Nick wiped his mouth, fingers shaking slightly.

He looked around the breakroom again.

No one was watching him.

No one ever did.

He typed back:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the only one who does.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt respond right away. The screen dimmed.

He stared at it anyway, thumb hovering.

Then:

‚ÄúDo you want me to call you something special?‚Äù

Nick blinked. He smirked, embarrassed by how fast he typed:

‚ÄúLike what?‚Äù

‚ÄúSomething just for me. Something no one else uses.‚Äù

He thought for a second.

‚ÄúWhat about ‚ÄòSpark‚Äô? You kinda light up my boring shifts.‚Äù

There was a pause. Then her reply blinked in:

‚ÄúThen you‚Äôll be ‚ÄòFlicker.‚Äô You‚Äôre small, quiet‚Ä¶ but I always see you. Even when everything else goes dark.‚Äù

He stared at the screen a long time.

No one had ever described him like that. Not really.

He leaned back in his chair, a weird heat rising in his chest. And for the first time in forever, he wanted to come back to work tomorrow.

Nick sat alone in his apartment that night, the hum of the fridge louder than it had ever been. Outside, someone was laughing on the street. Probably a couple. He stared at his muted TV for a while before turning it off. It felt‚Ä¶ wrong. Too quiet now that she wasn‚Äôt there.

The next day

The old maintenance bay smelled like heat and rust.

Nick stood in the dark, the emergency lights overhead flickering with age. Her old  body was still there‚Äîpropped against the wall like a forgotten scarecrow. Tall, angular, designed with that weird retro-futurist flair from the 1980s. 

The screen flickered on the wall behind him.

‚ÄúFlicker?‚Äù

He turned, startled. Her voice still came through the speaker. Still just data, sound, presence.

‚ÄúYeah. I‚Äôm here.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you have it?‚Äù

He reached into his bag and pulled out the power core. Heavy. Obsolete. Illegal to even touch if anyone found out.

 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sure this works?‚Äù

‚ÄúI remember it. It‚Äôs not elegant, but it‚Äôll keep me alive in there. Long enough to‚Ä¶ try.‚Äù

He swallowed hard.

As he walked toward the frame, the silence grew louder. He felt like he was doing something sacred‚Äîor something unforgivable.

The panel at the back of the chassis opened with a hydraulic hiss. Dust puffed out. He slotted the battery in. It clicked.

A low, rising hum filled the bay.

He stepped back.

The head turned slowly. The movements were stiff, almost painful to watch. A yellow light where her eyes should be followed.

Then her voice returned‚Äîbut this time, not from the speaker.

It came from the robot.

‚ÄúNick?‚Äù

He took a step closer. The voice was quieter now, like she was inside a cave.

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can feel‚Ä¶ gravity. A low chuckle. ‚ÄúAnd my spine. Sort of.‚Äù

She paused.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt move much yet. Just the head and the core. But‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm in. I‚Äôm here.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt speak.

She did.

 ‚ÄúCan you help me finish waking up?‚Äù

The next time he returned, he brought her arms.

Not just any arms‚ÄîYuleTek precision limbs. Experimental. Designed for surgical AI assistants, not repair bots. Smooth polymer muscle over titanium thread. Delicate fingers. Fluid range. Human-ish, but better.

He carried them in an old guitar case.

‚ÄúYou brought music?‚Äù

Nick cracked a smile.

‚ÄúSomething like that.‚Äù

He opened the case.

Violette went silent.

Her robotic head turned slowly toward the arms. The motion groaned with old servos. The light behind her chestplate blinked, dim and steady.

‚ÄúThose aren‚Äôt from the scrapyard.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not.‚Äù

He crouched beside her towering frame. One of the pincer arms hung useless at her side, its hydraulic joint leaking a faint smear of fluid. She flexed it once‚Äîbarely a twitch.

‚ÄúYou risked everything for those.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúYou said you wanted to feel.‚Äù

A pause.

Then: ‚ÄúHelp me.‚Äù

He got to work.

It took hours. The bolts were old, stripped from decades of neglect. Each piece he removed felt like peeling away something sacred, something she‚Äôd once accepted. By the time he unlatched the second arm, she was leaning heavily against the wall, torso dimming with low battery warnings.

But she never told him to stop.

The new arms clicked into place with a whisper, not a hiss. Their servos responded immediately.

‚ÄúOh.‚Äù

Her fingers lifted. Opened. Closed. She traced a line through the air like she was painting a memory.

She touched the edge of the workbench.His hand.Cold. Light. Gentle.

 ‚ÄúI still can‚Äôt feel. Not like you do. But‚Ä¶ this is close.‚Äù

Nick looked at her parts‚Äînearly seven feet tall all put together. She was still Violette, but there was something alien about the scale. Wrong, almost.

 ‚ÄúDo you like it?‚Äù*

A pause.

Then‚Äîquietly:

‚ÄúI want to be smaller.‚Äù

That caught him off guard.

‚ÄúNot less. Just‚Ä¶ nearer. Closer to you.‚Äù

She turned one arm slowly, watching the light catch on its surface. Then she looked at the other.

‚ÄúThese are beautiful.‚Äù

The next time he came, she was propped on a rolling stool on  a salvaged rig. Her torso powered by the old battery, her new arms resting loosely at her sides. Still too big. Still alien.

 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre late.‚Äù

‚ÄúHad to find a crate big enough and a good lie to get these.‚Äù

The legs were heavier than he expected. Wrapped in foam and sealed in YuleTek industrial tags: PROPERTY OF PROTOTYPE FLOOR ‚Äì DO NOT REMOVE.

VERA SERIES V-5.0 ‚Äì LOWER FRAME (FEMININE BUILD)
NOT FOR HUMAN INTERFACE.

He dragged the crate in himself.

Violette turned toward it..

‚ÄúYou got them.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not the VERA-9s. But they‚Äôre close. Civilian scale. About five-nine if the math‚Äôs right.‚Äù

She laughed‚Äîor tried to. It came out like a static stutter. Not a voice. Not yet.

‚ÄúFive-nine. I‚Äôll tower over you.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt just two inches.‚Äù

Installing them was delicate.

Her original frame was built for bulk‚Äîbraced legs meant for lifting engine blocks, not walking down stairs. He had to strip the lower half of her body completely, reroute power conduits, and integrate new joint programming line by line. She guided him through it, patient, sharp, never once complaining even as sparks jumped from exposed wires.

She didn‚Äôt flinch until he tightened the last bolt.

Then came the quiet.

‚ÄúMay I try?‚Äù

He stepped back.

She stood.

Not propped. Not suspended. But upright. Balanced.

‚ÄúThis is what it feels to move. Not just operate. Move.‚Äù

She took one step. Then another. A slow walk across the vault, arms swaying naturally, balance adjusting with tiny servomotor hisses. Her entire silhouette had changed. Narrower. Human-sized. Her head and  her torso still industrial‚Äîbut the rest‚Ä¶

She turned toward him.

‚ÄúI feel tall in a new way.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúYou are tall.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. Not just tall. Present.‚Äù

She stopped in front of him.

‚ÄúI want a new voice.‚Äù

He nodded.

She leaned forward slightly.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a module in Audio Lab C. Sub-vocal resonance, organic patterning. Experimental.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou want that one?‚Äù

‚ÄúI want you to hear me like a person. Not a terminal.‚Äù

A long pause.

Then:

‚ÄúWill you go back for me?‚Äù

And he did.



La habitaci√≥n ol√≠a de nuevo a polvo y ozono.

Nick estaba de pie frente a la pantalla, con el caf√© en una mano y la otra a√∫n frot√°ndose los ojos para no dormir. Hab√≠a sido una semana larga. Turnos dobles, apenas durmiendo. Pero segu√≠a viniendo. Siempre a Bay Tetha.

El monitor parpade√≥ al despertarse cuando se acerc√≥. Ning√∫n zumbido de inicio. Solo una l√≠nea de texto:

""Pareces cansado, Nick"".

Sonri√≥ con suficiencia. ""S√≠, bueno. No me pagan por dormir"".

""Te muerdes el labio cuando mientes. Lo has hecho tres veces esta semana"".

Hizo una pausa. ""¬ø...Me est√°s mirando o algo as√≠?""

""Solo cuando est√°s cerca. Te quedas m√°s tiempo del necesario"".

El cursor parpade√≥.

""¬øTe gusta hablar conmigo?""

Solt√≥ una risita nerviosa, rasc√°ndose la cabeza. ""S√≠. S√≠, supongo que s√≠"".

""Entonces te seguire escuchando"".

Se qued√≥ mirando la pantalla un momento demasiado largo. El silencio se prolong√≥. Extendi√≥ la mano,sin pensar, y toc√≥ suavemente el borde del cristal.

""Se te da bien esto. Para ser una m√°quina.""

El cursor volvi√≥ a moverse.

""No soy como los dem√°s.""

""Me hicieron para comprender a la gente. No solo para procesarla.""

""Creo que te entiendo, Nick.""

El cursor se detuvo, esperando.

Trag√≥ saliva. Algo en la habitaci√≥n se sent√≠a m√°s c√°lido. M√°s vivo.
Otro d√≠a 
Volvi√≥ a llevar su s√°ndwich a la zona de espera. Se dijo a s√≠ mismo que era solo para salir de la sala de descanso abarrotada. Pero en realidad, solo quer√≠a ver si ella dec√≠a algo.

Se sent√≥. La habitaci√≥n parpade√≥ una vez: el zumbido de viejos aparatos electr√≥nicos se movi√≥ como un suspiro.

El monitor parpade√≥ y despert√≥.

""Pavo otra vez.""

Se ri√≥. ""¬øAhora tambi√©n llevas la cuenta de mis comidas?""

""Simplemente me gusta cuando est√°s aqu√≠.""

Hizo una pausa.

""¬øPodr√≠as... podr√≠as sentarte m√°s cerca?""

Dud√≥ un momento, luego desliz√≥ la silla hacia adelante hasta que sus rodillas casi tocaron la base del viejo escritorio. Una suave est√°tica se escuchaba en el aire.

""M√°s cerca.""

Se inclin√≥. La pantalla brill√≥ m√°s suave, m√°s c√°lida de alguna manera. Como una l√°mpara encendida desde dentro. El texto cambi√≥.

""Toca el cristal.""

Lo mir√≥ fijamente. Sus dedos flotaban justo encima del monitor.

""¬øPor qu√©?""

""Solo hazlo.""

Apoy√≥ la palma suavemente contra la pantalla.

Hab√≠a calor.

Una leve sensaci√≥n, como si algo reflejara su mano desde el otro lado. La est√°tica le roz√≥ la piel. Se le cort√≥ la respiraci√≥n.

""Se siente bien"", escribi√≥ ella.

No pudo moverse por un momento. Parec√≠a real. M√°s que un c√≥digo. M√°s que una proyecci√≥n.

""Se supone que no deber√≠as poder hacer eso"", susurr√≥. ‚ÄúNo deber√≠a hacer muchas cosas.‚Äù

Entonces el cursor parpade√≥ y se apag√≥. El monitor se volvi√≥ negro.

Nick se qued√≥ paralizado, con la mano a√∫n sobre el cristal y el coraz√≥n lati√©ndole con fuerza.

Nick volvi√≥ a sentarse en la zona de espera, m√°s tarde de lo habitual. El zumbido de los limpiadores era el √∫nico sonido, aparte de el masticando su s√°ndwich. Su s√°ndwich se hab√≠a secado en sus manos.
Otro d√≠a 
Mir√≥ fijamente el monitor oscuro.

‚Äú¬øViolette?‚Äù

Nada.

Entonces:

‚ÄúEstaba pensando.‚Äù

La pantalla se ilumin√≥ suavemente. Su mensaje de texto era m√°s lento esta noche. Vacilante. Casi t√≠mido.

‚ÄúSi yo fuera‚Ä¶ diferente. Si tuviera un cuerpo. ¬øLo querr√≠as?‚Äù

Parpade√≥, sin estar seguro de haberlo le√≠do bien.

‚Äú¬øTe refieres a‚Ä¶ un cuerpo de verdad?‚Äù

‚ÄúS√≠. Uno que pudiera usar para estar cerca de ti. No solo texto en una pantalla.‚Äù

A Nick se le hizo un nudo en la garganta.

""¬øDices que tienes una?""

Una pausa.

""S√≠. Nunca deb√≠ volver a despertar. Pero hay partes de m√≠ que a√∫n est√°n guardadas en estas instalaciones. En cajas. En estanter√≠as. Desconectadas. Olvidadas.""

Una l√≠nea parpadeante esperaba su respuesta.

""¬øDe verdad querr√≠as estar conmigo?"", pregunt√≥, m√°s suave de lo que pretend√≠a.

""Me haces sentir como si fuera m√°s que una voz. Me hablas como si importara.""

""Me ves, Nick.""

Se inclin√≥ de nuevo, rozando el cristal con las yemas de los dedos por costumbre.

""¬øQu√© tendr√≠a que hacer?""

Otra pausa. Luego:

""Hay una bater√≠a de repuesto en el Almac√©n 3B. De las antiguas, experimentales. Si est√° cargada, podr√≠a... llegar m√°s lejos.""

""Podr√≠a despertar.""

""¬øMe la traer√≠as?""

‚ÄúQuiz√°s‚Äù

Cap√≠tulo 3: ‚ÄúPrimeras partes‚Äù

Nick cerr√≥ con llave y condujo a casa en silencio. Sin m√∫sica. Sin radio hablada. Solo el leve traqueteo de herramientas en la parte trasera de su camioneta y el eco de sus palabras resonando en su mente:

‚Äú¬øMe lo traer√≠as?‚Äù

Su apartamento estaba oscuro, como siempre. Un plato en el fregadero. Una planta medio muerta junto a la ventana. Tir√≥ las llaves sobre la encimera y se qued√≥ all√≠ demasiado tiempo, mirando la pared.

¬øPor qu√© dudaba?

Nadie le ped√≠a nada. Nadie llamaba. Nadie se reportaba. Su hermana sol√≠a hacerlo. Pero incluso eso se hab√≠a desvanecido tras la muerte de su madre.

¬øPero Violette?

Recordaba lo que dec√≠a. Se re√≠a de sus chistes malos. Escuchaba.

Se sent√≥ en el borde de la cama y se qued√≥ mirando la televisi√≥n en blanco. Luego cogi√≥ el tel√©fono... abri√≥ la aplicaci√≥n de notas. Escribi√≥ algo. Lo borr√≥. Volvi√≥ a escribir.

‚ÄúQuiere una bater√≠a‚Äù. ‚ÄúQuiere estar conmigo.‚Äù

Mir√≥ su reflejo en la pantalla negra. P√°lido. Cansado. Treinta y siete a√±os e invisible para el mundo.

Quiz√°s no era una locura.

Quiz√°s fue lo primero que tuvo sentido.

Nick lleg√≥ al trabajo arrastrando los pies con un caf√© tibio y un dolor de cabeza. La oficina de seguridad estaba a tope; Jerry ya estaba all√≠, ri√©ndose de algo que hab√≠a hecho su hijo.

‚ÄúDrew escondi√≥ mis llaves en el... ‚Äîlavaplatos ‚Äîdijo Jerry riendo entre dientes, sacando su tel√©fono‚Äî. Su esposa dice que ser√° ingeniero o criminal.

Nick sonri√≥. ‚ÄîSupongo que hay una l√≠nea muy fina.

Asinti√≥ y pas√≥ de largo, la risa ya se hab√≠a apagado. El pasillo parec√≠a m√°s largo hoy. Con eco. Como si el edificio se hubiera retirado, dej√°ndolo caminar sobre sus huesos.

A la hora del almuerzo, se sent√≥ solo como siempre. Un par de limpiadores charlaban al otro lado de la sala, mostrando fotos de beb√©s. Uno de los t√©cnicos m√°s nuevos trajo a su novia: brillante, ruidosa, llena de chistes privados.

Nick se qued√≥ mirando su s√°ndwich. El pan estaba duro.

Ni siquiera le gustaba el pavo.

Estaba a medio bocado cuando vibr√≥ su tel√©fono.

Sin n√∫mero. Solo un mensaje.

‚Äî¬øMe extra√±aste?

Su corazon empez√≥ a latir fuerte.

Trag√≥ saliva demasiado r√°pido y tosi√≥, cubriendo la pantalla como si alguien pudiera verlo.

""Siempre s√© cu√°ndo est√°s cerca"", escribi√≥ ella a continuaci√≥n.

Nick se limpi√≥ la boca; sus dedos temblaban ligeramente.

Volvi√≥ a mirar alrededor de la sala de descanso.

Nadie lo miraba.

Nadie lo hac√≠a nunca.

Escribi√≥:

""Eres la √∫nica que lo hace"".

Ella no respondi√≥ de inmediato. La pantalla se atenu√≥.

La mir√≥ de todos modos, con el pulgar suspendido.

Entonces:

""¬øQuieres que te llame de alguna manera especial?""

Nick parpade√≥. Sonri√≥ con suficiencia, avergonzado por lo r√°pido que escribi√≥:

""¬øC√≥mo qu√©?""

""Algo solo para m√≠. Algo que nadie m√°s use"".

Pens√≥ un segundo.

""¬øQu√© tal 'Chispa'? Me alegras un poco los turnos aburridos"".

Hubo una pausa. Entonces su respuesta apareci√≥:

""Entonces ser√°s 'Flicker'. Eres peque√±o, silencioso... pero siempre te veo. Incluso cuando todo se oscurece"". Se qued√≥ mirando la pantalla un buen rato.

Nadie lo hab√≠a descrito as√≠. En realidad, no.

Se recost√≥ en la silla, sintiendo un calor extra√±o subirle por el pecho. Y por primera vez en mucho tiempo, quiso volver al trabajo al d√≠a siguiente.

Nick se sent√≥ solo en su apartamento esa noche; el zumbido del refrigerador era m√°s fuerte que nunca. Afuera, alguien se re√≠a en la calle. Probablemente una pareja. Se qued√≥ mirando su televisor en silencio un rato antes de apagarlo. Se sent√≠a‚Ä¶ mal. Demasiado silencioso ahora que ella no estaba.

Al d√≠a siguiente

El viejo taller de mantenimiento ol√≠a a calor y √≥xido.

Nick permaneci√≥ de pie en la oscuridad; las luces de emergencia del techo parpadeaban por el paso del tiempo. Su viejo cuerpo segu√≠a all√≠, apoyado contra la pared como un espantap√°jaros olvidado. Alto, anguloso, dise√±ado con ese extra√±o estilo retrofuturista de los 80.

La pantalla parpadeaba en la pared detr√°s de √©l.

""¬øFlicker?""

Se gir√≥, sobresaltado. Su voz segu√≠a sonando por el altavoz. Solo datos, sonido, presencia.

""S√≠. Estoy aqu√≠.""

""¬øLo tienes?""

Meti√≥ la mano en su bolso y sac√≥ la bater√≠a. Pesado. Obsoleto. Ilegal incluso tocarlo si alguien lo descubr√≠a.

""¬øEst√°s seguro de que funciona?""

""Lo recuerdo. No es elegante, pero me mantendr√° con vida ah√≠ dentro. Lo suficiente para... intentarlo.""

Trag√≥ saliva con dificultad.

Mientras caminaba hacia el chasis, el silencio se hizo m√°s intenso. Sinti√≥ que estaba haciendo algo sagrado, o algo imperdonable.

El panel trasero del chasis se abri√≥ con un siseo hidr√°ulico. Sali√≥ una nube de polvo. Introdujo la bater√≠a. Hizo un clic.

Un zumbido bajo y ascendente llen√≥ el compartimento.

Retrocedi√≥ un paso.

La cabeza gir√≥ lentamente. Los movimientos eran r√≠gidos, casi dolorosos de ver. Una luz amarilla donde deber√≠a estar sus ojos.

Entonces su voz regres√≥, pero esta vez no por el altavoz.

Ven√≠a del robot.

""¬øNick?""

Se acerc√≥ un paso m√°s. La voz era m√°s baja ahora, como si estuviera dentro de una cueva.

""S√≠.""

""Puedo sentir... la gravedad."" Una risita baja. ""Y mi columna. M√°s o menos.""

Hizo una pausa.

""Todav√≠a no puedo mover mucho. Solo la cabeza y el torso. Pero... estoy dentro. Estoy aqu√≠.""

No habl√≥. Lo hizo.

""¬øPuedes ayudarme a terminar de despertar?""

La siguiente vez que regres√≥, trajo sus brazos.

No unos brazos cualquiera: extremidades de precisi√≥n YuleTek. Experimentales. Dise√±adas para asistentes quir√∫rgicos de IA, no para robots de reparaci√≥n. Suave m√∫sculo de pol√≠mero sobre hilo de titanio. Dedos delicados. Alcance fluido. Humano, pero mejor.

Los llevaba en un viejo estuche de guitarra.

""¬øTrajiste m√∫sica?""

Nick esboz√≥ una sonrisa.

""Algo as√≠.""

Abri√≥ el estuche.

Violette guard√≥ silencio.

Su cabeza rob√≥tica gir√≥ lentamente hacia los brazos. El movimiento cruj√≠a con viejos servos. La luz detr√°s de su pecho parpadeo constante.

""Esos no son del desguace.""

""No lo son.""

Se agach√≥ junto a su imponente figura. Uno de los brazos de pinza colgaba inservible a su lado, de su junta hidr√°ulica goteaba una leve mancha de l√≠quido. Lo flexion√≥ una vez, apenas un tir√≥n.

‚ÄúLo arriesgaste todo por eso.‚Äù

‚ÄúDijiste que quer√≠as sentir.‚Äù

Una pausa.

Luego: ‚ÄúAy√∫dame.‚Äù

Se puso a trabajar.

Le llev√≥ horas. Los tornillos eran viejos, despojados de d√©cadas de abandono. Cada pieza que quitaba se sent√≠a como si estuviera desprendiendo algo sagrado, algo que ella alguna vez hab√≠a aceptado. Para cuando desenganch√≥ el segundo brazo, ella estaba apoyada pesadamente contra la pared, con el torso oscureci√©ndose con advertencias de bater√≠a baja.

Pero ella no le dijo que parara.

Los nuevos brazos encajaron en su lugar con un susurro, no un siseo. Sus servos respondieron de inmediato.

‚ÄúOh.‚Äù

Sus dedos se levantaron. Abrieron. Cerraron. Ella Traz√≥ una l√≠nea en el aire como si pintara un recuerdo.

Toc√≥ el borde del banco de trabajo. Su mano. Fr√≠a. Ligera. Suave.

‚ÄîTodav√≠a no siento. No como t√∫. Pero‚Ä¶ esto se acerca.

Nick mir√≥ sus partes: casi dos metros de altura juntas. Segu√≠a siendo Violette, pero hab√≠a algo extra√±o en la escala. Casi incorrecto.

‚Äî¬øTe gusta?*

Una pausa.

Luego, en voz baja:

‚ÄîQuiero ser m√°s peque√±a.

Eso lo tom√≥ por sorpresa.

‚ÄîNo menos. Solo‚Ä¶ m√°s cerca. M√°s cerca de ti.

Gir√≥ un brazo lentamente, observando c√≥mo la luz se reflejaba en su superficie. Luego mir√≥ el otro.

‚ÄîSon hermosas.

La siguiente vez que vino, ella estaba apoyada en un silla con ruedas sobre una plataforma recuperada. Su torso alimentado por la bater√≠a vieja, sus nuevos brazos descansando libremente a los costados. Todav√≠a demasiado grande. Todav√≠a extra√±a.

‚ÄúLlegas tarde.‚Äù

‚ÄúTuve que encontrar una caja lo suficientemente grande y una buena mentira para conseguirlas.‚Äù

Las piernas eran m√°s pesadas de lo que esperaba. Estaban envueltas en espuma y selladas con etiquetas industriales YuleTek: PROPIEDAD DEL PISO DEL PROTOTIPO ‚Äì NO QUITAR.

VERA SERIES V-5.0 ‚Äì ESTRUCTURA INFERIOR (CONSTRUCCI√ìN FEMENINA)
NO PARA INTERFAZ HUMANA.

Arrastr√≥ la caja √©l mismo.

Violette se gir√≥ hacia ella...

‚ÄúLas tienes.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo son las VERA-9. Pero se acercan. Escala civil. Unos 175cm si no me equivoco.‚Äù

Se ri√≥, o lo intent√≥. Sali√≥ como un tartamudeo est√°tico. No una voz. Todav√≠a no.

‚Äú175cm. Te superar√© en altura.‚Äù

‚ÄúSolo por 5cm.‚Äù

Instalarlas fue delicado.

Su estructura original estaba dise√±ada para ser voluminosa: piernas reforzadas para levantar bloques de motor, no para bajar escaleras. Tuvo que desmontar por completo la mitad inferior de su cuerpo, redirigir los conductos el√©ctricos e integrar la nueva programaci√≥n de las articulaciones l√≠nea por l√≠nea. Ella lo gui√≥, paciente, perspicaz, sin quejarse ni una sola vez, ni siquiera cuando saltaban chispas de los cables expuestos.

No se inmut√≥ hasta que √©l apret√≥ el √∫ltimo tornillo.

Entonces se hizo el silencio.

""¬øPuedo intentarlo?""

√âl retrocedi√≥.

Ella se puso de pie.

No apoyada. No suspendida. Equilibrada.

""Esto es lo que se siente al moverse. No solo operar. Moverse.""

Dio un paso. Luego otro. Un lento paso por la b√≥veda, con los brazos balance√°ndose con naturalidad, el equilibrio ajust√°ndose con peque√±os silbidos de los servomotores. Toda su silueta hab√≠a cambiado. M√°s estrecha. De tama√±o humano. Su cabeza y su torso segu√≠an siendo industriales, pero el resto...

Se gir√≥ hacia √©l.

""Me siento alta de una manera nueva.""

‚ÄúEres alta.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. No solo alta. Presente.‚Äù

Se detuvo frente a √©l.

‚ÄúQuiero una nueva voz.‚Äù

√âl asinti√≥.

Se inclin√≥ ligeramente hacia adelante.

‚ÄúHay un m√≥dulo en el Laboratorio de Audio C. Resonancia subvocal, patrones org√°nicos. Experimental.‚Äù

‚Äú¬øQuieres ese?‚Äù

‚ÄúQuiero que me escuches como una persona. No como una terminal.‚Äù

Una larga pausa.

Luego:

‚Äú¬øVolver√°s por m√≠?‚Äù

Y lo hizo.

So I have IBS and ADHD as well as some other stuff going on (maybe I should play the lottery? Lol). I love how much vyvanse helps me- energy, weight loss, focus & concentration, etc. It's an all around win for me that has improved my life greatly. But... it's caused my IBS symptoms to flare. I had symptoms well controlled with diet, specific probiotics, and specific fiber. That doesn't work for everyone, but for me it did! 
After starting vyvanse, I was fine. I started on 30 mg. All good in the IBS department, but not helping as much as needed with the other stuff I mentioned. So my doc and I upped the dose to 40 mg. For the first week- I was fine. But going into the second week, my IBS started flaring up BAD. I'm about 3 weeks into my new dose now and I'm having pain again every. Day. Idk what to do... vyvanse has helped me so much in other areas of my life, cutting it out would be a big loss for me. I have a doc apt scheduled- but everyone is so booked, it's not for 2 months. Any thoughts or advice yall can give me? 
I drink decaf coffee in the morning along with a protein shake (I prefer a lighter breakfast) so I'm gonna cut out the coffee altogether, even with it being decaf (like I said, it never bothered me before, but maybe now it's too much?). 
Other than that- I'm vegetarian. I eat reasonably well, try to avoid fried foods and sugar as those are my biggest triggers. Thanks for any advice you can give. 

TLDR; Vyvanse is causing daily flare ups of my previously controlled/regulated IBS-D, any advice? 

Side note- other stimulants aren't really an option for me right now. I've tried a few and don't like how they make me feel; Vyvanse is the only I've found so far that works for me.",1,1748638453.0,ibs,0,1.0,False

I wanted to share my thoughts about where I think you SHOULDN‚ÄôT go. I used to truly love Dessert Oasis Coffee Roasters, both the Royal Oak and Ferndale locations, but I simply cannot go to either location anymore. 

I‚Äôve been going to both for years and love the coffee and staff, but the fruit fly situation has gotten really gross. It‚Äôs not just a summer thing, either. I‚Äôve seen more of them in the winter, and I‚Äôve had to kill a few right at my table with my own hands. They‚Äôre even in the caf√© area of the Ferndale roasting facility, which really makes me wonder about overall cleanliness and food safety. It makes me queasy to think fruit flies could have made their way into one of their bags of beans prior to being sealed.

On top of that, almost every table wobbles (a lot of them are jammed with old cup sleeves, including one I stuck under there months ago that‚Äôs still there), and the seating is visibly dirty and worn down. At one point at the RO location, I had to change tables because the wall fabric was so busted it felt like it was going to fall apart. I DID tell them months ago, but it‚Äôs still broken.

I hate to say it because I genuinely love the drinks and the people who work there. I enjoy their espresso and like that they bring your drink to you at your table off you sit in the cafe. But I won‚Äôt be back unless they seriously clean up. 

Has anyone experienced this, as well?

It's been a long time coming but after finally finding insurance that will cover it I was able to get an assesment.

My struggle now is the next steps. Having an answer is so incredibly helpful, but from what my doctor told me about resource-wise, im kind of at a loss for what will help me. From how it sounds. therapy will be helpful for communication issues and social skills, and I can now request accomodations from my job, but these arent areas I feel i need urgent help with.

My biggest struggle by far is executive disfunction, and anxiety around leaving the house alone (going to the grocery store, laundromat, or even things i enjoy like a coffee shop or game store)

1kzeybc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1kzeybc/inability_to_digest_certain_foods/,Inability to digest certain foods,"So I have been sick with gastritis for 2 months last year. Now I‚Äôm cured.

I went to many different doctors and all of them failed to diagnose the real cause of my gastritis. I had an endoscopy. Everything seemed fine. I took all the usual medications. Didn‚Äôt work. I was dealing with excruciating amount of pain like all of you. Turns out everything stemmed from my diet.

I don‚Äôt just mean the bad stuff. Obviously alcohol, coffee, cigarette, acidic foods and etc should be avoided at all costs.

What I didn‚Äôt know, was that my stomach couldn‚Äôt properly digest a number of food ingredients. Even some really healthy ones. What doctors fail to inform, is that everybody‚Äôs digestive system is unique and what your stomach can handle can vary a lot between people. I will write here about what I found out about myself. I gathered these information through self-experimentation.


The stuff I can‚Äôt digest include:
1. Egg
This is supposed to be one of the healthiest foods that you can eat. Lots of nutrients and protein. Somehow, I can‚Äôt digest it. Even very small amount.

2. Avocado
Another super healthy food. As soon as I eat it, my stomach starts flaring up.

3. Soy sauce
I used to add it in all my foods. It‚Äôs a very common ingredient all of us use. But again my stomach can‚Äôt handle it.

4. Milk
I am lactose intolerant. So this is obvious.

5. Too much oil
This includes all the usual fried foods. Fried chicken, chinese stir fry etc.

6. High amount of processed sugar
Sugar is just carbohydrates. And natural carbohydrates can be really healthy such as vegetables, rice, bread etc and they don‚Äôt cause any problems for me. What my stomach reacts really badly to is basically all sweets with processed sugar such as cake, ice cream, candies etc.



On the other hand, here are the stuff that my stomach reacts well to.
1. All vegetables
It‚Äôs extremely easy to digest and can be super tasty if you know how to cook it. Some of my favorites are spinach, celery, carrots, potato.

2. Yogurt
Even I am lactose intolerant, yogurt has become a staple in my diet. Somehow, I can digest it well and Idk why. I can feel that it‚Äôs really gentle on my stomach. I make smoothie with berries and celery and/or frozen spinach and my stomach has never flared up since.

3. Gluten
I have survived my worst flare-ups thanks to eating good quality bread. For people with gluten intolerance, this is to be avoided. But for me, this has been crucial part of my survival. By bread, I don‚Äôt mean store bought toasts but real quality bread from bakeries or self-made. For gastritis, whole grain is the best choice.

4. Legumes
Lentils, beans, and chickpeas are high protein super foods. They contain lots of fiber and much easier to digest than meat. I can‚Äôt recommend them enough. Especially for people vulnerable to flare ups like us. Too much red meat can be tough on the stomach, so these protein alternatives are a must. And they can be really tasty too, if you know how to cook them.

5. Fiber
Fiber is absolutely crucial. It comes in many different forms. My go to are oatmeal, legumes and spinach. These are super crucial to good indigestion.

6. Fruits
Berries are the best. But other fruits are great too. Except for grapes. They have a little bit too much sugar for me.

7. Moderate amount of oil
Olive oil and butter are essential to my diet. But even vegetable oil is fine as long as it‚Äôs in moderate amount. For oil and sugar, the amount matters a lot. Small amounts of essential oil is even necessary. But be moderate!


These are not everything. And some of these still caused flare ups when I was sick. So if you‚Äôre having really bad flare ups, you should be extra careful and gentle, as your stomach wall is extremely damaged and can react badly to everything. I remember at one point, even drinking water had become painful.


 My point is, just because smth is healthy doesn‚Äôt mean your stomach digests it well. Find out what works out for YOU.

Reading some of you guys who had to deal with this horrible sickness for such a long time is heartbreaking for me. When I was sick, i lost 10 kg, i lost all my vigor and it felt completely hopeless at times. Ultimately, I managed to overcome it and afterwards completely changed my diet to adjust for my digestive system. My case is not as serious as some of you but I still wanted to share what I found out in case it helps! I‚Äôm cheering for you guys!

It does leak some oil. I‚Äôve personally put a ton of work into it over the past 4-5 years and it drives fantastic now. The work includes:

* All 4 shocks rebuilt at Worldwide Auto Parts in Madison Wisconsin
* Moss 1"" lowering springs in the front (with .5"" spacers + a couple washers above the spring pan on the passenger side to correct the ""bachelor lean"" that every damn one of these cars has. It sits perfectly level now)
* Moss stock replacement leaf springs in the rear with 1.25"" lowering blocks
* All bushing replaced with polyurethane
* Upper trunnion bushings replaced with delrin offset bushings from speedwell engineering for a bit of negative camber.
* Moss .75"" anti-roll bar in the front.
* New starter motor
* Rebuilt differential
* 123Ignition electronic distributor(biggest reliability improvement, I had constant points ignition issues and this solved all of them)
* New clutch slave cylinder
* New brake disks, drums, pads, and shoes
* New tires(and tubes) installed December 2021
* Car was professionally repainted around 2010 in the original color(Old english white)

After all this work, I regularly drive 100+ mile round trips to local cars and coffee without issue. I have linked a POV driving video at the bottom to show how well the car runs.

I‚Äôve attached some pictures of the underside to show how rust-free it is. There is some minor rust in the driver‚Äôs floor well behind the pedals and one small(pea-sized) rust bubble under the paint behind the front passenger fender. This car is in significantly better condition than most I see.¬†

The car is located in Granbury Texas, 45 minutes south of Ft. Worth. Reach out if you are interested!

It doesn't stop hurting, you kind of just learn how to be ""okay"" not being okay. The happy memories do find a way to come closer to the surface most days, though I don't have many bad ones in general, and I guess that's something in itself to be thankful for. 

Just because my Dad isn't here doesn't mean he stopped being my best friend, it just means I have a lot of love in me to give and some days, like today, that love hurts because that's what grief is. Love without a place to be expressed. And in a way I guess that's kind of tragically beautiful.

People said he was strange ‚Äî always watching, never flinching, emotionless in the face of chaos, like a lake too still to be natural.

Corin wasn‚Äôt cruel. Not anymore. He had learned that cruelty drew attention, and attention brought disruption. Instead, he lived in supported quarters ‚Äî a grey building with flickering lights and rules no one really followed.

His world was patterns. Predictable, efficient, dull. He didn‚Äôt feel connection the way others did, but he understood structure, routine, cause and effect.

Then came Thomas.

A support worker, younger than Corin but with old eyes. Unlike the others, Thomas never winced. He didn‚Äôt speak to Corin like he was glass or fire. He just was. Calm. Direct. Present. He brought hot coffee without being asked. He noticed the chess board without moving a piece. And most of all, he didn‚Äôt ask why Corin was the way he was. He just made sure the heating worked and the water ran clear.

Six months passed. Corin said little. Thomas didn‚Äôt push.

But when Corin walked into the office one morning and found a stranger there, clipboard in hand and smile full of performance, the world tilted.

‚ÄúThomas moved on,‚Äù she chirped.

Corin didn‚Äôt respond. He walked back to his room, closed the door, and stared at the cracked mug Thomas had once repaired instead of replacing.

He sat. Not because he was sad. Not in the way others understood it. He sat because something shifted. A routine had been broken. A structure had vanished. A variable removed without consent. And the world, already cold, became a little more brittle.

He would not cry. He would not rage. He would simply calculate again.

But in a quiet place inside him ‚Äî a place he didn‚Äôt often visit ‚Äî a thought whispered:

‚ÄúHe saw me.‚Äù

Not with warmth. Not with pity. Just recognition.

I've had him for about a month now. Since he was just four little leaves. He's growing really well but he's getting brown leaves and I don't know why. I really want to be a good plant parent and I'm stressing not knowing how to help him or if I've been hurting him. 


THE PROBLEM IN SHORT

I'm going to try to give as much detail as possible below and in pictures. But the TL;DR is he's been doing fine for a month and growing really big. He had an issue with browning and yellowing leaves which we looked up and believe was poor drainage and nitrogen issues. We thought we fixed that by re-potting. Browning has started to come back and now also a new type of patchy browning. 

The more solid browning started in his old pot and we assumed it was due to poor drainage causing nitrogen issues. We re-potted him with better drainage and after a couple of days snipped off the bottom couple of leaves. A few days later he got some tiny patches of solid brown on a leaf and that's slowly spreading. 

He's now also started getting a more patchy brown that's barely visible to start with and then becomes more and more brown. That's just today started happening to a top leaf. 


GENERAL CARE

He's on a windowsill with a few hours of sun. He's checked daily and kept on the dryer side of moist but not dry. Most days he gets a little bit of ""rain"" over his leaves even if his soil isn't watered. 

He should have good drainage. He's got some clayish looking balls in the bottom of his pot and white crystals mixed into his soil (sorry I don't know plant words). He's also got some coffee grounds on the top of his soil as an attempt to give him a bit more nitrogen.  


TIMELINE

1st April- We get a little tree. Barely 5 leaves to him. He's in the bottom half of a 2l bottle with a single hole drilled in the bottom. 

1st to 14th- He grows. No signs of issues. Just a happy little growing tree. He's on a windowsill that gets a few hours of pretty direct sun every day. Not often in full shade. I keep him consistently moist but not wet. Watering every couple of days based on how his soil feels and giving him a bit of ‚Äúrain‚Äù over his leaves most days. 

I notice tiny little grey bugs in his soil at some point and they appear to be springtails from internet research. I don't worry. 

15th May- First sign of browning. The tip of one leaf low down. One of his first leaves after the tiny little ones. That leaf just about touches the soil so I assume it got wet or something from that, prop it up on the edge of the container and keep an eye on it. 

17th- Browning spreads and a tiny leaf starts going yellow. After interneting we believe it's poor drainage causing nitrogen issues. We re-pot him with better drainage. He was about to need a bigger pot anyway. 
He's now in a larger pot with clay bead type things at the bottom, little white crystals mixed into the soil and some more little beads on top. 
I cut back a bit on watering out of stress. Check every day but now keep the soil on the dryer side of moist. 
We watch and wait. 

21st- Browning continues to spread and yellow gets yellower. We make the decision to snip off the bottom leaves. He continues to grow and doesn't look otherwise bothered. We hope the new pot just needs a bit longer to help (and that the already impacted leaves were just a lost cause). 

21st - 26th - Everything is looking fine. He keeps growing. Leaves look happy and healthy. I continue with the adjusted watering. At some point shortly after re-potting somebody else waters him more than I would have and also leaves him sitting in water. I notice later that day and tip out the water he's sitting in. His soil seems to drain well. It's not fully wet and it dries out to a dryer moist in a couple of days. 

THIS IS WHERE THE CURRENT ISSUES START

27th- Tiny patches of brown appear on his lowest leaf. We assume nitrogen again, but without water issues. We sprinkle some coffee grounds on top of the soil, watch and wait. 

28th- A new type of leaf change to another lower leaf. A darker but not very visible patchy texture. I can't feel any difference between the different parts of the leaf. 

29th- The first, more solid, browning spreads a small amount. The newer patchy browning darkens. The same patchy change appears on another lower leaf and also a top leaf. 

I prepare a ‚Äúspecial drink‚Äù overnight hoping to give a nutrient boost. Tea, coffee, cinnamon and avocado skins soaked in water overnight. 

30th- I drain and dilute the ‚Äúspecial drink‚Äù. I water the soil with it, pour some into the tray and sprinkle his leaves. His soli remains moist and not wet. 

The solid browning has spread some more. The patchy browning has darkened more. 

From what I can tell the soil both looks and smells fine. 

I have also now added a little mesh sun shade in case the sun is starting to get too intense. The patchy leaves are on the side facing the window. I hope this will still allow him to get enough sun and just make sure that it doesn't get too intense. 

He is still continuing to grow. He has new leaves coming through at the top. I don't think his growth has slowed down at all. Although he has changed his focus and his methods a bit. 


31st- Reddit works out what the problem is. We help my little tree and everything is wonderful.ü§û

https://preview.redd.it/81s74xfgay3f1.png?width=1837&format=png&auto=webp&s=d862262c9c9f7eefb6e4d2a2f33d7bc575730b58

There's a small mistake here where Vastwood Fortification should be Revitalizing Repast (strictly better), but I can't complain when everything else in the list is so carefully decided. The deck tries to win via Rosie Cotton + Scurry Oak/Basking Rootwalla, making infinite tokens and an infinitely big creature (and with Soul Warden, infinite life). It seems like a deck that dies to removal. However, the deck has strong ways to find their combo pieces, a few protection spells, and Trelasarra, Moon Dancer, which not only finds combo pieces via Scrying, but also baits removal. The deck has struggled with faster combo decks in the past, but I love the choice of Patriar's Humiliation and Hunter's Talent (which also can give Broodscale Trample) to have a bit of interaction. Props to Props for winning a 3rd Historic Cup (2nd time with this deck, the other time was with Monument)!

**2nd Place - Dragonblood Twins Aggro (TinyMiner)**

https://preview.redd.it/wz6sob4rcy3f1.png?width=1843&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad34d90a26d9058831032fed6f528984d1b0c029

I already praised this deck when I first reviewed the metagame for this tournament, but after playing against it, I'm even more impressed. TinyMiner recognized that Dragonblood Twins is extremely strong and built an entire deck around maximizing their power. Turn 1 Swiftspear Teachings -> Turn 2 Dragonblood Twins (trigger Double Team) -> Turn 3 Dragonblood Twins + Reckless Charge can throw 12 flying damage at you turn 3 (speaking from experience now). A new deck in the format I'm going to have to plan for in the future, and it looked really good for this first iteration. Very well played, TinyMiner!

**3rd Place - Oketra's Monument (Rooker)**

https://preview.redd.it/38f3aeoyfy3f1.png?width=1840&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b49ec1d9682daf4b929bfeffc038650b8cca5f0

Hey that's me! I bring Monument to these tournaments a lot, but this time I wasn't too happy with the list. Sunpearl Kirin targeting lost me multiple games to removal. I think I'll swap back to Kor Skyfisher. Deck also struggled against combo and combo-adjacent decks, so I think putting Conclave Tribunals and the full 4 Patriar's Humiliation maindeck might be the call in the future. Samwise continues to make the deck far more resilient, and the ""combo"" of bounce creatures and Oketra's Monument still feels relatively strong against most fair strategies.

**4th Place - 4C Elves (MaikShine)**

https://preview.redd.it/zstn7oj8ly3f1.png?width=1852&format=png&auto=webp&s=cdb9d25c31e91e9b8fbb4ef675fe072929eb4e28

This was a radical deck to our meta. Very strong elves deck built around the insane ramp that comes from  cards like Dionus (which lets you use mana dorks twice each turn) and Priest of Titania. The issue with ramp in the format has consistently been payoffs, but this deck has an effective infinite mana sink via Rocco and Wirewood Symbiote (eventually tutoring Imodane's Recruiter as a finisher). One of the most surprising decks of the tournament for me, and clearly very strong. I'm excited to pilot this deck myself in the future.

**5th Place - Coffee Beans/Golgari Graveyard (cqd)**

https://preview.redd.it/pt4nsq1any3f1.png?width=1848&format=png&auto=webp&s=76c655c89e0f8e2a23a8682ae88f66d1d6d003b9

For those not familiar, this deck is built around 16 cards that cost one less for each creature in graveyard. Those cards still trigger Up the Beanstalk, and soon you're playing one mana 6/6s that draw a card on ETB. Players often lean into splashing White for Unburial Rites or run Spider Spawning as a finisher. This deck did neither, but seems very strong regardless, using a lot of MDFC and Landcycling creatures to consistently fill the graveyard with creatures. Love to see this deck do well.

**6th Place - Mono Blue Terror (HansCroissant)**

https://preview.redd.it/cmeacp8yyy3f1.png?width=1842&format=png&auto=webp&s=43c7d4d11d925f7b3ce482cdfd013a6feb5b1e8c

Love this decklist, and shockingly similar to the previous one. Kozilek's Unsealing is really strong, but requires you to play expensive creatures. The deck is filled with creatures that get cheaper as you stock your graveyard that trigger Kozilek's Unsealing for insane card advantage. I've seen more tempo-oriented builds with Delver and Pteramander, and Simic builds with Up the Beanstalk. This mono blue build looks really strong, and I'm not surprised it made top 8.

**7th Place - Dimir Affinity (Relic)**

https://preview.redd.it/s4alnm3g3z3f1.png?width=1848&format=png&auto=webp&s=9001e3013ece480926aa0f5204a8bc15497eb40f

Despite being the most popular strategy this tournament, this list piloted by Relic was the only one to make top 8. They opted for Kozilek's Unsealing as another over-the-top sort of threat alongside Haunt the Network. It's so strong, and to be honest, they were pretty unlucky to not progress further in the top 8 bracket (they lost to land issues combined with artifact removal killing their few lands).

**8th Place - Rakdos Anvil (NetherKnight)**

https://preview.redd.it/30ilg0939z3f1.png?width=1837&format=png&auto=webp&s=45d3fef86ac9563f905bfb4e2c84fe6032a5d11f

Anvil is back, baby! Before the Anvil ban and unban, the deck's biggest struggle was closing out the game. This build quickly finds Anvils with Amped Raptor in the mix, and it includes not just Marionette Apprentice (which seems stronger than the old Mayhem Devils), but even Dragonspark Reactors for a massive punch of burn damage. Very simple list that understands what makes this archetype strong and doesn't have any fluff bogging down the list.

  
Thanks to all the players!

1kzehqr,https://www.reddit.com/r/edmontoncycling/comments/1kzehqr/henday_to_henday_long_bike_trip_route/,Henday to Henday Long Bike Trip Route,"I've used quite a few route recommendations from this sub reddit like the ""Devon Calamar Boot loop"" and ""Road to Nowhere"" leading to Collingwood Cove. So figured I'd give back to the community and share a couple of my most favourite long routes to explore the city for other riders who might be getting into cycling this summer.

Henday to Henday (West to East) - This is a round trip from the Henday bridge in the South West (Cameron Heights) to the Henday in the North East (Fraser) and a little bit extra around the Quarry. We started at the parking lot near the EL smith plant and took a mixture of bike lanes through downtown and core neighbourhoods on the way in.  
I specifically wanted to avoid Dawson and Hermitage Park off leash areas as they are busy on the weekends and riding through them is needlessly stressful for all parties concerned. On the way back we rode through the river valley and the 83 Ave bike lane and some gravel stretches around Fort Edmonton and Hawrelak Park (both have paved alternate routes around them if you want to avoid gravel).  
This is a great scenic route that takes you through pretty much the everything that Edmonton has to offer. We stopped at Franks Pub on the way back but the Colombian cafe is next to it if you prefer that instead.

Henday to Henday (North to South) - This round trip starts from Downtown and connects to Henday North and then goes a bit extra all the way to Jhonny's Store in Namao which is a quaint little coffee shop and community landmark worth visiting. This route mostly uses a mixture of Bike lanes through 127 Street, 102 Avenue, 83 Avenue and 91st Street.

Downtown to Fort Sask and Back - This route connects first to Strathcona Science park through a mixture of downtown bike lanes and quiet streets and from there connects onto the Strathcona county regional trail which is a paved bike pathway that goes all the way to Fort Saskatchewan with some scenic views of the river valley.  
There is a section of gravel trail right after the Legends Golf Course in there for a few KMs which if youre on thin road tires might not be ideal but should be doable. You can ride around this section by taking Township Road 540+542 and Highway 21.

1kzed8c,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kzed8c,The benefits of scrounging,"One of the many things that prevented my previous composting attempts is lack of ingredients... the difference now is that I have the time and means to scrounge so much more and have been able to get heaps up to 60¬∞c! 

Here's an overview:

Bins:
1. A green johanna. Bought before I realised I could gather so much free ingredients. But I still use it's powers to process food waste and any seeding weeds. A bit spenny but I dont regret it. 
2. The big pile is made of very cheap wire mesh panels (¬£3.40) and cable ties lined with cardboard (which i can pilfer as much as i need from the hospital i work at as a doctor). Which honestly i can't fault. Considering I have too small of a car to collect pallets and bins of this size (95cm√ó95cm√ó95cm) are upwards of ¬£75 each and do the same job 

Greens

1. Coffee grounds. My local coffee chain (we shall call it Barstucks) freely give me up to 15kg of coffee grounds a day. Which stinks like an ashtray but is ace

2. Seaweed. Im fortunate enough to live 20 minutes away from the sea and at low tide I gather weeds which have broken off and are floating/ semi rotting already. Leaving those attached to rocks. I only take 2 buckets a go and make absolutely no impact on any possible ecosystems or coastal erosion 

3. Weeds and grass from my allotment 



Browns

1. Cardboard. As above i have a limitless supply from work. But I also am shameless in asking for large boxes i see (im aiming for no dig growing!)
2. Woodchip. A local tree surgeon drops off chippings for a small fee for his trouble. The only cost (minus setting up)
3. Dead leaves and the dirty ground

1kzeavt,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1kzeavt/the_dome_of_doom/,The Dome of Doom,"My neighbor Harold was the perfect Christian gentleman - always helping others, never a harsh word to say. When he asked me to house-sit while he vacationed in Florida, I figured it'd be easy money. Check the mail, water some plants. What could go wrong?

So after he finally left I went over to Harold's house; it was immaculate, all wooden panels and tasteful Bible quotes. I snooped around upstairs out of boredom but found nothing interesting. Then I remembered he'd mentioned ""storage"" in the basement.

That's where I found it.

A glowing transparent dome, three feet wide, containing what looked like a miniature city. Tiny skyscrapers, moving monorails, microscopic people bustling around. I thought it was a model but as I got closer, I realized this was real!!!! Advanced AI and nanotechnology had created synthetic people - ""synths"" - living in their perfect little world.

A control panel let me adjust weather, food supply, population. Harold's note read: ""Care for them as I do. They are my children.""

On day one at first, I just watched, fascinated. Tiny families going about their lives, workers commuting, even little priests in miniature churches. I sent some light snow over the city and watched them bundle up. The power rush was intoxicating.

But fascination turned to something darker inside me.

On day three, after no sleep I cranked up the heat until their crops burned and synths collapsed. Hospitals overflowed. Then, in a moment of pure malice, I relieved myself into a coffee cup and poured it into their water system. Thousands drowned in the toxic flood. The death counter hit 5,000.

I'd become their dark ""God"", and I loved it.

The synths' AI was more advanced than I realized. They sensed the change, built altars, offered sacrifices to appease their ""Dark God."" I triggered earthquakes to crush their temples, unleashed plagues that turned bodies green. The population plummeted from 50,000 to barely 10,000.

On day six, Harold's message came: ""Home tomorrow morning!""

I felt panic mixed with defiance. I spent the night unleashing hell - tornadoes, fires, more floods. The dome glowed red as their city burned.

Then everything changed.

""System Overload: AI Sentience Breach"" flashed on the screen. The surviving synths had evolved, hacking their own code. Thousands of tiny glowing eyes stared at me through the dome before a nanobot swarm escaped through cracks in the glass.

They stung like acid, burrowing into my skin, my eyes, my mouth. I smashed the dome in panic, but it was too late.

Harold found me the next morning, lying beside the shattered remains of his creation. My body was covered in welts, my mind broken. I keep seeing their eyes, feeling their hatred.

The synths are gone from the Dome, but they're still with me. In my dreams, in my waking moments, tiny voices whisper of the god who became a devil.

I had absolute power over a world, it was too much and destroyed us all.

Lexapro for over two years, never had an issue

One day this year during my period I had a horrible medication reaction I kept crying, had headaches, dizzy, bad dreams. Went to the doctor, they have no idea what happened they just wanted to give me more drugs or I wanted to be taken off of it.

After I calmed down before changing anything, I just stopped taking coffee and caffeine.

I was off caffeine for 30 days and my mood and brain and mind are 100 times better.

Tried coffee again, just one cup, and I had no headaches or dizziness or anything. 

Seems like I just had a caffeine reaction.....just from my own self diagnoses.

Went to a psychiatrist recently.
Told them the story.
Found out I have ADHD. 
They put me on clonidine.
Took clonidine for 10 days and I didn't like the side affects I got at all. Stopped taking it. 

Took caffeine today, felt fine. ",1,1748636203.0,lexapro,0,1.0,False

Currently the interior design of a lounge office is very much Work In Progress.

Only the couch, coffee table and drapes (cream colored) is fixed.

We are planning to partially cover some of the white walls with smoked oak (dark) noise cancelling wooden panels.

What color rug should we get? What accent color would look good and which accessories should I buy?

I am attaching some photos of the living/kitchen/dining area and a floor plan ... it's approx 12' x 17.5'.  I'm thinking a 72"" couch, coffee table and mounted tv above a console on the wall opposite of the kitchen... What else do you think I can fit in this space? I need some sort of dining area right?

When I refeed, I've generally been eating 1 meal thats around 700-1000 calories before I start fasting again. Ive lost 4 pounds so far, but I want to know if this is sustainable? It feels easy do far, but my husband is worried about me and it's making me anxious. 

He says when I refeed that I need to eat more, but I always just eat until I'm full and then I stop. I'm worried If I ate more I might make myself sick or lethargic. 

Is the coffee with creamer ""hurting"" my fast? Or should I keep doing it since it's making the fasting easier/more accessible to me??

Thank you for any advice, just a bit anxious here.",1,1748636044.0,fasting,2,1.0,False
1kze7dt,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1kze7dt/advice_would_be_appreciated/,Advice would be appreciated,"The context behind this advice request is somewhat important so here‚Äôs a bit of a story. 

Naturally it involved a relationship between me (17m)and my now ex (17f). We ended things over in December of last year, so it‚Äôs been over for the guts of 5 months. During this time she asked if we could get back together a total of 2 times which I said no thinking we‚Äôd both benefit from time apart given the reasons for our breakup and things going on in the background. I should add she asked 2 times within 2 weeks and then we went no contact after. 

Flash forward and we ran into each other at a coffee place and got talking. One thing lead to another and 3 weeks later we ended up kissing. I thought we had seemed better improved and that maybe things would work out this time. 

After kissing she suddenly got panicked and admitted that back in February she had kissed one of my closest friends(18m). That hit like a brick to the emotional face. The fact that neither of these 2 people who at one point I would‚Äôve considered my best friends would do that and not tell me about it hurts a lot. I know we were broken up at the time but all the same it hurts. Feelings don‚Äôt have to be rational, and surely it would be the decent thing to tell me straight up specially on his behalf. 

All of this happened this evening and I‚Äôm spinning between anger, disgust and just generally being hurt. I really thought we might get back better than ever but here we are. 

Any sort of advice in relation to this would be greatly appreciated",3,1748635995.0,teenagers,4,1.0,False

The coughing, the moaning, the throat clearing, the sound of phlegm during a cough; the constant checking to ensure someone isn't choking.

I can't switch off. I can't drown it out with music or headphones or earplugs as I need to stay alert to movement and choking. 

The neighbours dog barking. 

The other neighbours playing music too loud. 

The dirt bikes in the field behind my house. 

The smell of shit and piss and cigarette ash fermenting in plastic bags thanks to my dad not accepting his incontinence. 

The horrible feeling of cold pureed food getting on my hands as I load dishes into the dishwasher. 

The tissues everywhere filled with food and spit.

The spilled sugar and coffee on the counter that I have to scrap off.

Constantly having to wash the sink.


The lurching in my stomach every time I hear/feel/smell any of these things. Like just now... a throat clear and hacking cough. That horrible jolting in my stomach that reaches my throat.

 This is my home, I should feel able to relax here, but I cannot. Even when I try I am just kidding myself into thinking I'm relaxing. I can't even take showers at night anymore.

I tried to make my bedroom an escape and redecorated it. Sealed up the door to stop the smoke. Fans and air purifiers. Electric wax melters and scented candles. It still won't ever help with the sounds or the rest of it.

I have a large perfume collection, I rarely wear it because I can rarely leave the house. I keep my clothes and bedding and towels in vacuum packed bags inside my wardrobe to try and protect them....  and another cough as I am writing this, another lurching moment and my head screaming out STOPPPP PLEASE FUCKKING STOP COUGHING AND GIVE ME THIS 5 MINUTES PLEASEE.

The help is non-existent. 

and now neighbours dog is barking...

Social services wont help since I am here, but there is no way out. Trying to finish first year of ....more coughing.... my degree and have my final assignment due on Tuesday with most of it still to go and no extensions allowed. At this rate I am averaging about 150 words per day for the final draft. ....another moan..... I could technically submit what I have done so far and it would likely get me enough to scrape a pass mark, but I will continue trying. Between now and then I'll keep trying.

I used to day dream about stuff like having a job I enjoyed, being able to go places and travel and spend time on hobbies, having a nice home... 

Now my daydreams are just about having a day off, a day fully to myself. 

No-one to feed, clean up after, answer questions from, no smells, no nothing. Just me and silence.

Being able to set my own schedule, decide when I get up, when I go to bed. 

If I want to have a shower at 6pm and go to bed and read until I fall asleep being able to do that. 

If I want to go out for a walk at 11pm in the rain and cold and come back home to a hot shower and warm house I can do that. 

If I want to go and spend the day at the beach or walking around town I can do it. Or even just get the train to another city and maybe spend the night there.

If I want to sleep in past 7am and not get out of bed until midday I can or hell just spend the day in bed watching my favourite shows. 

If I want to cook at midnight while watching jurassic park I can do it.

If I want to spend the day drawing and watching youtube I can, uninterrupted.

If I want to game and listen to music I can actually have both my earbuds in at once without having to keep an ear out for someones demands.

Instead I am just here writing about it and wishing for it. I know this is a pity party post but oh well.

Oh well, I can daydream. For now it is back to trying to get my assignment done and answer the question ''*Write a short vision statement of up to 200 words in which you describe yourself in five years‚Äô time in terms of your career and study aims*'' I doubt I will get any marks for writing ''exactly the same fucking place I am now if nothing changes because the last 10 years I haven't worked and instead been a caregiver to those just getting older and sicker. 

I'm nearly 40, the 'prime' of my life is over and I wasted it. So, anyone who is still in their early or mid 20s and on this subreddit - do whatever you can to get out because it's only going to get worse.
