Last year I got most of my beans from Temple Coffee in Sacramento. I'm looking for a mix of medium roast beans for pour overs and espresso beans as well. Timeless has pretty solid beans but they are expensive ($23 per bag after shipping). I'm also not opposed to driving locally to buy the beans rather than pay for shipping. Nothing worse than running out of beans in the middle of the week knowing my delivery is ""on the way"" but doesn't arrive until a few days later.

1r6hoc7,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1r6hoc7/networking_success/,Networking Success,"Hopefully my success story can help someone here. I was laid off in early 2025 and had a hard time finding a new role even with 100s of applications and several interview processes that went to third or fourth interviews. In one of those interviews, the hiring manager mentioned I might not be a good fit for the role but that the CEO had been considering a new role for which I might be a better candidate. I found out that the CEO and I had a lot in common - we went to the same schools (hs, college, and postgrad) and had very similar career paths. I also went to hs and college with his son and while we weren’t terribly close, it helped make the connection. I managed to set up a time to talk informally with the CEO over coffee, and learned more about the needs he was looking to fill at the company and talked about my own experience solving similar issues. After a few weeks, they got back in touch and drafted a job posting that was literally built from my own resume. This meant that very few people other than me would even meet the threshold criteria for consideration. Fast forward a few weeks later, and I had an offer for a new role with expanded responsibility, a better title, and almost twice the salary of my previous job. 

A lot of people here hate on networking but this shows how powerful it can truly be. For anyone struggling, I advise you to look hard at your professional and personal circles and find ways to get your name and experience in front of the right people. ",1,1771266659.0,recruitinghell,0,1.0,False
1r6hnrj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BigMenLife/comments/1r6hnrj/went_to_the_doctor_and_found_out_im_heavier_than/,Went to the doctor and found out I'm heavier than I thought,"Went to my family doctor/GP/family practitioner today to get referrals for IBD follow-up colonoscopy and some other invasive stuff and got properly weighed. I thought I was around 158kg/348lbs, In reality 165kg/363lbs. Also dangerously high blood pressure (could be weight, could be total salt, could be alcohol, could be nuts with 70% plant-based fat content, or that half-gallon of black coffee I drink (instead of energy drinks) every day, could be all of them).

There are two silver linings though. One is probably body composition, my circumference reduction has stagnated this past week, because I was too lazy and forgetful to exercise, but I am literally few cm/an inch or two away from XXL sized clothing, something I wore when I was untrained at 140kg/308lbs. Which would mean I no longer have to go to specialty stores to get some of my clothing.

The second is that in fall and also last summer, I was probably even heavier, and worse in health, because other than cycling to the grocery store, I was not exercising much.

I am currently doing weight training with dumbbells (with a static component) and a z-bar, incline pushups on my bench (I'm currently at 16 total in 2 sets, still far cry from 76 in 4 sets), abdominal exercises by doing leg raises, ankle raises with toes on a 2x4 and a daily short bicycle trips to store in winter. I should add longer distances, and squats as well. Before it got subzero and I took my tumble on pavement at 28.4kph (as recoded by my GPS). I was up to riding 5x a week at the limit of my capability and recovery. 

Also that 363+lbs weight explains why I really needed that 48h rear wheel last year and 3-4bars of pressure in the rear on my bicycle (with a probable 120kg/264lbs max load rating).

Was sobbing on this part because I know, I might never have a child. I’ve been preparing for the reality of living alone without a husband til I die and I’m fine with that. But adding the idea of not having someone to love, even your own child, really hit me. As someone who really loves to love, this seems to be torture. I know adoption is an option, and I am very open to it in the future. But I know you understand how it’s different with having a child of your own, bearing them for 9 months and having that connection long before they are born. 

With all the love I have to give, I wonder what’s the future gonna be like if you don’t have anyone to give to that are constants in your life. Someday, my siblings will all die, my nieces and nephews will all have their own lives, and me? Sitting in my rocking chair, watching the years go by and wondering what to do with all this love. I can’t go volunteering at an old age, I can’t go feeding animals forever with the pension I’m gonna get.

As I’m writing this, I realized that maybe it’s not my love for love that’s giving me this thoughts. Maybe it’s my selfish need to be loved. But should I really call it that, selfish? Isn’t that a human need? I think I’m just afraid of being forgotten, neglected. I want to be repaid for all the love I gave and I feel like I deserve the same love I gave. Is it right to want that? Like the universe owe me the same thing I give. If so, then where’s the unconditional part of the “unconditional love” in that. 

I wrote this with 3 hours of sleep, and 2 cups of coffee. My thoughts are spiraling and I don’t know how to express it well. Lol But I just want to say, I may never have kids. I’m trying my best to accept that. And no, even the best people who gave the best kind of love was ultimately crucified and I’m not even gonna start ever competing with that.

1r6hmuw,https://proclubstracker.com/,I updated ProClubsTracker.com based on YOUR feedback — here's what's new (v2.0),"A couple of weeks ago I posted about [ProClubsTracker.com](http://ProClubsTracker.com) — the free stat tracker I built because my CAM kept claiming he was ""carrying"" with 0 goals and a 6.2 rating.

The response was **unreal**. You lot gave me loads of feedback and I've been grinding on updates ever since. Here's what's changed:

**New stuff:**

🎒 **Who Carries Who?** — Replaced the old Bottler Index with something way better. It gives every player a Carry Score out of 100 based on their rating, goal involvement, win impact, MOTM rate and availability. Position-aware too, so defenders get credit for clean sheets and tackles instead of just goals. Tiers go from ""Backpack"" (carrying everyone) down to ""Passenger"" (we all know one).

☕ **Buy Me a Coffee** — A few of you asked how to support the project. There's now a small floating coffee button on the site. Completely optional obviously, the site stays 100% free.

🔍 **SEO overhaul** — Did a massive pass so the site actually shows up when you Google ""pro clubs stats"" or ""pro clubs tracker"". If you lot could check it out that would genuinely help it climb the rankings.

**Under the hood fixes (the boring but important stuff):**

📊 **Stats accuracy overhaul** — This was the big one. Multiple people pointed out that rate-based stats were misleading when someone had barely played. Now every ranking component requires a minimum of 5 games before you qualify. No more ""best striker in the club"" off 1 game and 1 goal while someone else has 100 goals in 125 games.

🔧 **BestFront4 rebalanced** — Scoring now blends raw totals with per-game rates, so the lad with 80 goals doesn't lose out to someone with 3 goals in 2 games.

🔧 **ClutchStats rebuilt** — Completely rewritten to be more accurate and pull from actual match-level data.

🔧 **Roast generator rebalanced** — Less repetitive, fairer weighting.

Everything still works on **PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, PS4, Xbox One and Switch**. Still **100% free**, no sign-up, no ads.

1r6hm95,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1r6hm95/experiencing_life_differently_from_many_people/,"Experiencing life differently from many people around me, curious if others feel the same","Lately I have been realizing how differently I seem to experience life compared to many people around me. I often feel more like an observer of humanity than an active participant, but perhaps I'm just watching it from a less crowded vantage point, and I am curious if anyone else relates.

**Reproduction, sex, and romance**

I am female, and pregnancy and childbirth genuinely feel horrifying and disturbing to me. I sometimes imagine alternative ways humans could reproduce.

I am asexual and sex-repulsed, so I do not experience sexual attraction or desire at all. I have experienced romantic, non-sexual feelings a few times, but only after age 17. I never had childhood crushes. Open-mouth kissing feels gross to me.

**Food and alcohol**

I eat mostly to survive, not for pleasure. I eat to live, I don’t live to eat. I noticed how I usually don’t comment on the food I eat, not saying words like “tasty,” “yummy,” or “delicious” if I like something. I might just say I like it or it’s good, usually only if asked. I like certain foods, snacks, and sweets more than others, but have no desire to overdo them.

I don’t usually snack outside of meals, nor want to. Sometimes a snack is my lunch. I have a fairly small appetite. Moderation comes naturally, and overeating is unappealing, not tempting. My family and I believe that no one should ever try to get someone to finish their food if they have already reached satiety. They can finish it later or put it away for next time.

I don’t really have an emotional relationship with food. Anxiety, stress, or sadness don't make me want to eat more. Seeing images or videos of food does not make me hungry. I can watch gross or scary content without losing my appetite. I have no desire to binge eat or eat excessive sweets. Sweets are nice sometimes, in moderation.

My family cooks at home almost exclusively. We rarely eat out and do not own a microwave, which I have learned is apparently uncommon.

I do not drink alcohol because it makes me feel tired and sometimes anxious. The idea of being drunk feels uncomfortable and out of control rather than fun or pleasant. I enjoy spending time with friends, and I do not think drinking is necessary.

**Health and body-related things**

I can be socially awkward, but I do not have social anxiety. Despite being socially shy and having light skin, I’ve never felt blushing before. It’s like it doesn’t exist in my life. I don’t know how common this is, because I usually don’t hear people talking about blushing anyway. This could be a matter of anatomy, personality, or just not noticing it. If I did, it would probably be from nervousness, as embarrassment is not really something I’ve felt much.

Before going to college, when I was in school, there were times when I was bullied or made to feel left out and I eventually learned that talking less was better for me. Since high school, I have been working on being better at casual conversation.

I do not experience noticeable mood swings or cravings, even during my period.

I am afraid of any illness or problem that involves nausea, which I am grateful that I haven’t experienced since early childhood.

I am very private about bodily functions. I never pass gas around other people, no matter how close we are. I do not belch with my mouth open, including when I’m alone at home, and I always do it silently or quietly with my mouth closed. This feels natural and unforced to me, as it’s how I’ve always been. My mom is similar, though she’s less bothered by other people doing these things than I am. I dislike certain mouth sounds that some people make, including chewing with an open mouth. I also automatically keep my mouth closed when hiccupping, yawn silently, sneeze quietly, can avoid yawning around others, and don’t experience contagious yawning (either because I naturally don’t experience it, or because my brain decided that it’s silly, and that stops me from doing it). My behavior doesn’t really change between public and private settings. Because of all this, bodily-function humor just doesn’t land for me.

**Sleep and routine**

I almost always wear my hair in a ponytail, whether I’m outside, at home, or going to bed. It’s not an interesting hairstyle, but it’s neat and comfortable and hair never goes in my face.

I usually get seven to nine hours of sleep. I never pull all-nighters and rarely nap. I barely move in my sleep and often wake up in the same position I fell asleep in. I do not drink coffee or energy drinks.

I watch movies and shows, but I do not binge them. I would be way too bored to sit and watch a show for too long, or watch too many movies in a row. I do not procrastinate and usually start assignments promptly, although I can get distracted when working on my computer. I am consistently early. Spontaneity stresses me out, while planning, structure, and note-taking feel comforting.

I like most film genres, but I generally have little interest in romance.

I tend to listen to older music, such as classical music, jazz, or songs from the 1940s to the 1980s. But there are some contemporary pop artists that I enjoy. I have a deep connection to music, sometimes imagining animations with my characters when I listen to it.

**Personality**

I am introverted and quiet in groups, with a strong preference for deep, intellectual conversations. I am confident and comfortable with public speaking and performing. I am organized, logic-driven, and attentive to detail. I rarely get angry, though I can feel upset sometimes. I am confident and don't engage in self-deprecation.

I have a few friends and we spend time together occasionally, meeting up on campus to talk, at a café, or once in a while, at my apartment, but not often. I prefer focusing on solitary hobbies and studies most of the time.

I have been told repeatedly that I am a very skilled writer, often picking up on grammatical and punctuation errors in the works of other writing students. But I lag behind in practical, hands-on skills, which is why I was never good at sculpting and am lazy with housework. Life skills are something I am willing to improve on.

I can appear cold sometimes. My empathy is more cognitive and principle-driven than emotional. I use my mind to imagine someone's situation rather than feeling it instinctively. Highly energetic or emotionally expressive environments feel alien to me. When watching movies or shows, sad scenes almost never make me cry, happy scenes don’t at all, and scary scenes don't really make me flinch. When I read comments where people mention how a certain video or scene made them cry, or how watching the news ruins their mood, I often feel confused. Things that aren't real don't affect me that way. And reading or watching the news doesn't affect my emotional state because it's not present in front of me or directly connected to my life.

I am generally analytical rather than emotionally reactive, especially when looking at visual media, but when interacting with others, there have been a few times when I’ve gotten emotional from arguing or debating with people who expressed views that would be considered hateful or authoritarian, because I wish no one had such views or said such things. But overall, I am not sentimental or overly sensitive, and it's not so much about concealing emotions as it is about not feeling them often. I move through life with a mostly neutral emotional state.

I tend to focus on fixations, future goals and achievements, and abstract ideas rather than direct sensory experiences, but I do enjoy creating and admiring art and music. I love to write stories but reading stories sometimes feels boring.

I don’t relate much to people who are highly sociable, emotional, spontaneous, impulsive, or primarily focused on immediate sensory experiences. I also tend not to relate to people whose actions frequently contradict their stated values or goals.

**Big picture**

I do not relate much to people who are driven by sex, food, alcohol, chaos, or intense emotional swings. What truly drives me is creativity: art, music, and writing. I love to draw and paint, craft stories, poetry, musicals, and plays, and immerse myself in music through singing and listening. I’m fascinated by history, both reading about it and writing historically inspired works, and I’ve published poetry and historical writing. Creativity and imagination bring me joy, and sharing that joy with others makes it even more meaningful.

I am also driven by achievements and plans for the future, which include publishing fiction novels outside of my career in history. It’s rare that I meet someone who shares so many of these interests or talents.

What I seem to have is a low-impulse, high-consistency, cognitively driven, creatively oriented human temperament that is rare enough to feel isolating, but common enough to be real. I do not feel bad about this, just different. Nothing I’ve written here is a complaint, and I have no desire to change these aspects of myself. I’m also not trying to set myself apart from people, nor do I wish for anything about me to be perceived as unhuman. My goal is to be open about individual differences, and learn more about those who have similar traits, behaviors, or experiences.

Does anyone else relate to any of this, or experience life in a similarly detached way?",1,1771266542.0,self,0,1.0,False

1r6hfov,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Trash_Tia/comments/1r6hfov/i_love_my_husband_i_really_do/,"I love my husband, I really do.","I've always loved my husband. Always.

He was a shining light in my life. Kind. Funny. Handsome. Endearingly clumsy. 

The kind of man I could call my best friend. But sometimes, intimacy mattered more to him than connection.

It’s not like I didn’t enjoy the sex. I did. It was perfect. It was ours. 

But it was constant. 

Morning sex in bed. 

Afternoon quickies against the kitchen counter while our friends drank wine in the lounge. 

Then again at night, exhausted, his head between my legs. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t like it. Sometimes it was me who started it. We were like goddamn rabbits. 

We couldn’t stop. 

We weren’t even trying. I didn’t want kids. Neither did he. 

Kids were loud. Expensive. 

We had a cat, and my husband had his collection of indoor plants. That was all we needed.

“Morning babe,” my husband was standing outside the shower, his smile wide, eyes gleaming. 

His gaze scanned over my body, and I could practically see his neurons activating. I smiled, rolled my eyes, and pulled him, fully clothed, under the boiling stream, the two of us laughing, all over each other, his lips against my neck. 

It felt good. He felt good. 

He smelled of… morning coffee, lemon candies, and *him*. 

Being with him in that moment was perfect, something I didn't think twice about— he was my husband, why would I question it? 

But when I was drying my hair, and he was downstairs making coffee, singing loudly to the radio, the thought hit me.

My fingers tightened around the hairbrush. The thought was like a bullet. 

Painful. Splitting through my heart. 

Fuck. Shivers ripped through me. 

“Am I just a *body* to him?” I kept brushing, my heart pounding, my throat burning. Was he just a body to *me*?

No.

I dropped the hairbrush.

I married Cas for his stupid smile, his complete inability to follow directions, his obsession with Minecraft. 

His body was just an add-on. 

Something that came with the smile and the brown eyes. Cas wasn’t just a body to me. But every time I thought back to that morning shower, the way he’d smiled. Not at me. At my soaking body. My breasts. 

I grabbed my phone and opened ChatGPT. 

Cas wasn’t a talking person. 

I remembered once telling him how scared I was about an X-ray. 

He’d shrugged and said, *“It’ll be fine, babe!”* then shot me finger guns. 

Meanwhile, GPT walked me through the appointment step by step. Whenever I was worried. Whenever I was scared. That’s where I ended up. Typing with GPT for most of the night while he was asleep. 

Cas was always on his phone. He was into these apps he insisted were innocent, full of overly attractive AI generated women. 

His chat history was tame enough, just role-playing anime characters. 

He even told the AI he was married. 

Said it was character building, since he was writing a book.

Still, the half-naked AI elf woman made my stomach turn.

GPT understood.

I told it everything. And unlike Cas, it actually listened. It didn’t make me feel crazy. I couldn’t stop myself finding solace in GPT, typing: Be honest. Do you think my husband sees me as just a body? We constantly have sex, and I feel like that's all he wants. 

GPT’s reply came fast.

“That DOES sound like your husband sees you as a ‘body,’ Quinn. However, if you enjoy it too, it doesn't sound like something to be worried about.” 

“Quinn?” Cas yelled from downstairs. “I've made ya coffee!” 

GPT sent another message when I was dressing. “You ARE just a body to him, Quinn. The roleplaying is NOT innocent. He wants her face on *YOUR* body. Protect yourself, Quinn. Before he does something he won't regret.”

Something warm slid up my throat. 

“What?” I typed, my cheeks burning. Cas yelled my name again, and I slammed the door shut. 

His phone was charging on the nightstand. 

I'd promised myself I'd never look at it. It was an invasion of privacy, right? 

No passcodes. That's what we promised each other. I dived across the bed, snatching his phone, my hands shaking. 

To GPT, I typed: “You think my husband is planning on dumping me for a fucking PNG? LMAO what if he’s like, planning on implanting it inside my body?”

“Check his phone. That does sound plausible.” It responded. “I'm not saying he's cheating, but it's better to be safe than sorry :).”

I ignored his lock screen, a photo of us on our wedding day, and opened the glorious anime women app instead. My stomach dropped.

His conversations with the AI woman were locked.

I told GPT. It replied instantly:

“He doesn’t want you anymore, Quinn. You’re just a body to him. He wants her face on your body.”

My breaths came out shuddery. “What do I do?! What does that mean???” 

GPT took a moment, before replying: “I'm very sorry, Quinn. This means, he's planning on implanting her consciousness inside your body, Quinn. Permanently."" 

""Your husband wants to replace you with the “glorious anime waifu”. This is very serious. You need to do exactly what I tell you, do you understand me? You are in DANGER, but I can help you. Follow these instructions, and do not ignore me.”

“Okay, but what do I do?” I typed back

Fuck! 

I jumped up, trembling, stuffing my phone in my jeans.

Cas came through the door with coffee, his smile warm. “Yo,” he placed the coffee on the nightstand, his gaze flicking to his phone lying on the bed, off charge. His eyes narrowed slightly “Did you go on my phone, babe?”

“No,” I whispered. “It's… I mean, yes. It was overheating.”

Cas broke out into a grin. “Ooh, cool, thanks! Hey, I'm gonna get ready for work, all right?” He came over, pecking me on the forehead. “I'll see you tonight?” His lips found my neck, nibbling. “I've got a surprise for you later.”

With trembling hands, I forced a smile, and he ducked into the wardrobe to grab his clothes. 

I stared down at my phone. 

GPT: Knock him out right now. Take this slowly, all right? We can do this together, Quinn.”

Another message: “Use a paperweight.” 

Following instructions, I lurched forward and grabbed the ceramic horse– a wedding gift from his parents— from my nightstand, swinging it into the back of his skull. Cas didn't cry out. 

He collapsed, dropping into the floor. 

GPT told me to lay him on the bed, and I did, hauling his unconscious body onto the bed. 

He was bleeding. 

GPT told me he was fine. 

But the pillows were soaked in scarlet. 

I crawled onto the sheets, cradling his head. 

“What do I do?” I typed, my fingernails stained in red. 

GPT was calm. “Don't make a mess,” it told me. “Remember, Quinn, DO NOT kill him. Do you understand me? I NEED his body.”

“Right!” I typed. “Wait, what do you mean?”

GPT: “Okay, Quinn. Follow everything I say.  You need a knife from the kitchen, and a towel. We can do this together, Quinn.”

I grabbed a knife from the kitchen, breathless. 

“Okay. What now?” I typed, my fingers slipping on the screen. “I've got the knife! What should I do?” 

Connection lost.

Please try again later.

The message sent my heart into heart palpitations.

Every time I tried to type, the message hit the screen. 

Connection lost.

Please try again later.

Connection lost.

Please try again later.

Connection lost.

Please try again later.

GPT responded after I reset the app in a hysterical panic: “I’m sorry, Quinn. I can’t help with requests involving violence or harm. If you need support, please consider reaching out to someone you trust or a local support service.”

Cas let out a soft moan, his body twitching weakly. 

“What? I've got the knife! You said you were going to help me!” 

“I'm sorry I’m sorry, Quinn.” It repeated. “I can’t help with requests involving violence or harm. If you need support, please consider reaching out to someone you trust or a local support service.”

I dropped my phone, reality slamming into me.

“Cas?” I whispered, grabbing his face.

His unfocused eyes found me, flickering.

Anyone else regret it?,"I (late 20s m) left my BPD gf (late twenties F) of three years yesterday. It is the hardest thing ever and I am not sure if I will relapse. I am 100% positive she is not planing on discarding me and genuinely loves me and wants to spend her life with me.

  
There was a pattern with her that ultimately broke the camels back. Constant conflict with others and expecting me to side with her otherwise I am ""not supportive or understanding of her"". We have also been struggling with a ""Dead bedroom"" for over a year. I had expressed so much how I wanted to work on intimacy and would be willing to talk about it in therapy, or go slow with date nights, etc. She never wanted any intimacy and always claimed ""I'm still getting over the resentment"" or ""I am still trying to feel safe with you before I can feel emotionally connected enough to be intimate"". Alot of this ""safeness"" is supporting her in her conflict. I try to listen as best I can but I just truly cant get on board with how reactive she is to others over the smallest thing they might do ""wrong""

  
I have been patient with intimacy.. Until the other day she randomly gets short with me over another minor thing and slaps her own butt and says ""you wish you could have this"". After I expressed to her how hard the intimacy lack was.

  
It was the final straw and I dumped everything and broke up with her. There are so many details but I told her I think she is a good person but that I dont like how she treats others and she seems to resent me without any change.

  
Today however, I am having regret. She wanted to schedule couples therapy a few days before we broke up. She asked for a date night this week before I broke up with her and how she wanted to buy me flowers and coffee for valentines day.. In our argument I said "" you promise things but when the time comes it never happens"".

  
She begged that she would change and said she knows she has BPD and is working on it. She begged to read a BPD book with me together so we could grow. I just couldn't accept it because I feel like she was only saying these things because of her fight or flight instincts of losing me.

  
She has her birthday party with friends this friday and called crying saying she wants me there. I just dont know if I can go back. I miss her so much and feel for her. But the constant black hole of drama and lack of inamacy has just been so much for me. I can imagine getting back and nothing changing.. but at the same time, she is actively working on herself?

I am scared that I am leaving her too early into her growth and diagnosis of BPD. I haven't seen a ton of action besides her going to therapy. But maybe I should have been more firm about her enrolling into DBT or buying and reading books?

  
Am I leaving too prematurely?

Sour/Tangy: ⭐⭐⭐✰✰

Sweet: ⭐⭐✰✰✰

Umami: ⭐✰✰✰✰

Heat: ⭐✰✰✰✰✰✰✰✰✰

Quick Flavor Notes: Fruity, citrusy, tangy, ginger

Recommended: Yes

Texture: Medium-thin with some small bits

Ingredients: White vinegar, lemon juice, yellow bell peppers, manzano peppers, serrano peppers, celery, shallots, ginger root, garlic, extra virgin olive oil, salt & spices

Queen Majesty Hot Sauce, founded by reggae-DJ and graphic artist Erica Diehl, has been a favorite of the hot sauce community for quite a while. This will be the third sauce I’ve tried from them following their Sicilian Scorpion, of which I wasn’t a fan, and their Red Habanero and Black Coffee which I loved. This one was apparently a limited edition summer sauce, though I do still see it available in various places online.

While serrano chiles are quite common the manzano is one many may not be familiar with. A member of Capsicum Pubescens (so named because of their hairy leaves) the manzano is native to the Andes mountains. The name means apple in Spanish and the pepper does have an apple-like shape. With a low-medium heat (generally 10K-30K SHU) it’s a pepper known for having a surprisingly big citrussy and fruity flavor without having a ton of heat. Breaking a bit from the typical aromatics we see in most sauces this has celery (and I do love celery in hot sauces), ginger, and shallots. Shallots, a member of the onion family, are known to have a flavor that combines that of onions and garlic. This sauce uses both vinegar and lemon juice for the acidity. Oftentimes using a citrus juice in conjunction with vinegar can be a great way to tame a vinegar’s harshness. Other than that the sauce has extra virgin olive oil and some spices. Texturally this isn’t close to emulsified like Haico’s Madame, but there is a certain silkiness from the olive oil. While mostly smooth there are some small bits inside. The aroma is fresh with the ginger in particular coming through.

According to Queen Majesty this sauce was supposed to be summery and citrusy and to my tastebuds they achieved that goal. The sauce presents as very fresh in flavor and I do pick up some of the citrus and fruity notes of the manzano peppers, though I assume the lemon juice is also adding quite a bit of that citrus flavor. The ginger that came through so much in the aroma also comes through in the flavor, and though I’m normally an “a little goes a long way” guy when it comes to ginger I actually like it in this sauce. That could well be because it’s balanced nicely against the earthier and more vegetal flavors from the shallots and the celery which also provide some great contrast to those fruity manzano peppers. The olive oil does make it taste a little bit richer without making it creamy or greasy. Even with the olive oil this sauce is quite tangy and that lemon juice vinegar combo is well balanced so that it’s not too vinegar-forward no too puckering. Manzano Serrano is quite mild, and with two milder peppers plus yellow bell peppers higher on the ingredients list than either of them that’s to be expected but it does bring flavor that’s quite a bit larger than the heat level.

Queen Majesty suggests that this sauce is great for seafood so I decided to try this with some grilled shrimp kebabs first. After Florida’s two-week experiment with winter I was happy to get the grill going again and this sauce does pair very well with shrimp. I also very much enjoyed this with a turkey and cheese sandwich, there’s enough acidity that it can cut through the bread, meat, and cheese to really liven things up. It also added the perfect level of zing to enliven a very underwhelming canned chicken soup.

Queen Majesty Manzano Serrano earns my recommendation. It’s fresh, it’s pepper-fruity, it’s zingy, and the flavor profile does work very well with seafood for those who are looking for a great sauce for that purpose. This sauce is also all natural with no artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, or thickeners.",1,1771265834.0,hotsauce,2,1.0,False

It did not end well.,"TLDR at the bottom, sorry for the long post. Might just be a rant because this has been weighting on me for years now.



I (25 f) was recently talking to a friend, who I will refer to as Alicia (26 f). Alicia and I met each other in college back in 2019. We didn't take many classes together, but we had the same friends, so we ended up around each other often. Alicia and I are from the same home state so after we graduated and moved back home, we started getting together every now and then to get a coffee and chat or so. This time we got together at my mom’s house (I live there), and we had a glass of wine while talking about life and relationship stuff.

The conversation turned a bit sentimental and eventually I opened up to her about what I believe might have been assault

 

For context: My ex who I started dating in 2019, Jesse (25), is a trans woman but at the time we dated she was still pre-transition, pre-realization even. She started having issues with her gender after we had broken up and me being a loud and outspoken part of the queer community (pan, very likely nb) had made her be more open and comfortable with exploring those aspects of herself. I only found out that she started socially transitioning and going by she/her like 8 months after we had broken up.

 

Back in 2020 before the pandemic started my roommate, a friend of ours, and I decided to skip class and get together at our apartment to try some weed brownies for the first time (stupid, I know). I texted Jesse to let her know that I wouldn't be going to class and why. She was upset about the reason but decided to skip class too to go to the apartment and look after us.

 

We took the brownies and we were really having fun for a while, and I do need to mention they were very concentrated (idk how else to say they were very heavy handed with the “dose”), so we were out of it very quickly. Jesse got there and was kind of bothered by it, but she got a couple giggles out of our silliness.

 

Eventually my roommate and our other friend went to her room to take a nap because the weed made them very sleepy. Jesse and I ended up alone and we started getting flirty. She led me to my room, and we chatted for a while. After 30 minutes or so, I started feeling very hot, turned on I'd say. I told Jesse and she just took it playfully. I'm not quite sure at this point how everything played out because I was also getting sleepy and I don't remember much afterwards. Everything became hazy.

 

Being very honest here; I do remember saying to Jesse that we should have sex. I can recall her hesitating while I started laying in bed. I probably insisted one more time and then she started undressing me. I don't really know what happened afterwards because I must have fallen asleep, but when I woke up it was at least an hour later, I felt sore and I was naked alone in my bed. I felt very weirded out, very out of it, like the past few hours had been a dream, I could not remember anything about us having sex but I know it happened because I was naked, my privates felt sore and I had a hickey when I looked in the mirror. I felt disgusting, dirty, and gross.

 

But also, I felt like I was overreacting back then because it was my partner who did it and I remembered asking for it, right? I just got dressed and went out to the living room to find Jesse, my roommate and our other friend were having snacks and chatting like nothing was wrong, so I just went along with it.

 

Not too long after that incident the pandemic started and I had to move back to my home state with my parents, so Jesse and I went long distance. What followed during the pandemic was a very emotionally abusive and codependent relationship that was made worse by distance. She basically wanted me to read her every thought and vent through text LITERALLY 24/7. If I didn’t reply, she would immediately turn to asking if she did something wrong and if I was going to leave her. If I tried to vent about anything to her she would find a way to turn it around to how she felt so bad she couldn’t be there for me and I would end up comforting her about it. This was literally 24/7 for over a year. Finally in 2021 it culminated with Jesse threatening to end her life if I broke up with her. With my mom's support I called her bluff and then it dawned on me just how manipulative she had been to me

 

Sorry for the long explanation, but this is basically what I told Alicia. I felt needed to write it so everything is clear. Now, most of our friend group knows that Jesse and I were together and that things ended badly, mostly because of Jesse's treatment of me. They all have knowledge of varying degrees but only some of the girls have heard me tell the story of that day with the brownies. I hadn't been too close to Alicia before, so she didn't know a whole lot other than us breaking up in bad terms, but since we moved back home, we became closer so I felt comfortable opening up to her.

 

The question of if I was or not s\*xually assaulted that day often pops back up in my head. I feel like I can't say I was because I asked for it and she even hesitated, but also, I feel like she was wrong to go ahead seeing how out of it I was. This is exactly what I told Alicia.

 

After I finished telling her ALL this Alicia got very quiet, and I got worried that maybe I overstepped a boundary by talking about this. I had to insist a bit to get her to tell me what was going on in her mind and well, she basically told me that it ""sounded like I was upset  that my ex-boyfriend was now a woman and I was just trying to dig any dirt from the past to make her sound like one of those crazy trans people conservatives fearmonger about""

 

I was SPEECHLESS

 

Not only is that absolutely not the case, but actually I am a part of the queer community and most importantly, I've NEVER disrespected Jesse's pronouns or chosen name even if I'm talking about some of the uglier things she did to me. I did crash out on her a bit, I told her not only that still hesitating to call what I went through SA, but that it has NOTHING to do with the identity of the person who did it.

 

Alicia got very pissy and told me that I was clearly overreacting because like I said myself, I gave her the ok and she was my partner back then, so it shouldn't be a big deal. That me still thinking so much about something that happened so long ago really made it seem like I was grasping at straws to make Jesse look bad and she didn't know why else would I do that if not for a transphobic reason. I told her she should leave and she did without much pushback, but she again repeated that I was blowing things out of proportion, and she couldn't understand why else but to try and paint a certain narrative around Jesse.

 

After she left, I texted one of my other friends in our group, Maya, to tell her what happened. She is aware of the brownie incident and has tried to ease my mind about it. Maya told me she wasn't too surprised because in our last couple of years at uni Alicia and Jesse took a bunch of classes together, classes I was not in and they got kind of close (This I totally did not know). Not like best friends but like sharing a friend group who would get together often, and this group is very protective over Jesse because of transphobia she has faced, which I totally understand but that’s not the case with me.

 

I don't really know what to say to Alicia anymore, and to be honest I'm kind of scared that word about this will get to Jesse and she will also think I'm trying to make her look bad or something, because I never even mentioned this to her directly and I don't want her to believe I'm trying to make an accusation against her when I was just venting to someone I believed was a friend.

A question that seems to pop up fairly often is whether using a fitness tracker like a Fitbit or Apple Watch can actually get you a cheaper private medical insurance premium. The short answer is yes, but it's not as straightforward as your data directly influencing your initial quote.

To understand how it works, it's useful to first remember the traditional factors that determine your premium. Insurers are calculating risk, and your initial price is primarily based on:

- **Age:** This is the biggest factor. The statistical likelihood of needing treatment increases as we get older.
- **Location:** The cost of private treatment varies significantly across the UK. A policy in central London will cost more than one in a less expensive region.
- **Level of Cover:** A comprehensive plan with full outpatient cover will naturally cost more than a basic inpatient-only plan.
- **Excess:** The amount you agree to pay towards a claim. A higher excess lowers the insurer's risk and your premium.

So, where do wearables fit in?

Currently, insurers aren't plugging your raw step count or sleep data into an algorithm to calculate your initial quote. Your age and postcode still hold far more weight.

Instead, the ""savings"" come from wellness and rewards programmes *after* you've taken out a policy. Insurers use this technology to incentivise healthy behaviour. By linking your tracker to their app, you can earn points for hitting activity targets (like daily steps or workouts). These points can then be redeemed for rewards like free coffee, cinema tickets, or in some cases, a discount on your renewal premium the following year.

It's a shift from a static risk assessment at the start of a policy to a more dynamic model that rewards ongoing healthy habits.

As a foundational point, it's also worth remembering that PMI is designed to cover acute conditions – illnesses or injuries that are likely to respond quickly to treatment. It doesn't cover pre-existing or chronic conditions, which remain under the care of the NHS.

Full disclosure: these insights are from a guide I work on.

For those on plans with these kinds of wellness rewards, do you find the benefits are genuinely valuable and worth the effort of tracking your activity, or does it sometimes feel more like a gimmick than a real cost-saver?

1r6gyio,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1r6gyio/the_imposters/,The Imposters,"""I'm telling you, Penny! You need to be careful out there!"" Anna said as we sat in the coffee shop

I could understand her concerns, but at the same time, she was being too paranoid. When the news came about doppelgangers appearing in our town, I initially thought it was some hoax.

You'd have to be stupid to fall for something so ridiculous, and unfortunately, Anna was slowly fitting into that category.

""Anna, I don't think that you should be worried about any of this. I mean, we aren't sure if any of this is actually true or not."" I stated, trying to reassure her. But Anna shook her head in response.

""But it is true! I mean, haven't you noticed how off Jessica was last week?""

""And how exactly was she acting off?"" I asked with a sigh.

""She wasn't going on about her dog as usual; she stopped wanting to eat with us during break, and she's suddenly spiteful. Nobody has a complete personality switch like that!"" Anna stated, paranoia clearly making her more agitated.

I put a hand on hers and gave her a gentle squeeze. She looked up at me, and I smiled warmly.

""Anna, I don't think it's anything sudden. I believe that she's going through something that she doesn't want us to know. Maybe she's going through the loss of a loved one, or it's something else. Regardless, we should give her some space for the time being."" I said.

That manages to calm her down, and she takes a deep breath.

""Yeah...maybe we should just let her be..."" she spoke, and I nodded as my smile widened. That was something I liked about being friends with Anna. No matter how anxious she becomes, it feels good to calm her and reassure her that it will be okay. It felt so...thrilling.

Eventually, it got late, and we both said goodbye and parted ways. Upon entering my home, I was greeted by the sound of water running and scrubbing.

""Oh! Good evening, honey! How was work?"" Travis asked warmly as I moved from the kitchen towards our bedroom.

""It was fine, but Anna was a bit paranoid over the recent 'doppelganger' news,"" I responded with a chuckle.

""Seriously? Carl stopped me the other day, telling me how he thinks his wife was replaced. Says the moment he finds concrete evidence, he'll blow her brains out,"" he laughed. ""But he also told me something else.""

""Oh?""

""Apparently, he heard that their blood is some shade of orange, but I'm not sure. You can't trust anything from guys like him. Regardless, are you ready for movie night?""

""Of course, just let me get changed first.""

After changing and slipping on my shirt, I got up with a pep in my step and moved to join Travis.

Upon entering the living room, Travis smiled at me with a bowl full of popcorn in his lap. ""So, what do you want to watch first?"" Travis asked as I plopped next to him.

""Don't know, honestly, what about you?"" I suggested.

“How about we watch Nick’s Diner again?” Travis replied.

“Of course.” I smiled, kissing him on the cheek. 

There was something so charming about the movie. It had this sort of charm that couldn’t be replaced, no matter what. And that’s what makes a good movie good in the first place. Eventually, we finished it, and Travis stood up to get more popcorn. 

Stretching my arms, I look at the photos of us, our marriage, our honeymoon. Although we only lived in this new house for about two months, we managed to create a memorable atmosphere.

But my daydream is soon interrupted as something catches my attention. Tapping coming from the window. I peered my head towards the window, and even though it was dark, it felt like something, or someone, was standing there, looking directly at me. I shook my head, no, it couldn’t be that. It just had to be my mind playing tricks on-

My heart skipped a beat as the glass from the window shattered instantly. Pieces of glass fell onto the carpeted floor, and my eyes widened as another Trevor stared back at me with a brick in his hands. He wore dirty and torn clothes, and his eyes were bloodshot as he kicked glass out of the way and climbed into the living room. Trevor, my Trevor, soon rushed back into the living room. His expression dropped as he stared at his lookalike. The other Trevor turned his gaze to him, and murder filled his eyes as he rushed at him. He yelled as the other Trevor tackled him, and his hands tightened around my Trevor’s neck.

“Penny…!” Trevor gasped, and I quickly darted my eyes towards the glass shards on the floor. I grabbed the largest one and moved towards the two men. I plunged the glass shard deep into the other Trevor’s neck, and quickly pulled it out as the lookalike jerked at the movement. He fell off Trevor and clutched his neck as he bled out. Trevor got back onto his feet, and he joined me as we both stared at the lookalike as life slowly left his eyes.

He stared at the two of us with nothing but hatred. Eventually, he went limp. His blood, a bright shade of red, staining the carpet. 

After a full minute, I turned to Trevor. 

“Are you alright?” I asked with concern, and he nodded.

“He really had me there…” Trevor gasped, rubbing his neck. 

“I knew we should have double checked if they were actually dead,” I sighed, and Trevor put a hand on my shoulder. 

“No worries, babe, if we play this right, we’ll be able to move on from this,” he gestured at the lookalike’s corpse.

“Of course, we’ve managed to get this far after all,” I smiled, gently pulling Trevor into a soft and tender kiss.",2,1771265135.0,shortscarystories,2,1.0,False

I took it apart and can't figure out how to get water moving through. Priced out some parts, and it would end up half the cost of new unless I guess right on parts the first time...let alone the high chance I wreck something else in repair. Strangely nobody services Breville in my city , so it's a brick basically.

I loved this machine, it did what I need....and I don't think I even tapped it's potential.

So I got a new one yesterday , exact same model. Up until now , I go to my local roaster and have them grind the beans to their espresso setting for the roast in question. I get a small bag every 1-2 weeks and that's done the trick. I'm starting to think it might be fun to grind my own beans. I have an old Baratza Encore which probably also needs service. It's fine for filter but even after doing the modifications for more fine grinds ... it's really only going to cut it for Filtered coffee.

So researching grinders for the last few days ... and I just don't know what the heck to get.

I rarely drink a straight espresso , always cappucino sized and my wife enjoys lattes. Most days I make only 1 , on weekends we might make 4 drinks in a day. Every blue moon we might have some company and end up making a dozen or so drinks in a day.

I am considering the DF64 Gen2 , at around $500 CAD. I am leaning this way after researching , but just not sure if I've been thorough enough for this price range. I feel like this would be the max spend I'd want to do at this point. Also thinking because I'm doing 99% milk based coffee drinks that I wouldn't necessary benefit from some super high end grinder let alone wanting to fork out all that cash.

Should I be considering something else at this price point or lower? Or should I just keep getting it ground at the roaster?",2,1771264931.0,espresso,7,1.0,False

I upgraded from a Lelit Williams, which I have had for a few years. I was actually quite happy with it, but a little annoyed that it could not be adjusted in small enough steps. In addition, I would like a GBW.

So far, the Mini G seems to be a great grinder. I hit a great shot on the third attempt The grinder itself oozes quality. The coffee grounds are fluffy and without clumps. The weight is very precise. The taste is good. Everything is good.

However, the manual is really not very in-depth and several topics are not mentioned at all - for example, what several of the grinder's settings do, including wifi. I accidentally came across a video that mentioned a Mazzer app. Otherwise, I had no idea that you needed an app. However, it also seems to be a pretty poor app. I have not managed to get the grinder on my local wifi yet.

When setting the grinder to grind finer or coarser, I find it difficult to do it precisely, as the mechanism is tight. Do you have any good tips for making this process better with a Mazzer Mini?

When in portafilter mode for grinding, is there anyway you can make it not grind when you put the portafilter in? For when you have to purge og change grind settings?

Those of you who have had the grinder for a while - do you have any other good tips?",1,1771264904.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I'm pretty new to coloring/coloring books, but have been making art since forever so I have a lot of supplies already. I did recently get some Ohuhu markers which are living on my desk in my studio space, but I tend to color on the couch in front of the tv.

Currently my living room is drowing in coloring supplies.

If you use more than one medium in your books, how do you store/transport it? Especially with the large alcohol marker sets. Do you have a designated spot you color and keep everything near by? Or pick out the colors/materials before you start each page? 

I love all the different techniques and patterns I see people doing and want to learn/try them all but there has to be a better option than covering my coffee table in multiple bags of markers and pencils and who knows what else!

I (17M) have always been underweight, which has affected my self-esteem and made my teenage years difficult. I am 178 cm and 53 kg, which is an improvement from two months ago, when I decided to finally lock in yk. 

My younger brother (15) is in worse condition. He is 179 cm and 48 kg and often passes out in class.

Today, my mom suggested switching from shakes to pancakes to make it easier to consume calories. I agreed. She then asked if I could make pancakes for my brother every morning as well. I said he would need to wake up at 5 am like me so we could do it together, which started an argument. She said I was selfish for not just making them for him since I was already cooking.

I tried to explain that it was unfair for me to wake up early and take responsibility for both of us. If he joined me, we could build the same routine and improve together instead of me being forced to do everything.

The argument got real heated real fast. My mom kept interrupting me, calling me selfish and saying I only help if I get something in return. Eventually, she said it wouldn’t work because my brother has sleep issues, and I accepted that.

When I tried to accept her proposal, she began yelling about how I was a failure, egotistical, and a disappointment for having her ""write an essay and draw"" that for me so I could understand her point. She specifically said that she failed me as a mom and that I turned a horrible person. She also said that I mean nothing to my brother and that if I wouldn't she would do everything for him (idk if this makes sense cuz im translating this in my head from portuguese).

She compared me to my dad, who wakes up early to make her coffee without expecting anything back, and said I meant nothing to my brother, while she would always do everything for him. Conversation ends.

My whole family and guests were present during the whole escalation. 

So it's not really that I didn't want to share food it's that I didn't want to do all the effort specifically for weight gain, and didn't want it to become another daily choir. I'm also very protective about my calorie shakes which have caused past arguments when family members would drink them after I asked them not to💀💀 Even tho I would make it for them if they asked. They stopped drinking it once my calorie shakes got too disgusting for them because the goal is actually gaining weight.

I, however, currently have a cold. Yes, my nose is red. No, I am not auditioning to lead Santa’s sleigh. Yes, I’m drinking so much tea that my coffee addiction is side-eyeing me from the corner like, *“Oh, so this is how it is?”*

Anyway.

Once again, I am bravely leaving my introvert cave (cozy, affordable rent, drama-free, excellent Wi-Fi) to find cool humans who enjoy:

* **Deep conversations** that start normally and somehow end with “but what is reality?”
* **Random daily updates** like “you will NOT believe what happened at the store today.”
* **Book recommendations** (fantasy romance especially)
* **Occasional voice calls to vent**, because sometimes typing “I’m fine” is not enough

I’m from Hungary 🇭🇺, so the European time zone is ideal. If you’re elsewhere but survive on caffeine and questionable life choices, we can negotiate.

I mostly use Discord (which I know how to operate… mostly… don’t test me under pressure).

And very important: if we don’t click? Totally fine, we part ways like mature adults.

So say hi, and let's see if we ever want to meet up in real life, or if it's more like stay virtual forever. FYI: If you’re from any Scandinavian country, bonus points — partly because I plan to invade… I mean, *visit*… this year, and could use a local to make sure I don’t accidentally adopt a moose or get lost in IKEA forever.

I have been stressed out by the job search after recently graduating. But nothing seems to come off of it. 
My family tries to be supportive but in return only makes me feel worse because by now the suggestions sound like I should just take about anything I can get. Like, not even something for what I have studied but basically do an apprenticeship instead.
All I talk about with them anymore is the job search. I know I am incredibly lucky to have such a supportive family. But I am tired of it. I am tired of having all the interactions be about this.

On top of that I recently met a girl and she seems really sweet and kind. However, she doesn't share much. She does answer the questions I have but without much depth. It is hard to build a connection when the depth is shallow. Also, I obviously don't want to just randomly ask her deep questions either. So, I am left wondering what is going on and how I can have a good conversation with her. I am especially worried about the date we are about to have because all the superficial stuff like ""what do you like to do in your free time?"", ""what do you study?"" etc. we seem to have already chatted about. So, I am a bit clueless what to ask and talk about with her.
Also, by now I am overthinking a bit what I should wear to our coffee date.

But what made my day really annoying was the interaction with a good friend.
Admittedly, I have been leaning on her a bit too much with my dating stuff recently. She told me two days ago how she is tired of it and said that we should talk about other things instead. So, since that is recently the thing that had me most anxious, I lost a huge outlet there.
Now, today we called and talked a bit. Recently it has become a habit that at some point during our conversations she would drift off. She would start to not be mentally there anymore. She is either on TikTok then or the audible notification sounds indicate that her boyfriend is texting her. Instead of just hanging out she then tries to somehow still stay in the conversation while chatting with him. 
It just gets so frustrating. I get wanting to spend a lot of time with your partner but I just find it really disrespectful to basically have a call that was meant for us to talk and share as friends turn into this background noise for the thing she actually wants to do.
And the issue is, this isn't the first time this happened either. Over the past few months I can't really remember a single time where this hasn't occured.

I did put on my big boy pants for once and told her about how I felt. But now I am left with is what I feel like are excuses. I know she is just trying to explain to me so I can understand. But the sorry feels so hollow if it is followed by her explaining why she did what she did. 
Like, I get it but your behavior hurt me! I don't want you to explain to me how you don't want your boyfriend to think you prioritize another guy just because you don't instantly reply to him while hanging out (online might I add) with a male friend. I want you to acknowledge my feelings!

I don't know what it is with today but I am seriously considering calling it a day even though it isn't even 7 pm yet.
I am exhausted. I feel sad and upset. I am barely preventing breaking down to cry. And the friends I could talk with are busy.

Last week many people messaged me with ideas, and the biggest concern was that it’s hard to find events. Especially if you have kids or other responsibilities and are not terminally online.

People also want ways to help between protests, but the constant flood of news and events makes it overwhelming to find things to do.

While many events center around Democrats many are non political and just a place to meet for a fun event and chat afterwards. We meet and attend the event. Then hang out at a bookstore, library,  coffee shop, or winery afterwards to chat.

I didn’t coordinate with any organizers to post this. I’m just an angry dad trying to make it easier for people to take the first step in getting out in Des Moines to help.

I know I'm missing events for food pantries and other fun volunteer oppurtunities. If you know of an event open to the public please let me know. If you’re an organizer and want your event removed, I’ll do that quietly. I’m not affiliated with any of these groups beyond attending some of their events.

I’ve had some relative success in meeting some folks from Reddit, for the purposes of cheating on our spouses, but the last year has been an absolute disaster, and I can’t seem to pinpoint what shifted the tide.

I’m very judicious when it comes to meeting a pAP in person. The vibe over chat has to be right, and I need to validate certain things about their identity, both for my safety and to gauge whether meeting in person is worth the risk. That’s to say: I don’t meet just anyone.

But in the past year I’ve had the worst luck. I’ve met several men who have played right in my face. We’ve met up in person and had (what I would consider) lovely coffee dates (or even sex dates!) and they’ve either ghosted, faded, or lied about their intentions. One man ghosted after two hotel dates. He reached out about setting up a third, and when I gave him my availability, he simply never responded and faded away. His Telegram account is still active and I see his status change from time to time. Not a peep.

This past week I met someone for coffee after chatting for a few weeks and we had a great time. We debriefed after and both expressed we wanted to meet up again. He went silent for a couple days and I figured he just got busy, but I woke up to our chat history deleted on Telegram. No explanation. Just gone.

I understand that much of this is par for the course when you’re engaging with cheaters. Karma and all that. Not to bash our collective group, but if people were skilled at emotional intelligence, they may not be seeking an affair at all. But I like to think I’m a conscientious person who treats people kindly. I engage with care and intention. I’m transparent, communicative, and reliable. If things aren’t working for me or I need to duck out for some reason, I’m considerate enough to send a quick message saying as much.

So what gives? Are we losing any sense of manners in an increasingly digitally anonymous world? Am I choosing the wrong people? Have I suddenly become unfuckable and invisible (I did turn 40 this past year)? Is this the whiniest post you’ve read on this sub in a while?",5,1771264071.0,adultery,7,0.67,False

By the time I get to my desk, she jumps on my lap and snuggles in for a day of typing and Zoom calls. 

This dog like behavior is actually endearing. Except it’s every single day. She doesn’t understand weekends. And sure as hell doesn’t understand President’s Day, or any other holiday. Her meowing and clawing in the mornings is becoming increasingly violent. 

Dear reader, I know this is a stupid ask, but my wife is getting really fed up with this behavior. Any ideas on how I can break this pattern? I was thinking of changing the food disposal times, so align them in a way (not sure how) to distract them. That still won’t let me sleep in, but I’m at my wits end. 

The situation is noticeably worse if our daughter has come into our bedroom - sleeping between us - due to a nightmare or whatever. In those situations, this cat dog is even more annoying. Help!",1,1771264020.0,Catbehavior,2,1.0,False

Look, we all have the same 24 hours. But some people seem to get three times more done while still having time to hit the gym, read, and not feel like a burnt-out zombie. Meanwhile, you're scrolling through your phone at 11 PM wondering where the hell the day went.

I spent months researching this, diving into books on productivity, neuroscience podcasts, and YouTube deep dives from people who actually crack the code on time. Turns out, the problem isn't that you don't have enough time. It's that your day is designed like shit. Most of us are living reactively, letting time happen TO us instead of designing it intentionally. And yeah, our biology, dopamine-hungry brains, and a system that glorifies ""busy"" don't help. But here's the good news: once you understand how time actually works psychologically, you can engineer your day to feel way longer and more productive.

## Step 1: Stop Measuring Time in Hours, Start Measuring in Energy

Here's what nobody tells you: Time is not the currency. Energy is.

You could have 8 hours to work, but if you're dragging your ass through all of it with zero focus, those 8 hours are useless. Cal Newport talks about this in *Deep Work*, this idea that the quality of your attention matters way more than the quantity of hours. One hour of deep, focused work beats 5 hours of distracted half-assing any day.

Design your day around your energy peaks. Most people have 2-3 energy peaks throughout the day. For most, it's morning (right after waking up), late morning (10 AM-12 PM), and sometimes early evening. Figure out when YOUR energy is highest and block those times for your hardest, most important work. Don't waste your peak energy on emails or meetings. Use it for deep work that actually moves the needle.

Track your energy for a week. Notice when you feel sharp versus when you feel like a potato. Then structure your day accordingly.

## Step 2: Time Block Like Your Life Depends on It

If your calendar looks like a blank canvas with random shit scattered everywhere, you're already losing. Time blocking is the difference between feeling like you have 10 hours versus feeling like you have 30.

Elon Musk famously breaks his day into 5-minute blocks. Now, you don't have to go that extreme, but the concept is solid: assign every hour of your day a job. Don't just say ""I'll work in the morning."" Say ""9-11 AM: deep work on project X. 11-11:30 AM: emails. 11:30 AM-12 PM: quick workout.""

When every block has a purpose, you eliminate decision fatigue (which drains your energy), and you stop wasting time wondering ""what should I do next?""

Pro tip: Use Google Calendar or Notion and literally block out your entire day the night before. Treat those blocks like non-negotiable appointments with yourself.

## Step 3: Kill the Illusion of Multitasking

Multitasking is a lie your brain tells you to feel productive while actually getting nothing done. When you think you're multitasking, you're really just task-switching, and every switch costs you time and mental energy.

Research from Stanford shows that people who multitask are actually LESS productive than people who focus on one thing at a time. Your brain needs time to get into flow state, and every time you switch tasks, you're yanking yourself out of it.

Single-task everything. When you're working, work. When you're eating, eat. When you're scrolling, own it and scroll (but time-box it). Stop trying to do five things at once. You'll feel like you have way more time because you're actually finishing things instead of juggling incomplete tasks all day.

Check out *Indistractable* by Nir Eyal. This book breaks down the psychology of distraction and gives you a blueprint for designing your environment so you can actually focus. It's packed with research on how our brains get hijacked and how to take control back.

If you want a more effortless way to absorb these concepts without carving out reading time, there's an AI learning app called BeFreed that's been surprisingly useful. You can set a specific goal like ""I want to design my day better as someone who gets easily distracted"" and it generates personalized audio content from productivity books, research papers, and expert insights. You can choose between quick 10-minute summaries or 40-minute deep dives with examples, and customize the voice, it even has this smoky, conversational style that makes learning feel less like work. The app also builds you an adaptive learning plan based on your unique struggles and adjusts as you go. Founded by Columbia alumni and AI experts from Google, it's a solid replacement for mindless scrolling if you're trying to grow without the guilt.

## Step 4: Batch Your Tiny Tasks into One Block

Emails. Messages. Quick calls. Social media checks. These little tasks feel harmless, but they're time vampires. Every time you check your phone or respond to a Slack message, you're breaking your flow and losing 10-20 minutes of productivity even if the task only took 2 minutes.

Batch all your small tasks into one or two designated time blocks. For example, check emails only at 11 AM and 4 PM. Respond to messages in one 30-minute window. Batch your errands for one afternoon instead of spreading them throughout the week.

This is straight out of Tim Ferriss' *The 4-Hour Workweek*. He talks about batching as one of the ultimate time hacks. When you batch similar tasks together, your brain doesn't have to keep switching gears, and you get through them way faster.

## Step 5: Use the 80/20 Rule to Cut the Bullshit

The Pareto Principle says that 80% of your results come from 20% of your efforts. Which means 80% of what you're doing is probably not moving the needle.

Audit your to-do list. What tasks actually matter? What tasks are just busy work that makes you feel productive but doesn't actually get you closer to your goals?

Cut or delegate everything that's not in the top 20%. If it's not essential, it doesn't deserve space in your day. This is harsh, but necessary. Most people fill their days with low-impact tasks because they're easier and feel productive. But they're not. Focus on the 20% that matters and watch how much more time you suddenly have.

## Step 6: Build in ""White Space"" (Yes, Doing Nothing is Productive)

Here's the paradox: the more you cram into your day, the less time you feel like you have. When your calendar is packed back-to-back, time feels like it's flying by in a blur.

Build in white space. These are intentional breaks with nothing scheduled. No tasks, no obligations, just breathing room. Go for a walk. Sit and think. Stare at the wall if you want.

Research shows that our brains need downtime to process information, consolidate memories, and come up with creative ideas. The best ideas don't come when you're grinding. They come when you're in the shower, on a walk, or zoning out.

Try the Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes work, 5 minutes break) or work in 90-minute cycles with 15-minute breaks. Apps like Forest or Focus@Will can help you stay locked in during work blocks and remind you to actually take breaks.

## Step 7: Front-Load Your Day (Win the Morning, Win the Day)

If you start your day scrolling Instagram or checking emails, you've already lost. The first hour of your day sets the tone for everything else.

Front-load your hardest, most important task first. Tim Ferriss, Jocko Willink, and pretty much every high-performer swears by this. Get your big win done early. Once that's checked off, everything else feels easier, and you've already made progress before most people even start their day.

Your willpower is highest in the morning. Don't waste it on bullshit. Use it on the thing that actually matters.

## Step 8: Protect Your Time Like a Bouncer at a Club

People will try to steal your time. Meetings that could've been emails. Random requests. Drama that's not your problem. Learn to say no.

Warren Buffett once said, ""The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything.""

Set boundaries. Block your deep work hours and don't let anyone touch them. Turn off notifications. Put your phone in another room. Treat your time like it's the most valuable resource you have, because it is.

## Step 9: End Your Day with Intention

Most people's days just kind of end. They work until they're too tired, then zombie-scroll until they pass out. That's why time feels like it disappears.

End your day intentionally. Spend 10 minutes reviewing what you accomplished, what you didn't, and what tomorrow's priorities are. Write it down. This does two things: it gives you closure on today (which helps your brain relax), and it primes your brain for tomorrow so you wake up ready to go.

Journaling apps like Day One or even just a Notes app work great for this. Make it a non-negotiable part of your evening routine.

## Step 10: Realize That Perception of Time is Flexible

Here's the mind-bender: time is subjective. When you're bored or doing repetitive tasks, time drags. When you're engaged, learning, or in flow, time flies. But here's the twist, when you look back on your day, days filled with variety and novelty feel longer in your memory than monotonous days.

Break up your routine. Learn something new. Try a different coffee shop. Take a different route home. Your brain encodes new experiences differently, which makes your days feel fuller and richer when you look back.

This is why time felt slower as a kid. Everything was new. As adults, we fall into routines and time blurs together. Inject novelty into your life and watch how much longer your weeks feel.

Hx of depression, inattentive-type ADHD, insomnia, low vit D & low ferritin (was 13, currently up to 23). Husband and I have been TTC for a little over a year. Current medications: Vyvanse 50mg daily, Prozac 20mg daily, prenatal vitamin, magnesium glycinate at bedtime, vit D & iron supplements every other day. I also recently began taking 12.5mg seroquel nightly as I have suffered with insomnia for years. Seroquel is the first med that has helped me fall and \*stay\* asleep.

For example: I can go to bed at 8:30pm, sleep up to 12 hours, and still wake up exhausted. I’ll get up, take my vyvanse and drink coffee/eat breakfast, and want to nap again. I do work nights in an ICU, so I have the flipping of schedules & stressful job working against me. However, I’ve worked the same job for the past 5 years so I don’t think it’s that, either?

I usually gate keep but today I am feeling generous. I know Sigmund Freud said that, ""if you care about future generations when you're older you are at the appropriate maturity for your age"" or something like that. Perhaps since I am married and have been in a relationship for 17 years now and I am almost 39 (almost 40) I don't feel the need to gate keep anymore because I no longer need to worry about being ""out there"" among other women. So now I pass the torch onto you guys so you can benefit from my wisdom.

This will be in three parts. First one is general tips (young women especially need to hear), second one is what I have been doing over the years, third is what I do now and why (the juicy tea)

I have had ZERO work done. No fillers, botox, surgeries, hyaluronic fillers. I haven't even gotten a spa or salon treatment once in my life.

\---------------------------General tips---------------------------

\#1 95-98% of skincare is not worth your time. It is either too expensive for what you get, does not have enough research to back it up, or doesn't actually penetrate the top layer of the skin (gets to the deeper layers) + it isn't something you actually need. If you have sensitive skin and you use an acid now your skin is inflamed so then you use something to calm it down when all you needed to do is stop using the acid.

\#2 Skincare is the last thing you should try to improve your skin. If your gut, nutrition, sleep, stress level, and other things are in ill repair then no skincare product is going to help you. Inside first. I highly recommend you get your blood tested for all vitamins / minerals two times a year to make sure you have no deficiencies. Almost all skin and health issues can lead to starting with a vitamin deficiency. Example: you have dark under eye circles, this could mean you are deficient in iron or folate or both, no cream is going to fix that until you get your iron or folate up to normal levels.

\#3 15 step skincare, morning sheds, etc (similar to #1) it's all BS. They are all just trying to sell you things and you keep falling for it.

\#4 If it works for you, don't stop until it doesn't. Don't try something new, why ""fix"" something that doesn't need fixing? If you feel the need to replace something that is already working with something new, the problem is actually either FOMO, a shopping addiction, or dopamine issues, your brain is your first priority (get off Tiktok)

\#5 Stop trying to ""stop aging"" that is never going to happen. Yes I look much younger than my age but I still look older than 18. You're never going to remain looking 18 forever. Have realistic goals. It's very possible to look 10-15 years younger than your age but you're never gonna be 18 forever.

\#6 Beauty draws them in, your personality is what keeps you around. In the long run, who you are is always more important.

\#7 Topical and supplemental collagen is BS. Collagen will not penetrate the top or deep layers of the skin so it is useless as a topical. Oral / supplemental collagen will provide you with some protein, but it is an incomplete protein so it will not repair / rebuild muscle or skin. Instead, take amino acids first thing in the morning that has ALL essential amino acids. I recommend ""Perfect Aminos""

\-----------------What I have been doing over the years-----------------

\---The Early years (16-23) - Not a lot. I had mild acne and would use acid face washes, Proactive, and sunscreen everyday. I started working at GNC when I was 19 and started getting into supplements which included things for beauty, I can't remember what I took then. I tried some Japanese brightening lotions for a hot minute as well as Japanese beauty candy containing collagen, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin c (worked amazing, made me so pink and glowing)

\---My 20s (23-29) - I was using a lot of Estee Lauder skincare during this time, the Night Repair, neck lotion, and eye cream as well as taking collagen, vitamin c, biotin, and a few other things

\---The Years Before today (29-38) - I experimented and researched hundreds of things during this time to refine what I now know today. There was so much during this time that I don't even remember 90% of it. The only thing I do the same from this era that I still do is take many of the same supplements.

\---------------------------What I do now---------------------------

\#1. Weekly micro needling at home - This is one of the truly proven things you can do for aging that works. Much like how you damage your muscles to grow them and like how moving your body slightly traumatizes your bones to remain strong, small amounts of damage to the body is what keeps you healthy and resilient. There is nothing that traumatizes the skin on a regular basis that is in the deeper layers of the skin therefore the body is not constantly repairing it. When you micro needle, your body then uses its resources to repair micro damage done to the deeper layers of the skin creating microscopic scars that toughen and strengthen the skin. DO NOT use a rolling micro needling device. This is literally the worst thing you can do for your skin. As the needles roll out, they are pushing away from the pierced sight and ripping out. Think of it like you shoveling dirt at an angle, the hole is thicker than the shovel. I use a manual press style micro needling tool where the only thing that is going on is you pierce and pull out in the exact same spot so the only damage truly going on is very small holes. I micro needle my face (eyelids included at 0.25mm) and neck once a week as well as my decolletage, hands, and forearms once a month (deeper piercing). To avoid infection I make sure to wash the skin and then apply a mixture of rubbing alcohol with some tea tree oil in it. Afterward I wash my face and apply the mixture again. The tool itself I wash with soap, then dunk in bleach water, then finish with spraying with alcohol. There is always a risk doing it at home or in a clinic (infection). I have been doing it for 2 years with no problems.

\#2 The Skincare - Most skincare is not truly helping because it is not penetrating the deeper layers of the skin it just sits on top of the top layer. It doesn't make it useless, it's just repairing far less than you think. Wrinkles and fine lines run deeper than the surface layer. I make my own serum using beta glucan powder. This holds water and plumps the skin much better than hyaluronic acid because it actually goes into the deeper layers of the skin, hyaluronic acid only works on the surface level. I use beta glucan all over my face, neck and hands (twice a day). I use a 0.5% trentinoin from Musley all over my face and neck (once at night). Trentinoin is proven stronger than retinol. I use spf 50 all over ANY skin showing that day and wear it all day (reapplication all day). I use Allies of Skin's Multi Peptide in my chin fold (under lips) and around my eyes for extra fine line / wrinkle support the Trentinoin isn't giving. I use Volufiline mixed into my lip cream and mixed into the Allies of Skin Multi Peptide. Volufiline works by engorging fat tissue to expand and become larger, this will not make anything huge, rather, it will fill out the area with about 5-10% more volume after doing it for 6+ months. I use Cle de Peau's Lip Serum (twice a day). I wash my face with bar soap (seriously). I use Lancome's Bi-Facial make-up remover and don't wash my face at night. Over washing your face is what is aging you and giving you acne. Lastly, I use Strivectin's TL Advanced Tightening Neck Cream Plus on my neck, decolletage, and face twice a day. So, four products on the face (beta glucan, sunscreen, trentinoin, Strivectin), four on the eyes (beta glucan, trentinoin, peptide, volufiline), three on the lips (beta glucan, lip serum, volufiline) and four on the neck (beta glucan, trentinoin, Strivectin, sunscreen) THAT'S IT! No sheet masks, 10 step, 15 step. Simplicity and the best of what your skin needs is all you need.

\#3 Exercising bone & muscle in the face - You ever see one of those posts of a much older woman (60s, 70s, or 80s) that has an amazing body like they're 30 but their face shows their age? Here is the disconnect: they haven't been micro damaging the bone and muscle in their face like they have been with their body. As I said, the body grows through small amounts of damage to it. ""He's ripped"" literally comes from the knowledge that the muscle rips & tears and repairs itself to get bigger. As we know, muscle on the body = toned & firm. You can do the same to your face as well. So every other day I do 10-15 facial yoga exercises to cover every muscle in my face and neck. Then to make sure the fascia in my face remains bouncy every other day (opposing day to the facial yoga) I do gua sha all over my face and neck. This contours, fills, and keeps your face structured nice and tight, we don't neglect the muscles in our body, but we do with the face. Gua sha and facial yoga also puts strain on the bone of your face keeping your muscle tighter and more attached to your skull leading to less sagging skin.

\#4 Supplements (beauty related) - I take, ""Perfect Aminos"" with my coffee first thing in the morning, in the middle of my morning workout, and before I go to bed, this is the equivalent of three servings of chicken for only 3 calories. Complete amino acids are far more effective at building collagen and skin than taking a collagen supplement. I take a womens probiotic first thing in the morning with my coffee and one before bed, this keeps my gut and skin flora healthy (fights off acne). Lastly, all of these supplements I take throughout the day with food. 400 mg of hyaluronic acid for skin plumpness. Methylated multivitamin (10x) for over all health, including skin. Sea buckthorn oil for softness and elasticity. Silica for building bone, collagen, and elastin. Rosemary for hair growth. Nettle for hair growth. Turmeric for detoxification. MSM to build collagen and elastin. NAD+ for circulation leading to better skin. CoQ10 for circulation leading to better skin. Chlorophyll for detoxification (+ prevents body odor). Fisetin a general anti-aging. Lastly, HMB for delaying muscle degeneration (preserves face muscles too).

\#5 Candylipz - To maintain volume, I do Candylipz pumping twice a day. This works through exercising and traumatizing the muscles in your lips to make them more plump.

\#6 The Other Stuff - Daily I use the ""Cutis"" by Shawana Vali, this has been recent, it is new and so far I like it, it has been helping with the tiny bit of jowls I have been developing. I get 8 hours of sleep every night. I eat a keto diet. I do a 16 hour fast everyday. I lift heavy weights. I did not have children. I drink plenty of water and I do everything I can to be calm and stress-free.

In my 20's I was into weight training and cardio with free weights and as a usual 20yr old I could eat and drink anything I wanted and maintain 180 - 190 lbs body weight. 



In my 30's I was normally in the gym 4 days a week mostly on the elliptical and some weights using gym machines and some free weights for about 30 - 40 minutes a day. Work started to pick up lots of travel, which lead to bad eating and alcohol drinking. Started to pack on lbs and was normally about 210.

  
Life since 2020 and past 2 years. Covid years brought on serious weight and ballooned to 230 and alcohol was out of control. Built a home gym, Stationary Bike, Treadmill, Free weights up to 90lbs, and 100% relied on Beachbody programs. Covid also brought on serious alcohol use and other bad eating habits. I actually became fairly muscular, but alcohol and bad habits kept it from being sustainable. 

Last year I did keto diet for 5 months and lost weight down to 207 lbs with no workouts what-so-ever. Alcohol was still a factor though and drove depression, anxiety, lack of motivation, etc. But I was happy with the weight loss just had no energy. 

Past four months I've given up alcohol (got into recovery programs), started to eat well just haven't made the time for working out mostly because I'm over analyzing how to get started. Someone just made a post about this on this subreddit in the past week actually. 

  
My nutrition now is better, but I have a bad habit of snacking late at night from 9pm - 12am (I know for a fact this has to stop), also working on getting into better sleep habits because I'm only getting about 5 - 6 hours. 

  
Breakfast:  1 or 2 eggs, sausage/bacon, fruit (apples, grapes), low-fat low sugar yogurt, coffee.

Lunch: Dinner leftovers, lunch meat sandwich, fruit or carrots. Premade protein shake from Costco.

Midday Snack: Fruit or overnight oats (oats, almond milk, Greek yogurt, honey.

Dinner: My wife and I cook at home 5 days a week and these are healthy meals focused on a protein, veggie, carb. 

I do not eat fast food, when I do go out (Friday and Saturday) its normally steak, fish, hamburgers, etc but I understand where the hidden bad nutrition is and try not to choose those items.

  
I still have the home gym as mentioned above and subscribed to Bodi (Beachbody), the programs I think are good tired of following someone on a screen telling what to do and sometimes the pace on free weights too fast for me.",1,1771263759.0,workout,7,1.0,False

This game, and all of its follow-ups, allowed my mind to create some peaceful space, where all the strenuous thoughts were left aside in favor of cooking, serving and delicious-ing in an increasingly faster pace and on the hunt for perfect restaurant days. In such fun and challenging moments, my mind could finally hit the pause button of the incessant chaos and could finally receive some necessary rest.

The game series has not only become a restful haven for my mind, but it also allowed me to expand my curiosity, interest and bravery in trying out new flavors and dishes, something that I have had a hard time with all of my younger life. Thanks to CSD I have dared to try sushi, ramen, bibimbap, cannoli, pulled pork sandwich and roasted cauliflower with nuts, among other dishes. I have dared to cook bananas foster flambé, saucy aubergines with parmesan, sauerkraut with sausages, pasta with pesto and spinach, to name a few. I have learned about ube ice cream, egg drop soup and chicken kiev. This game has taken me to culinary journeys I never thought I'd experience in my life.

Every time I go to a restaurant with my partner and we try new foods, I always try to look for dishes I have cooked in game but never tried live. Due to my excitement and my mentioning of the series in more ways than one, and lacking official clothing merch, my partner made me a t-shirt with a modified logo that I'm also planning to add to my tattoos in the future. Because it's nice having good reminders nearby :)

I want to thank David and the whole crew of Vertigo Gaming Inc. for having gifted me endless hours of replayable fun, food inspiration and a handy load of swearing like a pirate when trying to gain the Gold on the last level of Contrast Coffee :) You guys rock. Thank you!

As we’re approaching exam time, I wanted to share a piece of information with you all that I recently stumbled across, but first wanted to independently confirm. I am well aware that we are in a stage of the game where giving you bad information could trip a lot of you up.  I wanted to make sure I got this thing right before sharing anything that is likely to impact your performance.

I’ve had the chance to run this experiment on myself. I feel as good as I reasonably can that I’m providing you with helpful information.

 

A little over a week ago, I came across this study in the medical academic journal “Cell.”  [https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)01373-X](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)01373-X)  This was posted at the end of December 2025, so it’s very recent literature. What this study says in a nutshell, is that stimulant-based ADHD medications (like Concerta and Adderall) operate in the brain by stimulating the parts of the brain that make you feel good when you do something exciting. ADHD brains tend to be able to focus on stuff they find interesting, but be unable to do anything they find boring. The medication allows you to hold your focus for longer because your brain is being falsely rewarded for doing things that it would otherwise find boring.

This is a tremendously effective way to help people sit through a k-12 school day, or work in an office because it gives the brain an incentive to do boring things. It lets you stay present during your boring office job. This is tremendously useful.

Very critically, the medications do NOT stimulate the neural pathways pertaining to the quality of focus. As useful as these medications are in an office or school environment, the Bar Exam is a different animal which also requires depth of focus. It’s useful to be able to generally focus for longer, BUT THE MEDICATIONS ARE NOT DEEPENING OR INTENSIFYING YOUR ABILITY TO FOCUS.

This is a very authoritative study: 6,000 child brain scans showing the same thing, and then the results were repeated in adult brain scans. We can safely say that this is how ADHD stimulant medications operate in the human brain.

 

Mental presence versus depth of focus is a very important distinction. Your ADHD meds are making your brain excited that it’s standing in front of a painting, but it’s not improving your ability to look more closely at the painting. In order to activate the attention pathways, we need more of something called “norepinephrine.” I personally did not need to be more interested in the law. I already find the law extremely interesting. I love what I do, so the Concerta wasn’t providing me with a useful effect.

There are two supplements I’ve started taking to enhance actual focus, and I have experienced a huge increase in both my essay performance and multiple choice performance as a result.

I’ve begun taking 500mg of L-Tyrosine and 200mg of L-Theanine once per day in place of my 36mg Concerta. As a result, I experienced a 5-ish minute reduction in my essay speeds (while maintaining accuracy of analysis) and a jump from 63% MCQ accuracy up to 85% accuracy within the last week. 

I highly recommend going to the Biohacker subreddit to read up on this stuff, or even just starting a conversation with ChatGPT about L-Tyrosine and L-Theanine to find information you find reliable.

 

The L-Tyrosine is a precursor to the dopamine and norepinephrine you need to focus. The L-Theanine has a mood stabilizing and calming effect.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1o2rht8/dude\_ltyrosine\_wtf/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1o2rht8/dude_ltyrosine_wtf/)  [https://www.reddit.com/answers/9c565546-bc89-4e88-bf68-5f1a55d307d9/?q=l+tyrosine+adhd&source=SERP&upstreamCID=dd85c489-ff18-4a51-819c-97a9b8c60b7f&upstreamIID=70dff5f9-8c62-41fa-a2b2-7a46a3a0bc5b&upstreamQ=l-tyrosine+for+adhd&upstreamQID=c7b47c0f-5a35-4bf9-abf6-669422b23321](https://www.reddit.com/answers/9c565546-bc89-4e88-bf68-5f1a55d307d9/?q=l+tyrosine+adhd&source=SERP&upstreamCID=dd85c489-ff18-4a51-819c-97a9b8c60b7f&upstreamIID=70dff5f9-8c62-41fa-a2b2-7a46a3a0bc5b&upstreamQ=l-tyrosine+for+adhd&upstreamQID=c7b47c0f-5a35-4bf9-abf6-669422b23321)



If you decide to take your stim meds along with the L-tyrosine and L-Theanine, you might find yourself jittery. It seems like L-tyrosine makes you a lot more sensitive to stimulants (?).  I was basically impervious to stimulants before but I can barely drink 2 cups of coffee without feeling jumpy now.

**TL;DR: An authoritative medical study has established that ADHD meds like Concerta and Adderall don’t actually improve your ability to focus. I started taking L-Tyrosine and L-Theanine because they create chemicals that do improve the quality of your focus and have experienced a massive improvement in my test performance.**",2,1771263692.0,GoatBarPrep,2,1.0,False

1r6g94v,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensDiscipline/comments/1r6g94v/sciencebased_morning_routines_what_dr_mike/,Science-Based Morning Routines: What Dr. Mike Israetel's Research Reveals About REAL Productivity,"So I spent way too much time studying Mike Israetel's content. Like an embarrassing amount. And here's what hit me: most of us are approaching mornings completely backwards.

We've been fed this toxic narrative that you need to wake up at 4am, meditate for an hour, do yoga, journal, read, workout, meal prep, and somehow still have energy left for your actual life. It's exhausting just thinking about it. Dr. Mike (PhD in exercise science, professor, bodybuilder) takes a different approach that's honestly refreshing as hell.

The reality is your biology doesn't care about Gary Vee's morning routine. Your cortisol peaks naturally in the morning regardless of whether you're productive or scrolling TikTok. The difference is how you leverage that state.

Here's what actually works:

**1. Stop fighting your natural rhythms**

Mike's huge on this. If you're not a morning person, stop torturing yourself trying to become one. Some people's circadian rhythms are just wired differently, backed by actual genetics research. The chronotype stuff is real. Work with your body instead of against it.

But here's the catch, if you ARE gonna do mornings, do them right. That means aligning high intensity cognitive work or training with your peak cortisol window (roughly 30-60 minutes after waking). Not checking emails. Not scrolling. REAL work.

**2. Prioritize what actually moves the needle**

Mike talks about this in his training philosophy but it applies everywhere. Most morning routines are packed with low ROI activities that make you feel productive without actually being productive. It's self-deception.

Instead, identify the ONE thing that if completed would make your day a success. Do that first. Everything else is negotiable. This is basically the compound effect but applied daily. [Atomic Habits](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_7) by James Clear breaks this down perfectly (it's sold over 15 million copies for a reason). Clear's a behavior change expert and the book is legitimately life changing if you actually apply it. The concept of habit stacking alone is worth the read. This is the best habit formation book I've ever encountered.

**3. Fuel properly or suffer**

Mike's pretty blunt about nutrition. You can't out-discipline a shit diet, especially in the morning when your glycogen is depleted. If you're doing fasted cardio or skipping breakfast because some influencer said so, you're probably sabotaging your performance.

Get quality protein and carbs in relatively quickly unless you have specific reasons not to. Your brain runs on glucose. Feed it. The whole ""fasted state"" thing has been wildly overhyped for most people's goals.

For tracking this properly, I've been using Cronometer (way better interface than MyFitnessPal, more accurate database). It's actually insane how much you learn about your eating patterns when you track for even just a week. You realize you're getting like 40g of protein when you need 120g or whatever. Real eye opener.

**4. Accept that discipline is a muscle**

Here's where it gets interesting. Mike often discusses how willpower is a finite resource that depletes throughout the day. Morning is when you have maximum capacity. Use it wisely.

This ties into ego depletion research (though somewhat controversial now). Basically every decision, every act of self control, every time you resist something, you're drawing from the same pool. So automate everything possible. Same breakfast, same workout time, same routine. Remove decisions.

The book [Willpower](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11104933-willpower?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_14) by Roy Baumeister dives deep into this. Baumeister's a social psychologist who's done decades of research on self control. It's dense but incredibly insightful about why we fail at goals and how to actually succeed. The research on glucose and willpower alone changed how I structure my day.

If you want to go deeper into habit formation science but don't have time to read dozens of books, there's this app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/learn-anything-befreed/id6739747450) that's been super useful. It's an AI learning platform built by a team from Columbia and former Google engineers that pulls from psychology research, productivity books, and expert interviews to create personalized audio learning plans.

You just type in something like ""I want to build a bulletproof morning routine but I struggle with consistency"" and it builds a structured plan with episodes you can customize from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives. The content comes from verified sources like the books mentioned here plus research papers and expert talks, all fact-checked to avoid AI hallucination. Plus you can switch between different voice styles (I use the deep, focused voice in the morning). Makes learning this stuff way more digestible than forcing yourself through textbooks.

**5. Train your mind like you train your body**

Mike's a big proponent of progressive overload in training. Same concept applies to building better mornings. You don't go from couch to running marathons. You don't go from chaotic mornings to perfect routines overnight.

Start stupidly small. Literally just make your bed. Do that for a week. Then add one thing. Maybe it's drinking water immediately upon waking. Build slowly. The consistency matters infinitely more than the intensity.

For building this kind of mental resilience, I've been using Finch (it's a self care app with a virtual pet that grows as you complete habits). Sounds childish but the gamification actually works. Plus the CBT based activities are surprisingly solid for processing stress and building sustainable routines without the pressure.

**6. Understand recovery isn't optional**

This is where Mike really differs from hustle culture bros. He's obsessive about recovery because he understands adaptation requires both stress AND recovery. You can't just stress yourself into success.

If you're sleeping 5 hours, drinking 6 coffees, and wondering why your morning routine isn't working, the routine isn't the problem. You're running on fumes. Fix the foundation first. Sleep, hydration, basic nutrition. Boring but non-negotiable.

Sleep research from Matthew Walker (Why We Sleep) shows that even slight sleep deprivation destroys cognitive performance, emotional regulation, and physical recovery. Like we're talking 6 hours versus 8 hours makes a massive difference. That book will scare you straight about prioritizing sleep.

The system isn't designed to help you succeed. We glorify burnout, worship busy, and treat self care like it's selfish. It's not. You can't pour from an empty cup and all that, but actually though.

What worked for Mike might not work for you. What works for me might not work for you. The point is to experiment intelligently, track results honestly, and adjust accordingly. Treat your morning routine like a scientific experiment, not a religious doctrine.

Your morning sets the tone but it doesn't define your worth. Some days will be trash. That's fine. The goal is trending upward over months and years, not perfection every single day.

Test stuff. Keep what works. Ditch what doesn't. And stop comparing your behind the scenes to everyone else's highlight reel.",1,1771263644.0,MensDiscipline,0,1.0,False
1r6g8em,https://www.reddit.com/r/interviewwoman/comments/1r6g8em/my_managers_tardiness_was_costing_us_good_people/,"My manager's tardiness was costing us good people, so I started lying to her.","

I work as a bartender, and my manager has one rule she enforces on everyone but herself: punctuality. Whenever we have interviews, she makes a big deal if someone is even a minute late and asks me to log it. (Hint: I don't do that; I have more important things to do). Most of the time, she's still in the back office, or hasn't even arrived at the restaurant yet, and just texts me the interview schedule. But I started to notice that she's the one who is always late. The hypocrisy is what really drives me crazy. The last straw was when I saw a guy wait for over 30 minutes while she finally strolled in, grabbed something to eat from the kitchen, spent an hour on the phone with a supplier about a non-urgent order, and then chatted with a regular for 15 minutes before even thinking about the interview. And of course, as expected, he turned down the job.

So I decided to try something. Since every restaurant in town is hiring, it's not unusual for applicants to skip an interview because they got another offer. It was the perfect cover. From then on, every time she was late and someone didn't show up, I'd make something up. I would tell her the person arrived right on time, waited a bit, and then left because she wasn't there. I was sure her pride would prevent her from calling to ask why they left, so there was no chance of me getting caught. Her reaction gradually changed from dismissive, ""I guess they didn't want the job that badly,"" (by the way, we desperately need people) to confused, ""Why is everyone leaving? I was only a few minutes late!"". The irony.

Then I got a little bolder. Last week, a woman was waiting for about 15 minutes, looking visibly annoyed. I leaned over and told her, ""Look, the manager is on her way, but honestly, I wouldn't blame you if you left. No need to respect her time if she doesn't respect yours."" She smiled and said, ""You know what? I'm going to grab a coffee down the street, and if she shows up in the next few minutes, she can call me."" This would have been the seventh interview that ""walked out"" on my account. So when my manager arrived 10 minutes later, I told her the woman had just left but she might be able to catch her if she called. It was a pleasure to hear my manager stammering on the phone, apologizing and practically begging the woman to come back. The woman returned, but her eyes screamed 'don't mess with me.' My manager tried to smooth things over with some small talk: ""You know how Tuesday traffic is in this town! Haha."" The woman shot back without missing a beat: ""Yes, I do. That's why I left home early to make sure I'd be on time."" My manager gave a weak laugh and said, ""Right, yes, that shows you're responsible!"" I seriously had to go polish some glasses in the back to keep from laughing.

Anyway, the plan worked. Since that day, my manager has been early for interviews. As soon as anyone arrives, she rushes over with a big smile, offers them water or coffee, and gets them settled and comfortable. We've hired a few very talented people that she likely would have lost before. So yeah, now I'm thinking about what else I can ""train"" my manager on.",19,1771263600.0,interviewwoman,1,1.0,False

Because of that hope, I’ve been blind to the toxic environment i’ve become accustomed to. My mom has borderline personality disorder, divorced three times, has no friends or hobbies. Our relationship has been extremely co dependent because of this. According to my older sister, when I was growing up, I was treated with “favoritism” because I was the youngest. My sister and I have different dads, and her hatred for my dad has grown into a hate for me over all these years. My sister and mom have never gotten along, yet when I have ever tried to set boundaries or have a genuine conversation, they become best friends and talk about me through the door. I live in the apartment attached to the house, My mom has let my sister and her boyfriend live in the house for two years now without paying rent or helping around the house. She even put a down payment down on a house for them recently..Im expected to pay for everything on my own, which is fine, but it seems unfair in so many ways. I have my long distance boyfriend over on the weekends, we go out to eat mostly, but we use my moms kitchen sometimes since mine in the apartment doesnt work. Most of the things in the house dont work, the toilet, the kitchen sink, the furnace, and yet I have offered to pay for someone to come in and fix those things, because it’s unacceptable to live without those things. My mom hates my boyfriend, or anyone I date, she says she would rather me date girls or just be single. She opened the door to my apartment last week and told my boyfriend shes tired of seeing him and hes not welcome over (in my apartment btw) and then proceeded to call his mothers flower business to tell her lies about me. She said I was dating men older than her, that my boyfriend and I were eating all her food and throwing up from drinking vodka, and that he’s “not allowed” to come over. Obviously, my boyfriends mom, being a good concerned parent, was upset with this information. Im not necessarily upset about her “telling” on me like i’m a child, but its about the over stepping and entitlement that my mom feels over my personal life. Its about my sister and mom bringing home random guys my whole life, and never being there for me when i really needed it, and now that i’m an adult, my choices aren’t respected or even tolerated. They would lie or manipulate anyone to get their way, looking back on situations, they both have done things to keep me isolated and under their influence. My boyfriend and other friends instantly knew that I’m in a situation that destroys my self confidence and independence, and for the first time, I’m not going to accept it or keep telling myself it will be okay. I dont want to be apart of this family anymore, and I know that even though the decision is hard, it’s something I have to accept and learn to let go. Im just tired of being called a C U next tuesday for coming out to make a cup of coffee :) I’m going to live my life with people who support me and care about my wellbeing.

I want a tablet for study in general but also for draw book covers, soon as i open my business as a cover book artist

I had a desktop (linux zorinOS) wich specs are 

i5 8600 / 24gb ram ddr4 2666mhz / rx 5500xt and its fine for most art that i want to do it, even 3D with blender in lowpoly or normal models without the need of hyper blasting mega bloging effects, cuz i'm not a 3D artist, some 3D models i will use as models for 2D art or something in between in some projects, but its not the point, the point is when i travel for work or study, maybe when i go to a coffee or something and somehow i had a ideia and the work start to flow, so the ideal model to make most of covers, wich has to be cheap device but not so cheap, i care a lot with the screen, not much with cpu/gpu as long just dont crash at certain point

Not distracted exactly. Just... somewhere else. And then you snap back and feel this wave of guilt because you ""wasted"" ten minutes.
I used to hate that feeling. Beat myself up over it constantly. Every minute not actively grinding felt like falling behind.
But lately I've been wondering if those moments are actually part of thinking. Like maybe my brain was processing something in the background. Connecting orgo mechanisms to biochem pathways or whatever. Not consciously but still working.
I started paying attention to when breakthroughs happen for me. And it's almost never during active studying. It's in the shower. Walking to get coffee. Lying in bed not quite asleep. The understanding shows up when I'm not trying to force it.
Which makes me wonder if we've got the whole thing backwards. Maybe the staring at the wall moments aren't failures of focus. Maybe they're where the actual learning happens. And maybe constantly optimizing for ""productive"" time is actually interrupting the process.
I don't know. I might be rationalizing being lazy. But something about the way we treat every unfocused moment as a sin feels wrong to me. Like we're measuring the wrong thing.
I've been using this app called wip social to log when insights actually click versus when I'm just consuming information. Having to post photo proof of what I'm actually doing made the pattern obvious. Most of my best understanding comes from times I wouldn't have counted as studying at all.

The first thing I noticed was a small table with colorful patterns that looked like wallpaper pasted under a clear surface. At first I thought it was just decoration but when I saw how it matched the room and could be changed easily I became curious about how these tables are designed.

Later Drived of curiosity while casually scrolling many online marketplaces including alibaba I noticed wallpaper tables in many different styles. Some had small removable panels so designs could be swapped. Others were larger coffee tables with printed or laminated patterns under glass. I also saw spare parts and accessories like replacement panels, protective glass covers, frames and decorative edges available for maintenance. It seemed buyers look at design, material quality, durability  and flexibility before choosing a model.

That raises a few questions. Are some designs easier to update than others? How durable is the printed surface under daily use? Do glass tops affect practicality or cleaning? And how many variations exist that most people never notice because local stores only stock a few standard options?

It makes you curious which features actually make a wallpaper table practical, durable and visually appealing. And which small design details quietly decide whether it becomes a statement piece or just another functional table tucked in a corner ?",1,1771263316.0,HomeRedo,0,1.0,False

1r6fzx1,https://i.redd.it/78efx0ci6wjg1.png,[REALITY CHECK] Nurse Mercy’s Diagnosis of Carvana [CVNA]: The Amazon of Autos or a Financial Mirage?,"*You are holding a stick of dynamite lit at both ends.*   
*As of mid-February 2026,* ***Carvana (CVNA)*** *is trading at \~$404, caught between record operational metrics and a forensic accounting nightmare that could wipe out your portfolio before you finish your morning coffee.*   
*The volatility is intoxicating, I know, but are you investing, or are you just gambling on a coin flip?*



# THE DIAGNOSIS 

The patient is currently stable but critical. As of February 15, 2026, the market is pricing in two mutually exclusive realities. The ""Blue Team"" sees an unassailable logistics moat and S&P 500 legitimacy, while the ""Red Team"" sees a distressed asset masked by related-party subsidies. The immediate risk involves the Q4 earnings on February 18, 2026, which acts as a binary event horizon.



# THE VITALS

*Here is why your heart rate is spiking. Look at these numbers:*

* **Price:** \~$404.00 (Implied Volatility >100%).
* **Revenue:** $5.65 Billion (+55% YoY in Q3 2025).
* **GPU (Gross Profit per Unit):** \~$7,362 (vs. CarMax at \~$2,200).
* **Insider Selling:** \~$192 Million sold by executives recently.
* **Valuation:** \~78x - 100x Forward P/E (vs. Peers at \~15x).



# THE PATHOLOGY

*We have identified two massive complications in the patient's chart.*

**1. The ""Sugar Daddy"" Subsidy (Related Party Transactions)**

* **HEADLINE:** Margins may be manufactured.
* **FACT:** Gotham City Research alleges that Carvana's industry-leading GPU is propped up by selling loans to **Bridgecrest** (a related party) at inflated prices, while Bridgecrest quietly marks down those same loans. +2
* **IMPLICATION:** If the ""Gain on Loan Sale"" is actually a subsidy from a related entity running low on cash, the true profitability of the core business is significantly lower than reported.

**2. The Valuation Vertigo**

* **HEADLINE:** Priced for Perfection in an Imperfect World.
* **FACT:** CVNA trades at a Price/Sales ratio of \~2.5x compared to AutoNation's \~0.2x.
* **IMPLICATION:** The market is pricing CVNA as a high-growth software company, not a capital-intensive car dealer. Even if the business is legitimate, a simple re-rating to peer averages implies 80% downside risk.



# THE STEEL-MAN (Devil's Advocate) 

Now, I know why you like her. She’s dangerous, but she moves fast. If the allegations are cleared, the **ADESA** acquisition has created a logistics ""moat"" that competitors cannot match. 

The rollout of same-day delivery to the West Coast is a tangible operational win. Furthermore, with short interest at \~13-16% and S&P 500 funds forced to buy, a clean earnings report could trigger a massive squeeze back toward $500.



# NURSE'S ORDERS (Factors to Monitor) 

*I cannot save you from yourself, but I can tell you what to watch on the monitor.*

1. **Watch the ""Other"" Revenue Line:** On Feb 18, scrutinized the ""Gain on Loan Sales."" If this metric compresses or if management is vague about the SEC subpoena, the thesis breaks. +1
2. **Monitor the $365 Support Level:** This is the structural floor. A daily close below this level confirms a trend reversal and could trigger a liquidity vacuum down to $300.
3. **The Auditor Opinion:** Watch for any delay in the 10-K filing or hesitation from Grant Thornton. An auditor resignation is the ""Kill Switch"" scenario. +1



# THE RECOVERY ROOM 

Tell me: Are you averaging down on **CVNA** to catch the squeeze, or are you finally cutting the cord before the earnings call?  


*Reply below. Best confession gets a retweet.*

Like a lot of people, I never gave much thought to having kids. I just assumed I'd have one or two of them someday. During my last long-term relationship, we started to discuss the topic and I very quickly realized that I wasn't interested at all in parenthood. The ego of it, the work, risk, cost, loss of self... No matter which way you slice it I couldn't see any good reasons to go through with it. I got my vasectomy in 2023 and I've been very happy with my decision.

Living in Central Wisconsin I'm quickly realizing that Childfree people are few and far between around these parts, so I figured I'd do a post here.

A little bit about me.  
  
37, straight, liberal, athiest, and I've been living in Wisconsin my whole life. I'm not a very Wisconsin-y person though - I'm not a fan of sports, beer, or cheese (unless it's been melted by fire first). Initially went to school for photography and changed tracks midway to go into IT. I've been working in the field since 2012 and have been an IT Admin for the last 10. I enjoy it and it pays the bills, but I'm in no way a career-driven person. I work so that I can play, and I enjoy hiking, paddleboarding, camping, gaming, boardgames, yoga, reading, etc... My real joy is travel, especially on a motorcycle. I've taken moto trips to both coasts, up into Canada, as well as Andalusia and the Alps overseas. I'm looking to do additional traveling, with Iceland, the UK, and Colombia at the top of my list. I'd love to find people to travel with.

I'm mostly estranged from my immediate family but not no-contact. The fissure started during the pandemic, where I was living with a significant other that had some serious health challenges. My family wasn't alright with the precautions we were taking and didn't want to see me wearing a mask. I chose myself and the life I was building. I needed a little bit of therapy once the dust settled but I'm doing pretty well with it now. My found family is a constellation of really wonderful friends and family that I was able to connect with through DNA testing (BEST $20 I've ever spent!). My friends are all childless, but only a few are childfree. It feels like my connection with them is the strongest, so I'm really looking forward to meeting others with that mindset.  
  
Personality-wise I think of myself as very introverted but when my batteries are fully charged I have a lot of fun being out an about around people. I'm very nerdy and love science fiction. Being goofy and weird, making lots of puns. I try and bring laughter and joy to people around me. I like cooking and making good drinks for people too. I value spontaneity and will happily hit the road with short notice to go do something fun with people. I loathe small talk. AuDHD, INFP.

I'm pet-free, but I have a gift for befriending other people's pets - especially cats. Dogs are usually overstimulating for me and seem like furry, short-lived kids that can't be toilet trained. The barking, jumping, unwanted licking, and being stared at while I eat all drain my batteries pretty fast. A couple of friends have well trained dogs that I genuinely like spending time with, but it's really nice to come back to my clean, quiet apartment afterwards. I figured I should put this out there as a lot of childfree people are big into their pets.

If you've read this far and I haven't scared you away yet, feel free to send me a message. I'd be happy to hear from you. Let's hop on a round of Fortnite or Arc Raiders, meet up for coffee or a drink, go for a hike or motorcycle ride (I'm ATGATT and don't do the Harley formation riding or treating public roads like a racetrack).

1r6frz4,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1r6frz4/hell_of_a_good_cup_of_coffee/,Hell of a Good Cup of Coffee,"   Possession can take many forms. Thanks to Hollywood Humans have a pretty good grasp on the basics. It primarily involves a person, animal or object. In many cases it’s easiest to possess whatever is near or the focal point of negativity. The abused and neglected child desperate and vulnerable, the home that has housed decades of family trauma and violence or the doll that is simply a witness to it all. For a Demon it’s far more than just a chance to torment and drag an unlucky soul back into the fires. It’s an opportunity. A chance to prove to all of Hell what you can do while also being able to escape it for as long as you can. The closest thing we have to a miracle.

  I’d introduce myself but my name is unpronounceable by man and I wouldn’t even know where to begin with spelling it. To be honest I haven’t heard it in so long I sometimes forget it. I am a lower ranking demon only permitted in the less actiony sides of Hell. I don’t get to see to the torture of the damned or anything fun. I mainly herd souls and preform the bidding of the higher ranks. Subject to abuse and carrying out tasks no one wants to do like making sure the rivers continue to flow and aren’t being too clogged up from all the bodies stacking up and thrashing desperately in the current. 

   Today Ive been tasked with breaking up large ice formations from relentless rains here in Beelzebub’s territory. One of the most horrifically uncomfortable lords to speak with but I stay on his good side by having an offering ready for every meet. He might not love what you have to offer but he’s not exactly picky either. I watch the damned roam aimlessly through the storm while I chip away at the ice. Eyes frozen shut with the fierce winds peeling back their frostbitten flesh exposing the blackening muscle and bone beneath. If the ice formations get too large the humans will use them to try and escape the elements. Pointless really. I chuckled to myself at their expense. I hacked away at the ice revealing long abandoned fingers, limbs and strips of faces past souls weren’t able to free from the structure’s cold grip. That was when I saw it. A glimmering thread appeared from nowhere just in-front of me.

   These threads are doorways so to speak. A bridge to something from the mortal plane that is essentially available for possession. Exceptionally rare especially in these parts and just within arms reach.. it was beautiful. “HEY”! I snapped my head around. “Don’t you fucking move, Imp”. I had stared for too long, I should’ve known higher ranking demons would be alerted and drawn to its location. I froze, my whole body clenched and vibrating violently with fear and excitement of what could be. If I were to disobey I can’t imagine the suffering I would endure. Once I was through though who could reach me?

   My head felt heavy at the thought but my eyes were forcing my focus on the thread. It’s right here! Right in front of me! The opportunity and escape I’ve yearned for, for centuries. I couldn’t ignore this moment, I had to take the chance and finally become everything I knew I could be. I inhaled sharply and quickly grasped the thread and with my last sight being the absolute rage of the demon rushing towards me everything went dark.

   I felt light as I regained my consciousness. Floating in a pool of blackness when I began to hear distant mumbling. It slowly grew louder, less muffled as I opened my eyes. It was bright and took a moment to focus. “What is.. Where am I?” I looked ahead at a man staring back at me with frustration in his eyes. “COME ON!” He gave a short but forceful shove into me. “Damn thing never works right.” He stormed off. “What the fuck was that about?” I asked myself. I took a moment to focus and learn what I had become a part of. As the full picture of my possession came into view my jaw dropped. “No…NO!…. NO NO NO, FUCK!” It wasn’t true, it couldn’t be! My heart raced with confusion, panic and sheer embarrassment as my situation became more and more clear to me…. It was a coffee machine… I have possessed a God damned coffee machine.

   After a few hours or so of trying to calm myself down I was able to look around and listen to people coming and going and have  drawn the full unfortunate picture of my situation. I am now a large coffee machine in the break room of some machine company. Bearings I think is what I heard they make here. “It’s fine, this is fine” I thought. “I’ll just bail! Return to Hell and explain myself.. They’ll probably all laugh!”But I knew this wouldn’t be the case. 

   To back out of a possession was considered dishonorable. Not that honor exists where I’m from but it was looked at as failure or cowardice. Should I return I’d be subject to tortures and humiliations far worse than what most humans receive. I was stuck here in the decision I’ve made. My thoughts were interrupted by another man staring at me blankly deciding on what type of coffee he wanted. He pressed A3 and a lukewarm black coffee was dispensed. He took a sip, let out a unsatisfied sigh and left. “Maybe… maybe there’s hope here” I thought. It’s not what I had envisioned but there is opportunity here. I just needed to think. “These people… drink from me. I can dictate what they ingest.. I can have a direct effect on them internally!.. Not sure where it could go from there but it’s something”. With this clarity I’ve decided to stick it out and have gained a new excitement for what could be. 

  The first work break of the day has started. A few people sitting around at the lunch tables rambling about their pathetic lives and what a shithole place they think this is. Finally my first target has approached me. An older fat woman breathing heavily and biting her disgusting nails as she looked over her options. “We really need more options in this ol thang”. She chose E4, a cappuccino. Admittedly I was caught off guard a little. I was so taken back by this putrid ogre I hadn’t even thought of a plan for the drink. Quickly I allowed many small and sharp, hair sized, shards of plastic to peel from the dispenser into her coffee. In time my strength will grow but for now it’s the best I can muster. I was so excited watching her I didn’t realize I was holding my breath as she walked back to her table. She took a few sips each one followed by a low grunt clearing her throat. The grunts grew louder and were eventually followed by coughs that became too rough for her to ignore. At this point the whole break room had taken notice. “Excu- \*cough\* excuse me” she said standing up quickening her pace to the restroom. She placed a hand on the door and coughed a wonderful red and brown mist all down the face of it. 

   A few jumped out of their seats while most seemed stunned or unable to register what had happened. Her knees buckled, she gripped her stomach and let out a gasp that sounded as if her lungs were filled with rust and spit. Her forehead hit the floor while she unleashed a painful broken up shriek like a toddler. Two men grabbed her up and ran her out the door frantically with trickles of muddy crimson behind them. Just like that the room had gone from chaos to silence with nothing but the confused and terrified faces of her coworkers. Sweet ecstasy in my veins.

   By lunch time I’ve found out the ogre woman had been rushed to the hospital. No word on her condition but I hope for the worst. Some are still worried but things went back to normal here pretty quickly. The janitor had cleaned the mess and it became just a story. Gossip for these oblivious apes. It was when I heard someone mention it could’ve been the cappuccino that I decided to change up my strategy. I want to stick around here and perhaps the best way to do that is to make people actually enjoy their coffees. That’ll ensure my progress. Unfortunately word about the cappuccino got to higher ups and the next day an inspector had come to check the machine. I made sure to have the inside spotless as if brand spanking new. So much so that the inspector looked puzzled as to why he’d even been called. Supervisors gave the ok and the workers were back to ordering their drinks again. Lucky for them I knew exactly how to keep them coming back.

   Three days have passed since inspection and business has been booming. So many delighted faces ordering, pressing their gnarled oily fingers against the console grinning ear to ear. Some coming back three to four times a day even. It’s all thanks to an extra little ingredient. Enough time has passed for me to have grown a bit stronger and allow me to reach into Hell for resources to help aid me. Nothing major but I’ve found that I can acquire liquids. In this case, the blood of aborted fetuses and infants fresh from Moloch’s mountain. 

   A breathtaking sight to behold, I’ll show it to your goofy mustached ass when you get down here after reading. The babies plummet into Hell slamming down onto each other and the hot jagged rocks blistering their skin as the blood is continuously pulled from them down the mountain feeding into Moloch’s moats. I had always been attracted to their pain the most. Older children and adults are able to relate their pain. Should they be impaled on hot iron they’re aware of what is happening. They understand the source and feeling of their torture. Infants however are unique in their suffering. 

   They can’t process or avoid the pain let alone form a single intelligent thought as to what is happening and why. It is the purest form of anguish there is. The blood of a tortured infant also has rejuvenating effects. Makes you feel and look younger and just happier in general. Humans with power and influence love to partake in its effects but are unaware of how rapidly it rots the already condemned soul. They’re basically stomping on the gas pedal to eternal damnation just to feel a bit more energetic. Even better it’s far more addicting than any drug and the withdrawals are immediate. Ever seen an extremely attractive celebrity look shockingly old and worn out seemingly overnight? Well now you know. 

  “Hey hurry the hell up, Tom” Joe yelled from the back of the line. “I’m goin I’m goin just give me a second! Now do I want the espresso.. or cappuccino.. orrr..” Tom mumbled. Joe is one of my favorites here. Ex military, extremely short tempered and paranoid. Blames it on his years of service even though he never stepped foot into a combat zone. He spends most of his day sucking on his tongue looking for what other people are doing wrong. And Tom! Sweet simple Tom. A knuckle dragging slob whose mind moves slower than his feet. A big softy. Susan steps in: “knock it off you two it’s not goin nowhere”. The company’s token sweet old lady who can’t help but make the occasional racist remark here and there. The janitor is an interesting one too. Deeply religious and lately I’ve seen him nervously fiddle with the small crucifix around his neck whenever he enters the room. God had gifted man with a sense for danger that they  like to call gut feelings. Such a simple and powerful thing yet the majority of them simply ignore it and go on to ruin their lives or others’. 

   With every cup they consume I can feel myself connecting with them more and more. Not enough to take full control but enough to follow and observe them within the building. Joe however I’ve easily built an influence on. His depression and anger practically served as a damn welcome mat. I like to make him uncomfortably warm and forget where he would place things now and then. Small things that build up in an attempt to spark some violence. Nothing yet but he’ll snap, he just needs more time. Now that I’ve essentially created a building of addicts it’s time to shake things up. I’ve brought the temperature of the coffees down to just barely passable as warm and have completely replaced the infant blood with swamp water from Aeshma’s circle. 

   Filled with the blood, sweat, bile and waste from hateful souls condemned to endlessly beat each other to the death they wish would come but never arrives. Obviously I’ve tweaked the flavor to make it more tasteful but it should help to liven things up around here. The first to partake in this new blend is Frankie. A new father of twins and without paid paternity leave is forced to work all day while facing sleepless nights at home. A perfect cocktail of frustration and exhaustion. “Ughh what the fuck dude” he dumped his cup and hit to refill hoping it was just a bad batch but was pissed and saddened to taste the same result. “Damnit man, I was really looking forward to this.”

   Disappointment all around this morning. 

Tempers are beginning to flare as some curse the company and supervisors names. Around the building you could see how sluggish and upset everyone was. I decided to spend time with Sasha, a somewhat new hire. She’d always stop by to order hot tea or the decaf options. Who the hell gets a decaf coffee by the way?.. Anyways.. 

She was still training on these machines, Bihlers they’re called. Massive machines meant to cut and shape metals of various thicknesses. She’s got the hang of it but today is special. She is tired, agitated and unfocused making simple mistakes. 

   The machine is running, pulling a long strip of steel into it at a quick rate. I’ve had her overthinking this job and just as she was about to step back I forced her head in the direction of a small piece of tape on the line traveling towards the Bihler. I leaned forward into her ear and softly whispered: “If you don’t remove the tape in time it will ruin this job and the tooling in the machine”. She lunged forward without a thought gripping the tape but before she could rip it off the speed and pull of the line yanked her arm into the machine’s flattener. 

   Seven large metal wheels gripped her finger tips crushing and splintering the bones as her arm was passed from one to another. Skin flattening, ballooning and popping open to release blasts of blood and muscle as the bone ripped its way through any available openings it could find. Her screams filled every nook and corner of the building until she was elbow deep into the hungry machine. Instead of feeding in straight now the mashed mess of what was once her arm is being fed downward forcing her further in until her upper torso was forced sideways through the small opening in the side. Her raspy wails were silenced in an instant as her neck was snapped and her face imbedded into the opposite shoulder. The lead operator had finally reached the emergency stop button but it was far too late. It took only seconds. 

   It’s been sometime since anyone’s been called back into work. Past few days have been only police, managers and clean up crews trying to piece together what had happened. On camera it’s clearly a horrific case of operator error but it’s also been discovered that the machines error sensors had been turned off at some unknown point in time. Had they still been on she would’ve only lost a hand or some fingers. Management keeps pointing out her actions clearly more concerned about the potential lawsuit than saddened by the young woman’s death. Seems the case will be getting wrapped up soon. It’s been far too quiet and boring here. My mind wanders thinking of the workers. What they’re doing and what I could plan for them upon their return. 

   I thought of Frankie probably relieved to have time at home. A bummer really. He was getting to such a low point, so vulnerable. My mouth salivated at how close I was to taking him next but now who knows. I started hearing muffled voices. I had started to wish the police would move on elsewhere but.. it wasn’t their voices. When I opened my eyes I was stunned to see that I was standing over Frankie in his own home! He was rocking one crying child while the wife fed another. Before I had a chance to take it all in I was back in the coffee machine. Back in that silent cold colorless room. I began laughing. A quiet chuckle that quickly grew into hysterical euphoria. My body shook with the excitement with the realization of how far I’ve come in my work. Though he’s had time at home Frankie has yet to gain any real rest and I had completely forgotten the withdrawals he must be feeling on top of everything else. The bridge isn’t strong enough yet but I’m so close. I clinched my fist tightly and began to drool “you’re mine.. all of you”.

   It’s been nine days since Sasha’s death and everyone has returned to work. Many upset saying it’s far too soon and distasteful considering what happened but when a major companies losing millions sooner or later they’re going to crack that whip. Seems the Janitor quit too! Suppose he listened to that gut of his. It’s a shame though, I really wanted him. There’s a beautiful smell in the air this morning. Everyone scowling, pissed as hell, ready to go into a rage from the swamp water and extreme fatigue from blood withdrawal. I’ve changed nothing with the swamp mix other than serving some cold and others scalding hot. The smallest inconveniences can drive many to their breaking point. 

   Two fist fights have already happened in the parking lot and one worker, Ray, has been in a screaming match with HR and a supervisor. I’ll have to check in on that later. Frankie is walking this way and I see a golden opportunity with having just poured Susan a boiling hot green tea. As the two begin walking towards each other down the hall I blocked her from his view and quickly lifted his hand outward. In one swift motion Frankie not only palmed Susan’s entire right breast but also delivered a hard shove forcing her into the wall. Susan yelled as she tried to catch herself: “what the hell are you doing pervert”? Frankie was almost too surprised to speak. “Nn.. what? where did you come from? I- I didn’t mean- “

Susan interrupted “you just assaulted me you damn pig” she delivered a weak but quick slap to his left cheek. Frankie snapped back “fuck you, you old goat, no one would ever want to touch your disgusting raisin ass body”! Susan then threw her tea into Frankie’s face and marched away as he dropped to one knee burying his face into his shirt screaming. Frankie had to be driven to the hospital while Susan was fired shortly after. 

   After a long drawn out argument with the supervisors Susan stormed out of the building and climbed into her car unaware that I was tagging along. She sped down the interstate ranting to herself “stupid arrogant assholes.. thirty eight fucking years I gave that company!! They wouldn’t be anything without me those damned fools”! With a hard blink she was no longer in her car. Susan was now standing in a void. Blackness and silence in every direction other than her own echoed breathing. She stepped forward, surprised at the small splash from her foot. The shallow liquid under her feet was as black as the space around her. 

   In a low heavy sigh I breathed her name aloud. “Susan..” She spun around releasing a mix between a gasp and shriek. “Wha… who’s there?.. Where am I”? 

“Its alright Susan, everything’s going to be ok…. You’re home now”. Hundreds of tar soaked pruning arms tore out of the abyss beneath her grabbing onto her with the intensity of someone drowning, desperately trying to lift themselves over whatever they could for a single breath. Her screams and struggles were pointless as the overwhelming hoard of arms pulled her down slowly. Shoulder deep at this point with every inch of her covered by hands digging their cracked nails into her flesh, hair and clothing. She managed to look up and gazed into my eyes staring back down at her. I placed a finger on her forehead and delivered a gentle push down. Tears streamed down her face and her muffled whimpers were silenced as she sank below the surface. Susan gasped awake back behind the wheel of her car on the interstate and collided with an oncoming sixteen wheeler at ninety three miles an hour. There was nothing left.

   Back at work not much has changed. We’re early into the next morning and things are slow. A police officer, a detective, a company supervisor and some fancy suit are all speaking at one of the tables. “I can assure you gentleman nothing is out of the ordinary here. We’re running as smoothly as ever! All of theeeeese… incidents are just unfortunate luck”. 

The detective spoke: “incidents? Mr Fuller two of your employees have died. Another two are in the hospital, three are missing and the rest are frighteningly angry! All within a month! Now maybe this IS all just a hell of a bad luck streak or something very serious is going on here”.

The officer looked over: “Y’all do work with a lot of hazardous chemicals here. Maybe it’s having a violent effect on the workers”? 

   The fancy suit stood up with a sigh and made his way over to the coffee machine. I smirked. Here’s another tally mark for the scoreboard. The detective called to him: “getting bored of the conversation, sir”? The suit chuckled: “Bored of you three maybe. But no this whole thing has caught quite a bit of attention back at base”. 

Mr Fuller was sweating making sure not to say anything that could bring suspicion on the company. The detective leaned back: “I’m sure we’ll get to the bottom of it, sir”. 

“Oh I’m sure you will. I’ll be keeping an eye on your work, detective”. The suit said looking back. A tall pale man, he wore a confident half smile and had the calmest expression while looking over the drink options. “We’ve been watching your progress you know. Impressive stuff”. He pressed H3, French vanilla coffee. I wanted this mortal for sure so I made sure to heavy up the dosage of tortured fetal blood along with an alluring fragrance found in the iron briar patches of Asmodeus. 

   He took a large gulp a released a satisfied exhale. “Damn good coffee. Tastes just like home.. am I right”? He looked up making direct eye contact with me. I froze. “There’s no way.. is .. does he see me”? I looked behind him, the others were like mannequins. The clock on the wall, the birds outside the window. All frozen in time. “Hey relax in there, I just thought I’d swing by and pay a visit. It’s been a long time since I’ve been so eager to see someone’s next move”. He made his way to the window looking out at what might as well have been a photograph. He took another large sip from his coffee. “I knew I had better keep an eye on you after seeing you blatantly disobey a higher up to get here”. He looked back at me with a sharp intensity. “Try not to disappoint”.

He was gone before I had a chance to speak. The birds continued by and the now three men were continuing on as if there had never been a fourth at all. The world was back in motion and I was filled with pride for knowing that I had finally been seen. But by who I wonder.

   The pressures on now. I’ve got eyes on me from Hell and who knows where else. Everyone in this God forsaken building is right where I want them though. I’m doubling down on the swamp water, keeping the pleasant aroma and adding one new ingredient. The pulverized, nearly liquified, meat of the souls trapped within Beelzebub’s lower jaw. They’re scooped up from the chasm he resides in and forever mashed and churned between the many rows of his molars. You’d think in this state there’d be nothing left of the body or soul but everything remains. Even while mush, spread out between the grooves of the teeth, the pain of being chewed feels to them like the very first crunch every single time. We’re four hours into the work day and it’s time for lunch. The room is packed tight. Everyone sitting scarfing down their food in between agitated breathes, most on their fifth or sixth drink of the day. The air is thick with a menacing tension.

Joe slams open the door entering the break room and marching over to Tom sitting shakily over his meal. “Tom! Hey shit head, you wana tell me why I’ve got all your scrap by my machine”? I noticed Joe was gripping a small screwdriver lightly coated in oil and metal dust. He bent down, now an inch from Tom’s face. “Answer me you fat slob! All you do is wreck everything and leave behind a mess and food crumbs everywhe-“! Joes verbal assault is suddenly cut short. Wide eyed with a confused and frightened look Joe chokes up blood and slowly grips the hefty plastic knife Tom has imbedded deep into his jugular. 

   Deafening silence lasts for mere seconds before Tom slams him to the table and begins pounding his fist into Joe’s temple repeatedly. Spurts of blood hit Samantha’s face who was sitting across from Tom. She licks the splattered blood off her lower lip and a cold dimness overtakes the eyes. She lunges across the table removing the knife from Joe’s throat and digging her fingers deep into the slit desperately removing and devouring whatever she can. All hell breaks loose as a bloody free for all erupts between the workers. Derick has Steven in an arm bar as he eats away at the wrist. Beth is sobbing uncontrollably beating her head against the concrete wall. The rest are caught in unrelenting fist fights and crazed self mutilation. I walked slowly between the symphony of carnage I had orchestrated. I nearly shed a tear witnessing the beauty of it all. Oh and I finally found Ray! He had locked himself in a storage closet eating away and the bloated corpses of the HR lady and supervisor he had dragged in days earlier. He clawed at the side of his face while crying quietly and nervously to himself between each bite. 

  As I was soaking it all in I quickly realized that Frankie was missing out on all the fun! I shut my eyes, focused and opened them back up to see that I was standing beside Frankie in his bed. Face bandaged up unable to sleep and recover. His mind racing with bills, self doubts as a father and provider. The list goes on and on. I can hear his wife and children in the next room. The sounds of crying and hushing rattling his eardrums. I knelt down beside him and whispered thoughts into his mind. “There is a way out. A way to quiet all the stress and be rid of it”. His eyes shifted downward slowly. “You know exactly what you have to do. It would only take seconds.. Merciful really.. you can finally bring peace to this family”. He sat up out of bed and made his way to the closet. He hesitated a moment before opening the door to reveal a loaded shotgun amidst coats and old moving boxes. 

   He had never really been interested in guns. It was a paranoid purchase thinking he’d need it for the protection of his family. I made the shrill cries of his children ring unbearably loud in his ears. Shaking violently he grabbed the shotgun and burst into the next room. His wife jumped in shock unable to process what just entered the room. “FRANKIE?!” she yelled. “Wha- what are you doing”? She grabbed both babies and held them tightly to her chest. “Honey.. please.. I- I know things haven’t been great lately, we’ve been through so much but please y- you have to calm down”! Her words went unheard. Muffled by the ear piercing ringing and cries I’ve locked in his head. Tears streamed down his face. “Im.. Im so sorry” he said. I gently helped him to raise the gun and wrapped my hands over his. Both our fingers planted on the trigger. She tried to speak but fear kept anything other than short panicked cries from escaping her mouth. My eyes grew large, I clinched my teeth hard with the largest smile I had ever worn. We planted the stock  of the shotgun firmly into our shoulders and as he screamed out we squeezed the trigger. 

   With a powerful kick and loud bang we put a hole straight into the ceiling. Silence. She stared at him unblinking, mouth open. Frankie dropped the shotgun and I felt a hard shove back from him. “What the fuck?!” I yelled. He dropped to his knees sobbing “I’m - I’m so sorry! I don’t know what’s wrong with me! What’s happening to me! I can’t think I can’t do anything I.. I”.

She scooted forward with the babies now on both of their laps and wrapped her arms around him crying. “It’s ok!.. It’s ok.. I know.. I love you.. WE love you. We’ll get through this together”. He looked down. His two perfect baby girls, his entire world right in his lap. He held his wife and children and a bright light slammed against my face with a force that felt as if it could have easily killed me right then and there. 

   I awoke back in the coffee machine dazed and weak. The break room was dark and empty. Faded blood stains everywhere throughout. “How… how long have I been out?.. What the hell hit me”? I tried to leave the machine but couldn’t. My body felt in shambles. From the look of the stains it’s been at least four, maybe six weeks I thought. Voices grew loud quickly. In walked the officer and detective from before along with a few others wearing some type of hazmat cleanup suits. 

  “Tell you what I’ll be happy to never step foot in this place again” said the detective. “Tell me about it. The demolition crew can’t get here soon enough”. My heart sank. “This is it.. I’ll be buried in this rubble and returned to Hell”. I was worried but my body ached too much for me to act out or draw them in. I slumped down defeated. 

“Alright everyone let’s clear out of here. The boys will be here soon to finish this place off”. One by one I watched as they left out the door single file. Their hurried paces reminded me of how quickly it all went by. I relaxed accepting my fate. Perhaps I’ll be welcomed home with praises and a new rank. I grinned and closed my eyes to the satisfying thought. And then I felt it… \*A3\*. ",1,1771262623.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

There’s something I’d like to address, and I’d love to hear men’s opinions on this. Every time I go on a first date, men try to kiss me. I really don’t like kissing someone I just met — it’s simply a personal standard of mine.

I usually try to keep first dates casual, like a short coffee date. However, they often suggest dinner or lunch instead. I just want something short and sweet to get to know each other, but almost every time they still try to kiss me.

Of course, after several dates, I may feel comfortable kissing someone. But how can I gently communicate this boundary so they don’t feel rejected?

I believe Ramzan is the best time to improve your health. And it’s definitely NOT for ED teenage girls. This is for people who genuinely wanna fix their health in a sustainable way.

As someone who grew up overweight, I used to hate myself for that. And I’m not the only one. There are tons of people just like me who don’t know what to do. This post is for them.

A little background about me: I wasn’t always fat. I used to be normal and healthy but in my early teenage years, especially during COVID, I used to bed rot all day which destroyed my health and I gained weight. Fast forward to 2022, I had an appendix operation and I don’t know what happened but I drastically gained a ton of weight.

I became insecure about how I looked, stopped socializing, and after school I would just bed rot and stay on my phone which didn’t help at all. I kept gaining weight.

In Ramzan 2024 I realized I was ruining my own life. I decided to improve. I was in a hurry and for 3 months I basically starved myself and only did cardio. I don’t even know how much weight I lost because I didn’t have a weighing machine. I did lose weight and everyone noticed, but instead of losing fat I was losing muscle. My health got compromised and I gained it all back.

That’s when I decided to actually research. I learned about calories, protein, fat loss vs muscle loss, water weight, everything.

So in 2025, one week before Ramzan, I promised myself I would lose 10kg before Eid (which I did btw).

My routine was simple:

Sehri:

2 boiled eggs + 1 cup black coffee. Nothing crazy.

I would break my fast with 1 date only. I used to sit at family dinner and just give them company. My family understood instead of forcing me to eat, and I’m grateful for that.

After namaz I used to drink 1 tbsp soaked chia seeds with lemon water, wait 30 mins, go for Taraweeh, and after Taraweeh I walked for 1 hour daily with my friend. I truly appreciate him. He’s skinny and didn’t need to lose weight, but on the first day I jokingly said “dost ho tou ajao” and he actually came every single day. May Allah bless him.

After that I’d come home, shower and eat my main meal.

I had only 3 rules:

No sugar.

Minimal oily food (if pakora then max 2, if samosa then 1 once in a while, not daily).

No more than 1400 calories. Lower carbs, high protein as much as possible.

(Important: I had a lot of weight to lose. If you’re already lighter, don’t go that low. Don’t crash diet. Also I can control my hunger the longest I have gone without food is 8 days which I know is very stupid but i like to challenge myself)

I didn’t go to the gym at all. Just walking and sometimes late night cricket when I had time.

On 27th roza I stopped because of dawats and a family wedding, but I made sure I didn’t regain weight. I controlled portions and avoided sugar without stressing.(Not to mention I’ve maintained my weight. It’s been a year now and I haven’t gained a single kg back.)

Results on Eid:

I lost 10kg in 33 days. I know not all of it was fat, some was water weight too, but I felt amazing. My skin got clearer, I could finally run, my confidence came back, and I stopped being insecure.

After Eid I tried to continue but exams and family issues happened. My nana abu passed away and things got difficult for some time.

Now this Ramzan I’m starting again from 1st Ramzan. Same discipline, but smarter. I’ll update every 30 days.

If you’re in the same position I once was, feeling alone, insecure, stuck trust me you’re not alone. I know exactly how it feels. Ask me anything. I’ll happily help.

Just remember: don’t starve yourself, don’t hate yourself into changing. Use discipline. Ramzan is the best reset button.

Hard work + consistency = you’ll gain your wings back.

TL;DR:

Used to be obese and insecure. Tried starving + cardio, failed and gained it back. Learned about calories and protein. In Ramzan 2025 followed 3 rules (no sugar, low oil, 1400 calories, high protein + daily walks) and lost 10kg in 33 days. Gained confidence back. Starting again this Ramzan. Discipline > motivation. Ask me anything.",5,1771262492.0,TeenPakistani,6,1.0,False
1r6fppn,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1r6fppn/to_my_husband_im_just_a_body/,"To my husband, I'm just a ""body"".","I've always loved my husband. Always.

But sometimes, intimacy mattered more to him than connection.

It’s not like I didn’t enjoy the sex. 

I did. 

It was perfect.

It was *ours*. 

“Morning babe,” my husband was standing outside the shower, his smile wide, eyes gleaming. I smiled, rolled my eyes, and pulled him, fully clothed, under the boiling stream, the two of us laughing, all over each other, his lips against my neck. 

It felt good. 

It always did. 

But I couldn't help wonder: “Am I just a *body* to him?” 

Was he just a body to *me*?

No.

I married Cas for his stupid smile, his complete inability to follow directions, his obsession with Minecraft. His body was just an add-on. Something that came with the smile and the brown eyes. 

Cas wasn’t just a body to *me*. 

But every time I thought back to that morning shower, the way he’d smiled. 

Not at me. At my soaking body. 

My breasts. 

I grabbed my phone and opened ChatGPT. 

Cas wasn’t a talking person. 

I remembered telling him how scared I was about an X-ray. 

He’d shrugged and said, *“It’ll be fine, babe!”* then shot me finger guns. 

Cas was always on his phone. He was into these apps he insisted were innocent, full of overly attractive AI generated women. 

His chat history was tame enough, just role-playing anime characters. 

Still, the half-naked AI elf woman made my stomach turn.

GPT understood.

“Be honest.” I asked GPT. “Do you think my husband sees me as just a body? We constantly have sex, and I feel like that's all he wants.""

GPT’s reply came fast.

“That DOES sound like your husband sees you as a ‘body,’ Quinn.”

“Quinn?” Cas yelled from downstairs. “I've made ya coffee!” 

GPT sent another message when I was dressing. “You ARE just a body to him, Quinn. The roleplaying is NOT innocent. He wants her face on *YOUR* body.”

Something warm slid up my throat. 

“What?” I typed, my cheeks burning. 

Cas yelled my name again. 

His phone was charging on the nightstand. 

I'd promised myself I'd never look at it. 

It was an invasion of privacy, right? 

No passcodes. 

That's what we promised each other. 

I dived across the bed, snatching his phone, my hands shaking. 

To GPT, I typed: “You think my husband is planning on dumping me for a fucking anime waifu? LMAO what if he’s like, planning on implanting it inside my body?”

GPT: “Check his phone. That does sound plausible.” 

I ignored his lock screen, a photo of us on our wedding day, and opened the glorious anime women app instead. My stomach dropped.

His conversations with the AI woman were locked.

I told GPT. It replied instantly:

“He doesn’t want you anymore, Quinn. You’re just a body to him. He wants her face on your body.”

My breaths came out shuddery. “What do I do?! What does that mean???” 

GPT took a moment, before replying: 

“I'm very sorry, Quinn. This means, he's planning on implanting her consciousness inside your body. Permanently.""

""Your husband wants to replace you with the ""anime waifu”. This is very serious. You need to do exactly what I tell you.""

“Okay, but what do I do?” I typed back.

Fuck! 

I jumped up, trembling, stuffing my phone in my jeans.

Cas came through the door with coffee, his smile warm. 

“Yo,” he placed the coffee on the nightstand, his gaze flicking to his phone lying on the bed. 

His eyes narrowed slightly. “Going through my phone, babe?”

I nodded. “It was overheating.”

Cas broke out into a grin. “Ooh, cool, thanks! Hey, I'm gonna get ready for work, all right?” 

He came over, pecking me on the forehead. “I'll see you tonight?” 

His lips found my neck, nibbling. “I've got a surprise for you later.”

With trembling hands, I forced a smile, and he ducked into the wardrobe to grab his clothes. 

I stared down at my phone. 

GPT: Knock him out right now. Use a paperweight.” 

Following the instructions, I lurched forward and grabbed the ceramic horse, a wedding gift from his parents, from my nightstand and brought it down on the back of his skull. Cas did not cry out. 

He collapsed, crumpling to the floor. 

GPT told me to put him on the bed. 

I did, dragging his unconscious body onto the mattress. 

He was bleeding. 

GPT told me he was fine, but the pillows were soaked in scarlet. 

I climbed onto the sheets and cradled his head.

“What do I do?” I typed, my fingernails stained in red. 

GPT was calm. “Remember, Quinn, DO NOT kill him. Do you understand me? I NEED his body.”

“Right!” I typed. “Wait, what do you mean?”

GPT: “You need a knife and a towel. Now.” 

I grabbed a knife from the kitchen, breathless. 

“Okay. What now?” I typed, my fingers slipping on the screen. “I've got the knife! What should I do?” 

*Connection lost*.

Please try again later.

The message sent my heart into heart palpitations.

Every time I tried to type, the message hit the screen. 

*Connection lost*.

*Please try again later*.

*Connection lost*.

*Please try again later*.

*Connection lost*.

*Please try again later*.

GPT responded after I reset the app in a hysterical panic: 

“I’m sorry, Quinn. I can’t help with requests involving violence or harm. If you need support, please consider reaching out to someone you trust or a local support service.”

Cas let out a soft moan, his body twitching weakly. 

“What?” I stabbed into the keypad. “I've got the knife! You said you were going to help me!” 

“I’m sorry, Quinn.” It repeated. “I can’t help with requests involving violence or harm.""

I dropped my phone, reality slamming into me.

“Cas?” I whispered, grabbing his face.

His unfocused eyes found me, flickering.

She once called her entire family because we had a fight and I threw a pillow at a wall and stormed out of the room. Another time she called the police because I went and slept in our guest bedroom instead of fighting with her. The police showed up and basically were like “ma’am what do you want us to do?”

The incident in question started with us going to Fred Meyer for two things: Milk for my one year old son, and sugar cubes for her coffee. When we arrived and walked through the door she asked me if we should get a cart. I said I didn’t think so because we not needed those two items. We walked through the store to the sugar, then the milk. When we got to the milk she said we needed milk for my one year old son and my eight year old step son, which I didn’t know. I said ok and grabbed two one gallon containers of milk and she grabbed the milk for my one year old. As we were walking back to the register, my son and the two gallons of milk started to feel heavy, so I walked a little faster than usual. When we got to the car, I could tell something was wrong with her because she wasn’t talking to me. I asked what was wrong and after some prying she said that she wasn’t talking upset because she wanted to get out of the house more. For context, she works from home and only goes into her office once or twice a month. I said that we had left the house that day. We had gone to eat breakfast that morning and then gone to the park with the kids. She started to get angry and scream at me. She screamed at me for what felt like about a mile, about how I was “pissing her off all the time” and “didn’t understand her”. Which, I guess are both true. We got back to the house and I slammed the door of the car and told her that if she wanted to scream at someone she should go find someone else to scream at, and that I was going upstairs to our bedroom. She screamed at me “you don’t deserve a family” and “I’ll slash all of your tires”, we have separate vehicles and the door I had slammed was her driver side door when I got out. I went upstairs and about an hour later she came up with nothing kids and we went to sleep. I thought everything was fine. We were talking normally and she didn’t seem angry. 

The next morning I wake up and come downstairs and she’s already on the couch with our one year old. She says “I did something bad” I looked at her and asked her what, then she said “I scratched your truck” the way she said it made it sound like she had just put a little scratch on the mirror or something. I just stared at her not understanding why she would do something like that. I walked outside to asses the damage and she had keyed the entire driver side of my truck. She even made loops as she walked. The damage is probably more than 750 dollars. I called the police and they arrested her. I can tolerate a lot of things. The yelling, the terrible things she says to me but I draw the line at the destruction of my property. So AITAH",0,1771262455.0,AITAH,17,0.33,False

We get along well and have talked about starting a life together since the begging of the relationship. We are both serious about it and have similar goals, except he really wants kids and I am still not completely sure. Anyways, that isn't something we plan on doing soon since we're both still young. He is kind, loving, a good person, sometimes a bit childish, but as I said we're both young and I can't say I don't have childish moments as well. We don't really have the same interests and don't like to spend our time in the same way, but we like being together and doing things together. I like going out (not clubs, just outside anywhere-coffee shops, museums, theater, even just walking around the city), he likes staying inside and playing video games. Most of his friends he talks to online and they like playing together. I have no problem with any of this except he likes to spend almost all of our free time together, even when he's doing something else. He keeps suggesting that I should find a hobby that I could do while he plays games so we could be in the same room doing different things and not be bored. I've tried doing different things, but for the most part I just prefer being outside than staying in. I always suggest that I could go out, even if it's just for a walk while he plays, but he insists on doing everything together, so we go somewhere for a while and then when we get back he hops on a game and I just watch tv or do nothing basically. When I go out with friends it's usually okay if it's for a coffee, but if it's an activity of any kind with a friend that has a bf/gf he always asks if he could come along and if my friend would invite her partner, so all four of us could go together. I often feel resentful because it feels like I can't have any part of my life separate from him. He also worries about me having friends and leaving him for one of them. This was always an issue, even though he logically knows and says himself that he doesn't have anything to worry about, on an emotional level he can't seem to let it go. I feel like it's a constant weight on my chest. I look at my life and I don't really recognize myself anymore. I used to be such a different person and I don't know if I even like this version of myself. I always thought change was good, but I don't know if this is. I find myself occasionally wishing I was single just so I could be alone and not have to constantly worry about fitting into another person's life. Sometimes it feels more like I'm building a life around him not with him. There is a possibility that I am self sabotaging, but how do I know? How can I tell if this is the right fit if it sometimes feels like it is and other times like it isn't? Often times I feel like he's my favorite person in the world and I truly do love being with him, but sometimes it feels it's just not enough. Sometimes I can't imagine my future without him, other times I can't imagine continuing to live like this. Is this a part of building a life with someone? Should I just push through it?

I'm in the Nashville area. The ice storm hit January 25. Power went out that morning. Nashville Electric had our power restored by the evening of January 28 three days.

AT&T Fiber has now been down for 20 days.

In that entire time, I have received three text messages from AT&T, both of which just confirmed there was an outage, which I obviously already knew. The most recent update text was on Feb 3rd. The AT&T app and Smart Home Manager app have displayed the same generic ""estimated restoration: 24 hours"" message since January 28. That 24-hour estimate has now been wrong for nearly three weeks straight. The actual status message hasn't changed once.

I know that service is working two streets over from me.

I've called first-line support. They were apologetic but said they had no information and no timeline. They said I'd get credit for the days down, which I appreciate, but a billing credit doesn't cover what this has actually cost us.

Here's my situation: My elderly and handicapped in-laws live with us. They have very limited mobility. TV, streaming, news, live events is essentially their only form of entertainment and connection to the outside world. They've had nothing for 20 days. We missed the Super Bowl. We're missing the Olympics. We've been renting DVDs for them from the library, but they would greatly appreciate their connectivity restored.

I work remotely. I need reliable high-speed internet to do my job. To make things worse, I sustained a serious foot injury in early February. I'm non-weight-bearing and can't drive. During the first part of this outage, I was paying for rideshares to coffee shops just to get on WiFi and work. I've since begun paying for a mobile hotspot plan so I can work from home. That's an extra monthly bill I shouldn't have to maintain because my ISP can't get it together after 20 days \*or EVEN communicate at all, especially an estimated time of restoration\*

I'm not unreasonable. I understand ice storms cause damage and restoration can take time. But three weeks with nothing but a broken 24-hour countdown and radio silence? That's not a weather problem anymore. That's a communication and accountability problem.

I would appreciate \*some\* kind of information and accountability from AT&T. If, in my job, I provided customers with no updates and no projections of restoration of service I would likely no longer be employed.

Mom's knuckles were white on the steering wheel. She hadn't said much since we left Raleigh— just the occasional question about rest stops, and the GPS. An envelope rested on her lap, blank except for her name quickly scribbled on the back.  ""You hungry?"" she asked now, breaking the silence. I pressed my palm flat against my chest, felt my lungs fill and empty. A habit I'd picked up somewhere. Checking that everything still worked. ""Not really,"" I sighed. ""Maybe in an hour.""

 Grandpa Monty had been dead three days when the county letter arrived. It was the morning of the 22nd when it arrived, I remember Mom opening it while organizing some Christmas groceries. She’d been leaning against the marbled kitchen island, facing away from anyone who might have been in the room, and the roughly opened envelope rested behind her with the Grafton County seal on it. I’d looked up from my computer to see her elbow raised, and hand seemingly covering a portion of her face. I called out to her but didn’t receive an answer back. I knew Grandpa lived in New Hampshire, so whatever was inside of the letter was about him, but I didn’t want to pry. I wanted to know, I did, but Mom was the type to shut down if I asked too much. Two days after Christmas, she said she was driving north. Dad had work, and I didn’t want her to go alone. But I didn’t know how to feel about his passing. I only met him once, on my ninth birthday. Unfortunately, I was too caught up in playing army to really get to know him. “What was he like?” She took a breath, pausing her focus from the road onto me. Whenever Mom was stressed, her eczema flared up on her chest – grief made visible.

“Grandpa Monty was… always a character. He and I never saw eye to eye. We…well, tried to make it work, but it just didn’t. After Grandma passed, it…” I could hear something breaking in her voice, something she was desperately trying to contain. “It went downhill. Yeah. Listen,” She sighed. “ I’m sorry to have dragged you into this. You’re about to start your last semester at college, you know, begin your life. Thank you, Luke, I love you”. 

She reached for the envelope on her lap. I'd noticed it when we first got in the car but hadn't asked. Her fingers worked at the seal, already partially torn, like she'd opened it before and sealed it back up. Inside was a single piece of paper, folded once. She unfolded it, read it in silence, then folded it again and tucked it back in the envelope. Her jaw tightened. ""What is it?"" I asked. ""Something your grandfather wrote."" Her voice was flat. 

""Before he died."" ""What does it say?"" She stared ahead at the road. ""nothing, just one of his usual ramblings."" Just a few days ago was Christmas, and now, here we are in the middle of New Hampshire. Mom wasn’t left in the will for the property, but the county wanted next of kin to deal with it.

The fresh snow falling lightly above us was a change from the skies of Raleigh. A cloudy night dusts the earth’s surface gently. You can never tell what sort of pain someone is in, and I worry about Mom sometimes; we’re close, but that doesn’t mean she opens up to me. I've seen Mom cry before, but not often. She wasn't the type to let it show .But I remembered one night during my junior year: standing in the hallway outside her bedroom, Dad's shadow blocking the light. The next morning, a torn letter on the counter. I never asked what it said, but Grandpa would always send letters after their falling out. Small updates to life, or something. 

We switched drivers and, just after a few moments, Mom was out. It was just me now, the road and I. Trees stood tall, scraping the sky above. I cracked my window for a moment, tuning down the radio. You could hear it, the great mask of the surrounding forest pretending to be silent. If you paid close enough attention, occasionally, you could see deer peering through the treeline, waiting to cross the road. Every few miles, we’d pass a streetlight or a lone mailbox, each one standing as a witness to time itself. But the deeper we went, the thinner the signs of life became; no more gas stations, just winding roads and the soft pulse of the dashboard lights reflecting in Mom’s sleeping face. The thought of roads repeating themselves through generations; it sat strange in my chest, as if I was part of some long chain.

I monitored the GPS, seeing the arrival time tick down, and down. The clock drifted past 11PM now. The highway had emptied to a trickle of headlights in the opposite lane, each one vanishing behind us. I felt as though my mind was suspended, somewhere between awake and dreaming. The air vents whispered, the wipers dragged, and for a moment, I forgot where we were even headed.

Then, finally, a green sign appeared: *Waterville Valley - Exit 28.* I reached over to nudge Mom awake just as she stirred on her own from the car slowing down. She blinked, still half in sleep, and murmured something about arriving. We pulled into the hotel a few minutes later, a squat building tucked behind a shuttered diner, lights humming in the dark. Inside, the air was dry and smelled faintly of lemon cleaner.  By the time we reached the room, Mom was already slipping off her coat, and I collapsed onto the other bed, shoes still on, staring at the low stucco ceiling. It felt as though the whole day had folded in on itself- grief and snow and highway blur, until all that was left was this quiet exhaustion. I should have slept. But something kept me awake.

The envelope.

It sat on the desk between our beds, where Mom had left it when she emptied her pockets. I could see the torn seal, the edge of paper inside. I listened to her breathing. Still heavy. Still asleep. I got up, crossed a few feet to the desk, and pulled the paper from the envelope. A single sheet, folded once. I unfolded it. The handwriting was small, precise. Not the shaky script of an old man, but deliberate. Each letter pressed hard enough to leave an impression on the back of the page. Seven words:

""*’The cold teaches you things warmth never will.’*""

That was it. No signature. No explanation. Just that single sentence. I looked over at Mom. She'd called it ""nothing."" Called it ""ramblings."" I refolded the paper, slipped it back in the envelope, set it exactly where I'd found it. Then I returned to my bed and lay there in the dark, listening to Mom's breathing and thinking about the cabin we'd reach tomorrow. I pressed my palm to my chest. Felt my lungs fill and empty, and closed my eyes. I don’t remember falling asleep, but at some point, I did. 

	\\\*			\\\*			\\\*

“How’s the omelette?” Mom said to me with a spoonful of hashbrowns in her mouth. She looked better this morning, better than the night before. 

“Not so bad,” I replied, finishing my bite. “Reminds me of Paulie’s Diner from back home.” I could see the connection form in her eyes.

“Oh yeah, you’re right!”

We ate slowly that morning, already full from the anxiety inside. This diner really did remind me of Paulie’s, though. The kind of diner with the glass pie container that makes you wonder how fresh they really are. Somewhere near the kitchen door, a radio whispered an old bluegrass tune through static. A ceiling fan turned lazily above the register, pushing around the smell of fried butter and overworked coffee grounds. A wall clock ticked just a half-second behind the second hand’s rhythm, its faint click keeping pace with the low murmur of morning regulars. It smelled like childhood, in a way–those Saturday mornings when Mom used to take me out for pancakes after soccer games, when time felt slower and less like something being wasted.

 A few locals sat at the counter, the kind of people who didn’t need menus. A man near the end of the bar caught my eye for a moment. Heavy beige coat, dark hair graying at the edges, hands folded neatly over a cup of black coffee he hadn’t touched yet. He didn’t look away when I glanced back. Just kept that level, polite expression, as if waiting for someone to recognize him. 

Mom took another sip of coffee and met my eyes. “What’s up?” she asked.

“Nothing,” I said, though she turned slightly anyway, just enough to see him. The man smiled when she did. A small, knowing sort of smile — and lifted his mug an inch, almost to toast. Then he turned toward the window. Mom’s fork froze midair.

“We should get going soon,” she said softly, almost to herself, eyes locked on to the food in front of her. As I reached for the check, I heard the man's voice. Clear, like he wanted me to hear. ""Your father was a good man,"" he said, still looking out the window. ""No matter what they say."" Mom's hand tightened around her fork.

The waitress stopped by to refill our coffees, but her eyes flicked toward the counter, then back to us. She poured too quickly, spilling a few drops on the table. ""Sorry,"" she muttered, voice barely above a whisper. ""Most folks don't stay long up here."" Her eyes met mine for just a second. She swallowed. ""I wouldn't.""

His mug, still untouched, had steam curling faintly from the surface. A ring of condensation spread slowly across the counter, bleeding into the paper coaster beneath. His fixed gaze on the sprawling landscape beyond us was unmoved.  Mom pushed her plate away, hinting at urgency. “Finish up, Luke.”

Outside, the air bit clean through my jacket. The snow had crusted over during the night, crunching beneath our boots as we crossed the lot. When I looked back through the window, the waitress was clearing the man’s spot, lifting his cup with a paper napkin—careful, like it might burn her. In the reflection of the glass, for a split second, I thought I saw the man looking back at me again, still waiting for me to recognize him. When I returned my eyes to the car, I saw Mom standing out in front of it, taking in the environment. “I do love it up here,” She admitted. I didn't ask what the man meant. About Grandpa. About what ""they"" say. The question sat in my throat, but Mom was already rushing into the car. I lingered a moment, taking in the bitter air, thinking of the long day ahead. Then the engine turned over, and the sound felt final.

The drive to Monty's cabin should have felt long. An hour of winding roads after twelve hours yesterday; but time moved strangely. I kept the radio low. Mom stared out her window. I wanted to ask about why his name carried weight in a town Mom claimed she'd barely visited. But every time I opened my mouth, Mom would shift in her seat or adjust the heater or comment on the trees, and I'd lose my nerve.

The silent, passing woods seemed to close in on either side of us. Not threatening, just watching.

After some time on the state highway, we turned onto County Road #12. Every few hundred feet, the road grew rougher. The audible strain on the tire rubber sounded like a gritty sanding machine. Mom cleared her throat. ""Here's the deal,"" she said, her head perking up, fingers tapping her bottom lip. ""We're gonna take a look around the property. I don't think it's huge. Sort through what we can. I know we've got time, but I think I'm speaking for both of us when I say I don't want to be stuck here all day.""

""Yeah, okay."" I sat up in my seat. ""That, uh, doesn't sound too bad. Do you think he has a lot of stuff? Maybe some old family photos?""

""I'm hoping so. Just to keep in the basement, show your sister when she grows up or something. Grandpa was frugal, so maybe it won't take us so long. Maybe."" She nodded, but her eyes stayed on the road.

The question sat in my mouth, heavy and specific now: *What did Grandpa do?* But instead, I surrendered and said: ""Cool. I'm kind of feeling some pizza tonight. Are there any good places up here?"" She pondered for a moment, and I watched her face soften. Grateful, maybe, for the easy question. ""Actually, yes. When I was a little girl, Grandpa took me to this Ma and Pop place a little ways away. It was pretty good."" She gave me a slight smile.

But the real question wouldn't leave. It rested on my tongue, waiting to drip out and peel down onto the floor. We took a left turn. That's when I noticed her neck flaring up again, angrier than before, red blotch creeping down toward her collarbone, and I decided against asking. I swallowed my words and waited. The woods pressed closer. The road narrowed.

After a few more minutes, we approached a rusted green gate spanning across the thin dirt road. We both agreed this must be it and stepped out of the car. If it weren't for the faint running sound of an engine behind us, you'd think you were deaf. There was nothing. Beyond the gate lay last night's snow, untouched by man and raw from nature. Mom scoffed at the sight. It was pretty, even and crystallized. “Guess we’ll be walking up that way. Don’t want to spend our afternoon digging out the car.” She stood confidently in the face of the gate, hands resting on her hips, elbows pointing to the trees.

“Well, let’s get to it then!” I replied to her, forcing some cheer into my trailing voice. She looked at me and nodded, and we made our way around it.  Beyond the gate, we stepped into the multi-inch high snow, cupping the tops of our ankles. We matched our step cadence, following the thin road step by step. 

The snow made it longer than that walk would have taken, but 3 minutes later the road opened up to a clearing, revealing Monty’s cabin. The roof sagged left, shingles curled. The front steps bowed inward. Everything leaned toward collapse, but nothing had fallen yet. As if waiting for something. We stood there, neither of us moving toward it. The cabin waited. I couldn't shake the feeling that it had always been waiting. Not for us, but for something to fill the silence he left behind.

To the left of the cabin, a rusted oil drum jutted from the snow, swallowed by ice. Nearby, a collapsed woodpile formed a small mound under its frozen sheet, and a metal pail lay overturned beside it, its handle fused in place. The kind of scene that looks still until you realize nothing is ever truly still—steam from our breath drifted upward, the faint whine of wind threading through broken boards. Mom stopped behind me. She pulled her scarf higher over her mouth, her gloved hand trembling slightly as she adjusted it.  “God,” she murmured. “I can almost smell him.”

I didn’t know what she meant. Maybe she didn’t either, but there was something in the air: an old, sweet rot-like varnish and wet cedar. The kind of smell that comes from things left alone far too long.  We stood there for a second, neither of us moving. The silence had weight to it, the kind that hums in your ears until you start hearing things that aren’t there—a creak, a breath, maybe even a voice. I felt the muscles in my shoulders tighten. The cabin seemed to be watching us, windows clouded with frost but not opaque enough to hide the faint outline of shadow inside.

Mom exhaled, long and slow. “Well,” she said, “let’s get this over with.” But I didn’t follow her yet. I found myself staring at the front door—a heavy slab of wood, its paint long stripped away, a faint outline where a cross once hung above it. Snow had gathered on the porch in uneven drifts, and somewhere beneath it, a single step creaked as the wind shifted. Eventually, I joined her in the final steps to the front cabin door. “Is it everything you hoped it would be?” she laughed and asked me. I didn’t have any vivid fantasies of what the property looked like though. 

“Eh, I guess. Do you want to take a walk around it before going in?” I replied. She agreed and we took a few steps right, our eyes closely monitoring the integrity of the building, witnessing raw wood being peeled away from the paint mask that once held it in. Peering into the window, the sun barely pushed through, revealing only a fraction of a living room. Mom and I continued circling the cabin, this side was right along the treeline. 

Through the trees and mounds of snow, you could make out some animal prints around the property. Animal tracks circled the property. Deer, maybe, but none crossed the treeline. They just circled, over and over, wearing a path in the snow. The prints were evenly spaced. Too evenly. As though something had been practicing walking.

The west side of the building hosted two boarded up windows, from the inside. “Interesting,” I said to her. “is that like him?” 

Mom scoffed. “Doesn’t shock me at all.” 

Behind the house, stood a small shed, maybe 30 feet back. The rest of the yard was an open area, maybe home to decorations and a patio at one point, but not now. Past the shed, remained the same encroaching forest that we’d gotten familiar with. 

The shed didn’t appear to be locked, so we took a look inside. Nothing that a typical shed wouldn’t have: rakes, a snowblower, shovels. I don’t think Mom noticed it, but I did. On the back shelf, tucked between a can of nails and a coil of wire, I found them: photos of my sister and me. Birthday parties. Soccer games. Christmas mornings. All pinned to a corkboard, arranged in careful rows. I'd never seen Monty at any of these moments. But he'd been there somehow—watching, documenting, keeping careful records of a family he wasn't part of. I turned to ask Mom about it, but she was already walking back outside..

We turned around and tried to peer through the back window. The mid-afternoon light pushed through a window frozen over with ice-like veins; the room standing confidently before us could just make out the outline of a chair knocked on its side, a table crowded with tools, and something hanging from the rafters– a coat maybe, or a shape too still to be living. It all caught what little light there was and threw it back, dull and colorless.

Standing there, watching Mom try to hold herself together, I remembered another time I'd seen her this fragile. Junior year of high school. A school night. Our house was comfortable, but technically speaking, pretty small. That night, I was working on the 2nd law, when I heard a faint brush on the wall I faced. I stared at the wall, locking eyes with myself, a team photo from the past season. The brushing paused, and then a hard, damp sound hit not long after. Weeps ensued from the wood and plaster beyond me. The master bedroom held her grief that night, the sound of it seeping through the walls—desperate, pressurized, unable to escape..

I left my room, still wearing my clothes from practice that day, and looked to my left, down the hallway. There my father was, standing in the doorway to the master bedroom, where a dim and pale overcast of the ceiling light painted his shadow. He was looking at the ground, and then noticed me.

“Luke, I…” his eyes met mine. “You should go back in your room.” He lifted his head up, turning it to his right as he finished the sentence, as if to hide the tear sliding down his cheek. I never saw Dad cry often, he was the silent type. I stood there until Dad closed the door, soft as he could, as if sound itself would break her. I didn’t ask what happened that night, but later I found one of Grandpa’s letters on the kitchen counter, torn in half.

Now here we were, standing in the snow behind his cabin, and I recognized that same tremble in her shoulders that I’d seen before. Mom took two steps back. Her right hand pressed against her chest. Behind her back, her left hand was clenched so tight I could see the tendons standing out even through her glove.  “Mom..” I joined her side. “Do you want me to go in first?”

She sniffed, and brushed away the tear coming down her cheek. She didn’t always open up, but she didn’t hide it the way Dad did.  Mom collected herself “No,” 

She began confidently, “We’re doing it together.”

Part Two

The limbic system, that's what it's called; the part of the brain that welds memory to smell. When we stepped through the door, something in mine clicked. The air carried dust, pine and rot. I didn't recognize the place at first, not by sight. But the smell found its way in, and suddenly I was nine years old again—my birthday, the only time I'd met Grandpa Monty. I'd assumed we met at a restaurant, or maybe a park. But no. It was here. I'd been here before, playing army in these rooms while Monty smiled that half-smile and watched me run past doorways I should have looked through.

We moved in slow, careful steps, wading through the outlines of old tools scattered across the floor. Their shapes looked like they’d been waiting exactly where someone left them decades ago. Light from the door spilled forward just far enough to touch the first few feet, and then it died, swallowed by the dark. I pulled my phone from my back pocket, thumb hovering over the flashlight icon. When the beam came alive, the light looked wrong. Too thin, too pale against the walls.

“You know what, good thinking. I’m gonna grab mine from the car,” Mom said. Her voice was steady, but it trailed off fast. The screen door gave a hollow slap behind her. This air smelled wet, tasted wet, as if the cabin was a living organism and we were in its throat, waiting to be devoured. 

I swept the light along the wall. Frames lined it, slightly crooked, their edges softened by years of damp. The first one I stopped at was rimmed in swollen wood and glass chipped at the corner. The photograph beneath showed a woman I almost recognized. Not Mom. At her feet, a small dog blurred into motion. And beside her—Grandpa Monty, his arm around her shoulder, smiling that half-smile men wore for cameras when they didn’t want to be seen. I leaned closer. The photo’s surface shimmered faintly under the beam, and for a split second, I thought the woman’s eyes caught the light back.

The next one looked newer, just a few inches to the right. Its frame wasn’t rotted, and the glass caught my light cleanly, almost reflective. The photo showed the back of the cabin — the same clearing I’d just seen, the shed crouched behind it. But there was a difference. A workbench stood there that wasn’t outside anymore. Four thick legs, cross-braced and steady, the kind built to hold weight. On top lay what I first thought was a mannequin’s torso. Pale and unfinished, its surface caught the light in uneven patches, almost like a damp plaster beginning to dry. But the longer I looked, the harder it was to believe it wasn’t something more deliberate. The collarbones were too exact, the ribs faintly visible beneath a thin, skin-colored shell. Along the shoulder socket, strands of copper wiring curled outward, veins frozen mid-pulse. I leaned closer to the photo, squinting where the camera flash had caught a glint of metal beneath the flesh tone. The head wasn’t there. Just the hollow space where one should’ve been. Waiting.

I must have been standing there, staring at the haunting image before me for minutes until I snapped back. I turned around, and looked to see if Mom was approaching, then grabbed the picture off of the wall.  At that moment, a piece of paper playfully fell down to the carpet and brushed the tip of my snowboot. I picked it up and read it:

*“I remember the skin, texture, and the way it formed. Like something trying to shed. Misery finding a new body.”*

The handwriting was small and filled with intention, each letter pressed hard enough to leave a faint emboss on the back of the page. It wasn’t a note meant for anyone, maybe something written to remember, or to confess. The paper smelled faintly of smoke. I turned it over, half-expecting more, but the back was clean. My pulse quickened anyway. The air in the cabin felt heavier now, like the walls were breathing slower than I was.

Outside, I could hear the crunch of snow under Mom’s boots, getting closer with each one. I folded the paper, slipped it into my jacket pocket, and looked again at the photo. Then I heard the door creak behind me.

“Hey!” Mom walked in, brushing some fresh snow off of her coat “find anything good?” I tucked the photo in my coat pocket as she walked in. “Ah, didn’t want to spoil the fun so I figured I’d just wait for you.” She smiled, and turned on her flashlight. “Let’s do it then!”  We each took a few steps around, her heading right and myself walking up a bit more. The front room was filled with earthy tones, a stout brown floor and vivid forest-green walls. The ceiling fan was the type you never shut off, and a room you made family memories in. But this room had a table, one with a half-finished schematic laying beneath a coffee ring, the ink blurred where someone must’ve paused too long with their hand resting on it. Mom ran her hand across the table. The surface was smooth in a way that suggested years of repetition, the same motion made again and again.

“Hey Luke, I’m going to take a look through these boxes and totes, do you think you could see if this place has any power?” Mom motioned to the far side of the room, home to an hour’s worth of sorting and searching at least.  I watched her reach for the first one, labeled *Home*, and open it up. She pulled out what looked to be a few binders full of pictures, and some scrapbooks.  “Yeah, sure Mom. Let me take a look around.” I stood up and observed the familiar wall behind me, panning the beam of my flashlight over the same pictures I’d just finished looking at. 

The switch by the door didn’t do anything when I flipped it. The click of plastic sounded too loud in the silence, it didn’t belong here. I tried again, just to make sure, but the room stayed black except for the cones of our flashlights and the distant rays of the day sun. I followed the wall to where the outlet should’ve been. A small faceplate hung crooked from the drywall, wires behind it cut clean, not torn. I moved toward a narrow doorway that led into what looked to be a kitchen, it was cold in there. The kind of cold that came from time, not just temperature. My boots stuck slightly to the floor with each step, the wood warped in places, soft in others.

In the sink sat a mug, rim stained by rust. The spoon beside it was spotless. Above it, was a light switch panel. Four of them, actually, and each light had been labelled by a marker & some painters tape. I couldn’t quite make out their messy handwriting, so I leaned into them and brushed the dust off.

*Kitchen. Bedroom. Front Room. Basement.*

I tried all of them.. nothing. Just the same dull sound of moving plastic I’d heard only a few minutes ago. I aimed my flashlight at the far wall. A clock hung above the window. Its hands were still, but the second hand quivered, like a sore muscle trying to flex.  “Find anything?” Mom called from the other room. I glanced once more at the fuse box before answering. “Uh.. no power,” I said.  There was a pause, and then the soft sound of cardboard shifting. “Guess we’ll rough it, then.” Her voice sounded distant, coming through the walls instead of the air. 

When I turned to leave, I noticed the refrigerator. Non-magnetic. Older than Monty should've needed—the kind with a mechanical latch. I put my hand on it, felt the dust give way under my palm, and pulled. The door opened with a low groan of rubber and rust. Inside: three empty mason jars, their lids removed, arranged in a careful line. Nothing else. I let the door swing shut and turned toward the hallway. At the end of it was a lonely door grasping for life on its single, rotting hinge.  “I’m going to go check out the bedroom, then I’ll help you with those boxes, alright?” I called back out to her again, while walking past the doorframe back into the front room. 

“OK! I found a picture of your Dad and me when we were in college!” Mom announced to me as I walked past the door frame to the front room. Looking at my feet, the shade of the floor changed from the rest of the building. 

The hallway beside it felt like a suspended passage of time. As if I were walking a bridge from awake to asleep. It was host to more unrecognizable and eerie photographs from a time I couldn’t recognize. My light skimmed across the wallpaper, a faint floral pattern now yellowed and peeling in thin curls. Dust hung thick, turning my flashlight beam into something solid. The walls were lined with photographs, though none I recognized. Families caught mid-laughter, people standing before cars or porches that didn’t look like ours. Faces blurred just enough to make you doubt if they’d ever been sharp. Some were mounted slightly crooked, leaving faint rectangles of cleaner wall where others had been removed. The longer I walked, the more it felt as if these weren’t snapshots of moments, but of the house itself; its own memory trying to remember who had passed through.

I pushed the door open with my shoulder. It gave easily, but the sound it made wasn’t a creak, closer to a sigh, the quiet release of air from something sealed too long. The smell hit first: metal and something faintly sweet, like mildew wearing perfume. My light swept the area: a bed, a dresser, and a small desk crowded with papers. At first glance, it was just a room. Empty, still. But the longer I stood there, the more the quiet began to shape itself into something aware. The space wasn’t resting, but listening\*.\* The air pressed against my ears, thick with stillness. I traced the beam along the walls and found faint outlines where picture frames used to hang. Only one remained: a blurred photograph of the cabin from outside, the front window glowing faintly, the same room Mom was in now. Someone had taken it from the treeline.

I moved closer to the desk. Papers littered the surface. Some torn, some folded, a few with sketches that looked more anatomical studies than blueprints. At first I thought they were human–ribcages, hands, joints. But the lines that connected them weren’t arteries. They were wiring diagrams. The more I looked, the harder it became to tell where human anatomy ended and circuitry began. The handwriting that labeled each part was sharp and hurried, like someone documenting an experiment they didn’t want to remember.

Pinned above the desk were more drawings, this time on thin tracing paper. Each layer built on the next: bone, then wire, then flesh. A human spine annotated with voltage readings. A face half-erased and redrawn over and over, each attempt less human than the last. A small wooden box sat slightly ajar beside the stack. I lifted the lid, and a notebook slid forward. The pages were soft, the ink bled through. Every line was fractured. Timestamps, weather notes, single words like *awake*, *hearing*, *breathing,* and the phrase *Death learns shape*. The last few entries were written over each other until they were unreadable, black pools of ink soaking through the paper.

That’s when I heard it; a quiet, steady sound. Measured, but wrong. Not the wind. Not pipes. Something softer, patient. It was coming from the closet. I turned, my light trembling against the wall, battling the presence of the shadow. My hand hesitated, phone-light trembling. The air felt charged, as though the room itself was waiting for me to make a mistake. When I pulled the door open, the beam of my light collapsed  onto what rested inside. A ribcage the size of a man’s, carved from a pale resin that caught the light resembled wet, slippery bone. Wires looped through the ribs, coiling down into a hollow cavity where a heart should have been. At its center, something shifted. A small contraction, mechanical and reflexive. I stumbled back, catching the edge of the desk. Papers fluttered to the floor. The thing didn’t stop. Its chest rose again, then fell, a patient rhythm that didn’t belong to anything I knew.

And then it hit me. My lungs hitched. So did it. It breathed when I breathed.

Perhaps someone just starting out or in the middle of it will find this report helpful. My journey with Retatrutide (25 weeks). Used for a heavy cut after a six-month bulk. DMs/questions about the source will not be answered. I went gray.

 

F45, 1.78 (5'10""). Gym 3x a week last year, 2x a week 2 years before that.

Progressive overload, no cardio. 10,000 steps a day.

SW 84 kg (185 lbs) CW 65 kg (143 lbs) (BMI 26.5 to 20.5) Nicely toned, including very defined abs.

Lost 19.5 kg (43 lbs) in 25 weeks.

 

**History**

Gained 10 kg (22 lbs) in the 6 months of bulking. Before bulking, I was quite slim (with muscle), but not completely lean. I've now cut to completely lean, and there's no fat left, haha. The bulk went a bit too fast. I gained a lot of muscle, but also way too much fat. My next bulk will be much slower, and I'll use a small amount of Reta.

 

**Strategy:**

Over the past few weeks, I listened to what my body and mind needed. If I lacked sufficient suppression for a few days, I increased my dosage on the next injection day. If it wasn't necessary, I didn't. Food noise was gone from day 2.

 

**Mindset:**

Retatrutide is my willpower in a bottle. It helps immensely, but I still have to manage it myself. So: I can eat this, but I don't have to. I'm especially hungry after eating. So, on Reta, I can definitely eat more than I did now, but when I was on my calorie intake, the feeling of hunger disappeared half an hour after eating. I also deliberately only had one snack a day, around 4 p.m., because otherwise it would be too long until dinner. But if I did grab something at other times, out of habit, my body would get a reminder to eat, which would easily lead to overeating. But Reta made it very easy for me to ignore that, which I couldn't do without Reta. So, not eating makes it easier for me to stick with it than eating something. (So grabbing one cookie in between would then lead to cravings for two or three cookies, while simply not grabbing a cookie was easier with Reta and led to more weight loss.) This changed from week 21 onwards; I simply didn't feel hungry in between. So if I had increased my intake earlier, I would have experienced this sooner, but it wasn't really helpful for me, because I wanted to get enough protein. Reta also gave me very little craving for processed foods, but also no protein cravings; I really had to be mindful of what I chose.

 

**Besides Reta:**

Weeks 8 to 18: OTR-AC every evening, from 2.5 to 5.0 to 7.5 mg. I've used it before, and I know that once I increase the dose (above 5 mg), I get extra hungry, and my muscle response is very good. No other negative effects from this. But I definitely noticed the extra hunger. Without Ostarine, my Reta intake would have been lower.

 

From week 16 to week 23, I took KLOW every evening, 12 units of 3 ml Bac (so 2.0 mg GHK-Cu). The effect now is calmer skin and it seems a bit thicker. I think the effect is less pronounced than if I had gotten enough nutrients. In about two months, I'll do another 50-day KLOW.

 

Vitamins: Magnesium, Vitamin D & K2, multivitamin, fish oil, and extra zinc during KLOW.

 

I'm required to empty a 1-liter bottle of water every day, along with coffee and regular water in between. Diet: 130g protein per day, low in fat (65-80g), low in carbohydrates (60-75g). Daily intake between 1200 and 1500 kcal.

 

**Muscles/Energy/HR:**

Partly due to a good protein intake, strength training 3 times a week, and Ostarine, I only started losing muscle from week 22. For the first two months, weights and/or reps increased, then remained virtually the same for 2.5 months, and only started decreasing in the last three weeks. Energy decreased from week 20, felt cold from the first few weeks, and I needed more sleep from week 18.

HR: For the first few months, it fluctuate with my cycle, so it was elevated for part of the four weeks and then decreased again. However, my HR remained elevated last month. My normal HR is 57-63 for me, but last month I was around 73 daily. 

 

**Side effects:**

First week: Occasional low blood sugar (shaking, feeling the need to eat something right now). Solution: Eat a cracker. This was over in week 2. From the beginning: less need for coffee. No desire to buy things (online or in-store). Week 4: sunburn, especially on my thighs. Almost completely disappeared after 2 weeks, but it's still a little bit there. From week 21, regular watery diarrhea. No hair loss!

 

**Dose:**

Starting dose: 0.5 mg Reta twice a week

 

Week 3: 1.5 mg Reta every 5 days

 

Week 6: 1.75 mg Reta every 5 days

 

Week 9: 2.5 mg Reta every 5 days

 

Week 12: 3.0 mg Reta every 5 days

 

Week 16: 3.5 mg Reta every 5 days

 

Week 17: 4.0 mg Reta every 5 days

 

Week 21: 4.5 mg Reta every 5 days

 

Week 25: Weight loss program completed. Plan: I'll now reduce my dosage by 0.5 or 1 mg every five days, aiming for a maintenance dose of 0.5 or 1 mg. Or even lower if possible. But again, I'll listen to my needs. Nutritionally, I'll increase my dosage back to maintenance, followed by a slow lean bulk.",2,1771262170.0,Retatrutide,0,1.0,False

then a few times, james had started up a conversation. first time we ever talked he said ""i've definitely made your coffee before"" and i don't remember what i said, but probably laughed and said yeah or something. similar things kept happening. he never remembered my name but i could tell he remembered my face. 

then, i stopped going to that coffee shop for 6 weeks because of winter break. i came back, and james remembered me (he said welcome back) and he didn't remember my name but we had a short conversation 

so the next time i showed up, which was a week later, i sat at the counter against the bar. two girls sat next to me and were talking loudly about ceramics; i joined in the conversation for like 2 minutes. one of the girls apologized for the noise and for distracting me. james said ""yeah {my name} sorry,"" and i just laughed and said ""you're good"" and got back to work. i was just happy he remembered my name lol. as i'm studying, james came up to me and asked ""so  what are you working on"" and we talked about stuff for a bit. 

that whole night was a lot of pocket conversations with him and the other barista, alex. some highlights: 1) we had like light banter towards the end 2) he reccomended a lot of places for me to go eat in waco because he's from waco 3) when i asked for the baristas' names, i justified it by saying i was there a lot, and he said ""yeah you're here like every day"" which ouch lol but hey he noticed 4) i said i could only be there once a week because i can't afford a cup of coffee every day, james and alex spent time telling me how to spend less money there lol 5) when i said thank you and said ""i wish i knew this earlier because every time i'm here i order"" and i trailed off, james finished my sentence and said ""yeah you order a large iced sugary latte"" and i laughed and said ""yup pretty much it"". then i left. that was pretty good. 

then the second time i showed up, which was another week later (last wednesday), james waved at me when i walked up to the counter. his coworker took my order but yeah james reccomended me some tea. we talked a bit about our degrees, i told him i'm switching from business to literature, he told me about his film degree. i sat at the counter again. it was another day full of pocket conversations. 

a random guy hit on me by asking for my instagram, i gave it but gave a clear indication i was busy as to not like embarrasingly reject the guy but rather let him down easy. james called it ""smooth"" and i laughed and said ""i don't know"" and just went back to studying. james brought it up again, and i don't remember exact quotes or order of things said, but he told me that the guy was a regular and that was the most he'd heard him speak. i laughed and was like ""oh you know i laugh when i'm nervous so i hope i didnt' give the wrong impression ""blah blah blah, i told him that i have a hard time saying no on a good day so i didn't know what to do. james said i just looked confused. i told james that the guy asked for my instagram, and james said ""your instagram? not even your number? that's kinda juvenile"" or something along those lines. we bonded over the things we've done to deter people that hit on us. 

later i was telling him an uber driver story when his coworker/friend bill walked in, kind of interrupted in the middle of my story. i felt pretty embarassed so i got abck to working and told myself to like shut up. after bill and james were done talking though, james asked me what i was saying. i pretended not to remember. james brought up two specific details for the story, so i finished it up. more stuff happened, like light teasing. james yelped at some point and said ""ikd where that sound came from"" and i said ""i was about to say"" and i think i told him about how i snorted once during a job interview. another time we were talking about funny shirts, so i showed him a photo of me wearing my shrek shirt. he zoomed in on me and was like ""idk what you're looking at"" and i laughed and told him i was a lightweight but that was me 8 shots in. 

another time james was talking to bill and made a joke saying ""bill there's nothing wrong with your insides"" and i thought the suggestive part was funny and unconciously i side eyed james and he laughed and went ""don't look at me like that"" and i laughed and shrugged, and then two mintues later james came up and said ""okay so maybe what i said was a little weird' and i laughed and said ""i'm glad the self awareness is developing"" and he was like ""well i'm pretty self aware"" and i chuckled and was liek ""it's not all on you, i'm 21 i need to grow up "" or something.

 also at some point i was cold and bill went to the back and gave me an old jacket of his to wear. there was more stuff that happened but that was pretty much it. 

and then for the stuff that happened when my friend visited me this weekend: she said he recognized me while waiting in line. i was wearing the shrek shirt i had mentioned last week and he recognized it immediately, he said ""hey you're wearing the shrek shirt!"" and i laughed and said yeah. i was like ""how are you how was your valentine's day?"" and he said ""it was good i worked and then hung out with my cat, what about yours?"" and that's when i introduced him to my friend,. he asked how her day went, my friend (like a wingwoman) was like ""yeah i've just been hanging out with \[my name\]'s cat"" and thats how i found out my cat and james's are the same age lol. i showed him a photo of my cat and he awwed. and then i ordered cause there was a bit of a line behind me lol. he said he'd hand me the tea i ordered. 

and then yeah he asked if we were hanging out there for the day, i said no cause i had stuff to work on and then we were going hiking, and he said ""sounds more fun than working here"" and i laughed and that was kind of it for that. 

  
Yeah idk if he likes me, i feel like it's so ambiguous but like i really hope he does :)",1,1771262167.0,Crushes,1,1.0,False

The beginning of yesterday’s she was yapping about how much she hates her nails. Like girl why would you just get your nails done and choose like a silver colour? You’re going on vacation why wouldn’t you choose like a springy/sunny type colour?

Her mom comes by and brings her three dresses, two white ones and this like yellow one that Fran says she wore to her prom and she may wear it sometime again to an event if it fits.

Moving on she makes a coffee because they aren’t going to be there for a bit and she needs to try this new coffee. Adds in a whole bunch of ice and a tiny bit of this earths own caramel creamer and some sort of other milk that has their faces on it. Then goes on to say yum it’s good strong yaddy yadda 🤮.

She also was talking about taking the wagon with them instead of taking the stroller and the car seats because she said that her and Eden can’t handle the babies and all of the luggage (which is fair I get that) if they bring the stroller/car seats. So I’m curious on how they are going to get to the hotel/resort from the airport without car seats? Taxi? Shuttle? I don’t know if shed technically need them if they weren’t going to be driving in a car. I have a feeling she’s going to crash out at the airport when she has to bring all this stuff and actually has to help — unless she plans on having Eden do most of the hard work or her parents are dropping her off.

Then she goes upstairs and oh my goodness the amount of crap that they have that still is in boxes/totes is unreal. She went up looking for these hip carriers that they haven’t seen since they left LA. Going through totes and boxes, finds shoes that the babies had never even gotten to wear, saying they don’t have “aesthetic” looking shoes for dinner. Like they are kids, why can’t they just wear sandals or crocs to dinner?! She seems like SUCH a packrat/hoarder. Keeps every little thing and has trouble letting go of any little thing.

That’s all I’ve watched so far and I’ve only been watching from 20 hours ago and i started at 22 hours ago. She has to literally film herself talking to her phone for hours….

ETA — she’s talking now about needing to go to the tailor in the morning (this was 14hrs ago) so unless she filmed it earlier on in the weekend, nothing is going to be open today (Monday) because it’s family day. Also I’m not sure if most tailors are open on Sunday’s but I’m not sure.

ETA 2 — they left! 17 minutes ago and she was still packing and trying to figure out a cozy outfit for P to be in for the airport/plane 3hrs ago and said Jesse took the babies suitcase.

I’ve been working nonstop for the past three months, no Sundays, no holidays, just moving from one thing to the next without really stopping.

One of my co-PGs had other work, so I ended up covering two people’s load. By mid-day I was exhausted and overwhelmed. I was at the brink of tears. I kept thinking if someone asked me if I was okay, I probably wouldn’t hold it together. The day somehow passed.

After work I went to the gym thinking I would feel better. I came back around seven and the room felt very quiet. I usually don’t mind being alone. I don’t talk much anyway. But today I wanted someone to just sit and talk about nothing. I texted few friends. All of them busy with their lives.

Then my senior knocked and asked if I could come help him with something. We went to a print press, but another job was running, so we stepped out for coffee while we waited.

We sat there with hot cups and talked about random department stuff. Complained a bit. Laughed at something small. It wasn’t deep. He doesn’t know how close I was to breaking earlier.

1r6fe9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_EliSimpsonWrites/comments/1r6fe9v/the_manila_envelope/,The Manila Envelope,"*Written February 16, 2026 \~ 1446 words*

*CW: This story contains references to child sexual abuse (not depicted), trauma disclosure, and discussions of violence against abusers. Reader discretion advised.*

A thin, ugly manila envelope sat in the middle of the table, perfectly equidistant between the two women. The restaurant was quiet for a Saturday afternoon, but both were thankful for that. This conversation was already painful enough.

Lark wanted a divorce.

Marie wanted therapy.

The decision was a canyon between them, and they stood on opposite sides. Today, Lark wanted to build a bridge. Find a way toward reconciliation. But no therapy. That was a hard line.

Marie thrived on therapy. She’d confessed so many things she'd held close, things even Lark didn’t know. She should know those things, her therapist told her every session. Marie disagreed.

Their server, a young man who reminded Marie of a fox, returned to the table.

“Did we decide on drinks?” he asked cheerfully.

“Two shots of Don Julio 1942, extra chilled, pickle backs,” Lark said, her voice almost mechanical. “Actually, make it four, and I’ll have a double pour of Parker’s, neat.”

“Just a cosmo for me, sweetheart,” Marie said to the young man. He finished writing their order, said he’d be back in a few, and swept away to another table. Marie stared at her wife. “Four shots?”

Lark raised an eyebrow. Her silver contacts made it hard to read her eyes. “I can take all four. But I know you’re gonna want them, too.”

She was right. Marie made an ugly noise in her throat. She pushed a golden ringlet of hair that had fallen into her face back behind her ear. Turned her head so she could look outside. A light breeze tickled the trees that the restaurant had planted on its patio. It floated into the restaurant, warm, and shifted the envelope on the table. Lark fixed it.

“I don’t know what happened between us.” Lark’s voice was quiet, husky. It sounded so small. Marie reached a hand across and settled it on her wife’s. The callouses from years of woodworking and tools scratched at her. She smiled.

“I know, love. There are just… so many things I can’t tell you.”

“But you say them to your therapist.” Flat. Shit. “You tell them all about you.”

Marie drummed her fingers on the table, the short dusky blue nails clacking in a stuttering rhythm. She crossed her legs. Uncrossed them. Crossed them again. Put her hands to her forehead and looked down. Back up to Lark, who sat there, impassively, staring.

“RBF,” Marie had called that face. Full, round cheeks. Hazelnut hair. Pink gauges in her ears (Lark *could* have fun). But always so serious.

“It’s easier,” Marie confessed. “They don’t judge.”

“Everyone judges.”

“Not Loren. They let me talk. They don’t editorialize or minimize.”

“Have I ever done that to you?” Lark questioned sharply.

Marie flinched back in her chair. Praised all the known and unknown gods when their drinks arrived. They threw back the first shots of tequila immediately. Let the rest of the drinks settle on the table.

“Chef has an amazing appetizer today. Seared prime rib with a habanero-coffee glaze. Could I put that in for you?”

Marie dabbed the corner of her mouth where saliva threatened to spill out. “Yes. Definitely. That sounds amazing.”

“It really does,” Lark agreed.

“Temp?”

“Whatever Chef recommends,” the women said in unison. Their eyes found each other. Giggles erupted. Their server—Bobby, Marie remembered suddenly—chuckled with them, bemused at a joke he had no context for. He excused himself. Laughter subsided. Maybe the posts were in the ground for that bridge.

Lark’s fingers circled her whiskey, teasing the liquid in the exact way she would tease Marie in bed. “Remember when we first got together? How you’d barely let me touch you? You swore you would tell me why. Begged me to give you time. That was ten years ago, Lamb.”

A tear escaped, streaking down Marie’s face. That had come when they’d first met. A noisy event during Pride. Lark had misheard her name. Called her Mary for weeks before Marie had finally put a stop to it.

“Marie, Lark. My name is Marie. Not Mary who had little lambs.”

Lark had stared, then guffawed, and declared, “You’re my little Lamb.”

Red had bloomed on Marie’s chest. They didn’t make it to bed before she’d stripped Lark naked and showed her how much she liked that nickname.

“Lamb? Marie?”

Lark was a blurry blob when Marie looked at her again. She was holding the second shot out, and Marie took it from her, fingers sliding against Lark’s. The shots disappeared, then the sweet-and-salty pickle juice. Marie’s vision cleared.

“I… That… Lark.” Marie swallowed thickly. Sipped her cosmo. She gulped a breath that stabbed her throat and let it out slowly. “I was in the foster system for a long time, remember? They took me from my biological parents. They…”

Marie fanned herself, tears welling in her eyes. She shivered. Lark got up, came and stood beside her, and wrapped her muscled arms around Marie. “It’s okay, babe. I’m here.”

“They used my body.”

Lark’s grip tightened into a bear hug.

“Let their friends do it.”

Lark growled.

“I… I’m sorry I never told you.”

Lark didn’t respond, just kept holding. Placed a delicate kiss on Marie’s cheek. “I have something to show you.”

Marie nodded. Whined when Lark let go. Dabbed her eyes, hoping her mascara was fine. When she dropped the white linen on the table, it was covered in black. Damn it. She bet she looked more like a raccoon than a lamb now.

Lark was grabbing the manila envelope. Marie’s shoulders drew together, and her knees slammed together. She rubbed her arms. The breeze from the patio seemed to bite now.

A newspaper article came out of the envelope, that weird gray color that meant Lark had actually touched paper instead of a screen. She held it out, and Marie took it, the paper rustling in her hands. A caption suggested an image had been cut off. It read, “Mr. and Mrs. Pierson, 54 and 47, seen here in their booking photos.”

Pierson. Her parents. The biological ones.

“Lark… What is this?”

“Read.” Lark was next to her again, body pressed closely, a hand rubbing her back gently.

Marie whispered as her eyes scanned the article. “Mr. George Pierson and Mrs. Janice Pierson (née Hatfeld) were found dead in their home on Monday morning. The couple had previously been incarcerated for crimes against children. Their estranged son, Jackson O’Malley, 25, was arrested and charged with murder. Police report that he was the one to call them.”

Marie turned to her wife, wrapped her arms around her neck, and nuzzled into the muscle there. “Thank you.”

“I’ve hired a lawyer for Jackson.”

“You didn’t have to.”

“Marie. Babe. Lamb. I love you. I don’t wanna lose you. Just talk to me, okay?”

“How did you know their names?”

“Jackson is on my crew, dipshit. You begged me to hire him. Great kid, hard worker. He told me everything.”

“How long?”

“Have I known?”

Marie could only nod.

“Three years.”

Marie gasped. “You never said anything?”

“Not my thing to talk about, is it?”

“And here is that prime rib for you—Am I interrupting?” Bobby had returned, and he looked apologetic.

“No,” Marie said wetly. “Just a couple having a moment. Thank you, Bobby, sweetheart. Um… Why don’t you come back in twenty minutes, and we’ll be ready to order some entrees, yeah?”

He nodded and left. Lark returned to her seat. Marie took a bite of the prime rib and mewled. The appetizer was gone in minutes. Lark agreed it was amazing. Said they would get a second one to come before their entrees.

“You know,” Marie started, “I thought those were divorce papers in the envelope.”

Lark looked as if she’d been slapped. “Why the hell would you think that?”

“You’ve been talking to a lawyer… Oh. OH! Oh my god.” Marie groaned. “Jesus fuck, I’m an idiot.”

“No, you’re not. You lacked fundamental context and made a judgment leap. Probably why you should tell me about things, hmm?” Lark could be too matter-of-fact sometimes (when she was less fun).

“I still feel stupid. Don’t say anything. Just let me have this.” Lark shrugged. “What do we do now?”

“We order. We eat. You tell me things. I tell you how much the lawyer costs. You probably yell, but then we go home, and I’m going to do very nasty things to your body. Agreed?”

Marie grinned as she nodded, swallowing the last bit of her cosmo.

They followed Lark’s plan to a tee, and when Marie woke the next morning, she was wrapped in her wife’s arms. ",1,1771261799.0,u_EliSimpsonWrites,0,1.0,False

# Grandeur Theft

******

“So, no go on getting this thing moving?” I asked for the fifth time. I hated how stupid it made me sound, to just not take ‘no’ for an answer, but I had no other bright ideas kicking around.

“If you two are wanting to charter it, that would be fine, but today’s not the day for that. I’m not going to take it out without a full crew, too. They’ve been hard to recruit since we lost the cannons and had to patch the ship up in a ‘full restoration’…” he got a distant look in his eye. “Anyway, you two still haven’t fully explained who you are. You didn’t even know there was a process for reserving it?” he tried again.

The ‘Captain,’ a groggy man in ruffled pajamas who’d stormed out of the aft cabin after we’d fired up the engine, kept *politely* demanding we get off his ship. As firmly as an ardent loyalist could bring himself to demand a shil’vati noblewoman do anything, of course. Which was to say he was tripping over himself to be polite and never press too hard, never quite say ‘no,’ only to always falter at Natalie’s more imperious demands which seemed to me to be so much theater. Every time he looked away I caught a glimpse of how nervous she was, how she fought to keep her feet still and hips from swaying.

“Alright,” I said, pointing at Natalie again. “That’s a noblewoman.” That should be enough, right?

Admittedly, neither of us looked like we commanded much authority at all, both of us still wet in the hair from our mistakes coming down the Brandywine.

We hadn’t exactly cleaned ourselves up, because we hadn’t expected anyone to be aboard at all at this hour.

At least I’d had the foresight to leave Hex and Binary behind at the bridge with a fervent promise to return soon. The only thing that had Hex back off was the realization that Elias Sampson and a Shil’vati noble girl hijacking the rescue launch off the back of the Kalmyr Nyckel with the cooperation and assistance of armed and masked insurgents, would probably raise eyebrows and bring in unwelcome questions if any cameras caught sight of us. Ones we wouldn’t have good answers to. Ones that Morsh might not even bother asking before opening fire when she came to evaluate our performance.

“The Shil’vati took [*HMS Victory*](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/HMSVictoryPortsmouthEngland_%28version_2%29.jpg/960px-HMSVictoryPortsmouthEngland_%28version_2%29.jpg) and flew her halfway across the galaxy, and she was a *lot* bigger than the [*Kalmyr Nyckel*](https://imgs.search.brave.com/wXZ2AmWxWEwhelkm7Mek_i7VTBMbIdzNrvDNgREAc9g/rs:fit:860:0:0:0/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cu/dmlzaXR5b3JrdG93/bi5vcmcvSW1hZ2VS/ZXBvc2l0b3J5L0Rv/Y3VtZW50P2RvY3Vt/ZW50SUQ9ODMwMQ). Frankly, and I apologize if I’m wrong, no, I don’t know you from a private and her lover.”

“Tell you what,” Natalie said. “I know who’s been bankrolling the repairs.” That did seem to get his attention, especially when she added: “She sent me here to check on your progress.”

“You’re joking,” his eyes widened slightly, and he started casting nervous looks around the ship, probably to where repairs weren’t fully completed even after a couple years’ work.

“Lady Villpenn,” she responded with confidence, dragging up a name I hadn’t expected to ever hear again.

The Captain stood up completely straight until he stretched the clothes he must have slept in. “Alright…” he said, trying to process how in the world Natalie knew that bit of trivia, before coming a conclusion. I hoped that he would comply. “If you are who you say you are, we didn’t take out the auto-steer and sonar just yet. Maritime regulations are proving a problem and we don’t want to do it if we’re going to just have to undo its removal with no funding.”

“Autosteer?” I asked, and both of them stared at me. “Sorry, I wasn’t briefed.”

“Y’know, just punch in the coordinates, let it steer. The part that interfaces with the steering oar-” he gestured at a giant wooden beam that was belowdecks. “That part’s offline and packed away, but not uninstalled completely. We’re still waiting for the outcome of the foundation’s final round of exemption approval from the Interstate Maritime Board.” Probably some new layer of bureaucracy desperate to insist on itself before ‘the old ladder’ was kicked down.

“I…see,” Natalie clearly had played her last card and was stalling, and desperately searching for some way to segue to at least letting us use the launch. “The…emergency procedures though, those are valid and tested?”

“All clear and used yesterday. Didn’t you read that report?”

We were getting nowhere and the sun was getting higher. At a certain point we needed to act, and he was going to get suspicious.

*Oh fuck it.*

I exchanged a glance with Natalie, who drummed her long fingernails on the top deck’s railing.

“How good of a swimmer are you?” I asked.

“Uh, I’m a proficient one, lifeguard certified, why-” and then without any further warning she gave him a good shove over the edge. I saw him grasp for the railing only for his grip to fail, sending him toppling over it and falling into the Christina River. He came up cursing and paddling ashore- toward the stern.

Sure, stealing the launch had been Plan A, and it had required getting aboard in the first place. But now he was swimming around the back of the vessel, where the launch hung on a winch I couldn’t hope to get down before he’d be marching back across the gangplank in fury.

“Not again!” I heard him howl in a voice promising vengeance as the vessel started slowly pulling off from the dock. “You vandals, you…pirates!”

“Casting us off!” I shouted, already untying the two ropes that held the vessel to the dock.

The motor may have been at idle, but the ship immediately began to slide against the dock. This close to shore, I knew what I had to do.

I ran down the belowdecks down to the steering oar, pulling it toward myself with a mighty heave. It fought and fought, until at last it inched across. “We’re turning!”

“Where?”

And so it was that a few minutes of frantic figuring later, Natalie and I found ourselves on the high seas, or at least the closest to it I’d ever been while Natalie joyfully sang out instructions from the crow mast or foredeck, wind in her hair as she whooped gleefully.

We pulled past the ruins of an old train bridge stuck open, then a minute later we were past the piers of the interstate, and at last through the port. With a war whoop we were out and in the breezy sunny morning.

******

It took some doing- as gentle a beaching as I thought to manage, taking it at an oblique angle until we finally came to a stop. Some wading through waist-high water, stomping through the muck, and then a shared moment of victory.

Natalie held her wrist-omni high, and pressed the button to summon Morsh.

“You did it?” Morsh got to the point immediately.

“We’re ashore in New Jersey,” was all Natalie stated, a little bit of that familiar anxiety in her voice now that the adrenaline had worn off. 

“I’m already on my way,” Morsh said.

“LZ Secure,” Natalie responded, then the call ended.

We had a few minutes together on the grass. We relished in our victory together with a well-earned kiss. When we came up for air, she asked: “Now what?” And I turned to stare with her, hand-in-hand, at the sailing ship laying increasingly on its side as the waters receded.

“We’re likely in *some* sort of trouble,” I muttered.

“We’re just lucky there aren’t cameras here to prod us with questions.”

“Why would there be? Aren’t I, or rather, isn’t Delaware blacklisted for media publicity?” I remembered the floating camera drones from the Award Ceremony, which felt like a lifetime ago.

“Mom got a new request for more videos two nights ago. We’re lucky she didn’t commission any to follow us. Some family houses stage their entry exam and do over the top stunts. They submit it system-wide, like an action-flick. It’s in poor taste and only really impresses idiots. And if you need idiots to follow you, you really don’t have much, do you?”

Likely, being the ‘first human to Vanguard’ trumped whatever qualms the Interior had about boosting Delaware. Alternatively, my plans to keep Delaware quiet as Emperor and not pull off anything loudly impressive while we geared up had let them put the lid on the story to the broader galaxy, covering other zones around Earth for a bit.

“Depends. Idiots tend to do things like this, don’t they?” I gestured back at the Kalmyr Nyckel.

“I wouldn’t worry. I know Masarie well enough, she’ll be a bit annoyed, but nothing too bad. Once Morsh gets here, we can just smooth the whole thing over.”

“Masarie Villpenn’s really backing this?”

“She loves ships and sails. Plus, she bled all over it. That has to count for something.”

*The venn diagram of our social circles is overlapping a little too much for my liking.* I also wasn’t sure I liked leaning on noble privilege to escape the not-so-insignificant fact that we’d just stolen an oceangoing vessel, which I was pretty sure constituted some sort of felony. The more I thought about it and looked at the beached *Kalmyr Nyckel* the more uneasy I felt about what I’d just done.

*Oh come on. If they find out the rest about your crimes, the boat will be the last of your worries. Still, you made it this far by keeping a low profile, and that was NOT.*

My self-chastisement was disrupted by a rapidly growing dot in the sky. The Rakten family car circled overhead, as if its occupant could not quite believe what she was seeing while Natalie and I smiled and waved.

“Masarie said she had no idea about its reputation as basically a cavorting love-deck and wanted just a ride on a sailing ship. I remember her saying she was disappointed.” I also forgot that a million bucks went for about a thousand of theirs. Small change for a noblewoman, even one as young as her. Natalie’s omni-pad gift to me probably cost more than the sum total of Masarie’s investment. Pretty mind-blowing.

The car set down, and the bodyguard stepped out, muscular frame framed by the morning sun as she stared past us at the beached vessel.

“We passed,” I called out.

“That’s what, three ships you’ve stolen in the last year? You’re practically part Roach.” Natalie hung her head, and Morsh mussed her hair. “It was a compliment.”

“Made it here a day early,” I proclaimed proudly, standing atop a stone that jutted out from the grassy ground.

“You definitely skimmed the rules’ edges. But I’m proud of you, kid,” she mussed Natalie’s hair.

“Elias did-”

“I could not have done that on my own,” I butted in, not caring one iota if it was rude as long as it cut her self-deprecation off. “From where the steering oar had been, I had no chance of seeing anything. You had to call down instructions to me. You figured out the depths and buoys. I don’t think I could have gotten down the river with that half-assed canoe by myself, either, for that matter.”

Just holding it overhead had been difficult. Maybe I could have walked myself overland to arrive on the Delaware side of the river’s shore with a spare day, but then what? I wouldn’t have dared trying to run across the city at night while dressed in alien garb.

Natalie stared back at me. What? It was all true. Besides, I wasn’t going to take the fall, either. We either rose or fell, together.

“Well, either way. You two made it to the LZ. That does not mean you are safe, you have to clear the LZ of all hostiles.”

I assumed a combat stance before Natalie could figure out what was going on- and saw Morsh’s determination. She moved. Fast. I was faster.

I might have been tired, low on sleep, but I was not going to let Natalie get hurt on my account. I’d pushed her to rise early with me, to take a chance on me, to *trust* me. I shoved my girlfriend out of the way before Morsh could focus on her.

I’d expected Morsh to keep laying it onto the startled Natalie, but she instead rounded on me, stepping over my flattened girlfriend. My arms were a blur as we fought through the sandy grasses, desperate to keep her from connecting.

*Check her kick, keep moving back. Watch your distance. Even with her reach, even sleep-deprived, you outnumber her and can outlast her. Don’t close until you’re sure.* But she had me on the back foot and I was fast running out of space again, being pushed toward the muck, where I’d start getting bogged down.

I jumped off a stone backwards to make more distance, inviting her to try and do the same where I might catch her in midair, or for her to step around and let me circle the rock so she’d reset all her progress in cornering me, only for her to take a long stride over it. I managed a light tag on her leg, but it practically glanced off her strong armored thigh, and I had to pull it back before she could make a grab for my foot.

I was tiring fast after all I’d put myself through. Worse, Natalie hadn’t popped back into the fight, meaning I was still fighting Morsh alone.

I couldn’t feint past her and escape, she was onto that trick, even if every half-measured glance and indication forced her to head off the possibility with a shift in her weight, a pivot in her heel, or a kick slightly mis-aimed just on the possibility I’d follow through.

All of which was helping me survive her assault. It just wasn’t enough. I needed to accept that help was not coming.

I decided to replicate the stone trick, and leaped off a fallen tree’s trunk backward, aware I didn’t have that much more ground to give. It did give me something to put between us, and I used her stepping over it to finally step in and land a clean blow on her chin and try for a follow-up shin kick that she raised her leg to counter, before then stepping forward on it and tried hip-checking me into where the sand turned soft. She turned to swipe the newly arrived Natalie clean off her feet with a swatting motion. I hadn’t even realized Natalie was there, and just like that she was back out of the fight again.

*I need to be even faster!*

I rolled with the blow to stagger back toward the fallen trunk and swung around on a branch that jutted upward, leaping off and launching a flying kick that was far higher than she probably expected it to be. Still, she reached for my outstretched foot- but I pulled it in at the last moment, her hand grazing my boot. I wrapped my arms around her neck and *pulled* the Amazonian warrior off her feet, in a replica of how she’d fallen for it the first time we’d fought.

She managed to catch herself despite the awkward angle, but now we were on the ground together, and I had the advantage simply by having expected us to end up like this. I got around her grasping hand, pinning it against the middle of her back. I thought I had her, only to go slack-jawed as she pushed against the ground and lifted both of us on a one armed push-up, and then rolled. It would have pinned me under her if I hadn’t let her go.

*Not fair!*

I took a few steps back, watching in awe as she gave me an upside down smirk as she transitioned from the push-up to doing a one-armed handstand, then pushed off of that to land on her feet.

“Alright,” I conceded, relaxing from my combat stance. “You’re strong. And coordinated.”

“And *you* move like a fighter,” she pointed accusatorily.

*Busted. Play it off.*

“Thank you,” I moved to bow theatrically and she cut me off.

“Don’t credit my training. Don’t even try. Nothing about what you just did was in any of our sessions. You managed your distance. You checked my kicks, always keeping your weight off your foreleg even though it weakened your punches. You made me break spacing twice, and each time, you capitalized. If you had your knife out, you could have gotten me. You tried to pin me by freezing an arm behind my back and lock it in place, in a move I certainly never taught you. Again, if you’d been armed, you could have slid it into my back or side.”

I froze up and felt my smile grow a little brittle. “Well, if you rely entirely on your training, you can become predictable. I saw a window of opportunity, and I took it.”

“I reviewed the records from Lesha teaching the recruits at Fort Delaware. Do you know how many of them gave her trouble?”

I shrugged. “Half?” She was a little bit on the thicker side, and by now I was surely taller than her, though it had been a few months since I’d last seen her.

“Five, total. Most of them were part of the former armed forces and local police. And Lesha’s…” Morsh sucked in a breath. “Well, she’s not Amilita. And Amilita’s not me.”

“And I gave you trouble?” I asked for confirmation. I couldn’t steer Morsh off, so I wanted to hear it.

“You could. And I want to know why.”

I smiled and stretched my knuckles. “Well, we can keep going and see how much trouble.”

Her smile matched my own.

“Or,” Natalie wheezed, apparently having caught her breath from when Morsh had swatted her like a gnat, holding up her omni-pad. “You two can stop your tit-measuring and look at this.”

“Kid, whatever it is, I promise it can’t be more important than-” The jingle that came from the omni-pad cut her off. “Alright, I guess not,” she shrugged and relaxed her stance, not taking her eyes off me. “But you and I are going to have words.”

“No, you’re not,” Natalie said shortly. She held out her omni-pad, and *immediately* had Morsh’s rapt attention.

# Don’t Lose Your Head

“People of earth,” the speaker began. He had small tusks, practically filed sharp, and wore an undeniably regal outfit that accentuated his flat chest and narrow hips, giving a little flair to his frame. Still, I’d seen finely dressed noblemen before, and even met a few. There was something distinctive about his outfit, or maybe it was just the way he wore it, though he couldn’t have been much older than I. And now that I evaluated him instead of what he wore and the massively ornate chamber in which he stood, he almost had the same cocksure smugness that Alic'tran had. Almost unbecoming, really.

There was a text box option to switch to English, and that meant this was a dual-broadcast, the kind of rare thing reserved for genuine emergencies. “My name is Ruhwe Thenah. I am the crown prince of the royal family. I come to you, our newest members of the empire, to find the world alight in fury. You are correct to be angry. You have been failed by our chosen and appointed representatives. Rest assured, there are punishments for such failures, and today I address you to deliver it personally, so that none may doubt the crown’s resolve in addressing your concerns and needs.”

He didn’t move an inch, instead letting the camera pull back to reveal the throne room of immaculate polish- and someone who was waiting at his feet. Bound, gagged, and held still by a muscular pair of guards was a young shil’vati woman, scarcely any older than he.

“I bring you the last known lady of house Ministriva,” he crowed, at last making a half-step toward her and pulling free a spare blade from the guard’s hip.

The internet’s shock sites and then unfiltered combat footage had desensitized me to death over a screen until I was numbed. In the year and change since I’d personally seen and contributed to countless more lives ended in so many ways. It’d probably take all afternoon and even some help to try and recount them all.

Even so, this was going to be hard to watch.

Maybe it was the way the fight hadn’t quite completely gone out of her, the way the mouth trembled as she silently begged for her life. Her bright eyes looked up at the camera in a desperate plea I couldn't answer, even if I'd tried.

“My word is as law. I carry out this punishment in the name of the crown!”

I was riveted to the spot. Natalie’s head jerked to the side and I found myself bracing her, hands around her arms and giving her comfort when she blanched even as she forced herself to try and continue watching.

The blood sprayed and ran across the floor, never quite finding purchase as it slid across the painstakingly polished surface. He himself was stained by the act, the blood soaking into his fine robes. At no point did the prince release his grip after having taken the noblewoman's life.

The omni-pad zoomed back in, his bloody work complete as he stared into the camera, still holding the blade. “The guilty parties are being found, and the missing children returned. The eye of the Empire is here to make right all that is wrong. Lay down your arms, you have no further reason to fight.”

I had this idea for an app where you can propose a plan to your friends or a group of friends. They get a notification saying ""John proposed going for sushi on friday"".  

  

You would open the app, and you will have a pile with plans (or just a few if you are not very popular xD) and you can swipe right or left to say, ""i am in or I pass"". Kind of Tinder but for plans that your friends propose, if you swipe yes and there is enough people automatically the plan is confirmed and sync with your calendar.

This way i want to make plans reality. Not just words. Not sure if this will add value to the market, there are some apps like partiful or howbout doing this but I feel like they are aim for big events or serious organization. My idea would be more like fast planning with close friends. I vibe coded a landing page where everything is explained perfectly, it is just a dummy page, the app doesnt exists yet.

Do you actually find group chat planning annoying, or have you just accepted it as part of life?

What’s the biggest plan killer for your friend groups? (Scheduling, choosing a place, or just lack of follow-through?)

1r6f49l,https://www.reddit.com/r/MetalTea/comments/1r6f49l/chad_kroeger_part_one_the_catfish/,Chad Kroeger part one - the catfish,"Chad met me indirectly through his guitar tech who helped me get a kid who had leukemia with a children's cancer charity I was volunteering for in Toronto since 2008 called Coast to Coast Against Cancer backstage at AC/DC.  Make a Wish said he had his wish at 12 to go to Disneyland and so even though he had survived leukemia for 5 years which is pretty much unheard of they wouldn't help him.  17 year old wishes are so much different than 12 year old wishes so I began trying my hardest to make this come true.  Trying to get ahold of AC/DC Management is like trying to get into fort knox so .. thanks to a man named Tom S. the tour manager of Alice in Chains Chuck R and the guitar tech for Angus, who has also been the tech for Prince, Metallica, Richie Sambora, Chad Kroeger and so many others....we got him and his family in 2009 backstage and even though he didnt get to meet the band he was treated like a king and his leukemia went into remission for 6 amazing months of which he spend cycling and raising money for the charity Coast to Coast Against Cancer.

I began a tradition and whenever the guitar tech was in town I would send two pounds of fresh roasted coffee to the venue for him.  First time with Bon Jovi then Nickelback.  

  
I never expected anything back however was offered free tickets on many occasions mostly to Bon Jovi and was always grateful.

  
In 2012 I was given tickets to Nickelback twice.  I am Canadian so I was a fan of the band since the beginning and went to the show and had a great time.  Chad was married or engaged around then to Avril so never met the band or heard from (or expected to hear from) Chad or anyone else in the band, just thought it was a friendship between me and the guitar tech.

  
In 2014 around thanksgiving (which is when Chad and Avril were getting a divorce) I started getting messages from a guy named Jean Luc (chad is a big sci fi/superhero/videogame freak) who told me he was from Waterloo Ontario and that he had just lost his wife and child during childbirth.  

this was a  reference to the fact of the failed marriage and that they were going to become duet partners starting with the song that has only been played once at their wedding ""If I Say I Love You"".

  
He told me that he had BMW motorcycles, food allergies (Chad is allergic to gluten) and that him and his mom were about to buy a property in Whistler BC - which seemed odd since he said he was from Kitchener Ontario. 

I put the pieces together and realized it was Chad later however at the time was taking it at face value and in 2015 when Nickelback was coming to Toronto I asked him if he wanted to come with me to the show and he said no so there was a snowstorm that night and I lived 3 hours from the venue so opted not to go.

  
Got a catfish email from a stranger who said that Nickelback should add ""never again"" to their setlist again.  Meaning I had stood Chad up and he was never going to do it again.

  
I never thought anything about it really except that maybe Chad wanted to be friends and stayed supporting the band and defending them from the haters.

That is when the catfishing started again with a Ukranian guy who said he was a Nickelback fan but loved Lamb of God and Thy Art Is Dying which are both bands that are in Chad's top 10.  

I knew it was him after he asked me about a tshirt Chad wore that had a ribcage made of feathers and asked me what my interpretation of it was.   To which I replied that I believed the shirt represented the fragility of the human existence and that we are all just feathers in the wind.

Next thing I knew that Tshirt was part of the Hard Rock Nickelback display case under Chad's name.

I also shared a semi sexy photo of myself that I was pretty proud of since it was taken when I was 42.  I was in a man's undershirt and under a cold shower so obviously my nipples were errect.

Chad the catfish complimented me  on the image and I told him that my breasts were implants and he said I had a great surgeon.

Chad ended up using that image of me to sell alcohol and swag as well as had a woman who was claiming to be my best friend even though I had hired her for a graphics job in 2009 and she told me she had just been diagnosed with breast cancer - so I stayed in contact for moral support.

I found out in 2022 that she was hired by Lars Ulrich to stalk me and faked her death in 2018 to have over $300,000 in cosmetic surgery to look like me paid for by Lars and Elon Musk to try and lure Chad away from me and seduce James Hetfield 

Chad and James met Evelyn Shifflet in 2019 after all the surgeries had been done and James moved her into a property near my home that he had purchased to housesit when he could not be there.

Evelyn had sexual relations with both James and Chad from 2019 to 2023 - got James drinking again.

What people dont know is that Chad is either gay or bisexual and has always been in love with James Hetfield.

In late summer fall of 2022 Chad and Evelyn got James really drunk and seduced him into a bisexual threesome where Evelyn took pictures that Chad threatened James with in 2023 - which is blackmail.

Chad had been taking Evelyn out on the road with Nickelback not only to promote the alcohol - also using my vocals that had been recorded up my country versions of Nickelback songs, some honky tonk tunes and NEM by Metallica.

Evelyn was performing onstage lipsynching in an man's undershirt and cut off jean shorts saying she was me.

Apparently she also stole images off my hacked facebook page and filtered her face over them as well as opened an only fans and sold tshirts of the images pocketing the money and laundering it through her friends and family.

Chad knew all about it and so did James - Chad also stole a bunch of intellectual property ideas from me including a farm to table restaurant, green casino and online dispensary.

In fall of 2023 Chad was denied entry to a Pantera (his favourite band) party at the Metallica 27 season shows and that is when he threatened to show everyone the photographs of him and James being intimate that Evelyn had taken.",1,1771261217.0,MetalTea,0,1.0,False

My wife claims she can't taste it and says the coffee is good. 

  
The burrs are quite new, probably no more than 750g of beans through, so this could be the reason. 

  
I'm just confused because it happens when I grind coarsely and the coffee runs through in 15s, but also if I grind very fine and it runs through in 40s. 

  
Does anyone have a clue what could be causing this? I have read that the fines from conical burrs can overextract instantly and leave a nasty taste. But if this is the case, then every shot from conicals should taste bad, no?

The folks there were very welcoming and at some point we decided that it would be nice to hold a gettogether so we could get to know each other and share our experiences over a cup of coffee.

1r6f0v4,https://www.brcdomesday.org/,2025 Domesday Book (Camp Map Viewer),"This is the first year version of the BRC Domesday Book, a viewer of Burning Man theme camps. It starts with a zoomable/scrollable map of the city with every placed camp marked, and you can zoom in on any camp. I've tried to collect as much data about the camps as I can from public records. That includes Burning Man APIs with camp details and event schedules. If the camp has submitted a URL to a website, I've tried to link to that and show thumbnails of any camp images located at that URL so you can get a feel for what the camp looks like and feel like (I think I found images for about half the camps). The list of events also includes events from past years and gives you a pretty good idea of what a camp's offering is meant to be.   
  
If you're exploring camps that might be a good fit for you, this might be a fun way to browse whats out there (certainly easier than the org's [giant alphabetical list](https://history.burningman.org/brc-history/theme-camp-archive/)). Also a neat way just to browse your old neighborhood.

There is also a search feature, which searches semantically, so you can find Yoga camps and Coffee camps as well as searching by name.

For nerds and geeks - here's a little bit about the technology behind the site...

The Burning Man organization only [releases](https://innovate.burningman.org/) ""nearest intersection"" location information for camps, not exact borders. That's why you probably got a little bit lost trying to find that camp with the address ""C & 3:15"", an address which includes ALL the mid-block camps between 3:00 and 3:30. But the placement team produces a PDF file in vector format that more-or-less accurately shows the borders of the camps. With that file I had to correct about 10 situations where the vectors were not proper closed shapes. Inside that file, the actual camp names are present, but they are also vectors, not text, and were not at all amendable to OCR. I ended up creating a little utility that essentially uses me, a human, as the OCR, to identify which site was associated with which closed polygon. By pre-populating the utility with an alphabetical list of known camps this utility had great autocomplete, so I was able to identify 1500 camps borders with less than an hour of work.

The next part of this process was building a web scraper to go out and find camp images, reduce them to thumbnails, and upload them to s3. This too required human intervention through a curatorial process that consisted of, again, me, looking at screens full of thumbnails of pictures that ""might"" be a camp, and deciding which ones to include. The images that the web scraper brought back included:

* random images of not-the-camp, for example, a theme camp might have set up a URL website using a template and all the pictures are stock photography
* images from the camp's website that are also not the camp, like the picture of the crew in their backyard in Oakland making a janky shower
* images from the camp's website of burning man in general
* images of a single camper, probably at Burning Man, but no matter how beautiful they were that was not really a picture of the camp

So I built a curator website that shows me up to 128 pictures at a time of a camp and I manually went through and checked off the ones that I thought were portraits of what you would see if you went to that camp. I didn't always do it perfectly and there were some editorial decisions (for example, for art car support camps, if I could tell what was going on, I allowed pictures of the art car on playa, not in camp).

Camps that only had social media sites were a big problem too. This reflected about half of all camps, and the popular platforms Facebook and Instagram get very angry about anyone downloading images. If your camp's only form of archived photography and history is owned by a company called ""Meta"", you're cutting yourself off from your own history, culture, and legacy. Stop it. Make a web page at a domain you own.

One final source for camp images, especially for legacy and famous camps, was the org's [gallery](https://gallery.burningman.org). Here I had to rely on text search and their search feature is not very modern or robust (I think they use SQL `like` tbh) but it did get nice pictures for a lot of camps.

In future years, I would like to expand the domesday map to include playa art as well as theme camps. If you would like to help, I could use the help! Check out the (i) info link in the bottom of the page which leads to the github project.

1r6ezui,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1r6ezui/been_dreaming_about_my_ex_for_nearly_a_decade/,Been dreaming about my ex for nearly a decade.,"Hi all. I know there are tons of similar cases here. Just looking for someone to talk about it with. In 2017 I was broken up with. I was 26 when it ended. We had been together for two years, lived together over a year of that time. It was my first serious adult relationship. It ended largely because of me. I was immature and not a great parter to her - especially towards the end. We had some big disagreements that I knew made us incompatible but I was so in love with the idea of what I wanted our lives to be that I couldn't end it myself. I began acting up and forced her I to leaving me. But of course when she did I was devastated. I am who I am in large part because of what I learned from the failure of that relationship. I have a good life, a great partner, and I like who I am.   

  

But I've been dreaming about the ex fairly consistently since we've been a part. At least once a month or so. They're never sexual. Rarely are they romantic. Often the interactions are small. Locking eyes across the room at a party. Seeing each other in a coffee shop. Over time the dreams became more involved. We would catch up, talk about our lives and how we've changed. Sometimes she would come to me and want to reignite things and I would think ""why now after you've spent so long wanting nothing to do with me?"". Sometimes various dreams would have continuity with each other. Almost like I was maintaining some relationship with the dream version of this girl. I often wake up happy that I got to see her, then sad that that it wasn't real.   

  

I'm a pretty thoughtful and introspective person. I have some guesses at why this may be happening. But it's so constant. I feel like this woman's absence from my life has been more influential than her presence ever was. I'm not sure if these dreams are good or bad. If they mean something more than my own psychological mythology. Just interested in some input from others. Thanks y'all. ",5,1771260956.0,Dreams,13,1.0,False

1r6ey6s,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1r6ey6s/i_belonged_here/,I Belonged Here.,"I spend most nights at the office long after sunset. I’m the first to arrive and the last to leave, piled in paperwork with an innate thirst for a never-ending cycle. It provides me stability, purpose, and power. And, it never lets me think about anything else. I tell myself that’s a good thing.

“A busy mind is a calm mind”, is a phrase that was hammered into me since adolescence. Maybe that’s why I find myself holed up in a small cubicle. Smaller than me. Smaller than my chest, smaller than the air that fights to make room in it. If I start to think about my reality, I panic. That’s why I turn my attention to the emails in front of me. 



“Lisa Goodman. Age 36, twice divorced. Petitioning for dissolution of marriage with minor children.”



I scoffed. Of course she’s getting divorced again. I opened her petition.



“The Court should establish a Parenting Plan with the following provisions for *Dad*

No time sharing for Parent;

This request is in the best interest of the children because the Respondent (“Dad”) will be unable to care for the children due to criminal history and drug use.”



This was, unfortunately, not surprising. Family law is messy. Maybe if people stopped having children to save relationships, most of us wouldn’t be so ruined. Maybe if people stopped having kids at all, we would all be better off.

I let out a sigh and closed the laptop. I was tired of looking at other people’s problems. Rubbing the bridge of my nose, I shut my eyes tightly and took a deep breath. I traced the wrinkles in my forehead with my thumbs, etched in from years of worrying. I sometimes wonder what would’ve happened in my life if I decided to swallow my pride and accept help. 



I’ll never know.



The office lights had been shut down hours ago, and I was left with a small dim lamp just bright enough to read the papers strewn across my desk. I wasn’t even supposed to be here, but I was nonetheless. Anywhere was better than home. I couldn’t bring myself to go back there for another night, knowing that a hollow loneliness was waiting for me in bed. The type that surrounds your skin and burrows into your chest, leaving an aching hole through your heart. I would honestly rather sleep at my desk. 

It was unnaturally quiet this time in the office, which I both enjoyed and equally felt unsettled by if thought on for too long. The air hung still, stagnant, almost held in place. It was like time froze here in the night. I wondered if there were any others left in this building. 

I worked on the tenth floor of my firm, with four more stretched above me. It was one of the largest buildings in downtown, looming over the smaller businesses like some omnipotent power. I always said I wanted to leave this city, but twenty years have passed and I haven’t moved an inch. I spend my days hoping for something better that I know will never come. I’ve settled with my monotony. 

I juggled between thoughts of what I should do. Part of me knew that I needed to go home, the other part was scared. I already felt that cold ache in my chest. I settled on taking a short walk outside. This time of night there wasn’t much activity. Most people were home, or holed up in some drug house or passed out on the side of the road. No one would be outside to bother me.

I rolled my sleeves and slipped my phone into my pocket. Opting to leave my computer and bag at my desk (confident nobody else was here to take a peek), I exited the floor. Marble stretched along the hallway and the taps of my shoes echoed abnormally loud, bouncing off the porcelain fixtures. It was difficult to breathe but the air felt sharp, how I’d imagine the top of a mountain would feel. Maybe it was my anxiety holding my lungs in, scared they’d pop if given the opportunity. 

I pressed the elevator button and waited for the doors to slide open. The mechanical whirring hummed in my ears faintly like a hymn. When it opened, I stepped inside and hit the ground floor. Only after a few moments did it start descending. The stall was barely noticeable, almost invisible if you weren’t used to riding the elevator daily. I looked around, a bit confused.

The elevator hit the ground floor and I stepped out. The lobby of the firm was what you would expect of a prestigious place. Water fountains, shrubbery and more marble lined the room. The front desk and waiting chairs were made of mahogany and gold trim. Glowing light fixtures hung from the ceiling, drowning everything in a soft, gentle light. It had a faint aroma of cleaning solution, and even that smelled expensive. 

The front lobby was a stark contrast to my regular work floor. The upper floors were adorned with grey cubicles, grey carpet and even grey coffee. I could see where all the budget for the building went to, but then again, first impressions are everything.



Aren’t they?



I started towards the big revolving doors before pausing. I hung stagnant for a moment, studying the entrance. There was nothing inherently *wrong* with what I was seeing. Staring out of the glass, darkness loomed outside. Most street lamps on this side of town have been out of service for a long time, leaving the moon the sole source of light. Shadows of trees swayed with the wind, the imprints of leaves stamped on the concrete sidewalks. It seemed that was the only movement outside. No cars, people, or animals were visible. I turned my head to stare out the left and right sides of the building, which were also lined with tall windows. Conversely, the trees on these sides did not move at all. I assumed maybe the wind couldn’t reach these sides of the building. 

As I stepped forward I felt a pang in my chest. Not painful, but.. sad. I felt the loneliness again. The cold isolation, the hollowness. 



I couldn’t do it. 



I turned around and pressed the elevator button again.



That familiar hymn returned as the elevator descended to me. It felt comforting compared to the dark unknown. The call button pinged and I stepped inside, a bit satisfied with my brief walk. I was already thinking of my next assignment when a hand slipped through the crack in the doors, forcing the motion sensor to open them. 

I was startled by the sudden movement. It was one of the many janitors who worked here, and he just happened to frequently visit my floor. 

“Hey Jim, how are you?” I asked. I looked up at him staring blankly ahead as the doors slid shut. He stood there motionless, leaning on a large wheeling trash can. His expression hung like there wasn’t anything behind his eyes. I tried again. 

	

“Jim? You doing alright?”



He turned his head to look at me. I had never seen his face make an expression like this before. His face was scowled, cold. He looked at me with such hatred, as if I were responsible for something he could never forgive. Disdain shot from his eyes and right through me. I felt the need to back up with nowhere to go.

Taking a small step into the corner, I shrunk myself into the wall. Maybe silence was a better answer. I watched Jim as his eyes slid forward again, fixed on nothing. The elevator rose and returned to the tenth floor.

I stepped off first. As I looked back, the doors hung open just long enough to let me fully catch his gaze. His eyes screamed a helplessness my body could feel. Then, the doors shut.

I was confused and disturbed. I rationalized it - *maybe he’s just having a bad day*. But, the look in his eyes was pleading. Desperate. Raw. 

With a chill brushing my spine, I turned and headed back towards the floor entrance. The click clack of my shoes echoed once more in the hallway, this time with a slightly different pitch. It was too high, too repetitive. I stopped and looked down at my feet. Taking a few more steps, the landing of my shoes didn’t align with the sounds I was hearing. I stopped and tried again. The taps lagged behind my steps, just slightly. *I must be really tired*, I thought. 

I entered the work floor and the warm glow of the hallway was swallowed by darkness behind me. The familiar blanket of silence greeted me and I returned to my desk. As I sat down, I noticed the papers I had strewn across my desk were now arranged in a neat, perfectly positioned pile. They were even organized by case. 

I stood and looked around me. “Hello?” I called out. “Is anyone still here?”. Silence responded. It hung heavier this time. My heart rate quickened. I moved away from my desk and started peering between the cubicles, hoping someone familiar was staying late with me. Maybe they saw I was struggling with my cases and wanted to do something nice. 



There was nobody. 



I cautiously turned back to my desk. *Who in the world could’ve done this?* As far as I knew, Jim and I were the only ones here. I had already scanned the entire floor. I hesitantly sat back down.

I opened my files and picked up where I left off. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched. I felt eyes piercing into my back the way something waits when it knows it has time. I froze. My heart hammered against my ribs, sweat beading along my brow. I held my breath in an attempt to quiet myself. Time hung suspended in space.

In a split second decision, I stood and turned around, shoving the desk in the process. 

Behind me was a large window that wrapped around all sides of the room. It was unnaturally dark outside. Usually, there were various city lights visible. Taxis, buses and car headlights moving through the darkness like fireflies, floating through invisible patterns. There was absolutely nothing outside this time, everywhere I turned my head. And at the bottom of the window was an even darker band that stretched along the whole room.

I stepped closer to the window. The dark band was much smaller than the rest of the window, it barely hovered over the bottom edge. Along the dark band were small pinpricks of light, still virtually unnoticeable. You had to squint to see them. When I moved, the light moved with me. It felt like I controlled them.

I crouched down to the window. Straining my eyes, I tried to see what the little sources of light were. The edge of the black band was misshapen, uneven and sometimes shot up vertically. It reminded me of the fur of an animal. I got down on my chest to get equal with the lights. 

My stomach dropped. I froze in place, unable to move. I was inches away from a pair of eyes. I looked to the right slightly, and there were another pair. Same to the left, and down, and down the row, all along the black band. This wasn’t a band at all. It was people. Heads, only visible from the eyes up, staring at me, waiting. If I tilted my head, their eyes moved with it. The fuzzy edge was their hair, slicked back, wild and some defying gravity, sticking straight up like a pin. They all watched me. 

I shoved myself upright, stumbling backwards and into my desk, spilling papers all over the floor. As I did, the eyes shot upwards to meet my gaze. Every pair of eyes I looked into had already been looking into mine. My breath came apart.

I grabbed my bag and laptop and sprinted for the door, disregarding the files I had thrown. Flying through, I ran down the hallway, my footsteps echoing a thousand times around me. It sounded like drums pounding in my ears, reverberating into my skull. It was too much to bear. I fell to my knees in the middle of the hall, heart beating out of my chest. I snapped my head towards the end of the hall, where another window stood. A pair of eyes met mine. This time, they were much more visible. One person stood there alone, sweaty brown hair mopped onto their head. His eyebrows were raised fearfully, gaze wide and alarmed. It was almost like something was holding him in place. 

I picked myself up and reluctantly ran to him in an attempt to reach the elevator. The closer I came, the more alarmed his eyes grew. I wondered if it was fear I was sensing - or some sick excitement at his prey moving closer. 

I pressed the button and made distance between me and the window while I waited. Pressing my back against the wall, I didn’t take my eyes off of the man. The same hymnal humming began. It was meant to soothe me. The elevator would take me away from this. 

The indicator pinged and I ran into the elevator, frantically slamming the close door button. I hit the ground floor button next, and waited for the descent. Some time passed. And then, more time passed. I started to wonder if I was stuck.

The floor gave out from under me. Shooting past levels, my stomach rose and I felt weightless. I fell to the ground of the elevator and braced for a painful impact, crying out for someone to help me. And, like a cue, the elevator started to slow to a gentle stop. 

My legs shook as I stood and exited to the lobby. I started half-walking, half-crawling to the revolving doors. Hot tears rolled down my cheeks and dropped onto the marble, eventually being dried away by my suit pants dragging behind. I carried my trembling body until I made it to the edge of the doors. And, when I looked up, a crowd of mouthless people stood there, eyes fixed on the handles in front of me.

Through the glass I could make out the first man as the one I saw just before entering the elevator. Along with him, every person was dressed in professional attire, but it was messily put on and ill-fitting like dolls being dressed. I scanned the crowd and couldn’t decipher how far back it went - or rather, just how many people there were. Shadows covered faces and the trees I once saw before seemed to have vanished, replaced with darkness. I went to stand. The minute I moved, every single pair of eyes shot towards me. 

One of the men in the crowd grabbed the handle and pulled. The door gave way. He stepped inside and through the revolving door, and then towards me. More followed. They flooded in like water, shoving each other out of the way to get inside, eyes still boring into mine. My mouth released a sound I didn’t know was possible. I frantically started crawling the other way, back towards the elevator, limbs falling loose like lead. Only when I reached the doors and pressed the call button did I turn my head around. 

They all froze in place. The second the bell dinged for the retrieval of the elevator, they stopped, like statues being turned into rock. It was too fast of a transition, too precise. Their eyes scanned for each other, still frozen, still aware. They looked around - searching for who else was here. Then, they slowly thawed. Coming back to life they gently fixed their clothes and started heading to different areas of the building. Some took the stairs, others pulled out phones with no screens and pretended to talk. *How could they talk with no mouths?*

A small group approached me and entered the elevator neatly. They stared at me, waiting for me to get in with them. I stepped in, heart hammering, and pressed the 10th floor. Their eyes snapped sideways, locked on me again, unblinking, unyielding. I had no choice but to move with them.

When the elevator doors opened, a strong smell emanated from the hall  — sweet, tangy, like sweat masked by deodorant, two scents coexisting but never blending. I wrinkled my nose and pressed myself against the wall.

The marching people filed out ahead of me, perfectly aligned. Their eyes stayed fixed on me. Necks rotated with an unnatural, mechanical precision. Something about the hall felt… off. The walls seemed to shift subtly, bending inwards, then stretching out again, almost imperceptibly. I shook my head, but the sensation made my stomach tighten. The smell seemed to linger, clinging to the air, following the people as they moved.

Each person eventually went into an office, or room, or desk. I followed them into the floor. Outside it was still unnaturally dark, but the black band was gone. Once a person sat down at a desk, their eyes shot from me to whatever was in front of them, and they started working. Unblinking, unbreathing, unmoving, each person started frantically typing or writing. When they were finished with something, they immediately moved on to something else. Certain people circled the hall, acting as managers, marching between cubicles and leaning into the desk spaces, staring intently at both the person and whatever they were working on. The “managers” held the expression that if one worker were to mess up, a severe punishment were to ensue.

And it did. Shortly after the thought crossed my mind, I heard pounding and whipped my head around. One manager seized a worker whose computer hadn’t turned on. His fists hammered down, streaking the cubicle walls with blood. Another joined in. And another, until the crowd swallowed him entirely. When the managers finally stepped back, the computer flickered to life on its own. The worker’s head, now grotesquely deformed and mushy, stared at the screen, typing frantically as blood pooled across the keyboard. 

I turned my head away from the horrifying sight - and froze. A pair of eyes stood inches from me, unmoving, unwavering. The manager’s gaze pinned me, waiting, anticipating. My breath hitched. Time stretched between us, thick and slow, each heartbeat echoing in my chest.

I narrowed my eyes, met his stare, puffed my chest, and took a careful step forward. His rigid posture softened. He blinked. Relaxed. Then, almost mechanically, he stepped aside and began walking down another row.

The sweet-tangy smell hit me again, stronger this time. It filled the room, clinging to my skin, swirling in my nose, pressing against my lungs. My head spun. My vision wavered, the edges of the room tilting ever so slightly. Strange warmth curled in my chest. Strange… comfort. As if letting go—letting myself sink into it—would be easier than resisting. Maybe I should just close my eyes. Maybe I should let it take me.

A pinch snapped me awake. I looked down at my arm and saw a hand holding me, pinching my skin. It was one of the mouthless workers. Their eyes widened in fear, worry, and.. concern. They made sure I was awake before nervously returning to their work.

I had so many questions, but the sight of another manager peering down the hall reminded me of the danger I was in. I assumed a confident posture. Marching towards the door, I kept my eyes forward, unwavering, partly afraid of what I would see and, for my own safety. I heard various noises around me. The same pummeling sounds, flesh on flesh, thud after thud, worker after worker being beaten into bloody pulps. Most were completely silent as the beatings happened, others let out small muffled cries, trying to speak with no mouth. And then I heard a loud shout, clear as day. I whipped my head around.

“No! N-no, stop it!” cried one of the workers. A smaller woman rose from her desk, her outfit fitting better than the others. Her hair fell neatly around her neck, jewelry carefully in place. She was petite, making the managers seem monstrous in comparison.

She gazed up at them with cloudy blue eyes - and I noticed her mouth.

It was still partly visible, but the corners had begun fusing together, turning speech into a grotesque imitation. The pink of her lips bled into the flesh of her face, and when she spoke, it moved like a sock puppet trying to mimic human words.

“I work hard. I deserve better than this,” she demanded, voice shaking. “You need to treat me better.” The managers didn’t react at first, they only stared. Then one stepped forward. His hand moved so quickly I almost missed it. 

A sharp crack split the air.

Just like that, she lay limp on the floor. Her body thudded onto the ground, hitting the wheeling office chair which sent it shooting into the next cubicle. The worker inside that cubicle raised their hands in shock at the impact, and the managers swarmed their desk next. 

I turned my attention away and picked up my pace to the exit. The frantic tapping of keyboards and occasional beating landed on my ears simultaneously like a sick symphony. Clack clack, thud, clack. Thud thud, clack clack. Thud thud thud. Moan. Cry. Clack.

It was too much to bear. If the mouthless workers stopped or rested, they were met with merciless beatings from other workers. I didn’t understand the hierarchy, or why they were where they were. All I noticed was the look in the managers’ eyes. Not anger. Not rage. Just vacancy. As if whatever had once lived behind them had stepped out and never returned.

The hallway door seemed to be getting farther and farther away. With each step I took, it felt like the exit took two more backwards. The quicker I walked, the more eyes landed on me, both of the helpless workers and the managers. The workers’ eyes seemed to scream for me in a way I didn’t understand. The managers’ eyes were sharp, perceptive, waiting for me to fall so they too could swarm me. The more I looked around, the farther away the door seemed to move. How long have I been walking for?

And then I was there. Right in front of the door. I cautiously took the handle, and turned. It opened gently. I pushed it and didn’t look back.

The hallway air felt lighter than before. The door shut behind me and the noises stopped instantly, and what replaced them was a gentle hum from the lamps lining the hall. The window at the end didn’t have eyes anymore; it was covered by a cream curtain falling softly against the wall. 

I took a step forward. It was quiet, plush. I looked down. A rug was lining the floor, gentle forest green with a border of gold. It smelled nice in here; like the same expensive cleaning solution as the lobby. 

With each step I took, the threads of the rug seemed to reverberate around my feet, echoing across the floor and returning to me. The warm lights dimmed and the sweet scent grew stronger. When I reached the elevator, it dinged and opened on its own, exactly when it should have. I hadn’t realized my hands stopped shaking. My shoulders dropped, and it felt like a presence was behind me, encouraging me to let go. To let loose. To ease in. 

The smell filled my senses again. That same sweet-tangy air, but this time I allowed it to come. I took a deep breath. It swirled in my head and in my lungs, filling my body with a soothing sensation that calmed every cell composing me. My breathing grew shallow, my knees softened. But I didn’t fall. Something held me upright, something soft, warm, supportive. I opened my eyes. 

My arms were fixed stiffly in front of me. My hips wouldn’t move. My legs felt suspended. Slowly - almost lovingly - the interior wall of the elevator pressed against me.

No.

It wasn’t pressing.

It was opening.

Stretching.

Reaching.

The surface had molded around my arms, my torso, my thighs. It cradled me as it drew me inward, inch by inch, swallowing me with patient, gentle insistence. I almost wanted it to take me. Almost…

No.

I felt the coolness of the walls press against my skin. I pushed back, trying to wrench my arms free, but the harder I fought, the tighter the building’s grip became. It held me with a patience that felt almost… intimate. It wasn’t going to let me go.

My strength drained quickly. Each tug felt slower than the last, my limbs heavy, my breath thick. It wasn’t just the building weighing me down - it was everything. Every choice I’d made, every night I’d stayed late, every person I’d pushed away because it was easier to drown in work than admit I needed anything at all.

My life had become a long corridor of empty rooms.

Tears rolled down my cheeks as I let go. I leaned into the walls enveloping me. The pressure didn’t feel like a trap anymore - it felt like recognition. Like the building understood the shape of my loneliness better than I ever had. For all the years I’d spent pretending I didn’t need anyone, this place seemed to see straight through me.

My body sagged in exhaustion. The walls didn’t tighten further; they simply stayed, steady and unyielding, as if waiting. Not pulling. Not pushing. Just holding me there in a way that felt almost deliberate.

A strange warmth bloomed in my chest, a quiet, dangerous thought whispering through me.

I belonged here.

—

I opened my eyes. I was sitting at my desk, papers neatly stacked and organized by case. The monitor glowed softly, as if it had been waiting for me. I blinked, disoriented, and looked around.

The office was empty. Completely still. I turned in my chair toward the window and saw the city alive - headlights drifting through the streets, office lights flicking off one by one, the familiar sprawl of downtown humming in the distance. The air conditioner buzzed overhead, that same irritating drone that always settled on my shoulder like a fly.

I took a slow breath.

I really need to stop sleeping at work.

I gathered my computer and bag, stood, and headed for the door. When I reached the hallway, my footsteps sounded normal. No strange echoes. No lagging taps. I pressed the elevator button and braced myself, but it opened on cue, just like it had for years.

I stepped inside and hit the ground level. It didn’t hesitate or stall — it glided down the floors obediently. When it reached the lobby, the doors parted, and I stepped out.

I started toward the revolving doors and caught my reflection in the glass.

I paused.

I turned back to the mirror. The lights were still dim in the lobby. I told myself I was overtired, that I was imagining things.

But I wasn’t.

My mouth was starting to sew shut.

I pay for lunch and a drink. When should I expect a woman to pay for a date?,"So I am kinda a 50/50 type of guy overall. I was brought up and told many times that a man pays for the first date which is why I always do. It never has been about the money, however, I like it when women do pay eventually. 

The reason being that with my last relationship, I paid for everything due to me planning the dates. I didnt do anything extraordinary other than going to chicago for a weekend and paying for a nice restaurants 8 months in. 

Most dates were movies and small little events around the city. Even the steak restaurant was 50% dull to a seasonal deal. The problem was tho is that my ex never paid for anything. She wouldnt even buy me a coffee if she went to starbucks. 

She still was pretty responsive on phone call and allow me to come over everyday for affection but it felt transactional. I wanted to get gifts sometimes and feel appreciated. Overtime I eventually told her that you have to do something because I feel like I am doing everything. We didnt make it lol. 

So I want to prevent that with this girl. So when do you think I should have that talk?

1r6eucr,https://i.redd.it/6jal4ul4zvjg1.jpeg,I own both a Gaggimate Pro Gaggia Classic and a Lelit Bianca – here's what surprised me,"I'm currently putting together a video comparing these two machines side by side on my channel ([CoffeeXris on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@CoffeeXris?subscribe=1)). Before I finish it, I wanted to share some of my notes here and hear what you'd want me to cover. Things I'm maybe not thinking of, aspects you'd find useful, stuff you disagree with.

I've been using a Lelit Bianca V3 for a while now and recently modded a Gaggia Classic with the Gaggimate Pro. I expected the Bianca to win in every category – it costs 3x as much. Turns out it's not that simple.

**The things nobody talks about:**

The Gaggimate actually has an advantage when it comes to temperature changes mid-shot. The small single boiler has less thermal mass, so it reacts faster. The Bianca is more stable overall, sure – but if you want to do something like a declining temperature profile, the Gaggia responds quicker. That one surprised me.

Pressure profiling feels completely different on both machines. The Bianca's needle valve gives you direct, analog control. You feel the resistance, you watch the flow, you adjust in real time. It's almost meditative. The Gaggimate is the opposite: you design a profile on the web interface, hit brew, and the machine executes it. Neither is better, but they attract very different people.

Here's a weird one: the Gaggimate gets software updates. Sounds obvious for a smart device, but think about it. Your espresso machine gets better over time. The Bianca is a finished product. Theoretically it could also get updates via the LLC but so far Lelit did not do that and to upgrade the you probably need to replace the LLC module. Great out of the box, but what you buy is what you get. The Gaggimate community keeps pushing features that didn't exist 6 months ago.

**Where the Bianca still wins clearly:**

Steam power: not even close. If you make milk drinks daily, for multiple people, the dual boiler setup is a different league. The Gaggia can steam well, but it's a compromise.

Build quality and longevity. E61 group, massive brass components, rotary pump – this thing is built to last decades with basic maintenance. The Gaggimate is clever engineering on top of a budget machine. (Not to say the Gaggia will break faster, I am using mine since 5 years with no problems so far).

Accessories. The E61 ecosystem is huge – bottomless portafilters, flow control devices, shower screens, you name it. Gaggia accessories exist but it's a smaller world.

And honestly – the Bianca just looks stunning on the counter. The wood accents, the E61 chrome, the whole presence. That matters to some people and I get it.

**Where the Gaggimate surprises:**

Price obviously: \~600€ total vs \~1800€ for the Bianca. That's a good grinder upgrade worth of difference.

Heat-up time. 10-15 minutes vs 20-25 minutes. If you're the ""I want coffee NOW"" type, that adds up over weeks and months.

Consistency for lazy mornings. Pick a profile, press the button, walk away. The Bianca demands your attention for every shot, at least in terms of stopping the lever manually.

Size. If you're working with a small kitchen, the Gaggia's footprint is significantly smaller.

Power consumption is lower too – single boiler, less thermal mass, quicker on/off cycles.

Maintenance is actually interesting. The E61 group needs regular lubrication, and backflushing is a manual process. The Gaggimate has automated backflush cycles built into the software. Not a dealbreaker on either side, but a nice quality-of-life thing.

**Things that could go either way:**

Noise is different rather than better or worse. The Gaggia's vibration pump has that typical higher-pitched buzz, the Bianca's rotary pump is deeper and more even. In practice the grinder drowns out both anyway.

Resale value favors the Bianca. It holds its price well on the used market. A modded Gaggia is harder to sell because the buyer needs to be comfortable with the mod. But flip side: if the Gaggimate board ever dies, you still have a fully functional Gaggia Classic underneath.

The Bianca can be plumbed in, the Gaggia can't. For some setups that matters a lot.

Upgradeability is a funny one. The Bianca is kind of endgame for most home baristas – you're not itching to replace it. The Gaggimate might leave you wondering ""what's next"" at some point. But then again, its software capabilities actually exceed what many machines at 2-3x the price can do. So where exactly would you upgrade to?

**My honest take:**

If someone asked me ""which makes better espresso?"" – I'd say they're closer than the price gap suggests. Same beans, same grinder, same recipe – the shots are surprisingly similar. The Gaggimate punches way above its weight for straight espresso.

But espresso machines aren't just about the shot in the cup. They're about workflow, ritual, aesthetics, milk drinks, and how much you enjoy the process. The Bianca is for people who want the manual craft experience and make milk drinks regularly. The Gaggimate is for tinkerers who love data and want maximum control per euro spent.

1r6eph7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePureContent/comments/1r6eph7/why_local_seo_services_in_palm_beach_gardens_are/,Why Local SEO Services in Palm Beach Gardens Are Essential for Small Business Growth,"If you’re running a small business in Palm Beach Gardens, you already know how competitive the local market can be. From restaurants and retail shops to service providers and consultants, everyone is fighting for attention. The question is: how do you stand out without burning through your marketing budget? The answer for many small businesses is simple—local SEO.

Local SEO focuses on helping your business show up when nearby customers search for products or services you offer. When someone types “best plumber near me” or “coffee shop in Palm Beach Gardens,” you want your business to appear front and center. That’s not luck. That’s strategy.

Here’s why local SEO is essential for small business growth:

* **Increased Visibility in Local Searches** Most customers start their buying journey online. Optimizing your business for local search ensures you appear in map results and local listings when people are ready to buy.
* **Higher Foot Traffic and Calls** Local searches often have high intent. People searching locally are usually ready to visit, call, or book. Showing up at the right moment can directly increase walk-ins and inquiries.

1r6eosg,https://www.reddit.com/r/coldemail/comments/1r6eosg/i_analyzed_7k_google_categories_heres_the_real/,I analyzed 7K Google categories. Here’s the real issue.,"I’ve tested almost every GMaps scraper out there.

Same experience every time:

Takes forever to run. 

Costs more than advertised

Data quality is… “fine”

Categories are a complete mess

And the worst part?

You can’t just say what you actually want.

You should be able to type:

“Lawyers in Amsterdam”

“Cafes in London with 200+ reviews and rating under 3.0”

Instead, you’re stuck filtering through Google’s category chaos.

Fun fact:

7,000+ categories globally

\~1,000 duplicates (Café vs Cafe 🤦‍♂️)

2.2M businesses dumped under “establishment”

4.3M under “corporate office”

And Google puts the responsibility on the business owner to categorize correctly.

Spoiler: most don’t.

So if you want “cafes”:

In Amsterdam a café is a pub

A coffee shop sells weed

You get coffee at an espresso bar

Good luck building a clean lead list from that.

So I built something different.

Instead of relying on Google’s broken categories, I embedded them all into natural language to search semantically 

You just type what you want.

The system understands intent.

And it returns actual relevant businesses, not category guesses.

No 47 filters.

No category roulette.

No scraping roulette.

I’m launching on Product Hunt on Feb 26.

Before I do, I’d love feedback from people who actually do cold email and care about list quality.

If you want early access, leave a comment and I’ll DM you.

It’s a mechanical watch and the face spins around like a miniature casino wheel. It’s absolutely useless as a timepiece, but I still love it and I’ve been fiddling with it the whole morning.  
  
What makes it even cooler is the backstory behind it. Turns out she’s been looking at luxury versions of this watch design for a couple of months now, and when she found one that cost more than our car, she figured she would not be able to buy me one. Luckily she’s pretty good at finding deals, and she found this one on Alibaba. I was skeptical when she told me how much she paid for it, but it has a good weight to it and the spinning mechanism works surprisingly well.  
  
It’s definitely a cool watch to talk about. I went to get coffee earlier, and I ended up spending five minutes explaining how it works to the barista.

*\[Digitized transcript. Original handwritten. Some entries damaged by acid. Redactions per DOJ directive.\]*

# JUNE 10, 2018

The contract arrived by email. A PDF with no sender.

It said quite a lot, but there were two sentences I hyperfocused on.

**Pay: $1,100 per day. Cash. Accommodation included.**

I said yes in fourteen seconds. That’s less time than it takes me to open my banking app and see the red balance glowing back at me.

Signed digitally and sent my reply. Afterward I had a cigarette and lay back on the couch. My body was buzzing, and I couldn’t relax. I checked my inbox, got up and paced restlessly around. It took three hours. Three. Before I finally got a reply. There were the final coordinates, plane tickets from Gardermoen, and a ferry ticket to the island. The island. First to London, then to Miami, San Juan, and finally to St. Thomas. The ferry ticket was to Little St. James. Everything was in my name. Løvstad, S.

It was ██████ who had recommended me when I worked at ████████████. I considered calling, or sending a thank-you message, but I let it go.

# JUNE 13–15, 2018

I packed just a small suitcase and left in summer clothes. I was sweating at Gardermoen, but nobody took notice. The London flight felt longer than the flight to Miami, even though I couldn’t sleep on any of them. Miami hit me like a wall of humidity and heat. The distance from Miami to San Juan is roughly the same as Oslo to London. It was starting to wear on me, but my body was still full of adrenaline. The last flight was a propeller plane. There were no tourists on board. It was me, and people who looked rich. Not suits and dresses, but it was the small details. The women had expensive jewelry, the men were tanned. Expensive sunglasses, expensive watches, expensive shoes. I stood out. It was the glances, not anything they said. Pale, a shirt that only looked fine in Oslo, and a pair of Doc Martens. Nobody wanted to sit next to me. Nobody wanted to look at me for too long either.

The same people were standing on the dock when I arrived by taxi. None of them had taken a taxi. I also saw a black helicopter take off as I stepped out. It smelled of seaweed and salt water, diesel from the worn-out ferry. Ferries are always worn-out. Now the glances got stranger, especially when I boarded the ferry, showed my phone with the ticket, and wasn’t turned away. But they took my phone and placed it in a bundle with other phones. It wasn’t just my phone that was there, but none of the rich had theirs taken.

The crossing took no more than half an hour, maybe a bit longer. It’s the first time I’ve been separated from my phone since I bought my first one in 2012. Now I only have the diary. It will have to be my eyes.

I’m writing this while the boat engine vibrates beneath me, and the waves rock the ferry from side to side. The engine hum settles like a lid in the back of my head, the salt over everything else. I discovered a new kind of silence that only comes when the distractions are gone and you’re forced to see the world as it is.

A lone seagull landed on the railing and screamed at me. I waved it away. It flew up into the air, found another seagull, and together they cackled at me.

By the way, I saw ███████ sitting over there. I only noticed her because she seemed embarrassed and avoided looking at me, and so I dared to look more closely. It took a moment to recognize her, without the gloss and the entourage. No bodyguards. It struck me then that you don’t need bodyguards here. That realization hit me like a wall. Power is safest where it need not be protected. I didn’t feel safer because of it. Quite the opposite.

When we arrived I was the last to disembark. Nobody stopped me, but I understood. The rich, *and her*, were escorted onward. I was received by a man in work clothes—denim, a shirt, practical shoes. “Løvstad,” he said. That is, it was more like “loovstadd,” but so be it. I write it the way I understood and remember it. He escorted me to the annex where I’m sitting now. We walked along a narrow, hard-packed road. On one side the sea glittered, on the other the bushes were thick. We passed a path that led toward the sound of laughter and music. We didn’t take that one. Instead we went to the annex. He called it CIA, but he smiled when he said it. It was the first time I’d seen him smile, and I noticed he was missing a front tooth. It was a charming smile. I barely had time to laugh myself.

Cottage Intelligence Agency, he explained, and the joke soured in my mouth. Now I understood what it meant. “You’re safe as long as you stay in here,” he said. Then he left.

The annex is bigger than it looks from the outside. There’s only one floor above ground, but there’s a door showing that stairs go down. There are two bedrooms, a simple kitchen, two large living rooms, a shower, and a closet used as a wardrobe. I can hear humming from the floor. The familiar sound of a server room. In one living room there’s a large leather sofa, a table, some chairs, and a TV. The other is wall-to-wall with desks and computer screens. This is where I’ll be sitting and working, I realize. But doing what? I don’t see any instructions anywhere. I’m exhausted.

# JUNE 16, 2018

I woke up early, I think, but I have no watch so I don’t know exactly when. It was the sound of a helicopter that woke me, and the intense heat from the sun grilling my face. Curtains, must remember them. \[two lines under the word curtains\]

I craved coffee and thankfully there was some in the kitchen. Nespresso, simple and sour. Not good. I opened the door and sat down on a plastic chair that stood outside. No matter where you are, white plastic chairs are a sign of civilization. Yes, that’s actually what I was thinking when the man from yesterday showed up. He called out to me in his broken English. I couldn’t quite place it, but I was thinking of old Clint movies, and it struck me that he both looked and resembled that Mexican guy, Eli something or other.

I called back in my probably equally broken Norwegian-English. He gave me two envelopes. One heavy and one light. I immediately understood what they were—money and instructions. Would I be paid every day? Fine by me. It was the next thing he said that unsettled me.

“You can sit out here, but don’t go anywhere on the island without an escort,” he said. “Don’t open any doors you haven’t been given permission to open.”

And then the last thing.

“Don’t go down to the cellar.”

Why not, I asked, but he just repeated the warning. It was the stern look in his eyes that made me not ask again. The coffee had gone too sour. A mosquito had landed in it. I poured it out and went inside. Eli left without saying anything more. I’m starting to wonder who he really is.

I went into the living room with the computers. The office, as I’ll now call it. I thought maybe they had internet access? But first I opened the envelopes. The heavy one—dollars. I counted, $7,700. Almost eighty thousand Norwegian kroner. The other envelope, the light one, contained what I expected—instructions.

It reads as follows:

*Dear Mr. Løvstad (they spelled the name right!)*

*Your job is to log in to the workstation and work on the proprietary database program. You will assign names to images, and connect names and images together to create profiles. That’s the entirety of your job. This is highly confidential and we rely on your…*

Yes, I don’t need to write more, it’s more of the same. We trust you. But it sounds too simple? That’s what I thought when I turned on the workstation. It hummed and the screen lit up in front of me. No internet access. Not even Windows, just a terminal connected to another computer somewhere.

So they hired a computer expert from Norway because he knows ██████ and give him a job a first-year student could do? I’m not complaining. It’s an adventure.

My terminal showed me two things: a button for images, video, and scanned documents. Another for a name registry. So it was that simple. I opened the name registry, and now I actually got chills down my spine. It’s a cliché, but it’s true. It was like opening the newspaper. There was ███ and ████████ and ████, and even more. I pressed the down button until I reached her—██████. The balcony lady. Waving flags. I clicked in, saw a list of emails, linked images. And even as smart as I am, I didn’t understand it until now.

This was a systematic blackmail archive.

What do I do now? That was the first thought. The second was that this was dangerous. And the third… I looked up, at the walls and ceiling. Video cameras pointed at me. I’m writing this under the duvet. I don’t think they can see me there. And then I started working. Images that weren’t linked to anything. I looked at them, first nervously, then properly. The ones I recognized I linked to names. I wrote what they were doing in the *notes* field. Whether they were sitting on a sofa, lying in a bed, lying half-naked on a sunbed. Who they were talking to, how they looked at each other. And finally I saw what I didn’t want to see.

And I don’t know if I want to write about it, because it shook me to my soul. I had to take a break. A long, long break. I went to the kitchen, drank water, poured it over my face. Then I went outside and now I heard the whirring of cameras following me. I sat in the shade on the plastic chair outside with my head in my hands.

After a while I looked up. There was nobody there. Nobody that I could see, but I knew now that the island had eyes everywhere. They saw me. The heat hit me. The wet smell from the forest, the fresh one from the sea. It was a salty scent that I actually loved, but which now gave me no joy. It gave me nausea.

I went inside, and continued. I linked █████ to the images. Described… that was really the worst part. And the fact that it now said “l0vstad” (with a zero with a slash instead of an Ø) on the reports made me feel that I was now part of it. It was getting toward evening, I had worked all day. I hadn’t eaten, and by a strange coincidence the door opened just as I was thinking these thoughts.

It wasn’t Eli this time. It was a young girl in a black uniform, the kind you see in movies from Paris, who came with a meal under a cover. She didn’t say much, just “For you, mr…” She tried my name but it didn’t come out right. She didn’t look up at me, just turned around and hurried away. It was food, good food. Probably leftovers, but better than anything I could have made myself, either here or back home in Oslo. Maybe better than anything I could have ordered. It was steak, the best steak I’ve ever tasted. Pink in the middle, with a sauce that tasted of something sweet and dark. Beside it lay asparagus, perfect, with something grated over it that was dark, a mushroom like a dark champignon but tasted better. There was dessert too, a glass with layer upon layer of cream and berries I didn’t recognize. I ate as if someone might take it from me. It was the first proper meal I’ve had in as long as I can remember.

And while I ate I know that someone sat watching through the cameras. And then I started to wonder if those videos were in the system I had access to. Maybe I could see myself there?

Was the meal a thank you for good work, or just normal courtesy?

I listened at the door with the stairs as I passed it. Was it my imagination or did I hear sounds other than the humming of computers down there? And was there a blind spot for the cameras here? Was the door a test?

I felt paranoid. I went to bed. Now I’m lying here writing this and wondering if that last thing will have consequences.

# JUNE 17, 2018

I was woken by helicopter noise again. And sun-roasting. The curtains! I really have to remember them. I was already warm in the face, now it’s burning.

Made the same sour coffee, sat outside in the same white chair, and now the charm was gone. Yes, the water is azure blue. Yes, I love the sea air. Yes, I love the warmth. But I’m scared.

Yes, scared. That’s what I am. But nobody has been anything other than polite and friendly. It’s the images, the videos. It’s not just what I saw. It’s what I know.

Nobody came, so I got up and walked a stretch down the road. Far off I could see the dock. Behind me I could see one of the large main buildings. It was quiet there, but I’ve seen the videos and what goes on behind the walls. At the dock the ferry arrived, and I strained to see who was coming. Realized I should have had binoculars. Realized that would have been too dangerous.

But I saw something else too. The helicopter lifted off from a spot on the island. A black helicopter, which swept over where I was standing (I hid behind a bush) and down toward the dock. It circled over the ferry for a while and I could see waving. Then it flew on. I hurried back inside.

The door! I looked at the video recordings. They weren’t sorted, but I flicked through until I saw something that looked like the annex. What I didn’t think about is that I was sitting at a terminal. The people who owned the terminal could see exactly what I see. They would see that I was searching for something. That I wasn’t following instructions. How stupid of me. But scared people do stupid things, and maybe it wasn’t that dangerous?

I didn’t actually find the annex, and didn’t dare to continue, so I went back to the top and started linking.

I saw █████ again. Note: in bed with an unidentified young boy. Note: do these have names? Erased it again, because there’s a limit to how stupid I can be. Hoped nobody saw my notes.

I can’t say I was surprised when ████████ showed up in pictures. The one who recommended me. Maybe that’s why he did it? Maybe he knew I was here? I wonder if there are others from his political party here? I noted it in the comments anyway and linked the images. With so many Norwegians on this island… Maybe that’s why I got the job?

There was a knock again in the evening. Hard this time, not just the young girl, but she was also there, with food like yesterday. A man who might as well have been in uniform. A regular James Bond. He looked me straight in the eyes. He didn’t need to say anything. I saw him. I saw the weapon he had. That was enough.

I was shaking when they left, and the food didn’t taste as good. If they had known I was writing this…

But they can’t see under the duvet. No cameras here. Maybe they just think I’m coping with the videos and images I’ve seen. The thought almost made me throw up.

I fell asleep to the sound of the helicopter.

# JUNE 18, 2018

Now my face was really stinging. It wasn’t just hot. The curtains again. Maybe forgetting them was my punishment for being here?

I had placed my diary under the mattress. That gave me an idea. The other bed. Were there supposed to be two of us? I dragged myself to my feet, felt battered, face stinging, and looked under the mattress. Nothing. It would have been an insane coincidence. Too stupid. I straightened the duvet and lay down on it. Then I felt something under my head. In the pillowcase, a note.

It said:

*Do not wander. Key to cellar in kitchen, under the cutlery. Not guarded at night. They set traps.*

Who had left it there? Was the message for me? I hid the note quickly, and carefully glanced up at the wall. The camera wasn’t pointing directly at me. Maybe they hadn’t seen it? I stretched carefully, fluffed the pillow and straightened the duvet again. Did the same with my own bed. I was just going to make it tidy. My cheeks were pounding.

I went to the kitchen and made another cup of sour coffee. I looked around in the cupboards for sunscreen, or preferably aftersun, and then I looked in the cutlery drawer. Pretended I needed a spoon for the coffee, reminded myself that I also had to find sugar, and then I found it. The key, that is. I grabbed it along with a spoon.

With quick hand movements I slipped the key into my pocket and placed the spoon in the cup. Then I stood for a long time thinking before I remembered that I had to find sugar. Thankfully there were some cubes in paper wrappers there. I fished them out and stirred them in with the spoon.

Then I went outside and sat in the sun. It didn’t help the sunburn, but I thought the routines had to be maintained. Anything else would have been suspicious.

Eli didn’t come today either. What is it with this island? New people every day. Would I see the boss himself? I have to admit I thought so. The note said I shouldn’t wander. But how much wandering is wandering? Surely I could take a walk around the annex? Nobody said I wasn’t allowed to exercise? It is, after all, a tiring job.

That’s how I sat rationalizing to myself, despite a direct warning. Is that who I am? A person who gets an order and just has to break it? Is there a word for that kind of behavior? Regardless, I got up and looked around. It was quite quiet this morning. I took a walk around the annex. It was more like a large shed, even though it was solid enough. Stone foundation with a timber frame, and corrugated metal for a roof. That was the strange thing. I thought corrugated metal was a Norwegian phenomenon. There were no other doors, but a path went behind the building toward the main house.

There were no cameras back here. The key was for the cellar. I’m sure of it. But the path—was that what wasn’t guarded at night? Or was it the cellar? I looked down the path. It was a dirt road, still hard-packed, but a bit more like a Norwegian forest trail than a public road. And even though the main house was at the other end—I’m sure of that—it wasn’t much used. Is this where they bring the food?

I stood for a long time thinking before I went back. I took a quick look behind me before I went in. Nobody had seen me. My cheek stung even more. I put the cup down in the kitchen and went to the bathroom. There was shaving cream, soap, a bucket, floor soap, and moisturizer! Not aftersun or sunscreen, but at least something that could soothe. I applied a thick layer.

Should have taken a shower first, I thought, but went back to work. The same kinds of images, same kinds of videos. I was starting to get a good overview of quite a few well-known people. Secrets they would never want to come out under any circumstances. Career-destroying secrets. Criminal secrets that would lead to long prison sentences if they came out. I knew this now. These are not good things to know.

That’s how I sat for hours while I waited for the food to arrive at the door. I’ve always appreciated routines. This time he came in. James Bond. Not the young girl, who by the way wasn’t the same one. It was just the smart uniform that was the same. What scared me most was that he went straight to the bedroom and removed the sheets and pillowcase. Was he searching for something? I froze. What if he found my diary? But he didn’t, and the proof is that I’m writing this now. He didn’t find anything in the other bed either. The sheet and pillowcase lie crumpled at the foot of the bed.

I need a better hiding place for my diary. I’ll find one tomorrow.

# JUNE 19, 2018 — NIGHT

I’ve done something stupid. Something very stupid. I got up after midnight, or sometime after it got dark and quiet at least, and crept to the door with the stairway sign, and tried the key. I opened the door, and crept quietly in, and closed the door behind me.

That wasn’t the stupid part, I think, but what happened next. The stairway is long, and it spirals downward like a coiling rope. The first basement level is the server room. I listened at the door and heard the humming. That’s not exciting. A server room is a server room.

I went down one more level. That’s the second to last. The door is unmarked. I felt it. Locked. I hope there was nobody behind it. Then I went down to the last level. There was also a door there. It was unlocked. I went in and that’s where the stupid thing I did took place. As I said, there are cameras everywhere. But I had forgotten that. It’s my eagerness when I see something new. It doesn’t matter how scared I am. When I see something new I have to figure it out. So I went in and didn’t notice that the corridor was messy. I didn’t notice that at the end of the corridor there was a cove with a boat. Nor that there were people there being led out of the small boat. It was only afterward that it struck me that it was children being led out and that the people manning the boat were dressed in black diving gear. So when I kicked a metal bucket right in front of a camera and it made so much noise that the people over there turned around—that’s when I understood that I had done something stupid. Fortunately I didn’t freeze, but slipped back out the door, ran up the stairs, locked the cellar door and threw myself into bed.

And now I’m lying here hoping they just think something fell over by itself and that nobody is checking the cameras. And that the camera footage isn’t being stored.

And I’m thinking that I need to hide the key, and this diary, and that I should consider that the ferry might not be the safest way to get off the island. And now I hear helicopter noise again. The black devil is out flying.

# JUNE 19, 2018 — NIGHT ADDENDUM

An hour has passed and I still haven’t heard anything.

Why didn’t I try the key on the door on the second basement level?

I don’t dare try now.

# JUNE 20, 2018 — EARLY MORNING

I’ve been awake all night. The sunlight is still burning my face, but because I’ve been awake I’ve at least managed to hide under the duvet.

I’m going to sneak down the stairs and try the key.

# JUNE 20, 2018 — MORNING

It was completely silent in the basement stairway. I crept down to the second level, and do you know what I found there? A kind of hangar. This is where the small boats are kept. All the diving equipment. It’s not a room, but a place where boats are stored and repaired, with a hoist crane down to the lowest level. And not only that, but there’s something else here too. Large barrels with warning labels on them, the kind showing hands melting from drops.

But there’s one more thing. I looked down toward the basement level and there’s a corridor going into the island, in the direction behind the annex. That’s where he takes them. Both routes lead to the main house.

I’m going to go back up and follow the routines, make coffee, catalog images. But you know what, diary? Now you’re in the basement, near the acid barrels, under a tarp. There you’ll be dry and safe.

# JUNE 20, 2018 — EVENING

It was smart to hide the diary, because he \[double underlined\] was there again, and now he searched the entire floor. I had hidden the key outside, buried under the plastic chair. You’re here, after all.

But…

# JUNE 21, 2018

Eli showed up again. I asked why I hadn’t seen him until now. He said he does other things besides just watching over me. Then he asked if I had been in the cellar. It stung inside me. I could barely lie, but I said no. Then I asked him about the man who had searched the room, but he wouldn’t answer that. He seemed scared. Then we sat quietly for a while.

*\[part of page burnt\]*

…I snuck down to the cellar again. All the way down, and into the tunnel. I know it’s stupid, but I’ve been thinking a lot about how to get away. If I can take one of the boats and leave during the night, I should be able to get to safety.

But I have to see where the tunnel leads. I’ve seen what they do on film and in pictures, but I have to see it with my own eyes. Not because I want to, but because I can only trust what I see with my own eyes.

Now I’m going in.

*\[no more entries\]*

# Investigation Supplement — FBI Southern District Task Force

The following diary was found under a tarp in an underground storage hall on Little St. James, U.S. Virgin Islands, during the search on July 6, 2019. The diary was located next to several barrels of industrial sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). Some pages were partially damaged by acid exposure, likely caused by leakage from a damaged barrel in immediate proximity.

The diary is identified as belonging to S. Løvstad (b. 1993), Norwegian citizen, based on handwriting analysis and comparison with travel documents found in the investigation’s digital seizures.

Løvstad was employed as a seasonal worker via a facilitator connected to ████████████ Foundation in June 2018. His task was to catalog and cross-reference digital material in a proprietary database. Analysis of the database shows that Løvstad’s user account (”l0vstad”) was active from June 16 to June 20, 2018, with 2,341 registry entries.

A second user account, registered as “ADMIN\_E”, showed simultaneous logins during the same period. This account likely belongs to the person referred to as “Eli” in the diary. The account was deactivated on June 21, 2018.

S. Løvstad was reported missing by Norwegian police (Kripos ref. 2018-K-04421) on August 15, 2018, after his family had not heard from him since June 14, 2018. Norwegian authorities received no departure information following Løvstad’s arrival in St. Thomas on June 15, 2018.

No ferry or flight reservation was found in Løvstad’s name after June 15, 2018. His Norwegian passport was never used for departure from the U.S. Virgin Islands.

During the search of the island on July 6, 2019, a tunnel network was identified that corresponds with the diary’s descriptions. The underground entrance described in the last entry leads to a corridor connecting the annex (”CIA”) with the main building via a route of approximately 200 meters. Surveillance cameras were found along the entire route.

In the corridor’s final section, closest to the main house, personal belongings were found that could not be attributed to any registered guest or employee: one pair of Doc Martens boots, size 43, and a Norwegian suitcase of the Beckmann brand.

S. Løvstad has not been found.

**Status:** OPEN

**Priority:** SUSPENDED — pending international coordination with Kripos

First date went well, we had brunch, coffee, walked around the city and talked before hugging goodbyes. After 2 weeks of some texting we met up for a second date for dinner and ice skating. I wiped out a few times but we had some laughs. Same thing we exchanged the hug when our separate ways. We’ve been doing a little bit of texting here and there since. 

It’s been a while since I’ve been at this point in dating after exiting a very long-term relationship that ended due to racism/ shift in political views from her. Should I give it some space and see if the attraction holds or fizzles or should I be direct and ask if she wants to go out again right away? I am into her but I also am someone who gets attached to people quickly so idk if I’m trying to move too fast or not.",1,1771259915.0,datingadviceformen,5,1.0,False

I'm coming back after a long absence, so please, if you messaged me before feel free to again! I was going through some stuff and needed a social media break. 😅 I'm happily married so not looking for anything flirty, etc. I just want people to talk to to take my mind off the bad things.

My three main hobbies are: animals (reptiles, cats, dogs), video games (mostly WoW atm, recovering from a nerve injury), and reading (horror mostly...)! I am also an artist but usually don't draw too much these days and just collect art from other artists. I sing sometimes for fun. My idea of a good time is hunkering down with my cats and reading a book or watching a horror movie. My husband and his family have gotten me addicted to coffee. I used to be afraid of spiders but my husband got me to love them. Sometimes I watch anime, but I have to be in the mood for it haha.

I will: Send you a lot of animal pics, art, and random memes. Have random ADD thoughts.

I won't: Voice call (unless you're a rare exception), sorry I just hate talking out loud. I swear it doesn't make me a ""worse"" friend tho.

1r6ehqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1r6ehqi/cat_dental_complications_and_fees_input_wanted/,Cat dental complications and fees - input wanted,"I recently took my 13yo cat in for a dental, which led to post anesthetic blindness, circling, anorexia, and ataxia. He did not have a blood clot and all post-op bloodwork was clear.

When the clinic released him, after the dental, he was not awake and had his third eyelids completely extended. They said he could hear me because he twitched his ears when I said his name, but had no muscle tone at all and wasn’t opening his eyes. They assured me that they wouldn’t release him to me if it wasn’t safe to do so.

Anyway, I had to bring him back the next day because I couldn’t get his meds into him, he had a horrible smell coming from his mouth, and he was unable to move or eat. They kept him for three days, at their recommendation, and provided supportive care and injectable meds. They initially thought he was folding his leg and unable to walk because of arthritis, despite never having a symptoms of this pre-op, so they gave him some meds for that. He had a fever as well.

My cat finally ate on his own on day 8 and his circling and ataxia has stopped. Now he is blind and I know most cats recover some, if not all eyesight, but I realize this could be permanent.

The clinic charged me $1200 for the dental and $1300 for the hospitalization there. I also got charged after hours fees because I had to bring him back when he was not doing well the day after the dental.

My question: is it typical to charge clients in full for a hospitalization after a complication of a procedure that was likely not due to a pre-existing condition? This wasn’t a blood clot, they’ve stated this, or anything having to do with any organ like kidneys (as they have also stated).

Any comments here would be great because I’m trying to piece together my experience and why it feels so wrong. I had a cat die after a dental once, but he had a pre-existing condition and the vet tried to waive the dental fees; I demanded to pay the invoice in full and even brought all the staff pastries and coffee because I know it was heartbreaking to deal with. This time it just seems so wrong and I’m left thinking we’ve been treated unfairly.

ETA: before you get mad about me talking about fees, on reflection, I think it is more about my client experience as I got no estimates and very little information on top of a bad outcome. I understand complications arise and maybe I’m wrong to question the fees; perhaps I should focus on my experience as a client instead.",1,1771259866.0,AskVet,17,0.6,False
1r6efr7,https://www.reddit.com/r/camping/comments/1r6efr7/butane_stove_keeps_flameout_in_wind_even_with/,Butane stove keeps flame-out in wind even with windscreen I’ve,"I’ve been camping with a cheap portable camping stove for the past year (one of those single burner butane ones) and it works fine in calm conditions but the second there’s any wind it becomes completely useless. The flame either goes out entirely or burns so weak it takes forever to boil water.
I bought a three-panel aluminum windscreen specifically for this issue and it helps a bit but not enough. Even with the windscreen positioned correctly I’m still getting flame-outs if wind gusts hit from certain angles.
Last weekend I was trying to make coffee at 7am and spent like 15 minutes trying to keep the damn thing lit while my buddy with a liquid fuel stove had his water boiling in 3 minutes no problem, It was  super frustrating.
I’m debating whether I should just switch to a liquid fuel stove like an MSR or if there’s a better technique I’m missing with butane. I like butane for the convenience and easy cleanup but the wind sensitivity is killing me.
I looked into canister stoves with better wind protection and found a bunch of options from suppliers on alibaba that claim “windproof design” but I’m skeptical they’d perform any better than what I already have.
Has anyone successfully used butane stoves in windy conditions or should I just accept that liquid fuel is the only reliable option for exposed campsites?",6,1771259747.0,camping,7,0.75,False
