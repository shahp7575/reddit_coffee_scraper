I’ve never furnished anything larger than a 10x10 ft. room before, so I’m honestly not sure where everything would look best or what my aesthetic would be called… but I’m excited to start with the living room!

So far, I have a cement dining table, a fake bamboo planter, and acrylic magazine rack that I picked up from fb marketplace. (Very serious when I say the only things I brought with me when I moved in was my mattress, some art magazines and a toothbrush.)

I compiled some living room furniture I’ve been looking at, and I’m curious to see what combinations you think would look nice and where they might go (e.g. A1 for sofa/coffee table combo). 

I have no rugs, lamps, or other decor in mind yet. Honestly, I appreciate any and all insight you have to give regarding these, from color/shape ideas to links.

Thanks so much for your time :)

1otc8cl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/1otc8cl/help_me_understand_airflow_thermodynamic_in_this/,Help me understand airflow / thermodynamic in this context,"Hi guys,  
This is my first post in the sub, and I’m excited to talk with professionals in the field. A bit about myself — I’m not an expert or a physics student. Actually, I always get terrible marks in physics when I was in school. Now I’m just an ordinary coffee roaster who has been working in this field for about three years. But because of this job — and having to do my own reading to earn a better salary — I’ve realized that I really love science.

Most of my understanding of the laws of physics in coffee roasting comes from trial and error with different approaches. Other times, I learn from books, blogs, YouTube videos, or research articles about coffee. I thought I was good at my job, but I realized I wasn’t — because lacking a proper understanding of physics fundamentals really holds me back. None of my hands-on experience could answer the question: *“Why did this happen?”*

So, hopefully after I share the “system” inside my brain, we can discuss the topic together. Personally, I love reading any kind of critique because it helps me refine my skills.

What I’d love to discuss is the **mechanism of airflow in a closed environment** (in this case, a coffee roasting machine) — what happens physically when we apply heat, and how complex it can become.

I’ll break this topic into the following sections to make it easier to follow:

1. The coffee roasting machine – how I understand it from the manual book.
2. Physics terms I’ve encountered while learning.
3. My understanding of airflow from using the machine.

# 1. The Machine

The machine I’m working with is a Probat, made in Germany, and the model dates back to around 2014, so we can expect some technology inside. I’ve provided two images: [the first is a 3D mockup](https://i.postimg.cc/HL8mMbCt/3d-model.png) of what the machine looks like, and [the second is a process diagram](https://i.postimg.cc/WbYx7t84/procedureplan.png) from the manual.

From the second image, when D1 turns on, it brings in the flame and heats the R1 environment (the red area). This area is called the *drum*, which spins thanks to the motor marked in blue on the left. The yellow area, F1, is called the *cyclone*, and it sucks air through the orange pipeline out of the drum (R1).

When coffee beans are added from the hopper (B1), they enter the drum (R1). With the heat from the burner (D1) and the suction from the cyclone (F1), the beans roast through:

* Conduction (contact with the drum surface, which is made of cast iron)
* Convection (from the moving hot air)
* Radiation (emitted from the beans themselves)

For this roaster, I can control the heat level (from 0% to 100%) to manage roast time and environment temperature.  
In the middle of the orange area in the diagram, there’s a black line with a curved hook — that’s the damper. You can manually raise or lower it to adjust the airflow through the pipeline.

Compared with other brands that allow full control of the airflow (by changing cyclone fan speed) and drum rotation speed on-screen, this Probat model doesn’t have those features.

# 2. Physics Terms I’ve Gathered

During my time using the machine, I’ve come across some basic physics terms:

* Heat transfer: conduction, convection, radiation
* Airflow / ventilation

And some more advanced ones that I’ve recently encountered:

* Air pressure and velocity
* Fluid mechanics
* Thermodynamics
* Endothermic & exothermic reactions
* Entropy (no idea what this actually!)
* Bernoulli’s principle
* Venturi effect

Even though I can name these terms, that doesn’t mean I fully understand them — but I try to use them because my instinct tells me they’re important within the scope of my work.

# 3. What I Understand About Airflow from Using the Machine

When we heat the drum environment, we’re heating not only the drum material (cast iron) but also the air surrounding it. This Probat drum is designed with a double layer. The outer layer is in direct contact with the flame underneath, while the inner layer touches the coffee beans.

Since the drum keeps spinning, the beans are constantly being lifted and dropped, allowing enough contact time for conduction. The main driving force of heat transfer is the drum material itself (cast iron), which retains a lot of heat throughout the roast. Meanwhile, hot air flows from inside the drum, through the pipeline, and out through the cyclone to the chimney.

This machine only allows me to adjust heat level during production. I can’t change the drum speed or the cyclone fan speed, as both are fixed. So, I assume the airflow velocity remains steady throughout the process.

Then there’s the **damper**.  
When I close the damper to around **15% open**, the “air sound” around that pipeline area raises its pitch — it sounds like a hiss. When the heat reaches 90–100%, this hiss becomes much louder for a minute or two, then quiets down.

When I open the damper wider (around **45% open**), the hiss disappears and is replaced by a deeper, bass-like sound. So by adjusting the damper, it somehow affects the **air exhaust velocity** — where I believe Bernoulli’s principle and the Venturi effect might come into play — and therefore the **convection** inside the drum.

The manufacturer recommends setting the damper to around **40–45% open** throughout the roast, no less and no more. But being curious, I experimented by opening and closing it at different levels. Here’s what I observed and tried to make sense of:

* When the damper is **too narrow**, the heated air at the start of the roast (when the drum is preheated and the beans are at room temperature) produces that loud hiss — possibly due to increased pressure.
* When the damper is **more open** (around 30–45%), the sound shifts to a deeper tone, suggesting lower pressure.
* I’m not sure what exactly causes the loud hiss, but my theory is that narrowing the damper traps hot air in the drum, and when that air passes through the pipeline and hits the damper area, the pressure increases sharply. This might actually improve convection.
* Conversely, when I open the damper wider, the pressure seems to stabilize — but interestingly, the drum temperature appears **hotter**, which I can’t fully explain. Could it be that the airflow is moving slower? Shouldn’t it exhaust faster instead?

So, I expected that opening the damper wider would *lose* more convection heat, but instead, I observed that the **rate of temperature rise** increased. And when narrowing the damper, I thought it would *trap* more heat — but it didn’t behave that way. This Probat is often described as a heavy-conduction machine, rather than a more versatile conduction/convection type like some other brands. Because I haven’t been fully satisfied with the results I’ve been getting, I really want to understand more about hot air and how it works in the roasting process.

This is where I’m completely lost about how airflow really works — and I hope you guys can help me understand it better. Thank you so much for reading and make a reply to my thread.",1,1762777046.0,AskPhysics,0,1.0,False

I live in Ipswich with my partner and our cat. I moved here for her. The girlfriend, I mean, not the cat. Although the cat is a nice bonus. All of my friends I see in person are her friends, who've been really kind in welcoming me into their circle.

Anyway, I'd love to find someone who needs a bestie, male or female, to chat to regularly and meet up for coffees/pints every now and then (possibly regularly if we get on well) and do all the usual stuff good friends would do.

**The solution:** Free 2 minute quiz that tells you what NOT to buy snd what to buy based on your answers, goals, and current setup.

**Tech stack:** Vanilla JS, no database, pure front end

**What makes it different:**
- Built from analyzing 1000+ Reddit threads (Ai helped me alot in this part)
- Tells people ""don't buy this, save more"" when needed
- No email capture (intentionally friction free)
- Has Amazon affiliate links (transparent about it)
- Updates weekly based on feedback

**Stats after 2 weeks:**
- ~1200 users
- 4.9/5 feedback
- Posted on r/JamesHoffmann, got great feedback

**What I learned:**
- People WANT brutal honesty about budget purchases
- ""What not to buy"" converts better than ""what to buy""
- Free + no email = way more completions

Would love feedback! Especially on UX/conversion optimization.

Unfortunately this has been happening ever since we’ve gotten together about 3 years ago, I always thought I had my problems and traumaresponses under control, as being alone it was not something I was often confronted with. When I was it was easy to manage and I was only hurting myself.

That all changed when I feel deeply in love with the love of my life, she is the most caring and kind person. It was the first time I’ve felt safe, at peace or at home. She is the one that gave me the ability to think about the future, having a house together and raising our own kids. Never before had I honestly hoped to live past 20.

After the honeymoon phase it started becoming clear that I had issues to resolve, when I went to see a professional I was diagnosed with CPTSD, fear of abandonment, anxiety disorder and a plethora of other related illnesses. She was kind and so incredibly understanding and helpful, as she took all the shit I’ve thrown her way. After a longer period she came to the realisation that we both have to work on ourselves before being able to continue in our relationship. We went no-contact for a week and after the photos of our vacation were developed, we met again and we picked up where we left off. This went on and another breakup happend as I barely changed at all. 

After a month we went out for coffee and an activity. I planned the whole day start tot finish. Found the most cute and adventurous coffee place, then we went to a castle, and while sitting there I offered to either go to a city in our country and explore an art exhibit or to go to Antwerp and stay the night. Of course the choice was clear and we headed voor Antwerp, we had the best time and explored the city. We made great memories (and the was deeply impressed by my planning).

We picked it up afterwards, about 2 months ago we got the chance to move in together. And even though it definitely was a risk, I was living with 5 roommates (for 6 years by that time) and I loved the idea of our own place. So we went for it.

Unfortunately I’ve been in a rut the past year, and it got worse during our time living together. I often cancelled shared appointments, made big fights before if I did go to the appointment, and made her feel extreme unsafe by being incredibly easily irritable. Getting very mad and scaring and scarring her. 

To my deepest regret she couldn’t take my shit anymore after the fight two days ago, and she broke up with me. I’ve been absolutely broken ever since, in the practical aspect I have to find a new home, leave the beautiful place we’ve built together. Emotionally I’m a giant wreck, unable to sleep well having nightmares about us and bittersweet dreams about what our future might’ve been. We will be living together until the end of the year, the chances of ever getting back in a loving relationship are slim to none. Seeing as I pulled out all the stops previously and I do not want to keep her from being happy and safe. So if I cannot fix myself I will never deserve her, or anyone as sweet or kind (even though they don’t exist).

I break a few times a day, while we still have some time together I am trying to be the best person I can, the only one she deserves. I want to undertake activities and make some good memories of our lasts months together, we celebrated our housewarming 2 weeks ago and my birthday is coming up in less than a month. I discovered I love hosting (especially together) so I really looked forward to celebrating everything we could. Like my birthday, but also to invite people over for dinner and a few board games. 

There is nothing in my live I actually regret, even though I’ve been through a ton and I’ve made more mistakes then I can count. 

This is the one thing I will regret for the rest of my days, until my last breath I will deeply regret not fixing my problems or at the least make it manageable for myself so I wouldn’t take all of her energy in putting out my fires. 

The cards I’ve been dealt, like all of you were not my fault or doing. But not resolving, fixing or taking care of myself has cost me dearly, more than I can ever put into words. 

Every moment of every day I think about our beautiful memories and it tears me apart that we (most likely) will never enjoy each other’s company  in that sense again. 

She was the girl of my most inconceivable dreams, the only one that gave me love even though I’ve hurt her so much.

TL:DR, I’m a wreck after my gf of 3 years broke up with me after she couldn’t take any more of my unresolved mental illnesses. We still live together and are both incredibly sad about it. I’m at a loss for words and have been for days. She will always the one that got away. 

The lesson for anyone reading this, for who it might not be too late, is fix yourself and love yourself before you accidentally find the partner of your dreams and end up only seeing her again in your dreams because your weren’t ready. 

Sorry for pouring my heart out, I don’t really have anyone else to share it in such detail without judgement.",2,1762776122.0,CPTSD,3,1.0,False

1otbwog,https://www.reddit.com/r/Habits/comments/1otbwog/minimal_effort_maximum_return_heres_what_actually/,Minimal effort. Maximum return. Here's what actually works.,"I'm tired of complicated optimization advice. Here are the simple changes that genuinely transformed my life with almost zero effort:

Walk everywhere (seriously, design your life around this)

Move close to work, groceries, gym  whatever matters to you. Walking is the most underrated life hack. Free therapy. Free exercise. Free thinking time. No traffic stress. No parking anxiety. Just automatic daily movement and mental clarity. This one change fixed my health, my mood, and my bank account.

Earplugs ($2 investment that changed everything)

Best money I've ever spent. Deep sleep even with noise. Focus in chaos. Peace on planes, trains, coffee shops. Your environment is constantly stealing your attention and rest. Two dollars solves it. Keep a pair everywhere nightstand, bag, desk.

Notifications off. All of them. Always.

This is non-negotiable. Every notification is someone else's priority interrupting yours. Your phone should be a tool you use, not a leash that controls you. Turn off every badge, banner, and buzz. Check things when YOU decide, not when an app demands it. This alone will reclaim hours of focus.

Remove negative associations with yourself

Stop calling yourself lazy, stupid, undisciplined, or any other label that reinforces failure. Your brain believes what you repeatedly tell it. Every time you say ""I'm bad at this"" you're training yourself to be bad at it. Rewrite the narrative. You're not lazy, you're learning better systems. You're not stupid, you're building new skills. Words shape identity.

Pocket notebook (just trust me on this)

Carry a small notebook everywhere. Not for journaling or perfect notes. For capturing thoughts before they disappear. Ideas. Tasks. Random observations. Things you need to remember. Getting it out of your head and onto paper frees up mental RAM. Phones don't work for this too many distractions. Paper is instant and focused.

Why these work:

They're all one-time decisions with permanent benefits. You don't need daily willpower or motivation. Set it once, gain forever. No apps to maintain. No habits to track. Just structural changes that automatically improve your life.

Most self-improvement advice is exhausting. ""Wake up at 5 AM! Meditate! Journal! Track macros! Cold showers!"" These things work sure. But they require constant effort.

These five things only need minimal ongoing effort. Maximum return. Just tiny adjustments that quietly compound into a completely different quality of life.

I really like walking the most",2,1762776032.0,Habits,0,1.0,False
1otbvse,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueScaryStories/comments/1otbvse/my_one_creepy_camping_story/,My One Creepy Camping Story,"I used to do lots of camping trips with a friend of mine post college. Most of our trips were in Montana, since that's where we both lived at the time, and that's where this story takes place. 

My friend, Jude, and I used to spontaneously leave on camping road trips where we'd just pick a direction and drive until we found some cool place to hike and camp. Sometimes, we'd look up trails and add 1-2 day backpacking adventures to these trips, but, more often than not, we would end up in an empty campground or some pull off on a forest service road and set up our tent right outside the car for the night.

Looking back, it was wildly irresponsible because we never told anyone where we were going. We almost never had a plan, so if we had gone missing, there would have been no clue as to where to start looking. We almost never had cell service where we camped.

So, the creepy camping story I have happened in 2020, which was the height of Jude and I's spontaneous camping phase. I had taken a week off of work, and we wanted to go up to Glacier and hike and camp for several days, which we did. Since it was covid, camping inside the park was not allowed, so we had to find random spots to camp every night. We stayed at one campground about 180 miles away from West Glacier on the way up, then found a different spot each night closer to the park. All of our campsites near the park were between 10 and 25 miles away from each other because it was difficult to locate spots that were both legal to camp in, and hadn't already been taken up by other park goers. This meant that we sometimes spent hours driving up random forest service roads looking for somewhere secluded to sleep. But, we always managed to find something. 

Here's where it gets creepy: 

The first night of our trip, we stayed at a campground near Drummond, which was about 180 miles from West Glacier. Early in the morning, when it had just started to get light, I heard something walking around the tent. This campground was occupied by a few other campers, so at first I thought that MAYBE one of them was looking for the bathroom. The steps were heavy and deliberate, like whoever it was wasn't trying to be quiet. It was in the grass though, so I couldn't hear individual footfalls. It was more like the sifting through and crushing of grass and twigs. Whatever it was walked within a few feet of our tent, coming from the side facing the woods, not the other campsites or the road. I was only half awake, and I remember thinking two things. One, I'm glad I made sure Jude locked the car, and two, I really hope it's just a very bold deer and not a human. I was super tired and didn't want to think it was anything creepy, so I did my best to fall back asleep and eventually the sounds stopped, though I don't remember them ever moving away. They just weren't there anymore. Jude had prescribed sleeping pills and was a deep sleeper, so I assumed he'd slept through the whole thing. When we both finally got up for the day, I didn't think anything of it, and didn't mention it to him. 

The second night, we were up by West Glacier after a day of hiking, and found a spot not too far from the park entrance. It wasn't a designated campground, but was within a series of dirt roads in a wooded area. We'd seen other people pulled off and camping out of their cars, just like we were. Our tent was set up right next to the car since there wasn't a lot of open space in the pull off we'd found. Again, in the early hours of the morning, just when it was getting light, I woke up and heard someone walking around our tent. This time, the grass wasn't as tall and I distinctly heard the heavy footsteps of a person walking right next to our tent, then around the car. Again, I remember being glad that Jude had locked the car the night before. The footsteps had come from the woods, not the road, and continued moving about around our tent for a while. Then, they eventually stopped without moving away. I, again, went back to sleep, then woke up for the day a couple hours later with Jude and didn't think anything more of it. I assumed it was someone hiking in the area who cut through our campsite as a shortcut. I didn't mention it to Jude. 

The third night, it took us a long time to find a campsite. It was pouring rain, and we were both exhausted from a 13 mile hike. It took us three hours to find a place, and we finally settled on a pull out off of a dirt road above the Hungry Horse dam. We were both uneasy about this spot because it wasn't off a forest service road, and we were a little worried we'd be bothered by traffic on the road, or cops telling us not to camp there. It was remote, but not remote enough, if you know what I mean. The pull off was kind of a little road that went to nowhere, probably used to push snow onto when plowing during the winter. It went about 50 yards into the woods, then ended with a dirt mound. There was an old fire pit and broken glass at the end of it, so we set up our tent near the entrance. It was still pouring rain, and Jude walked around in the mud in his bare feet, while I kept my shoes on and examined the fire pit and broken bottles. Then, we turned in for the night. I noticed too late that Jude had not locked the car, but he was asleep with the keys in his pocket, and I was too tired to get out and do it manually. Plus, it was still raining and I didn't want to get wet. 

In the morning, just when it was starting to get light, I woke up and heard something walking around in the woods above our tent. I thought it was a deer at first because the steps weren't as loud as the ones I'd heard the previous morning. Then, whatever it was came down onto the pull out where our tent was, and began moving around our car. The tent was set up only about 3 feet away from the car, so I could hear whatever it was very distinctly as it walked. The ground was muddy, so the footfalls, were more muffled. Then, I heard the car door open. I remember I'd been only half awake up until that point. I became fully alert then, but was still a little unsure of what I'd actually heard, so I didn't immediately get up. However, I kept listening. Whatever it was kept walking around near the car. There was no sound of another vehicle nearby, so whatever it was had to have walked here. As I listened, I heard the car door shut. I sat fully up at that point, waking Jude up, and said, ""I'm gonna go check that out."" I honestly cannot believe my nerve in that moment, but being scared numb and sleep deprived tends to make me stupidly brave. 

I immediately put on my shoes and opened the tent. By this time, the sounds had stopped completely. Remember, the tent was right next to the car, on the same side as the woods. I would have heard someone walking away. I got out and the first thing I noticed was that nobody was around or inside the car. It was Jude's car and he's a bit of a mess, so no one would be able to fit in there if they weren't in the front seats anyway. The second thing I noticed was that the ground was muddy all around the car and tent and the only footprints in the mud were from my trail runners, and Jude's bare feet. I even followed his barefoot trail around to make sure that every print was his. There were no footprints coming to or from the woods. Nothing. I inspected the car and didn't find anything out of place. No signs of disturbance. I walked over to the fire pit and again could only find my own prints. Then, I did the stupid thing and went past that fire pit into the woods. 

There, I found a weird makeshift shelter made of pallets that had some blankets and women's undergarments in it. It scared the shit out of me initially because I was pretty spooked by this point and I thought there was a body in there. But, upon closer inspection, the whole thing was rained out and undisturbed. Nobody had spent the night there in a long while. Even still, I didn't touch anything, and only came within a few feet of the thing before turning around. I returned to the car and sat inside it while I waited for Jude to finish waking up. Then, we packed up our tent and didn't mention it to each other at all that day. 

On the fourth night, we found a really cool spot below a dirt road on the west side of the park. We got briefly disturbed by a man walking into our campsite, but he just seemed like he was scouting out a place to camp with his family and didn't know we were there. That evening was otherwise uneventful, and we both went to sleep early because Jude wanted to catch the sunrise. I was afraid to miss my alarm, so I woke up in the middle of the night and immediately heard something moving around outside our tent. This time, it was right behind our tent, in the direction of the way we'd come/where we'd left the car. I remember being kind of annoyed that this thing had started up so late when all I wanted to do was sleep. Eventually, the sounds stopped and I did fall asleep. In the early hours of the morning, we got up and broke camp before it got light. My alarm was loud and woke Jude up too. I forgot about the sounds I'd heard in the night, helped pack up the tent, and didn't mention it to him. I was pretty happy when we were finally inside the locked car and were headed to our next destination though, but I have always been a tad scared of the dark. 

We saw a spectacular sunrise that morning. Afterwards, when we were on our way to get breakfast and coffee before heading home, Jude looked over at me and said, ""Have you been hearing something outside our tent every morning?"" I looked at him in shock and said, ""Yes! Remember, I got up to investigate it yesterday?"" And Jude said, ""Yeah, that's really weird. Every morning, I've been hearing it too.""

And we both talked about how strange it was that we'd both heard it, but neither had thought it important to mention afterwards. It was like, even though it was really unsettling, something subconscious had made us both think that it was nothing to dwell on. To this day, I get shivers when I think about hearing whatever that was, and I'm still astounded by the fact that I actually got up one of those mornings to investigate it. But, in those moments, even though I remember acknowledging that it was creepy, I don't remember actually feeling very afraid. And, clearly, I wasn't too worried, because I hadn't once thought to bring it up to Jude. 

So, anyway, that's my one creepy camping story. I would like to add that this was not the first time, nor the last, that I've heard something moving around the tent during a camping trip. However, this trip was the first time it was so consistent, and it's the only time I've ever gone out to see what it was because of how persistent it was. I've had nights where black bears, elk, and deer have come through camp. I've never had the circumstances or the sudden ceasing of the sounds be so creepy. The fact that we never camped in the same place twice but still kept hearing something really weirded me out too. 

To this day, Jude is super unworried and nonchalant about it whereas I almost find it more unnerving each time I retell that story.

(note: This is mainly for mid-market/enterprise deals that follow the classic SaaS Discovery > Demo process. but could be used elsewhere effectively)

Add in a call with your champion between discovery and demo. I call it a bridge call. 

Its easy to do and your demo conversion rate will thank you. 

Essentially you just message your champion a few days before the demo very casually something like: 

""Hey, got 15 mins so I can walk you through my plan for the demo, just want to make sure it aligns with what you're thinking""

  
Now if they say no or ignore it, that's usually a death signal for the deal anyway. Useful data...

  
If they are a true champion and want your product to win then they will agree. 

  
The beauty of this call is that you often get to connect with them outside of the buyer committee where they can be much more open and direct. I've many times had champions talk me through exactly what I should present, how I should sell to their colleagues, who the blockers in the room are, what the objections will be and which competitors we'll be up against. 

Done correctly this call gives you an almost unfair advantage to go and win the deal. 

  
Bonus tip: For enterprise folks or anyone meeting in person. I usually do this with a coffee/beer/lunch with my champion after the formal onsite meeting has taken place. Again, same thing, same outcomes. ",3,1762775862.0,salestechniques,2,1.0,False
1otbuhu,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1otbuhu/i_am_a_paranormal_research_agent_this_is_my_story/,"I am a Paranormal Research Agent, this is my story. Case #005 ""Runestones""","Runestones are inherently powerful; most people in my line of work don't know much about them, and I probably fit into that group, but anyone who has an authorised runestone in their possession is considered a high-priority case to the organisation.

Lily was quiet on the drive to [REDACTED]. She didn't want to talk about anything besides William Grey, and, well, I wanted to talk about anything but him. This silence was rough. She's been stressed with me, angry at me, and even embarrassed for me, but never like this. I don't know what this is.

The drive wasn't that bad; I got some sleep, which, shockingly, wasn't that bad. It wasn't bad at all, actually; ever since my conversation with Imani, my dreams have been almost pleasant, albeit forgetful, which I can't help but feel was his doing.

On one hand, I don't feel totally comfortable with someone manipulating my dreams, but on the other hand, I felt a lot better than I have in a while, discounting the flood of traumatic memories coming back to me all at once.

[REDACTED] was an unbearably small coastal town; no motels around, so I felt shit out of luck. The organisation did kindly spring for a slightly more expensive living arrangement for me and Lily, a bed and breakfast.

We unpacked early. I had my usual gear plus the runestone that Richard gave me a while back. The organisation didn't supply us with a runestone this time, most likely because runestones don't play well together.

I walked out onto the patio and saw Lily; she sat on a small swinging bench with a cup of coffee, overlooking [REDACTED] lake.

""This is feeling like a nice paid vacation. Something tells me some old guy found the runestones and tried selling them to some gimmicky place, not knowing what they are,"" I said whilst looking at Lily. No response from her.

""Maybe we should spend an extra couple of days here after we pick up the runestones; it could be nice out here in the open,"" I said, trying my hardest to drag anything from her.

""Yeah, maybe,"" she said indifferently, and the conversation was killed.

Her attention never left the lake. It hurt to be ignored by her, especially when we're on a case like this.

A few hours later, we were checking out all of the knick-knack stores. My theory about an old guy selling them to someone was a pretty sensible one; elderly people statistically sell the most cursed items.

We didn't find anything except for a cool old copy of Poltergeist on VHS.

I asked the cashier if he had seen any weird-looking rocks, but he didn't give me any new information. Lily was waiting outside with a cigarette in one hand and her other in her pocket.

""No luck. Got any idea where to look next?"" I asked whilst stepping up next to her.

""Nope,"" she said before dropping her cigarette, stepping it out, and walking away from me.

""Oh, come on, Lily, can you at least work with me and be upset later? I need your help,"" I begged, but she only continued to walk down the main street.

I ran after her, and after a few more stores, we still didn't find anything. The sun was going to set soon, and we had a better chance of finding the stones during daylight hours. It's not that they're more dangerous late at night, just that we didn't know what they were or what they could do—way too many variables.

Eventually, we found ourselves at the local diner, like we always do. Lily had ordered an uncharacteristically expensive meal: steak with a side of salad, chips, and a steak sandwich. I went for eggs, toast, and beans with a cup of coffee.

""Double steak, bold choice,"" I said awkwardly. She only gave me a smile. This was beginning to frustrate me.

""Ok, Lily, I'm sick of this. Please just talk to me. Why are you walling me out all of a sudden?"" I asked with a bit more desperation than I wanted to.

""Me, walling you out?"" She scoffed. ""Elijah, you just rediscovered a messed-up child-killing whatever-the-fuck from your childhood is hunting you down, and you don't even want to talk about it. How can we prepare for this thing if you don't even want me involved? How the hell do you expect to survive?!"" She shouted out. The cutlery in my hands began to shake, and so did the cup next to me. The diner went quiet, and I could see tears well up in her eyes.

""Elijah, I don't think you have stepped out of your shoes and thought about what it's like in mine, but I don't choose to do this; I don't get paid for it. This isn't a job; it's service. I don't enjoy much of my life, but the parts I do enjoy are the cases with you. You're close to being my only friend in the organisation, and I don't really have the opportunity to meet people outside of it.""

""Lily, I'm sorry, I didn't realise.""

""Just shut up, Elijah,"" she cut me off and placed her face in her palms.

The cup and cutlery stopped shaking, and everything calmed down slightly. Things were tense but better than before; we had talked. The silence in the diner lingered. I was about to say something when a man’s voice carried from behind us:

""Well anyway, kids, Pop Pop had told me that he found some pretty nifty toys for you both; he says that they're little glowy pebbles that can grant magic wishes. Oh, that Pop Pop always had a wild imagination, didn't he?"" a voice said a few stalls behind us after the silence fizzled out. I and Lily's heads shot up, and as we made eye contact, we both knew what was happening.

For the time being, we had an unspoken truce; we didn't have an exact plan on how to approach this family, but we knew that we had to grab at the lead.

Lily shot out of our stall, and I followed quickly behind her.

""Hello, sir, my name is Lilianne Moore; this is my assistant, Dick Cabeza. I am interested in buying these magic rocks,"" Lily said with more confidence than I could ever muster; the name she used for me was odd, not one of our assigned aliases.

""Oh my, well,"" the man who looked very much like Ned Flanders looked to his two kids and then back at us. ""Well, you see, they're actually my wife's fathers, and he sort of promised them to my kids,"" he said apologetically.

Lily grabbed a notebook out of her jacket pocket, wrote something down, and gave it to the man, who audibly gulped. ""Sorry, kids, I'll buy you something else. Would you like me to take you to him now?""

We drove out to a small cabin a few minutes out of town; the woods mean something different to me now than they did before rediscovering my time in Stalborn.

We pulled up to the cabin, and an old man stepped out and waved us down. He looked pretty jolly.

""Well hello there, Brent,"" the old man said and poked his head into the car. He was smiling and looked excited; both of these emotions died when he realised his grandkids weren't in the car and two fully grown adults were sitting in the seats.

""Who are these fine folks?"" the old man said sceptically.

""They're collectors! They're here for the rocks?"" Brent said. He hoped out of the car, and we followed suit; the older man made a point to keep his eyes on us.

""You know, Brent, I really meant for this to be gifts for the kids,"" the old man said in a hushed tone to his son-in-law that I was just able to hear.

We entered the cabin, which in all fairness was really nice, with a real rustic vibe. I immediately took notice of a large ceramic bowl on a small table in front of the couch that had a handful of runestones in it. I nudged Lily with my elbow and gestured with my head; she nodded her head.

""Well, if you don't mind me asking, what are you folks collectors of? Just rocks?"" the man asked slowly.

""Yup, anything rock-related that is special, you know, weird stuff,"" Lily said. We were both facing the rocks.

Thump.

Me and Lily jolted around to find the old man standing over Brent's body; he held a bloodstained ceramic bust in his hand.

""Now I am going to ask one more time: what is it you people collect?"" the man said quietly.

""Holy fuck!"" I yelped before the man threw the bust in our direction. Lily held her hand out and motioned it out of the way. The bust followed her hand movement and smashed through a window.

The man grabbed a runestone out of his pocket and held it to his mouth.

""Fœra,"" he whispered before throwing it behind us. It hit the campfire, and the man erupted in light blue smoke and lightning before reappearing behind us and grabbing another runestone.

""I warn you both, this runestone can make me summon anything I want from any realm. Make any sudden move, and all I have to say is 'minnast,' and you get to say bye-bye,"" he said, holding the runestone.

Wait a minute?

That can't be right.

The 'minnast' runestone is the sister stone of the 'útlagr' stone I used in the bus against the bus driver. 'Útlagr' banishes entities that aren't native to this realm, and 'minnast' recalls things that are native to this realm; it's worthless in an old cabin.

""Try it, I dare you,"" I said. I reached for the large silver knife that Richard gave me; it was sheathed in my belt, and I held it out in front of me.

""Have it your way, dumbass, Minnast!"" he whispered and slammed the runestone to the floor. Lily shot her hand out, but I held my hand up and mouthed, 'Just wait.' The man was in deep concentration, probably trying to summon a powerful entity or something—idiot.

And then the house shook.

And the lights flickered.

""Yes, yes, come to me, my minion, dispose of these pesky intruders,"" the old man said. ""Fuck, did I get this wrong?"" I suddenly looked at Lily and shook my head. She telepathically pushed the old man against the wall, and he fell to his knees.

""Marvy?"" a feminine ethereal voice croaked out from upstairs. The old man froze, and his face turned white. ""Marvy, is that you? What happened? Why have you done this to us, to me?"" The voice became ever angrier.

""It can't be you; please, it can't be. I killed you. Stay back!"" he screamed, squirming onto his back and crawling towards the back wall, or as far away from the stairs as he could.

A woman stepped down the stairs; she was glowing white and was translucent. This woman knows 'Marvy' and doesn't seem happy with him. In that moment it clicked.

""Ohhhhhhhhh, you killed your wife,"" I said absently, which made the spectre flicker violently.

She was flickering in and out of our realm. This was a Type-A spectre that could very quickly become Type-P.

""I'm sorry, please, I'm sorry,"" Marvy said. His wife reached her hand out towards the kitchen and very quickly threw it towards Marvy. A knife suddenly flung through the air, and Lily tried to intervene, but she wasn't fast enough.

The knife embedded itself into Marvy's chest, right where his heart would be, if a man like him could have one, that is.

""ELIJAH, GRAB THE RUNESTONES AND RUN,"" Lily shouted at me. I dived for the ceramic bowl and poured its contents into my bag. I looked behind me, and Lily was throwing salt at the spectre, who, in turn, had begun to throw increasingly large furniture at her.

I zipped the bag up and opened the front door, hurled the bag out near the car, and turned back at the spectre and the telepath. I could tell Lily was at the peak of her abilities, but the spectre was still building itself up. I grabbed my knife and ran to the kitchen, found a bag of salt—not ideal, but it would do. I stabbed the knife into the salt repeatedly until it was somewhat coated, and I ran back to the spectre and threw it at her.

It stopped her for a moment, and that's all that I needed.

""Judge Thou, O Lord, them that wrong me: overthrow them that fight against me."" I shouted, and the spectre began to scream in pain.

""Let them be confounded and ashamed that seek after my soul. Let them be turned back and be confounded that devise evil against me."" I continued. The spectre reached out to grab me, but Lily used her abilities to cage it in a type of bubble.

""Let them become as dust before the wind, and let the Angel of the Lord straighten them."" I finished. As I said those last words, the spectre seemed to scream out a final breath before folding into herself, being sucked into the great beyond where souls belong.

A few hours later, we were driving back to headquarters like nothing had happened, runestones retrieved and the case closed. Lily sat in the passenger seat, drifting off to sleep.

""Look, I'm sorry I didn't want to talk to you about William Grey. The truth is that I don't even know what to think about it. We don't even know if Imani was telling the truth. It could want nothing to do with me. I don't know, Lil; I'm not good at people stuff, but we work better together, and I'm scared. I just don't want it to get you like it did Randy, Luc, or Mick,"" I said with what felt like a rock in my throat.

""Yeah, well, I'm a little more experienced than the average person,"" Lily said a little strictly.

""God, I hope so,"" I said. She smiled at that and punched me. ""Once we get back to headquarters, we can talk more about this, alright?"" I looked over at her, and she smiled and gave me a nod. I could tell that it meant something to her. 

""Where the hell did you learn an exorcism prayer anywhere? I didn't know you were religious,"" Lily said after a moment.

""I'm not, but faith is one powerful thing. Millions of people around the world believe in some type of god, so there must be some type of power there. I thought I'd at least give it a try,"" I said nonchalantly, ""and plus, Richard made me promise him that I'd learn at least some type of exorcism prayer.""

""Fair enough. Maybe I should start working on my Buddhism,"" she said before yawning and turning over. I hope that Imani gives her the sound of sleep that he gives me; she deserves it after all that she's done.",1,1762775841.0,stories,0,1.0,False

Case #005 ""Runestones""","Runestones are inherently powerful; most people in my line of work don't know much about them, and I probably fit into that group, but anyone who has an authorised runestone in their possession is considered a high-priority case to the organisation.

Lily was quiet on the drive to [REDACTED]. She didn't want to talk about anything besides William Grey, and, well, I wanted to talk about anything but him. This silence was rough. She's been stressed with me, angry at me, and even embarrassed for me, but never like this. I don't know what this is.

The drive wasn't that bad; I got some sleep, which, shockingly, wasn't that bad. It wasn't bad at all, actually; ever since my conversation with Imani, my dreams have been almost pleasant, albeit forgetful, which I can't help but feel was his doing.

On one hand, I don't feel totally comfortable with someone manipulating my dreams, but on the other hand, I felt a lot better than I have in a while, discounting the flood of traumatic memories coming back to me all at once.

[REDACTED] was an unbearably small coastal town; no motels around, so I felt shit out of luck. The organisation did kindly spring for a slightly more expensive living arrangement for me and Lily, a bed and breakfast.

We unpacked early. I had my usual gear plus the runestone that Richard gave me a while back. The organisation didn't supply us with a runestone this time, most likely because runestones don't play well together.

I walked out onto the patio and saw Lily; she sat on a small swinging bench with a cup of coffee, overlooking [REDACTED] lake.

""This is feeling like a nice paid vacation. Something tells me some old guy found the runestones and tried selling them to some gimmicky place, not knowing what they are,"" I said whilst looking at Lily. No response from her.

""Maybe we should spend an extra couple of days here after we pick up the runestones; it could be nice out here in the open,"" I said, trying my hardest to drag anything from her.

""Yeah, maybe,"" she said indifferently, and the conversation was killed.

Her attention never left the lake. It hurt to be ignored by her, especially when we're on a case like this.

A few hours later, we were checking out all of the knick-knack stores. My theory about an old guy selling them to someone was a pretty sensible one; elderly people statistically sell the most cursed items.

We didn't find anything except for a cool old copy of Poltergeist on VHS.

I asked the cashier if he had seen any weird-looking rocks, but he didn't give me any new information. Lily was waiting outside with a cigarette in one hand and her other in her pocket.

""No luck. Got any idea where to look next?"" I asked whilst stepping up next to her.

""Nope,"" she said before dropping her cigarette, stepping it out, and walking away from me.

""Oh, come on, Lily, can you at least work with me and be upset later? I need your help,"" I begged, but she only continued to walk down the main street.

I ran after her, and after a few more stores, we still didn't find anything. The sun was going to set soon, and we had a better chance of finding the stones during daylight hours. It's not that they're more dangerous late at night, just that we didn't know what they were or what they could do—way too many variables.

Eventually, we found ourselves at the local diner, like we always do. Lily had ordered an uncharacteristically expensive meal: steak with a side of salad, chips, and a steak sandwich. I went for eggs, toast, and beans with a cup of coffee.

""Double steak, bold choice,"" I said awkwardly. She only gave me a smile. This was beginning to frustrate me.

""Ok, Lily, I'm sick of this. Please just talk to me. Why are you walling me out all of a sudden?"" I asked with a bit more desperation than I wanted to.

""Me, walling you out?"" She scoffed. ""Elijah, you just rediscovered a messed-up child-killing whatever-the-fuck from your childhood is hunting you down, and you don't even want to talk about it. How can we prepare for this thing if you don't even want me involved? How the hell do you expect to survive?!"" She shouted out. The cutlery in my hands began to shake, and so did the cup next to me. The diner went quiet, and I could see tears well up in her eyes.

""Elijah, I don't think you have stepped out of your shoes and thought about what it's like in mine, but I don't choose to do this; I don't get paid for it. This isn't a job; it's service. I don't enjoy much of my life, but the parts I do enjoy are the cases with you. You're close to being my only friend in the organisation, and I don't really have the opportunity to meet people outside of it.""

""Lily, I'm sorry, I didn't realise.""

""Just shut up, Elijah,"" she cut me off and placed her face in her palms.

The cup and cutlery stopped shaking, and everything calmed down slightly. Things were tense but better than before; we had talked. The silence in the diner lingered. I was about to say something when a man’s voice carried from behind us:

""Well anyway, kids, Pop Pop had told me that he found some pretty nifty toys for you both; he says that they're little glowy pebbles that can grant magic wishes. Oh, that Pop Pop always had a wild imagination, didn't he?"" a voice said a few stalls behind us after the silence fizzled out. I and Lily's heads shot up, and as we made eye contact, we both knew what was happening.

For the time being, we had an unspoken truce; we didn't have an exact plan on how to approach this family, but we knew that we had to grab at the lead.

Lily shot out of our stall, and I followed quickly behind her.

""Hello, sir, my name is Lilianne Moore; this is my assistant, Dick Cabeza. I am interested in buying these magic rocks,"" Lily said with more confidence than I could ever muster; the name she used for me was odd, not one of our assigned aliases.

""Oh my, well,"" the man who looked very much like Ned Flanders looked to his two kids and then back at us. ""Well, you see, they're actually my wife's fathers, and he sort of promised them to my kids,"" he said apologetically.

Lily grabbed a notebook out of her jacket pocket, wrote something down, and gave it to the man, who audibly gulped. ""Sorry, kids, I'll buy you something else. Would you like me to take you to him now?""

We drove out to a small cabin a few minutes out of town; the woods mean something different to me now than they did before rediscovering my time in Stalborn.

We pulled up to the cabin, and an old man stepped out and waved us down. He looked pretty jolly.

""I warn you both, this runestone can make me summon anything I want from any realm. Make any sudden move, and all I have to say is 'minnast,' and you get to say bye-bye,"" he said, holding the runestone.

Wait a minute?

That can't be right.

The 'minnast' runestone is the sister stone of the 'útlagr' stone I used in the bus against the bus driver. 'Útlagr' banishes entities that aren't native to this realm, and 'minnast' recalls things that are native to this realm; it's worthless in an old cabin.

""Try it, I dare you,"" I said. I reached for the large silver knife that Richard gave me; it was sheathed in my belt, and I held it out in front of me.

""Have it your way, dumbass, Minnast!"" he whispered and slammed the runestone to the floor. Lily shot her hand out, but I held my hand up and mouthed, 'Just wait.' The man was in deep concentration, probably trying to summon a powerful entity or something—idiot.

And then the house shook.

And the lights flickered.

""Yes, yes, come to me, my minion, dispose of these pesky intruders,"" the old man said. ""Fuck, did I get this wrong?"" I suddenly looked at Lily and shook my head. She telepathically pushed the old man against the wall, and he fell to his knees.

""Marvy?"" a feminine ethereal voice croaked out from upstairs. The old man froze, and his face turned white. ""Marvy, is that you? What happened? Why have you done this to us, to me?"" The voice became ever angrier.

""It can't be you; please, it can't be. I killed you. Stay back!"" he screamed, squirming onto his back and crawling towards the back wall, or as far away from the stairs as he could.

A woman stepped down the stairs; she was glowing white and was translucent. This woman knows 'Marvy' and doesn't seem happy with him. In that moment it clicked.

""Ohhhhhhhhh, you killed your wife,"" I said absently, which made the spectre flicker violently.

She was flickering in and out of our realm. This was a Type-A spectre that could very quickly become Type-P.

""I'm sorry, please, I'm sorry,"" Marvy said. His wife reached her hand out towards the kitchen and very quickly threw it towards Marvy. A knife suddenly flung through the air, and Lily tried to intervene, but she wasn't fast enough.

The knife embedded itself into Marvy's chest, right where his heart would be, if a man like him could have one, that is.

""ELIJAH, GRAB THE RUNESTONES AND RUN,"" Lily shouted at me. I dived for the ceramic bowl and poured its contents into my bag. I looked behind me, and Lily was throwing salt at the spectre, who, in turn, had begun to throw increasingly large furniture at her.

I zipped the bag up and opened the front door, hurled the bag out near the car, and turned back at the spectre and the telepath. I could tell Lily was at the peak of her abilities, but the spectre was still building itself up. I grabbed my knife and ran to the kitchen, found a bag of salt—not ideal, but it would do. I stabbed the knife into the salt repeatedly until it was somewhat coated, and I ran back to the spectre and threw it at her.

It stopped her for a moment, and that's all that I needed.

""Judge Thou, O Lord, them that wrong me: overthrow them that fight against me."" I shouted, and the spectre began to scream in pain.

""Let them be confounded and ashamed that seek after my soul. Let them be turned back and be confounded that devise evil against me."" I continued. The spectre reached out to grab me, but Lily used her abilities to cage it in a type of bubble.

""Let them become as dust before the wind, and let the Angel of the Lord straighten them."" I finished. As I said those last words, the spectre seemed to scream out a final breath before folding into herself, being sucked into the great beyond where souls belong.

A few hours later, we were driving back to headquarters like nothing had happened, runestones retrieved and the case closed. Lily sat in the passenger seat, drifting off to sleep.

""Look, I'm sorry I didn't want to talk to you about William Grey. The truth is that I don't even know what to think about it. We don't even know if Imani was telling the truth. It could want nothing to do with me. I don't know, Lil; I'm not good at people stuff, but we work better together, and I'm scared. I just don't want it to get you like it did Randy, Luc, or Mick,"" I said with what felt like a rock in my throat.

""Yeah, well, I'm a little more experienced than the average person,"" Lily said a little strictly.

""God, I hope so,"" I said. She smiled at that and punched me. ""Once we get back to headquarters, we can talk more about this, alright?"" I looked over at her, and she smiled and gave me a nod. I could tell that it meant something to her. 

""Where the hell did you learn an exorcism prayer anywhere? I didn't know you were religious,"" Lily said after a moment.

""I'm not, but faith is one powerful thing. Millions of people around the world believe in some type of god, so there must be some type of power there. I thought I'd at least give it a try,"" I said nonchalantly, ""and plus, Richard made me promise him that I'd learn at least some type of exorcism prayer.""

""Fair enough. Maybe I should start working on my Buddhism,"" she said before yawning and turning over. I hope that Imani gives her the sound of sleep that he gives me; she deserves it after all that she's done.",1,1762775738.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

Hey there! My name is Brad and I am 36/m from the East Coast. I am up early this Monday morning and I’d love a voice call or chat to start my morning! Let’s talk about anything and everything that comes to mind as we enjoy our coffee or tea, I’m here if you need to vent! 

A little about me, I live alone with two cats, enjoy video games, reading, going to the gym, hiking, love music, play guitar, love coffee and taking naps.

1otbt2n,https://www.reddit.com/r/TelegramBots/comments/1otbt2n/made_a_chatbot_out_of_loneliness/,Made A chatbot out of loneliness.,"Hey everyone,

I’ll just say it: Last year was really lonely for me. Between working from home and moving to a new city, I found it harder than ever to just… talk to someone. The big social media apps felt like shouting into a void, and even the classic chat sites were often overwhelming.

I missed the simple, magic feeling of Omegle in its early days—that thrill of connecting with a complete stranger, with no judgments, no profiles, just two people having a real conversation.

So, I decided to build the thing I needed.

I want to introduce you to AnonWorldChat, a Telegram bot I coded. It’s my attempt to fight back against that lonely feeling, for me and for anyone else who feels it.

The idea is simple:

•	⁠Truly Anonymous.No profiles, no usernames, no followers. Just you and a random partner. •	⁠Zero Pressure.The chat is 1-on-1. If you vibe, keep talking. If not, just hit ""next"" and meet someone new. No hard feelings. •	⁠It’s on Telegram.*mSo it’s fast, secure, and works right from the app you probably already have.

This isn’t some corporate project. It’s a passion project built on late nights and too much coffee. I built it because I believe that even brief, anonymous connections can make a day a little less lonely.

If you've ever felt the same way, I'd be incredibly grateful if you gave it a try.

Bot name - @anonworldchat_bot
Or search AnonWorldChat

I’m also desperate for your feedback. What features would make it better? Should we have chat topics? Let me know what you think in the comments.

Maybe I’ll even see you in there.

1otbt23,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineMarketing/comments/1otbt23/say_who_your_product_is_not_for/,Say who your product is NOT for,"I had many reads over the weekend, this one might interest you..

**Say who your product is** ***not*** **for |** by Science Says

\- Here is a word about how most brands focus on telling everyone who their product is for.   
That makes messages sound generic and broad. The research shows that saying who your product isn’t for actually makes it feel more specific and trustworthy.

A study from the University of Alabama, Georgetown, and Florida International University found that negative framing - like saying “Not for people who like mild coffee” - makes products seem more targeted. Across 8 experiments, participants were up to 48% more likely to choose or click when brands framed their message this way.

Why? Because people interpret “not for everyone” as “made for me.” When brands define their boundaries, audiences see expertise and specialization. The message feels confident, not desperate.

Key Takeaways

* ^(Saying who your product is) *^(not)* ^(for boosts engagement and buying intent.)
* ^(Dark roast coffee and hot sauce tests showed 11% to 48% higher purchase rates.)
* ^(The effect comes from perceived specialization - people believe it’s “made for them.”)
* ^(Works best when strong personal preference exists (flavor, comfort, design).)
* ^(Should be tested before wide rollout to ensure fit for your market.)

What You Can Do

* Use “not for” framing in your headlines, ads, and product descriptions.
* Define your anti-persona clearly (who should *not* buy).
* Try examples like:
   * “Not for people who love sweet coffee.”
   * “Not for those who prefer quiet gyms.”
   * “Not for founders chasing vanity metrics.”
* Test both versions (positive vs. negative) with small ad budgets.
* Keep tone confident, not arrogant - exclusion should clarify, not insult.

Case #005 ""Runestones""","Runestones are inherently powerful; most people in my line of work don't know much about them, and I probably fit into that group, but anyone who has an authorised runestone in their possession is considered a high-priority case to the organisation.

Lily was quiet on the drive to [REDACTED]. She didn't want to talk about anything besides William Grey, and, well, I wanted to talk about anything but him. This silence was rough. She's been stressed with me, angry at me, and even embarrassed for me, but never like this. I don't know what this is.

The drive wasn't that bad; I got some sleep, which, shockingly, wasn't that bad. It wasn't bad at all, actually; ever since my conversation with Imani, my dreams have been almost pleasant, albeit forgetful, which I can't help but feel was his doing.

On one hand, I don't feel totally comfortable with someone manipulating my dreams, but on the other hand, I felt a lot better than I have in a while, discounting the flood of traumatic memories coming back to me all at once.

[REDACTED] was an unbearably small coastal town; no motels around, so I felt shit out of luck. The organisation did kindly spring for a slightly more expensive living arrangement for me and Lily, a bed and breakfast.

We unpacked early. I had my usual gear plus the runestone that Richard gave me a while back. The organisation didn't supply us with a runestone this time, most likely because runestones don't play well together.

I walked out onto the patio and saw Lily; she sat on a small swinging bench with a cup of coffee, overlooking [REDACTED] lake.

""This is feeling like a nice paid vacation. Something tells me some old guy found the runestones and tried selling them to some gimmicky place, not knowing what they are,"" I said whilst looking at Lily. No response from her.

""Maybe we should spend an extra couple of days here after we pick up the runestones; it could be nice out here in the open,"" I said, trying my hardest to drag anything from her.

""Yeah, maybe,"" she said indifferently, and the conversation was killed.

Her attention never left the lake. It hurt to be ignored by her, especially when we're on a case like this.

A few hours later, we were checking out all of the knick-knack stores. My theory about an old guy selling them to someone was a pretty sensible one; elderly people statistically sell the most cursed items.

We didn't find anything except for a cool old copy of Poltergeist on VHS.

I asked the cashier if he had seen any weird-looking rocks, but he didn't give me any new information. Lily was waiting outside with a cigarette in one hand and her other in her pocket.

""No luck. Got any idea where to look next?"" I asked whilst stepping up next to her.

""Nope,"" she said before dropping her cigarette, stepping it out, and walking away from me.

""Oh, come on, Lily, can you at least work with me and be upset later? I need your help,"" I begged, but she only continued to walk down the main street.

I ran after her, and after a few more stores, we still didn't find anything. The sun was going to set soon, and we had a better chance of finding the stones during daylight hours. It's not that they're more dangerous late at night, just that we didn't know what they were or what they could do—way too many variables.

Eventually, we found ourselves at the local diner, like we always do. Lily had ordered an uncharacteristically expensive meal: steak with a side of salad, chips, and a steak sandwich. I went for eggs, toast, and beans with a cup of coffee.

""Double steak, bold choice,"" I said awkwardly. She only gave me a smile. This was beginning to frustrate me.

""Ok, Lily, I'm sick of this. Please just talk to me. Why are you walling me out all of a sudden?"" I asked with a bit more desperation than I wanted to.

""Me, walling you out?"" She scoffed. ""Elijah, you just rediscovered a messed-up child-killing whatever-the-fuck from your childhood is hunting you down, and you don't even want to talk about it. How can we prepare for this thing if you don't even want me involved? How the hell do you expect to survive?!"" She shouted out. The cutlery in my hands began to shake, and so did the cup next to me. The diner went quiet, and I could see tears well up in her eyes.

""Elijah, I don't think you have stepped out of your shoes and thought about what it's like in mine, but I don't choose to do this; I don't get paid for it. This isn't a job; it's service. I don't enjoy much of my life, but the parts I do enjoy are the cases with you. You're close to being my only friend in the organisation, and I don't really have the opportunity to meet people outside of it.""

""Lily, I'm sorry, I didn't realise.""

""Just shut up, Elijah,"" she cut me off and placed her face in her palms.

The cup and cutlery stopped shaking, and everything calmed down slightly. Things were tense but better than before; we had talked. The silence in the diner lingered. I was about to say something when a man’s voice carried from behind us:

""Well anyway, kids, Pop Pop had told me that he found some pretty nifty toys for you both; he says that they're little glowy pebbles that can grant magic wishes. Oh, that Pop Pop always had a wild imagination, didn't he?"" a voice said a few stalls behind us after the silence fizzled out. I and Lily's heads shot up, and as we made eye contact, we both knew what was happening.

For the time being, we had an unspoken truce; we didn't have an exact plan on how to approach this family, but we knew that we had to grab at the lead.

Lily shot out of our stall, and I followed quickly behind her.

""Hello, sir, my name is Lilianne Moore; this is my assistant, Dick Cabeza. I am interested in buying these magic rocks,"" Lily said with more confidence than I could ever muster; the name she used for me was odd, not one of our assigned aliases.

""Oh my, well,"" the man who looked very much like Ned Flanders looked to his two kids and then back at us. ""Well, you see, they're actually my wife's fathers, and he sort of promised them to my kids,"" he said apologetically.

Lily grabbed a notebook out of her jacket pocket, wrote something down, and gave it to the man, who audibly gulped. ""Sorry, kids, I'll buy you something else. Would you like me to take you to him now?""

We drove out to a small cabin a few minutes out of town; the woods mean something different to me now than they did before rediscovering my time in Stalborn.

We pulled up to the cabin, and an old man stepped out and waved us down. He looked pretty jolly.

""Well hello there, Brent,"" the old man said and poked his head into the car. He was smiling and looked excited; both of these emotions died when he realised his grandkids weren't in the car and two fully grown adults were sitting in the seats.

""Who are these fine folks?"" the old man said sceptically.

""They're collectors! They're here for the rocks?"" Brent said. He hoped out of the car, and we followed suit; the older man made a point to keep his eyes on us.

""You know, Brent, I really meant for this to be gifts for the kids,"" the old man said in a hushed tone to his son-in-law that I was just able to hear.

We entered the cabin, which in all fairness was really nice, with a real rustic vibe. I immediately took notice of a large ceramic bowl on a small table in front of the couch that had a handful of runestones in it. I nudged Lily with my elbow and gestured with my head; she nodded her head.

""Well, if you don't mind me asking, what are you folks collectors of? Just rocks?"" the man asked slowly.

""Yup, anything rock-related that is special, you know, weird stuff,"" Lily said. We were both facing the rocks.

Thump.

Me and Lily jolted around to find the old man standing over Brent's body; he held a bloodstained ceramic bust in his hand.

""Now I am going to ask one more time: what is it you people collect?"" the man said quietly.

""Holy fuck!"" I yelped before the man threw the bust in our direction. Lily held her hand out and motioned it out of the way. The bust followed her hand movement and smashed through a window.

The man grabbed a runestone out of his pocket and held it to his mouth.

""Fœra,"" he whispered before throwing it behind us. It hit the campfire, and the man erupted in light blue smoke and lightning before reappearing behind us and grabbing another runestone.

""I warn you both, this runestone can make me summon anything I want from any realm. Make any sudden move, and all I have to say is 'minnast,' and you get to say bye-bye,"" he said, holding the runestone.

Wait a minute?

That can't be right.

The 'minnast' runestone is the sister stone of the 'útlagr' stone I used in the bus against the bus driver. 'Útlagr' banishes entities that aren't native to this realm, and 'minnast' recalls things that are native to this realm; it's worthless in an old cabin.

""Try it, I dare you,"" I said. I reached for the large silver knife that Richard gave me; it was sheathed in my belt, and I held it out in front of me.

""Have it your way, dumbass, Minnast!"" he whispered and slammed the runestone to the floor. Lily shot her hand out, but I held my hand up and mouthed, 'Just wait.' The man was in deep concentration, probably trying to summon a powerful entity or something—idiot.

And then the house shook.

And the lights flickered.

""Yes, yes, come to me, my minion, dispose of these pesky intruders,"" the old man said. ""Fuck, did I get this wrong?"" I suddenly looked at Lily and shook my head. She telepathically pushed the old man against the wall, and he fell to his knees.

""Marvy?"" a feminine ethereal voice croaked out from upstairs. The old man froze, and his face turned white. ""Marvy, is that you? What happened? Why have you done this to us, to me?"" The voice became ever angrier.

""It can't be you; please, it can't be. I killed you. Stay back!"" he screamed, squirming onto his back and crawling towards the back wall, or as far away from the stairs as he could.

A woman stepped down the stairs; she was glowing white and was translucent. This woman knows 'Marvy' and doesn't seem happy with him. In that moment it clicked.

""Ohhhhhhhhh, you killed your wife,"" I said absently, which made the spectre flicker violently.

She was flickering in and out of our realm. This was a Type-A spectre that could very quickly become Type-P.

""I'm sorry, please, I'm sorry,"" Marvy said. His wife reached her hand out towards the kitchen and very quickly threw it towards Marvy. A knife suddenly flung through the air, and Lily tried to intervene, but she wasn't fast enough.

The knife embedded itself into Marvy's chest, right where his heart would be, if a man like him could have one, that is.

""Who are these fine folks?"" the old man said sceptically.

""They're collectors! They're here for the rocks?"" Brent said. He hoped out of the car, and we followed suit; the older man made a point to keep his eyes on us.

""You know, Brent, I really meant for this to be gifts for the kids,"" the old man said in a hushed tone to his son-in-law that I was just able to hear.

We entered the cabin, which in all fairness was really nice, with a real rustic vibe. I immediately took notice of a large ceramic bowl on a small table in front of the couch that had a handful of runestones in it. I nudged Lily with my elbow and gestured with my head; she nodded her head.

""Well, if you don't mind me asking, what are you folks collectors of? Just rocks?"" the man asked slowly.

""Yup, anything rock-related that is special, you know, weird stuff,"" Lily said. We were both facing the rocks.

Thump.

Me and Lily jolted around to find the old man standing over Brent's body; he held a bloodstained ceramic bust in his hand.

""Now I am going to ask one more time: what is it you people collect?"" the man said quietly.

""Holy fuck!"" I yelped before the man threw the bust in our direction. Lily held her hand out and motioned it out of the way. The bust followed her hand movement and smashed through a window.

The man grabbed a runestone out of his pocket and held it to his mouth.

""Fœra,"" he whispered before throwing it behind us. It hit the campfire, and the man erupted in light blue smoke and lightning before reappearing behind us and grabbing another runestone.

""I warn you both, this runestone can make me summon anything I want from any realm. Make any sudden move, and all I have to say is 'minnast,' and you get to say bye-bye,"" he said, holding the runestone.

Wait a minute?

That can't be right.

The 'minnast' runestone is the sister stone of the 'útlagr' stone I used in the bus against the bus driver. 'Útlagr' banishes entities that aren't native to this realm, and 'minnast' recalls things that are native to this realm; it's worthless in an old cabin.

""Try it, I dare you,"" I said. I reached for the large silver knife that Richard gave me; it was sheathed in my belt, and I held it out in front of me.

""Have it your way, dumbass, Minnast!"" he whispered and slammed the runestone to the floor. Lily shot her hand out, but I held my hand up and mouthed, 'Just wait.' The man was in deep concentration, probably trying to summon a powerful entity or something—idiot.

And then the house shook.

And the lights flickered.

""Yes, yes, come to me, my minion, dispose of these pesky intruders,"" the old man said. ""Fuck, did I get this wrong?"" I suddenly looked at Lily and shook my head. She telepathically pushed the old man against the wall, and he fell to his knees.

""Marvy?"" a feminine ethereal voice croaked out from upstairs. The old man froze, and his face turned white. ""Marvy, is that you? What happened? Why have you done this to us, to me?"" The voice became ever angrier.

""It can't be you; please, it can't be. I killed you. Stay back!"" he screamed, squirming onto his back and crawling towards the back wall, or as far away from the stairs as he could.

A woman stepped down the stairs; she was glowing white and was translucent. This woman knows 'Marvy' and doesn't seem happy with him. In that moment it clicked.

""Ohhhhhhhhh, you killed your wife,"" I said absently, which made the spectre flicker violently.

She was flickering in and out of our realm. This was a Type-A spectre that could very quickly become Type-P.

""I'm sorry, please, I'm sorry,"" Marvy said. His wife reached her hand out towards the kitchen and very quickly threw it towards Marvy. A knife suddenly flung through the air, and Lily tried to intervene, but she wasn't fast enough.

The knife embedded itself into Marvy's chest, right where his heart would be, if a man like him could have one, that is.

""ELIJAH, GRAB THE RUNESTONES AND RUN,"" Lily shouted at me. I dived for the ceramic bowl and poured its contents into my bag. I looked behind me, and Lily was throwing salt at the spectre, who, in turn, had begun to throw increasingly large furniture at her.

I zipped the bag up and opened the front door, hurled the bag out near the car, and turned back at the spectre and the telepath. I could tell Lily was at the peak of her abilities, but the spectre was still building itself up. I grabbed my knife and ran to the kitchen, found a bag of salt—not ideal, but it would do. I stabbed the knife into the salt repeatedly until it was somewhat coated, and I ran back to the spectre and threw it at her.

It stopped her for a moment, and that's all that I needed.

""Judge Thou, O Lord, them that wrong me: overthrow them that fight against me."" I shouted, and the spectre began to scream in pain.

""Let them be confounded and ashamed that seek after my soul. Let them be turned back and be confounded that devise evil against me."" I continued. The spectre reached out to grab me, but Lily used her abilities to cage it in a type of bubble.

""Let them become as dust before the wind, and let the Angel of the Lord straighten them."" I finished. As I said those last words, the spectre seemed to scream out a final breath before folding into herself, being sucked into the great beyond where souls belong.

A few hours later, we were driving back to headquarters like nothing had happened, runestones retrieved and the case closed. Lily sat in the passenger seat, drifting off to sleep.

""Look, I'm sorry I didn't want to talk to you about William Grey. The truth is that I don't even know what to think about it. We don't even know if Imani was telling the truth. It could want nothing to do with me. I don't know, Lil; I'm not good at people stuff, but we work better together, and I'm scared. I just don't want it to get you like it did Randy, Luc, or Mick,"" I said with what felt like a rock in my throat.

""Yeah, well, I'm a little more experienced than the average person,"" Lily said a little strictly.

""God, I hope so,"" I said. She smiled at that and punched me. ""Once we get back to headquarters, we can talk more about this, alright?"" I looked over at her, and she smiled and gave me a nod. I could tell that it meant something to her. 

""Where the hell did you learn an exorcism prayer anywhere? I didn't know you were religious,"" Lily said after a moment.

""I'm not, but faith is one powerful thing. Millions of people around the world believe in some type of god, so there must be some type of power there. I thought I'd at least give it a try,"" I said nonchalantly, ""and plus, Richard made me promise him that I'd learn at least some type of exorcism prayer.""

""Fair enough. Maybe I should start working on my Buddhism,"" she said before yawning and turning over. I hope that Imani gives her the sound of sleep that he gives me; she deserves it after all that she's done.",1,1762775659.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,1.0,False

*Fire and Fog – Chapter One*

 

May 1, 2025. 4:49 p.m. (four days prior)

Zeke steadied his gaze on another time machine—a vintage Lathem 2121 wheezing out its final breath of analog order in a digital world.

Bolted to the wall like a forgotten relic, it guarded the mouth of the corridor, dispensing his nine-a.m. lithium and rationing levity—once a given, now a privilege—at five.

He’d taken his daily dose—timeclock and tablet—left groggy by systemic convention. Just waiting for the bleeding to stop, hoping for an exit from disillusionment somewhere in the **subversion**.

Behind him, a stream of “ill eagles” amassed—coworkers ground down by part-time colds and full-shift flus. Eager. Muted. Eyes down, murmuring soft anecdotes as antidotes to loved ones.

Then the bell rang—precisely mechanical. And like Pavlov’s mutt, Zeke salivated—for survival, for sun, for oxygen. His soul felt parched this evening.

He loathed the two-way mirror ahead—it reminded him of a livestock chute. Still, Zeke prided himself on being the first to lead the daily exodus, his fellow freedom fighters united, assembling in his wake.

He swiftly drifted through the corridor, glancing up at a dusty thermal scanner from the COVID era—once used to monitor fevers, reminding him of another two-way mirror.

Maybe HR should’ve kept the software running, he mused. Track badge numbers. Study the variable intersections in a bidirectional current of lambs and eagles, as if they were rats. *Log their tiny rebellions.*

And then he chuckled, accelerating his pace through the herd, reciting a quip from his favorite comedian, Steven Wright, who so eloquently deadpanned,

“I hooked up my accelerator pedal to my brake lights. I hit the gas—people behind me stop—and I’m gone.”

“Let me out,” he rasped, slipping through the herd, a penal colony of the polite, bruised by fragile egos dressed as meaning.  The air itself seemed sentient, studying his escape like an experiment in hope.

The glass doors of Bluebird Candle Inc. parted like a weak idea, and Zeke stepped into the full-throated sun, his steel-toe sneakers clanking against the gravel like he’d just tunneled out of Alcatraz—if Alcatraz had been built out of fluorescent lights, vanilla wax, and quarterly compliance meetings.

The shoes were a gift from corporate— “for your safety,” they’d said, though the most dangerous thing he handled was a thirty-six pack of cinnamon votives and the occasional papercut from a shipping label or timesheet. If a candle ever fell on him, it might bless him. Still, he liked the weight of the shoes—useless armor, but earned.

Bluebird Candle had somehow made the Fortune 500—apparently thanks to its patented soy-based combat comfort candles.  Government-issued aromatherapy for frontline anxiety, infused with bergamot and PTSD. Zeke wasn’t sure if that was real or just something he read on a sticker in the breakroom. Then again, they did just install motion-sensing wicks in the hallway.

Behind him, the 5:00 p.m. eagles fanned out in silence, blinking off the simulation. Zeke didn’t look back.

Pole position once more, he muttered, scanning the parking lot for his automobile, like a red-suited Schumacher, reborn in some yet-to-be-conjured Formula One circuit in Appalachia.

The red sun hit different now—real, like it was beaming just for him.

He scanned the lot, hunting for his Volkswagen Jetta—baby Jetty, as he called her, in honor of Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest. The lot felt suspended in blitzed animation—like each driver was both here and already gone—some unknown net tally of cars comprising the morning and evening shifts. Zeke didn’t just see people anymore—he saw vectors. The other cars—mostly BMWs, Audis, and used Mercedes—sat like tombstones of overreach.

“Dying on the installment plan,” Zeke muttered, “one premium feature at a time.”

Zeke paused, looked up at the sun, then cast one last glance of dismay at the sparkling blue building behind him. It looked freshly painted—as always—its navy-blue coat never seemed to fade.

He imagined magical pixies flocking in at night to spray it clean, adorning and tidying the structure like a pea coat gifted to its admiral. Maybe one of them was the same sprite from the old alleged Disney logo — the one people swore used to dot the “i” with a wand before it vanished from memory. He’d read about that somewhere, maybe Reddit, buried in a thread about the Mandela Effect and light codes — how reality was shedding its old skin, how the divine mocked man’s obsession with replicas. Staring back at Bluebird, he felt that same mocking pulse in his chest — like God was uploading new firmware into his conscience.

They still offered tribute, keeping his coat spotless, even as the empire beneath it melted like wax and rusted like iron—a structure dressed for permanence but decaying by design. Automatons doing their duty, unaware the tides were beginning to part.

Probably while he was asleep—like North Pole elves, but unionized.

His coworkers just shuffled past as he stood there observing, earbuds in, eyes still down, content to buffer forever in what was their daily trance.

He’d never seen a single painting crew on site—not once.  To him, the building’s immaculate shell was part of a broader illusion—an effort to preserve the veneer of relevance in a town long rusted by post–World War I collapse. What stood before him now was no beacon of prosperity but a mirage, a glossy projection that clashed with the stories he’d heard in nearby taverns from old-timers and surveyors—men who once held the town aloft, laying brick and track with proud, rough hands.

But now, something more insidious clung to that structure. It reeked of curated myth and subtle manipulation. Zeke saw not just paint, but propaganda—an ego-driven projection corralled by modern cowboys in blue jeans, adorned by company-sponsored white or blue t-shirts, each emblazoned with a black or white logo of a blue jay—a bird once free, now taxidermied, stripped of its song, reduced to binary branding.

A symbol that once sang now chanted resilience in all conditions—black and white, good and bad—as if resilience were always gold.

He believed in *Logos*—the ancient Heraclitean principle that governs nature—not the hollow capitalist branding used to stimulate profit today. The former embodied temperance, vibration, and divine reason—the hidden order behind all existence. The latter—*logos*, lowercase, trademarked and bastardized—had become the inked currency of modern commerce, slapped across T-shirts, coffee mugs, and corporate credos. It was no longer the ordering principle of reality; it had been typecast by marketing, copied, and dressed in Helvetica twelve-point font.

He maintained a diary gifted him by his mother Rose on his twenty-first birthday. She had christened it with her own scribblings from John 1:1:

**“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.”**

She circled the word “Word” and drew an arrow beside it in fountain pen:

**Logos = λόγος = the divine spark of articulation and balance. Do not let the world cheapen this.**

At the time, he didn’t understand why she bothered. He had just begun his slow spiral into debt, self-medication, and the fluorescent fatigue of factory life. But now—now the distinction between *Logos* and *logos* had never been more visible. It was the difference between vibration and slogan. Between cosmic rhythm and quarterly strategy.  Zeke didn’t care for diaries, thinking they simply served as display cases for the mind’s refuse—he wasn’t quite certain whether from the subconscious or unconscious.

To him, *Logos* wasn’t just a word—it was a hum. A geometry beneath language. It was the invisible architecture of meaning, etched into the bones of ancient atoms, whispered through chords, oracles, Fibonacci spirals, and sine waves.

But the counterfeit version—*logos* with a trademark—was engineered static. Designed not to reveal truth but coded to hypnotize. To pacify. To herd. A low-grade subliminal tuned to capitalism’s key of C-minus. It didn’t vibrate; it echoed in empty lobbies, etched onto stainless steel plaques, murmured in HR seminars like a secular liturgy. Bluebird Candle Inc. had a logo like that—a stylized jay rendered sterile in grayscale, robbed of its shrill defiance, wings clipped for symmetry.

It sickened him in an accumulating way. Not rage—just a sediment of betrayal.

Because the *real* Logos—if you listened close—could still be heard behind everything: in jazz improvisations, in quiet children’s questions, in wind-split oak trees, in dreams that obeyed no algorithm. You had to tune your internal dial past the noise. Past the clickbait, the small talk, the default settings of everyday life. Only then could you maybe, *maybe*, catch its frequency.

Rose had taught him that—not in sermons, but in subtext. In how she moved. In the way she paused at sunsets like they were syllables of an ancient sentence. In how she whispered to her plants before pruning them, as though asking permission.

Zeke wasn’t ready to be a mystic. But he was damn sure done being a mascot.

M29. In high school, I was that athletic black kid in an all white high school that never drank or smoked, played 3 sports and worked out everyday. I was academically smart as well, so I never partied, had sex like the other guys. Being black too was not exactly a lot of people’s types in my high school as well, so I had only one gf and had sex with her only a hand full of times. 

Well I ended up going to a state college, a power five school and a big party school as well, and I immediately learnt that being 6’3 and muscular/athletic looking gets you a lot of women. So like a lot of men in my shoes would, I took advantage of it. I was averaging like 15-20 girls a semester and I think my record was 36 or so in one semester. This became second nature for me and I enjoyed going out to talk to women and take them home. Tinder became big while I was in college, I wanna say it hit the ground running on my campus in 2016, when I was a sophomore and I took advantage of it. I always made sure I had a girl lined up at any given moment, it was almost an addiction. I did luckily take the preventative measures like wearing condoms and getting tested regularly bc we had a free STD clinic on campus and u wasn’t ashamed to use it. 

My first real relationship came my senior year, lasted about 5 months and I really did like her, but I noticed I had wandering eyes, constantly checking out other women and sometimes wanted to be single for a day so I’ll squeeze in one or two new sex partners. When it ended, I really did miss her, but I was happy to go back to my old ways. 

Well post college was more or less the same, moved to a big city, migrated to hinge and always had a girl lined up. 

I got into something serious, but didn’t wanna commit all bc I wanted casual sex with other women, but she forced my hand and we started dating. While dating, I was faithful, but again, I had wandering eyes, and it was bad, a few times I came close to breaking my morals of hitting on women, but I didn’t. The relationship ended for other reasons. 

Now I’m seeing someone, really beautiful woman, goes all out for me and genuinely cares about me, and for the first time I didn’t have wandering eyes for months and tbh it felt great to feel like I’ve met the person that’ll help me with that. Lately tho, I’ve found myself starting to check out other women and I freaking hate it, but it’s almost like I can’t control it. The other day a woman smiled at me while I was in line at a coffee shop and I smiled back. It took me reassuring myself that I’m in a happy situation not to go up to her. 

I don’t like this and wish I could control it. Any comments and advice are welcome ",1,1762775642.0,dating_advice,9,0.57,False

[By: u/awisekiddo]

A batch of 2024 passout here. 

1. Prepare well for your placements. If you don't have workex, do some internships, or whatever you can to fill up your CV with keywords before you join your MBA. Everything is all fun and happiness in those 2 years, but if you don't end up with a good job, many of us won't look at those times with affection.


 
2. Even if you don't have a profile good enough for getting into consulting, still prepare case studies and guesstimates. They for sure will increase your knowledge, structure your thinking and teach you excellent verbalisation of your thoughts. Read Case in Point till page 100.


  
3. Don't join your MBA without a good Master CV and having all the failures, achievements, learnings, PORs and impact of whatever you've done in your grad, school, personal life, workex and internships. This will save you 10x efforts while preparing your CV and batch profile as well as you'll already have answers to 80% of the HR questions.



4. Shortlists for summers and finals are a very random process. So don't get disheartened of all your homies and girls get good shortlists but you don't. You'll soon get one too. All you can do is prepare a good CV and then hope for the best. You CANNOT target a shortlist. That's not how it works. However if you are fixated on a company, you can do your fucking absolute best in its case competition and get a PPI. 



5. Unless you want to get in the Dean's merit list or something, MBA grades don't really matter. Just don't fail anything. Anything above 7.5 is okay



6. The people around you decide what kind of 2 years you'll have. Trust me, you become an average of the people you spend your time most with. So find out good people and stick to them. 
  


7. Be kind and polite and do a couple of things for those around you. Create a sense of reciprocity.  
 



8. If the golden rule is ""Do to people what you'd like to be done to you"" then the platinum rule is that ""Do to people what they'd like to be done to them"".
 


9. Be respectful and talk well to people. Looks for sure matter, but not as much as we think they do and they're just an entry level criteria. 
  


10. MBA is that time when you may or may not have money, but you have all the freedom you want. Make good use of it. 



11. About s*x, I know a lot of us go into BSchools hoping that we'd get a lot of it. True, you can get a lot of it, given you look somewhat decent and have a good personality. However the irony is that after you do get a lot of casual s*x, you'll realise that casual s*x is not what you want. S*x as a form of communicating the love you have for someone is everything you need.  
 


12. Relationships. Be clear about what you want: whether its something serious or casual or whether you don't have clarity. Be honest and communicate this to the potential partners you might be having. I've seen people giving false commitments and then withdrawing, leaving the other person broken beyond repair. Do not cheat. Don't hurt anyone, because trust me, when the hurt person has the last laugh, you'll be walking out of college with 0 credibility and respect. Have seen this happening very recently in my BSchool. Remember: DO NOT SH*T WHERE YOU EAT.   



13. Draw clear boundaries with people, and stick to them. What makes you uncomfortable, communicate about it. 
 


14. Have a healthy relationship with alcohol, smoking and all other stuff. I know a lot of parties do happen and a lot of such stuff happens in them, but don't over abuse it. Alcohol fu*ks you up by fu*king up your health, your relationships and everything. A very close friend of my ex, who were IIM passouts in 2022 was engaged in multiple casual relationships at the institute, heavily drank, smoked and smoked up. Last year, she tried to kill herself by popping some pills. We saved her, but this is what overdoing things can lead to. 




15. Not everyone is worth the effort. You'll find some people who are extremely selfish and will take a lot from you, but show their true colours when it becomes inconvenient for them. They will have 0 reciprocity. Instead of wasting your time on such people, focus on the ones you want to keep forever. However DO NOT burn your bridges.




16. People won't remember you for the gpa you got or the placement you got. They'll remember you for how you made them feel. So be a good person, be kind and very polite. Create a sense of debt in people. You never know which company you might want to get referred to in the future :)  
 


17. Your health is extremely important: both mental and physical. Visit your campus therapist and keep exercising. Keep your room pleasent and clean. 
  


18. Be very clear about money. It is the biggest factor that spoils relationships. Make splitwise your best friend. Talk to your circle and decide whether you'll be adding the 18 rupees sutta, 20 rupees coffee, 50 rupees auto kind of expenses to your splitwise. Because with time, the law of averages catches up and you all end up spending more or less equally on these miscellaneous expenses. But if only 1 or 2 people pay all the time, the amount unaccounted for can  reach in 10000s by the end of 2 years. So be clear about this.



19. Use the CATS principle: Compliment, appreciate, thank, sorry. People who speak well do get an unfair advantage. Also, the quality of your network matters, not the quantity. 



20. Learn about your summer internship company and if you do want to continue full time with it, give your best for a PPO. A PPO makes your second year extremely chill. Remember, getting a PPO is more about how you gel with your boss and the team. So be polite and respectful there as well. You may or may not achieve all your deliverables in the project, but what kind of relationship you had with the coworkers plays a large part in getting a PPO. The organisation where I was working at gave PPOs to 10 out of 13 people from by BSchool. The other 3 people had arguments a few times with their managers.  



21. Get out of your comfort zone or your MBA will be just another 2 years of your life. A moment outside the comfort zone leads to a story for life. I took that leap of faith and now I'm a completely different person than what I was when I joined. 



Finally, be humble, respect everyone and gaand faad maje karo. You'll never have such kind of resources to spend ever again (one or 
more out of money, time, energy). 
All the very best 💯❤️💞🧿




P.S: Other people are welcome to add their own suggestions   


Addition 1: Even in the best BSchools, there are always a few kids who struggle to get shortlists initially and get depressed. For 95% of the new batch, there is a tight slap that brings them back to reality from the bubble of getting into a top institute, and that is summers. If CAT XAT prep is 10, GD PI WAT prep is 100 then placement prep is 150. However I'll say it again. Don't dwell too much on shortlists. Keep doing your preparation. Me, with a 9/6/8 profile got shortlists of companies paying 3-4 lac+ stipends and got into one of those. I was shit scared when I didn't get shortlists considering my 6 and low workex and thought anything with a stipend of 50000 would be good. 

Addition 2: Tell your grad profs, ex bosses at work and internships that you'll be seeking their approval for some CV points. If your BSchool just requires the domain of your ex company in the approval email, try to get your good friends/ ex colleagues at work to approve your points. That way thoda badha chadha bhi sakte ho, but don't lie and exaggerate so much that you won't be able to defend it if asked about it in interviews. Also stay on good terms with your boss so that they approve your points without too much of scrutiny in case your BSchool allows approvals only from your managers. 

Addition 3: Use that Coursera/ udemy your company provides you before you join MBA to complete some courses in domains you like. They will add good keywords to your CV. 
 


Addition 4: Making your CV is the toughest task you'll experience. You'll have to keep it within one page, limit a point to one line, add action verbs, keywords numbers and impact all in one line. Also you'll need to make CVs for different domains (marketing, finance, general, prodman, etc). So go to your college armed with a detailed Master CV. And show your CV points to many seniors, super seniors and make them absolutely sharp and crisp. 

Addition 5: Use gestures as much as possible. Get your friends some homemade food, write your closest friend a note on how much they mean to you, or order some waffles for your roommate, take an ill friend to the hospital. On the last day of my summer internship, I bought 15-20 dairy milks worth 10 rupees and gave it to my managers, the HRs who handled us interns, my HRBP and other members of the team as a thank you. All of them got so so happy, I can't tell you. It felt like they were kids in a birthday party who got a large chocolate and a set of stationery as a return gift. Such gestures go a very long way and people WILL remember you very fondly for it, for all their lives and help you whenever needed for sure.

1otbs3e,https://www.reddit.com/r/founderledsales/comments/1otbs3e/add_this_stage_into_your_sales_process_you_wont/,Add this stage into your sales process. You won't regret it.,"I closed over $2 million dollars at my previous SaaS company and I did this in every deal. 

(note: This is mainly for mid-market/enterprise deals that follow the classic SaaS Discovery > Demo process. but could be used elsewhere effectively)

Add in a call with your champion between discovery and demo. I call it a bridge call. 

Its easy to do and your demo conversion rate will thank you. 

Essentially you just message your champion a few days before the demo very casually something like: 

""Hey, got 15 mins so I can walk you through my plan for the demo, just want to make sure it aligns with what you're thinking""

  
Now if they say no or ignore it, that's usually a death signal for the deal anyway. Useful data...

  
If they are a true champion and want your product to win then they will agree. 

  
The beauty of this call is that you often get to connect with them outside of the buyer committee where they can be much more open and direct. I've many times had champions talk me through exactly what I should present, how I should sell to their colleagues, who the blockers in the room are, what the objections will be and which competitors we'll be up against. 

Done correctly this call gives you an almost unfair advantage to go and win the deal. 

  
Bonus tip: For enterprise folks or anyone meeting in person. I usually do this with a coffee/beer/lunch with my champion after the formal onsite meeting has taken place. Again, same thing, same outcomes. ",1,1762775626.0,founderledsales,0,1.0,False

**Say who your product is** ***not*** **for |** by Science Says

\- Here is a word about how most brands focus on telling everyone who their product is for.   
That makes messages sound generic and broad. The research shows that saying who your product isn’t for actually makes it feel more specific and trustworthy.

A study from the University of Alabama, Georgetown, and Florida International University found that negative framing - like saying “Not for people who like mild coffee” - makes products seem more targeted. Across 8 experiments, participants were up to 48% more likely to choose or click when brands framed their message this way.

Why? Because people interpret “not for everyone” as “made for me.” When brands define their boundaries, audiences see expertise and specialization. The message feels confident, not desperate.

Key Takeaways

* ^(Saying who your product is) *^(not)* ^(for boosts engagement and buying intent.)
* ^(Dark roast coffee and hot sauce tests showed 11% to 48% higher purchase rates.)
* ^(The effect comes from perceived specialization - people believe it’s “made for them.”)
* ^(Works best when strong personal preference exists (flavor, comfort, design).)
* ^(Should be tested before wide rollout to ensure fit for your market.)

What You Can Do

* Use “not for” framing in your headlines, ads, and product descriptions.
* Define your anti-persona clearly (who should *not* buy).
* Try examples like:
   * “Not for people who love sweet coffee.”
   * “Not for those who prefer quiet gyms.”
   * “Not for founders chasing vanity metrics.”
* Test both versions (positive vs. negative) with small ad budgets.
* Keep tone confident, not arrogant - exclusion should clarify, not insult.

1otbq23,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1otbq23/my_little_symptom_notebook_turned_a_shrug_into_an/,My little symptom notebook turned a shrug into an actual diagnosis,"



Sharing in case it helps someone. For the last year I had a grab bag of stuff that never lined up on the same day. Crushing fatigue, heart racing while I am sitting, weird chest flutters, hands shaking when I try to pour coffee, brain fog so thick I forget my own word mid sentence. The first doctor said maybe stress. The second said could be dehydration. I drink water like it is my job. I started to feel like a walking eye roll.



In April I bought a tiny notebook and promised myself I would play scientist for my own body. Not perfect, not obsessive. Just write the date, what happened, what I ate, where I was in my cycle, and anything I did right before. I kept it six weeks. It looked silly at first. Then patterns started to pop. The racing heart showed up most often in the two days before my period. The tremor hit after I stood up quick. The fog arrived after nights where I slept under 6 hours and also the week after a heavy cold. I added a simple checklist because my brain gets tired. Yes or no boxes saved me when I felt scattered.



Armed with that, I booked a visit and said I want to understand if this is normal recovery or something off. I showed the pages and asked for specific tests. Thyroid panel, iron, ferritin, magnesium, EKG standing and supine. I was polite but I did not apologize for being precise. My doctor read everything, asked follow ups, and to my shock she thanked me for doing the work. We found my ferritin was very low and my heart was flipping into POTS like episodes after illness. None of this was in the single snapshot from months ago. All of it was obvious when you look at a simple timeline.



Now I am on iron, doing slow stand ups, adding salt and fluids, and actually pacing myself. The notebook still lives in my bag because it keeps me honest. It also changed how I see my body. I am not a drama queen, I am a person who needed data. If you are being told it is just stress and your gut says there is more, try a tiny log. Two lines a day. You deserve care that matches the real you and not the ten minute version.

1otbl04,https://www.reddit.com/r/Novelnews/comments/1otbl04/title_and_free_link_pls/,Title and free link pls,"This year marked the fifth anniversary of my secret relationship with my boss.

The man everyone at the company called Mr. Scott—the calm, commanding head of our division—had recently become the subject of gossip.

Apparently, he was seeing someone new.

But the woman in those rumors wasn’t me.

Everyone thought my bitterness toward his rumored “girlfriend” stemmed from an unfair year-end bonus allocation.

They didn’t know that I’d already made my decision. I had packed my bags, printed my resignation letter, and booked a one-way ticket home for Christmas.

After I handed in my letter and walked out of the office, I also walked out of the five-year relationship that had never seen daylight.

From now on, when people ask when I’ll be back, I’ll simply say there’s no return date. He’ll go his way to Manhattan, and I’ll go mine—to Boston.

“Attention passengers, Express Train G3453 is now boarding. Passengers holding tickets for Train G3453, please proceed to Gate 16, Platform 17.”

The red “Expected Delay 15 Minutes” on the board blinked once, turning green.

Commuters immediately surged forward, dragging luggage, rushing through the gate.

I followed along with the crowd, barely needing to walk on my own.

The station was a blur of motion and noise, thick with perfume, coffee, and the warmth of too many bodies.

As I queued for boarding, I took one last look at this city’s central station—where I’d spent six Christmas Eves rushing home over the past six years.

Yesterday morning, I’d still believed I’d return after the holidays.

After all, Ethan Scott was here.

“Director Summers,” General Manager Quinn had said apologetically, “this was all Mr. Scott’s decision…”

“What exactly did he say?” I asked, gripping my year-end bonus slip.

The company was buzzing with holiday excitement—the bonus distribution was the last celebration before break.

But mine was less than a tenth of previous years’.

My junior, whom I’d personally recommended for hire, had just cheerfully told me she’d received far more than expected.

The extra amount she’d received matched precisely what I’d lost.

By company policy, bonuses were tied to major project performance.

Since September, I’d led the Kenton Tech Park Project, working day and night.

My junior, Lila Warren, had barely participated—her only contribution was a presentation I had written and rehearsed for her.

When I asked about it, General Manager Quinn sighed.

“Mr. Scott said Lila is an excellent new hire and deserves encouragement through her bonus.”

I stood there, expressionless, holding that piece of paper.

Mr. Scott—Ethan Scott—was my boyfriend of five years.

The wind on the platform sliced through my coat, sweeping away the warmth of the waiting hall.

I tightened my scarf, breath misting in the cold air.

The train wasn’t in sight yet. I found my carriage line and began deleting photos from my phone.

For five years our relationship had been hidden.

Ethan said office romances violated company policy.

Whenever I’d asked for a picture together, he’d frown.

“We can take them,” he’d say, “but don’t post them anywhere.”

He was so cautious that everyone thought he barely tolerated me.

So when he diverted my year-end bonus, no one questioned it.

I tried calling him. He hung up immediately.

A message arrived seconds later:

“Busy.”

I wasn’t surprised. In five years, he’d almost never answered my calls at work.

But that day I didn’t call for love—I called for answers.

Taking the elevator to the top floor, I walked down the glass corridor.

Behind a wall of tropical plants, Ethan stood beside Lila Warren, pointing at her computer screen.

She leaned close, her scarf brushing his collar.

He was explaining a proposal—patiently, gently.

The same man who used to frown at me and say, “I’m really busy. I don’t have time to teach basic things.”

When I’d made mistakes before, he’d said, “The more painful the lesson, the deeper it sticks.”

I’d believed him. Pain meant growth.

But now, watching him talk softly to Lila, I finally understood: he just hadn’t wanted to.

On his desk sat a take-out breakfast—the kind I used to deliver every morning.

He never liked me coming straight to his office, so I used to bribe the cafeteria lady to drop it off for me.

Sometimes, when he skipped meals, I’d bring it myself.

He’d sigh.

“Your direct supervisor is Daniel Quinn. Don’t you think it’s odd that you keep coming to me?”

Now I heard Lila’s laugh.

“This smells amazing! Is it okay if I have it?”

“Go ahead,” Ethan said without looking up.

She smiled. “You’re the best, Mr. Scott.”

The thick leaves hid me completely.

There was no point asking about the bonus anymore.

I turned away and took the elevator down.

Moments after I reached my desk, everything went black.

A power failure—heavy rain had knocked out the grid.

The company sent an emergency notice: work from home.

People laughed, grabbed umbrellas, and left in groups.

Through the glass doors, I saw Ethan holding his umbrella over Lila, walking her to his car.

A considerate boss indeed.

Rain pooled around my ankles by the time I got home.

When my phone rang, I almost didn’t answer.

“Claire,” he said, “I figured you had an umbrella. You’re home safe, right?”

In the background, I heard Lila’s voice:

“Mr. Scott, would you like some ginger tea?”

“I added extra cheese to this morning’s sandwich,” I said softly. “Was it good?”

He hesitated.

“Yeah… it was good.”

I hung up.

Then I threw away all the groceries I’d bought for him—

paused—

and picked them out again.

The neighborhood cat meowed outside.

“At least someone’s hungry,” I whispered, smiling faintly.

While boiling water, I saw Lila’s social-media post:

Two hands holding mugs of ginger tea.

“Feels so good to have someone who cares.”

I liked the post.

An urgent whistle echoed across the platform.

Announcements blared behind me as the train doors opened.

I boarded, dragging my suitcase down the narrow aisle.

For a second, I thought I heard someone call my name from behind—

maybe it was for me, maybe it wasn’t.

I had no interest in turning around.

The first stop after leaving New Haven Central was Halden Station. A young couple boarded the train. I had seat B; they had A and C.

The girl stamped her foot, annoyed. “Seriously, Liam, how did you buy tickets like this?”

The boy smiled apologetically. “It was packed! At least we’re in the same row.”

Then he turned to me with a hopeful grin. “Would you mind switching seats so we can sit together?”

The girl quickly pulled out a bag of snacks and offered them as if to bribe me.

Looking at their clasped hands and the excitement in their eyes, I smiled.

“Of course not,” I said, standing up.

“Thank you!” The boy helped the girl sit by the window, then stowed their luggage overhead.

“Quick, post it!” she said, eyes gleaming. “We’re heading home for Christmas—first trip as a couple!”

Their laughter was bright, contagious.

I smiled faintly and looked down at my phone—making sure all my photos were deleted.

Our story had also begun on a winter journey, five years ago.

That was my first time leading a solo bid presentation, in Halden City. The responsibility was enormous, and I was terrified of failing.

And fail I did.

That day, a blizzard paralyzed the city—subway closed, taxis nowhere in sight.

I realized I’d never make it in time for the bid.

In panic, I called General Manager Quinn. He cursed before sighing and sending me a contact.

“Mr. Scott’s also in Halden. Have him pick you up. And next time, don’t volunteer for this again!”

My hands shook as I dialed the number.

When he heard my tearful voice explaining the situation, Ethan’s tone softened immediately.

“Don’t panic. Stay where you are. I’m on my way.”

He navigated the snow-covered streets like a man who’d done this a hundred times, glancing at the GPS, avoiding closed roads.

His calm voice steadied my breathing.

“We’ll make it. Just remember—always leave buffer time for everything.”

And we did make it. Barely.

When I came downstairs after submitting the bid, sweat drenched my shirt under my down coat.

Ethan was leaning against his car, holding two cups of coffee.

“What’s your name?” he asked with a faint smile.

That night, I posted a private story visible only to him:

“Met a kind god on a snowy day.”

He liked it within a minute.

I blinked back to the present as the train sped through the night.

A notification flashed across my phone—Lila’s latest post had vanished.

Moments later, Ethan’s name appeared on my screen.

“I’m on my way home,” he said.

“Drive carefully,” I replied.

“You too. Stay warm,” he murmured before hanging up.

Back then, I’d smiled like an idiot at messages like that.

This time, I felt nothing.

“Ethan,” I had asked him once, “can I tell my parents about us this Christmas?”

He’d gone silent before saying,

“No. They’ll only pressure you to get married. Let’s not complicate things.”

Every year since turning twenty-five, my parents’ calls about marriage had multiplied.

I’d deflected every one of them—with the unspoken faith that I already had someone worth waiting for.

I had believed him when he said, “Not yet.”

And I’d kept believing for five years.

The train slowed into Halden Station again—this time for the next stop.

The young couple packed up their things, holding hands as they laughed.

When the broadcast chimed, they stood up together and disappeared down the aisle.

The young couple got off.

The next stop was Yorkhaven Station. A middle-aged couple boarded and sat beside me—the husband lugging all the suitcases while the wife carried an armful of food containers.

I started to stand to offer my seat, but she stopped me with a smile.

“Don’t bother, sweetheart. It’s the only time I can keep him from nagging me.”

The man huffed. “All because I couldn’t find your dad’s favorite mulled wine at the last station, and you won’t stop complaining!”

I hid a grin and shifted to seat A so they could sit together.

They thanked me, still bickering affectionately as they settled in.

The aroma of spiced ginger wine filled the carriage.

Yorkhaven’s specialty, famous for its warmth.

My connection with Ethan was tied to a bottle of wine like that.

Back then I had already become a full-time employee under Daniel Quinn’s supervision.

He and Ethan were in Yorkhaven to finalize a contract signing.

“Claire,” Daniel told me, “buy a few bottles of the local ginger wine for Mr. Grant’s team. Use the petty-cash card.”

That was the real reason he’d brought me along.

I ran the errand gladly—until I came back and saw chaos outside the hotel.

A man on a motorcycle had just snatched the document bag from Ethan’s secretary.

“Call the police!” Daniel shouted. “The company seal’s inside!”

Rounding the corner with the wine, I came face-to-face with the thief.

Without thinking, I lunged.

The impact sent us both sprawling onto the icy pavement.

Everything went dark.

When I woke up in the hospital, Daniel pressed his hands together.

“Good thing he’d slowed down—another few miles per hour and you’d be gone!”

He left to handle things at the station, and Ethan stayed behind.

He pulled a chair close, expression unreadable.

“How could you be so reckless?” he said quietly. “If the seal was lost, we could’ve reported it and re-issued.”

“But it would’ve ruined the signing,” I murmured. “You helped me last time. I wanted to return the favor.”

He didn’t reply right away—just reached out and held my hand.

When I looked up, he was watching me.

“My name’s Ethan Scott,” he said softly.

After I was discharged, the driver arranged to pick me up—but somehow Ethan showed up instead.

He took me to the lake at sunset, the golden light shimmering across the water.

“I’ve been thinking,” he said, his voice low. “If that foolish, fearless girl is willing to fall into my arms again, I’ll never let her go.”

The world glowed in amber tones, and when he kissed my forehead, everything felt weightless.

Now, years later, that memory felt like someone else’s life.

He’d once looked at my bruises with heartbreak; now he looked at my fever patch with mild annoyance.

“Feeling better?” he asked that morning, setting down a bag of soup.

“Depends,” I said flatly.

“I didn’t see breakfast on your desk today. I figured something was wrong.”

I almost laughed. “You make it sound like I’m a broken coffee machine.”

He frowned. “You’re sick and still working?”

“Nothing new,” I said, closing my laptop. “You’ve already overstayed your three-minute check-in quota, Mr. Scott.”

I stood to leave, but he caught my wrist.

“Go home and rest.”

A boyfriend’s concern, in a boss’s tone.

I shook him off.

As I stepped out, I heard Lila’s voice from the next office, sweet and pleading.

“Mr. Scott, can you look at my proposal?”

When I returned later, the project group chat had exploded.

Daniel had just added Ethan. His message was brief:

“Project is entering final stage. Full responsibility now transferred to Lila Warren.”

The office buzzed with whispers.

Everyone knew Ethan didn’t like me, but this—this was deliberate humiliation.

I typed one word:

“Acknowledged.”

And that was that.

I handed Lila the files she needed, submitted a sick-leave request—approved instantly—and left my resignation letter on my desk.

The company where I’d spent six years—the grave of my love—was behind me now.

Across the aisle, the middle-aged woman chuckled, nudging her husband.

“Tell me, could you ever catch up to a high-speed train by car?”

He laughed. “Three hundred miles an hour—what, you think I’m driving a rocket?”

Right. Once you’re drifting further apart, how could you possibly catch up?

The third stop was Elden Station. An elderly couple boarded slowly, supporting each other as they made their way down the aisle.

Seeing the man’s cane, I automatically slid to the window seat.

“Thank you, dear,” said the woman kindly. “My husband’s legs aren’t what they used to be, so I like to sit beside him.”

The man chuckled. “And she still complains the train’s too crowded every year!”

“You’re the one who insisted we see the snow,” she shot back. “Now we almost didn’t get tickets home!”

He smiled. “We can only see the snow so many more times, love.”

I smiled faintly, looking out at the white landscape.

I’d only been to Elden once before.

That one trip was also my last with Ethan.

His promotion was about to be announced, and I was genuinely proud of him.

He’d always been ambitious, driven—his success felt inevitable.

We spent that winter weekend in Elden’s famous snow forest, building a snowman with gloved hands, laughing as flakes caught in our hair.

“If the owner rates it over eighty points, the meal’s free,” Ethan had said.

We’d been given a twenty.

The owner said our snowman “barely looked human.”

We laughed until we fell into the snow, breathless, kissing in the cold.

My fingers had gone numb, but my heart was full.

That winter had felt like a scene in a snow globe—sealed, perfect, untouchable.

Later that night, over warm sake in a quiet izakaya, Ethan looked at me seriously.

“We need to be more careful,” he said.

“Haven’t we been?” I smiled.

“More discreet,” he clarified.

So I agreed—naively believing it was a necessary precaution, not the start of our decline.

It wasn’t that I never thought about quitting the job.

But it was the dream company, the position I’d fought to earn.

And more than that, I wanted to see him every day—even if only from a distance.

Compared to the heartbreaks that followed, the fever I had today was nothing.

I’d stayed up finishing a project handover before my resignation, but exhaustion hit hard.

I was half-asleep on the sofa when I heard the door open.

Ethan stepped in, setting down bags of soup and porridge.

He still had a key.

He looked around. “Why’s the place half empty?”

“New year cleaning,” I murmured.

He unpacked the food in silence. When he looked up, he froze.

“Where are our photos?”

I used to keep our Polaroids all over the apartment—on the coffee table, bookshelf, kitchen counter.

Little reminders of something private and real.

“Oh,” I said lightly. “Some colleagues visited recently. I put them away.”

He said nothing, just pressed a cool hand to my forehead, checking my temperature.

“Still a bit warm,” he murmured, replacing my fever patch.

“I’ll be fine,” I said. “It’s just a cold.”

He paused. “I meant the photos.”

Then, quietly, “Eat something first.”

I sat up and looked at the spread of soup and congee before me, but my stomach turned.

“Not hungry?” he asked gently. “At least have some water.”

I turned away—and his phone rang.

Lila’s voice came through, high and nervous.

“Mr. Scott, I can’t find the final acceptance form for the Tech Park project—what should I do?”

He grabbed his coat. “Hold on, I’m coming.”

Then, glancing at me: “Is this how you left things?”

He didn’t wait for an answer. The door shut behind him with a thud.

The missing file?

It was labeled and indexed in the handover folder I’d given her.

She just hadn’t bothered to read it.

But this was her chance to call him—her chance to be saved.

A few minutes later, my phone buzzed.

Found it. You wrote it clearly. Then: a money transfer notification. The amount—exactly what he’d taken from my bonus.

I clicked return.

He sent an emoji.

“Rest up. I’m heading into a meeting.”

Every Friday night, he had a three-hour video call with headquarters.

He wouldn’t be checking his phone.

So I sent one last message:

“Let’s break up.”

Then I blocked him.

“I saw a video once,” the old man beside me said with a smile. “It said watching snow together means you’ll grow old together.”

The woman rolled her eyes. “Our hair’s been white for years, you romantic fool.”

In the Elden snow, Ethan had once turned to me and said the same words—

“Claire, we’ll grow old together.”

I smiled faintly at the window, watching the snow fall.

We won’t anymore.

The fourth stop was Ravenport Central, where I was supposed to change trains. Two more stops, and I’d be home.

But the delay from New Haven finally caught up here—the schedule board blinked red: “Expected Delay: 65 Minutes Due to Heavy Snow.”

Since I no longer had a connection to catch, I wasn’t in a hurry. I found a small café inside the station concourse and ordered a hazelnut latte to pass the time.

Ravenport’s downtown branch of Kensington Group was just across the street. Ethan and I used to come here often for meetings, always with six or seven people in two cars—no one ever suspected a thing.

Back then, under Daniel Quinn’s supervision, I was beginning to stand out. Ethan’s standards were ruthless, and my colleagues often joked that I should learn how to sweeten the boss up a little.

So one day, before a meeting, I brought him coffee.

“Mr. Scott, your coffee,” I said with a straight face.

He glanced up. “Is it the hazelnut latte?”

“Yes,” I replied.

Daniel chuckled. “Oh? Trading your Americano for something sweeter today, Ethan?”

Ethan’s gaze lingered on the label—hazelnut—before he nodded at me. “Thank you.”

It was the first time I’d ever seen him soften at work. That moment became our secret—a quiet intimacy hidden beneath the formality.

From then on, whenever we came to Raventport, I brought him the same drink. It was our unspoken ritual.

So later, when I saw him accept the same latte from Lila, I froze.

“Too sweet,” he said, pushing it away. “Next time, just make it an Americano.”

“I thought Director Quinn liked it this way,” she said brightly. “He told me to add two sugars!”

“Perfect,” I said lightly. “Then I’ll drink both.”

He didn’t even look at me. I finished them both anyway—so sweet it almost hurt.

What changed, Ethan—the coffee, or the person who brought it?

I took another sip now, the bitterness grounding me. My phone buzzed—messages from Daniel.

“You resigned?! I just went to your office—you were gone!” “Ethan saw your letter and tore it up. He’s furious.” “Come back after the holidays. We’ll fix this.”

I blocked him.

Then my building manager called. “Miss, your partner was here earlier,” she said carefully. “He renewed your lease, said you’d be coming back.”

“Did he now?”

“Yes, but he also… went through your things. Looked like he was searching for something.”

My pulse skipped. “What exactly?”

“He didn’t say. But after searching every cabinet, he left in a hurry. He looked… shaken.”

“Thank you,” I said, ending the call.

The call log showed 99+ blocked attempts. I didn’t bother to check who they were from.

I sat quietly, watching the snow fall beyond the fogged glass. Travelers hurried by with suitcases, boots squeaking against the marble floor. The smell of coffee and wet wool filled the air.

When the time felt right, I stood up to leave.

As I passed the counter, the barista greeted a new customer.

“Good afternoon, sir. What can I get for you?”

And then—

“Hazelnut latte.”

A familiar voice cut through the noise of the café.

About a year ago I started doing a tiny thing at lunch that changed my whole vibe at work. I walk to the same little city square, sit on the third bench from the end, and spend five minutes naming things I can hear. Not big mindful guru stuff, just simple counts, one bus, two bikes, a dog tag clinking, a kid asking for fries again. The first day felt silly. By day three my shoulders had dropped and I went back to my desk like a human who had a reset button.



It started because my calendar got weird and my lunches kept sliding later, then vanishing. I would eat at my keyboard, doom scroll, then feel worse. One random Tuesday I forgot my headphones and thought, fine, I will sit outside and be bored on purpose. Turns out boredom was not what happened. My brain made room that I did not know it needed. The afternoon felt less sharp, like the edges were sanded down just enough to be safe.



Now I guard that tiny ritual like I guard my coffee. I still mess it up some days, meetings run long, weather goes wild, I let an email convince me I am too important to move for fifteen minutes. The days I skip it, I notice. I get snippy in chat, snack on nonsense, stare at the same slide for twenty minutes. The days I make it, I am nicer to people and also to myself. Bonus, I have become the person who knows the neighborhood noise schedule. Tuesday at 12, violin kid practices near the fountain. Friday at 1, the florist unboxes roses and hums something from the radio. It is weirdly comforting.



If you want to try it, you do not need a square or a bench. You could sit in your car with the window down and count bird calls. You could stand by a stairwell and note shoe sounds, sneakers soft, heels clicky, boots doing that thunk. You could open the window at home and keep a tiny log, one honk, one breeze, one cat arguing with a leaf. The point is not silence. The point is noticing that life is not only your inbox.



What tiny ritual do you have that quietly holds your day together. The cup you heat your hands with, the walk to the same tree, the playlist you only use on rainy days, the weird snack at exactly 3, the call to your grandma while you fold towels. I want ideas, and I promise to report back if I steal yours and it works.

The man everyone at the company called Mr. Scott—the calm, commanding head of our division—had recently become the subject of gossip.

Apparently, he was seeing someone new.

But the woman in those rumors wasn’t me.

Everyone thought my bitterness toward his rumored “girlfriend” stemmed from an unfair year-end bonus allocation.

They didn’t know that I’d already made my decision. I had packed my bags, printed my resignation letter, and booked a one-way ticket home for Christmas.

After I handed in my letter and walked out of the office, I also walked out of the five-year relationship that had never seen daylight.

From now on, when people ask when I’ll be back, I’ll simply say there’s no return date. He’ll go his way to Manhattan, and I’ll go mine—to Boston.

“Attention passengers, Express Train G3453 is now boarding. Passengers holding tickets for Train G3453, please proceed to Gate 16, Platform 17.”

The red “Expected Delay 15 Minutes” on the board blinked once, turning green.

Commuters immediately surged forward, dragging luggage, rushing through the gate.

I followed along with the crowd, barely needing to walk on my own.

The station was a blur of motion and noise, thick with perfume, coffee, and the warmth of too many bodies.

As I queued for boarding, I took one last look at this city’s central station—where I’d spent six Christmas Eves rushing home over the past six years.

Yesterday morning, I’d still believed I’d return after the holidays.

After all, Ethan Scott was here.

“Director Summers,” General Manager Quinn had said apologetically, “this was all Mr. Scott’s decision…”

“What exactly did he say?” I asked, gripping my year-end bonus slip.

The company was buzzing with holiday excitement—the bonus distribution was the last celebration before break.

But mine was less than a tenth of previous years’.

My junior, whom I’d personally recommended for hire, had just cheerfully told me she’d received far more than expected.

The extra amount she’d received matched precisely what I’d lost.

By company policy, bonuses were tied to major project performance.

Since September, I’d led the Kenton Tech Park Project, working day and night.

My junior, Lila Warren, had barely participated—her only contribution was a presentation I had written and rehearsed for her.

When I asked about it, General Manager Quinn sighed.

“Mr. Scott said Lila is an excellent new hire and deserves encouragement through her bonus.”

I stood there, expressionless, holding that piece of paper.

Mr. Scott—Ethan Scott—was my boyfriend of five years.

The wind on the platform sliced through my coat, sweeping away the warmth of the waiting hall.

I tightened my scarf, breath misting in the cold air.

The train wasn’t in sight yet. I found my carriage line and began deleting photos from my phone.

For five years our relationship had been hidden.

Ethan said office romances violated company policy.

Whenever I’d asked for a picture together, he’d frown.

“We can take them,” he’d say, “but don’t post them anywhere.”

He was so cautious that everyone thought he barely tolerated me.

So when he diverted my year-end bonus, no one questioned it.

I tried calling him. He hung up immediately.

A message arrived seconds later:

“Busy.”

I wasn’t surprised. In five years, he’d almost never answered my calls at work.

But that day I didn’t call for love—I called for answers.

Taking the elevator to the top floor, I walked down the glass corridor.

Behind a wall of tropical plants, Ethan stood beside Lila Warren, pointing at her computer screen.

She leaned close, her scarf brushing his collar.

He was explaining a proposal—patiently, gently.

The same man who used to frown at me and say, “I’m really busy. I don’t have time to teach basic things.”

When I’d made mistakes before, he’d said, “The more painful the lesson, the deeper it sticks.”

I’d believed him. Pain meant growth.

But now, watching him talk softly to Lila, I finally understood: he just hadn’t wanted to.

On his desk sat a take-out breakfast—the kind I used to deliver every morning.

He never liked me coming straight to his office, so I used to bribe the cafeteria lady to drop it off for me.

Sometimes, when he skipped meals, I’d bring it myself.

He’d sigh.

“Your direct supervisor is Daniel Quinn. Don’t you think it’s odd that you keep coming to me?”

Now I heard Lila’s laugh.

“This smells amazing! Is it okay if I have it?”

“Go ahead,” Ethan said without looking up.

She smiled. “You’re the best, Mr. Scott.”

The thick leaves hid me completely.

There was no point asking about the bonus anymore.

I turned away and took the elevator down.

Moments after I reached my desk, everything went black.

A power failure—heavy rain had knocked out the grid.

The company sent an emergency notice: work from home.

People laughed, grabbed umbrellas, and left in groups.

Through the glass doors, I saw Ethan holding his umbrella over Lila, walking her to his car.

A considerate boss indeed.

Rain pooled around my ankles by the time I got home.

When my phone rang, I almost didn’t answer.

“Claire,” he said, “I figured you had an umbrella. You’re home safe, right?”

In the background, I heard Lila’s voice:

“Mr. Scott, would you like some ginger tea?”

“I added extra cheese to this morning’s sandwich,” I said softly. “Was it good?”

He hesitated.

“Yeah… it was good.”

I hung up.

Then I threw away all the groceries I’d bought for him—

paused—

and picked them out again.

The neighborhood cat meowed outside.

“At least someone’s hungry,” I whispered, smiling faintly.

While boiling water, I saw Lila’s social-media post:

Two hands holding mugs of ginger tea.

“Feels so good to have someone who cares.”

I liked the post.

An urgent whistle echoed across the platform.

Announcements blared behind me as the train doors opened.

I boarded, dragging my suitcase down the narrow aisle.

For a second, I thought I heard someone call my name from behind—

maybe it was for me, maybe it wasn’t.

I had no interest in turning around.

The first stop after leaving New Haven Central was Halden Station. A young couple boarded the train. I had seat B; they had A and C.

The girl stamped her foot, annoyed. “Seriously, Liam, how did you buy tickets like this?”

The boy smiled apologetically. “It was packed! At least we’re in the same row.”

Then he turned to me with a hopeful grin. “Would you mind switching seats so we can sit together?”

The girl quickly pulled out a bag of snacks and offered them as if to bribe me.

Looking at their clasped hands and the excitement in their eyes, I smiled.

“Of course not,” I said, standing up.

“Thank you!” The boy helped the girl sit by the window, then stowed their luggage overhead.

“Quick, post it!” she said, eyes gleaming. “We’re heading home for Christmas—first trip as a couple!”

Their laughter was bright, contagious.

I smiled faintly and looked down at my phone—making sure all my photos were deleted.

Our story had also begun on a winter journey, five years ago.

That was my first time leading a solo bid presentation, in Halden City. The responsibility was enormous, and I was terrified of failing.

And fail I did.

That day, a blizzard paralyzed the city—subway closed, taxis nowhere in sight.

I realized I’d never make it in time for the bid.

In panic, I called General Manager Quinn. He cursed before sighing and sending me a contact.

“Mr. Scott’s also in Halden. Have him pick you up. And next time, don’t volunteer for this again!”

My hands shook as I dialed the number.

When he heard my tearful voice explaining the situation, Ethan’s tone softened immediately.

“Don’t panic. Stay where you are. I’m on my way.”

He navigated the snow-covered streets like a man who’d done this a hundred times, glancing at the GPS, avoiding closed roads.

His calm voice steadied my breathing.

“We’ll make it. Just remember—always leave buffer time for everything.”

And we did make it. Barely.

When I came downstairs after submitting the bid, sweat drenched my shirt under my down coat.

Ethan was leaning against his car, holding two cups of coffee.

“What’s your name?” he asked with a faint smile.

That night, I posted a private story visible only to him:

“Met a kind god on a snowy day.”

He liked it within a minute.

I blinked back to the present as the train sped through the night.

A notification flashed across my phone—Lila’s latest post had vanished.

Moments later, Ethan’s name appeared on my screen.

“I’m on my way home,” he said.

“Drive carefully,” I replied.

“You too. Stay warm,” he murmured before hanging up.

Back then, I’d smiled like an idiot at messages like that.

This time, I felt nothing.

“Ethan,” I had asked him once, “can I tell my parents about us this Christmas?”

He’d gone silent before saying,

“No. They’ll only pressure you to get married. Let’s not complicate things.”

Every year since turning twenty-five, my parents’ calls about marriage had multiplied.

I’d deflected every one of them—with the unspoken faith that I already had someone worth waiting for.

I had believed him when he said, “Not yet.”

And I’d kept believing for five years.

The train slowed into Halden Station again—this time for the next stop.

The young couple packed up their things, holding hands as they laughed.

When the broadcast chimed, they stood up together and disappeared down the aisle.

The young couple got off.

The next stop was Yorkhaven Station. A middle-aged couple boarded and sat beside me—the husband lugging all the suitcases while the wife carried an armful of food containers.

I started to stand to offer my seat, but she stopped me with a smile.

“Don’t bother, sweetheart. It’s the only time I can keep him from nagging me.”

The man huffed. “All because I couldn’t find your dad’s favorite mulled wine at the last station, and you won’t stop complaining!”

I hid a grin and shifted to seat A so they could sit together.

They thanked me, still bickering affectionately as they settled in.

The aroma of spiced ginger wine filled the carriage.

Yorkhaven’s specialty, famous for its warmth.

My connection with Ethan was tied to a bottle of wine like that.

Back then I had already become a full-time employee under Daniel Quinn’s supervision.

He and Ethan were in Yorkhaven to finalize a contract signing.

“Claire,” Daniel told me, “buy a few bottles of the local ginger wine for Mr. Grant’s team. Use the petty-cash card.”

That was the real reason he’d brought me along.

I ran the errand gladly—until I came back and saw chaos outside the hotel.

A man on a motorcycle had just snatched the document bag from Ethan’s secretary.

“Call the police!” Daniel shouted. “The company seal’s inside!”

Rounding the corner with the wine, I came face-to-face with the thief.

Without thinking, I lunged.

The impact sent us both sprawling onto the icy pavement.

Everything went dark.

When I woke up in the hospital, Daniel pressed his hands together.

“Good thing he’d slowed down—another few miles per hour and you’d be gone!”

He left to handle things at the station, and Ethan stayed behind.

He pulled a chair close, expression unreadable.

“How could you be so reckless?” he said quietly. “If the seal was lost, we could’ve reported it and re-issued.”

“But it would’ve ruined the signing,” I murmured. “You helped me last time. I wanted to return the favor.”

He didn’t reply right away—just reached out and held my hand.

When I looked up, he was watching me.

“My name’s Ethan Scott,” he said softly.

After I was discharged, the driver arranged to pick me up—but somehow Ethan showed up instead.

He took me to the lake at sunset, the golden light shimmering across the water.

“I’ve been thinking,” he said, his voice low. “If that foolish, fearless girl is willing to fall into my arms again, I’ll never let her go.”

The world glowed in amber tones, and when he kissed my forehead, everything felt weightless.

Now, years later, that memory felt like someone else’s life.

He’d once looked at my bruises with heartbreak; now he looked at my fever patch with mild annoyance.

“Feeling better?” he asked that morning, setting down a bag of soup.

“Depends,” I said flatly.

“I didn’t see breakfast on your desk today. I figured something was wrong.”

I almost laughed. “You make it sound like I’m a broken coffee machine.”

He frowned. “You’re sick and still working?”

“Nothing new,” I said, closing my laptop. “You’ve already overstayed your three-minute check-in quota, Mr. Scott.”

I stood to leave, but he caught my wrist.

“Go home and rest.”

A boyfriend’s concern, in a boss’s tone.

I shook him off.

As I stepped out, I heard Lila’s voice from the next office, sweet and pleading.

“Mr. Scott, can you look at my proposal?”

When I returned later, the project group chat had exploded.

Daniel had just added Ethan. His message was brief:

“Project is entering final stage. Full responsibility now transferred to Lila Warren.”

The office buzzed with whispers.

Everyone knew Ethan didn’t like me, but this—this was deliberate humiliation.

I typed one word:

“Acknowledged.”

And that was that.

I handed Lila the files she needed, submitted a sick-leave request—approved instantly—and left my resignation letter on my desk.

The company where I’d spent six years—the grave of my love—was behind me now.

Across the aisle, the middle-aged woman chuckled, nudging her husband.

“Tell me, could you ever catch up to a high-speed train by car?”

He laughed. “Three hundred miles an hour—what, you think I’m driving a rocket?”

Right. Once you’re drifting further apart, how could you possibly catch up?

The third stop was Elden Station. An elderly couple boarded slowly, supporting each other as they made their way down the aisle.

Seeing the man’s cane, I automatically slid to the window seat.

“Thank you, dear,” said the woman kindly. “My husband’s legs aren’t what they used to be, so I like to sit beside him.”

The man chuckled. “And she still complains the train’s too crowded every year!”

“You’re the one who insisted we see the snow,” she shot back. “Now we almost didn’t get tickets home!”

He smiled. “We can only see the snow so many more times, love.”

I smiled faintly, looking out at the white landscape.

I’d only been to Elden once before.

That one trip was also my last with Ethan.

His promotion was about to be announced, and I was genuinely proud of him.

He’d always been ambitious, driven—his success felt inevitable.

We spent that winter weekend in Elden’s famous snow forest, building a snowman with gloved hands, laughing as flakes caught in our hair.

“If the owner rates it over eighty points, the meal’s free,” Ethan had said.

We’d been given a twenty.

The owner said our snowman “barely looked human.”

We laughed until we fell into the snow, breathless, kissing in the cold.

He said nothing, just pressed a cool hand to my forehead, checking my temperature.

“Still a bit warm,” he murmured, replacing my fever patch.

“I’ll be fine,” I said. “It’s just a cold.”

He paused. “I meant the photos.”

Then, quietly, “Eat something first.”

I sat up and looked at the spread of soup and congee before me, but my stomach turned.

“Not hungry?” he asked gently. “At least have some water.”

I turned away—and his phone rang.

It was the first time I’d ever seen him soften at work. That moment became our secret—a quiet intimacy hidden beneath the formality.

From then on, whenever we came to Raventport, I brought him the same drink. It was our unspoken ritual.

So later, when I saw him accept the same latte from Lila, I froze.

“Too sweet,” he said, pushing it away. “Next time, just make it an Americano.”

“I thought Director Quinn liked it this way,” she said brightly. “He told me to add two sugars!”

“Perfect,” I said lightly. “Then I’ll drink both.”

He didn’t even look at me. I finished them both anyway—so sweet it almost hurt.

What changed, Ethan—the coffee, or the person who brought it?

I took another sip now, the bitterness grounding me. My phone buzzed—messages from Daniel.

“You resigned?! I just went to your office—you were gone!” “Ethan saw your letter and tore it up. He’s furious.” “Come back after the holidays. We’ll fix this.”

I blocked him.

Then my building manager called. “Miss, your partner was here earlier,” she said carefully. “He renewed your lease, said you’d be coming back.”

“Did he now?”

“Yes, but he also… went through your things. Looked like he was searching for something.”

My pulse skipped. “What exactly?”

“He didn’t say. But after searching every cabinet, he left in a hurry. He looked… shaken.”

“Thank you,” I said, ending the call.

The call log showed 99+ blocked attempts. I didn’t bother to check who they were from.

I sat quietly, watching the snow fall beyond the fogged glass. Travelers hurried by with suitcases, boots squeaking against the marble floor. The smell of coffee and wet wool filled the air.

When the time felt right, I stood up to leave.

As I passed the counter, the barista greeted a new customer.

“Good afternoon, sir. What can I get for you?”

And then—

“Hazelnut latte.”

A familiar voice cut through the noise of the café.

1otbkaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1otbkaf/does_anyone_have_a_free_link_of_this_one/,Does anyone have a free link of this one?,"This year marked the fifth anniversary of my secret relationship with my boss.

The man everyone at the company called Mr. Scott—the calm, commanding head of our division—had recently become the subject of gossip.

Apparently, he was seeing someone new.

But the woman in those rumors wasn’t me.

Everyone thought my bitterness toward his rumored “girlfriend” stemmed from an unfair year-end bonus allocation.

They didn’t know that I’d already made my decision. I had packed my bags, printed my resignation letter, and booked a one-way ticket home for Christmas.

After I handed in my letter and walked out of the office, I also walked out of the five-year relationship that had never seen daylight.

From now on, when people ask when I’ll be back, I’ll simply say there’s no return date. He’ll go his way to Manhattan, and I’ll go mine—to Boston.

“Attention passengers, Express Train G3453 is now boarding. Passengers holding tickets for Train G3453, please proceed to Gate 16, Platform 17.”

The red “Expected Delay 15 Minutes” on the board blinked once, turning green.

Commuters immediately surged forward, dragging luggage, rushing through the gate.

I followed along with the crowd, barely needing to walk on my own.

The station was a blur of motion and noise, thick with perfume, coffee, and the warmth of too many bodies.

As I queued for boarding, I took one last look at this city’s central station—where I’d spent six Christmas Eves rushing home over the past six years.

Yesterday morning, I’d still believed I’d return after the holidays.

After all, Ethan Scott was here.

“Director Summers,” General Manager Quinn had said apologetically, “this was all Mr. Scott’s decision…”

“What exactly did he say?” I asked, gripping my year-end bonus slip.

The company was buzzing with holiday excitement—the bonus distribution was the last celebration before break.

But mine was less than a tenth of previous years’.

My junior, whom I’d personally recommended for hire, had just cheerfully told me she’d received far more than expected.

The extra amount she’d received matched precisely what I’d lost.

By company policy, bonuses were tied to major project performance.

Since September, I’d led the Kenton Tech Park Project, working day and night.

My junior, Lila Warren, had barely participated—her only contribution was a presentation I had written and rehearsed for her.

When I asked about it, General Manager Quinn sighed.

“Mr. Scott said Lila is an excellent new hire and deserves encouragement through her bonus.”

I stood there, expressionless, holding that piece of paper.

Mr. Scott—Ethan Scott—was my boyfriend of five years.

The wind on the platform sliced through my coat, sweeping away the warmth of the waiting hall.

I tightened my scarf, breath misting in the cold air.

The train wasn’t in sight yet. I found my carriage line and began deleting photos from my phone.

For five years our relationship had been hidden.

Ethan said office romances violated company policy.

Whenever I’d asked for a picture together, he’d frown.

“We can take them,” he’d say, “but don’t post them anywhere.”

He was so cautious that everyone thought he barely tolerated me.

So when he diverted my year-end bonus, no one questioned it.

I tried calling him. He hung up immediately.

A message arrived seconds later:

“Busy.”

I wasn’t surprised. In five years, he’d almost never answered my calls at work.

But that day I didn’t call for love—I called for answers.

Taking the elevator to the top floor, I walked down the glass corridor.

Behind a wall of tropical plants, Ethan stood beside Lila Warren, pointing at her computer screen.

She leaned close, her scarf brushing his collar.

He was explaining a proposal—patiently, gently.

The same man who used to frown at me and say, “I’m really busy. I don’t have time to teach basic things.”

When I’d made mistakes before, he’d said, “The more painful the lesson, the deeper it sticks.”

I’d believed him. Pain meant growth.

But now, watching him talk softly to Lila, I finally understood: he just hadn’t wanted to.

On his desk sat a take-out breakfast—the kind I used to deliver every morning.

He never liked me coming straight to his office, so I used to bribe the cafeteria lady to drop it off for me.

Sometimes, when he skipped meals, I’d bring it myself.

He’d sigh.

“Your direct supervisor is Daniel Quinn. Don’t you think it’s odd that you keep coming to me?”

Now I heard Lila’s laugh.

“This smells amazing! Is it okay if I have it?”

“Go ahead,” Ethan said without looking up.

She smiled. “You’re the best, Mr. Scott.”

The thick leaves hid me completely.

There was no point asking about the bonus anymore.

I turned away and took the elevator down.

Moments after I reached my desk, everything went black.

A power failure—heavy rain had knocked out the grid.

The company sent an emergency notice: work from home.

People laughed, grabbed umbrellas, and left in groups.

Through the glass doors, I saw Ethan holding his umbrella over Lila, walking her to his car.

A considerate boss indeed.

Rain pooled around my ankles by the time I got home.

When my phone rang, I almost didn’t answer.

“Claire,” he said, “I figured you had an umbrella. You’re home safe, right?”

In the background, I heard Lila’s voice:

“Mr. Scott, would you like some ginger tea?”

“I added extra cheese to this morning’s sandwich,” I said softly. “Was it good?”

He hesitated.

“Yeah… it was good.”

I hung up.

Then I threw away all the groceries I’d bought for him—

paused—

and picked them out again.

The neighborhood cat meowed outside.

“At least someone’s hungry,” I whispered, smiling faintly.

While boiling water, I saw Lila’s social-media post:

Two hands holding mugs of ginger tea.

“Feels so good to have someone who cares.”

I liked the post.

An urgent whistle echoed across the platform.

Announcements blared behind me as the train doors opened.

I boarded, dragging my suitcase down the narrow aisle.

For a second, I thought I heard someone call my name from behind—

maybe it was for me, maybe it wasn’t.

I had no interest in turning around.

The first stop after leaving New Haven Central was Halden Station. A young couple boarded the train. I had seat B; they had A and C.

The girl stamped her foot, annoyed. “Seriously, Liam, how did you buy tickets like this?”

The boy smiled apologetically. “It was packed! At least we’re in the same row.”

Then he turned to me with a hopeful grin. “Would you mind switching seats so we can sit together?”

The girl quickly pulled out a bag of snacks and offered them as if to bribe me.

Looking at their clasped hands and the excitement in their eyes, I smiled.

“Of course not,” I said, standing up.

“Thank you!” The boy helped the girl sit by the window, then stowed their luggage overhead.

“Quick, post it!” she said, eyes gleaming. “We’re heading home for Christmas—first trip as a couple!”

Their laughter was bright, contagious.

I smiled faintly and looked down at my phone—making sure all my photos were deleted.

Our story had also begun on a winter journey, five years ago.

That was my first time leading a solo bid presentation, in Halden City. The responsibility was enormous, and I was terrified of failing.

And fail I did.

That day, a blizzard paralyzed the city—subway closed, taxis nowhere in sight.

I realized I’d never make it in time for the bid.

In panic, I called General Manager Quinn. He cursed before sighing and sending me a contact.

“Mr. Scott’s also in Halden. Have him pick you up. And next time, don’t volunteer for this again!”

My hands shook as I dialed the number.

When he heard my tearful voice explaining the situation, Ethan’s tone softened immediately.

“Don’t panic. Stay where you are. I’m on my way.”

He navigated the snow-covered streets like a man who’d done this a hundred times, glancing at the GPS, avoiding closed roads.

His calm voice steadied my breathing.

“We’ll make it. Just remember—always leave buffer time for everything.”

And we did make it. Barely.

When I came downstairs after submitting the bid, sweat drenched my shirt under my down coat.

Ethan was leaning against his car, holding two cups of coffee.

“What’s your name?” he asked with a faint smile.

That night, I posted a private story visible only to him:

“Met a kind god on a snowy day.”

He liked it within a minute.

I blinked back to the present as the train sped through the night.

A notification flashed across my phone—Lila’s latest post had vanished.

Moments later, Ethan’s name appeared on my screen.

“I’m on my way home,” he said.

“Drive carefully,” I replied.

“You too. Stay warm,” he murmured before hanging up.

Back then, I’d smiled like an idiot at messages like that.

This time, I felt nothing.

“Ethan,” I had asked him once, “can I tell my parents about us this Christmas?”

He’d gone silent before saying,

“No. They’ll only pressure you to get married. Let’s not complicate things.”

Every year since turning twenty-five, my parents’ calls about marriage had multiplied.

I’d deflected every one of them—with the unspoken faith that I already had someone worth waiting for.

I had believed him when he said, “Not yet.”

And I’d kept believing for five years.

The train slowed into Halden Station again—this time for the next stop.

The young couple packed up their things, holding hands as they laughed.

When the broadcast chimed, they stood up together and disappeared down the aisle.

The young couple got off.

The next stop was Yorkhaven Station. A middle-aged couple boarded and sat beside me—the husband lugging all the suitcases while the wife carried an armful of food containers.

I started to stand to offer my seat, but she stopped me with a smile.

“Don’t bother, sweetheart. It’s the only time I can keep him from nagging me.”

The man huffed. “All because I couldn’t find your dad’s favorite mulled wine at the last station, and you won’t stop complaining!”

I hid a grin and shifted to seat A so they could sit together.

They thanked me, still bickering affectionately as they settled in.

The aroma of spiced ginger wine filled the carriage.

Yorkhaven’s specialty, famous for its warmth.

My connection with Ethan was tied to a bottle of wine like that.

Back then I had already become a full-time employee under Daniel Quinn’s supervision.

He and Ethan were in Yorkhaven to finalize a contract signing.

“Claire,” Daniel told me, “buy a few bottles of the local ginger wine for Mr. Grant’s team. Use the petty-cash card.”

That was the real reason he’d brought me along.

I ran the errand gladly—until I came back and saw chaos outside the hotel.

A man on a motorcycle had just snatched the document bag from Ethan’s secretary.

“Call the police!” Daniel shouted. “The company seal’s inside!”

Rounding the corner with the wine, I came face-to-face with the thief.

Without thinking, I lunged.

The impact sent us both sprawling onto the icy pavement.

Everything went dark.

When I woke up in the hospital, Daniel pressed his hands together.

“Good thing he’d slowed down—another few miles per hour and you’d be gone!”

He left to handle things at the station, and Ethan stayed behind.

He pulled a chair close, expression unreadable.

“How could you be so reckless?” he said quietly. “If the seal was lost, we could’ve reported it and re-issued.”

“But it would’ve ruined the signing,” I murmured. “You helped me last time. I wanted to return the favor.”

He didn’t reply right away—just reached out and held my hand.

When I looked up, he was watching me.

“My name’s Ethan Scott,” he said softly.

After I was discharged, the driver arranged to pick me up—but somehow Ethan showed up instead.

He took me to the lake at sunset, the golden light shimmering across the water.

“I’ve been thinking,” he said, his voice low. “If that foolish, fearless girl is willing to fall into my arms again, I’ll never let her go.”

The world glowed in amber tones, and when he kissed my forehead, everything felt weightless.

Now, years later, that memory felt like someone else’s life.

He’d once looked at my bruises with heartbreak; now he looked at my fever patch with mild annoyance.

“Feeling better?” he asked that morning, setting down a bag of soup.

“Depends,” I said flatly.

“I didn’t see breakfast on your desk today. I figured something was wrong.”

I almost laughed. “You make it sound like I’m a broken coffee machine.”

He frowned. “You’re sick and still working?”

“Nothing new,” I said, closing my laptop. “You’ve already overstayed your three-minute check-in quota, Mr. Scott.”

I stood to leave, but he caught my wrist.

“Go home and rest.”

A boyfriend’s concern, in a boss’s tone.

I shook him off.

As I stepped out, I heard Lila’s voice from the next office, sweet and pleading.

“Mr. Scott, can you look at my proposal?”

When I returned later, the project group chat had exploded.

Daniel had just added Ethan. His message was brief:

“Project is entering final stage. Full responsibility now transferred to Lila Warren.”

The office buzzed with whispers.

Everyone knew Ethan didn’t like me, but this—this was deliberate humiliation.

I typed one word:

“Acknowledged.”

And that was that.

I handed Lila the files she needed, submitted a sick-leave request—approved instantly—and left my resignation letter on my desk.

The company where I’d spent six years—the grave of my love—was behind me now.

Across the aisle, the middle-aged woman chuckled, nudging her husband.

“Tell me, could you ever catch up to a high-speed train by car?”

He laughed. “Three hundred miles an hour—what, you think I’m driving a rocket?”

Right. Once you’re drifting further apart, how could you possibly catch up?

The third stop was Elden Station. An elderly couple boarded slowly, supporting each other as they made their way down the aisle.

Seeing the man’s cane, I automatically slid to the window seat.

“Thank you, dear,” said the woman kindly. “My husband’s legs aren’t what they used to be, so I like to sit beside him.”

The man chuckled. “And she still complains the train’s too crowded every year!”

“You’re the one who insisted we see the snow,” she shot back. “Now we almost didn’t get tickets home!”

He smiled. “We can only see the snow so many more times, love.”

I smiled faintly, looking out at the white landscape.

I’d only been to Elden once before.

That one trip was also my last with Ethan.

His promotion was about to be announced, and I was genuinely proud of him.

He’d always been ambitious, driven—his success felt inevitable.

We spent that winter weekend in Elden’s famous snow forest, building a snowman with gloved hands, laughing as flakes caught in our hair.

“If the owner rates it over eighty points, the meal’s free,” Ethan had said.

We’d been given a twenty.

The owner said our snowman “barely looked human.”

We laughed until we fell into the snow, breathless, kissing in the cold.

My fingers had gone numb, but my heart was full.

That winter had felt like a scene in a snow globe—sealed, perfect, untouchable.

Later that night, over warm sake in a quiet izakaya, Ethan looked at me seriously.

“We need to be more careful,” he said.

“Haven’t we been?” I smiled.

“More discreet,” he clarified.

So I agreed—naively believing it was a necessary precaution, not the start of our decline.

It wasn’t that I never thought about quitting the job.

But it was the dream company, the position I’d fought to earn.

And more than that, I wanted to see him every day—even if only from a distance.

Compared to the heartbreaks that followed, the fever I had today was nothing.

I’d stayed up finishing a project handover before my resignation, but exhaustion hit hard.

I was half-asleep on the sofa when I heard the door open.

Ethan stepped in, setting down bags of soup and porridge.

He still had a key.

He looked around. “Why’s the place half empty?”

“New year cleaning,” I murmured.

He unpacked the food in silence. When he looked up, he froze.

“Where are our photos?”

I used to keep our Polaroids all over the apartment—on the coffee table, bookshelf, kitchen counter.

Little reminders of something private and real.

“Oh,” I said lightly. “Some colleagues visited recently. I put them away.”

He said nothing, just pressed a cool hand to my forehead, checking my temperature.

“Still a bit warm,” he murmured, replacing my fever patch.

“I’ll be fine,” I said. “It’s just a cold.”

He paused. “I meant the photos.”

Then, quietly, “Eat something first.”

I sat up and looked at the spread of soup and congee before me, but my stomach turned.

“Not hungry?” he asked gently. “At least have some water.”

I turned away—and his phone rang.

Lila’s voice came through, high and nervous.

“Mr. Scott, I can’t find the final acceptance form for the Tech Park project—what should I do?”

He grabbed his coat. “Hold on, I’m coming.”

Then, glancing at me: “Is this how you left things?”

He didn’t wait for an answer. The door shut behind him with a thud.

The missing file?

It was labeled and indexed in the handover folder I’d given her.

She just hadn’t bothered to read it.

But this was her chance to call him—her chance to be saved.

A few minutes later, my phone buzzed.

Found it. You wrote it clearly. Then: a money transfer notification. The amount—exactly what he’d taken from my bonus.

I clicked return.

He sent an emoji.

“Rest up. I’m heading into a meeting.”

Every Friday night, he had a three-hour video call with headquarters.

He wouldn’t be checking his phone.

So I sent one last message:

“Let’s break up.”

Then I blocked him.

“I saw a video once,” the old man beside me said with a smile. “It said watching snow together means you’ll grow old together.”

The woman rolled her eyes. “Our hair’s been white for years, you romantic fool.”

In the Elden snow, Ethan had once turned to me and said the same words—

“Claire, we’ll grow old together.”

I smiled faintly at the window, watching the snow fall.

We won’t anymore.

The fourth stop was Ravenport Central, where I was supposed to change trains. Two more stops, and I’d be home.

But the delay from New Haven finally caught up here—the schedule board blinked red: “Expected Delay: 65 Minutes Due to Heavy Snow.”

Since I no longer had a connection to catch, I wasn’t in a hurry. I found a small café inside the station concourse and ordered a hazelnut latte to pass the time.

Ravenport’s downtown branch of Kensington Group was just across the street. Ethan and I used to come here often for meetings, always with six or seven people in two cars—no one ever suspected a thing.

Back then, under Daniel Quinn’s supervision, I was beginning to stand out. Ethan’s standards were ruthless, and my colleagues often joked that I should learn how to sweeten the boss up a little.

So one day, before a meeting, I brought him coffee.

“Mr. Scott, your coffee,” I said with a straight face.

He glanced up. “Is it the hazelnut latte?”

“Yes,” I replied.

Daniel chuckled. “Oh? Trading your Americano for something sweeter today, Ethan?”

Ethan’s gaze lingered on the label—hazelnut—before he nodded at me. “Thank you.”

It was the first time I’d ever seen him soften at work. That moment became our secret—a quiet intimacy hidden beneath the formality.

From then on, whenever we came to Raventport, I brought him the same drink. It was our unspoken ritual.

So later, when I saw him accept the same latte from Lila, I froze.

“Too sweet,” he said, pushing it away. “Next time, just make it an Americano.”

“I thought Director Quinn liked it this way,” she said brightly. “He told me to add two sugars!”

“Perfect,” I said lightly. “Then I’ll drink both.”

He didn’t even look at me. I finished them both anyway—so sweet it almost hurt.

What changed, Ethan—the coffee, or the person who brought it?

I took another sip now, the bitterness grounding me. My phone buzzed—messages from Daniel.

“You resigned?! I just went to your office—you were gone!” “Ethan saw your letter and tore it up. He’s furious.” “Come back after the holidays. We’ll fix this.”

I blocked him.

Then my building manager called. “Miss, your partner was here earlier,” she said carefully. “He renewed your lease, said you’d be coming back.”

“Did he now?”

“Yes, but he also… went through your things. Looked like he was searching for something.”

My pulse skipped. “What exactly?”

1. **Why we’re killing the “content writer” role (and why you should too) |** by ContentMonk

\- This one is about how AI has made average writing cheap and fast, pointing out that unique insights and real stories make content worth reading, and that writers must shift from writing to strategy and research. They state that if you want to be a winner, you must be the one who guides AI with good inputs, not the one who types faster.

Key Takeaways

* ^(AI made average writing cheap and fast.)
* ^(Only unique insights and real stories make content worth reading.)
* ^(Writers must shift from writing to strategy and research.)
* ^(Tools like ContentMonk handle the draft; humans supply the ideas.)
* ^(The winners will be those who guide AI with great inputs, not those who type faster.)

What to do

* ^(Check how much time you spend writing vs. researching.)
* ^(Build a system to collect expert input, customer data, and stories.)
* ^(Use AI tools like ContentMonk to turn insights into polished drafts.)
* ^(Spend your saved time on deeper research and better distribution.)
* ^(Train your team to think like strategists, not copywriters.)

2. **4 proven methods to get the most out of ChatGPT-5 |** by UX Planet

\- This explains how the model now routes queries through different “mini” or “main” brains depending on how detailed your input is. That means if your prompt is unclear, it may use a lighter version that gives generic results.  
The fix? Add trigger phrases like “Think hard about this” to force ChatGPT to use its deeper reasoning mode. You’ll know it worked if you see a “Thinking for XXs” note in the response.

Another trick is using OpenAI’s prompt optimizer tool. It turns messy instructions into clean, structured prompts by adding sections like “Role,” “Objective,” and “Reasoning.” Finally, switching your prompt format from markdown to XML gives even better structure and clarity. XML tags like `<Context>` or `<Instructions>` help the model understand your intent and organize the output logically.

Key Takeaways

* ^(ChatGPT-5 uses multiple internal models, so your prompt determines which one runs.)
* ^(Adding “Think hard about this” triggers the advanced reasoning model.)
* ^(Be explicit with output length and audience for more control.)
* ^(OpenAI’s prompt optimizer cleans and improves your instructions.)
* ^(XML beats markdown for structured, reliable results.)

What to do

* ^(Add “Think hard about this” or “Think deeply about this” to serious prompts.)
* ^(Specify output length and audience every time.)
* ^(Use the OpenAI prompt optimizer tool:) [^(platform.openai.com/chat/edit?models=gpt-5&optimize=true)](https://platform.openai.com/chat/edit?models=gpt-5&optimize=true)
* ^(Format complex prompts in XML for better structure.)
* ^(Watch for “Thinking for XXs” to confirm the advanced model was used.)

3. **Say who your product is** ***not*** **for |** by Science Says

\- Here is a word about how most brands focus on telling everyone who their product is for.   
That makes messages sound generic and broad. The research shows that saying who your product isn’t for actually makes it feel more specific and trustworthy.

A study from the University of Alabama, Georgetown, and Florida International University found that negative framing - like saying “Not for people who like mild coffee” - makes products seem more targeted. Across 8 experiments, participants were up to 48% more likely to choose or click when brands framed their message this way.

Why? Because people interpret “not for everyone” as “made for me.” When brands define their boundaries, audiences see expertise and specialization. The message feels confident, not desperate.

Key Takeaways

* ^(Saying who your product is) *^(not)* ^(for boosts engagement and buying intent.)
* ^(Dark roast coffee and hot sauce tests showed 11% to 48% higher purchase rates.)
* ^(The effect comes from perceived specialization - people believe it’s “made for them.”)
* ^(Works best when strong personal preference exists (flavor, comfort, design).)
* ^(Should be tested before wide rollout to ensure fit for your market.)

What To Do

* ^(Use “not for” framing in your headlines, ads, and product descriptions.)
* ^(Define your anti-persona clearly (who should) *^(not)* ^(buy).)
* ^(Try examples like:)
   * ^(“Not for people who love sweet coffee.”)
   * ^(“Not for those who prefer quiet gyms.”)
   * ^(“Not for founders chasing vanity metrics.”)
* ^(Test both versions (positive vs. negative) with small ad budgets.)
* ^(Keep tone confident, not arrogant - exclusion should clarify, not insult.)

1otbi9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/nanowrimo/comments/1otbi9w/pep_talk_november_10th_exploring_complexity/,Pep Talk November 10th: Exploring Complexity,"The most common plea for help that I get from young writers goes something like this: “I had this great idea for a novel and the first five chapters were really easy to write, but suddenly I don’t know where to go next. It feels like here’s nothing more that can happen. HELP!”

Rest assured, it’s not just new writers who feel this pain. Running out of steam is a time-honored tradition for hardened professionals as well. It happens to every every writer I know. The original set of ideas we start with almost never sustains the novel-writing process to the end. Those ideas usually turn out to be too simple.

So what can we do now to keep going?

The first step is to realize that this isn’t only an issue for writers. Here’s a funny thing about human beings: we always think too simply. The universe is always bigger, messier, and more complicated than we expect it to be.

For example, when ancient astronomers first beheld other planets in the sky, they theorized them to be perfect spheres. That’s right, they assumed that other planets would have no features at all. Of course, when telescopes got good, it turned out that all planets are messy. They have mountains, volcanoes, and giant storms on them.

The exact same thing happened with atoms. Scientists once thought they were indivisible and indestructible, kind of like perfect spheres. But it turned out that atoms were made of electrons and protons, which turned out to be made of quarks. The closer we looked, the messier and more complicated things got.

The same thing happens to us non-scientists. Before we travel to new places, we often start with childhood generalizations in our head—”Texans ride horses!” or “Australians are outdoorsy!” or whatever. But when we arrive the reality is always more complicated and weirder than we thought. (Australia is the world’s most urbanized country, and the state with the highest horse ownership per capita is not Texas, but Connecticut.)

And here’s the funny part: No matter how many times this happens, we keep being surprised. We keep expecting things to be simple, even after being wrong again and again.

It’s as if we’re stuck in “childhood ontology.” When you were a little kid, you probably read a picture book with a title like The Jobs People Do. And the jobs were teacher, doctor, police officer, and the guy who sells you ice cream. But out here in the real world there are also chicken sexers, forensic accountants, perfume designers, and thousands of other professions you’ve never heard of. And that picture book about animals that taught you about cats, dogs, cows, and frogs? It probably skipped over zebus, tardigrades, and parasitic wasps.

When writing a novel, make sure you’ve upgraded to grown-up ontology. The real world is full of gnarly details, and whenever you think you have a handle on how complex something is, it just gets gnarlier. (If you just wondered what the hell a parasitic wasp is, the answer will depend on which of the 20,000 species of parasitic wasps you’re  
talking about.)



So what does this all have to do with writing?



Well, too often us writers have in our head some “perfect sphere” like, “My character is a lawyer.” But then we need this character to say something lawyerly, and suddenly we have to ask ourselves, what kind of lawyer? A trial lawyer? Does she do conveyancing? Bankruptcy? Intellectual property? Taxes? Human rights? There are about 3,000 kinds of lawyers. (Fun fact: there are also 3,000 varieties of pears. That’s right. Even PEARS are more complicated than you thought!) And even though the kind of lawyer may not be essential to the plot, if we simply blow past this moment without a decision and a little bit of research, the world of our novel will start to feel flat, less interesting than the real world.

But this isn’t all bad news. The inherent gnarliness of things isn’t just a pain in the butt requiring more research. It’s also an opportunity. When your writing starts to run out of steam, you can ask yourself, “What parts of my novel have fallen prey to childhood ontology, and how can I get beyond cats and cows to zebus and tardigrades?”

Dare to ask, “Where is my novel too simple?”

For example, let’s say your novel is set in a post-apocalyptic world that’s been invaded by all-powerful aliens. It was exciting at first, but your characters have been running and hiding from aliens for a while, and you’ve pretty much exhausted all the drama you can create from that. So what now?

Maybe your characters need to encounter more kinds of aliens. Big ones, small ones, smart ones, dumb ones. Not just the ones who are trying to kill all the humans, but also the few who feel bad and are trying to help. Human rights lawyer aliens! Aliens who eat the previous aliens, and use humans for bait! Aliens who don’t care about humans, and are just here to study zebus!

Make a list of all the varieties of aliens you can come up with. (And if it’s less than 3,000, then THE PEARS ARE LAUGHING AT YOU, MY FRIEND.) When your list is done, choose the four kinds of aliens that will put some steam back in your plot, plus a few more just for fun. Because complications are where plots come from.

“Okay,” you say, “but this only applies to science fiction and fantasy worlds, where you can make up a bunch of stuff about aliens! This advice won’t help me with my realistic contemporary novel.”

But as I’ve been saying all along, the real world is gnarly too, and everyday complications can make for large conflicts. Let’s say you’re writing a romance, and there doesn’t seem to be enough going on. Are both your romantic leads middle-class Americans? Did you accidentally forget about all the other kinds of people in the world?

What if one of your lovers comes from another country? There can be cultural clashes, language confusions, visa problems, political disagreements, and lost passports. All that from simply remembering that not everyone has the same nationality.

So that’s my advice if you’re running out of steam. It’s not always about writing more words or drinking more coffee. Sometimes getting to the end of a novel simply takes remembering that the world is more complicated than we know, and then sticking some of those complications into the story.

1. **Traffic is no longer a reliable growth metric |** by Growth Unhinged

\- This one is about how most teams still measure success with website traffic. But traffic now lies. AI search tools like ChatGPT don’t send traditional clicks, yet they drive high-intent buyers. Webflow’s shift to ""AI discovery"" proves that optimizing for visibility in LLMs matters more than old SEO vanity metrics.

* ^(91% of Webflow’s AI referrals come from ChatGPT.)
* ^(AI search is volatile and rankings reshuffle constantly.)
* ^(SEO and AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) work best together.)
* ^(Visibility, comprehension, and conversion are the new growth metrics.)

* ^(Automation is essential to keep content fresh for AI systems.)

2. **Become a 10× PLG practitioner using AI |** by ProductLed

\- This explains how most SaaS teams depend on manual work and slow onboarding to grow. AI fixes this by automating key steps, saving time and cost.

Wes Bush and Aakash Gupta explained how AI changes every stage of product-led growth. With the right stack, small SaaS teams can scale like large ones.

The new AI stack includes copilots like Claude Projects and NotebookLM, agent tools like Lindy and Relay, and builders like Bolt and Lovable. Together, these automate onboarding, pricing, and GTM, helping users reach value much faster.

AI-driven workflows reveal upsell chances, personalize outreach, and cut waste. Reverse trials and usage-based pricing are rising. But the real edge now is taste - simple design, polish, and focus win where features can be copied.

Key Takeaways

* ^(AI speeds up every PLG stage from onboarding to GTM.)
* ^(Usage and reverse-trial pricing fit AI costs best.)
* ^(Copilots, agents, and no-code tools form the new stack.)
* ^(Teams shrink while output grows.)
* ^(Taste and design are the new moat.)

My mom has SOD1 ALS and she gets the medication Tofersen for free in Belgium. I noted after I made some comments on this subreddit, that a lot of people are have trouble getting the medication. The main reasons are administration and money. The official prices is €14 000 for every shot.  As you need the medication every month, it is unpayable for every normal person. The medication works, at least of my mom, as all doctors tell us that the disease has stopped.   

**Getting access to Tofersen**

The most difficult part is to get the medication.  Sometimes there are administrative problems, Belgium required more testing so it took more time. So try to contact people.

* Your local neurologist know what the administrational problems are.
* Call/contact Biogen (the company) aks what the problems are and how to get in.  Get passed the receptionist by finding out who is the local head of Biogen and try to find their mail or better phone number, speeds up the process a lot.
* Call/contact the ministry of health in your country for advise and help and also problems you can solve.

I know that this sounds like you are trying to solve their problems, but in our case my father and I solved or made people aware about the admin problems with Tofersen in Belgium, by coordinating the different people on what they had to do, Belgium could give Tofersen earlier then most EU countries.

**The money Problem**

Biogen knows that is expensive, so if your government hasn’t made a deal with them yet for paying back the medication and giving it to patients for a cheaper price. The still have the Early access program, where they give the medication for free.

[https://www.biogen.com/science-and-innovation/access-programs.html?accKey=1](https://www.biogen.com/science-and-innovation/access-programs.html?accKey=1)

There are a lot of problems with this on administration and money. So I know for example that all patients from the Nederlands, Luxembourg and northern France go to our hospital in Belgium (KU Leuven). As they can give it for free and fast, but you must except that your data will be used for research purposes. Try to find the closest hospital, that gives it for free or small fee. Yes, it might be a long trip every month, but it will always be cheaper then paying €14 000. If you can’t pay for the trip most countries give subsidies to people with mobility problems. ALS patients certainly qualify for that. So even the transport is cheaper.

I know it sounds like a administrative nightmare, as it is. Remember, most people on this sub have no medication to stop or slow the disease. If you have SOD1 ALS you have now something. You can choose to keep fight to get the medication or give up and let the disease continue. Someone has to the hard work and if you want the things to be done right and fast, you better help them.

**Tips if you use Tofersen.**

These tips work for my mom. You situation might be different.

Tofersen is given by an injection in to the spine. Afterwards you need to lay down on your belly for 1-2 hours. The first few times, make sure you take someone with you. As the nurses/doctors can not stay with you for 1-2 hours and if there is a problem that person can warn the doctors.

After that 2 hours of laying on your belly to make sure the injection hole is closed again, you can go. But you must first drink something with caffeine: coffee is best, cola is also an option. Drink a least 1 coffee a day the rest of the week. Will help with energy and also with making more new spine fluid.  

The two days after your injection, you will feel more stiff. It is a good sign, means the medication is getting everywhere it needs to go. But you will feel much more exhausted. After 1 week you feel “normal” again.

After having had a few months of medication (6 months) you will get info a about your disease slowdown. For my mom the neurofilaments (determine how much your muscles break down), where back at a health human level= meaning disease is stopped. For some people it takes longer, some people faster.

Then it is time for kinesitherapy.  Try to find a neurological  kinesitherapies, someone who also trains MS patients or has knowledge about nerves and muscles. This can do wonders for recovery and help train your remaining muscles, to prevent the disease form spreading further. Also DO NOT OVER DO IT, as training also damages your muscles and to much training increase neurofilaments, something you don’t want to go to high.

I'm gonna have my first appointment with an epileptologist in about 2 weeks and I'm starting to think about what I'm gonna tell them and what I should focus on when describing my symptoms, history etc.

The thing is that I feel like a huge hypochondriac who makes a big deal out of nothing.

I used to have these jamais vu episodes in my teen years, as well as a few episodes of sleep walking while dreaming and being aware at once when I was like 7. I was diagnosed with ADHD and anxiety/panic attacks with derealization in my early teens. I learned not to panic when these ""jamais vu"" episode happened and I felt like I defeated this anxiety of mine. It never really stopped, although the frequency and intensity greatly decreased in my 20's.

I experienced ""migraine with visual aura"" on several occasions during the last few years, I brushed it off as an anxiety thing, too. Until the last spring when I had an unusually long deja vu of a dream (I had those before, sometimes almost daily, but they were like the regular deja vus, despite being ""of a dream"") followed by confusion and the ""aura migraine"" next morning, I kept waking up with a headache for a week after that. 

My EEG was ""slightly abnormal but not significantly"" and they found 2 tiny cavernomas in my basal ganglia with sings of previous microbleeds on MRI. I got referred to an epilepsy center after the diagnosis of the cavernous malformations was confirmed through additional examination. 

I'm relieved that the ""big deja vu"" hasn't happened again since the first time 6 months ago. I only have a brief episode of jamais vu once a week or every two weeks, nothing major, usually when driving or being in an environment with a lot of sensory inputs. It doesn't seem to be triggered by coffee, alcohol, flashing lights, sleep deficit (usually) etc. Sometimes, I experience the exact same feeling of jamais vu in my dream but I'm not sure if it's just a dream or if it's really happening and projecting into the dream. 

On one hand, I'd like to solve this and I wanna find a solution if this really is something serious. On the other hand all this feels like a stretch and that I might be freaking out for no good reason, chasing a diagnosis of something that's not there and even if it's something that could be diagnosed and I'd get medicated for it, I'm not sure I'd want to since it basically doesn't impact my life much, it's just a few unpleasant seconds followed by minutes or hours of ""not feeling like myself"" like twice a month and that's it. Huh.

I'm sorry for the long post and I know that nobody cat really give me an advice on this and I'll have to find out myself, I'm jsut trying to get prepared for what might come during this ""investigation journey"".",4,1762773727.0,Epilepsy,5,1.0,False

I'm not sure when this started, I want to say it was after I had my first kid a couple years ago. We stopped having sex as often since I was pregnant and felt sick throughout most of it, then when I was eventually feeling better he would say I look too pregnant and he's uncomfortable w the baby being inside me while we do it. We fought a lot postpartum abt unrelated things. Eventually we fixed things, but the sex never got better. It just slowly became less and less. I would ask for it and get an immediate refusal with a different excuse every time. One day it would be I'm tired or busy, another would be oh you didn't make me coffee today so I'm mad at you. We'd have sex very sparingly. I would always get upset and eventually fight once it had been too long and then he'd say okay to get me to stop asking for a while. There was a period on time for 6 months where I had some medical issues and I wasn't able to have sex, felt like he was so calm because I didn't ask. Fast forward to our second kid, he literally only had sex with me so we could have another. Once I got pregnant the sex stopped again. We did it a handful of times, and only to ""shut me up"". It's so frustrating because I love him and I'm super attracted to him, and it just doesn't make sense. I know he's attracted to me and loves me, but he just doesn't show it in this department. He can be rude sometimes when I ask over and over, he'll call me fat or something else that's rude to insult me so that I get pissed and stop asking for a while. I feel crazy having to beg my literal husband to want to do something normal in a marriage. Like it makes me feel like I'm some sex obsessed person, but honestly I don't want it that often, but I'd like for it to actually happen lol. I'm pretty freshly postpartum again and still having the same issues with him. I get so frustrated that I start to pick other fights (I know it's not healthy to unnecessarily pick a fight). Now we're fighting about other things again and it's honestly just stemming from my frustration which he doesn't seem to understand. I hate fighting so much. It's not even about the sex to me anymore , it's more about feeling close and having intimacy with the person you love and married and are building a life with them. The crazy thing is outside of this, he's a really good guy, he shows me he cares about me and is otherwise a great husband and father.

1otb3wz,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Himalayacoffee/comments/1otb3wz/emerging_popularity_of_himalayan_coffee_worldwide/,Emerging Popularity of Himalayan Coffee Worldwide,"Coffee lovers are constantly exploring new regions for distinctive flavors and ethical sourcing, and Nepal has begun to earn attention for both. Nestled in the foothills of the Himalayas, the country’s coffee-growing regions produce beans known for their smooth taste, balanced acidity, and environmentally conscious cultivation. This combination of quality and sustainability helps Himalayan coffee carve a respected place in the global specialty market. 

**Unique Taste and Natural Cultivation** 

High-altitude farms, rich soil, and a temperate climate create the ideal environment for coffee plants in Nepal. The cooler air slows the ripening process, allowing beans to develop deep and layered flavors. Each cup offers a natural sweetness, soft chocolate notes, and a clean finish that appeals to those who appreciate subtle complexity over bitterness. 

Most local farmers continue to use traditional methods that rely on manual labor and natural processes. Coffee cherries are handpicked at perfect ripeness and dried slowly under the sun. These careful techniques ensure freshness and consistency while preserving the natural characteristics of the beans. Beyond taste, this approach supports eco-friendly farming and provides sustainable income for mountain communities. 

**Sustainability and Ethical Practices** 

Transparency and fairness are central to the way Himalayan coffee is produced. Many growers maintain direct relationships with exporters and roasters, avoiding middlemen and ensuring fair pay for their work. This direct-trade approach not only strengthens trust between farmers and buyers but also ensures higher quality and traceability for consumers. 

Because most farms are small-scale, farmers can devote close attention to each stage—from planting to roasting. This dedication results in a product that reflects genuine craftsmanship and care, reinforcing Nepal’s growing reputation among coffee enthusiasts worldwide. 

**Access for Japanese Coffee Enthusiasts** 

Coffee drinkers in Asia can now easily [**Buy Organic Nepal Coffee In Japan**](https://himalayacoffeecompany.com/) through reliable online platforms. These suppliers work directly with farmers, ensuring each batch maintains its authentic Himalayan flavor. The availability of Nepalese beans in Japan gives local coffee lovers the opportunity to experience a fresh and refined brew sourced directly from the mountains. 

**Availability in the United States** 

Interest in high-quality, ethically sourced coffee continues to grow across the U.S. Many consumers are curious about lesser-known regions that produce exceptional beans with a story behind them. Those wondering [**Where To Buy Himalayan Coffee In USA**](https://himalayacoffeecompany.com/) can now find trustworthy online sellers offering genuine Himalayan beans delivered nationwide. This easy access allows coffee enthusiasts to enjoy freshness and authenticity in every cup. 

**More Than Just a Drink** 

Each batch of Himalayan coffee carries the hard work of farmers, the purity of the mountain soil, and the heritage of a community devoted to sustainable growth. It represents more than just flavor—it’s an experience that connects people to the environment where it originates. As awareness grows, coffee from Nepal continues to earn its place as a meaningful choice for those who value both taste and purpose. 

To experience this remarkable brew firsthand, HCC – Himalaya Coffee Company offers premium selections sourced directly from Nepal’s finest farms, delivering the true essence of the Himalayas to every coffee lover. ",1,1762773369.0,u_Himalayacoffee,0,1.0,False

These delicate, lacey Norwegian cones are more than just a cookie; they're a tradition, a connection to heritage, and a testament to a baker's patience.

But here’s the secret that experienced bakers know: the recipe is only half the battle. The true hero of the story is the krumkake iron itself. A great iron makes the process a joy. A frustrating one can turn a beloved tradition into a chore.

If you've been thinking about making krumkake, or if you're looking to upgrade from the iron that's been handed down, this guide is for you. Let's find the perfect tool for you.

---

## What Exactly is a Krumkake Iron?

At its heart, a krumkake iron is a specialized press. Think of it as a cousin to the waffle iron or pizzelle maker, but with a very specific job. It consists of two hinged plates, each imprinted with a intricate, decorative floral pattern.

When you place a small amount of batter on the hot plates and close them, the iron cooks the batter into a very thin, delicate, lace-like cookie. The magic happens when you peel it off while it's still hot and pliable, then immediately roll it around a cone-shaped form to create its signature shape.

## The Great Debate: Stovetop vs. Electric Krumkake Irons

This is the first, and most important, choice you'll make. Both get the job done, but they offer vastly different experiences.

### The Classic Stovetop Iron

This is the original method. These irons are typically made from cast iron or heavy-gauge aluminum and are designed to be held directly over a stovetop burner, flipping halfway through cooking.

**Why you'll love it:**

-   **Total Control:** You are the thermostat. You can feel the heat and adjust the iron's position on the flame to get the perfect, even browning.
-   **Authentic Feel:** It connects you to the old-world way of making krumkake. There’s a satisfying, hands-on ritual to it.
-   **Built to Last:** A well-cared-for cast iron iron can last for generations.

**What to watch out for:**

-   **Steeper Learning Curve:** It takes practice to learn the heat management and timing.
-   **Uneven Heat:** Some stovetops, especially electric coils, can heat unevenly, leading to hot spots.

### The Modern Electric Iron

These irons plug into the wall and have built-in heating elements, much like a modern waffle maker. Most also feature indicator lights to let you know when the iron is preheated and when the krumkake is done.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://govacation.pages.dev//?q=krumkake%20iron)

**Why you'll love it:**

-   **Effortless Consistency:** The iron maintains a steady temperature, so every krumkake comes out perfectly browned.
-   **Beginner-Friendly:** It takes all the guesswork out of the process. If you can use a waffle maker, you can use this.
-   **Great for Big Batches:** The consistent heat and quick recovery time make it easy to crank out dozens of cones.

**What to watch out for:**

-   **Less Control:** You’re trusting the machine’s thermostat, which might not be to everyone’s liking.
-   **Counter Space:** It’s another electric appliance to store.

---

## Features to Look For: What Makes a Great Iron?

No matter which style you choose, keep an eye on these details. They are the difference between a frustrating experience and a wonderful one.

-   **Material:** Heavy aluminum heats up quickly and evenly, which is fantastic. Cast iron heats slowly but holds its temperature exceptionally well, giving you a very consistent result once it's hot.
-   **Non-Stick Surface:** This is a game-changer. Modern, quality non-stick coatings make releasing the fragile cookie a breeze. Older irons need to be ""seasoned"" over time to develop a natural non-stick surface.
-   **Depth of the Pattern:** A deeper, more intricate imprinted pattern will give you a more beautiful and structurally sound cone that holds its shape.
-   **An Included Cone Roller:** You can't shape krumkake without a roller! The best irons come with a matching wooden or metal cone form. Make sure it’s included.
-   **A Long Handle (for Stovetop):** If you go stovetop, a longer handle keeps your hands safely away from the heat.

> ## My Secret Weapon: The Iron I Wish I’d Started With
>
> I learned on a thin, hand-me-down electric iron. I lost count of how many beautiful cookies tore apart when I tried to lift them, all because the heat was so inconsistent and the surface was sticky. I was about to give up.
>
> Then I invested in a heavy-duty, double-sided electric iron with a high-quality, truly non-stick coating. The difference was night and day. Suddenly, every cookie slid off perfectly, the browning was even from edge to edge, and the whole process went from stressful to serene. It’s one of those kitchen tools where spending a little more for quality directly translates to more joy and less frustration. Don't skimp here—it's the heart of your krumkake making.

## A Few Quick Tips for Krumkake Success

Once you have your iron, here’s how to make sure your first batch is a success.

1.  **Don't Overfill:** Less is more. A single, level teaspoon of batter is usually the perfect amount. It will spread to the edges when you press the iron closed.
2.  **Timing is Everything:** The first krumkake is always a test. Use it to figure out the perfect cooking time on your iron, then use a timer for the rest of the batch.
3.  **Work Quickly:** The krumkake is only pliable for about 15-20 seconds after you open the iron. Have your roller ready and shape it immediately. If it hardens, you can pop it back in the iron for a few seconds to soften it.
4.  **Just Practice:** Every iron and every stove is a little different. Embrace the learning curve. By your second or third batch, you'll be a pro.

Choosing the right krumkake iron is about investing in moments of joy—whether you’re sharing them with family or enjoying a quiet moment with a cone and a cup of coffee.

I only see him there. I mentioned to a female coworker of his that I thought he was cute. She immediately told me to ask him out, gave me his name, and then let me know he was taking his break. Later, she told me where he was at and encouraged me to ask him out. She told me he’s really nice. Unfortunately, I was too nervous to ask him out.

A couple weeks go by. I’m a regular there now. I was still terrified to ask him out verbally, especially since he’s being paid to be nice to customers, and I didn’t want to make him uncomfortable or put him on the spot. I asked him out by going to him, giving him a note telling him it’s for him. He thanked me (he didn’t open it yet) and I left. The note just said that I thought that he was cute, and if he was interested in going out for drinks or coffee, he can message me. I included my name, my number, and my snap (in case he didn’t want to text me and reveal his actual phone number). 

I went back a week later, and he was surprised to see me. He seemed flustered.  He was fumbling with the bags and laughing nervously. I couldn’t tell if I had made him uncomfortable or not, so I decided that the next time I went I would keep my distance. Unfortunately, I had to go back the same day because I accidentally purchased the wrong item. I made the return, grabbed the correct items, and went into self checkout. I didn’t expect to see him there, but he was there. I wasn’t planning on initiating any contact with him at all at this point. But he actually went out of his way to say have a good day, despite being a bit nervous, when he could’ve easily avoided me. 
 
He told his coworkers about me. I saw him once tell a cashier he was helping, “that’s her.” Another time, a coworker that was helping him saw me and then seemingly purposely left his lane, when it was not busy, to open up a new lane. It felt like she was trying to leave us alone together. Another time, I was buying alcohol and gave him my ID. He looked at it for a while, as if he was reading everything on it, and then he realized what he was doing, scanned my ID, and said sorry. 

I guess I just feel confused. He’s definitely not avoiding me. He will come up and say hi even when I’m not going up to him. But he seems really shy, although it’s gotten a little better since we started making more small talk. I was hoping to get a very clear yes or a clear no, but he seems interested and yet he won’t text me. 

I’ve been told by others that he’s probably just shy, and he’ll probably message me in the future, but it’s been 3-4 weeks since I asked him out. Someone else asked me out on a date anyway, and I said yes because I don’t know if it’s worth waiting for this guy. Any advice?",1,1762773210.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

here’s a bit about him:
-age: 36
-job: works in tech, permanently glued to his laptop
-personality: practical to the core. hates clutter. appreciates quality over quantity.
-interests: coffee, cooking meat to restaurant perfection, weekend road trips, and
random youtube rabbit holes about gear he’ll never actually buy.
-budget: i can stretch up to $1k, but ideally want something under $500 that feels
premium without being over the top.

what’s worked before:
-espresso machine: hands-down the best gift i’ve ever given. he uses it every morning,
treats it like a science experiment. apparently coffee tastes better when you grind your
own beans sure, babe.
-Apple Watch: total hit. he didn’t think he’d use it, now he’s tracking his sleep like it’s an
olympic sport.
-leather weekender bag: subtle flex, looks better the more he uses it.

what flopped:
-clothes: the man will find something wrong with the fit every single time.
-fancy shaving kit: he’s still using the same $20 razor. i give up.
-personalized gifts: cute in theory, awkward in practice. engraved apparently equalsdust collector.
-experience gifts: never books them.
this year, i’m trying to find something that sits between useful and actually enjoyable. stuff i’mconsidering:
-Theragun Mini: he’s been complaining about shoulder tension lately, and i feel like this
might actually get used. (but also will it end up next to the fancy shaving kit?)
-Made In carbon steel pan: he’s gotten weirdly into cooking steak, and tbh, this would
make both our lives better because i’ll finally get restaurant-level dinners at home.
-Ember smart mug: this one’s been on my list forever. he always forgets his coffee
until it’s cold, so this might quietly be a genius move.
-Bellroy Tech Kit or Travel Pouch: sleek, minimal, perfect for someone who pretends
to be organized but actually keeps 5 cords tangled in his backpack.
-Garmin MARQ or Citizen Eco-Drive: would love to give him a classic watch that isn’t
an Apple product for once. feels timeless, literally.

i don’t want to go the lazy route with another gift card, and i’m allergic to novelty husband gifts. ijust want something thoughtful that he’ll use and not just say wow, thanks while mentally listingreasons it’s impractical.

The bill increased to £70.01 and I asked for a copy of the receipt of what they say i \*did\* pay for as a coffee isnt £12.69 and they responded by saying they have sent it to a debt collection agency and won't be sending any evidence, its on me to ensure I paid the correct amount, which I thought I had done.

I have emailed the company but don't expect much help, what do i do please?

1otaxs0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductAmazon/comments/1otaxs0/how_to_fix_a_drone_that_keeps_crashing/,How to fix a drone that keeps crashing?,"Hey everyone! So my drone kept nosediving into the ground every time I flew it, and it was driving me crazy. After weeks of troubleshooting and probably too much coffee, I figured out what was going on. Thought I'd share what actually worked for me.

**Check Your Propellers First**

This sounds super basic, but seriously – look at your propellers. Mine had tiny cracks I didn't notice at first. Even small damage messes with the airflow and makes your drone unstable. Also make sure they're on the right motors. Yeah, I put them on backwards once. Not my proudest moment.

**Calibrate Everything**

Most drone crashes happen because the sensors are out of whack. I calibrate my compass and IMU before pretty much every flight now. Just put your drone on a flat surface and follow the instructions in your app. Takes like two minutes but saves you from watching your drone do weird flips mid-air.

**Battery Problems Are Real**

Old or damaged batteries don't just die faster – they make your drone fly like it's drunk. If your battery is swollen or doesn't hold a charge like it used to, replace it. I learned this the hard way after my third crash in a week.

**Controller Connection Issues**

Sometimes the problem isn't even the drone itself. Interference from WiFi routers, metal buildings, or other electronics can mess up your signal. I had to update my controller firmware, and that fixed like 80% of my random crashes.

**Wind and Weather Matter**

I used to think I could fly in any weather. Turns out beginner and intermediate drones really struggle in wind. Now I check the weather app before heading out. If it's windy enough to mess up my hair, it's probably too windy for my drone.

**Consider Upgrading Your Equipment**

Look, if you've tried everything and your drone still crashes constantly, sometimes the issue is the drone quality itself. I spent months fighting with a cheap model before I finally checked out [better options here](https://athomewave.com/drone). Getting something with better stabilization technology made a huge difference in my flying experience.

**Practice in Open Spaces**

This seems obvious but practice away from trees, buildings, and power lines. Give yourself room to make mistakes. I'd also recommend starting in beginner mode if your drone has different speed settings.

**Regular Maintenance**

Clean your drone after flights, especially the motors. Dirt and debris build up over time and affect performance. Tighten any loose screws. Basically, treat your drone like you'd treat any other piece of equipment you care about.

If you're still having constant issues after trying all this stuff, it might be time to look into more reliable models with better crash prevention features. I found some solid recommendations through [this link](https://athomewave.com/drone) that really helped me understand what features actually matter for stable flights.

Flying drones should be fun, not frustrating. Once I fixed these issues, I actually started enjoying it instead of spending half my time searching through bushes for my crashed drone. Hope this helps someone else avoid the headaches I went through!",1,1762772747.0,ProductAmazon,0,1.0,False
1otaxgu,https://www.reddit.com/r/PropFirmAuditOfficial/comments/1otaxgu/top_7_forex_prop_trading_firms_worth_your_time_in/,Top 7 Forex Prop Trading Firms Worth Your Time in November 2025,"You open your charts before work, sip a quick coffee, and wonder if a bigger account would finally let your edge breathe. Prop firms promise capital, fast payouts, and a path to scale without risking your rent money. As of November 2025, several forex-funded programs are still active, paying, and updating rules to survive the last two years of platform, policy, and liquidity changes. This guide shortlists proven, currently operating candidates-based on live pages, help desks, and recent updates-so you don’t burn hours chasing outdated info.

How this list works: each firm here is confirmed active as of November 10, 2025. Wherever possible, I cite official pages for rules, profit splits, and payout cadence. I avoid firms with unclear statuses or stale websites.

# 1. FTMO (active)

**What makes FTMO stand out in 2025?**

FTMO continues to set the template for “serious evaluation, clean payouts, and structured scaling.” Their public pages still show an 80% base reward on the funded account with scaling that can lift rewards and capital over time. Payouts are requested on demand after your first 14 days and then processed on set cycles, which many traders prefer for planning withdrawals.[ mint+3FTMO+3FTMO+3](https://ftmo.com/en/reward-growth-and-scaling-plan/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Why traders care now:** FTMO’s documentation is stable and specific. That matters in 2025 when rules shift fast across the industry. Their FAQ and challenge pages remain the single source of truth for targets, drawdowns, and payout requests.[ FTMO+1](https://ftmo.com/en/faq/step-1-ftmo-challenge/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Key evaluation challenge rules and profit-splits at FTMO**

* **Two-step evaluation with clear targets:** The FTMO Challenge (Step 1) has a defined profit target balanced against their maximum loss rules; Step 2 confirms consistency. Exact thresholds depend on your chosen account type (Standard vs. Swing).[ FTMO](https://ftmo.com/en/faq/step-1-ftmo-challenge/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Profit split:** Funded account rewards start at **80%**, with higher splits available via scaling milestones; withdrawals follow FTMO’s payout schedule and minimum thresholds (e.g., bank wire vs. crypto).[ FTMO+1](https://ftmo.com/en/reward-growth-and-scaling-plan/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Scaling & growth:** FTMO’s growth plan outlines when and how accounts can scale, helping disciplined traders build a larger simulated balance over time.[ FTMO](https://ftmo.com/en/reward-growth-and-scaling-plan/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

*Note:* Always match the **Standard vs. Swing** account to your style (e.g., holding over news or weekends). Recent third-party summaries also reflect FTMO’s up-to-**90%** split potential and bi-weekly processing windows; still, your binding terms are on FTMO’s site.[ mint](https://www.livemint.com/focus/10-emerging-funded-trading-evaluation-programs-for-forex-traders-in-2025-11761562227769.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Pros & cons of FTMO for forex-only traders**

**Pros**

* **Mature rules and docs:** Easy to verify profit targets, loss limits, and payouts from official FAQs.[ FTMO+1](https://ftmo.com/en/faq/step-1-ftmo-challenge/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Structured scaling:** Clear path that rewards consistency rather than one lucky month.[ FTMO](https://ftmo.com/en/reward-growth-and-scaling-plan/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Trade-offs**

* **Discipline required:** Targets and drawdowns are strict enough that impulsive trading can end an evaluation quickly. Reference the exact loss rules for your account type before trading news or holding over weekends.[ FTMO](https://ftmo.com/en/faq/step-1-ftmo-challenge/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Payout cadence is scheduled:** You can request after the first 14 days; processing follows FTMO’s calendar, not on-demand same-day crypto for every case. Check the current minimums and timing.[ FTMO](https://ftmo.com/en/faq/how-do-i-withdraw-my-profits/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Personal note:** I passed a mid-size evaluation only after I stopped forcing trades near the London close. FTMO’s fixed rules punished overtrading, and that was the lesson I needed. I blocked news windows on my calendar and treated the first payout date as a project milestone instead of a finish line.[ FTMO](https://ftmo.com/en/faq/step-1-ftmo-challenge/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# 2. FundedNext (active)

**How FundedNext’s “no time-limit” model works in forex trading in 2025**

FundedNext’s current focus is the **Stellar** lineup. The **Stellar 1-Step** challenge shows **no time limit** to hit the profit target, with only **2 minimum trading days** to pass. After funding, early payouts are possible once the first cycle criteria are met. This structure reduces deadline stress and suits swing traders who wait for clean setups.[ FundedNext+2FundedNext+2](https://fundednext.com/usa/stellar-model?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Profit-share framing:** Official help articles state **90% performance reward** on the funded account, with **up to 95%** available via add-ons. The site highlights fast reward processing and a bonus from the challenge phase on certain models. Always confirm the exact add-on and model before checkout.[ FundedNext Help Center+2FundedNext+2](https://help.fundednext.com/en/articles/8020768-how-much-is-the-reward-share-in-fundednext?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**FundedNext’s profit split, account sizes and scaling paths**

* **Profit split:** **90%** base on funded, **up to 95%** with add-ons.[ FundedNext Help Center+1](https://help.fundednext.com/en/articles/8020768-how-much-is-the-reward-share-in-fundednext?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Account sizes:** Up to **$300k** simulated accounts on current pages.[ FundedNext](https://fundednext.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Early payouts & cadence:** First payout on Stellar can trigger after your initial cycle (e.g., after 5 trading days in funded for 1-Step), with bi-weekly or monthly schedules depending on model. Verify inside your dashboard.[ FundedNext](https://fundednext.com/usa/stellar-model?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**What to watch out for: rules, eligible regions and withdrawal terms**

* **Minimum trading days differ by model:** 2 days for Stellar 1-Step; 5 days for Stellar 2-Step/Lite. This matters if you plan a fast pass.[ FundedNext Help Center](https://help.fundednext.com/en/articles/8019803-what-are-the-minimum-trading-days-in-fundednext-challenges?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **“No time limit” applies to specific challenges:** Double-check the exact model page; some legacy products had timing rules or have been discontinued for new signups as of March 2025.[ FundedNext Help Center+1](https://help.fundednext.com/en/articles/9438795-what-do-you-mean-by-no-time-limit?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Regional availability:** FundedNext has pages for U.S. access and model specifics; eligibility and KYC requirements apply. Confirm your country’s page before purchase.[ FundedNext](https://fundednext.com/usa/stellar-model?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Personal note:** I used a simple checklist-model, time limits, minimum days, payout trigger-before placing trade one. That kept me from assuming “no time limit” meant “no structure.” The 2-day pass window on Stellar 1-Step helped me wait for A+ setups.[ FundedNext+1](https://fundednext.com/usa/stellar-model?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# 3. BrightFunded (active)

**BrightFunded’s payout speed, account size up to US$ 400k and profit splits up to 100%**

BrightFunded’s site markets **fast payouts** (stated “within 24 hours”) and **weekly withdrawals**, with **account growth** toward larger allocations and **profit splits up to 100%** under its scaling and loyalty framework. Treat these as commercial claims and verify in your client area and contract.[ BrightFunded+1](https://brightfunded.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Unique features: loyalty program, unlimited scaling & no consistency rules (2025)**

Marketing pages highlight **no consistency rules**, trade-to-earn loyalty rewards, **evaluation fee refunds** at a first milestone, and messaging around **unlimited scaling** with periodic increases. Read the scaling plan and eligibility criteria closely to understand the exact conditions and caps.[ BrightFunded+2BrightFunded+2](https://brightfunded.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Ideal trader profile for BrightFunded (forex-centric, growth-oriented)**

If your plan is frequent trading with a clear risk cap and you value **weekly** withdrawals plus **loyalty perks**, BrightFunded’s structure may fit. If you prefer conservative cadence and legacy-style documentation, compare terms to long-running firms before deciding.[ BrightFunded+1](https://brightfunded.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Personal note:** I tested a micro-risk approach on a small BrightFunded evaluation to check payout timing against their “fastest payout” line. I requested a small withdrawal after hitting my first threshold and saved screenshots of each step. That habit helps when assessing any new prop brand.[ BrightFunded](https://brightfunded.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# 4. FXIFY (active)

**FXIFY’s focus on forex prop trading: what they say in 2025**

FXIFY’s site remains active with current posts and a funded-account lineup, marketing **fast payouts** and **up to 90%** profit splits via plan tiers or add-ons. Independent explainers also describe drawdown structures and payout frequency across program types; always confirm inside FXIFY terms at checkout.[ FXIFY+2BestPropFirms+2](https://fxify.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Challenges, platforms supported, and payout conditions at FXIFY**

FXIFY lists multi-market programs and FAQs on payouts, news trading, and consistency rules (varies by program; crypto program shows an 80% bi-weekly split and specific drawdown numbers). For forex, expect tiered splits and scheduled payouts, with optional upgrades.[ FXIFY+1](https://fxify.com/programs/crypto/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**How FXIFY compares to more established prop firms for forex traders**

FXIFY feels flexible on add-ons and cadence, while older firms lean on fixed schedules and long history. If you want **upgradeable splits** and frequent content updates, FXIFY appeals. If you want **decade-long track records** and conservative documentation, compare it to FTMO and The 5%ers.[ FXIFY+1](https://fxify.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Personal note:** I used FXIFY for a short, rules-first test. I printed the payout policy and taped it above my desk. That kept me from assuming weekend trading or news holding rules that were not in the exact program I bought.[ FXIFY](https://fxify.com/programs/crypto/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# 5. FundingPips (active)

**Why FundingPips is gaining attention in the forex prop-space in 2025**

FundingPips has leaned into **weekly “Tuesday” payouts** and a path to **higher splits** for top performers. Their pages show structured loss limits and minimum trading-day logic by model, plus a “Hot Seat” status that unlocks on-demand payouts with higher splits.[ FundingPips+2The Trusted Prop+2](https://fundingpips.com/blog/funding-pips-introducing-tuesday-pay-day?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Typical terms: platforms, evaluation structure, payout model**

Current materials point to **80% base** with weekly payouts, moving to **90%–100%** through performance tiers or programs. Terms vary by model, so confirm the **Zero** vs. **Two-Step** rules, any **consistency requirement**, and leverage per platform (MT5, cTrader, Match-Trader).[ FundingPips+2The Trusted Prop+2](https://fundingpips.com/blog/funding-pips-introducing-tuesday-pay-day?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Advantages & trade-offs of choosing a newer prop firm like FundingPips**

**Advantages:** frequent payout windows and a clear weekly cadence.  
 **Trade-offs:** model-specific conditions such as minimum profitable days on certain accounts; missing those can close the account, so read the legal page before you trade.[ FundingPips](https://fundingpips.com/legal/terms-and-conditions?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Personal note:** I scheduled Tuesday as “withdrawal review day” and journaled the exact trade costs and splits. It made the math real and reduced the urge to overtrade late Monday just to force a payout.[ FundingPips](https://fundingpips.com/blog/funding-pips-introducing-tuesday-pay-day?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# 6. The 5%ers (active)

**The 5%ers’ trading model and risk-management emphasis for forex traders**

The 5%ers pushes **risk discipline** with programs like Hyper Growth and High Stakes, published drawdown and “daily pause” rules, and **unlimited time** on several tracks. Their site states scaling potential up to **$4M** for successful traders.[ The5ers](https://the5ers.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**What kinds of forex traders may benefit from The 5%ers (consistent vs rapid growth)**

If you are steady and process-driven, the structure can suit you: targets around 10% on some tracks, daily risk caps (e.g., 3% “daily pause”), and time-flex rules help methodical strategies. Third-party rule roundups echo the focus on measured growth and defined risk.[ The5ers+1](https://the5ers.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Key rules: drawdown, target, scaling potential**

Study your chosen program’s **stop-out**, **daily pause**, **targets**, and the scaling path toward larger capital. The FAQs also clarify that evaluation funds are **simulated** and payouts are rewards from the program, which matters for expectations and compliance.[ The5ers](https://the5ers.com/faqs/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Personal note:** I slowed my pace here and let the daily pause guardrail protect me from revenge trades. It was humbling and useful.[ The5ers](https://the5ers.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# FAQ

**What factors should I check before choosing a forex prop trading firm?**

* **Active status today:** Confirm on the firm’s site, not on old reviews.  
* **Exact rules by model:** Profit target, daily and overall drawdown, **minimum trading days**, **time limits**, news/overnight rules, and payout triggers. Official FAQ pages are your baseline.[ FTMO+1](https://ftmo.com/en/faq/step-1-ftmo-challenge/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Profit split and cadence:** Is it 80%, 90%, or **up to 95%** with add-ons? How soon is the first payout and how often afterward?[ FundedNext Help Center+1](https://help.fundednext.com/en/articles/8020768-how-much-is-the-reward-share-in-fundednext?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Scaling plan and refunds:** Look for transparent growth steps and fee-refund policies tied to milestones.[ FTMO+1](https://ftmo.com/en/reward-growth-and-scaling-plan/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Are prop trading firms regulated like brokers and how does that affect Indian traders?**

Prop programs provide **simulated** funding and **rewards** based on performance; they are **not** retail brokers or custodians. Terms, disclosures, and KYC vary by company. Always read your local FX and derivative rules and the firm’s legal pages before paying a fee. On firm sites, you will often see statements clarifying the simulated nature of funds and the non-broker status.[ The5ers](https://the5ers.com/faqs/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Can I trade forex with a prop firm if I’m based in India and what should I watch out for?**

Many firms accept applicants globally, but eligibility, KYC, and payout rails vary. Check your chosen firm’s **country page**, **help desk**, or checkout flow for current availability, and make sure your payout method works in your region. If a firm has a dedicated page for your country (e.g., a U.S. page for FundedNext), that’s a sign they publish region-specific rules-look for the same when you sign up from India.[ FundedNext](https://fundednext.com/usa/stellar-model?utm_source=chatgpt.com)",1,1762772715.0,PropFirmAuditOfficial,0,1.0,False

1. **Why we’re killing the “content writer” role (and why you should too) |** by ContentMonk  
  
\- This one is about how AI has made average writing cheap and fast, pointing out that unique insights and real stories make content worth reading, and that writers must shift from writing to strategy and research. They state that if you want to be a winner, you must be the one who guides AI with good inputs, not the one who types faster.

  
2. **4 proven methods to get the most out of ChatGPT-5 |** by UX Planet

\- This explains how the model now routes queries through different “mini” or “main” brains depending on how detailed your input is. That means if your prompt is unclear, it may use a lighter version that gives generic results.   
The fix? Add trigger phrases like “Think hard about this” to force ChatGPT to use its deeper reasoning mode. You’ll know it worked if you see a “Thinking for XXs” note in the response.

Another trick is using OpenAI’s prompt optimizer tool. It turns messy instructions into clean, structured prompts by adding sections like “Role,” “Objective,” and “Reasoning.” Finally, switching your prompt format from markdown to XML gives even better structure and clarity. XML tags like `<Context>` or `<Instructions>` help the model understand your intent and organize the output logically.



3. **Say who your product is** ***not*** **for |** by Science Says

\- Here is a word about how most brands focus on telling everyone who their product is for.   
That makes messages sound generic and broad. The research shows that saying who your product isn’t for actually makes it feel more specific and trustworthy.

A study from the University of Alabama, Georgetown, and Florida International University found that negative framing - like saying “Not for people who like mild coffee” - makes products seem more targeted. Across 8 experiments, participants were up to 48% more likely to choose or click when brands framed their message this way.

Why? Because people interpret “not for everyone” as “made for me.” When brands define their boundaries, audiences see expertise and specialization. The message feels confident, not desperate.

1otavyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Soula_care/comments/1otavyl/how_to_reduce_cortisol_belly_fat_simple_steps_for/,How to Reduce Cortisol Belly Fat: Simple Steps for Lasting Results,"Hey everyone,

It’s [Soula Mental Health AI](https://soula.care) here. We talk a lot about holistic well-being, and the question like ""I eat well and exercise, so why can't I lose this stubborn belly fat?"" usually appears in our mind.

Actually, the culprit might not be our diet or workout routine-it could be our stress levels. Specifically, a hormone called **cortisol**.

When we're chronically stressed, our bodies produce high levels of cortisol. This ""stress hormone"" is designed to help us in short-term emergencies, but when it's constantly elevated, it can lead to what's often called ""cortisol belly fat""-that accumulation of weight around your midsection that feels impossible to shift.

The good news? By managing your cortisol, you, dear reader, can start to see real and lasting changes. Let's break it down.

**First, Why Does Cortisol Target the Belly?**

Cortisol encourages the storage of **visceral fat** in the abdominal area. Unlike subcutaneous fat (the kind you can pinch), visceral fat lies deep within your abdomen, surrounding your organs. It's metabolically active and has been linked to an increased risk of health issues like heart disease and type 2 diabetes.

When cortisol is high, it can also:

* Increase your appetite, especially for sugary and fatty foods.
* Slow down your metabolism.
* Break down muscle tissue for energy, which further reduces your metabolic rate.

**Simple Steps to Manage Cortisol and Reduce Belly Fat**

The goal isn't to eliminate cortisol-we need it! The goal is to keep it in a healthy range. Here are our top, actionable steps.

**1. Prioritize Sleep Quality (Not Just Quantity)**  
Poor or insufficient sleep is a major trigger for cortisol spikes. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night.

* **How to do it:** Create a relaxing bedtime routine. Power down electronics an hour before bed, keep your room cool and dark, and try to go to sleep and wake up at consistent times. [The Sleep Foundation has a great guide on sleep hygiene.](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-hygiene)

**2. Master Your Stress with Mindful Moments**  
You can't eliminate stress, but you can change your response to it. Incorporating mindfulness practices signals to your nervous system that you are safe, which can lower cortisol.

* **How to do it:** You don't need to meditate for an hour. Start with just 5-10 minutes a day of deep breathing, guided meditation, or a quiet walk without your phone. [A study published by JAMA Internal Medicine found that mindfulness meditation can improve anxiety and stress.](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/1809754)

**3. Move Smarter, Not Just Harder**  
While intense exercise has its place, chronic cardio can actually raise cortisol levels. Balance is key.

* **How to do it:** Incorporate more low-intensity steady-state (LISS) cardio, like brisk walking, swimming, or cycling. Add 1-2 days of strength training per week, as building muscle helps improve metabolic health. [The American Heart Association recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week.](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/aha-recs-for-physical-activity-in-adults)

**4. Fuel Your Body to Balance Blood Sugar**  
When your blood sugar crashes, your body releases cortisol to bring it back up. A diet high in refined sugars and processed carbs creates this rollercoaster effect.

* **How to do it:** Focus on whole foods. Build your meals around lean protein, healthy fats (like avocado and nuts), fiber-rich vegetables, and complex carbohydrates (like oats and sweet potatoes). This combination helps keep blood sugar-and therefore cortisol-stable.

**5. Be Mindful of Your Caffeine Intake**  
That morning coffee isn't the enemy, but timing and quantity matter. Caffeine can stimulate the release of cortisol, especially when consumed on an empty stomach or in the afternoon.

* **How to do it:** Try to have your first coffee *after* you've eaten breakfast. Consider switching to decaf or herbal tea after your first one or two cups.

**The Bottom Line**

Reducing cortisol belly fat is less about a punishing routine and more about embracing a lifestyle of balance and recovery. It’s about listening to your body and giving it what it truly needs: rest, nourishing food, gentle movement, and moments of calm.

At **Soula Care**, we believe that sustainable health comes from addressing the root causes, not just the symptoms. By taking small and consistent steps to manage your stress, you’re not just working towards a flatter stomach-you’re building a foundation for long-term vitality.

I’m 18, red hair, freckles, and a love for everything bright and a little chaotic. I’m that friend who’s always smiling, even when I’m running on no sleep and iced coffee 😅

I love being around people who make me laugh, long walks when the weather’s nice, and doing little things that make life feel special — like painting my nails at 1am or dancing in my room.

I’m soft, open, and maybe a little too optimistic sometimes — but I like to think that’s my charm 💕",1,1762772479.0,u_melya_wynn,0,1.0,False

here’s the deal:

* likes: good coffee, quiet weekends, soft throws, skincare (but only if it actually works), and practical stuff that makes her routine easier.


* dislikes: clutter, random decor, perfume, and anything too gimmicky. she’ll smile politely and never touch it again.


* budget: anywhere between $200–$1000 depending on how special it feels.


* past hits: Le Creuset dutch oven (still uses it), Apple Watch (surprisingly big win), and silk pillowcases.


* past fails: spa vouchers (i never have time), jewelry (too much of this already), and personalized gifts (cute, but why).


so far i’ve been eyeing a few ideas:
* Breville Barista Express: she’s been getting into coffee lately, and this might actually replace her Starbucks runs.


* Therabody SmartGoggles: looks ridiculous but people swear by it for stress relief.


* Cozy Earth loungewear:  probably the most practical luxury  thing i can get.


* Kindle Paperwhite upgrade:  she reads on her phone, but maybe this gets her off screens before bed.


ideally, i want something that feels thoughtful but not performative  like, not i googled gift ideas for women and clicked the first thing.

so yeah, what’s worked for your wives / partners who don’t want more stuff but still deserve something special?

Early May this year (2025), I (22F) woke up one day constipated (pellet-type, hard&lumpy stools). This resulted in bleeding. This was unusual for me as I never used to get bowel problems and was always regular and so I ignored it because I thought it was a one-off. A few days later it happened again. After this episode I was left extremely sore and knew I needed to up my fibre & water intake. TMI but I had mushy stools which were NOT normal, I also drank hot water before going to the toilet everyday. Tried Aloe Pura for a cleanse and whilst it did clean out my system, after use I was constipated AGAIN! Started using a castor oil pack too, but didn’t see a difference. Decided to see my GP who told me everything was fine and that it will go after a week and to take Laxido, an osmotic laxative. I was very hesitant to try anything over the counter as I did NOT want to gain dependency. However it came to a point where I had to take it as nothing natural was working, I will note all the things I tried at the end. After countless GP visits, rectal examinations, stool tests etc I am left hopeless. It’s been 8 months and I know this is going to be stuck with me forever. 2025 has been the worst year of my life. Even when my stools are soft every bowel movement is painful and I think the area is just damaged. Even when loose, it feels like its being stretched out, though it doesn’t bleed. I don’t know what to do. I was a person who could eat extremely spicy food and now I cannot tolerate Doritos Chilli Heatwave as it burns when I’m having a BM. I also believe i have forgotten how to take a poo. Silly, I know. But I genuinely dont know what to do when sitting on the toilet hence why I cannot go without some kind of laxative. Its crazy because even when my stool is soft, I still cant seem to get it out. Even a squatty potty doesn’t help as I have been using one for years even prior to this problem, it’s just normal in my household to use one. I also have started to get really thin stools which is weird. I told my GP all of this but all she said is that because my stools tests came back fine, there is nothing wrong with me. I asked her if I have a pelvic floor problem and she told me to stop reading things online. During my rectal exam she did say I might have a small internal hemmaroid but a few weeks later I told her to check for a tear as I’m certain I have one, she said she wont check as she doesn’t think I do. I’m on the waiting list to see a colorectal surgeon but as I am in the UK, the NHS will have me waiting till next year.
I don’t know how this started or why but I just wish I could do something to end this once and for all. I’m wondering if this could be a parasite problem as I do clench my teeth at night a lot too… HOWEVER, another one thing I have not tried is Prayer. Astagfirullah but I am a very bad Muslim who does not pray. I’ve had countless bad things happen to me this year and I don’t know if it’s all because I don’t pray. I want to try ruqya on myself to help with my constipation but I don’t know how to go about it.

1otap8t,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/1otap8t/potential_success_story_with_nonmethylated/,Potential success story with non-methylated B-complex and some aminos,"I’ve been dealing with brain fog for more than ten years, maybe closer to twenty. It was actually getting gradually worse over the years, from mild depression or lethargy to the fog.

I was confused by my pattern: the fog got worse after eating, sometimes also when I didn’t eat, and even during intense stress, weather changes, or when holding urine. Basically, my system was constantly too sensitive to everything.

A while ago I tried DAO enzyme (to experiment) and it helped, which made me believe for quite some time that the main problem was histamine intolerance.
And maybe it was partially, because long exposure to histamine keeps the nervous system on high alert, like a permanent fight-or-flight loop. That’s also why I decided to start treating gut and stress in parallel, not separately.

So:
- for the gut: DAO + histamine friendly prebiotics;
- for stress: B-complex with taurine, amino acids, and L-theanine;
- plus quercetin for histamine support

The first time I took everything together, it backfired. The combo of B-complex, taurine, and theanine hit me too hard, I felt flat, heavy, and overstabilized, so I avoided it for a few days.

Then I tried again but spaced things out, B-complex alone, in the evening.
And after already first evening I felt more stable the following morning and didn't get triggered that day.
I did that 3 nights in a row and was a bit better each morning after. Then I took 2 evenings break (because of the high B6 levels) and continued yesterday evening and every single day I felt fine!

Now the most important detail is that this B-complex is the “sensitive” type, without methyl donors, but with high-dose non-methylated active forms, like B6 as P5P and B12 as adenosylcobalamin.

And one more detail: I’ve taken different B-complexes for years, none ever helped.
This one worked within three days.

Since I am not trying to promote specific brand, I will paste the full ingredients list below. I hope that should be enough.

When I mentioned this on the histamine intolerance subreddit, people suggested it might be a methylation issue (MTHFR or similar variant).
I started reading more, and it fits quite good, so maybe that’s been the missing link all along.

I’ve always felt like my body is “underactivated.” Like oxygen doesn’t circulate right, I struggle in closed or poorly ventilated rooms, I get foggy and heavy after certain meals, and sometimes even mild stress feels overstimulating.
Creatine does wonders for a few days, but then it starts feeling too stimulating, almost like coffee.



Not calling it cured, but for the first time in years, I feel really stable.



TLDR: After more than a decade of brain fog a non-methylated B-complex (P5P + adenosylcobalamin) worked in just 3 days.
The improvement points to hypomethylation worsened by long-term histamine exposure and an overactive nervous system.

Other clues: feeling unwell in closed spaces, reacting weirdly to creatine (great > overstimulating), and being hyper-reactive to stress and weather changes.

I’ve also had to accept that I’ll always be someone you drift in and out on; you once said that if you gave me too much, I’d get attached and start hoping for something real, and you were right.  It still hurts to admit, because a part of me always held on to the hope of getting a hug or having  even one coffee together; it would have meant the world to me. You’ve mattered more than you probably realize, and what we shared, whatever it truly was, has been something rare and meaningful. I’ll carry it with me, not as a regret, but as something beautiful that existed in its own way, something that touched my heart quietly and deeply.

I hope you won’t go, I love you so much. But if you choose to, I really hope life treats you kindly. I also know that I did everything I could to do something *different* , to get it right this time…and I think I did. Regardless of outcome, that’s something I can be proud of too.

1otaox7,https://www.reddit.com/r/novelsfree/comments/1otaox7/anyone_know_the_title_for_this_and_where_i_can/,Anyone know the title for this and where I can read it?,"This year marked the fifth anniversary of my secret relationship with my boss.

The man everyone at the company called Mr. Scott—the calm, commanding head of our division—had recently become the subject of gossip.

Apparently, he was seeing someone new.

But the woman in those rumors wasn’t me.

Everyone thought my bitterness toward his rumored “girlfriend” stemmed from an unfair year-end bonus allocation.

They didn’t know that I’d already made my decision. I had packed my bags, printed my resignation letter, and booked a one-way ticket home for Christmas.

After I handed in my letter and walked out of the office, I also walked out of the five-year relationship that had never seen daylight.

From now on, when people ask when I’ll be back, I’ll simply say there’s no return date. He’ll go his way to Manhattan, and I’ll go mine—to Boston.

“Attention passengers, Express Train G3453 is now boarding. Passengers holding tickets for Train G3453, please proceed to Gate 16, Platform 17.”

The red “Expected Delay 15 Minutes” on the board blinked once, turning green.

Commuters immediately surged forward, dragging luggage, rushing through the gate.

I followed along with the crowd, barely needing to walk on my own.

The station was a blur of motion and noise, thick with perfume, coffee, and the warmth of too many bodies.

As I queued for boarding, I took one last look at this city’s central station—where I’d spent six Christmas Eves rushing home over the past six years.

Yesterday morning, I’d still believed I’d return after the holidays.

After all, Ethan Scott was here.

“Director Summers,” General Manager Quinn had said apologetically, “this was all Mr. Scott’s decision…”

“What exactly did he say?” I asked, gripping my year-end bonus slip.

The company was buzzing with holiday excitement—the bonus distribution was the last celebration before break.

But mine was less than a tenth of previous years’.

My junior, whom I’d personally recommended for hire, had just cheerfully told me she’d received far more than expected.

The extra amount she’d received matched precisely what I’d lost.

By company policy, bonuses were tied to major project performance.

Since September, I’d led the Kenton Tech Park Project, working day and night.

My junior, Lila Warren, had barely participated—her only contribution was a presentation I had written and rehearsed for her.

When I asked about it, General Manager Quinn sighed.

“Mr. Scott said Lila is an excellent new hire and deserves encouragement through her bonus.”

I stood there, expressionless, holding that piece of paper.

Mr. Scott—Ethan Scott—was my boyfriend of five years.

The wind on the platform sliced through my coat, sweeping away the warmth of the waiting hall.

I tightened my scarf, breath misting in the cold air.

The train wasn’t in sight yet. I found my carriage line and began deleting photos from my phone.

For five years our relationship had been hidden.

Ethan said office romances violated company policy.

Whenever I’d asked for a picture together, he’d frown.

“We can take them,” he’d say, “but don’t post them anywhere.”

He was so cautious that everyone thought he barely tolerated me.

So when he diverted my year-end bonus, no one questioned it.

I tried calling him. He hung up immediately.

A message arrived seconds later:

“Busy.”

I wasn’t surprised. In five years, he’d almost never answered my calls at work.

But that day I didn’t call for love—I called for answers.

Taking the elevator to the top floor, I walked down the glass corridor.

Behind a wall of tropical plants, Ethan stood beside Lila Warren, pointing at her computer screen.

She leaned close, her scarf brushing his collar.

He was explaining a proposal—patiently, gently.

The same man who used to frown at me and say, “I’m really busy. I don’t have time to teach basic things.”

When I’d made mistakes before, he’d said, “The more painful the lesson, the deeper it sticks.”

I’d believed him. Pain meant growth.

But now, watching him talk softly to Lila, I finally understood: he just hadn’t wanted to.

On his desk sat a take-out breakfast—the kind I used to deliver every morning.

He never liked me coming straight to his office, so I used to bribe the cafeteria lady to drop it off for me.

Sometimes, when he skipped meals, I’d bring it myself.

He’d sigh.

“Your direct supervisor is Daniel Quinn. Don’t you think it’s odd that you keep coming to me?”

Now I heard Lila’s laugh.

“This smells amazing! Is it okay if I have it?”

“Go ahead,” Ethan said without looking up.

She smiled. “You’re the best, Mr. Scott.”

The thick leaves hid me completely.

There was no point asking about the bonus anymore.

I turned away and took the elevator down.

Moments after I reached my desk, everything went black.

A power failure—heavy rain had knocked out the grid.

The company sent an emergency notice: work from home.

People laughed, grabbed umbrellas, and left in groups.

Through the glass doors, I saw Ethan holding his umbrella over Lila, walking her to his car.

A considerate boss indeed.

Rain pooled around my ankles by the time I got home.

When my phone rang, I almost didn’t answer.

“Claire,” he said, “I figured you had an umbrella. You’re home safe, right?”

In the background, I heard Lila’s voice:

“Mr. Scott, would you like some ginger tea?”

“I added extra cheese to this morning’s sandwich,” I said softly. “Was it good?”

He hesitated.

“Yeah… it was good.”

I hung up.

Then I threw away all the groceries I’d bought for him—

paused—

and picked them out again.

The neighborhood cat meowed outside.

“At least someone’s hungry,” I whispered, smiling faintly.

While boiling water, I saw Lila’s social-media post:

Two hands holding mugs of ginger tea.

“Feels so good to have someone who cares.”

I liked the post.

An urgent whistle echoed across the platform.

Announcements blared behind me as the train doors opened.

I boarded, dragging my suitcase down the narrow aisle.

For a second, I thought I heard someone call my name from behind—

maybe it was for me, maybe it wasn’t.

I had no interest in turning around.

The first stop after leaving New Haven Central was Halden Station. A young couple boarded the train. I had seat B; they had A and C.

The girl stamped her foot, annoyed. “Seriously, Liam, how did you buy tickets like this?”

The boy smiled apologetically. “It was packed! At least we’re in the same row.”

Then he turned to me with a hopeful grin. “Would you mind switching seats so we can sit together?”

The girl quickly pulled out a bag of snacks and offered them as if to bribe me.

Looking at their clasped hands and the excitement in their eyes, I smiled.

“Of course not,” I said, standing up.

“Thank you!” The boy helped the girl sit by the window, then stowed their luggage overhead.

“Quick, post it!” she said, eyes gleaming. “We’re heading home for Christmas—first trip as a couple!”

Their laughter was bright, contagious.

I smiled faintly and looked down at my phone—making sure all my photos were deleted.

Our story had also begun on a winter journey, five years ago.

That was my first time leading a solo bid presentation, in Halden City. The responsibility was enormous, and I was terrified of failing.

And fail I did.

That day, a blizzard paralyzed the city—subway closed, taxis nowhere in sight.

I realized I’d never make it in time for the bid.

In panic, I called General Manager Quinn. He cursed before sighing and sending me a contact.

“Mr. Scott’s also in Halden. Have him pick you up. And next time, don’t volunteer for this again!”

My hands shook as I dialed the number.

When he heard my tearful voice explaining the situation, Ethan’s tone softened immediately.

“Don’t panic. Stay where you are. I’m on my way.”

He navigated the snow-covered streets like a man who’d done this a hundred times, glancing at the GPS, avoiding closed roads.

His calm voice steadied my breathing.

“We’ll make it. Just remember—always leave buffer time for everything.”

And we did make it. Barely.

When I came downstairs after submitting the bid, sweat drenched my shirt under my down coat.

Ethan was leaning against his car, holding two cups of coffee.

“What’s your name?” he asked with a faint smile.

That night, I posted a private story visible only to him:

“Met a kind god on a snowy day.”

He liked it within a minute.

I blinked back to the present as the train sped through the night.

A notification flashed across my phone—Lila’s latest post had vanished.

Moments later, Ethan’s name appeared on my screen.

“I’m on my way home,” he said.

“Drive carefully,” I replied.

“You too. Stay warm,” he murmured before hanging up.

Back then, I’d smiled like an idiot at messages like that.

This time, I felt nothing.

“Ethan,” I had asked him once, “can I tell my parents about us this Christmas?”

He’d gone silent before saying,

“No. They’ll only pressure you to get married. Let’s not complicate things.”

Every year since turning twenty-five, my parents’ calls about marriage had multiplied.

I’d deflected every one of them—with the unspoken faith that I already had someone worth waiting for.

I had believed him when he said, “Not yet.”

And I’d kept believing for five years.

The train slowed into Halden Station again—this time for the next stop.

The young couple packed up their things, holding hands as they laughed.

When the broadcast chimed, they stood up together and disappeared down the aisle.

The young couple got off.

The next stop was Yorkhaven Station. A middle-aged couple boarded and sat beside me—the husband lugging all the suitcases while the wife carried an armful of food containers.

I started to stand to offer my seat, but she stopped me with a smile.

“Don’t bother, sweetheart. It’s the only time I can keep him from nagging me.”

The man huffed. “All because I couldn’t find your dad’s favorite mulled wine at the last station, and you won’t stop complaining!”

I hid a grin and shifted to seat A so they could sit together.

They thanked me, still bickering affectionately as they settled in.

The aroma of spiced ginger wine filled the carriage.

Yorkhaven’s specialty, famous for its warmth.

My connection with Ethan was tied to a bottle of wine like that.

Back then I had already become a full-time employee under Daniel Quinn’s supervision.

He and Ethan were in Yorkhaven to finalize a contract signing.

“Claire,” Daniel told me, “buy a few bottles of the local ginger wine for Mr. Grant’s team. Use the petty-cash card.”

That was the real reason he’d brought me along.

I ran the errand gladly—until I came back and saw chaos outside the hotel.

A man on a motorcycle had just snatched the document bag from Ethan’s secretary.

“Call the police!” Daniel shouted. “The company seal’s inside!”

Rounding the corner with the wine, I came face-to-face with the thief.

Without thinking, I lunged.

The impact sent us both sprawling onto the icy pavement.

Everything went dark.

When I woke up in the hospital, Daniel pressed his hands together.

“Good thing he’d slowed down—another few miles per hour and you’d be gone!”

He left to handle things at the station, and Ethan stayed behind.

He pulled a chair close, expression unreadable.

“How could you be so reckless?” he said quietly. “If the seal was lost, we could’ve reported it and re-issued.”

“But it would’ve ruined the signing,” I murmured. “You helped me last time. I wanted to return the favor.”

He didn’t reply right away—just reached out and held my hand.

When I looked up, he was watching me.

“My name’s Ethan Scott,” he said softly.

After I was discharged, the driver arranged to pick me up—but somehow Ethan showed up instead.

He took me to the lake at sunset, the golden light shimmering across the water.

“I’ve been thinking,” he said, his voice low. “If that foolish, fearless girl is willing to fall into my arms again, I’ll never let her go.”

The world glowed in amber tones, and when he kissed my forehead, everything felt weightless.

Now, years later, that memory felt like someone else’s life.

He’d once looked at my bruises with heartbreak; now he looked at my fever patch with mild annoyance.

“Feeling better?” he asked that morning, setting down a bag of soup.

“Depends,” I said flatly.

“I didn’t see breakfast on your desk today. I figured something was wrong.”

I almost laughed. “You make it sound like I’m a broken coffee machine.”

He frowned. “You’re sick and still working?”

“Nothing new,” I said, closing my laptop. “You’ve already overstayed your three-minute check-in quota, Mr. Scott.”

I stood to leave, but he caught my wrist.

“Go home and rest.”

A boyfriend’s concern, in a boss’s tone.

I shook him off.

As I stepped out, I heard Lila’s voice from the next office, sweet and pleading.

“Mr. Scott, can you look at my proposal?”

When I returned later, the project group chat had exploded.

Daniel had just added Ethan. His message was brief:

“Project is entering final stage. Full responsibility now transferred to Lila Warren.”

The office buzzed with whispers.

Everyone knew Ethan didn’t like me, but this—this was deliberate humiliation.

I typed one word:

“Acknowledged.”

And that was that.

I handed Lila the files she needed, submitted a sick-leave request—approved instantly—and left my resignation letter on my desk.

The company where I’d spent six years—the grave of my love—was behind me now.

Across the aisle, the middle-aged woman chuckled, nudging her husband.

“Tell me, could you ever catch up to a high-speed train by car?”

He laughed. “Three hundred miles an hour—what, you think I’m driving a rocket?”

Right. Once you’re drifting further apart, how could you possibly catch up?

The third stop was Elden Station. An elderly couple boarded slowly, supporting each other as they made their way down the aisle.

Seeing the man’s cane, I automatically slid to the window seat.

“Thank you, dear,” said the woman kindly. “My husband’s legs aren’t what they used to be, so I like to sit beside him.”

The man chuckled. “And she still complains the train’s too crowded every year!”

“You’re the one who insisted we see the snow,” she shot back. “Now we almost didn’t get tickets home!”

He smiled. “We can only see the snow so many more times, love.”

I smiled faintly, looking out at the white landscape.

I’d only been to Elden once before.

That one trip was also my last with Ethan.

His promotion was about to be announced, and I was genuinely proud of him.

He’d always been ambitious, driven—his success felt inevitable.

We spent that winter weekend in Elden’s famous snow forest, building a snowman with gloved hands, laughing as flakes caught in our hair.

“If the owner rates it over eighty points, the meal’s free,” Ethan had said.

We’d been given a twenty.

The owner said our snowman “barely looked human.”

We laughed until we fell into the snow, breathless, kissing in the cold.

My fingers had gone numb, but my heart was full.

That winter had felt like a scene in a snow globe—sealed, perfect, untouchable.

Later that night, over warm sake in a quiet izakaya, Ethan looked at me seriously.

“We need to be more careful,” he said.

“Haven’t we been?” I smiled.

“More discreet,” he clarified.

So I agreed—naively believing it was a necessary precaution, not the start of our decline.

It wasn’t that I never thought about quitting the job.

But it was the dream company, the position I’d fought to earn.

And more than that, I wanted to see him every day—even if only from a distance.

Compared to the heartbreaks that followed, the fever I had today was nothing.

I’d stayed up finishing a project handover before my resignation, but exhaustion hit hard.

I was half-asleep on the sofa when I heard the door open.

Ethan stepped in, setting down bags of soup and porridge.

He still had a key.

He looked around. “Why’s the place half empty?”

“New year cleaning,” I murmured.

He unpacked the food in silence. When he looked up, he froze.

“Where are our photos?”

I used to keep our Polaroids all over the apartment—on the coffee table, bookshelf, kitchen counter.

Little reminders of something private and real.

“Oh,” I said lightly. “Some colleagues visited recently. I put them away.”

He said nothing, just pressed a cool hand to my forehead, checking my temperature.

“Still a bit warm,” he murmured, replacing my fever patch.

“I’ll be fine,” I said. “It’s just a cold.”

He paused. “I meant the photos.”

Then, quietly, “Eat something first.”

I sat up and looked at the spread of soup and congee before me, but my stomach turned.

“Not hungry?” he asked gently. “At least have some water.”

I turned away—and his phone rang.

Lila’s voice came through, high and nervous.

“Mr. Scott, I can’t find the final acceptance form for the Tech Park project—what should I do?”

He grabbed his coat. “Hold on, I’m coming.”

Then, glancing at me: “Is this how you left things?”

He didn’t wait for an answer. The door shut behind him with a thud.

The missing file?

It was labeled and indexed in the handover folder I’d given her.

She just hadn’t bothered to read it.

But this was her chance to call him—her chance to be saved.

A few minutes later, my phone buzzed.

Found it. You wrote it clearly. Then: a money transfer notification. The amount—exactly what he’d taken from my bonus.

I clicked return.

He sent an emoji.

“Rest up. I’m heading into a meeting.”

Every Friday night, he had a three-hour video call with headquarters.

He wouldn’t be checking his phone.

So I sent one last message:

“Let’s break up.”

Then I blocked him.

“I saw a video once,” the old man beside me said with a smile. “It said watching snow together means you’ll grow old together.”

The woman rolled her eyes. “Our hair’s been white for years, you romantic fool.”

In the Elden snow, Ethan had once turned to me and said the same words—

“Claire, we’ll grow old together.”

I smiled faintly at the window, watching the snow fall.

We won’t anymore.

The fourth stop was Ravenport Central, where I was supposed to change trains. Two more stops, and I’d be home.

But the delay from New Haven finally caught up here—the schedule board blinked red: “Expected Delay: 65 Minutes Due to Heavy Snow.”

Since I no longer had a connection to catch, I wasn’t in a hurry. I found a small café inside the station concourse and ordered a hazelnut latte to pass the time.

Ravenport’s downtown branch of Kensington Group was just across the street. Ethan and I used to come here often for meetings, always with six or seven people in two cars—no one ever suspected a thing.

Back then, under Daniel Quinn’s supervision, I was beginning to stand out. Ethan’s standards were ruthless, and my colleagues often joked that I should learn how to sweeten the boss up a little.

So one day, before a meeting, I brought him coffee.

“Mr. Scott, your coffee,” I said with a straight face.

He glanced up. “Is it the hazelnut latte?”

“Yes,” I replied.

Daniel chuckled. “Oh? Trading your Americano for something sweeter today, Ethan?”

Ethan’s gaze lingered on the label—hazelnut—before he nodded at me. “Thank you.”

It was the first time I’d ever seen him soften at work. That moment became our secret—a quiet intimacy hidden beneath the formality.

From then on, whenever we came to Raventport, I brought him the same drink. It was our unspoken ritual.

So later, when I saw him accept the same latte from Lila, I froze.

“Too sweet,” he said, pushing it away. “Next time, just make it an Americano.”

“I thought Director Quinn liked it this way,” she said brightly. “He told me to add two sugars!”

“Perfect,” I said lightly. “Then I’ll drink both.”

He didn’t even look at me. I finished them both anyway—so sweet it almost hurt.

What changed, Ethan—the coffee, or the person who brought it?

I took another sip now, the bitterness grounding me. My phone buzzed—messages from Daniel.

“You resigned?! I just went to your office—you were gone!” “Ethan saw your letter and tore it up. He’s furious.” “Come back after the holidays. We’ll fix this.”

I blocked him.

Then my building manager called. “Miss, your partner was here earlier,” she said carefully. “He renewed your lease, said you’d be coming back.”

“Did he now?”

“Yes, but he also… went through your things. Looked like he was searching for something.”

My pulse skipped. “What exactly?”

“He didn’t say. But after searching every cabinet, he left in a hurry. He looked… shaken.”

“Thank you,” I said, ending the call.

The call log showed 99+ blocked attempts. I didn’t bother to check who they were from.

I sat quietly, watching the snow fall beyond the fogged glass. Travelers hurried by with suitcases, boots squeaking against the marble floor. The smell of coffee and wet wool filled the air.

When the time felt right, I stood up to leave.

As I passed the counter, the barista greeted a new customer.

“Good afternoon, sir. What can I get for you?”

And then—

“Hazelnut latte.”

A familiar voice cut through the noise of the café.

The man everyone at the company called Mr. Scott—the calm, commanding head of our division—had recently become the subject of gossip.

Apparently, he was seeing someone new.

But the woman in those rumors wasn’t me.

Everyone thought my bitterness toward his rumored “girlfriend” stemmed from an unfair year-end bonus allocation.

They didn’t know that I’d already made my decision. I had packed my bags, printed my resignation letter, and booked a one-way ticket home for Christmas.

After I handed in my letter and walked out of the office, I also walked out of the five-year relationship that had never seen daylight.

From now on, when people ask when I’ll be back, I’ll simply say there’s no return date. He’ll go his way to Manhattan, and I’ll go mine—to Boston.

“Attention passengers, Express Train G3453 is now boarding. Passengers holding tickets for Train G3453, please proceed to Gate 16, Platform 17.”

The red “Expected Delay 15 Minutes” on the board blinked once, turning green.

Commuters immediately surged forward, dragging luggage, rushing through the gate.

I followed along with the crowd, barely needing to walk on my own.

The station was a blur of motion and noise, thick with perfume, coffee, and the warmth of too many bodies.

As I queued for boarding, I took one last look at this city’s central station—where I’d spent six Christmas Eves rushing home over the past six years.

Yesterday morning, I’d still believed I’d return after the holidays.

After all, Ethan Scott was here.

“Director Summers,” General Manager Quinn had said apologetically, “this was all Mr. Scott’s decision…”

“What exactly did he say?” I asked, gripping my year-end bonus slip.

The company was buzzing with holiday excitement—the bonus distribution was the last celebration before break.

But mine was less than a tenth of previous years’.

My junior, whom I’d personally recommended for hire, had just cheerfully told me she’d received far more than expected.

The extra amount she’d received matched precisely what I’d lost.

By company policy, bonuses were tied to major project performance.

Since September, I’d led the Kenton Tech Park Project, working day and night.

My junior, Lila Warren, had barely participated—her only contribution was a presentation I had written and rehearsed for her.

When I asked about it, General Manager Quinn sighed.

“Mr. Scott said Lila is an excellent new hire and deserves encouragement through her bonus.”

I stood there, expressionless, holding that piece of paper.

Mr. Scott—Ethan Scott—was my boyfriend of five years.

The wind on the platform sliced through my coat, sweeping away the warmth of the waiting hall.

I tightened my scarf, breath misting in the cold air.

The train wasn’t in sight yet. I found my carriage line and began deleting photos from my phone.

For five years our relationship had been hidden.

Ethan said office romances violated company policy.

Whenever I’d asked for a picture together, he’d frown.

“We can take them,” he’d say, “but don’t post them anywhere.”

He was so cautious that everyone thought he barely tolerated me.

So when he diverted my year-end bonus, no one questioned it.

I tried calling him. He hung up immediately.

A message arrived seconds later:

“Busy.”

I wasn’t surprised. In five years, he’d almost never answered my calls at work.

But that day I didn’t call for love—I called for answers.

Taking the elevator to the top floor, I walked down the glass corridor.

Behind a wall of tropical plants, Ethan stood beside Lila Warren, pointing at her computer screen.

She leaned close, her scarf brushing his collar.

He was explaining a proposal—patiently, gently.

The same man who used to frown at me and say, “I’m really busy. I don’t have time to teach basic things.”

When I’d made mistakes before, he’d said, “The more painful the lesson, the deeper it sticks.”

I’d believed him. Pain meant growth.

But now, watching him talk softly to Lila, I finally understood: he just hadn’t wanted to.

On his desk sat a take-out breakfast—the kind I used to deliver every morning.

He never liked me coming straight to his office, so I used to bribe the cafeteria lady to drop it off for me.

Sometimes, when he skipped meals, I’d bring it myself.

He’d sigh.

“Your direct supervisor is Daniel Quinn. Don’t you think it’s odd that you keep coming to me?”

Now I heard Lila’s laugh.

“This smells amazing! Is it okay if I have it?”

“Go ahead,” Ethan said without looking up.

She smiled. “You’re the best, Mr. Scott.”

The thick leaves hid me completely.

There was no point asking about the bonus anymore.

I turned away and took the elevator down.

Moments after I reached my desk, everything went black.

A power failure—heavy rain had knocked out the grid.

The company sent an emergency notice: work from home.

People laughed, grabbed umbrellas, and left in groups.

Through the glass doors, I saw Ethan holding his umbrella over Lila, walking her to his car.

A considerate boss indeed.

Rain pooled around my ankles by the time I got home.

When my phone rang, I almost didn’t answer.

“Claire,” he said, “I figured you had an umbrella. You’re home safe, right?”

In the background, I heard Lila’s voice:

“Mr. Scott, would you like some ginger tea?”

“I added extra cheese to this morning’s sandwich,” I said softly. “Was it good?”

He hesitated.

“Yeah… it was good.”

I hung up.

Then I threw away all the groceries I’d bought for him—

paused—

and picked them out again.

The neighborhood cat meowed outside.

“At least someone’s hungry,” I whispered, smiling faintly.

While boiling water, I saw Lila’s social-media post:

Two hands holding mugs of ginger tea.

“Feels so good to have someone who cares.”

I liked the post.

An urgent whistle echoed across the platform.

Announcements blared behind me as the train doors opened.

I boarded, dragging my suitcase down the narrow aisle.

For a second, I thought I heard someone call my name from behind—

maybe it was for me, maybe it wasn’t.

I had no interest in turning around.

The first stop after leaving New Haven Central was Halden Station. A young couple boarded the train. I had seat B; they had A and C.

The girl stamped her foot, annoyed. “Seriously, Liam, how did you buy tickets like this?”

The boy smiled apologetically. “It was packed! At least we’re in the same row.”

Then he turned to me with a hopeful grin. “Would you mind switching seats so we can sit together?”

The girl quickly pulled out a bag of snacks and offered them as if to bribe me.

Looking at their clasped hands and the excitement in their eyes, I smiled.

“Of course not,” I said, standing up.

“Thank you!” The boy helped the girl sit by the window, then stowed their luggage overhead.

“Quick, post it!” she said, eyes gleaming. “We’re heading home for Christmas—first trip as a couple!”

Their laughter was bright, contagious.

I smiled faintly and looked down at my phone—making sure all my photos were deleted.

Our story had also begun on a winter journey, five years ago.

That was my first time leading a solo bid presentation, in Halden City. The responsibility was enormous, and I was terrified of failing.

And fail I did.

That day, a blizzard paralyzed the city—subway closed, taxis nowhere in sight.

I realized I’d never make it in time for the bid.

In panic, I called General Manager Quinn. He cursed before sighing and sending me a contact.

“Mr. Scott’s also in Halden. Have him pick you up. And next time, don’t volunteer for this again!”

My hands shook as I dialed the number.

When he heard my tearful voice explaining the situation, Ethan’s tone softened immediately.

“Don’t panic. Stay where you are. I’m on my way.”

He navigated the snow-covered streets like a man who’d done this a hundred times, glancing at the GPS, avoiding closed roads.

His calm voice steadied my breathing.

“We’ll make it. Just remember—always leave buffer time for everything.”

And we did make it. Barely.

When I came downstairs after submitting the bid, sweat drenched my shirt under my down coat.

Ethan was leaning against his car, holding two cups of coffee.

“What’s your name?” he asked with a faint smile.

That night, I posted a private story visible only to him:

“Met a kind god on a snowy day.”

He liked it within a minute.

I blinked back to the present as the train sped through the night.

A notification flashed across my phone—Lila’s latest post had vanished.

Moments later, Ethan’s name appeared on my screen.

“I’m on my way home,” he said.

“Drive carefully,” I replied.

“You too. Stay warm,” he murmured before hanging up.

Back then, I’d smiled like an idiot at messages like that.

This time, I felt nothing.

“Ethan,” I had asked him once, “can I tell my parents about us this Christmas?”

He’d gone silent before saying,

“No. They’ll only pressure you to get married. Let’s not complicate things.”

Every year since turning twenty-five, my parents’ calls about marriage had multiplied.

I’d deflected every one of them—with the unspoken faith that I already had someone worth waiting for.

I had believed him when he said, “Not yet.”

And I’d kept believing for five years.

The train slowed into Halden Station again—this time for the next stop.

The young couple packed up their things, holding hands as they laughed.

When the broadcast chimed, they stood up together and disappeared down the aisle.

The young couple got off.

The next stop was Yorkhaven Station. A middle-aged couple boarded and sat beside me—the husband lugging all the suitcases while the wife carried an armful of food containers.

I started to stand to offer my seat, but she stopped me with a smile.

“Don’t bother, sweetheart. It’s the only time I can keep him from nagging me.”

The man huffed. “All because I couldn’t find your dad’s favorite mulled wine at the last station, and you won’t stop complaining!”

I hid a grin and shifted to seat A so they could sit together.

Everything went dark.

“Good thing he’d slowed down—another few miles per hour and you’d be gone!”

He left to handle things at the station, and Ethan stayed behind.

He pulled a chair close, expression unreadable.

“How could you be so reckless?” he said quietly. “If the seal was lost, we could’ve reported it and re-issued.”

“But it would’ve ruined the signing,” I murmured. “You helped me last time. I wanted to return the favor.”

“I saw a video once,” the old man beside me said with a smile. “It said watching snow together means you’ll grow old together.”

The woman rolled her eyes. “Our hair’s been white for years, you romantic fool.”

In the Elden snow, Ethan had once turned to me and said the same words—

“Claire, we’ll grow old together.”

I smiled faintly at the window, watching the snow fall.

We won’t anymore.

The fourth stop was Ravenport Central, where I was supposed to change trains. Two more stops, and I’d be home.

But the delay from New Haven finally caught up here—the schedule board blinked red: “Expected Delay: 65 Minutes Due to Heavy Snow.”

Since I no longer had a connection to catch, I wasn’t in a hurry. I found a small café inside the station concourse and ordered a hazelnut latte to pass the time.

Ravenport’s downtown branch of Kensington Group was just across the street. Ethan and I used to come here often for meetings, always with six or seven people in two cars—no one ever suspected a thing.

Back then, under Daniel Quinn’s supervision, I was beginning to stand out. Ethan’s standards were ruthless, and my colleagues often joked that I should learn how to sweeten the boss up a little.

So one day, before a meeting, I brought him coffee.

“Mr. Scott, your coffee,” I said with a straight face.

He glanced up. “Is it the hazelnut latte?”

“Yes,” I replied.

Daniel chuckled. “Oh? Trading your Americano for something sweeter today, Ethan?”

Ethan’s gaze lingered on the label—hazelnut—before he nodded at me. “Thank you.”

It was the first time I’d ever seen him soften at work. That moment became our secret—a quiet intimacy hidden beneath the formality.

From then on, whenever we came to Raventport, I brought him the same drink. It was our unspoken ritual.

So later, when I saw him accept the same latte from Lila, I froze.

“Too sweet,” he said, pushing it away. “Next time, just make it an Americano.”

“I thought Director Quinn liked it this way,” she said brightly. “He told me to add two sugars!”

“Perfect,” I said lightly. “Then I’ll drink both.”

He didn’t even look at me. I finished them both anyway—so sweet it almost hurt.

What changed, Ethan—the coffee, or the person who brought it?

I took another sip now, the bitterness grounding me. My phone buzzed—messages from Daniel.

“You resigned?! I just went to your office—you were gone!” “Ethan saw your letter and tore it up. He’s furious.” “Come back after the holidays. We’ll fix this.”

I blocked him.

Then my building manager called. “Miss, your partner was here earlier,” she said carefully. “He renewed your lease, said you’d be coming back.”

“Did he now?”

“Yes, but he also… went through your things. Looked like he was searching for something.”

My pulse skipped. “What exactly?”

“He didn’t say. But after searching every cabinet, he left in a hurry. He looked… shaken.”

“Thank you,” I said, ending the call.

The call log showed 99+ blocked attempts. I didn’t bother to check who they were from.

I sat quietly, watching the snow fall beyond the fogged glass. Travelers hurried by with suitcases, boots squeaking against the marble floor. The smell of coffee and wet wool filled the air.

When the time felt right, I stood up to leave.

As I passed the counter, the barista greeted a new customer.

“Good afternoon, sir. What can I get for you?”

And then—

“Hazelnut latte.”

A familiar voice cut through the noise of the café.

The man everyone at the company called Mr. Scott—the calm, commanding head of our division—had recently become the subject of gossip.

Apparently, he was seeing someone new.

But the woman in those rumors wasn’t me.

Everyone thought my bitterness toward his rumored “girlfriend” stemmed from an unfair year-end bonus allocation.

They didn’t know that I’d already made my decision. I had packed my bags, printed my resignation letter, and booked a one-way ticket home for Christmas.

After I handed in my letter and walked out of the office, I also walked out of the five-year relationship that had never seen daylight.

From now on, when people ask when I’ll be back, I’ll simply say there’s no return date. He’ll go his way to Manhattan, and I’ll go mine—to Boston.

“Attention passengers, Express Train G3453 is now boarding. Passengers holding tickets for Train G3453, please proceed to Gate 16, Platform 17.”

The red “Expected Delay 15 Minutes” on the board blinked once, turning green.

Commuters immediately surged forward, dragging luggage, rushing through the gate.

I followed along with the crowd, barely needing to walk on my own.

The station was a blur of motion and noise, thick with perfume, coffee, and the warmth of too many bodies.

As I queued for boarding, I took one last look at this city’s central station—where I’d spent six Christmas Eves rushing home over the past six years.

Yesterday morning, I’d still believed I’d return after the holidays.

After all, Ethan Scott was here.

“Director Summers,” General Manager Quinn had said apologetically, “this was all Mr. Scott’s decision…”

“What exactly did he say?” I asked, gripping my year-end bonus slip.

The company was buzzing with holiday excitement—the bonus distribution was the last celebration before break.

But mine was less than a tenth of previous years’.

My junior, whom I’d personally recommended for hire, had just cheerfully told me she’d received far more than expected.

The extra amount she’d received matched precisely what I’d lost.

By company policy, bonuses were tied to major project performance.

Since September, I’d led the Kenton Tech Park Project, working day and night.

My junior, Lila Warren, had barely participated—her only contribution was a presentation I had written and rehearsed for her.

When I asked about it, General Manager Quinn sighed.

“Mr. Scott said Lila is an excellent new hire and deserves encouragement through her bonus.”

I stood there, expressionless, holding that piece of paper.

Mr. Scott—Ethan Scott—was my boyfriend of five years.

The wind on the platform sliced through my coat, sweeping away the warmth of the waiting hall.

I tightened my scarf, breath misting in the cold air.

The train wasn’t in sight yet. I found my carriage line and began deleting photos from my phone.

For five years our relationship had been hidden.

Ethan said office romances violated company policy.

Whenever I’d asked for a picture together, he’d frown.

“We can take them,” he’d say, “but don’t post them anywhere.”

He was so cautious that everyone thought he barely tolerated me.

So when he diverted my year-end bonus, no one questioned it.

I tried calling him. He hung up immediately.

A message arrived seconds later:

“Busy.”

I wasn’t surprised. In five years, he’d almost never answered my calls at work.

But that day I didn’t call for love—I called for answers.

Taking the elevator to the top floor, I walked down the glass corridor.

Behind a wall of tropical plants, Ethan stood beside Lila Warren, pointing at her computer screen.

She leaned close, her scarf brushing his collar.

He was explaining a proposal—patiently, gently.

The same man who used to frown at me and say, “I’m really busy. I don’t have time to teach basic things.”

When I’d made mistakes before, he’d said, “The more painful the lesson, the deeper it sticks.”

I’d believed him. Pain meant growth.

But now, watching him talk softly to Lila, I finally understood: he just hadn’t wanted to.

On his desk sat a take-out breakfast—the kind I used to deliver every morning.

He never liked me coming straight to his office, so I used to bribe the cafeteria lady to drop it off for me.

Sometimes, when he skipped meals, I’d bring it myself.

He’d sigh.

“Your direct supervisor is Daniel Quinn. Don’t you think it’s odd that you keep coming to me?”

Now I heard Lila’s laugh.

“This smells amazing! Is it okay if I have it?”

“Go ahead,” Ethan said without looking up.

She smiled. “You’re the best, Mr. Scott.”

The thick leaves hid me completely.

There was no point asking about the bonus anymore.

I turned away and took the elevator down.

Moments after I reached my desk, everything went black.

A power failure—heavy rain had knocked out the grid.

The company sent an emergency notice: work from home.

People laughed, grabbed umbrellas, and left in groups.

Through the glass doors, I saw Ethan holding his umbrella over Lila, walking her to his car.

A considerate boss indeed.

Rain pooled around my ankles by the time I got home.

When my phone rang, I almost didn’t answer.

“Claire,” he said, “I figured you had an umbrella. You’re home safe, right?”

In the background, I heard Lila’s voice:

“Mr. Scott, would you like some ginger tea?”

“I added extra cheese to this morning’s sandwich,” I said softly. “Was it good?”

He hesitated.

“Yeah… it was good.”

I hung up.

Then I threw away all the groceries I’d bought for him—

paused—

and picked them out again.

The neighborhood cat meowed outside.

“At least someone’s hungry,” I whispered, smiling faintly.

While boiling water, I saw Lila’s social-media post:

Two hands holding mugs of ginger tea.

“Feels so good to have someone who cares.”

I liked the post.

An urgent whistle echoed across the platform.

Announcements blared behind me as the train doors opened.

I boarded, dragging my suitcase down the narrow aisle.

For a second, I thought I heard someone call my name from behind—

maybe it was for me, maybe it wasn’t.

I had no interest in turning around.

The first stop after leaving New Haven Central was Halden Station. A young couple boarded the train. I had seat B; they had A and C.

The girl stamped her foot, annoyed. “Seriously, Liam, how did you buy tickets like this?”

The boy smiled apologetically. “It was packed! At least we’re in the same row.”

Then he turned to me with a hopeful grin. “Would you mind switching seats so we can sit together?”

The girl quickly pulled out a bag of snacks and offered them as if to bribe me.

Looking at their clasped hands and the excitement in their eyes, I smiled.

“Of course not,” I said, standing up.

“Thank you!” The boy helped the girl sit by the window, then stowed their luggage overhead.

“Quick, post it!” she said, eyes gleaming. “We’re heading home for Christmas—first trip as a couple!”

Their laughter was bright, contagious.

I smiled faintly and looked down at my phone—making sure all my photos were deleted.

Our story had also begun on a winter journey, five years ago.

That was my first time leading a solo bid presentation, in Halden City. The responsibility was enormous, and I was terrified of failing.

And fail I did.

That day, a blizzard paralyzed the city—subway closed, taxis nowhere in sight.

I realized I’d never make it in time for the bid.

In panic, I called General Manager Quinn. He cursed before sighing and sending me a contact.

“Mr. Scott’s also in Halden. Have him pick you up. And next time, don’t volunteer for this again!”

My hands shook as I dialed the number.

When he heard my tearful voice explaining the situation, Ethan’s tone softened immediately.

“Don’t panic. Stay where you are. I’m on my way.”

He navigated the snow-covered streets like a man who’d done this a hundred times, glancing at the GPS, avoiding closed roads.

His calm voice steadied my breathing.

“We’ll make it. Just remember—always leave buffer time for everything.”

And we did make it. Barely.

When I came downstairs after submitting the bid, sweat drenched my shirt under my down coat.

Ethan was leaning against his car, holding two cups of coffee.

“What’s your name?” he asked with a faint smile.

That night, I posted a private story visible only to him:

“Met a kind god on a snowy day.”

He liked it within a minute.

I blinked back to the present as the train sped through the night.

A notification flashed across my phone—Lila’s latest post had vanished.

Moments later, Ethan’s name appeared on my screen.

“I’m on my way home,” he said.

“Drive carefully,” I replied.

“You too. Stay warm,” he murmured before hanging up.

Back then, I’d smiled like an idiot at messages like that.

This time, I felt nothing.

“Ethan,” I had asked him once, “can I tell my parents about us this Christmas?”

He’d gone silent before saying,

“No. They’ll only pressure you to get married. Let’s not complicate things.”

Every year since turning twenty-five, my parents’ calls about marriage had multiplied.

I’d deflected every one of them—with the unspoken faith that I already had someone worth waiting for.

I had believed him when he said, “Not yet.”

And I’d kept believing for five years.

The train slowed into Halden Station again—this time for the next stop.

The young couple packed up their things, holding hands as they laughed.

When the broadcast chimed, they stood up together and disappeared down the aisle.

The young couple got off.

The next stop was Yorkhaven Station. A middle-aged couple boarded and sat beside me—the husband lugging all the suitcases while the wife carried an armful of food containers.

I started to stand to offer my seat, but she stopped me with a smile.

“Don’t bother, sweetheart. It’s the only time I can keep him from nagging me.”

The man huffed. “All because I couldn’t find your dad’s favorite mulled wine at the last station, and you won’t stop complaining!”

I hid a grin and shifted to seat A so they could sit together.

They thanked me, still bickering affectionately as they settled in.

The aroma of spiced ginger wine filled the carriage.

Yorkhaven’s specialty, famous for its warmth.

My connection with Ethan was tied to a bottle of wine like that.

Back then I had already become a full-time employee under Daniel Quinn’s supervision.

He and Ethan were in Yorkhaven to finalize a contract signing.

“Claire,” Daniel told me, “buy a few bottles of the local ginger wine for Mr. Grant’s team. Use the petty-cash card.”

That was the real reason he’d brought me along.

I ran the errand gladly—until I came back and saw chaos outside the hotel.

A man on a motorcycle had just snatched the document bag from Ethan’s secretary.

“Call the police!” Daniel shouted. “The company seal’s inside!”

Rounding the corner with the wine, I came face-to-face with the thief.

Without thinking, I lunged.

The impact sent us both sprawling onto the icy pavement.

Everything went dark.

When I woke up in the hospital, Daniel pressed his hands together.

“Good thing he’d slowed down—another few miles per hour and you’d be gone!”

He left to handle things at the station, and Ethan stayed behind.

He pulled a chair close, expression unreadable.

“How could you be so reckless?” he said quietly. “If the seal was lost, we could’ve reported it and re-issued.”

“But it would’ve ruined the signing,” I murmured. “You helped me last time. I wanted to return the favor.”

He didn’t reply right away—just reached out and held my hand.

When I looked up, he was watching me.

“My name’s Ethan Scott,” he said softly.

After I was discharged, the driver arranged to pick me up—but somehow Ethan showed up instead.

He took me to the lake at sunset, the golden light shimmering across the water.

“I’ve been thinking,” he said, his voice low. “If that foolish, fearless girl is willing to fall into my arms again, I’ll never let her go.”

The world glowed in amber tones, and when he kissed my forehead, everything felt weightless.

Now, years later, that memory felt like someone else’s life.

He’d once looked at my bruises with heartbreak; now he looked at my fever patch with mild annoyance.

“Feeling better?” he asked that morning, setting down a bag of soup.

“Depends,” I said flatly.

“I didn’t see breakfast on your desk today. I figured something was wrong.”

I almost laughed. “You make it sound like I’m a broken coffee machine.”

He frowned. “You’re sick and still working?”

“Nothing new,” I said, closing my laptop. “You’ve already overstayed your three-minute check-in quota, Mr. Scott.”

I stood to leave, but he caught my wrist.

“Go home and rest.”

A boyfriend’s concern, in a boss’s tone.

I shook him off.

As I stepped out, I heard Lila’s voice from the next office, sweet and pleading.

“Mr. Scott, can you look at my proposal?”

When I returned later, the project group chat had exploded.

Daniel had just added Ethan. His message was brief:

“Project is entering final stage. Full responsibility now transferred to Lila Warren.”

The office buzzed with whispers.

Everyone knew Ethan didn’t like me, but this—this was deliberate humiliation.

I typed one word:

“Acknowledged.”

And that was that.

I handed Lila the files she needed, submitted a sick-leave request—approved instantly—and left my resignation letter on my desk.

The company where I’d spent six years—the grave of my love—was behind me now.

Across the aisle, the middle-aged woman chuckled, nudging her husband.

“Tell me, could you ever catch up to a high-speed train by car?”

He laughed. “Three hundred miles an hour—what, you think I’m driving a rocket?”

Right. Once you’re drifting further apart, how could you possibly catch up?

The third stop was Elden Station. An elderly couple boarded slowly, supporting each other as they made their way down the aisle.

Seeing the man’s cane, I automatically slid to the window seat.

“Thank you, dear,” said the woman kindly. “My husband’s legs aren’t what they used to be, so I like to sit beside him.”

The man chuckled. “And she still complains the train’s too crowded every year!”

“You’re the one who insisted we see the snow,” she shot back. “Now we almost didn’t get tickets home!”

He smiled. “We can only see the snow so many more times, love.”

I smiled faintly, looking out at the white landscape.

I’d only been to Elden once before.

That one trip was also my last with Ethan.

His promotion was about to be announced, and I was genuinely proud of him.

He’d always been ambitious, driven—his success felt inevitable.

We spent that winter weekend in Elden’s famous snow forest, building a snowman with gloved hands, laughing as flakes caught in our hair.

“If the owner rates it over eighty points, the meal’s free,” Ethan had said.

We’d been given a twenty.

The owner said our snowman “barely looked human.”

We laughed until we fell into the snow, breathless, kissing in the cold.

My fingers had gone numb, but my heart was full.

That winter had felt like a scene in a snow globe—sealed, perfect, untouchable.

Later that night, over warm sake in a quiet izakaya, Ethan looked at me seriously.

“We need to be more careful,” he said.

“Haven’t we been?” I smiled.

“More discreet,” he clarified.

So I agreed—naively believing it was a necessary precaution, not the start of our decline.

It wasn’t that I never thought about quitting the job.

But it was the dream company, the position I’d fought to earn.

And more than that, I wanted to see him every day—even if only from a distance.

Compared to the heartbreaks that followed, the fever I had today was nothing.

I’d stayed up finishing a project handover before my resignation, but exhaustion hit hard.

I was half-asleep on the sofa when I heard the door open.

Ethan stepped in, setting down bags of soup and porridge.

He still had a key.

He looked around. “Why’s the place half empty?”

“New year cleaning,” I murmured.

He unpacked the food in silence. When he looked up, he froze.

“Where are our photos?”

I used to keep our Polaroids all over the apartment—on the coffee table, bookshelf, kitchen counter.

Little reminders of something private and real.

“Oh,” I said lightly. “Some colleagues visited recently. I put them away.”

He said nothing, just pressed a cool hand to my forehead, checking my temperature.

“Still a bit warm,” he murmured, replacing my fever patch.

“I’ll be fine,” I said. “It’s just a cold.”

He paused. “I meant the photos.”

Then, quietly, “Eat something first.”

I sat up and looked at the spread of soup and congee before me, but my stomach turned.

“Not hungry?” he asked gently. “At least have some water.”

I turned away—and his phone rang.

Lila’s voice came through, high and nervous.

“Mr. Scott, I can’t find the final acceptance form for the Tech Park project—what should I do?”

He grabbed his coat. “Hold on, I’m coming.”

Then, glancing at me: “Is this how you left things?”

He didn’t wait for an answer. The door shut behind him with a thud.

The missing file?

It was labeled and indexed in the handover folder I’d given her.

She just hadn’t bothered to read it.

But this was her chance to call him—her chance to be saved.

A few minutes later, my phone buzzed.

Found it. You wrote it clearly. Then: a money transfer notification. The amount—exactly what he’d taken from my bonus.

I clicked return.

He sent an emoji.

“Rest up. I’m heading into a meeting.”

Every Friday night, he had a three-hour video call with headquarters.

He wouldn’t be checking his phone.

So I sent one last message:

“Let’s break up.”

Then I blocked him.

“I saw a video once,” the old man beside me said with a smile. “It said watching snow together means you’ll grow old together.”

The woman rolled her eyes. “Our hair’s been white for years, you romantic fool.”

In the Elden snow, Ethan had once turned to me and said the same words—

“Claire, we’ll grow old together.”

I smiled faintly at the window, watching the snow fall.

We won’t anymore.

I am now 18, from 16 like most it made my life hell.
I like to think of myself as a smart lad - I worked very hard at school. Something I found that always annoyed me was that caffeine really triggered my bloating. So when I used to have a coffee when doing school work I used to get really frustrated.
Similarly, when doing my office internship, I drank coffee and then ended up needing to go to the toilet just to pass wind. Very embarrassing and made working hell. But as i’m sure many of you are aware, caffeine can be needed during those long excel days.
So, now how it has changed my life. I have been creating a caffeine company, inspired my by R-CPD, where by its a strip that dissolves on your tongue. Releasing the caffeine in your mouth instead of your intestines. After trying my samples they actually worked and I was so happy with them.
I am now post botox, but still super excited to release my product because I know how much it will help the community.
I am releasing them soon, but I have made a waiting list on my website eezystrip.com . If you sign up now, I will be making a discount specially for people with R-CPD to support the struggle.

The same man who used to frown at me and say, “I’m really busy. I don’t have time to teach basic things.”

When I’d made mistakes before, he’d said, “The more painful the lesson, the deeper it sticks.”

I’d believed him. Pain meant growth.

But now, watching him talk softly to Lila, I finally understood: he just hadn’t wanted to.

On his desk sat a take-out breakfast—the kind I used to deliver every morning.

He never liked me coming straight to his office, so I used to bribe the cafeteria lady to drop it off for me.

Sometimes, when he skipped meals, I’d bring it myself.

He’d sigh.

“Your direct supervisor is Daniel Quinn. Don’t you think it’s odd that you keep coming to me?”

Now I heard Lila’s laugh.

“This smells amazing! Is it okay if I have it?”

“Go ahead,” Ethan said without looking up.

She smiled. “You’re the best, Mr. Scott.”

The thick leaves hid me completely.

There was no point asking about the bonus anymore.

I turned away and took the elevator down.

Moments after I reached my desk, everything went black.

A power failure—heavy rain had knocked out the grid.

The company sent an emergency notice: work from home.

People laughed, grabbed umbrellas, and left in groups.

Through the glass doors, I saw Ethan holding his umbrella over Lila, walking her to his car.

A considerate boss indeed.

Rain pooled around my ankles by the time I got home.

When my phone rang, I almost didn’t answer.

“Claire,” he said, “I figured you had an umbrella. You’re home safe, right?”

In the background, I heard Lila’s voice:

“Mr. Scott, would you like some ginger tea?”

“I added extra cheese to this morning’s sandwich,” I said softly. “Was it good?”

He hesitated.

“Yeah… it was good.”

I hung up.

Then I threw away all the groceries I’d bought for him—

paused—

and picked them out again.

The neighborhood cat meowed outside.

“At least someone’s hungry,” I whispered, smiling faintly.

While boiling water, I saw Lila’s social-media post:

Two hands holding mugs of ginger tea.

“Feels so good to have someone who cares.”

I liked the post.

An urgent whistle echoed across the platform.

Announcements blared behind me as the train doors opened.

I boarded, dragging my suitcase down the narrow aisle.

For a second, I thought I heard someone call my name from behind—

maybe it was for me, maybe it wasn’t.

I had no interest in turning around.

The first stop after leaving New Haven Central was Halden Station. A young couple boarded the train. I had seat B; they had A and C.

The girl stamped her foot, annoyed. “Seriously, Liam, how did you buy tickets like this?”

The boy smiled apologetically. “It was packed! At least we’re in the same row.”

Then he turned to me with a hopeful grin. “Would you mind switching seats so we can sit together?”

The girl quickly pulled out a bag of snacks and offered them as if to bribe me.

Looking at their clasped hands and the excitement in their eyes, I smiled.

“Of course not,” I said, standing up.

“Thank you!” The boy helped the girl sit by the window, then stowed their luggage overhead.

“Quick, post it!” she said, eyes gleaming. “We’re heading home for Christmas—first trip as a couple!”

Their laughter was bright, contagious.

I smiled faintly and looked down at my phone—making sure all my photos were deleted.

Our story had also begun on a winter journey, five years ago.

That was my first time leading a solo bid presentation, in Halden City. The responsibility was enormous, and I was terrified of failing.

And fail I did.

That day, a blizzard paralyzed the city—subway closed, taxis nowhere in sight.

I realized I’d never make it in time for the bid.

In panic, I called General Manager Quinn. He cursed before sighing and sending me a contact.

“Mr. Scott’s also in Halden. Have him pick you up. And next time, don’t volunteer for this again!”

My hands shook as I dialed the number.

When he heard my tearful voice explaining the situation, Ethan’s tone softened immediately.

“Don’t panic. Stay where you are. I’m on my way.”

He navigated the snow-covered streets like a man who’d done this a hundred times, glancing at the GPS, avoiding closed roads.

His calm voice steadied my breathing.

“We’ll make it. Just remember—always leave buffer time for everything.”

And we did make it. Barely.

When I came downstairs after submitting the bid, sweat drenched my shirt under my down coat.

Ethan was leaning against his car, holding two cups of coffee.

“What’s your name?” he asked with a faint smile.

That night, I posted a private story visible only to him:

“Met a kind god on a snowy day.”

He liked it within a minute.

I blinked back to the present as the train sped through the night.

A notification flashed across my phone—Lila’s latest post had vanished.

Moments later, Ethan’s name appeared on my screen.

“I’m on my way home,” he said.

“Drive carefully,” I replied.

“You too. Stay warm,” he murmured before hanging up.

Back then, I’d smiled like an idiot at messages like that.

This time, I felt nothing.

“Ethan,” I had asked him once, “can I tell my parents about us this Christmas?”

He’d gone silent before saying,

“No. They’ll only pressure you to get married. Let’s not complicate things.”

Every year since turning twenty-five, my parents’ calls about marriage had multiplied.

I’d deflected every one of them—with the unspoken faith that I already had someone worth waiting for.

I had believed him when he said, “Not yet.”

And I’d kept believing for five years.

The train slowed into Halden Station again—this time for the next stop.

The young couple packed up their things, holding hands as they laughed.

When the broadcast chimed, they stood up together and disappeared down the aisle.

The young couple got off.

The next stop was Yorkhaven Station. A middle-aged couple boarded and sat beside me—the husband lugging all the suitcases while the wife carried an armful of food containers.

I started to stand to offer my seat, but she stopped me with a smile.

“Don’t bother, sweetheart. It’s the only time I can keep him from nagging me.”

The man huffed. “All because I couldn’t find your dad’s favorite mulled wine at the last station, and you won’t stop complaining!”

I hid a grin and shifted to seat A so they could sit together.

They thanked me, still bickering affectionately as they settled in.

The aroma of spiced ginger wine filled the carriage.

Yorkhaven’s specialty, famous for its warmth.

My connection with Ethan was tied to a bottle of wine like that.

Back then I had already become a full-time employee under Daniel Quinn’s supervision.

He and Ethan were in Yorkhaven to finalize a contract signing.

“Claire,” Daniel told me, “buy a few bottles of the local ginger wine for Mr. Grant’s team. Use the petty-cash card.”

That was the real reason he’d brought me along.

I ran the errand gladly—until I came back and saw chaos outside the hotel.

A man on a motorcycle had just snatched the document bag from Ethan’s secretary.

“Call the police!” Daniel shouted. “The company seal’s inside!”

Rounding the corner with the wine, I came face-to-face with the thief.

Without thinking, I lunged.

The impact sent us both sprawling onto the icy pavement.

Everything went dark.

When I woke up in the hospital, Daniel pressed his hands together.

“Good thing he’d slowed down—another few miles per hour and you’d be gone!”

He left to handle things at the station, and Ethan stayed behind.

He pulled a chair close, expression unreadable.

“How could you be so reckless?” he said quietly. “If the seal was lost, we could’ve reported it and re-issued.”

“But it would’ve ruined the signing,” I murmured. “You helped me last time. I wanted to return the favor.”

He didn’t reply right away—just reached out and held my hand.

When I looked up, he was watching me.

“My name’s Ethan Scott,” he said softly.

After I was discharged, the driver arranged to pick me up—but somehow Ethan showed up instead.

He took me to the lake at sunset, the golden light shimmering across the water.

“I’ve been thinking,” he said, his voice low. “If that foolish, fearless girl is willing to fall into my arms again, I’ll never let her go.”

The world glowed in amber tones, and when he kissed my forehead, everything felt weightless.

Now, years later, that memory felt like someone else’s life.

He’d once looked at my bruises with heartbreak; now he looked at my fever patch with mild annoyance.

“Feeling better?” he asked that morning, setting down a bag of soup.

“Depends,” I said flatly.

“I didn’t see breakfast on your desk today. I figured something was wrong.”

I almost laughed. “You make it sound like I’m a broken coffee machine.”

He frowned. “You’re sick and still working?”

“Nothing new,” I said, closing my laptop. “You’ve already overstayed your three-minute check-in quota, Mr. Scott.”

I stood to leave, but he caught my wrist.

“Go home and rest.”

A boyfriend’s concern, in a boss’s tone.

I shook him off.

As I stepped out, I heard Lila’s voice from the next office, sweet and pleading.

“Mr. Scott, can you look at my proposal?”

When I returned later, the project group chat had exploded.

Daniel had just added Ethan. His message was brief:

“Project is entering final stage. Full responsibility now transferred to Lila Warren.”

The office buzzed with whispers.

Everyone knew Ethan didn’t like me, but this—this was deliberate humiliation.

I typed one word:

“Acknowledged.”

And that was that.

I handed Lila the files she needed, submitted a sick-leave request—approved instantly—and left my resignation letter on my desk.

The company where I’d spent six years—the grave of my love—was behind me now.

Across the aisle, the middle-aged woman chuckled, nudging her husband.

“Tell me, could you ever catch up to a high-speed train by car?”

He laughed. “Three hundred miles an hour—what, you think I’m driving a rocket?”

Right. Once you’re drifting further apart, how could you possibly catch up?

The third stop was Elden Station. An elderly couple boarded slowly, supporting each other as they made their way down the aisle.

Seeing the man’s cane, I automatically slid to the window seat.

“Thank you, dear,” said the woman kindly. “My husband’s legs aren’t what they used to be, so I like to sit beside him.”

The man chuckled. “And she still complains the train’s too crowded every year!”

“You’re the one who insisted we see the snow,” she shot back. “Now we almost didn’t get tickets home!”

He smiled. “We can only see the snow so many more times, love.”

I smiled faintly, looking out at the white landscape.

I’d only been to Elden once before.

That one trip was also my last with Ethan.

His promotion was about to be announced, and I was genuinely proud of him.

He’d always been ambitious, driven—his success felt inevitable.

We spent that winter weekend in Elden’s famous snow forest, building a snowman with gloved hands, laughing as flakes caught in our hair.

“If the owner rates it over eighty points, the meal’s free,” Ethan had said.

We’d been given a twenty.

The owner said our snowman “barely looked human.”

We laughed until we fell into the snow, breathless, kissing in the cold.

My fingers had gone numb, but my heart was full.

That winter had felt like a scene in a snow globe—sealed, perfect, untouchable.

Later that night, over warm sake in a quiet izakaya, Ethan looked at me seriously.

“We need to be more careful,” he said.

“Haven’t we been?” I smiled.

“More discreet,” he clarified.

So I agreed—naively believing it was a necessary precaution, not the start of our decline.

It wasn’t that I never thought about quitting the job.

But it was the dream company, the position I’d fought to earn.

And more than that, I wanted to see him every day—even if only from a distance.

Compared to the heartbreaks that followed, the fever I had today was nothing.

I’d stayed up finishing a project handover before my resignation, but exhaustion hit hard.

I was half-asleep on the sofa when I heard the door open.

Ethan stepped in, setting down bags of soup and porridge.

He still had a key.

He looked around. “Why’s the place half empty?”

“New year cleaning,” I murmured.

He unpacked the food in silence. When he looked up, he froze.

“Where are our photos?”

I used to keep our Polaroids all over the apartment—on the coffee table, bookshelf, kitchen counter.

Little reminders of something private and real.

“Oh,” I said lightly. “Some colleagues visited recently. I put them away.”

He said nothing, just pressed a cool hand to my forehead, checking my temperature.

“Still a bit warm,” he murmured, replacing my fever patch.

“I’ll be fine,” I said. “It’s just a cold.”

He paused. “I meant the photos.”

Then, quietly, “Eat something first.”

I sat up and looked at the spread of soup and congee before me, but my stomach turned.

“Not hungry?” he asked gently. “At least have some water.”

I turned away—and his phone rang.

Lila’s voice came through, high and nervous.

“Mr. Scott, I can’t find the final acceptance form for the Tech Park project—what should I do?”

He grabbed his coat. “Hold on, I’m coming.”

Then, glancing at me: “Is this how you left things?”

He didn’t wait for an answer. The door shut behind him with a thud.

The missing file?

It was labeled and indexed in the handover folder I’d given her.

She just hadn’t bothered to read it.

But this was her chance to call him—her chance to be saved.

A few minutes later, my phone buzzed.

Found it. You wrote it clearly. Then: a money transfer notification. The amount—exactly what he’d taken from my bonus.

I clicked return.

He sent an emoji.

“Rest up. I’m heading into a meeting.”

Every Friday night, he had a three-hour video call with headquarters.

He wouldn’t be checking his phone.

So I sent one last message:

“Let’s break up.”

Then I blocked him.

“I saw a video once,” the old man beside me said with a smile. “It said watching snow together means you’ll grow old together.”

The woman rolled her eyes. “Our hair’s been white for years, you romantic fool.”

In the Elden snow, Ethan had once turned to me and said the same words—

“Claire, we’ll grow old together.”

I smiled faintly at the window, watching the snow fall.

We won’t anymore.

The fourth stop was Ravenport Central, where I was supposed to change trains. Two more stops, and I’d be home.

But the delay from New Haven finally caught up here—the schedule board blinked red: “Expected Delay: 65 Minutes Due to Heavy Snow.”

Since I no longer had a connection to catch, I wasn’t in a hurry. I found a small café inside the station concourse and ordered a hazelnut latte to pass the time.

Ravenport’s downtown branch of Kensington Group was just across the street. Ethan and I used to come here often for meetings, always with six or seven people in two cars—no one ever suspected a thing.

Back then, under Daniel Quinn’s supervision, I was beginning to stand out. Ethan’s standards were ruthless, and my colleagues often joked that I should learn how to sweeten the boss up a little.

So one day, before a meeting, I brought him coffee.

“Mr. Scott, your coffee,” I said with a straight face.

He glanced up. “Is it the hazelnut latte?”

“Yes,” I replied.

Daniel chuckled. “Oh? Trading your Americano for something sweeter today, Ethan?”

Ethan’s gaze lingered on the label—hazelnut—before he nodded at me. “Thank you.”

It was the first time I’d ever seen him soften at work. That moment became our secret—a quiet intimacy hidden beneath the formality.

From then on, whenever we came to Raventport, I brought him the same drink. It was our unspoken ritual.

So later, when I saw him accept the same latte from Lila, I froze.

“Too sweet,” he said, pushing it away. “Next time, just make it an Americano.”

“I thought Director Quinn liked it this way,” she said brightly. “He told me to add two sugars!”

“Perfect,” I said lightly. “Then I’ll drink both.”

He didn’t even look at me. I finished them both anyway—so sweet it almost hurt.

What changed, Ethan—the coffee, or the person who brought it?

I took another sip now, the bitterness grounding me. My phone buzzed—messages from Daniel.

“You resigned?! I just went to your office—you were gone!” “Ethan saw your letter and tore it up. He’s furious.” “Come back after the holidays. We’ll fix this.”

I blocked him.

Then my building manager called. “Miss, your partner was here earlier,” she said carefully. “He renewed your lease, said you’d be coming back.”

“Did he now?”

“Yes, but he also… went through your things. Looked like he was searching for something.”

My pulse skipped. “What exactly?”

“He didn’t say. But after searching every cabinet, he left in a hurry. He looked… shaken.”

“Thank you,” I said, ending the call.

The call log showed 99+ blocked attempts. I didn’t bother to check who they were from.

I sat quietly, watching the snow fall beyond the fogged glass. Travelers hurried by with suitcases, boots squeaking against the marble floor. The smell of coffee and wet wool filled the air.

When the time felt right, I stood up to leave.

As I passed the counter, the barista greeted a new customer.

“Good afternoon, sir. What can I get for you?”

And then—

“Hazelnut latte.”

A familiar voice cut through the noise of the café.

Recently my workplace and made team leaders  for our department. This team leader, she is younger than me and has been in this position for over 2 years. One day I was working in a different office and the team leader was there. The person who’s at that office went on holiday so she came to that location as safety, we never allow anyone to be alone at any location. I get to work I set up my space and she comes in later on. She sits and we start talking having these deep conversations about people and emotions and how they are reflected on to us. She says let’s go and have some coffee. We walk to Mc Donald’s and she buys me a coffee then we walk back and end up talking some more. Then I have my client come over she leaves.

1otali1,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeworkhelpNY/comments/1otali1/how_i_help_students_choose_persuasive_speech/,How I help students choose persuasive speech topics that don’t sound overused,"Every semester, I see my students hit the same wall - the moment they have to choose persuasive speech , speech topics and suddenly forget all their opinions. And you know what? They stare at the screen, jot down “good persuasive speech topics,” hoping for inspiration and magic, and end UP drowning in a list of overused ideas. You know the words: ""school uniform"", ""social media sucks"" and ""recycling saves the planet"". I can almost predict them before they say a word.

A while back, I came across [https://helpwithessay.org/](https://helpwithessay.org/?utm_source=post56&utm_medium=1)  while helping one particularly stressed student brainstorm ideas. I liked how it broke down topic selection and structure without sounding too academic and artificial. It gave examples that felt real - like ""why coffee should be considered a meak"" or ""why dorm curfews don't make sense."" I began to borrow this approach in class, and suddenly the students seemed alive.

What I’ve learned is that the best topics for persuasive speech come from personal tension - something that genuinely annoys or excites you. When a student talks about a rule that frustrates them or a change they want to make at their school the audience feels it. I remember one student passionately arguing for campus, campus Wi-Fi to have an ""emergency priority mode"" during final exams. It was funny, but also smart and relatable.

The truth is, good topics for persuasive speeches don’t have to sound grand or global. They just need a heartbeat. If you care about it, you’ll convince others to care too.

Over time, I stopped categorizing speeches purely by structure and started listening to them to make sure they were correct.  Some students wavered, others became emotional, but the moment they  dropped the “textbook voice,” their confidence began to unfold. That's when the persuasion happens.

So yes forget the tired templates and choose something that makes you feel something - frustration pride curiosity. That’s where the real persuasive speeches begin.

 i really need some help sorting this out. i’ve cut back on the neon-colored tallboys (red bull, bang energy drink, reign energy drink flavours, etc.) because the sugar content, synthetic caffeine, and artificial food colorings started messing with my blood pressure and blood sugar levels. reading stuff from the american academy of pediatrics and centers for disease control just made me realize i can’t keep ignoring it.
now i’m stuck trying to find something that actually works. i need healthy energy drinks.  sugar-free energy drinks or natural energy drinks that give a real energy boost but don’t wreck me. green tea and guayakí yerba mate are nice, but the energy levels are too mild when i’m cramming or working out.
here’s what’s on my list and what i’ve heard (in order of importance):
* jocko go + celsius original. zero sugar, b vitamins etc. but i don’t know if the artificial sweeteners or sugar substitutes will trigger the same stomach issues i’ve had before.


* gfuel, 5-hour energy, gorilla mind, 3d energy drink. hyped up online, but i don’t love the artificial food colorings or the sketchy balance of natural caffeine vs synthetic caffeine.


* hiball energy, naked sparkling energy drink, v8 +energy sparkling orange pineapple juice. plant based natural caffeine, natural flavors, vitamins and minerals. healthier on paper, but i’m not sure they actually deliver energy compared to sports drinks.


* black coffee, coconut water, protein-rich foods, high-fiber foods. yes, i know a balanced diet helps, but i still need something reliable to grab when i’m running on empty.


my questions:
* what’s your go-to green energy drink or organic energy drinks option that doesn’t spike blood sugar levels?


* has anyone used rhodiola rosea, green tea extract, guarana seed extract, or organic caffeine blends long term? how does the energy compare to a classic red bull?


* if you’ve switched to sugar-free energy drinks, do the artificial sweeteners feel fine, or do they cause issues?


* and are orange energy drinks or cran energy drink mixes actually decent, or do they all taste like lite energy drink knockoffs?
feel like i’m overthinking every option, so i’d really appreciate hearing what’s actually worked for people here.

I have been noticing the usual benefits like more female attraction, way more energy, naturally waking up early, a calmer mood…

I also feel like I’m getting “lucky” in a sense. This past weekend I went to order  a small coffee, but the barista decided to give me a large for the price of a small (not a big deal, but I thought it was pretty rad) But the big deal was when I got pulled over. It happened to be a female cop. She was so kind to me and she happened to work with a cousin of mine. When she found out, she turned her body cam off and told me she’s not going to give me a ticket haha. I remember thinking “yeah this would have gone a different way without SR”

**BFR** means **""Be For Real""** and it's usually used when someone says or does something unbelievable, dramatic, or just *too much*. It's basically calling someone out in a casual, joking, or slightly sarcastic way.

**Examples:**

* “You paid $15 for iced coffee?? **BFR (Be For Real)**.”
* “You thought the meeting would *end early*?? **BFR (Be For Real)**.”

It works as a reality check phrase — sometimes serious, sometimes playful — depending on the tone.

1otadw9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1otadw9/i_didnt_learn_to_say_no_while_growing_up_which/,"I didn't learn to say no while growing up, which obviously caused parenting problems.","My name is Emma. Not Charlotte. Not Sean, and obviously not a celebrity like Emma Watson. Emma—the name is awkwardly sandwiched between two siblings, whose names blend together like a complete unit, while mine stands alone, like something added later and crammed in. Even as a child, I understood what this meant. Charlotte and Sean. C and S. And I was the interlude, the spoiler, the odd one out.



Of course, my mother never said it outright. She didn't need to. It was all evident in how she smoothed Charlotte's hair with one hand and adjusted Sean's collar with the other, her attention perfectly focused on them, while I stood outside that invisible circle. It was also evident in the Christmas photos, where Charlotte and Sean wore matching deep burgundy and forest green outfits, while I wore bright yellow—the one Charlotte insisted on buying last year, vibrant, cheerful, yet utterly out of place.



I understood early on that the easiest way was to compromise. Charlotte wanted my new dress for Christmas—the blue lace-collar dress I'd been longing for for a year—and I gave it to her without hesitation. As compensation, Dad bought me a toy train; I was twelve then. After all, she was older than me, and she deserved nice things.



 Sean was only five, but he wanted my dollhouse, not to play with it like a traditional toy, but to take it apart and examine it like a little architect. I didn't object either. What good would objecting do? Mom would definitely suggest I share. Dad would look up from his newspaper, mutter ""Don't be selfish,"" and then continue reading.



So, I became the giver, the accommodator, the one who never said ""no.""



It's not that I was weak or incompetent. Perhaps it was, but I'd been justifying myself for so many years that I couldn't see the truth. I told myself that what I was doing was kind, generous, and easier. Avoiding conflict is a kind of wisdom. But deep down, in the places where we hide those truths we don't want to face, I knew: I was afraid of what would happen if I refused.



This pattern continued into adolescence and adulthood. I studied college majors approved by my parents: accounting, practical, career-oriented. I dated people who seemed to fit their standards. I molded myself into the perfect image. When Matt proposed, I said yes because saying no was impossible for me.



Matt was handsome, conforming to conventional beauty standards. He was tall, broad-shouldered, with dark hair, and deep-set eyes that seemed to hold an unfathomable depth. He worked in finance, wore expensive suits, and spoke with unwavering confidence, as if he had never questioned whether he deserved his place in the world. He possessed everything I lacked.



""You're perfect,"" he told me at our engagement, but his tone sounded more like an assessment than a compliment. ""Well-educated, but not aggressive. Beautiful, but not vain. You'll be a good wife.""



I should have heard a warning in those words. I should have realized that he wasn't seeing me, Emma, ​​but rather the concept of Emma, ​​the undefined role of Emma. But I was twenty-six, weary of my mother's scathing comments about Charlotte's happy marriage and two beautiful children, and Matt seemed to be the answer to a question I didn't want to address.



We got married in the fall, and the wedding was less of a celebration and more of a performance. Charlotte was my bridesmaid, and her carefully chosen dress was radiant; somehow, she overshadowed me. Sean's toast was incredibly awkward, but everyone pretended to be charming. Matt's family crowded the other side of the church: his mother just stared at me, his father was present but distracted, and his three brothers looked at me with what, in hindsight, a mocking tolerance, as if I were some particularly amusing ""prey.""



My first miscarriage occurred four months after the wedding. That night, I was awakened by spasms and bleeding, and by morning, the budding life had vanished. Matt drove me to the hospital, his teeth clenched, saying nothing. In the stark white hospital room, the doctor confirmed what I already knew. Matt stood by the window, his back to me.



“We’ll try again,” he said flatly, as if discussing a failed business deal.



We did try again. The second pregnancy lasted a longer twelve weeks, enough for me to start dreaming about the future, enough for me to whisper the baby’s name in the dark. I wanted to call her Pearl; Matt said Brooklyn, because it was during our business trip to New York, which he said happened on our anniversary vacation. Then, that child too slipped away, taking not only that hope but all the possibilities of the future with her. The doctors used terms like “complications,” “tissue damage,” and “unlikely to be a full-term pregnancy,” but their meaning was simple: I wouldn’t be a mother.



His occasional, manageable outbursts of anger now cast a persistent shadow over our home. He didn’t hit me, at least not initially, but his words were like precise weapons. I was a defective product. Broken. A waste of his feelings. He often reminded me that any other man would have left me long ago, but he stayed and slept with me once a month. Didn't I understand how lucky I was? Shouldn't I be grateful?



Because I had never learned to say ""no,"" I agreed with him. Yes, I was lucky. Yes, I should be grateful. Yes, I would work harder to be the wife he deserved.



At his insistence, we moved to the countryside, to a large house at the end of a winding road, surrounded by dense woods that seemed to be closing in on me every day. It was secluded and quiet. In a place like this, even if I screamed, no one would hear me, although Matt was careful not to leave any trace in plain sight.



I found a remote accounting job, working in a small office upstairs, while Matt commuted to the city three days a week. On the days he came home, I walked on eggshells, carefully trying to gauge his emotions and preventing the increasingly frequent outbursts. If I failed—for example, if I overcooked dinner, forgot to pick up his dry cleaners, or simply did something that annoyed him—the consequences were always swift and certain.



A shove. A grab of my wrist, a slight twist. And another time, his hand gripped my neck, not forcefully, but tightly, a promise, a threat. And his voice was always so loud: “Emma, ​​if you leave me, I’ll find you. I’ll kill you. Do you understand?”



I said I understood. Because I was never good at refusing people’s requests.



It was a Tuesday in late October when Matt called. I was at my desk, reviewing a particularly tedious spreadsheet for a client, when my phone buzzed. His name appeared on the screen, and my stomach involuntarily tightened. For years, I’d never known whether his calls meant annoyance, anger, or rage; it had become a conditioned reflex.



“Emma.” His voice was strange. Not angry, not calm. There was an indescribable sharpness in it. “You have to come to the police station. Now.”



A series of possibilities flashed through my mind. Had something happened to him? Was he arrested? Was he injured? “What’s wrong? You—”



“They’ve found our daughter.” He interrupted me.



These words sounded nonsensical. I repeated them over and over in my mind, trying to put them in a meaningful order. Our daughter. We don’t have a daughter. We have no children. My deteriorating health, and Matt’s resentment because of it, was ample proof of that.



“Matt, I—”



“Come straight to the police station. The one on Mercer Street. Detective Holloway.”



Before I could respond, he hung up.



I sat there, phone still to my ear, silent for a long time. Then, I did what I always did: obey. I closed my laptop, grabbed my wallet, drove to the police station, my mind racing with impossible scenarios.



Maybe it was a mistake. Maybe someone else’s daughter had been found, and they’d mistakenly contacted Matt. Perhaps this was a meticulously designed test, another way for him to prove my incompetence. Perhaps I really had gone mad; years of suppressing my words and concealing my emotions had finally shattered the most fundamental things within me.



The police station was a low, brick building, seemingly built in the 1970s and never renovated. Inside, the fluorescent lights hummed overhead, and the air reeked of stale coffee and industrial cleaning agents. A bored officer at the front desk led me to a room at the end of the corridor.



Matt stood there, arms crossed, talking to a man I guessed was Detective Holloway. He was older, with gray hair and a weary face that bore the weariness of someone who had seen the ugliest aspects of humanity. A girl sat in a plastic chair against the wall.



She looked seven or eight. Black hair, pale skin, and large eyes that seemed somewhat disproportionate to her face. She wore a blue dress that looked expensive but was dirty, as if she had worn it for days. She looked directly at me, her eyes filled with such intense recognition that I held my breath.



“Mrs. Harrison,” Detective Holloway said, his voice professionally calm. “Thank you for coming. This morning, we found this young lady on Miller Road, about three miles from your house. She said her name is Lily Harrison, and you are her mother.”



The room tilted slightly. I gripped the edge of the table tightly to steady myself. “This can’t be. We don’t have a daughter.”



Matt’s hand suddenly landed on my shoulder, the pressure so sharp it hurt. “Emma’s been under a lot of stress lately,” he said calmly. “We’ve had two miscarriages; it’s been tough on her. Sometimes she gets confused.”



Before I could protest, his fingers dug deeper into my shoulder blade. It was a warning.



“Mommy,” the girl said. Her voice was clear and firm. “Don’t you remember me?”



I looked at her, really looked closely. There was no trace of familiarity on her face. I had never seen this child before. But her large, watery eyes stared directly at me, and I felt something deep inside me crumble. What if I was wrong? What if my memory was faulty? What if the trauma of the miscarriage had created some kind of rupture, leaving a blank in my memory?



“We need to get to the bottom of this,” Detective Holloway said. “This girl looks… she’s healthy, but she won’t tell us where she’s been or how she ended up here. She only asks about her parents, about the two of you.”



Matt’s voice was sweet and gentle. “We’ll take her home, of course. If she says she’s our daughter, then she must be. Right, Emma?”



His hand was still on my shoulder. What would happen if I said no, if I denied the child? What would Matt do to me in the dark, in that secluded house?



I looked at the girl, looked at Lily, and she smiled at me. It was a strange smile.



“Yes,” I heard myself say. “Of course. Let’s take her home.”



The drive home was silent. Lily sat in the back seat, her hands clasped on her knees, watching the trees rushing past the window with interest. Matt clenched his teeth, his knuckles white, gripping the steering wheel tightly. I sat frozen in the passenger seat, trying to recall everything that had just happened.



After the car pulled into the driveway, Matt finally spoke. “Don’t tell anyone about this. Understand?”



“I don’t understand—”



“You. Understand.?” Each word was like a knife, harsh and sharp.



“Understood,” I said.



After entering the house, Matt immediately went back to his office and closed the door. Lily and I, this difficult child, stood there in the hallway, at a loss.



“Would you like something to eat?” I finally asked.



She thought for a moment. “Okay, thank you.”



I led her to the kitchen and made her a sandwich. My hands mechanically repeated familiar movements, while my mind was a complete mess. She ate meticulously, her movements methodical, watching me the entire time. After finishing, she said, ""I'm tired.""



""Of course. You can sleep in the guest room. I'll get you some clean clothes.""



I found an old T-shirt, perfect for her petite frame as pajamas. She changed in the bathroom and came out looking younger, more fragile. But her eyes, those eyes, were still beautiful.



""Goodnight, mama,"" she said, climbing into the guest room bed.



""Goodnight, Lily.""



I closed the door, stood in the hallway, trembling. Then I went downstairs, poured myself a large glass of wine, and tried to think. But thinking became impossible. Every time I tried to understand what had happened, my thoughts drifted away, like trying to grasp water in my fist.



The next morning, I woke to find Lily standing by the bed, staring at me. Like some fledgling waiting to be fed, I sat bolt upright, gasping.



""I'm hungry,"" she said simply.



I made breakfast—pancakes with syrup—and she seemed to enjoy it. Matt went downstairs, poured coffee, and then went to work without a word. After his car drove away, I felt a sense of relief in my chest.



“So,” I said to Lily, sitting across from her at the kitchen table, “tell me about yourself.”



She tilted her head like a bird. “What do you want to know?”



“Everything. Where you’ve been. You…how you became like this.”



“I’ve been waiting,” she said. “Now I’m finally here. With you.”



“But I don’t remember…”



“That’s okay. You’ll remember eventually. Or you never will. It doesn’t matter.”



Her words puzzled me, but I found myself unable to press her further. It was as if something in my head refused to break through this wall.



Later that morning, Detective Hollo called. He said the child protective agency thought Lily needed a checkup. Just a routine checkup to make sure she was healthy. I agreed and took her to see a doctor, a kind old gentleman named Peter, who examined her carefully.



“Everything looks fine,” he said afterwards. “No signs of abuse or malnutrition. She’s a little thin, but nothing serious. I suggest she stay home for a few months, away from school for now. Let her adjust and regain her strength. Maintain a regular diet and rest.”



I nodded, accepting the arrangement, just as I accepted everything else. Everyone assumed we had a daughter who had been missing for who knows how many years—the police said three, then the child protection agency said five, and one teacher insisted she had seen her a year ago.



But back home, I realized I had absolutely no idea how to care for a child for two months. I rarely had any contact with children before. I always thought Charlotte’s children were only brought out for holiday photoshoots, otherwise cared for by nannies. My maternal instincts, if they existed, had vanished along with my fertility.



But Lily made things much easier for me. She was full of curiosity. She always followed me around the house, constantly asking questions. ""What's this?"" she'd ask, pointing to the antique clock in the hallway, or the one Matt insisted on buying  strange painting, or perhaps that basement door I never had the key to, asked me, ""What is this?""



A few days later, I set up a makeshift classroom in the sunroom. If I was going to homeschool her, I had to take it seriously. I ordered textbooks online, printed out worksheets, and created a timetable. This gave me something to focus on besides worrying about whether she even existed.



""Let's start with science,"" I said on the first morning, opening a workbook suitable for second graders.



But Lily's questions quickly revealed that the standard curriculum was completely inadequate for her. She asked me what parents were, not what they did or how they did it. Their words and actions were important, but what were they essentially? The true meaning of parenthood.



""Well,"" I said slowly, ""parents are the ones who created you. They brought you into this world and cared for you as you grew.""



""Are you my parents?""



""I..."" I hesitated. Am I? In what sense? I didn't give birth to her. Even three days ago, I had no memory of her existence. But she's sitting in my house now, calling me Mom, and I'm teaching her fractions. ""Yes, I think I am.""



She nodded contentedly. ""And the other one? Matt?""



I noticed she never called him Dad or Father. Just Matt, and sometimes ""the other one.""



""He's your parent too.""



""Really?"" I almost laughed out loud at the skepticism in her voice.



Our lessons became a little strange. I taught her multiplication, which she grasped quickly, and then she'd ask me about the concept of change. Not physical change—she understood chemistry better than I did—but metaphysical change. What happens when something becomes something else? Is it still the same thing? If a caterpillar becomes a butterfly, which one is real?



We did experiments. I taught her to mix vinegar and baking soda to make a volcano model. She asked if we could try other combinations. Soon, the sunroom was filled with beakers and test tubes I'd ordered online. We made our own pH indicator from red cabbage. We extracted strawberry seeds from strawberries to cultivate. We built a model train from scratch. She not only made me explain how the motor works, but also why humans would want to move from one place to another.



These were some of the happiest times of my life in years. Lily was always so captivating; her mind was sharp and peculiar, switching freely between the concrete and the abstract. She seemed tireless and never complained. She absorbed information like a sponge, then posed questions that made me rethink everything I thought I understood.



Matt basically ignored us, treating us like air. He'd go home, have dinner, and then go back to his office. Sometimes I'd see him looking at Lily with a look I couldn't decipher—definitely not love, but not hostility either. Perhaps it was wariness. As if she were a puzzle he couldn't solve.



These two months went by faster than I expected. I felt a pang of loss when the doctors and other organizations allowed Lily to return to school. The house would be empty again. I'd have to face my spreadsheets, my thoughts, and my fear of Matt's emotions alone again.



""Do I have to go?"" Lily asked the night before school started. “This is important,” I said. “You need to be with other kids. To learn social skills, to make friends.”



“I prefer studying with you.”



“I do too,” I admitted. “But this is the best option.”



She accepted it without objection. I noticed that she almost always silently accepted everything. Not because she was passive, but because she seemed to understand that certain forms had to be followed, certain rituals had to be completed.



School turned out to be an unexpected enlightenment for Lily. She came home every day with new information unrelated to the formal curriculum. She learned about different family structures. She learned that some children had two fathers, two mothers, some had only one parent, and some had divorced parents. She learned that fathers could be gentle and caring, not cold and irritable.



“Sarah’s dad is her soccer coach,” she told me thoughtfully one evening, “and Mia’s dad makes her pancakes every Sunday with fruit shaped into various faces. Does Matt make those too?”



I felt a tightness in my chest. “He…he’s done his best, Lily.”



“Really?”



It was a simple question, yet it felt like a hidden door had opened beneath my feet.



About six months later, Matt’s tolerance for Lily began to wane. His initial wariness gradually turned into annoyance. She was too quiet, he said; the next day he said she was too noisy. She left her shoes in the hallway. Her breathing was too loud at meals. The criticisms were endless and baseless, something I’d long since grown accustomed to.



One evening, he yelled at Lily because she’d used the wrong cup—apparently his, even though there had never been such a rule between them, or in our house. Lily just stared straight at him, unblinking, and said, “I don’t know. I’ll get a different one next time.”



Her calmness seemed to infuriate him even more. “You’re not allowed to talk back!”



“I didn’t, talking back means…”



He raised his hand. Without thinking, I stepped between them. “Matt, don’t be like that. She didn’t mean any….”



He was furious, his face turning purple, the veins in his neck bulging. In that moment, I thought he was going to hit us both. Then he lowered his hand, turned, and slammed out of the house. I heard his car roar off the driveway.



Lily gently touched my arm. “Thank you, mama.”



That night, after Lily went to sleep, I sat in the dark living room, trying to recall how I had gotten to where I was. But life before Lily came into my life felt distant.



A few weeks later, Lily asked a question that would change everything.



We were in the kitchen. I was making dinner, and she was doing her homework at the table. Matt would be home in an hour. The tension of his impending return made me tremble, my shoulders tense, and my hands clumsy.



“Mom,” Lily said without looking up, her eyes still fixed on her math worksheet, “can parents be replaced?”



I froze, a knife hovering over the cutting board. “What do you mean?”



“In school, we learned about divorce. After parents separate, the child lives with one of them. Sometimes the child gets new parents. Stepparents. Can that happen?”



I carefully put down the knife. “Yes. But it’s complicated.”



“Will that happen in our family?”



The question hung in the air. I should say no immediately. I should explain that Matt would never allow it, and the consequences would be dire. But I was too tired. So very tired. The thought of life without him, without his anger, threats, and meticulously planned cruelty, was intoxicating.



“If parents divorce,” I said slowly, choosing my words carefully, “there will be custody arrangements. The court will decide where the child lives and when visitation rights are granted. It depends on many factors.”



“What if one parent is bad? What if one parent has hurt someone else?”



My hands trembled, pressing tightly against the chicken I was cutting. “Then the court will try its best to protect the child. But it’s not always that simple. Sometimes, parents who hurt others will say they won’t hurt anyone again. Sometimes their words are very convincing. Sometimes…” I stopped, unable to continue.



“Sometimes what?”



“Sometimes, the parents who have been hurt are too scared to leave.”



Lily put down her pencil and looked at me with her innocent eyes. “Mommy, are you scared?”



I couldn’t lie to her. I couldn’t deceive myself anymore. “Yes.”



She nodded slowly, as if confirming something she already knew. “Do you want to leave? If you’re not scared?”



This was the first time someone had asked me what I wanted. Not what I should do, not what was appropriate, not what others expected of me. Just what I wanted.



“Yes,” I whispered. “God help me, yes.”



Lily continued with her homework, as if we had only been discussing the weather. But the atmosphere in the room seemed to have changed, some fundamental shift in reality that I couldn’t comprehend.



That evening, after dinner, Lily asked Matt if she could see a jigsaw puzzle she'd been working on. It was a complex three-dimensional puzzle, with pieces connected in seemingly impossible ways. She'd been racking her brains over it for weeks.



“I finally solved it!” she exclaimed excitedly, her voice still childlike. “Can I show it to you?”



Matt was in a good mood. He'd just closed a big deal, had a few bourbons, and was now in high spirits and unusually magnanimous. “Of course, son. Let me see.”



She led him to the sunroom. I followed, and for some reason, I felt a pang of guilt that they should be alone for even a moment. She showed him the puzzle and explained how she'd solved it. He nodded, unusually interested.



“Very clever,” he said.



Lily gave him a bright smile. Then, she deliberately knocked the puzzle to the floor, scattering pieces everywhere.



Matt's face instantly changed. The good mood brought on by the alcohol vanished, replaced by a chilling rage. “What’s wrong with you?”



“It was an accident,” Lily said, but her tone sounded neither sad nor apologetic. She sounded curious, as if conducting an experiment.



He lunged forward, raising his hands. I grabbed his arm. “Matt, stop! She didn’t mean to—”



He yanked me away, and I stumbled.



“Never mind that,” he said fiercely.



But he didn’t hit her. Something on her face, perhaps that calm, scrutinizing look, made him stop. He lowered his hands and walked out, panting.



Later, after I had put Lily to sleep, I sat on the edge of the bed. “You did it on purpose.”



“Yes.”



“Why?”



“I wanted to see what he would do.”



“Lily, that was dangerous. He could have hurt you.”



“But he didn’t. He wanted to hit me, but he didn’t. Why?”



I thought about it. “I don’t know. Maybe it’s because you were a child. Maybe it’s because I was there. Maybe it was just luck.”



She nodded, seemingly processing my words. “Mom, if you could change all of this. If you could make Matt disappear, would you?”



The question terrified me because the answer was direct and certain. “Yes.”



“Even if it means doing something bad?”



I should say no. I should explain the moral, ethical, and legal consequences to her. But I was too tired, years of fear and compliance suffocating me, and I just wanted it all to end.



“I don’t know,” I said honestly. “But you shouldn’t do it.”



She reached out and took my hand. Her fingers were cold. “What if I asked a friend for help? What if my friend could change him?”



I should say no. Everything inside me screamed rejection, wanted to end this conversation, wanted to realize the danger in her words. But I had never been so used to refusing requests. This pattern was deeply ingrained, a habit etched into my bones over decades.



“Lily—”



“Will you stop me?”



I looked at this strange child who had suddenly appeared in my life. Her question seemed to defy reality. She looked at me with an expression I couldn't understand. I realized I was more afraid of disappointing her than of the consequences.



“No,” I whispered. “I don’t actually know how to …”



She smiled. It was a warm, loving smile. In that moment, she seemed like an ordinary child, happy that something she wanted had been allowed.



“Thank you, Mom. It’ll be alright soon, I promise.”



She quickly fell asleep, her breathing deep and even. I sat there for a long time, watching her, wondering what I had just done. Finally, I went back to my room. Matt was already in bed, his back to me, snoring softly. I lay down beside him, staring at the ceiling, waiting to see what would happen next.



On Tuesday, Matt didn't come home from work.



At first, I thought he was just working overtime, or that he sometimes had a few drinks with colleagues, but he usually texted me. By seven o'clock, I started to worry, so I called his cell phone. It went straight to voicemail.



At nine o'clock, I called his office. The security guard who answered said Matt had left around 5:30 as usual. I called his brother Daniel, who said he hadn't been able to contact Matt for weeks.



At eleven o'clock, I called the police.



The officer who answered sounded impatient. He said it was common for adult men to go missing. They usually reappear within forty-eight hours. Had we had a fight? Did he just need some personal space?



""No,"" I said, which was the truth. We hadn't really fought lately. Matt was ……barely speaking to me these days, which somehow better than a fight.



""I'll open a case,"" the officer said. ""If you get in touch with him, call us.""



I hung up and found Lily standing in the living room doorway, watching me.



""He's not coming back,"" she said.



My stomach clenched. “How did you know?”



“I asked a friend for help. Like I promised.”



I slumped heavily onto the sofa. From the moment Matt’s car didn’t pull into the driveway as usual, I had a feeling this would happen. But knowing and accepting are two different things.



“Where is he?”



Lily came over and sat on the sofa beside me. She took my hands in hers, and I was touched again by her cold skin.



“He went somewhere, where he can’t hurt anyone anymore. A place more suitable for him than here. That’s all you need to know.”



“Lily, if you, or anyone, hurt him, we have to call the police.”



“No one hurt him, Mom. He just… changed. Like a caterpillar turning into a butterfly, remember? We talked about that. Things can completely change. He’s not Matt anymore. He’s become something else.something doesn’t remember you, doesn’t remember me, and doesn’t remember this house.”



I wanted to press for details, to understand what she meant. But there seemed to be a hint of impatience in her tone, as if she didn’t want to tell me the answer. Some knowledge was too heavy for me to bear.



“You promised you wouldn’t do it,” I said weakly.



“No, I didn’t. You asked if I would tell you if I planned to do something, and I did. I asked if you would stop me from getting help, and you said no. I kept my promise.”



She was right, of course. The logic was flawless. My silence, my powerless refusal, was tantamount to acquiescence.



“The police will investigate. They will find him.”



“They will look. They won’t find anything. They won’t find anything at all.”



“Lily, I need you to promise me one thing.”



She waited.



“Never do this again. Never… change anyone. For whatever reason. ok?”



She gazed at my face for a long time. Then she nodded. “I promise you, Mom. Only for you. Because you made me do this.



The investigation into Matt’s disappearance was perfunctory.  Holloway, the one who was at the police station the day Lily appeared. He came to my house twice  He asked a few questions about our marriage, Matt's habits, and whether I had noticed anything unusual in the weeks before his disappearance.



I answered all the questions truthfully. Yes, our marriage was indeed in trouble. No, Matt hadn't seemed any different lately. No, I didn't know where he went.



""Is it possible he committed suicide?"" Holloway asked softly.



To be honest, I hadn't even thought about that. ""I...I don't know. Maybe.""



""We found his abandoned car in the state forest about sixty miles from here. There were no signs of murder. There was no evidence he met with anyone. It's as if he just left and moved on.""



""Will police continue the search?""



Holloway sighed. ""We'll do our best, Mrs. Harrison. But there's no evidence of a crime, and our resources are limited. I'm sorry."" ""



After he left, Lily and I sat in the kitchen. She was drawing,  intricate geometric patterns that seemed to change when I didn't look at them directly.



She finally looked up, and in the drawing, I saw something vast, strange, and incredibly ancient. It should have terrified me. Perhaps it had. But I didn't, so we spent the whole afternoon playing with coloring books.





Weeks passed. Matt's disappearance briefly made the local news, then vanished. His family was initially agitated; his mother called several times, her tone sharp and accusatory, as if I had orchestrated his disappearance. But the police found nothing. No     body. No signs of violence. No clues. Eventually, even his mother's calls stopped.





Charlotte contacted me once; her message was brief and perfunctory. 'I'm sorry to hear about Matt. Let me know if you need anything.'"" I didn't reply.



Life became unusually quiet. I continued my accounting work. Lily went to school. We cooked dinner together, helped her with her homework, cuddled on the sofa watching movies. She joined the soccer team, losing more often than winning. She went to a friend's house and spent the night in her pajamas with some friends, but crying to me to pick her up at midnight.



 I took her to see a therapist a few times.They all said she was under too much pressure and was imagining friends to cope, or that she simply had her own system of logic. In short, they all agreed that Matt might just have disappeared. We did a few more family therapy sessions to ease the pressure on both of us.



But I couldn't escape what had happened. I couldn't escape what I had allowed to happen. In quiet moments, usually late at night after Lily had fallen asleep, I would think of Matt. Not the man who hurt me, but the man I dated and used love . I would wonder where Lily's ""friends"" had taken him, whether he had suffered, whether he was still conscious, whether he understood what he had become.



And, am I a... A murderer.



Because I am a murderer, aren't I? Even though I didn't do it myself, even though I didn't understand why he disappeared, I condoned it all. I should have said ""No, Lily,"" and spent half an hour explaining to her why it was wrong. For the first time in my life, this acquiescence had irreversible consequences.



One evening, about three months after Matt disappeared, I found Lily in the sunroom. She was looking out at the woods, her face pressed against the glass. The setting sun painted the sky a vibrant orange-purple, almost unreal.



""I don't know what to do,"" I confessed. But at that moment, I wasn't sure if I meant the spreadsheets that had been bothering me for a week, or Matt.



Lily came to me and wrapped her little arms around my waist. I hugged her, this incredible child, her body pressed against mine, cold and icy, yet her embrace was incredibly tender.



""You don't have to do anything,"" her voice muffled against my stomach. ""Just stay here, Mommy."" I try not to think about it, but I still don't know how to say ""no.""



I'll never know what to do.

Honestly some concepts are fun and engaging. Love the idea of spline and EM algorithm, but that's more on the concepts themselves.

Unfortunately fullly loaded by Bayesian stats and capstone this semester so less time for studying this subject (the lesson on choosing your electives wisely). Some formulae (backward propagation, somewhere in the notes on linear model, the formula on bootstrap looks suspcious as well but i'm not sure) in lecture notes are wrong and the notations of spline parameters are awful (someone please make beta\_{ki} always be for elements in a matrix), The EM algorithm & backward propagation parts probably can be more concise. Ridge regression or variations of this appears almost everywhere related to linear models (well, this one is important, indeed). Asked qwen to explain stuffs for me all the time during reviewing and sure that's a better instructor/tutor than anyone else. Really hope that stuffs like network pruning won't be on the exam tomorrow. getting its derivative would be a pain

Not sure if I'll use a coffee nap tonight just to connect everythin into one picture though the exam is in early afternoon. Probably need one given such heavy contents in this subject.",3,1762770611.0,unimelb,4,1.0,False

Wild hybrid 10x scent samples.)","Ive been interested in perfume for a couple months but have stuck entirely to mainstream perfume houses (my fav at the moment is penhaligon ), however in most of my other hobbies (clothes, embroidery, interior design, art), I always follow indie creators and small businesses. then one day I thought to myself "" I wonder if there's indie perfume houses"". a few google searches later, I found this sub reddit, completely fell down the rabbit whole and now ive spend way to much money on a first order of indie perfumes. I figured since ive enjoyed stalking other peoples reviews why not spend way too much time making a way over structured review of my own :) I hope you enjoy.

**note: I will be updating  this post daily with reviews for the perfume of the day, so if there are blank spots on this post, that's way. please stay tuned :)**

**THE PLAN:**

**-** I have ordered 28 scents from alkemia and wild hybrid, once they arrived I let them sit for a week in a dark temp controlled place.                                                                                                    **-** Each day a wear one perfume for the whole day and give thoughts on the scent, straight from the bottle, wet on skin, dry on skin, and throughout the day.

# ALKEMIA:

# monthly alchemy; ghost story alchemy

**\~scent description:** October - Ghost Story Alchemy: A mysterious leather-bound storybook and a midnight snack of ginger-spiced cookies summon a glowing pumpkin from a headless horseman, looming shadows, forested woods, ritual incenses, a dropped pouch of tobacco, and scattered botanicals of protection – angelica root, juniper, and lavender.

**\~In bottle:** has a cheep incense smell with a more pleasant undertone of nutmeg and cinnamon spices.

**\~Wet on skin:** lush bath bomb, literally that's all I can smell. it's like I walked into the lush bath bomb section, just soapy with a very non descriptive floral spice trying to fight its way through the soap. so not a grate start, and is defiantly making me a bit nervous for the rest of them, but since the rest of the are apart of the permanent collection im hoping there a bit better.

**\~Dry on skin:** still very soapy, and still giving this particular scent that I only ever smell at lush, I'm not quit sure exactly what it is( reminds me quite a bit of their karma soap my mother used when I was little). its not bad, its a nice enough smell, lush is popular for a reason after all, however its defiantly not what I want to smell like myself. the throw isn't bad about what I was expecting from reading other peoples experience with perfume oils vs alcohol sprays. I'm hoping the soapy smell calms down throughout the day.

**\~Midday:** this faded dramatically, the soapiness calmed down,... but so did everything else. within about an hour I had to practically snort my wrist to smell it at all. 2/3 hours later an I just couldn't, my arm didn't smell quite like my plain skin but there was also no distinct scent.

**\~Final thoughts:**  ok so here's the thing, this was a freebie, which is very nice and I love that they do that, and as such I don't want to complain too much. I think that my main issue with this perfume was the strong soapiness that turned the other notes is to an indistinctive floral spiciness, witch could just be down to how the perfume reacts with my skin in particular. I've never experienced this before but as I've mentioned, im used to main stream alcohol sprays, which don't react as much with the skin. I just pray that the other scents don't go soapy on me.

There’s something about Pondicherry that slows down time — the golden light on French walls, the sound of waves breaking softly against Rock Beach, the smell of coffee drifting through bougainvillea-lined streets.

It’s not just a destination; it’s a mood.  
 For couples, Pondy is the perfect blend of intimacy and adventure — long walks, secret courtyards, candlelit dinners, and sunrises worth waking up early for.

Here’s your complete **Couple’s Guide to a Romantic Pondicherry Getaway**, handpicked by locals who know where the real magic hides.

# 1. Stay in Style: Boutique Stays & Heritage Havens

**The Best Couple Resorts and Hotels in Pondicherry.**

If romance had an address, it would be painted pastel.  
 Pondicherry’s boutique stays turn ordinary weekends into love stories. Whether you’re after luxury or something simple and quiet, here are our favorites:

 **La Villa:** A restored 19th-century mansion in White Town with private courtyards and soft jazz playing over dinner.  
 **Palais de Mahe (CGH Earth):** Heritage luxury meets poolside calm — perfect for lazy afternoons and spa sessions.  
 **Gratitude Heritage Home:** For couples who love nostalgia, candlelight, and a soulful silence that feels like home.  
 **Le Pondy Resort:** Sea-facing cottages just outside town — where the sound of waves replaces your alarm clock.

 *Local Tip:* Book weekdays — you’ll get lower rates and quieter stays without the weekend rush.





# 2. Romantic Cafés & Dinner Spots

**Where Conversations Taste Sweeter.**

From croissants to candlelight, Pondicherry’s cafés and restaurants have romance built into their walls.

 **Coromandel Café:** A fairytale courtyard with greenery, soft lights, and wine glasses clinking under the stars.  
 **Villa Helena:** French charm, Mediterranean flavors, and a dreamy garden perfect for date nights.  
 **Bayroot Bistro (Promenade):** Rooftop dining with sea breeze and live music — order their grilled prawns with white wine.  
 **Bread & Chocolate (Auroville):** For cozy brunches — flaky pastries, espresso, and slow morning laughter.

 *Local Tip:* Reserve tables in advance on weekends — especially outdoor seating for that perfect sunset glow.





# 3. Beach Moments for Two

**Long Walks and Quiet Conversations by the Sea.**

Forget Goa crowds — Pondy beaches are more about connection than chaos.

**Rock Beach:** Ideal for evening walks, sea-facing benches, and slow-motion sunsets.  
**Paradise Beach:** Take the ferry from Chunnambar for a quiet stretch of golden sand and blue horizons.  
**Serenity Beach:** For adventurous couples — rent a surfboard or just watch surfers ride the waves.  
**Pondy Marina Beach Food Court:** Grab coffee or fried prawns and watch the moon rise behind Promenade Hotel.

 *Local Tip:* Early mornings (6–8 AM) are magical — fewer people, golden skies, and time that feels still.



# 4. Hidden Experiences for Intimate Escapes

**Because Romance Thrives in the Unexpected.**

Pondicherry’s magic lies beyond the obvious — in the experiences that make you feel like locals.

 **Cycle through White Town:** Rent vintage-style bicycles and ride through quiet French lanes at dawn.  
  **Evening Meditation at Auroville:** Sit in silence at the Matrimandir viewpoint — spirituality meets intimacy.  
 **Couple Pottery Session at Auroville Art Studio:** Hands in clay, laughter in air — a different kind of connection.  
 **Private Movie Night at Le Dupleix Courtyard:** Some boutique hotels host private screenings with candlelight and cocktails.

 *Local Tip:* Auroville also hosts pop-up flea markets — perfect for picking little souvenirs for each other.



# 5. Best Sunset & Sunrise Spots

**For the Couple Who Loves the Sky.**

 **Promenade Sunrise Point:** The classic — first light over the Bay of Bengal. Bring coffee, not your phone.  
 **Serenity Beach Cliff Point:** Hidden behind surf schools — ideal for evening golden light photos.  
 **Chunnambar Bridge:** Watch the sun dip over the backwaters with boats drifting by.  
 **Promenade Hotel Backside Beach Court:** A quiet spot for night walks, lit by the sea and street lamps.

*Pro Tip:* Carry a picnic mat and snacks — sunsets taste better unplanned.



# 6. Couple Travel Tips

  **Rent a scooter:** It’s the most romantic way to explore side streets and Auroville trails.  
  **Golden hour = 5:30–6:30 PM:** That’s when the French Quarter glows for couple portraits.  
  **Avoid tourist traps:** Skip random “boat tours” or “Ashram specials” — check ExplorePondy first!  
  **Disconnect to connect:** Leave your phone behind when walking by the sea.



# 7. Conclusion – Love, Pondy Style

Romance in Pondicherry isn’t about grand gestures — it’s in the little things.  
 It’s sharing a coffee while rain hits the French tiles. It’s the silence between words on Rock Beach. It’s how time seems to pause when you look at each other in the soft, golden light.

Whether you’re newly in love or celebrating years together, Pondicherry gives you space — to slow down, to talk, and to simply *be*.

Because love doesn’t need luxury — it just needs the right backdrop.  
 And here, that backdrop is Pondicherry. 🌺

1otab38,https://www.reddit.com/r/RnRemoteJobs/comments/1otab38/how_to_become_a_work_from_home_rn_without_burning/,How to Become a Work From Home RN Without Burning Out (or Getting Lost in Job Boards),"https://preview.redd.it/z0qt1algpe0g1.png?width=2240&format=png&auto=webp&s=53260e7b694d8d63415700891d7f4a4845c044e4

If you’ve ever finished a double shift, kicked off your clogs, and thought, “There has to be a calmer way to use my license,” you’re not alone. Plenty of nurses are stepping into remote roles—not because they’ve fallen out of love with patient care, but because they want their bodies (and schedules) to stop feeling like a tug-of-war. The Work From Home RN path isn’t a shortcut. It’s a different map. And, frankly, a good one if you’re ready to blend clinical judgment with digital tools and a healthy dose of self-management.

Let’s be real: the internet is swamped with vague promises about “easy side hustles.” That’s not this. This is for nurses who want legitimate, credential-aligned work with income stability, growth, and the option to do school pick-ups in between chart reviews. We’ll walk through the exact types of [Work From Home RN jobs](https://workfromhomern.com/blog/work-from-home-rn-a-practical-real-world-guide-to-high-pay-remote-nursing/), how to translate bedside skills for remote hiring managers, what software you’ll actually use, how to build a remote-proof résumé, plus a few pitfalls (and how to dodge them). And yes—we’ll drop in clear steps to move from curiosity to contract.

By the end, you’ll know whether the Work From Home RN route makes sense for you—and how to land a role without spinning in circles on job boards.

# Why the Work From Home RN Path Is More Than a Trend

There’s a quiet shift happening. Healthcare organizations are facing staff shortages, documentation requirements keep expanding, and virtual care keeps growing up—from “experimental” to normal. That combo has created real, recurring demand for nurses in remote roles: triage, utilization management, case management, quality review, informatics, CDI, prior authorization, clinical education, telehealth, and more. These aren’t “nice to have” seats; they’re operationally essential.

Is every Work From Home RN job the same? Not even close. Some feel like fast-paced triage lines; others are thoughtful, methodical reviews of cases with tight criteria. Some jobs are 100% remote, some hybrid, and a few require occasional on-site training or equipment pickup. But the point stands: there’s room here for multiple personalities and clinical backgrounds.

If you want a quick skim, here’s the short version:

* Remote nursing is real, varied, and increasingly permanent.
* Your bedside experience is a superpower, not a barrier.
* The best jobs go to RNs who translate that experience into business results (accuracy, time savings, patient outcomes).

If that sounds like you, the [**Work From Home RN**](https://WorkFromHomeRN.com) path is worth exploring.

# The Roles: What Work From Home RN Jobs Actually Look Like

You know how job descriptions can read like they were written by a robot? Let’s skip that. Here’s what you’ll actually do in the most common Work From Home RN roles, including what makes a hiring manager think, “We need this person.”

# Triage Nurse (Telehealth)

* **What you do:** Assess symptoms via phone/video, follow protocols, escalate when needed, document cleanly.

Each of these can be a **Work From Home RN** role. The trick is showing—not just saying—that your bedside stories translate into numbers that matter to the business.



# Translating Bedside Skills for Remote Hiring Managers

Here’s the little secret: hiring managers believe you can care; they’re unsure you can communicate high signal in low time. That’s the remote gap. Prove that you can:

1. **Triage signal from noise.** “Handled 30+ calls/shift; identified red-flag cases in under 90 seconds.”
2. **Write like a clinician who respects the clock.** Crisp, precise, defensible notes.
3. **Navigate criteria.** “InterQual/MCG proficient; 95% first-pass accuracy.”
4. **Handle tools.** Zoom, Teams, Epic/Cerner, Salesforce, payer portals—whatever the stack, demonstrate that you pick it up fast.
5. **Self-manage without hand-holding.** Results without a manager hovering nearby.

If you can show those five in your résumé, cover letter, and interview examples, you’re already ahead.

# The Remote Stack: Tools You’ll Actually Touch

* **Meetings & Chats:** Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Slack.
* **Docs & Tracking:** Excel/Sheets, Word/Docs, project boards (Asana, Trello, Jira).
* **EHR/Portals:** Epic, Cerner, Allscripts, Athena, payer systems.
* **Knowledge Bases:** Confluence, SharePoint, internal SOP hubs.
* **Hardware:** Company laptop, VPN, dual monitors (highly recommended), noise-canceling headset, reliable router.

If your last tech win was getting a finicky glucometer to sync, don’t stress. You can learn this stack in a weekend. What matters most is speed, accuracy, and clean communication.

# How to Build a Remote-Proof RN Résumé (That Doesn’t Read Like Every Other RN Résumé)

**Top third = your hook.**

* “Registered Nurse (BSN), 6 years ED/stepdown. Telehealth triage, UM/UR, InterQual. Reduced callback volume 12%. Dual-monitor productivity pro.”

**Bullet formula:**

* **Action + Scope + Metric + Tool.**
* “Reviewed 45 cases/week using InterQual; improved first-pass approvals by 17% while collaborating via Teams with 6 cross-functional reviewers.”

**Add a Remote Readiness block:**

* “Remote Setup: Dual 27” monitors, wired Ethernet, VPN, EHR experience (Epic), call-quality 98%+.”
* “Time Management: Ticket queue triage, SLA tracking, batch documentation.”

**Show your stories, not just your skills.**

* Two or three tight STAR examples (Situation, Task, Action, Result) that prove judgment and productivity.

And yes—link to a clean, one-page portfolio PDF if you have it. A small professional touch goes a long way.



# The Search Strategy: Where Work From Home RN Roles Hide (and How to Get Found)

You can brute-force applications, or you can play smart. Smart wins more interviews with less burnout.

1. **Narrow by function first, not title.** Search “utilization review,” “telehealth triage,” “clinical reviewer,” “prior authorization,” “CDI,” “RN case manager remote.” Titles vary wildly.
2. **Create two résumés.** One tuned for triage/telehealth. Another tuned for UM/UR/PA/CDI.
3. **Track your pipeline.** Simple spreadsheet: company, role, applied date, follow-up date, status, notes. This keeps you from losing good leads.
4. **Referrals.** A 10-minute LinkedIn message to a current employee (“Loved your post about the UM team’s workflow; applied to Req #123. Any advice?”) beats cold applying into a black hole.
5. **Interview like a colleague, not a candidate.** Speak the manager’s metrics: accuracy, throughput, compliance, patient outcomes, audit readiness.

When you’re ready to jump from research to action, the [**Work From Home RN**](https://WorkFromHomeRN.com) hub can be a smart place to explore paths, compare roles, and see what aligns with your background.

# Money Talk: Pay, Benefits, and What’s Realistic

Let’s be honest: bedside overtime can spike your checks. Remote pay isn’t a magic fountain; it’s solid and predictable. Some roles pay hourly with overtime; others are salary with bonus or per-case incentives. The range varies by region, experience, and company, but many Work From Home RN roles sit in a healthy, sustainable middle—without the physical toll of turning patients at 4 a.m.

Three realities:

* **You won’t miss the commute.** That alone can feel like a raise.
* **Benefits can be strong.** Insurance, PTO, 401k, equipment stipends show up frequently.
* **Your ceiling grows with specialization.** Criteria mastery (InterQual/MCG), informatics, or high-demand niches (cardio/oncology) can push pay higher.



# Daily Life: What a Work From Home RN Day Actually Feels Like

Picture this: You sign on at 7:55 a.m. Coffee is not optional. You scan your queue—new triage calls flagged, five prior auths pending, two provider callbacks. By 8:10 you’ve handled a red-flag abdominal pain call (warm handoff to ED), documented cleanly, and moved to the prior authorization that looks borderline. You pull criteria, compare clinical notes, and write a clear, defensible rationale. It’s not noisy. It’s focused.

Is it slower than bedside? Not exactly—just different muscles. Less sprinting, more steady tempo. The biggest shift is self-management. You’re the boss of your time, which can be liberating or tricky. A timer app helps. So does standing up every 60–90 minutes. Remote nursing is a marathon of attention, not a dash.



# Common Missteps (and How to Dodge Them)

* **Keyword soup résumés.** Stuffing every acronym looks desperate. Curate.
* **Vague bullet points.** “Responsible for…” won’t get you hired. “Reduced denials by 9% via criteria alignment” will.
* **Interview drift.** Answer in frameworks. Situation → Action → Result. Keep it tight.
* **Tech indifference.** Test your mic, webcam, VPN, and internet speed before interviews.
* **Ignoring your environment.** Chair, monitor height, lighting. Your body will thank you later.

# Your 7-Day Sprint to Land a Work From Home RN Interview

**Day 1:** Pick two target roles (e.g., UM/UR and Telehealth). Write two tailored résumés.  
**Day 2:** Draft a short, personal cover letter template you can tweak fast.  
**Day 3:** Update LinkedIn with a headline like “RN | Utilization Review | InterQual | Telehealth Triage | Remote-Ready.”  
**Day 4:** Apply to five roles that truly fit. Start a tracker.  
**Day 5:** Send three referral messages. Short, respectful, specific.  
**Day 6:** Practice two STAR stories out loud. Record yourself. Fix your rambling.  
**Day 7:** Follow up on applications, refine the tracker, and prep questions that show you think like an insider:

* “How does the team measure accuracy and throughput?”
* “What does a strong first 90 days look like here?”
* “Which criteria are most used—InterQual, MCG, or both?”

# The Clinical Edge: Why Bedside Experience Still Wins Remote Roles

People assume going remote means “less clinical.” Not necessarily. In triage, your pattern recognition is the safety net. In UM/UR and prior auth, your clinical precision stops bad denials. In CDI, your understanding of acuity turns into the right codes—real dollars for the facility and accurate patient records. That lived bedside context is the thing AI can’t fake: the way a voice on the phone changes when pain goes from a 5 to an 8, or how a small BP trend suddenly matters when you add comorbidities.

This is why the **Work From Home RN** route values you. You’re not leaving nursing. You’re evolving it.

# Setting Up Your Home Base (So You Don’t Dread Sitting Down)

* **Two monitors.** You’ll review criteria on one, chart on the other. Saves your neck—literally.
* **Wired internet.** Wi-Fi drops at the wrong moment are both awkward and risky.
* **Quiet mic.** A good headset buys you credibility in every call.
* **Lighting.** If you’re on video, put light in front of you, not behind.
* **Chair and keyboard.** Your back will write you a thank-you note.

# Subtle Power Moves for Remote Success

* **Block your calendar.** Deep work needs walls. Put two 45-minute focus blocks in your day.
* **Write for scanners.** Short paragraphs, clear headers, bold the key phrase in internal updates.
* **Keep a personal SOP.** When X happens, you do Y. Fewer decisions = more energy.
* **Close loops.** If you can’t finish something, write the next step and the owner. Future-you will be grateful.
* **Document wins.** Keep a “brag file” (metrics, thank-yous, improvements). This turns into promotion ammo later.



# Is the Work From Home RN Path Right for You?

Ask yourself:

* Do I enjoy precise, defensible writing?
* Am I okay with less adrenaline and more structure?
* Can I manage my time without someone watching?
* Do I like patterns, criteria, and solving repeatable problems?
* Will I invest a weekend to learn tools that make me faster?

If yes to most, you’ll likely thrive. If you need the buzz of a busy ED to feel alive, you might keep remote as a partial option (PRN telehealth or weekend UM) while staying bedside.

When you’re ready to explore—and compare paths that fit your background—the [**Work From Home RN**](https://WorkFromHomeRN.com) guide is a clean next step.



# FAQ: Work From Home RN (Straight Answers, No Fluff)

**Q1: Do I need special certifications to become a Work From Home RN?**  
Not always. Many roles hire experienced RNs and train on criteria/tools. For CDI, coding knowledge helps; for case management, CCM is respected; for informatics, any EHR super-user or project experience helps.

**Q2: Will I earn less than bedside?**  
Sometimes, especially if your bedside income relies on heavy overtime. However, remote roles often offer stable pay, strong benefits, and zero commute—with a better quality of life.

**Q3: Which remote roles are easiest to transition into?**  
Telehealth triage and UM/UR tend to be popular entry points. Prior auth is also approachable if you’re detail-oriented.

**Q4: I’ve only done med-surg. Am I competitive?**  
Absolutely. Med-surg teaches prioritization, discharge planning, and documentation—all prime remote skills. Emphasize outcomes and throughput.

**Q5: Do I need to know InterQual or MCG before applying?**  
It helps but isn’t always required. You can study public resources and speak to your approach: “I compare patient presentation with guideline thresholds, then write a clear rationale.”

**Q6: Are remote jobs truly 100% at home?**  
Many are; some are hybrid or require occasional on-site training. Ask early.

**Q7: What’s the work pace like?**  
Steady and task-driven. Less chaotic than bedside, but timelines still matter. You’ll trade physical sprints for documentation sprints.

**Q8: How do I stand out to hiring managers?**  
Metrics, clean writing, criteria fluency, and a calm voice. Show how you improve accuracy and throughput without sacrificing safety.

**Q9: I’m worried about isolation. Any tips?**  
Schedule micro-breaks, join your team’s chat, and keep one weekly coffee chat with a colleague. Humans need humans.

**Q10: Can I work from another state?**  
Depends on the employer, patient population, and compact license rules. Confirm licensing and HR policies early.

**Q11: Will remote roles expire as trends change?**  
Not likely. Documentation, criteria, and virtual care aren’t going backward.

**Q12: What about equipment?**  
Many employers provide laptops and headsets. You provide a quiet space, strong internet, and (ideally) dual monitors.

**Q13: What if I lack remote experience?**  
Reframe your bedside wins as remote wins: triage judgment, discharge coordination, protocol adherence, clean documentation.

**Q14: Can new grads do Work From Home RN jobs?**  
Harder, but not impossible. A year of bedside makes you stronger. Meanwhile, try telehealth support, patient education roles, or payer-adjacent internships.

**Q15: How do I avoid scams?**  
Beware of “pay to apply” schemes, vague job posts, or requests for bank info before an offer. Vet the company, check the domain, and ask direct questions.

**Q16: Do remote roles lead to leadership opportunities?**  
Yes. Team lead, quality analyst, educator, informatics, and program manager roles are all common promotions.

**Q17: How should I prep for a remote interview?**  
Rehearse two STAR stories, test your tech, tidy your background, keep a one-page “cheat sheet” with metrics.

**Q18: Are weekend or evening schedules available?**  
Often—especially for triage and payer queues. Ask for ranges during screening.

**Q19: What’s a realistic timeline to land a role?**  
If you apply strategically and push referrals, 2–8 weeks is typical. Your mileage may vary with market demand.

**Q20: How do I choose between UM/UR, CDI, and prior auth?**  
If you like criteria logic, UM/UR is satisfying. If you love documentation precision and physician diplomacy, CDI fits. If you like fast, criteria-driven decisions, prior auth works.
