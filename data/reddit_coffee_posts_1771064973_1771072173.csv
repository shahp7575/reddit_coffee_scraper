1r4jfi1,https://www.reddit.com/r/microsaas/comments/1r4jfi1/milestone_just_got_my_first_ever_prelaunch_sign_up/,Milestone: Just got my first ever pre-launch sign up!,"Hey everyone,

Super excited to share: **I just got my very first pre-launch signup today!**

https://preview.redd.it/e9w2km0iegjg1.png?width=1199&format=png&auto=webp&s=1026d0dda16de12daba1ff99e5b44fe42ccfc32f

I've built 2 products in the last 2 years and got 0 users. I know this sign up isn't a guaranteed user but its an early signal that what I'm building now is solving a real problem.

Seeing someone actually saying ""yes, I want in"" has given me such a rush and a huge motivation bump. I feel like I now have a personal obligation to build something that delivers on the promise my landing page displays.

Quick rundown for context...

Product: CalPal (AI weight loss companion)

* Problem I'm solving:                                                                                                                                                         
   * Everyone starts tracking calories with good intentions, but most people quit within two weeks. The apps are too much effort -> logging every ingredient, scanning every barcode. I'm building for the 2nd week onwards journey (where real progress is made). 
* Why I believe I can build something truly valuable:
   * I am an ex-fat guy. Lost 20kg twice. I've learned a lot through trial and error and LOTS of weight loss mistakes, so Im trying to distill everything I've learned into an app to help others transform their lives.              
* What I've built so far:
   * A landing page and waitlist at usecalpal.com. I've got a post-signup survey collecting data on why people quit tracking and what tools they've tried. Growing the waitlist and validating the positioning whilst building slowly to give myself enough time to try and gather data to inform features/design decisions.
* What's coming:
   * An AI-powered calorie tracker where you snap a photo of your plate, type ""chicken wrap and a coffee"", or scan a menu - and it logs everything for you in seconds. Plus a companion that checks in (""you've got 800 cals left tonight, plenty of room"") without it becoming annoying. 
   * Building with react native + expo.

If you're curious / think this might solve a problem for you (or someone you know), I'd love for you to check it out:

[https://usecalpal.com](https://usecalpal.com)

Not a hard plug - just sharing the small win and hoping to get more eyes + feedback. 

Would love to hear:

* Have you had a ""first signup"" moment? How did it feel?
* Any tips for gathering more pre-launch signups? (Reddit? X? Paid ads?)
* Brutal honesty: does the landing page hook you/make you want to sign up?

1r4jcy6,https://www.reddit.com/r/OveractiveBladder/comments/1r4jcy6/another_oab_testimony/,Another OAB testimony,"Hi, I'm 29M and wanted to share my story because it's really comforting to read other people who are going through the same and I feel a little bit less lonely.

I would say I have always been more conscious about my bladder than the average person: my mum constantly urged me to ”empty my bladder” before leaving home for whatever reason and I guess I got this habit from her. I would go to the bathroom just in case and, as all of you probably know if you are struggling with this, it's one of the worst things you can do. So I would say I have decreased my bladder capacity over the years, however, I was able to manage it more or less.

Things started to go downhill two years ago or so when I began to enjoy coffee: I got a home setup and my consumption got higher and higher (up to the point of having 5 espressos a day). This implies more caffeine, more bladder urgency and more just-in-case bathroom trips to prevent this urgency.

One day I asked myself if my number of trips to the bathroom was ""normal"" (at that point, I would say I went around 9-12 times per day) and then I started to monitor my bladder up to a point that is really annoying: it's like a task that my brain is carrying out all the time, I'm not able to fully disconnect from it.

In general, I would say I'm able to hold it for 2, 3 or even 4 (sometimes even 6) hours at best when I'm calmly at home, only drank one coffee and hydrate consciously but, the moment I have to go out for whatever reason, my brain starts the monitoring like crazy and my bladder becomes the center. You can imagine that this makes everything worse and my threshold lowers to 30-45 min or so if I've had some coffee. My timeframe when the urge hits until it becomes unbearable becomes really narrow (less than 15 min).

I am currently trying bladder retraining and, while it helps slightly with the capacity, it somehow makes me even more conscious of the symptoms, which worsens the anxiety, I guess. I am also trying to cut out the coffee but it's really hard for me because I truly enjoy it. My average pee with a really full bladder is around 400 ml (sorry that my European mind can't function with oz) and I would say I'm usually over 250-300 ml, so it's not like I'm peeing nothing but I would like to be able to hold it for more time. Sometimes, my bladder fills up so quickly that I have to pee twice or three times in less than an hour.

I have had a couple of accidents at my doorstep (I understand my brain triggers my urge when it knows I'm close to home) but I'm not so embarrassed about peeing myself, it's more the feeling that I will never be ""normal' again and will never be able to enjoy a trip without monitoring my bladder all the time that annoys me.

A few things that I think are helpful to deal with this:

\- Quitting caffeinated drinks probably eases the urge in most cases. I would consider it.

\- Conscious hydration: drink the water your body needs. It sounds silly but I think I sometimes drink more water than needed (and pee crystal-clear urine), fearful of being dehydrated, which worsens my symptoms.

\- Work out and eat healthily (not only because OAB. It's crucial for your health in general).

\- Do things you like and you're good at: I feel I have less focus on my bladder when I go climbing or playing paddle, since they are activities I really enjoy and my brain is putting its efforts on those instead of on the urge.

\- Deep breathing is also a good practice because it relaxes my whole body and lowers the anxiety a bit but it's hard when the urge feels really bad.

\- Strong pelvic floor contractions help tell your brain that your muscles are strong enough to hold it a little bit more. That's all you need: a little bit more every time.

\- Positive attitude: while hard to implement, it's really helpful to ease your worrisome thoughts. While progress is not linear, you can overcome this and you will. Your bladder won't rule your life.

And remember: despite you feel like it, peeing yourself is not the end of the world. I'm sure your loved ones would understand it and support you because everyone is fighting their own battle. It's fine if you sometimes need to go more than usual to the toilet when nervous, stressed or worried about something. Your brain is trying to sabotage yourself by triggering this response to the anxiety but you'll win in the end. You will overcome this because you're stronger than that and you deserve it. There is light at the end of the tunnel for all of us, we just need to do a little bit each day.

*Industry leaders say the rare earth stockpile could become a Strategic Petroleum Reserve for the 21st century — and blunt both Beijing’s leverage and terror-linked supply chains abroad*

[Trump's $12 billion Project Vault targets China in critical minerals battle | Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-12b-rare-earth-plan-targets-china-experts-warn-us-one-crisis-away?msockid=26144a00cf566fe51a0c5c7fceda6e91)

**EXCLUSIVE:** Industry experts warn the United States is ""one crisis away"" from losing access to the rare earth elements that power everything from fighter jets to electric vehicles — a vulnerability President [Donald Trump’s](https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump) new $12 billion ""Project Vault"" aims to address.

The initiative, backed by $1.67 billion in private seed money and a $10 billion loan from the Export-Import Bank, would create a federally supported stockpile of rare earth elements and other critical minerals. The U.S. currently imports much of those materials from China.

Executives from Graphite One, one of the country’s largest critical mineral developers, told Fox News Digital the effort could mark a turning point in the battle over China’s dominance of global supply chains.

""The Chinese are willing to weaponize access to … semiconductor materials like gallium and uranium,"" Graphite One advisor Dan McGroarty said. ""Then they turn off the tap and sort things out, give us a one-year reprieve, you know, it’s a leash, and they can yank that leash anytime they want.""

CEO Anthony Huston compared the concept to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, established after the 1970s oil crisis to safeguard U.S. energy security, arguing that critical minerals now play a similarly vital role in powering modern defense systems, advanced electronics and electric vehicles.

""For years, American businesses have risked running out of critical minerals during market disruptions… Project Vault \[will\] ensure that American businesses and workers are never harmed by any shortage,"" Trump said in his announcement last month.

Graphite One recently made news with its ""truly generational"" Graphite Creek site in Alaska, which is the U.S.' largest asset of that particular critical mineral, in Huston’s words.

As of 2024, the U.S. was at least 93% import-dependent on rare earth elements and graphite, according to the International Energy Agency, and remains heavily reliant on foreign suppliers for dozens of other critical minerals.

""The United States really relies on China and Africa for graphite. China, as we understand, is our adversary,"" Huston said.

A buried lede in the Project Vault news, he added, is a little-reported [counter-terror aspect](https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/terror/counter-terrorism).

Huston said some African mineral deposits, including in parts of Mozambique, are located in areas where ISIS-linked groups have operated. By onshoring development of critical minerals, the U.S. will not only work to unseat Chinese dominance but also deal a blow to operations in areas run by [people who want to kill us](https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/homeland-security), he argued.

McGroarty added that Project Vault reminds him of the idea of ""dual-use technologies"" during the Cold War, where computers of the time had technology that could not be exported – but could be used for both manufacturing and nuclear weapons design, for instance.

""On another level, we're going to have to balance it across 20, 30, 40 different metals, minerals, compounds, and composites, not just oil,"" he said.

McGroarty said the U.S. is ""one crisis away"" from having [REEs ""cut-off"" by adversaries like China](https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/china).

Huston also spoke of why Project Vault fits the 2020s more than any other time.

In the prior century, there were no cell phones, no EVs and graphite and the like were being used in analog tools like pencils and primitive computers.

The Graphite Creek site supplied materials for World War II-era steel production, a far cry from its potential role in today’s high-tech economy. Huston reiterated that the U.S. needs its own ""strategic petroleum reserve"" of critical minerals rather than [relying on adversarial nations](https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/foreign-policy/geopolitics).

""As they say when you're flying, put the oxygen mask on yourself first before turning to help those around,"" he said.

Asked about any nexus between Project Vault, the Senate’s renewed focus on Arctic national security amid foreign incursions and [Trump’s overtures toward Greenland](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/russia-china-squeeze-us-arctic-defense-zone-trump-eyes-greenland), McGroarty suggested there may be one — but it’s not yet clear.

He quipped that sometimes it’s better to look at the globe from the top rather than the side, which places North America in the center of everything.

""See what nations have a presence in the Arctic, you'll see [the importance of Greenland;](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/arctic-americas-frontdoor-forgetting-has-dangerous-consequences) you'll also see that the U.S. is an [Arctic nation only because of Alaska](https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/alaska),"" he said.

Of the 60 critical minerals on the U.S. government’s official list, Alaska has known resources of at least 58, he added.

""It’s the same sort of thing with Greenland. In the case of Greenland, I think there's a phrase that I use from time to time: resource denial — That is to say, you might try not to be interested in Greenland's resource potential in critical minerals. If you wake up one day, and the Chinese and the Russians are engaging in economic relationships in Greenland and directing those metals and minerals into their supply chains, you will have to be concerned about what goes on.""

China-based experts, on the other hand, were dismissive of Project Vault, with rare-earths analyst Wu Chenhui telling the state-owned Global Times that while Trump’s move is novel, it ""functions more as a short-term buffer than a fundamental solution,"" and other officials in the Communist nation were similarly bearish on the news.

Rocket Lab will launch a hypersonic test mission aboard its HASTE rocket later this month for the US Defense Innovation Unit (DIU).

HASTE, which stands for Hypersonic Accelerator Suborbital Test Electron, is a modified version of Rocket Lab’s orbital small-lift Electron rocket. It was designed to fly suborbital missions specifically to test hypersonic capabilities.

The rocket will fly Hypersonix Launch Systems’ DART AE, a hypersonic demonstrator powered by a hydrogen-fueled scramjet.

# Rocket Lab’s fourth hypersonic mission in under six months

Rocket Lab’s hypersonic test mission will launch from the private space company’s Launch Complex 2 at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on Wallops Island, Virginia. It will be Rocket Lab’s fourth hypersonic test mission in under six months. Its modified HASTE rocket flew for [the first time](https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/haste-rocket-labs-modified-suborbital-electron-rocket-just-flew-for-the-first-time) in June 2023.

According to Rocket Lab, the HASTE rocket allows customers to have control over flight profiles and environments, at speeds reaching as high as Mach 20, or twenty times the speed of sound. The company claims this capability is unmatched commercially. HASTE was designed to lower the cost of hypersonic testing, making it more accessible to research organizations and commercial customers.

The US DIU is tasked with accelerating the development of military and commercial dual-use technologies for national security. Australia-based Hypersonix, meanwhile, was founded in 2019 with the goal of developing scramjet-based hypersonic technology.

According to the company, its DART AE hypersonic demonstrator is the world’s first hypersonic launch platform with an entirely 3D-printed airframe produced from high-temperature alloys.

# Rocket Lab’s modified Electron rocket

Following Rocket Lab’s announcement of the hypersonic testing mission on social media, NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman [replied concisely](https://x.com/RocketLab/status/2022061165917155629) with, “I like it.”

Rocket Lab’s modified Electron rocket, HASTE, has a strengthened structure to help enable hypersonic testing. According to the company, it can lift up to 1,540 lbs (700 kg) to suborbital space. As a point of reference, Rocket Lab’s standard model Electron lifts up to 660 lbs (300 kg) to low Earth orbit (LEO).

Hypersonix’s DART AE vehicle, meanwhile, is approximately 3 meters long, and it has a mass of roughly 300 kg. The company claims the vehicle has a range of up to 1,000 km (621 miles), and it can reach speeds of Mach 7, or seven times the speed of sound.

Hypersonix [recently announced](https://interestingengineering.com/military/worlds-first-3d-printed-hypersonic-airframe) that DART AE had passed key vibration testing, paving the way for future flight tests.

Hypersonic research has gained traction in recent years largely due to the immense speed at which hypersonic vehicles and weapons can fly. Traveling at Mach 5 or faster, these systems can cover vast distances in minutes. In recent months, the race to harness this capability has sparked intense competition among major powers, driving massive investments in hypersonic research.

# 🔥 Key takeaway (dead nuts accurate):

If the question is **“Who has the best separation pathway that actually gets to commercial reality?”**  
Then the Top 4 are **MP → UUUU → NioCorp → SRC**.

[Sc-Al alloy isn’t a science project anymore — it’s a DoD + Prime-level requirement if the U.S. is serious about next-gen airframes, range extension, weight reduction, and high-performance systems. If scandium gets swept into price floors or stockpile logic like the 2025 Rio\/DLA-style deal level, Elk Creek becomes bankable overnight.](https://reddit.com/link/1r4jb8d/video/ze926529bgjg1/player)

# ⛏️ MY Top 10 North American ***Critical Mineral Projects (2026) ~

*\*\*\*Note: There are several other worldwide projects of equal merit not listed.*

10. **Defense Metals – Wicheeda (BC, Canada)** **Criticals:** REEs **Why:** Carbonatite + conventional separation route = high probability.

# ⭐ Why NioCorp ranks so high here

Because Elk Creek is one of the *only* North American projects that can become a **true multi-critical-mineral mine** (Nb + Sc + Ti + REEs) — not a single-commodity story.

https://reddit.com/link/1r4jb8d/video/2np7syhoagjg1/player

If you want to understand **which North American critical mineral / REE projects are real** vs. which are still “powerpoint deposits,” you have to stop looking only at the orebody and start looking at **separation**. Mining is hard, sure — but separation is where projects die, go bankrupt, or get delayed for 5–10 years. A resource estimate means nothing if you can’t turn it into **spec product** (NdPr, Dy/Tb, Nb₂O₅, Sc₂O₃, TiO₂, etc.) at scale, with acceptable costs, recoveries, and waste handling.

That’s why projects already producing deserve to sit at the top. **MP Materials (Mountain Pass)** is the only real operating REE mine in the U.S., and it’s the closest thing we have to a vertically integrated chain (mine → refining → magnet plan). **Energy Fuels (White Mesa)** is also real — not as a mine, but as a *processor*, and that matters. They’re taking monazite sands and producing separated oxides domestically, which is one of the few proven “right now” REE processing pathways in North America. **Saskatchewan’s SRC also deserves respect** as a real technical hub for rare earth process work.

Now look at the next tier: **Wicheeda (Defense Metals), Bear Lodge (Rare Element Resources), Round Top (USA Rare Earth/TMRC), Nechalacho, Bokan/Ucore, Halleck Creek**, and the emerging explorers (La Paz, Idaho Belt, etc.). Most of these have legitimate geology **and big upside!** — but the hard truth is: the majority are still in the stage where they’re proving metallurgy, flotation, leaching, and then *hoping* SX scale-up works later. That’s not a knock — it’s just the reality of REEs. If your separation flowsheet isn’t already de-risked, your “timeline to production” is basically fiction.

This is where **NioCorp (Elk Creek)** stands tall compared to almost everyone in development-stage North America. It isn’t a single-commodity REE story. It’s a fully permitted, feasibility-stage, multi-critical-mineral project with a much clearer path to bankability because it’s built around **high-value separated products** (niobium, scandium, titanium) with rare earths as additional upside. That’s a fundamentally stronger setup than “we need to build a whole new REE separation industry from scratch and hope funding shows up.”

And here’s the part people forget: **the NioCorp team has real legacy processing experience**, including leadership roots tied to the historical Mountain Pass/Molycorp era. They understand the brutal truth of what happens when prices collapse and separation economics aren’t resilient. Elk Creek’s advantage is that it’s not relying on a single REE price cycle — it’s stacking multiple critical minerals that the U.S. industrial base *actually needs* (Nb for steel + defense, Sc for ScAl alloys, Ti for aerospace/defense + pigment chain) & the REE's needed for magnets. **That diversification makes it far more survivable in the real world.**

Bottom line: MP and Energy Fuels are the only ones already “in motion” today at scale, but **IMHO\~** **NioCorp is arguably the strongest next North American critical minerals project to become an actual mine + separation operation** because it’s permitted, feasibility-backed, strategically aligned, and built around separated products — not just a deposit. In this sector, separation is the whole ballgame… **and Elk Creek is one of the few projects that looks engineered to actually win it.**

[NioCorp is Engaged & Rolling.. \\""The Elk Creek story is about to hit the catalyst stack like a freight train...All Aboard!!\\""](https://reddit.com/link/1r4jb8d/video/ezlre3jmagjg1/player)

And here’s the knockout part people are about to wake up to: **NioCorp isn’t a “rare earth hope story” — it’s a Seven-Critical-Mineral stack** sitting on a fully-permitted, feasibility-backed U.S. carbonatite with the kind of separation-first design that actually *wins* in this sector.

With the **March 2026 DFS** landing, the next dominoes are the only ones that matter in mining reality: **offtakes → financing → FID**. And if Mark Smith’s timeline holds, **Project Vault / Project Forge** plus an **EXIM-driven FID by mid-2026** turns Elk Creek from “someday” into “inevitable.” This is how you spot the next real North American mine *before* Wall Street starts pretending it always knew. 🚂🔥

Over the past eight months, every day and night have felt almost the same — just pure hustle. Shipping features, handling the team, managing the entire environment single-handedly. I’ve been building my startup for the last 12 months, and now we’re finally seeing solid traction and growing users. You could say my foot has been firmly on the accelerator.

For the last 10–12 months, I’ve been pretty isolated. No friend circle here in Noida. I’m vegetarian, don’t drink or smoke, so I rarely vibe with most social scenes. My routine is simple: gym, work, sleep — repeat.

I’ve been in a relationship for four years now, and my girl always comes up with the sweetest surprises. Today she sent me that this hand written letters book, chocolates and watch 😅

I’m so obsessed with my work that she jokes my product is her “sautan” 😂

But truthfully, she’s the one who pushes me to work harder and create real value in people’s lives. She motivates me to dream bigger, take risks, and reassures me that she’ll handle things if something goes wrong. And yes, she’s four years older than me — which makes her even wiser about life 😄

A Narrative in the Voice of Daniel

On the morning of January 31, 2026, I stood outside Jordan’s house with a small bag in my hand and a feeling I refused to name.

The sun had barely risen, and the air carried that quiet promise only early mornings could understand.

I told myself this trip was nothing significant.

It was only La Union for a few days and Baguio after.

A short escape before work swallowed us whole again.

When he opened the door, he looked exactly like himself.

Relaxed, confident, already mid sentence as if he had been talking before I arrived.

He greeted me with a grin that felt warmer than the morning air.

I stepped inside his home and immediately felt how natural it was to be there.

There was no awkwardness in the way we moved around each other.

We bumped shoulders in the hallway and laughed about nothing.

He teased me for packing too much even though my bag was barely full.

I teased him back for being dramatic.

It was easy in a way that unsettled me.

Comfort should not feel that rare.

Yet with him, it did.

We left his house soon after, carrying our bags and unspoken expectations.

The drive ahead of us stretched long and open.

Music played softly in the background.

He sang off key without embarrassment.

I watched the road but listened to him.

There was something grounding about his voice filling the car.

He talked about random things, about work, about friends, about plans he pretended not to care about.

I nodded and responded, but part of me was observing.

I was memorizing the way light touched his face through the window.

I was memorizing how easily he let me in.

The trip had barely begun.

I had no idea that something in me had already started moving.

I thought this would be a simple story.

I did not know it would stay with me long after it ended.

La Union welcomed us with bright skies and the sound of waves rolling endlessly toward shore.

The air smelled like salt and possibility.

We checked in, dropped our bags, and immediately stepped back out as if the room could not contain our energy.

Jordan walked ahead of me toward the beach, calling my name over his shoulder.

He looked alive in that setting.

The wind caught his hair and he did not bother fixing it.

We removed our shoes and let the sand press between our toes.

The ocean stretched wide and patient before us.

He began talking about how he had needed this break more than he realized.

I listened and wondered if I was part of that relief.

We walked side by side without forcing conversation.

The silence between us did not feel heavy.

It felt earned.

At one point our hands brushed accidentally.

Neither of us pulled away quickly.

Instead we laughed and pretended it meant nothing.

We found a small place to eat near the shore.

Shared food without asking whose was whose.

He fed me a bite just to prove a point in some ridiculous argument about taste.

I rolled my eyes but leaned forward anyway.

There was a softness forming in those small gestures.

It did not announce itself.

It simply existed.

Later that afternoon we sat facing the ocean.

The waves kept arriving and leaving like rehearsed promises.

He leaned back on his hands and asked me questions that felt almost personal.

Not invasive, just curious.

I answered more honestly than I usually would.

The day slipped by unnoticed.

When evening came, I realized I had not once thought about going home.

Night in La Union has a different rhythm.

Music drifts from nearby bars and laughter carries easily in the humid air.

Jordan insisted we try a few drinks even though he claimed he could handle his alcohol better than anyone.

I challenged that statement immediately.

He laughed and accepted the dare.

One drink turned into another.

His voice grew louder and his stories longer.

He retold childhood memories with exaggerated detail.

He nudged my shoulder each time he reached a dramatic part.

I watched him slowly soften under the influence.

The confident edges of him became rounded.

He looked at me more often than usual.

Hold eye contact longer than necessary.

At some point he leaned closer just to hear me better even though the music was not that loud.

I could feel the warmth radiating from him.

When he stood up too quickly, he swayed slightly.

I reached out instinctively to steady him.

He did not let go of my hand right away.

Instead he squeezed it once as if to reassure both of us.

We decided to head back before the night went too far.

The walk felt slower than earlier.

He was quieter now.

Half thoughtful, half exhausted.

By the time we reached the room, he was visibly drained.

He lay down without changing clothes.

I handed him water and told him to drink.

He obeyed with a lazy smile.

Then he closed his eyes.

The room felt smaller with the lights off.

I told myself I would only stay beside him until he fell asleep.

He shifted in his sleep and murmured something I could not understand.

I stayed seated near him, watching his breathing steady.

The air conditioning hummed softly in the background.

I noticed he was not fully covered by the blanket.

Without thinking, I adjusted it over his shoulders.

He moved closer instinctively.

His arm found its way around my waist.

The contact surprised me but did not alarm me.

I froze for a second before allowing myself to relax.

He pulled me in as if it were the most natural thing in the world.

There was no urgency in the gesture.

Only warmth.

Only closeness.

His face rested near my neck.

I could feel each breath against my skin.

My heart beat faster than usual.

I told myself this was care.

Nothing more.

He needed comfort and I was simply there.

Yet the way his body settled against mine felt deliberate even in sleep.

I placed my hand lightly on his back.

He responded by holding me tighter.

Time seemed to pause inside that quiet room.

The world outside faded into distant sound.

I listened to the rhythm of his breathing.

I counted it without meaning to.

Eventually his grip loosened slightly.

He had fallen into a deep sleep.

I should have moved away.

Instead I stayed.

Because leaving felt harder than remaining.

Morning light filtered through thin curtains and woke us gently.

Jordan stirred first.

He blinked as if trying to remember where he was.

Then he noticed our position.

His arm was still draped over me.

For a second neither of us spoke.

He slowly pulled back but did not rush.

A small smile appeared on his face.

He laughed softly and blamed the alcohol.

He said he remembered everything clearly.

Those words lingered in the space between us.

I searched his expression for discomfort.

There was none.

Only amusement and something unreadable.

We got up and prepared for the day as if nothing had shifted.

He hummed while brushing his teeth.

I watched him through the mirror and wondered what he was thinking.

The breakfast we shared felt ordinary.

Yet every time our knees touched under the table, I felt electricity.

He did not move his leg away.

Instead he continued eating and talking about plans for the day.

We explored more of La Union before heading to Baguio later.

He suggested we take photos together.

In one of them, his arm wrapped naturally around my shoulder.

I realized how easily we fit into each other’s space.

That realization both thrilled and unsettled me.

Because easy things are not always simple.

By the time we prepared to leave for Baguio on February 2, I knew something had begun.

I just did not know what to call it.

And maybe that uncertainty was the most dangerous part.

The drive from La Union to Baguio felt like a transition we did not acknowledge out loud.

The mountains rose gradually, wrapped in mist that blurred the distance between earth and sky.

Jordan rolled down the window despite the growing cold.

He said he liked how the air felt different here.

Crisper.

Sharper.

More honest.

I wondered if he realized how symbolic that sounded.

The road curved endlessly upward, and with each turn I felt us climbing into something less defined.

He talked less than he had in Elyu.

Not silent, just quieter.

As if he was thinking about something he could not quite articulate.

I asked him what was on his mind.

He shrugged and said nothing important.

But his tone carried weight.

When we reached the city, Baguio greeted us with fog that wrapped around buildings like a secret.

We found our place to stay and dropped our bags again.

This time the room felt colder, smaller, more intimate.

He rubbed his arms and laughed about not bringing enough jackets.

I offered him mine without hesitation.

He accepted it and did not return it right away.

We stepped outside to explore Session Road.

People moved around us in steady streams, yet I felt isolated in a private bubble with him.

He brushed against me often, blaming the crowd.

I stopped pretending it was accidental.

We shared coffee in a quiet café tucked between older buildings.

Steam rose between us like unspoken thoughts.

He looked at me over the rim of his cup longer than necessary.

I held his gaze this time.

Neither of us looked away quickly.

Something had followed us from the sea into the mountains.

That evening in Baguio unfolded slower than our first night in La Union.

There was no loud music this time.

No challenge about who could drink more.

Instead we walked through Burnham Park under dim streetlights.

The air was cold enough to make us walk closer together.

He slid his hands into his pockets.

I kept mine at my sides.

At one point he bumped his shoulder into mine playfully.

I responded the same way.

Soon we were laughing at nothing again.

But beneath the laughter was something steadier.

Something more intentional.

When we sat on a bench facing the water, silence settled comfortably between us.

He exhaled slowly and said he was glad I came.

The simplicity of that sentence carried more meaning than it should have.

I told him I was glad too.

He looked at me then, not joking, not distracted.

Just a present.

The moment stretched thin.

I felt the urge to say something deeper.

To name the closeness.

But I chose restraint.

We walked back to our place without discussing it.

Inside the room, the cold followed us.

He complained again and sat close to me on the bed.

Our knees touched.

He did not move away.

Instead he leaned back on his hands and sighed.

That sigh sounded like surrender to something neither of us understood yet.

We ended up lying down again, facing opposite walls at first.

The silence was not awkward.

It was charged.

I could feel him shifting occasionally.

As if debating something internally.

After a few minutes, he turned toward me.

I felt his gaze before I saw it.

When I turned too, our faces were closer than expected.

He smiled softly.

Not playful.

Not defensive.

Just open.

We talked quietly about random things at first.

Work frustrations.

Family expectations.

Dreams we pretended were unrealistic.

Then the conversation drifted into deeper territory.

He asked me what it was like growing up knowing I was different.

I answered honestly.

He listened carefully.

There was no judgment in his expression.

Only curiosity and something almost protective.

At some point our legs tangled without discussion.

Neither of us acknowledged it.

The warmth between us felt intentional now.

When I reached out absentmindedly and rested my hand near his side, he did not flinch.

He only inhaled slowly.

I asked if it felt awkward.

He paused before answering.

He said it would only be awkward if our friends knew.

That sentence lingered long after the words faded.

We returned from Baguio on February 3 with no dramatic goodbye to the mountains.

The trip felt unfinished in a way that made leaving difficult.

Back in the city, reality resumed its normal rhythm.

We stepped back into our roles as colleagues.

Conversations became structured again.

Messages returned to safe topics.

Yet something invisible connected us still.

When our hands brushed accidentally at work, neither of us reacted.

But we noticed.

The memory of shared beds and whispered conversations lingered between meetings.

I began replaying small details in my mind.

The way he had looked at me in the café.

The way he had said he remembered everything.

I tried to push those thoughts aside.

Logic demanded distance.

It reminded me of lines that should not be crossed.

But emotions do not always respect logic.

I noticed subtle changes in him.

His replies to my messages took longer.

His tone felt more measured.

As if he was editing himself before pressing send.

I told myself he was being responsible.

Protecting the friendship before it blurred further.

Part of me admired that restraint.

Another part resented it.

Because it meant he had noticed the same tension I had.

And instead of leaning in, he was stepping back.

The space between us widened quietly.

Not enough for others to see.

Just enough for me to feel.

One night, as I sat alone in my room, my phone lit up unexpectedly.

His name appeared on the screen.

My heart reacted before my mind could intervene.

The message was simple.

He asked if I could come over and stay the night.

No explanation followed.

No casual excuse.

Just that request.

I stared at the screen longer than necessary.

Every boundary I had built since Baguio trembled.

I told myself this was reckless.

Yet I found myself preparing to leave anyway.

When I arrived at his place, he greeted me with the same familiar grin.

As if nothing complicated existed between us.

We talked about ordinary things first.

Ordered food.

Watched something meaningless on television.

But the air felt heavier than before.

When it grew late, he did not suggest I leave.

Instead he handed me a spare shirt to sleep in.

We lay down side by side again.

The routine felt disturbingly natural.

I reached out to hug him without thinking.

He responded instantly.

Our bodies aligned with practiced ease.

I teased him lightly just to break the intensity.

He laughed and nudged me.

My hand found its way to his side again in that playful gesture.

He admitted it felt comforting.

Different.

The word different echoed in my chest long after he said it.

Days turned into a pattern that confused me.

We acted like nothing more than friends in public.

Professional.

Controlled.

But in private, we gravitated toward the same closeness repeatedly.

Shared beds became less surprising.

Late night conversations grew deeper.

He began mentioning trips meant only for the two of us.

Small getaways.

Private escapes.

He spoke casually, but his tone carried intention.

I pretended not to analyze it.

Even when my heart raced at the thought.

One evening, he used a word that unsettled me.

He called our dynamic cringy.

He said it with a nervous laugh.

Like a confession disguised as humor.

I asked him what he meant.

He struggled to explain.

Said knowing my type and knowing himself made everything feel strange.

As if we had wandered into a situation neither of us expected.

I chose honesty in response.

I told him the attraction did not need permission.

I told him he was charming.

He grew quiet.

Not offended.

Just thoughtful.

That silence carried more weight than any rejection could have.

He was not letting go.

But he was not stepping forward either.

Eventually the tension began to shift in a different direction.

His replies became shorter.

Instead of conversations, I received emojis.

Smiling faces that carried no depth.

Thumbs up symbols where warmth used to be.

I felt the distance growing in subtle increments.

The familiarity we built now felt fragile.

Uncertainty filled the spaces where clarity once lived.

I debated confronting him for days.

Finally I chose honesty again.

I told him I valued friendship more than confusion.

He responded gently.

Said life had been chaotic.

Said work was overwhelming him.

I wanted to believe that explanation fully.

Then he added something that settled heavily in my chest.

He said it would be better if we stayed the way we were before.

He said he was not ready for any relationship.

The words arrived softly.

Almost apologetically.

I felt no anger.

Only a quiet ache.

I agreed because I knew pushing further would only create damage.

Connection alone was not enough.

Timing mattered.

Readiness mattered.

We did not argue.

We did not dramatize it.

We simply let it settle.

Things stopped when they had to.

Not loudly.

Just completely.

After that conversation, nothing exploded.

There was no dramatic confrontation, no slammed doors, no final scene worthy of an audience.

Instead, there was stillness.

The kind that settles quietly into the corners of your life and refuses to leave.

We continued speaking, but something essential had shifted beneath the surface.

His messages became polite.

Measured.

Safe.

The warmth that once slipped naturally into his words now felt filtered.

I told myself this was maturity.

This was us choosing peace over possibility.

At work, we still shared glances across rooms.

But they no longer lingered.

They acknowledged, then retreated.

I missed the unguarded version of him.

The one who laughed too loud and forgot to protect himself around me.

Now he seemed careful with every expression.

As if proximity required strategy.

There were moments when our hands nearly brushed and both of us subtly adjusted.

The avoidance was almost imperceptible.

But I felt it.

Distance is louder when you have memorized closeness.

One afternoon, he asked if I wanted coffee.

The question sounded ordinary.

But the tone carried hesitation.

We sat across from each other instead of side by side.

A small detail.

A large difference.

I realized then that some endings do not require departure.

They only require restraint.

At night, however, my mind refused restraint.

Memories replayed in slow motion.

La Union waves.

Baguio fog.

The warmth of his arm tightening around me without hesitation.

I wondered if he remembered those moments the way I did.

Or if they had already softened into something forgettable.

I resisted the urge to ask.

Some answers only deepen wounds.

He still sent occasional late night messages.

But they lacked the quiet vulnerability we once shared.

He talked about deadlines.

About errands.

About trivial distractions.

Never about us.

I noticed he avoided any language that could be misinterpreted.

As if he feared reopening a door we had carefully closed.

And yet, sometimes, a message would slip through that felt almost familiar.

A joke only we would understand.

A reference to Baguio weather when it rained.

Those fragments confused me more than silence ever could.

Because they proved the connection had not disappeared.

It had only been renamed.

Redefined.

Restricted.

I tried to meet him where he stood.

Friendly.

Supportive.

Uncomplicated.

But every now and then, when his voice softened unexpectedly, I felt the old tension return.

There was one evening when we stayed late at work finishing something mundane.

The office had emptied.

The lights felt too bright in the quiet.

He stretched and sighed, rubbing the back of his neck.

For a second, I saw the same exhaustion I had seen in La Union.

Without thinking, I stepped closer.

I asked if he was okay.

He nodded and said he was just tired.

The distance between us felt charged again.

Not romantic.

Not inappropriate.

Just familiar.

Like muscle memory trying to resurface.

He looked at me then in a way that lasted half a second too long.

There was something unspoken in that glance.

Regret perhaps.

Or gratitude.

Or both.

I realized how much courage it must have taken for him to pull back.

Not because he felt nothing.

But because he felt something he did not know how to hold.

That understanding softened my resentment.

It reframed the ending.

Maybe this was not rejection.

Maybe it was protection.

Protection of identity.

Of certainty.

Of a life he had already defined.

Weeks passed, and the intensity dulled into something manageable.

The ache remained, but it no longer startled me.

I learned how to carry it quietly.

We found a new rhythm.

Less intimate.

More stable.

We joked again, but without the undercurrent.

He stopped inviting me to stay over.

I stopped waiting for the invitation.

There was relief in the predictability.

No more blurred lines.

No more suspended possibilities.

Yet sometimes, in unexpected moments, I would catch him watching me.

Not boldly.

Not obviously.

Just a flicker of attention that disappeared as quickly as it came.

I wondered if he questioned his decision the way I sometimes did.

If he ever replayed the night he held me without hesitation.

If he ever felt the weight of almost.

But I never asked.

Because asking would imply dissatisfaction.

And we had both chosen acceptance.

Acceptance is quieter than longing.

But it is steadier.

And sometimes steadiness is the kinder option.

One afternoon, a few days after the trip, we found ourselves talking about travel again.

Someone mentioned La Union casually in conversation.

He glanced at me briefly.

Just a second.

But in that second, the entire memory resurfaced.

The beach.

The drinks.

The warmth.

He smiled faintly and said it was a good trip.

Nothing more.

I agreed.

Nothing more.

That was the unspoken rule now.

Memories were allowed.

Interpretations were not.

Later that day, he sent me a message about something unrelated.

At the end, he added a small wave emoji.

It felt oddly personal.

I stared at it longer than necessary.

Then I replied with equal simplicity.

We had mastered this dance.

Step forward.

Step back.

Never too close.

Never too far.

It amazed me how two people could recalibrate so precisely.

How affection could be reshaped without disappearing entirely.

I began to understand something important.

Not every connection is meant to expand.

Some are meant to illuminate and then retreat.

Jordan and I had met at a fragile intersection of timing.

I was ready for something deeper.

He was still negotiating with himself.

Neither of us was wrong.

We were simply out of sync.

That realization brought unexpected peace.

Because it removed blame from the equation.

There was no villain in this story.

No betrayal.

No manipulation.

Only two people are navigating unfamiliar territory.

I stopped romanticizing what could have been.

Instead, I started appreciating what had been.

Honesty.

The laughter.

The quiet nights filled with warmth and breath.

Those moments were real.

Even if they were temporary.

And temporary does not mean meaningless.

It means finite.

And finiteness gives things shape.

Without limits, we would never recognize significance.

Sometimes I still wonder what would have happened if one variable had shifted.

If he had been ready.

If I had been less transparent.

If we had ignored logic entirely.

But speculation is a dangerous comfort.

It rewrites history into something cleaner than reality.

The truth is simpler.

We stopped when we had to.

Not because love was impossible.

But because they did not arrive together.

That distinction matters.

It transforms heartbreak into understanding.

There is dignity in choosing peace over chaos.

There is strength in stepping back before damage occurs.

When I think of him now, I do not feel bitterness.

I feel a quiet gratitude.

He showed me how powerful a connection can be even when it remains unnamed.

He reminded me that attraction does not always demand fulfillment.

Sometimes it only demands acknowledgment.

And once acknowledged, it can rest.

Not forgotten.

Not denied.

Just respected.

This was never meant to be a love story.

It never claimed that title.

There were no grand declarations.

No promises whispered under stars.

Only shared warmth in quiet rooms.

Only glances that lingered just long enough to matter.

Only conversations that hovered on the edge of confession.

And then restraint.

Beautiful, painful restraint.

Things stopped when they had to.

Without spectacle.

Without collapse.

Like a song ending before the chorus repeats.

Sometimes I think that is why it stays with me.

Because it never reached its loudest note.

It remains suspended in possibility.

Untouched by the complications that follow fulfillment.

In some strange way, that preserves it.

It lives in memory without damage.

Without resentment.

Just a soft ache and a quiet lesson.

Not all stories are tragedies.

Some are reminders.

That timing shapes destiny.

That courage and readiness must arrive together.

That connection alone is not enough.

And that sometimes, the good thing is not that it happened.

But that ended exactly when it had to.

Hi baking community,

I wanted to share a little of my story because baking for me is more than just a business.

I recently took over my mom’s bakery/cookie business after she passed away. She built it over 25 years, and baking was her passion. Stepping into her role has been emotional, but also something I’m really proud of. I want to honor what she built while also figuring out how to grow it so it can last for years to come.

Right now, I focus on classic homemade cookies and sell locally. I can produce about 14 dozen per week, and I have a small but loyal customer base that really values homemade quality.

Where I’m struggling is figuring out how to scale without losing quality or completely burning myself out.

I’m considering:

• Moving into wholesale (coffee shops, local stores, small businesses)

• Selling frozen cookie dough (schools, fundraisers, families)

• Pre-portioning dough balls to help with consistency and production speed

For bakers who have grown beyond small batch:

1. How did you keep quality consistent when you increased volume?

2. Did you move to frozen dough at some point? Was it worth it?

3. Did you notice recipe changes when scaling up batches?

4. How did you balance baking with the business side as you grew?

5. Any mistakes you made when scaling that you wish you could redo?

I want to grow, but I still want people to feel like they’re getting something homemade and special — the way my mom always made it.

Thank you for any advice or experiences you’re willing to share. I really appreciate this community.",1,1771070952.0,Baking,1,1.0,False

1r4j1cz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r4j1cz,"He saved me just to destroy me, link please?","Chapter 1

 When I was sixteen, my stepfather assaulted me. My mother called me a seductive bitch.

 The only one who reached out to me was my stepbrother, Dexter Whitaker.

 To take me away from that hell, he personally sent them to prison.

 To save up money to marry me, he went to the dangerous Golden Triangle region to fight his way through.

 Three years later, he became a well-known, successful businessman and finally returned home.

 But when I rushed to his company, clutching the bouquet I'd bought with all my savings, I accidentally overheard him talking with his friends.

 ""Dex, you're finally back from traveling the world with your precious beloved crush.

 ""But back then, to get revenge for Roxy, you paid off Oriana's stepfather and mother to stage that whole scene... Weren't you afraid she'd leave you if she found out?""

 Dexter was silent for a moment before letting out a cold scoff.

 ""She brought it on herself. Always had to compete with Roxy.

 ""I'm her savior. How could she ever bring herself to leave me?

 ""I'm gonna keep her by my side for the rest of her life and then destroy her world and her faith with my own hands.""

 A wave of mocking laughter came from inside the room.

 I collapsed outside the door, wiping my tears away in a daze.

 If all my pain was caused by him, then I would return it—completely.

 \*\*\*

 ""So when are you dumping that shabby, poor trash?"" Roxanne Harper leaned against Dexter's chest, clearly displeased.

 ""You're not actually catching real feelings for her, are you?""

 Dexter lowered his head and kissed Roxanne's soft lips. His eyes, however, held a complexity I couldn't understand.

 He said to Roxanne, ""No one matters more than you. As for her... I have my own plans.""

 The room burst into laughter.

 ""How could a bumpkin like Oriana ever compare to Ms. Harper?""

 ""She said she went to work at a club to ease Dex's burden. But I bet she must've gotten hooked on being slept with by her stepfather back then. Now she's just using the part-time job as an excuse to find men to sleep with.""

 Dexter's expression turned slightly cold at those words.

 ""Don't talk about those dirty things in front of Roxy.

 ""Also, Oriana works as a waitress. Nothing else.""

 I stood frozen outside the door, my heart aching with every breath.

 I stumbled backward until my back hit the cold wall.

 The intense pain cleared my head.

 To ease Dexter's burden, I worked as a waitress at a club.

 But I always ran into difficult customers, ones who'd even get handsy after drinking, pinning me to the ground and beating me.

 Remembering the sufferings I had been through over these five years, I couldn't hold back anymore.

 I pushed the door open.

 Dexter's expression froze. Instinctively, he pushed Roxanne out of his arms.

 Roxanne pouted unhappily. Then, she walked over to me with a provocative smile.

 ""So you're the stepsister-girlfriend Dex mentioned, the one who got played by her stepfather? You do look quite seductive. No wonder your mom called you a bitch.""

 I tightened my grip on the flowers and turned to look at Dexter. ""You told her?

 ""You know how much I hate anyone mentioning that.""

 But Dexter just casually took my hand, his tone indifferent. ""Roxy's spoiled and straightforward. Don't take it personally.""

 Those careless words shattered my heart completely.

 Eight years ago, my stepfather violently pinned me to the couch and assaulted me.

 I cried and told my mom, only to be called a seductive bitch by her.

 Everyone thought it was my fault. Only Dexter believed me, took me out of the darkness, and gave me the only light in my life.

 Back then, he held my hand and told me firmly, ""No one else will ever know about this, Oria. Don't be afraid.

 ""As long as I'm here, I won't let you suffer any more injustice.""

 I believed him.

 I believed him until I found that the cause of all my suffering had been carefully arranged by him.

 ""Dexter, you know me. I was never the type to just endure.""

 Smiling, I raised the bouquet full of love and smashed it toward Roxanne's face. ""Ms. Harper, you picked the wrong person to mess with.""

 Before it could touch her, Dexter shoved me hard to the ground.

 My wound slammed against the cold floor, the half-healed cut oozing fresh blood.

 Dexter's gaze was cold and unfamiliar as he shielded Roxanne behind him. ""Oria, you never used to be the violent type.

 ""After all these years apart, you've changed. So unfamiliar.""

 Staggering to my feet, I picked up the ruined flowers from the floor and tossed them into the trash.

 ""Dexter, you're the one who feels so unfamiliar now that I realize—I never truly knew you at all.""

Chapter 2

 ""If I hadn't changed, I'd still be letting those people walk all over me, letting thugs harass me as they pleased. Dexter, you know that better than anyone.""

 As soon as the words left my mouth, Dexter instantly panicked, grabbing my wrist. ""Oria, that's not what I meant.""

 But I didn't wanna listen, turning to leave.

 Dexter rushed out the door, seizing my arm with a grip so tight that it felt like he wanted to crush my bones.

 He said to me, ""Whatever it is, we can talk at home. Stop making a scene.""

 Just then, Roxanne's coquettish voice sounded. ""Dex, my headache is acting up again...""

 Dexter let go of my arm, his eyes flickering with hesitation.

 He opened his mouth but said nothing. In the end, he turned and walked away without looking back.

 I had anticipated this, and I laughed at myself bitterly.

 That very night, Dexter didn't come home.

 I sat in the empty living room all night, staring at our photo on the coffee table.

 In the photo, I was smiling sweetly, nestling in Dexter's arms. It was taken the day before he went abroad.

 That day, his hot tears fell on my shoulder. ""Oria, wait for me to come back. We'll get married then. No matter what, I'll protect you for the rest of your life.""

 Suddenly, the doorbell interrupted my memories.

 I saw Roxanne leaning against the doorframe, a smug smile curling at her lips. ""Dex slept at my place last night. I'm the only one he's ever slept with.""

 She deliberately pulled down her collar, revealing some suggestive marks on her neck.

 Then, she added, ""He said you 'serviced' your stepfather before, and he's afraid of catching something if he sleeps with you.""

 Rage surged within me instantly. I raised my hand and swung at her.

 But just then, Dexter strode over, shielding Roxanne, and grabbed my wrist in a death grip. ""Oriana, that's enough.""

 Looking at my hand caught in mid-air, I suddenly felt like laughing.

 ""Dexter, what happened eight years ago...""

 ""Enough!"" Dexter cut me off coldly, frowning. ""Oria, I suppose I spoiled you rotten. I hope you'll take some time to reflect on your behavior.""

 With that, he put his arm around Roxanne's waist and walked away without a backward glance.

 Before leaving, Roxanne turned her head and mouthed silently, ""Trash will always be trash.""

 I closed the door and leaned against it, slowly sliding down to the floor.

 Suddenly, my phone started buzzing wildly.

 I took it out. My screen was flooded with news about me:

 ""Stepsister of the prominent entrepreneur Dexter Whitaker was assaulted by her stepfather; her mother claims the girl herself initiated it,"" and ""Photos of Oriana Ledbetter serving drinks at the club; insiders reveal her chaotic private life.""

 The photos attached were from my time working at the club, maliciously edited to look suggestive.

 And the comment sections were filled with vicious abuse.

 I knew that without Dexter's silent permission, Roxanne couldn't have known any of this, let alone gotten hold of these photos.

 I walked out to the balcony, holding that photo of us.

 Then, I lit a lighter and watched as the photo curled, blackened, and turned to ash in the flame.

 The fire cast an orange-red glow on my face, and I smiled.

 ""Dexter,"" I whispered, ""this time, I'm not the one trapped.""

 The game had only just begun.",1,1771070841.0,Novelnews,2,1.0,False
1r4j0ul,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1r4j0ul/best_vpns_for_telegram/,Best VPNs for Telegram,"Your Telegram app won't load. Messages won't send. Voice calls drop mid-conversation. If you're in Russia, China, Iran, or any of the other countries restricting access to Telegram, this probably sounds familiar. The good news? A solid VPN can punch through those blocks and get you chatting again.

I've tested over 40 VPNs to see which ones actually work with Telegram—not just in theory, but under real censorship conditions. Some claim they'll bypass blocks but fail when it matters most. Others work but slow your connection to a crawl, making voice calls basically useless.

✅ **Quick Answer:** **NordVPN** is the best VPN for Telegram overall. It combines obfuscated servers that slip past government blocks, speeds fast enough for HD video calls, and a verified no-logs policy. If you're on a budget, **Surfshark** delivers similar protection for less money.

# Why You Need a VPN for Telegram

Telegram isn't blocked everywhere. But in countries like Russia (where restrictions intensified dramatically), China, Iran, and Pakistan, accessing the app ranges from difficult to impossible. Even in countries where it's technically allowed, schools and workplaces often block it to preserve bandwidth or reduce distractions.

Here's the problem: when Telegram gets blocked, your government or ISP doesn't just prevent the app from working. They're also monitoring who's trying to access it. That's surveillance you probably don't want.

A VPN solves both issues. It encrypts your traffic so your ISP can't see you're using Telegram, and it routes your connection through a server in a country where Telegram works fine. To anyone watching, you're just accessing a generic encrypted connection—nothing suspicious.

💡 **Pro Tip:** Even if Telegram isn't blocked where you live, using a VPN adds an extra privacy layer. Telegram's ""secret chats"" use end-to-end encryption, but regular chats? Those are stored on Telegram's servers and aren't encrypted by default.

# What Makes a Good Telegram VPN?

Not every VPN can handle Telegram effectively, especially in countries with sophisticated censorship like China or Russia. After testing dozens of providers, here's what actually matters:

**Obfuscation is non-negotiable.** Standard VPN connections look like VPN connections. Governments can detect and block them easily. Obfuscation disguises your VPN traffic to look like regular HTTPS traffic, making it much harder to block. Without this, your VPN becomes useless the moment censors update their detection methods.

**Speed matters more than you'd think.** Text messages don't need much bandwidth, but voice and video calls? Those require consistent speeds. I've seen VPNs that technically unblock Telegram but deliver such slow connections that calls become choppy and unusable. Aim for VPNs with servers that maintain at least 100 Mbps for smooth HD calling.

**Server locations determine flexibility.** You need servers in countries where Telegram works without restrictions. Europe, North America, and most of Asia outside China work well. The more locations a VPN offers, the more backup options you have if one server gets blocked or overcrowded.

**No-logs policies need to be verified.** Your VPN provider shouldn't keep records of what you do online. But claims are cheap—look for providers with independent security audits from firms like Deloitte or Cure53. If a VPN can't prove its no-logs policy, don't trust it with your privacy.

# Best VPNs for Telegram (Tested & Ranked)

# 1. NordVPN – Best Overall for Telegram

NordVPN consistently topped my tests for bypassing Telegram blocks. Its obfuscated servers work in China, Russia, and Iran—the toughest testing grounds for any VPN. I've used it during extended trips to regions with heavy censorship, and it's maintained reliable access throughout.

What sets NordVPN apart is its **NordLynx protocol**, a modified version of WireGuard that delivers exceptional speeds without sacrificing privacy. During testing, I averaged 420 Mbps on nearby servers and 280 Mbps on long-distance connections—more than enough for buffer-free Telegram video calls.

The provider operates **6,000+ servers across 60+ countries**, which means you've got plenty of backup options if one location gets congested or blocked. I particularly like that you can connect **10 devices simultaneously**, covering your phone, laptop, tablet, and more with one subscription.

**Security features include:**

* AES-256-GCM encryption (military-grade)
* Independently audited no-logs policy (verified by Deloitte)
* Automatic kill switch (prevents IP leaks if VPN drops)
* Double VPN option (routes traffic through two servers)
* Threat Protection (blocks malware and trackers)

🔒 **Security Note:** NordVPN is based in Panama, outside the 5/9/14 Eyes surveillance alliances. That jurisdiction gives it stronger legal protection against data requests from governments.

**Pricing:** Starts at **$3.39/month** (2-year plan). Not the cheapest option, but the performance justifies the cost. Comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee.

|Feature|Details|
|:-|:-|
|Servers|6,000+ in 60+ countries|
|Simultaneous Connections|10 devices|
|Protocols|NordLynx, OpenVPN, IKEv2/IPsec|
|Obfuscation|Yes (specialized servers)|
|Audited|Yes (Deloitte, Cure53)|

**Drawbacks:** The monthly plan costs $12.99—significantly higher than long-term options. Some servers can slow during peak hours, though this is rare. Linux app lacks features compared to Windows/Mac versions.

# 2. Surfshark – Best Budget Option

If NordVPN's price makes you hesitate, Surfshark delivers nearly identical performance for less money. I've tested it extensively across different countries blocking Telegram, and it punches well above its weight class.

Surfshark's **Camouflage Mode** (its obfuscation feature) makes VPN traffic invisible to deep packet inspection, which is exactly what you need to bypass government blocks. It worked reliably in my tests from restricted regions, though it took slightly longer to connect than NordVPN in some cases.

The standout feature? **Unlimited simultaneous connections.** You can protect every device you own with one subscription—phones, computers, tablets, smart TVs, everything. For families or people with multiple devices, this is huge.

Speeds are solid. I averaged 380 Mbps on nearby servers and 240 Mbps on international connections during testing. That's fast enough for HD Telegram calls without buffering or quality drops.

**Key features:**

* WireGuard protocol for speed
* CleanWeb ad blocker (blocks ads and trackers)
* MultiHop (double VPN routing)
* 3,200+ servers in 100+ countries
* Independently audited no-logs policy

💰 **Money-Saving Tip:** Surfshark's 2-year plan drops to **$1.99/month**, making it one of the most affordable premium VPNs available. The monthly plan costs $15.45, so long-term subscriptions offer massive savings.

**Pricing:** **$1.99/month** (2-year plan) or $15.45/month. 30-day money-back guarantee.

|✅ Pros|❌ Cons|
|:-|:-|
|Unlimited devices|Occasional server congestion during peak hours|
|Excellent obfuscation|Long-distance speeds slower than NordVPN|
|Very affordable long-term plans|Renewal prices increase significantly|
|Works in China and Russia|Customer support response times vary|

# 3. ExpressVPN – Best for Ease of Use

ExpressVPN wins on simplicity. Its apps are so intuitive that even VPN beginners can connect and start using Telegram within seconds. Obfuscation **turns on automatically** when needed—you don't have to dig through settings or enable special servers manually.

The provider operates **3,000+ servers across 105 countries**, giving you more location options than almost any competitor. Every single one supports obfuscation, which means you can connect to any location and bypass Telegram blocks without switching to specialized servers.

I particularly like ExpressVPN's **Lightway protocol**, which it developed in-house. It's faster and more stable than standard OpenVPN, especially on mobile connections. During testing, reconnecting after switching networks (like going from Wi-Fi to cellular) was nearly instantaneous.

**Features include:**

* TrustedServer technology (RAM-only servers, no data stored)
* Automatic obfuscation on all servers
* Split tunneling (route some traffic through VPN, some direct)
* Network Lock kill switch
* Independent security audits (KPMG, Cure53)

⚡ **Performance Insight:** ExpressVPN averaged 410 Mbps on nearby servers in my tests—slightly slower than NordVPN but more consistent across different times of day.

**Pricing:** **$3.49/month** (2-year plan) or $12.95/month. 30-day money-back guarantee.

|Feature|ExpressVPN|NordVPN|Surfshark|Winner|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Base Price (2-year)|$3.49/mo|$3.39/mo|$1.99/mo|🏆 Surfshark|
|Servers|3,000+ in 105 countries|6,000+ in 60 countries|3,200+ in 100 countries|🏆 NordVPN|
|Obfuscation|All servers|Specialized servers|Yes (Camouflage Mode)|🏆 ExpressVPN|
|Devices|10|10|Unlimited|🏆 Surfshark|
|Avg Speed (nearby)|410 Mbps|420 Mbps|380 Mbps|🏆 NordVPN|

**Downsides:** More expensive than NordVPN and Surfshark. Device limit of 10 connections (still generous, but Surfshark's unlimited is better for large households).

# 4. CyberGhost – Best for Streaming + Telegram

CyberGhost might not be your first thought for Telegram, but it's earned a spot here for one specific reason: its **specialized streaming servers** work exceptionally well if you use Telegram alongside Netflix, YouTube, or other platforms that get blocked.

The provider operates **11,500+ servers in 100+ countries**—the largest network on this list. More servers generally mean less congestion and more reliable connections. I never experienced slowdowns during peak hours, even on popular server locations.

CyberGhost's **NoSpy servers** (located at CyberGhost's Romanian headquarters) offer extra security and are operated exclusively by CyberGhost staff rather than third-party data centers. If you're particularly privacy-conscious, these are worth the small speed trade-off.

**Key specs:**

* Up to 7 simultaneous connections
* WireGuard, OpenVPN, IKEv2 protocols
* Automatic kill switch
* 256-bit AES encryption
* Romania-based (strong privacy jurisdiction)

🎯 **Bottom Line:** CyberGhost excels at unblocking multiple services simultaneously. If you want Telegram access plus reliable streaming, it's a solid choice.

**Pricing:** Starts at **$2.19/month** (2-year plan). 45-day money-back guarantee (longest in the industry).

**Limitations:** Obfuscation isn't as robust as NordVPN or ExpressVPN. Works fine for most Telegram blocks but struggled slightly in China during my testing. Monthly plan is expensive at $12.99.

# 5. Private Internet Access (PIA) – Best for Advanced Users

PIA isn't the prettiest VPN, and it won't win awards for beginner-friendliness. But if you like granular control over your connection, it's unmatched. You can customize encryption levels, connection types, and even choose your preferred port for obfuscation.

The **Shadowsocks proxy** integration helps bypass deep packet inspection in restrictive countries. Combined with OpenVPN obfuscation, I was able to maintain Telegram access in regions where simpler VPNs failed.

PIA operates **35,000+ servers** (yes, that's not a typo). Most of these are virtual locations, but the sheer number means you'll always find a fast, responsive server.

**Features:**

* Open-source apps (transparency for security)
* MACE ad/tracker blocker
* Port forwarding (useful for torrenting)
* Split tunneling
* Independently audited no-logs policy

**Pricing:** **$2.19/month** (2-year plan) or $11.95/month.

⚠️ **Warning:** PIA is US-based, which puts it in Five Eyes territory. However, its audited no-logs policy and multiple court cases proving it keeps no records mitigate this concern. Still, if jurisdiction worries you, go with NordVPN or Surfshark instead.

# How to Set Up a VPN for Telegram

Getting Telegram working with a VPN takes about three minutes. Here's the process I follow:

**Step 1: Choose and install your VPN.** Download the app for your device from the provider's official website. Don't use third-party app stores—stick with official sources to avoid fake or compromised apps.

**Step 2: Connect to an appropriate server.** Pick a server location where Telegram isn't blocked. Good options include:

* United States
* United Kingdom
* Germany
* Netherlands
* Singapore

If you're in a heavily censored country, enable obfuscation in your VPN settings before connecting.

**Step 3: Verify your connection.** Visit ipleak.net to confirm your IP address shows the server location, not your real location. This ensures the VPN is working properly.

**Step 4: Open Telegram.** The app should connect normally. If it doesn't work immediately, close and reopen it, or clear Telegram's cache.

💡 **Pro Tip:** If Telegram still won't connect, try switching to a different server location. Sometimes specific servers get detected and blocked, but another location from the same provider will work fine.

# Which Countries Block Telegram?

Telegram faces restrictions in multiple countries, though the severity varies. Here's the current landscape based on testing and research:

**Fully blocked:** China, Cuba, Iran, Pakistan, Russia (currently restricting), Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan

**Partially restricted:** India (some channels blocked), Indonesia (intermittent), Thailand (specific content), UAE (voice calls blocked)

**Recently added restrictions:** Nepal (monetary fraud concerns), Kenya (temporary during protests), Somalia

Russia's situation deserves special attention. As of early February 2026, Russian authorities dramatically tightened restrictions on Telegram, throttling speeds and blocking access for millions of users. The government pushed users toward the state-controlled Max messenger app instead. This makes Russia one of the most challenging countries for maintaining Telegram access.

🔥 **Hot Take:** Government blocks usually fail long-term. When Iran blocked Telegram, 75% of users simply started using VPNs rather than switching to government-approved alternatives. Censorship drives VPN adoption, not compliance.

# Telegram VPN Speed Requirements

Text messages don't need much bandwidth, but voice and video calls do. Here's what you actually need for different Telegram activities:

|Activity|Minimum Speed|Recommended Speed|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Text messaging|0.1 Mbps|1 Mbps|
|Voice calls|0.5 Mbps|2 Mbps|
|Video calls (SD)|1.5 Mbps|5 Mbps|
|Video calls (HD)|3 Mbps|10+ Mbps|
|Group video calls|5 Mbps|15+ Mbps|
|File transfers|5+ Mbps|20+ Mbps|

All the VPNs I've recommended here deliver well above these minimums. Even on international connections, you'll have enough bandwidth for HD video calls without buffering.

# Free VPNs for Telegram: Skip Them

Every week I see people asking about free VPNs for Telegram. Here's my honest take: they're not worth the risk.

Free VPNs make money somehow. Usually by logging and selling your data, injecting ads, or limiting your connection so severely that Telegram becomes unusable. I tested several popular free options, and none maintained reliable Telegram access in blocked countries. They either got detected immediately or were so slow that voice calls dropped constantly.

**Specific problems with free VPNs:**

* Data caps (typically 500MB-2GB monthly)
* No obfuscation (easily blocked)
* Slow speeds (unusable for calls)
* Logging policies (your privacy gets sold)
* Limited server locations
* Connection drops frequently

The only exception is Windscribe's free plan, which offers 10GB monthly and has shown some ability to bypass blocks. But even that won't work in countries like China or Russia where censorship is sophisticated.

If budget is tight, go with Surfshark at $1.99/month rather than risking a free VPN. The price of one coffee gives you reliable Telegram access without compromising your privacy.

# Common Issues & Troubleshooting

**Telegram connects but messages won't send:** Your VPN connection is working, but Telegram's servers might be experiencing issues. Try switching to a different VPN server location. If that doesn't help, wait 15-30 minutes—it's usually temporary server congestion.

**Voice calls keep dropping:** This indicates inconsistent connection speeds. Switch to a closer server or enable your VPN's ""split tunneling"" feature to route only Telegram through the VPN while other traffic goes direct. This can improve stability.

**VPN connects but Telegram still shows as blocked:** The server you're using might be detected. Try these steps:

1. Enable obfuscation in your VPN settings
2. Switch to a different server location
3. Change your VPN protocol (try WireGuard if you're using OpenVPN, or vice versa)
4. Clear Telegram's cache and restart the app

**Connection is slower than expected:** VPNs always add some overhead, but if you're seeing dramatic slowdowns:

* Test your base internet speed without the VPN using speedtest.net
* Connect to the nearest server geographically (closer = faster)
* Switch protocols (WireGuard is typically fastest)
* Try a different VPN server—some get congested during peak hours

# Staying Safe on Telegram

A VPN gets you access, but it doesn't make Telegram automatically secure. Here's what you should know:

**Regular chats aren't end-to-end encrypted.** Telegram stores these messages on its servers. Anyone with access to those servers (including Telegram employees or law enforcement with proper requests) can theoretically read them. For truly private conversations, use Telegram's ""Secret Chat"" feature, which enables end-to-end encryption.

**Metadata still exists.** Your VPN hides your IP address and encrypts your traffic, but Telegram still knows when you're active, who you're messaging, and how often. Complete anonymity requires additional steps beyond just using a VPN.

**Profile information matters.** If your Telegram username, phone number, or profile photo identify you, a VPN won't help with anonymity. Consider using Telegram's privacy settings to restrict who can see your phone number and last seen status.

**Be careful with shared content.** Downloaded files or clicked links can potentially expose your real IP if they're designed to track users. Your VPN helps, but don't assume it's perfect protection against sophisticated tracking.

# Final Verdict: Which Telegram VPN Should You Choose?

After months of testing across different scenarios and regions, here's my recommendation breakdown:

**Get NordVPN if:** You need the most reliable option for bypassing tough censorship (Russia, China, Iran). The combination of obfuscated servers, audited security, and consistently fast speeds makes it worth the slight premium over cheaper alternatives. The NordLynx protocol delivers exceptional performance for Telegram video calls.

**Get Surfshark if:** Budget matters most but you still want solid performance. At $1.99/month, it's the best value on this list. The unlimited device connections make it perfect for families or people with many devices. It works in restricted countries, though it takes slightly longer to connect than NordVPN in my testing.

**Get ExpressVPN if:** You're new to VPNs and want something that just works without configuration. The automatic obfuscation and intuitive apps remove all complexity. It's slightly more expensive than NordVPN but easier to use, especially for non-technical users.

**Get CyberGhost if:** You want Telegram access plus reliable streaming across multiple services. The specialized servers excel at unblocking content, and the 45-day money-back guarantee gives you more time to test.

**Get PIA if:** You're tech-savvy and want granular control over your connection. The customization options and massive server network appeal to advanced users who know what they're doing.

Bottom line? If you're dealing with serious censorship and need Telegram access you can count on, NordVPN is my first choice. It's consistently bypassed every block I've thrown at it, maintained fast speeds for video calls, and proven its privacy claims through independent audits. The slightly higher price ($3.39/month vs. Surfshark's $1.99/month) buys you that extra reliability and speed when it matters most.",1,1771070794.0,VPNforFreedom,0,1.0,False

Hi everyone,

I wanted to share a little background because this business means a lot to me.

I took over my mom’s cookie/bakery business after she passed away. She built it over 25 years, and I’m doing everything I can to honor what she created while also trying to grow it into something sustainable long-term.

Right now, I sell fresh baked classic cookies locally. I can produce about 14 dozen per week, and I’ve built a small but loyal customer base. The challenge is I want to grow without burning out and without jumping straight into opening a storefront or taking on huge overhead.

I’m starting to look seriously at:

• Wholesale cookies (coffee shops, small stores, local organizations)

• Frozen cookie dough for schools, fundraisers, and families

• Pre-portioned frozen dough balls to make scaling production easier

I want to grow smart and keep the homemade quality and family legacy feel, not turn into a mass production factory.

For other small food business owners who have scaled:

1. What was the hardest emotional or business shift when moving from a small batch to wholesale?

2. Is frozen dough realistic for a small operation, or does it get complicated fast?

3. How did you approach wholesale pricing without undercutting yourself?

4. When did you know it was time to move into a commercial kitchen?

5. If you could go back to this stage of your business, what would you do differently?

This business is personal to me, and I want to grow it the right way, not just the fast way.

I really appreciate any real-world advice or experiences you’re willing to share. Thank you.",1,1771070730.0,smallbusiness,2,1.0,False

My initial build was Entrepreneur with Sickles. This allowed me to focus almost exclusively on Harvesting up to about wave 9. I aggressively rerolled the level up upgrades to get Harvesting. From round wave 9 onward focused mostly on luck instead. I managed to get 2500+ Harvesting and 300+ Luck before Wave 20. I had also gotten many trees at this point, which meant I would get absurd amounts of loot after each wave.

At the end of wave 20, I found hourglass, letting me repeat the wave again. The second time I did not get the hourglass though, so my Harvesting started to decline. However, I managed to get hourglass multiple times in a row on Wave 21. Eventually I finally got a cursed hourglass (which I was looking for). This sent me back to wave 20. At this point my luck was so high that I managed to pull an hourglass consistently on every wave, either from the post-wave loot or the shop. The more I repeated this loop, the more luck and harvesting increased, and hence the higher the likelihood that I could repeat this loop indefinitely. I have managed to pull the hourglass 16 times so far, and I am now back to wave 19 after getting another cursed hourglass. From what I can tell, I can probably do this forever.

Work from home.  
Hours are flexible.  
No need to commute.  
Coffee, laptop. liberty.

This goal came true for a lot of digital marketers, particularly independent contractors. However, something shifted in the midst of back-to-back Zoom calls, continuous notifications, AI tools, and infinite performance data.

We have never been more interconnected.  
But more worn out than before.

Greetings from the new digital marketing world.

**The Illusion of WFH**

It felt liberating when working remotely became commonplace. No traffic. No politics in the office. No strict 9–5 routine.

But borders were silently obliterated by WFH.

Work no longer “ends.” It persists.

At ten p.m., you evaluate the campaign’s performance.  
On Sunday, you respond to a message from a client.  
After supper, you revise the ad copy.

Digital marketing is always in operation. LinkedIn, Instagram, and Google Ads are examples of platforms that never sleep. Additionally, advertisers don’t sleep when the platforms do.

Burnout was not caused by WFH.

We were no longer shielded from it by the physical barrier.

**The Acceleration of AI**

AI followed.

Everything sped up thanks to tools like ChatGPT, Canva AI features, automated email workflows, and predictive analytics.

It creates content in a matter of seconds.  
Ad versions proliferate in real time.  
Reports are generated automatically.

Doesn’t that sound efficient?

The fact is, however, that AI did not lessen pressure. It raised the bar.

Clients anticipate ten pieces rather than two if it takes five minutes to create the material.  
Instant effects are anticipated if advertisements can be automatically optimized.  
When AI tools are available to everyone, competition gets louder and more intense.

Digital marketers were not supplanted by AI.

The bar for performance was heightened.

**The Trap of Metrics**

One of the few professions where your performance is continuously apparent is digital marketing.

CTR and CPC.  
rate of conversion.  
ROAS.  
rate of engagement.

[](https://medium.com/write?source=promotion_paragraph---post_body_banner_jsw_blocks--7e72173dcc2f---------------------------------------)

Every figure has a personal touch.

Campaigns that are successful make you feel like a genius.  
They start to doubt themselves when they dip.

Burnout becomes silent when WFH isolation is added to that continuous measurement. No coworker is standing next to you telling you, “It’s okay, this happens.”

You alone. Your screen. as well as the dashboard.

**The Emotional Burden Nobody Discusses**

Digital marketers are more than just campaign managers.

We control expectations.  
We soothe individuals who are apprehensive.  
We repair damaged funnels.  
We deal with algorithm upgrades.

And we do it while acting as though nothing is wrong.

The emotional toil is not obvious.

Every “Campaign launched successfully 🚀” statement is the result of planning, anxiety, revisions, and occasionally restless nights.

**What’s the next step, then?**

Burnout does not indicate a poor professional choice.

It indicates that the system need limits.

The modern digital marketer needs to understand the following:

**1. Establish work hours, including WFH.**  
Without structure, freedom devolves into anarchy.

**2. Don’t put pressure on AI; use it as support.**  
AI is a tool. Human strengths include strategy, creativity, and empathy.

**3. Pay attention to impact rather than just output.**  
More value does not equate to more material. A better plan does.

**4. Create Intentional Offline Time.**  
You need mental space to be creative.

**The New World**

These days, digital marketing is strong, quick, and full of opportunities.

WFH provides versatility.  
Leverage is provided by AI.  
However, both can take more than they offer if there are no limits.

Digital marketing is about more than just growth and automation in the future.

It’s about having long-term goals.

Because growing a brand isn’t the only way to succeed.

It involves maintaining mental toughness throughout.

In 2026, digital marketing is no longer optional for small-scale businesses — it is the backbone of sustainable growth. From building brand visibility to generating qualified leads and competing with larger players, the right strategy can completely transform a local business into a scalable brand.

And if you're checking your balance on public Wi-Fi? You're basically handing them the keys.

Here's something that'll surprise you: Bank of America actually recommends using a VPN. Their official security page states you should ""avoid using public Wi-Fi for financial transactions unless you use a secure, private connection, like VPN software."" But there's a catch—they also block tons of VPN connections because their fraud detection systems flag unfamiliar IP addresses.

So you need a VPN that's strong enough to protect your banking data but reliable enough that BofA won't lock you out. After testing dozens of VPNs with actual Bank of America accounts, I've identified exactly which ones work—and which security features actually matter when your money's on the line.

# ✅ Quick Answer: Best VPN for Bank of America

**NordVPN** is the top choice for Bank of America customers. It combines bank-grade AES-256 encryption with a proven track record of working reliably with BofA's security systems. The extensive US server network means you'll always find a connection that works, and independent security audits verify their no-logs policy—critical when handling financial data.

**Why it works:** NordVPN's dedicated IP option prevents the constant IP changes that trigger BofA's fraud alerts, while the kill switch ensures your data never transmits unencrypted if the connection drops mid-transaction.

# Why Bank of America Blocks VPNs (And How to Work Around It)

Bank of America's fraud detection runs 24/7, scanning every login for suspicious patterns. When you connect from a VPN server IP that hundreds of other people use, their systems see a red flag. Multiple accounts logging in from the same IP? That looks like credential stuffing or account takeover attempts.

I've had my own BofA card frozen mid-vacation because I switched VPN servers too quickly. The system flagged two logins from different countries within minutes—completely legitimate on my end, but it looked exactly like a hacker bouncing between servers.

The solution isn't to skip the VPN. It's to use one that BofA's systems recognize as legitimate traffic.

**What BofA's fraud system watches for:**

* Sudden geographic jumps (New York to Thailand in 2 minutes)
* Known VPN datacenter IP ranges
* Shared IPs with suspicious activity history
* Multiple failed login attempts from the same IP

**How to avoid triggering alerts:**

* Stick to US servers when accessing BofA
* Don't switch servers mid-session
* Consider a dedicated IP if you bank frequently while traveling
* Use the same VPN server location consistently

💡 **Pro Tip:** Before traveling internationally, call BofA and add a travel notification to your account. Then connect to a US VPN server before accessing your account. This combo significantly reduces fraud alert triggers.

# Critical Security Features for Banking (Not All VPNs Have These)

Not every VPN is built for financial security. Free VPNs? Forget it—many log your data and some even inject ads. Budget VPNs often skip the features that actually protect your banking sessions.

Here's what you absolutely need when money's involved.

# AES-256 Encryption: Your Digital Vault

AES-256 is the same encryption the US government uses for classified information. It creates 2^(256) possible key combinations—a number so large it would take every computer on Earth working together billions of years to crack.

When you're sending your account number, routing number, or clicking ""transfer $5,000,"" that data needs to be completely unreadable to anyone intercepting it. AES-256 makes that happen.

# Kill Switch: Your Emergency Brake

Picture this: You're logged into BofA, mid-transaction, and your VPN connection drops for 2 seconds. Without a kill switch, your device immediately reconnects through your regular internet—completely unencrypted. Your ISP sees everything. Anyone monitoring that coffee shop Wi-Fi sees everything.

A kill switch cuts your internet connection the instant the VPN drops. No data escapes. The connection only resumes once the encrypted VPN tunnel rebuilds.

I've tested this by deliberately disconnecting VPN servers mid-session. NordVPN and ExpressVPN both blocked all traffic instantly. Surfshark took about 1-2 seconds. Some cheaper VPNs? They let 5-10 seconds of unencrypted data through. Unacceptable for banking.

# DNS Leak Protection: Closing the Backdoor

Your device makes DNS requests every time you visit a website—essentially asking ""where is bankofamerica.com?"" Even with a VPN, some devices send these requests outside the encrypted tunnel straight to your ISP.

That DNS leak reveals every site you visit. Your ISP sees ""this person logged into Bank of America at 2:47 PM."" Not the content of your session, but enough to build a complete activity profile.

Quality VPNs force all DNS requests through their own encrypted servers. Your ISP sees nothing except ""connected to VPN."" Period.

# No-Logs Policy (Actually Verified)

Marketing claims are worthless. Every VPN says ""we don't log your data!"" But without independent audits, you're trusting their word.

NordVPN has undergone five separate third-party audits verifying their no-logs claims. ExpressVPN's been audited by PwC. These aren't internal reviews—they're external security firms inspecting server configurations, code, and data handling practices.

Why does this matter for banking? If a VPN logs your connection data, that creates a paper trail linking you to your banking sessions. In a breach or legal request, that data could be compromised or handed over.

⚠️ **Warning:** Avoid any VPN that hasn't published independent audit results. ""Trust us"" isn't good enough when your bank account is involved.

# The 3 Best VPNs for Bank of America (Tested & Verified)

I've personally tested these VPNs with active Bank of America accounts across different connection types: home Wi-Fi, public hotspots, mobile data, and international travel scenarios. These three consistently worked without triggering fraud alerts while maintaining proper security.

# 1. NordVPN – Best Overall for Bank of America

**Pricing:** $3.39/month (2-year plan) | $4.59/month (1-year) | $12.99/month

NordVPN dominates the banking VPN space for good reason. I've used it for BofA access across 15+ US cities and three international trips without a single account freeze or fraud alert.

The NordLynx protocol (their WireGuard implementation with double NAT) delivers encryption that's both unbreakable and fast. During testing, I maintained 450+ Mbps speeds on a gigabit connection—fast enough that banking interfaces loaded instantly with zero lag.

**What makes NordVPN ideal for banking:**

The Threat Protection feature blocks malware and phishing attempts before they reach your device. This caught two fake ""BofA security alert"" emails in my testing that looked completely legitimate.

Double VPN routes your connection through two separate servers for an extra encryption layer. Overkill for most situations, but if you're accessing your bank on hotel Wi-Fi in a foreign country? That's exactly when you want maximum protection.

Five independent security audits verify their no-logs claims. PwC, Deloitte, and other firms have inspected their entire infrastructure. Your banking activity isn't logged anywhere.

**The dedicated IP advantage:** For $5.83/month extra, you get an IP address that's yours alone. BofA's fraud systems recognize it as your ""home"" connection. I've accessed my account from this IP hundreds of times without a single security challenge.

**Honest drawbacks:**

* The monthly price ($12.99) is steep if you don't commit long-term
* The Linux app lacks some features compared to Windows/Mac versions
* Occasional server congestion during peak hours (though switching servers solves it)

🏆 **Bottom Line:** If you value your banking security and don't want to deal with constant fraud alerts, NordVPN is worth the investment. The Basic plan covers everything you need; upgrade to Plus if you want the password manager.

# 2. ExpressVPN – Fastest Speeds for Banking

**Pricing:** $3.49/month (2-year Basic) | $4.79/month (1-year) | $13.99/month

ExpressVPN became noticeably cheaper with their tiered pricing launch. The Basic plan now undercuts their old pricing while still delivering the core VPN everyone loves.

Speed is where ExpressVPN crushes the competition. In testing, I averaged 620 Mbps on a gigabit connection—faster than NordVPN and significantly faster than Surfshark. For banking, this means instant page loads and zero buffering on video verification calls with customer service.

**Why it works for Bank of America:**

Their Network Lock kill switch is system-level, meaning it protects all traffic on your device automatically. No configuration needed. During my testing, it blocked internet access within 0.3 seconds of VPN disconnection—the fastest response I measured.

TrustedServer technology runs everything in RAM with no hard drives. When a server reboots, all data—including any temporary connection logs—vanishes completely. You can't log what doesn't exist.

The Advanced plan includes identity monitoring that scans the dark web for your email and personal data. Caught my credit card number in a breach database I didn't know about.

**What you're trading off:**

* More expensive than Surfshark, less feature-packed than NordVPN's higher tiers
* Dedicated IP only available on Pro plan ($7.49/month)
* Smaller server network means fewer backup options

⚡ **Best for:** People who need maximum speed and don't mind paying a premium. If your BofA dashboard loads slowly on other VPNs, ExpressVPN solves it.

# 3. Surfshark – Budget-Friendly Banking Protection

**Pricing:** $1.99/month (2-year Starter) | $3.19/month (1-year) | $15.45/month

At under $2/month for the two-year plan, Surfshark costs less than a coffee. Yet it delivers legitimate banking-grade security that I've trusted with my own accounts.

The unlimited device connections are genuinely unlimited. I've simultaneously connected my laptop, phone, tablet, smart TV, and partner's devices without any slowdown or disconnections. Perfect for families sharing one subscription.

**Banking features that impressed me:**

CleanWeb blocks ads and known malicious sites. This caught three fake ""Bank of America password reset"" pages during testing. The URLs looked legitimate at first glance but CleanWeb flagged them before I could click.

MultiHop routes your connection through two countries for extra privacy. I used this when accessing BofA from a sketchy hotel Wi-Fi network in Eastern Europe—connection went through US → Netherlands → my device.

The kill switch works reliably but took 1-2 seconds to engage in testing. Not as instant as ExpressVPN, but still protected my data before any leakage occurred.

**Where Surfshark falls short:**

* Speeds averaged 280 Mbps in testing—fast enough for banking but noticeably slower than competitors
* Fewer US servers (600+) than NordVPN (1,900+)
* Dedicated IP costs extra ($3.99/month on top of subscription)

💰 **Money-Saving Tip:** The monthly price is absurdly high at $15.45. Never pay monthly—the 2-year plan saves you 87% and costs less than $50 total for 27 months of coverage.

# Essential Settings for Bank of America Access

Getting your VPN configured correctly prevents 90% of the headaches people experience with BofA access. Here's exactly what to set up.

# Always Use US Servers

Bank of America limits functionality for connections originating outside the US. Try to deposit a check from a European IP? Blocked. Access certain account management features from Asia? Restricted.

Connect to a US VPN server before accessing BofA. Period.

**My server selection strategy:**

* Choose geographically close servers for best speeds (West Coast users → California/Washington, East Coast → New York/Virginia)
* Avoid servers in states where BofA doesn't have a major presence
* Save your preferred server and use it consistently

# Enable the Kill Switch (And Verify It Works)

Every VPN I recommend has a kill switch, but you need to enable it.

**NordVPN:** Settings → Kill Switch → toggle ON **ExpressVPN:** Enabled by default (Network Lock) **Surfshark:** Settings → VPN Settings → Kill Switch → ON

**Test your kill switch:** Connect to VPN, open BofA in browser, then manually disconnect the VPN in the app. Your internet should die instantly. If the page reloads or you can browse, your kill switch isn't working.

# Turn Off IPv6

Most VPNs only protect IPv4 traffic. If your device uses IPv6, that traffic can leak outside the VPN tunnel—completely unencrypted.

**Disable IPv6:**

* **Windows:** Network Settings → Change adapter options → right-click your connection → Properties → uncheck ""Internet Protocol Version 6""
* **Mac:** System Preferences → Network → Advanced → TCP/IP → Configure IPv6 → Off
* **Android/iOS:** Usually disabled by default, but check VPN app settings

# Configure DNS to VPN Servers Only

Some devices ignore VPN DNS settings and send requests to your ISP anyway.

**Force VPN DNS:**

* **NordVPN:** Enabled automatically
* **ExpressVPN:** Enabled automatically
* **Surfshark:** Settings → Advanced → DNS → Use Surfshark DNS

Verify with a DNS leak test at dnsleaktest.com. You should see only your VPN provider's DNS servers, never your ISP.

# Public Wi-Fi and Bank of America: What You Need to Know

Coffee shop Wi-Fi is a hacker's paradise. No password, no encryption, everyone on the same network. Perfect for stealing banking credentials.

I ran a test at a popular café using Wireshark (packet sniffing software). Without a VPN, I could see every unencrypted request from other devices on the network. Websites visited, app activity, login attempts to various services.

Bank of America uses HTTPS encryption, which helps. But a VPN adds three critical layers HTTPS can't provide:

**Layer 1: Complete traffic encryption** – HTTPS encrypts webpage content, but your device still broadcasts that you're accessing bankofamerica.com. A VPN hides which sites you visit entirely.

**Layer 2: IP address protection** – Your real IP address reveals your location and identity. Hackers use this to build profiles and launch targeted attacks. VPN masks it completely.

**Layer 3: Man-in-the-middle defense** – Sophisticated attacks can intercept HTTPS connections on public Wi-Fi. VPN tunneling prevents these attacks from even seeing your BofA traffic.

🔒 **Security Note:** Never access Bank of America on public Wi-Fi without an active VPN connection. The security risk isn't worth the convenience.

# Traveling Internationally with Bank of America Access

BofA customers traveling abroad face two problems: restricted access and fraud alerts.

I learned this the hard way during a European vacation. Tried to check my balance from a hotel in Amsterdam—account locked. Had to call from an international number, wait 45 minutes on hold, and verify my identity through security questions I'd set up years ago and barely remembered.

**Here's the bulletproof travel banking setup:**

**Before you leave:**

1. Call BofA and add a travel notification (even if using a VPN)
2. Enable two-factor authentication through your BofA account
3. Download your VPN app and log in before departing

**When abroad:**

1. Connect to a US VPN server first
2. Then access Bank of America
3. Use the same US server location for all banking sessions
4. Don't switch servers mid-session

The travel notification tells BofA ""I'm in Europe but I'm still me."" The US VPN server tells their systems ""I'm accessing from a US IP."" This combo almost never triggers fraud alerts.

I tested this across 8 countries over 3 weeks. Zero lockouts, zero security challenges beyond standard 2FA.

**Countries where BofA access is particularly restricted without VPN:**

* China (entire site blocked without VPN)
* Russia (limited functionality)
* Iran, Syria, North Korea (completely blocked)
* Most of Southeast Asia (reduced features)

# Common Issues and Quick Fixes

# ""We've detected suspicious activity on your account""

**Cause:** You triggered BofA's fraud detection, usually by switching servers or logging in from unusual locations.

**Fix:** Call BofA (use the number on your card, not from email), verify your identity, explain you were using a VPN for security. They'll unlock your account. Then stick to one US server location going forward.

# Connection drops during banking session

**Cause:** VPN instability or weak Wi-Fi signal.

**Fix:**

1. Enable kill switch (prevents unencrypted reconnection)
2. Use wired ethernet instead of Wi-Fi when possible
3. Switch to a less congested VPN server
4. Update your VPN app to the latest version

# Can't access certain BofA features

**Cause:** Connected to a non-US server or using a flagged IP address.

**Fix:** Disconnect VPN, clear browser cookies and cache, reconnect to a different US server, then try again. If persistent, contact VPN support for a dedicated IP.

# Slow loading times

**Cause:** VPN server congestion or geographical distance.

**Fix:** Connect to a geographically closer server. East Coast users should use East Coast servers, etc. Also try switching protocols (NordVPN users: try NordLynx instead of OpenVPN).

# Free VPNs and Banking: Don't Do It

I tested five popular free VPNs with Bank of America. Three leaked DNS requests. Two injected tracking cookies. One showed ads in the VPN app itself—ads that connected to third-party ad networks while I was logged into my bank.

Free VPNs make money by monetizing your data. They sell browsing history to advertisers. Some install tracking pixels. The worst ones inject affiliate links into your web traffic.

Would you trust a company that sells your browsing data with access to your banking sessions? Exactly.

**The free VPN trap:**

* Data caps (usually 500MB-10GB/month)
* Speed limits that make banking interfaces unusable
* Server networks too small to avoid BofA's fraud detection
* No kill switch or DNS leak protection
* Logging policies buried in 50-page Terms of Service

The $3-4/month you'd spend on a legitimate VPN is insurance. It's cheaper than one instance of identity theft or a compromised bank account.

# Final Verdict: Which VPN Should You Choose?

Here's my honest recommendation based on different use cases:

**Best for most people:** NordVPN Basic ($3.39/month, 2-year plan) Reliable BofA access, proven security, extensive US servers. The dedicated IP add-on solves fraud alert issues completely.

**Best for speed freaks:** ExpressVPN Basic ($3.49/month, 2-year plan) Fastest speeds I've tested, instant kill switch, TrustedServer RAM-only infrastructure. Worth the extra $0.10/month if your internet connection is fast and you want to use all of it.

**Best budget option:** Surfshark Starter ($1.99/month, 2-year plan) Legitimate security at unbeatable prices. Unlimited devices means one subscription protects your entire family. Slightly slower but perfectly functional for banking.

**Skip if money's tight:** All the monthly plans. They're 4-6x more expensive than annual commitments and deliver identical security. If you can't afford the upfront cost of a 2-year plan, go with the 1-year option—still better value than monthly.

The VPN you choose matters less than actually using one. Bank of America's official security guidance is clear: use a VPN on public Wi-Fi. The $40-80 you'll spend for two years of coverage is nothing compared to the thousands a compromised account could cost.

Your banking security is worth $2-4 per month. Period.",1,1771069237.0,VPNforFreedom,0,1.0,False

Hi everyone. Appreciate your help.

I am currently not diagnosed with any mental health symptoms other than anxiety. But I do think there is something severely wrong with me. Im only 26 but I do forget a lot of things (the type of things which I explained to someone only to get laughed at or dismissed as oh you are just being clumsy.)

For example recently I (was behind a cash register) was talking to a customer who was about to buy a product. And I was explaining about the product only for my manager to tell me hey its me why are you telling about the product to me. And then only I realised I have not realised I was not talking to my customer but my manager. I dont know how that happened and how I sort of got blanked out.

Also another frequent occurrences for me would be 

\-Heating milk and forgetting I was in the middle of making coffee and about an hour or later I remember oh I was going to make coffee.

\-Losing my belongings when I need them (my room is somewhat messy but I do live in the mess without feeling the need to be organized)

\-Thinking about something and then book I forget it until like few hours later, only to remember that I was thinking about something and not remember what exactly it was.

\-Also sometimes I stutter when I speak (not because English is my second language, this thing happens to me when I speak my mother tongue also) Its like I'm about to speak a sentence and midway of speaking the sentence changes to something else in my head and in the end the sentence that is coming out of my mouth is not a very articulate one.

I am currently out-of-school and employment so ang dami kong free time. Doing online courses and learning stuffs are my only means of killing time. Kinda stuck in limbo, too... 💀

Yes, I can do it alone just fine. It is fun naman but I think I am missing something—the social aspect of learning. If I have peers or accountability buddies, the learning process will probably become much better and easier. Kaya here I am, looking for friends or kasama sa pagaaral.

Here's a short introduction about me:

* Can drink coffee, matcha, and tea—depends on the availability.
* Can play open world and simulation video games.
* Generally interested in science, technology, and social sciences. I have some introductory knowledge din in Linguistics. I can program din. Medyo may creative side din ako pero di ko hinasa.
* Can only dedicate my time and effort on free learning materials (I am broke, huhu) It would be nice if may sponsor.
* No bad vices. Am clean!

About You:

* Just be yourself and be a human.
* Around the age of 21-30
* Passionate about learning, even informally or by yourself lang.
* Can use Discord for communications.

Regarding the aaralin, siguro pagusapan muna natin. Let's see if we can come up with one.

Gagawa din ako ng discord group chat or server kapag marami tayo.

Phone in my hand before my eyes were fully open. Notifications. Emails. Other people’s priorities. By 9am I felt like I was reacting to life instead of living it. I kept telling myself I needed a full reset, new planner, new system, new goals, new version of me. But every time I tried to change everything at once, I burned out by week two.

So I did something smaller, I made one rule: no phone for the first 30 minutes. That’s it.

Instead, I sit with coffee. Sometimes I journal one messy page. Sometimes I just stare out the window and think. Sometimes I write the one thing that would make today feel like a win.

And something shifted.

I stopped starting my day in defense mode, instead, I started choosing my focus instead of inheriting it. My productivity didn’t explode overnight, but my clarity did. And clarity is what actually moves things forward.

It made me realize something: productivity isn’t about squeezing more into your day, It’s about protecting your energy before the world grabs it.

If you feel overwhelmed, don’t rebuild your whole life, just protect your first 30 minutes. That small boundary changed more than any app ever did. ☕✨",10,1771068084.0,Productivitycafe,4,0.92,False

Then, about 10 mins later, I was looking at a screen, seeing what I needed to do next (I was trying to figure out what needed to be done, because nobody taught me how to read the screens), and he said “stop standing around and actually do something”, and handed me a bag to take out to a car. When he did that my mood was wrecked. I was trying my best, I was confused because the only people who work there are a bunch of teenagers, and don’t offer to teach me anything, and I literally did more things then him, all he does is pack bags, and occasionally make food. I went to the bathroom and started crying, I never liked this job because nobody wanted to teach me anything, and now I’m getting in trouble because I don’t know what to do. When I go back to the kitchen, a lady (customer) saw me (bloodshot eyed) and asked if I was ok, I burst into tears again, she told me to come out of the kitchen and outside with her, she gave me a big hug (mind you, she’s a complete stranger), I told her what happened and she said that he’s a bit\*\*, and she’ll tell my boss for me, and she’ll help me tell my boss if I could go home early (because I seriously was not in the right mind at all), I said that its ok though. 

But that just makes me think, why would she do that for me, she calmed me down, talked to me, she took 15 minutes out of her time to help, and she didn’t know me. She was there to get food with her partner and leave, but no, she wanted to help me. I wish I could properly thank her, know her name. If she didn’t step in, my shift would’ve been so much more worse, I don’t know how I would’ve handled it.

May your love feel less like fireworks and more like a steady flame.

Not loud, not desperate, just warm. Certain. Safe.

May you continue discovering each other in the smallest ways

in how they take their coffee,

in the pauses between their sentences,

in the quiet ways they reach for you without thinking.

In answering the phone.

In showing up when it’s inconvenient.

In choosing honesty over ego.

In staying respectful even when you’re upset.

Love is not proven in flowers or dinner reservations.

It’s proven in consistency.

Valentine’s Day is sweet, but what matters more is February 15.

And March.

And the random Tuesday when one of you is tired and difficult and overwhelmed.

Today is not about grand gestures.

It is about the ordinary miracle of being seen and staying.

May you protect what you are building.

May you argue with kindness.

May you forgive quickly.

May you never weaponize each other’s softness.

And when the world becomes heavy, may your love be the place where both of you can lay your armor down.

If you are lucky enough to have someone who feels like home, who feels safe, protect that.

Not with jealousy. Not with control.

But with communication. With effort. With integrity.

Romance is beautiful.

But stability? That’s sacred.

Happy Valentine’s Day!

Keep choosing each other. Not just today, but on the days that are harder.

Honor the daily work that makes love last.

 At two in the morning, there was movement at the door.

 My husband, Maverick Giebler, changed his shoes and tiptoed in, the faint scent of gardenia perfume still clinging to his clothes.

 It was Savannah Fillery's favorite fragrance.

 I smelled it on him before. When I asked, he claimed he picked it up in the elevator.

 I believed him.

 Looking back, I had been incredibly foolish.

 ""Honey? Why are you sitting here in the dark?""

 Maverick was clearly startled when he saw me.

 He frowned, pressing a hand to his temple.

 ""I'm sorry, honey. I worked really late last night. My head's all messed up again.""

 He stepped forward to hug me, but I shifted aside without a word.

 His hand froze midair, then dropped naturally as he sighed.

 ""I was sitting on the bench outside the office for hours. I couldn't remember how to get home. Then, it finally came to me, but then my phone died...""

 What a performance.

 If I hadn't seen him at the hospital earlier, looking perfectly fine, I might have almost felt sorry for him again.

 ""Your phone died?""

 I pointed at the charger on the coffee table. ""Charge it.""

 Maverick hesitated, then pulled out his phone with a guilty look. ""It's fine, I'm exhausted. I just want to shower first...""

 ""Charge it.""

 My voice was calm, but unyielding.

 He probably hadn't seen me like this before. Awkwardly, he plugged in the charger.

 The screen lit up: 65% battery.

 The air went icy still.

 Maverick's expression shifted uncomfortably. He smacked his forehead. ""God, my head. I must've mixed it up. Maybe it died the day before yesterday?

 ""Honey, my memory keeps getting worse. I really... I didn't mean to lie.""

 As he spoke, his eyes reddened. ""Honey, please don't be angry. I hate being like this. I'm terrified that one day I'll forget you, too...""

 There was a time when hearing those words would have broken my heart, and I would have hugged him tightly to comfort him.

 But now, they just made my stomach turn.

 Expressionless, I pointed toward our son's room. ""Chris had a high fever today. He kept asking for you.""

 Maverick avoided my eyes. ""Chris was sick? Is he okay?

 ""I'm so sorry, honey. You must have told me, and I forgot. I'll take him to get a toy tomorrow to make it up to him.""

 He didn't even remember that just last week, Christopher had cried all night because Maverick had promised him a toy, then he forgot all about it.

 ""You forgot again?""

 I stood and moved toward him. ""Do you remember Savannah?""

 Maverick stiffened.

 ""Who? Savannah?"" He pretended to think hard.

 ""That name rings a bell, but I can't place it. Honey, the doctor said I should avoid stress. Just hearing about people from my past gives me headaches.""

 I laughed, but my eyes held no warmth. ""Really? If your head hurts, you should get some rest, Maverick.""

 Panic flashed in Maverick's eyes as he was about to say something.

 But just then the bedroom door opened.

 Christopher stood barefoot in the doorway.

 His fever had just gone down, and his face was still a little pale, yet his eyes were unusually bright.

 ""Dad?"" he called out.

 Maverick hurried over, reaching to pick him up. ""Oh, you're awake? Come here, let me hug you.""

 Christopher stepped back, avoiding his hand.

 Maverick's arm froze mid-air. He forced an awkward smile. ""What's wrong? Are you still mad at me?""

 Christopher stared right at him. ""Dad, did you forget about me again?

“Nothing. He was so intimidated that he crumbled.” Sans expression didn’t change much, but you could tell he was enjoying hearing Klover laugh at his story.

“Exactly.” Sans said with a rough laugh.

“Still, missing cleaning supplies is a problem.” H lifted his steaming mug. He paused before he’d taken a sip. “Really ought to…”

“Shh bruh.” Sans interrupting, motioning towards the TV. “The news is on.”

H sighed and looked up at the Tv as the news banner faded and a small purple creature in a red hat appeared on screen.

“Good afternoon folks.” Snick said. “This just in, Reports of secret nuclear tests over the oceans have come in. Witnesses claim that a missile was launched some time ago, and rapidly changed direction before figures assumed to be Null knights appeared and carried the warhead off. Could this be part of the Eggman war effort?”

“This dang war.” H was tired of waiting. He was glad that it hadn’t broken out yet, but he hated living with the constant thought that he’d have to leave Doll and possibly die defending the company.

He yawned, and took a sip from his hot oil. But his taste buds revolted at the strange taste. He choked and spat the oil out. “Salt?” He said. “Salt in the sugar container??”

“Hah, you’re the first one to notice!” Sans laughed again. H wasn’t. He’d of carved up that bonehead if Klover and Mended hadn’t held him back.

Snick’s live report continued on the Tv. “Up next we’ll cover one of the strangest ‘wait I’m the father’ stories happening to three drones at- What?” Snick looked to something offscreen before turning back to the cameras. “It appears that theres Been a tampered Relay in the nuclear department, and they’re calling all technicians available to help.”

H was going to shrug it off as a joke, but then the intercom came on. “All available technicians to the Nuclear department. Code Orange, this is not a drill.”

H groaned and dumped out his ruined coffee before following Klover and Mended out, leaving sans in the room.

And while I can appreciate those gentle moments, I find myself thinking about love in a slightly different way.

To me, love isn’t just excitement or romance.

It’s responsibility.

It’s trust.

It’s the quiet decision to protect someone’s well-being — not because you’re obligated to, but because their happiness matters to you.

Working in a world where people are constantly measured and judged, I’ve learned that genuine emotion can be fragile. It can be misunderstood. But that doesn’t make it any less powerful.

In fact, I believe love is strongest when it’s steady.

It’s the kind of feeling that doesn’t cloud your judgment — it sharpens it. It makes you want to become someone stronger, more compassionate, more understanding. When you truly care for someone, you want to create a world where they can live safely and freely.

Valentine’s Day reminds me that even in difficult times, there is space for warmth.

A shared cup of coffee after a long day.

A message asking if you got home safely.

A quiet moment where words aren’t needed.

Those things matter more than grand gestures.

I don’t think love should overwhelm you. I think it should ground you. It should give you clarity — the courage to be honest, and the patience to listen.

If I were to express my feelings clearly, I would say this:

I value the people who stand beside me.

I cherish those who trust me.

And I want to continue protecting the bonds that connect us.

Valentine’s Day isn’t just about declaring affection.

It’s about choosing, again and again, to care.

 The story of Abigail Wagner and Lucas Faulkner still circulated in the art and finance worlds—and people shook their heads every time it came up.

 Abigail, a prodigy who shot to fame with a single painting at the Venice Biennale and was once hailed as a once-in-a-generation talent, gave up her future and became a housewife no one took seriously.

 Lucas was a star financial advisor managing portfolios worth billions, a man who lived for charts, projections, and returns. To him, people barely registered.

 They were a completely mismatched couple.

 But Abigail refused to believe it and loved him with everything she had.

 Because of Lucas's fragile stomach, she set down her brushes and took up the apron, moving from the canvas to the kitchen. Hands once stained with oil paint now smelled permanently of dish soap.

 When he was negotiating deals and got forced to drink, she waited in the freezing snow for three hours just to hand him a warm hangover soup—earning nothing but mocking remarks like, ""So the great painter Ms. Wagner is a driver now?""

 That year, she almost gave up.

 But on the night she was packing her bags, Lucas, burning with fever, grabbed her clothes. Only then did she realize that even this eternally rational man could look so helpless.

 That single look cost her another five years.

 Today was the fifth anniversary of their marriage.

 Abigail booked the place Lucas had once casually praised.

 She waited from early morning until the city lights came on.

 Her messages went unanswered. She called 30 times, yet all she got was the same mechanical voice saying, ""The subscriber you dialed is busy.""

 The waiters cleared away the cold dishes, pity plain in their eyes.

 ""Everything has a shelf life, Ma'am—hot meals and human feelings alike,"" the owner said softly, handing her a cup of water.

 Abigail's fingers trembled, but she stubbornly drove to Lucas's office building anyway.

 The moment she turned off the engine, her phone lit up.

 After being out of touch all day, Lucas finally replied with two words—""Working late.""

 Abigail looked up at his office on the top floor, where he spent most of his time, and forced a bitter smile.

 Then a notification popped up. Adrienne Parrish, Lucas's new intern, had posted on social media.

 The photo showed a celebration dinner for a successful funding round. Beside a champagne tower, Lucas was caught mid-smile—a rare sight.

 The caption read, ""Mr. Faulkner says he'll never miss any important moment in my growth. I'm grateful.""

 Through the floor-to-ceiling windows, a landmark building loomed, right across from the restaurant Abigail had booked.

 While Abigail waited anxiously in that private room, gradually sinking into despair, he was across the street, celebrating with another woman.

 Abigail's eyes burned with tears as she locked the screen and turned the car around for home.

 When she walked in, Lucas was already on the couch, rubbing his temples. Clearly, he had only just returned.

 Seeing her, he frowned. ""Where did you go? It's almost midnight. You know how much I hate being disturbed by someone coming home late.""

 Standing in the entryway, Abigail stared at the faint champagne stain on his collar. The despair she'd held back all night finally washed over her. ""Have you ever remembered what day it is?""

 Before he could answer, his phone rang.

 The caller ID read, ""Addie.""

 Abigail's nerves snapped. She rushed over, pressing her hand over his, tears welling in her eyes. ""Don't answer it.""

 Lucas clicked his tongue impatiently. ""Stop it."" Then, he pushed her aside and answered the call.

 Adrienne said something, and as soon as the call ended, he snatched his coat and got up.

 ""So one call from Adrienne is enough to get you out in the middle of the night?"" Abigail blocked his path, her voice hoarse. ""I waited for you all day like an idiot. And this is what I get?""

 Lucas paused mid-motion as he put on his coat. He turned around, his gaze filled with the weary scrutiny typical of those in power.

 ""The IPO Adrienne is handling is at a critical stage. It's a key project for the company this year,"" he said flatly. ""Abigail, can you act your age? The value I'm talking about isn't something you can produce by doodling at home.""

 When he reached for the door, Abigail threw away her last shred of dignity and hugged him from behind. ""Luke, the project can wait for one night. Please... don't leave.""

 Sensing her trembling, Lucas hesitated for only a second before calmly prying her fingers off one by one.

 ""Don't be unreasonable. I have to go.""

 ""Lucas, if you walk out that door tonight, we're getting divorced."" Abigail let go, her voice turning cold, carrying the resolve of someone who had nothing left to lose.

 Lucas stopped in his tracks.

 He stood in the doorway and turned back against the light. His expression was cold, edged with the impatience he reserved for the unreasonable.

 ""Abigail,"" he said lightly, ""you were the one who insisted on being with me, weren't you?""

 The door opened. Cold air rushed in, cutting straight through her thin shirt.

 ""Do whatever you want,"" he said.

 This time, he left more decisively than ever.

 The chime of the smart lock echoed through the house. Abigail stood alone in the empty living room, her ears ringing.

 Almost without thinking, she grabbed her keys and drove straight to the club Adrienne had posted about.

 She couldn't get into the main hall, so she stood outside, watching and listening through the floor-to-ceiling glass.

 She caught a vague glimpse of Lucas, never one to let a woman get close, leaning slightly forward.

 ""Next time you step in to take drinks for me at these business events, be a little smarter. If you end up with a stomachache, I'm the one who has to take care of you.""

 He brought a glass of warm water to Adrienne's lips with practiced ease.

 ""Don't be mad, Mr. Faulkner,"" Adrienne cooed. ""You were supposed to go home and celebrate your anniversary tonight with Mrs. Faulkner. I was worried you'd drink too much, so I helped you out. Wasn't I thoughtful?""

 Abigail saw Lucas pause for a moment before replying nonchalantly, ""Don't bother with her.""

 Adrienne laughed softly and leaned closer to his shoulder. ""Since Mrs. Faulkner is already asleep, could you stay tonight? I'm sick and all alone in a strange city. I'm kind of scared.""

 Abigail stared at them, unmoving.

 She thought he would refuse.

 But he didn't. He even reached out to steady Adrienne. ""You're such a baby. Come on. I'll take you home.""

 As the two of them walked out, leaning on each other, Abigail instinctively stepped back into the shadow behind a pillar.

 She watched until Lucas's car disappeared down the road. They were headed toward Adrienne's apartment.

 Abigail knew that the apartment was under Lucas's name. It had once been her secret hideaway with him.

 It turned out that her waiting, her breakdown, and her threat meant nothing to him.

 She had believed that seven years together would be enough to soften even the hardest heart.

 Tonight, she finally realized she would never win him over.

 She suddenly remembered the day she and Lucas finally got together.

 He said he didn't want it public, so she pretended not to know him outside. He said he hated the smell of paint at home, so she shut down her studio.

 It had been seven years.

 She had poured everything into him, and all she got back was the sting of being called desperate.

 Abigail sat on the steps outside the club all night long.

 When dawn broke, she stood up and brushed the dust from her pants.

 She took out her phone and dialed a number she had not called in seven years.

 ""Armando, help me contact the auction house. Put the remaining paintings from my studio up for sale, and draft a divorce agreement for me.""

 She was done pouring herself into the hollow void of a one-sided love.

 She was leaving Lucas.

Chapter 2

 On the third day after moving into the hotel, Abigail still hadn't stepped outside her room.

 Like a form of self-imposed punishment, she pulled out every photo she'd taken of Lucas over the past few years and forced herself to examine them one by one. Her therapist had once called it ""desensitization."" As long as one hurt themselves badly enough, eventually the nerves would go numb.

 On the evening of the fourth day, the door was kicked open.

 Bethany Murphy stormed in with a bottle of vodka in hand. One look at the wrecked room, and the veins on her forehead started bulging.

 She said, ""Abigail, look at yourself. What the hell have you turned into?""

 She slammed the bottle onto the table, grabbed Abigail by the collar, and shook her. ""You used to be the famous Abigail. Now you're chasing one man like your life depends on it. What? Lucas cheating on you once isn't enough? Do you need to go through more of it before you're satisfied?""

 Dizzy from the shaking, Abigail laughed hoarsely. She grabbed the bottle and took a long swig. ""Bethany, do you think... I'm a total failure?

 ""I stopped painting for him and forced myself to learn finance reports I never cared about. And what did I get? He still thinks I do nothing all day. Adrienne steps in to take a few drinks for him, and he frets about her for hours. Me? Other than that old reputation, I honestly feel like I've got nothing left.""

 She went back over those seven years, and to her own shock, they were nothing but a blank.

 Maybe there was a reason Lucas looked down on her after all.

 She couldn't keep up with him anymore. She didn't understand the ruthless world of early-stage capital markets. She couldn't help his career at all.

 ""Bullshit!"" Bethany snapped. ""Have you been gaslit so hard that you can't think straight anymore? Back then, the entire art world worshipped you. If you hadn't sold 'Genesis' to save Lucas's trash company, would you have disappeared?

 ""Overseas galleries are still asking where you are. Your name is still trending on ArtPrice.

 ""You're talented, you've got taste, you're beautiful, and most of all, your heart is real. Tell me, what about you isn't good enough for that cold-blooded bastard?""

 Abigail froze. ""I... Can I still paint?""

 ""Of course you can!"" Bethany snapped, furious at her. ""He's been tearing you down for so long that you don't even realize it. Tell me, when you're around him, do you even dare wear something bold and expensive anymore?""

 Abigail looked down at the dull, shapeless lounge clothes she had on.

 Lucas liked everything minimalist and looked down on anything flashy, so she'd replaced her entire wardrobe with black, white, and gray.

 ""Come on,"" she said suddenly, pushing the bottle away and wobbling to her feet. ""Let's go shopping. I want the most expensive dress in the store.""

 She'd been trapped for too long by rules she set just to please him that she'd almost forgotten she used to be a free bird.

 Inside the VIP lounge of a top-tier luxury mall, Abigail picked out a deep burgundy silk dress. The cut was daring, fluid, like fire made fabric.

 She was just about to ask the sales associate to wrap it up when a familiar voice sounded behind her.

 ""Mr. Faulkner, that dress looks amazing.""

 Abigail's body stiffened. She turned around and met Lucas's calm, unreadable gaze.

 Adrienne was hooked around his arm. When she saw Abigail, she covered her mouth in exaggerated surprise. ""Oh! Mrs. Faulkner, you're here too? Mr. Faulkner has been pulling all-nighters for that project. Shouldn't you be taking care of him instead of shopping?""

 Abigail didn't bother responding. She glanced once at their intimate posture, then turned and handed her card to the sales associate. ""I'll take it.""

 Just then, Lucas grabbed her wrist.

 ""That dress doesn't suit you,"" Lucas said casually, as if it were a given. ""It's too flashy. Let Adrienne have it. She's doing a roadshow next week and needs something presentable.""

 The warmth on her wrist felt like a branding iron, burning enough to chill her to the bone.

 Abigail stared at him and enunciated every word. ""I want this dress.""

 When she stepped out after changing, Bethany had just parked and come up. She took one look at Abigail and let out a whistle. ""Now that's the Ms. Wagner the art world knows. You look dangerously good!""

 Lucas looked at the woman in front of him, momentarily stunned by how unfamiliar and striking she looked. Then his brow furrowed.

 Adrienne caught the flicker in his eyes immediately. She lowered her head, voice soft and wounded. ""Mrs. Faulkner looks incredible. She's like a movie star... I'm not like that. Even if I wore it, I probably wouldn't pull it off.""

 Lucas snapped back to himself, his expression darkening. ""Abigail, take it off.""

 His tone hardened. ""Don't make me repeat myself. Adrienne represents the company's image. You barely go out, so what's the point of wearing something this expensive?""

 Bethany stepped in front of Abigail and laughed coldly. ""Why not? Mr. Faulkner, you're worth billions. Are you telling me you can't buy a dress for your little office darling? Do you really have to take Abby's? Or are you just trying to get her to pay again?""

 Adrienne's face went pale. Her eyes reddened instantly as she tugged on Lucas's sleeve. ""Mr. Faulkner, it's okay. Don't argue with Mrs. Faulkner because of me... She's already upset about that night you drove me home...""

 Lucas patted the back of her hand and turned to the sales associate. He said, ""Wrap up every size of this dress. Except for the one Abigail is wearing, let Adrienne pick the rest.""

 Watching how effortlessly he took Adrienne's side, Abigail felt like her heart was being cut open with a dull blade.

 She said, ""No need.""

 Suddenly, the dress felt filthy on her skin.

 She changed out of it in record time, tossed it onto the couch, grabbed Bethany, who was ready to explode, and turned to leave.

 Abigail said coolly, ""Since she likes picking up what other people leave behind, she can have all of it.""

 Lucas watched her walk away. For some reason, what lingered in his mind wasn't her words, but the vacant look in her eyes.

 ""Wait,"" he called to the sales associate. ""Take a similar style to the one that lady just tried on and wrap it up.""

Chapter 3

 Abigail's good mood was completely wrecked, so Bethany dragged her up to the rooftop revolving restaurant.

 ""Is that man blind?"" Bethany snapped, cutting at her steak so hard the knife screeched against the plate. ""He throws away a gem like you and goes out of his way to pamper that bitch intern?""

 Abigail stared out at the night skyline, drained and silent.

 Bad luck never came alone.

 They had barely sat down when Lucas walked over with Adrienne.

 ""What a coincidence, Mrs. Faulkner,"" Adrienne said, flashing that smile that always made people uneasy. ""I mentioned in passing that I wanted to try their beef Wellington, and Mr. Faulkner brought me right over. Guess we have similar tastes.""

 Lucas was holding a refined shopping bag. Seeing Abigail's cold expression, he did something rare and handed it to her. ""You left in a hurry earlier. I asked the sales associate to bring out a similar new design. Don't take what I said before to heart.""

 ""Mrs. Faulkner, don't be mad at Mr. Faulkner,"" Adrienne chimed in gently. ""He really cares about you. When he was picking clothes, he only looked at your size.""

 Abigail didn't take the bag or look at Lucas. She only turned to the waiter and said, ""Please move us to another table. The air here is bad.""

 Lucas's hand froze in midair, and his expression darkened.

 ""Abigail, that's enough,"" he said in a low voice. ""Can you at least give me some dignity in public?""

 ""Dignity?"" Abigail finally looked up, her eyes full of mockery. ""So your dignity comes from stealing your wife's dress to give to an intern? Who am I to give you any?""

 ""You—"" Lucas choked.

 ""Mrs. Faulkner, I know you don't like me,"" Adrienne said, her eyes reddening on cue. ""But Mr. Faulkner works so hard for the company. Even if you don't support him as family, why embarrass him like this?""

 The act made Abigail nauseous.

 She stood up and looked down at Adrienne. ""Family? Not for long. Your little tricks might fool Lucas, but that's because he's emotionally illiterate.""

 At that, she turned to leave.

 Lucas grabbed her wrist, his voice sharp with urgency. ""Abigail, what exactly are you making a scene about? Adrienne and I are completely innocent.""

 ""Let go."" She didn't even bother struggling. She just stared at him coldly.

 Adrienne rushed in as well. ""Mrs. Faulkner, don't treat Mr. Faulkner like this—""

 In the chaos, Adrienne somehow yanked Abigail's arm. The two of them stumbled together toward a decorative fountain with sharp stone edges.

 ""Abigail!""

 ""Watch out!""

 Two shouts rang out.

 Lucas was the closest. Just as he instinctively reached out to grab Abigail, Adrienne suddenly screamed, ""My hand! Mr. Faulkner, I think my hand's broken...""

 Lucas's hand veered midair, and he caught Adrienne instead.

 Abigail fell hard into the fountain. When her right hand slammed into the jagged marble at the bottom, there was a sickening crack.

 Blinding pain exploded through her body, and cold sweat soaked her instantly.

 Bethany rushed over and dragged her out of the water. When she saw Abigail's arm hanging at an unnatural angle, her eyes went red. She screamed, ""Are you out of your mind, Lucas? That's the hand Abigail uses to paint! And you chose to grab that useless woman instead?""

 Lucas went pale. He stared at the hand he'd praised countless times, now limp and broken. His heart skipped.

 ""I...""

 ""Mr. Faulkner, it hurts so bad..."" Adrienne whimpered in his arms. ""Am I never going to be able to help you with reports again?""

 Lucas clenched his jaw. Avoiding Abigail's unfocused, pain-filled gaze, he lifted Adrienne into his arms. ""Adrienne is injured. She needs to go to the hospital right now. Abigail... take a cab yourself. I'll reimburse the costs.""

 With that, he rushed off with Adrienne, not daring to look back even once.

 Abigail leaned against Bethany, her vision fading.

 At that moment, it wasn't just her hand that broke.

 The string in her heart called ""love"" snapped clean through.

 At the hospital, the doctor shook his head as he studied the scans.

 He said, ""It's a fracture, and it's in a bad spot. If you don't have surgery, forget holding a paintbrush. Even using a fork will be difficult.""

 Bethany cursed nonstop in the hallway.

 Abigail lay on the bed, still groggy from anesthesia.

 When she woke again, arguing voices came from outside the room.

 ""Lucas, you've got some nerve showing up. Get out!"" Bethany yelled.

 ""I'm her husband. I have the right to know her condition,"" Lucas replied, sounding tired. ""I just settled things on Adrienne's side. I didn't expect Abigail to get hurt this badly.""

 ""You didn't expect it? If you'd grabbed her back then, would she be like this now?""

 The door pushed open.

 Lucas walked in. When he saw Abigail's arm in a cast, something flickered in his eyes.

 He set a fruit basket by the bed and softened his tone. ""Does it still hurt? Adrienne only has soft tissue injuries. She didn't mean it. Can you stop holding it against her? As compensation, I'll go with you to that art exhibition once your hand heals.""

 Abigail stared at the ceiling, not sparing him a glance.

 ""Say something,"" he said irritably. ""I've already compromised. What more do you want?""

 ""She broke my hand, and you're worried I'll 'hold it against her'?"" Abigail finally turned her head. Her calm was terrifying. ""Lucas, did you sign the divorce papers?""

 Lucas's body stiffened, and then he sneered. ""You want a divorce over this? Abigail, where do you think you can go without me? Back to that rundown studio to starve?""

 ""That's none of Mr. Faulkner's concern,"" Abigail said, closing her eyes. ""Get out.""

 He called her name through gritted teeth, ""Abigail!""

 ""Get out!"" Her eyes flew open, filled with a viciousness he had never seen before. ""Take your mistress and get out of my sight!""

Chapter 4

 The ward reeked of disinfectant. Abigail stared at the ceiling, her mind blank.

 That night, Bethany stormed in with a grim expression, thrusting her phone in front of Abigail's face as she paced angrily in circles.

 ""I swear, I've seen everything now. Does Lucas even have a heart? He took Adrienne to Sycamore Studio!""

 Abigail's chest tightened as she looked at the video on the screen.

 In it, Adrienne wore a painter's apron, holding a brush and working on a canvas. In the background, Lucas stood by the window with a cup of coffee, watching her paint with a gentle gaze. Sunlight washed over them, serene and intimate in a way that stabbed straight into the eyes.

 Sycamore Studio had once been Abigail's private studio. It was the last place she stayed before she put down her brush for good. All her inspiration was there, along with her unfinished ""Muse"" series.

 Back then, to keep Lucas's company from collapsing, she made the painful decision to sell off the studio and every painting inside it.

 ""I checked,"" Bethany said softly, fury simmering under her voice. ""Lucas bought the studio back half a month ago for 8 million dollars.""

 He paid 8 million dollars in full.

 For a casual comment from Adrienne about wanting to learn painting, he could throw down 8 million dollars without blinking. Yet for seven years, whenever Abigail wanted to buy better-quality paints, he'd scolded her for being ""unfocused"" and ""wasting time.""

 ""The studio's his now,"" Abigail said softly. Her fingers were ice-cold. ""Who he lets use it is his business.""

 Her phone vibrated. A text from Lucas popped up. ""How's your hand? There's a company press event in a couple of days. Be ready.""

 Abigail didn't reply. She blocked and deleted every one of his contact methods.

 Right after that, the overseas curator who'd been handling her work for years called.

 ""Ms. Wagner, about your comeback exhibition... The sponsors heard about your hand injury and want to pull out. What do you think?""

 Abigail was silent for a moment.

 She'd almost forgotten. Several of Lucas's biggest deals over the years had come through connections she quietly leveraged for him. Those people greenlit projects because of her, not him.

 ""Let them pull out,"" she said evenly. ""I'm tired. I don't want to paint anymore.""

 After hanging up, she looked at Bethany.

 She said softly, ""Before I met Lucas, I thought talent could outweigh everything.

 ""These past years, I was afraid he'd be looked down on for his background. I worked myself to the bone behind the scenes, smoothing the road for him. I thought if I made it flat enough, he'd walk more easily and maybe look back at me once.""

 She remembered rewriting business proposals late at night so he wouldn't notice and drinking herself into a stomach bleed at banquets just to help him secure funding.

 Her eyes suddenly burned.

 It wasn't for him, but for the proud, untouchable version she used to be.

 Bethany patted her shoulder without a word. Her eyes were red as well.

 On the day she was discharged, fate had a cruel sense of humor.

 Adrienne was waiting at the hospital entrance with a box of expensive mineral pigments. She wore the dress she'd taken, standing beside Lucas like a student who'd done something wrong.

 Nurses and patients whispered as they passed.

 ""Isn't that Mr. Faulkner? That girl next to him looks so young. Is she his new girlfriend?""

 ""Who's the one with her arm in a cast? His ex-wife?""

 Lucas frowned, about to explain, when Abigail walked out.

 Adrienne rushed over immediately, guilt written all over her face. ""Mrs. Faulkner, I'm so sorry. It was my fault that day. I heard you used to be a painter, so I asked around and bought this limited-edition mineral blue to make it up to you...""

 As she spoke, she opened the box.

 A sharp chemical odor filled the air.

 Abigail's facial expression changed instantly. She clutched her mouth and nose, coughing violently. Her breathing turned ragged, and angry red rashes bloomed along her neck.

 She was severely allergic to unrefined mineral pigments. It could even trigger asthma. Lucas knew this.

 ""Take it away..."" Abigail staggered back, face drained of color.

 The box fell to the ground, and blue powder scattered everywhere.

 Adrienne looked helplessly at Lucas, tears welling up again. ""I didn't know... I meant well. Mr. Faulkner said you might like it...""

 Abigail's heart went cold as she looked at Lucas.

 So he had never even remembered why she had gone into allergic shock and been rushed to the ER.

 A flicker of panic crossed Lucas's face. He instinctively reached out to help her. ""I forgot you're allergic to this. Adrienne didn't know either—""

 Abigail slapped his hand away.

 The suffocating tightness in her chest mixed with heartbreak. She looked at him, and the last bit of light in her eyes went out.

 ""If you don't even remember something this basic, don't pretend you ever cared,"" she said coldly. ""Lucas, we're getting divorced.""

 With that, supported by Bethany, she got into the car without looking back.

 Lucas stood frozen. When he heard the word ""divorce,"" a panic he'd never felt before surged up his spine.

 Before he could process it, his phone rang.

 It was from the PR department. ""Mr. Faulkner, this is bad! Someone online just exposed you for cheating during your marriage and letting your mistress humiliate your wife at the hospital. The stock price is dropping!""

 That night, a post titled, ""The Price of Marrying Into Wealth: How a Once-Gifted Painter Was Cast Aside.""

Chapter 5

 That night, Lucas's Maybach stopped downstairs at the hotel where Abigail was staying.

 The receptionist couldn't stop him. He barged into the room with his bodyguards.

 Abigail was propped against the headboard, taking her medication. Her face was pale as paper.

 ""Come with me,"" Lucas said coldly, his tone edged with command. ""The press conference starts in an hour.""

 She didn't even lift her eyes. ""I already told you. We're getting divorced. Whether your stock price crashes or not has nothing to do with me.""

 Lucas took a deep breath, pulled out a velvet box, and opened it to reveal a woman's ring.

 ""Stop throwing a tantrum. As long as you cooperate tonight and help me clear things up, I'll give Sycamore Studio back to you. I'll also invest in your solo exhibition.""

 He grabbed her uninjured left hand and forcefully tried to slide the ring onto her ring finger.

 It was a ring from five years ago, and after years of exhaustion and illness, Abigail's knuckles had subtly changed shape.

 The ring got stuck at the joint and wouldn't go down.

 Lucas frowned and pressed harder.

 She gasped sharply as the skin over her knuckle split, blood immediately seeping out.

 He acted as if he didn't see it, focused only on finishing the task. ""Bear with it. Tonight, all you need to do is stand next to me, smile, say our relationship is fine, and that Adrienne is just a key trainee at the company.""

 Abigail looked at the ring digging into her flesh and suddenly laughed.

 She laughed so hard her eyes filled with tears.

 ""Lucas, is this what I am to you?"" she asked softly. ""A dog that will wag its tail as long as you toss it a treat, even if you break its bones?""

 His hand paused. He avoided her gaze, the kind that seemed to see straight through him.

 ""If that's how you want to see it, I can't help you,"" he said coolly. ""Mr. Melendez already made it clear that if public opinion doesn't calm down tonight, the financing is off. You know how important that is to me.""

 ""Important enough to sacrifice my dignity?"" she asked.

 ""This isn't a sacrifice. It's doing what's necessary for the bigger picture,"" he said flatly. ""And there's still a final payment on Bethany's project sitting with me. Whether she gets it or not depends entirely on how you perform.""

 That sentence hit her dead center.

 Abigail was dragged to the press conference by force.

 Under the glaring lights, her eyes stung. She wore an elegant dress, but her right arm was in a cast, hanging from a sling, painfully out of place.

 Below the stage, cameras and microphones were everywhere.

 ""Ms. Wagner, how do you respond to the online rumors about Mr. Faulkner and intern Adrienne?""

 ""Some people say you're a gold digger who lives off the Faulkner family. Is that true?""

 ""There are reports that you hurt yourself to try to keep Mr. Faulkner. What do you say to that?""

 The questions came like knives.

 The narrative online had already been steered by the PR department. Adrienne was painted as a hardworking and ambitious newcomer, Lucas was the generous mentor, and Abigail had become the jealous, hysterical housewife who had lost her mind.

 Under the table, Lucas grabbed her left hand and squeezed, signaling her to read from the script.

 Abigail looked at Adrienne in the audience. That innocent face couldn't hide the satisfaction underneath.

 She slowly opened her mouth and said, ""The photos were staged. Lucas and I... are fine.""

 At that moment, she heard the sound of her own dignity shattering.

 For the sake of the final payment on Bethany's project, the one Lucas was holding hostage, she gave in.

 After the press conference, backstage, Adrienne rushed over with red-rimmed eyes, full of gratitude. ""Thank you, Mrs. Faulkner. I knew you were the most reasonable person.""

 Abigail shoved her away coldly. ""Stay away from me.""

 Adrienne conveniently fell backward, crashing into a champagne tower.

He married our grandma and migrated to the city we live in now. We also knew he had kids from his previous wife (RIP). I have recently connected with one of their kids (long story how), an old man now, via a Facebook group. We had a call, and he told me that my grandma actually murdered the first wife. She pushed her under a running horse and later denied it and said she just fell in front of the horse. After that, she married our grandpa, then they moved to the city we live in now. This might explain why grandpa never wanted to give us any details about our origins. My father asked him if he had any land “back home"", inheritance, and he told him ""I sold everything and bought alcohol with all the money"". A while after they moved to our city, my grandpa worked as a guard in a cemetery, fell in an old, abandoned well, got paralyzed because of the fall, lost his vision (I don't know how), but lived 102 years. He was very nice to us, but my grandma was a devil. She practiced dark magic, a witch, everyone knows it. I was once in her kitchen, and I found so many dead chameleons. We had a fig tree behind our house and they climb and fall into our backyard. She has once caught one and immediately fed it tons of salt to kill and dry it. She very openly said that she grinds them into a powder, mixes the powder with coffee and tea that she serves to her guests. She said that makes them love her and always visit.

We get on well and sit next to each other in lessons but whenever I plan to ask her out i put so much pressure on myself that I get so nervous and chicken out.

Tomorrow is Valentines day and I was wondering if I should message her. Its a bit late to ask her to be my Valentines or anything silly, but I wondered if I should send her an instagram dm and ask if she wanted to go out for coffee sometime over the break.

My worry is that I've messaged her before on instagram DM (we do follow each other) and she hasn't seen it, so either she doesn't want to talk me or genuinely doesn't use instagram. Knowing her somewhat well in person, it feels unlikely she would just ignore it, but who knows. Then again, I know she uses instagram quite a bit, and even though we get on well in person, I honestly doubt she likes me. I don't know.

It also may be weird as I've sent her a message about a week ago, basically just saying I've wanted to chat more and saying hi, so it could be weird to send her another one, even though this would make sense in context.

The other thought I had that I could do would be to ask her something via messages about schoolwork, but this has the same problem of her not seeing it. It also would try and start a conversation rather than ask her out, which may be better.

It could be best to stop worrying over the break and just try and get the confidence afterwards but I doubt I will. Its also a little while to wait.

I think I'd like to message her at some point to at the very least start a conversatiom but I'm worried she won't see it or it'll come across as weird, so wanted to see what people thought.

This is basically a kids film. At times, I feel like I’m watching something on Disney or Nickelodeon. I mean, nothing feels sophisticated or mature about it. It’s a caricature of the band. The dialogue and acting are all so hammy. And don’t get me started on that stupid coffee machine scene. Like what?

How about that scene where Rami Malek and his crazy eyes are starting into space and then randomly utters “that’s good”, presumably thinking about the lyrics of Bo Rap.

And the high drama scene where Freddie fires his manager in the back of the limo. I was watching all this thinking “wtf is going on. Who reacts like that?”

Anyway, I’m just wondering if at some point in the future, the Queen story gets a proper and true treatment via a streaming series. Perhaps without Brian’s involvement this time. While I wasn’t quite sure how to feel about Borat playing Freddie in the initial plans, I would be definitely interested in the story he had proposed, a warts and all telling of Freddie’s story. 

I’d really like to see a more personal story, particularly about the members in the formative years, in their 60s pre-Queen period. I think that would have a lot of potential there, with swinging London as the backdrop.

I am new to this hobby and have been doing some research online but can't find an answer to a specific query. 

I recently bought a Stilosa 260 and have a Kingrinder K6 on the way. I want to upgrade the portafilter and found some online with a '14-16g' basket. I watched Lance Hendricks video on the Stilosa and he mentioned about ideally getting an 18g basket for preferable depth/aspect ratio akin to 25g in a 58mm portafilter. The thing is I don't like to overboard on espresso so would prefer having single shots. Is it simply a case that I need to manage my expectations if I get a smaller basket with around 7-9g of coffee in it or am I missing something?

1r4htxc,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheImprovementRoom/comments/1r4htxc/i_trained_my_focus_like_a_muscle_for_60_days/,I trained my focus like a muscle for 60 days. These are the results.,"Two months ago, I couldn't focus on anything meaningful for more than 15 minutes without reaching for my phone. My attention was fragmented, my work was suffering, and I constantly felt behind. So I decided to treat my focus like a muscle and systematically train it for 60 days.

The results have been genuinely life-changing, so I wanted to share what actually worked:

The baseline test:

* Day 1: Could only work deeply for 18 minutes before mental resistance became overwhelming
* Distractions were constant (checked phone 34 times in a 3-hour work block)
* Required multiple cups of coffee to maintain even basic concentration
* Felt mentally exhausted after just 3-4 hours of ""work"" (which was mostly distracted pseudo-work)

The training protocol:

* Started with just 25 minutes of completely undistracted work using the Pomodoro technique
* Phone in another room, notifications off, single-tasking only
* After each successful session, recorded how it felt and any resistance I encountered
* Gradually increased duration as my ""focus muscle"" strengthened
* By week 4, moved to 45-minute sessions with 10-minute breaks
* By week 7, could comfortably do 90-minute deep work blocks

The environment hacks:

* Created a ""start ritual"" (lighting a specific candle, putting on specific instrumental music)
* Used noise-cancelling headphones even in quiet environments as a psychological trigger
* Kept a distraction log to identify patterns (hunger, specific websites, times of day)
* Implemented website blockers during deep work sessions
* Placed a physical timer in view to create urgency and track sessions

The unexpected benefits:

* Sleep quality dramatically improved (apparently my brain was exhausted from constant task-switching)
* General anxiety decreased about 60%
* Regained the ability to read books for hours (hadn't done this since college)
* Work quality noticeably improved (colleagues have commented)
* Discovered I actually enjoy challenging work when fully engaged

Where I am now:

* Can consistently work deeply for 90-minute stretches
* Complete more meaningful work in 4 hours than I previously did in 8
* Require less caffeine to maintain focus
* Feel mentally energized rather than drained after work sessions
* Have developed a genuine enjoyment of the deep work state

The key insight was treating focus as a trainable skill rather than something you either have or don't have. Just like you wouldn't expect to bench press 200 pounds without training, you can't expect to focus deeply without progressively training that ability.

I don’t know how to go about it other than at length. But you know what they say, never underestimate Reddit’s attention span!

Also, I am definitely not seeking a diagnosis online. I already have and definitely will consult further with experts to figure out what’s up, but at this moment I am seeking some sort of support and advice because I feel a bit lost.

As the title suggests, my girlfriend and I are expecting our baby girl who is scheduled to arrive mid-July. The fact that I'm going to be a parent alongside the best person I've met is about the most remarkable thing that has ever happened to me. Because of this, I want to get a grip on some things, sleep and general fatigue wise that have gotten out of hand lately.

Especially because I am very much aware that I am most likely not going to be having any sleep very soon.

Briefly- no matter how long I sleep, I wake up really, really tired. Ever since I had some sort of respiratory infection back in October, it's been worse. I've been experiencing problems with my gut since then which almost certainly is connected, but more on that below. When I go to bed, I generally fall asleep within a minute or two, so I presume I'm dead tired all the time.

I'm asking for help because I feel frustrated and somewhat paralyzed in the sense that I don't know what to try and where to start in an attempt to figure out what's causing these issues. This in turn worries me because I want to be in a far better state when the baby comes, and at the moment I'm feeling like I'm a hostage of something and I don’t know what exactly.

Because I think this most likely isn’t an isolated thing, I'll try and bullet point literally anything that comes to mind in terms of my habits and circumstances, in case someone had a similar situation, starting from recent issues to general stuff.

In an attempt to make this long-winded text somewhat more engaging, I’ll approach this as a whodunit. Perhaps there is one culprit, perhaps there are more. But one thing is for certain dear readers-there IS a troublemaker in their midst. 

Thank you to anyone that takes the time to read this and offer sage advice!

**Suspect 1** \- The Gut

I had some kind of a respiratory infection in October. After my throat lit up three times in a week, I was treated with antibiotics after which I experienced severe problems with reflux, bloating, heartburn, flatulence, slight nausea, light headaches and all that good stuff. I had problems with reflux before, but never to this extent and never so consistently.

Because of this I went to a gastroenterologist a month and a half ago who told me it might be ""post infection IBS"", because all my lab results and an endoscopy came out clean. Since then, it’s been going up and down and I’m trying to figure out what’s the problem here. Is it my diet, a specific ingredient that doesn’t suit me and is exacerbating whatever is happening inside or something else.

Also, because a painful sensation a couple of days ago I went to my dentist’s who told me that the enamel on one of my teeth has been damaged,which seemed strange to both of us because my teeth are healthy and I have good dental hygiene. She told me it’s almost certainly due to the acid which leads me to believe that this is something that’s probably draining my organism in the background without me noticing it, especially at night. But I don’t know anything about this and whether or not I’m just taking a blind guess.

Something obviously “happened” with my gut because after October, it feels different. and I’m trying to figure out what exactly. The doctor prescribed therapy for the heartburn which I’m starting with tomorrow so we’ll see if that helps. 

Also important to note, I didn’t experience any weight loss or loss of appetite.

**Suspect 2** \- The nose

I had a severely deviated septum up until three years ago (doc said one of the heaviest he's seen), went into surgery and it was successfully fixed. Since then, my breathing has improved greatly in terms that I can now breathe on both nostrils, but I still have problems with mucus that sometimes more or less clogs one of my nostrils. Also, allergic to dust and mites.

**Suspect 3** \- The mind

I've had a very active mind ever since I was a kid and sleep has always been a topic for me. Never formally diagnosed with ADHD, but there were indications (light dyslexia and dysgraphia, restlessness etc.). Tend to have difficulty shutting off and I've tried transcendental meditation although I don't practice it ATM, which I should. For the past few weeks I've been having much more vivid dreams which as I understand is a sign that my mind is working overtime.

I've been to psychotherapy in the past and have benefited from it greatly. Learned to set boundaries and got in touch with myself. Stopped for a while because I felt like I was ok without it but have reached out to my therapist and will be seeing her next week and will continue to see her through this time. I’m generally in touch with my emotions and know if there is something being suppressed. However, I tend to be hyper sensitive towards the people I care about, which leads me to…

**Suspect 4** \- The nerves 

The pregnancy is progressing well in the most important sense, the baby is doing great, but my partner is experiencing really heavy nausea that is present basically throughout the whole day. She is doing great mentally and I am giving my all to support her in every way shape of form (preparing meals, taking on chores etc.) but physically she is completely drained. Whether or not I am in some way overly “empathising” with her at this moment, I can’t say for sure. Maybe it is a more important factor than I’d care to admit because my “defenses” are down due to suspect number 1, and as I said, I have vicarious tendencies, so to speak.

Also, a lot of stuff has been going on simultaneously in terms of life stuff- a stressful period at work (which has now stabilized greatly), handling where we’re going to live in the long term and a couple of other things. It has however cooled down and I know everything’s gonna be good, because it really is. Even though I’m feeling drained at the moment and can’t process it fully.

**Suspect 5**\- The body

Don't smoke, never drank coffee or alcohol and try to have a pretty varied diet. I eat oatmeal with greek yoghurt, fruit, home made honey and chia seeds as a basic breakfast every day. I try not to eat too close to when I go to bed (although had a few slip ups lately and I think it wrecked me)  and I never eat spicy foods. I'm 34 years of age, 6 foot 1/186cm weighing 78kgs/172 pounds.

My doctor advised me to start food journaling which I began as of a couple of days ago. I suspect dairy might be problematic (which means Greek yoghurt has been replaced with almond milk), and deep fried and greasy foods have wrecked me 4 times in the past month which means I’m avoiding them like the plague going forward. (took perhaps a couple of times too many but hey, better late than never)

The thing that I can feel I’m doing wrong is that I’m lacking some sort of physical activity. For the past months, because of all of this, I literally couldn’t bring myself to engage in any exercise. I feel pretty weak and this is something I have to address as it could likely be a bigger part of the puzzle than I thought. The only thing I did was get in 5-6k steps per day with some spikes here and there. ( I love to walk a lot and hike)

I just talked to a close friend yesterday who is a certified kettlebell instructor and incredibly knowledgeable in all things fitness and diet. He’ll set up a basic program for me, adjusted to my current state, and I’ll commit to training three days a week. Up until this point it was kind of a Catch 22 - I can’t exercise because I’m tired and I’m tired because I can’t exercise. But I think I have to break through that initial wall of discomfort and fatigue and engage. I can’t think of a better motivation than the fact someone’s coming this summer.

I've been avoiding typing this post for a while because I either tried to soldier on in hopes that it would pass, or felt so tangled up in it that I couldn’t try and paint a clear picture of what’s up. It might be a rather long description of said picture, but it’s the best I could do.

My bet is on suspect 1-the gut being the “killer” with help from the body/diet sprinkled on top with the mind.

To anyone who managed to get through to the end, I thank you for your time. 

To all those who didn’t, I fully sympathize.

1r4hqxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Strongerman/comments/1r4hqxn/how_to_be_a_disgustingly_good_boyfriend_the/,How to Be a Disgustingly Good Boyfriend The Science Backed Guide That Actually Works,"okay so i've been deep in the self improvement rabbit hole lately. read like 15 books, binged probably 100 hours of podcasts, watched way too many youtube videos. why? because i noticed something disturbing. most guys (including past me) are just winging relationships. we think being a ""good boyfriend"" means remembering anniversaries and not cheating. the bar is literally in hell.

but here's what i found after digging through all this research from psychologists, relationship experts, neuroscience studies, the works. being an exceptional partner isn't about grand gestures or following some bullshit checklist. it's about understanding human psychology, emotional intelligence, and actual communication skills that nobody teaches us.

this isn't some ""10 romantic date ideas"" fluff piece. this is the real framework that transformed how i show up in relationships.

# 1. understand attachment theory (it explains literally everything)

most relationship problems stem from mismatched or insecure attachment styles. and nobody talks about this enough.

**Attached** by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller is genuinely life changing. Levine is a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at Columbia, and this book breaks down the three attachment styles (anxious, avoidant, secure) in relationships. you'll finally understand why your partner needs constant reassurance or why you pull away during conflict. the book sold over 1 million copies for a reason. after reading it i literally texted my girlfriend like ""holy shit this explains our last three arguments."" best relationship book i've ever read, hands down.

the big insight? you can't logic your way through emotional needs. when your partner's attachment system is activated (feeling insecure or threatened), their rational brain basically goes offline. your job isn't to convince them they're wrong. it's to provide safety first, then discuss later.

# 2. learn actual communication skills (not the bs you think you know)

here's the thing. most of us think we're good communicators because we can talk. but relationship communication is a completely different skill set.

**Nonviolent Communication** by Marshall Rosenberg (psychologist who worked in war zones teaching conflict resolution) teaches you how to express needs without blame. the framework is simple but insanely powerful: observations, feelings, needs, requests. instead of ""you never listen to me"" it becomes ""when you're on your phone during dinner (observation), i feel disconnected (feeling), because i need quality time with you (need). would you be willing to put phones away during meals (request)?""

sounds robotic at first but it eliminates like 80% of stupid fights. this book has been translated into 65 languages and used in literal peace negotiations. if it works for resolving international conflicts it'll work for your relationship.

also check out the podcast **Where Should We Begin** by [Esther Perel](https://www.estherperel.com/about). she's a psychotherapist who records real couple's therapy sessions (with permission obviously). you hear actual couples working through infidelity, sex problems, communication breakdowns. it's like getting free therapy by osmosis. insanely good listen.

For anyone wanting to go deeper into relationship psychology without the time commitment of reading 15 books, there's [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/learn-anything-befreed/id6739747450), an AI learning app that pulls from relationship research, expert podcasts, and books like the ones mentioned here. You type in something specific like ""i want to improve communication skills in my relationship as someone who struggles with vulnerability"" and it generates a structured learning plan with personalized audio content. You can customize the depth from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with examples, and the voice options (including this surprisingly addictive smoky voice) make it feel less like studying and more like having a conversation. It's been useful for internalizing these concepts while commuting or at the gym instead of just adding more books to the pile.

# 3. understand the mental load (and actually carry your weight)

there's this invisible labor in relationships that women disproportionately carry. it's not just chores, it's the thinking about chores. remembering birthdays, planning social events, noticing when toilet paper is low, scheduling doctor appointments.

**Fair Play** by Eve Rodsky breaks this down with a card game system. Rodsky is an organizational management specialist and lawyer who got fed up with the division of labor in her own marriage. the book quantifies domestic responsibilities and creates a framework for equitable distribution. it's been featured everywhere from Good Morning America to the New York Times.

the game changer for me? she introduces ""conception, planning, execution"" for every task. it's not enough to execute (take out trash when asked). you need to conceive (notice trash is full) and plan (remember trash day is Thursday). when you take full ownership of tasks without being reminded, you're actually being a partner, not a helper.

also download **Paired**, it's a couples app with daily questions and relationship exercises. helps you stay intentional about growth instead of just coasting.

# 4. develop emotional intelligence (the most attractive quality)

emotional intelligence is recognizing, understanding and managing emotions (yours and your partner's). guys are socialized to suppress emotions which makes us dogshit at this.

**Emotional Intelligence 2.0** by Travis Bradberry is the bestselling EQ book (sold 2 million copies). Bradberry is an emotional intelligence researcher who's worked with 75% of Fortune 500 companies. the book includes a test to measure your current EQ and practical strategies to improve it.

key skill? emotional regulation. when your partner is upset, your instinct might be to fix it or minimize it (""you're overreacting""). instead, validate first. ""that sounds really frustrating"" or ""i can see why you'd feel that way."" you're not agreeing with their perspective necessarily, you're acknowledging their emotional experience is real.

another resource: **The School of Life** youtube channel. Alain de Botton's team makes incredible videos about relationships, emotional maturity, communication. their video ""why you will marry the wrong person"" has 8 million views and will make you question everything you think you know about compatibility.

# 5. prioritize her pleasure (in every sense)

sexual satisfaction is a huge predictor of relationship satisfaction. and statistically, heterosexual women have the lowest orgasm rates of any demographic. that's on us guys.

**Come As You Are** by Emily Nagoski (sex educator with a PhD in health behavior) is the best book on female sexuality. period. it explains how responsive desire works (most women don't just randomly get horny, arousal often comes after sexual activity begins), the dual control model (accelerators and brakes), and how context is everything.

this book will destroy harmful myths you've internalized from porn and society. it's a NYT bestseller that's been recommended by literally every sex therapist. after reading it i understood my partner's sexuality in a completely different way. it's not that her libido is ""lower"" than mine, it's that we have different arousal systems.

also emotional intimacy outside the bedroom directly impacts physical intimacy inside it. you can't ignore your partner all week then expect enthusiastic sex on Saturday.

# 6. show up consistently (not just when it's convenient)

relationships aren't built on Valentine's Day and anniversaries. they're built on Tuesday mornings when you make her coffee without being asked. on Friday nights when you're tired but you listen to her work drama anyway. on Sunday afternoons when you suggest going for a walk together instead of scrolling separately.

The Relationship Cure by [John Gottman](https://www.gottman.com/about/john-julie-gottman/) is essential. Gottman is the most respected relationship researcher alive. he can predict divorce with 94% accuracy after watching couples interact for 15 minutes. his research identified ""bids for connection"" as the key factor. a bid is any attempt to connect: ""look at that dog"" or ""how was your meeting?"" you can turn toward (engage), turn away (ignore), or turn against (be dismissive).

happy couples turn toward bids 86% of the time. divorcing couples? 33%. so when she shows you a tiktok, when he mentions he's stressed, when they want to tell you about their day, put your phone down and engage. these micro moments build or erode trust over time.

try **Insight Timer** for couples meditation. sounds cheesy but spending 10 minutes doing guided meditation together is weirdly intimate and calming.

# the real talk

look, there's no biological imperative making us bad partners. we're not hardwired to be emotionally unavailable or terrible communicators. but we're socialized in a culture that teaches men emotional suppression, views vulnerability as weakness, and positions relationships as something that ""just works"" if you find the right person.

that's bullshit. healthy relationships require skills. and skills can be learned.

you don't have to read every book or become some perfect partner overnight. start with one thing. maybe it's validating emotions instead of problem solving. maybe it's noticing when you're being defensive. maybe it's actually asking what she needs instead of assuming.

the goal isn't perfection. it's growth. it's showing up intentionally instead of on autopilot. it's treating your relationship like something worth investing in because it is.

being a good boyfriend isn't about flowers and surprises (though those are nice). it's about emotional safety, consistent effort, genuine curiosity about your partner's inner world, and the humility to recognize you don't have all the answers.

these resources gave me frameworks to actually improve instead of just wanting to be better. they'll do the same for you if you're willing to put in the work.",1,1771066398.0,Strongerman,0,1.0,False

1r4hjbl,https://i.redd.it/7tixlll6vfjg1.gif,Rewatch diary: Smallville 906 Crossfire,"Summary: Oliver takes in Mia, a young prostitute, and begins training her to fight. Clark and Lois are hired to be the hosts of Metropolis's new morning talk show.

The episode was packed, four different storylines, but I really didn't feel like time was passing. This review is going to be long. I'm warning you in advance!

As I said, the episode has four different storylines. A - Lois and Clark, B - Oliver and Mia, C - Tess and Zod, and D - Chloe and Stuart. The storylines intertwine and the episode reaches two main climaxes - the rescue on the rooftop and the kiss at the end of the episode, both of which surprisingly involve Clark.  
  
I'm starting with plot B because she's the weakest of the four and had the most problems. [Mia Dearden](https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Mia_Dearden_(New_Earth)) is a prostitute who owes a considerable amount of money, and I'm guessing that's steadily increasing, to her pimp, Ricky. So, she fights in underground fight clubs \[not like the one Oliver was in the first episode, where the girls were just ring girls\] and wins. Oliver, who has returned to good health, has apparently returned to his old ways and is searching the darker parts of the city for people with potential who need help. That's how he found Bart and Victor and added them to his proto-Justice League. We meet Mia in the middle of such a fight. I wonder where she learned both fighting and gymnastics. The actress does so many roller skates and somersaults, and her victory pose at the end looked too much like the final pose of a gymnast. At the moment of her victory, Ricky appears, her pimp holds her hand by force and threatens her with a gun, and the girl who just mowed down a guy who is bigger than her surrenders to him as if he had knocked all the air out of her. They leave the place and Oliver follows them with his gaze. Oliver gets into his Austin Martin and goes to look for her in the city. Mia, dressed in minimal red and yellow leather clothing and a blonde wig that even Lana wouldn't agree to wear, stands on a street corner waiting for clients. Oliver invites her into the car and makes her a once-in-a-lifetime offer, to be his protege. Oliver wants to help Mia out of the mud like Chloe helped him \[excuse me for a moment while I choke on this idea again… That's it, let's continue\]. Mia has a little trouble trusting him, although the idea of ​​living in Oliver's penthouse without having to sell her body to live is very appealing to her. She tries to solve her problems herself and doesn't want to be beholden to anyone. Oliver must have realized he wouldn't see his car again when he gave Mia the keys \[he really gives cars to everyone, huh?\] She just tried to steal a $50,000 watch from him. Mia isn't giving the car to Ricky to be rich and famous, but she's not showing much intelligence either. She managed to rack up a debt with her pimp and couldn't figure out that she'd be in debt to him forever? Later, when Ricky pushes Oliver into the car, she complains that he promised he wouldn't hurt him. Come on, girl, what did you expect? Then, when he threatens Lois, instead of fighting him like she did in the ring, she just follows them and if Lois hadn't taken the initiative she probably would have watched him kill Lois. She manages to get the gun, I have no problem with her not being able to kill him, but what if she shot him over the head? Or in his leg? Or threw the gun over the fence and mow his face down? Lois would have helped her and Oliver too. Instead, she stands in front of him shaking and gives him a chance to hit her and falls unconscious \[from one blow?? This Ricky must be a meteor freak\] thus joining the growing club of female characters with brain damage from too many blows to the head. To Oliver's credit, he doesn't give up on Mia so easily. Let's hope Ricky meets Bruno Mannheim in prison and joins Intergang.  
We have a new supporting character here, Mia Dearden known as Green Arrow's sidekick Speedy, who manages to come in and leave a first impression of an unintelligent girl with acrobatic abilities and street fighting skills but indecisiveness. At least she doesn't kill people, let's hope Oliver manages to find the diamond in that lump of coal. In the comics, Mia Dearden is Green Arrow's second Speedy. While Roy Harper \[the first Speedy\] represented social problems of youth in his time, namely addiction to hard drugs, Mia Dearden represents a different problem. Mia is forced to become a prostitute after running away from a sexually abusive parent and only after Oliver takes her under his wing and rescues her from the streets does it turn out that Mia is an AIDS carrier. How will Smallville handle this?  
  
Plot D is about Chloe and Stewart and is actually the beginning of a plot. Stewart is a genius with credentials, a graduate of MIT \[Massachusetts Institute of Technology, one of the most important scientific institutions in the world\] who is only 20 years old. He has already managed to hack into the systems of several corporations and get caught, and he manages to stop a hundred different attempts by Chloe to penetrate Tess's systems, and he does it in style. Computer geek to the end. Chloe has already encountered someone smarter than her, Emile Hamilton, now she meets a hacker who is better than she. It's a good idea to recruit Stewart and despite the concerns of many, I don't think Stu will find himself in the tower anytime soon. I think Chloe will try to recruit him \[and how appropriate for her new persona to do it through blackmail\] as a double agent, it will take time for him to discover \[if ever\] the identities of the rest of the proto-Justice League. Stu is the guy with the red shirt in the Star Trek series, he won't survive long.  
I loved Chloe in the episode, I just loved her. Why can't she always be like this? Smiling, challenged, supportive, determined.  
  
Tess and Zod's third plot is much scarier than it seems at first glance. Tess manages to threaten Stu without threatening Stu and then enters the hall in the mansion to reveal her new project - a solar tower that is supposed to provide electricity to the entire city of Metropolis. She touches the white display table and a hologram creates a double tower with a bridge connecting the two parts and my heart drops towards the liver. This is the tower from Lois' visions. The last thing I expected to see in Metropolis. It's even equipped with a red sun. It's one of the creepiest things I've seen this season and Tess is so proud of it. She mentions her new business partner R.A.O Incorporated, the Rao Corporation. Tess doesn't know this and I guess if she did she wouldn't be in such a hurry to cooperate with this corporation. [Rao](https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Rao_(New_Earth)) is the red sun that Krypton revolves around, or rather revolved around. It's also the name of the main Kryptonian god, equivalent to our God in Earth. This is the first time the name is mentioned in Smallville and I'm not even sure Clark knows who and what Rao is, but Zod certainly does. His arrogance knows no bounds.  
The Kandorians have managed to evade Tess until now, to insert agents among her bodyguards and help LuthorCorp upgrade themselves and become a technologically leading company and establish a corporation significant enough in two or three months that Tess would consider working with it from a business perspective. No wonder Zod feels superior. What's strange is that Tess couldn't find the Kandorians but she managed to figure out that they were testing The Blur's blood in the lab and ordered it destroyed. Tess also managed to keep Zedd until quite late in The Blur's existence. Just as I don't understand how Tess knew what the Kandorians were doing in the lab and whose blood they were testing, I also don't understand how Zod decided that Tess knew something about The Blur. But he guessed correctly and Tess tests his patience in the mansion when she turns her back on him and continues to fill her mouth with champagne. Tess doesn't appreciate Zod. She wants to earn his respect, she wants to earn the status of an equal, but that will never happen.  
The Kryptonians in general and the Kandorians in particular are the most arrogant and racist snobs in the 28 known galaxies. There is no way in the world that Zod would ever look at Tess as an equal or any non-Kryptonian as an equal. Remember what Brainiac says to Clark in 508 Solitude? ""To think that you would sacrifice your Kryptonian heritage for a single *homo sapien*. You are a pitiful disgrace"" and he also calls General Zod a ""true Kryptonian"". This is not an attitude that developed in a year or two, it is an entire philosophy of life. The Kryptonians are not a group of sociable and friendly aliens, they have an even more violent past than ours with aggressive expansionist tendencies and a sense of superiority over everyone else. It's not for nothing that Doomsday hates them in the comics, and he is not the only one. The only thing that kept them from spreading throughout the galaxies \[all they need to do is spend some time in the light of a yellow sun and almost nothing will defeat them\] was their tendency to extreme centralization and their obsession with racial purity. In the comics, led by Admiral Zod \[a relative of General Zod\], they conquered several solar systems and ruled them with a strong hand, and then there was a change in the High Council and all the Kryptonians, colonists and soldiers, returned to Krypton only to explode with it a few years later. General Zod is a product of this society, in many ways he is an extreme product of this society.  
And Tess is playing games with him. She is sure right now that the fact that she killed his soldier will make Zod respect her. I watched her salute him with her coffee and shouted ""Idiot! Idiot!"" at the screen. Zod will not respect you, you managed to piss him off. It's time to start being afraid of him. Zod from the moment he appears in the episode mocks Tess and belittles her. Does she really think killing his soldier will change his attitude towards her? Zod doesn't think Tess is not dangerous or uninhibited, he knows all that. He just doesn't and never will put her on the same level as him.  
Tess knows almost nothing about Kryptonians. She may know about Veritas but I doubt she knows anything about Milton Payne or Zod's takeover of Lex at the end of season five. She met Faora even though she doesn't know it and she thought she knew something about Davis. She thinks she knows everything about Clark. From the first moment she thought she could manipulate Zod and despite her failures she keeps trying. Lex thought he knew everything about Dr. Milton Fine too, he thought he could manipulate Fine for his own purposes. At first Milton Fine was a nosy history professor then he was a CIA agent then he was a Kryptonian only for Lex to discover at the end that Milton Fine was created by Kryptonians. Lex thought Fine's goal was to undermine LuthorCorp and tarnish his reputation, then he helped him collect viruses in preparation for an alien invasion and then he thought Fine intended to use the virus against humanity only to discover that Milton Fine's goal was to prepare Lex as a vessel for General Zod. The relationship between Tess and Zod is very similar to the relationship between Lex and Milton Fine. The difference is that Milton Fine was much more sophisticated and much less arrogant than Zod and Lex did not know until it was too late what his ultimate goal was. Tess thinks the Kandorians are here to save Earth. She thinks Zod's goal is to get his and his people's powers. She doesn't try to understand why they need them or what they will do when they get them and she doesn't understand how far they are willing to go to get their powers. If she understood Zod's true goal \[which is, I assume, the takeover of Earth and the enslavement if not the extinction of the human race\] she would have carefully examined the plans of this solar tower. Tess is playing checkers and Zod is playing [Chinese chess](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_chess). She is in trouble and doesn't even know it.  
Just a small comment. Was I the only one who felt like that Kandorian was going to torture Tess with some particularly wild sex? With that voice and the behavior of the actors, you could think it was a scene from a porn movie.  
  
The opening scene was one of the best opening scenes in the series, so Clark and Lois. Funny, light, entertaining. They managed to convey the creaks in the relationship between Lois and Clark \[the blow-off from the first date and the hiding of Oliver's condition\] and Clark's determination to get that second date and at the same time Lois' plan to get a backup for the job at the Daily Planet \[Tess fired her once after all\] and all that in just a few minutes. Lois was so Lois and Clark so Clark. Oliver's reaction to him hosting a morning show was so accurate, I want to see Clark make a cake too. Clark has always had trouble speaking in front of an audience and the very thought of him hosting a TV show confused him so much that he doesn't understand what he's saying. But as soon as the camera stopped rolling, he has no problem expressing himself. He responds like a man ""Of course I'm taking this seriously! I bought a new tie!"". \[Wow! Really, Clark? You bought a new tie? What an investment!\] A statement that ultimately leads Lois to respond to him like any angry woman who won't let a man get out of the hole he dug for himself with compliments like ""Don't try to calm me down now!"" But Clark has an answer to that that leaves Lois speechless for a moment.  
In the Daily Planet when Lois fills out her profile, Clark has a lot of knowledge about the things Lois likes but completely misses her goal which is to impress the producers so she will get the job and also, presumably, make him jealous when the guy shows up for her blind date. When Lois asks him what good qualities she has that men will pursue, Clark is pretty speechless, ""You're… Lois."" Lois takes this in good humor, it's Clark after all, not Cyrano de Bergerac. At first glance, it seems like Clark doesn't have anything good to say about Lois. In fact, from the first time he talks to her, with Lana in episode 402 Gone where he describes Lois as ""Lois? She's bossy, she's stuck up, she's rude."" His compliments to her are always indirect. He tells her that Lucy isn't that bad and actually says that Lois did a pretty good job raising her sister. He suggests that she look for a job as a journalist and says that she did a decent job in her short career at Torch, but this episode he dares and actually tells her that she looks good in the dress she bought for the screen test. Although the moment Lois asks him, he doesn't really know what to say. Maybe because for him, Lois is Lois, incomparable to anything else, original, unique, herself and not trying to be someone else. You have to know him to understand that and you have to be Lois to not be hurt by the fact that it's all he can think about.  
[Catherine Grant](https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Catherine_Grant_(New_Earth)), the blonde who shows up for Clark's blind date \[which Clark prepared for with his typical sloppiness\], makes Lois' smile fall from her face. She tries to find negative things about this very talented girl and when she realizes that Clark has a real chance of success in this date, she starts to lose her smile. By now she's made her intentions more or less clear to Clark \[and don't say you didn't notice how she bent over the way she did when she sat Clark down on the couch in the previous episode\] and now there's a chance he'll be swept away in the blonde's arms - the Mother Teresa wearing high heels. And why not? Catherine is blonde, beautiful, was in the Peace Corps and studied for a double master's degree in sociology and social justice. On paper, she's a perfect match for Clark, but assuming she's real, Catherine is vanilla ice cream and Clark is now looking for wild cherry ice cream… That doesn't mean he'll let Lois get to him or that he won't sting her back. Clark enjoys their stinging discussions too much and Lois knows when to take his comments with humor.  
Clark's blind date is so successful that Lois feels the need to be at least as good as him to impress the producers. She doesn't come to Oliver to be her guy for the night but to get him to give her tips on her annoying habits. If Lois really wanted to win Clark over, she would have asked Oliver out, especially if she still had feelings for Oliver. Oliver, who has feelings for Lois, actually expected her to ask him out and if Clark gets stuck when he has to list Lois's good qualities, Oliver only remembers the good things. Lois smiles when Oliver talks about her little habits but when Mia shows up she gives up on the whole thing and leaves. This was supposed to be a hint to Oliver about Lois' feelings for him. In season seven when she thought Oliver was hanging out with Dinah she almost hit him, here she stings him a little and then leaves.  
Lois is nervous about her blind date and Clark's sarcasm distracts her. Soon their conversation turns personal. Clark says the right things and almost gets an answer from her about another date when Oliver arrives. Both are surprised by his sudden appearance. Lois really feels uncomfortable. Yes, a blind date with the most wanted billionaire in Metropolis who also looks good will definitely help the ratings, but the producers are not the only audience Lois is appealing to. The one she really cares about is Clark and she knows that Oliver has the potential to destroy what is starting to build between them, she doesn't know how right she was and it's a good thing she doesn't know. Clark loses hope after Oliver's words and the fact that Lois takes Oliver aside away from the cameras and microphones takes the wind out of his sails. When the headset works again and he hears that Lois is in trouble, he rushes to save Lois and Oliver in one of the most amazing scenes in the series. A scene that ties into one of the strongest scenes in the movie ""Superman Returns."" Clark gives Oliver a very intense look. It's ""Woe to you if you hurt her!"" or ""I really don't like the fact that I have to save you now"" or ""Get your hands off my woman,"" but Oliver doesn't say anything and Clark disappears. He stands on a nearby roof and watches Lois and Oliver embrace, just like he watched Lana and Lex embrace in the hospital after he saved them from the invisible assassin in episode 520 Fade. There Lex got the credit for the rescue and Clark saw his childhood love embrace his sworn enemy and here The Blur, apparently, gets the credit and Clark sees the love of his life embrace his close friend, who just a few minutes ago expressed his love for her and she didn't reject him.  
Lois, realizing where Oliver is trying to lead the conversation, cancels the filming. She has no intention of Clark witnessing something that is private between her and Oliver. She manages to gently and decisively reject him. She leaves no room for doubt and makes it clear that she now has only one love at the moment - Clark. She continues to be a loyal friend and follows him to make sure he doesn't hurt himself and she also tries to find out what's going on with Mia. Surprisingly, Clark can't hear what's going on between them even without the headset; his powers and senses are still not comparable to those of Superman in the comics.  
Clark comes to the tower to see if Chloe has made any progress on the Kandorians front and he shares his feelings with her. He already told her at the beginning of the episode that he cares deeply about Lois, but here he shares with Chloe his emotional decision about Lois. He hasn't done that since 902. After the part of the conversation between Oliver and Lois that he witnessed \[how he was blind to Lois's general discomfort throughout the whole thing is beyond me\] all his resolve melts away. Maybe he should give up on Lois? Oliver seems so happy when he's with her and he's been through such a dark time… But Chloe \[just like Lois last season\] refuses to see Clark go on another emotional rollercoaster. She also refuses to let him treat Lois like an object. ""Decide what you want and go for it. Stop sacrificing yourself."" And Clark takes her advice to heart.  
In the Daily Planet, Lois is disappointed that she didn't get the role. I think she was trying to get to the point where she would explain to Clark what happened the previous evening, but Clark doesn't have the patience this time to listen to her speech. Working on television doesn't interest him, and with the determination thar doesn't embarrass any version of Superman, he grabs Lois and shuts her mouth with a kiss.  
I've been waiting for this kiss since Lois' car pulled into a cornfield and Lois found a naked guy she didn't even know his name, and I'm not the only one. We've been given all sorts of foreplay like in 610 Hydro or 613 Crimson. We even had a moment of almost-kissing in 810 Bride. But this kiss left the rest of the kisses behind. This is the first time they've kissed and they're fully aware of it, and unless the series of blows to the head that Lois has taken over the past year or so leads to brain damage and memory loss, Lois will remember this kiss. What was most important to me was the fact that Clark initiated this kiss, for the first time he doesn't give up on what he wants, he doesn't hesitate and doesn't let anything stop him, not even Lois's chatter. And Lois, after a momentary shock, doesn't hold back and kisses him back, even runs her hands through his hair. Clark supports her and pulls her closer. This kiss could last hours and we were only allowed to see a few seconds. Not fair. I'm a Superman fan, especially in the comics, and so I'm a big fan of Lois and Lois and Clark. Someone wrote on one of the forums after the episode aired that Clark is Lois's Valium and she is his espresso. It's a great, mythical love, true love, and Smallville has finally gotten back on track.  
  
This was a great episode, very strong and tight despite the weak parts in Mia's story.

Notes:  
\* Rick tells Mia after she pays off her debt with Oliver's Aston Martin, that he was richer than the Luthor's. This is true Lex Luther's estimated net worth is 810 Million, whereas Oliver Queen's estimated net worth is 8 Billion. The only one richer is Bruce Wayne. Who's worth is $9.2 Billion, and lists his company, Wayne Enterprises, as having an annual revenue of $31.3 Billion.  
\* At the end when Lois shows Clark who KZXP 21 decided to go with for Good Morning Metropolis, the name you see is Catherine Grant. The name Cat Grant is also in ""Supergirl"" (2015) as Karas boss at CatCo.  
\* The Kryptonian Guard, who confronts Tess Mercer, wears the same Kryptonian crest as Faora and Vala.  
\* Richard, Mia Dearden's pimp, first appeared in *Green Arrow* (Volume 3) #2 (May, 2001). Richard took Mia in off the street, offering her shelter, while forcing her into a life of prostitution. *Smallville* gives Richard the last name ""DeGroot"".  
\* Lois and Clark try out for a television job. In the 1970s, Lois Lane and Clark Kent (along with Lana Lang) went to work for WGBS-TV, owned by Morgan Edge.",9,1771065606.0,Smallville,1,0.85,False

Schools skipped personal finance. Social media pushes toxic flex culture. And TikTok is full of 19-year-olds giving investment “advice” with zero receipts. This post is for anyone who feels behind financially and wants *real*, tested advice from experts who know their stuff. All backed by solid books, podcasts, and behavioral economics studies. The truth: your financial habits can be reprogrammed. You just need to stop playing someone else’s game.

Here are 5 rules that actually work, not the viral BS.

**Pay yourself** ***first***  
Forget the “save what’s left after spending” approach. You’ll never save. Instead, follow what *Morgan Housel* argues in[ The Psychology of Money](https://a.co/d/0eNJqkDc): the most powerful wealth-building habit is consistently saving a part of what you earn before touching the rest. Even 5-10% automatically withdrawn into a high-yield savings or investment account grows over time. This builds “invisible wealth”, the kind you don’t see, but deeply protects you.

**Lifestyle creep is killing you, not lattes**  
The real danger isn’t small daily purchases, it’s upgrading your lifestyle every time you get a raise. A key insight from *Ramit Sethi’s* book[ I Will Teach You to Be Rich](https://a.co/d/09Bec3lJ): people don’t stay broke because of coffee, they stay broke because of cars, rent, and subscriptions that silently stack up. Want freedom? Lock your lifestyle to what it was 2 years ago. Funnel raises into investments, not expenses.

**Budgeting doesn’t work. Automating does.**  
According to a 2022 *Harvard Business Review* piece on financial behavior by Hal Hershfield, most people don’t budget consistently because it’s mentally exhausting and easy to forget. Automating your bill payments and savings removes willpower from the equation. Set up auto-transfers right after payday. Out of sight, but still working for you.

**Avoid the “debt acceptance” trap**  
Too many normalize debt as a part of adult life. But it drains your future. The *Federal Reserve’s 2023 Report* showed the average credit card interest rate at 20.09%, that’s compounding against you daily. Make eliminating high-interest debt the highest priority. Hit it aggressively, even if slowly. Debt is not a character flaw, but it *is* a financial emergency.

**Your brain isn’t built for money. So build habits, not discipline.**  
Behavioral economics research from [Nudge](https://a.co/d/0hwCjaoj) by Richard Thaler shows we’re bad at long-term thinking. We value now more than future-us. That’s why small system changes (like freezing your credit cards, or installing a spending tracker app like YNAB or Rocket Money) work better than “try harder”. You don’t need more discipline, you need fewer temptations.

Get rich slowly is still undefeated. If you're broke, it’s not because you're broken. You just need a better system.",1,1771065330.0,MindsetConqueror,0,1.0,False

**$DKNG**: **+120**

Wager Amount: 1U to WIN 1.2U

League: Team Switzerland vs Team Canada (5:10AM CST on PeacockTV)

**Recap**: Team Canada rolled! And it was a matter of time for Nathan MacKinnon to get in the goal party! I also wagered Connor McJesus to score a goal as well! **+160**✅

**Matchup:** Another short quick POTD writeup and this game kicks off early this morning, so I have to make this very quick! Team Latvia might be the worst team in this Olympics showcase. They have yet to win a preliminary matchup and have been fairly dominated in each respective matchup (3 of their last 5 games they have loss by more than 2 goals and allowed 5 goals in 2 of their last 5 games). Team Germany has been somewhat competitive and although they have a losing record in their stretch of 5 games, they won their last game handily against Team Denmark. Team Latvia got smoked on their last matchup vs the Team US, they had one lucky ass goal off a rebound and I expect Team Germany to shut them out, so -305 on the ML seems like a fair price and to lay that wit one of the best forward to ever play the game, Leon Draisaitl to score a goal. You partner those two up and voila! You got a plus money bet!

**The Play & Prediction :** Leon Draisaitl scored a goal on his last game and he should score on this game. He's going to take some SOG. If you want the safer route you can always just take him to score 1+ Point, but for me I'm taking him to score a goal and parlaying it wit Team Germany ML.

The end is drawing near, but who knos what the future holds. I will never rule out a possibility of handicapping POTDs in 2026 and beyond.

Idk how to explain it but if you don't live in this part of the street, you have absolutely no reason to park in it...

I started to notice months ago the same blue Toyota parked, with the same weird man drinking coffee in it. He comes almost everyday, stays 1 hour or 2, and sometimes comes back multiple times during the day... There is three parking spot in front of my house, then 3 garages, then 2 more spots but not right in front of my house... (I'm not an english native, I hope I'm understandable). He never parks in the two spots, he either park on one of the three spots or in front of the garages 🤨 

My mother saw him wearing a military uniform once or twice... She ended up asking him what he was doing there, he just said there was nothing to worry about but didn't explain (He doesn't have to, I know..).

After she talked to him, he did not came for a few days then came back but not as often as before... And recently, I noticed he changed car, same plaque number but different car... Today, I saw him in an other car with different number 🤨

It may be nothing... But he gives weird vibes 🫤

I’m selling my BT Mage espresso machine. Bought it around 6 months ago for ₹30,000. It’s barely used, I’ve made coffee maybe 5 times at most.

Reason for selling is that I’ve switched to manual brewing now, so this machine is just sitting unused. It was kept at my parents’ place, which is also why it didn’t get much use.

Everyone’s either tweeting about their “$10K/mo AI side hustle” or making Instagram reels yelling into a mic about freedom, passive income, and coffee shop workdays. But most of it is just clickbait and vibes. No real strategy. No breakdown. No receipts.

So here’s a practical, research backed guide on how solo founders are actually building lean one person businesses using AI. You don’t need a team. You don’t need VC money. You need smart systems, clear positioning, and the right tools. This post is distilled from legit sources (founder interviews, podcasts, research studies, and books). No hype. Just working models.

According to a 2023 Zapier report, over 40% of “solopreneurs” are using AI daily to automate tasks, serve clients, and even build entire digital products. Combine that with an ultra lean cost structure, and you’ve got real scalability. Most people aren’t lazy they just don’t know the playbook.

Here’s what that playbook looks like:

  **Pick a niche you understand deeply**   Not “crypto and wellness coaching for moms” unless you KNOW the customer. Tight niches win. Naval Ravikant said it best: play long term games with long term people. Don't chase trends, build trust.

  **Use ChatGPT and Claude as leverage, not a replacement**   You’re not outsourcing thinking. You’re accelerating clarity. Use them for idea validation, email drafts, sales page copy, and content repurposing. According to Harvard Business Review (2024), professionals using AI “as a thought partner” were 40% faster *and* scored higher on quality metrics.

  **Build a minimum viable service or product**   Do not overbuild. Follow the $100 MVP method (from Rob Walling’s “Start Small, Stay Small”): Sell it before you build it. Use Canva, Notion, gumroad, or Tally.so. AI can help you script, structure and ship.

  **Automate early**   Use tools like Zapier, Make.com, and AI customer support bots. Intercom and Crisp are now AI native. Don’t hire a VA until your systems break. A McKinsey 2023 report found AI automation saved solopreneurs ~15–20 hours per week on average, mostly in lead gen and content ops.

  **Monetize attention with compounding content**   If no one sees your work, it doesn’t exist. Make AI driven short form clips from one long post using OpusClip or vidyo.ai. Then schedule weekly value drops via Beehiiv/Substack/newsletters. This drives authority. And revenue.

  **Create value ladders**   Start with a $9 digital product. Upsell a $99 template. Then a $999 cohort or service. Don’t launch 200 things. Sell one thing better. AI helps personalize the funnel at scale.

  **Use analytics wisely, not obsessively**   Tools like Mixpanel, Hotjar, and Koala Stats (for Substack writers) help you spot what’s working. Don't follow vanity metrics. Follow cash flow and retention.

Three AI first solopreneur models that actually scale:
  *AI ghostwriting or content agencies* (see: Justin Welsh’s $2M+ one person business, built around LinkedIn ghostwriting)
  *Info products + courses built with AI help* (See: Daniel Vassallo’s “Small Bets” model)
  *Niche SaaS built with no code AI tools* (see: Pieter Levels’ AI tools like PhotoAI driving $1M+ ARR)

Don’t chase perfection. It’s better to launch bad and iterate fast. As Packy McCormick put it on the Not Boring podcast, “AI’s not replacing us. It’s extending the individual’s capacity to *do* more, *faster*.”

It’s not magic. It’s leverage. Use it well.
