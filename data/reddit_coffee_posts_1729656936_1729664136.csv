Most business owners have been there‚Äîdrowning in spreadsheets, forgetting to follow up with clients, and managing contacts like we‚Äôre organizing a neighborhood garage sale.

Running a small business or startup is tough enough without juggling a million platforms to keep everything on track. The [Folk App](https://ecowebdesign.co.uk/folk-app-official) offers the promise of a **simple CRM software** that centralizes contacts, emails, and pipelines all in one place.

If you're tired of constantly dropping the ball, mentally and physically, this CRM could be your saving grace.

*Processing img athd1105zvvd1...*

But does it live up to its claim to be the **best CRM for small businesses** or startups? We took a look under the hood ...

# Product Overview

* **Product Name**: Folk App
* **Category**: Pro CRM Platform
* **Overall Verdict**: 4.6/5

# Detailed Product Analysis

# Ease of Use and Setup

When I say **Folk CRM** is **user-friendly**, I mean it. If setting up a CRM feels like scaling Everest to you, Folk‚Äôs clean interface will feel like a nice walk in the park. The **simple CRM software** vibe is strong here, and the setup is about as easy as making toast.

You can sync your contacts directly from Gmail, Outlook, or even use that trusty old CSV file that‚Äôs been collecting dust. The **FolkX Chrome extension** lets you scoop up contacts from LinkedIn faster than your morning coffee kicks in. Now, if that‚Äôs not efficient, I don‚Äôt know what is.

# Contact Management Features

Let‚Äôs face it: managing contacts shouldn‚Äôt be harder than managing a toddler‚Äôs birthday party. **Folk CRM** makes this part smooth, even adding **contact enrichment** to fill in missing details. You can [create different groups](https://ecowebdesign.co.uk/folk-app-official) for **relationship management**‚Äîclients, investors, prospects‚Äîso nothing slips through the cracks.

This is hands down one of the **best CRM for startups**, especially if you‚Äôre trying to manage everything with minimal stress.

# Email Campaigns and Personalization

You know that thing where you‚Äôre sending the same email to 100 people but trying to make it feel personalized? Folk‚Äôs **CRM for email campaigns** is a life-saver for this. It lets you send personalized bulk emails, and even better, it includes **CRM with email automation** features to track responses and schedule follow-ups.

You can also pull dynamic fields like names and job titles into your templates so you look like a personalization wizard. Plus, thanks to **Folk CRM integrations** with Gmail and LinkedIn, everything is tracked without the need to switch tabs every five seconds.

# Pipeline Management

Every good CRM needs solid **sales pipeline CRM** tools, and Folk delivers with customizable pipeline stages. It‚Äôs simple but effective for small businesses that want to keep an eye on where each deal stands.

Now, I‚Äôve seen better analytics when comparing **Pipedrive vs Folk CRM** or even **Folk CRM vs HubSpot**, but for most startups, this will more than get the job done. You can easily track deals and nudge your prospects down the line.

*Processing img 2dsqqcy9zvvd1...*

# Integrations and Automation

Here‚Äôs where Folk does well in some areas but falls a little short in others. The **Folk CRM integrations** cover Gmail, Outlook, and Google Calendar, which is great. However, if you‚Äôre dreaming of a CRM that will seamlessly sync with everything under the sun, you‚Äôll need to rely on **Zapier** for more complex workflows.

I did miss a few more native integrations, especially as a **CRM with LinkedIn integration** for social prospecting. But hey, that‚Äôs why the **FolkX extension** exists, right?

# AI-Driven Magic Fields

The AI features in **Folk CRM AI features** add a little bit of sparkle to your workflow. The **Magic Fields** let you automate mundane tasks like personalizing emails or even cleaning up contact data, saving you time and frustration. It‚Äôs not perfect‚Äîsometimes, AI-generated content can feel a bit stiff‚Äîbut for basic personalization and task automation, it‚Äôs pretty darn impressive.

# Reporting and Analytics Features

Now, if you‚Äôre looking for robust analytics, you might hit a small snag. While Folk provides a **CRM with customizable dashboards** to track email open rates and deal progress, the reporting is a little more basic compared to heavyweight platforms like HubSpot or Pipedrive.

If detailed sales analysis is a must-have, you might feel a little underwhelmed. But for small businesses, the basics are covered, and it gets the job done without overwhelming you with charts and graphs that look like they belong in NASA‚Äôs control room.

The **FolkX Chrome extension**? A lifesaver! Adding new contacts straight from LinkedIn felt almost too easy. I was able to set up a pipeline and send out **email campaigns** via this **CRM** with personalized touches that didn‚Äôt feel robotic.

The one small gripe? I wish there were more robust **reporting tools**, especially when analyzing sales data. It‚Äôs like getting a delicious sandwich but realizing they forgot the pickle‚Äîstill tasty, but missing that extra zing.

1ga37x4,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ga37x4/ive_been_seeing_dead_women_for_months_now_theyre/,"I've been seeing dead women for months. Now they're saying my fianc√©e is a cannibal---our wedding is in three days!
","I started seeing dead women right after I began sleepwalking late last year. Around the same time, I had just started dating Kurt Monarch, a charming, flirty pharmaceutical executive in his late forties, who lived twenty miles from my apartment in Atlanta, Georgia. We met through a mutual friend who worked at his company, and the rest was history. Within three months, we were already having serious conversations about marriage and starting a family. I know what you‚Äôre thinking‚Äî-that was fast, but I couldn‚Äôt help myself, I was in love with him.



Sleepwalking was no fun experience, but unfortunately, it ran in the family. My mother started sleepwalking at my age, in her late thirties. I tried everything to stop it, countless medications, visits to different doctors, only to be prescribed the same useless treatments each time. I had no memories of my actions while sleepwalking, but this time was different. I vividly recalled seeing the dead women‚Äîmiddle-aged, like me. They were beautiful, full of potential, but the fear and regret etched on their faces haunted me. At first, I tried to dismiss them as nightmares, but waking up outside, standing in the street at night, as I often did, and remembering every detail made me realize the experience was real. And I knew I had to do something about it.



I loved Kurt with all my heart, and I didn‚Äôt want to spook him with my story. So, I kept my mouth shut, and thank God I did, I thought at the time. We strolled through a brightened park, and suddenly, he went down on his knees, drawing a large gasp from me. Oh, God, it was happening, this fucker was proposing to me. He pulled out a black ring box and as the hinged lid opened up, Kurt declared in a soft voice. ‚ÄúAs my best buddy and confidant, I can‚Äôt imagine a life without you. Will you marry me?‚Äù



‚ÄúYes. A thousand times. Come over here, you sucker.‚Äù I grabbed him by the collar before he got off the ground and we ate each other‚Äôs lips for minutes. And right after I opened my eyes, I saw a small group of dead women standing behind him, staring at me with a gloomy look.



I screamed and pulled away from Kurt, completely freaked out. He glanced behind him, confused, before turning back to me and asking. ‚ÄúMartie, what‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù¬†



I hugged him tightly and whispered. ‚ÄúJust a dream, Kurt. A bad dream.‚Äù The dead women had vanished. Until recently, I only came across them while sleepwalking, but somehow, they had followed me into the waking world. I recognized their faces, etched with the same haunting dread, wasn't something I wanted to see every day. But I didn‚Äôt think I had a choice, I actually believed it would get worse before it gets any better. But what could I do? I couldn‚Äôt confide in Kurt with this. He‚Äôd think I was losing my mind and might even call off the engagement. I needed to talk to Nash, the friend who hooked us up together. I‚Äôve known her for years and knew she could keep a secret.



I scheduled a meeting with Nash over the phone that night, trying hard not to fall asleep in my apartment to avoid sleepwalking again. Nash and I met at a coffee shop, a couple of miles from the post office where I worked as a clerk. I stepped out of the bus and hugged Nash in the street, and we entered the coffee shop. Nash was delighted to know that I had accepted Kurt‚Äôs proposal at the park. Which I found odd, because I didn‚Äôt disclose the exact location.



‚ÄúHow did you know Kurt proposed at the park?‚Äù I inquired.



She produced an awkward laugh. ‚ÄúOh. Yeah, that. I guessed it. Most sane people proposed at the park. It's romantic.‚Äù I thought so too, so I didn‚Äôt press further. But as soon as I was ready to confide in her about my sleepwalking experience, another dead woman appeared, this time, she was standing behind Nash, holding a machete around her neck.



I screamed and pointed behind her. ‚ÄúOh. My. God. Watch out, Nash.‚Äù Nash glanced behind her and turned back to me, flabbergasted. Patrons started to turn towards me, wondering what was going on. But more dead women stood in the coffee shop, staring specifically at Nash, and shaking their heads at me. I was going insane. Why was I the only one who could see them? Was it some kind of curse on me? I was never that‚Ä¶ special.



Nash looked into my frightened eyes. ‚ÄúMartie, are you okay? What‚Äôs going on with you?‚Äù I winced, as the dead woman still had a machete around Nash‚Äôs neck, ready to gut her, but Nash couldn‚Äôt even see her. I had no choice but to act normal. I came to the conclusion that I was the only one perhaps in this world that could see those dead women. So, I played the workplace drama card, hoping that she would believe me. It was now crystal clear to me: those dead women knew who Nash was, and didn‚Äôt want me to tell her the truth about them.



‚ÄúMartie, if work is stressing you out, to the point of insanity, then, it‚Äôs time to find another job.‚Äù¬†



I nodded and finished my coffee and bagels, and when I looked up and around the shop, the dead women were gone. Desperation wasn‚Äôt going to save me from them, I needed to know what they wanted from me, as Kurt and I had scheduled our wedding five days from now.



I welcomed Kurt into my home that Monday evening with a warm hug as we prepared to have dinner with my parents. His parents weren‚Äôt in the picture‚Äî-he was raised as an orphan and had little connection with his biological family. His adopted parents had also lost touch with him. I avoided bringing up family in our conversations, sensing the pain it caused him when I talked about mine. My mother, Gina, was elated to meet Kurt, and kept her eyes on him the entire time he recounted how we first met. My dad, Todd, was a pessimistic freak. Every man who stepped foot in my apartment seemed, in his eyes, like the next coming of the devil. I knew he loved me and only wanted what was best for my future, but honestly, I didn‚Äôt need his approval. At the time, I was determined to marry Kurt, no matter what.



‚ÄúHow many tails have you slept with in your adult life, Mr. Kurt?‚Äù My dad asked, leaning forward towards Kurt, who looked embarrassed by the unusual question.



‚ÄúHoney, maybe that can wait. We‚Äôre eating,‚Äù My mom interjected, but my dad was a hothead and kept pressing Kurt.



‚ÄúYeah. You‚Äôre all eating but I haven‚Äôt yet touched my plate. So, Kurt, how many?‚Äù

Kurt‚Äôs lips widened as he lightly touched my hand laid on the table. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a virgin, Mr. Todd. Never dated any woman in my life. Sorry, I must say it‚Äôs a bit unusual for a guy in his late forties.‚Äù Kurt said, as my dad began to eat.



‚ÄúYou said and I quote: ‚ÄúNever dated any woman in my life.‚Äù But what about men? Have you dated any men in your life, Mr. Kurt?‚Äù¬†



My mom raised her voice in protest. ‚ÄúTodd! Please, have some respect, would you?‚Äù



‚ÄúI have always respected our guests; I just think this time it‚Äôs a little bit too early for Martie to marry a guy she has known for three mere months. That‚Äôs all. It isn‚Äôt about respect.‚Äù



The sound of a casserole hitting the floor put a stop at the upcoming bickering between my parents. I whispered to Kurt that I would be back and left the dinner table, heading for the kitchen around the corner. Upon stepping into the kitchen, I almost tripped over myself, as a dead woman, missing her left arm, stood at the counter, watching a casserole on the stove. She slowly turned her face toward me and placed her finger around her mouth, instructing me to be quiet. I wanted to yell for help, but I had been on that road before. So, I kept my poise and took a deep breath. My mom called out to me. ‚ÄúMartie! Is everything alright?‚Äù



The dead woman slowly aimed her finger into the casserole, teasing me to come look inside. I took her bait, stepped closer to the casserole and took a peek inside. There, simmering beneath layers of onions, tomatoes and garlic, was her missing arm. I screamed, as the dead woman reached into the casserole, snatched the limb, and attempted to cram the entire thing into her mouth. Kurt and my parents rushed into the kitchen, but by then, only I remained, eyes shut tight, trembling like a leaf.



‚ÄúMartie! What is it? What did you see?‚Äù Kurt frantically asked, as I slowly opened my eyes and saw that the dead woman was gone. I turned around to shocked looks from them. I didn‚Äôt want them to think I belonged in a mental facility, so I lied about what happened.



‚ÄúA mouse ran up to me, and I screamed. I‚Äôm sorry, guys.‚Äù I said, eliciting laughter from Kurt, who gave me a peck on the lips. My father was unfazed by Kurt‚Äôs romantic gesture.



‚ÄúA peck won‚Äôt save you boy, let‚Äôs get back out there. I still have a million questions that need answers from you.‚Äù My mother blew a kiss at me, signaling that she was all in for the wedding and followed my dad toward the dining table. Kurt‚Äôs demeanor began to change, he started to sniff the kitchen like some bear looking for food. Never seen him behave like this before.



‚ÄúYou sure you didn‚Äôt see anything, Martie?‚Äù he asked, staring at me.



I pulled him towards me by the collar. ‚ÄúMatter of fact, I saw a mouse that was bigger than your dick, virgin boy.‚Äù We kissed and when I opened my eyes, I saw another dead girl outside the window, drawing her finger on the fogged surface of the glass, writing the words: Don‚Äôt Wed.

I didn‚Äôt sleep with Kurt that night. He wouldn‚Äôt see me naked until after the wedding. That‚Äôs why it felt so wrong when hands touched me as I lay stiff in bed. I knew it couldn‚Äôt be Kurt because he left hours ago. So, what in the world was trying to have sex with me? As the hands multiplied, tugging at my clothes, I jolted upright, flicked on the light, and saw nothing. But I could‚Äôve sworn I felt people touching me. Shaking it off as a nightmare, I headed downstairs, grabbed a bottle of water from the fridge and went outside to get some fresh needed air. The dead‚Äôs woman writing on the fogged surface of my window: *Don‚Äôt Wed*, nagged at me. No doubt this was a warning about my wedding. But why would the dead give a damn about who I married? It made no sense. Was my life in danger? I didn‚Äôt think so‚Ä¶ until I heard the front door close.¬†



I‚Äôd left it open.



I slowly turned behind me and saw a dead woman in a wedding gown, caked in awful makeup, gripping a baseball bat. Heart racing, I acted like I hadn‚Äôt seen her and bolted down the street. As I sprinted down the street, a small group of dead women in wedding dresses appeared, blocking my path. They held signs, and their message was clear: Leave the city or die. They made a circle around me and began running, whispering the chilling words: last warning, Martie. This is your last warning, girl. And all of a sudden, they disappeared. I was in deep trouble; never before have I been so scared of my life. I had two clear choices: Leave the city as they wanted, which meant canceling the wedding. That was out of the question, as I loved Kurt with all my heart and, honestly, it was past time for me to get married. The second choice: ignore them completely, and surely, they will go away for good.



I was back at work on Tuesday morning as a post office clerk. A job I hated because I had to deal with customers on a daily basis, for not exactly a lot of money. Customers kept coming and going as I tried not to think about what happened to me yesterday. My mind was set, if I came across the dead once more, I‚Äôd just ignore them and move along. I took a fifteen-minute break and strolled outside while my replacement took over. Smoking was repulsive to me but with all the stress I was dealing with, I had to take a puff to calm my nerves. After my break ended, I went back into the post office and frozen‚Ä¶ customers began to glare at me. All of them for no apparent reason. Even my co-workers stared at me with hatred. My replacement, Jenny, walked over to me and handed me a note. I grabbed the note and read: Don‚Äôt Wed.¬†



I stared deeply into Jenny‚Äôs eyes and whispered. ‚ÄúHow did you get that?‚Äù



‚ÄúThey were here minutes ago. They said they‚Äôd kill our families if we don‚Äôt stop you from getting hitched,‚Äù Jenny whispered, her lips trembling with fear as a customer stepped toward me. Until now, I thought I was the only person that could see the dead women. But it seemed that to stop me for good, they‚Äôd made themselves visible to others, recruiting them to end my wedding. Oh God, were they going to kill me too?¬†



Well, guess what, I didn‚Äôt wait to find out and took off like a thief, sprinting down the pavement. I elbowed through passengers, frantically dialing 911 on my phone for help! When I glanced back, post office customers and co-workers were chasing me. How could normal people change into monsters so fast? The fear of their families being hurt by the dead‚Äî-something that couldn‚Äôt be arrested or charged must‚Äôve freaked them out. I understood their ardent desire to stop me, but I wasn‚Äôt going to let them. I spotted a bus about to leave, and picked up my speed, smashing my fists at the door and yelling at the driver to let me in. The driver obliged and opened the door, letting me inside. I scrambled to the front, talking to the 911 dispatcher. The bus was packed, and people kept giving me strange looks.



‚ÄúI need help! There are people following me. Yes. Some of them are co-workers. Why? It has to do with my wedding in five days. The post office on Gaines Street. Hurry!‚Äù



When I hung up the phone, Ahmed, my regular bus driver for the route home and to work, tossed a note onto my lap. I slowly picked up the note: Don‚Äôt Wed. I looked at Ahmed. His hands gripped the wheel, his eyes welling with unspoken words, the struggle clear in his throat.



‚ÄúThey came to me at night. I love my family, Martie. I‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù Ahmed said, his voice breaking down as he slammed his foot on the pedal. The bus lurched forward, hurling passengers from their seats. Soon people started screaming, including me, but unlike them, I decided to stop Ahmed from killing us all. I lunged at the transparent shield enclosing him. The bus careened into sedans, smashing through vehicles, veering onto the freeway. I opened the shield and grabbed the wheel, fighting for control as passengers‚Äô terrified screams filled the bus.



‚ÄúStop, Ahmed! This is not the way to do it!‚Äù I hollered on top of my lungs, but he wouldn‚Äôt listen, and jerked the wheel hard to the right slamming into another bus. It flipped on its side, skidding along the right shoulder. Panic and fear surged through me, but I remembered the pepper spray I always kept in my pocket for emergencies. And today, it came in handy. I sprayed Ahmed‚Äôs face just as the bus barreled toward a trailer, yanking him out of his seat. Grabbing the wheel, I slammed on the brakes, bringing the bus to a screeching halt, inches from death. As we came to a stop in the middle of the road, police sirens wailed, and squad cars surrounded the bus.



This had gone from bad to worse. The dead women were now threatening people I knew from work, including my regular bus driver. If they reach them, what will stop them from targeting my family, especially my best friend, Jenny and my soon to be husband, Kurt? I needed to warn them immediately. But first, I had to spend the night at the police station, locked in a small, windowless room, flanked by two seasoned, grumpy detectives. I didn‚Äôt say anything about the dead women, but they did bring them up during the questioning.



‚ÄúYou still don‚Äôt know why your co-workers and some strangers would want to do you harm, Martie?‚Äù One of them asked, staring straight into my eyes.



‚ÄúTo tell you the truth sir, I am completely flabbergasted myself as to the events that occurred today,‚Äù I replied, trying hard not to reveal the reasons behind the attack.



‚ÄúThey, meaning your attackers, including the bus driver‚Äîseemed to have come into contact with ‚Äúghostly women‚Äù. And somehow their families were threatened by them if they didn‚Äôt stop you from getting married,‚Äù the second detective inquired, trying to stop himself from laughing.



I acted as if I didn‚Äôt know what he was talking about and remained mum about the entire thing. They released me later that night to my parents who had hurried to the police station.



The night was very tense as my parents peppered me with questions about why anyone would want to hurt me, to prevent my wedding from happening. My father, Todd, used this occasion to disparage Kurt, arguing that Kurt must‚Äôve been behind the attack because he didn‚Äôt have the guts to tell me that he didn‚Äôt love me anymore. While my mother, Gina, who loved Kurt, defended him, and chastised my dad for sullying his name without any proof. I didn‚Äôt want Kurt to know about all of this. I feared that he‚Äôd force me to reveal what I knew, and then, ditched me as a crazy person who deserved to spend her time in a hospital. But what choice did I have? Sooner or later, I‚Äôd be forced to tell Kurt the truth.



My mother embraced me and whispered to my ears as my dad walked away. ‚ÄúThe dead came to me, Martie. They say‚Ä¶ Kurt‚Äôs a cannibal.

1ga34kz,https://www.reddit.com/r/LatterDayTheology/comments/1ga34kz/why_dont_protestants_just_copy_the_lds_church/,Why Don‚Äôt Protestants Just Copy the LDS Church?,"You know what‚Äôs fascinating about us Protestants? We spend so much time explaining what‚Äôs wrong with the LDS Church, yet we can‚Äôt help but notice how well they‚Äôre doing. Their chapels are always full, their youth stay committed, and their communities thrive. So, being the practical problem-solvers we are, I‚Äôve got a brilliant idea: let‚Äôs just copy what they‚Äôre doing! Of course, we‚Äôll need to make a few tiny adjustments. Nothing major‚Äîjust enough to make it more... Protestant-friendly. I‚Äôm sure these minor tweaks won‚Äôt affect the results at all.

**Those Beautiful Buildings**

Look at those LDS chapels and temples‚Äîspotless, reverent, and meticulously maintained. We could definitely do that! We just need to make it a little more efficient. Maybe hire some cleaning services instead of having members volunteer. I mean, why build community through service when you can just write a check? And those temples? Magnificent! We could build something similar‚Äîbut let‚Äôs add a coffee shop in the lobby, maybe throw in some comfy seating areas. We wouldn‚Äôt want anyone feeling *too* reverent.

**The Word of Wisdom... with Modifications**

Their health code? Clearly effective. Members who follow it tend to live longer, healthier lives. We could adopt something like that‚Äîlet‚Äôs call it ‚ÄúWellness Suggestions.‚Äù We‚Äôll keep the basic idea but make it a bit more flexible. No coffee? That‚Äôs a tad extreme. We‚Äôll just recommend switching to organic, fair-trade beans. See? Same principle, just more... contemporary.

**Modern Prophetic Guidance (Terms and Conditions Apply)**

Having a prophet providing clear direction in our confused world sounds great, doesn‚Äôt it? We‚Äôll need one too‚Äîbut maybe more of a consultant prophet. Someone who gives advice we can consider, debate, form committees about, and then ultimately ignore if it conflicts with our personal interpretations. That way, we maintain our cherished tradition of individual autonomy while pretending we have unified guidance.

**Those Impressive Missionaries**

Their missionary program builds incredible youth leadership and dedication. We could do that too! But instead of two years of full-time service, how about a gap year program? Students could travel, do some light evangelism between coffee shop visits, and post inspiring quotes on Instagram. Same basic concept, just with better WiFi and more flexible schedules.

**Unity (But Make It Optional)**

The way LDS members unite behind their leadership is remarkable. We‚Äôll aim for that too‚Äîjust with a Protestant twist. Each congregation can remain completely independent while somehow maintaining perfect unity. We‚Äôll figure out the details later. The important thing is keeping our autonomy while magically expecting their level of cohesion. Easy, right?

**Eternal Families (Temporary Edition)**

Their doctrine of eternal families creates amazing bonds and commitment. We could adopt something similar, but let‚Äôs not get too carried away with *forever.* Maybe ‚ÄúFamilies Are Important For Now‚Äù would be a better slogan. Same warm feelings, less eternal consequence. After all, commitment is great‚Äîjust not, you know, *forever* great.

**Service and Sacrifice (Convenience Edition)**

The way LDS members serve in their congregations without pay is impressive. We could implement that too‚Äîjust with sign-up sheets, backup lists, and an understanding that if no one volunteers, we can always hire someone. It‚Äôs practically the same thing, right?

**In Conclusion**

There you have it‚Äîa foolproof plan to get all the benefits of LDS practices without any of that pesky commitment, sacrifice, or deep belief that makes them work in the first place. We‚Äôll take their time-tested, divinely instituted programs and ‚Äúimprove‚Äù them by removing all the challenging parts that actually make them effective.

Because really, what could go wrong with cherry-picking successful practices, stripping them of their spiritual foundations, and expecting the same results? I‚Äôm sure removing all the hard parts while keeping the outward appearance will work *just* fine.

After all, isn‚Äôt that the Protestant way? Taking something that works perfectly well and ‚Äúreforming‚Äù it until it‚Äôs more comfortable‚Äîeven if it means losing everything that made it powerful in the first place.

Now, if you‚Äôll excuse me, I need to go present this plan to my church‚Äôs committee on committees. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll form a sub-committee to consider it sometime next year.",1,1729661788.0,LatterDayTheology,0,0.67,False

Is it wrong.. ,"I‚Äôm a (21)F and a couple days ago I express my feelings to a Catholic man who is (24)M let‚Äôs call him John.He expressed that he had felt the same as well. Wanted to get to know each other better! He even suggested we meet up one of these days. And a couple days after I would be seeing him at a Catholic Conference. Unfortunately me and John live 2hrs apart and we both have transportation issues at the moment. So we both weren‚Äôt sure if we were able to see each other at the conference.
But thankfully I got a ride from mutual friend of ours. Let‚Äôs call him Augustine he is (35) and with that here comes the story. I let Augustine know that I had a special gift for John. I mentioned to him I got it for him last month. And I have been waiting to give this to him. Anyways I wait after the conference is over dinner to give it to him. 

John is a pious man and is shy. He‚Äôs not like a lot of the other red pill Catholic boys I know. So I know it he just needs to be encouraged a bit. So before we both said our goodbyes I asked John if he liked coffee and would he like to grab some coffee sometime. I also gave him small crucifixion so he can carry around to evangelize.

That‚Äôs all I asked because even though we did get to know each other a little bit more at the conference it wasn‚Äôt enough because we really were immersed and wanted to focus on the purpose of the talks were about. He said yes, and I guess his friend Augustine overheard me asking. On the way back home Augustine asked me can I ask you a personal question? Do you like John ? I was honest and I responded yes. He asked me, but does he know that? I said yes he does. He asked me how does he know that? I responded because I told him I was honest and he felt the same way. 

Augustine was like Well that‚Äôs emasculating and I think if the guy really liked you, he would do it himself he needs to be the one that initiates. I understand that but I just started to get to know him. And John even suggested that we should see each other. Also, I had to this question was it wrong of me to do that? Also, I noticed that whenever. I brought up John . Augustine would say oh well he doesn‚Äôt drive. He doesn‚Äôt do this. And doesn‚Äôt have a job. Is that really a true friend a true Catholic friend? Because the more I observed that. He kept just degrading him. And I basically felt like. And I reflected real friendships will celebrate you in your high and mourn with you during your lows.  And not put you down in any circumstances. And only judge you it absolutely necessary. But I just kept sharing that he. Wasn‚Äôt with his standards.

In a quiet suburban neighborhood lived a family of four. Christine, the loving and ever-vigilant mother; Matthew, her steady husband; their teenage son, Max; and their youngest, little Vivienne, who at six years old was filled with boundless energy and an imagination that knew no limits.

Vivienne hated funerals. Not because of the somber mood or the grief, but because they were dreadfully boring. People cried, whispered in hushed tones, and there was never any room to run around or play. She found the stillness suffocating.

One evening, after a long battle with illness, Grandpa Lucas passed away. Christine and Matthew knew they had to attend the funeral service, and Max, though not fond of the event, would go with them. Vivienne, on the other hand, begged to stay home. After all, she was a big girl now, and she didn‚Äôt want to endure the long, quiet hours of the funeral.

Christine hesitated. They had never left Vivienne alone before, and though it was just a short service, the thought of leaving her home alone made her uneasy. But with no one available to babysit, they finally decided to let her stay. They gave her strict instructions before leaving.

‚ÄúVivienne, listen carefully,‚Äù Christine said, crouching down to meet her daughter‚Äôs gaze. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll only be gone for an hour, alright? Just one hour.‚Äù

Vivienne nodded eagerly, her blonde curls bouncing as she did.

‚ÄúYou know the rules, sweetie,‚Äù Matthew added. ‚ÄúNever open the door for anyone, not even if you know them. Understand?‚Äù

‚ÄúGot it, Daddy!‚Äù Vivienne chimed.

‚ÄúAnd your snacks are in the fridge. If you get hungry, help yourself, okay?‚Äù Christine kissed her daughter‚Äôs forehead, still feeling a twinge of concern.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, Mommy. I‚Äôll be fine!‚Äù Vivienne flashed a wide, innocent smile, her baby teeth peeking out like little pearls.

With one final glance back, Christine, Matthew, and Max left for the service, the door clicking shut behind them.

The house was quiet now, save for the faint hum of the refrigerator and the occasional creak of settling wood. But Vivienne, ever the bundle of energy, wasn‚Äôt bothered by the stillness. She had her toys, her tablet, and an entire evening to herself. As the minutes ticked by, she entertained herself by watching silly videos and dancing around the living room, her little feet twirling and hopping with joy.

Meanwhile, at the funeral service, the atmosphere was heavy with sorrow. Christine sat in the pew, her mind drifting between thoughts of her father and concerns about leaving Vivienne at home. The service was thankfully brief, and soon, the family found themselves walking back to the car, eager to return home.

Christine pulled out her phone and decided to check in on Vivienne. As the phone rang, she could hear the faint sound of music playing in the background when her daughter finally answered.

‚ÄúHi, Mama!‚Äù Vivienne‚Äôs voice chirped happily. ‚ÄúI watched some videos today, and I learned how to do a new dance! Wanna see?‚Äù

Christine smiled, feeling some of her earlier worries slip away. ‚ÄúOf course, my love,‚Äù she replied, her heart warming at the sound of her daughter‚Äôs excitement.

On the other end, Vivienne set the phone down on the coffee table, and as the video call began, she leaped into the middle of the living room, facing the TV. She started dancing, her tiny feet spinning and hopping in the carefree way only a child could manage.

For a moment, Christine watched, her smile widening as Vivienne twirled. But then, a small detail caught her attention‚Äîa subtle detail that sent a chill down her spine.

Vivienne was dancing, yes, but the phone‚Ä¶ the phone wasn‚Äôt sitting on the coffee table or propped against a stand. It was held aloft, moving ever so slightly, as if someone was adjusting the angle.

Christine‚Äôs heart skipped a beat. Her eyes widened as she leaned forward, her voice barely holding back the rising panic. ‚ÄúVivi, sweetie‚Ä¶ where is your phone?‚Äù

Vivienne, still twirling and out of breath from her dance, responded without thinking. ‚ÄúMr. Guby‚Äôs holding it!‚Äù

Christine felt her blood turn to ice.

""Who?"" she asked, her voice trembling now.

""Mr. Guby!"" Vivienne repeated cheerfully, completely oblivious to the dread filling her mother‚Äôs chest.

Christine's mind raced. *Mr. Guby*‚Ä¶ Was that one of her stuffed animals? Vivienne had always named her toys, sometimes giving them personalities so vivid that they almost felt real to her. But something was wrong‚Äîterribly wrong.

‚ÄúVivi‚Ä¶‚Äù Christine forced herself to ask, even though her voice was breaking. ‚ÄúDid you open the door for someone?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, Mama!‚Äù Vivienne replied, almost offended by the suggestion. ‚ÄúHe came in through the window.‚Äù

At that moment, it felt as if the ground had fallen away beneath Christine. She couldn‚Äôt breathe, her fingers tightening around the phone as she tried to stay composed.

‚ÄúVivienne, sweetie, listen to me carefully,‚Äù Christine said slowly, fighting to keep her voice calm. ‚ÄúWhere is Mr. Guby now?‚Äù

Vivienne stopped dancing and turned, as if looking behind her. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs right here, Mama! He‚Äôs standing by the window. He‚Äôs really tall!‚Äù

Christine‚Äôs stomach lurched. The window. The very window she had made sure to lock before leaving. Her mind raced, thinking back to all the stories she had read online‚Äîstories about strangers breaking into homes, stories about things much worse than that.

Matthew, sensing the fear in his wife‚Äôs voice, looked over at her, concern etched across his face. ‚ÄúChristine, what‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù

But Christine couldn‚Äôt respond. She was already dialing the police on her phone with trembling fingers. ‚ÄúMatthew‚Ä¶ someone‚Äôs in the house.‚Äù

Without wasting another second, they rushed to the car, the panic clear in their every movement. Christine‚Äôs mind was spinning as the car sped down the quiet streets toward their home, every second feeling like an eternity. The police would be there soon, but not soon enough. She couldn‚Äôt stop replaying Vivienne‚Äôs innocent voice over and over in her head: *He came in through the window.*

As they neared the house, Christine‚Äôs heart pounded in her chest. The lights were still on, illuminating the cozy interior that now felt like a trap. She leaped out of the car before it even fully stopped, rushing to the front door.

Vivienne was standing in the living room when Christine burst through the door, her little face lighting up when she saw her mother. ‚ÄúMommy! Did you see my dance?‚Äù

But Christine wasn‚Äôt looking at her daughter. Her eyes darted frantically around the room, scanning every shadow, every corner, until they landed on the window‚Äîslightly open, the curtains fluttering softly in the breeze.

Her heart clenched as she slowly walked toward the window, dread building in her chest. She peeked outside, but there was nothing. No sign of anyone. Just the dark, quiet night.

‚ÄúVivi,‚Äù Christine said quietly, turning to face her daughter. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Mr. Guby now?‚Äù

Vivienne pointed toward the window again, smiling as if nothing was wrong. ‚ÄúHe went outside. He said he‚Äôll be back soon.‚Äù

The sound of sirens echoed in the distance, growing closer with each passing second. Christine turned to Matthew, her face pale and her body trembling. ‚ÄúWe need to get her out of here.‚Äù

The police arrived moments later, combing through the house, checking every window and door, but they found no signs of forced entry. No footprints, no fingerprints. Nothing.

As the night wore on, Vivienne was tucked safely into bed, completely unaware of the danger that had been lurking so close. But Christine couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that something was terribly wrong. She sat in Vivienne‚Äôs room, watching her sleep, her thoughts racing.

Just as Christine began to drift off, a soft tapping sound echoed from the window. Her heart leapt into her throat as she stared at the dark glass, her breath catching in her chest.

There, just outside, she saw it‚Äîa tall, thin figure standing by the tree line. It was too dark to make out any features, but she could feel its gaze. It was watching. Waiting.

Her blood ran cold as she realized one horrifying truth: *Mr. Guby hadn‚Äôt gone away. He was still out there.*

And he would be back.",1,1729660972.0,horrorcummunity,0,1.0,False

One simple yet effective way to transform your space into a cozy haven is by choosing the right rug. Rugs help define areas, add texture, and bring warmth to even the tiniest of homes. In this guide, we'll explore how to maximize small spaces with the best rugs and offer tips for selecting the perfect rug for your apartment, with a special focus on finding the best [rugs in Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/rugs) and [outdoor rugs](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/textiles/outdoor-rugs).

**1. Choosing the Right Size**

In a small apartment, the size of your rug is crucial. A rug that's too small can make the space feel disjointed, while one that‚Äôs too large might overwhelm the room. The key is finding the right balance. For living rooms, choose a rug that allows the front legs of your furniture to rest on it. This will help define the seating area without consuming too much floor space.

If you‚Äôre looking to divide an open-plan apartment into different zones, use rugs to create distinct areas, like a small dining nook or a cozy living corner.

**2. Opt for Lighter Colors**

Lighter-colored rugs work wonders in small spaces as they make rooms feel larger and more open. Neutral shades like beige, light gray, and ivory can brighten up a room and add a calming effect. If you want something more vibrant, pastel hues can also create a sense of space while adding a touch of color.

For residents of Dubai, where natural light is abundant, these lighter shades can reflect sunlight and make your apartment feel even more spacious. At a [rug store Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/rugs), you‚Äôll find an array of rugs in light tones that are perfect for maximizing your cozy space.

**3. Consider Textures and Patterns**

When working with small spaces, the texture and pattern of your rug can have a significant impact. Flatweave rugs are ideal for small apartments because they take up minimal space and are easy to clean. Their thinner profiles are perfect for busy areas like entryways or hallways.

For a little flair, opt for subtle patterns like geometric shapes or soft florals. These patterns can add visual interest without overwhelming your apartment. If you want a statement piece, go for a bolder pattern, but ensure that it complements your existing decor.

**4. Rugs for Different Areas**

**Living Room:** To create a cozy and inviting living space, choose a rug large enough to sit under the coffee table and at least part of the furniture. A well-placed rug can anchor the space and make it feel complete.

 **Bedroom:** For the bedroom, consider a smaller area rug to place under the bed. You can also opt for runners on each side of the bed for added warmth and style.

**Kitchen or Dining Area:** Flatweave rugs work well in kitchens or dining spaces due to their durability and ease of cleaning. They‚Äôre ideal for small apartments where dining and living areas blend together.

**Outdoors:** For those with a balcony or small patio, don‚Äôt neglect the power of an outdoor rug. These rugs are designed to withstand the elements, making them a great addition to your outdoor space. An outdoor rug can instantly create a cozy atmosphere on your balcony, transforming it into a mini outdoor retreat.

**5. Outdoor Rugs for Small Spaces**

If you‚Äôre lucky enough to have outdoor space in your apartment, maximize it with outdoor rugs. These rugs are designed to be durable, weather-resistant, and easy to clean. They add an element of comfort to your patio or balcony while tying together your outdoor decor. Choose natural tones or patterns that complement your surroundings and give the area a cohesive look.

In Dubai, where outdoor living is popular year-round, outdoor rugs are an essential decor piece to consider. A trip to a rug store in Dubai will reveal a variety of styles perfect for both indoor and outdoor use, making it easier than ever to extend your home‚Äôs style beyond its walls.

**6. Shopping for Rugs in Dubai**

If you're based in Dubai, you're in luck. The city offers an impressive range of rug stores with various styles, sizes, and prices. When shopping for rugs in Dubai, you'll find everything from traditional Persian designs to modern, minimalist styles that suit small spaces. Many rug stores in Dubai also offer outdoor-specific rugs, perfect for those with balconies or patios.

When searching for the ideal rug, consider visiting multiple stores to explore a wide variety of options, or consult with an expert to find the perfect fit for your space.

**Final Thoughts**

Maximizing a small apartment with the right rug is all about finding balance. With the right size, color, and texture, a rug can elevate your space, making it feel cozy and stylish without overwhelming the room. Whether you‚Äôre looking for rugs in Dubai or a durable outdoor rug, the perfect piece can truly transform your apartment.

By following these tips, you'll be able to find the best rugs for your cozy apartment and create a warm, inviting space that feels just right.",1,1729660367.0,u_homeandsoul,0,1.0,False

Of course there‚Äôs other things like the flare 58 and I‚Äôve found out that not all espresso machines run 58mm (like the la pavoni) so I‚Äôm interested in what kind of shots I could pull with that. I also understand that there‚Äôs things like the londinum vectis or the argos Odyssey that run spring lovers so you don‚Äôt get to choose exactly how much pressure goes into it but they seem cool in that there‚Äôs no need to choose and it does the work for you.

Outside of that, if I do go fully automatic general concerns are pretty simple. I want the beautiful look of full chrome/metal. None of that cheaper looking stuff like the gaggia classic (no disrespect, I understand it‚Äôs a great machine) but at my price point I truly do want something that looks good.

If you guys want, maybe go ahead and give me two or three different options, one that would be good for one type of thing another that would be better at another type of thing, etc.  Show me my options

1ga2psk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ga2psk,Tips for keeping warm,"It's getting cold out in the northern hemisphere and sleeping with a hot water bag, wrapped in a sweater inside my sleeping bag keeps me warm all night.

I know that not everyone has hot water, so here are some ideas if you don't: An electric kettle is nice if you have space and access to power outlets.  Gas camping stoves.  I've attached an image of an 12V immersion boiler that boils pretty quickly and doesn't take up much space in the car.  Other options: fire, asking for hot water at a gas station or restaurant, or ignoring this post.

A hot water bag is the most ideal container, but I've used other things in the past, including wine bottles, pickle jars, nalgene bottles, aluminum water bottles and Coke bottles.

Wrapping it in something keeps the heat for longer.

Words of caution:  

Glass can break if you change the temperature too quickly.  Don't hold it in your hand when you pour and use glass as a last resort.  Probably, just don't use glass.

Don't heat the water to a temperature that can burn you.  Be careful when pouring.  Use a funnel if it makes sense.

Pickle jars tend to ""spit"" after you put the lid on and don't always seal.  If it spits boiling water, you can burn yourself.  Also, glass jars are hot, so have something on hand to handle them.  Or don't use glass.

Plastic shrinks, so if using plastic, go high volume and lower on the temperature.

Read the instructions on how to use the immersive boiler. Follow the instructions.  Have ready a coffee cup or something appropriate to hold it while it cools off.  Don't use it while driving.

Check that there aren't any leaks in your container.  You're going to be a lot colder if you're sleeping in a wet bag.

In conclusion, don't burn yourselves, cut yourselves or spill on yourselves and have a warmer night's sleep

**Genre:** Mystery, hidden/find the object(?), puzzle

**Estimated year of release:** probably 2005-2015?

**Graphics/art style:** 2D, the backgrounds were realistic and the characters were realistic but a bit stylized. Each level took place in only one room, so only one image of a room at a time. I remember that when you got to certain parts of a puzzle it would switch to a different image as a close-up of the part of the puzzle that needed extra detail to become easier to do.

**Notable characters:** The main character was a young girl with brown hair. The only other characters I can remember are the girl's grandma or mom in the first level and a teacher in the second level.

**Notable gameplay mechanics:** I don't remember what was being collected, but in each level, you needed to collect items that were relevant to the plotline. The puzzle aspect of the game came in when you had to move things around and combine items you found to be able to access where the needed items were. All I can remember from the first level is moving newspapers from a coffee table, and finding a key to open a wooden cabinet in the dining room. All I can remember from the second level is getting stuck at a part where you needed to put chalk somewhere.

**Other details:** I don't remember the title screen or how the story starts or what it's about, but the game had dialogue between characters in a bubble at the bottom of the screen with their character sprites behind them. I can't remember if they changed expressions or not. The dialogue/story portion would be at the beginning of the level, and then after they give you the goal of what to look for, the actual game begins. The first level took place in a dining room (presumably of the grandmother/mom?), facing the left side of the table, a wooden/glass cabinet, a little plant in the corner, and above it, a big window. In the second level, I remember the teacher saying something like ""I don't think you'll find anything here, though."" It took place in an empty classroom, from the back of the class facing the front, being able to see all of the desks and the teacher's desk in the front, along with a chalkboard/whiteboard in the very back. I only remember these two levels because I kept getting stuck on the second one. It had an unsettling vibe with the background music and maybe voice acting?

1ga2agm,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1ga2agm/bathouse_to_work_crush/,Bathouse to Work Crush,"Ok so about three years ago I went to the local bathhouse (there was a phase where I was going quite a bit). I am a little bit older (47m) now, but I really do look very good for my age, esp at this time. Usually the BH is kind of a flop for me, and most guys there seem kind of meh, with a few standouts. Anyways I meet this guy one night and of course he's much younger than I am but we sort of had a good time together. Kinda ran around slutting as a team. A couple of Saturday nights go by and I decide to go again. I think to myself, that would be cool if that guy was there again. So I go there and low and behold, he's there. Same thing happens except this time there's another guy who's into to him to I sorta took a small step back. Eventually the three of us sorta hooked up, although it was mostly oral, it was still a good time. So the three of us walk out together and I realize I gotta get this guys name, number, something. I mention I saw him there a couple weeks before, but he didn't seem to remember me which struck me as odd since we spent a couple of hours horsing around. Before we go our separate ways, I ask his name. He's super polite he gives me his name, I'll call him Rick.

I get in my car and type his first name into Facebook and he comes up as the first suggestion because he is friend of an old friend on there.  I friend request him a few days later and he accepts. So I write him a message, sort of saying that I thought he was a really cute guy and gave off a fun energy. I followed it with a, ""yeah I know, kinda thirsty huh?"" because I knew I was being very direct. He was like, ""Thanks, and that's ok, no worries!"". But I failed to really follow up or suggest we hang out again, in fact I wasn't sure if he even remembered me. Over the next several months I would like his posts on Facebook, and sometimes comment on his stories. I spaced it out so I wasn't seeming too desperate, no more than once or twice a month per comment/like. About a year ago I was at the gym and thinking, well shit, I'm at the age where if you want something, you had better ask. So I messaged him one last time and was like, hey do you you know how we became friends on Facebook? He didn't remember where we had met, he asked if it was Nude Yoga, which was sort of in line, but would have been much less smutty. I told him we had met at the bathhouse, twice, and I've been following him on Facebook since. He asked if we fooled around and I said yes. I followed up with something along the lines of, ""Hey If you ever want to get a drink, or a cup of coffee sometime, let me know!"" to which he obliged, ""Yeah boo, I'll let you know!"".

His response sounded obligatory and I can read a room but I felt better having put an offer of some sort out there so I could sort of mark off that prospect. Also, I am 45 years old and this guy is mid 20's, so of course I'm thinking maybe I'm just too old, but I am a fit, lean guy who surfs, good job ect.

I felt better that I had said something so I didn't follow up. About six months later I realized I hadn't seen anything from him for a while and I realized he had unfriended me. So I'm like, shit, I must have really come off as a creeper. Ouch, but I guess it wasn't meant to be.

About three months ago I was walking into my work (I work at a casino) and I see a guy walk by and out of the corner of my eye it looks like him. It made me think about Rick, but I didn't realize at first it was him. I also hadn't seen him in person since the BH back in 2021. I see him a couple more times in passing and I'm like oh shit, Rick works at my Casino. I find out he works for the Event team, and I work for Casino Marketing so our paths cross from time to time. A situation eventually comes up where I have to speak to him about something that happened and I flag him down and call him by name, RICK! He turns around and he seems really shy in that moment. There are several moments where we have interactions and even a few brief conversations. Now when we walk past each other we always look and acknowledge each other and he has made it a point to go out of his way to come talk to me on a couple of occasions. Today I went to lunch with my marketing team and he was in the lunch line. He looks over at me and nods and I nod back. A couple of my coworkers are like, holy shit, that guy is looking at you like he wants to eat you for lunch! I am trying to be objective, but I think he might seem interested to some degree at this point.

At this point I have no clue if he knows that I am the guy who 'stalked' him from Facebook. Our personal interactions at work have been in public, so I have just been keeping it light. I really want to tell him I think he's cute, or that I want to get to know him. I don't expect a ton, in fact I sort of like being single, but he's a cutie and hard to ignore. I have thought about replying to the Messenger conversation and saying something along the lines of, ""Hey, apparently you work at my work now!"" or hopefully something much more clever, but then I am replying to a conversation that ultimately led me to being unfriended. It's been difficult to talk to him at work, since our paths only cross naturally about every two weeks or so, or else I have to go way out of my way to interact with him. I am normally very charismatic, joking around a lot, but when I like someone I have trouble thinking of what to say. Should I refrain from messaging him back and just try to pretend that conversation didn't happen?  I need advice, I have been single for a number of years now and before that I was in a 10 year relationship. Before that I was the young one and would be 'perused', especially by older. Now I am the older guy and don't really know how to persue effectively. Apparently he has been at my work for 6 months, but sometimes people come and go quickly and I'm afraid if I don't make a connection soon I'll miss the opportunity. I apologize for the long post!

I collect stationary, I affectionately call my collection a stationary addition. I like to go to shows and listen to music. My all time favorite artist is Death Cab for Cutie. I like to watch dumb movies and explore on my off days. I'm taking a break from uni but would like to eventually go back via an online program. I'm willing to send pictures of what I look like if you are too.

I look forward to meeting you! I know that you're out there. And if you're too shy to reach out or would prefer I start the conversation, just comment your favorite color and I'll dm you ‚òÜ

I sit at a desk and have improper posture. Doesn‚Äôt hurt when I breathe or really move. Didn‚Äôt really go away with medicine. Reading the worst and having anxiety about it.

# About Me:

  
I‚Äôm a 28-year-old PhD student in the final stretch of my program, exploring the fascinating world of Artificial Intelligence. Alongside my studies, I‚Äôm also building an AI-based startup here in Korea, which means I‚Äôll be staying here for the foreseeable future.

My academic journey has been quite the adventure:

* Master‚Äôs from Korea
* Bachelor‚Äôs from NUST, Islamabad

Currently, I‚Äôm based in Korea, working as a Research Engineer for a world's leading firm in technology. and enjoying every moment of it! When I‚Äôm back in Pakistan, Islamabad is home‚Äîwhere I have my own residence.

I also happen to be multilingual! I speak five languages: Punjabi, Urdu, English, Arabic, and Korean‚Äîso conversations will never get boring. üòâ

Physically, I‚Äôm a little over 5'11"" (if that‚Äôs something you care about). Spiritually, I‚Äôm a Sunni Muslim from the Arian caste.

# Hobbies & Interests:

  
Traveling is my thing‚ÄîI love exploring new places and experiencing different cultures üåç. Music isn‚Äôt really my vibe, but Urdu poetry? I‚Äôm all in! I especially love Iqbal and Faiz, and I‚Äôm currently training an AI model to become the next great Urdu poet. üòé If you're a fan of meaningful verses and coffee chats, we‚Äôll probably get along just fine. ‚òï

# What I‚Äôm Looking For:

  
I‚Äôm looking for a well-groomed, educated woman who has the mental depth for meaningful conversations and the emotional intelligence to build a strong marriage. Since I‚Äôm settled in Korea, I‚Äôd love to meet someone comfortable with relocating here for a while. But don‚Äôt worry‚ÄîPakistan will always be home, too.

Kids? Absolutely‚Äîbut not right away. I believe it‚Äôs important to build a strong foundation first and take the time to truly know each other. üè°

# My Take on Marriage:

  
For me, marriage is a safe zone‚Äîa partnership built on trust, comfort, and open communication, where we can share our thoughts, dreams, and even fears without judgment. It‚Äôs about knowing that there‚Äôs someone in this world who truly has your back, no matter what.

If this sounds like the kind of relationship you envision too, let‚Äôs start a conversation! üòä",3,1729657894.0,PakistanRishta,1,0.81,False

The grind size and water temperature depend on the type of coffee. For the grind size, I go 1-2 notches coarser than drip.

I begin by pouring 50 mL of water over 10 seconds (00:10), stirring gently 3 times back and forth over 5 seconds (00:15), then adding 100 mL of water over 15 seconds (00:30). I stir slowly back and forth for 10 seconds (00:40) and let the coffee rest for 10 seconds (00:50). Then I release the air, close the lid, invert it onto the jug in 15 seconds (01:05), give it a gentle shake back and forth in 5 seconds (01:10), and let the coffee rest for another 20 seconds (01:30). I begin pressing at 1:30 and finish at 2:00.

Personally, I found this method gives a clear coffee that‚Äôs easy to drink, with a good flavor and aroma, and I can easily distinguish the taste notes. I would love to hear your thoughts on this. I‚Äôm grateful for the time and coffee you‚Äôve spent trying my recipe, and I appreciate all your feedback and critiques. I will use them to improve my coffee brewing.

I have 4 days of leisure in Amsterdam and 1 day of work, so want to figure out how to optimize my time best. Here is what I have planned for Amsterdam so far (London is pending, will focus more on that once I lockin my Amsterdam itinerary). It is my first time solo traveling so I want to be able to experience a lot but also be mindful of my body and manage fatigue so that I don't become a zombie halfway through the trip. 

# DAY 1 

* Arrive at hostel and drop off my bags (midday)
* Potentially rent a bike 
* Explore Dam Square and its sights.  
* Explore Red Light District. 
* Check out Stussy Amsterdam 
* Maybe check out some coffee shops or smartshops depending how I'm feeling. 

# DAY 2 

* Try truffles at a coffee shop or a smartshop (recs are welcome!) 
* Van Gogh Museum
* Rijksmuseum
* Take a canal tour 

# DAY 3

* Explore Rotterdam and The Hague. Short train rides so should be doable.

# DAY 4

* Not too sure what I want to do here. Maybe travel a bit more to somewhere outside of the main city? Would love to check out some of the nature and sights, but in the middle of November that will likely be difficult. 

  
I love nature, architecture, and dope views. I'm in my early 20s and am very social and enjoy clubs and bars, but am not super comfortable attending those on my own. If I click with people in the hostel, I would definitely run it up.

My main concern is food: I want to try different kinds of desserts, (real) coffee, and vegan restaurants. Not sure what restaurants or niche places I should try and check out so I would love some recommendations on places. My budget is really flexible, I want to experience as much as I can, so I don't mind spending money as long as it's worth it. Thank you all for your time! ",1,1729657483.0,solotravel,2,1.0,False
