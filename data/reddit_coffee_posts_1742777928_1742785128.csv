1jih0w0,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1jih0w0/irish_coffee_and_the_the_other_guy_in_the_movie/,Irish Coffee and the The Other Guy in the Movie,"I couldn't sleep until 5 am.

And I woke up not as sad, but still a heavy feeling.

I'm imagining the last time I'll get to see her in person. The last time I get to touch her, hear her, and even smell her.

The last time her shadow would hug mine.

The last time I get to tell her a good joke, remind her of a funny story we both experienced, the last time I get to ask her about her day in front of me or beside me or while eating or drinking coffee, wasting time together.

The last time I get to ask her out, the last time I get to take her for granted.

I'm imagining giving her parting gifts.

A Rattan bag, because she loves that kind of material. I figured I'd give her a new one in case she needs a spare but I'll have it custom made with her nickname or initials, maybe sunflowers because she loves sunflowers as earrings or necklaces.

A new pair of running or walking shoes because she loves walking to places instead of paying for a ride hailing service. She thinks walking 2 km at 4 pm in humid weather isn't a terrible idea. I also saw her last pair had signs of stitching and repairs since 60 days ago and I couldn't forget about it.

She already has a mug I bought her for Christmas from a famous coffee shop in a mountain region. Maybe I'll also gift her coffee beans so she can have the first month of her new life with good coffee from home.

And every minute of that last day would be heavy, as if my smiles and laughters were lifting hundreds of pounds. As if my eyes had their tearducts glued shut, so tears won't come out.

Every small hug we have, forcefully controlled so my arms wouldn't tighten around her, and so I wouldn't shake, so I would let her go.

I would wish that last day or night to not end. I would internally scream ""please stay please stay please stay"" as I wish her good luck and take care just before I leave her.

And it will be the most depressing time of my life.

Having met the most amazing, adventurous, smart, funny, and purpose driven woman when I was already prepared to try love again, and be visibly, forcefully, so damn happy that she's going to have a life without me.

Because that's the most mature thing I could do and that's what I want her to remember me as, not some desperate idiot clinging onto a relationship that never had time to even simmer or sprout from the ground.

The saddest days I'll have, then, would be her leaving and her coming back, because I'm now afraid of seeing someone else make her happy in my stead, even though I know for a fact that at the same time I should want it.

I couldn't give her the peace and comfort she demanded, and as much as I want to try again, I'm not sure if she'll even entertain the thought, the thought of me.

Me, randomly telling her about my day and her replying with the dumbest looking gifs and memes. Me asking about how she is, what her weekend was like, and her telling me it's all mundane so I try to make her laugh digitally.

Or me being unsure about living on my own, and her reassuring me that I could do it because she did it after running away from home with barely any money, and I had lots of it with a supportive family.

So I moved out because she believed in me, and so I can hang out with her more because my new place would be nearer or at least be more accessible thanks to the MRT and her being 15 minutes from SM North.

The irony is just when I moved closer, that's when our hearts grew apart. One misunderstanding, one misinterpretation, text lost in digital translation, and it killed the soil where the seeds of our deep friendship were hastily thrown and clumsily watered and grown.

She said she didn't want anything serious, and I reassured her it wasn't; that I saw her as a little sister.

That was the truth at the time. I was always honest with her. I saw her as this intimate friend who knows my secrets and skeletons, until she said she's not planning on returning.

Right now I do love her. I'm now sure of it. I didn't think much of it first, that maybe this is just some infatuation that I shouldn't take seriously in my 30s.

Now that I am certain my days with her are numbered, and it will all be so damn hastily spent with me begging for more time before we end our time together.

Our little first date, a random friendly hangout, a French movie that made me see a woman giving birth in 4k and coffee dinner.

It started with an out of the blue 3:30 pm text and my reply that said ""I'll be there by 6"" not because I wasn't eager, but because Metro Manila traffic from my real address grounded me in reality. I rushed and made it just 5 minutes prior.

I may not have peace in the coming days, weeks, months. Maybe not even after she leaves. However, I trust myself enough to move forward but in pain, with a heart that's burdened by the weight of what could be the biggest what if of my life.

I'm now thinking of maybe pursuing her in Ireland, or maybe trying to stay connected as much as I can, and maybe go there even for just a month to be a good friend again.

Her ""senor Robertoo"" she rants with, the always busy friend she calls at 1 am because she's having a panic attack and me stopping my world so I can help hers turn.

But that's all in the future, a place I dread to visit knowing one thing that will happen.

All I know is, I have to work harder, so she'll see that I'm doing well, that I'm also just as ambitious as her.

That I'm not a loser. That I'm still the same man who was so good at his craft that her eyes couldn't help but be fixated with mine, as I told her about random food facts, supplements, and weight loss science or trivia about coffee, our favorite drink.

She hates her eyes because of her Graves disease, with how bulged they are (only a tiny bit), but I adored them from the very first night they saw mine. I told her:

""I like your eyes. They glow when looked at. When you were asking me about random food stuff and I was looking at them, it felt like you were looking at my soul.""

She replied:

""Whoa, yeah. I get too intense sometimes. Did you feel na I was hounding you for answers?""

I said:

""I wouldn't call that intense. More like I get lost in them. Parang ganun.""

Her:

""Sometimes I feel like I scare people off.""

And me:

""If people are scared of you being curious, then that's on them.""

It was in that bar in Intramuros, as we were having a quick break after 2 hours of walking with a tour group last November. I went behind the counter, pretended to be a barista and asked her ""so, what can I get you"" and I leaned across the table to meet her gaze and smile and curiosity.

That was the first time I saw her. I didn't pay attention at first, but I knew I loved talking to her. I was attracted by how she was amazed at ideas and facts I found dull or ""everyday.""

The night after, I said she should join us at a year end pool party because I found her fun to hang around with.

Little did I know that was the beginning of something happy, with an ending that's tragic for me, but the very best for her.

In the end, I thought I was the hero of this movie, but it was her autobiography after all, and I'm just the character whom the audience will feel sad about.

The other guy in the movie. The main guy wasn't me, but I was the one who was there while main guy wasn't even in the script or the trailer or the books.

Hopefully, I make the audience proud, too.",1,1742784831.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False

She said yes but it would have to be after spring break since she was leaving the next day. Throughout the week we had been texting and the convos seemed to be going really well. The only problem is she takes forever to respond, sometimes a day. She even posted some pictures on Instagram early in the day one time and only responded at night. It seems pretty obvious that she’s not interested anymore however when she does respond, she continues the convo well and asks thoughtful questions back, which is why I am kind of confused.

Storytime on how I’ve been arguing with a guy I met there for 2 weeks now. 😞” we listen we don’t judge “,"Ok so I matched with a guy there 2 weeks ago and we have been combative and toxic 😫 before we have actually even linked. Right now we are absolutely not meeting and we’ve blocked each other on social media and contacts. How we got there ? Because we are both crazy obviously and too alike it’s scary. We started off strong like conversation , chemistry and all. The first thing we kind of got into a back and forth about is us meeting up. He said that he wanted to meet me for coffee and then go back to his place. I said coffee ..sure but going to his place no. Now we are both on the same page about what we are looking for currently which is fwb, however I stated I wanted to be friends first and the benefits come after. Essentially getting to know each other , learn if we actually like the other on a friend level before fwb. I told him I wanted something consistent and that’s closed off meaning we exclusively are sleeping with each other. He agreed to everything he had been celibate for the past 7 months and he’s very selective and everything sounds what he’s looking for. But he’s like why can’t you come over after coffee and I’m basically letting him know it’s because I’m not doing anything sex wise and I don’t want it to lead further. He’s like so what’s even the point of us linking. 😭 so I reminded him then and there about what I just explained I’m looking for and if it’s not something he wants we can just part ways no bad blood. He’s like no it’s cool I understand. After that we just keep butting heads about little things and I’ll admit im used to being in control and so is he so we clashed. But we really wanted to see it through. We ended up getting into it real bad and he blocked me. So I messaged him on Instagram 🥴 and of course he responds and unblocked me. By the way he’s very sassy, but idk I guess we got addicted to the conversations outside of us butting heads and what could be’s. But today it came crashing down when we got into a 3 hour argument over me linking with someone last week. So recall he blocked me , we didn’t speak for days until I messaged him on Instagram and he unblocked me. In between that time I linked with another guy I met on bumble. I told him about it when we started back talking (today ) and he went off and started calling me everything under the sun. But it’s this toxic cycle of arguing and then making up which we like too much. I told him he was  sadistic and he said I was a masochist which I believe has some truth to it. But everything he said stung and it keeps replaying in my head on repeat 😭 and I feel very low not gonna lie. Not really looking for advice I’m just ranting …",1,1742784568.0,blackgirls,0,1.0,False

After going through all the firmware updates which took close to an hour (on home WiFi, while having coffee who cares) the device was acting as it should be. In the settings I renamed the device and it immediately “bricked”

Bricked isn’t the right word but I could only ever connect to the device if I started it in update mode which is holding the flashlight button and power button before launching the app. 

Anyway Citytheatrical got back to me and this is indeed a bug. After renaming some devices you can get stuck in a boot loader loop. They sent me a beta app version through TestFlight and the same reboot steps worked after a couple of tries. 

Tl;dr: if you don’t have to rename your new device, wait for a firmware update. It’s been a long weekend. If this happens to you please email or call tech support , they’re on it ",3,1742784267.0,lightingdesign,0,1.0,False

1jigsws,https://www.reddit.com/r/tcap/comments/1jigsws/chris_apologizes_to_specialguy29/,Chris Apologizes to Specialguy29,"The Reckoning at McDonald’s

The McDonald’s hummed with the quiet chaos of a March afternoon in 2025—families grabbing Happy Meals, workers on quick breaks, and John Kennelly, still 29, sitting alone in a corner booth. His youthful face, unchanged since that fateful summer of 2006, peered over a tray with a Big Mac, fries, and a Coke. He’d come here for a simple meal, a moment of peace in a life turned upside down by a man he’d never asked to meet. His hands were steady as he unwrapped his burger, his conscience clear despite the years of stigma.

The door chimed, and a voice—tentative, almost broken—cut through the noise. “John? John Kennelly?” John looked up, his fry pausing midair, and saw Chris Hansen standing there. The once-confident TV host looked older, worn, his gray coat hanging loose on his frame. His eyes carried a guilt John didn’t recognize from the old days. “Can I sit?” Chris asked, gesturing to the seat across from him. John nodded, curious but guarded. Chris sat, placing a coffee cup on the table with a trembling hand.

“I’ve been wrong about you,” Chris said, his voice low, almost a whisper. “All these years, I’ve carried this, and I need to say it: I’m sorry, John. What I did to you—what we did—wasn’t justice. It was a mistake, and you were the victim.”

John’s brow furrowed, the words sinking in as Chris pressed on. “Back in ’06, I thought I was the hero. You walked into that house—yeah, naked, with a 12-pack of Miller Lite—and I pounced. ‘You said, “Then come in nekid,” and you did,’ I told the world, like it proved something. But it didn’t. You were chatting online, sure, under ‘SpecialGuy29,’ but we set you up. That ‘14-year-old’ wasn’t real—it was a trap, a lure. And the next day, when you came to a McDonald’s like this one, thinking you’d meet someone else? Same deal. Entrapment, plain and simple. You didn’t break any law until we pushed you into it.”

John set the fry down, his gaze steady. He remembered that August in Fairfax, Virginia—how he’d been drawn into those chats, how the sting house had felt like a stage he’d stumbled onto. Then, less than a day later, Chris had cornered him in a McDonald’s parking lot under the name “Shane,” accusing him again before he could even order a meal. “What are you doing here, John?” Chris had barked, painting him as a monster for millions to judge. But John had never met a real kid, never hurt anyone—just answered messages that turned out to be bait.

“I judged you,” Chris continued, his eyes fixed on the table. “I saw your awkwardness, your loneliness, and I turned it into something evil. I made you a villain because it fit the show—ratings, headlines, my ego. But you didn’t deserve that. You were just… a guy, caught in a net we cast too wide. I harassed you here, at a place like this, when all you wanted was a burger. I’m ashamed of it.”

John leaned back, his voice calm but firm. “You didn’t just harass me. You ruined me. I was 29, trying to figure things out, and you made me a punchline. I never wanted to hurt anyone—I wouldn’t have. Those chats? I was curious, stupid maybe, but not a predator. You decided I was guilty before I even had a chance.”

Chris nodded, his face tight with regret. “You’re right. I see that now. You weren’t the threat I made you out to be. We lured you in, staged it all—Perverted Justice, NBC, me. I took a man who hadn’t crossed that line and pushed him over it, then punished him for falling. You were the real victim, John—victimized by me, by the system I helped build. I’m sorry.”

The apology hung there, raw and unpolished. John took a sip of his Coke, letting it settle. He’d always known he wasn’t the monster they’d branded him—just a guy who’d answered the wrong messages, stepped into the wrong trap. And here was Chris, finally seeing it too. “Why now?” John asked, his tone more curious than bitter.

Chris exhaled, rubbing his hands together. “I’ve spent years chasing shadows—*Takedown*, YouTube, all of it. But lately, I’ve been looking back, and I can’t justify what I did to you.

John met his gaze, unflinching. “I’ve been stuck like this—29, frozen—because of what you started. But I never let it make me what you said I was. I’m better than that.”

“I know,” Chris said, standing slowly. “You always were. Take care, John—I mean it.” He turned and left, his coffee untouched, his steps heavy with the weight of his own reckoning.

John watched him go, then took a bite of his Big Mac. The world had judged him, but he’d known the truth all along: he was no villain, just a man wronged by a machine that thrived on shame.

Intermittent fasting (IF) is more than just a trend—it’s a lifestyle shift that can transform your health, energy, and focus. 

But doing it  right is key to reaping the benefits! 

🌟 Start Slow:  

🕒 Begin with a 12:12 fasting schedule (12 hours fasting, 12 hours eating) and gradually increase to 16:8 or longer as your body adapts.  

🚫 Avoid jumping into extreme fasting windows right away—your body needs time to adjust.  

🍎 Focus on Nutrient-Dense Foods: 
 
🥦 Prioritize whole, unprocessed foods during your eating window—think lean proteins, healthy fats, and fiber-rich veggies.  

🥑 Avoid overloading on sugary or processed foods, as they can spike insulin and leave you feeling sluggish.  

💧Stay Hydrated:  

🚰 Drink plenty of water throughout the day—herbal teas and black coffee are also great during fasting hours.  

🧂 Add a pinch of salt to your water if you feel lightheaded or fatigued (it helps with electrolytes!).  

⏰ Time Your Meals Wisely:  

🍽️ Plan your eating window around your lifestyle—align it with your most active or social hours.  

🌙 Avoid late-night eating to support better digestion and sleep quality.  

🧘 Listen to Your Body:  

❤️ Pay attention to hunger cues—if you feel unwell, adjust your fasting schedule or consult a professional.  

🛑 Remember, intermittent fasting isn’t for everyone. Pregnant women, those with medical conditions, or a history of eating disorders should avoid it.  

💪 Combine with Healthy Habits:  

🏋️ Pair IF with regular exercise, but avoid intense workouts on an empty stomach if you’re new to fasting.  

😴 Prioritize sleep—it’s essential for maintaining energy and hormonal balance.

Dentist said they couldn’t save the tooth. This was taken today, Sunday, so day 6 (if you count Tuesday as day 1). I haven’t had a tooth pulled since my wisdom teeth ages ago, I can’t remember what it looked or felt like but I’m worried the hole is not healing the way it should. There’s still a fair amount of swelling/maybe pus drainage? on the outside of my gums, now feels like it’s also in my cheek. The pain is manageable with ibuprofen and acetaminophen but still pretty uncomfortable. I have woken up most nights/early mornings in some amount of pain and pop some OTC pain meds immediately to fall back asleep. I’ve been salt water rinsing, gently brushing at least twice a day (morning and night), using a baby syringe (the big plastic ones) to try and keep food debris out of the hole. Unsure if I overdid it or if this is normal healing. Went to a comfort dental, going to call tomorrow and try and get in for a follow up a week early, too. 

I don’t smoke, I haven’t been drinking (rarely drink regardless), but I am a barista and daily coffee drinker. Mostly have been doing espresso in cold oat or soy milk to avoid the hot drinks issue and trying to avoid letting it touch my lower gums, also drinking water immediately after and swishing with salt water. 

TLDR: this is day 6 post extraction, no nerves because of root canal but still very uncomfortable at times, waking up in pain at night, taking OTC pain meds, still swollen on outside gumline, looks scary in my mouth and worried I screwed up my healing/did something wrong and am going to get a royally painful infection, AGAIN.

The landlord told me that the cat used to be beaten and abused by the previous tenants and that's why it was very afraid of me. I thought it was good for me as the cat would maintain distance from me. Whenever I used to cook, the cat would just come running and watch me cook from a distance. Initially, I used to be very frightened, though if I ever needed to go that way, she used to run away so it was working out for me. But, I always felt bad seeing her as she wasn't fed properly. The landlord and his family used to ignore her for another cat they also had which was ""very cute"" according to them. The other cat was very overweight and used to eat this cat's portion of food as well. Then, one day I asked the landlord if I could give the cat some fish. After he said okay, I gave her a piece of fish after removing the bones. This was going on for a few weeks and after a while the cat became more comfortable around me (vice versa) and after finishing her piece she used to come up and brush her body against my legs. Though I still used to be a bit frightened, her furs used to feel nice. One day, I was watching Netflix and having coffee when she came up to me and sat near me. I don't know how I got the courage, but I picked her up and she sat quietly on my lap. I couldn't believe how lightweight she was. I was severely homesick and depressed being away from my country, but in that moment I felt very happy. Every night around 8 pm when I used to watch netflix, the cat used to come downstairs. Sometimes, I used to find her sleeping outside of my room if I ever went out to have a glass of water in the middle of the night. After a while, the landlord's motherfucker son grew jealous and used to never let the cat come downstairs. Sometimes, I used to hear her clawing on the door to the lower level. I moved out after a while as I rented an apartment but I felt very sad leaving, like I had felt when I left my parents and my sister. I never asked the landlord what the name of the cat was and they always used to refer to her as ""cat"" (they called the other cat Maria or something like that).

I’m more introverted, but I’ve got a lot of heart and depth once you get to know me.

I’m big on music — I collect vinyl and am always on the hunt for good finds. Favorite bands include The Cure, The Smiths, and Cigarettes After Sex, though I’m constantly discovering new stuff. If you’ve ever felt seen by a moody guitar riff or have strong opinions on shoegaze, we’ll probably get along.

When I’m not diving into music, I’m into poetry, alternative fashion, films, and reading. I also have a soft spot for coffee, gloomy weather, and anything with a gothic or old soul vibe. I’m the type who finds peace in small routines, gets lost in thought, and appreciates the beauty in the little things.

I’m not looking for anything chaotic — just someone genuine, who enjoys sharing music recs, random thoughts, or just being a consistent presence. Bonus points if you’re also a little unconventional, artistic, or just get the feeling of not quite fitting the mold.

context: we were watching gabby’s dollhouse this morning, as we often do. sitting on the couch, all good. i sat down next to my son after getting a cup of coffee and he was zoned out and started fluttering his eyes. i kinda froze and just watched him, unsure if maybe he was trying to clear something. when i said his name, he looked at me with that little side eyed gremlin smile little boys make and started laughing, like “haha” laughing. there was no sudden “attention snap” to his movement when he heard his name, like it was very fluid, not startled. 

he’s been a bit of a terror lately but he’s also been fighting a cold with a low grade (99-100.7 never higher) fever for a few days - ive been giving him tylenol bed so he sleeps more comfortably but other than the first day, nothing during the day. he hasnt had much of an appetite, so hangry, drinking lots of fluids, mostly water, a small amount of apple juice and fruit ice pops. he’s been cooped up at home because sick. he’s decided targeting mom is his new source of entertainment (lucky me). today is his first day fever free and he was feeling extra saucey all day. 

background: he’s never done this before that i know of. he does go to daycare. has some serious eye rolls and glares expertly perfected. could this be learned behavior from a kid in his class?

what creeps me out is my husband had a series of unexplained seizures and out of body experiences as a child. he knows nothing of cause and treatment and his parents have no answers or insight- his mom’s a dipshit, his stepmom and dad got custody when he was older. stepmom doesn’t know much and dad passed years ago. whatever it was he grew out of it by his mid-teens and the only thing he can remember is an aversion to red colored foods because he ate tomatoes prior to an episode. 

concern: am i possibly overthinking normal weird toddler behavior? i would call the pediatrician but i wouldn’t even know what to explain or ask them to look for. i’m leaning towards wait and see, but wondering if he’s even capable of acting like that at this age?

I’d love a partner who enjoys traveling, gaming, and just experiencing life together. Let’s build something real.","Hello, and thanks for reading my post!

A bit about me—I’m single, Hispanic, no kids, just a cat and some fish. Fitness is a big part of my life, and I’d love to meet someone who shares that passion. I enjoy cooking, traveling, reading books and manga, and gaming on PC and Switch. Nature is my escape—I love hiking, camping, and exploring natural landmarks.

I speak four languages (two natively, two I’ve learned or am learning). Gardening is another passion of mine, and I dream of one day being self-sufficient with a homestead. I can go on and on, so feel free to ask me anything when we chat!

A few things about my lifestyle—I don’t smoke or use stimulants (besides coffee). I’m not into clubbing or drinking unless it’s in a private setting, and even then, it’s rare. I’m direct and honest, a bit reserved with strangers but completely open with my partner. Affection is very important to me—physical closeness and touch are essential.
What I’m Looking For

    Consistency, honesty, and communication—these are key.
    Someone who wants kids and holds traditional values when it comes to dating and roles. (You can work if you want, but not because you have to.)
    I’d love a partner who enjoys cooking together and someone who is capable and self-sufficient.
    I’m old-fashioned in romance—I open doors, show affection openly, and have a bit of a possessive, protective streak when it comes to my partner.
    I prefer someone needy, who craves attention, affection, and praise. I give my all to my partner and family, so I want someone who thrives on closeness and daily intimacy—sharing meals, sleeping together every night, and being each other’s safe space.

Physical & Lifestyle Preferences

    I’m generally drawn to Asian or Hispanic partners but am open to other backgrounds if we click.
    More than anything, I value compatibility and a partner who complements my life.

We had the same nerdy interests and sense of humor, it seemed too good to be true. So, I asked her out for drinks, and the first date went incredibly well. It ended up lasting 4 hours and probably would’ve went longer if we didn’t have to be up early the next day. I paid for everything including her uber ride home. 

We continued to text and she seemed to get more and more attached to me, honestly, maybe even too attached. I didn’t really mind this, though, and I kept the same energy she had. So, I planned a 2nd date which I had just planned to be a 2 hour museum date; however, we had such a good time it turned into a 10 hour (you read that right) journey around the city. We grabbed coffee, got dinner, and just walked around the city. Again, if I didn’t have to be up early, the date would’ve went longer. (I also paid for everything except her train ride home). Throughout the date, she kept talking about all these plans for me to help her make easter baskets for the kids she nannies, having her teach me swiss, etc. etc. (This was a week ago). 

So, the next few days after the date, we continue texting and she keeps getting more and more lovey-dovey and, again, I was fine with this. However, this all came to a screeching halt one morning where, all of a sudden, she became cold and disinterested. Her texts become colder and shorter, she stopped texting me good morning/good night and today (a week out from our last date) she hasn’t texted me at all but HAS been posting on instagram and she 100% knows I’m seeing her posts. Now, she DID go on a trip with her friends this weekend, so who knows what happened there and maybe that’s related, but the coldness started a day or two before the trip. 

Of course, we’re not exclusive so if she has found another option that is better for her then that is fine, I just feel a little left in the dark, confused, and hurt to be honest. She hyped everything up so much, I would at least like an explanation as to WHY I haven’t heard from her.

1jigfna,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuittingZyn/comments/1jigfna/approaching_6_months_zyn_nicotine_free/,Approaching 6 months ZYN/ nicotine free,"Just found this sub for the first time since when I first decided to quit. My last zyn was October 10th 2024. April 10th will be 6 months nicotine free.

I got my nicotine addiction from JUUL, in the transition from senior in high-school to freshman in college as so many did. As a college kid I did it all, smoked cigs, cigars, dipped, chewed, vaped. The first nicotine transition for me was when Mint JUUL pods got banned. Not willing to go to Virginia tobacco full time (and hating menthol) I became a Mr. Fog and Grizzly pouch man. But, at that time I started seeing ZYN ads. Well, I was 19/20 and the nicotine age got raised to 21. So there was suddenly much greater ease to having my older buddies get me 3 or 4 cans of ZYN that would last me a week or more than to get a disposable vape that I could go through in a couple days (especially while drinking/ “sharing” with friends). The ZYN was much cheaper, lasted me longer, and I could have a ZYN in class or in front of my Mom and she couldn’t even tell. It was the perfect nicotine vehicle.

I had been a JUUL guy, and a Mr Fog guy, but I became the ZYN guy. It was totally different. It scratched an itch for me that I didn’t even know I had. 

I used maybe half or three quarters of a can of ZYN a day for the first year or so. I got to my senior year of college, turned 21 and was able to buy them for myself and it started to ramp up. I was pushing towards one can a day, but used more around studying/ my senior research project. 

Then the worst thing that could’ve happened for my nicotine intake did. I graduated college and got a job working from home. I had money for the first time, and I was buying logs baby. ZYN shortage? I’ll drive around the city until I find wintergreen 6 and buy 4-5 logs. Couldn’t go without them. I was using more than a can a day, putting a second one in for a few minutes before I take the old one out. I couldn’t sleep at night without having one in. At that point I was using 20+ pouches a day. If I didn’t have a can in my pocket I would start to panic. 

I have never been someone who suffers from abnormal anxiety. But of course, using 120mg of nicotine a day, while drinking 2 pots of coffee I started having constant anxiety. I couldn’t sleep at night constantly thinking about death. I almost lost the relationship with the girl I’m about to propose to. I knew I had to quit.  

Grinds coffee pouches got me through the first 3 weeks. They fuck to your mouth up especially if you’ve never dipped, but I don’t think I could’ve stopped without them. I had to have something for flavor and for my tongue to play with.

My body physically hurt, my mind constantly felt numb. I couldn’t think straight at work. In calls my information processing time felt like it doubled. 

At the fourth month was when I noticed all the “pain” stopped. I don’t think any of the pain was real, just mental. Your body screaming at your mind like a toddler. 

I got involved at this point with two Bible study groups at church. I got involved with the Young Professionals group at work. I had to meet new people who didn’t know me as the ZYN guy. I think this was a very important part for me.

It’s been six months and maybe once a week I get the itch to get a ZYN. It’s not the same painful ear ringing addiction itch that I had for the first two- three months. But it’s the kind of itch that actually gets you in trouble. Many of us can tough it out through the first stage. It’s the “fond memory” itch that is more dangerous.

It’s hard still because the mental addiction is so strong, we let these things become part of our identity when they’re not. You’re not a ZYN guy, or a vape guy. You’re you and hopefully that’s being a strong, charismatic, husband, boyfriend, dad, friend, colleague and Man. 

That is what keeps me from falling victim to the “fond memory” itch. I don’t want one of the things people think about when they think of me to be my addiction to a nicotine product. My Dad passed when I was a senior in high school from pancreatic cancer, and I and most others still think of him as a “Marlboro Man”, it’s one of the first things you think of. But he was and is so much more than that. 

I won’t let these products define me. And you shouldn’t either. I’m praying for everyone in this group to succeed in quitting. Get Grinds or similar, and if you’re like me you may have to redefine yourself to be successful. God bless.",7,1742782915.0,QuittingZyn,4,1.0,False

My partner has POTS symptoms (syncope, HR going up like crazy after standing, extreme extreme fatigue) but her doctors are attributing it all to her depression. Her sleep study and blood tests are normal, including electrolyte panel.

Her diet is imo not very salt heavy (raisin bran for breakfast, a coffee, fruit and a fiber bar for lunch, whatever I make for dinner). ARFID makes it tough for her to eat anything and she feels too full after these meals to add anything. One propel packet a day does seem to help some.

Just the sterile smell of bleach and the gentle hum of a fan. 

I awoke on ice cold floor tiles, facedown in a puddle of my own drool.

I remembered my name instantly. I was Mary.

I was 38 years old.

But that was it. I had no idea who I was or where I had come from.

The room was stark white and clinical, with four TV screens in front of me. 

The screens were old, the kind from my childhood, with a built-in VCR, chunky and box-like. 

When I woke up, they were on standby, static prickling across the glass. 

I demanded where I was, my mouth filled with rotten tasting ick. 

Silence. 

The buzzing lights above flickered off, leaving me in the dark, disoriented and, I guess, forced to look at the four screens. 

Below them sat a small glass table with a steaming cup of coffee and a single cookie. 

For a while, I was too scared to move. I sat on my knees, trying to remember anything about my life. 

But like broken puzzle pieces, I had come apart, unraveling, left only with my name and age.

Was I suffering from memory loss? 

I checked myself over, testing for a head injury. I knew exactly how to perform health checks, almost obsessively checking for concussions.

That told me something. I was in the medical field, perhaps. But this felt personal somehow. Too personal. 

This felt, oh god, like I had done this before. 

And just like those times, revulsion crept up my throat, panic twisting in my gut. 

But I didn’t know why. I didn’t know why I felt sick to my stomach, why my cheeks burned, why my hands trembled.

I was used to checking for bumps and scrapes. I knew exactly where to prod my scalp, running my fingers down my skull.

But I was fine.

I tried to escape. 

There were two cameras on the ceiling, which meant I was being observed, and my instinct screamed at me to get the fuck out. At that point, I didn't care how. I tried the door. Locked. 

I screamed to be let out. 

Again, silence. 

Heavy, suffocating silence that was too *loud*. 

That captured my every breath, making me too aware of my frenzied gasps. 

I noticed a pile of tapes sitting on the VCR player. 

I crawled forward and grabbed the first one at the top of the pile. 

FEB 2024 was scrawled in block capitals across the label. 

I felt like I was in a trance, like something was compelling me. 

The tape felt right in my clammy hands, as if I had held it before. 

I slid it into the machine and pressed play. The screens flickered on.

A room full of kids.

Teenagers.

They looked like college students or high school seniors, seventeen or eighteen years old. 

The room was identical to mine, but smaller. The same four white walls. 

But unlike my room, theirs was empty. No TV screens, no coffee or food. 

Just blank white walls staring back at them, and a single bucket for a toilet. 

I had no idea how long they had been inside. 

But when one of them, a blonde girl with a high ponytail, jumped up and began throwing herself at the walls, panic clawed up my throat. 

This was the start. 

The girl started screaming. 

Almost immediately, another girl, a brunette with tight curls, stood up, strode over to her, and slapped her across the face. I tensed, waiting for a fight to break out. 

But instead of hitting back, the blonde wrapped her arms around the brunette, sobbing into her shoulder. 

A moment later, they both returned to the others, sitting cross-legged on the floor.

I counted ten of them. Five girls, five boys.

They wore identical white shorts and t-shirts, blending into the walls and floor. They looked disoriented. Just like me.

They sat in a circle, wide-eyed, staring at each other like they were strangers.

No.

I moved closer, glued to the screen, watch the them back away from each other. 

One boy shuffled back, jumped up, and tried to run, smacking straight into the wall. 

They *were* strangers.

I wasn’t even sure they knew their own names.

My heart felt like it was lodged in my throat. Were they nearby? 

Were they in the next room? 

If they were in the room next to mine, then we could help each other. 

Already, I was slamming my fists against the door, then the walls, screaming for help. 

“Hello?” I shrieked, before my cry died in my throat, and I almost fucking laughed. I wasn't watching a *live* tape. 

The realization slowly settled in, like cruel  pinpricks sliding into me. 

I turned back to the screens, stumbling over, and grabbing the second tape.

**MAR 2024**.

Something thick and slimy filled my mouth. I placed the tape back on the pile, forcing myself to stay calm. 

I was an adult– and these kids, wherever they were currently, needed my help. 

That's what I kept fucking telling myself, but every so often, my gaze would find the screens once again, and I felt myself unraveling. 

The footage was recorded last year– and the pile of tapes were clearly documenting their captivity. 

Sure, they could have been rescued, I told myself. 

But if these kids were safe, I wouldn't have been kidnapped.  I was already putting the pieces together. 

Whoever took me wanted me to *watch* these teenagers inside this white room with no door– no escape– no food. 

Instinctively, I drank the coffee and ate the cookie. 

Whoever these people were, they weren't interested in hurting me. They wanted to hurt these teenagers. 

The coffee was lukewarm and the cookie tasted familiar, somehow. 

Oven baked and fresh. There was icing, but it had been scraped off. 

Something told me I wouldn't be in the room long– not long enough to get hungry or thirsty. I found myself scanning the ceiling for more cameras. 

There was one attached to every corner, most likely recording every angle of my face. 

My stomach twisted as I studied the monitors. 

Like mine, they displayed different angles of the room trapping the teens. Screen one zoomed in on the girls.""

Four of them had gathered together already, with one stray boy joining them. 

Screens two and three focused on the boys, appearing to be already arguing. 

Screen four was a bird’s-eye view of all of them.

“All right, everyone listen up,” one of the boys stood. 

He looked like the leader type. Tall and athletic looking, thick brown hair and freckles. The kids didn't have names, so I renamed him *Boy #1* in my head. 

Boy 1’s voice was shaking, but he kept his expression stoic. I noticed he kept scratching at his arms—a nervous tic? 

“So, I’m pretty sure someone is playing some fucking sick game.” 

His head tipped back, eyes glued to the camera. 

Screen three zoomed right into his face, his twitching bottom lip. 

He was trying not to cry. 

“But we need to keep a clear head, okay? Does anyone remember anything about themselves?” 

He pointed to himself. 

“I don't know my name. I just know I'm eighteen, and I just graduated high school.”

Boy 1 took a leadership role. He was reluctant, but the other kids seemed to gravitate towards him. 

They went around the room, and it became clear to me that these kids had their memories fucked with too. 
 
The blonde (I named her Girl #1) who freaked out earlier in the tape, was immediately intriguing. 

She didn't know her name, but she *did* tearfully exclaim, “I have a Mom, and I *know* she's looking for me.” which triggered paranoia among the group. 

The brunette (Girl #2) who slapped her, brought up the possibility of Girl #1 being “in” on their imprisonment. 

“That's ridiculous,” Boy #1 snapped. He stood up, assuming his role of leader. 

This room had no concept of time, or night and day. They could have been arguing for hours, and they wouldn't even know it. “Why would she *willingly* join in on whatever this is?”

“Well, this is clearly some kind of test,” Girl #2 said matter-of-factly. 

“What if she's, I don't know, the daughter of one of the researchers— or even a researcher herself!”

“I told you, I'm not in on this! I don't know anything about this!” Girl #1 shrieked, pulling her legs to her chest. 

She seemed genuinely afraid, burying her head in her knees. 

“Please. I just want to go home.” she screamed, and the others jumped. “I want to go home! I want my Mom!”

Girl #2 started to speak, only for Boy#1 to shoot her the mother of all death glares. 

“Don't.” He shuffled over to her. 

“The last thing we need is to lose trust in each other.""

Girl#2 averted her gaze, sliding away from him. “Get the fuck away from me.”

Boy #1 looked hurt. I could tell he was the weakest among the group. 

He made the mistake of acting like a leader– but he was doing just that. 

Acting. In reality, he was just a scared teenager. His bottom lip wobbled, but he shook his head, forcing a wide gritted smile. “Aye, aye, captain.”

“Aww, Freckles thinks we’re getting out of here with the power of ‘friendship’.”

Another kid, a guy with thick blonde hair and glasses, was curled into himself. I was sure he was crying, but no matter how many times the cameras tried to catch his face, he avoided it. 

I called him Boy #2.

“That's fucking ah-dor-able! I'll make sure to rely on *friendship* when we’re starving.”

To my surprise, Boy#1 crawled over to the guy, laying down beside him. 

“Go away,” Boy#2 grumbled into his arms. “I'm trying to manifest my way home.”

Boy#1 snorted. It was the first time I'd seen him smile. 

“And you call *me* delusional.”

The MARCH 24 tape outlined what looked like the first month of their imprisonment. 

I watched it; every second, every camera angle. 

The kids got used to their captivity, distracting themselves with games of Charades and Sleeping Lions. 

They each gave up a clothing item, so they could create a makeshift curtain for the toilet. 

They were given new clothes, but it was weekly, instead of daily. 

Glued to the tape, I barely noticed someone had replaced my coffee with a new one. 

This time, I was given a cupcake– again, with the icing scraped off. 

Ignoring my own circumstances, I watched the kids slowly start to unravel. 

Food was given to them every morning at exactly 7am. 

It was *good* food. I watched them receive trays of McDonald's breakfast, and for the first few days, and then weeks, they seemed okay. 

The kids started to form a plan to escape, orchestrated by #Boy 1.

Their plan was to wait until their food was delivered, and then “attack in numbers.”

However, when their breakfast *was* delivered, it was a single slice of bread. 

I already knew what game their kidnappers were playing. 

After three days of no breakfast, Boy#1 caught on. 

“They're punishing us,” he spoke up, while they were sharing half of a slice of bread. 

The portion sizes were getting smaller and smaller. 

Boy#1 was rationing his own, tearing pieces off and eating them in intervals. 

He was also hiding yesterday's water down his pants. This kid was smart. 

“We formulated a plan to escape, and the people watching us don't want that,” he said. Boy #1’s lips formed a small smile. 

He was planning something. “So, for *now*, we play their fucking game.”

He was right. 

The kids stayed mostly silent all day, and were rewarded with three cooked meals.

Following Boy#1’s words, the teens stayed quiet. 

Boy #2 suggested they named themselves. 

Boy#1 wanted to be named “Clem.” because it felt “right.”

Boy #2, insisted on Ryder. 

Boy#3, who I was pretty sure was  narcoleptic, curled up in one corner was named, “Zzz.”

Boy#4, a hard faced redhead who started most arguments over food, refused to be renamed, so the others called him, “Shitface.”

Finally, Boy#5, a kid with a buzzcut, just shrugged, and called himself, “Buzz.”

""Girl #1—the blonde, who had calmed down—didn't want to be part of the naming ceremony. 

But halfway through, she squeaked, 'Sabrina! I like the name Sabrina.” 

Girl #2, the fiery brunette, immediately called her out. 

“Okay, but *why* Sabrina?” she demanded, her eyes narrowed, hands planted on hips. “So, that's your real name?”

She was ignored– and after realizing her theories weren't helping, Girl#2 sighed, and reluctantly named herself, “Scooby.”

Girl #3, a quiet kid with pigtails, shrugged. “I like Ruby?”

Girl #4, the frizzy redhead with glasses, didn't speak. So, the others gave her a name. 

Mittens. 

Girl #5, who had come up with the naming ceremony, smiled widely. 

She pinned her dark curls into a knotted bun. I had never seen an 18-year-old wear butterfly hair slides.

“Brianna!”

The tape ended on her wide smiling face, the screen flickering off. 

I didn't have any concept of time in that room. 

But I had a feeling the tape had lasted around 2 hours. 

Two hours per tape, and three coffee refills I never saw. 

While I had been watching, another two cupcakes were balanced on a plate. 

I checked them. 

The icing had once again been scraped off. 

For a moment, I was paralyzed, coffee-bile sliding back up my throat. 

“Who *are* you?” I asked the people watching me. 

When I was met with no response, I kept my voice calm. 

“What are you doing to these children?”

I had so many questions. 

*Why was I being made to watch these tapes?*

*Why VCR in 2025?* 

*Were these kids alive or dead– and did I even want to know?*

When my cry bounced back at me, reverberating around the room, I felt myself snap. 

I screamed, but it felt like screaming into a vacuum, my own cry sounding wrong, foreign, not even mine. 

I was trembling, my chest aching, my throat on fire. 

I didn't want to watch it. I couldn't. 

But already, I was crawling over to the pile of tapes, choosing **APRIL 24.**

Whatever happened to these kids, I couldn't stop it. 

But every time that fucking tape slipped from my fingers, I dropped to my knees and grabbed it, running my fingers over the surface. It felt personal, and wrong, and yet *right* in my hands. 

The scratchy label, and the smooth plastic of the tape. 

I rolled it around between my hands, my gaze glued to each screen. 

I wish I never watched them. 

I wish I never knew their names. 

But I had to *know* what happened to them. 

I had to know what twelve months of captivity did to these kids. 

Feeling sick to my stomach, I slid in APRIL 24.

The screen flashed blue, before flickering to life on a still shot of Boy#1 (Clem) with his ear pressed to the door. 

The others were gathered around, sitting in a semicircle. I had missed several days.

The kids looked worn out and tired, their clothes filthy and torn up. 

There was a giant crayonned rainbow on the far wall. 

Mittens (Girl#4) was playing with a green crayon, sticking it in her mouth like a cigarette. 

I guessed they were given them. 

""It's here!"" Clem stumbled back, and my gaze found him once again—his eyes wide.

His cry caused a commotion among the others, and realization slammed into me. 

They were starving again. Clem’s eyes were hollow, his cheeks sunken and significantly pale. There was a certain twitch in his lips I was trying to ignore. 

He had torn off the bottoms of his pants, wrapping them around his head. 

I had no idea how long they had been without food, but the way they moved, almost feral, backing away from the door like startled deer, gave me an idea. It looked like days.

""Everyone, get *back*!"" he snarled, and to my surprise, the others slowly retracted.

Clem really was a leader, glaring down the others until they stepped back. 

Scooby (Girl #2) squeaked in delight when the food was delivered through a slot in the door. Six bags of steaming Five Guys.

But the delivery wasn't finished. 

When they were all tearing into their meals, something else was slid through. 

I barely even noticed it myself. I was too busy watching Clem eating like an animal, stuffing fries down his throat. 

He was going to *choke*. I felt uncomfortable, my hands shaking, like I could reach through the screen and snatch his burger off of him. 

The boy was ravenous. I didn't understand *why* I felt physical pain in my chest. 

I had only known these kids for a few hours, and already, I was attached to them. 

I snapped out of it when the second delivery hit the ground, startling the kids. 

It hit the sterile white floor tiles with a BANG. 

A pick-axe. 

I felt the phantom legs of a spider entwine around my spine. 

Clem dropped his burger, and stood slowly. 

“Don't go near it!” Girl#1 (Sabrina) shrieked. 

Clem didn’t listen to her, and something twisted in my gut. He picked it up, the thing weighty in his hands, then hurled it at the wall.

“Fuck you,” Clem spat, his gaze flicking to camera three.

I felt a visceral reaction running through me, shuffling back on my knees.

Then, unexpectedly, he broke into a manic grin.

“We’re not *that* crazy yet.”

With a mocking bow, he returned to his meal, and the others fell in stride with him. 

Nobody mentioned the pick-axe, and each kid seemed relatively adjusted. 

They played games, drawing on the walls, resorting back to *children*. 

I noticed Shitface (Boy#4) inching towards the axe, but he just laughed when Clem backed him into a corner. 

Shitface shoved him back, maintaining a wide grin. “Relax, Freckles. I'm joking around.”

The girls, however, who had formed a tight-knit group, kept their distance. 

When the next day came around, I think they were expecting no breakfast. 

And they were right. 

“It's okay,” Clem reassured them. “We ate yesterday. We should be okay for a while.”

Sabrina nodded, perched in Scooby’s lap. “He's right! They'll feed us eventually.”

They were *wrong*. 

Three days passed with no food and limited water (I think they were drinking from the toilet) and fights were starting to break out.

Clem was sharing what he'd managed to scavenge, but I could see it in their faces. 

They were starting to lose their balance, growing delirious. 

Sometimes, their wandering gazes found the pick-axe still lying on the floor. 

They looked away, quickly, but it was clear these kids were starting to get desperate. 

The lights flickered off, plunging them into darkness. 

I could still see them through what looked like night vision, but the kids were blind. 

They gathered together in one corner, led by Clem. 

“It's okay.” he kept telling them, his voice shuddering. “We can get through this.”

Another day without food or light, the majority of them too hungry to move, and Shitface (Boy#4  finally snapped. 

“They're not going to feed us,” he announced, slowly getting to his feet, swaying off balance. He stumbled, and alarm bells started ringing in my head. 

“Unless we *use* it.”

Clem stood, but Boy#2 (Ryder), the sandy haired kid, yanked him back down. 

“He's doing it on purpose, bro,” Ryder muttered, his eyes half-lidded. 

He was the peacemaker. “Dude just wants fucking attention.”

To my surprise, Boy#3 (Zzz) and Boy#5 (Buzz) also got to their feet. 

Shit Face crawled over to the axe, blindly grabbing for it. 

“We’re all hungry,” he announced, smacking the blade into his hand. 

His eyes were crazed, almost feral, lips pulled back in a bloodthirsty grin.

Shit Face held up the axe. 

“Soooo, I propose, instead of sitting around singing kumbaya waiting to fucking starve to death, we choose someone for the chop.”

The others screamed, immediately on their feet. The way they responded reminded me of animals in a pack. 

They couldn't *see*, but I think they could sense each other, and that was enough. With a sharp jerk of his head, Clem motioned the others behind him. 

Clem, Ryder, and Sabrina started forwards, uncertain, in the pitch dark. 

But this was already a mistake, and they *knew* that. 

Scooby and Mittens dragged them back, with help from Brianna.

Shitface swung the axe playfully. “I'm just saying! We got actual food when we did what they wanted.” 

He started toward the others in slow, teasing strides. “I nominate Freckles. He is our leader, after all, and what leader wouldn't sacrifice himself?”

The boy’s lips curved into a smirk. “For the *greater good*, dude.”

The lights suddenly flickered on, surprising the group. 

Clem’s side backed away, blinking rapidly, some of them hissing. 

While Shitface stayed nonchalant, swinging the axe. 

They saw it as a mercy, some of the girls breaking down in relief, far off in the corner. 

I saw Shitface’s smile grow, his eyes widening.

*He* saw it like invisible gods were confirming his belief. 

“They gave us *light* back!” he yelled, and through that stone-cold demeanor and wild eyes, I glimpsed a scared teenage boy. 

He was terrified, so he was acting out. 

""They want something back, after what they've given us,"" he announced, slipping effortlessly into the leadership role. ""They've fed us. Now they want payment.""

He was playing with their heads to get them to agree. 

Shitface was smart. Smarter than he let on. 

He was hungry, I understood that. He was fucking scared. 

But resorting to *murder*? 

The boy was in front of Clem in three strides, Zzz and Buzz following. 

Shitface’s smile was spiteful. He’d been itching to take the lead. 

I could tell by the way he moved, that cocky saunter in his step. 

“You want us all to be okay, right?” he murmured, inclining his head mockingly. 

“You want everything to be fucking sunshine and rainbows. So why not take one for the team, o’ fearless leader?”

He dropped to his knees, dramatizing a cry. 

“Please! Oh, *leader*, must you let us suffer? We are your *followers*, after all!”

Clem didn't move. 

Sabrina stood behind him, pressing her face into his shoulder. 

“Ignore him,” she murmured. “Just get back.”

Clem gently shook her away with a defeated sigh. 

“Okay, fine, you're right,” he told Shitface. “Give me the axe.”

Shitface’s expression crumpled with confusion.

He lurched back, but Clem snatched the axe, twisted around, and hacked off Sabrina’s head with a single, brutal chop to the back of her neck. 

I think I tried to stop the tape, but I was frozen, watching pooling scarlet seeping across white tiles. 

The others erupted into screams, and Sabrina’s body landed at Clem’s feet. 

He didn't move, his fingers tightening around the wooden handle, beads of red dripping down his face and splattering his white tee. 

Shitface staggered back, his eyes wide, mouth open. 

Clem, unsteady on his feet, pivoted to face the others cowering in the corner. 

He was eerily calm, his gaze unblinking. I think I had just watched this boy lose his humanity. 

His eyes were vacant, empty pools, a flicker of a triumphant smile twitching on his lips. 

The hollowness of his expression stood out, terrifying and void, and I wondered if I was seeing everything. 

The tapes had been strategically recorded. I had no doubt there was missing footage.

""If they don't feed us, then we will feed them.""

I felt like I was going to puke. 

Boy#1. 

Clem. 

I found myself moving closer to the screen, until I could feel static prickling my face.

He was still a kid. 

I didn't understand *why* I was crying. 

I couldn't stop, my hands were trembling, my heart pounding through my chest. 

He was eighteen. Just graduated. 

I fell back when he swung the axe one more time, his gaze locked onto the camera, before placing it back on the floor. 

Ignoring Sabrina’s body, Clem turned his attention to Shitface. 

“Don't *fuck* with me,” he murmured. Before he  dragged himself to a corner, dropped to his knees, and curled into a ball.

Scooby did her best to cover Sabrina’s body. 

Mittens helped her. 

Brianna sat in a corner, head buried in her knees.

Breakfast came the next morning. Nine individual trays filled with croissants, cupcakes, toast, cereal and chocolate. 

The others stuffed their faces. But I wasn't watching them. 

I was watching Clem.

Who, instead of joining them for breakfast, was crawling towards Sabrina’s body at a snail's pace. 

When he reached her, I expected him to say a prayer, or hug her. 

Instead, Clem soaked his hands in her  blood, and shuffled over to the wall. 

He used her blood like paint, while the wall was his canvas, head inclined, lazily dragging his fingers, scrawling a simple: “:)”. 

The other kids’ expressions were clear on each screen. They were terrified of him. 

Mittens and Brianna were silently eating while Scooby and Shitface stayed away, hiding in individual corners of the room. 

Ryder was the only one trying to make conversation, picking at his chocolate croissant. 

But even his gaze was frantic, flicking back and forth between Clem and the blood-stained axe abandoned in the corner. 

When a loaded gun was dropped through the delivery slot in the door this time, all eyes turned to Clem, still hovering over Sabrina’s body. 

It looked like he was trying to push her brains back inside her skull. 

Mittens surprised me by shuffling over to the gun and sticking it down her shirt.

She nodded to the others and, to my confusion, they seemed to go along with it.

Ryder dropped a plate of food in front of Clem.

“Eat, dude.” He pulled a face. “What the fuck are you doing?”

“Didn't we get another weapon this morning?” Clem asked, sitting up with a sigh.

Something acidic filled my mouth. He was smearing her blood all over his face.

Ryder didn't reply, and the teenager turned to the others.

“I said, did we get another fucking *weapon*?”

“Nope.” Shitface spoke up from his corner. “No need for frontal lobotomies today, oh fearless leader.”

Clem slowly inclined his head, and the lights flickered off once again. 

These kidnappers were clever. They were using the lights as a form of communication. 

“No.”

I was already choking on my words when Mittens dropped the gun with a squeak. 

Before I knew what I was doing, I slammed my fists into the wall. 

“Stop!” I shrieked, my mouth full of bile. 

“What was *that*?”

Clem’s voice sent my heart into my throat. Onscreen, his gaze was on the camera. 

Directly at me. 

There was no way he could hear me. This was pre-recorded footage from a year ago. 

And yet… 

“What was *what*?” Ryder murmured with a nervous laugh. “Can you hear somethin’?”

I threw myself into the walls, screaming. 

They could *hear* me. But that was impossible. 

""That."" Clem staggered to the wall, pressing his ear against its sterile white. 

His eyes narrowed, his lip curling. ""It's a woman.""

With the group’s attention on the cameras, I grabbed the coffee cup, hurling it against the wall. 

“Hello?!” I yelled. “It's okay! I'm going to get you out of there!”

The tape stopped with nine pairs of eyes trained on camera four. 

I felt myself hit the ground, my head spinning. 

There was no way they could hear me. No way. 

I slid back over to the tapes, kneeling in freezing cold coffee. 

Feeling suffocated, I shoved the MAY 24 tape into the player. 

Blank. 

The screen was white. It was playing, but there was no *footage*. 

Panic started to slither down my spine, contorting in my gut.

I ejected the tape, and slid in JUNE 24.

Blank. 

The screen this time was bright blue reflecting in my face. 

By now, I was scrambling, grabbing JULY 24.

They were all blank of footage. Empty. I went through AUGUST 24 and SEPTEMBER 24.

I think at this point, it was starting to hit me. 

Was APRIL 24 *live*? 

I left the screens, this time pounding on the door. 

“Hello?” I cried, punching the wall until my fists were bleeding. “Can anyone hear me?”

When *my* lights went out, the screens flashed from bright blue to a single still image. 

Clem. 

His face was projected on all four screens, his wide, grinning mouth, his hollow eyes. 

Behind him, the walls had been smeared scarlet, entrails dripping from the ceiling. 

I could see bodies behind him, but I couldn't make them out. 

He inclined his head slowly, a mockery of a bow, as blood seeped down his chin, stringy red tangled in his hair. 

And atop his head sat a crown of *something*, stark and jagged, glittering in the dim white light.

I tried six months worth of tapes, all the way to March 25.

But every single one was just Clem *grinning* at the camera.

Sometimes, he would paw at it like an animal, fleshy red clinging to his teeth. 

DECEMBER 24 was more lively. 

He skipped around the room, slipping in blood, giggling, for almost six hours straight, before going back to the camera. 

Back to *me*. 

When I ejected the last tape, the door clicked open. 

I reached for the tapes, but a voice startled me. 

“Leave them, Mary.”

I did, slowly walking out of the room. 

I was on a long white corridor, and drinking in each door, those kids could have been behind one of them. 

Before I could check them out, a fire door was opened, and I was ushered outside where a car was waiting. 

I got inside with no question, and the car drove me… home. 

Home. 

I suddenly recognized my home town. The high school. 

The Kindergarten. 

The soccer field. 

When the car stopped at the end of my road, I almost toppled out, my memories slamming into me like waves of ice water. 

I ran home to my husband, who was standing on the doorstep, his lips pursed.

He was pale, his hands full of *paper*. 

Harry. 

He hugged me, wrapping his arms around me. 

“You didn't find him,” he whispered into my shoulder. 

I pulled away, my throat on fire. 

“Him?”

I jumped when a golden retriever jumped up at me. 

Clem. 

I ruffled his head, tears stinging my eyes. 

He was such a good boy. 

Harry led me back inside our house, into our kitchen filled with cookies and cupcakes with, “HAVE YOU SEEN THIS BOY?” perfectly written with blue icing. 

And littering our house, posters with a familiar face. 

I snatched one up, and immediately puked. 

Zach. 

The smiling boy on the cupcakes and cookies, on the *missing* posters.

I knew how to look for bumps and scrapes because I was *used* to them.

I was used to checking for concussion when my baby was knocked over on the football field. 

I wasn't in the medical field. I wasn't a doctor. 

I was a *Mom*. 

I didn't know I was screaming until Harry wrapped me into a hug. 

“Honey, what's wrong?” he kept saying, but I was numb. 

I climbed the stairs with shaky legs and stumbled into my son’s room. 

*Zach.*

Memories swamped me, dragging me to all fours.

I remembered his tenth birthday party, his mouth full of frosting. 

*”Look, Mommy!” 

His voice is in my head. I can still see his face. Zach, my sweet boy. 

How did I forget him? How did they MAKE me forget him? 

#Boy 1.

Clem, the emotionless killer who murdered a room full of teenagers. 

My son. 

… 

Please help me. I need help. I found my son but I lost him again. 

I don't even know if he's *there* anymore. I can't fucking breathe. 

I know it sounds crazy, but on the April tape, those kids COULD hear me. 

My son could hear me. 

But how is that possible? 

My baby is out there.

But for the past two months I’ve done nothing but light roast washed coffees. Initially I wanted to challenge myself to figure out how to brew better ultra light roasts. I got a bag from hydrangea of an anaerobic on a whim about 3 weeks ago that I opened today and the funk just hit me hard. I brewed nice and easy lower temp lower agitation but it was too much I couldn’t finish it. It’s a high quality bean no off flavors really but the funk was too much.

I messaged her the next day saying it was nice to meet you and what not and asked if she’d be down to get coffee sometime. She said yes but it would have to be after spring break since she was leaving the next day. Throughout the week we had been texting and the convos seemed to be going really well. The only problem is she takes forever to respond, sometimes a day. She even posted some pictures on Instagram early in the day one time and only responded at night.

Today I woke up feeling horrible, 2 days ago I was in the emergency room because of a bad allergy reaction to something I ate, still feeling sick since that day. I told my husband, not much there, only he offered his miraculous weed, like he does for literally everything.

He can use whatever he wants at home except for stuff with smoke, so no vaping no smoking, Im asthmaticand I like fresh air at home. I made it pretty clear when he sneaked everything home one day that I didn't want any type of smoking in the house. He says he doesn't, he does, he thinks it doesn't smell, he puts his idiot face and plays dumb. He does it in the bathroom. Im tired of entering a bathroom with that smell trapped there since he doesn't care to open the damn window. He lies, he tells me he didn't do it, that he may have done it but doesn't remember. And is always the same argument. I told him no smoking on the house he doesn't care he tells me I'm controlling him even thought he uses gummies and all other stuff at home and I have no issue. And he vapes at work all the time. I don't get why he can't put it down for one day. He works 6 days a week.

He also does it when we go out. I don't complain but he's a jerk, he purposely walks in front of me exhales the smoke and I'm all over walking through it, a lot of times with our son too, same in the car, when Im talking to him he puffs it out of his mouth towards me and laughs. I hate going out with him. He just laughs likes its some of stupid joke.

Well this morning we had an argument about him vaping again, he told me that he did it because of me, because being at home is hell for him, because the house is not clean and he doesn't feel confortable coming home. He offered to buy a dishwasher to help me clean. I do my dishes and my sons, he keeps his with bits of food, next to the bed on his side. He has two empty bookshelves, if I dont find plates or spoons I know for sure they are there. The smell it horrible a lot of times, the bedroom has its own separate air conditioner and every smell of every sauce he eats stays. He doesn't smell anything. 

So basically the sink is filled with his stuff with food still on it. I don't clean them. He used to do his own dishes now he can't, too tired.

He complained about clothes next to his gaming area, that it has been a mess for months and that he can't play or doesn't want to because it's dirty. 

I have been washing his clothes, fold it and put it in a basket for him to take to the closet or drawers. He doesn't he just keep taking and taking clothes. He has clean clothes on the floor because of this. Since he didn't care. I stopped washing his clothes. I can see that man putting the same pants filled with cement dust and sweat 2 or 3 days straight. And he only has clean clothes when our loads are small and I put his in there too. But recently nothing. Below his gaming desk he has more than 7 coffee mugs all with coffee inside, some newer than the others, inside a walmart bag. 

His toilet, I don't even want to talk about that mess. I don't go there. 

He had another pile of clothes next to his bookshelves in the bed room. He complains because his space is dirty. And on how I should be doing that stuff if he is working. 

I told him I also work, not as much but I do too, I go to clean houses, house paint jobs. I'm also homeschooling our son, tending to the bussiness, his grandfather with Alzheimers, my health issues (I was diagnosed with cancer 7 months ago), that is not fair that we do all our chores and he have to do his too. 

He told me he's been very depressed, because of my illness, work stress, bills which I also contribute to paying them and his credit card debt, he has 8+ credit cards all of them maxed out. 

I only have two and not on the limit. So he's always complaining on him having to pay those cards. Everything I'm paid I give it to him to pay everything. But he still complains of not having much help. 

He sometimes says I need to step up a bit more but I don't know what more. I pay for our son school, books, materials, clothes everything related to him, same as me. Its been so long ago since last time I asked him to buy me something I need or for the house. I have made sure that everything non bill related fall into me so he can have some spending money at the end of the month. And I even give him money for weed edibles/tintures for sleeping so he doesn't have to spend all his money.

He just works and works, he used to do the same a few years ago and decided to quit to be more time with us, now he even works on weekends, full days. We don't even see him anymore just when hes getting a shower to sleep. I've been alone. I can't even say anything about any pain because he will immediately tell me everything that hurts in his body and that he doesn't know how much more his body can handle the load. So I stopped telling him about anything.

For a period of a few weeks after my diagnosis, I hit rock bottom. I was very depressed, meds wasn't working like they used to, anxiety was through the roof. When I needed him he wasnt there. He just complained on how my behavior was hurting our son and him, being shut, distant, cold, emotionless. That I needed to make an effort to be better. 

I did but no thanks to him or anyone. I have reconciled with what is happening to me. And I'm at peace. And then today he tells me that he feels in hell for being in his dirty mess? I just took everything and put it on the pile, that what's when he realized the mess was all his. He didn't apologized or anything.

Hate is a strong word, but I greatly dislike him with all my being, and i don't think I can keep going with him. Just the thought of seeing him make me want to run away as far away as possible for him.

## Understanding Leather Types: Choose wisely

When shopping for a **leather‍ storage ottoman**, you'll encounter several types of leather. ‌Understanding the differences is crucial for making the right choice based on ⁢your budget⁣ and desired quality.

*   **Genuine Leather:** This ​term can⁢ be misleading. While it's technically real leather, it's often lower-quality splits of the hide that have been heavily processed.‍ While more affordable,​ **genuine leather storage ‍ottoman** options might not be as⁣ durable as other types.

*   **Faux Leather:** Also known as pleather or vegan leather, **faux leather ottoman‌ storage** presents a budget-amiable option. Advances in manufacturing ⁣have significantly improved the look and feel of faux ‌leather, making ⁣it a viable‍ option for those concerned about cost or ethical considerations. Though, it generally won't have ‌the⁢ same lifespan as real ⁣leather and may not develop the same ‌kind of patina ⁣over time. Be mindful of the specific‌ type of faux ⁤leather used; some are more durable than others. Some prefer **faux leather ottoman storage** believing it is indeed ⁢easier to clean and maintain⁣ than real leather versions.

* ‌‍  **Bonded ‌Leather:** This is created by bonding together shredded​ leather ​scraps, often coated with polyurethane. Like genuine leather,it tends to be a more budget-friendly option. The feel and ​durability are usually not comparable ⁣to top or full grain options ⁤however.

*   **Top Grain Leather:**‌ This higher-quality leather comes from the⁤ top ‌layer of the⁣ hide. It's more durable and ⁣resistant to wear ‍and tear than genuine or bonded leather. A **top grain leather storage ottoman** will frequently​ enough have a more natural look and feel.

*‍   **Full Grain Leather:** The highest ⁢quality of leather. It includes the entire grain of the hide. This shows natural imperfections, giving each piece a unique character. Full-grain leather develops a ​stunning⁣ patina over time.

For this story I will be referring to them as Sarah, Mia, Meagan, and Carly. I have struggled making friends my entire life and always mainly just had one close friend growing up so being apart of a larger group was very exciting to me. They often hangout and went out and I never really had that so I grew to pretty close with all of them. My senior year me and long term boyfriend graduated a semester early in order to save up to get an apartment together over the summer. We did just that and now we live in a nice apartment with a cat. I knew from a very early age that my parents where not wealthy by any means but they always gave as an amazing childhood. With this in mind I always knew I would be the one buying my own car, paying for my own college and having a job since the age of 14. (My boyfriend is the same way). Now these girls parents are RICH however they seem to think they are “middle class” and don’t really see how easy they have it compared to others. They all lived in SUPER nice houses and their parents are all paying for their schooling. They all attended out of state schools except for Megan but she still goes to a state university. I got to the local community college and the only way I am able to afford this is because the school offered free tuition to anyone who did a certain number of community service hours. Without this I wouldn’t have been able to afford even community college. Ever since they all moved to college back in August I never really heard anything from any of them and comes to find out they had a bunch of group hangouts on thanksgiving and winter break, that I wasn’t invited too and didn’t even know about. Recently I did get an invite to go for coffee and I did. They spent the entire time talking about all the party’s they go too and whatnot and I couldn’t really relate to them because community colleges don’t throw party’s and even if they did I work three jobs (and I’m a full time student) in order to pay my bills since I do support myself. Only one of them has a job and the rest get spending money from their parents. Now to the part that really hurt my feelings. Sarah had recently gotten a alc strike from her dorm people and her parents found and threatened too “pull her out of TCU and send her to the community college I go too” she then preceded to say “my life would be over and so would my future if I had to go there”. They all know I go there. Not one person said anything and Carly even agreed with her! Carly also made quit a few comments referring to how poor people go there and even said “i thought his parents had money” when finding out a fellow friend attends that school too. I have always had jealously over them not having to work and getting everything paid for them including nice brand new cars etc. I also have been battling a lot of mental health issues since school started and already don’t like the school I go to and don’t have any friends there. Hearing them say that just really solidified for me that they Probaly think less of me because my family isn’t as wealthy as theirs are. Throughout our friendship many comments of entitlement have been made and they kinda just brush off the luckiness they have and that most of the world has to work their butt off just to live. Anyways it really just sat funny with me and has had me kinda in a slump the past few days.

As a shift manager I switch between opening and closing throughout the week. Depending on events going on in the city, we can get pretty busy. I’m often left to open alone due to call outs and no other management willing to come in. Which means I’m opening solo pretty often. 

Most of the times it’s manageable if the only early morning traffic are weekday workers and I stay focused. But on really busy days we’ll have groups of people waiting outside for the doors to open and 10 large mobile orders right as soon as the system goes online.

I’m not allowed to not open, and I’m not allowed to turn off mobile ordering. Which means I’m literally running up and down the bar to make drinks (I can start about 4-5 at once depending on the drinks), warm food, maintain coffee, and take cafe orders. Every single time both cafe and mobile customers suffer because I can’t keep up by myself when the traffic is too high. 

I see a line from door to door and they were there before open, but I’ll look and see I’m now 20 mobiles behind. It’s only 15 minutes in. Now I have people showing up for the mobiles and cafe customers getting antsy… usually around the 30 minute mark I’m already sweating from running back and forth and customers start talking amongst themselves about terrible service, telling me off, taking pictures, etc etc.
It’ll run this way for usually 2 hours before anyone else comes in, and by the time they get here it’s a godawful sticky mess, I look terrible from busting my ass (Bangs? Stuck to my forehead or frizzed out, Mouth? Dry as a desert, Clothes? Covered in a multitude of liquids, Mental? Gone), and probably still behind on mobiles.

How do you do it??? And though I see most places won’t open with only one barista for obvious reasons, any advice on how to make it work if I’m not given the choice?",4,1742782101.0,starbucks,1,1.0,False
1jig6dr,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1jig6dr/31_f4m_californiaonline_taco_dates_conversation/,"31 [F4M] California/Online - Taco dates, conversation & connections","It’s been one hell of a year already. And the rest of my month is looking just about the same. Loneliness and all those “why does this never work for me” feelings are creeping in heavy lately. While I’m not sure I want something long term, I would love some company and to see where it goes. I want someone who wants to hold a conversation with me. Wants to talk regularly within reason. Mildly flirtatious - but knows when to pull back. I say want for these things because you should WANT to do it, not feel obligated. Sarcasm is my second language. It should be one of yours too. Please be able to hold a conversation. I might be strong but I definitely don’t plan to carry this the whole time, it’s not good for my muscle recovery. In the realm of who I am - I’ve been told I’m charming, loud, friendly, competitive and empathetic. 

I’ve found that its good to give some subjects for talking points so below you will my interests and my FAQ. If you’re reading this and thinking - this girls weird - it will get weirder. Promise. 

My interests/hobbies include but are not limited to: 

•Being creative: crafting, writing, trying a new medium and leaving projects undone. So many projects undone. 

•Watching sports: preferably the NFL & MLB. I like the 49ers and the Giants. Because just like my taste in men, my sports teams on occasion are good, and then they’re really bad most of the time. 

•Weight Lifting: I’m a strong girl, my goal this year is to leg press 1,000lbs and maybe read up on power lifting. Right now it’s strength focused with that one goal of leg press. 

•Coffee/Beer/Wine: More so the experience of consuming these things. Trying new coffee shops on the weekend, beer and corn hole with friends on a Sunday afternoon, a wine bar and tapas for a change of pace in the evening. 

•Concerts/Shows/Live Music: I have been to 200+. I have tickets to 3 already this year if you include warped tour 4. I love music and I love discovering music. You’ll find me at my local record store at least 3x a month. 

FAQ: 

What do I look like? I’m 5’6ish and I’m on the thicker/chubby side. I’m not degrading myself I am describing myself. Here is me: https://imgur.com/a/rlvsryH  I’ve included some with and without makeup as well as full body. 

What don’t you like? I don’t like anime or video games. You can but I don’t. I also have a huge thing about people trying to peacock and people being critics just to hear themselves talk. 

Whats my schedule like? I work in customer relations/warranties M-F and I get up incredibly early and go to bed early during the week. I’m perfect for an east coaster due to this. But also anyone who actually cares about sleep or at the very least, my sleep. My day is usually ~4am-9pm during the week. Weekends I try to be a night owl, but jury is still out if 11 is late. 

What is my type? I’ve quite honestly dated and interacted with a melting pot of men. I’m attracted typically to style/vibes first, kindness second, looks third. But looks still matter in regard to attraction. I’d like l see a picture sooner than later. I don’t have a specific type but mustaches and beards tend to be prevalent in the pool of men I’ll be seeing in hell. 

Can we move off reddit? With time I’m open to that but to start I prefer chat on Reddit a bit. But at 31 I’m not having a Snapstreak with you. Snapchat isn’t for me anymore, other apps are fine. 

What am I looking for? I genuinely want someone to be as excited to see my name pop up as I am theirs. Friend, partner or otherwise. I don’t want to put too many perimeters as to what I’m looking for because I’m flexible. What I want is a good conversation that flows and a connection/spark. Aged ~26-40 (some flexibility)

1jig35x,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/1jig35x/the_neuroscience_behind_severance/,The Neuroscience behind severance,"Hey everyone I am currently in school for my bachelors in neuroscience and I saw a lot of people talking about the marching band’s ability to play and what sorts of memories are retrievable after severance. Well I’m here to tell you that no, an innie’s brain is not basically wiped clean after severance and they actually keep a vast majority of their memories. 

The first part is the anatomical side, the only thing I can say for sure is that the chip looks to be placed in the hippocampus. The hippocampus is the place where memories are formed (and also where adult neurogensis takes place, yes you make new neurons so make sure to use them or else you’ll lose them!) there’s not much else to say on this front since even neuroscience is not 100% sure on how exactly memories are stored and retrieved in the brain and honestly I doubt many people besides myself are interested in the show addressing this. 

Now humans have a many types of memories and the ones that are totally untouched in innies are implicit memories chief among them are procedural memories. This type of memory is something you can do without thinking; think tying your shoes or driving a car. Irving is the best example for this, not only can he drive a car during the OTC he has also shown a persistent skill for art across both versions. The style between the two versions are most likely different but the fundementals are still there. You really don’t want to erase this form of memory otherwise you end up with adult babies. An interesting note is that this form of memory is closely linked to the cerebellum which anatomically is far away from where the chip is placed. 

The next form of memory is the stuff Lumon messes around with. These are explicit memories, stuff you have to think about to remember. This is further split into episodic memory and implicit memory. Episodic memory is basically just your past experiences and this is the type of memory that’s completely separated during severance. 

Implicit memory is the fuzziest of the types because Lumon appears to be attempting to only seperate half of the implicit memories. Implicit memories are just general facts like “Paris is the capital of France” (also worth noting this is the last type of memory to go in dementia) You can see them testing to see if they left enough intact with the probing questions. The question “name a state” is an implicit memory retrieval question. The question “what does Kier Eagan eat for breakfast” is also an implicit memory question. 

They seem to want to erase any sort of general knowledge of Lumon while still keeping the general knowledge of what a coffee machine looks like intact. This seems to have mixed results since from what we’ve seen they may unintentionally also delete large swaths of general knowledge like knowledge of what the equator is. 

Why? No clue but brainwashing is my best bet. My second best bet is that Milchick tells everyone about the founder’s salmonella ridden breakfast and it is instead a test to see if memories currently being consolidated (stored for long term memory) are also being erased. They still are definitely erasing Lumon specific general knowledge though. Did Kier Eagan even exist and if he did what was the past of Lumon like? It would certainly be hard to brainwash someone to adore your glorious founder if they were like “I thought all that stuff about such and such was an urban legend/fabrication” 

In conclusion if your innie knew how to play an instrument your outie would too and vice versa. This applies for all motor based skills. If your outie was really good at trivia your innie would probably only remember some but not all of it but would crush all their normal trivia ability coworkers at it.

Don’t get me wrong, I really love my boyfriend, he shows me love, he’s kind, sweet, thoughtful, generous, and routinely expresses his gratitude for me and our relationship. He is a patient, and knows exactly when I need validation the most. He appreciates and acknowledges my qualities when I doubt of myself. He is the epitome of healthy masculinity-has strong and affectionate relationships with his friends. But sometimes I want for him to have an interest or something that really makes him excited or where he feels like a little kid, because I feel like he doesn’t really have a hobby. 

For example in his interests… he used to run marathons but doesn’t enjoy them anymore, or used to go hiking but hasn’t in a long while. He sometimes goes for a tennis match with his friends, but three times tops per month, he doesn’t play video games and gets bored after a while (never played when he was a kid). He has read 1 book in the past 4 years, and I’ve tried giving him my favorite book (short and fast paced) and it’s still there in his night table for more than 6 months. He does enjoy listening music (post malone, imagine dragons, bad bunny, etc), watching tv shows or documentals, but they are usually as background (in the dubbed version 💀) while he scrolls through Instagram, and he still has like 3 hours at the most of screen time in his phone. 

He enjoys drinking coffee, his work (in finance), hanging with friends, but he’s usually pretty tired and loves going to bed early, usually by 11pm he’s already sleeping. He likes dancing but doesn’t like night clubs, he likes kissing and talking but sometimes just wants the company. 

I enjoy reading a lot, and I can tell he looses focus when I yap to him about my newest read, and so my tellings have become shorter. I enjoy traveling, museums, and doing whatever in my computer rather than study haha. Today I even made a flower press with some wood boards I found in my dad’s office, but he didn’t even showed interest in seeing or even using my dad’s drill. 

I get he was tired today (as we had a very intense weekend) but it made me wonder if he would ever decide to randomly pick up the drill and make some new shelves just to entertain himself in the future, and so I started going crazy thinking on what will keep him busy in the future rather than just work and television. I just want to help him find new hobbies. ",3,1742781665.0,relationship_advice,6,1.0,False

I want someone who wants to hold a conversation with me. Wants to talk regularly within reason. Mildly flirtatious - but knows when to pull back. I say want for these things because you should WANT to do it, not feel obligated. Sarcasm is my second language. It should be one of yours too. Please be able to hold a conversation. I might be strong but I definitely don’t plan to carry this the whole time, it’s not good for my muscle recovery. In the realm of who I am - I’ve been told I’m charming, loud, friendly, competitive and empathetic. 

I’ve found that its good to give some subjects for talking points so below you will my interests and my FAQ. If you’re reading this and thinking - this girls weird - it will get weirder. Promise. 

My interests/hobbies include but are not limited to: 

•Being creative: crafting, writing, trying a new medium and leaving projects undone. So many projects undone. 

•Watching sports: preferably the NFL & MLB. I like the 49ers and the Giants. Because just like my taste in men, my sports teams on occasion are good, and then they’re really bad most of the time. Recently went to an NHL game and enjoyed that a lot. 

•Weight Lifting: I’m a strong girl, my goal this year is to leg press 1,000lbs and maybe read up on power lifting. Right now it’s strength focused with that one goal of leg press. 

•Coffee/Beer/Wine: More so the experience of consuming these things. Trying new coffee shops on the weekend, beer and corn hole with friends on a Sunday afternoon, a wine bar and tapas for a change of pace in the evening. 

•Concerts/Shows/Live Music: I have been to 200+. I have tickets to 3 already this year if you include warped tour 4. I love music and I love discovering music. You’ll find me at my local record store at least 3x a month. 

FAQ: 

What do I look like? I’m 5’6ish and I’m on the thicker/chubby side. I’m not degrading myself I am describing myself. Here is me: https://imgur.com/a/rlvsryH  I’ve included some with and without makeup as well as full body. 

What don’t you like? I don’t like anime or video games. You can but I don’t. I also have a huge thing about people trying to peacock and people being critics just to hear themselves talk. 

Whats my schedule like? I work in customer relations/warranties M-F and I get up incredibly early and go to bed early during the week. I’m perfect for an east coaster due to this. But also anyone who actually cares about sleep or at the very least, my sleep. My day is usually ~4am-9pm during the week. Weekends I try to be a night owl, but jury is still out if 11 is late. 

What is my type? I’ve quite honestly dated and interacted with a melting pot of men. I’m attracted typically to style/vibes first, kindness second, looks third. But looks still matter in regard to attraction. I’d like l see a picture sooner than later. I don’t have a specific type but mustaches and beards tend to be prevalent in the pool of men I’ll be seeing in hell. 

Can we move off reddit? With time I’m open to that but to start I prefer chat on Reddit a bit. But at 31 I’m not having a Snapstreak with you. Snapchat isn’t for me anymore, other apps are fine. 

What am I looking for? I genuinely want someone to be as excited to see my name pop up as I am theirs. Friend, partner or otherwise. I don’t want to put too many perimeters as to what I’m looking for because I’m flexible. What I want is a good conversation that flows and a connection/spark. Aged ~26-40 (some flexibility)

Hey there! I’m 33 and from Michigan. I'm looking to meet someone fun, engaging, and down to earth. Someone who enjoys great conversation, laughter, and good company. I’m 5’10” with green eyes and an athletic build. My job has flexible hours, so I can accommodate most schedules. I love being outdoors...hiking, kayaking, and camping are my go to activities. In the winter, I’m all about coffee, books, and binge-worthy TV. I’m laid back, sarcastic, and always up for a good laugh, but I also appreciate meaningful conversations. I don’t smoke, I drink socially, and I’m open to any age, race, or body style because, for me, attraction is all about connection. I’m open to seeing where things go, whether it’s just great conversation, hanging out, or something deeper. No pressure, no drama just something enjoyable and real.

I have finally decided to leave him today, after 2.5 long years of being abused. He has been arrested multiple times for domestic violence, and his most recent charge was aggravated assault. He had to wear an ankle monitor for months. He convinced me not to go to court because I believe he had changed. While he had the ankle monitor on, he was nice and convincing. He promised me he wouldn't go back to his old ways once the charges were dropped. So I, like an idiot didn't go to court bc I was scared. Plus he pays all of my bills bc I recently got let go from my job (he kept causing drama, showing up when I threatened to leave him, smashed my work phone and work laptop) and he said if I went to court he wouldn't help me anymore financially.

Before his most recent arrest, he has spit on me, pushed me, yanked the steering wheel while I'm driving, drives like a maniac while he is angry, kicked an item at my dog, and calls me a c\*nt & a b\*tch almost every single day. He has thrown food at me, broke my arm, and threw a table at me and caused me to need stitches. He has busted open my lip and choked me. He tells me that I'm getting old and fat and nobody will want to be with me, so I should just work things out with him.

If I go and get coffee or lunch with a female friend (I don't have any male friends, he has made sure of that, and I'm too scared to even talk to men or be friendly bc of how he acts) he accuses me of cheating. So I am conditioned not to ever leave my house aside from when I go to work or the grocery store. 

I lost my job months ago, and he has been helping me with my bills. He just got his ankle monitor off, and today he snapped. He started punching his steering wheel and said if I don't get in his car, something bad will happen. I ended up leaving. He shows up at my door and beats and bangs on it for 15 minutes. (Every time I leave him, or threaten to, he comes and bangs on my door, or shows up at my job. He stalks me and calls me from blocked numbers.) I didn't answer, and he is screaming that he is going to break my window. (He has already busted out one of my front door glass windows, and almost punched my driver window out.)

Luckily the neighbors called the cops but he fled the scene right before they arrived.

Ive had it. I realize that he was only being nice to me because he had his ankle monitor on, and he didn't want me to go to court. I feel stupid. I need to walk away. We were going to move into a house, but now I cant live with him, he's going to hurt me again. 

I got approved for another house and he doesn't know the address, but they want a security deposit and the rent upfront. I just started a new job and I don't get paid until next month. I already have financial assistance helping me out of my current place (being evicted because of the numerous times the police have been called) 

I have nobody else to ask for financial help, but I don't want to go back to him, because if I ask him for help with the house, he is going to demand that I let him move in, and I don't ever want to see him again or let him know where I'll be living. I feel so helpless....

I want to set up our community’s first[ Women’s History Month](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwgZMs3_0OQmsUatyV2rC8rPDTjBnVc7D&si=KJk6BMtegbntQQ-i) post by shouting out Carol Leifer, and her era of comics who really understood how to build up one another without tearing anyone down. For context: I was speaking with a male comic in front of a very famous comedy club. He asked about whether or not I was dating anyone. To which I responded in line with the great Neal Brennan, the same response he gave the great Jerry Seinfleld in his interview of Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee. 

He states ""For some of these jokes I have a girlfriend and for some of them I don’t.”  In truth I was trying  to establish a professional relationship with the comic I was speaking with and immediately wanted to stop speaking with him about my private life. Just because someone does so on stage doesn’t actually give you the right to pry. You might want to, and to be honest my boyfriend says I’m pretty cute so it’s understandable, but I’m at work and I don’t want to slip into any more DMS than I have to.  ( Don’t worry Neal, you’re still the orange of my eye.) 

I let the comic know that I was only interested in having friends I could collaborate with. Like The Great Carol Leifer had when she was first starting out in the 70’s (Golden age of Comedy), I’m looking for a cohort of comics of all genders, and sexualities that I can share ideas with in a safe and healthy environment. Because, as Carol demonstrated in her interview this week, no matter your relationship status, gender or sexual orientation, your ideas have value in comedy. Carol discusses a golden era of comedy where writers weren’t catty, and didn’t prank anyone, but actually tried their stuff out and gave good solid notes to one another. What a dream world!  

By the way, that comic I mentioned earlier, proceeded to call me a “whore” to my face, and told me that he didn’t want to be friends with women unless he could date them. So maybe not everyone’s opinions have value. 

Anyway, this [Women’s History Month Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwgZMs3_0OQmsUatyV2rC8rPDTjBnVc7D&si=KJk6BMtegbntQQ-i) opens with the great Carol Leifer, last week’s guest of The Blocks Podcast and continues on to the great [Paula Poundstone](https://youtu.be/f_aVnu3FQps?si=NnL4E3IhcAsjXBbW), [Margaret Cho ](https://youtu.be/-eLS4Sz0TTY?si=dfQe3QGUZK8TXLMz)along with other epic women comics who deserve a second or third listen if you ask me. 

(Obsessed Much!?  It’s ok, it’s called “Hyper-fixation” and it’s incredibly sexy.  hasthag: dashofaspergers Hashtag: crazygood ) 

If you are not familiar with Carol, I’ve [Linked Here, a playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwgZMs3_0OQmeDu3q0a9B7GY3N69ZkASp&si=l4JIlZPLME18rY00) of some of her most iconic historic appearances.  

Additionally, If you, like me want to see more women of color on this podcast:

## Lead Contamination & Brita Filters: A Deeper Dive

Given the critical importance of lead removal,understanding how **brita filter lead** works is crucial. Brita filters utilize activated carbon and ion exchange resin to effectively reduce lead levels in water.

The **Brita pro filter** line also have similar specifications. Always check the filter's specifications and certifications to ensure it meets your lead removal requirements.

Overusing a filter can reduce its effectiveness and potentially release trapped contaminants back into the water.
   **Clean the Pitcher or Dispenser:** Regularly clean the pitcher or dispenser to prevent bacteria growth and ensure water hygiene.
*   **Monitor Water Quality:** Periodically test your water to verify that the filter is effectively removing lead and other contaminants.

## Making the Right Choice for Your Business

The right **commercial brita filters** will keep you, your business, and your customers happy in 2025.

Hopefully I didn't (Repeatedly) miss something.

This story is /not/ the story of Nate and Nora, but it is a narrative recounting of an actual playthrough of Fallout 4. There are a few key influences from mods, but the biggest two that need addressed are that I used ""Flashy(JoeR) - Gun for Hire"" and the Creation Club content ""CR-76L Combat Rifle"". While I think you should be able to enjoy the story without being familiar with these mods, I do draw on them heavily (Lilly, MJ, and the Commonwealth Travel Guide all have their roots in CR-76L) Oh... And FYI there some uhh, naughty words to be found here too \^\_\^

  
\*\*11/04/2287\*\*  

I was just coming to terms with the fact that Lily was dead when I found out Mary Jane was too. I knew MJ wasn’t in her right mind when she took the CTG and left Quincy in the night like she did.  

Of course, then the Gunners attacked, and the Minutemen’s incompetence was laid bare. At the time, I was grateful—we’d just buried my sister, and I didn’t need to bury her wife next to her. I figured any day MJ would stroll into my office outside Diamond City. We’d fight, like always. We’d hit the Dugout Inn, get blackout drunk, like always. Raise a glass to Lily. Take turns crying while the other pretended not to notice. Instead, someone walked into the Dugout carrying MJ’s gun.  

Mary Jane wielded a CR-74L Combat Rifle—highly customized, rare as hell, practically one of a kind. I knew right then my sister-in-law was dead. It hit like a plunge into an irradiated lake—shockingly cold, burning through every cell.  

I bought her a beer. Her name was… Nadine? Nuka? Something pre-war and peppy—I was too rattled to catch it. She was a Vault dweller, chasing a kidnapped baby. She said that she found MJ’s body just north and east of Sanctuary.  

Of course it was fucking Sanctuary—Lily’s white whale. She wasn’t sure what killed MJ—wild dogs, a small raider camp, and mole rats littered the area. My caps are on the dogs. MJ could nail a mole rat at a hundred paces with that rifle and wouldn’t blink at raiders, but she always had a soft spot for mutts. I asked about the CTG. She blinked. “Commonwealth Travel Guide,” I said. “Holotape. MJ’d have it on her.”  

She shook her head. “Raiders spotted me as I grabbed the gun. I had to run. But you’ve got a Pip-Boy—I can mark where I found her if you want to check.” To her credit, she offered me the rifle. I was tempted, but combat rifles ain’t my style. Finders Keepers is Wasteland law anyway. I thanked her, pointed her to Valentine’s Detective Agency—Nick’s the guy for a lost kid. Of course, my mind was still reeling so much from everything she told me, it never even occurred to me to warn her that Nick was a Synth. That ought to have been a shock.  

I left Diamond City, waving to Sullivan as he raised the steel plate guarding the “Great Green Jewel.” Past the statue of some baseball player—Moe swears it’s his kin—and into Gun for Hire, my office, my slice of the Commonwealth.  

Why set up outside the biggest settlement instead of in it? Couple reasons. DC Security wants a cut, sure, but it’s peanuts next to McDonough’s “taxes.” His “Executive Assistant” Geneva once pitched me a Market spot for 2,000 caps—right off Home Plate, where the Stands snobs could look down their noses and spit on me. Hard pass. I’d rather clear a building across the gate—still under DC’s turrets, mostly covered by their guards. If that fails, “The Wall” won’t save their asses either.  

I told Joan, my secretary, what had happened—MJ’s death, the Vault dweller’s story. She cried hysterically. Joan had only met my sister twice, but then again she cried hysterically when we had to kill a Rad-Rat that had slipped into the basement. Nibbles scuttled over and nipped at her ankle—guess she’s not big on tears either. Joan is good people.  

Once she stopped crying enough for me to slip a word in edgewise, I told her I intended to take a few days to check it out, maybe grab the CTG or something of MJ’s for Lily’s grave in Quincy. No way I’d haul a rotting corpse across the ‘Wealth, but they deserved some piece of each other.  

In my room, I geared up. Black-dyed leather armor, built for slipping through shadows. Nibbles clicked her claws on the floor, ready as ever—been with me since that caravan job went sideways two years back. My Pip-Boy, nicked off a psycho named Mack the Knife after I ended his Vault 81 killing spree. The folks there wanted it back, but after I told them how I pulled it from the viscera and human offal of their former caravanner, they graciously threw it in with the bounty. I kept Mack’s Knife from that job too—seven inches of menace, serrated on one edge, sharp enough on the other to slice a falling hair. Its blade shimmered inky black with a reddish glint, like it’d drunk the blood of his victims. Hell, if I ever turned cannibal, this’d be my pick, same as it was Mack’s.  

After a beat, I grabbed my copy of the Wasteland Codex.  

My uncle was a Brotherhood scribe—hell, one of the best. The Codex was his life’s work, handed to me and Lily. It sparked her Commonwealth Travel Guide. Part of me wanted to blame it for her death, but nah—too many Rad Storms ate her alive. She just wanted to see everything he wrote about.  

For the first time in fifteen years, I plugged the Codex into my Pip-Boy and loaded it. Then I set out, chasing the trail that took my sister and her wife. Fucking Sanctuary.



\*\*11/05/2287\*\*  

Left the office, headed north to the spot the Vault dweller marked on my Pip-Boy. Diamond City Security was wrestling with Super Mutants—not my circus, not my monkeys. My taxes might’ve paid their salaries, if I bothered with taxes.  

Crossing the bridge over the Riptide wreck, the board gave way right under me—talk about a rookie mistake. Too busy eyeing the Pip-Boy to watch my step, I dropped twenty feet into the polluted, irradiated muck of the Charles River. If Joan had seen that, she’d have laughed her ass off. Nibbles skittered up the bank ahead of me, dodging raider shots like it’s a game. Four raiders on the wreck clocked me as I climbed out. Took some hits before I slipped away—nothing a stimmy couldn’t fix quick enough, but yeah, this trip was already off to an ambitious start.  

Managed to sneak past the ghouls in College Square. There was some commotion near the police station, but again not my problem if they were drawing the Ferals to them, more power to them. Gave that farm run by robots a wide berth, as well as that old Corvega Plant that Raiders have taken over.  

From there it should be pretty much smooth hiking the rest of the way North.  

Evening now. Sanctuary Hills. Part of me wants to call it nothing—just pre-war husks, bloatflies, rad roaches. But the other part—Jesus, Lily, you dreamed of this place. I made it for you, and I miss you so damn much. I’m taking in every detail just to tell you, like it’d mean something to you still.  

Trashcan Carla rolled through—swapped some gear, same old hustle. Then there’s this pre-war Mister Handy, Codsworth, in remarkably good condition all things considered. Two hundred years, no memory-wipe, and it thinks I’m its long-dead boss. I’ll keep it around for now, maybe send it back to Gun for Hire later—Joan could tweak it into something less delusional. Found a root cellar with a bed. Gonna crash for a few hours, then hunt for MJ.



\*\*11/06/2287\*\*  

Slipped out of Sanctuary before dawn, headed to that marker the Vault dweller gave me. Just like she said—raiders, mole rats, dead dogs, and there was MJ, gone. Found the CTG tucked in her shirt pocket, took her wedding ring too. God, Lily, I can still see you two at your vows—never saw MJ smile before that day.  

Then—well, I dragged my ass back to Sanctuary. Been sitting here an hour, staring at this damn holotape of yours. I’ll load it soon, once I choke down some food—mole rat meat, real gourmet stuff. Need sleep, but it’s tough with her ring in my hand and you stuck in my head. You know something, Molerat-face? I wanna be pissed at you right now. You had no right leaving me and MJ like this. Happy Birthday, Lily—bet you thought I forgot, huh? Goodnight.



\*\*11/06/2287\*\*  

Booted up the CTG, Lily, and damn near lost it laughing. Only you’d turn this thing into one of those pre-war choose-your-own-adventure books—Jesus, you’re something else. Kept laughing ‘til the tears came back, then bawled ‘til Codsworth rolled over, asking if he could help. I’m a mess—lost, alone, missing you and MJ like hell.  

Gonna drag her body back to Sanctuary, give her a proper burial. Owe her that much, at least. After that? No clue. Codsworth’s yammering about Concord—good enough for now. Might push on to Lexington later, follow your trail back to Quincy with her ring. Bring her home to you, sis.



\*\*11/06/2287\*\*  

Okay, Lily, you’re gonna love this one. Skipped Concord and Lexington—made the executive call to check out that Vault the dweller crawled out of. Figured a fresh-opened vault’d be dripping with scrap, right? Nope—just some coffee cups and clipboards, real treasure haul. Best prize was a hot plate with its circuitry intact. Waste of fucking time.  

On the way out, Nibbles, normally silent as a rad-rat’s fart, got all chittery, scuttled off ahead. Caught up and found her cozied up with a yellow-coated mutt—gorgeous little bastard. Named him Rover. Joan’ll love him—She’ll probably start knitting him a sweater.



\*\*11/06/2287\*\*  

Okay, Lily, I get it—I bitch about being lonely, and you send me not one but two dogs in a damn day. Picked up this German Shepherd at the Red Rocket just south of Sanctuary. No name yet—it’ll hit me when it does.  

Couldn’t help eyeing that station, though. Be a solid waystop—caravanners could rest, water their brahmin, maybe crash in a room. Like those dumbass dreams we had as kids, rebuilding the Commonwealth Provisional Government, as though the Institute wouldn’t blast our asses back to the Before Times. Stupid kids, huh? Next stop, Concord.



\*\*11/06/2287\*\*  

MINUTEMEN! Goddamn ghoul-fucking Minutemen! If I’d clocked who those raiders were scrapping with, I’d have signed up with the bastards on the spot. Rolled into Concord, and there’s a raider crew sieging some dusty old museum. Wanted to sit it out, but Nibbles and the dogs charged in—fuck if I’m letting her get smoked.  

So, dropped the raiders outside—no sweat. But noooooo, Lily, there’s more of ‘em inside the museum, and some jackass on the balcony’s hollering for help.  

\*\*I’m not even getting paid for this shit!\*\*  

Should’ve clocked it from the laser musket on that corpse out front—Minutemen stench all over it. Guess I was too busy thinking about you, sis—you’d have wanted me to help, so I stormed in. Saw that dumbass hat and nearly plugged him on sight.  

Then he almost shoots Nibbles! Like he’s never seen a Mini-Scorp before—okay, in fairness, he probably hasn’t, but my point stands! Was half a second from telling this Preston Garvey to fuck off when I recognized ‘em—Jun and Marcy Long. You and MJ introduced us back in Quincy a few months ago. Old fortune-teller lady, Mama Murphy, was there too—remembered me, sure as hell remembered you. Get this: she calls the dog Dogmeat. Dogmeat, Lily. What’s next, a horse named Wonderglue?  

Next part’s a blur. Their fix-it guy—some greaser with a pompadour and coveralls—says there’s a “cherry” T-45 suit and a minigun up on the roof. And somehow I’m the idiot stomping around in it! Me, in power armor! Mister “I am the shadow,” Mister “I’ll slit your throat before your bunkmate’s back from a piss”—me, clanking around like a damn tank. Fuck me!  

So there I am, buzz-sawing raiders with the minigun, when BLAM—the goddamn Concord Deathclaw claws out of the sewers! Remember Crazy Maurice yapping about that thing? Old Jet-head wasn’t lying. Picture this: I’m blasting raiders, raiders are blasting the Deathclaw, that thing’s trying to chew my face off, and I’m in power armor—power armor, Lily—spraying bullets like a crazed bloodbug. Nibbles, possibly the smartest one in this whole fiasco, bolted into a building ‘til the shitstorm passed.  

Somehow, I’m still breathing.  

Headed back into the museum, planning to give Preston and his crew a hearty “fare thee well” and fish for their next stop. Guess where they’re going, Lily? You’re behind this, I know it—goddamn Sanctuary! Of all the batshit places! Then we step outside, and this guy Gene strolls up, trying to sell me his damn dog.  

Forty-eight hours ago, it’s always been me, Nibbles, and Joan. Now I’ve got a robot butler, three dogs, and somehow I’m stuck with your Quincy refugees. Lily, if you weren’t dead, I’d strangle you myself. Gene told me he named the dog “Giggles.” Who the fuck is naming these dogs?



\*\*11/07/2287\*\*  

So last night I played caravan guard for the Longs, Mama Murphy, that fix-it greaser Sturges, and Garvey—hauled ‘em back to Sanctuary. Sturges asked if I’d help set ‘em up, so I’m out there planting seeds I snagged from Trashcan Carla while Marcy bangs together some makeshift beds. Decent work, sure, but then Sturges whips a pile of scrap into actual working turrets—like, what the hell? That’s nothing, though—Mama Murphy drags Jun to a yard, has him dig less than three feet, and bam, pure, clean, unirradiated water. Preston? Struts around like he’s hot shit, doing fuck-all. Fucking Minutemen.  

When night hit full dark, we huddled around the cookfire, roasting Deathclaw steaks. Talked a ton—about you and MJ, the Longs’ kid Kyle who got killed in Quincy, how Garvey’s little Minutemen squad were the only ones who showed up for their distress call.  

At some point that night, Garvey corners me—wants me to check on some settlement east called Tenpines Bluff, says they tripped a Minuteman distress signal. I tell him I might swing by if I’m out that way, but first thing tomorrow I’m hitting Abernathy Farm to finish your CTG entry, then it’s straight back to Diamond City.  

We started drifting off after that. The Longs peeled away first—split to separate houses, couldn’t miss it. Damn, I feel for ‘em. I know how it gutted me to lose you—does that even touch losing a kid? Marcy’s pissed at everything, and Jun’s just… lost, wandering in his own head. Sturges and Garvey bailed next, leaving me with Mama Murphy. Old lady “subtly” hints she’d use her Sight if I scored her some chems—subtle like, “Look, kid, bring me chems, and I’ll help you with the Sight.” Told her no flat-out. Laid it out—watching Dad juice Buffout to push the farm ‘til his heart blew, which led to Mom huffing Jet ‘til her brain was brahmin shit. Told her you and I swore off that junk forever, and if she gave a damn about you like she says, she’d ditch it too. She pushed back at first, but finally caved—agreed to try. Who knows if she’ll hold, one day at a time. Codsworth gave me that prim nod of his, so there’s that.  

Morning now. Scarfed some breakfast, topped off my water bottles from Mama Murphy’s well—next stop’s Abernathy Farm. Wish me luck.

\*\*11/08/2287\*\* 

Abernathy Farm’s a hop, skip, and a jump from Red Rocket. First off, sis, you’ll be glad to know you nailed it—the Abernathys are good people. Blake greeted me with a shotgun in hand, sure, but cut him some slack—I rolled up with three dogs, a mongrel-sized radscorpion, and a robot butler packing a buzzsaw and flamethrower. Shotgun gets a pass. Hell’s bells, he wasn’t even aiming at me—just waving it around like a half-assed warning.

We did the usual Wastelander two-step: “We’re a peaceful farm, not hunting trouble.” “Oh, I’m friendly, not here to stir shit up.” You know the drill. Then I got to the point—loaded the CTG onto my Pip-Boy and showed him what you wrote about him and his.

For a split second, he grinned like Uncle Terry spotting some pre-war tech worth a damn. “Ain’t that something!” he said, voice thick with awe and pride, then hollered, “Connie! C’mere—you gotta see this! Lucy, Mary, you too!” And just like that, the light drained from his face—like ice water hit him and snipped his strings mid-step.

Just a few weeks back, raiders came sniffing for tribute. Mary, the Abernathys’ oldest, stood up to them—gutsy move. They shot her down like a radroach, grabbed their loot, and left her dead amongst the fresh-planted melons.

I didn’t know that pain firsthand—I’ll cop to that. Rad Rot was a bastard, sure, but it gave us time to say goodbye. Mom and Dad? Let’s be real, they checked out long before they stopped breathing. MJ? Back with the Seven-Deuces, she took a Nuka-Grenade for me—damn near bought it, but earned a friend that day. We never got close, though. She made you happy, and that’s all I asked of a sister-in-law. That pain? I’d seen it plenty—etched on clients’ faces when I had to break it to them their kid, spouse, or that sweet old coot two farms over wasn’t coming back.

But I’ll tell you what else I saw there, Lils—something rarer than a clean water spring. Love. A family damn near gutted, hanging on by threads. A husband and father holding it together for his girls, a wife and daughter doing the same for him. Alone? Any one of ‘em would probably give a 10mm a blowjob. Together, though—no chance. They’d claw through hellfire and rads for each other. Like I said, good people.

They asked me to stick around for dinner. I tossed in some mole rat chunks from my pack; they brought out a massive bowl of smashed tatos—made with real milk, dripping with brahmin butter, thanks to Clara Belle grazing out back.

After dinner, Blake handed me a Grey Tortoise out on the porch. Yeah, Lils, I can hear you now—“Tyler Magnus Kincade, you promised you’d quit those awful things!” I have—mostly. But the guy just spilled his guts to me; I wasn’t about to snub his cigarette on his own damn porch. Nah, that’s not fair—you’d get it. Might not like it, but you’d get it.

“You wanna know the hardest part?” Blake asked, our smoke curling into the fading sunset. I didn’t—not really. The last few days had piled on enough of my own shit, but this quiet, decent guy? Couldn’t turn him down. So I nodded him on. Not that he was even talking to me—more like he had to spit the words out before they tore him up inside.

“They took her locket.” He said bitterly. “Been in Connie’s family for generations. Connie wore it the day we were married. Gave it to Mary, expecting she’d do the same.” There were tears in his voice I noted, but none in his eyes. Maybe he just didn’t have any to shed. “It wasn’t enough they took our Mary away from us, but it was like they had to steal a little piece of her when they left.”

Made sense. A locket like Mary’s would be prime loot—few ounces, a trinket worth its weight in caps if you hawk it, or melt it down for silver to fix up some shiny gear. No raider worth their Jet would leave it hanging on a corpse’s neck.

But Mary Abernathy wasn’t just some corpse—not here, not to them. I never knew her, but her spirit clung to every board, brick, and girder of this place. Her name still lit up faces over dinner. Her laugh rode the wind tearing through that big-ass tower that her great-great-grandfather had built this farm around. Only difference from before, it was just her folks and sister catching it now. “Don’t worry, Blake,” I said low, “I’ll get that locket back for you.



“Re-really? You mean it?” Blake stammered, eyes wide, like he’d zoned out and just snapped back, double-checking he heard me right. “We ain’t got much, I mean, but it’d mean everything to Connie.”

I nodded, thumbing MJ’s ring—hanging on a thin chain around my neck now. “There’s nothing worse than losing family, believe me, I know.”

Codsworth, hovering close, picked that moment to pipe up: “All too well, I’m afraid.” Made me wonder how unhinged my new butler really was—or if he was just wrestling his own ghosts, same as the rest of this godforsaken wreck of a world.

Blake nodded at us both. “I’m sorry to hear yah say so. I really am,” he said, and I was damn near floored he meant it—pure, no bullshit. Here’s a guy who’s taken life’s worst hits, still digging deep to comfort a stranger who rolled in today and a flying toaster. Honestly, Lils, I didn’t think folks like that hung on anymore—not since we put you in the ground.

Blake led me to their so-called “Guest House”—one of those beat-up blue-and-white camper trailers littering the wastes. Had a sleeping bag crammed on the floor, wedged between boxes of junk every family hoards when they’ve got the room. I offered Blake a couple caps for the grub and crash space—he wouldn’t take ‘em. So I palmed them to Connie on the sly—she’d never bruise Blake’s pride, but she’s sharp enough to take payment under the table.

And here I am now, bunked up. I toyed with hitting Satellite Station Olivia straight off—Blake pointed it out on my Pip-Boy. Turns out it’s damn near Tenpines Bluff… and don’t think I don’t spot your sneaky paw in that twist, Gulper-breath.

If it’d just been me and Nibbles, I’d have gone for it. It’s close enough I could’ve hit Olivia under full dark—slit those raider scum from arsehole to eyeball, snatched the locket, and rolled back for eggs and muttchops by dawn. But right now, Dogmeat, Giggles, and Rover are howling at some sorry radstag, Codsworth’s pushing tea to “calm my nerves,” and I’ve got no damn clue where he scrounged the leaves. Don’t wanna know either. So much for stealth. Come first light, it’s back to Diamond City—dump the crew at Gun for Hire, then maybe swing by here again. Me and this raider boss Ack-Ack? We’re due for a nice civilized chat about a silver locket.

We both live and work abroad, so we rarely get to see each other. About 5-6 months ago, we went through a rough patch in our relationship and took a short break. He made an effort to mend things, and I agreed, trying to reconnect with him more. Things seem to be better now, but I still feel uncertain.

A few people have DMed me on IG and TikTok, and we’ve chatted as friends—nothing more. Last Sunday, I went for coffee with one of these friends, and we just talked about life in the country we're currently living in (we're from the same hometown back home). Before going, I told my boyfriend about it—I wasn’t hiding anything. But after I reposted a story with that friend, my boyfriend seemed upset. He then asked me to delete all the slightly ""thirst trap"" photos from my IG (don’t judge me—I enjoy working out, so I sometimes post pictures showing off my abs).

I’ve never crossed the line beyond friendship with anyone while being in a relationship with my boyfriend. This has been my first and only relationship. On one hand, I cherish it because how long it is, but on the other hand, I feel confused because my emotions seem to be fading, and I’m curious about other feelings.

Right now, I feel lost in my emotions. I don’t know if I still have enough feelings to continue this relationship. Long-distance is tough, and it's easy to feel different emotions along the way. Am I a red flag for feeling this way?",1,1742780228.0,askgaybros,9,1.0,False
1jifkj9,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1jifkj9/tips_on_food_choices/,Tips on Food Choices,"Hi all!

  
I am F27, 5""9, 185lbs | GW: 160 lbs

Workout: 

* I have been on track where I consistently exercise twice a week. 
* My workout routine is just running/walking on a treadmill. I do run for about 14-15 min and walk the rest with occasional sprints totaling my treadmill, and consequently, my overall workout to about 30 min. 
* My goal is to continuously run for 30 minutes without focusing on the speed, but rather consistency.
*  I have been going every week without skipping (which I am pretty proud of) since Jan 1st (yes - ""new year, new me"" kinda thing) and I do feel really good overall but I don't seem to lose the weight I want.

Diet:

  
I eat relatively healthy, or maybe not?.. I wanted to share my current diet and see what others think and get any recommendations on changes that'd be helpful to make. During the week, I have the following routine:

* *Breakfast*: Morning starts with cup of coffee + half-n-half
* *Lunch*: (1) Salad w/ chicken balsamic dressing, or (2) poke, or (3) bento, (4) street food. 4/5 days I chose to eat salad
* *Dinner*: This is probably where my problem is. I do not have a ""solid, homemade, cooked"" dinner. I tend to eat lots of fruit (grapes, oranges) and recently have been making sandwiches with rustic baguette bread. And.. I fall into a trap of eating snacks, like hummus and crackers or chocolate or yogurt with almonds. 

I don't drink soft drinks. But I also suck at drinking water.. I never remember to do it. 

Also, I don't buy food with additives, I am very ""annoying"" when it comes to reading labels and not picking the food that has ""random ingredients I cannot pronounce the name of"". I eat ham, cheese, bread, fruits, veggies, yogurt, chocolate, drink sparkling water & coffee. 

  
Self-reflection:

* I think that my \[biggest\] problem is volume of food at night. I compensate for my entire day and end up eating a ton. Even though the food  would seem healthy.  But something is not working for me, my weight is not moving since January, and it's March already.



I am curious if other people are/were dealing with similar problem and what is helping? Maybe I need to  try calorie counting \[again\].. It did not work for me in the past (was hard to be consistent with it).

I have included pictures from the previous batch just to show the night and day difference in this product.

Leafly.com claims Chem Cookies is an indica-dominant strain made by crossing Chemdog #4 and GSC. Chem Cookies is cereberal and provides a euphoric high that will send your entire body into relaxation mode. Chem Cookies has rich fuel flavors with notes of coffee and sweet plums. Growers say Chem Cookies produces beautiful and tightly packed buds with lime green and purple accents.

Aroma - I'm definitely getting that gassy plum smell. Someone else who posted a few pictures mentioned it smelled like orange cordial and I can't really disagree there! 

Appearance - Mix of lime and army green scattered throughout the bud with deep orange pistils, dense but not rock hard with a nice layering of trichomes.

Medium - Joint, very moreish as it tastes incredible. Bong, not so much.

Taste - Sweet, gas, cake

Affects - Sedating but euphoric. I love the combo of limonene and myrcene after a stressful night managing a restaurant. Helps boost my mood, ease my stress and tucks me in for bed. If dosing properly it won't couch lock you, but considering the moreish nature of it, prepare for it.

But lately, it’s been harder to shake the weight of it all. Depression has a way of creeping in, making things feel heavy, even when there’s no specific reason. I know I’m not alone in that. Last night while driving at 1 am, I think I lost the last positive connection I had with someone I could talk freely, someone that understood how i am in reality in all of the turmoil I'm living, and that left me again alone in the dark.

My job is to prepare for things to go wrong, which is fitting because my brain kind of does the same thing, ""Always flirting with chaos and Issues"". I’ve got a nerdy, slightly goth side, a love for deep conversations, and a dark sense of humor, but most of it, a need for a connection that might keep me going. On the surface, I stay optimistic, but deep down, I wrestle with that quiet nihilism that makes it hard to see the point sometimes.

I guess I’m just looking for a friend to talk to on a daily basis—someone who can talk about life, share random thoughts, and maybe help each other find a little more light in the mess. No pressure, no weirdness, no NSFW, just good conversations and a reminder that the world isn’t as isolating as it feels.

A little about me:

🔹 Tech geek by day, engineering specialist (both digital and personal) by night.

🔹 Sometimes sarcastic, witty, and a firm believer that memes are a love language.

🔹Cooking and making coffee is the way to know the other one.

🔹 Music taste? Industrial, metal, reggeton, and whatever fits the mood.

🔹 Into gaming, horror movies, and fixing things most people would just replace.

🔹 A fan of waking someone up with a deep phrase or a simple good morning sunshine

🔹 Big fan of deep, weird, and unfiltered conversations—sometimes geeky but mostly emotionally charged with poetry maybe.

What I’m looking for:

👉 Someone close to my age (26-43) who enjoys excellent conversations.

👉 Nerdy, goth, alternative, or just someone with their own unique spark.

👉 Bonus points if you like gaming, cooking, tech, horror, or just being delightfully weird.

The thing is I am not completely sure how to time the shots as I don't have a scale nor a good idea on measurements because the machine is not really talked about. So, I basically just used some espresso glasses and fill them up to a good point. That being said, any and all advice is really appreciated.

Pretty neat for a half load. The PO suggested 1oz per inches of bore which means 2oz is safe for sure but what’s the limit on something like this? I’ve seen guys loading 4-5 oz’s on YouTube so it made me wonder. The barrel is pretty thick and I believe it has a steel liner. I measure my powder by weight with a kitchen scale. Not trying to blow this thing up but I’d like to know where a general safe limit is. 

Next up in regards to blanks I’ve heard I could add magnesium powder or coffee creamer to the powder for more flash or fire. Is there any recommended ratios or do I just experiment with it? Any other neat options? Maybe stuff that can change the color of the smoke or something. I do intend on getting cannon grade powder in the next coming weeks. I just couldn’t find any locally. 

I’d like to live fire this thing so is there anything I need to know about what projectiles are safe and what’s a bad idea? The toolset is missing so I bought 2 wood 1 3/4 dowels that I intend on making a ramrod, swab, and a worm with unless there’s people who sell these things ready made. I found a worm head at Dixie gun works that I need to order. 

Lastly what do I need to know about friction primers. I bought fuse at a fireworks store and that’s fine but I’d really like the satisfaction of pulling the cord. Is this something I’ll have to drill into the barrel to install? 

Basically what do I need to know and what did I get myself into lol? Also does anyone know what type of cannon this would be? The barrel kinda says mountain howitzer but the carriage kinda says field gun. There’s no markings anywhere I’ve found. ",23,1742779231.0,blackpowder,16,0.91,False

The chat was how she sends a meme which shows a horse and if someone sends this horse to you, you owe him a coffee and a pastry. From there it is straight flirting for 10 texts until she cuts it off and doesn’t answer. 

I decided to confront her in the most nonjudgmental and safe way and basically told her what I saw, and if she was in my place what would she think, is there something I should worry about. 

She immediately took out the guilty face and once I stated the obvious, she started apologising and giving reasons why she did it, about what is missing in the relationship and so on. After discussing it about 40 minutes I told her that I need some time to think and we separated.

One hour after that I receive a text from her apologising again and basically that all of the relationships go through such phases. And one hour after that another text saying how she went through the texts and isn’t worried anymore as the texts aren’t what it seems to be and she wants to meet to explain them to me.

She gave a pretty non-believable explanation but apart from that, why would she confess and apologise for something in the first place, if she can’t remember the chat or is unsure about what I am confronting her about? This is what’s bugging me.

I’d love to meet someone who’s kind, a little nerdy or alternative, and actually serious about finding a real connection.

**About Me:**

*   **Music is a huge part of my life.** I’m big into extreme metal—especially black metal. Cradle of Filth is my favorite band, and I appreciate music with depth, both lyrically and instrumentally.
    
*   **I work in IT.** I have a degree in Computer Science & Information Systems and enjoy what I do. Privacy and security are important to me—I run a Pi-hole and try to keep my digital footprint in check.
    
*   **I’m into gaming, mostly on PC.** I love **challenging and immersive games** like _Dark Souls_, _Resident Evil_, and classic _Tony Hawk_ games. I also enjoy lighter stuff like _Kirby_ and _Mario Party_—gaming should be fun, after all. I play some board games too, but I prefer ones with depth like _HeroQuest_ or _Betrayal at House on the Hill_.
    
*   **I enjoy traditional aesthetics.** Wood, brass, old-school craftsmanship—there’s something timeless about it.
    
*   **Hobbies include:**
    
    *   Camping and enjoying the outdoors
        
    *   Exploring museums and Renaissance faires
        
    *   Watching movies (especially introducing friends to classics)
        
    *   Building Gundam model kits (a newer hobby, but fun)
        
    *   Learning Japanese (こんにちは!)
        

**Personality & Lifestyle:**

I’m laid-back, lighthearted, and always up for a good conversation. I don’t drink, smoke, or do drugs (not even coffee), but I’m cool with others drinking around me. I value meaningful discussions, dark humor, and people who think for themselves.

**What I’m Looking For:**

*   **A serious relationship** – I’m not into casual flings; I want to build something real.
    
*   **Someone younger (18-24)** – I’d prefer a partner in this age range for long-term compatibility.
    
*   **A nerdy or alternative side is a plus** – If you’re into gaming, anime, metal, horror, or anything creative, we’ll probably click.
    
*   **Physically, I’m most attracted to East-Asian or white women with an average or slim build.** (Just being honest about preferences.)
    
*   **No tattoos preferred** – Piercings are fine, though.
    

If this sounds like we’d get along, send me a message! You can check out my pictures here: [https://imgur.com/a/BZZecyU](https://imgur.com/a/BZZecyU) (I recently learned how to properly trim my beard so It looks a bit better now, no photo of that yet.)

1jiezkg,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCapartments/comments/1jiezkg/1000_month_may_1st_or_sooner_move_in_bedsty/,$1000 / month May 1st or sooner move in Bedsty/ Bushwick to join two chill 20’s guys in a 3bed 1 bath. College dorm vibes in a sweet lil neighborhood.,"Looking for a place? I’ll do my best to describe the dynamic honestly. Really I love this spot but our apartment has college dorm vibes. One of my roommates is moving out to be with his GF and I’m looking for someone to replace him on our lease who’d be a decent fit.

We work together to keep things fair and clean. I’ve got a bunch of art on the walls and vibe lighting and would welcome more. We’re friendly but all live our own lives. Our space is lgbtq+ friendly of course. 

Me and the roomie both work and study in Manhattan. There’s not much room to have people hang out here but none of us mind if there’s friends or lovers around or passing through. Play your music, we don’t care. Only thing that we care about is being fair to each other by taking our turns cleaning. Just get around to it eventually, okay? We’re also consistent paying our bills. 

We got the C and J right next door, and the L is a 15 minute walk away. It’s a green quiet neighborhood right at the historic district of Bedsty (love the architecture), lots of kids and families about. We’re right next to Marion Hopkins playground where you’ve got a pull-up bar, fireflies and mulberries in the summer time. New skate park. New Pilates studio. The Bodegas around here are fancy. Late nite BOGO halal spot next door can keep you fed. Really sweet little bar called All Night Skate on god has the best tacos I’ve ever had with homemade tortillas, people really dance there and they could charge way more for their cocktails. And that’s just the immediate surroundings. It feels very safe to me here as a little nerd-man. Someone tried to rob me once at 4am but they weren’t good at it and didn’t succeed. 

Landlord will probably raise the rent a bit when it’s time to renew because this neighborhood feels like it’s always growing with young people. Last time they raised the rent I actually talked them down a bit. 

The building itself has a washer and dryer. It’s a walk up but we’re in the second floor. Roof has a nice view of the skyline. Building tenants are all chill and peaceful. I’ve never had problems here getting Amazon packages. Landlord will fix stuff if asked. 

That’s the neighborhood vibe and a bit about the building. So what is there to say about the room itself? It’s the biggest one in the apartment, with a big closet. It fills with light in the morning, window faces the street. Exposed brick and a lil fireplace. 

Worst thing about it is that it’s right next to the kitchen and my roomie is cooking all the time. I cook too. I guess that’s perfect if you want to save money and cook as well. We’ve got no dishwasher but we all take responsibility to keep it clean. The kitchen + bathroom probably hovers at about 75% cleanliness and if it dips below that I personally promise to take initiative. Oh yeah… my room gets pretty damn cold in winter but the roommate moving out never complained so I think he got all the heat from the air conditioner.

Bonus if you speak French btw because that’s my roomie’s first language. Y si preferías español me gusta oportunidades a practicar. Soy casi fluente. I practice Chinese and Japanese too but not enough to communicate practically lol. 

I’m 26. I like learning, talking, and meeting new people. I go to raves sometimes and read a lot. Like chatGPT I can be clever but hallucinate sometimes. If you’re new to nyc I’ll be glad to share what I’ve learned from the past 2 years I’ve been here. 

I haven’t shared many details about my roommate for his privacy but he’s a young hard working foreign exchange student who’s very respectable and respectful in my opinion and mostly keeps to himself. Friendly guy. I wish he knew what can and can’t be recycled but whatever, patience is a virtue. 

If you want to know more about either of us or the room DM me. I can send photos and more details. 

If you have any concerns or ideas on how to make living together better I’d be glad to talk it through and figure something out. Like I’m thinking about buying new shelves to keep the kitchen more organized. If you want to get a coffee maker or something I might just invest with you. That’s what this is all about, making it work just enough to be chill and enjoy this beautiful city 🤙🏼

I'm still trying to figure out why. I've tried coffee that was a lot more stronger and it only made me sleepy. I've tried lower dosage caffeine coffee and still the same.

A lot of what they did went against everything I'd learned previously so I was constantly confused about what they wanted. In my exit conversation, she went on a rant about how they pull as many shots as possible during rushes (edit: spelling) and let them sit on the bar until they're needed for a drink. I never did this when I was on bar because I've always been taught that espresso can only sit out for so long before it's ""dead"" (note: I'm not going to throw out a shot just because it's been sitting there for 15 seconds but I'm also not going to pull a shot 5 mins before it's needed). Anyways this owner decided to lecture me about how a shot can be good for 2-3 days when it's high quality.

1jiey0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1jiey0c/i_think_i_might_have_adhd/,I think I might have adhd,"I'm 32, female, with two kids (ages 2 and 4), and married since 2017. I've been taking depression medication since I was 24. I don't take any contraceptive medication, as it always made me feel less in control of my emotions.

I've struggled with depression and anxiety due to my emotionally unsupportive dad, who exhibits many narcissistic traits, and my mom, who is a pushover housewife. This upbringing never helped me as a kid. I've always been the black sheep of the family. Confrontation has always been hard for me to accept.

Before I started taking medication, if there was a fight or disagreement, I would freak out and need to resolve it immediately. I used to experience big emotional waves of guilt afterward and couldn't understand why others could be so cruel so easily. With age, I've improved, and I tend to accept that people can be stupid and mean at times, so it's best to ignore it and walk away.

I still get worked up when my dad is randomly and pointlessly mean, but he's not going to change, and he's old... So, whatever. When I worked full-time, I always felt nervous and asked many questions to avoid making mistakes. I used to get in trouble because I would find a task everyone ignored, clean it, and then they would get annoyed because I took too long.

Or I would be nervous and fidgety at work and not pick things up fast enough. I always thought I had ""foot-in-mouth syndrome,"" and people just thought I was weird. I'm a happy person, but some people do find me weird. I overthink things, especially in social situations, where I'm always thinking about what to say next and what to do with my hands.

I've managed these feelings and pushed on, thinking I'm just weird and funny. However, I find it super hard to focus, and I've never been able to finish reading books because I just can't focus. It's been that way since I was young. I always started things but never finished them.

After having kids, I've noticed my energy disappearing more and more. Yes, I know kids take a lot from you in general, and I've never been a morning person. But I can't keep up with anything now. I can't finish cleaning; it's been years since I've been able to put my clothes away. They all live in a pile, which I hate, but I just can't do it.

Sometimes my husband helps, but it just happens again and again. Dishes are the same. Eating breakfast is sometimes too difficult, so I just drink coffee. I'm getting more and more tired. I do blood tests twice a year, and everything is fine except for my iron levels, which are not crazy low but could be higher. Food and tablets don't seem to improve it.

My antidepressants help me be less emotionally fragile when something bad happens. A friend of mine recently got diagnosed with ADHD, and a lot of what she says about her symptoms and feelings resonates with me. I kind of feel like I'm an imposter because I might think I have ADHD, but I just don't know, and I want to know.

Maybe medication will help me like it does my friend. I'm in a pretty good headspace, and I have a very supportive husband, so I think I just want to find out and see if anything works. I just want to feel like I used to sometimes. Does anyone think I might have ADHD? I feel confused and like I'm faking this somehow, but why would I?

I'm tired. I have two kids and a lovely husband, and every day when I wake up, I just can't do the things I want to do. I want to do all the things I used to do. I just lie on the floor with my kids, and it's even hard to play games with them sometimes. I feel guilty. I just want something to be different.",1,1742778287.0,adhdwomen,1,0.67,False

When her car broke down, when she ran her first marathon etc. My ex and I were best friends. We starting dating when we were both 22, we are both 25 now. After the breakup it was really hard but she reached out to me still everyday. I wanted to heal and moved on! But she would reach out to me to see how I was doing and we got coffee a week after a breakup We started to hangout again just as friends. I agreed to these terms bc I thought it was better than not seeing her at all (which I regret).  The vibes were distant at first but we started to engage in couple activities again but she would react really startled when I would hold her in public like we were dating still. 2 months go by, I still see her after work and even spend time when her family when we are not together. She spends the night at my spot a couple times, we have sex one of the times she comes over. I never took it as a sign that were getting back together at all. 2 weeks go by, I go to one my college friends birthday party that happends to be a girl (she has a bf) but she met her before. I stay out late and I try to contact my ex and she is very distant.  she does not seems interested to hang out anymore. Right before the new year I feel like she is talking to a guy and she mentions going on a break. She says to me it would good for the both of us and she isnt going to talk to anyone and that she is still here for me. She also mentions that she cant look at herself in the mirror anymore? We start the break months go by, I call and text her she does not respond at all. She would respond sometimes just saying she is ""busy"". Now its February, I go by her house to drop chocolates and flowers for Valentimes day, she does not answer the phone at all. I leave it at the door and texted her and went home. She sends me a audio message a couple days later saying she hopes I am doing okay mentally and that she is talking to someone and its to a point where she feels the need to let me know. We made a promise to each other that if we started talking to someone that we would let each other know and respect that decision. She also mentions that she is not comfortable talking on the phone at the moment and wish me the best. This absoulety broke me in tears. I called my friend on my way home from work in complete disbelief. I then find out my grandma passes away a view days later. I call my ex and she does not respond,I go to her house like a dummy and her roommate is there and says she not here. She sends me a text saying dont come to her house again unannounced and it made her uncomfortable and crossed her boundary. I understand how she feels but my emotions were high. I apologiize and realize how that looks but my intentions was that I needed someone to talk to. She does not text me back and I unfollower her on ig. I think we are ofically done done. I know it was dumb for me to go by her house but I just rang the doorbell and went home. I feel complelty broken, I feel like I cant trust anyone ever again. I was feed lies and replaced very quickly. One of the reasons we broke up is because she felt she needed time to heal and focus on herself. How can you heal if you are intimate with a new person so quickly. I stalk her twitter and she is talking to a guy with a whole kid. He has his ig in his bio, I then notice her close friends and her bf follow him! (these two unfollowed me on ig right when we broke up) I then go to her Spotify page and she unfollowed me on there too .. spotify of all all things and follows him thats how I know its him. We had plans of us moving in together and everything. I dont have a lot of friends or family so this is one of the hardest things I ever dealt with emotionally. My anxiety is at a all time high and do not know how I am going to move on. I just replay all the things I could have done differently. I try to go out by myself like the beach and gym but I am not satisfied doing things alone now. If you read all of this you are a real one. I would like some advice. I know therapy is a obvious option but I can not afford that right now. This is eating me alive I wake up at 3 am everyday dreaming of her.",1,1742778264.0,BreakUps,0,0.99,False

This is a shortened version of my family life and I and finally getting out of the church for good.

So I was a convert and my wife a lifer.
In 2007 I read the book. By Grant Palmer. 
The insiders view of Mormon Origin.

After reading this book and ALL THE TRUTH in it. I was done. The truth was revealed to me. Funny, right after a Church Court on my infidelity. And put on Disfellowshiped for 18 months. As y'all probably know what this all about. 

So after reading the book and going against the church. Everything my wife lived for. Everything was second and putting The Church always above ALL in her life.
So 2 STRIKES I was out. Literally. I went in for minor heart surgery and my wife took the kids and left. I ended up in a mental hospital very short time later.. What they called. Trauma, Stress, and extreme Depression. 

Once I came home. There was a foreclosure on my front door. My truck repo'd. My house pretty much cleaned out. So that's as much as I'll go into that.
I was apart from my family for one year. 

Moving ahead quickly. My wife asked me to come back home. However she just stopped going to church. But I kept going. Trying to make her happy. So I'm trying to keep and save our marriage and family together. And trying to be the Peter Priesthood man. But my wife. The lifer, just stops going. 

She found coffee and alcohol and liked it. After about 2 years living like that. We moved to up North Dallas. About 1.5 years in living here. I had an extreme life changing experience for ALL of us. 

I died. Yes there was a very bad hospital accident where I flat lined twice and brought back. Kept in an induced coma for 6 weeks. Coming back to the beginning of an entire new life. 

Moving forward. About  2 months after getting out of the hospital. I gave my wife the same book I read way back in 2007. The Grant Palmer book. It's now 2016. I basically bugged and begged her to read it. Cuz she wanted to be a Mormon and Christian and didn't understand why it didn't work like that. 

She finally said ok. Went into our bedroom. About 2 hours later, after only reading the first chapter. She comes out and says. ""I'm done""
My heart sank and I thought she was saying. Done with me again. 
No..... She said I'm done with the church. ""I almost fainted.""

Together for two long years. We dove into the Internet, books, even LDS websites and books. And discovered the truths about the church. Which several are now coming out and admitting to. 

June 2016 we walked away for good. Together. OUR MARRIAGE HAS NEVER been BETTER since. Married now 38 years. We are going now,to a non-denominational Christian Church. Yeah it's Pretty chill. Real people living real lives. Not hiding behind closed doors and the condemnation.

People have been trying to encourage me to write a book. I have no idea how to even start 
ALL I KNOW IS THAT WE'RE FREE ""TOGETHER.""

Thank you for reading our story. It's been cut down extremely short.

I've been encouraged to just to give you the basics. It's been quite a ride. 
Y'all, enjoy life. Don't allow anyone to control your life any longer. 

You do you. Be free. Live your life.

We all know **Andrew Huberman**, the Stanford neuroscientist blowing up the internet with science-backed advice for optimizing our brains and bodies.  But have you ever broken down *exactly* what he does and how it fuels his incredible output?

This isn't just about biohacking; it's about building a *sustainable system* for consistent high performance.  Here's an outline of key habits from his routine, focusing on what *you* can implement to boost your own success:

**I.  ☀️ Master Your Morning: Setting the Stage for Success (Phase 1: 0-8h Post-Waking)**

*   **🌅 Sunlight Exposure (Impact: 3, Effort: 1):**
    *   **Why it matters:**  Anchors circadian rhythm, boosts alertness and mood (dopamine!).  Crucial for overall well-being and consistent energy.
    *   **Actionable:**  Get 2-10 mins of sunlight within an hour of waking. Even cloudy days count!
*   **💧 Electrolyte Hydration (Impact: 2, Effort: 1):**
    *   **Why it matters:**  Optimizes neuron function right away.  Think of it as jumpstarting your brain.
    *   **Actionable:**  Salt water or electrolyte mix (like LMNT) first thing. Lemon for extra absorption.
*   **☕ Delayed Caffeine (Impact: 3, Effort: 2):**
    *   **Why it matters:**  Works *with* your natural cortisol peak, avoiding crashes and maximizing sustained energy.
    *   **Actionable:**  Wait 90-120 mins after waking before coffee. Hydrate first!
*   **🧠 Fasted Morning Work (Impact: 2, Effort: 2):**
    *   **Why it matters:** Leverages elevated norepinephrine for focused work.  Capitalize on that morning clarity.
    *   **Actionable:**  Tackle deep work for 90 mins *before* your first meal. Combine with delayed caffeine for extra boost.
*   **🥦 AG1 (Optional, Impact: 2, Effort: 1):**
    *   **Why it matters:**  Ensures micronutrient baseline without a heavy breakfast, supporting intermittent fasting benefits.
    *   **Actionable:** Consider AG1 or a similar greens powder for nutritional insurance.

**II. 🎯 Optimize Focus & Productivity Throughout the Day (Phases 2 & 3: 9-24h Post-Waking)**

*   **🗓️ Phase-Based Habit Stacking (Impact: 3, Effort: 2):**
    *   **Why it matters:**  Aligns tasks with your natural energy fluctuations.  Work smarter, not harder.
    *   **Actionable:** Divide your day into phases (0-8h, 9-15h, 16-24h) and schedule demanding tasks in Phase 1 (morning dopamine peak).
*   **🗂️ Task Bracketing (Impact: 3, Effort: 2):**
    *   **Why it matters:** Reduces cognitive load by batching similar tasks.  Increases automaticity and efficiency.
    *   **Actionable:** Group similar tasks (calls, emails, writing) into dedicated time blocks.
*   **🚧 Limbic Friction Management (Impact: 3, Effort: 2):**
    *   **Why it matters:**  Proactively addresses resistance to habits.  Crucial for long-term consistency.
    *   **Actionable:** Identify high-resistance habits and pre-plan solutions (""If X happens, I'll do Y"").

**III.  💪  Sustained Health & Recovery: The Foundation of Longevity & Performance**

*   **🧘 Yoga Nidra/NSDR (Impact: 2, Effort: 2):**
    *   **Why it matters:**  Replenishes dopamine, enhances neuroplasticity, combats sleep debt.  Essential for recovery and learning.
    *   **Actionable:** 10-30 mins of guided NSDR post-lunch. YouTube is your friend!
*   **🥶 Cold Plunge (Impact: 2, Effort: 3):**
    *   **Why it matters:**  Metabolic boost, mental resilience.  Trains your stress response system.
    *   **Actionable:**  1-3 min cold plunge weekly (45°F). Start slow and focus on breathing.
*   **🏋️ Structured Workout Split (Impact: 3, Effort: 3):**
    *   **Why it matters:**  Maximizes hormonal response and recovery, minimizes injury. Sustainable fitness approach.
    *   **Actionable:** Consider a 6-day split incorporating endurance, strength, cardio, and recovery (see JSON for example split).
*   **🌙 Evening Carb Loading (Impact: 2, Effort: 1):**
    *   **Why it matters:**  Improves sleep quality and latency.  Prioritizes recovery during sleep.
    *   **Actionable:**  Starchy carbs 3-4 hours before bed. Avoid heavy protein.
*   **😴 Supplement Sleep Stack (Impact: 2, Effort: 1):**
    *   **Why it matters:**  Enhances sleep depth and REM.  Addresses age-related sleep decline.
    *   **Actionable:** Consider Magnesium Bisglycinate, Apigenin, L-Theanine (consult resources and professionals).
*   **💡 Evening Light Hygiene (Impact: 3, Effort: 1):**
    *   **Why it matters:**  Maintains melatonin production, crucial for circadian alignment and sleep.
    *   **Actionable:** Dim lights after 10 PM, avoid overheads, use candlelight/red bulbs.
*   **🚶 Evening Optic Flow (Impact: 1, Effort: 1):**
    *   **Why it matters:**  Transitions to rest state, reinforces circadian timing.  Simple and effective wind-down.
    *   **Actionable:** 10-min sunset walk without devices.

**IV. 🧱 Habit Mastery: Building Lasting Change**

*   **🗓️ 21-Day Habit Trials (Impact: 3, Effort: 3):**
    *   **Why it matters:**  Leverages synaptic plasticity for habit formation.  Focus on consistency for myelinating new neural pathways.
    *   **Actionable:** Commit to new habits for 21 days with 85%+ consistency. Track your effort and progress.
*   **🚪 Decisional Off-Ramps (Impact: 2, Effort: 2):**
    *   **Why it matters:**  Disrupts unwanted habit loops.  Creates competing pathways for breaking bad habits.
    *   **Actionable:** Pre-plan escape routes for unwanted habits (e.g., pushups after craving).

**Key Takeaway:**  Huberman's success isn't magic. It's a *systematic approach* built on science-backed habits.  Start small, implement gradually, and focus on consistency.

1jiewfx,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jiewfx/my_ma_story_at_7_weeks_failed/,My MA story at 7 weeks (failed),"
Hi, I'm 34 (F) from the Philippines. As you all know, abortion here is illegal, just like in many other countries. I’m sharing my story to give courage to anyone who may be in a similar situation.

Timeline of My Pregnancy and MA Journey
February 5 – I took a pregnancy test and it came back positive.

From that moment, I knew I didn’t want to continue the pregnancy. I started researching on Facebook and watching videos on TikTok. Eventually, I found a seller on Facebook who provided abortion pills. I ordered them immediately and waited for delivery, which took about 3-5 days.

February 18 – The pills arrived. I messaged the seller, and she sent me a list of things to prepare for the procedure.

She advised me to take evening primrose oil to help soften my cervix—two capsules inserted vaginally and one taken on an empty stomach.

She also recommended drinking black coffee (no sugar), pineapple juice, and ginger tea, as well as steaming for 20 minutes, walking, and even jumping 1,000 times. While I followed most of her instructions, I skipped the jumping.

First Attempt at MA
February 20, 10:00 PM – Took 3 Mifepristone.
11:00 PM – Took another dose of Mifepristone.
12:00 AM – Inserted 3 Cytotec vaginally.
12:30 AM – Swallowed 3 Cytotec with water.

After that, I took the remaining pills:

6 Cytotec
8 Mifepristone
2 Meth
Total: 16 pills
The seller instructed me to:

Keep my legs raised for 2 hours.
Lie down and avoid peeing or pooping for 7 hours.
After the 7-hour procedure, I only had mild cramping (4/10 pain level) and very little bleeding—just light spotting with small clots. I knew, based on others' experiences, that my first attempt had failed.

I felt helpless, especially since I was struggling financially. I started researching again, and thankfully, I found this subreddit, which has been a huge help.

I will share my second MA attempt with WOW pills in a separate post.",3,1742778152.0,abortion,4,0.71,False

However when she landed on earth, she was forcefully pushed into being a barista for a local coffee shop. Glorpette, hoping this will bring her closer to capturing Gorpa agreed. However, she eventually got so accustomed to the minimum wage coffee job she had, she dropped plans to capture Gorpa and became a corporate slave.

Gorpette is very different from Gorpa, being able to speak perfect english and has more of an edgy attitude, she is Gorpas polar opposite. Whenever she is asked about her missions objective she states “Im working on it.” (she really is NOT) Gorpette is also very proficient in all things combat related and is stronger than Gorpa in every way.",4,1742777973.0,RobloxAvatars,2,0.84,False
1jieu4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jieu4o/aitah_for_sending_my_exes_wife_a_binder/,AITAH for sending my exes wife a binder documenting his abuse after I found out she was pregnant?,"This is a throwaway because I’m not anonymous on my main. 

I have an ex who I was in an abusive relationship with that ended with quite a bang. He was arrested for harassment and threats with a dangerous weapon, put on probation for 5 years, and can never own a firearm again. The abuse started mentally, then financially, then physically. 

During my years with him, I did think to save a good amount of evidence of the abuse and documented a lot in personal journals. In the years since, I’ve gone to a lot of therapy, and I mean a lot, and ended up compiling that documentation into a binder. I basically scrapbooked my way through processing trauma. And that binder has been sitting in a storage unit since I moved in with my now husband.  

Well I knew that my ex ended up marrying a girl I knew from high school who was sweet and smart and very liberal. This guy was a deadbeat, misspelled a tattoo he did on himself, and wished he was at the capital on the 6th. (I swear my taste in men isn’t total trash, my husband is amazing)

But the pair never made sense to me and I just prayed that he was capable of change and didn’t do what he did to me, to her. When I found out she was pregnant with his kid I couldn’t stop worrying about her. I found out, as expected, the story she got was that I was crazy and a cheater and I made things up, and she likely didn’t even know about his arrest and conviction. I don’t know what their relationship was like behind closed doors but I knew that I’d have an endless amount of ‘what if’s’ if he had a child with her and was anything like he was with me because nobody deserves the treatment I got and no child should ever have to see that or think it’s okay. 

So, I made a copy of every single page I put in the binder and packed them up with a handwritten note offering to talk about anything if she’d like. I gave them to a mutual friend to deliver so he couldn’t intercept. About a week later, she texted me. We met for coffee and she brought the papers, pulling pages out one by one and asking for context and comparing the story he told to mine. After a bit she just sat silently and told me how sorry she was for what I went through. I was a little surprised she believed it no question, and she told me she didn’t believe any of it until the official court records and my victim impact statement. Then it was like it all clicked how real it was. 

I offered her a room or any help if she wanted to leave, but she said she was going to head home and pack a bag for her parents. It’s been a few days since and she’s staying with them until she decides her next move, but hasn’t told him the real reason behind this all yet. 

At first I had no doubt or regret about what I did. But I’ve had some people tell me that I had no business blowing up her life and I have no idea what he is like now. But I was doing what I think I would want someone to do for me? I’m not sure, AITAH? ",1886,1742777966.0,AITAH,269,0.97,False
