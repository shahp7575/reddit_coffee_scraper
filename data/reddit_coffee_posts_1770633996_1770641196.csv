The kitchen light stayed on too long, casting long shadows across the table where the signed postnuptial agreement and the tear-stained letter lay between them like exhausted soldiers after a ceasefire. Mark’s sobs had quieted first, turning into ragged breaths, then silence. Sarah’s tears followed the same arc—loud and wrenching, then slow and spent. Neither moved to comfort the other. Neither knew how yet.

Eventually Mark stood, legs unsteady, gathered the documents without looking at her, and walked to the guest room. The door closed softly this time—not slammed, not locked, just closed. Sarah remained seated a few minutes longer, staring at the empty chair across from her, then rose, turned off the light, and climbed the stairs to the master bedroom alone.

Morning arrived gray and quiet.

Sarah made coffee the way she always had. Mark appeared in the doorway, showered but unshaven, eyes red-rimmed. He accepted the mug she handed him without comment. They ate toast standing at the counter while the kids still slept. No small talk. No questions.

At 9:17 a.m. they were sitting side by side in the waiting area of Victoria Kane’s law office. The receptionist gave them curious glances—couples usually came in angry or triumphant, not hollowed out like this. Kane herself appeared brisk, professional, almost disappointed that no courtroom battle was forthcoming.

“You’re both sure?” she asked, sliding the postnuptial across the desk one last time.

Mark looked at Sarah. Sarah looked back at him. Neither smiled. Neither hesitated.

They signed. Kane’s notary stamped and sealed. The document was real now—binding, asymmetrical, a sword held over Sarah’s head for the rest of the marriage. If she ever cheated again, she would walk away with almost nothing.

They left the office without speaking in the elevator.

For the next several nights they continued sleeping in separate rooms. The guest room had become Mark’s default; the master bedroom still carried too many ghosts for him to reclaim it. Sarah didn’t ask him to come back. She didn’t push.

Four days later she slid a small white card across the kitchen island while he was pouring cereal for the kids.

Dr. Elena Moreau

Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist

Specializing in Infidelity Recovery & Relational Trauma

Below it, handwritten in Sarah’s neat script:

Tuesday, 7:00 p.m.

First session already booked.

I’ll drive if you want.

Mark stared at the card for a long moment.

“I’ll meet you there,” he said quietly.

The first session was brutal.

Dr. Moreau was in her late fifties, calm-voiced, unflinching. She didn’t let either of them hide.

Sarah cried through most of the first hour as she recounted the affair in detail—every lie, every stolen moment, every time she looked Mark in the eye and said “I love you” while already betraying him. The shame poured out of her in waves. Mark sat rigid, arms crossed, jaw locked, until Moreau turned to him.

“And you, Mark—what did you contribute to the distance that made this possible?”

He bristled. “I didn’t fuck someone else in our bed.”

“No,” Moreau agreed. “But you were gone long before she was. Emotionally checked out. Working late, short answers, stopped asking about her day, stopped initiating affection. You both describe a marriage that had become roommates with children. That didn’t cause her to cheat—but it created the vacuum she filled somewhere else.”

Mark looked like he’d been slapped. He didn’t argue. He just stared at the carpet.

Nothing was swept under the rug.

They dissected resentments, unmet needs, childhood patterns that showed up in adulthood, the slow erosion of curiosity and playfulness between them. They named the ugly truths: Sarah’s thrill-seeking escapism, Mark’s passive withdrawal and perfectionism, the way both of them had stopped fighting for the marriage long before the affair.

And yet Moreau also made them look at what still remained.

The way Sarah still instinctively reached to fix Mark’s collar in the morning.

The way Mark still checked that the kids’ car seats were secure even when he was furious.

The photo albums they both kept adding to.

The inside jokes that slipped out sometimes despite everything.

From the ruins they began—slowly, painfully—to build.

Communication returned in fragments.

Three weeks in, they could sit in the same room and speak without sarcasm or explosion. Four months in, the bursts of anger and the sharp, cutting comments had mostly disappeared. They learned to say “That hurt” instead of “You always…” They learned to listen without planning their rebuttal. They learned that apologies could be specific and that forgiveness didn’t mean forgetting—it meant choosing not to weaponize memory.

Physical intimacy took far longer.

Seven months after that first brutal therapy session, they finally crossed back into each other’s bodies.

It started as hate-fuck—raw, angry, desperate. Clothes half-on, no tenderness, just need and punishment and grief colliding. They did it in silence except for gasps and bitten-off curses. Afterward they lay on opposite sides of the bed, breathing hard, not touching.

But something shifted after that.

The next time was slower.

Then slower still.

Then it became lovemaking—long, deliberate, almost reverent. Hands that once clenched in fury now traced scars and stretch marks with care. Mouths that had spat venom now whispered apologies and gratitude against skin. They rediscovered each other not as the people they used to be, but as the people they were becoming.

A full year after the day he walked in and found his world shattered, they were in a good place—not perfect, not storybook, but solid.

They still slept in the same bed now.

They still went to therapy—every other week, maintenance rather than crisis.

Suggestions, discussions, and opinions were no longer optional—they were required. Decisions were made together, even small ones. Trust was not blindly given; it was earned daily, checked regularly, repaired quickly when cracked.

Sarah’s friends—Emily, Jess, and Mia—watched from the sidelines with cautious joy.

They were genuinely happy for her when she told them about the long lovemaking sessions, about Mark reaching for her hand in the grocery store, about the way he now asked her opinion first on almost everything.

But they also sat her down one humid Saturday afternoon over iced coffee and said it plainly.

“We stood behind you when the storm was at its worst,” Mia said. “We rallied, we strategized, we backed you even when we were disappointed as hell. But if this ever happens again—if you ever step outside this marriage again—we will be the first ones to desert you. Even before him.”

Sarah looked down at her glass, throat tight.

Emily reached across the table and squeezed her wrist. “We love you. That’s why we’re saying it. We helped you keep your family because we believed the remorse was real. If it ever turns out it wasn’t… we won’t do it twice.”

Jess added softly, “And we already chewed you out plenty when the dust settled. We won’t hesitate to do it again if we have to.”

Sarah nodded. Tears welled but didn’t fall.

“I know,” she whispered. “I know.”

Later that night, after the kids were asleep, Mark found her on the back porch staring at the stars.

He sat beside her on the swing. Their shoulders touched.

“You okay?” he asked.

She leaned her head against his. “Yeah. Just… grateful. And scared of ever losing this again.”

He wrapped an arm around her.

“Then we don’t,” he said simply.

They stayed like that a long time—quiet, together, rebuilt not from blind faith, but from deliberate, hard-won choice.

A year to the day since everything broke.

And for the first time in a long time, the future didn’t feel like something to survive.

It felt like something worth protecting.

Many decades had slipped by since that raw, tear-soaked night at the kitchen table.

The house was quieter now. The children’s bedrooms had long ago been emptied of posters and half-finished homework; Lily and Max were grown, married, parents themselves. Grandchildren—three so far, with another on the way—filled the living room with noise and chaos whenever they visited, scattering toys and leaving sticky fingerprints on the refrigerator door. The once-chaotic mornings of school runs and spilled cereal had been replaced by slow coffee on the porch, joint aches that announced themselves with every step, and the gentle rhythm of two people who had learned how to share silence as comfortably as they once shared a bed.

They were both in their mid-seventies now. Hair silver-white, skin softened by time and sun, hands that had once gripped each other in fury now held one another with the absentminded tenderness of long habit. Mark still wore the same style of wire-rimmed glasses, though the prescription had grown thicker. Sarah still tied her hair back with the same soft scrunchie she’d been using since the early 2000s. Little things. Constant things.

One late-afternoon in early autumn, they sat together on the wide cedar porch swing that overlooked the backyard. The sky was turning the color of ripe peaches and bruised plums. A light breeze carried the scent of drying leaves and distant woodsmoke.

Mark’s hand rested on Sarah’s knee, thumb moving in slow, unconscious circles.

After a long, comfortable quiet he spoke.

“I still remember the day you slid that packet across the table,” he said, voice low and roughened by age. “The vicious one. Twenty counseling sessions, the house, primary custody, alimony that would’ve left me eating ramen in a studio apartment until I was eighty. You laid it out so calmly… and then you listed what divorce would really cost me. Not just money. The kids calling someone else ‘Dad.’ You painted it so clearly I could see it happening.”

Sarah’s gaze stayed on the horizon, but the corner of her mouth lifted—just a fraction.

He continued, softer now. “I asked you once, years later, why you went so nuclear. I never asked again. But tonight… I’d like to know the truth. One last time.”

She turned her head slowly and met his eyes.

“I had to show you I was willing to fight,” she said simply. “And fight dirty, if that’s what it took to keep you. To keep us. To keep our family from being torn into two households and two Christmases and two bedrooms for the kids to bounce between. I needed you to believe—for just long enough—that I would burn everything down rather than let you walk away without a real fight.”

She paused, breathing in the cooling air.

“But if you had still pushed forward—if you had signed those papers and walked out that door—I would not have gone scorched earth. I would have accepted it. I would have owned what I did, faced every consequence, and tried to build something decent out of the wreckage for Lily and Max. The petition… it was never about chaining you forever. It was a bluff to get you to sit back down at the table. To give us a chance to talk instead of just signing and disappearing.”

Mark studied her face for a long moment. The lines around her eyes had deepened, but the eyes themselves were still the same—clear, steady, a little sad even now when remembering.

He leaned over slowly, pressed a kiss to her temple.

“The postnuptial, though,” he murmured against her hair, “that one did keep me chained.”

Sarah let out a small, surprised laugh—the sound he had loved for over fifty years.

“Yes,” she admitted. “That one was real. And I signed it willingly. Because I knew I owed you that security. That if I ever failed you again, you would be protected. But the chain?” She turned her hand palm-up so he could lace their fingers together. “I never wanted you chained. I wanted you to choose to stay. Every day. Willingly.”

He squeezed her hand.

“I did,” he said quietly. “I chose. Every damn day.”

They sat in silence again as the sun slipped below the tree line and the first stars appeared, faint and shy.

That night, after Sarah had gone to bed—her breathing slow and even, the room dark except for the hallway nightlight—she slept alone in their bedroom.

Mark did not join her.

Instead he padded down the hall in his worn flannel robe to the small study that had once been a nursery, then a playroom, then a home office, and now just a quiet place filled with books and old photographs.

He opened the bottom drawer of the oak desk. Beneath tax folders and old insurance policies lay a single manila envelope, yellowed at the edges. Inside: the original signed and notarized postnuptial agreement.

He carried it to the leather armchair by the window, switched on the small reading lamp, and unfolded the pages he had not looked at in more than thirty-five years.

The language was as brutal and one-sided as he remembered. Her signature—still the same looping S and neat T—stared up at him from the final page. His own signature was there too, smaller, more hesitant, made on a day when he had felt like a man with no good choices left.

He read it slowly. Every clause. Every sacrifice she had offered. Every piece of leverage she had voluntarily placed in his hands.

When he finished, he sat very still for a long time.

Then he reached into the pocket of his robe and took out the old Zippo lighter he had carried since his twenties—the one Sarah had given him for their first anniversary.

He flicked it once. A small, steady flame appeared.

He held the corner of the document to the fire.

The paper caught quickly. Orange light danced across his face as the pages curled and blackened. He watched until the last scrap turned to ash and drifted into the metal wastebasket he had placed underneath.

He blew out the lighter, closed the lid with a soft click.

Sex had become almost nonexistent in their lives years ago. Age, medications, joint pain, fatigue—none of it mattered much anymore. What they had now was different, deeper: hands held in the dark, foreheads touching, quiet laughter at three in the morning when one of them couldn’t sleep. It was enough. More than enough.

Mark stood, turned off the lamp, and walked back down the hall.

He slipped into bed beside Sarah without turning on the light.

She stirred, half-asleep, and reached for him instinctively.

He gathered her close—carefully, gently, mindful of fragile bones and tender places.

She settled against his chest with a small, contented sound.

In the darkness he whispered against her hair, words he hadn’t needed to say in years but still felt true:

“You gave me the document to keep me safe.

But you gave me yourself to keep me happy.”

Sarah’s hand found his under the covers and squeezed once, softly.

They stayed like that—two old people, scarred and mended, breathing in time—until sleep finally took them both.

Outside, the moon rose over the quiet backyard.

Inside, the ashes in the study had already cooled.

And somewhere between the ruins of one marriage and the long, deliberate rebuilding of another, they had found something that outlasted both the threat and the promise.

I'm a loner, Dottie. A rebel.","**TL;DR:** Internet-addicted PC gamer seeks someone to talk to about video games and other *very* important topics.

I'm a grown man that is living out his childhood dreams of sitting around playing video games all day. Since I was a child that's really what I've wanted to do, the only difference between my childhood fantasies and my current reality is that I didn't want to be alone while I did this. Tempted to use the ""find my player 2"" trope, but I feel like that makes the other person a sidekick. I am looking for a partner, an equal, not a sidekick.

In my dating history I've always found the most important part of a relationship to me is the conversation. There's a certain flow that good conversationalists have that other people just don't. An ability to flow with the topics, to interject comedy, to take a piece of something and spin it into something else, some people just get it but a lot of people do not.

I'm looking for someone who can mock any topic while also mocking the person they're talking to and mocking themselves, much like Statler and Waldorf on The Muppets.

Conversation flow is enough for even people with nothing in common to get along for a few days, but for something a bit more lasting I think you need more compatibility.

With that in mind the rest of this ad is gonna be ranting about myself to help you establish if you think we might have similar tastes and mentalities.

**Positive Traits:**

\- I'm intelligent enough to not feel immodest or arrogant saying I'm intelligent.

\- If we're on the same wavelength I'm hilarious. If we are not on the same wavelength I am probably disturbing and awkward.

\- Overly honest. Everyone lies, myself included, but I make a conscious effort to minimize it and not abuse my powers for evil.

\- Loyal. I'm someone who likes an extremely small social circle so I tend to be pretty intent on doing right by the handful of people in that circle.

\- Extremely self-aware. That's what separates me from the rest of the crazies.

**Hobbies:**

\- Gaming like my life depends on it.

\- Gaming seriously.

\- Gaming semi-seriously.

\- Gaming casually.

\- Overindulging in most other types of media, typically in the background while gaming. TV, movies, podcasts, music, YouTube rabbit holes. I try to incorporate some things with subtitles to pull me away from gaming and get me exercising as I watch anime or some other foreign media.

\- Boxing, or more accurately hitting a punching bag because all other cardio is boring.

**Quirks:**

\- I don't like driving or even being in cars. I have a car and do drive but I hate it.

\- I don't like phones. I do not utilize them in my daily life, I use them primarily for GPS.

\- No interest in fashion in the real world. I dress for comfort and usually am not even aware of what I am currently wearing, I grab what's at the top of the laundry pile. I do however care about fashion when it comes to my virtual avatars inside video games.

\- I've smoked marijuana on and off for 25 years. Currently on.

\- I've drank coffee and tea on and off for the last 25 years. Currently off.

\- Apolitical...maybe anti-political?

\- Areligious...maybe anti-religious?

\- A love of critters. I feed the local wildlife but have no pets, just some regular visitors.

\- The least military-y honorably discharged veteran. I don't like guns being anywhere near me, I don't like the government, I don't like people telling me what to do. Never shot at anyone, never got shot at, hopefully that trend continues.

\- Chronic smartass, trouble turning it off even at inappropriate times.

\- Popcorn brain, constant need for stimulation and thoughts that pop around. I associate things in conversation in odd ways that can often spark a desire to send a loosely connected meme, gif, or YouTube video.

\- Overly logical and analytical which tends to cause pessimism, though not necessarily pessimistic by default.

\- I avoid saturated fat, sugar and salt so my diet is extremely dull.

\- I send a lot of random videos. [https://youtu.be/eVkWhnaILl8?si=UHpw-hVlh9yEnXBd](https://youtu.be/eVkWhnaILl8?si=UHpw-hVlh9yEnXBd)

**Red Flags:**

\- 5'6""

\- Rarely leaves the house. Not agoraphobic, just apathetic about the outside world.

\- Divorced for nearly a decade. No kids.

\- Lack of real world ambition. Endless ambition to conquer virtual worlds. Seeing a theme yet?

\- Lazy in the real world. Hardworking in virtual worlds.

\- A complete disconnect from world events to a stubborn degree.

\- A general disdain for humanity.

\- Inconsistent use of the Oxford comma. Overuse of normal commas and ellipsiseses. I also use ""it's"" for both the possessive and conjunction.

\- Tend to act like and sound like I know what I'm talking about even when I most certainly don't.

So that's who I am, message me and let me know who you are.

The initial phase of their plan had bought them precious time, those 15 days stretching like a fragile bridge over the abyss. Sarah's unwavering normalcy had kept the household humming: breakfasts served with a smile, school runs executed flawlessly, evenings filled with the kids' bedtime routines and quiet acts of domestic care. It had given Mark space to fester, but more importantly, it had given her circle time to mobilize.

Emily, Jess, and Mia weren't idle. They convened almost daily, first over frantic group calls in the early mornings while Sarah prepped the kids, then in person at a local coffee shop tucked away from prying eyes. ""We're not letting this implode without a fight,"" Mia declared on day three, her voice steely as she sipped her latte. ""Mark's a great guy—we all know that. He's been good to you, Sarah, and we adore him for it. But you're our girl, and what you did was a screw-up, not a death sentence. We're disappointed, yeah, but loyalty wins.""

Sarah nodded, her eyes puffy from another sleepless night. ""I just want to fix this. The remorse... it's eating me alive. Not just because I got caught—because I broke us. But he's charging ahead with divorce like it's the only option.""

Jess, ever the empath, squeezed her hand. ""We get it. True regret shows in actions, and you've been stellar these past days. Now, we need intel. Lawyers. Options.""

They started small: Emily tapped her network for family law recommendations, pulling strings through her husband's colleague who knew a divorce attorney. By day five, they'd consulted two mid-level lawyers via Zoom, gleaning basics on Louisiana divorce laws. ""Community property state,"" the first one explained dryly. ""Everything acquired during marriage splits 50/50—house equity, savings, retirement accounts. Child support follows state guidelines: based on combined gross income, number of kids, custody share. Alimony—spousal support here—can be interim during proceedings or final, but only if the requesting spouse is fault-free and in need. With kids under 18, no-fault divorce requires 365 days living apart, or fault grounds like adultery speed it up, but counseling is mandatory—one session for couples with minors.""

The second lawyer echoed this, adding, ""Custody: Joint is presumed best for the kids unless one parent's unfit. Primary physical custody often goes to the main caregiver—sounds like you, Sarah. House could go to the custodial parent for stability, with the other paying their share of mortgage. Health insurance: If he's got employer benefits, he might have to maintain coverage for you and kids post-divorce.""

But these lawyers were too neutral, too even-handed. ""We need a shark,"" Mia insisted after the calls. ""Someone who'll make Mark think twice."" Through friends of friends—a chain that led to Mia's cousin's ex-boss—they landed on Attorney Victoria Kane. Known in legal circles as a ""man-eater,"" Kane had a reputation for dismantling high-earning husbands in court, securing lopsided settlements that left men reeling. Whispers followed her: she'd once bankrupted a cheating executive, arguing his infidelity voided any claim to sympathy. ""She's ruthless,"" the referral warned. ""Hates deadbeat dads and philandering fools—but she'll flip it to paint the man as the villain every time.""

They met Kane on day eight, in her sleek downtown office overlooking the Mississippi. Sarah, flanked by her friends, laid out the story—the affair, the discovery, Mark's push for divorce. Kane leaned back, her sharp eyes assessing. ""Adultery's fault grounds here in Louisiana. He could use it to fast-track, avoid the 365-day wait for no-fault. But you're remorseful? Good mother? Part-time job, him the breadwinner? We can work with that."" She outlined the laws crisply: ""Property's community—50/50 split on marital assets. But we push for you keeping the house for the kids' sake; he pays the note. Retirement? Half yours. Savings, same. Child support: Guidelines max it at about 25-30% of his income for two kids, plus extras like health, education. Alimony: We'll argue need—your limited earning potential versus his steady job. Interim support during, final for rehab or permanent if justified. Custody: Joint legal, but primary physical to you as caregiver; him weekends, holidays split. And counseling? State requires one session for parents with minors, but in covenant marriages—wait, did you have one?""

Sarah shook her head. ""Regular marriage.""

Kane smirked. ""Pity. Covenants mandate extensive counseling—up to 20 sessions or more before divorce. But we can draft a proposal mandating it anyway, frame it as a reconciliation effort. Make him sweat the time and cost.""

By day ten, Kane had drafted papers. They were a masterpiece of aggression, designed not to win outright but to stall and terrify. Titled as a counter-petition for divorce (in case he filed), it demanded:

Mandatory 20 couples counseling sessions before any proceedings advanced, citing the kids' emotional well-being and Louisiana's emphasis on family preservation (stretching the one-session mandate into a prolonged ordeal).

Primary physical custody to Sarah, with Mark getting minimal visitation—every other weekend and one midweek dinner, per ""best interest"" standards, arguing her role as primary caregiver.

The family home awarded to Sarah for the children's stability, with Mark continuing mortgage payments as the higher earner (community property, but use-and-occupancy to her).

Child support at the maximum under Louisiana guidelines: Based on his $85,000 salary (they'd dug up estimates), roughly $1,500/month for two kids, plus 100% of health insurance, extracurriculars, and education costs.

Division of all community assets 50/50: Savings accounts halved, his 401(k) and pension split equally via QDRO.

Maximum alimony: Interim during proceedings ($2,000/month), transitioning to final periodic support for five years ($1,500/month), citing her part-time graphic design gig ($25,000/year) versus his accounting stability, and her ""need"" post-homemaking years.

His employer-provided health insurance to cover her and the kids indefinitely, or equivalent payments.

It was a blueprint for financial ruin, leveraging Louisiana's laws to their limits while painting Sarah as the devoted, faultless mother (downplaying the adultery as a ""lapse"" she'd atone for).

""We don't file yet,"" Kane advised. ""Wait for his move. Stall with this—make him see the cliff he's jumping off.""

The friends debriefed that night over wine at Emily's house. ""It's brutal,"" Jess admitted, ""and we like Mark. But if he pushes, this protects you and the kids.""

Sarah swallowed hard. ""I don't want to destroy him. I love him. But if he won't listen to sorry...""

Mia nodded. ""Then he listens to fear. Plan's set: When he serves, stay calm. No tears. Apologize once, affirm love. Hand over our papers. Let him absorb. Spell out consequences—physical, financial, emotional. Give him a week to stew. Keep being you.""

Day 16 dawned like any other. Sarah whipped up eggs and toast, kissed the kids off to school. Mark, papers in his briefcase, had decided: Tonight, after bedtime.

Evening came. Kids asleep, the living room dim. Mark sat her down, his face a mask of resolved sadness. ""Sarah, I've thought about this every day. The hurt... it's too much. I can't rebuild trust. Here's the petition."" He slid the folder across the coffee table—his lawyer's draft: No-fault under Article 102, joint custody, 50/50 asset split, guideline child support, no alimony (citing her fault), house sold and proceeds halved.

Sarah took it, flipping through calmly, her heart pounding but face serene. No pleading this time. She set it down, met his eyes evenly.

""Mark, before I respond, I need you to hear me. I'm sorry for what I did. Truly, deeply sorry. It was a mistake I'll never repeat. I love you—loved you then, love you now, will always love you and our kids. But if you're set on this path, I'm sorry, but I'll fight the divorce to the ends of the earth. Not out of spite, but for our family.""

She reached into her bag, pulling out Kane's thick envelope. ""Here are my counter-papers. Read them.""

Mark frowned, opening it. His eyes widened as he scanned: The 20 mandatory counseling sessions, dragging proceedings for months. Primary custody to her—him as ""weekend dad."" House to her, mortgage on him. Child support maxed at $1,500/month plus extras. Assets halved, his retirement gutted. Alimony demands that would leave him scraping by. Health insurance obligations stretching years.

""What the hell is this?"" he muttered, flipping pages, color draining. ""Twenty counseling sessions? That's not even required—""

""Our lawyer says we can push for it, for the kids' sake,"" Sarah replied calmly, no tremor. ""Louisiana mandates at least one, but extending it preserves families. And the rest... it's what the law allows. Community property—50/50 on everything we built together. Custody based on best interest; I'm the primary parent. Support guidelines maxed because you earn more, and I need to maintain our lifestyle for Lily and Max.""

He looked up, anger flickering amid the shock. ""This would ruin me.""

She nodded, voice steady. ""That's the point I need you to understand, Mark. If we go through with this, the consequences for you... they're devastating. Physically: You'll be away from me, from the kids. A weekend dad, missing bedtime stories, school events, everyday moments. They'll grow up with you as a visitor, not the constant you are now.""

He shifted, hurt flashing.

""Financially,"" she continued, ""you'll be taken to the cleaners. Half your retirement gone—years of saving, poof. Mortgage payments on a house you don't live in. Max child support, alimony that leaves you barely affording rent on your salary after. No buffer for emergencies, no vacations, scraping by while I maintain the home. Louisiana's community laws are equal, but with kids involved, it tilts to protect them—and me as their caregiver.""

Mark's hands trembled on the papers. ""This is extortion.""

""No,"" she said softly but firmly. ""It's reality. And emotionally... God, Mark, this hurts to say, but if we're divorced, I'm free. Free to pursue other romantic interests. Someone else could come into my life. With the kids small and impressionable, and you away most of the time, that person would spend more hours with them than you. Playing catch with Max, helping Lily with homework. If I remarried, he'd be their stepdad—sure, not replacing you legally, but physically closer, forming bonds. God forbid they call him 'Dad' one day, or prefer his presence because he's there. It would be a devastating blow for you, watching from the sidelines.""

Silence stretched, heavy. Mark stared at the floor, absorbing the nightmare she'd painted—logical, lawful, laced with the laws they'd both ignored in happier times.

Finally, Sarah stood. ""Read it all. Think about it. We can talk next week. Until then, nothing changes—I'll keep being the wife, the mom, keeping our home running. For the kids. For us, if you'll let it.""

She left him there, papers in hand, the weight of consequences settling like lead. Upstairs, she closed the bedroom door, allowing herself a single, silent tear. The plan was in motion; now, time would tell if fear could reignite what love had lost.

Mark stormed into the guest room that night, slamming the door with a force that rattled the frames on the walls. The papers—Sarah's counter-petition—were clutched in his fist, crumpled at the edges from his white-knuckled grip. ""How could she?"" he muttered to the empty room, pacing like a caged animal. He wanted amicable—a clean break, joint everything, no bloodbath. But this? This was nuclear. Maximum alimony, his retirement halved, primary custody turning him into a ghost in his own kids' lives. And her words about some other man stepping in, bonding with Lily and Max... it twisted the knife. ""She says she loves me, loves the kids, and then hands me this poison? I'll show her. She thinks she can bully me into staying? Fine, let's see who blinks first.""

Sleep evaded him again, his mind a whirlwind of rage and calculation. By morning, the anger had solidified into resolve. He skipped breakfast, ignoring Sarah's cheerful ""Coffee's ready, hon"" as she bustled with the kids. A quick kiss on Lily's head, a ruffle of Max's hair, and he was out the door, papers in his briefcase.

Day 1: He drove straight to Ms. Harlan's office, his original lawyer. Bursting in without preamble, he slapped the documents on her desk. ""Look at this crap. She's got some shark drafting demands that would bankrupt me. Twenty mandatory counseling sessions? Primary custody? Alimony for years? Tell me we can fight this.""

Harlan adjusted her glasses, scanning the pages. Her face tightened. ""Victoria Kane. I know her reputation. She's a bulldog—specializes in high-stakes divorces, often for women who've been wronged, but she'll flip the script. In Louisiana, this is all within bounds. Community property laws mean 50/50 on marital assets—house, savings, your 401(k). Child support guidelines are formulaic; with your income disparity, maxing it at around $1,500 a month plus health and extras isn't a stretch. Alimony? She can argue need as the lower earner and primary caregiver. Custody favors the status quo for kids' stability. And extending counseling? The state requires one session for parents with minors, but Kane's pushing for 20 to drag it out—judges sometimes buy it for reconciliation efforts.""

Mark leaned forward, desperate. ""So what? We counter hard. Use the adultery—fault grounds to deny alimony.""

Harlan shook her head. ""Adultery speeds filing under Article 103, but for support, it's not an automatic bar unless it directly caused economic harm. Kane'll paint it as a one-time lapse, you as unforgiving. We might slash the alimony duration or amount, negotiate joint physical custody, but her rep precedes her—she wins big more often than not. This could cost you $10-15k in fees alone, and drag for months.""

He left deflated, anger simmering into frustration. That evening, he came home to the smell of roast chicken—Sarah's specialty. She smiled warmly, serving plates, chatting with the kids about their day. ""How was work?"" she asked lightly, no hint of the war brewing.

""Fine,"" he grunted, eating in silence before retreating to the guest room, slamming the door again. Sarah didn't follow, just cleared the table with her usual efficiency.

Day 2: Still fuming, Mark sought second opinions. He visited a firm recommended by his brother—two partners in a polished suite. ""Kane's involved?"" one said, eyebrows raised after reviewing. ""She's notorious. Ruined a colleague of mine last year—guy ended up with supervised visits and half his pension gone. Louisiana's no-fault leans equitable, but with kids, courts protect the primary parent. We could push for 50/50 custody, argue your involvement, but her demands? Mostly achievable. Maybe trim alimony to three years, keep the house joint 'til sale, but expect to pay the mortgage interim.""

No good news. He stormed out, hopelessness creeping in. Financially, even three-quarters of her ask would cripple him: Half his $85k salary gone to support and alimony, leaving him in a crappy apartment, no savings buffer. Physically? Weekends with the kids—missing Max's first soccer goal, Lily's school plays. Emotionally? The thought of another man in his house, reading bedtime stories, earning ""Daddy"" hugs... it gutted him. ""She'd move on, and I'd be the outsider,"" he whispered to his reflection.

Home that night, more dejected. Sarah had baked cookies with the kids; the house smelled like vanilla and warmth. She handed him one with a soft ""Rough day?"" He snatched it, muttered ""Not now,"" and barricaded himself in the guest room, staring at the ceiling, anger yielding to despair.

Day 3: Another lawyer, a solo practitioner with a gruff demeanor. ""Kane? Yeah, she's a man-hater in pinstripes. Her clients walk away with the farm. Your case? Adultery helps on timeline, but not much else. Community property's ironclad—50/50. Child support max is standard. Alimony? With her part-time gig, she'll get it. We fight, maybe reduce to lump sum, but her rep? She'll bury you in motions.""

Same story. Mark drove home pondering: ""Ruined for years. Can't afford college funds, vacations. And the kids... God, some stranger teaching Max to ride a bike? Bonding over ice cream while I'm alone?"" The emotional toll loomed larger than bills—his manhood questioned, dignity stripped.

Sarah remained unchanged: Dinner ready, kids bathed, a gentle ""Goodnight"" as he retreated. Her consistency grated, highlighting what he'd lose.

Days 4-6: A blur of consultations. A high-end firm via a work contact: ""No sugarcoating—Kane's undefeated in similar cases. Slash a few things? Sure, maybe no extended counseling if we argue bad faith, cap alimony at $1,000/month. But primary custody? Likely hers. You'll be financially strapped, emotionally wrecked."" Hopelessness deepened. Each day, Mark returned home slouched, face drawn. Sarah's routines—packing lunches, folding laundry, kissing boo-boos—mocked his turmoil. He'd eat silently, avoid her eyes, slip away to the guest room, where anger festered into self-doubt. ""Am I weak for even considering backing down?""

By day 7, he was a shell. Bags under his eyes, shoulders slumped, the dejection etched in every line. What could he do? Drop the divorce? That messaged weakness: ""Cheat on me, cuckold me in our bed, and I'll just swallow it? She'll lose respect, maybe cheat again—hell, not even hide it. I've lost my balls, my manhood, my dignity."" Continue? Her papers painted a bleak future: Broke, absent, replaced. The physical distance from the kids terrified him—missing their growth, their love shifting. Emotionally, the fear of a stepdad loomed like a specter, more crippling than debt.

That evening, after dinner—spaghetti, Sarah's homemade sauce—he lingered as she tucked the kids in. They sat at the table as planned, the air thick. His face was a portrait of defeat: head hung low, eyes dull, hands fidgeting. He'd decided: Drop it. Financially smart, but the real fear was the rest—losing his family role, his heart shattered anew. He waited for her to gloat, to claim victory.

But Sarah had other plans. She sat across, calm and collected, no triumph in her eyes. Taking a deep breath, she began softly, ""Mark, before anything else, I need to say it again: I'm so, so sorry. For the affair, for the pain I've caused. It was the biggest mistake of my life, and I'll regret it forever. I love you—deeply, truly. The man who makes me laugh, who holds our family together. And our kids... they're my world. I promise, on everything, I'll never repeat that mistake. Never betray you again.""

She paused, watching him. He had nothing to add, head still down, expecting the hammer: ""So, what's your decision? You dropping this?""

Minutes ticked in silence. Then, instead, she slid a small stack across: a handwritten letter and legal documents.

""Read these,"" she said evenly.

Mark unfolded the letter, his hands shaking.

Dear Mark,

I can't express how sorry I am for what I've done. The affair was stupid, selfish, and it broke the trust we built over ten years. I love you more than words can say—you're my partner, my best friend, the father of our beautiful children. Lily and Max deserve us whole, and so do you. If you can find it in your heart to forgive me, to give us a chance, I promise: No more mistakes. I'll go to couples counseling with you—as long as it takes to repair the damage I've caused. We'll rebuild, stronger. But if not... well, read the documents. They're my commitment to you, no matter what.

With all my love, Sarah

He set it down, tears pricking, and opened the documents—a postnuptial agreement, drafted by Kane but slanted his way. It stated: Should Sarah ever commit adultery again, she waived contesting divorce. Terms: Joint legal and physical custody, no child support from either. No alimony claims. His retirement accounts untouched. Community property (including home equity, savings) divided, but Sarah taking only 30% instead of 50%. She'd already signed, notarized that day.

Mark looked up, tears streaming. ""You... you'd give all this up? If it happens again?""

Sarah's eyes welled too. ""Yes. Because I won't let it happen. But this proves I'm serious. Counseling first—let's fix us. For the kids. For what we had.""

The dam broke. Mark sobbed loudly, shoulders heaving, no words—just raw anguish pouring out: the betrayal's sting, the fear, the lost dignity. Sarah cried too, unabashed, tears soaking her shirt, guilt and relief mingling in gasps. They sat there, feet apart, no embrace, just revealing the storm of the last 22 days—anger, guilt, heartbreak—in a cathartic flood. The kitchen echoed with their shared pain, a first step toward whatever came next.",1,1770640843.0,cheating_stories,0,1.0,False

He sighed in frustration and muttered that he needed to take the call. Before leaving, he grabbed my wallet and keys, ensuring I could not escape while he was gone. Then, with determination, he headed for the front door. It closed. I looked up at the prison door, sure there were no bars, but when RPA did, I had become his prisoner, and he was the warden. I knew no one was coming to save me. The familiar roar of the Trans-Am filled the air as he started the engine, pulled out of his parking spot, and sped away, leaving me shaken but alone.

Alone at last, I crawled into the downstairs bathroom, overwhelmed by a wave of nausea that soon overtook me. After vomiting, I ran upstairs, desperate to rid myself of the lingering taste and sensation. I brushed my teeth—once, then again—trying to reclaim a small measure of control and comfort.

In August, a turning point in our relationship unfolded. RPA descended the stairs, a sheet of paper from Western Airlines clutched in his hand. As I glanced at the document after it was placed on the coffee table, it became immediately apparent that it was a flight reservation to Florida. He looked at me with a determined expression and announced that we needed to spend some time apart. However, he made it clear that, during this separation, staying with my family was not an option he would allow.

The situation was further complicated by the involvement of a couple we both knew. March or April  before the sh!t really  hit the fan hard; they approached RPA with a request: they wanted to borrow money to finance their own move to Florida. Without hesitation, RPA agreed and handed them approximately $2,000 to assist with their relocation. On the night the couple arrived to collect the money, all three turned to me as if seeking my approval. I raised my hands, distancing myself from the decision, and stated firmly, “Nope, not getting involved in this.” Despite my reluctance and clear stance against loaning money to friends, RPA proceeded with the transaction.

By the fifteenth of  August, I found myself boarding a plane to Florida. RPA sent me off with a cashier’s check for $1,500. Once the check cleared at the bank, I began using those funds to pay their bills and manage household expenses for the people I was staying with. Additionally, nearly $500 was spent on craft supplies, which, in the end, were left unused and simply accumulated dust on the screened-in patio of their rental home.

While I was away in Florida, my neighbor  aka Jess and her roommate kept me informed about everything occurring back home. It quickly became evident that RPA had turned our house into a revolving door for women. Multiple times, different women were seen leaving my home, making it clear that his behavior was blatant and recurring.

One Sunday afternoon, Jess decided to stop by the house. She later called to recount what she had witnessed: RPA answered the door in nothing but his boxer briefs, and inside was another woman, dressed in only one of his shirts. Jess confronted the situation head-on, making a pointed remark: “Wow, does your wife Jean know about this? With one phone call, she would be back here and this time she would not miss with her bat.” According to Jess, both RPA and the woman turned pale at her words. The tension escalated when, moments later, Jess heard a screaming from our home then women making the statement she had just realized, “You are married!

As the woman hurried out the front door, only partially dressed, RPA had managed to put on a pair of shorts. Jess, unfazed by the chaos, was casually seated on the down of her truck, eating popcorn and watching the dramatic scene unfold. According to Jess, after the woman sped away, her car tires screeching as she left the parking lot, RPA approached Jess with a glare and warned, “You will not tell Jean anything.” Jess, however, simply smiled back at him and replied, “Oh, she knows—and a lot more than you think.”

What RPA failed to realize before sending me to Florida was that he had neglected to take my bank card for our joint account. This single oversight became my means of staying connected to our financial situation, even while separated by distance. From afar, I regularly logged in and examined each transaction, watching as large sums—sometimes thousands of dollars at a time—were withdrawn week after week. The money that disappeared had originated from his father's inheritance, and seeing it dwindle so rapidly left me increasingly anxious. I paid close attention to when our rent and bills were due, double-checking the remaining balance and recalculating our finances with each update. As I tracked the mounting withdrawals, it became painfully clear that the financial security we once relied on was eroding, and my position left me powerless to intervene.

After Jess and her roommate made their presence known, RPA ceased bringing women back to the townhouse, fully aware that they were keeping a close eye on his activities. However, this did not signify a genuine change in his behavior. Instead, I soon observed a clear shift in our financial transactions. Charges from upscale hotels began to surface, with names that were all too familiar to me due to my past work experiences in housekeeping and at the front desk of these establishments.

One such hotel was the DoubleTree, a landmark known for being one of the tallest buildings downtown during the late '80s and early '90s. Its reputation for spacious and expensive suites on the upper floors made the substantial charges on our accounts stand out even more. The transactions from the DoubleTree and other similar hotels made it evident that, although RPA had changed his approach, his actions remained essentially unchanged—he simply shifted the locations of his behavior from our home to high-end hotels.

Separated by more than 1,500 miles, I could do nothing but watch from afar as our bank account dwindled, the balance eventually falling to less than $2,500. In less than a year, nearly all of the money was gone. The days after my birthday in October brought a turning point. RPA called to say he needed to visit a sick female family member in Lubbock, Texas, and would be gone for the weekend of Halloween. When I asked who would look after Missy in his absence, he assured me she would be fine for a couple of days.

 After that phone call, my decision was clear: my sweet Missy needed her mama. Despite the objections and protests from the couple I was staying with, I boarded a Greyhound bus in Florida, determined to return home to Colorado. The journey was long and marked by changing weather. As the bus crossed the Mississippi River, heavy rain gave way to sleet, and by the time we entered Texas, snow had begun to fall. A couple of hours’ delay in New Mexico slowed our progress, but as we finally crossed into Colorado, I gazed out the window, recognizing places from my childhood. We stopped briefly in Pueblo, Colorado—a fifteen-minute drop-off that signaled I was almost home.

As my journey home neared its end, I decided to act and confirm my suspicions. First, I called Jess to ask if she had seen any activity at the townhouse and whether RPA was there. Jess assured me that he was indeed at home and mentioned that a strange car had been parked in the visitor spot for several days, only adding to my growing unease. I thanked her for keeping an eye on things, then, doing my best to remain composed, I dialed the house number from a pay phone.

RPA answered on the second ring with a casual ""hello."" In the background, I heard a woman's voice say, ""Babe, who is that?"" My heart pounded as I hesitated before finally speaking. With as much calm as I could muster, I told him, ""That woman needs to be gone because I am only an hour away, and you'd better pick me up at the bus station.""

RPA sounded stunned, replying, ""You’re joking."" Instead of answering, I pulled the phone away from my ear, letting the sounds of idling Greyhound buses roar through the receiver so he would realize where I was. Suddenly, I heard him yell, ""Shit!"" and the line filled with frantic he forgot to hang up the phone commotion  on the other end as he warned the woman in the house, ""You need to leave now because my wife has a bad temper."" The un-know women screaming “ you are married,” then the line went dead, I smiled other small victory for me. An hour later, the bus pulled into the downtown terminal. There was RPA leading the Trans-Am as I climbed down; he looked like a child who had been caught with his hand in the cookie jar. I am haunted by that memory and doubts. He had insisted that it was a movie in the background, but I knew better—I could see through the lie. All I wanted was to avoid sleeping on those sheets, knowing they had been used by others with questionable intentions and filthy habits. I looked up at RPA and twisted, smiled, and called all of them “nasty, rotten crotches,"" having been there filled me with disgust and dread. RPA turned paler. I just smiled and told myself, “Got you, sick fucker.”

Later that night, we drove together to the Walmart near our house. The car ride was heavy with silence—I couldn’t bring myself to speak to him, my thoughts swirling with anger and suspicion. I kept my face pressed against the window, watching the glow of the streetlights stretch and blur past as we made our way down the main drag.

At the store, I picked out new sheets, pillows, a mattress pad, and a can of Lysol. The idea of sleeping on anything that those women had used made my skin crawl. I couldn’t stop thinking about head lice, bed bugs, or whatever else an unwashed body might have left behind. I wanted to reclaim at least a sense of cleanliness and control, so I made sure to get everything I needed to make the bed entirely new.

Once we got home, the unmistakable scent of strong, cheap perfume hit me as soon as I walked in the door. The smell clung to everything, a stark reminder of what had happened. Clutching Missy in one of my arms, I grabbed my trusty bat from the closet and began to check the house, starting downstairs. After making sure everything was clear, I headed upstairs, first stopping to look in the room with the computer and all his models, then into the bathroom.

Finally, I entered the bedroom. As expected, the waterbed had been stripped, and in the corner was a pile of sheets, pillows, and the mattress pad—ripped, as if it had been torn off in a hurry. The scent of cheap perfume was overpowering, saturating the discarded bedding. I glanced at RPA with a dark, pointed smile and remarked, “That must have been a bitch, because you ripped the mattress pad.”

After wiping down the waterbed mattress, I finished making the bed with my new mattress pad, sheets, and pillows. I took a long shower, hoping to wash away the lingering sense of contamination and unease. Settling in with a book, I tried to find comfort and reclaim the bedroom as my own space, free from the memories and suspicions that haunted me.

Later that evening, RPA came upstairs. He lay his head on my lap and tried to snuggle close, his tone soft and reassuring. “Honey, nothing happened, I swear,” he insisted. But I could see through the act. I was too exhausted to argue, so I told him I was tired and turned away, focusing on getting some rest and distancing myself emotionally.

From that moment forward, everything changed inside me. I no longer felt like the same person who had endured doubt and uncertainty—I began to transform into someone stronger, more resolute, and unwilling to be ignored or deceived any longer. My resolve hardened, and I felt a force within me determined to confront the truth, no matter how painful.

About a week later, RPA left for his trip back to Texas. During his time away, the truth behind his web of deception finally began to come undone. As soon as I watched him drive out of the parking lot, the house phone rang—his mother was calling. Sensing an opportunity, I asked her directly about the relative in Lubbock that RPA claimed was gravely ill. Her response was weary and honest: “Sweetheart, we don’t have any family in Lubbock.” In that moment, every last shred of RPA’s story collapsed, revealing just how far his dishonesty had gone.

After I hung up with Mrs. A, I hurried upstairs. RPA had carelessly left behind a stack of printed emails—correspondence between himself and a woman from Missouri, as well as someone in Lubbock. As I read through the messages, I learned they had been making plans to spend a romantic Halloween weekend together. Each new discovery fueled my anger and heartbreak, and the storm within me grew stronger. I also noticed two separate phone numbers from two different states attached to those emails, which only confirmed the complexity of RPA’s lies.

Determined to uncover the whole truth, I went to the computer and looked up the area codes for the phone numbers. Then, I walked to Walgreens, where I knew there was a pay phone. By the time I arrived, dusk was settling in, and the air had grown cold, but the fire inside me kept me moving. I dialed the first number, which was in Missouri, since he was in Texas. A man answered, and I introduced myself, explaining that our spouses were cheating on us with each other. He responded with a heartbreaking sigh, then asked if I was certain. I described what I had found in the emails about their plans to meet in Texas, and I told him that the messages were intimate in nature.

When he asked if I could read some of the emails to him, I refused, explaining that I was in a public place and didn’t want anyone to overhear our conversation. He let out another sigh and then requested that I send him copies of the emails instead. Agreeing to his request, I wrote down his address and prepared a thick tan envelope containing the correspondence. The next day, I went to the post office, handed the package to the clerk, and paid nearly two dollars in stamps to send it off to Missouri. As I let the envelope go, a grim sense of satisfaction washed over me—I thought to myself, “mess with a bull, you get the horns.”

Before I made it home, my pager started vibrating insistently in the front pocket of my jeans. The display showed “RPA 911” followed by his number. I glanced at the small, blue-green, clear device in my hand, smirked, and spoke softly into the air, “Let RPA know how dead air feels.”

As I stepped into our townhouse, the house phone was ringing nonstop. Checking the Caller ID, I saw it was the number of the other woman in Texas. Without hesitation, I unplugged the phone from the wall, then went upstairs and did the same with the phone there. Finally, I sank down onto the couch and took a long, deep breath—it felt like I could breathe again.

I turned on the TV for background noise, and soon after, Jess knocked on the glass screen door. I told her to come in, and she sat down beside me on the couch. She shook her head in disbelief and finally asked, “What did you do?” I explained everything to her. She shook her head again and said, “Man, you are cold.” I just gave her a warm smile and thanked her, especially for all her help. Later, Jess, her roommates, and I decided to unwind with some drinks at the Cowboys’ Halloween party in a couple of days. But the next day Jess came over and told me RPA was blowing their house phone because ours would just ring also. By this point, I placed my pager tin he towel closet upstairs so I could not hear it.

After some time, I decided to plug the house phone back in. As soon as the front door closed, Jess was headed back to her place, and the phone rang almost immediately. Glancing at the Caller ID, I saw it was the same number from before. I let it ring twice before answering, and it was RPA on the line. In the background, I could hear a woman sobbing uncontrollably. It seemed her husband had called her to confront her about the affair, and she was pleading with me not to send the emails, explaining that she and her husband had a prenuptial agreement. RPA was also begging me not to send them. I assured them I hadn’t sent anything, though in truth, that was a lie.

Before ending the call, I disconnected the phone from the wall again and told RPA to enjoy his weekend, because I intended to enjoy mine. That Halloween night would become the best I’d had since turning twenty-one. Before heading to the club, I stopped at the liquor store and picked up a couple of packs of Zima. During my period of exile, thanks to my own husband, I’d learned that I could drink Zima with minimal side effects, so I enjoyed a few drinks and danced in the clothes I chose for myself—not those RPA wanted me to wear.

Everyone at the party ended up pretty everyone was trashed, except for me. I was sober enough to drive us all back in the car that RPA’s dad had left him, even though I probably shouldn’t have been behind the wheel. That night, I discovered that I actually drove better with a standard transmission after a few drinks in me, and since I knew every back road, I got everyone home safely. The only trouble was parking—I couldn’t find a spot in the lot, so I left the car in a space on Yuma. I got plenty of grief for my parking job, and as I reached my door, I could hear my friends singing off-key about my parking skills, making fun of me as I laughed along.

After closing the front door behind me, I grabbed another bottle of clear liquor, letting the alcohol help wash away the tension that still lingered from the evening’s events. The more I drank, the less the stress weighed on me—it was the best release I’d felt in a long time. Time slipped away unnoticed, and before I realized it, the first hints of dawn were creeping in. I glanced over at the coffee table, now crowded with empty bottles, evidence of my desperate attempt to quiet my mind. When I tried to shake my head, I could still feel the buzz humming through my body. Somehow, I managed to get myself ready for bed and climbed beneath the covers, Missy curling up peacefully in my arms. I drifted into a deep, heavy sleep.

I have no idea how long I slept before I was startled awake by the unmistakable roar of the Trans-Am pulling into the parking lot. Sitting up, I stared at the closet doors, a chill settling over me as I realized my feelings had turned cold toward the man driving that car. I laid back down, listening intently as RPA opened the front door, he must have noticed all the empty bottles scattered across the coffee table. I heard him climbing the stairs, two steps at a time. As he approached, I reached up and switched on the light above my head, mounted on the waterbed  headboard. From the doorway, RPA’s voice cut through the silence, “You’ve changed.” I looked over at him and, with a wicked smile, replied, “Whose fault would that be, hmm? Go look in the damn mirror. To see who cause this change.

That afternoon, after I drifted back to sleep, I woke to the sound of him cleaning out the room. He gathered bags of papers threw way in dumpster outside, seemingly unaware that they were destined for a broken man. When can back in the bedroom then he just glanced at me like ha-ha you not have the evidence anymore, I met his gaze with a calm smile. My composure must have unnerved him, but I felt nothing but a cold acceptance about everything that had transpired.

By November 4^(th), things took a deadly turn. He was upstairs in that room when I heard his pager buzzing again. Suddenly, he rushed downstairs and looked at me where I sat quietly on the couch watching TV. ""I have to take this,"" he said. RPA approached and tried to kiss my cheek, but I placed my hand over his mouth, refusing the gesture. He left.

Within five minutes of leaving, he returned—the roar of the car tires screeching into the parking lot still echoing in the air. My instincts told me to hide, but I was finished playing nice. Bursting through the front door, RPA was so furious that he nearly broke it. His entire body trembled with pure, unfiltered rage as he glared at me. ""You lied,"" he snarled. I looked him in the eyes and simply asked, ""About what? “You mail those emails,"" he spat out.

I didn’t deny it. I smiled and replied, ""Yes, I did. Not to her, but to her husband—because his wife couldn’t keep her legs closed and chose to cheat with another man. Actions have consequences.""

With that, RPA roughly shoved the coffee table aside and yanked me up to my feet. He snarled again, his words laced with accusation: ""He hit her and is filing for divorce on the grounds of adultery.""

I looked up at RPA and, unable to hold back my contempt, started laughing at him. I said, “Good,” letting my anger show. In response, he threw me to the floor, calling me a cruel, heartless bitch. Looking up at him, I told him plainly, “You made me this way.” I managed to stand and tried to escape, heading upstairs to put some distance between us.

Suddenly, I heard Jean—he was sitting on the couch, holding the Glock. The gun was pointed at me once again. Reacting instinctively, I dropped to the floor behind the stairs, making sure there was something to shield me from the weapon. Everything felt like it was happening in slow motion as RPA fired a hollow-point round in my direction. For years after, I could still recall the smell of cordite, the sound of ringing in my ear, and the heat of the bullet as it embedded itself in the wall. If it had traveled just a few more inches, it would have lodged in my left shoulder.

The shock from RPA’s actions was written plainly across his face, his complexion drained to white as he stared at both the gun and me. Seizing the opportunity, I scrambled upstairs, locking myself in the bathroom and climbing into the tub, desperate for any sense of safety and a moment to gather my thoughts.

1r033y8,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/1r033y8/part_three_of_my_story/,part three of my story,"Word about RPA being married to me spread quickly, and it wasn’t long before my reputation preceded me. Apparently, the story of how I handled things with the bat traveled fast—so much so that, according to what I heard, the doorman at that particular strip club actually kept a picture of me by the entrance. It was as if they thought I might storm in at any moment, though, truthfully, I had no intention of ever setting foot in a place like that.

The confrontation with RPA and his companion at our home did not remain a private incident—it quickly sent shockwaves through RPA's social circle, especially among his friends and the staff at the local strip clubs. News of my actions spread rapidly, and soon, my name became synonymous with the story of how I stood my ground that night. Even the employees at the club seemed to be on alert, behaving as if they expected me to storm in at any moment. Despite the rumors and the newly acquired reputation, I was resolute in my decision to avoid any place tied to RPA’s betrayals.

The notoriety that followed was never something I sought out. Instead, it became an unintentional but powerful reminder—to myself and to others—of just how far I was willing to go to protect my dignity and assert my personal boundaries. The story, now a part of local lore, underscored the seriousness of my resolve and the lengths I would take to defend what mine was.

Only a few days had passed since the explosive events at our home when RPA made the choice to return to the same strip club. He seemed determined to act as though nothing had changed, clinging to a sense of normalcy despite everything that had happened. Yet his efforts were quickly thwarted. Less than an hour after leaving, he stormed back into our house, his anger palpable and his voice echoing through the rooms as he hurled accusations at me. He shouted that I had ruined his night, making it clear that he held me responsible for his misfortune. The reason for his fury became apparent: he had been banned from the club, a direct consequence of the reputation I had earned after the confrontation. As he ranted and blamed me for the situation, I met his glare with a calm, knowing smile and simply held his gaze. Inwardly, I recognized that sometimes, life has a way of balancing the scales, delivering its own form of justice whether or not we seek it.

 After RPA began sleeping on the floor in that room, a new and unsettling routine emerged: the phone calls. Jess, ever resourceful and supportive, showed me how to listen in on these conversations. It didn’t take long before we found ourselves staring down a staggering $500 a month phone bills, the result of RPA’s endless hours spent calling women across the country.

These weren’t just casual conversations. Time and again, I overheard him engaging in explicit phone sex—sometimes with the speakerphone on, forcing me to hear every word against my will. The experience was so disturbing that I found myself wishing I could wash my ears out with bleach, desperate to erase what I’d just heard.

One night, Jess and I sat together, listening to yet another call. To my shock and horror, I realized that RPA was speaking with girls who were clearly underage—one admitted to being sixteen, the other just fifteen. Their conversation quickly turned to plans for the girls to come to our home and meet RPA in person. Unable to remain silent, I snatched the phone and put an immediate stop to the situation. I made my position clear: “Oh hell, no. I will not have jailbait in my house. The minute you set foot on my doorstep, the cops will be called, and you’ll be sent back to your parents.”

The fallout from intercepting that troubling phone call was immediate. RPA charged down the stairs, his face contorted with fury, hurling insults and calling me a crazy bitch. Rather than backing down, I met his anger with a calm, defiant smile. “Oops, did I mess that up for you? My bad,” I quipped, refusing to let his rage intimidate me. The tension in the air was punctuated by Jess, who couldn’t help but burst into laughter—so much that she nearly fell out of her chair. RPA, caught off guard and realizing that Jess had witnessed everything, was left speechless. I seized the small victory, bowing dramatically to Jess and blowing a kiss in RPA’s direction—a symbolic gesture of triumph amid the chaos that had unfolded.

A few days later, Jess and I sat together at the dining room table, the silence between us heavy with the aftermath of everything that had recently transpired. She quietly observed me, noticing the tension in my posture as I gripped my glass of soda with both hands. I felt the urge to reach for something stronger to numb the relentless stress, but my medical condition made that impossible now. The risks of alcohol mixing with my medication were too great, so I held on to my resolve, choosing my health over momentary relief.

My mind drifted to the earlier chapters of my life, when coping with hardship often meant seeking refuge in self-destructive habits. In those days, I turned to underage drinking, hoping the numbness would dull the pain that weighed on me. With a large glass of Jack Daniels became my escape whenever I could afford it, while Jim Beam served as a cheaper substitute when money was tight. On the most difficult nights, when there seemed to be no other options, even Mad Dog 20/20 was enough to quiet the turmoil inside.

Yet, as time passed, I came to understand the consequences of those choices. The relief was temporary, and the spiral of self-medicating only compounded the struggle, especially as new health challenges emerged. It was a lesson learned the hard way—that turning to alcohol provided no real solution and inevitably made things worse. Now, faced with the pressures and stress that still arise, I am determined to prioritize my well-being above all else. No matter how strong the urge to escape may be, I choose to protect my health and resist the temptation to fall back into old patterns.

Sensing my unease, Jess leaned in with a look of concern and quietly asked what was troubling me. I exhaled slowly, the weight of exhaustion heavy in my chest, and finally found the words to express what I had been holding inside. “I’m just tired,” I confessed, my voice barely rising above a whisper. I tried to explain the strange comfort that used to come with certainty, no matter how painful the reality. “At least with a beating, I knew when the hit was coming.” My gaze drifted around the room as I gestured helplessly, attempting to capture the overwhelming sense of dread that now permeated my days. “But this—” I said, letting my hand fall to my lap. “This is so much worse.” The unpredictability, the constant anxiety, and the fear of what might happen next felt far more unbearable than any physical pain I had endured before. The uncertainty gnawed at me, leaving me feeling more vulnerable and exposed than ever.

 As Jess and I sat together at the table, I finally found the courage to voice the fear that had been consuming me for days. My hands trembled as I wrapped them around my glass, searching for words that felt nearly impossible to say aloud. With my voice barely above a whisper, I confessed, “I’m terrified to get close to my husband.” The admission made my vulnerability feel raw and exposed, the weight of recent events pressing heavily on my shoulders.

The anxiety gnawing at me was relentless. After everything RPA had done, the betrayals, the secrecy, and the countless nights spent wondering where he truly was, I found myself plagued by an overwhelming sense of dread. The fear that he might have brought home an STD haunted me constantly. It was a possibility I had never anticipated, a consequence I neither asked for nor deserved. The idea of facing such a risk, not because of anything I had done, but solely because of his choices, filled me with a profound sense of injustice and fear. Because of this, I refused to let him touch me at all, determined to protect myself in whatever way I could.

Unable to meet Jess’s eyes, I lowered my gaze, my words faltering. “I know he’s been sleeping with those strippers,” I admitted, each syllable heavy with resignation. Saying it aloud made the reality all the more undeniable. The trust I once had in my marriage had been shattered, replaced by uncertainty and the constant worry of what else might be waiting for me as a result of his actions.

Jess reached across the table and squeezed my hand, offering a small measure of comfort during a moment of vulnerability. Sensing my distress, she attempted to reassure me, her tone gentle as she asked if I was truly certain about what RPA had done. Unable to find the words, I simply raised an eyebrow in response—my silence speaking volumes about what I already knew.

“A man who comes home with his clothes, his skin, everything covered in body glitter and reeking of cheap body spray—there’s only one explanation, Jess. Only one,” I told her, my voice steady despite everything. Jess didn’t argue with me; the understanding in her eyes was clear. She nodded softly and replied with a quiet, “Oh,” acknowledging the painful truth without judgment.

I let out a long sigh, exhaustion washing over me. The truth could no longer be denied. “It all makes sense,” I confessed, the realization settling heavily in my chest. “He leaves the house with at least seven hundred dollars in his wallet and comes home with a hundred and fifty—or less. I know exactly where all that money is going—straight to some woman in stripper heels and a thong.” As the words left my mouth, they seemed to linger in the stillness, the painful reality impossible to ignore. The gap between what I wanted to believe and what I knew had grown too wide to bridge.

That afternoon, a heavy tension settled over the house, almost as if it had taken on a physical form. Suddenly, the sharp bang of the bedroom door slamming shut upstairs echoed through the rooms, a clear signal that trouble was brewing. Not long after, RPA appeared at the bottom of the stairs, his movements sluggish and his look disheveled. He was still wearing his red sweatpants, the ones with ""USMC"" spray-painted in bold, longhand letters down one leg. The fact that he looked as though he had just rolled out of bed—even though it was well past one in the afternoon—made the atmosphere feel even heavier, his disheveled presence adding to the unease that already gripped the house.

RPA’s eyes darted to Jess before settling back on me, signaling that he wanted to speak with me in private. Sensing the tension in the room, Jess responded with quiet understanding. She stood up gently, her movements soft and deliberate, and as she passed, she laid a comforting hand on my shoulder. Leaning in, she whispered for me to call her later—a subtle but meaningful gesture of support. I managed only a nod; my attention locked on the sky-blue placemats spread across the dining room table. My heart raced as I braced myself for whatever was about to come.

Anxiety rose up inside me, tightening my chest with familiar dread as I silently hoped RPA wouldn’t lash out at my face or head. Even as I kept my gaze lowered, I was intensely aware of how close he stood. From the corner of my eye, I tracked his hand as it paused near my head. Slowly, he reached out—not with aggression, but with an unexpected gentleness—and turned my face toward him. Despite his touch, my wary eyes stayed fixed on the off-white carpet beneath the dining room table, conditioned by past experience to avoid making eye contact.

RPA spoke in a soft tone that was unusual for him: “Jean, look at me.” For a brief moment, I glanced up and met his hazel eyes. In that instant, I thought I saw remorse flicker across his face—a rare and fleeting vulnerability. But just as quickly as it appeared, the remorse vanished, replaced by the familiar flash of anger that immediately put me back on edge.

In an instant, RPA's demeanor shifted from defensive to hostile. He snarled at me, making it clear that how he spent his money was none of my concern. He asserted his authority by reminding me that I was his possession, reducing our relationship to the symbolism of the ring on my finger. The message was unmistakable: I had no say in the matter. Then, as if to drive the point home, he forcefully pushed me out of my chair and walked away, leaving me shaken and vulnerable on the floor.

That night marked a turning point. Fearful of what might happen next, I stopped sleeping in our bedroom. Instead, I moved downstairs to the couch, always keeping a bat within arm’s reach—either tucked under the couch or resting on our green coffee table. Sleep became elusive; I remained vigilant, never fully letting my guard down. If I heard RPA coming downstairs, I would quickly escape to the bathroom and lock the door, waiting until he returned upstairs before emerging.

By the fourth day, the relentless anxiety and lack of rest finally caught up with me, and exhaustion overcame my defenses. I drifted into a deep sleep, only to wake the next morning in our bed with RPA’s arms wrapped tightly around me. He apologized, his voice soft as he said, “Hon, I’m so sorry I scared you. I love you so much.” Despite his words, I could only make myself go stiff, turning to look at my side of the bed. I wished for a normal mattress instead of the waterbed mattress with high frame and its dark red bumper pads, and longed to slip free from his iron grip, desperate for distance and safety.

The fragile peace between us lasted only about a month. During that time, I found myself having to accompany RPA everywhere he went, even when I desperately wanted to be alone. On one particular day, as we drove down the road in his Trans-Am, he reached across the center console, took my hand in his, and pressed a kiss to the back of it. As he did, he whispered that he loved me. He explained that his cold, distant exterior came from his experiences in the USMC, as if that justified everything.

That day, I learned the real reason he wanted me with him. We drove down I-25 and pulled into the parking lot near PetSmart, where a new store had just opened—a gun store. When we parked, I turned to look at him, searching his face for any hint of his intentions. RPA just smiled and said, “Come on, sweetheart, we need a few of them in the house. You know I’m from Texas—it’s good to have a couple around.” The only thought running through my mind was that we lived in the middle of Colorado Springs, Colorado, a city with plenty of police and, undoubtedly, plenty of guns already.

He took my hand and held the door open for me as we walked inside. RPA picked out a shotgun first, then led me over to where the handguns were displayed. Standing there, a chill ran through me—despite it being a warm June day, it felt as if I were standing on the side of Pikes Peak, buried in an eight-foot snowdrift wearing nothing but a bikini and socks. The sensation was so strong it was as if a rabbit had just run over my grave.

After browsing for a while, RPA selected a 9mm Glock. I can still picture that gun: black, with a hint of dark blue shining under the store lights. As the clerk worked on the paperwork, a sense of dread settled over me. My first thought was, “F@ck, I’m going to die.” When the salesclerk finally placed the Glock back in its box, I looked up and caught his eye. In that glance, I saw everything—an unspoken apology, a silent acknowledgment of my fear.

In the days following our unsettling trip to the gun store, I found myself unable to recover emotionally. The tension lingered, never giving me a moment to breathe. Within a week, RPA had disappeared again. There was more that strip club in Colorado Springs at the time, and since RPA was banned from one, I asked Jess to follow him. She called me from a pay phone and confirmed my suspicions—RPA was at another club, this one closer to Fort Carson.

Hearing the familiar roar of the Trans-Am as it pulled into our parking lot sent my nerves into overdrive. I couldn’t take it anymore. I moved quickly to the bottom of the stairs and opened the front door just as RPA entered through the glass screen door. He looked at me with a strange expression, then sat down heavily on the couch. Without warning, he turned to me and demanded, “What the f@ck is your problem now?”

The tension in the house had reached a breaking point. The Glock, no longer hidden away in the downstairs closet, now sat out in the open on the coffee table, its presence impossible to ignore and deeply unsettling. I felt utterly depleted; every ounce of energy drained from my body. And  I sat down in the middle of the staircase with a heavy weight, the weight of everything pressing down on my shoulders. Slowly, I gripped two of the staircase posts, more for emotional support than physical stability, and took a shaky breath and looked at RPA throw the wooden vertical spindles of the staircase. My voice came out small and tired as I finally spoke: “I’m tired, R,” I said quietly. “I can’t do this anymore. In the morning, please drop me off at the homeless shelter. You win.”

RPA remained seated on the couch, his gaze fixed on me with an intensity that was both unsettling and unyielding. It was as if my words had landed a physical blow—his face drained of color, the shock evident in his features. That pale expression quickly shifted, and his complexion transformed, flushed with pure, unmistakable rage. In a chilling response to the emotional confrontation, RPA reached over and picked up the Glock, his actions underscoring the volatility of the moment. RPA's demeanor shifted abruptly as he pointed the gun at me, his eyes narrowed with anger. His voice was sharp and accusatory as he snarled, “What the f@ck did you say to me?” The sudden outburst shattered whatever fragile calm had existed, amplifying the tension in the room. The intensity of his reaction left me feeling cornered and vulnerable, uncertain of what might happen next.

RPA fixed me with a hard stare and declared, “You are mine.” The words echoed with chilling finality, reinforcing the sense of ownership he held over me. I remained rooted to the spot, paralyzed by fear, convinced that any movement—no matter how slight—could have provoked RPA to unpredictable violence. The possibility that he might shoot me, perhaps even just for his own twisted amusement, kept me utterly still. In that moment, the threat was palpable, and my only instinct was to avoid drawing his attention further.

The tense standoff between us was finally interrupted when RPA let out a chilling, evil laugh. He locked eyes with me, his expression filled with menace, and made it explicitly clear that I would not be allowed to leave him—at least, not until he decided it was acceptable. His words were firm and controlling, reinforcing the sense of entrapment that had come to define our relationship. In that moment, any hope I had of escaping was crushed under the weight of his authority and the unmistakable message that my freedom depended solely on his permission.

As the shock wore off overwhelmed by terror, I rushed upstairs and immediately locked the bedroom door. Determined to create a barrier between myself and any potential threat, I barricaded both entrances: one that led to the bathroom and the other to the upstairs landing of our townhouse. The only time I dared to unlock either door was when Missy, my cat, meowed insistently to come inside. I opened the door , I let her in, grateful for the comfort of her company. I slept on the floor, positioning of the waterbed between myself and the barricaded doors, hoping it would offer some sense of protection.

That night, sleep eluded me entirely. Paralyzed by fear, I lay on the floor next to Missy, my heart pounding with every sound that echoed through the house. Each creak and footstep sent my thoughts racing, convinced that RPA was coming upstairs to continue what he had begun earlier that evening. The anxiety was relentless, and I remained on high alert, unable to let my guard down for even a moment.

The next morning, I moved through the house with extreme caution, each step down the stairs feeling as if I were walking on eggshells. My only goal was to avoid waking RPA, who was passed out on the couch. With every careful movement, my mind churned with escape plans—desperately searching for a way out of the townhouse and onto a bus that would take me downtown to the homeless shelter. Each obstacle intensified my anxiety: I realized I needed money for the fare, but using my bank card was out of the question. RPA could easily track any transaction, and the bus stop across from our bank provided a direct route downtown, raising the risk of being seen or intercepted. I mentally mapped out possible hiding places if things went wrong, and though the thought of calling my sister for help crossed my mind, the overwhelming anxiety made that option seem impossible.

My wallet—a small, black and silver lifeline—sat just a few feet away from me. Reaching it felt as daunting as crossing a deep ravine without a bridge. I crept quietly across the living room, inching toward the wallet and the hope of freedom it symbolized. Halfway there, I stopped and glanced back, needing to be sure RPA was still asleep. But I was horribly mistaken. His hazel eyes were open, watching me. In that instant, my hope vanished. The wallet, my only means of escape, now seemed impossibly out of reach. Before I could react, RPA rose from the couch.

He closed the distance between us in three long strides, his imposing presence magnified by the physical disparity between us. Standing at just 5'5"", I was completely overshadowed by his six-foot frame and solid build. The difference in our sizes was undeniable, and as he towered over me, the reality of my situation became unmistakably clear—I was utterly trapped.

The memory of that moment still lingers painfully, a dull throb pulsing at the back of my head each time I recall it. I remember the exact instant RPA woke up; there was no warning before he was upon me. In one swift, overpowering movement, he pinned me tightly against the closed downstairs bathroom door. His hand—so much larger than mine—easily seized both of my wrists, forcing my arms above my head and holding them there with an iron grip. The weight of his body pressed into me, rendering any attempt at escape impossible. Leaning down so that his mouth was close to my ear, RPA whispered in a cold, mocking tone, “Where are you going, sweetheart?” The menace behind his words was unmistakable, and the sense of helplessness in that moment remains vivid and raw.

With his free hand, RPA slid his fingers up my shirt, rubbing my chest as he whispered in a low purr, “Come, love. I have missed you so much. I just want to make love to you again and prove that my love for you is real.” His touch was invasive, and his words rang hollow given the tension and fear that filled the house.

RPA stopped rubbing my chest and then gripped my chin to make sure I was looking up at him, his smile turning wicked. He demanded a kiss, insisting that we forget the last few months, declaring, “You are my life.” Ignoring my resistance, he forced me into a kiss—not a gentle RPA stopped rubbing my chest and then gripped my chin to make sure I was looking up at him, his smile turning wicked. He demanded a kiss, insisting that we forget the last few months, declaring, “You are my l.” Ignoring my resistance, he forced me into a kiss—not a gentle gesture, but a harsh act. He refused a kiss on the cheek, instead forcing my mouth open and pressing his lips to mine in a French kiss I did not want.

Instinct took over as I tried to defend myself, aiming my knee toward RPA's groin in a desperate attempt to break free. But he was quick; he anticipated my move and blocked it by positioning his own knee between my legs. My effort at resistance failed, heightening my sense of helplessness and leaving me feeling even more powerless in the moment.

As the tension mounted, it was as if my silent plea for rescue was answered by the sharp beeping of RPA's pager echoing from the coffee table. The interruption was sudden, providing a brief window of relief. RPA released his grip, and I slid down against the door, my body trembling from both exhaustion and the overwhelming sense of relief.

RPA walked over to the coffee table, picked up the pager, and studied the number displayed. He sighed in frustration and muttered that he needed to take the call. Before leaving, he grabbed my wallet and keys, ensuring I could not escape while he was gone. Then, with determination, he headed for the front door. The familiar roar of the Trans-Am filled the air as he started the engine, pulled out of his parking spot, and sped away, leaving me shaken but alone.

Alone at last, I crawled into the downstairs bathroom, overwhelmed by a wave of nausea that soon overtook me. After vomiting, I ran upstairs, desperate to rid myself of the lingering taste and sensation. I brushed my teeth—once, then again—trying to reclaim a small measure of control and comfort.

 When RPA returned, his demeanor had completely changed—he was pale and visibly shaken. He sat down heavily on our worn-out couch, clearly struggling to process what he had just learned. With a trembling voice, he explained that the note was from his mother, who had managed to locate him by using information from my previous job. During their conversation, she told him that his father had passed away and that she was already on her way to see him.

Mrs. A turned to RPA and, with genuine concern, asked why he hadn’t called to let his family know that he had gotten remarried. I was already aware that RPA had been married twice before me, so her question did not surprise me. Then, she asked when we had gotten married, and I told her it was in December of the previous year. Mrs. A smiled warmly at me and welcomed me into the family, her kindness leaving a lasting impression.

During our conversation, Mrs. A mentioned she wanted to set up a trust for RPA’s son. Sitting on the couch, I was taken aback; it became clear that she was unaware of her grandson’s fate. I turned to RPA and asked him if his mother truly did not know. Mrs. A looked at both of us, confusion evident in her expression. RPA then quietly told his mother that his only child had died, explaining that this tragedy was due to the poor choices of his first ex-wife.

 

Mrs. A’s reaction to the devastating news was immediate and profound. Her face turned ghostly pale, and if RPA and his brother had not been present, she might have collapsed right there in our living room. Recognizing her distress, I hurried into the kitchen and fetched her a glass of cold water, hoping it might help her steady. As the initial shock began to fade and the reality of her only grandchild’s death settled in, Mrs. A’s gaze fell upon a gold, well-worn picture frame sitting nearby. The frame held a cherished photograph of RPA’s son, illuminated by the soft glow of a blue candle. In my family, lighting a candle is a tradition that honors a child lost to death—a quiet act of remembrance.

Mrs. A turned to me, her voice trembling, and asked if the candle meant what she feared. I found myself unable to speak, so I simply nodded. Understanding washed over her as she gently picked up the picture, her hands shaking. She turned to RPA and, with heartbreak in her voice, asked why he had never called to tell her, or if he had ever informed his father. RPA quietly apologized and told his mother that he had never told his father either.

As 1997 approached, I found myself dreading the holidays. I never celebrated Christmas at the time, as it brought up other traumas from my childhood. When New Year’s Day arrived, it marked the beginning of subtle but significant changes in RPA’s behavior. The cracks in his carefully maintained mask became more apparent, especially after he received his settlements from his father’s estate.

When the weather permitted, RPA, long with his family we drove up to the land his father had owned near the Four Corners. This visit turned out to be both the first and last time I met my father-in-law. I helped scatter Mr. A’s ashes on the land, and as I walked back toward our cars, my eyes caught sight of animal bones—bleached white by the sun, stark against the cold and dark landscape. That image should have been a warning of what was to come.

Once all the checks from the estate cleared, I began to notice real changes in RPA. At that time, I was still working at Walmart but had been put on swing shifts. That’s when one of my “ghosts” from the past reappeared. I was joking around with my friend Jess in the store on Ash Wednesday, she couldn’t respond, something hit me so hard that it felt like my brain wanted to leap out of my skull and run a marathon around the store. It was then that I learned, because of that ghost from my past used my head as a hammer against the floor more than once years earlier, I had sustained brain damage. That day, I experienced my very first epileptic seizure, a challenge that would stay with me until this day.

Losing my job at Walmart marked a difficult turning point, especially as my doctors were still struggling to find the right medication for my condition. It was during this period of uncertainty that RPA’s true character began to emerge.

Once his settlement checks were cleared, RPA suddenly had nearly $250,000 at his disposal. Instead of using the money sensibly, he indulged himself with extravagant purchases. The first was a 1980’s Burgundy Trans-Am, complete with a gold Firebird emblazoned on the hood a turbo engine under the hood—a detail I remember vividly, the car’s driver’s side paint had rust near the back tire frame, a result of the harsh winter road salts in Colorado.

RPA’s spending did not end with the purchase of the car; he soon acquired a new computer as well. While I struggled to adjust to my health challenges and sought ways to cope, RPA retreated upstairs for hours at a time, painting his models and immersing himself in cybersex chat rooms with countless women. You may wonder how I discovered this. My curiosity eventually got the better of me one afternoon, and I sat down to read through some of the chat exchanges. What I found left me feeling deeply unsettled.

I went through those messages after RPA had left the house to purchase another model. Shortly afterward, I heard the distinct sound of his car returning to the parking lot. By that time, we were living in a townhouse on Yuma Street, a place I had chosen because it was still within my budget. I listened as the front door opened and closed, and heard him coming up the stairs toward me.

I sat in silence, unable to find the words to express what I felt as I stared at the computer screen and then at RPA. With tears streaming down my face, I finally managed to ask him one question: ""Why?"" RPA glanced at the computer, then at me, and his anger flared. He grabbed my arm, pulled me out of the chair, and snarled that I should mind my own business. Without another word, he shoved me out of the room and locked the door behind him.

My past experiences had taught me to keep my emotions bottled up, fearing that reacting might result in another violent outburst—perhaps even a blow to my face. So, I remained silent. Each night, I went to bed alone and woke with RPA snoring beside me. The medication I was on required me to eat, though I hated it, especially with the stress weighing on me. Most mornings, I would head downstairs, turn the TV  on low in hopes of not disturbing RPA, and work quietly on my cross-stitching.

On the third day after our confrontation, RPA began shouting, ""Jean, where are you?"" He hurried downstairs, still dressed in his boxer briefs, and sat on the coffee table in front of me. He touched my leg and apologized for overreacting. I simply nodded and returned to my cross-stitch pattern, recognizing his behavior as the beginning of his guilt phase.

A few weeks later, I unexpectedly crossed paths with my old friend Chris at the 7-11. We had been friends since grade school, and seeing him again after all those years brought a sense of comfort and familiarity during an otherwise turbulent time in my life.

Later that evening, Chris stopped by our apartment for a cup of coffee. While we sat together at the dining room table, catching up and sharing memories, RPA was upstairs, preoccupied as usual with his cybersex chat rooms. Suddenly, RPA must have heard our voices from downstairs because he stormed into the room, visibly furious. His anger was unmistakable as he demanded to know who the man sitting at the table was. I tried to calmly explain that Chris was just an old friend from years ago, but RPA was not interested in listening to any explanation. He abruptly told Chris to leave the apartment.

As Chris got up to go, he quietly slipped a piece of paper into my hand. In a low voice, he told me I could call him anytime—day or night—if I ever needed anything. With that, he left, and I was once again left alone with RPA and the mounting tension in our home.

As soon as Chris left, the atmosphere in the apartment shifted abruptly. RPA slammed the front door with force, his anger palpable as he approached me. His presence was menacing, and, without hesitation, he seized both my arms in a tight grip. He fixed his gaze on me and declared, ""Listen to me, Jean. You are mine, my wife. You are nothing without me. Got it?"" The intensity of his words and the aggression in his actions sent a wave of fear through me, a feeling I hadn't experienced in years. I was deeply shaken, unable to find comfort or safety in my own home. That night, unable to face him or share the same bed, I chose to sleep on the couch, wrestling with anxiety and uncertainty about what might happen next.

The following morning brought a stark change in RPA's demeanor. Standing quietly over me, he appeared contemplative, his anger from the previous night replaced by a somber and regretful expression. His eyes reflected a deep sadness as he began to speak, offering an apology for his outburst.

Seeking to explain his behavior, RPA delved into the painful experiences of his past. He recounted memories from his previous marriages, describing the emotional wounds that still lingered. He spoke of one ex-wife, whom he held responsible for the tragic loss of his only child—a grief that seemed to haunt him. He also mentioned another marriage that had ended prematurely due to infidelity, leaving him with feelings of betrayal and disappointment.

As he finished sharing these memories, RPA reached out and gently touched my cheek, softly saying, ""Sorry, babe."" The sudden shift from anger to remorse left me feeling emotionally drained. I found myself struggling to navigate the cycle of fear and apology that had come to define our relationship, unsure of how to process the conflicting emotions that now surrounded us.

 

Less than a month after the confrontation, I began noticing troubling changes in RPA's behavior. He stopped wearing his wedding band, claiming he had lost it during a softball game. At first, I wanted to believe him, but a nagging doubt lingered in my mind.

Soon, his absences grew longer and more frequent. RPA would come home later and later,  until the point he came home between 2:00 AM and 3:00 AM, the time the strip clubs closed. Trust m,e I called one club to ask what the hours were. Each time, my gut instinct told me something was wrong. I tried paging him, hoping for a response, but only silence greeted me—nothing but dead air.

Driven by mounting anxiety and suspicion, I reached for the phone book, desperate to find answers about RPA’s whereabouts and the truth behind his late night came into the light.

 

In my desperation to uncover the truth, I closed my eyes and ran my finger down the phone book listings for local strip clubs. On the first number I finally, I mustered the courage to make a call. When someone answered—a man with a deep, gruff voice—I asked if he could help me, but he said he couldn’t. Refusing to give up, I pressed on, describing RPA’s appearance: light jeans, a tan shirt, and a red baseball cap. Suddenly, there was silence on the other end of the line. I took a deep breath and made my intentions clear and asked if man could pass a message on for me: if that man in that outfit wasn’t home within twenty minutes, there would be consequences meaning my bat  would meet his models. Then I hung up, waiting anxiously for what would happen next.

My frustration and desperation to reach RPA finally reached a boiling point. Determined to get through to him in a way that words could not, I marched upstairs to were he keep his  treasured model collection—his pride and joy, and possessions that meant more to him than almost anything else in our home. One by one, I carefully gathered the models, arranging them in a deliberate line across the downstairs area. These weren’t just small collectibles; they were impressive half-scale battleships and aircraft carriers, each one substantial in size. The smallest among them, the Arizona, stretched the entire length of my arm.

With all the models lined up in plain sight on the coffee table and the floor, I took my softball bat and readied myself for a practice swing. The message was unmistakable in both my actions and my resolve: I was prepared to use his expensive models as targets should he continue to ignore me and my growing distress. The threat was clear and direct—if RPA remained indifferent, his beloved collection would bear the consequences. In that moment, I wanted him to understand just how serious and determined I was to finally be heard.

Sure enough, within just fifteen minutes, I heard the familiar rumble of his Trans-Am pulling into the parking lot. He must have driven recklessly and broken several traffic laws because, under normal circumstances, it would have taken at least forty-five minutes for him to reach the front door from where he was. I turned off all the lights in the apartment and sat in the darkness, waiting for him on the couch with a softball bat placed prominently on the coffee table in front of me. As RPA burst in, flushed and out of breath, he immediately turned on the lights and began screaming at me, calling me crazy. I looked him straight in the eyes and replied with a sarcastic remark, pointing out just how quickly he had returned home. Then, with a snarl, I let him know that I was fully aware of the truth behind his late-night escapades. Without another word, I got up, headed upstairs, locked the bedroom door, and went to sleep. For the next couple of days, RPA barely left the house. He knew that I was serious, and that I had no qualms about treating his cherished models as mere pieces of plastic—items he had spent far too much money on—if he pushed me any further.

As time passed, RPA's true nature began to emerge more clearly. He installed a lock on the door where he kept his prized model collection, a move that seemed to signal a deeper change in his behavior. The unmistakable signs of infidelity soon followed. RPA would return home late at night, his clothing and even his skin reeking of cheap body spray. Sometimes, his bare skin sparkled with traces of body glitter—evidence he made little effort to hide. 

 Then one night, I heard that Trans-Am pull in front of our townhouse, and he walked in with some girl in stripper heels. She sat down on my white couch after that night. I wanted to burn that couch after she plopped her nasty, rotten crotch down her skirt. I could tell she did not have any underwear on.

As the tension in the room mounted, our cat wandered in, leaping up onto the coffee table. She settled herself among the chaos, her calm, unblinking gaze fixed on the scene unfolding before her. For a moment, her silent presence provided an odd sense of grounding, a reminder of normalcy in the midst of emotional turmoil. The cat simply observed everything from her perch on the coffee table, as if silently judging the absurdity of it all, while the rest of us grappled with the intensity of the situation.  Then it turned to me and made a statement that made my blood boil.

 

“You should be grateful your brother loves your retarded ass to let you stay in his home. “Without uttering a single word, I rose from my seat and walked into the kitchen. All the while, she continued to talk loudly, boasting about how RPA was paying her rent and covering her overdue car payments. She went on to say that once she moved into our home, both the cat and I would be forced out. According to her, she had no intention of living with a disabled person, and as for the cat, she made it clear that her dislike for felines meant our pet would have to leave as well. She even mentioned that she didn’t want any of her fellow dancers coming into a house with either of us there, describing how she intended to make the place her own—completely disregarding the life I had built and the home I shared with RPA.

 I walked over to the ledge between the living room and our small kitchen, where I kept my wallet. Carefully, I pulled out my ID, determined to have proof ready for what was about to unfold. My next thought was for Missy, our cat. I put down food for her, wanting to make sure she was safe and out of the way—especially since the woman sitting on my couch was about to face the consequences of her actions, and I didn’t want Missy anywhere near the chaos.

After ensuring Missy was occupied, I went to the cabinet above the microwave where I kept our important papers. I retrieved our marriage license, another piece of evidence to support my side of the story. The last thing I grabbed was the bat from the closet downstairs, a clear signal of my intent and the seriousness of the situation.

As I made my way back to where she sat, I recalled the urban legend that if a wife caught her husband cheating, she could kill both of them and somehow avoid jail time. It was just a myth, but the thought echoed the intensity of my emotions at that moment. Adding to my confidence was the knowledge that, at the time, Colorado had the “Make My Day” law on the books. Anyone who was uninvited or a stranger entering a home without permission, especially when not listed on the lease, had no legal right to be there. She certainly didn't have mine.

As I approached the woman sitting on my couch, her short skirt riding high, I could see her thong. She glanced up at me and turned noticeably pale. I realized that the look on my face must have terrified her—it was a cold, almost murderous smile. In that moment, I declared, “Really, I don’t have a brother—just a little sister,” and then pointed upstairs, clarifying that RPA actually just had an older brother. Without hesitation, I tossed my ID and our marriage license at her. She picked up the documents and examined them, her confusion mounting as she realized the truth of our relationship.

When she noticed the softball bat in my hands, I struck it against the arm of the couch, the impact reverberating through my bones. I warned her with steely resolve, “You have ten seconds—and nine of them are gone—to get the hell out of my house.” In a panic, she screamed and tumbled off the couch, crawling desperately toward the base of the staircase. One hof er heels snapped as she scrambled toward the front door, shrieking when the bat landed just inches from her feet.

At that moment, RPA came rushing downstairs, clad only in a towel and still dripping from his shower. I looked up at him and, with all the sarcasm I could muster, said, “I know incest is still illegal in the state of Colorado. When did I become your sister—since my maiden name is Eades, not A—” I pointed the bat at the woman again and announced, “Time’s up.” Raising the bat, I prepared to drive my point home as she cowered at the doorway.

 

In the chaos that followed, RPA grabbed the bat from my hands. He stared at the woman on the floor, her heavy makeup smeared and tears streaming down her face, before telling her to wait in the car. Turning to me, RPA accused me of acting crazy, then hurried off to put on some clothes. Undeterred, I followed him up the stairs and let out the most menacing laugh I could manage, warning him that he hadn’t seen crazy yet—and that he soon would see it.

The confrontation between us hit a boiling point as RPA, growing more agitated, raised his voice in an attempt to justify his behavior. He insisted that the woman was ""just a job,"" as though those words alone would erase the betrayal and turmoil he had brought into our home. I refused to let his excuses go unchallenged. Planting myself firmly in the center of the room, I crossed my arms and met his gaze with unwavering resolve. My voice remained steady, but there was no mistaking the firmness in my tone as I laid out the reality he was trying so hard to avoid. I made it clear that he, not the woman, was the one making the payments, and that those payments were for much more than the so-called arrangement he claimed. I recited, point by point, the explicit nature of what those payments truly represented, determined not to let him sidestep responsibility for his actions. Unable to face the truth, RPA hurriedly got dressed, his frustration mounting. He stormed out of the house, the sharp sound of the front door slamming behind him, leaving a resounding echo in the tense silence that followed.

The stress from the evening’s confrontation took its toll almost immediately, manifesting as a sharp, relentless headache that made it difficult to think clearly. Overwhelmed, I reached for the phone and called my friend Jess, desperate for a sympathetic ear. I tried to recount the events that had just transpired, but before I could finish explaining, my body betrayed me—a massive grand mal seizure seized control, cutting our conversation short. Thankfully, Jess was there for me in my moment of vulnerability. She managed to help me upstairs and get me safely into bed, despite my stubborn refusal to go to the hospital. The thought of another medical bill—one more burden to add to the stack—was simply too much for me to bear, so I insisted on staying home, clinging to the comfort of familiar surroundings and Jess’s steady presence.

Mark Thompson had always prided himself on being a family man. At 38, he was the picture of suburban stability: a mid-level accountant at a downtown firm, owner of a modest three-bedroom house in a quiet neighborhood, and father to two energetic kids—Lily, who was six and obsessed with princess stories, and little Max, four years old and forever glued to his toy trucks. His wife, Sarah, was the glue that held it all together. Or so he thought. They'd been married for ten years, high school sweethearts who had built a life from scratch. Sarah worked part-time as a graphic designer from home, allowing her to juggle the kids' schedules with ease. Their days were filled with soccer practices, bedtime stories, and stolen moments of affection amid the chaos.

But on that fateful Tuesday afternoon, everything crumbled.

Mark had left work early, citing a headache to his boss. Truth was, he wanted to surprise Sarah with flowers and takeout from her favorite Thai place. It was their anniversary next week, and he'd been feeling distant lately—work stress, he figured. As he pulled into the driveway, he noticed an unfamiliar car parked out front. A sleek black sedan that didn't belong to any of their neighbors. His brow furrowed, but he shrugged it off. Maybe a client meeting for Sarah's freelance work.

He entered quietly through the garage door, flowers in hand, the aroma of pad Thai wafting from the bag. The house was eerily silent. No kids' laughter echoing from the playroom. Right, he remembered—Lily and Max were at daycare until five. Perfect timing for a surprise.

Ascending the stairs, he heard muffled sounds from the master bedroom. A giggle. A low murmur. His heart skipped a beat. Pushing the door open slowly, the scene before him hit like a freight train.

Sarah was in their bed—the bed they'd shared for a decade, where they'd conceived their children, where they'd whispered dreams late into the night. She was entangled with another man, a stranger with tousled hair and a smug grin that vanished the moment Mark's shadow fell across them. Sheets twisted around their naked bodies, the air thick with the scent of betrayal.

""Mark!"" Sarah gasped, scrambling to cover herself, her face draining of color. The man bolted upright, eyes wide in panic.

""What the fuck is this?"" Mark's voice was a thunderclap, the flowers dropping from his hand, petals scattering like broken promises. His world tilted, rage and disbelief surging through him.

The man stammered, grabbing his clothes. ""I—I didn't know—""

""Get out!"" Mark roared, stepping forward with fists clenched. The intruder didn't need telling twice; he fled half-dressed down the stairs, slamming the front door behind him.

Sarah sat there, tears streaming down her face, clutching the sheet to her chest. ""Mark, please, it's not what it looks like—""

""Not what it looks like? You're fucking some guy in our bed! On a Tuesday afternoon! While our kids are at daycare!"" His voice cracked, the anger bubbling over into something raw and primal.

She reached out, but he recoiled. ""I'm so sorry, it was a mistake—""

""A mistake? How long has this 'mistake' been going on?"" He paced the room, his mind racing through memories—late nights at ""work,"" unexplained texts, the growing distance between them.

""A few months,"" she whispered, sobbing now. ""I was lonely, Mark. You're always at the office—""

""Don't you dare blame me!"" he shouted, slamming his fist into the dresser, knocking over a framed photo of their family at the beach. Glass shattered, mirroring the fracture in his heart.

He stormed out, grabbing his keys. ""I can't even look at you right now."" He drove aimlessly for hours, tears blurring the road, his phone buzzing with her frantic calls and texts. Please come home. We need to talk. I love you.

By evening, he returned. The kids were home now, oblivious to the storm brewing. Lily chattered about her day at dinner, Max making engine noises with his fork. Sarah's eyes were red-rimmed, her movements mechanical as she served spaghetti. Mark forced a smile for the children, but inside, he was a volcano.

After tucking them in—reading Lily her favorite story about a brave knight, kissing Max's forehead—he retreated to the living room. Sarah followed, closing the door softly behind her.

""Mark, can we talk now?"" Her voice was small, pleading.

He sat on the couch, staring at the wall, the weight of the day pressing down. ""Talk? What is there to say? You destroyed everything.""

She knelt in front of him, taking his hands. He yanked them away. ""Please, honey. It was stupid. I was weak. But I love you. I love our family. Give me a chance to make this right.""

""A chance?"" He laughed bitterly, standing up to pace again. ""You fucked another man in our bed! The bed where our kids jump on us on Saturday mornings! How do I ever trust you again? Every time I look at you, I'll see that image burned into my brain.""

Tears flowed freely down her cheeks. ""I know, I know. I'm so ashamed. It meant nothing—he meant nothing. It was just... excitement, something missing. But you're my everything. Please, let's go to counseling. I'll do anything to rebuild your trust.""

""Rebuild trust? With what? Lies and excuses?"" His voice rose, laced with venom. ""You're a whore, Sarah. A fucking slut who couldn't keep her legs closed while I was out busting my ass to provide for this family.""

She flinched as if slapped, but didn't back down. ""Don't call me that. I made a horrible mistake, but I'm not that. I'm your wife, the mother of your children. Remember our vows? For better or worse?""

""Vows you shattered!"" he bellowed, his face reddening. ""Worse? This is beyond worse. This is betrayal on the deepest level. How many times? How many lies have you told me?""

""Only a few times,"" she admitted, her voice breaking. ""But it's over. I ended it today—before you even walked in. I realized how wrong it was.""

""Bullshit,"" he spat, pointing at her. ""You ended it because you got caught. If I hadn't come home early, you'd still be screwing him behind my back.""

She shook her head vehemently. ""No, Mark. I swear. I was going to tell you tonight. I couldn't live with the guilt anymore.""

""Guilt? Where was your guilt when you were moaning under him?"" His words were knives, each one aimed to hurt as much as he was hurting. Sadness twisted in his gut, mixing with the rage—a cocktail of emotions that made his chest ache.

Sarah collapsed onto the floor, sobbing. ""Please, don't do this. Think about Lily and Max. They need us together. I'll prove it to you—I'll give you my phone, my passwords. No more secrets. We can start fresh.""

He sank into a chair, rubbing his temples. The clock ticked past midnight, the argument stretching like a rubber band ready to snap. She begged, recounting their happy memories: their wedding day under the oaks, the birth of Lily in the pouring rain, family vacations to the lake. ""We've built so much. Don't throw it away over my stupidity.""

But with each plea, his resolve hardened. The hurt was too deep, the trust obliterated. ""You think passwords fix this? Every kiss, every touch—it's all tainted now. I'll always wonder if you're lying again.""

""I won't! I promise!"" She crawled closer, clutching his leg. ""I love you more than anything. Give me time to show you.""

He looked down at her, tears in his own eyes now. ""I loved you too, Sarah. More than life. But this... this killed it. The woman I married wouldn't do this.""

The fight dragged on, voices rising and falling like waves. She apologized a hundred ways—remorseful, desperate, offering to move out temporarily if it helped, to seek therapy alone first. He hurled insults, his anger a shield for the sorrow threatening to drown him: ""Selfish bitch,"" ""Lying cheat,"" words he never thought he'd say to her.

By 3 a.m., exhaustion set in. The living room was a battlefield of tissues and shattered illusions. Mark stood, his decision crystallized in the quiet hours.

""There's no coming back from this,"" he said, his voice steady but edged with fury. ""I want a divorce. Tomorrow, we tell the kids something gentle, and you start packing. I can't live in this house of lies anymore.""

""Mark, no!"" she wailed, grabbing his arm. ""Please, reconsider. For us, for the family—""

He shook her off, still seething. ""The family you destroyed? No. It's over. Get out of my sight.""

She crumpled, but he turned away, heading to the guest room. The door closed with finality, echoing the end of their marriage. In the darkness, Mark wept silently, mourning the life that had vanished in a single afternoon. The road ahead was divorce papers, custody battles, and explaining to two innocent children why Mommy and Daddy couldn't be together anymore. But in his heart, scarred and angry, he knew there was no other way.

The guest room felt like a prison cell that night. Mark lay on the stiff mattress, the unfamiliar sheets twisting around him as he tossed and turned. Sleep was a distant enemy, evading him with every replay of the afternoon's horror in his mind—the tangled bodies, Sarah's gasp, the stranger's frantic escape. Anger had fueled him through the confrontation, but now, in the quiet hours before dawn, it ebbed away like a receding tide, leaving behind a vast shore of hurt and sadness. Divorce. The word echoed in his skull, heavy and final. How would he explain it to Lily and Max? How could he dismantle the life they'd built? Tears soaked his pillow as the clock ticked mercilessly toward morning.

In the master bedroom, Sarah fared no better. Curled up under the covers that still held the faint scent of betrayal, she stared at the ceiling, her body wracked with sobs she muffled into her fist. The remorse was a living thing inside her, gnawing at her soul—not just performative guilt, but a deep, aching regret that she'd shattered their home for a fleeting thrill. She didn't want this to end. Not the marriage, not the family. But Mark's words had been unyielding, his eyes cold with pain. By 4 a.m., desperation drove her to her phone. She dialed her closest girlfriends, a trio she'd known since college: Emily, the pragmatic one; Jess, the empathetic listener; and Mia, the fiery advisor.

The calls were hushed, her voice breaking as she spilled everything. ""I screwed up so bad,"" she whispered to Emily first. ""He caught me... with someone else. In our bed. And now he wants a divorce. I begged him all night, told him how sorry I am, how much I love him and the kids. But he's done. I don't know what to do.""

Emily sighed, her disappointment evident even over the line. ""Sarah, what were you thinking? Mark's a good guy—we all love him. He's always been so solid for you and the kids. But you're our friend, and we'll support you through this. Just... God, this is messy.""

Jess was next, her tone softer. ""I'm disappointed, Sar. Really. But I can hear how remorseful you are. It's not just words; I know you mean it. Tell me everything.""

Sarah recounted the fight, her pleas falling on deaf ears. ""I don't want to break up our family. The kids... they deserve better. But he's threatening divorce, and nothing's getting through.""

Mia, the last call, was blunt. ""Girl, that's heartbreaking. We all adore Mark—he's like the brother we never had. But you're our ride-or-die. Yeah, we're disappointed in what you did, but we're here for you. Now, listen up. We've got a plan.""

The three conferenced in, brainstorming in the predawn hush. ""Don't try to convince him of anything right now,"" Mia said firmly. ""He's raw, hurting. Pushing will just make him dig in deeper.""

""Exactly,"" Emily added. ""Behave as if nothing's happened. As if it was all a bad dream. Be the wife you've always been—the one who cooks breakfast, keeps the house running, loves on those kids. Let him lick his wounds and fester. Even if he wants divorce, nothing happens overnight. He'll need to meet lawyers, get advice, file paperwork. That takes at least 10-15 days, probably more with kids involved.""

Jess chimed in supportively. ""If he's angry or says hurtful things, let him vent. Be patient. If he wants space—stays in the guest room, avoids you—give it to him. Don't suggest counseling or fixes; let him work it out his way. Stay consistent, show him the life he's walking away from without words.""

""And if he actually presents papers?"" Sarah asked, her voice trembling.

""Then we regroup,"" Mia said. ""But until then, this is your play. Show him what he's losing by being the rock he's always leaned on.""

Sarah hung up, a fragile resolve settling over her. It wasn't manipulation; it was a lifeline thrown into the storm, born of true remorse and a desperate hope to salvage their home.

Morning broke with the usual chaos. Sarah rose early, as always, slipping into her routine like slipping into an old, comfortable role. She brewed coffee, the rich aroma filling the kitchen. Pancakes sizzled on the griddle—Mark's favorite, with blueberries for the kids. She hummed softly, setting the table, packing lunches. When Lily and Max tumbled downstairs, she greeted them with warm hugs and laughter, helping Lily with her backpack and tying Max's shoes.

Mark emerged last, disheveled and hollow-eyed, the sadness etched into his features. He paused in the doorway, confusion flickering across his face. Sarah looked... normal. Smiling at the kids, flipping pancakes as if the world hadn't ended yesterday. ""Morning, hon,"" she said lightly, handing him a mug of coffee, black with two sugars, just how he liked it. No pleading eyes, no tears—just the wife he'd known for years.

He took it warily, mumbling, ""Morning."" Still angry, hurt pulsing like a bruise, he sat at the table, watching her. Why wasn't she crumbling? Begging? It threw him off balance. ""Kids, eat up,"" he said gruffly, avoiding her gaze.

The day unfolded in that uneasy normalcy. Sarah drove the kids to school, came home to tidy up, even left a note on his lunch: Have a good day at work. Love you. Mark stared at it in his office, crumpling it before smoothing it out again. Sadness weighed on him, but confusion gnawed too. Was she in denial? Or playing some game?

That night, he retreated to the guest room without a word. Sarah didn't follow, didn't question. She read to the kids, tucked them in, then busied herself with laundry, her demeanor steady.

The next 15 days blurred into a tense limbo, each one a step in Mark's internal war. On day two, fueled by lingering anger, he researched divorce lawyers online during his lunch break, bookmarking a few local firms. That evening, he snapped at Sarah over dinner when she asked about his day. ""Why do you care?"" he bit out, hurt lacing his words. She just nodded calmly, ""Because I do,"" and cleared the plates without retort.

By day three, sadness dominated. He called his brother, venting in a low voice from the garage. ""She cheated, man. In our bed. I can't get past it."" His brother advised seeing a lawyer soon. Mark hung up, staring at family photos on his phone, tears welling.

Day four: He met with a lawyer after work, a no-nonsense woman named Ms. Harlan. ""With kids, we'll aim for amicable,"" she said, outlining custody options and asset splits. Mark nodded numbly, paperwork stacking up in his briefcase. Home that night, Sarah had made his favorite lasagna. He ate in silence, confused by her unwavering kindness. ""Thanks,"" he muttered, retreating early.

Days five through seven were a grind. Anger flared sporadically—he'd mutter under his breath about trust, about betrayal, testing her. ""How can you act like everything's fine?"" he'd say one evening, voice raw with hurt. Sarah met his eyes steadily. ""Because I love our life here."" No arguments, no pleas. She gave him space, sleeping alone while he tossed in the guest room, his sadness deepening into a quiet ache. He started gathering financial documents, emailing the lawyer questions about alimony.

On day eight, a rough one: Max had a nightmare, crying for Daddy. Mark went to him, holding his son close, glancing at Sarah in the doorway. She smiled softly, retreating without intrusion. Confusion mounted—why wasn't she fighting? It made the hurt echo louder.

Days nine and ten: He consulted a second lawyer for a second opinion, driving to the appointment with a knot in his stomach. ""Mediation could speed things up,"" the attorney suggested. Mark agreed, but doubt crept in. At home, Sarah organized a family movie night, popcorn and all. The kids laughed; Mark joined reluctantly, his arm brushing hers. Sadness overwhelmed him later, alone in the guest room.

By day eleven, he had preliminary papers drafted. He stared at them in his office, heart heavy. That night, Lily asked why Daddy was sleeping downstairs. ""Just for a bit, sweetie,"" Sarah said gently, glancing at Mark. He said nothing, anger simmering beneath the sadness.

Days twelve through fourteen: More actions—filing initial petitions online, scheduling a court date tentatively. He confided in a work friend, who urged reconciliation. ""She seems genuinely sorry."" But Mark shook his head, hurt too fresh. Yet Sarah's consistency wore on him: breakfasts ready, kids' routines seamless, small acts of love like ironing his shirts. Confusion turned to quiet reflection.

On day fifteen, the lawyer emailed the final draft papers. Mark printed them at work, tucking them into his bag. Driving home, sadness crashed over him like a wave. Sarah greeted him with dinner on the table, the kids' artwork displayed proudly. He sat, watching her, the anger a distant memory, replaced by a profound sorrow. The plan had worked its subtle magic—he was still hurt, still sad, but the festering had led to questions. What now? As the evening wore on, the papers burned in his bag, unspoken.",0,1770640668.0,cheating_stories,0,0.5,False

Got stopped twice at the bodega asking if these were real. Distressed toe looks intentional, not sloppy. But my arches screamed after 3 hours—cute, not comfy.

dior b30
Heavy as hell. Like, “did they pour concrete in the sole?” heavy. But that CD logo catches streetlight just right. Paired with black jeans and suddenly I look like I have a trust fund.

nike everyday socks
$ 15 for 3 pairs? Hard pass. First wash: one shrank to toddler size, second lost the swoosh like a sad sticker, third developed a heel hole before I even left the house. Felt like wearing tissue paper. Stick to Uniqlo. Or literally anything else.

stone island hoodie
That compass patch on the sleeve? Still crisp after two washes. Fabric’s thick enough for 50°F mornings but won’t cook you. Threw it on with jeans and called it a fit. Zero effort.

carhartt wip script hoodie
Feels like I stole it from my dad’s closet in 2003. Soft, slightly faded, zero stiffness. Wore it to grab coffee and felt weirdly confident. My cat’s currently napping in it. High praise.

corteiz superior hoodie
Back says “CORTEIZ” with a crown + French text I can’t pronounce. Front’s completely blank—love that. Stranger said “nice hoodie,” zero follow-up. Vibe over logo, always.

stussy grey crewneck
Tiny scribble logo on chest—barely visible unless you’re staring. Fit’s relaxed but not drowning me. Perfect for days I want to look intentional without screaming “I tried.”

nike x stussy sweatpants
Mini box logo on thigh = quiet flex. Elastic cuffs stay put, no sagging when I crouch for the dog. Wore these to walk the block and felt zero guilt about being comfy.

gallery dept painted flare pants
Splatter paint looks like I DIY’d after two beers… but cool. Black cuffs keep it from looking messy. Paired with a plain white tee—suddenly I’m in a street style pic. My mom would side-eye these. I adore them.

Anyway, the cat’s currently using the Carhartt as a bed. Guess that’s the real review.

#Picks Of The Week (by u/lefuniname)


####**1. KBA - Change / Watch It Fall (feat. Slether) [Plat:form]**  
*Recommended if you like: Moekel, Mefjus, WING*  

Who knew ""international beatbox battler champion turned futuristic dnb producer"" would ever be a category on here? 

**1.1. BeatBorgsing**

Growing up somewhere in the Netherlands, but originally from and nowadays once again residing in Denmark, Kasper Borgen Andersen was always a bit of a performer. As early as high school times, he not only campaigned for the man the myth the legend Ben for king emperor or something, he also participated in the school's theatrical shows of _Zombie Prom_, _Troll Bridge_, and many more, but for our purposes I'm just gonna jump ahead to 2019 now. By that point already well-versed in the art of the Loopstation, Kasper proceeded to go and win the gold medal at that year's Dutch Beatbox Battle, marking the first big win in his live battle career - of which quite a few were still yet to follow! Over the following years, he participated in more and more noteworthy battles all over the planet (thanks Covid), collecting first place wins at Baltic Coast, the CLIP 2v2 tournament (with _Josh O_ as _Team Substance_), Krook Beatbox Battle 6 (with _PSN_), and the Danish Beatbox Championship, and earning some silverware at CLIP's Team Loopstation Battle (with _Tonker_, _Dr. Slow Sweat_, and _Sensei_), at the following year's CLIP 2v2 battle (as _Team Substance mkII_) and the Grand Beatbox Battle, with the latterest actually being his first foray into the _Producer_ category. 

With that very condensed and, believe it or not, actually heavily filtered information overload out of the way, let's try and focus on another aspect of this journey of his: production! Early on, from what I can tell entirely loopstation-built tunes like 2020's 'You're Not Coming Home' or 2022's 'Forgive Myself' (later reworked into a 2025 VIP), as part of that year's _Swissbeatbox_ compilation, already saw him venture into the wild world of arranging and creating music of his own, and the urge to take the already impressive creations of his even further only grew stronger and stronger. 

**1.2. The King Is Dead, Long Live The King! (2024 - 2026)**

After his first silver-placed entry into the _Producer_ category at the _Grand Beatbox Battle_ championship in 2023, and further stationing of loops _Vokal Total_ and _Haten World_ in 2024, Kasper formally announced that year to be his last as an active participant in the beatboxing battle scene. While he would still continue going to events as a judge and a fan, he wanted to go out on a high and focus on his burgeoning production journey. One last time, however, he joined the battle circus as a gladiator for 2024's Grand Beatbox Battle World in Tokyo, once again shooting his shot in the producer category, and... won gold! He really stuck the landing on that one, didn't he? 

That's not the only thing 2024 had going for it though, it was also the start of his new collaborative **TechTonic** project with **Kaos**, a drum & bass live performance venture aiming to challenge your preconceived notions of a DJ set! Both it and the **KBA** name saw a lot of movement on the discography side of things from there on out as well, with Kasper remixing TechTonic tunes and vice versa, but it was the solo project that really took off in my eyes, with his first ever EP in 2025, _The New King_. Not only were the tunes themselves (one of them being the aforementioned rework of 'Forgive Myself') absolutely huge, the remixes that followed brought me much joy - his roommate _Eli Moore_'s remix of 'Whiplash' is actually where I first stumbled upon Kasper! 

More on him in the near future, but first, let's talk about this newest double single of Kasper's!

**1.3. Change / Watch It Fall**

Released on the ever-amazing, thoroughly anti-AI Czech imprint **Plat:form**, this one-two-er is yet another step above what I had already fallen in love with on the _New King_ EP, with especially **Change** simply _blowing me away_. As KBA's own wonderful vocals grapple with the frustratingly unchanging nature of things, waves of orchestral arrangements start crashing onto our mental shores, with each hit pushing the envelope one bit further, until the defeated Kasper cries out the titular line, making way for the star of the show: A choir of a million digital voices delivering a melody so deeply heart-piercing that goosebumps are basically guaranteed. With every piece of the puzzle now unveiled, he launches into the supercharged version of these already quite beefed-up synths, which are turned into a full-on drop with stutter effects, punchy drums, and all sorts of fun little quirky details hiding in the arrangement. Not just that though, no no, the second half sees Kasper flip the script and instead deliver a minimalistic version of it all, that a certain Schnitzelboi duo would be proud of. 

Speaking of, flip-side **Watch It Fall** sees Kasper channel the remaining third of DnB's favourite Austrian boyband, with bass stabs so ludicrously lethal they need a special license to wield and even just carry around probably. That's of course not the whole picture though. Featuring Anthony **Slether** Skelton, fellow looper artist from Germany, on the moody vocals, this one builds up quite the suspenseful atmosphere, matching Mr. Skeltal's lyrical excursion into the world of never-ending movies with a backdrop so cinematic it might as well feature in the next Bond film, until it all comes crashing down, with the aforementioned stabbery of basses, delivered in a most violent fashion. Each hit, each variant, all of it causing incomprehensible damage, all around.

**1.4. Conclusion**

Kas per usual, KBA delivers pure melodic madness unlike any other. 

Other unique stuff from this week:  
- xyzzyx - Tesla Coil  
- Siimi - Feel Alive  
- Daniel Slam - Backtrack

####**2. charlie.pxls - Questioning Perception EP 💎 [Back2Back Records]**  
*Recommended if you like: A K A, Silentium, DLR*  

Continuing my mission to showcase mostly new names on here, I present to you this week's _Hidden Gem Of The Week™️_: **charlie.pxls**! 

**2.1. Charlotte Pixelton The Third (2015 - 2026)**

Based out of Sweden's capital of Stockholm, Charlotte ""**charlie.pxls**"" Nilsson has been an integral part of the nordic scene for years now. Around mid-2015 (!), she first started getting into DJing, which immediately sparked so much joy in her that she never really stopped - it was _the_ puzzle piece she was missing in her life. Over the years, she not only regularly blessed her SoundCloud followers with all sorts of themed mixes, including a 180bpm Techstep mix to chill and relax to _(that last part is implied)_, she also did guest mixes for the _Smörgåsbord Sessions_ on _Sub FM_, and eventually became a resident-slash-promoter for Swedish collective **Back2Back Records**, who, side note, offer a surprisingly wide range of artists to their local fans. From _Seba_ to _Neonlight_, from _DJ Hybrid_ to _Tom Finster_, they got, like, everything covered!

Anyway. In 2018, she also jumped on the production train that from then slowly but surely chugged along with her DJing career and first bore fruit in 2020, with the self-release of _jellfish.exe_. She also became one half of _Sensor Down_ in that same year, but that's kind of all I can tell you about that project. And about her production journey in general! Last year, we were treated to her ""proper"" debut release on _Truth Hertz_, called _Fungi Express_, but from there on the next stop is already the **Questioning Perception EP** we are here to discuss today - so let's do that then!

**2.2. Questioning Perception EP**

Released on the aforementioned legendary Swedish imprint-promoter-collective-platform **Back2Back Records**, this five-tracker opens with the smoothly rolling basses, familiar vocal samples, wonderful progression and atmosphere you can just let your mind wander off into, of **When You Need Me**. Going deeper down the subway tunnel of the EP's artwork, **Cause And Effect** presents us with world full of Hip-Hop samples, one-note basslines that stop your countenance in its bass-faced tracks and an assortment of rhythmic elements raining down on you, providing ample opportunity to shake various body parts to. Further away from the murky tunnel aesthetic, title track **Questioning Perception** instead focuses on the loveliness deep dnb can conjure up in our minds, with incredibly intoxicating bassline movement, atmosphere pouring in from every corner of the room, and carefully-crafted melodic parts that are frankly just delightful.

With that out of the way, Charlie amps up the pressure on **Don't Entertain It**, focusing on big, steppy, bassy rhythms, boom-tschack kick-snares, all relentlessly two-stepping along to the bleepy bloopy beat. Lastly, we got the EP closer exploring the funk **Between The Notes**: Filthy, bristolian basses reaching deeper than ever before, fast-paced percussion that walks the line between fonk and rolling rhythms, stylish vocal samples and all sorts of one-shot bass sounds filling in the blanks. That's a banger alright.

**2.3. Conclusion**

So deep, dark, lovely, heavy and bassy that you can't help but love this debut release. More like Swe-_damn_! 

Other deep and dark stuff from this week:  
- NC-17, Philth - Last Of A Dying Breed - Volume 3  
- Thread - Blurred EP  
- Ratso - Parallel / Dreams  
- R3IDY - Teapot / A444

I first saw the deer a week ago.

My boyfriend and I went hiking last weekend. It was for our anniversary, and we finally had some time off work to spend some time with one another.

My boyfriend, ""Aaron"", was so excited. He'd grown up in the mountains, and so, he loved the idea of us heading out to his hometown to hike. It was sweet seeing him this happy. We'd been in a bit of a slump in our relationship because of work. He'd been put on nights and I still worked days, so we rarely saw each other. We had tried our best to see each other at home, but it was hard.

This is exactly what we needed; some quality time together.

""You're gonna love this place,"" he had told me in the car, ""I promise.""

God, I wished that was true.

It took us about 4 hours to reach his hometown. Smooth sailing all things considered. Traffic was light, sun stayed up throughout and the tunes were *on point*.

It was your standard rural town. It was quiet and reserved, the place adorned with adorable little 'mom and pop' shops and a miniature fountain in the centre.

We found this cute little cabin on the outskirts of town. It was small, but unbelievably cosy when you put the fire on.

One thing that stood out to me was that the place was littered with huge pine trees. Aaron told me how proud he was when he climbed one of them as a kid. I shrugged it off. I mean, it's a tree. But, *holy shit*. I understood how amazing of a feat this was now. These things were *massive*.

They pierced through the clouds like giant shards of green. My neck killed after watching them for so long. I had never seen trees this big before. It was like they kept rising and rising and never stopped.

There were tons of snowy mountains too. They encircled the town like a mighty wall, protecting it from outside dangers. It was simply breathtaking.

Much different than the desert I grew up in.

His parents still lived there, so we went to their place for dinner when we finished unpacking.

They're a lovely couple. I hadn't eaten that well in a *while*. His mom made a spicy meatloaf and I ate so much of it, I had to pop my belt afterwards. Aaron couldn't really handle the spice, so it was hilarious seeing him gulp down litres of water in between each tiny morsel. His face was flushed after, and so was his dad's. They look so much like each other.

Once dinner was finished, we all sat in their living room, nursing glasses of wine. Aaron drank the rest of his water.

We left around 8PM. I can remember it because we wanted to head back before it was totally dark.

The sun was setting, plunging the streets into shadow. The moon had been up for a while and now it had began to shine beautifully against the darkening blue of the twilight sky.

Streetlamps hadn't been switched on yet, so we had to drive slowly and be on the lookout for people or animals.

The lights from the shops became pinpricks in the rear-view mirror and eventually we reached the western outskirts of the town.

I was lucky that Aaron knew the roads inside and out. I would've crashed as soon as we reversed out his parents' driveway. We were quiet on the trip back. I think we didn't know what to talk about.

""Well, I'm full."" Aaron's voice broke the silence.

""Yeah, me too."" I gave a soft laugh.

The car was noiseless again before we both spoke at the same time.

""Are you okay?"" We matched each other.

For the first time in a while, the pair of us laughed together. It was gentle, but genuine. It was nice.

""Yeah I'm okay,"" I giggled, ""you?""

""Yeah, not bad."" Aaron chuckled to himself, hands relaxing on the wheel.

The silence wasn't as tense anymore. We knew we were tired. That's all.

""The trail's going to look so pretty tomorrow."" he chirped, that big smile of his returning to his face.

I was going to say something when he immediately stuck his arm out and hit my chest, creating a barrier to hold me back .

He stomped his foot on the brake, hard. He had held his arm out across my chest to keep me from plummeting forward into the windshield.

It was so abrupt, I fell into his arm and had the air knocked out of my lungs.

When the car jolted to a stop, I snapped backwards against the seat, narrowly avoiding banging the back of my head into the headrest.

Aaron's arm was still shielding my chest when he fell backwards. Luckily, his head missed the headrest like myself and he slowly leaned his neck back to put his head against the leather.

We sat there, panting after the sudden stop.  Aaron was looking forward, eyebrows furrowed and his mouth contorted into an open scowl.

""Came out of nowhere."" He muttered under his breath.

I stared onwards, eyes fixated on the object in the road.

It was a deer.

She was an average doe; antlerless and she had pretty white freckles dotted on her back. She wasn't looking at us though. Her head was facing the road ahead of us.

Her ears were completely still. Not even a quiver at the sound of the car screeching to a halt.

""A deer?"" I gasped out.

Aaron had his lips pressed into a tight, thin line. I noticed his chest wasn't rising, and then came to the realisation that he was holding his breath.

His eyes were wobbling, tears forming. He hadn't blinked once since he  slammed the brakes.

In fact, he hadn't moved.

""What?"" He murmured in a wispy tone.

He was breathless.

I watched him with wary eyes, awaiting his reaction. I had never seen him this fearful before. It reminded me of a child staring into his closet when he heard a bump in the night.

We sat there for another few seconds before I decided to take action, and honk the horn.

Looking back, I think this was the worst thing I had ever done.

I pushed Aaron's arm towards him and I pressed harshly down on the horn, a quick 'beep' echoed into the woods.

I waited.

The doe didn't move.

I furrowed my brow, and started to feel a strange discomfort in my skin. It was as if I had done something stupid. Hell, even *illegal*.

This awful feeling ran up my neck. I was scared of a *deer* of all things. The woods were pitch-black by that point, and this unease made me want to head home as soon as we could. Aaron was obviously shaken.  I hated feeling so *afraid*.

So, out of embarrassment and anger, I yelled.

I fucking yelled at the deer.

I moved back over to my side of the car and put down the window. I leaned out of it and yelled with as much power as my vocal cords could muster, ""Move!""

Fear definitely put some power behind my voice.

As soon as the word left my lips, a rough hand ragged my shoulder back into the seat of my car. I looked back with confusion, only to see a horrified Aaron glaring at me.

He put the window up and hissed, ""what the hell are you doing?""

""It's a *deer*,"" I snapped back, desperate to get away from the road and head home, ""you haven't scared off a deer before?""

Aaron shook his head in disbelief and turned back to the animal. I did so too, hoping that the deer had taken the hint and galloped off back into the undergrowth.

It hadn't even flinched. The thing was still stuck there, neck twisted to the side and thin legs pin-straight.

The dread washed over me, sending a horrible shiver down my spine. Maybe it was deaf?

Then, as if it heard me think, the deer ran off in the most awful way possible. It made me recoil so far back in my seat, I was practically moving the chair back.

It kept its legs straight and lolloped back into the bushes, like a crappy stop-motion movie. The deer kept its head facing away from us, bobbing back and forth. It looked a spring bouncing around after you pull it back and let it go.

It was jarring seeing an elegant creature moving in such a disjointed way.

It was slow too, taking its time to carefully plod back into the woods.

Aaron and I looked at it disappear into the abyss of the pines, wide-eyed with disgust.

He continued to stare at the animal before I had to shake him out of whatever trance he was trapped in.

He shook his head and thrust the car into first gear, the pair of us eager to get into the cabin.

It took another 10 minutes for us to reach it. Aaron was driving slightly above the speed limit, but I didn't blame him. I kept thinking about any logical reasons as to why the doe had behaved like that.

When we eventually arrived, the pair of us speed-walked inside and locked the door. Aaron double-checked all the windows were locked and we stayed the night snuggled up in our bedroom watching a random drama on my laptop.

The thought of the deer was fading now, with my consciousness nailing the whole thing down to tiredness.

I had seen weird deer before. The idea of one being deaf or injured made more sense to me than it being anything unnatural.

It was our anniversary tomorrow, and that was the main thing on my mind.

Aaron, however, was twitchy all night. He was the one driving, so I could understand why he was unsettled. He's a good driver, and I guessed that he was shocked he didn't see the deer earlier.

The next morning was much better.

Aaron woke me up with a breakfast in bed, much to my delight. He seemed much more calm than the night before. There was still a hint of nervousness behind his eyes, but I shrugged it off. I can't describe the happiness I felt just *being there* with him.

The pair of us set off around 1, and the hike was supposed to last us for at least 2-3 hours, depending on how long our breaks would be.

It was supposed to be a wonderful couple of hours in nature.

It was much longer than that.

We told Aaron's parents that we'd be done by 4, and that we'd left a key under the doormat outside. We also told them which trail we were heading on, so they knew where we were if the worst would happen. They told us to look out for mountain lions, which we assured them we would.

I was eager to get out there, despite last night's events. It had been a while since I went hiking, but with Aaron by my side, I knew it was going to be a safe but fun trip.

The first half of the trek was perfect. We walked around the forest, the great pines covering the mossy floor in shadow. The place was teeming with life, with squirrels dashing past our heads in the trees and birds chirping sweet songs in our ears. Aaron tried whistling back, to little response.

""Guess my pitch is off."" He chuckled.

I gave it go, and surprisingly, a couple of birds twittered back. Aaron feigned shock and snatched me up, before running with me down the trail, shouting you, ""you can't have her!"" and, ""she's mine!""

I was in complete stitches, and laughed even harder when bewildered hikers walked past us, eyebrows raised and some giggling at our frantic display.

At the end of the first half of the hike, we were rewarded with a scene of a beautiful lake. It was around there we stopped for a quick break. We sat on the side of the trail, watching the sun shimmering on the surface of the water. There were people all over it. Some were on canoes, some were windsurfing. Quite a lot of people swimming actually. I could see their little heads bobbing around in the water.

I think I took 20 pictures of the place.

We stayed there awhile before we set off back down the trail.

The sun wouldn't go down for a while, so we took our time.

I had completely forgotten about what happened last night. Aaron seemed a little bit on edge but he was still grinning ear to ear. Sometimes I would see him look behind us. He disguised it as looking at me, but I kind of knew the real reason.

The thought of that deer was still playing on his mind.

In hindsight, I should've been more cautious too. Aaron lived here all his childhood, so he knew what was normal round those woods.

If Aaron was still anxious, I should've been too.

The trail was still relatively busy. It was still early afternoon, so most people probably started hiking then.

We'd walk past them, greeting fellow travelers. We could hear them behind us chatting about work or who's birthday it was that week. Normal things.

We had less than an half an hour left on our way back, and Aaron texted his parents to let them know.

I looked up at the pines. The sun's rays tried their hardest to shine through the dense needles, showering the floor with little pinpricks of light.

Then I heard a voice.

It came from *somewhere*. I originally thought it came from in front of us; it could've been a hiker coming up the trail.

The voice was faint, hardly above a whisper. Although I would call it more of a groan. It was a rattling sound.

I didn't think anything of it and waited to see who was walking up the trail. We went on, smiles still stretched across our faces.

Unfortunately, no one ever walked past.

I could see Aaron tense his shoulders. He stuck his hand out and waggled it, prompting me to take it.

I sped up and walked closer to him, holding his hand. He didn't look down at me, but he acknowledged my presence with a squeeze of my hand.

I was going to turn and see if it someone messing with us, but Aaron squeezed my hand again, and looked at me with big eyes. He gave a soft shake of his head and gestured with his eyes to remain looking ahead.

The voice grew louder the more we walked. It wasn't actually saying much, just a bunch of babbling. Sharp breaths punctuated every syllable. It kept changing its intonation too. One moment it would be as happy as a child, letting out stifled giggles, other times it would be nervously whimpering. Sometimes it would be angry. Like letting out growls and cut-off yelps.

It was almost as if it were speaking to us from all angles. Sometimes hisses would come from the left. Some gasps would come from the right. It wanted us to look at it.

It got colder. The sun was still high in the sky, but a grim, cold wind had picked up, and I ended up having to put my hands in my pockets.

We entered an area where there was debris on the ground. Needles and sticks, that kind of thing. We walked a bit faster through this part, hoping to reach the exit as quickly as possible. We had be less than 15 minutes away now, so we were close. Along with the crunching underfoot, the voice followed us.

It was getting more vocal now, yipping and letting out whoops. Couldn't tell if they were happy screams or annoyed ones.

It was close to us, though. *Horribly close*.

A rancid smell had started to permeate the air. Rotten meat with a hint of ammonia. Last time I smelt something like that, I went camping with my dad. Shot a buck right behind me. I can remember the sound of the bullet going past. He didn't even do anything with its corpse. He just slept by it for 3 days, and that dreadful smell grew. I didn't sleep a wink, instead I watched it at night, imagining it jerking to life and taking its revenge. At the time, I wanted it to.

It was one of the last times I ever went camping with him. Thankfully.

The crunches were clear, coming from all sides. I wanted to look. I really did. Aaron, however, kept a hand on my back and was almost pushing me along.

So I kept looking forward.

I wanted someone to come past us, a regular person, just so we had some company. To prove that this wasn't real.

Then, we found out where the voice was.

A loud 'snap' of a twig echoed from right behind us.

It caught us so off-guard we halted to a stop. Whatever was following us did as well.

My heart hammered hard against my chest. It had been behind us the entire time.

It had ceased its warbling, and now, was completely silent. There was no breathing. Nothing.

I looked over at Aaron, pleading.

He looked at me back, eyes locked on my face. His breathing went quiet and he mouthed, ""*don't*"" to me.

I returned my gaze to the road ahead, and swallowed. I saw a marker on the left of me. We were close and could probably sprint to the exit.

I was running through each of the signs and where they were, when I heard a sound that sent an ice-cold shiver down my back.

""*Aaarrronnn*.""

The voice was so horribly familiar, yet so alien.

It was my own voice, deep and gravelly. It was like whatever was behind us drawing out the sounds, testing its ability.

Aaron bristled at the sound with a grimace.

It sounded so much like me, except it was throaty and aged.

It tried again, with a higher pitch. It sounded more like me, but just not quite.

The foul smell lingered, almost making me gag. It smelt so pungent and *strong*.

I believe now, that the smell was its breath. We didn't really smell anything like that before the voice came, and it must've been so close to us, we had began to pick up on the scent. I don't know.

My eyes made their way to Aaron's, who was looking at me back with a fear I had never seen before.

He mouthed to me, ""*run*.""

That's all I needed.

Before Aaron could react, I had already began sprinting down the trail, running as fast as my legs could take me. I jumped over the roots of the trees, trying not to fall.

I heard Aaron behind me, his feet stomping against the ground.

Soon, my legs were aching and my heart was desperately thudding, trying to keep up with the fact that I had sprinting for a while. I'm a desk jockey and do zero cardio, okay?

I ran, and ran, and ran.

I kept frantically looking for the markers, hell, I was looking for the exit.

Nothing but the endless rows of pine trees and the odd bushes dotted around.

I had to stop.

I didn't know where I was and the sounds had gone quiet. *Surely* it would be okay for me to turn around.

So I slowed to stop, legs wobbling from the adrenaline. I turned around and scanned the area. Aaron was nowhere to be seen.

I had lost him.

My stomach dropped to the fucking floor.

I spun around and watched. He was nowhere.

How had I gone the wrong way? This trail has one road. I didn't change trail or reach any crossroads but somehow I had managed to go *further* into the woods. It was impossible for me to not be at the opening.

I took in huge gulps of air and started to shoot my head around and yell out for Aaron. My throat hurt so much.

It was useless, really.

My mind began to race, I had to figure out how to find the exit.

I stood up and breathed in.

""*Aaron?*""

My blood froze.

In my panic, I had totally neglected the fact I wasn't alone.

The voice was ridiculously close to mine now, and the only thing holding it back from being an identical copy was the fact it hadn't nailed down my accent.

I have a southern accent. This voice had something akin to someone with Valley Girl accent trying to do a southern one.

It was terrible impression, but it genuinely sounded like something I would come out with.

Aaron himself has an accent close to the Valley Girl one, so if anything, it sounded like Aaron mocking me.

Then, the next sound it made caused me to jump so far in the air, my knees cracked when I landed.

It made the sound of a car horn honking.

It was so ear-piercing and loud, my ears rang afterwards.

It was short and punchy, like a little, 'pip' you'd do if the person in front hadn't moved when the lights go green.

Now, I would've laughed at that. '*It's a car now?*"" I would've thought.

Instead, I thought, ""It's *our* car now?""

The warning beep I had given the deer that night, just rang out in the middle of the woods.

It did it again, louder this time.

I think it was trying to make me scream or something, because it kept making me jump when it did that.

It kept on hopping from one place to another, searching for me.

When it closer, I backed up to one of the pines and held my breath.

For all I knew, it could've been behind me.

I just breathed. I kept my eyes forward like Aaron told me to, and breathed.  *In, out. In, out.* It's all I could do.

The place went silent again, fear swirling in my stomach. I thought it found me.

Then, I felt something touch my shoulder. The fingers were long and they buried themselves into the flesh.

Slowly, my eyes crept towards the hand, until eventually I followed the arm.

It went up above me.

When I saw what was there, I nearly screamed.

There, crouched on one of the bigger branches of the pine, was Aaron with a finger to his lips.

He held out his hand and braced himself against the branch, moving from a crouch to a seated position.

I grabbed the hand hard, pushing myself upwards and towards the branch just below him.

My right foot made it onto the branch, and I reached up with my left hand. Aaron pulled me upwards, careful to not fall himself.

Just as I thought I had made it safely onto the branch below, my left foot slipped and I smashed my knee against the bark.

I bit back a yelp and bared my teeth. Holy shit, that hurt.

I didn't even want to imagine looking down, so I weakly pulled my leg back up and made my way up the tree.

The voice was further away now, the sound of Aaron's voice calling for me.

It made us shudder.

Eventually, we made it to a branch high enough to be safe, and thick enough to hold us. We could see the ground through the gaps of the needles.

I took a seat and looked at my knee.

Blood made my blue leggings go a vile purple. Scratches in the fabric showed my ripped skin, as deep red trickled from the gashes. It stung like hell.

Aaron placed a hand on my lower back and kissed my forehead. I fell into his touch and put my head into his neck.

Wet dribbles of tears dripped into my scalp. Aaron was crying.

He was always the more emotional one out of us. We established that quite early in our relationship when Aaron had held me, bawling over a nature documentary where a lion took down a gazelle. That was our second date.

I can remember how I stared at him with disgust. A few years later, and I still do, but now I hug him back and laugh.

Growing up in a poor household teaches you to control your emotions. One wrong look and shit hits the fan.

I guess that's what drew me to Aaron in the first place. He did stuff like that and nothing happened. His parents would chuckle instead of screaming at him.

It was the nicest kind of weird I have ever experienced.

The voice had rounded back to our tree and it was back to mimicking me.

""*Mooooveee.*"" Once again using what I told it last night to coax us out.

It did this for about a minute, and then we saw a flash of a brown blur speed past the tree. The blur waddled backwards, reversing.

Then, I saw it.

This deer, wasn't a deer. We established this. But, it didn't make the reveal any less horrifying.

It didn't look at us, and was looking deep into the forest. Then it heard something and faced our way.

Its eyes weren't on the sides of its head.

They were at the front, like a predator.

Like a human.

They didn't look human. They were regular deer eyes, which I feel made it worse. Small, and beady.

The sun was just setting, so the last bits of light reflected off the eyes.

Once darkness began to hit, they changed. In the light of the sunset, I squinted and saw how it shook its head around violently. It looked up in an instant and faced away from the tree. Then it turned, and I saw how it's eyes were blown out. Visibly they had grown a lot, and now they were almost black. Better for searching. It spun around again, and leapt off into the undergrowth.

I heard a roaring sound before I heard a voice I didn't recognise.

It was a little boy.

""*Aaron!*""

Aaron let out a gasp and slapped his hand over his mouth. Tears were in full flow now and his hands were shaking.

""*Over here!*""

Then a giggle, a child-like cough, and a the worst sound of the lot:

A young boy screaming bloody murder.

Aaron clapped his hands over his ears and sucked in wet breaths. I wrapped my arms around him, stroking his flank.

I could hear him muttering, ""it's not 'Jake', it's not him"" over and over.

""*Aaron!*"" It continued to wail, ""*Mom, dad!*""

It was fucking awful.

It's voice kept on wavering back and forth between voices. It had seemingly perfected the ""Jake"" voice, as Aaron kept on choking on his breath whenever it copied the boy.

It had pretty much decided that we were close, because it stayed in the same position for the rest of the time we were up there, right next to the tree we were in. The sun had set fully then, so it was hard to see anything. My eyes adjusted, but it was still difficult.

It went on and on, draining the pair of us. It got to the point where we were used to the screams, and now realised that whatever was making the voices was doing it on a loop like a broken record.

My voice, Aaron's, unknown boy, and then ""Jake"".

It was so mentally draining, I was fully considering jumping down and getting it over and done with.

At least I would be dying or going missing with the one I loved. As dismal as that seems, I really couldn't think of anything else in that moment. It messed with me.

As soon as I was going to close my eyes, a loud 'bang' shot through the air.

We heard a loud, warbling scream and the thundering sound of feet underneath.

Aaron looked at me, eyes red from the crying. His face was full of waiting relief.

A gruff voice yelled our full names and ran around the tree. A couple more pairs of feet followed.

This had to be the rangers. ""Up here!"" I called down to them.

The flashlight beams shone around until they brought them up to our tree.

Thankfully, it *was* the rangers.

We clambered down, and were greeted with the sight of 3 park rangers and Aaron's dad, their faces ashy.

I almost fell to my knees in joy and exhaustion. Aaron just caught me at the last second and choked out a sob.

We had been found.

Aaron carried me back to the entrance of the woods. The place looked so different in the dark.

Aaron's mom was waiting for us with the other officers. She had been in floods of tears too, immediately running towards us.

I had never felt so tired in my entire life.

One of the officers took us to the hospital. I had splinters all in the gashes and my muscles were exposed. Seriously gross shit, but nothing was broken, so I wasn't worried.

Everything happened so fast, y'know?

Aaron was fine, and that's all I cared about.

It was our anniversary after all.

It may surprise you to find out we headed home the very next day.

We were quiet on the way back. I had so many questions to ask, but with one look at Aaron's face, I faced forward and closed my eyes.

We were both too tired for talking.

Once we got home, Aaron checked the house and collapsed on our bed. I stayed up and numbly watched a crappy comedy. No matter how much I watched, I could still hear the screams.

Sometime I dropped off. Don't know when, but when I woke up, Aaron was boiling some water and the smell of coffee wafted its way to the living room.

He walked in and handed me a cup, pressing a soft kiss to my temple with a warm smile.

We sat in silence dumbly watching the TV, when he sighed. ""I'm sorry I took you there.""

I cocked my head. ""It wasn't your fault.""

Silence.

""I knew what was in there.""

I held the cup of coffee and stared at him. *What?*

He sniffled and coughed, ""I remembered everything.""

""What?""

He turned to me, eyes watery, ""Seeing it again,"" he shook his head, ""everything came back.""

*What did that even mean?*

I opened my mouth before Aaron spoke again, ""they told me his family moved away.""

His eyes were glassy now, swimming with memories.

""Jake's family?"" I was gentle, hoping to not set him off crying.

He nodded and took a sip of the coffee. ""One day he was there, the next he wasn't.""

""Now you know why?""

He nodded again morosely.

We sat there for a while.

""We were camping for our birthday? We had the same birthday,"" Aaron looked up, recounting the events liked they happened yesterday, ""It was our 12th.""

I let him speak.

""We were so excited, 'Elle',"" his eyes fluttered, ""then we heard it.""

""The deer?""

""Yeah, 'the *deer*'"" he let out a cruel laugh, ""if only.""

""What happened?""

He took another sip before he started up again. ""It called to us in our own voices, saying stuff like '*over here!*' and our names."" Aaron placed the cup on the table, ""we thought it was funny.""

""I get that, you were kids.""

""Yeah, well, we found it so funny, we asked it to come out and wish us happy birthday.""

""And?""

""I have never seen something more horrible in my entire life,"" he shook slightly, face gradually going pale, ""we screamed.""

So it didn't look like a deer. Or it did, and we just didn't see it's '*real form*'.

""We ran away, or I did? It's hard to remember,"" he wet his lips, ""I *can* remember hearing Jake fall and I turned to look at him.""

I reached over and rubbed his arm when he became emotional.

He brought a hand up to his lips and stared at a corner of the room, ""I ran over and tried to pull him up,"" he gasped, ""and it just batted me away, like a fly,"" his eyes were downcast. ""There was so much blood.""

He looked at me to respond, but I didn't and let him speak.

""It dragged him away, and I ran so far, ended up climbing a tree and camping there for a while.""

""How long?""

He shrugged. ""All I know was that I sat there until the sun went down and the noises stopped, then I ran home.""

""You tell your folks?""

He nodded sheepishly. ""They told the police, they went and checked it out, found blood and blamed it on a cougar."" He forced out a laugh, ""then it spoke to me.""

""It spoke to you?"" I was leaned forward in my seat now.

""Yes when I was about to drift off to sleep,"" he lowered his voice to a whisper, ""'I'll come back for you, then you can join him.'""

I swallowed thickly. *Why hadn't it came earlier for him? Was he trying to ripen him up?* It just made me feel sick. ""Did you see it again?""

""No, I stayed out of the woods, and it didn't bother me anymore.""

The air was thick, hard to breathe. It must've used this hike as a chance to take him.

""I could've saved him.""

""You were a kid, Aaron.""

""So fucking what?"" he snapped at me, ""*I could've saved him*.""

""Could you?""

He paused and watched me intently.

His eyes bounced from one side the next, seemingly going through every possible outcome. With a furrow of his brow, I guess he realised that he couldn't have done anything.

He sat back in his seat on the sofa. His eyes were still cloudy, clearly still thinking.

I leaned over and rested my head on his shoulder, holding his arm.

""Strange what the mind hides from you, huh?""

I didn't say anything. I mean what can you say to that?

We tried to get on with our lives. I went back to work, so did Aaron. We acted like we had the best anniversary of our lives, because what else could we do? Tell my manager that we had some kind of monster deer chase us down in the middle of the woods, and we kept hearing it mimicking us and Aaron's dead childhood friend? See how ridiculous that sounds?

So we put on our happy faces. It was harder for Aaron, obviously. He's looking to see a therapist. He's also talking with the police from his hometown over Jake's disappearance. Jake's parents are yet to say anything. Can't imagine what they're going through.

He told me he couldn't live with himself if he stayed quiet.

I try to look more on the positive side nowadays. I used to be very cynical, and I blame my upbringing for that. When I met Aaron, stuff changed. He was just so *enthusiastic* about life. Car broke down in the rain? Well, at least we have shelter. Lost your wallet? We can always get a new one. You feel guilty for cutting contact with your parents? You had to do that for your safety.

Always, he's been able to turn bad situations on their head, and find the silver lining in the cloud. Even if it's barely visible. He brought out that optimistic part me that I hid for so long. He helped me out of that horrible pit and made me see the light in life again.

Since that day, I've been seeing less and less of that 'happy-go-lucky' guy.

I'm not complaining at all by the way, please know that.

I'd be more disturbed if he just went on with life like nothing happened.

But, I feel like I've been taking him for granted. I want to help him through this. He helped me, so I'm going to help him too.

He assures me I don't need to, but I will anyway. I love him, and if that means I wait on every hand and foot for him, I'll fucking do it.

I thought we were in the clear after we left that place.

Turns out I was wrong.

This happened earlier today, and I'm still shook up writing this.

I was at home after work, and I went upstairs to go change. It looked like Aaron had just left before my arrival, because he left the bathroom light on.

I was about to flip the switch when I saw something.

It was a bit hard to see because of the frosted glass, but there was something outside.

It was a dark, fragmented blob.

I was tempted to open the window to see what it was, I mean, it could've been a piece of clothing that had came into the backyard.

Suddenly, a shiver ran down my spine and I writhed in my spot. I halted and watched the blob. It was completely still, which put doubt on my clothing theory. It was quite windy outside, so the clothing would've wafted around or flown off.

This thing stayed deathly still.

It had four little stumps under it like table legs. *Maybe* they were legs. Cats often came into our yard, with the next door neighbour having two of them.

It looked bigger than a cat, though. I blamed the frosted glass for the distortion, but that theory didn't last long either.

The thing began to move.

It lifted each of the stumps one by one, which now solidified my belief that this was indeed and animal, and then crouched down.

Then, much to my horror, the thing lifted itself up onto two legs, body rising high into the air.

It stood up straight, the stumps now longer. *What the fuck.*

It didn't wobble or fall, but instead went stiff as a board and raised it's fifth stump, which I figured out was it's neck.

So, this thing was either staring away from me or directly at me.

It was hard to see, but I *think* it was looking at me.

Then, an awful thought came to mind.

It couldn't be that deer. It couldn't.

The thing and I were just staring at each other, and I seriously hoped that it couldn't see me.

Then, I realised something.

I had the bathroom light on, and I was standing at the window.

It could definitely see me.

Thoughts of the screaming and hollering from that night played over and over in my mind. *Had it followed us home?*

My body tensed up, and refused to breathe. I had gone very much into prey-mode, and I was now trying my best to hide myself. Which, let's be honest, isn't going to go down well when you're stood under a spotlight.

I don't know how long I stayed there.

After a while, the thing gave up and, whilst still on it's hind legs, it staggered off into the bush behind the house.

I cried. I cried so hard.

I ended up squeezed into the corner of the bathroom, shaking like a leaf with tears running down my cheeks.

I can't remember the last time I cried like that. It must've been when I first moved in with Aaron and that was a long time ago.

After this release of pent-up emotion, I pulled myself together and called Aaron.

I gushed, spilling everything to him. I thought we'd lost connection because he was so quiet. He eventually told me he'd be home soon and that I should start to pack a bag.

I didn't have any time to respond before he hung up, and I was left baffled.

When he came home, he came into our bedroom and started piling clothes into his duffel.

""Where are we going?"" I asked, staring at my boyfriend in surprise. He had never been so serious before.

""I'll tell you in the car."" He didn't even bother looking away from his bag.

""Babe, what's going on?""

""*Shhh*,"" he shushed me sharply. ""I'll tell you in the car.""

I went back to folding my clothes, and chucking spare glances at him. His face was completely blank and his hands were working on autopilot.

We left the house that evening, as soon as we packed.

Is it bad to say that Aaron scared me a little? I had never seen this part of him, at all. It was almost like he was angry.

We got settled in the car and he pulled out of the driveway.

""Are you going to tell me where we're going now?""

He stayed quiet and faced the road.

""Aaron?"" I was getting irritated now.

He pursed his lips and flicked his eyes over to the rear-view mirror.

""Aaron, will you answer me?""

""*Shut up*."" He hissed, eyes bobbing from the rear-view to the windshield and back again.

I sat there speechless. That was the first time he had told me to shut up and meant it. There wasn't any venom behind the words and I didn't know what to make of it.

So, I did what I had learnt to do when people were pissed off.

I stayed quiet and, much to my shame, I dissociated.

He was stressed, and I was making things harder.

I think I must've dissociated for about an hour before I felt Aaron squeezing my shoulder.

We were outside a dive bar. I had no idea where we were.

""You okay, sweet?"" He was rubbing into the meat of my shoulder, face full of concern.

About an hour of time lost.

I heard him call my name and I woke up from that familiar trance.

""Where are we?""  It was  the only thing I was thinking about.

""Let's get inside first, yeah?""

Something in me just snapped. *What the fuck was this?*

""*No*,"" I bit, ""you tell me right now, Aaron.""

He threw his head back against the headrest and sighed. ""Can we just get inside, Elle?""

""Aaron, please,"" I stared right at him, ""I'm scared.""

It was rare for me to say that out loud. Aaron knew that.

He quickly looked all around the car, peeking in the windows, before he turned to me. He beckoned me close to him, and I obeyed.

Then he whispered something in my ear.

""It might still hear us.""

I had a full-body shiver and made my stomach fill with dread.

""So we need other people to block out conversation?"" I whispered back.

He nodded.

I understood, even if it sounded bizarre.

We grabbed a bite to eat and sat in the middle of the booths, multiple families chatting beside us. Finally, we could talk.

That leads me to now.

I'm sitting in the car, Aaron's driving.

In the span of a week, my life has been turned upside down. Life was good. It was good.

I was with the man I loved and away from all the shit in my life. My parents were out of my social circle, and Aaron's family took their place.

My life was *good*.

Now, we're running back to his hometown. It sounds stupid. However, there are a couple of reasons for this.

1. Home isn't safe anymore, that thing knows where we live
2. We would vacate to somewhere far off, like Japan, but money is *not good* at the moment, and even then, that thing could follow us to Japan (we have no idea where this thing can go)

Finally, 3. Aaron told his parents and they believed us, mainly because his dad saw the deer. They know someone. Someone who can help us.

Hopefully, that makes more sense as to why we've decided to head back.

We're going to stay to the highways, no backroads unless we have to.

Hopefully, that thing either stays away, or if it follows us, it gets ran over by a fucking truck.

It probably wouldn't kill it, but it would slow down, I hope.

I'm going to this post here. Aaron and I are in the car now, and we're close to the highway.

I just hope we get there safely. Wish us luck.",2,1770640453.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

To think you're important, is to think like a fool.

Dawn comes for us all. Find your breath... or suffocate.



**Prologue**

I enlisted for two years, twenty weeks. It was the shortest enlistment that I could find and it wasn't infantry. I was hoping for a cushy desk job or a quiet gate to skate by for two years of my enlistment. I only needed a job with benefits, and a way to escape from a decaying life at home. I threw a Hail Mary and I was the football being thrown wildly into fate's hands. Was I lucky? You can be the judge.

  


**Part I - The Routine and the Pull**



**Friday** 

Panama, 1991, approximately five miles from Fort Davis.

In a three-story building next to the old hospital at Coco Solo, better known as the Lone Coconut, I jolted awake, bolting to sit upright as if an internal alarm had detonated in my skull. It was always abrupt, like a shot of adrenaline straight to my soul. I sensed the dawn creeping in, and with it, the same relentless cycle. It begins again, as it always does.

I faded into the morning haze with the jungle’s steaminess pressing against the metal-framed windows like an external presence constantly fighting to get inside. The air conditioner hummed and clunked along, fighting a losing battle against the heat and humidity from outside. I shared this two-man room with Scott, the night-shift dispatcher at the Provost Marshal’s Office. I had gotten here first, so I claimed the window. He was stuck near the door, closer to the hallway noise.

For a brief second, I forgot where I was. The peace that sleep afforded me flickered away like a shadow fleeing the light. I rubbed my eyes hard with the heels of my palms, forcing the pressure back into my head. As I did, the details of my reality flooded back into my consciousness. The unattended child back home, the ex-wife, the money hemorrhaging out, and the endless months of this tour stretching ahead like a lifetime sentence when you’re young. The dread settled back in. I could feel the thickness of the weight throughout my body. The drum of my heartbeat pounding in my head, like a daily hangover.

I leaned over to my nightstand, grabbing my wristwatch. Shit, it was 04:53. I woke up later than usual. Luckily, Scott wouldn’t drag in until 06:15, so I wouldn’t have to hear his bitching about my smoking in the room again. I sat up on the edge of my twin bed. I snatched my half-soft pack of Marlboro Reds from the nightstand. I balanced the battered gold-plated Zippo that was lying on top of the pack. I removed a cigarette with my teeth and, with a smooth flick of muscle memory, flicked open my lighter, igniting my cigarette. At that moment, I decided it was going to be a good day. A deep inhale of smoke confirmed it. I took stock of the incoming day. Then I noticed that I had slept in my jeans again and on top of the covers. I hated making my bed, so I rarely covered up. I stared blankly through the double windows. I could see the jungle foliage rustling in the steady breeze outside and made note of the condensation streaking down the glass like vertical tears.

In my daily routine, I made note of my time left here in this place. My quick math in my head spat out six and a half months down, seventeen and a half to go on this tour of duty. It felt eternal, but I gave myself short goals to look forward to. So I declared it was going to be a quiet weekend, a good weekend. I told myself, if I said it, it must be true.

I was twenty-one years old. If I had to describe my looks, I was nondescript: nearly six foot one, brown hair, hazel eyes, pushing two hundred pounds. I was considered fat for the Army, but I carried it well with broad shoulders. I lived in the off-post barracks at Coco Solo, next to the old hospital. Only detachment military police personnel from the Headquarters and Headquarters Company, Law Enforcement Activity—better known as HHC, LEA—from Fort Clayton on the Pacific side lived in the barracks. We did have a few incoming senior NCOs staying with us as geo-bachelors until their housing was ready for them and their families to join. Coco Solo was US-controlled land on the Atlantic side of Panama. No fences, no guards, just a short road off the highway next to the old hospital, with a couple of bilingual warning signs to warn trespassers.

I tended to linger and daydream too much. I sighed and scanned my open wall locker for clothes to wear today. My battle dress uniforms hung in the wall locker inside transparent plastic dry-cleaning bags, mostly untouched. I had only worn them a few times. My daily wardrobe was usually dirty because I had to recycle them fast. I only had a few items. I never hung them up because they seemed to be constantly dirty unless I caught our barracks maid to wash them for me. I sifted through the wadded items on the bottom of the locker. I triaged and decided on a dark green T-shirt and a bright orange-and-yellow Hawaiian shirt. I threaded my brown leather belt through my jean loops, attaching my holster to the center of my back. I tucked my T-shirt in while keeping the Hawaiian shirt hanging open to hide the handgun holster. This was my daily outfit. As I bent over, I felt the pressure in my head pounding harder, and I could feel my face flush. I made another mental note that I needed coffee soon.

I took a slow, deep drag off my cigarette and exhaled it as I leaned down to fish out my worn Nikes out from under the bed. My socks were already tucked inside of them. As I slipped my socks on, I noticed a fresh bruise on my right ankle from my metal footboard again. I was too tall for this twin bed. I had to sleep catty-cornered or poke my feet through the bars of the footboard to fit on the bed. Welcome to my hell.

With my cigarette dangling, I slipped into the pre-tied shoes. I had only ever tied them once. When I first bought them, I tied them tight. Then I slipped them on for the life of the shoe. After a few good coughs and hacks that cleared my head, I stood up. I walked by Scott’s pristine side. It was always dress-right-dress, as usual. Good for him. I cupped my hand around my lit cigarette because smoking in common areas was forbidden. Out into the hallway. Right turn, down to the end into the shared bathroom. It was empty this early in the morning. I took a quick piss before heading out. I noticed it was dark yellow, another reminder why I felt like shit. As I was leaving the bathroom, I took one last cursory look into the mirror. I saw my hair was too long with a light beard coming in, and my general look was disheveled. My judgment was that I was fine and ready for the world. Time to report for duty.

Back into the hallway and down the stairs, I dug into my right front pocket for my car keys. They were entangled with my Balboa coins within my pocket. As I emerged from the building's side door onto the parking lot facing the hospital, I spotted my government-owned vehicle, or GOV. It was a midnight-blue four-door Toyota Corolla with blacked-out tinted windows. I could never remember exactly where I parked it last, so I had a habit of scanning the area. While I walked toward my car, I took a quick inspection of the exterior, then slid in. I immediately took the Ray-Bans down from the visor, followed by snatching up the warm Mountain Dew can in the middle console to enjoy the last swig of soda. I lowered the driver's side window as I pulled out. I flicked the cigarette butt onto the wet morning lawn. At the end of the driveway, I turned right onto the main road toward Colón. Colón was seven miles away. But I was going to Fort Davis, which was four miles away. I did love Colón; it was called the second city because it was the second largest city in Panama. I started to hype myself up for the day. I cranked the radio up and drove with the windows down.

This is a chronicle of a weekend in a life that I had lived, so far from home and on my own.

I’m validating a **Micro-SaaS idea** before investing real time and money, and I’d like blunt feedback from people who’ve built or sold B2B tools.

**The problem I’m targeting**  
Agencies, freelancers, and small sales teams still spend hours manually scraping Google Maps to build local lead lists (restaurants, dentists, gyms, etc.).  
Purchased lead databases are often outdated, incomplete, or full of dead leads.

**The idea**  
A lightweight SaaS that automates **Google Maps lead extraction** in real time.

You enter:

* Keyword (e.g. *Dentist*, *Coffee shop*)
* City (e.g. *Dubai*, *Jeddah*)

The tool returns:

* Business name
* Phone number
* Location
* Rating
* Website / email (when available)

**Key differences**

* No monthly subscription → **pay per lead (credits)**
* Live data pulled at search time (not pre-built lists)
* Built for agencies doing local outreach daily

**Target users**

* Digital marketing agencies
* Freelancers doing cold outreach
* Local service SaaS founders
* Sales reps targeting SMBs

**What I’m unsure about**

1. Is this market already too saturated (Outscraper, Apollo, Phantombuster, etc.)?
2. Would *pay-per-lead* actually convert better than subscriptions?
3. Is Google Maps scraping still a viable long-term play, or too fragile?
4. What would stop users from just using cheaper tools + spreadsheets?

I’m **not selling anything**, just validating before building.

If you’ve:

* Built a SaaS
* Sold to agencies
* Used lead-gen tools I’d really value your perspective.

A few things worth noting for anyone considering it:

* The DF64 Gen 2 does need some time to season before it really settles in.
* There is a learning curve with milk frothing on the GCP; it took me a bit to get consistent results.
* Additional accessories need to be purchased to pair with the GCP, like a tamper and a blind basket.

1. Cafe Latte

golden goose superstar
Got stopped twice at the bodega asking if these were real. Distressed toe looks intentional, not sloppy. But my arches screamed after 3 hours—cute, not comfy.

dior b30
Heavy as hell. Like, “did they pour concrete in the sole?” heavy. But that CD logo catches streetlight just right. Paired with black jeans and suddenly I look like I have a trust fund.

nike everyday socks
$ 15 for 3 pairs? Hard pass. First wash: one shrank to toddler size, second lost the swoosh like a sad sticker, third developed a heel hole before I even left the house. Felt like wearing tissue paper. Stick to Uniqlo. Or literally anything else.

stone island hoodie
That compass patch on the sleeve? Still crisp after two washes. Fabric’s thick enough for 50°F mornings but won’t cook you. Threw it on with jeans and called it a fit. Zero effort.

carhartt wip script hoodie
Feels like I stole it from my dad’s closet in 2003. Soft, slightly faded, zero stiffness. Wore it to grab coffee and felt weirdly confident. My cat’s currently napping in it. High praise.

corteiz superior hoodie
Back says “CORTEIZ” with a crown + French text I can’t pronounce. Front’s completely blank—love that. Stranger said “nice hoodie,” zero follow-up. Vibe over logo, always.

stussy grey crewneck
Tiny scribble logo on chest—barely visible unless you’re staring. Fit’s relaxed but not drowning me. Perfect for days I want to look intentional without screaming “I tried.”

nike x stussy sweatpants
Mini box logo on thigh = quiet flex. Elastic cuffs stay put, no sagging when I crouch for the dog. Wore these to walk the block and felt zero guilt about being comfy.

gallery dept painted flare pants
Splatter paint looks like I DIY’d after two beers… but cool. Black cuffs keep it from looking messy. Paired with a plain white tee—suddenly I’m in a street style pic. My mom would side-eye these. I adore them.

Anyway, the cat’s currently using the Carhartt as a bed. Guess that’s the real review.

The product idea seemed decent, i had this big vision, me and my cofounder have been working on it for the past 60 days. 

But i realized i spend too much time in my bedroom and i needed to get out and start building for cafes or coworking spaces so that i surround myself with the right people, good vibes and access to coffee. 

I tried a bunch of cafes that had great reviews but none of the reviews talk about power outlets at the cafe, the noise levels, and whether they allow laptops! 

Will they look at me weirdly if i order a single coffee and sit there for 4 hours?

and I saw a few posts on reddit, people asking the best places to have a meeting or build a business from or just go and work.

Pretty simple idea: upload a file, type what you want in plain English, AI does the work.

Started off great. Then it got messy. Really messy.

Every file format needed its own fallback logic. I'd fix a bug, next day the same bug would show up somewhere else. The frustrating part? These were bugs I'd literally fixed 5 days ago. I was going in circles.

One day I'm just sitting there with ChatGPT, asking random questions about my architecture problems. Don't even remember what I asked. But it gave me a link to some GitHub repo.

I pasted it into Cursor, told it to implement the approach. Tried my product again.

It was... night and day. Faster, more accurate, cleaner code. Turns out my whole architecture was wrong.

Here's the thing - if GPT hadn't randomly recommended that repo, I probably wouldn't have been able to build this product. Like, as a college student with limited experience, that one repo changed everything for me.

That got me thinking - how many other repos are out there that could solve problems I don't even know I have? How much am I reinventing wheels that already exist?

So I built [Repoverse](http://repoverse.space). It's basically Tinder for GitHub repos - swipe through repos that match your interests and what you're working on. Completely free. And main focus on repos which have 50-1000 stars kind of underrated

Not trying to sell anything, just genuinely think there's so much good code out there that we never discover because GitHub search is... yeah.

If you want to try it, cool. If you have better ways of discovering repos, I'm all ears honestly.

My boyfriend and I went hiking last weekend. It was for our anniversary, and we finally had some time off work to spend some time with one another.

My boyfriend, ""Aaron"", was so excited. He'd grown up in the mountains, and so, he loved the idea of us heading out to his hometown to hike. It was sweet seeing him this happy. We'd been in a bit of a slump in our relationship because of work. He'd been put on nights and I still worked days, so we rarely saw each other. We had tried our best to see each other at home, but it was hard.

This is exactly what we needed; some quality time together.

""You're gonna love this place,"" he had told me in the car, ""I promise.""

God, I wished that was true.

It took us about 4 hours to reach his hometown. Smooth sailing all things considered. Traffic was light, sun stayed up throughout and the tunes were *on point*.

It was your standard rural town. It was quiet and reserved, the place adorned with adorable little 'mom and pop' shops and a miniature fountain in the centre.

We found this cute little cabin on the outskirts of town. It was small, but unbelievably cosy when you put the fire on.

One thing that stood out to me was that the place was littered with huge pine trees. Aaron told me how proud he was when he climbed one of them as a kid. I shrugged it off. I mean, it's a tree. But, *holy shit*. I understood how amazing of a feat this was now. These things were *massive*.

They pierced through the clouds like giant shards of green. My neck killed after watching them for so long. I had never seen trees this big before. It was like they kept rising and rising and never stopped.

There were tons of snowy mountains too. They encircled the town like a mighty wall, protecting it from outside dangers. It was simply breathtaking.

Much different than the desert I grew up in.

His parents still lived there, so we went to their place for dinner when we finished unpacking.

They're a lovely couple. I hadn't eaten that well in a *while*. His mom made a spicy meatloaf and I ate so much of it, I had to pop my belt afterwards. Aaron couldn't really handle the spice, so it was hilarious seeing him gulp down litres of water in between each tiny morsel. His face was flushed after, and so was his dad's. They look so much like each other.

Once dinner was finished, we all sat in their living room, nursing glasses of wine. Aaron drank the rest of his water.

We left around 8PM. I can remember it because we wanted to head back before it was totally dark.

The sun was setting, plunging the streets into shadow. The moon had been up for a while and now it had began to shine beautifully against the darkening blue of the twilight sky.

Streetlamps hadn't been switched on yet, so we had to drive slowly and be on the lookout for people or animals.

The lights from the shops became pinpricks in the rear-view mirror and eventually we reached the western outskirts of the town.

I was lucky that Aaron knew the roads inside and out. I would've crashed as soon as we reversed out his parents' driveway. We were quiet on the trip back. I think we didn't know what to talk about.

""Well, I'm full."" Aaron's voice broke the silence.

""Yeah, me too."" I gave a soft laugh.

The car was noiseless again before we both spoke at the same time.

""Are you okay?"" We matched each other.

For the first time in a while, the pair of us laughed together. It was gentle, but genuine. It was nice.

""Yeah I'm okay,"" I giggled, ""you?""

""Yeah, not bad."" Aaron chuckled to himself, hands relaxing on the wheel.

The silence wasn't as tense anymore. We knew we were tired. That's all.

""The trail's going to look so pretty tomorrow."" he chirped, that big smile of his returning to his face.

I was going to say something when he immediately stuck his arm out and hit my chest, creating a barrier to hold me back .

He stomped his foot on the brake, hard. He had held his arm out across my chest to keep me from plummeting forward into the windshield.

It was so abrupt, I fell into his arm and had the air knocked out of my lungs.

When the car jolted to a stop, I snapped backwards against the seat, narrowly avoiding banging the back of my head into the headrest.

Aaron's arm was still shielding my chest when he fell backwards. Luckily, his head missed the headrest like myself and he slowly leaned his neck back to put his head against the leather.

We sat there, panting after the sudden stop.  Aaron was looking forward, eyebrows furrowed and his mouth contorted into an open scowl.

""Came out of nowhere."" He muttered under his breath.

I stared onwards, eyes fixated on the object in the road.

It was a deer.

She was an average doe; antlerless and she had pretty white freckles dotted on her back. She wasn't looking at us though. Her head was facing the road ahead of us.

Her ears were completely still. Not even a quiver at the sound of the car screeching to a halt.

""A deer?"" I gasped out.

Aaron had his lips pressed into a tight, thin line. I noticed his chest wasn't rising, and then came to the realisation that he was holding his breath.

His eyes were wobbling, tears forming. He hadn't blinked once since he  slammed the brakes.

In fact, he hadn't moved.

""What?"" He murmured in a wispy tone.

He was breathless.

I watched him with wary eyes, awaiting his reaction. I had never seen him this fearful before. It reminded me of a child staring into his closet when he heard a bump in the night.

We sat there for another few seconds before I decided to take action, and honk the horn.

Looking back, I think this was the worst thing I had ever done.

I pushed Aaron's arm towards him and I pressed harshly down on the horn, a quick 'beep' echoed into the woods.

I waited.

The doe didn't move.

I furrowed my brow, and started to feel a strange discomfort in my skin. It was as if I had done something stupid. Hell, even *illegal*.

This awful feeling ran up my neck. I was scared of a *deer* of all things. The woods were pitch-black by that point, and this unease made me want to head home as soon as we could. Aaron was obviously shaken.  I hated feeling so *afraid*.

So, out of embarrassment and anger, I yelled.

I fucking yelled at the deer.

I moved back over to my side of the car and put down the window. I leaned out of it and yelled with as much power as my vocal cords could muster, ""Move!""

Fear definitely put some power behind my voice.

As soon as the word left my lips, a rough hand ragged my shoulder back into the seat of my car. I looked back with confusion, only to see a horrified Aaron glaring at me.

He put the window up and hissed, ""what the hell are you doing?""

""It's a *deer*,"" I snapped back, desperate to get away from the road and head home, ""you haven't scared off a deer before?""

Aaron shook his head in disbelief and turned back to the animal. I did so too, hoping that the deer had taken the hint and galloped off back into the undergrowth.

It hadn't even flinched. The thing was still stuck there, neck twisted to the side and thin legs pin-straight.

The dread washed over me, sending a horrible shiver down my spine. Maybe it was deaf?

Then, as if it heard me think, the deer ran off in the most awful way possible. It made me recoil so far back in my seat, I was practically moving the chair back.

It kept its legs straight and lolloped back into the bushes, like a crappy stop-motion movie. The deer kept its head facing away from us, bobbing back and forth. It looked a spring bouncing around after you pull it back and let it go.

It was jarring seeing an elegant creature moving in such a disjointed way.

It was slow too, taking its time to carefully plod back into the woods.

Aaron and I looked at it disappear into the abyss of the pines, wide-eyed with disgust.

He continued to stare at the animal before I had to shake him out of whatever trance he was trapped in.

He shook his head and thrust the car into first gear, the pair of us eager to get into the cabin.

It took another 10 minutes for us to reach it. Aaron was driving slightly above the speed limit, but I didn't blame him. I kept thinking about any logical reasons as to why the doe had behaved like that.

When we eventually arrived, the pair of us speed-walked inside and locked the door. Aaron double-checked all the windows were locked and we stayed the night snuggled up in our bedroom watching a random drama on my laptop.

The thought of the deer was fading now, with my consciousness nailing the whole thing down to tiredness.

I had seen weird deer before. The idea of one being deaf or injured made more sense to me than it being anything unnatural.

It was our anniversary tomorrow, and that was the main thing on my mind.

Aaron, however, was twitchy all night. He was the one driving, so I could understand why he was unsettled. He's a good driver, and I guessed that he was shocked he didn't see the deer earlier.

The next morning was much better.

Aaron woke me up with a breakfast in bed, much to my delight. He seemed much more calm than the night before. There was still a hint of nervousness behind his eyes, but I shrugged it off. I can't describe the happiness I felt just *being there* with him.

The pair of us set off around 1, and the hike was supposed to last us for at least 2-3 hours, depending on how long our breaks would be.

It was supposed to be a wonderful couple of hours in nature.

It was much longer than that.

We told Aaron's parents that we'd be done by 4, and that we'd left a key under the doormat outside. We also told them which trail we were heading on, so they knew where we were if the worst would happen. They told us to look out for mountain lions, which we assured them we would.

I was eager to get out there, despite last night's events. It had been a while since I went hiking, but with Aaron by my side, I knew it was going to be a safe but fun trip.

The first half of the trek was perfect. We walked around the forest, the great pines covering the mossy floor in shadow. The place was teeming with life, with squirrels dashing past our heads in the trees and birds chirping sweet songs in our ears. Aaron tried whistling back, to little response.

""Guess my pitch is off."" He chuckled.

I gave it go, and surprisingly, a couple of birds twittered back. Aaron feigned shock and snatched me up, before running with me down the trail, shouting you, ""you can't have her!"" and, ""she's mine!""

I was in complete stitches, and laughed even harder when bewildered hikers walked past us, eyebrows raised and some giggling at our frantic display.

At the end of the first half of the hike, we were rewarded with a scene of a beautiful lake. It was around there we stopped for a quick break. We sat on the side of the trail, watching the sun shimmering on the surface of the water. There were people all over it. Some were on canoes, some were windsurfing. Quite a lot of people swimming actually. I could see their little heads bobbing around in the water.

I think I took 20 pictures of the place.

We stayed there awhile before we set off back down the trail.

The sun wouldn't go down for a while, so we took our time.

I had completely forgotten about what happened last night. Aaron seemed a little bit on edge but he was still grinning ear to ear. Sometimes I would see him look behind us. He disguised it as looking at me, but I kind of knew the real reason.

The thought of that deer was still playing on his mind.

In hindsight, I should've been more cautious too. Aaron lived here all his childhood, so he knew what was normal round those woods.

If Aaron was still anxious, I should've been too.

The trail was still relatively busy. It was still early afternoon, so most people probably started hiking then.

We'd walk past them, greeting fellow travelers. We could hear them behind us chatting about work or who's birthday it was that week. Normal things.

We had less than an half an hour left on our way back, and Aaron texted his parents to let them know.

I looked up at the pines. The sun's rays tried their hardest to shine through the dense needles, showering the floor with little pinpricks of light.

Then I heard a voice.

It came from *somewhere*. I originally thought it came from in front of us; it could've been a hiker coming up the trail.

The voice was faint, hardly above a whisper. Although I would call it more of a groan. It was a rattling sound.

I didn't think anything of it and waited to see who was walking up the trail. We went on, smiles still stretched across our faces.

Unfortunately, no one ever walked past.

I could see Aaron tense his shoulders. He stuck his hand out and waggled it, prompting me to take it.

I sped up and walked closer to him, holding his hand. He didn't look down at me, but he acknowledged my presence with a squeeze of my hand.

I was going to turn and see if it someone messing with us, but Aaron squeezed my hand again, and looked at me with big eyes. He gave a soft shake of his head and gestured with his eyes to remain looking ahead.

The voice grew louder the more we walked. It wasn't actually saying much, just a bunch of babbling. Sharp breaths punctuated every syllable. It kept changing its intonation too. One moment it would be as happy as a child, letting out stifled giggles, other times it would be nervously whimpering. Sometimes it would be angry. Like letting out growls and cut-off yelps.

It was almost as if it were speaking to us from all angles. Sometimes hisses would come from the left. Some gasps would come from the right. It wanted us to look at it.

It got colder. The sun was still high in the sky, but a grim, cold wind had picked up, and I ended up having to put my hands in my pockets.

We entered an area where there was debris on the ground. Needles and sticks, that kind of thing. We walked a bit faster through this part, hoping to reach the exit as quickly as possible. We had be less than 15 minutes away now, so we were close. Along with the crunching underfoot, the voice followed us.

It was getting more vocal now, yipping and letting out whoops. Couldn't tell if they were happy screams or annoyed ones.

It was close to us, though. *Horribly close*.

A rancid smell had started to permeate the air. Rotten meat with a hint of ammonia. Last time I smelt something like that, I went camping with my dad. Shot a buck right behind me. I can remember the sound of the bullet going past. He didn't even do anything with its corpse. He just slept by it, and that dreadful smell grew throughout the night. I didn't sleep a wink, instead I watched it, imagining it jerking to life and taking its revenge. At the time, I wanted it to.

It was one of the last times I ever went camping with him. Thankfully.

The crunches were clear, coming from all sides. I wanted to look. I really did. Aaron, however, kept a hand on my back and was almost pushing me along.

So I kept looking forward.

I wanted someone to come past us, a regular person, just so we had some company. To prove that this wasn't real.

Then, we found out where the voice was.

A loud 'snap' of a twig echoed from right behind us.

It caught us so off-guard we halted to a stop. Whatever was following us did as well.

My heart hammered hard against my chest. It had been behind us the entire time.

It had ceased its warbling, and now, was completely silent. There was no breathing. Nothing.

I looked over at Aaron, pleading.

He looked at me back, eyes locked on my face. His breathing went quiet and he mouthed, ""*don't*"" to me.

I returned my gaze to the road ahead, and swallowed. I saw a marker on the left of me. We were close and could probably sprint to the exit.

I was running through each of the signs and where they were, when I heard a sound that sent an ice-cold shiver down my back.

""*Aaarrronnn*.""

The voice was so horribly familiar, yet so alien.

It was my own voice, deep and gravelly. It was like whatever was behind us drawing out the sounds, testing its ability.

Aaron bristled at the sound with a grimace.

It sounded so much like me, except it was throaty and aged.

It tried again, with a higher pitch. It sounded more like me, but just not quite.

The foul smell lingered, almost making me gag. It smelt so pungent and *strong*.

I believe now, that the smell was its breath. We didn't really smell anything like that before the voice came, and it must've been so close to us, we had began to pick up on the scent. I don't know.

My eyes made their way to Aaron's, who was looking at me back with a fear I had never seen before.

He mouthed to me, ""*run*.""

That's all I needed.

Before Aaron could react, I had already began sprinting down the trail, running as fast as my legs could take me. I jumped over the roots of the trees, trying not to fall.

I heard Aaron behind me, his feet stomping against the ground.

Soon, my legs were aching and my heart was desperately thudding, trying to keep up with the fact that I had sprinting for a while. I'm a desk jockey and do zero cardio, okay?

I ran, and ran, and ran.

I kept frantically looking for the markers, hell, I was looking for the exit.

Nothing but the endless rows of pine trees and the odd bushes dotted around.

I had to stop.

I didn't know where I was and the sounds had gone quiet. *Surely* it would be okay for me to turn around.

So I slowed to stop, legs wobbling from the adrenaline. I turned around and scanned the area. Aaron was nowhere to be seen.

I had lost him.

My stomach dropped to the fucking floor.

I spun around and watched. He was nowhere.

How had I gone the wrong way? This trail has one road. I didn't change trail or reach any crossroads but somehow I had managed to go *further* into the woods. It was impossible for me to not be at the opening.

I took in huge gulps of air and started to shoot my head around and yell out for Aaron. My throat hurt so much.

It was useless, really.

My mind began to race, I had to figure out how to find the exit.

I stood up and breathed in.

""*Aaron?*""

My blood froze.

In my panic, I had totally neglected the fact I wasn't alone.

The voice was ridiculously close to mine now, and the only thing holding it back from being an identical copy was the fact it hadn't nailed down my accent.

I have a southern accent. This voice had something akin to someone with Valley Girl accent trying to do a southern one.

It was terrible impression, but it genuinely sounded like something I would come out with.

Aaron himself has an accent close to the Valley Girl one, so if anything, it sounded like Aaron mocking me.

Then, the next sound it made caused me to jump so far in the air, my knees cracked when I landed.

It made the sound of a car horn honking.

It was so ear-piercing and loud, my ears rang afterwards.

It was short and punchy, like a little, 'pip' you'd do if the person in front hadn't moved when the lights go green.

Now, I would've laughed at that. '*It's a car now?*"" I would've thought.

Instead, I thought, ""It's *our* car now?""

The warning beep I had given the deer that night, just rang out in the middle of the woods.

It did it again, louder this time.

I think it was trying to make me scream or something, because it kept making me jump when it did that.

It kept on hopping from one place to another, searching for me.

When it closer, I backed up to one of the pines and held my breath.

For all I knew, it could've been behind me.

I just breathed. I kept my eyes forward like Aaron told me to, and breathed.  *In, out. In, out.* It's all I could do.

The place went silent again, fear swirling in my stomach. I thought it found me.

Then, I felt something touch my shoulder. The fingers were long and they buried themselves into the flesh.

Slowly, my eyes crept towards the hand, until eventually I followed the arm.

It went up above me.

When I saw what was there, I nearly screamed.

There, crouched on one of the bigger branches of the pine, was Aaron with a finger to his lips.

He held out his hand and braced himself against the branch, moving from a crouch to a seated position.

I grabbed the hand hard, pushing myself upwards and towards the branch just below him.

My right foot made it onto the branch, and I reached up with my left hand. Aaron pulled me upwards, careful to not fall himself.

Just as I thought I had made it safely onto the branch below, my left foot slipped and I smashed my knee against the bark.

I bit back a yelp and bared my teeth. Holy shit, that hurt.

I didn't even want to imagine looking down, so I weakly pulled my leg back up and made my way up the tree.

The voice was further away now, the sound of Aaron's voice calling for me.

It made us shudder.

Eventually, we made it to a branch high enough to be safe, and thick enough to hold us. We could see the ground through the gaps of the needles.

I took a seat and looked at my knee.

Blood made my blue leggings go a vile purple. Scratches in the fabric showed my ripped skin, as deep red trickled from the gashes. It stung like hell.

Aaron placed a hand on my lower back and kissed my forehead. I fell into his touch and put my head into his neck.

Wet dribbles of tears dripped into my scalp. Aaron was crying.

He was always the more emotional one out of us. We established that quite early in our relationship when Aaron had held me, bawling over a nature documentary where a lion took down a gazelle. That was our second date.

I can remember how I stared at him with disgust. A few years later, and I still do, but now I hug him back and laugh.

Growing up in a poor household teaches you to control your emotions. One wrong look and shit hits the fan.

I guess that's what drew me to Aaron in the first place. He did stuff like that and nothing happened. His parents would chuckle instead of screaming at him.

It was the nicest kind of weird I have ever experienced.

The voice had rounded back to our tree and it was back to mimicking me.

""*Mooooveee.*"" Once again using what I told it last night to coax us out.

It did this for about a minute, and then we saw a flash of a brown blur speed past the tree. The blur waddled backwards, reversing.

Then, I saw it.

This deer, wasn't a deer. We established this. But, it didn't make the reveal any less horrifying.

It didn't look at us, and was looking deep into the forest. Then it heard something and faced our way.

Its eyes weren't on the sides of its head.

They were at the front, like a predator.

Like a human.

They didn't look human. They were regular deer eyes, which I feel made it worse. Small, and beady.

The sun was just setting, so the last bits of light reflected off the eyes.

Once darkness began to hit, they changed. In the light of the sunset, I squinted and saw how it shook its head around violently. It looked up in an instant and faced away from the tree. Then it turned, and I saw how it's eyes were blown out. Visibly they had grown a lot, and now they were almost black. Better for searching. It spun around again, and leapt off into the undergrowth.

I heard a roaring sound before I heard a voice I didn't recognise. 

It was a little boy. 

""*Aaron!*""

Aaron let out a gasp and slapped his hand over his mouth. Tears were in full flow now and his hands were shaking.

""*Over here!*""

Then a giggle, a child-like cough, and a the worst sound of the lot:

A young boy screaming bloody murder.

Aaron clapped his hands over his ears and sucked in wet breaths. I wrapped my arms around him, stroking his flank.

I could hear him muttering, ""it's not 'Jake', it's not him"" over and over.

""*Aaron!*"" It continued to wail, ""*Mom, dad!*""

It was fucking awful.

It's voice kept on wavering back and forth between voices. It had seemingly perfected the ""Jake"" voice, as Aaron kept on choking on his breath whenever it copied the boy.

It had pretty much decided that we were close, because it stayed in the same position for the rest of the time we were up there, right next to the tree we were in. The sun had set fully then, so it was hard to see anything. My eyes adjusted, but it was still difficult.

It went on and on, draining the pair of us. It got to the point where we were used to the screams, and now realised that whatever was making the voices was doing it on a loop like a broken record.

My voice, Aaron's, unknown boy, and then ""Jake"".

It was so mentally draining, I was fully considering jumping down and getting it over and done with.

At least I would be dying or going missing with the one I loved. As dismal as that seems, I really couldn't think of anything else in that moment. It messed with me.

As soon as I was going to close my eyes, a loud 'bang' shot through the air.

We heard a loud, warbling scream and the thundering sound of feet underneath.

Aaron looked at me, eyes red from the crying. His face was full of waiting relief.

A gruff voice yelled our full names and ran around the tree. A couple more pairs of feet followed.

This had to be the rangers. ""Up here!"" I called down to them.

The flashlight beams shone around until they brought them up to our tree.

Thankfully, it *was* the rangers.

We clambered down, and were greeted with the sight of 3 park rangers and Aaron's dad, their faces ashy.

I almost fell to my knees in joy and exhaustion. Aaron just caught me at the last second and choked out a sob.

We had been found.

Aaron carried me back to the entrance of the woods. The place looked so different in the dark.

Aaron's mom was waiting for us with the other officers. She had been in floods of tears too, immediately running towards us.

I had never felt so tired in my entire life.

One of the officers took us to the hospital. I had splinters all in the gashes and my muscles were exposed. Seriously gross shit, but nothing was broken, so I wasn't worried.

Everything happened so fast, y'know?

Aaron was fine, and that's all I cared about.

It was our anniversary after all.

It may surprise you to find out we headed home the very next day.

We were quiet on the way back. I had so many questions to ask, but with one look at Aaron's face, I faced forward and closed my eyes.

We were both too tired for talking.

Once we got home, Aaron checked the house and collapsed on our bed. I stayed up and numbly watched a crappy comedy. No matter how much I watched, I could still hear the screams.

Sometime I dropped off. Don't know when, but when I woke up, Aaron was boiling some water and the smell of coffee wafted its way to the living room.

He walked in and handed me a cup, pressing a soft kiss to my temple with a warm smile.

We sat in silence dumbly watching the TV, when he sighed. ""I'm sorry I took you there.""

I cocked my head. ""It wasn't your fault.""

Silence.

""I knew what was in there.""

I held the cup of coffee and stared at him. *What?*

He sniffled and coughed, ""I remembered everything.""

""What?""

He turned to me, eyes watery, ""Seeing it again,"" he shook his head, ""everything came back.""

*What did that even mean?*

I opened my mouth before Aaron spoke again, ""they told me his family moved away.""

His eyes were glassy now, swimming with memories.

""Jake's family?"" I was gentle, hoping to not set him off crying.

He nodded and took a sip of the coffee. ""One day he was there, the next he wasn't.""

""Now you know why?""

He nodded again morosely.

We sat there for a while.

""We were camping for our birthday? We had the same birthday,"" Aaron looked up, recounting the events liked they happened yesterday, ""It was our 12th.""

I let him speak.

""We were so excited, 'Elle',"" his eyes fluttered, ""then we heard it.""

""The deer?""

""Yeah, 'the *deer*'"" he let out a cruel laugh, ""if only.""

""What happened?""

He took another sip before he started up again. ""It called to us in our own voices, saying stuff like '*over here!*' and our names."" Aaron placed the cup on the table, ""we thought it was funny.""

""I get that, you were kids.""

""Yeah, well, we found it so funny, we asked it to come out and wish us happy birthday.""

""And?""

""I have never seen something more horrible in my entire life,"" he shook slightly, face gradually going pale, ""we screamed.""

So it didn't look like a deer. Or it did, and we just didn't see it's '*real form*'.

""We ran away, or I did? It's hard to remember,"" he wet his lips, ""I *can* remember hearing Jake fall and I turned to look at him.""

I reached over and rubbed his arm when he became emotional.

He brought a hand up to his lips and stared at a corner of the room, ""I ran over and tried to pull him up,"" he gasped, ""and it just batted me away, like a fly,"" his eyes were downcast. ""There was so much blood.""

He looked at me to respond, but I didn't and let him speak.

""It dragged him away, and I ran so far, ended up climbing a tree and camping there for a while.""

""How long?""

He shrugged. ""All I know was that I sat there until the sun went down and the noises stopped, then I ran home.""

""You tell your folks?""

He nodded sheepishly. ""They told the police, they went and checked it out, found blood and blamed it on a cougar."" He forced out a laugh, ""then it spoke to me.""

""It spoke to you?"" I was leaned forward in my seat now.

""Yes when I was about to drift off to sleep,"" he lowered his voice to a whisper, ""'I'll come back for you, then you can join him.'""

I swallowed thickly. *Why hadn't it came earlier for him? Was he trying to ripen him up?* It just made me feel sick. ""Did you see it again?""

""No, I stayed out of the woods, and it didn't bother me anymore.""

The air was thick, hard to breathe. It must've used this hike as a chance to take him.

""I could've saved him.""

""You were a kid, Aaron.""

""So fucking what?"" he snapped at me, ""*I could've saved him*.""

""Could you?""

He paused and watched me intently.

His eyes bounced from one side the next, seemingly going through every possible outcome. With a furrow of his brow, I guess he realised that he couldn't have done anything.

He sat back in his seat on the sofa. His eyes were still cloudy, clearly still thinking.

I leaned over and rested my head on his shoulder, holding his arm.

""Strange what the mind hides from you, huh?""

I didn't say anything. I mean what can you say to that?

We tried to get on with our lives. I went back to work, so did Aaron. We acted like we had the best anniversary of our lives, because what else could we do? Tell my manager that we had some kind of monster deer chase us down in the middle of the woods, and we kept hearing it mimicking us and Aaron's dead childhood friend? See how ridiculous that sounds?

So we put on our happy faces. It was harder for Aaron, obviously. He's looking to see a therapist. He's also talking with the police from his hometown over Jake's disappearance. Jake's parents are yet to say anything. Can't imagine what they're going through.

He told me he couldn't live with himself if he stayed quiet.

I try to look more on the positive side nowadays. I used to be very cynical, and I blame my upbringing for that. When I met Aaron, stuff changed. He was just so *enthusiastic* about life. Car broke down in the rain? Well, at least we have shelter. Lost your wallet? We can always get a new one. You feel guilty for cutting contact with your parents? You had to do that for your safety.

Always, he's been able to turn bad situations on their head, and find the silver lining in the cloud. Even if it's barely visible. He brought out that optimistic part me that I hid for so long. He helped me out of that horrible pit and made me see the light in life again.

Since that day, I've been seeing less and less of that 'happy-go-lucky' guy.

I'm not complaining at all by the way, please know that.

I'd be more disturbed if he just went on with life like nothing happened.

But, I feel like I've been taking him for granted. I want to help him through this. He helped me, so I'm going to help him too.

He assures me I don't need to, but I will anyway. I love him, and if that means I wait on every hand and foot for him, I'll fucking do it.

I thought we were in the clear after we left that place.

Turns out I was wrong.

This happened earlier today, and I'm still shook up writing this.

I was at home after work, and I went upstairs to go change. It looked like Aaron had just left before my arrival, because he left the bathroom light on.

I was about to flip the switch when I saw something.

It was a bit hard to see because of the frosted glass, but there was something outside.

It was a dark, fragmented blob.

I was tempted to open the window to see what it was, I mean, it could've been a piece of clothing that had came into the backyard.

Suddenly, a shiver ran down my spine and I writhed in my spot. I halted and watched the blob. It was completely still, which put doubt on my clothing theory. It was quite windy outside, so the clothing would've wafted around or flown off.

This thing stayed deathly still.

It had four little stumps under it like table legs. *Maybe* they were legs. Cats often came into our yard, with the next door neighbour having two of them.

It looked bigger than a cat, though. I blamed the frosted glass for the distortion, but that theory didn't last long either.

The thing began to move.

It lifted each of the stumps one by one, which now solidified my belief that this was indeed and animal, and then crouched down.

Then, much to my horror, the thing lifted itself up onto two legs, body rising high into the air.

It stood up straight, the stumps now longer. *What the fuck.*

It didn't wobble or fall, but instead went stiff as a board and raised it's fifth stump, which I figured out was it's neck.

So, this thing was either staring away from me or directly at me.

It was hard to see, but I *think* it was looking at me.

Then, an awful thought came to mind.

It couldn't be that deer. It couldn't.

The thing and I were just staring at each other, and I seriously hoped that it couldn't see me.

Then, I realised something.

I had the bathroom light on, and I was standing at the window.

It could definitely see me.

Thoughts of the screaming and hollering from that night played over and over in my mind. *Had it followed us home?*

My body tensed up, and refused to breathe. I had gone very much into prey-mode, and I was now trying my best to hide myself. Which, let's be honest, isn't going to go down well when you're stood under a spotlight.

I don't know how long I stayed there.

After a while, the thing gave up and, whilst still on it's hind legs, it staggered off into the bush behind the house.

I cried. I cried so hard.

I ended up squeezed into the corner of the bathroom, shaking like a leaf with tears running down my cheeks.

I can't remember the last time I cried like that. It must've been when I first moved in with Aaron and that was a long time ago.

After this release of pent-up emotion, I pulled myself together and called Aaron.

I gushed, spilling everything to him. I thought we'd lost connection because he was so quiet. He eventually told me he'd be home soon and that I should start to pack a bag.

I didn't have any time to respond before he hung up, and I was left baffled.

When he came home, he came into our bedroom and started piling clothes into his duffel.

""Where are we going?"" I asked, staring at my boyfriend in surprise. He had never been so serious before.

""I'll tell you in the car."" He didn't even bother looking away from his bag.

""Babe, what's going on?""

""*Shhh*,"" he shushed me sharply. ""I'll tell you in the car.""

I went back to folding my clothes, and chucking spare glances at him. His face was completely blank and his hands were working on autopilot.

We left the house that evening, as soon as we packed.

Is it bad to say that Aaron scared me a little? I had never seen this part of him, at all. It was almost like he was angry.

We got settled in the car and he pulled out of the driveway.

""Are you going to tell me where we're going now?""

He stayed quiet and faced the road.

""Aaron?"" I was getting irritated now.

He pursed his lips and flicked his eyes over to the rear-view mirror.

""Aaron, will you answer me?""

""*Shut up*."" He hissed, eyes bobbing from the rear-view to the windshield and back again.

I sat there speechless. That was the first time he had told me to shut up and meant it. There wasn't any venom behind the words and I didn't know what to make of it.

So, I did what I had learnt to do when people were pissed off.

I stayed quiet and, much to my shame, I dissociated.

He was stressed, and I was making things harder.

I think I must've dissociated for about an hour before I felt Aaron squeezing my shoulder.

We were outside a dive bar. I had no idea where we were.

""You okay, sweet?"" He was rubbing into the meat of my shoulder, face full of concern.

About an hour of time lost.

I heard him call my name and I woke up from that familiar trance.

""Where are we?""  It was  the only thing I was thinking about.

""Let's get inside first, yeah?""

Something in me just snapped. *What the fuck was this?*

""*No*,"" I bit, ""you tell me right now, Aaron.""

He threw his head back against the headrest and sighed. ""Can we just get inside, Elle?""

""Aaron, please,"" I stared right at him, ""I'm scared.""

It was rare for me to say that out loud. Aaron knew that.

He quickly looked all around the car, peeking in the windows, before he turned to me. He beckoned me close to him, and I obeyed.

Then he whispered something in my ear.

""It might still hear us.""

I had a full-body shiver and made my stomach fill with dread.

""So we need other people to block out conversation?"" I whispered back.

He nodded.

I understood, even if it sounded bizarre.

We grabbed a bite to eat and sat in the middle of the booths, multiple families chatting beside us. Finally, we could talk.

That leads me to now.

I'm sitting in the car, Aaron's driving.

In the span of a week, my life has been turned upside down. Life was good. It was good.

I was with the man I loved and away from all the shit in my life. My parents were out of my social circle, and Aaron's family took their place.

My life was *good*.

Now, we're running back to his hometown. It sounds stupid. However, there are a couple of reasons for this.

1. Home isn't safe anymore, that thing knows where we live
2. We would vacate to somewhere far off, like Japan, but money is *not good* at the moment, and even then, that thing could follow us to Japan (we have no idea where this thing can go)

Finally, 3. Aaron told his parents and they believed us, mainly because his dad saw the deer. They know someone. Someone who can help us.

Hopefully, that makes more sense as to why we've decided to head back.

We're going to stay to the highways, no backroads unless we have to.

Hopefully, that thing either stays away, or if it follows us, it gets ran over by a fucking truck.

It probably wouldn't kill it, but it would slow down, I hope.

I'm going to this post here. Aaron and I are in the car now, and we're close to the highway.

I just hope we get there safely. Wish us luck.",2,1770639941.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

I’m here trying to meet some new people because apparently adulthood doesn’t come with a “make friends” tutorial, and my NPC dialogue options are running out.

I’m not big on bars or loud scenes — I’m more of a chill coffee, random conversations, late-night gas station stop kind of person. I like video games, creative stuff, thinking way too deeply about things that probably don’t need it, and then immediately switching to dumb humor right after. Balance.

Recently separated, but not here to unload baggage or speedrun emotions. I’m in a “rebuilding / exploring / touching grass (occasionally)” phase and just looking for genuine connection — people who can talk about real things without it being weird or heavy all the time.

If you’re someone who enjoys good conversation, slightly offbeat humor, and hanging out without needing a reason, we’d probably get along. Worst case? We have a decent conversation. Best case? New friend unlocked.

1r02qzc,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/comments/1r02qzc/i_built_a_habit_tracker_that_makes_you_compete/,"I built a habit tracker that makes you compete with your friends. Now I have 125 users in the first month with no marketing, and two sales in the first 24 hours since the paywall went live!","Hey everyone!  

I built a habit-tracking app for my friend group because we were using a Google Form to log our workouts and diets, it was our way of keeping each other accountable. 

That simple Google Form worked better than any single-person habit app I'd ever used. So I thought why don't I build this properly?

# The app

I built **Habit Buddy** a shared habit accountability app.

Key features:

* Shared habits with friends — everyone tracks on the same leaderboard
* Photo proof check-ins — no faking it
* Stakes — set real consequences (""loser buys coffee"")
* Push notifications when your friends check in for that extra OOMPH push

# The surprising growth factor

I wasn't really paying attention to the downloads at first. I was just using it with my friend group and building features. Then I checked my app's downloads just after New Year's day and noticed a spike in users.

It was interesting to see the new years resolutioner spike, but also I was surprised to see people actually coming back to use it with their friends.

It then dawned on me that the app has built-in virality. Someone creates a habit and immediately has to tell their friends. Basically, one search + download instantly becomes 2+ users.  

Within a couple weeks, I had \*\*125 active users\*\* — and I hadn't spent a single minute or dollar on marketing.

The paywall just went on the weekend and I got \*\*2 sales in the first 24 hours\*\*. The invite loop is doing all the heavy lifting.

# Viral like social media, without the risk of ""everyone or no one""

Unlike social media apps, where the experience gets better as more people join and can  fall apart if lots of users leave, this app is slightly protected from the latter part of that: it's all about your friend group. You only interact with the people you invite—so it doesn't matter how many total users there are as long as your few close friends are participating. This makes the app less vulnerable to the ups and downs of a giant userbase, and lets each group have their own experience no matter what.

# What's next

Right now the app is iOS-only, which means it only works for friend groups with iPhones. The obvious next step is Android.   

I could buy a cheap Android phone now, but as a challenge for myself, I'm trying to use my app sales to purchase an Android phone. I'll post an update in a few weeks about how it goes!

# Join me?

If anyone here is working on building a business or side project and wants to join a shared accountability habit, drop a comment and I'll DM you an invite link.

1r02qv0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/1r02qv0/post_partum_wife/,Post Partum Wife,"My wife and I are in our 30s, had our first child 16 months ago, boy, super healthy kid, 90-95 percentile for height, weight, etc. He's so happy and fills our lives, joy, and fun.

My wife has had terrible PPD/A, and I am at a loss for words and I am finding my patience and fuse is getting very short. I know mental well-being is not linear, but it's been months and months and months of, for the most part, pure misery. 

It doesn't seem to be getting much better, and she doesn't seem to be working on it actively or hard enough. She does a little bit, feels better for 1, 2 weeks, it's great than something small happens, and boom straight back to this cycle, rinse and repeat. I just don't know what to do? And either does she...

I can understand in many ways why she has ppd/a - circumstances weren't great before and the first early stages of our son being born - quick summary - I closed my business (partner was doing dodgy things) 1 month before son was born, I scrambled to find a new job in a field and industry I have no prior experience in - it was very stressful and I was super stressed, so long days at work often 10-12hr days, lights were on but no one was home, money was tight at the time, family members were at times difficult, I had to send my 16 year old dog (furson) over the rainbow due to a disability and cancer, I was truly devastated and heartbroken beyond belief - deep in the grief pit. If I see a photo of him now, I nearly cry every time.

She gave birth naturally but the hospital staff didn't respect her request and kind of wankers so the experience was slightly ruined. She was amazing though, truly a weapon.

I will admit at the time I was not mentally prepared to be a father and supportive husband - with all the things mentioned above happening all at the same time in some way shape or form - I mentally checked out and didn't show up for her early on like I should have - I regret it - I let her down. 

After a good conversation, introspection and realisation I picked up my game major, showed up and really leant into being a father and partner - picking up my end of the slack and sharing the load - I tried to take as much off her plate as I could whenever I could. I'm a very invovled father and partner. The visible and invisible labour I try and tackle when I can. 


During this time she was deep in her ppd/a and was absolutely hammering me, punishing me for my short comings early on - she was abusive, aggressive, slamming things, screaming at the top of her lungs, saying some truly awful things to me re; she regrets having a child with me, she dislikes me, she wishes I would go away, I'm a terrible father and would threaten me with divorce some what regularly - no matter what happens whenever the chance comes she will remind me even after all this time has past and the atonement I have done of ALL the things big and small I did or didn't do early on... 

The absolute mind fuck is she will cry and cuddle me and say she is sorry, apologise etc... but then the moment she gets the chance BOOM. She goes straight for the jugular.

No matter what she does or did it was never her fault, always mine - anytime I'd raise issues big or small she would reply with the company line of ""I have ppd/a, I'm a mother, I'm tired etc so I can't be held accountable or can't help it...."" 

It was and has sent me bonkers. No matter what - the get out of jail free card. 

Being around her is like being around a graveyard or grim reaper she's miserable and brings the entire vibe, house etc down and it's suffocating to be around.. I feel terrible for her but it's dragging me down like a anchor. It's hard not to match that energy being around it all the time. I feel deeply sorry for her living with the weight of it. It must absolutely suck.

No matter what I do or how much I listen, act, improve. It's good, but it's never quite enough, it seems...

She's on medication, she's see's a specialised therapist, our son is in daycare + grand parents care throughout the week which means she gets 20 plus hours a week of time alone/away from our son, I've organised friend dates for her, buy her hair, nail, eye brow, massage appointments, coffee dates, walks with her friends etc, the list is exhaustive - I try to be proactive for her in this space - we have a 12k home gym decked to the 9's for her to use, get in shape, jacked etc - I have atoned, atoned, atoned and rectified my piss poor efforts from very early on but nothing seems to be working. 

She holds onto everything, every little tiny, micro small thing - no matter what anyone does to make up for even the smallest mishaps she harbours on it and doesn't let it go.. you can see it drowning her, full of resentment.

What's tough is I'm not one to be resentful towards her ever - I adore her (who she was) and we had a great marriage - God we would laugh and be silly, it was magic but now I am deeply starting to become resentful, I can feel it in my bones, like butter spread across to much bread.. I find my patience and care for her dwindling to nothing to the point I just don't care much anymore. I'm like, ""Meh.."" Which is nuts to even say, but deep down, it's true. I don't want that at all. I love her, but it's just been MONTHS AND MONTHS of this and no changes.

I've suggested couples counselling which we will be booking in soon..

golden goose superstar
Got stopped twice at the bodega asking if these were real. Distressed toe looks intentional, not sloppy. But my arches screamed after 3 hours—cute, not comfy.

dior b30
Heavy as hell. Like, “did they pour concrete in the sole?” heavy. But that CD logo catches streetlight just right. Paired with black jeans and suddenly I look like I have a trust fund.

nike everyday socks
$ 15 for 3 pairs? Hard pass. First wash: one shrank to toddler size, second lost the swoosh like a sad sticker, third developed a heel hole before I even left the house. Felt like wearing tissue paper. Stick to Uniqlo. Or literally anything else.

stone island hoodie
That compass patch on the sleeve? Still crisp after two washes. Fabric’s thick enough for 50°F mornings but won’t cook you. Threw it on with jeans and called it a fit. Zero effort.

carhartt wip script hoodie
Feels like I stole it from my dad’s closet in 2003. Soft, slightly faded, zero stiffness. Wore it to grab coffee and felt weirdly confident. My cat’s currently napping in it. High praise.

corteiz superior hoodie
Back says “CORTEIZ” with a crown + French text I can’t pronounce. Front’s completely blank—love that. Stranger said “nice hoodie,” zero follow-up. Vibe over logo, always.

stussy grey crewneck
Tiny scribble logo on chest—barely visible unless you’re staring. Fit’s relaxed but not drowning me. Perfect for days I want to look intentional without screaming “I tried.”

nike x stussy sweatpants
Mini box logo on thigh = quiet flex. Elastic cuffs stay put, no sagging when I crouch for the dog. Wore these to walk the block and felt zero guilt about being comfy.

gallery dept painted flare pants
Splatter paint looks like I DIY’d after two beers… but cool. Black cuffs keep it from looking messy. Paired with a plain white tee—suddenly I’m in a street style pic. My mom would side-eye these. I adore them.

I have a linguistics background and recently got interested in Taiwan for various reasons. I've also begun learning traditional mandarin at my own pace. I love focussing on details like pronounciation, the etymology of characters, etc. I'm really enjoying the process rn

Today I was wondering if (young) people in Taiwan use zhuyin/bopomofo when writing newer foreign slang (e.g.: English slang), that is, if they even use foreign slang at all. If they do use zhuyin that way or not, could you give me examples? I base my reflexion on multiple things I've learnt:

(-) Mandarin has been historically less permeable to loanwords than say European languages like English, German or French;

(-) Mandarin usually writes (established?) foreign words with characters (e.g.: 咖啡 for ""coffee"")

(+) Tawainese people primarly use zhuyin over pinyin, learning it at school and using it when typing on keyboards among other things;

(+) English is a relatively well-known language in Taiwan, I would assume especially among younger folk, so it's likely that they know English slang or common words like ""cringe"", ""slay"" or ""bye"" (help I'm out of ideas).

Correct me if any of those four assumptions are wrong!

******
Industrial expansion continues to absorb the bulk of attention, yet the balance-of-payments arithmetic remains unchanged: Brazil still needs foreign exchange that does not arrive only through coffee and minerals, and it needs employment growth that does not rely exclusively on heavy industry cycles. The tourism and convention economy is treated internally as a service export line with unusually favorable characteristics for Brazil’s present stage, since it converts existing assets into foreign receipts, absorbs labor across skill levels, and distributes activity geographically in a way that reduces political strain around concentration in the Southeast. The program is designed to monetize what the State is already building in transport, urban services, and national image, while avoiding the failure mode of “tourism promotion” that produces brochures without beds, airports without schedules, and foreign visitors who never return.

The plan is executed as a coordination and standards problem rather than a publicity campaign. Tourism revenues depend on reliability, hygiene, predictable transport, pricing transparency, and a basic sense that visitors can move without administrative friction. Those conditions require joint action across civil aviation, ports, municipal services, policing routines, hotel finance, and currency exchange rules. The Planning Commission therefore treats this as a production system with a measurable output, namely nights sold to foreign visitors and conventions hosted with repeat bookings, and it assigns responsibilities accordingly.

A National Tourism and Conventions Board is established as the operating center, with a mandate that is deliberately narrow. It does not build projects directly, and it does not become another general planning ministry in miniature. Its role is to issue standards, align credit and procurement, coordinate schedules with airlines and port authorities, manage external promotion through Itamaraty, and maintain a small statistical and inspection capacity that turns anecdotes into actionable metrics. The Board’s core discipline is conditionality. Access to hotel finance, convention grants, and route support is tied to compliance with service standards, verified sanitation, transparent pricing, and minimum staffing and training requirements, so that public support does not subsidize low-quality capacity that damages national reputation.

The first execution pillar is access and circulation. Brazil’s tourism problem is not an absence of attractions; it is the cost and uncertainty of reaching them, and the risk of arriving to find basic services inconsistent. Civil aviation receives the priority role for foreign entry and domestic circuits, with route planning coordinated around Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Recife, Salvador, and Belém as the initial hubs, while secondary nodes are added only when runway condition, navigation aids, and regular schedules can be sustained without improvisation. Port authorities are instructed to treat passenger handling and customs throughput as an economic activity rather than a ceremonial inconvenience. This includes dedicated inspection lanes for visitors, predictable clearing hours, and a strict separation between revenue collection and discretionary harassment, since petty extraction at points of entry converts directly into reputational loss. Overland and coastal integration is treated as the second layer, using the highway and coastal shipping improvements already under execution to make multi-city circuits feasible rather than exhausting.

The second pillar is hotel, venue, and service capacity, built through finance design rather than direct state construction. Caixa and BNDE open a dedicated line for hotels, guesthouses, and convention facilities, structured to favor standardized building designs and phased delivery. Financing prioritizes projects that attach to transport nodes, employment centers, and planned urban services, since isolated prestige hotels create imported dependency and seasonal fragility. Procurement rules deliberately link the program to domestic industry: furniture, textiles, ceramics, glassware, refrigeration equipment, air handling, and packaged food supply are sourced domestically where standards permit, using multi-year purchasing commitments to anchor the relevant industries. This turns tourism capacity into a quiet industrial multiplier, strengthening packaging, cold-chain equipment, light electrical goods, and standardized construction inputs without presenting the effort as industrial policy in public messaging.

Convention capacity is treated as the most stable subsegment of tourism exports, since it produces predictable flows outside peak leisure seasons and it pulls higher spending per visitor. The plan therefore designates a limited initial set of convention cities with explicit sequencing. Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo remain unavoidable due to existing hotel stock and corporate presence, while Brasília is positioned as a controlled environment for institutional conferences, technical congresses, and international delegations, using the city’s administrative gravity as an advantage rather than forcing it to compete with coastal leisure. Recife and Salvador are treated as the Northeast’s convention anchors, not simply as beach destinations, with investment directed toward mid-scale venues that match realistic hotel capacity and transport schedules. The program does not attempt to create convention infrastructure everywhere at once; it concentrates on a few nodes that can deliver a reliable experience, then expands after service metrics show stability.

The third pillar is standards, training, and safety, since service exports fail at the margin of trust. A national hospitality and tourism training track is introduced through technical institutes and employer-linked programs, focusing on language instruction, food handling, basic accounting, maintenance skills, and customer service routines that reduce the dependence on a small elite labor pool. Food safety and sanitation standards are unified for hotels and restaurants participating in the program, with inspection designed to be predictable and non-extortionary, rotating teams and standardized checklists replacing discretionary enforcement that historically invites bribery. Public security is handled through a limited, practical measure: designated tourism safety units within existing policing structures in the main hubs, focused on rapid response and deterrence in high-traffic areas, coupled with clear reporting channels that prevent small incidents from becoming international narratives.

The fourth pillar is currency and pricing discipline. Tourism inflows can strengthen reserves, yet they also create incentives for parallel exchange and price gouging if the system is poorly designed. A formal traveler exchange window is established with transparent spreads, available at airports, major hotels, and bank branches in program cities, with strict penalties for fraud and a reporting line that allows the Treasury and central banking authorities to see inflows as data rather than rumor. Pricing transparency is enforced through participation conditions, including published room rates in foreign languages and basic consumer protection rules for registered operators. The objective is to capture foreign receipts inside the formal system without turning tourism into a black-market subsidy.

External promotion is executed as targeted economic outreach rather than ideology. Itamaraty, in coordination with the Board, prioritizes practical messaging in North America and Western Europe around stability, infrastructure improvements, and service reliability, while also placing Brazil’s cultural and architectural modernization in a disciplined frame that supports conventions and professional travel. The program uses consulates, cultural institutes, radio and press placements, and partnerships with shipping and airlines to sell circuits rather than isolated destinations, since visitors who move through multiple nodes generate broader regional income and justify continued investment in transport regularity.

Geographic distribution is built into the plan’s routing logic. The Northeast is positioned for both leisure and convention capture, supported by hotel finance tied to sanitation and transport readiness, and by agro-industrial and packaging supply lines that reduce operating costs. The Center-West is treated as a convention and administrative travel node centered on Brasília, supported by scheduled connectivity and reliable urban services rather than resort fantasies. The South is developed as a cultural and seasonal circuit, with an emphasis on service standards and transport integration that makes it accessible without extreme cost. The North is handled cautiously, prioritizing river and frontier logistics that can be sustained, with modest, extraction-linked service development rather than overbuilt prestige projects. Where northern routes become viable, the port of Santa Rosa and the improved coastal logistics are treated as practical enablers for supply and maintenance, keeping operating costs from becoming a permanent penalty.

The plan acknowledges its own risks. Construction materials can be diverted into hotels at the expense of core infrastructure, and the program therefore imposes a materials allocation discipline that favors standardized designs and phased starts, with approvals tied to regional cement and steel availability. Corruption and patronage can attach themselves to hotel licensing and municipal works, and the response is to make support conditional and verifiable, using template contracts, published eligibility rules, and rotating inspections. Tourism can also trigger political backlash if it is perceived as an elite indulgence, and internal messaging therefore frames the program as employment absorption, service export earnings, and regional development, with visible linkages to sanitation, housing, training, and urban order.

Heavy as hell. Like, “did they pour concrete in the sole?” heavy. But that CD logo catches streetlight just right. Paired with black jeans and suddenly I look like I have a trust fund.

That compass patch on the sleeve? Still crisp after two washes. Fabric’s thick enough for 50°F mornings but won’t cook you. Threw it on with jeans and called it a fit. Zero effort.

Feels like I stole it from my dad’s closet in 2003. Soft, slightly faded, zero stiffness. Wore it to grab coffee and felt weirdly confident. My cat’s currently napping in it. High praise.

“Fuck off, Paul.”

A cushion went flying towards Paul's face, which he easily swerved, managing to save his whisky and coke from spilling as he did so.

“That fucking line works; keep it or it’s not a Beatles song, just another of your oohh la la songs.” John sat back on the plush red velvet sofa, grinned, and took a slow swig from his drink. It was his third so far, and the effects were already doing their work.

“Beatles?” said Paul.

“Why not?” said John. “I’m dead, you’re fucking ancient, let’s fuck the world up and release a new Beatles song in—what year did you say it was?”

“2025,” Paul offered quietly. “George is gone,” he added.

“Oh.” John stopped talking and the pair lapsed into silence, memories of the past swirling in their minds until John snapped out of it, “Christ. How the hell did you get so old?”

Paul half smiled. “I didn’t get shot!” He kicked himself at his bluntness. He was matching John drink for drink and felt relaxed, very relaxed.

The situation was unreal, it must be a dream. However, he’d never got drunk in dreams before; nor met his old dead mate and had a proper chat. Maybe it was one of those lucid dreams he’d heard about?

“I hope you shot the bastard back,” John replied with annoyance.

“He’s been in prison ever since,” smiled Paul.

John laughed. “Good — Let's go and visit the old cunt.”

Paul laughed. “You don’t change, John, do you?”

John laughed—a proper laugh—and doubled up on the sofa. “Moi? No, I don't change. You however do, have you seen yourself? I’m not sure who is older, you or the bloke upstairs.”

The same cream cushion from earlier went flying back towards John's face, who likewise easily swerved it and punched it back, whooping for joy as the cushion finally found its target on Paul's face.

“Lennon one — McCartney zero!” he yelled.

“No fair,” protested Paul. “You're half my age!”

“Oh shut up you poof,” he smiled, resting back in the armchair and resuming his drink as Paul looked on at his old — young childhood mate.

“So we never got back together,” John said. “Shame. I always had this little idea that one day, we’d come back, do one proper fuck-off tour, proper sound systems. Not like the old days, they were shite.”

Paul grinned. “Yeah, and sharing a room with you and your feet didn’t help — Do you think we could have all worked together again?”

John laughed, “Of course, Ringo’s up for anything and we’ll just tell George that he has to come or we’ll book Clapton.”

Paul looked at his old friends sadly. “You're using present tense, John….”

“Oh yeah.” The pair thought on, swigging away at their drinks and remembering the days of screaming fans, cameras shoved in their faces, rushing around in and out of vans, planes, TV studios and concert halls.

“Well I’ve got till midnight and then I turn into a pumpkin,” John joked, breaking the silence for the second time. He topped up both whisky glasses and added, “Let's write a song,” and reached for the acoustic guitar that was conveniently on the sofa next to him.

Paul smiled, “got anything in mind?”

“Oh yes, two rough ones. One’s called Free as a Bird and the other Real Life —.”

“Er, we’ve done them,” said Paul, a flicker of guilt on his face as he continued. “Released them, both got to number one —.”

John looked confused as he started to tune his guitar. Paul continued. “- You did a demo of them yeah, Yoko passed them on and the three of us added our bits and yeah, Beatles back in the charts nineteen ninety something and then again a couple of years back.”

“Ok,” said John, shaking his head. “Where’s my share?” he added, hand out as if expecting some cash.

Paul laughed, “your share went to Yoko.”

“Well that’s a fuck,” said John. “Have to start from scratch then.” He looked around the expensive hotel suite they were in, eyes scanning until he found a copy of the New York Times.

“I thought you said we were in France?” said John and grabbing it he spread it open on the table and started skimming through the headlines reading those that caught his eye aloud.

Paul smiled, “We are, they get papers from around the world here you know, it's well posh!” 

He picked up his own guitar, tuned it, and took a large swig of whisky as Lennon and McCartney got back to work in 2025. 

\*\*\*

The whole thing had started a few hours back when Paul, having checked in to the Penthouse Suite of a Hilton hotel in France had found a rather grubby strange-looking bottle lying casually on his bed. 

He was surprised to find obvious waste in his room, but being in his eighties, he simply moved it to one side, not wishing to cause a fuss, unavoidably rubbing it as he moved it.

As you might imagine, when strange grubby bottles are rubbed this causes a certain genie called Frank; to lazily appear a few minutes later; in his own good time. Having genied for more millennia than he could remember, Frank still enjoyed the art of the dramatic appearance, and as soon as Paul sat down on the large sofa, with a newspaper in hand, Frank had appeared in front of him in a haze of green smoke, arms folded.

“Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all—” He stopped, thought, and apologised. “Sorry, sorry, wrong script. Oh mighty master, you have earned one magical wish from I, Frank, your genie for the day.”

Frank smiled, standing a few feet away from his new ‘master’. He studied the face looking back at him. It was mystified. They generally were.

It was an old face—with grey / white fairly long hair, bushy eyebrows, droopy eyelids —and there was something about it Frank recognised. He squinted, trying to place it, and took a couple of steps back, allowing himself to fall into the comfortable armchair behind, his green trilby lolloping on the side of his head at a dangerous angle.

“What?” Paul said somewhat surprised. “A genie?” *I must have dozed off*, he thought.

“Not what, Frank — Frank the genie,” he grinned. “ — Hang on, I know you, I know you—have I genied for you before?” he asked, noting Paul's Liverpudlian accent. “We have rules about that,” he added, wagging a finger as if to a naughty child.

“Me? Er, no,” replied Paul, noticing the soft Irish lilt to Frank the genie's tones.

“OK. Are you famous? Are you a president? Are you a movie star? Let's play twenty questions.”

Paul gave a half laugh. “Not a president — I am a bit famous though.”

“Would you like a drink?” Frank asked, making himself comfortable and taking in the large opulent hotel suite that was his current location. “Very nice. Very plush,” he commented as a glass of brown liquid with ice cubes appeared in his hand, causing a look of surprise from Paul.

“Drink?” Frank asked again.

“Er, is that whisky?” He indicated towards Frank's glass, to which Frank nodded with a smile. “A few years back I’d have joined you. But I’ll settle for a cappuccino now?”

Before he had finished speaking, a large cup and saucer appeared on the coffee table in front, a thin layer of steam rising from the cappuccino. A side jar appeared with various types of sugar and, next to that, a small jug of cream.

Paul tentatively reached forward to take the cup, half expecting it to vanish when he touched it, his eyes on Frank all the time. He’d seen a lot of things in life, but genies—that was a new one. But there was something too real about all this to be a dream, he could feel the seat material, taste the cappuccino, everything was normal, with the exception of a cheerful looking genie.

Frank was around 5’5”, a rotund man with bright red hair that sat underneath a lopsided dark green trilby hat, which sat at such an angle that it really should have fallen off. He was wearing a pale green tweed suit and had one of those faces born with a cheeky grin and topped off by his cheerful Irish brogue.

Paul took a small sip, tasting the drink. It was fine, tasted good. “Thanks,” he said, still rather stunned at his situation but becoming more accepting. Settling back with his cappuccino in hand he asked, “What happened to three wishes?”

“Government cuts,” grinned Frank.

“Yeah right,” muttered Paul. “No seriously, how come only one?”

“Got it!” exclaimed Frank jumping out of his seat and pointing at Paul. “You’re John, Paul, George, and Ringo!”

As Frank had jumped up, the whisky glass should have spilled its contents with his sudden movement but somehow, all remained within. 

Paul gave a soft chuckle, “I’m one of them, yeah. I’m impressed that a genie has heard of the Beatles.”

“Oh, we love your stuff. Which one are you then?”

Another laugh from Paul. “I was the cute one.”

“Oh, George,” smiled Frank.

“Paul,” Paul corrected.

“Oh, sorry.” Frank flopped back down again and a dark green pouffe appeared in position, which he rested his feet upon. “Can I get your autograph?” A notebook and pen appeared on the table in front of Paul but quickly disappeared when Frank added, “Oh don’t worry, I’ll get it off your contract later.”

“Contract?”

“For your wish, oh master. All needs to be signed—everything legal.”

“I’m going to need my lawyer then,” Paul said.

Frank shook his head slowly. “Aye aye, you humans, always so wary.”

As they drank their respective drinks Paul said. “One wish? To be honest, Frank, there is nothing I need.”

“Money?” suggested Frank.

“Er, look around you, I don’t need money.”

“No problem. Women—I can get you the most beautiful woman in the world?”

Paul laughed. “If only I’d met you when I was fifteen.”

The conversation went on. Helicopter—had one, didn’t like it. Superyacht—got one. Another number one single—that would be nice, but I’d rather not use magic for that. 

A tree house? A new farm?

After twenty minutes of backing and forwarding, of which Frank managed to magically refill his whisky glass twice, they were running out of ideas until Paul simply said, “John?”

Frank the genie paused and smiled, a faraway look passing across his brow. “Nice, I approve.”

“Really?” Paul asked. “No tricks, John Lennon, my old mate from the Beatles, not just some guy with the same name?”

“No tricks,” Frank smiled reassuringly. “It’s a nice wish, harms nobody. I’ll need to get John's permission first though.”

“So there is an afterlife then?” said Paul thoughtfully.

“I can neither confirm nor deny that dear boy,” chimed Frank. “But we won’t be getting him from there—he’ll need a body, so I’ll grab him when he’s alive. Give me a date, Paul.”

Paul's heart skipped a beat. *Really, do I get to meet John again? — Get a chance to say goodbye?*

“So you’re going to use time travel to bring him here?” he asked.

“Something like that.”

“December 1st, 1980—somewhere around that point. Check out the Dakota building block in New York. I think it's number 72.” He finished off his coffee and added quietly, “Can I warn him?”

Frank shook his head fully aware of Paul’s reference; a genuine look of sadness briefly appeared on his face. “You can, but I’m afraid his memory of this will be erased when he returns.”

“Oh,” said Paul. “Oh, I’m not so sure then—to be sat next to him knowing he will be dead in eight days.”

“ — a week,” grinned Frank. “Well, we can’t change that, but it’s a chance for you to say goodbye, which is what I think you want?”

“Yeah,” muttered Paul. “Let's do it — I wish to meet my old friend John Lennon again, the John Lennon who was born in Liverpool 9th October 1940.” He paused, “er, not sure of time.”

In an instant an aged single piece of parchment appeared on the table alongside an old fashioned quill pen and an ink pot and a small wisp of green smoke. Paul squinted at the paper, unable to read the words.

“Latin?” he muttered. “I’ll need to get hold of my lawyer,” he continued, reaching for his phone.

Frank smiled. “Let’s ignore the paperwork — This one's on the house. One John Lennon, former best friend. And fellow Beatle coming up — Give me ten.” And with that he stood, glass in hand and along with the paperwork, promptly vanished in a plume of green smoke.

\*\*\*

When a flood of green smoke started to form in front of him, John Lennon thought something was on fire, and a startled Frank found himself being attacked with a tea towel, until he solidified and John realised there was a man there.

John jumped back, “what the fuck,” he said and threw a nearby saucer at Frank. Frank phased out quickly dodging the saucer and re-appeared on the other side of the kitchen, arms up in surrender. This was new, he’d never been attacked upon his genie duties. This was also new to John who had never met a genie before — not that he knew it was a genie at this point.

“Hello John Lennon,” Frank smiled, his most pleasing smile. “I am the genie of the lamp, Frank of the lamp.” His smile grew wider as he spoke.

“I’m tripping,” muttered John, taking in the amusing figure dressed in mostly green. “How the hell am I tripping?” He picked up a cup and threw it towards Frank who again phased out and back in, the cup avoiding him and smashing to the floor behind.

“One hundred percent tripping,” concluded John and sat down at the kitchen table where he decided to clean his glasses. Just in case they weren't working properly.

“Have you finished?” asked Frank indicating the broken cup and saucer and without waiting for an answer wiggled a finger and both the cup and the saucer applied reverse entropy. John watched astounded as the pieces flew into the air, collected together, re-joined and settled back down where they had been. Good as new.

As he sat John wondered how long this ‘trip’ would last, who had spiked him and why it seemed so real. But with Sean at school, Yoko downstairs in the office and not a lot planned for the day, why not. He’d kill whoever spiked him when the trip was over.

Frank briefly explained Paul’s wish and the general situation, John dies, Paul is in 2025, the family are fine and all that, as John just sat there bemused, not really taking it all in.

“Paul would like to meet you in 2025?” said Frank, taking a small swig of his whisky.

“2025, that's more than fifty years, ha,” John chuckled. “I bet he looks well old!”

Which brings us back to now... 

After the initial shock of seeing each other, and John's fascination with the massive tv screen and Paul’s mobile phone, the two Beatles sat opposite each other in a grand hotel suite, guitars to hands and scribbled notes on the table in front of them; an almost empty bottle of whisky and a coffee cup piled high with John's cigarette butts.

“Do you have to John?” coughed Paul.

“Yes I do,” replied John, fake coughing back.

They’d come up with a couple of tunes, one of which they favoured and worked on. It was a bluesy rocker that Paul reckoned was a number one, the lyrics formed from a headline John had seen and then expanded upon. 

Paul of course had a multitude of tunes already in his head, but he kept these to himself. Working this way, the way they had all those years ago; sat at the back of a van freezing their bollocks off, writing hit song after hit song.

Although, being in a warm hotel room, with booze on tap was more preferable.

Noting the almost empty whisky bottle, John paused strumming and walked over to the telephone pressing the room service button.

“Another two bottles of your finest Jack Daniels whisky for the McCartney suite please my good man.” he spoke into the phone feigning a posh English accent. 

He paused. “Sorry, madam,” he added, openly grinning at Paul.

It only took ten minutes for the liquor supplies to arrive and John dashed to the door as soon as he heard the knock as Paul watched on, slightly envious of John's energetic forty something, still youthful body.

“Come in my good man.” John continued in his mock tones and led the service waiter in. 

“This is my comrade Mr Macca McCartney, you might have heard of him, he’s had some minor success in the hit parade.” John pointed towards his famous friend whilst Paul nodded in amusement, as John played his little game.

As the waiter walked into the room pushing a drinks trolley laden with whisky, coke and many other varieties of spirits he noted the haze and smell of thick cigarette smoke, smoking wasn’t allowed in the hotel but hey, this was Paul McCartney. He wasn’t about to tell.

“It’s a pleasure to meet you Mr McCartney,” the waiter said shyly as he pushed the drinks trolley into place. “Would you like me to pour sir?”

“No don’t wo — “ started Paul.

“ — That would be delightful my good man,” interrupted John, keeping his posh voice up.

He plopped himself next to Paul, two Beatles in a row and gave the waiter a cheeky grin daring him to ask, are you John Lennon?

And to be fair, the waiter was confused, very confused. He was around 35 and well aware of who Paul McCartney and the Beatles were. And he knew what they all looked like and which one was which.

And here was this man sitting next to Paul McCartney who looked exactly like John Lennon. Not a little bit, not like one of those tribute acts, no, he looked completely like John Flippin’ Lennon. Problem was, John Lennon had died well over forty years ago.

The waiter glanced at the messy coffee table, with its whisky glasses, scribbled notes, and the make-do coffee cup ashtray. On the TV, footage of the Beatles was playing with the volume at level one.

*Nooo*, thought the waiter as he stared at the man wearing perfect Lennon ‘granny glasses’.

“Would you care for a photo, old boy?” suggested John brightly to which the waiter nodded dumbly. “Have you got one of those awfully impressive pocket camera things?” he asked to which the waiter nodded again, seemingly unable to speak and pulling out his phone.

“John,” whispered Paul cautiously.

John ignored him, leaned in closer to Paul and said “Smile”. The waiter took three or four photos before muttering thanks and slowly backing out of the room, his eyes fully on John.

*Nooo*, he thought.

With the waiter gone, John jumped back to his own seat and doubled up with laughter, “did you see his face, looked like he’d seen a ghost.”

“John, what am I going to say when he puts those photos online and everyone sees me with you, now?”

“I dunno,” laughed John. “No idea what online is, and anyway fuck it, we’ll take a few more photos, get this song half decent and you can do all the studio work, I know you love that kinda thing.”

“We can’t do that, our fans know we’ve used up all demo tracks,” said Paul.

“Oh whatever, it will be a laugh,” said John. He thought on his words. “Mind you I’ll be too dead to appreciate it...”

Paul's face slowly lit up. “Fuck yeah, I’ll do it, I mean it won’t really be a proper Beatles without George but I’m sure I can get Ringo in; hey, maybe I can find some old stuff of Georges that might fit,” he tailed off, excited at the new project unfolding in front of him. “One more Lennon and McCartney eh?”

“Stop burbling McCartney, we need to figure a bridge.”

Some three hours later, two verses and a chorus were completed. The whisky flowing through their veins, and with no pressures the pair fell straight into their old songwriting pattern as if it was yesterday. They wrote purely for the fun of it, laughing, drinking and joking. Paul used his mobile phone to record John's voice singing what they had written.

“Well you're not singing it, your voice is shot to pieces old man,” sniggered John after Paul had sung a few lines. Paul half smiled back, it was true he knew, but only John would be so crass. And so honest. To the billionaire Paul McCartney, no one criticised. But John never bullshitted and was one of the very few people whose opinion had mattered, in the mad world of music they had both shared.

After the fifth or so glass both Beatles had slowed down, neither of them up to their old teenage drinking days and both feeling content and woozy in that good way, before you have drunk too much. 

The outside sunshine had turned to evening and evening to almost midnight which was just around when Frank re-appeared, a big smile on his face, whisky glass as always in hand, hiccupping and humming the tune they had been working on. He was quite obviously over the limit with his slight swaying and occasional slurred speech.

“Brilliant,” he said. Despite having already seen it before, he managed to startle both Beatles by fading into view in prime position. 

“Are you going to release it?”

“Were you spying on us?” asked John with suspicion.

“No,” lied Frank. “Well not much, just a little bit, oh come on you're the Beatles… — The Two-tles?”

Both ‘Two-tles’ smiled, “Yeah we are,” agreed John proudly.

“I think we’ll release it after the last death,” said Paul.

“I like it,” said John. “Very enigmatic old man,” he slapped Paul on the back causing a protest of,

“Oi, I’m 83.”

“Good, you can update that ole tune of yours to ‘when I’m 84’!”

He looked around the room, stretched and said to Frank who was leaning against the back of a chair. “Is it time to go, time for the trip to end?”

Frank nodded, “take your time, say your goodbyes.”

John finished off his almost empty glass and made a face spitting out the contents, the coke had turned flat. He stood up, caught himself as a wave of dizziness passed him, and then spotting Paul's slight old man struggle yanked him up to his feet where the two faced each other.

“You're very pragmatic about this,” said Paul.

John smiled, “I’m still half convinced I’m tripping.” He placed a hand on Paul's shoulder briefly. “Good trip if so.”

He turned to move but was pulled into a hug from Paul. He awkwardly returned the hug and backed out, noting a tear running down Paul's face.

“I love you man,” Paul said.

“I should think so too,” John replied. “Ready?” he asked Frank who swayed, hiccupped and nodded.

He walked over to him and with his back to Paul whispered “Timing’s everything.” Frank winked back in understanding as John turned and faced Paul, now a few feet away. 

“You know,” said John. “I’ll be dead in a few days. Shit — And you’ll be dead in a couple of weeks by the looks of you,” he grinned.

“See you up there?” said Paul, eyes rolling upwards towards the heavens.

John kept grinning, “Heaven? We're not going there, we corrupted the youth of a generation, we’re going down. I reckon Eppy will be running an illegal drinking den and have the scotches ready.”

Paul smiled, too choked to speak. 

“So,” continued John. “Last words.” He lightly took the genie's hand. “Love you too — you old poof!” He squeezed Frank's hand and the pair vanished in a plume of dark green smoke.

Paul laughed. “Had to get the last word in you old bugger,” he muttered and collapsed back onto the sofa, a new Lennon and McCartney song in front of him.

He started to cry. 

A happy cry.

\*\*\*

And that’s pretty much what happened. Paul took the track to Ringo who was flabbergasted by a personal video message from John that they had recorded.

“Is it on?”

“Yes, speak.”

“Alright Richie, it’s Johnny boy — I’m in the future — I know! Pretty sure I’m tripping… I’m with Paul, he looks like he’s been in the bath since 1970! — Can he see you, Paul?”

“Yes I’m in the shot John.”

“Apparently he’s a billionaire now so I better stop taking the piss or he might wet himself!” John laughed. “Anyway listen Rich, we’ve written a pretty little ditty and we need a drummer, so get off your arse you lazy sod, put down the peace signs for five minutes, and give the old man a tinkle.”

“Love you and all that, Byeeee.” 

Ringo, of course, readily agreed to play drums.

Paul produced the song lovingly, continually tweaking it and doing his best to improve it for the rest of his life.

When the last Beatle died, the song was released two years afterwards, alongside a nostalgic video that included photos from Paul and John’s last session together. John's video message to Ringo was also released. No explanation was offered from the estate of the Beatles families.

The song was of course analysed by forensic audio experts, all of whom agreed it was definitely the voice of John Lennon. The photos and video were likewise analysed to death but no tomfoolery could be found, even though they depicted a man who had died in 1980 being filmed on a smartphone in 2025.

50% of the world was convinced it was fake, the other 50% wanted to believe. Regardless, the song was a belter and went to number one in the UK, US and many other countries. The last Beatles song to date, a rocking blues number with a lovely guitar riff of George's that Paul had managed to fit in.

The song itself, the last Beatle tune ever written and recorded?

1r02f7i,https://www.reddit.com/r/carvana/comments/1r02f7i/my_review_better_than_dealing_with_a_dealership/,"My Review: Better than dealing with a dealership, but with some annoyances","I bought a 2024 Hyundai Kona Electric in Neoteric Yellow. I already have an 2020 Kona (Orange, not electric) and I love it, but the yellow electric is my dream car. I watched the price for a few weeks and after it came down a couple of times, I bought it. The purchasing process was easy enough. I financed through Carvana and got a rate like 8% or something, but I’ll probably refinance as soon as it makes sense to. I passed on the extended warranty, as the car is very low mileage and still has several years left on the original manufacturers warranty. I loved the fact that the process was completely no-touch and took less than ten minutes. I placed the order on Friday January 30, and scheduled delivery for Wednesday February 4. Carvana delayed delivery to Saturday February 7. My Kona was delivered on Saturday, in the middle of a snowstorm. I only had to sign a few papers and show my license and I was good to go. So, my overall review is that this was the smoothest and least stressful car-buying experience I’ve ever had. I would probably recommend to others, with some important caveats I’ll get into below, but I will definitely use Carvana the next time I need to buy a used car. 

With all that being said, here are some of negatives I observed during my shopping and buying experience:

1) After placing my order, I was given less than 24 hours to provide proof of insurance and to get a registration form e-stamped by my insurer. Adding the vehicle was easy enough, but getting the e-stamp was less so. I have never heard of a car dealer that doesn’t handle that step on their own. Carvana handled every other step of the registration process, except for this one specific step. It took about an hour of sitting on hold to get that take care of, and it was really annoying to be given such a short time clock. 

2) Carvana delayed delivery by 3 days, but provided no explanation for why. 

3) The delivery person was great, but his phone number just came up as “Salt Lake City” on my caller ID when he called on delivery day. They should really spring for however much it would cost to have their phones listed as “Carvana”.

4) The condition was adequately described in the listing, but wasn’t as clean as expected. For example, the car had been vacuumed, the interior wasn’t cleaned otherwise. The steering wheel has a big coffee stain on it that wiped off easy enough. And the wiper blades were shredded and I needed to replace them immediately. 

5) This is a big one for me. The 2024 Kona Electric keys come in two distinct parts. There is a key fob and a separate physical emergency key. Unlike most cars, the physical key is not stored inside the key fob. I only received the fobs, which means that if the battery in the key fob or the 12V battery in the car that powers the door locks ever dies, I will be out of luck. Carvana apparently considers these keys to be “removable items” and says that unless they were explicit referenced as being included in the listing, then there’s nothing they can do.

1r02ezm,https://www.reddit.com/r/MeAgain_GLP1/comments/1r02ezm/picky_on_glp1_5_unconventional_protein_hacks_no/,Picky on GLP-1? 5 unconventional protein hacks (no chicken required) + go-to shake recipe,"Hey GLP-1 folks, protein can feel like a full‑time job when appetite is low and textures suddenly feel “off.” Reduced appetite on GLP-1 makes hitting protein goals hard for a lot of people, but aiming for roughly 1.2 to 1.6g per kg of body weight daily helps protect muscle and energy.

Shakes alone get boring fast, so here are some ideas that are easier to live with when eating feels like effort:

* **Collagen in coffee**: Stir a flavorless scoop (10–20g protein) into morning coffee or even broth. It just tastes like the drink, but quietly bumps protein without needing to chew.​
* **Edamame pods as “fries”**: Steam and salt a bag (about 18g protein per cup shelled). Eating them with your hands feels more like snacking than “trying to be good.”​
* **Lentil “dip” upgrade**: Blend cooked lentils with garlic and spinach (around 18g protein per cup). Use it like hummus for carrots or crackers so it feels like a dip, not a chore.​
* **Milk hack**: Stir nonfat dry milk powder into yogurt or oats (bumping it to about 15g protein per cup). It turns them thicker and creamier instead of chalky when mixed well.​
* **Bee pollen sprinkle**: Add to shakes or smoothies (roughly 7g protein per tablespoon). It is a small extra boost that can help on days when real meals are tiny.​

**Daily recipe: Lazy Protein Iced Latte (about 30g protein, \~200 cal)**

* 1 cup fairlife milk (around 13g protein)
* 1 scoop collagen or whey (about 20g protein)
* Ice + espresso or cold brew

Blend and sip slowly over 30–60 minutes if fullness hits fast. It feels more like a treat than a “high‑protein task,” but still helps keep numbers in a safer place.

Context: i'm doing a 3-month trip across Asia and Europe, and i got my glasses stolen literally the day before flying out (long story, bus terminal, wasn't paying attention). i have mild myopia but worse astigmatism and i work on my laptop constantly. without glasses i get headaches within like an hour. I was genuinely panicking because i had THREE MONTHS ahead of me and no backup glasses. My Japan leg was 3 weeks but constantly moving between cities, then Turkey, Balkans, more Europe after that. I was spiraling thinking about how i was supposed to work, navigate new cities, even just enjoy the trip with constant headaches. and i had zero idea how getting glasses made in a foreign country even works.

  
I started googling ""glasses Japan tourist"" out of desperation and kept seeing people mention these express optical shops. Apparently Japan has this whole system where tourists can get glasses made same-day? Sounded too good to be true but i was desperate so i went for it.  
Second morning in Osaka i went to one of these places inside a shopping center. The guy helping me was super young, spoke minimal English, and we used google translate for everything. He was SO patient though. Did the full eye exam right there (took maybe 10 minutes), some of the tests were confusing because i didn't understand the instructions but we laughed through it. He printed out my prescription and showed me which frames i could choose from.  
Here's the crazy part: two pairs of glasses including the exam cost me $94 total. Back home this would've been minimum $500, probably more. 

I grabbed two pairs specifically because of what happened with the stolen ones and honestly they're great quality. Been using them for months now.  
The wildest part? he told me to come back in 40 minutes and they'd be ready. i literally walked around the mall, got coffee, came back, and both pairs were done. perfect fit, perfect prescription, everything.  
If you wear glasses and need new ones while in Japan, look for places like JINS or Owndays (those are the main ones people recommended). i went to JINS and the whole experience was incredibly smooth",31,1770638395.0,JapanTravelTips,19,0.9,False
1r02ccj,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1r02ccj/i_built_a_financial_firewall_to_stay_on_free/,"I built a ""Financial Firewall"" to stay on free tiers forever and avoid the Cloud Success Tax.","Most cloud providers have generous free tiers—until they don’t. Once you hit that 1M request limit, you aren't just paying for overages; you're often paying a ""Convenience Tax"" for staying on that provider. 

I got tired of the anxiety of ""success"" leading to a surprise $500 bill, so I built a feature into my managed gateway that I’m calling Waterfall Routing.

The Strategy:

It’s essentially financial arbitrage at the infrastructure level. You set a monthly request limit on Cloud A (e.g., 900k). Once you hit that limit, Crate automatically pivots your traffic to Cloud B’s free tier.

The Resilience Layer:

I also added In-Flight Retries. If your secondary ""free"" destination gets throttled or throws a 5xx, the gateway detects it instantly and retries on a different healthy node before the user even sees an error.

The Tech: > Built it in Go with Redis atomic counters to keep track of global usage in real-time. I also implemented ""Method Safety"" logic so we never blindly retry a POST or DELETE request (to avoid double-charging or data ghosting).

The Goal: > Get enterprise-grade High Availability and Multi-Cloud stability for the cost of a coffee.

I’m curious—do other founders here actively ""daisy-chain"" free tiers to keep costs down, or is the overhead of managing multiple clouds usually the dealbreaker for you?

P.S. I'm building this in public and would love some brutal feedback on whether ""Financial Failover"" is a feature you'd actually use.",1,1770638370.0,SaaS,0,1.0,False

It is 4 23 am and I am surrounded by a literal graveyard of sugar free monster cans and half eaten granola bars that probably have more preservatives in them than actual food. My eyes are doing that weird twitchy thing where it feels like they are trying to vibrate out of my skull and honestly i cant even blame them because they have been staring at the same three pages of organic chemistry notes for the last six hours. I have an exam in exactly five hours and twenty minutes and I am currently sitting at a solid fifteen percent completion rate for the material because I spent the last three hours watching a documentary about how they make industrial grade zippers instead of actually learning what a functional group is. My brain is literally refusing to cooperate and every time I try to read a sentence it feels like the words are just sliding off my eyeballs like water on a window pane and I am just sitting there blinking like a confused owl. I tried to drink another coffee but my hands were shaking so much that I accidentally typed ""help me"" into my spreadsheet forty times instead of the formula for standard deviation and honestly that is probably the most accurate data I have produced all semester long.

The worst part of this whole disaster is the exam math that I keep doing in my head every ten minutes like it is going to change the outcome of my life. I have calculated that if I get a forty percent on this final and if the professor decides to drop the lowest quiz grade and if I some how manage to find a twenty dollar bill on the street on my way to the hall then I might actually scrape by with a passing grade. We all know that isnt going to happen because my professor looks like he enjoys failing students more than he enjoys breathing but a person can dream right. I am at that level of sleep deprivation where the quiet humming of the library lights is starting to sound like a choir of angels singing about my inevitable academic failure and every time a floorboard creaks I jump like I am in a horror movie. I tried to take a quick nap on my desk earlier but I woke up with the imprint of my spiral notebook on my forehead and I think I might have accidentally drooled on the chapter about thermodynamics which is probably the most interest anyone has shown that subject in decades. I am genuinely considering just walking into the forest and living with the squirrels because they dont have to worry about cumulative finals or weighted averages or why the hell I decided to take this class in the first place.

1. Do you take creatine on vacations
2. Do you take creatine on active rest periods (lets say u took a 2 week break from working out)
3. Do you take creatine on days when you are sick
4. Can u drink coffee and then take creatine after a few hours?

Next, how much water minimum(in L) per day u need to drink when u are supplementing with creatine? Does it matter if u drink less water some days and still took creatine? Also lets say u are drinking a lot of milk too everyday so thats also contributing to daily water intake right?How to know whether the water u are drinking is sufficient?

I have never met any other sufferers where I live, and can't find much info  on local platforms, so I am wondering if more Norwegians/Nordics are having the same experience as me and many other people in other countries. 

Public health care officials have stated that in my area (south-east of Norway), they are working on limiting the use of gastroscopy. With the little anecdotic info I could find from fellow Norwegians, there seems to be little knowledge of treatment besides PPIs among GPs. 

With treatment within the public health sector you also risk having to wait for many months before you get an apointment for gastoscopy. Then it's about 40USD. If you don't feel like you can wait and opt to go to a private clinic, the cost is around 500USD. 

I had my diagnosis after gastroscopy in 2024, and have had several flair ups since then. My last doctor told me to try a little Pantroprazol whenever I felt like it (!) , and don't drink to much coffee. The GP I am seeing now refused to refer me to a second gastroscopy even though it has been 1,5 years since the first time, I have had several flair ups and several rounds of medication. She prescribed me another round of Pantoprazol and said a lot depended on my diet (although didn't have any examples of what that should mean).  

I've read studies and statements from Norwegian doctors warning about the use of PPIs, and I am never doing that again. I have also been on a very bland diet for 6 weeks now, which I will continue to follow for 6 more weeks. Then I am having a private gastroscopy, since the waiting time in the public health system seems to be 5 months atm. The diet I am following is inspired by the gastritis healing book and other common sense guide lines I have found here and there online. I don't eat anything that could irritate or produce more acid. I try to relax, don't overeat, don't eat too fast, don't eat hot foods, limit almost everything I used to enjoy. Even though I feel better now, I find it really strange that there isn't a handout with a fixed list of what food to avoid, what to eat and for how long you should stay on the restrictive diet. Even when being one of the richest countries in the world, health care is not prioritized, and gastroscopies limited; how can you really know if you have successfully healed if you haven't seen the inside of your stomach? Would love to hear from fellow sufferers in Norway or other Nordic countries. ",1,1770638118.0,Gastritis,4,1.0,False
1r028ub,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r028ub,Please help me reverse engineer this baked oatmeal bar,"There's a local coffee shop near me that gets these baked oatmeal bars (they call them Morning Bars) in from a different vendor. They advertise them as being Gluten Free. I've actually reached out to the vendor to see if they'd be willing to share the recipe with me but no luck.

As far as I can tell, there's obviously oats, chocolate chips, and raisins involved. I also clearly taste peanut butter and probably coconut as well. Aside from that there is flaky salt on top. 

They're dense and a chewy, not super crumbly (like a nature valley bar might be). Slightly dry in the middle but packed with tons of flavor.

I have this paper due in exactly nine hours and I spent the last three hours searching for one single quote that I swear I read in a PDF three days ago but now it has vanished from the face of the earth. I've checked my history I've checked my downloads and I even tried searching keywords on google scholar but nothing is coming up and I am starting to think I hallucinated the entire thing because of sleep deprivation. It is honestly so frustrating how you can have a whole argument planned out in your head but then you realize you dont have the actual evidence to back it up and now I'm stuck staring at a blinking cursor while my coffee is getting cold for the third time tonight. I keep trying to use those citation generators to save time but they always mess up the formatting and then I spend another hour fixing the italics and the commas which is just a complete waste of my life. Tbh I think I am more addicted to the feeling of being stressed about the essay than actually writing the essay because I keep checking my phone every five minutes even though I know nobody is texting me at 3 am except for maybe a scam bot. My desk is covered in empty energy drink cans and scrap paper that I cant even read anymore because my handwriting gets progressively worse as the night goes on. I tried that trick where you start writing in the middle of the paragraph instead of the intro but now I just have a bunch of random sentences that dont connect at all and it feels like a puzzle with missing pieces. I lowkey want to just give up and hope for a C but then I remember how much I'm paying for this degree and I get a fresh wave of anxiety that keeps me going for another twenty minutes. Everythng feels so much harder than it needs to be and I hate how the academic system makes you feel like a failure if you dont have every single comma in the right place according to some style guide that was written fifty years ago. I saw some people talking about using HelpWithEssay when they hit a wall and I am honestly so tempted right now because my brain has officially left the building and I am just a shell of a human being at this point. I just need to find this one source so I can finish this section and go to sleep for like four hours before my first class starts but the universe is clearly against me today. Does anyone else get that weird feeling where you've read so many articles that they all start sounding exactly the same and you forget which idea belongs to which author so you just sit there paralyzed by the fear of accidental plagiarism. It is literally the worst feeling ever and I wouldnt wish it on my worst enemy except mabye the prof who assigned this twenty page monster in the first place. I just want to be done with this semester so bad and I keep telling myself I will never let it get this late again but we all know that is a lie. My roommates are all asleep and the silence in the house is actually making me more stressed because every little creak sounds like the ghost of my failing GPA coming to haunt me. I think I am going to try searching for that source one last time and if I dont find it I am just going to paraphrase it and pray the prof doesnt ask for the specific page number because at this point it is a matter of survival. My eyes are actually burning from the blue light and I can feel a headache forming right behind my left eye which is definitely a sign that I should have started this three days ago when I had the chance.

now I'm experiencing irritability, lack of energy, extreme levels of anxiety, i get tired really quickly and sometimes super paranoid (which scares me af)

I've noticed my anxiety and paranoia mostly worsens around evening (peak concentration in plasma?)

sometimes making it impossible to be in public, and i started to self-isolate subconsciously because of this.

I quit all my bad habits, i don't even drink coffee anymore because i thought it was causing anxiety, but still i feel like something isn't right, but by psychiatrist tries to be ""cold-headed"" and hearing all my concerns (also completely ignoring my euphoric states) all he did is changing my mirtazapine dosage down to 30.

previously i started taking 300 instead of 375 without consulting with my psychiatrist and feel a bit better now, because at 375 thoughts were sticking to me and i couldn't get rid of them

First of all she isn’t your typical OW she is a criminal. Kamyar always seemed to be irritated by her presence. We were told they dated in the past but it must have been casual because who hangs out with their ex like a best friend? 

Secondly, kamyar is still madly in love with ayra. He keeps insulting fariya in ayra’s presence. Ayra also is clearly not insecure of fariya. Her presence makes her mad but not jealous or insecure. Yes you’d be mad too if your husband is drunk and comes into the room with another woman but she doesn’t believe kamyar has any interest in fariya. So the OW angle again doesn’t make sense. 

Let’s say kamyar’s mother doesn’t know of fariya’s involvement in the SA and video. Kamyar’s mother was cheated on by her husband but she is encouraging fariya to pursue her son by saying she always wanted fariya to marry her son?? 

Why are other supporting characters completely wiped from the story line. Where is ishtiaq? Naveen? Why aren’t we shown how falak and ishtiaq are faring?

1r024um,https://i.redd.it/cjkmuzihigig1.jpeg,"Moved to Portugal in Dec 2022: Here's What Nobody Tells You Before You Make the Leap (The Good, Bad, and Bureaucratic)","I'm Portuguese, my wife is Australian, and we moved here from Australia in December 2022. About three years in now, and I've helped dozens of expats navigate the move. Everyone gets blindsided by the same things, so here's the unfiltered version of moving to Portugal.

**The Cost of Living Reality Check**

Everyone hears ""Portugal is cheap!"" and books a one-way ticket. Let me break down what things actually cost in 2026:

**Lisbon (monthly for one person):**

* Studio apartment (decent area): €900-1,400
* One-bedroom (Arroios, Anjos, Alvalade): €1,100-1,600
* Utilities (electricity, water, internet): €90-140
* Groceries: €300-400
* Eating out (casual): €12-18 per meal
* Public transport pass: €40
* Gym membership: €40-60

**Porto (20-30% cheaper than Lisbon)** **Smaller cities like Coimbra, Braga (40-50% cheaper than Lisbon)** **Algarve coastal towns (similar to Lisbon in summer, cheaper in winter)**

The truth? Portugal's not ""dirt cheap"" anymore, especially in Lisbon. Prices have jumped significantly since 2022 when we arrived. But it's still 30-40% cheaper than London, Paris, or major US cities. Your €2,000/month goes much further here than it would in most Western European capitals.

**The Housing Hunt (This Will Test Your Patience)**

Finding a place to live in Portugal is... an experience. And it's gotten harder since we moved.

**What you need:**

* Portuguese tax number (NIF) - get this FIRST
* Bank account (some landlords insist on Portuguese bank accounts)
* Proof of income (usually 3x the rent)
* Employment contract or proof of remote work
* Sometimes: guarantor, 2-3 months deposit, first and last month's rent upfront

**Reality:**

* Facebook groups work better than official sites (seriously)
* ""Apartamento Lisboa/Porto Arrendamento"" groups are goldmines
* [Idealista.pt](http://Idealista.pt) is the main portal, but competition is fierce
* Good apartments disappear in hours
* Viewing appointments get overbooked - show up early
* Landlords often don't respond (it's cultural, not personal)
* New rent laws have changed things, but finding places is still competitive

**Pro tip:** Arrive with Airbnb for 2-4 weeks. Don't try to rent sight unseen from abroad unless you're using a relocation service.

**The Bureaucracy (Brace Yourself)**

Portuguese bureaucracy is legendary. Here's what you're in for:

**Essential documents in order:**

1. **NIF (Tax number)** \- Get at any Finanças office. Bring your passport. Takes 10 minutes. You need this for EVERYTHING.
2. **Bank account** \- Easier now for EU citizens. Non-EU needs residency permit first. Try ActivoBank, Millennium BCP, or N26 (online, easier process).
3. **Residency permit** (Non-EU only) - AIMA (immigration service) handles this. Book appointments online months in advance. Expect 6-12 month wait times. Yes, really.
4. **Social Security number (NISS)** \- For healthcare access. Get at Segurança Social office.
5. **Healthcare registration** \- Register at local health center (centro de saúde) once you have NISS.

**Things that will drive you insane:**

* Websites crash regularly
* Appointment systems fill up instantly
* ""Come back tomorrow"" is a standard response
* Documents need to be ""legalized"" (apostilled)
* Everything needs official translations
* Offices close for lunch
* Lines. So many lines.

**My advice:** Budget €500-1,000 for a despachante (document expediter) if you're non-EU. They navigate this nightmare professionally.

**Healthcare: Better Than You Think**

Portugal's SNS (public healthcare) is actually good:

* €0 for GP visits if registered
* Hospital emergency: €20-30
* Prescriptions heavily subsidized
* Quality is decent, wait times for specialists can be long

**Private healthcare is cheap:**

* Médis, Advancecare, Multicare: €50-90/month
* Specialist appointments: €70-120 (no referral needed)
* Private hospitals are excellent
* Most doctors speak English in cities

**Hot take:** Get private insurance anyway. €50-60/month gets you peace of mind and no waiting.

**The Language Barrier (It's Real)**

Here's where my wife's experience becomes relevant: She spent months learning Portuguese before we moved in late 2022. Problem? She learned Brazilian Portuguese from a popular app.

First week in Lisbon, she confidently ordered at restaurants, asked for directions, tried to make small talk. People understood her, but the looks she got... finally someone said ""You speak like a Brazilian!""

**European Portuguese vs Brazilian Portuguese:**

* Different pronunciation (European sounds more closed, consonant-heavy)
* Different vocabulary (rapariga vs moça, autocarro vs ônibus)
* Different verb conjugations (especially you/tu forms)
* Think: British English vs American English, but more extreme

This is actually why I started Portugal Lifestyle - to help expats learn the RIGHT Portuguese. Not Brazilian Portuguese. European Portuguese. The one that actually gets spoken here.

**Language reality:**

* **Lisbon/Porto/Algarve:** Most people under 40 speak English
* **Smaller towns/older people:** Portuguese only
* **Official stuff:** Everything's in Portuguese (obviously)
* **Job market:** Portuguese fluency opens way more doors

**Learning tips:**

* Practice European Portuguese specifically ([apps,](https://apps.apple.com/pt/app/portugal-lifestyle-pro/id6757080577?l=en-GB) tutors, classes)
* Watch Portuguese shows with subtitles (RTP Play is free)
* Radio helps with pronunciation
* Don't be shy - locals appreciate effort
* Expect to feel stupid for 6-12 months (normal)

**Making Friends (Harder Than You Think)**

Portuguese people are friendly but not immediately open. Some observations after three years:

**What works:**

* Language exchange meetups
* Sports clubs/gyms
* Coworking spaces (if remote)
* Expat groups (Facebook, [Meetup.com](http://Meetup.com), Internations)
* Volunteering
* Having kids (instant parent network)

**What doesn't work:**

* Expecting instant deep friendships
* Only hanging out with other expats (easy trap)
* Not learning Portuguese

**Cultural note:** Portuguese socializing centers on meals. Expect long lunches, longer dinners. Coffee breaks are sacred. Everything moves slower - this is intentional, not inefficiency.

**Working in Portugal**

**Options:**

1. **Remote work for foreign company** (easiest - keep your salary, live here)
2. **Portuguese company** (much lower salaries - €1,200-2,800/month is typical)
3. **Freelancing** (need to register as self-employed - ""trabalhar por conta própria"")
4. **Digital nomad visa** (passive income requirements apply)

**Tax situation:**

* NHR (Non-Habitual Resident) regime gives tax breaks for 10 years
* There have been changes to the NHR program, so check current rules
* Get an accountant - seriously, worth every euro
* Simplified regime for self-employed under certain thresholds

**Salaries in Portugal are LOW:**

* Junior positions: €1,100-1,600/month
* Mid-level: €1,600-2,800/month
* Senior: €2,800-4,500/month
* Tech can be higher (€3,500-7,000/month)

This is why most expats work remotely for non-Portuguese companies.

**Things I Wish I'd Known (Dec 2022 Edition)**

**Banking:**

* Cards get declined randomly (anti-fraud systems are aggressive)
* MB Way is essential (Portugal's payment app - works everywhere)
* International transfers are expensive (use Wise instead)
* Opening accounts has gotten stricter since we arrived

**Shopping:**

* Continente, Pingo Doce (big chains)
* Lidl, Aldi (cheap, good quality)
* Local markets (fresher produce, practice Portuguese)
* Sunday everything closes (stock up Saturday)

**Transportation:**

* Cars are expensive (import taxes, tolls, fuel, parking)
* Insurance costs €500-1,000/year
* Public transport is excellent in cities
* CP trains connect major cities (cheap, sometimes delayed)
* Bolt/Uber work great

**Utilities:**

* Electricity is expensive (€0.28-0.35 per kWh)
* Summer AC bills can hit €180-250/month
* Water is cheap
* Internet is fast and reliable (€35-50/month for fiber)

**Cultural Adjustments Nobody Mentions**

**Meal times:**

* Lunch: 12:30-2:30 PM (main meal)
* Dinner: 8-10 PM (later than you think)
* Breakfast is light (coffee + pastry)

**Social norms:**

* Greet shopkeepers when entering (""Bom dia/Boa tarde"")
* Two kisses greeting (cheek-to-cheek, even with strangers)
* Dress more formally than UK/US casual
* Punctuality is... flexible (add 15 minutes to any meeting)

**Work culture:**

* Long lunches are normal
* Work-life balance actually exists
* Hierarchy matters
* August is holiday month (everything slows down)

**The Weather Reality**

**What you expect:** Sunny paradise year-round

**What you get:**

* **Summer:** Hot (32-42°C), dry, perfect
* **Winter:** Rainy, cold (6-16°C), no central heating in most apartments
* **Spring/Fall:** Beautiful, mild, occasional rain

**Important:** Portuguese homes are built for summer. Our first winter (2023) was a shock - we were freezing inside. Budget for portable heaters.

**What's Changed Since We Moved (Dec 2022 - Now)**

**Housing market:** Significantly tighter. Rents have increased 20-30% in major cities.

**Tourism:** Post-COVID boom continues. Lisbon and Porto are packed during high season.

**Immigration:** More digital nomads and remote workers than ever. The expat community has exploded.

**Cost of living:** Groceries, utilities, dining out - everything's up 15-25% since late 2022.

**Visa rules:** Some programs have changed or been updated. Always check current requirements.

**The Things That Made Us Stay**

Despite bureaucracy and adjustments:

1. **Quality of life:** We actually have time. Dinners with friends, beach weekends, work doesn't consume everything.
2. **Safety:** I walk anywhere at midnight. My wife goes jogging alone. Can't say that about many places.
3. **Food:** Fresh, cheap, incredible. €12-15 gets you a great meal. Every neighborhood has its hidden gem restaurant.
4. **Community:** Once you break through, Portuguese friends are loyal for life.
5. **Pace:** Everything's slower. Initially frustrating, eventually liberating.
6. **Nature:** Beaches, mountains, countryside - all within an hour or two.

**The Things That Still Frustrate Us**

1. **Bureaucracy** (bears repeating)
2. **Everything takes forever** (repairs, deliveries, appointments)
3. **Customer service** is... different (not rude, just not hurried)
4. **Salaries** vs cost of living for locals is rough
5. **Housing market** has gotten increasingly difficult

**Should You Move Here?**

**Yes, if:**

* You work remotely or have passive income
* You value lifestyle over career advancement
* You're patient with bureaucracy
* You want work-life balance
* You like slow living

**No, if:**

* You need high salaries
* You hate inefficiency
* You expect Northern European organization
* You don't like adapting to new cultures
* You want things done fast

**Final Thoughts**

Moving to Portugal isn't relocating to paradise. It's trading one set of problems for another. But for us? Totally worth it.

The first year is hard. You'll question your decision. You'll miss home. You'll rage at bureaucracy. Then something shifts. You start understanding the rhythm. Making friends. Finding your coffee spot. Appreciating the sunshine. Getting invited to family lunches.

Three years in, we're not leaving. This is home now.

**Happy to answer specific questions about:**

* Visas (D7, Golden Visa, Digital Nomad)
* Specific cities/regions
* Remote work setup
* Family moves
* Pet relocation
* Learning European Portuguese (not Brazilian!)
* Anything else Portugal-related

I’ve been in this Discord server for a few weeks adter hearing about the ""Adapted ORB Strategy"", and last week it all clicked.

The Setup: someone called out $ELPW on the scanner before the bell. The RVOL was absolutely screaming (over 10x the average) and it had that low-float explosive potential we always talk about.

The Trade: Market opened and I watched the first 5-minute candle form. The moment it closed and broke the high on massive volume, I took my entry. Literally minutes later, this thing skyrocketed nearly 100% and got slapped with a Volatility Halt.

The Result: I didn't just ""get lucky."" I followed the exit rules they teach. Selling into the strength before the reversal started. I walked away with a massive win before most people even had their morning coffee.

If you’re tired of chasing ""pump and dump"" alerts and actually want to understand how to find these plays before they halt, you need to be in this group. The strategy alone is a cheat code, but the education on how to actually manage the trade is what makes the difference.

Stop gambling and start trading the opening range properly.

Ondanks de angstverhalen hier (sommige mensen zijn 1 jaar werkeloos of erger komen niet eens aan de bak, terwijl ze net klaar met hun studie zijn) , heb ik in <1 maand, zonder perse hectisch te doen of te zijn een leuke nieuwe baan gevonden, nadat ik in januari weggestuurd ben (contract niet verlengd, op zich ook logisch, vorig jaar was een rot jaar. Ziekgemeld, huizenzoektocht etc.).

Deze nieuwe baan begin ik vanuit stabiliteit (heb nu een fijne woning) en rust. En zelfs fijnere voorwaarden en een lichte groei in salaris (volume, 40H > 36H), TC komt uit op 57K per jaar (4,75K per maand bruto en wat voor 36h netjes is), ik ben verder 25 jaar en in een sector die groeiend, robuust en vooral stabiel is. En zoals je ziet, het is mijn droombaan.

Het enige advies wat ik zou geven is houd je contacten warm en wees niet bang om ergens een 2e keer te solliciteren (De mijne is uiteindelijk uitgekomen uit de 2025 campagne en salespipeline van toen). Ik heb verder mijn Linkedin ook uitgezet, omdat ik niet meer met de volgende stap bezig hoef te zijn.

edit: ik zit verder in een technische hoek / LEAN, maar bewust naar een sector verhuisd die niet cyclisch is, eerder defensief is. Ik ben dat cyclische gedoe een beetje zat, en nu kom ik op een leeftijd waar ik echt de komende 5 jaar bij een fijn bedrijf mezelf kan opbouwen. ",2,1770637562.0,werkzaken,1,0.75,False

Got stopped twice at the bodega asking if these were real. Distressed toe looks intentional, not sloppy. But my arches screamed after 3 hours—cute, not comfy.

Heavy as hell. Like, “did they pour concrete in the sole?” heavy. But that CD logo catches streetlight just right. Paired with black jeans and suddenly I look like I have a trust fund.

$ 15 for 3 pairs? Hard pass. First wash: one shrank to toddler size, second lost the swoosh like a sad sticker, third developed a heel hole before I even left the house. Felt like wearing tissue paper. Stick to Uniqlo. Or literally anything else.

That compass patch on the sleeve? Still crisp after two washes. Fabric’s thick enough for 50°F mornings but won’t cook you. Threw it on with jeans and called it a fit. Zero effort.

Back says “CORTEIZ” with a crown + French text I can’t pronounce. Front’s completely blank—love that. Stranger said “nice hoodie,” zero follow-up. Vibe over logo, always.

Tiny scribble logo on chest—barely visible unless you’re staring. Fit’s relaxed but not drowning me. Perfect for days I want to look intentional without screaming “I tried.”

Mini box logo on thigh = quiet flex. Elastic cuffs stay put, no sagging when I crouch for the dog. Wore these to walk the block and felt zero guilt about being comfy.

1r022ld,https://www.reddit.com/r/shanghai/comments/1r022ld/some_practical_questions_for_a_move_to_shanghai/,some practical questions for a move to Shanghai,"Hi everyone,

I will be moving to SH in mid/end February for an exchange (one semester, taught in Chinese), and I have some practical questions about life there. If you could answer any of the questions or have general tips, I would be very grateful :)

For context: I am from Central Europe. I will go for a Chinese-taught university exchange. I have a room on campus and about 800–900€ (\~6,500–7,300 RMB) per month, but I want to save some of that amount. The rent is already paid in advance, so the money is just for living expenses. I lived in Taipei for a year and my Chinese is about HSK 6. I was in China for one week before, but that was for a competition, so I didn’t really have to survive on my own. I will have six days before entering my dorm, for which I’ll stay in an affordable hotel.

My questions are:

1. When ordering food (online), are there big differences in hygiene and freshness? Are there some restaurants to avoid / some you’d personally recommend?
2. Do you have any recommendations for study spots (e.g. cozy coffee shops, libraries, etc., or something with a nice view)?
3. I would like to get a haircut (for women, as I am one). Can you recommend any good salons with reasonable prices?
4. I can get a SIM card on campus on February 28th, but I will arrive on February 20th. Will I have to pay exorbitant prices if I get one at the airport? Do you have any recommendations for good, reliable packages? I am used to having unlimited data here, so I don’t know how much is needed, especially if I have to rely much more on my phone.
5. When I arrive at the airport, I would like to take a cab to my hotel. I know that if I get a DiDi, the price is displayed before I get in. Is it the same for the airport taxis? How do I avoid being overcharged once I get off? I have had the experience (not in China) that they get you in with cheaper prices, but once you want to leave, they demand double. I am white, short, and a woman, so I may look “easy to scam.”
6. I have to (and want to) open a bank account. I am a student and will only need it (for now) until July. Our university gave us recommendations for a bank. Do I just walk into the bank and apply, or is that done online? I am thinking of doing that right away since I have to pay a pretty high fee every time I use Alipay with a foreign card.
7. Are there any apps to get recommendations from (review-apps?) ? ex: for massages, restaurants etc etc

These are the questions I was asking myself while preparing for my travel, but I’m sure there are many more that I can’t think of without being there. So if there is anything that you had to figure out yourself that was a bit tricky, etc., I would be very grateful if you could share it.

1r02264,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r02264,Type me based on bingo cards and description please,"I put dots on things that fit me good and circled the ones that are a part of my constant personality.

I'll explain my bingo cards here for each Enneagram, maybe it helps expand the picture.

1. I don't want to make mistakes so I am perfectionistic. 
I want to be in control since I dislike being told what to do.
I am reliable when it comes to tasks and other duties.
I usually can't let go of details that keep bugging me and I overthink.
I am very self-critical and critical of others. I'm critical of what they are doing and what I am doing. Every mistake I also beat myself up on. Not critical of looks, morals or personality in others but in myself yes.

2. I dislike being told that something I did was wrong or that I'm bad at something, I'm usually fully aware and don't need external output for it. I also hate criticism that is based on personal opinion and not on provable fault.
I don't like others doing anything for me because I don't think I'm worth their time and effort.
I tend to forget my needs because it's not a priority, but neither are other people's needs.
I also dislike haunting thoughts of what others are thinking about me because I know I'm biased and will never know what they actually think.

3. I crave for validation a lot. I want to be seen and praised.
I want to be successful but often lack the means and energy to do so.
I hate feeling like I am useless or a bystander, but that often is the case because I'm too insecure to partake in anything.
I'm also competitive, because I simply just don't like being ""insulted"" about how I am worse than the winner.
If I do win I also don't boast about it because I know it *can* feel bad for some other people.

4. I always dressed up weirdly and often got bullied for it, I never followed trends. I just wore what I wanted. Same with music. People bullied my music taste. They bullied my art as well, because I refused to do ""their"" style of art and did my own thing instead. In adult life mostly nobody cares anymore though which is relieving and allows me to be myself.
Part of this comes with not wanting to be a sheep that follows the herd. I want to think for myself.
I fear abandonment because I experienced it too much in my childhood.
I'm self-reflective and introspective but mostly to understand my negative emotions and what I am capable of, and what I can change in myself. 
I often experience an existential crisis as I tend to go into rabbitholes of philosophy in my mind.

5. I hate being intruded. I'm usually very deep in thought or when I am doing my own thing, I get infuriated if someone intrudes me. Same with people asking too much about my personal life and emotions. Same with people wanting to come to my house without warning. Same with someone intruding my peaceful morning coffee. 
I have to intellectualise everything in order to feel safe, I have to analyse and make rational sense of things, if I don't I'm prone to deep paranoia.
I talked about feeling useless in part 3.
I am stubborn because my way is often the best way to do things, I will listen to feedback but often it would result in a worse outcome than my own predicted outcome so I ignore it, or take just bits and pieces of advice/rules/guides w/e.
I'm very curious and feel like I need to know everything. Especially in things I'm interested in. I get hundreds of random thoughts and ideas daily that I just need to figure out and know about and if I can't I just write them down and return later.

6. ""What if"" could be my motto. I say that daily probably 15-20 times. I'm very paranoid of bad possible outcomes or potential problems.
I need proof of many things. I'm paranoid and won't believe anything without shown ""this is real"". I often get stuck in conspiracies and delusions because I try to figure out if it could be true. ""What if..."" This ""what if"" phenomena comes daily in house life too. Like, what if my washing machine just explodes suddenly or if I catch carbon monoxide poisoning from my frying pan? Like sometimes people tell me to stop having such unrealistic fears that make no sense, but it just doesn't help to be ""reassured"". My fear doesn't go anywhere. These possibilities keep haunting me, especially health anxiety and catarasthope anxiety.
I fear betrayal because it's a real thing that happens often.
I also don't trust others because why would I? Trust is needed for stable healthy relationships but I am quite incapable of it even when I try. After 4 years of knowing someone, I still don't trust them even 50%. You can never know the full motives of other people and it hinders me. This is why I also have very very few select friends. I don't want to be taken advantage of, gossiped about, lied to or presented with a fake persona from someone. I'm also terrible at spotting ingenuine and dishonest people so it makes things even worse.

7. I dislike repetition but not routine. I actually get sick of doing the same stuff everyday, but daily routines in itself aren't tough to manage for me.
I can be self-absorbed but it mostly roots in feeling like nobody knows better than me, even when they would...
I get overindulgent in things quite often.

8. Skeptical yes. Wanting to fix issues immediately also comes down to my overthinking loop. I just want to get it over with so it stops haunting me.
I put on a hard exterior to hide that I'm vulnerable. But I become impulsive very quickly so that mask can slip easily if someone pisses me off.
I also want to protect and be on the side of other vulnerable people and I often get attracted to them as well. I feel like I have to help or I have to understand them because nobody else did. I root for the outcasts and for the ""villains"", because everyone deserves their shield. It also feels relatable.
I was bullied in school and it made me upset. If I saw other kids being bullied I would always step in if I saw the opportunity to protect them and punish the idiot who does that to someone weaker than them.
My family was also very impulsive. This all grew on me so I became very assertive and very argumentative. 

9. I can be indecisive because I overthink. 
I also dislike when nobody listens to me because it's not fun being ignored.",1,1770637443.0,EnneagramTypeMe,0,0.67,False

This cycling safari takes travelers beyond traditional game drives and invites them to experience Tanzania at human pace, where every kilometer tells a story.

Beginning at the base of the [**world’s highest free-standing mountain,**](https://ahsantetours.com/cycling/) **Mount Kilimanjaro**, and stretching toward the **Ngorongoro Crater**, the largest intact volcanic caldera on Earth, this journey passes through some of Africa’s most iconic and meaningful landscapes. While Kilimanjaro and Ngorongoro are global highlights, the true richness of this cycling safari lies in everything in between.

[Cycling Safari.](https://preview.redd.it/jw6x84wdhgig1.jpg?width=6720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=877bfaae656a5ece4effc0488b01e04c8a382543)

# What Is a Cycling Safari in Northern Tanzania?

A cycling safari is a guided, supported bicycle journey through carefully selected routes that combine **scenic beauty, wildlife zones, rural communities, and cultural heritage sites**. Unlike conventional safaris that rely on vehicles, cycling allows travelers to move slowly, observe closely, and engage respectfully with the environment and local people.

This particular route follows Tanzania’s legendary **Northern Circuit**, linking regions around Kilimanjaro, Arusha, Lake Manyara, Maasai lands, and the Ngorongoro Conservation Area. Riders travel on a mix of quiet tarmac roads, gravel tracks, and countryside paths, all chosen for safety, scenery, and cultural value.

Professional support vehicles, experienced cycling guides, and local experts accompany the journey, ensuring comfort, safety, and flexibility throughout the tour.

# From Kilimanjaro’s Foothills to Ngorongoro’s Ancient Caldera.

The journey begins in the fertile landscapes surrounding Mount Kilimanjaro, where volcanic soils support banana farms, coffee plantations, and traditional Chagga villages. Cycling here offers a rare opportunity to see daily life unfold children walking to school, farmers tending crops, and snow-capped Kilimanjaro rising quietly in the background.

As the route continues westward, the environment gradually changes. Lush highlands give way to open savannahs, acacia woodlands, and expansive plains. Along the way, travelers encounter Maasai communities, ancient trading routes, and wildlife corridors that connect national parks and conservation areas.

The journey culminates near the [**Ngorongoro Crater**,](https://ahsantetours.com/cycling/) a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most biologically dense wildlife areas in Africa. Reaching this geological wonder by bicycle adds a profound sense of scale, accomplishment, and respect for the land.

# Cultural Encounters That Define the Experience.

One of the most powerful aspects of a cycling safari is **authentic cultural interaction**. Traveling by bicycle removes barriers and invites natural connection. Locals greet cyclists with curiosity and warmth, conversations happen organically, and cultural exchanges feel genuine rather than staged.

Along the route, travelers learn about:

* Traditional farming and pastoral lifestyles
* Maasai culture, customs, and land stewardship
* Local markets, schools, and village life
* How tourism, conservation, and community development intersect

These encounters create understanding and awareness, making the journey as educational as it is adventurous.

# Why Cycling Safaris Matter: Sustainability and Responsibility.

Cycling safaris represent a [**responsible and sustainable form of tourism**.](https://ahsantetours.com/cycling/) By minimizing environmental impact, supporting local economies, and promoting slow travel, they align closely with modern values of ethical exploration.

[](https://medium.com/plans?source=upgrade_membership---post_li_non_moc_upsell--c8668b65d00f---------------------------------------)

Key benefits include:

* **Low carbon footprint** compared to vehicle-heavy tourism
* Direct support for local guides, communities, and suppliers
* Greater appreciation for conservation efforts and ecosystems
* Encouragement of physical wellness and mindful travel

For travelers seeking meaningful experiences rather than passive sightseeing, cycling offers a deeper connection to Tanzania’s landscapes and people.

I’m considering buying a coffee roaster and noticed that Alibaba has a lot of options at much lower prices than local suppliers. I’m trying to figure out if the savings are really worth it, especially since quality and reliability are so important for consistent roasting.

I’d love to hear from anyone who has experience with Alibaba roasters. How was the build quality compared to what you expected? Did the roaster perform as described, or were there issues with specs or functionality? How was your experience with shipping, customs, or import fees and did it end up costing more than anticipated? Did the supplier offer any warranty or after-sales support? Would you recommend buying a roaster from Alibaba for home use or small-scale roasting?

Any advice, tips for verifying suppliers, or personal experiences would be really helpful. I want to make sure I don’t compromise quality just to save a few hundred dollars.

I’ve noticed that what really sets it apart is the setting. It’s not just a resort built in greenery; it’s spread across a working coffee and spice plantation. That makes the stay feel calm, immersive, and very “Coorg.” Early morning walks here feel different mist, birds and the smell of coffee plants all around.

Another reason people rate it so highly is the **private pool villas**. Many resorts in Coorg are beautiful, but very few offer this level of privacy and space. It’s ideal for couples, honeymooners, or even families who want quiet time without feeling crowded.

The service is also consistently praised. Staff interactions feel warm rather than formal, and experiences like plantation tours, local cuisine, and cultural touches make the stay memorable rather than generic luxury.

Of course, resorts like Taj Madikeri or The Tamara Coorg are also excellent. But if your priority is **privacy, nature and a distinctive Coorg identity**, Evolve Back often comes out on top for many travelers.

That’s why, when someone asks Which is the best resort in Coorg? **Evolve Back Coorg** is usually my first recommendation.",1,1770636611.0,u_Key-Badger5677,0,1.0,False

(seasons, months) of Katy ?","A recent post on here had me thinking about the early days of her mainstream pop career, and I think for me, I really miss that time period, I’d say around mid 2009, to about mid 2010, where:

\- Katy had achieved success with her OOTB era. She had an image/brand established, a “vibe”, and was already considered to be a top artist. The OOTB era was dying down but she was still very much in the mix

\- late 2009, early 2010, when she was releasing feature collabs with other artists. The “in between” era. 

\- spring 2010, when California Gurls was released. I don’t know about you guys but I remember the first time I heard this song on my Mom’s computer desktop on YouTube very, very clearly. I don’t think I’d heard anything quite like it before and i remember just feeling this euphoric, fun bubbly rush as the song progressed. I think by the first “ah ah, oh oh oh” I felt like I was a Barbie doll playing volleyball on the beach. This sound was NEW and peak youth brain novelty .

\- early summer, when the song began to pop off. Katy still was very much Katy from OOTB but with this new song sprinkled into our minds. “Pop/rock with a pinch of sugar”

\-summer, when Teenage Dream was released  as a single. I remember the single art on iTunes. I think I bought it before I listened(?) and I also remember the first time I pressed play at said desktop, but not as vividly as California Gurls, unfortunately. 

\- late July/early August, when I was still burning songs onto CD’s and using my Walkman. I made a CD that had other recent releases singles, and I would play it and go for walks to other local towns with the sun burning down on me. I think that’s why to this day I have such a visceral reaction to TD the song. I remember the heat, the way the sun felt on my skin, the explosive chorus filling my headphones. Even the streets I was on when the song would come on. 

\- early September. I just started high school, and I began to get into buying magazines with celebrities on the cover that I liked. I would play the CD disc for TD as I would walk to the Walmart that was half an hour from my house. And this is where I began to fall in love with TD. I remember what streets I would be on when certain songs would play, it tended to be the same spots because I would play it front to back for the most part. I remember the first few times hearing Firework, but I specifically remember when I heard it for maybe the 3 or 4th time and thought to myself “wow… this is good. But, like, \*really\* good”. Whenever I play the album, to this day, my mind goes on that walk to Walmart. 

That is where I end it. The rest is history and here I am 16 years later typing about it at 6:30 with ADHD brain in the morning after having coffee and opening Reddit 😂 

I would love to know what specific times and eras you miss of Katy; where you were, what you were doing, what you felt. All of it 😂 let’s go back

How do I shortlist a base to book?,"If London area advice is melting your brain, it’s usually because you’re trying to pick the “best” neighbourhood. London doesn’t really work like that. The faster move is to force a shortlist based on a few trade offs you can actually book.



Quick answer (60 seconds)

1) Pick your week trade off: more central access vs a calmer base that’s still practical by Tube

2) Pick your default movement style: walk first or Tube first

3) Optimise for one main line most days, plus one useful interchange

4) Pick one doorstep priority: food and coffee, parks, museums and theatre, shopping, or easiest arrival and departure

5) Use noise tolerance as a filter, not an afterthought

6) Treat zones as a frame, not a ranking

7) Compare totals like for like, not teaser prices



If you’re torn between two “right” bases, one simple switch can be a better solution than forcing one area to do everything (you get two London vibes, but only one move).



The Hotel Splitter team built London Base Finder to apply this method consistently.

It asks a few questions and returns:

\- Top 3 single base options

\- One optional two base plan (one manageable switch)

\- A share link that recreates the same shortlist

1r01jul,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindfullyDriven/comments/1r01jul/the_psychology_of_discipline_10_sciencebased/,The Psychology of Discipline: 10 Science-Based Rules That Actually Work,"I've spent the last two years diving deep into discipline research. Books like Atomic Habits, Can't Hurt Me, The Willpower Instinct. Podcasts from Huberman, Rich Roll, Tim Ferriss. YouTube deep dives on stoicism and habit formation. I wanted to crack the code because I was tired of being that person who starts strong Monday morning and crashes by Wednesday afternoon.



Here's what nobody tells you about discipline: it's not some genetic trait certain people are born with. The science is pretty clear on this. Your prefrontal cortex, the part responsible for self control, is like a muscle. It gets stronger with use but also fatigues. Society sells us this myth that disciplined people just have more willpower, but that's bullshit. They've just built better systems.



The truth is, most of us are fighting against our own biology. Our brains are wired for immediate gratification, not delayed rewards. We evolved to conserve energy, not crush workouts at 6am. But here's the good news: you can rewire these patterns. Neuroplasticity is real, and these 10 rules are based on actual mechanisms that make behavior change stick.



**\*\*Start absurdly small.\*\*** I'm talking embarrassingly small. Want to read more? Start with one page. Want to work out? Do five pushups. James Clear talks about this extensively in Atomic Habits, and he's right. The biggest mistake people make is going too hard too fast. Your brain needs proof that you can succeed before it trusts the new habit. BJ Fogg's research at Stanford shows that motivation is unreliable, but tiny habits compound. Make it so easy you can't say no.



**\*\*Never break the chain twice.\*\*** This comes from Jerry Seinfeld's productivity method. Miss one day, fine. Life happens. But missing two days starts a pattern, and patterns become identity. The Willpower Instinct by Kelly McGonigal (Stanford psychologist) breaks down why this matters. When you break a streak, your brain starts categorizing you as ""someone who doesn't do this thing."" One missed workout is a blip. Two is a trend. Three is your new normal.



**\*\*Stack your habits.\*\*** After I brush my teeth, I do ten squats. After I pour coffee, I journal for two minutes. This is implementation intention research in action. Charles Duhigg covers this beautifully in The Power of Habit. Your brain loves connecting existing routines to new behaviors because it's metabolically efficient. The Morning Brew podcast had an entire episode on this, basically it's hijacking neural pathways that already exist rather than building new ones from scratch.



**\*\*Track everything ruthlessly.\*\*** Get the [Streaks](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/streaks/id963034692) app or just use a basic habit tracker. I cannot overstate how powerful this is. There's something primal about not wanting to break a visual chain of green checkmarks. Peter Drucker said ""what gets measured gets managed,"" and he wasn't lying. The data also shows you patterns you'd never notice otherwise. Maybe you always skip the gym on Thursdays because you're mentally fried. Now you can plan around that.



If you're looking to go deeper on habit formation but find dense psychology books exhausting,[ BeFreed ](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450)is worth checking out. It's an AI learning app built by a team from Columbia and Google that turns books like Atomic Habits, research papers, and expert insights into personalized audio learning. You set a goal like ""I want to build discipline but keep breaking my streaks"" and it generates a structured learning plan pulling from habit science, willpower research, and real behavioral strategies. You can customize the depth too, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples. The voice options are surprisingly addictive, I use the sarcastic tone that makes dense psychology easier to digest during my commute.



**\*\*Design your environment like your willpower doesn't exist.\*\*** Because honestly, it doesn't. Willpower is a finite resource that depletes throughout the day. This is called ego depletion, and while the research is debated, the practical application works. Want to eat healthier? Don't buy junk food. Want to read more? Put your phone in another room and leave a book on your pillow. David Goggins talks about this in Can't Hurt Me, he became a Navy SEAL partly because he put himself in environments where quitting wasn't an option. Be your own architect.



**\*\*Embrace the suck consciously.\*\*** This sounds stupid but it works. When you're in the hard moment, the moment you want to quit, say out loud ""this is the moment that matters."" Rich Roll talks about this constantly on his podcast. Most people avoid discomfort at all costs, but discipline is literally just getting comfortable being uncomfortable. The Huberman Lab podcast did an entire episode on how anticipating dopamine spikes from difficult tasks can rewire your reward system. Your brain will eventually start associating hard things with positive feelings.



**\*\*Schedule everything, especially the boring stuff.\*\*** If it's not on your calendar, it doesn't exist. Time blocking changed my life. Cal Newport's Deep Work makes this point beautifully. Discipline isn't about motivation, it's about systems. Motivation is fleeting. Systems are permanent. I have ""drink water"" blocked out at 10am, 2pm, and 6pm because I'm an idiot who forgets to hydrate. Seems excessive? Maybe. But I'm disciplined about hydration now.



**\*\*Find your why or you'll quit when it's hard.\*\*** This is the Simon Sinek golden circle stuff, but it's true. You need a reason deeper than ""I should do this."" Why do you want discipline? For me, it was realizing I was becoming someone I didn't respect. That's powerful fuel. The podcast On Purpose with Jay Shetty has incredible episodes about finding intrinsic motivation. External motivation works for maybe two weeks. Internal motivation is unlimited.



**\*\*Rest is part of the system, not failure.\*\*** This is huge. The fitness app [WHOOP](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/whoop/id933944389) tracks recovery metrics, and it's completely changed how I think about rest days. You're not lazy for resting. You're strategic. Matthew Walker's Why We Sleep is genuinely life changing on this topic. He's a Berkeley neuroscientist who spent 20 years studying sleep, and his research shows that consistent rest actually amplifies discipline in other areas. Your nervous system needs recovery to perform optimally.



**\*\*Forgive yourself immediately and move forward.\*\*** This is the most important rule. Self compassion research from Kristin Neff shows that beating yourself up after failure actually makes you more likely to fail again. It's counterintuitive as hell. You'd think harsh self criticism would motivate you, but it just triggers shame spirals. The Tara Brach podcast covers this beautifully. When you mess up, and you will, just say ""that happened, what's next?"" and move on. Discipline is a practice, not a destination.



Look, I'm not claiming I've mastered this. Some days I still doom scroll for an hour instead of reading. But these rules have taken me from completely undisciplined to mostly consistent, and that's honestly enough. Progress over perfection. The research is clear: small, consistent actions compound into unrecognizable transformation over time. You just have to start.

I'd play 2-4 hours a day in the week, 5-10 hours a day in the weekend. Growing older, corn came into play. Binged that ever since. Every possible gaming console was purchased, had multiple gaming PC's in the last 15 years. Gamed close to 30k hours total if I make a guess.

My whole life has been spent behind a computer or TV screen. 

Growing older and older, I obviously saw my dopamine baseline (needed for a *hit*) rise more and more. Where I was watching TV shows in Uni, maybe 2 or 3 episodes per week, I'm now  binging series on Netflix, watching 1 or 2 seasons of a show in a weeks time, ON TOP of gaming the same amount. Corn usage also spiralled out of control. Up to the point where it is needed to even get aroused. 

I'm wasting sleep time as well. Literally glued to my gaming chair yawning looking at the clock that shows 0:17 AM when I have to get up at 6:10 in the morning. 

I'm 34 now and the past months I have flatlined completely. Nothing gives pleasure anymore.   
I wake up with the most insane brain fog, not even feeling present in this world. I've accumulated a decade long sleep debt.

I honestly can't believe I've managed to function at work so far. So far, because the last months things went bad. Less performance, making stupid errors, forgetting a meeting. And my coffee usage went from 2 cups a day for years to about 4 a day the past year.  

Growing up as a teen I clearly had ADHD, at age 17 came more the focus part, where grades completely dropped. Trouble focussing. At age 33 came the official diagnosis everybody allready knew, ADHD (technically ADD). Tried meds for it, but that didn't work out. 

Maybe rock bottom is what you need to make a change, I know I've been a dopamine addict for 21 years now. Time to turn my life around.

One thing I really hate is making coffee first thing in the morning. I’m not a morning person, and especially not the second I open my eyes. I like a few minutes to wake up, scroll, or just exist before doing anything.

The issue is: as soon as I open my eyes, he immediately says, “Can you please make us coffee, babe?” Not after I’m up. Not after I’ve had a moment. Literally the second I wake up.

If I say no because I’m tired, or I say “wait a bit,” he says I’m being selfish. If I don’t end up making it, he sulks and the mood is off so most of the time I feel like I have no choice but to just do it to avoid tension.

I already do most of the cooking and cleaning, and this one thing just really gets under my skin. But now I’m starting to feel genuinely bad and wonder if I am selfish, since he provides financially and it’s “just coffee.”

So… AITAH for not wanting to make coffee every morning the moment I wake up?

EDIT: To add some context, his reasoning is that he expects me to make coffee in the mornings because on weekends he’ll order and deliver us breakfast or coffee, and he also buys me gifts or gives me money when I need things. That’s partly why I’ve been second-guessing myself and worrying that I’m being unfair or lazy. But the issue for me isn’t making coffee occasionally.. it’s that it’s expected the moment I wake up, and if I say no or ask for time, he sulks until I give in.",1,1770634862.0,AITAH,39,0.6,False

I was still pulling good shots, but wanted to get rid of that ""inconsistency"" and so i tried filling with the plunger down. This does fix the disturbance of the puck (i.e. there is no disturbance on the surface of the puck after extracting), but for some reason there is way less puck resistance when pulling the shot. This means I have to grind significantly finer with the same coffee to get a comparable profile. I'm tracking this with the Pressensor and the Acai Lunar. 

Any ideas on what's going on? My only theory is that the puck is lifted when i raise the piston, although I do this as slowly as possible and there is nothing suggesting this is happening when I look at the espresso coming through the basket. Anyone else also noticed this?

During the viewing they seemed quiet and “almost never home,” but the reality is the opposite: they’re home almost all the time, often loud (talking loudly, laughing, singing), repeatedly break quiet hours (showering/doing dishes/unloading the dishwasher at 1 a.m.), barely communicate with us, and create a very uncomfortable atmosphere. They also moved/removed furniture from the room (mattress, boxes, chair) without asking, later blaming a dust allergy. There have also been conflicts about cleaning. We’re considering giving them a two-month notice, but we’re worried we might be overreacting and that they could end up without housing.

\----------------------------------------------------  
This is going to be really long. I write short stories, and when I get going, I really get going. I apologize in advance, but I want to describe everything as accurately and fairly as possible.

My girlfriend (24F) and I (26M) live in a large apartment in one of the major European cities. We have two large rooms, a big dining room, a separate bathroom and toilet, and a smaller kitchen. We moved in about two years ago. Originally, we lived here with a friend (27F) and her brother (20M), both of whom were in the city for university. About a year and a half ago, they graduated and moved out, and we stayed in the apartment alone.

For a while we enjoyed the privacy, but honestly the apartment is quite expensive, and we weren’t using one of the big rooms at all for several months. We’re also used to having roommates. From previous shared apartments, we’ve made many friends, and we’ve never had any issues. Quite the opposite. The only reason none of our friends live with us now is that we’re in a less attractive part of the city for young people lots of forests and parks, very quiet, more suitable for families with kids. The friends who would want to live here are mostly students, and the rent for the room (which is really big and spacious) is relatively expensive for them.

So we posted an ad. Dozens of people responded. In the end, we chose two girls (21F and 23F) who are a couple. For anonymity, let’s call them Vera and Lulu.

At the viewing, Lulu did most of the talking. They both said they were very quiet, spent most of their time at work or school, were social, and would be happy to occasionally have coffee with us, eat together in the dining room, or play some games (I play games, and Lulu said she does too). That’s something we’re used to as I mentioned, most of our former roommates are now our friends. They were extremely eager to move in and said they had been rejected everywhere else for months while looking for housing. Overall, they presented themselves as very calm, easygoing people and said there wouldn’t be any problems with them.

During the viewing, we clearly told them that the furniture was part of the room. That included an extra mattress, which we agreed they would store in the built-in wardrobe. The room has a huge built-in closet covering an entire wall, and part of the storage space above the door is used by the landlord (who lives below us) to store some old dishes. We said it would be great if everything could stay as it was. They agreed that it wasn’t a problem.

We signed a sublease agreement we are the main tenants, they are subtenants. The first few days seemed fine. I ran into Lulu in the kitchen a few times, we had coffee, but the conversations mostly revolved around legal or work-related issues she needed help with. Vera barely communicated with us from the start.

During the first week, we noticed they were constantly cleaning. We’re quite clean ourselves, but they vacuumed multiple times a day, even late at night. We just thought they were very thorough.

About ten days after they moved in, my girlfriend and I went to visit her parents in a neighboring country for two weeks. When we came back, we were shocked. The mattress from their room had been put out on the staircase. Boxes from the closet were taken out into the dining room. The chair that was part of the room’s furniture was also removed. There was not a single message about this in our shared apartment chat.

When I asked them about it, they said Vera has a dust allergy (this had never been mentioned before, not even at the viewing when we discussed cleaning and furniture). They said they needed the entire closet because Vera has a lot of things and otherwise wouldn’t fit. They also said they didn’t like the chair. Even though this broke our agreement, we decided not to escalate it further.

Since then, however, the problems have been piling up.

At the viewing, they said they were rarely home. In reality, it’s the opposite. They are home almost all the time. Vera is home nearly the entire day; Lulu goes to work occasionally. As far as we can tell, they don’t have any friends here they only spend time together and occasionally call their parents.

They said they were quiet and calm. In reality, they are very loud. They constantly talk and laugh loudly sometimes to the point that it’s genuinely disturbing. They sing (they met in a choir), even in the evenings or late at night. The peak was when they started showering, doing dishes, or unloading the dishwasher at 1 a.m. I messaged them in our group chat asking them to please respect quiet hours. It improved slightly, but they still regularly break it, always with excuses like “I was studying late,” “I was at my parents’ place,” or “I got home late from work.” I understand that if someone gets home late from work, they need to shower but does it really have to be a 30-minute shower with singing and whistling?

Since we came back from our trip, they barely talk to us. Often they don’t even say hello unless we greet them first. They behave as if it’s their apartment and we are somehow invading their space. The atmosphere is extremely bad. When I come home, I don’t feel comfortable. I don’t feel like I’m coming home.

We try to be considerate we speak quietly and close the kitchen door when we’re in there. They often leave their room and kitchen doors open and shout across the hallway. Or they turn on the TV loudly and leave the door open so the noise carries through the whole apartment.

Recently, I suggested we should sit down and talk. Their response was that they feel there’s a bad atmosphere in the apartment basically implying it’s our fault and that we are stressing them out. They said they know we were used to more social roommates, but that Vera is introverted and Lulu is tired from work and doesn’t have the energy to socialize. This was followed by messages along the lines of: “It doesn’t suit us, but we’re not going to change anything.”

So we’re living with people who barely communicate with us, are loud, and in 2–3 months we’ve exchanged maybe two sentences with Vera.



Recently, Vera snapped at my girlfriend about cleaning. We rotate weekly cleaning duties and also clean continuously during the week, but once a week we do a bigger cleaning, usually on the weekend. On Wednesday, Vera confronted my girlfriend, saying there was dust and hair in the bathroom and that she had to clean it for us, that it was unacceptable. It was literally just a few hairs left behind after she had brushed her own hair. Later, Lulu secretly apologized (so Vera wouldn’t hear), saying Vera is stressed and has a lot going on.

Vera never addresses anything directly with us. She tells Lulu, and Lulu communicates for both of them, usually through chat.

And now something that honestly really shocked me. I noticed that when I or my girlfriend are using the toilet, one of them knocks, realizes it’s occupied… and instead of waiting, she goes into the bathroom and urinates in the bathtub. Not once. Repeatedly. I don’t know if that’s normal for some people, but to me it’s disgusting and completely beyond the line.

We’re now considering giving them notice. We’re the main tenants, they are subtenants, so we can give them a two-month notice period.

We’re just not sure if we’re overreacting. If we’re making a big deal out of nothing. And personally, I’m worried that if we ask them to leave, they might not have anywhere to go, since they couldn’t find housing for months before moving in with us.

1r01881,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1r01881/rant_i_just_want_to_enjoy_last_month_of_my/,Rant - I just want to enjoy last month of my pregnancy,"I (F26) have been on medical leave for most of my pregnancy. Until week 16 I was sick and vomiting, at week 18 I started to get bad SPS/PGP. So I was maybe working for 2 months during my pregnancy (from home). I am grateful that in my country we get paid medical leave, but I have been so miserable, because that means that you are not allowed to leave your home. And I've been pregnant since June. 

One month before estimated birth date maternity leave starts and you can roam around all you want. I start my maternity leave tomorrow. And I just want to enjoy it - go to the seaside, get coffee, go out for lunch with husband ... nothing crazy because I am still in pain, but you know, just go somewhere. But at some weird coincidence a lot of my family members have birthdays in February and of course want us to visit for the whole weekend(s) - and we have only four if the baby won't be early. I love my family a lot but at the same time I just want to do whatever I want before the baby comes. I know it sounds selfish, but it is the truth. 

We will probably compromise but at the same time I feel trapped - because I know that they will want to see the baby right away and will not respect our boundaries, so I have to adjust now and then. It is stressing me out. 

Maybe I have some sort of prenatal depression, because I have been home for so long. When I am thinking about everything I just want to cry. ",1,1770634591.0,pregnant,2,1.0,False

Keep in mind I suggested coffee or tea and she said sure. What exactly went wrong here? Is it because I didn’t play up her emotions a bit more? Exchanged more than just a few messages?,5,1770634572.0,dating_advice,8,0.86,False
1r017uk,https://www.reddit.com/r/EssayChaos/comments/1r017uk/unpopular_opinion_maybe_but_i_am_convinced_that/,Unpopular opinion maybe but I am convinced that study groups are actually a massive scam and everyone is just pretending to be productive to feel better,"I honestly dont know if I am just socially inept or if the rest of the world is playing some kind of elaborate prank on me regarding the concept of group studying. Every single semester I let myself get gaslit into thinking that booking a study room in the library with three friends is going to be the magic solution to my lack of motivation. I see all these people on campus looking aesthetic with their laptops open and their iced coffees and they look like they are solving complex physics problems together so I get this wave of fomo and think that I need that energy in my life. So yesterday I agreed to meet up with my project group for what was supposed to be a ""lock in"" session for our upcoming econ midterm which is worth a terrifying percentage of our grade. I packed my bag with literally every textbook I own and my noise cancelling headphones and snacks because I was ready to be an academic weapon. I walked in there with the mindset that we were going to grind for four hours straight and I was going to leave that room knowing everything about microeconomics.



The reality check hit me about eleven minutes after we sat down and it was painful. First of all nobody actually opened a book for the first twenty minutes because we had to discuss where everyone got their drinks and then talk about the drama from the weekend. I tried to be the annoying responsible one who steers the conversation back to supply and demand curves but I was immediately shut down because apparently I need to ""chill"" and we have plenty of time. Then one guy spent an hour loudly eating chips while scrolling through hinge and asking us to rate profiles which is fun normally but not when I am trying to figure out elasticity. Another girl just complained about her roommate for forty five minutes straight. I found myself reading the same sentence over and over again because I could not tune out the background noise of them gossiping. I didn't want to be rude and leave because then I look like a bad friend but staying there was actually making me dumber by the minute. By the time we left four hours later I had written down maybe three definitions and my anxiety was through the roof because now I have to go home and actually study alone at night when I am already exhausted. Is this just me being antisocial or is group studying literally just a socially acceptable way to procrastinate together because I feel like I just wasted half my day for the aesthetic of looking busy.",2,1770634552.0,EssayChaos,1,1.0,False
1r017dq,https://i.redd.it/anfvsupg9gig1.jpeg,Anaerobic beans tougher to grind?,"So I’m getting familiar with my K7 grinder from Kingrinder- recently I also got into coffee from Skylark.

I was truly shocked at how difficult these beans have been to grind - even on a coarser setting then what I typically use for other coffees from Skylark my grinder tends to stall. Because I’m also new to the grinder there’s no real way of me, knowing if it’s the beans or the grinder.

Does anyone else have experience with these beans?  Have you found them tricky to grind as well? If it helps, this was the 15th of January batch.

It’s also worth mentioning that because the grinder is new and was a big upgrade for me I’m slightly anxious about damaging it. I’m regularly checking for rocks and debris, but does anyone know if there’s a chance I could actually damage the grinder with a tougher bean? It seems unlikely and maybe I’m overthinking it but I figured I would ask.

So two days ago at like 3am I fell down a rabbit hole of those ""that girl"" study vlogs where everyone wakes up before the sun and drinks matcha and reads perfectly highlighted notes while soft jazz plays in the background. It looked so peaceful and productive and my brain decided right then and there that this was the solution to all my academic problems. I convinced myself that the reason Im falling behind in my sociology classes isnt because I have the attention span of a goldfish but because I wasnt waking up early enough. So I made a plan. I set my alarm for 5:00 am. I laid out my outfit which was just matching sweats but still. I even cleaned my desk so it would be ready for my transformation into an academic weapon. I went to sleep feeling like I had already fixed my entire life just by setting an alarm on my phone.



The alarm went off this morning and for the first five minutes I honestly thought there was a fire drill or an intruder because the sound was so offensive in the pitch black room. It was cold and dark and my bed was so warm but I forced myself up because I am disciplined now apparently. I stumbled to the kitchen to make coffee and ended up spilling half the grounds on the counter because my eyes were barely open. I sat at my desk at 5:20 am with my coffee and my textbook and just stared at the page. My brain was literal static. I read the same paragraph about social stratification six times and I still have zero idea what it said. It was just words floating on paper. I tried to take notes but my handwriting looked like a doctor signing a prescription during an earthquake. I sat there for an hour feeling miserable and cold and tired waiting for the productivity to kick in but instead I just got a headache. Around 6:30 I decided to just rest my eyes for ""five minutes"" on top of my textbook which was obviously the biggest lie I have ever told myself. I woke up at 10:30 with a page of the book stuck to my cheek and drool on my notes. Now I have missed my actual morning lecture and I feel more tired than if I had just slept normally. I feel like I got scammed by the internet aesthetics. Does anyone actually function like this or are we all just pretending to like waking up before the birds for clout because I am definitely not built for this lifestyle.",3,1770634409.0,StudyingPeople,1,1.0,False
1r015cw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r015cw,"Four Babies After I Divorced my CEO, link please?","Chapter 1

The cold check fluttered down onto the mirror-like marble floor.

 Like a discarded, withered leaf.

Beatrice Tucker, my former mother-in-law, glanced at me with a look reserved for trash.

Her voice was as mean as ever, dripping with undisguised contempt.

“Three hundred million. That’s all your womb was worth to us.”

 “Consider it the Tucker family doing right by you.”

 “Take the money and vanish. Don’t ever show your face again. The further, the better.”

 “Gracie has already given birth. There’s no place for you here anymore, so stop being an eyesore.”

I lowered my eyes, my gaze landing on that thin slip of paper on the ground.

Three hundred million.

So my marriage of these past few years—the heart and soul I poured into it—was worth just this price.

A price tag. One they used to throw me out.

The crystal chandelier in the living room cast a cold light, shining on the man beside me.

Rayford, my ex-husband, was bowing his head, focused intently on his phone.

His profile looked exceptionally cold under the light.

 I could even guess that on the other end of the screen was that secretary, Gracie Miller, holding her newborn son and fishing for praise.

He never once looked at me.

 Not even at the woman he was divorcing.

From the moment Beatrice started speaking until now, his gaze hadn’t lingered on me for a second.

As if I were just air.

 An object about to be disposed of.

The feelings we shared over those years, those vows of eternal love, had all become a joke.

In their eyes, a woman without a son was already a sinner.

My heart had long since turned to dead ash amidst countless days and nights of hope and disappointment.

Now, even the last bit of warmth remaining in that ash had been completely drained away.

I slowly bent down and picked up the check.

My fingertips touched the cold paper, feeling nothing real.

I straightened up, my gaze calmly falling on the divorce agreement they had prepared long ago.

The agreement lay on the coffee table, next to an expensive fountain pen.

They had prepared so thoroughly.

I didn't speak, didn't question, and certainly didn't cry or make a scene.

I simply walked over, picked up the pen, and signed my name on the last page.

Clarissa Banks.

The name was written with unusual steadiness.

After signing, I put the pen back, folded the three-hundred-million check, and put it in my pocket.

Then, I turned and walked toward the suitcase by the door, which the housekeeper had already packed.

Throughout the entire process, I didn't make a single unnecessary sound.

Quiet like a puppet finishing its last task.

It wasn't until I dragged the suitcase and opened the heavy main door that Rayford finally looked up.

His voice came from behind me, laced with impatient charity.

""Do you want the driver to give you a ride?""

I didn't look back.

""No need.""

My voice was soft, yet unusually clear.

""Mr. Tucker, I wish the three of you a lifetime of happiness.""

The door clicked shut behind me, cutting off the place I once called ""home.""

Outside, it had started raining without me noticing.

Icy rain, driven by the wind, lashed against my face.

Dragging my suitcase, I walked down the empty street.

The rain blurred my vision and washed away the last shreds of my ridiculous dignity.

The whole world seemed shrouded in this curtain of rain, so heavy I could barely breathe.

I was abandoned.

By my husband, by his family, by the love I thought I could entrust my life to.

A sharp cramp twisted in my stomach.

My knees buckled, and I pitched forward uncontrollably.

Before my consciousness faded into total darkness, I had only one thought.

Maybe dying would be easier than being thrown away like this.

I woke up in a blinding whiteness.

The sharp scent of antiseptic filled my nose.

A female doctor in a white coat stood by the bed, studying a report in her hand.

Seeing I was awake, she spoke, her expression complex.

""Ms. Banks, you're awake.""

""You have low blood sugar, and combined with extreme emotional stress, that's why you fainted.""

I braced myself against the edge of the bed to sit up, but a dull throb in my stomach stopped me.

The doctor quickly steadied me.

""Don't move around. You're not just taking care of yourself anymore.""

I froze.

""What do you mean?""

The doctor adjusted her glasses and handed me a medical report.

""You’re pregnant. Eight weeks. And it’s not just one.""

My mind went blank.

Pregnant?

Just when I had given up all hope and was ready to leave for good?

My hands trembled as I took the report, staring at the data I couldn't understand and the final, undeniable conclusion.

Seeing how dazed I was, the doctor sighed and added something even more shocking.

""Also, the ultrasound shows quadruplets.""

""Your health is fragile, and as an older first-time mother, carrying four fetuses is extremely risky.""

""I strongly advise you to consider reducing the number of babies.""

Quadruplets.

My hand instinctively drifted to my still-flat stomach.

Inside, there were four little lives.

My babies.

I thought of Beatrice's cruel face and her almost obsessive desire for a grandson.

I thought of the coldness Rayford had shown me for the sake of that so-called ""son.""

What they dreamed of having—I had four of them right here.

But what did this have to do with them?

These were my babies.

They were the only bond heaven had granted me after the whole world had cast me aside.

A strength I had never felt before surged from the depths of my heart, dispelling all the despair and dead silence.

I looked up, my gaze steady on the doctor.

""I won't do the reduction.""

“I’ll keep them all. Every single one. No matter the cost.”

""I'm going to give birth to all of them.""

The doctor looked at me in surprise, seemingly unprepared for my resolve.

I didn't explain further.

I ripped the IV from my hand and, ignoring the doctor's protests, checked myself out of the hospital.

The moment I walked out of the hospital, the first thing I did was go to the bank and cash that check.

The second thing was finding a top-tier agency to fast-track my immigration.

To go to a place where no one knew who I was.

To a place where my children and I could start over.

Rayford, Beatrice, and everything about the Tucker family would all become part of the past.

And I, Clarissa, would forge a brand-new future for my children.

It was dusk when the plane touched down.

Unfamiliar languages wove together in my ears, a buzz of unintelligible noise.

Chapter 2

The plane landed at dusk.

Dragging my suitcase, I stood at the airport exit and looked at this completely foreign city.

A wave of loneliness hit me all at once.

No one here knew who I was.

I used part of the money to buy a small house with a garden in a quiet neighborhood.

It wasn’t big, but it was warm.

Warm enough to be a home for me and the four children growing inside me.

I set up the nursery myself.

Four small cribs stood side by side.

I stood there for a long time, touching the edge of one crib.

I can do this, I told myself.

But reality answered me very quickly.

At the grocery store, my belly was already obvious.

As I pushed the cart down the aisle, I felt eyes on me.

Two women whispered near the vegetables.

“Is she alone?”

“No ring.”

“That belly… she must be unmarried.”

“So shameless.”

“Kids these days have no morals.”

I pretended not to hear them and kept walking.

At the cashier, the young girl glanced at my stomach, then at my empty hand.

“No husband?” she asked casually.

I smiled. “Just me.”

Her smile stiffened for a second. “Oh.”

That was all she said. But it was enough.

The hospital was worse.

In the waiting area, a woman sat beside her husband. He held her hand, rubbing her back gently. She looked at me, then at my belly.

“So big already?” she said.

“How many months?”

“Five,” I answered.

She frowned. “And the father?”

“I came alone.”

Her husband coughed awkwardly. She leaned closer and lowered her voice— not low enough.

“These girls nowadays…”

“Getting pregnant before marriage.”

“No shame at all.”

I stared straight ahead at the screen calling patient numbers.

Once, while walking down the hospital stairs, my vision suddenly went black.

A nurse caught me just in time.

“Low blood sugar,” she said impatiently.

“You pregnant women really should be more careful.”

She looked around.

“Your family didn’t come with you?”

“No,” I said.

She sighed.

“You should at least bring someone next time.”

I nodded.

As my belly grew bigger, even daily movement became hard. One afternoon at the grocery store, I tried to reach a pack of noodles placed too high.

I stood on my tiptoes.

“Hey!” someone snapped behind me.

“Careful! Are you pregnant or not?”

Another voice chimed in.

“If you’re pregnant, why are you alone?”

“Did the man run away?”

“Tsk.”

I lost my balance and grabbed the shelf.

My heart raced. I put the noodles back and walked out with nothing.

That night, back in the quiet house, I sat on the floor.

Four cribs.I hugged my knees and cried without making a sound.

After a long time, I wiped my face and stood up.

“I’m still here,” I whispered.

“And I’m not stopping.”

When the due date came earlier than expected, I drove myself to the hospital in the middle of the night.

The pain was unbearable.

Giving birth to quadruplets was a fight with death.

As I was pushed into the operating room, staring at the bright surgical lights, I had only one thought:

Please let my babies live.

I don’t remember how long the surgery lasted.

When I woke up, it was already the next afternoon.

My voice was hoarse when I asked the nurse the only thing that mattered.

“My children… Are they okay?”

“They’re all safe,” she said.

“Three boys and one girl. They’re in incubators, but they’re healthy.”

I cried quietly, with tears soaking into the pillow.

The nurse later brought me to see them.

They were so small. Wrinkled. Fragile. Like four tiny kittens. But to me, they were the most beautiful sight in the world.

These were my children.

After leaving the hospital, I hired professional baby nurses and childcare helpers.

Even so, raising four newborns alone was still chaos. Feeding. Diapers. Sleepless nights.

My days were broken into endless pieces.

There were nights I didn’t sleep at all. My body hurts. My mind felt close to breaking.

But every time I looked at their tiny faces, I told myself: This is my life now. And I will survive it.

The children grew quickly.

Liam Tucker was calm and quiet, like a little adult.

Noah Tucker was wild and energetic, always causing trouble.

Ethan Tucker smiled all the time, his eyes curved like moons.

And my daughter, Mia Tucker, was soft and sweet—the heart of the family.

I gave them all the last name Tucker.

Only to remind myself where this all began.

I would never forget the pain.

While raising my children, I didn’t give up on myself.

I had studied design in college, and later learned finance during my marriage. Those skills, once buried, slowly came back to life.

I opened a small online design shop. I handled everything myself—design, pricing, customer service, operations. I poured my love, my anger, and my hope into my work.

Little by little, the business grew. One year has passed.

The children could call me “Mama.”

My shop became a real studio.

When I looked in the mirror, I no longer saw the abandoned woman from the past.

And this—

This was only the beginning of my new life.

I would start my own revenge now.

Chapter 3

The Tucker family was holding an incredibly lavish first birthday banquet for their only grandson.

The banquet hall was packed with rich guests and famous faces, glasses clinking in celebration.

Beatrice held William, who was dressed in a tiny suit, grinning from ear to ear.

She showed off her precious grandson to every guest who came to offer their congratulations.

""Look at our William, isn't he growing up beautifully? Those eyes and brows look just like Rayford did when he was little.""

Rayford stood to the side with a glass of wine in hand, making small talk with the guests.

He watched the child surrounded by the crowd, but something felt wrong.

He didn't look like him.

This child didn't look a thing like him.

He’d had this thought more than once, but every time, it was forcefully suppressed by his mother, Beatrice.

""The baby is still small. What's wrong with him looking like his mom?""

""Gracie is young and beautiful. If William takes after her, he'll definitely be a handsome young man!""

""Stop imagining things. You finally got a son. Learn to be grateful.""

Beatrice absolutely doted on this grandson, treating him like fragile porcelain she was terrified to break.

Gracie had secured her position through her son. Her status in the Tucker family had skyrocketed and was now unshakable.

Rayford looked at Gracie beside him, smiling radiantly as she held the child, her face glowing with happiness as she accepted everyone's blessings.

He should feel satisfied.

He had a career, a beautiful partner, and an heir.

Wasn't this the perfect life he had always pursued?

Yet, why was it that in the dead of night, he would uncontrollably think of another face?

That fresh, gentle face that always wore a faint smile.

Clarissa.

The ex-wife he had personally cast aside.

Where was she now?

How was she doing?

The thought flashed by for only a second before he forcibly pushed the thought away.

A woman who couldn’t even give him a son wasn’t worth a second thought.

After the first birthday banquet ended, Gracie snuggled into his arms, urging him in a sweet voice.

""Rayford, William is already a year old. When are we going to have our wedding?""

""I want to be your wife in public. Not just the woman who gave birth.""

Rayford looked at her expectant face, was silent for a moment, and then nodded.

""Alright, I'll arrange it.""

It would be good for the company's image and good for the company and the family business.

That was what he told himself.

The wedding preparations were the height of luxury.

Gracie wanted a wedding of the century that the whole world would notice, and Rayford granted her wish.

He wanted to use this grand ceremony to declare to everyone that Gracie was the only mistress acknowledged by the Tucker family.

He wanted this wedding to erase Clarissa from his life completely.

While trying on wedding dresses, Rayford looked at Gracie in the mirror wearing a pure white gown and felt for a brief moment, he froze.

It was as if he saw Clarissa from many years ago, the first time she had put on a wedding dress for him.

Back then, her eyes were filled with shy love and hope for the future.

His heart stung for no apparent reason.

Beatrice noticed his distraction and walked over with a cold face to warn him.

""Rayford, let me remind you.""

""Stop thinking about that useless woman who couldn’t give you a son!""

""Gracie and William are your present and your future.""

""If you dare mess this up, don't blame me for disowning you!""

Rayford pulled back his thoughts, the ripple in his eyes quickly covered by cold rationality.

Mother was right.

The past should stay buried.

Rayford Tucker would never know the things that have changed dramatically in years.

1r013ez,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenAscending/comments/1r013ez/how_to_hack_your_hormones_and_actually_lose/,How to Hack Your Hormones and Actually Lose Weight: The REAL Science Behind It,"So I've been diving deep into hormone research for months now. books, podcasts, scientific papers, the whole deal. And honestly? Most advice about weight loss is trash. We're told to ""just eat less and move more"" like our bodies are simple calculators. They're not.

Here's what blew my mind: your hormones are literally running the show. And most of us are walking around with completely dysregulated hormone systems without even knowing it. No wonder we can't lose weight. No wonder we're exhausted. The system is rigged against us, our modern lifestyle is actively fighting our biology. But here's the good news, once you understand how this works, you can actually do something about it.

I'm sharing what actually worked based on legit science, not instagram BS.

The cortisol trap nobody talks about

Most people don't realize they're stuck in chronic stress mode. Your cortisol stays elevated all day from work stress, lack of sleep, too much coffee, doom scrolling. When cortisol is high, your body literally cannot burn fat properly. It holds onto every calorie like you're about to face a famine.

Dr. Robert Lustig's research at UCSF shows how cortisol directly blocks your fat burning hormones. His work on metabolic syndrome is insane. The book [""Metabolic: The Luring and Hype of Processed Food, Nutrition, and Modern Medicine""](https://www.amazon.com/Metabolical-Processed-Nutrition-Modern-Medicine/dp/0063027712) breaks down exactly how our modern environment sabotages our hormones. This won won multiple awards and Lustig is one of the leading endocrinologists in the world. Reading this made me realize how little control we actually have when our hormones are messed up. Best metabolism book I've ever read, hands down.

Quick cortisol hacks that actually work:  
Do nothing for 10 mins daily. Seriously. No phone, no stimulation. Your nervous system needs to downregulate.  
Stop drinking coffee after 12pm. It keeps cortisol elevated way longer than you think.  
Get sunlight within 30 mins of waking. This sets your cortisol rhythm properly for the entire day.

The insulin resistance spiral

Most people are insulin resistant and don't know it. When you eat carbs constantly throughout the day, your insulin stays elevated. High insulin = fat storage mode permanently turned on. You literally cannot access your fat stores when insulin is high.

Dr. Jason Fung's work on this is incredible. [""The Obesity Code: Unlocking the Secrets of Weight Loss""](https://www.amazon.com/Obesity-Code-Unlocking-Secrets-Weight/dp/1771641258) explains why calorie counting doesn't work when your hormones are broken. This book has sold over a million copies and Fung is a nephrologist who's treated thousands of patients. The insulin explanation finally made everything click for me. This book will make you question everything you think you know about dieting.

What actually helps:  
Time restricted eating. Stop eating 3 hours before bed, don't eat for 12-14 hours overnight. This gives insulin a chance to drop.  
Eat protein and fat first at meals. Slows down the insulin spike dramatically.  
Walk after meals. Even 10 mins. Muscles soak up glucose without needing as much insulin.

The app Zero is great for tracking your eating window. It's simple, shows you exactly when to stop eating, helps you build the habit without overthinking it.

The sleep hormone connection everyone ignores

Poor sleep destroys leptin (your satiety hormone) and increases ghrelin (your hunger hormone). One night of bad sleep can make you 30% more hungry the next day. Your willpower isn't the problem, your biology is.

Matthew Walker's ""Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams"" is genuinely life changing. Walker is a UC Berkeley neuroscience professor and this became an instant bestseller for a reason. The section on how sleep affects weight and hormones is terrifying. Best sleep book out there, period. After reading this I completely changed how I think about sleep.

Sleep protocol that works:  
Keep your room cold. Like 65-68°F cold. Your body temp needs to drop to sleep deeply.  
No screens 1 hour before bed. The blue light destroys melatonin production even with blue light filters.  
Magnesium glycinate before bed. Game changer for sleep quality. 200-400mg.

The app Insight Timer has great sleep meditations and yoga nidra sessions that actually help you fall asleep. I use it almost every night now. Way better than just laying there with racing thoughts.

For anyone wanting to go deeper without spending hours reading all these books, [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) is an AI-powered learning app that pulls from high-quality sources like the books mentioned above, plus research papers and expert interviews on metabolism and hormones. You type in a goal like ""fix my hormones to lose weight naturally"" and it generates personalized audio learning and an adaptive plan based on your unique situation.

You can customize the depth, from a quick 10-minute overview to a 40-minute deep dive with examples and research details. The voice options are surprisingly addictive too, there's even a smoky, calming voice that's perfect for learning before bed. Built by Columbia grads and Google AI experts, so the content is fact-checked and science-based. It connects all these hormone insights into one structured plan instead of jumping between books and podcasts randomly.

Thyroid dysfunction is way more common than you think

Your thyroid controls your metabolic rate. If it's sluggish, you're fighting an uphill battle. Most doctors only test TSH which misses so many thyroid issues. You need full thyroid panel including T3, T4, reverse T3, antibodies.

Research shows that chronic dieting and stress tank your thyroid function. Your body thinks you're starving and slows everything down to conserve energy.

Things that support thyroid:  
Adequate protein. At least 0.8g per pound of body weight. Thyroid hormones are made from amino acids.  
Selenium and zinc. Brazil nuts and oysters or supplement if needed.  
Stop overexercising. Too much cardio tanks thyroid hormones in many people.

The strength training hormone boost

Lifting heavy things is the best hormone hack that exists. It increases testosterone and growth hormone naturally in both men and women. These are your fat burning, muscle building hormones.

Cardio can actually increase cortisol if you do too much. But resistance training has the opposite effect, it improves insulin sensitivity and helps regulate cortisol.

You don't need to spend hours in the gym. 3x per week, 30-45 mins, focusing on compound movements. That's it.

The reality is our modern environment is working against our biology constantly. Artificial light, processed food, chronic stress, lack of movement. It's not just about willpower. Once I understood the hormone piece, everything else fell into place. You're not broken, your hormones just need support.",1,1770634109.0,MenAscending,0,1.0,False

1r012ey,https://i.redd.it/9jy11s4o7gig1.png,Batao guys what & how to do? (Obviously Relationship Advice),"This is my first post on Reddit. I was just scrolling randomly and found this community interesting, so I thought yeah… this might be a good place to get some clarity.

I’m 20M, currently in my final year of graduation, studying in what I’d honestly call a *tier-5 college* 💀  
Like, super small campus, 8 rooms each on 3 floors, 4 courses. It literally feels like school. We have uniforms, and if you don’t attend lectures, you get scolded. Full trauma.

So, pata hai aaj kya hua, I help in my family business (a store), and every evening there used to be this girl who passed in front of the shop. She used to ride her Activa, dropping her younger brother for tuition, I guess. I’d see her almost daily, and in my head I was like *bhai please koi toh connection ho,* same school, same college, kuch bhi, so that I could maybe talk to her someday.

And then… plot twist happened.  
About 6 months later, during my sem 5 pre-tests, I saw her sitting **in my class itself**, writing a test but for **sem 1**, same course as mine. I was SHOOK. Matlab legit *what are the odds?*

From that day on, I (not proudly) started collecting info about her. I got to know her name, her IG, where she lives (which is literally near my house 😊), etc etc. In between all this, I was busy with competitive exams and stuff, so I kept postponing the idea of proposing or talking to her.

But now that I’m regular in sem 6, the urge to confess is hitting hard. She seems really innocent and so am I, honestly 😭  
I’ve barely talked to girls unless kaam ho. Otherwise I’m like *mujhe kya lena dena*. In college, I’m known as that quiet, serious, suspense-type guy who just sits in the library for hours, reading books. I also do a part-time job, so I genuinely don’t have time to waste or hang around much.

Right now, I’m completely confused about **how to approach her**.  
How do I even start a conversation?  
What do I say in the first meet?  
How do I ask her out for coffee… in the *first go*?

Also I got a chance to show myself off to her in a pro way, on our college's placement day, where some local companies come to offer some mediocre jobs. I had one and a family business too, but i had a very strong CV. The college assigns students of 1st year to sit outside the classes as interview rooms, and to send a student as turn goes, so when i reached clg, for giving my interview outside the company where her duty was to sit, so that i can show her my qfs, and just get a way to talk to her.   
And she got ABSENT on that day...😢😢

I keep postponing everything, thinking about “best chances of acceptance” and overthinking like crazy. Also, a friend told me she sometimes comes to college by car (she’s 18), though she lives barely 1 km away same area as me. I usually come on my bike, she’s mostly on her Activa.

So yeah… I’m puzzled af.

Reddit bhaiyo, please help.  
How do I talk to her without making it awkward or creepy?  
What’s a normal, non-cringe first line?  
And is asking for coffee directly a bad idea?
