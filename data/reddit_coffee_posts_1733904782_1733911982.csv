1hbqbiz,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1hbqbiz/cant_choose/,Can’t choose!,"Hi everyone :)

I’m moving out for the first time and I’m going to live with my boyfriend (very excited!). He doesn’t really like coffee, so I get to choose the machine and make my own little coffee bar.

However, I’m stuck in the choosing process. A friend of mine has a barely used vertuo next which I can take over for only 50 euros (they have like 4 coffee machines and are going to live smaller), but I can’t choose whether I want that machine, or one from the OL.

I’ve tasted the vertuo cups in store and I thought they were great, however, I can see myself forgetting to get new cups and having no coffee for a few days.

I had the OL in my airbnb on vacation, and I really liked those cups as well! I enjoyed the Starbucks cups as well.

What to know:
- I like iced coffees and special coffees
- I like espressos
- I want to be able to make cappuccinos for my guests
- I like to experiment

TLDR; can’t choose between vertuo next and a machine from the OL :)",1,1733911776.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False

*“In this universe, approximately twenty years ago, a series of towns in Northern Pennsylvania were wiped out by a demonic entity that’s now chained in one of those towns. Somehow, this created a series of events that also led to the exact same production of ‘Fifty Shades of Grey’ as we know it today.” -Isaiah “Mr. Goon” Markin*



Important Canon Events

* 2002 - Metaraxes is unleashed
* 2002-2015 - 20% of Pennsylvania is unpersoned

	Required Events/People

* *George W. Bush (CT) - He did it*

* *9/11*

The 9/11 Terror Attacks predate the release of Metaraxes in ‘02 and influenced Gerard Way.

* *Gerard Way (NJ) - MCR Vocalist*

* *Way bears witness to the terror attacks on September 11th*
* *MCR members exist*
* *MCR obtains a record label*
* *MCR sees mainstream success*

Way’s experience on September 11th, 2001 inspired him to start a band shortly after. They signed with EYEBALL RECORDS (NJ) in ‘02. On August 31st, 2003 they signed with REPRISE RECORDS (CA) and saw mainstream success with the release of “Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge.” My Chemical Romance, en tandem with a dream, inspired Stephenie Meyer to write “Twilight” on June 2, 2003.

* *Stephenie Meyer (CT) - “Twilight” Author*

* *“Twilight” novelized* 
* *“Twilight” cinematized*

Meyer’s dream and musical palate inspired her to begin writing “Twilight,” which she finished three months later. The manuscript was sent to 15 literary agencies, of which only one responded positively. Despite the apparent poor quality of her story, Meyer signs with LITTLE, BROWN AND COMPANY (MA), and the book was published in ‘05. SUMMIT ENTERTAINMENT (CA) bought the rights to “Twilight” in ‘07, and the film was released in ‘08. Its opening weekend gross broke the record for the highest ever, for a film directed by a woman; this ensured the continuation of the series. E. L. James saw “Twilight” in theatres, for which she would later write fan fiction. 

* *E. L. James (UK) - “Fifty Shades of Grey” Author*

* *James watches “Twilight” in theatres*
* *“Fifty Shades of Grey” novelized*
* *“Fifty Shades of Grey” cinematized*

James’ consumption of and affection for the “Twilight” films prompted her to author a story of her own in January of 2009 which, initially, used the same characters. “Master of the Universe” was posted in multiple parts on several fan-fiction sites, however, James would remove these posts after receiving criticism over the material’s raunchiness, opting to post it instead to her personal website. After its migration, “Master of the Universe” was rewritten by James so as to break away from the source material. This rewrite included the renaming of the main characters and removal from her website pending publication. “Fifty Shades of Grey” was published and released in three parts by THE WRITERS’ COFFEE SHOP (AUS) from mid-2011 to early 2012; although the publisher was not well-financed enough to advertise the series, word-of-mouth, and sizable media attention offset the deficit tenfold. In April of 2012, VINTAGE BOOKS (UK/NY) re-released the trilogy due to its popularity. UNIVERSAL PICTURES (CA) and FOCUS FEATURES (CA) procured the rights to “Fifty Shades of Grey” in March of 2012 and released the film adaptation on February 13th, 2015.



	Organizations mentioned (text in all caps) should exist within the universe; they are not based in Pennsylvania,  their founders died before the release of Metaraxes, or did not reside in Pennsylvania between 2002 and 2015. Individuals mentioned should exist within the universe; they did not reside in Pennsylvania between 2002 and 2015. Events mentioned should occur within the universe; they predate the release of Metaraxes or did not take place in Pennsylvania. This being said, there are no absolutes, Metaraxes could have wandered into any one of the nearby states where an important event took place, or an important person resided. It is also possible that someone important was unpersoned after their contribution to the chain of events, in which case I presume their influence would be undone and any material created by subsequent links would be erased.

I'm getting my parents some gifts for helping me out during a REALLY tough period of my life— helping me pack up and move, downsize, deal with surgery + other health issues, and a stressful work period all at once. They're in their mid-to-late 70s and I feel terrible that they flew out to help me when they should be enjoying life at this stage, and I really owe it to them even though they say it's nbd.

I have an idea of what I want to get my mom, but it's my dad I'm really struggling with. When he wants something, he usually just goes out and gets it. He's down to watch TV and chill most of the day otherwise. They've been talking about downsizing for years, so I'm trying to be careful not to get anything that will just add to clutter. None of the online guides saying ""buy him a beard-scented leather flask to hold his favorite knife-flavored whiskey"" apply to this man.

Some ideas I had...

* Some nice fragrances: he liked a few samples I had of ones he'd never purchase on his own. I'd want to get this along with something else though.
* Airpod Pros: He just got into Apple stuff and had been using some older airpods fairly often. However, this is a recent occurrence and it may have been just because he was traveling. One thought was to get this along with the fragrances.
* Superautomatic coffee machine: he drinks instant coffee every morning, so this could be a nice upgrade. However, he's not big on espresso or cappuccino or anything fancy, and it would likely have to be something that's REALLY easy to clean up/maintain. Also, my mom is sensitive to caffeine, so only my dad would drink this (and it might be annoying for the kitchen to smell like coffee from now on). Lastly, I'm staying with them for the next few months, so it might lowkey look like a gift to myself (even though I'd leave it here when I'm gone).
* Lounge chair (family room) replacement: The one he has is pretty old at this point, but these things are so personal that it's a roll of the dice to know if the replacement is worthy.
* TV replacement: I think the large-screen one they have now is UHD. I could get them on OLED, which is a little higher than the requested price range, but there are some good deals right now and I'd be open to it. I think they JUST got the UHD last year though, so it's a little gratuitous (although the old one could be moved to another room)— also, I think my mom would like both of them to be a little more active and this nudges them away from that lol.
* Adjustable bed frame: This would be pricey (they are looking at a split king), so it would be a gift to both of my parents. The problem is figuring out which mattress to put on top, which is highly personal. It has potential though, since they were already looking around for this a little bit.

  
I think this post is long enough! I appreciate any thoughtful suggestions anyone can think of for something like this.

1hbqab0,https://www.reddit.com/r/hyatt/comments/1hbqab0/my_review_of_alila_seminyak_from_late_november/,My Review of Alila Seminyak from late November,"Here's a review from the last week of November at the Alila Seminyak.  This was our first time staying at the Alila Seminyak, though we’ve eaten dinner at Seasalt before.   I’ll try to give you my best impressions to help with the various Hyatt (and other) options in Bali.  I’m travelling as a Globalist.  



Arrival and check-in

We arrived about 7:30pm in the international terminal.  I highly suggest you use the [Official e-Visa Website for Indonesia](https://evisa.imigrasi.go.id/). After years of standing in line to pay for the VOA, and then standing in another immigration line, this is a real life saver.  Particularly if you only have carry-on luggage.  You can easily be out of the airport in under 10 minutes if you do so.  I have a regular driver that I use to arrange airport transfers, but the GoJek app is your next best bet.  Time from the airport to the Alila was about 30 minutes - traffic was pretty light.  I would budget 45.



The lobby is really big and open space, completely open and breezy, with a view out over the pools and ocean.  We checked in a bit after 8pm without any delay at the front desk.  I had originally booked a King Deluxe via combination of a free night certificate for 1 night and 2 nights via points + cash.  At check-in we were upgraded to a Terrace Suite, which is located on the ground floor.  



Room

We were about 3 rooms from the lobby, which I prefer.  This meant a short walk through the lobby and downstairs to the Seasalt restaurant where the breakfast is, as well as to the main pool.  Immediately to the left of the room was an entrance to the adult/quiet pool -  as well we could walk directly out of the room via sliding doors and across the grass to it.  That was very convenient. 



The room is not really a suite by a traditional definition.  There is a sitting area with a loveseat, oversize chair and coffee table.  There’s no separation from the bedroom area.  It would be hard to even call this a “junior suite” of sorts.  It’s really just a large room.  The bathroom had a very large rain shower and bathtub.  The Terrace Suite has a nice ground floor terrace with a couple of loungers and a bench seat.  Contrary to the Hyatt Regency in Sanur, there were no bugs and insects in the evening and so it was comfortable to hang out there and watch the last of the sunset.  I attribute the Seminyak side of the island vs. Sanur.  It’s much more windy.



Breakfast

Breakfast is served in the Seasalt restaurant.  There’s an indoor and outdoor section.  Indoor has airconditioning but is open to the outside.  Outdoor is on a terrace overlooking the beach.  It’s a really pleasant space where you can order entrees from the ala carte menu and there is a buffet.  Juices are off to the side and self serve.  I found the breakfast pretty high quality and rather extensive.  Over three days we didn’t repeat anything.  Coffee is quite slow because they are all done on espresso machines.  It can take over 10 minutes for your coffee to be delivered to your table.  I got in the habit of ordering two at a time.



Pool and Beach

There are three pools.  An adult only quiet pool, a family pool and the “main” pool.  The quiet pool and family pool are elevated and separate from the main pool.  We spent probably ¾ of our time at the main pool just to be closer to the beach and for a little more action.  The rest of the time we spent at the quiet pool, especially if it was for a quick stop before going out as it was right outside of our room terrace.  

The vibe of the Alila is very different to the Hyatt Regency Sanur or the Grand Hyatt.  The Alila has loungey music with much more of a beach club vibe as opposed to Gamelan.  It isn’t as rowdy as Potato Head next door but it definitely fits with the stretch of W and the club.  There are live bands and DJ’s Thu-Sun and it attracts a lot of non-property guests.  I’ve been there as a guest before when it was much more crowded that it was in late November - we had no trouble getting lounge chairs etc.  The main pool is a great spot to have cocktails and watch the sunset.  On our last day there, there was a collab with the Park Hyatt Jakarta featuring some specialty cocktails from there.  



There aren’t any beach chairs set up in front of the Alila - it is just a few steps down from the main pool  The waves are pretty rough and I wouldn’t recommend young kids swimming there.  If you have young ones, HR Sanur or GH Nusa Dua are much more family friendly in terms of beach and pool and kids club activities.  (There are some activities suitable for young kids at Alila, but you just don’t see the same number of kids around.)  This was just a couple’s trip, and I wouldn’t come back with my kids - I’d always go to one of the other Hyatts instead.



It’s pleasant to walk along the beach in either direction - pretty clean, with big waves crashing.  



Location

We primarily stayed in the Seminyak area, either walked to the main shopping drags and restaurants or used GoJek’s.  Traffic can back up the two lane roads at peak hours so plan accordingly.  GoJek and Google do a pretty good job of estimating traffic.  Except for breakfast, we ate all of our meals off property.  I’ve done dinner at Seasalt before - excellent nighttime location at the beach but didn’t feel like repeating it during this trip.  



Checkout

I have to relate an incredible late checkout experience.  I requested a 4pm checkout when arriving and was told to check back the next day.  When I did, they said they could guarantee 2pm but nothing later.  I did end up calling and realizing that this Alila is a resort and thus 4pm not guaranteed for Globalist.  However, they said they could arrange a shower room for us in order to enjoy the property until we needed to leave for our 9:30 pm flight.  I was expecting a family shower or locker room situation but we showed up to the front desk at 5pm after leaving our bags at 2pm and enjoying the pool, and were escorted to a full King room.  It was fully made up with all the towels and toiletries.  We spent a good hour taking a proper shower and getting ready for the plane and doing some last minute rearranging.  



If this is the globalist checkout benefit - this is incredible.  Basically able to enjoy the resort well past 4pm and take a truly proper shower.  I was seriously impressed - it was quite a perk.  



Wrap

All in all this is a pretty solid beachside resort.  I love being on this side of the island for sunsets - just incredible.  As mentioned it has more of a beach club vibe, as opposed to traditional resorts (incl HR Sanur and GH Nusa Dua) that have more “Bali Culture”.  You won’t find any gamelan there.  Again I find this hotel great for couples, less so for families with young kids.  There are some and it’s not a problem, just not somewhere I would bring mine.  Lazing by the quiet pool, people watching and taking in the sunset with cocktails at the main pool, and exploring cafes and restaurants in Seminyak are perfect, though.

We've been apart for 3 now. I last saw her 2 years ago. I still think about her everyday. I've lived a lot of life since and still have never found anything like this love. 
---

Hey. I really hope the above doesn't disturb your peace. I've been in therapy for the last two years and been debating telling you this for a while, still not sure if I should but life is too short to leave things unsaid. I feel like I never thanked you enough for the things that you did for me. I also feel like I deeply wronged you and never gave you closure. I hope in some small way this closes whatever gap I left. If you're in a relationship or otherwise just don't feel like to need to hear any further from me, go ahead and delete all of this before reading it. I don't expect to hear back, and even if I do, I'm not sure what I would say.

So we've been apart much longer than we were ever together, and yet I still feel compelled to tell you this. It was my fault for convincing you to be in a relationship with me. I remember when I picked you up from your apartment in the January reconnected and went to go do donuts in that parking lot, at the end of the night I made you talk through your feelings for me. I did that because I knew I wanted to be in a relationship with you and wanted to know where you stood. But I also did that because I was deeply insecure about you and I, and needed to hear how you felt. You said were worried I'd move to the other side of the country in a few months and there'd be no point, but I insisted we chase our feelings. What I didn't know was that my insecurities would come back to haunt me, and I should've known better. I should've worked on them or made a decision to not be with you in an effort to not hurt you. It's why I hated being apart from you for even a week. Part of it was because I felt such a strong bond with you, being away from you felt like I couldn't breath. And another part of is was definitely the insecurities I had creeping back in. I feel responsible for the entire state and trajectory of our relationship, which ultimately failed. So it's my fault and I should've made better decisions to avoid hurting you. Even when I took you to Montreal, I just wanted to treat you like I always did and never thought through how it might otherwise impact your feelings.

I insisted on pushing through and making things work because ultimately despite all of the volatility things felt right with you. You were a perfect partner in so many ways and I liked watching you grow. There was a comfort I found in taking care of you and sleeping next to you. Even when things were volatile I deeply valued and appreciated your apologies. You were a good person with a pure heart, which is why I wanted to spend every moment with you. You also gave me stability and comfort while I started my career and was finishing school at the same time. I can't remember if I ever told you, but I went no contact with my parents for 4 months when I moved into that first apartment to be closer to you. It was a difficult time for me. I never thanked you for just being there for me, so thank you. I've since gone no contact for up to 14 months with them because of our differences - I know you always disliked they didn't know about you, but I just want you to know it was never anything personal. When I think back to all of my lived experiences, those two years and especially those four months where I slept next to you every night were the longest and most memorable two years of my life. Every little thing you did for me, I valued and held close to my heart. The letters and little notes, your painting, your gifts, convincing me to floss my teeth, being next to me all of those times I had strep and covid in college and that small town, the fine dining you treated me to, the impromptu cooking dates. All of it really mattered. 

All of is this is to say, you did nothing wrong. The last time I cried was almost two years ago now, and I guess now as I write this, when you came to say goodbye and I gave you those socks you left behind in that small town we lived in for six months. There was something about us that always made me feel like you were a part of my being and purpose, and at that moment I felt the puzzle being complete again while realizing it was only going to be for one moment longer. I also realized how far apart we'd grown and different we'd become, and that I held responsibility in that happening. And because of that, I'm not asking you for anything. I realize we're different and potentially incompatible people now. We were just babies when we met. You were 20, I was 22 when we went to that bar talking about you falling in a field of sunflowers and sampling nachos at restaurants. I'm almost 30 now. Maybe one day if our paths ever cross down the road it would be fun to grab a coffee to see where our lives have taken us. Or maybe it would just as best to leave it all to rest. I hope you're doing well wherever you are and pursuing your dreams, you have a genuinely good heart and you'll do well with whatever you end up pursuing in life.",1,1733911471.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False
1hbq8cm,https://www.reddit.com/r/roommateproblems/comments/1hbq8cm/roommate_treating_living_room_like_bedroom/,Roommate treating living room like bedroom,"I had a new roommate move in a couple months ago and so far she's been really sweet as a person. She moved in with my other roommate in a double room, and I'm in a single. 

She mentioned when she moved in that her previous roommate made her feel uncomfortable using the common spaces, which obviously at the time I thought was sad and saw how excited she was to use the living room without feeling like that. But it's gotten to the point where she treats the living room like her bedroom. She sleeps on the couch practically every night, and stays out there watching TV whenever she's home in her pajamas. She literally puts on lotion on the couch which actually grosses me out 😭. Even when she's not there all her stuff is all over the couch and coffee table. 

Obviously I'm fine with her using the living room because it's a shared space,  but now I'm starting to feel uncomfortable being in there because I feel like I'm intruding on HER space. For example, I have to get up pretty early for work/classes and we have an entirely different schedule. I'm also usually up pretty late. My room is right by the living room, and she wakes up with literally any movement so I feel like I can't even get ready for work or school without being incredibly quiet. I have a single room specifically for the reason that my schedule is fucked and I like my privacy, but the walls are thin and you can basically hear everything if you're sitting in the living room.
Another issue is that I need to let my kittens out of my room so they can roam around, but she leaves all her shit out INCLUDING FOOD, and my cats get into her things because she isn't putting them away. 

Basically I'm just looking for advice on how to approach this, especially because she was apparently given so much trouble about using common areas at her last apartment and I think I'm starting to see why 😭 I don't want to cause tension because I don't move out until summer but I want to be able to start using the living room without feeling like I'm walking into someone's bedroom.",1,1733911384.0,roommateproblems,0,1.0,False

How do you overcome this?

I have a good partner, we married in our mid 30s and he is a great father to our children. He wasn't someone I fell head over heels for but I do love him, we generally enjoy each other's company while also doing things on our own. Our family was/is perfect.

I work on a small team at work and recently became more friendly with one of the male coworkers. We have been working on the same team for 3 years but didn't talk much; and to be honest I never even really noticed him, and he wasn't my ""type"". We started texting more due to a recent work event and mutual interests. We met up outside of work a couple of times and had a great time just chatting over coffee. Next thing you know, we both admitted that we have feelings for each other and it's too strong and it's not the right thing to do as we are both committed in our marriages. We have decided to limit contact and revisit being friends if and when our feelings have subsided.

When we made that decision, I was devastated. I couldn't eat or sleep, it is as if I lost someone I was in a full blown relationship with. Seeing him at work didn't help, though the good thing is that we have very limited contact from day to day. It is not an option for either of us to change teams or leave our work. I keep reminding myself of what's right logically and morally, and neither of us want to blow up our lives. But it's been one month now and my heart still feels sad. I do have a therapist I will be talking to and my partner and I are trying to work on our marriage. However, I feel like something is blocking my healing and I am stunned and frustrated by how much I feel for this person and how much this situation has affected me. I feel like a cliche and perhaps I am having a mid-life crisis.

Would appreciate any thoughts, comments, and advice.

Recently got Lelit Anna and struggle to get the pressure to work properly. 

The pressure gauge goes up very slowly even on finer grind and seems to reach 3-4 bars only. I started with coarser setting and made it finer until the coffee barely dripped out. If I pull the shot for longer the pressure continues rising very slowly up to 8 bars sometimes but that happen at a 1 minute mark or later.

I also tried using the blind basket and the issue seems to persist (did it according to instructions, turning pump for 10s on, 10s off) 

Without portafilter installed the water seems to flow through the group head just fine.

Wanted this specific model for a while and ordered from abroad so the return process is going to be difficult. Also there doesn’t seem to be an official repair centre where the warranty would work in the city I’m at. 
So if it’s possible to repair at home I would rather try that, any advice on how to resolve it would be very appreciated! 🙏

Ignore:  
Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of ""de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, ""Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.."", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from ""de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H.

1hbq2zj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hbq2zj,1987 Caymus + 1994 Domaine Carneros ,"Our wine group had a champagne and caviar end of the year celebration last night and it was truly wonderful! The only red that was served last night was this 1987 Caymus, which was a blind. 
I was lucky enough to guess it correctly, it’s the first blind I’ve ever gotten 100% right, although I will admit 1987 was an educated guess. 

TASTING NOTES: 
Caymus - Nothing like modern Caymus. Napa in its prime!! Seriously, what happened to these guys? This wine was alive for its age. Filled with red fruit, oak, cedar, turned soil, and a bit of sour cherry. Medium bodied, tannins were fine, soft but abundant. Super brickish, garnet/tawny in color. I found it to drink every bit of the 13% ABV it is, and would have guessed it higher. 
Lovely bottle in its prime right now. Anymore age and I fear the fruit will start to disappear. 
Loved the OG price tag on this one. 

1994 Domaine Carneros - I was astonished at how good this was for its age. Full of mocha, coffee, smoke, baked stone fruit, with a little salinity on the finish. Some of the citrus fruit was still there but it played second fiddle. Little moose, but what was there was fine and danced on the tongue. Stellar! ",1,1733910729.0,wine,2,1.0,False
1hbq20a,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrakashamParakkatte/comments/1hbq20a/chapter_9_a_new_day/,Chapter 9: A New Day,"Riya adjusted her pink churidar, smoothing out the creases as she glanced at her reflection. The soft fabric complemented her warm complexion, and the silver earrings she chose added just the right touch of sparkle. Yet, her stomach churned with an anxiety she couldn’t quite shake. Today was her first day at the office—not her first day with the company, but her first time stepping into this particular space. After months of working remotely, she was finally about to meet the team she’d only known through screens. She ran her fingers through her curly black hair, taming it just enough to frame her face. She wanted to look good—not just presentable, but confident, approachable, maybe even memorable. She exhaled sharply, willing her nerves to settle.

The flat she shared with her college friends was still quiet when she slipped out the door, the faint sound of someone’s alarm muffled through a closed bedroom. Swathi, the only one from their circle also working at the company, had mentioned meeting up one day, but her erratic schedule often kept her away from the office. Riya didn’t mind. She loved her friends and cherished the familiarity they brought to her life, but today was different. Today, she was stepping into an entirely new environment. She knew she’d manage—she was good at making friends, after all. It was one of her strengths. People often called her a social butterfly, and though she wasn’t always extroverted, she had an innate knack for connecting with others. Still, the thought of breaking into a team dynamic that already existed made her uneasy. She had been texting George about it all morning, venting about how awkward it might be. She wasn’t surprised when his name flashed on her screen just as she reached the staircase.

“Hey,” she answered, adjusting her bag over her shoulder.

“Hey, how are you feeling now?” George’s familiar voice came through, steady and comforting.

“Better, I think,” she replied, a smile tugging at her lips. “I mean, it’s just another office, right? What’s the worst that can happen?”

“You’ll be fine. You’re Riya. People like you instantly,” he said, his tone light but reassuring. “Just don’t overthink it. Remember, you’ve got this.”

She nodded, even though he couldn’t see her. George always knew the right thing to say. “I know,” she said softly. “Thanks, George. I’ll call you later, okay?”

“Don’t forget,” he teased. “And good luck.”

As the call ended, Riya felt a little lighter. George was right—she’d be fine. She stepped out into the crisp morning air, the soft hum of the city waking up around her. Today was a beginning, and if there was one thing she knew about herself, it was that she thrived in moments like this.

The office building loomed tall and reflective, its glass windows catching the soft morning light. Riya stepped inside, her sandals clicking softly against the polished floors. The space felt hushed, almost too quiet for an office that was supposedly buzzing with activity pre-COVID. She clutched her bag a little tighter as she approached the reception desk.

“Allie is waiting for you on the third floor,” the receptionist said, gesturing toward the elevators. Riya nodded, thanked her, and made her way up.

When the elevator doors opened, Allie was already there, waving enthusiastically. “Riya! Finally, we meet in person,” she said with a warm smile. Allie’s energy was as welcoming as it had been during their virtual meetings. “Come on, let me show you around.”

The office was sparsely populated, with only a handful of people scattered across the desks. Allie led her to their section, gesturing to the desks that made up their team’s little corner. “This is where you’ll be sitting. And over there, that’s Andy’s desk—he’s a character, you’ll see. David sits right next to him. They’re both running late, typical.”

Riya smiled politely, taking in the space. It wasn’t intimidating, just… empty.

“Don’t worry, you’ll meet everyone soon enough,” Allie reassured her. “For now, I’ll let you settle in. Here’s some documentation you can start with—it’ll help you get familiar with the projects. Let me know if you have any questions.”

As Riya sat down and arranged her things, she pulled out her blue-light glasses, slipping them on as she opened the documents Allie had handed her. She knew she looked serious, but it helped her focus. She’d just started reading when her phone buzzed with a message from George.

**George:** How’s it going? Met anyone yet?

**Riya:** Nope, not yet. Allie’s nice, though. And it’s so quiet here.

**George:** Quiet’s good. Less distraction. You’ll shine there, trust me.

She smiled at his message, her fingers hesitating over the screen before replying. George had always been her cheerleader, and she loved that about him. Even with his demanding job at the bank and their long-distance situation, he always found time to support her.

**Riya:** Thanks. Banking hours treating you okay?

**George:** It’s chaos, as usual. I’ll call you later when things calm down.

**Riya:** Okay, don’t forget to eat.

She tucked her phone away, her attention returning to the screen in front of her. The hours passed quietly until the sound of footsteps and muffled laughter signaled the arrival of her new teammates. She looked up to see two men walking toward her section.

“Hi! You must be Riya,” one of them said, flashing a wide grin. His casual demeanor and confident stride made him instantly likable. “I’m Andy, and this is David.”

David offered a small wave, his smile polite but reserved. “Welcome to the team,” he said simply.

“Thanks,” Riya replied, standing to shake their hands. Their introductions were brief, and though they seemed nice enough, she didn’t feel an immediate connection.

As the day wore on, Riya stayed immersed in her work. The documentation was dense, but she welcomed the distraction. When lunchtime rolled around, she declined the team’s invitation to join them, opting instead to explore the cafeteria with Swathi, who had dropped by for a quick lunch.

“This place is massive,” Riya said as Swathi led her through the sprawling cafeteria and adjoining common areas.

“You’ll get used to it,” Swathi replied, pointing out the best coffee machines and the quieter corners where you could escape during particularly hectic days. “And don’t worry, the team will warm up to you. They’re a good bunch.”

After lunch, Riya returned to her desk and spent the rest of the day reading and preparing for the week ahead. By the time the clock struck six, she was ready to call it a day. As she packed up her things, her phone buzzed again.

**George:** Heading home?

**Riya:** Yep. Today was okay. Just settling in.

**George:** Good. I’ll call you tonight.

Riya smiled to herself as she made her way out of the building. The day hadn’t been as overwhelming as she’d feared, and for that, she was grateful. Tomorrow, she’d try to make more of an effort to connect with the team, but for now, all she wanted was to curl up at home and recharge.",1,1733910613.0,PrakashamParakkatte,0,1.0,False

\- Dino-themed parties and bar events

\- Cafe visits to chat about all things dino over a coffee

Before I do, I’d love to hear your experiences to know if it’s just a limitation to compact travel strollers or due to the bugaboo design (it’s quite top heavy).

With the Bugaboo I struggle to steer it with two hands, my wrists get sore having to really concentrate on the steering and not to drive into people. It feels like I’m trying to manoeuvre a massive Costco trolly filled with stuff. You know that feeling when it’s a struggle to steer the Shopping cart?

My daughter is approx 15kg/33lbs so is it because she’s quite heavy/big?

Ideally, I’d like a compact travel stroller that is easy to steer, and bonus if I can occasionally steer with one hand because I’m holding a coffee, or taking a quick phone call.

This turned out pretty long, so your have a TLDR at the end.
I have been together with my GF for 9 months, we moved in together 2 months ago (I know it's very quick but I had a fight with my father, and she was spending a lot of money renting a place by herself).

 When we first started dating, we also worked together. While working together I noticed her do things a couple of times that seemed too flirty for me and made me jealous. I think one of my worse traits as a partner is that I get jealous pretty easily, but I really don't want to be controlling so i try to ignore it.

One example is, she started talking with a coworker about learning languages. When he said he has trouble with English, she offered to teach him by texting and calling him and practicing with him. Then she wrote her phone number on his wrist with a pen so they could keep in touch. (He didn't ask for her number, or tutoring. She just offered it and gave it to him)

After talking with a female acquaintance about it to make sure I'm not overreacting (she agreed and said my gf is too flirty with everyone), I had a talk with her. Told her that, and she was sorry. Said she doesn't know what exactly to do about it but she'll try her best. Similar things kept happening so we had 2 more talks with basically the same answer.

Since moving in with her, we both work separately. She keeps telling about men asking her out. Recently told me about having a long talk with a guy on the bus, who invited her to a coffee shop. She accepted, but told him she has a boyfriend, at which point he said he's sorry and took back the invitation.

The most concerning thing though, is that yesterday she met a new guy at work. He invited her and 2 other people to do another shift at a different place when they are done. She send me a message saying that she'll do another shift with a group of people she met and only come back home tommorow (today) at 7 am. So when they finished this shift he gave the 2 people who were with them a ride home, and offered my GF to come to his house since she lives far away, which she accepted. Told me he called his mother and told her ""I'm bringing a girl over. No not like that."" And he has a home gym where they just worked out together. After that they picked up the two other people and drove to do a night shift somewhere in town. Returned home by herself before the shift ended because she felt sick.
I know her well, I know she's not cheating because she's not that type of person. But I can't be the only one that thinks this is way too much. Right? Haven't told her anything about my feeling this time since it seems to make no difference.

TL:DR - GF met a new group at work today, went to do a night shift with them but while waiting went with one dude, who invited her to his house (by herself, just the two of them) and she accepted.

how do i deal with this?? i dont want to take melatonin or nyquil over fear of getting addicted to them - im the type to get addicted to anything (which is the reason i've stayed away from things like alcohol or even coffee).

in the past i've always ended up eventually sleeping at 4-5 but that was fine since my exams in the past were in the afternoon. not this one, i have it at 8 in the morning. should i just pull an all nighter tonight, possibly sleep during the day, and pull another all nighter tomorrow and sleep again after the exam??",1,1733909947.0,insomnia,1,1.0,False

This turned out pretty long, so your have a TLDR at the end.
I have been together with my GF for 9 months, we moved in together 2 months ago (I know it's very quick but I had a fight with my father, and she was spending a lot of money renting a place by herself).

 When we first started dating, we also worked together. While working together I noticed her do things a couple of times that seemed too flirty for me and made me jealous. I think one of my worse traits as a partner is that I get jealous pretty easily, but I really don't want to be controlling so i try to ignore it.

One example is, she started talking with a coworker about learning languages. When he said he has trouble with English, she offered to teach him by texting and calling him and practicing with him. Then she wrote her phone number on his wrist with a pen so they could keep in touch. (He didn't ask for her number, or tutoring. She just offered it and gave it to him)

After talking with a female acquaintance about it to make sure I'm not overreacting (she agreed and said my gf is too flirty with everyone), I had a talk with her. Told her that, and she was sorry. Said she doesn't know what exactly to do about it but she'll try her best. Similar things kept happening so we had 2 more talks with basically the same answer.

Since moving in with her, we both work separately. She keeps telling about men asking her out. Recently told me about having a long talk with a guy on the bus, who invited her to a coffee shop. She accepted, but told him she has a boyfriend, at which point he said he's sorry and took back the invitation.

The most concerning thing though, is that yesterday she met a new guy at work. He invited her and 2 other people to do another shift at a different place when they are done. She send me a message saying that she'll do another shift with a group of people she met and only come back home tommorow (today) at 7 am.

First off, my budget is around £1200 ($1530 according to google).

I love espresso as well as flat whites. I once had a nespresso machine, but found the taste very unsatisfactory. Saying I didn’t want to fall down the rabbit hole, I started making pour over and using an aeropress. I like these drinks, but it’s not quite what I’m after. My wife doesn’t like filter coffee, but would drink a latte and might make one if the process was straightforward.

At the moment I have a Fellow Opus.

I would either like to get an espresso machine that couples well with the Opus within budget, or machine and new grinder within budget. I also quite like the idea of the Sage/Breville touch impress, but appreciate that the built in grinder might be suboptimal. It’s also a little big. Ideally I’d also rather not have to use another grinder extra grinder with a machine that has a built in one.

I’d rather not get involved with mods, and straightforward use (and relatively fast warm up) would be beneficial although not too important to me. Aesthetically, I much prefer the look of a gaggia to a breville for instance.

Any ideas? I’m currently hovering around a bambino plus with df64 combination. I’d be appreciative to hear any thoughts on this!",2,1733909663.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

Long covid since 2022, and recovered quite well. But got new infection since beginning of November. And suddenly during the day, this is since a week or 2. 

What I found out is that the heavy part of the dizzyness is everyday around 10am. 

And the only stable thing around that time is that I drink 1 espresso around 09.00 o clock. 

I only drink one cup of coffee during the day. Is it possible that i am suddenly over reacting tot caffeine? 

 And that I am not able to drink caffeine anymore?

Some time after quitting booze (over 2 years ago) I thought it might be something to do to boost a bit. But I sense similar patterns as with my alcoholism, all secretive, feeling bad, stupid and why smoke when I could easily quit. Moreover being an anxious person by nature, which was indeed greatly reduced by removing alcohol, smoking triggers anxiety after one cigarette, physically by heart beating faster and other symptoms and mentally, guilt, fear of being caught. I don’t know how many packs I buy and throw away after two cigarettes saying this is the last. Same with coffee which gives my sensitive nervous system similar effects; speedy, over alert, impatient, unfocused, easily distracted. And yet I have the solution right there. Have tested it enough to know it’s not good for me (or anyone) or my wallet and yet there is a habit that kicks in - like I need to do a daily clinical test of that tea, that didn’t help. Insanity really. Not really looking for advice but if anyone is in the same situation (falsely believing it’s relieving stress) on really making that the last one.

I recently bought a Bugaboo Butterfly and I’m not entirely happy with it. I find it hard to manoeuvre and steer using both hands and it’s downright impossible to steer with one hand. 

Before I sell it on and buy a Joulz Aer +, can anyone tell me what their experience is like using a Joulz Aer+ with a toddler? My daughter is approx 15kg (33 lbs) so I’m not sure if it’s because she’s heavy/big, or if it’s due to the stroller design (It seems to be top heavy). 

Using the Bugaboo Butterfly my wrists get sore from having to really concentrate on the steering. It honestly feels like I’m trying to manoeuvre a massive Costco Cart filled with items – you know that feeling where you struggle to control the shopping cart? 

I want something that is easy to manoeuvre with a toddler in it and bonus if I can occasionally steer with one hand , if I’m holding a coffee, or taking a phone call etc. 

I’m ready to splurge on the Joulz Aer + but would really appreciate you sharing your experiences if you own and use a Joulz Aer +.

My #1 goal next semester is to get a summer internship, and I'm willing to do whatever it takes for that. I didn't really take high school super seriously, so I have no previous internship experience. In college, I've done some stuff, mainly working as a project manager in a programming club and working as a research assistant.

This fall recruiting season, I applied to like \~100 places, got a couple referrals, had a couple coffee chats, and talked to \~20 companies at my school's career fair. I had 3 interviews (all from cold applying), and nothing after that.

I really gotta lock in this winter + next semester, so I would really appreciate anyone's advice about getting their first internship or anything they've learned along the way. I also have a couple questions if anyone minds answering:

* are there still job openings posted over winter break? should i still keep applying?
* Is spring recruiting as big as the fall was? Or are a lot of companies done now
* current plans for break are LeetCode + personal project + relax. Is there anything else I should do to be productive?
* What are the best ways to network? I've done a lot of reaching out to people on LinkedIn, but I feel like it doesn't lead to much
* Is it worth sacrificing grades to practice DSA & do projects? I've already sort of started doing this lol. Was wondering how far I should take it. I think this semester I'll get 3-4 A's and 1-2 B's, making my GPA about 3.7-3.8.

As the title says I opened a coffee cart back in September in Vinilo Records , why? Because I was looking for a consistently good coffee spot in Southampton where I was guaranteed to not waste £3.50+ on a flat white that tastes like dishwater. I couldn’t find it, to be honest most of the coffee shops are set up by people with money but  no passion for coffee / hospitality (excluding Soroast and sorry if I’ve missed somewhere) . Also ,  this is 100 % self started , a coffee cart was the lowest barrier to entry for me and the cheapest way I could start this . 

So I’ve been working in coffee since 18, I started in the Starbucks on London Road 😅 but since have worked in some of the best specialty shops in Edinburgh🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 and Sydney 🇦🇺🐨 . Now 24 I think I have the hang of making a good coffee and I’m hoping if you like coffee you’ll try us. 

Where we are : Vinilo Records Store 💿 - Queensway
When we’re open : 10-2 Tuesday - Friday 10-4 Saturday 11-4 Sunday

Who roasts for us : Oddy Knocky / Seadog Coffee 

We are only serving in takeaway cups right now but the end goal is to set up some kind of vinyl cafe in 2025 .

","A possible career change from working in hospitality industry focused on food and beverage for at least 2 years. Now considering to try admin role or office type jobs, even if not directly related sa industry or course na tinapos.

Looking at different jobs, I found thru Indeed this admin assistant position for a coffee shop based in Rizal. After magpasa ng application, nagrespond agad sila saying na base sa qualifications ko, may potential raw ako sa kanilang mother company, for a sales related role based in an Ortigas office. It wasn't clear for me nung una, pero after some clarifications at napag-isipan onti, I confirmed for an interview kahapon for this sales position. Though mas prefer ko ung admin job sa Taytay since sa Antipolo ako umuuwi, considering ung daily commute, so binanggit ko ito sa reply tsaka rin sa actual interview. But would be hard to pass on an interesting role sa mother company. Wala akong actual experience sa sales maski admin work, pero I see this as a new learning opportunity, kung sakali matuloy ako.

So tumuloy ako sa preliminary interview to get to know at least a bit about the company, at kaunting research din ako the day before. Isa raw itong kilalang IT solutions company raw ito catering to architecture, engineering and construction, so more on design planning tsaka project management din. The work is office set-up, involves communicating with different clients in relation sa nabanggit na services. Never ako nag-call center so idk if similar ba talaga sa ganun, pero sabi sa interview it's quite different. In terms of work environment and culture, they said it's about attitude din if magiging ok ba sa work, nothing else elaborated pagdating sa nature of work.  Starting rate is NCR rate though di pa sila updated (a bit lower than actual updated rate), may 2 weeks paid training, then mon-fri 8 hours sched. Medj mababa compared sa previous F&B related job na 6 days duty, but weekends off kapalit rito.

So waiting na lang if magkaka final interview pa ako kung ico-consider pa rin talaga nila ako. Then may 2 weeks paid training naman, tsaka malalaman if fit ako sa role and if magustuhan ko ba talaga na ituloy. Though the position is labeled urgent and willing to start immediately, tinanong ako when ako willing mag-start, I said 1st or 2nd week ng January, kumbaga after new year para ma-enjoy ko pa ang holiday season. So ayun, pending pa sa HR ung decision. Tbh I felt like di ako 100% dito, pero such opportunity would be hard to let go eh. Marami-rami pa akong ibang applications pending sa iba though.

Should I really push through with this?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening is a popular cosmetic procedure that offers a quick and efficient way to transform your smile. Many people choose this option to address discoloration caused by various factors such as food, drinks, smoking, and aging. By looking at before and after comparisons, it's clear just how impactful teeth whitening can be on one's appearance and confidence.

The transformative effects of teeth whitening are evident in the visual differences seen in before and after images. A brighter smile not only enhances personal appearance but also affects how others perceive you. A study showed that individuals with whiter teeth were often seen as more attractive, successful, and even more trustworthy. This perception can play a significant role in social interactions and professional opportunities.

Here are some key points to consider regarding the impact of teeth whitening:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Initial State:** Many factors can contribute to the yellowing or dulling of teeth over time. Beverages like coffee, tea, and red wine, along with certain foods and habits, can leave stains. Smoking is another major contributor to the discoloration of teeth.
- **Whitening Solutions:** There are various methods available for whitening teeth. These include in-office treatments, at-home kits, and natural remedies. Professional treatments often yield the most dramatic results, but at-home solutions can still provide noticeable improvements.
- **Visual Improvements:** Before and after images often reveal a stark contrast. Many people experience several shades of teeth lightening, resulting in a much brighter smile that enhances their facial aesthetics.
- **Confidence Boost:** After undergoing teeth whitening, individuals frequently report feeling more confident. A gorgeous smile can lead to increased self-esteem, encouraging you to smile more and engage in social situations.
- **Long-term Care:** Post-whitening maintenance is crucial. To keep teeth looking their best, adopting good dental hygiene and making mindful food choices can prolong the effects of whitening treatments.

The immediate difference is incredible. A bright, white smile can inspire feelings of happiness and optimism. People often take notice of your smile before other features. This simple enhancement can become a focal point in conversations, making personal dynamics more positive.

However, potential users should also weigh the pros and cons of teeth whitening. It's important to consult with a dental professional before starting any treatment. Just as results vary, so do the reactions to whitening products. Some individuals may experience tooth sensitivity or gum irritation.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
When evaluating the effectiveness of teeth whitening, before and after pictures play a pivotal role. These visuals help prospective patients see what they can achieve. Many dental offices and cosmetic clinics highlight success stories through galleries of transformed smiles. Visiting these galleries can provide realistic expectations about the results of treatments.

Besides improving aesthetics, teeth whitening can also encourage better oral health habits. After investing time and money into achieving a bright smile, individuals may be more inclined to care for their teeth. This heightened awareness often leads to regular brushing, flossing, and dental check-ups.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
The significance of good lighting in before and after comparisons cannot be overstated. Proper lighting highlights the changes more effectively, allowing prospective patients to see the degree of transformation they can expect. Whether taken in a dental office or at home, these images serve as motivational tools for anyone considering teeth whitening.

It's essential to also mention the variety of whitening products available on the market. From strips and gels to trays and LED devices, there’s something for everyone. Each product has its own formulation and effectiveness, and some may yield quicker results than others. Doing thorough research and consulting with dental professionals can help in picking the right option.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
Whether you’re preparing for a big event or simply wanting to boost your daily confidence, teeth whitening can be a game changer. Observing the journey through before and after images shows just how transformative this procedure can be. With the right approach, achieving a radiant, white smile can lead to an enhanced quality of life. Doesn’t everyone deserve a smile they’re proud of?

Natural vs. Professional Teeth Whitening: What to Expect in Results
-------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to achieving a brighter smile, you may find yourself weighing the options between natural and professional teeth whitening. Each approach has its benefits and potential outcomes. Understanding what to expect from both methods can help you make an informed choice.

### Natural Teeth Whitening Options

Combining natural ingredients can help lighten your teeth over time. Here are some common methods:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Baking Soda:** This popular option can gently scrub away stains. Mix it with water to create a paste and brush your teeth with it a few times a week.
- **Vinegar:** Diluted apple cider vinegar can help whiten teeth. However, use it sparingly, as it can erode enamel if overused.
- **Activated Charcoal:** Many people swear by activated charcoal to absorb stains. Brush gently to avoid damaging enamel.
- **Fruits and Vegetables:** Crunchy foods like strawberries and pineapple contain enzymes that can naturally whiten teeth. Chewing them helps increase saliva, which cleanses your mouth.

While these methods can improve tooth brightness, the results tend to be subtle and gradual. You might see minor improvements in a few weeks, but achieving dramatic results is unlikely.

### Professional Teeth Whitening Options

For a more noticeable change, professional teeth whitening treatments are often the way to go. Here are some key methods:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **In-Office Whitening:** This method involves a dental professional applying a strong bleaching agent to your teeth, often paired with a light to enhance the effect. Results are typically evident immediately.
- **Take-Home Kits:** Dentists can provide customized trays and a professional-grade whitening gel for you to use at home. This usually takes longer than in-office whitening but still offers significant results.
- **Zoom Whitening:** One of the most popular professional treatments, Zoom involves a special light and gel to deliver rapid results, often whitening teeth several shades in just one appointment.

The outcomes from professional whitening are usually dramatic, with many people achieving multiple shades lighter in just a single session. You can often expect to see results between 5 to 10 shades lighter, depending on your original tooth color and the method used.

### What to Expect: A Comparison

To give you a clearer picture, let's compare key aspects of both natural and professional teeth whitening.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
<table> <tr> <th>Feature</th> <th>Natural Whitening</th> <th>Professional Whitening</th> </tr> <tr> <td>Time Required</td> <td>Weeks to months for visible results</td> <td>Immediate to a few hours</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Shade Improvement</td> <td>1-2 shades lighter</td> <td>Up to 10 shades lighter</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Cost</td> <td>Low (often less than $50)</td> <td>Higher (typically $300-$1000)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Sensitivity</td> <td>Low sensitivity</td> <td>May cause temporary sensitivity</td> </tr></table>

Choosing the right method for you often depends on time, budget, and how dramatic you want the results to be. Natural whitening may be suitable for those who prefer a more gradual and cost-effective approach. In contrast, professional whitening is ideal for those desiring a fast and noticeable transformation.

### Caring for Your Teeth Post-Whitening

Regardless of the method you choose, maintaining the brightness of your teeth is crucial. Here are some tips to keep that dazzling smile:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- Steer clear of staining foods and drinks, like coffee, red wine, and berries, for at least 24 hours after whitening.
- Practice excellent oral hygiene by brushing and flossing regularly.
- Consider using a whitening toothpaste to help maintain brightness.

Your smile is one of your most important features. Whether choosing natural or professional whitening, understanding what to expect will help you make the best decision for yourself.

### Conclusion

Experiencing the transformative effects of teeth whitening can truly be a game-changer for many. The dramatic differences seen in before and after comparisons highlight how even a single session can enhance your smile significantly. Whether you choose a natural method or opt for professional treatment, understanding what to expect in results is crucial.

Natural teeth whitening methods, while often gentle and safe, may take longer to show results and may require regular application for noticeable effects. On the other hand, professional teeth whitening treatments can lead to immediate and striking improvements. These procedures can lift tough stains and discoloration effectively, giving you a brighter smile almost instantly.

Regardless of the path you choose, the key takeaway is that a brighter smile is within reach, and the journey can greatly boost your confidence. Make sure to weigh the pros and cons of each option based on your needs and lifestyle. With proper care and maintenance, the benefits of whitening can last, allowing you to enjoy that brilliant smile well into the future. So whether you decide to go natural or professional, embrace the changes and celebrate the new you with a stunning, bright smile that speaks volumes.

Now, i dont guzzle 4 redbulls at once and crash at noon, i usually have one big V refresher and that'll last me from 7am to 6pm as i keep it in the fridge and take sips throughout the day, even when im drinking only a quarter can or half a day i get so tired fast and i feel almost as if im disassociating 

On my off days when im out of energy drinks i usually substitute the caffeine intake with black coffee as im not really interested in how it tastes i just moreso want the caffiene, when i do this, even if i ingest way more caffiene from the coffee than the energy drink, i feel like 20% more attentive than with energy drinks or meds alone.

With the green tea, i usually just drink green tea anyway as i really like it and don't drink it for the caffiene content, but when i do drink it i feel really focused and clear minded, has anyone else experienced this? if so do you have any advice? please tell me below!",1,1733906641.0,ADHD,4,1.0,False

One of us has run a coffee shop for 4 years, another 10 years and oversaw/worked on the building and opening of a second location at their company, and I have experience starting a business that has seen some success, along with 10 years of community event work. We are dreaming of combining our capital and skills to open a coffee shop by day, music by night. I’m hoping to hear some advice and tips. This is just at its conception level as we begin to research costs for leasing, build out, equipment, and more to create a business plan. I don’t know if this is a ridiculous idea, but we are hopeful with our skills and ties to our local communities that we can make it.",1,1733906167.0,Entrepreneur,0,1.0,False

1hbp2t7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diamondsreview/comments/1hbp2t7/if_diamonds_key_notes_and_expert_tips_for_diamond/,IF Diamonds: Key Notes and Expert Tips for Diamond Buyers,"IF (Internally Flawless) diamonds represent absolute perfection in clarity, with fewer than 0.5% of all diamonds achieving this extreme-grade distinction. Market analysis shows these extraordinary stones command a 20-30% premium over VVS1 grades, entering a realm where geological perfection intersects with collector passion.

This definitive guide provides simple yet smart strategies for navigating the IF market, maximizing returns in this guaranteed-perfect clarity grade.

# Bottom Line

When considering IF (Internally Flawless) diamonds, here are the key takeaways:

* IF diamonds have no visible internal inclusions but may have tiny surface blemishes.
* They're extremely rare, making up less than 1% of all diamonds on the market.
* IF diamonds command high prices due to their rarity, often costing thousands more than visually similar lower-clarity diamonds.
* While flawless, they're often indistinguishable from eye-clean diamonds of lower clarity grades without magnification.
* The cut quality of a diamond often influences its beauty more than its clarity grade.
* IF diamonds appeal to those seeking the ultimate in diamond purity and exclusivity.
* By buying an IF lab-grown diamond, you can save 70-80% of your budget or buy a larger and more beautiful stone.
* **Recommended Vendors**: For a reliable buying experience, consider purchasing from trusted retailers that provide comprehensive grading reports and advanced visualization tools to assist in selecting the perfect stone.

# Who is this for?

* Collectors and enthusiasts seeking the rarest and highest clarity grade diamonds
* Buyers who prioritize purity and exclusivity in their diamond purchases
* Those with flexible budgets who want top-tier clarity regardless of cost
* Individuals looking for ""investment-grade"" diamonds

# Who is this not for?

* Budget-conscious shoppers seeking the best value for their money
* Those prioritizing visible beauty over technical grading
* Buyers who are satisfied with eye-clean diamonds of lower clarity grades
* People focusing on other diamond qualities like cut or color over clarity

# Recommendations for smart buying

1. Compare prices: Look at IF diamonds alongside VS1 to VVS1 grades to understand the price difference.
2. Prioritize cut: Remember that a well-cut diamond often appears more brilliant than a poorly cut higher clarity diamond.
3. Consider lower clarity: Eye-clean VS2 or SI1 diamonds can offer better value while looking identical to the naked eye.
4. Use magnification: When possible, examine diamonds under magnification to appreciate the clarity differences.
5. Buy from reputable sellers: Choose retailers like James Allen or Blue Nile that offer high-quality imaging and certificates.
6. Balance the 4Cs: Don't focus solely on clarity; consider how it fits with cut, color, and carat weight.

# FAQ

Q: Can I see the difference between an IF diamond and a lower clarity diamond?  
A: Generally, no. Without magnification, IF diamonds look identical to eye-clean diamonds of lower grades.

Q: Are IF diamonds a good investment?  
A: While they hold value due to rarity, diamonds aren't typically considered good investments. Buy for personal enjoyment rather than financial gain.

Q: Do IF diamonds sparkle more?  
A: Not necessarily. A well-cut diamond of lower clarity can sparkle just as much or more than an IF diamond.

Q: How much more expensive are IF diamonds?  
A: They can cost 20-30% more than similar diamonds of slightly lower clarity grades.

Q: Should I choose an IF diamond for an engagement ring?  
A: It's not necessary unless it holds personal significance. Many find excellent value in eye-clean diamonds of lower clarity grades.

Editor's Note: I'm currently writing a comprehensive book on diamond buying that dives deep into every aspect of the industry. However, I understand that sometimes you just need quick, actionable advice without wading through pages of details.

These articles distill essential insights from my extensive research, stripped of industry jargon and marketing fluff.

A true small business with one ajumma selling freshly baked/fried items from a small shed (?) out the front of her house. 

I opted for a fried korokke bun thing, a couple of freshly fried kkwabegis, and a massive kumara cream bread thing (not pictured). 

The korokke is essentially a croquette wrapped with a dough, lightly crumbed, and deep fried. The fillings in this case was mostly mashed potato, with a bit of onion and carrot. The dough was so super fluffy and light. I could’ve easily gone for more. 

The kkwabegi are a childhood favourite of mine, and these didn’t disappoint. Lightly fried but still a little greasy in a good way, and rolled in a light bit of plain white sugar for sweetness and a little texture. These were yoza as. 

The kumara cream bread thing was also mean, and was filled with probably a whole ass mashed kumara. Didn’t get pics cause I demolished that at the airport along with some Krispy Kremes. 

About $22 for four pieces of very good bread.
