I’ve learnt that over time that it’s ok to go: you don’t know each other, you’ll likely never see each other again, you have no mutual obligations. But if I leave, I’ll leave quickly. 

I’ve noticed before some guys not enjoying the hookup with me but who have grinned and beared it. If they have said “this isn’t working“ I’m fine with that (after an initial pang of disappointment maybe). 

This week a guy came over who I’d chatted to on Grindr. He had been very chatty and had sent lots of voice messages about what he wanted to do. He looked nice but there was no real chemistry and fell into the category “grin and bear it”. We kissed and then he started blowing me, before he said “this won’t work”. I thought “fine”, but then he started justifying his decision, about how he hated coffee (I‘d just had a coffee before he came, but who hates coffee?) and then he started asking me again where I was from due to my accent (I’m an immigrant in the country I live in). I got a bit shirty, and asked him  to leave. I mean, I get he was trying to smooth over the unpleasantness of the situation, but I didn’t feel it was the occasion for small talk about my origin story.

# The Day I Learned Volatility Has a Personality

It was February 24, 2022. Russia invaded Ukraine, and I was holding a portfolio of tech stocks that proceeded to drop 15% before I finished my morning coffee. I panicked, sold everything, and watched the market bounce back 8% by lunch. Later that week, I bought back in at higher prices, just in time for the next leg down. By March, I'd managed to turn a 15% portfolio decline into a 34% personal decline through sheer, spectacular mismanagement of volatility. My broker sent me a thank-you card. Probably.

# Volatility Isn't Chaos—It's Just Speaking a Different Language

Most traders treat volatility like that one relative who shows up to Thanksgiving drunk and unpredictable—you either avoid them entirely or react emotionally when they inevitably cause a scene. But volatility, like drunk relatives, actually follows patterns if you know what to look for. It's not random; it's just complex, and complexity feels like randomness when you don't understand the underlying structure.

Here's a statistic that changed how I think about markets: according to research from the Chicago Board Options Exchange, volatility clustering—periods of high volatility followed by more high volatility, and vice versa—accounts for approximately 70-80% of observed market behavior. This means that when markets get wild, they tend to stay wild for a while. And when they're calm, that calm persists. This isn't luck; it's the market's natural rhythm.

# Time-Based Volatility: The Pattern Hidden in Plain Sight

Volatility isn't just about how much markets move—it's about when they move. Anyone who's traded through a market open knows that the first 30 minutes are a completely different animal than mid-afternoon doldrums. The same asset can have 3x higher volatility at 9:45 AM compared to 1:30 PM, not because of any fundamental change, but because of who is trading and why.

Morning sessions see institutional order flow, overnight news digestion, and algorithmic positioning. Afternoon sessions see reduced participation, lower liquidity, and markets that drift like a boat with no motor. Understanding these time-based patterns is like knowing which hours your local gym is crowded versus empty—you can still work out either way, but your experience and results will be dramatically different.

# The Father Time Engine Explained (Without the Time Travel)

No, it's not actually a time machine, which is disappointing because I'd definitely use that to buy Bitcoin in 2010. What time-based volatility engines actually do is model how volatility changes throughout trading sessions, identifying windows where price movement is statistically more likely to be significant versus noise. It's the difference between fishing in a stocked pond versus casting into an empty swimming pool—both involve fishing, but only one has a reasonable chance of success.

Platforms like [AlignTech](https://fintech.aligntech.io/) have developed sophisticated volatility modeling that tracks these temporal patterns across multiple asset classes. Their approach treats volatility as a dynamic, time-dependent variable rather than a static assumption. This matters because trading strategies that work beautifully during high-volatility windows will get you destroyed during low-volatility chop, and vice versa.

# Volatility Regimes: Knowing Which Game You're Playing

Markets operate in different volatility regimes—low vol, medium vol, high vol, and ""dear god what is happening"" vol. Each regime requires different strategies, position sizes, and risk management approaches. Trading a trend-following strategy during a low-volatility consolidation period is like bringing a surfboard to a swimming pool—you have the wrong equipment for the conditions.

The pros constantly assess which regime they're in and adjust accordingly. In low vol, they might use tighter stops and smaller targets, accepting that big moves are unlikely. In high vol, they widen stops to avoid getting whipsawed and look for larger targets to justify the increased risk. This regime awareness is what separates traders who survive multiple market cycles from those who blow up the first time volatility spikes.

# Options Traders: This Is Your Bread and Butter

If you trade options, volatility isn't just something to manage—it's literally what you're trading. Implied volatility (what the market expects) versus realized volatility (what actually happens) is the core dynamic that determines options pricing. Buying options when implied vol is low and selling when it's high is theoretically the holy grail, except timing that correctly requires understanding volatility patterns better than the market does.

Here's a practical example: before major earnings announcements, implied volatility typically expands 30-50% as traders position for potential moves. After earnings, that implied vol collapses regardless of which direction the stock moves. Traders who understand this pattern can structure positions that profit from the volatility contraction rather than trying to predict the directional move. It's like being the casino instead of the gambler—slight edge, repeated many times, equals consistent profits.

It's not about predicting volatility spikes—it's about being prepared for them when they inevitably arrive.

If you're currently trading the same way regardless of market volatility, you're essentially wearing a winter coat in summer because ""it's my favorite coat."" Adapt to conditions, respect the volatility cycle, and stop treating every market environment like it's the same.

1rbgcyz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AltBeautyHub/comments/1rbgcyz/finally_nailed_that_90s_alt_reverie_look_ive_been/,"Finally nailed that '90s alt reverie look I've been dreaming of: Messy, inky eyeliner and a dewdrop highlight that actually lasts (inspired by vintage grunge zines, used a $15 cream shadow stick) 🦇","You know how sometimes you see those amazing, elaborate literary gothic makeup looks online and think, ""How do I even begin to translate that for a Tuesday at the coffee shop?"" Yeah, me too. I’ve definitely had my share of attempts that ended up looking more like I slept in my eyeliner than channeling dark academia elegance. But lately, I’ve been playing with the idea of a *softer* gothic, a ""Reverie Escapist meets Literary Gothic"" vibe, focusing on moody tones that don't overwhelm. My latest mission: achieving ""haunted elegance"" without looking like a raccoon or spending an hour blending.

Here's a breakdown of my most recent (and surprisingly successful) experiment:

*   **Aesthetic Goal:** ""Haunted elegance,"" blending Literary Gothic's moody depth with Reverie Escapist's dreamy, ethereal quality. The idea was less about harsh lines and more about diffused, soft shadows and a touch of melancholy.
*   **Key Products & Techniques:**
    *   **Eyes:** The goal was smoky but *not* heavy.
        *   **Base:** A sheer wash of **NYX Jumbo Eye Pencil in 'Milk'** (around $5), applied *very lightly* with my finger and blended out. Just enough for shadows to grip.
        *   **Main Shadow:** Instead of stark black, I reached for a deep, smoky plum-brown. **ColourPop Super Shock Shadow in 'Deep Dive'** (around $7) applied with a fluffy brush, concentrating it on the outer V and gently smudging it into the crease. The slight shimmer actually helped diffuse the darkness beautifully.
        *   **Lower Lash Line:** A tiny bit of the same ColourPop shadow, just *barely* smudged with a pencil brush, focused on the outer third.
        *   **Liner (Soft):** **ELF No Budge Retractable Eyeliner in 'Coffee'** (around $4) smudged *only* at the very base of the upper lash line, then immediately softened with a clean, flat brush. No sharp wings, just subtle definition.
        *   **Mascara:** **Maybelline Sky High Mascara in 'Blackest Black'** (around $10), two coats, focused on lengthening rather than volume to keep the eyes looking airy, not weighed down.
    *   **Face:** Kept it intentionally minimal to let the eyes be the focus and maintain the dreamy feel.
        *   **Base:** Just **Glossier Skin Tint in G10** (around $26) applied with fingers for a natural, slightly dewy finish. I wanted my natural skin to show through, adding to that 'escapist' feel.
        *   **Blush:** A muted, dusty rose applied *sparingly* to the apples of the cheeks and blended upwards. I used **Milani Baked Blush in 'Berry Amore'** (around $8), but literally just a whisper.
        *   **Highlight:** A very subtle, cool-toned highlight on the high points, like **Wet n Wild MegaGlo Highlighting Powder in 'Precious Petals'** (around $5), applied with a light hand to catch the light softly, not overtly shimmer.
    *   **Lips:** Aimed for a 'bitten,' slightly faded plum.
        *   **Color:** I used **e.l.f. Sheer Slick Lipstick in 'Black Cherry'** (around $5). Applied it, blotted heavily with a tissue, then lightly dabbed a tiny bit more in the center of the lips with my finger. This gives that diffused, ""just stained"" look without being a full-on vampy lip.
*   **Time Invested:** Around 15-20 minutes total. The key was to keep each step quick and light-handed.

Honestly, my first few attempts with this concept were... interesting. One day, I accidentally went too heavy on the plum shadow, and it definitely ventured into ""bruised eye"" territory rather than ""haunted elegance."" Another time, the sheer lipstick just looked patchy. What I learned is that ""soft"" alt beauty isn't necessarily about *less* product, but about *how* you apply it – light layers, lots of blending, and stepping back to check your work. The biggest surprise was how much the sheer Glossier tint helped – usually, I feel like I need more coverage for a ""gothic"" look, but letting my natural skin show through actually enhanced the ""dreamy escapist"" vibe. It definitely pushed me out of my usual comfort zone of crisp lines and opaque colors, reminding me that sometimes, a softer touch makes a bigger statement.

I’m no longer one of those people who didn’t do what everyone else did and I will wear my heart on my sleeve and say yes, I did get the smallest amount of joy knowing that I never drank coffee when everyone else did.

I’m not trying to be disingenuous, I guess I like the coffee in the morning. I like putting a little bit of milk in it. Sometimes it even gives me a small spark of joy at night time knowing that I get to wake up tomorrow and start my day with coffee.

1rbgcus,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingthruit/comments/1rbgcus/micro_scenes_additional_details/,Micro- scenes Additional Details,"The Highsmith Integration Guide: Refining the Micro-Scenes
 
This guide provides the technical bridge between Patricia Highsmith’s Lesson on Silent Manipulation and your 10-Week Micro-Scene Behavioral Drills. At a master's level, these revision prompts are designed to scrub your prose of ""obviousness"" and replace it with high-stakes psychological subtext.
 
 
 
 
 
I. General Implementation Guidance
 
To ""Highsmith"" your micro-scenes, follow these three narrative commands:
 
1. Manage the Void: If a scene feels flat, remove the character's dialogue and replace it with a Strategic Silence. Observe how the other characters in the scene rush to fill that silence with their own fears or assumptions.
 
2. Monitor the Physical Tell: Never tell us a character is lying or angry. Instead, show us the Internal Friction. Describe the character's jaw tightening, their muscles tensing, or their breathing becoming ""maniacally controlled"" while their surface remain perfectly polite.
 
3. Leverage Affective Alignment: Use a Close Third Person perspective to filter the environment through the character's pathology. If the character is a sadist, describe the victim's pain as a ""curious pattern"" or a ""geometric shift"" rather than an emotional tragedy.
 
 
 
 
 
II. Weekly Highsmithian Revision Prompts
 
Apply these specific prompts to your existing micro-scene drafts to deepen the psychological subtext.
 
 
 
Week 1: The Pathological Liar
 
Prompt: Apply ""The Vacuum."" In Scene 1.1 (The Stolen History), remove the last sentence of Elias's dialogue. Let Sarah fill the silence with her own empathetic assumption about his ""pain."" Show Elias watching her ""create"" the rest of the lie for him.
 
 
 
Week 2: The Grandiose Narcissist
 
Prompt: Apply ""Maniacal Politeness."" In Scene 2.1 (The Interrupted Triumph), emphasize Julian's physical monitoring. While he redirects the conversation, describe the ""maniacal precision"" with which he cuts his steak—a physical manifestation of his need to ""cut"" Clara's success.
 
 
 
Week 3: The Machiavellian Architect
 
Prompt: Apply ""Strategic Silence."" In Scene 3.1 (The Silence), describe the silence not as a lack of sound, but as a ""physical weight"" Marcus places on the room. Focus on how the silence forces Ben and Sarah to become more extreme in their behaviors.
 
 
 
Week 4: The Opportunistic Thief
 
Prompt: Apply ""Aesthetic Appropriation."" In Scene 4.1 (The Justified Taking), describe the silver thimble as if it were a missing piece of Lenore's own body. When she slips it into her pocket, don't focus on the ""theft,"" but on the ""aesthetic click"" of her identity finally becoming whole.
 
 
 
Week 5: The Covert Narcissist
 
Prompt: Apply ""Weaponized Vulnerability."" In Scene 5.1 (The Public Sigh), ensure Helen's ""martyrdom"" is perfectly polite. She shouldn't complain; she should ""maniacally protect"" the hosts from her own sadness, which—ironically—makes her sadness the only thing anyone can talk about.
 
 
 
Week 6: The Sadistic Provocateur
 
Prompt: Apply ""Epistemic Control."" In Scene 6.1 (The Surgical Insecurity), use the close third person to describe the boy's trembling hand as a ""fascinating specimen."" Remove any ""guilt"" from Victor's POV; he is a scientist, and the boy's fear is merely data.
 
 
 
Week 7: The Unscrupulous Social Climber
 
Prompt: Apply ""Mirroring."" In Scene 7.1 (The Accent Shift), have Thomas literally adopt the posture and rhythm of the Duchess's breathing. Show the moment his own ""core"" disappears as he becomes her perfect, silent reflection.
 
 
 
Week 8: The Paranoid Tyrant
 
Prompt: Apply ""The Void."" In Scene 8.1 (The Loyalty Trap), have Silas remain silent after David enters the room. Let the ""void"" of Silas's silence pressure David into a defensive monologue that reveals a secret David wasn't even hiding.
 
 
 
Week 9: The Resentful Saboteur
 
Prompt: Apply ""Maniacal Politeness."" Before Gregory sends the anonymous email in Scene 9.1, write a 50-word interaction where he is ""chillingly kind"" to Claire, offering her a coffee or a compliment. The ""Silent Manipulation"" is the gap between the kindness and the strike.
 
 
 
Week 10: The Moral Nihilist
 
Prompt: Apply ""Affective Alignment."" In Scene 10.1 (The Flat Transgression), ensure the prose is devoid of ""human"" words. Describe the fire not as a tragedy, but as a ""conversion of matter."" Force the reader to experience the scene's physics, not its morality.

The next day I checked out and told him to try out a few cookies I made. (This was lowkey me putting myself out there bc I found him cute looooll)

1rbgbvk,https://i.redd.it/2cqzpzcq80lg1.jpeg,23M Seeking to vibe with new pals around the globe,"Hello internet people. Makin friends through these means is kinda fun for meand I’ve been lucky enough to make friends form here that stays in touch with me for a long time. That’s why I wanna try this again. But since i’m diving back here, something feels off and people are pointing out about bots and dead internet. So let’s see if I can get real human to be friends with me, lol.

So here’s a quick intro:

Call me Felix, I’m a human person of 23 years old. I’m based in Southeast Asia and currently living a post-event crash because I finally finished my long overdue andergrad thesis that took me an extra 1 and a half years in college. It certainly an experience juggling and wrestling with a massive destination branding project, a spicy mix of clinical depression, and way too many sleepless nights.

I’m here looking for dem random chaos of talking to people who live a completely different life from across the globe. Exchanging experience from mundane dailies to niches, what it’s like living there. No expectations, no pressures, just be you. Quick disclaimer, I'm in a healthy open relationship with my man (I also met him this way, can you believe that!?). Some who vibes with me sticks around, but I’m not against a quick chat ofc, that's where the chaos is. Online pals of mine I’ve met stills regularly catching up with me, daily, monthly, maybe next year it doesn’t matter. It’s nice to know that people still catch up to you after long time. Sometime we just shares silly stuff and random pics from daily commutes, I always find it fascinating how different live from even the next border could be different from mine. So wherever you’re from, when we can ping-pong eachother’s while taking things unseriously, we might vibe vibe.

Quick intro end, long ahh brainfarts ahead:

Right now I’m a soon-to-graduate design student after a five and a half year there. WOWWWWOWW?! Five and a half year?! Yes, where I’m from, doiing a final project+undergrad thesis is a requerement to graduate. I heard it called captsone project in english term. A paper and project culmination of my studies for the last 4 years as an undergrad. Mine is apparently too much for a single person to handle but what the heck I did it, BY MY OWN, a whole ass destination branding project that could be a project for a whole studio. BUT I FINALLY DID IT!. Submitted my final paper last week and the other shenanigans requirement. The output is pretty satisfactory atleast for my stnadard. I can show you some of my final exhibition display if you like.

I’ve been in the trenches of mental healths for a long time and just recently it crawled back out after awhile. I though I had it all until things hits me, I gotta live with this forever. But, hey, there’s nothing I can’t do. I made it this far might es well keep it going. I don’t like this vibe but i’m getting rid o fit slowly though meds and therapy and healthy living again bit by bit. I got lonely very often because of that, like dreading lonelyness, even though I’m surounded by many great irl. I find this as one of my escapism and end up with many great online conenction.I find comforts in talking to new people online and listening to their mudnane daily life, their interest, their hyperfixations, tell me wht’s the weather is like or what you’r next cup of coffee order will be. We might be a long term friends or maybe um uhh bromance cough.

As for the pals I made, I found one who loves writing and giving me long replies making it feels like a pen-pal-esque, one who loves collecting fossils around his town, one who loves hiking around in local spots, one who just living the Cali life, a few more, and one bf whose trying 3d modelling. To my surprise for friends I made o non reddit, they’re great! I wish to find more so maybe you’re next? Idk let’s see.

We can play 20 questions and ask eachother random ahh question to keep the convo going, I find it silly and fun way to get to know people quickly. Or maybe we already have common interest if you wanna check the board I mad ein my profile. I try I best to condence what i’ve been obsessed over my live lol.

Wanna tryna skipp the small talks? Dm me with “Panda” so I know you’re a real person and not just the dead internet bot and you actually put time to read through this long ahh brainfarts and actually interested to vibe. Tell me your go to snacks or coffe order, tell me your last game or movie you wathced that got you hooked. I’m a better listener than talker so feel free to share more, but you’ll find out if we clicks if I share and talk more than you 👉👈. The more you tell me about yourself, the more you'll know about me. Let’s vibe.

i spent months researching this after realizing i couldn't finish a single task without checking my phone 47 times. read like 15 books, binged neuroscience podcasts, talked to actual researchers. turns out our brains literally weren't designed for the dopamine assault we're putting them through daily. social media, junk food, constant notifications, they've all rewired our reward circuits to crave instant hits instead of meaningful progress.

the good news? you can actually reverse this. it's not about willpower or discipline or any of that toxic productivity BS. it's about understanding how your brain's motivation system works and stopping the things that are actively sabotaging it.

**here's what actually moves the needle:**

* **do a proper dopamine detox, not the fake internet version**
   * most people think dopamine detox means sitting in a dark room doing nothing. that's not it. dr. andrew huberman (stanford neuroscientist) explains on his podcast that it's about reducing the HIGH spikes of easy dopamine so your baseline resets. cut out the stuff that gives you instant gratification with zero effort: endless scrolling, junk food binges, binge watching shows.
   * start with 24 hours. just one day where you don't touch social media, don't eat processed sugar, don't watch netflix. read, walk, cook actual food, be bored. your brain will HATE this at first because it's used to constant stimulation. that discomfort is literally your dopamine receptors recalibrating.
   * i use an app called **one sec** for this. it adds a breathing exercise before you open addictive apps. sounds dumb but it breaks the automatic reaching for dopamine hits. creates just enough friction to make you conscious of what you're doing.
* **fix your dopamine baseline with boring lifestyle stuff**
   * sleep is non negotiable. dr. matthew walker's book **""**[Why We Sleep](https://a.co/d/09rrArj2)**""** is legitimately terrifying and will make you respect your sleep schedule. when you're sleep deprived, your prefrontal cortex (the part that helps you make good decisions and stay motivated) basically shuts down. you're running on fumes and wondering why you can't focus.
   * cold exposure actually works. i know it sounds like bro science but there's real research behind it. 2-3 minutes of cold shower increases dopamine by 250% and it lasts for HOURS. not the fleeting spike you get from scrolling, but sustained elevation that actually helps you do hard things.
   * **the book: ""**[Dopamine Nation](https://a.co/d/005DhUWd)**"" by dr. anna lembke** (stanford psychiatry professor, literally wrote the book on addiction). this one is INSANELY good. she explains how we've created a dopamine deficit state by constantly chasing pleasure. includes actual case studies and a framework for resetting your reward system. made me realize how much of my ""laziness"" was just a depleted dopamine system trying to protect itself.
* **relearn how to do hard things**
   * your brain needs to remember that effort feels good. not in a toxic grind culture way, but in a ""i built something and it matters"" way. the problem is we've trained ourselves to avoid any discomfort.
   * try **habit stacking**. james clear talks about this but the neuroscience checks out. attach a new behavior to an existing habit. after you brush your teeth, do 10 pushups. after you make coffee, write for 5 minutes. your brain already has neural pathways for the first habit, so you're piggybacking on existing motivation circuits instead of trying to create willpower from nothing.
   * check out **centered app** for deep work sessions. it combines gentle accountability with focus timers. tracks when you get distracted, helps you notice patterns. way less aggressive than those apps that lock you out of your phone but actually effective for building focus muscle.
* **understand the motivation comes AFTER you start, not before**
   * this is from behavioral psychology research and it's a game changer. we think we need to FEEL motivated to start doing something. completely backwards. motivation is a result of action, not a prerequisite.
   * the **2 minute rule**: just commit to doing something for 2 minutes. usually you'll keep going because starting is the hard part. if you don't, that's fine too. you're still building the neural pathway of following through on commitments to yourself.
   * **""Atomic Habits"" by james clear** breaks this down perfectly. won't lie, everyone recommends this book but there's a reason. it's not fluffy self help garbage, it's actually based on behavioral science research. focuses on systems over goals, which is exactly how you rebuild sustainable motivation instead of relying on bursts of inspiration that fade.
* if reading full books feels overwhelming right now, there's an app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that pulls from neuroscience research, books like the ones mentioned here, and expert talks to create personalized audio content. you type in something specific like ""i'm burnt out and can't focus on anything,"" and it builds a learning plan with episodes you can listen to during your commute. the depth is adjustable too, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. built by AI experts from Google, it's less about grinding through self-help content and more about making the science behind motivation feel accessible when you're too tired to read. plus the voice options (including a surprisingly soothing one) make it genuinely easy to stick with.
* **get your reward system working properly again**
   * celebrate small wins intentionally. sounds cheesy but your brain needs to learn that progress feels good again. finished a task? take a genuine moment to feel satisfied before moving to the next thing. we've lost this because we immediately jump to the next dopamine hit.
   * **practice being bored**. seriously. boredom is actually when your brain does its best problem solving and creative thinking. but we've eliminated every moment of boredom from our lives. waiting in line? phone. sitting on the toilet? phone. your default mode network (the part of your brain that processes experiences and generates insights) never gets activated anymore.
   * try the **finch app** for gentle habit tracking. it's less punishing than other habit apps, uses a cute bird metaphor. tracks your mood alongside habits so you can see patterns. helps you be compassionate with yourself while still building consistency.

the thing is, resetting your motivation isn't about becoming some productivity robot. it's about remembering what it feels like to genuinely WANT to do things instead of forcing yourself through sheer willpower or shame.

your brain's reward system evolved over millions of years to help you survive and thrive. it got completely overwhelmed in like 15 years of smartphone evolution. you're not lazy or broken. your motivation system is just exhausted from being constantly exploited.

About 2 months after our wedding I kinda screwed up. I went out one evening to a pub where people gathered to talk about the subject I am incredibly passionate about. For privacy purposes let’s say it’s “frogs”. At the pub I talked to many different people about frogs but then I met another woman who was also extremely passionate about the type of frogs I am. We shared our passion by having extremely stimulating conversations until about 12 midnight when I decided to go home. We exchanged numbers so we could continue chatting about frogs. Here is where is screwed up. I never told this woman I was married and after I came home I never told my wife that I had exchanged numbers with the woman. The next evening I got a text message from the woman asking me how it’s going. My wife saw the text and asked who this is. I came clean to her who it was. She wasn’t happy that I didn’t tell her immediately about her and exchanging numbers but she left it at that. So for the next day we texted about frogs again and she asked me whether I would like to meet for a coffee. I of course said yes because I wanted to continue our stimulating conversations! My wife came back home from work and asked different questions about her and prodded around. She asked whether I would meet her and I came clean again and said yes, I am meeting her for coffee next week and lending my book to her about frogs. She wasn’t happy at all and said she would come with me then to meet her too. I said no but she insisted and made me tell the woman that my wife was gonna come too. My wife was crying and very very upset that I had arranged a meeting with another woman without telling her upfront. Why I had exchanged numbers without full transparency that I was married or letting my wife know. My wife sensed that this woman wanted more than just talk about frogs. Before the coffee meeting I got another text from the woman that she won’t come because she is sick. I never heard from her ever again. That only confirmed my wife’s suspicions. Later I understood that I really hurt my wife and now I fully take accountability that I broke my wife’s trust by not being transparent. I was young and naive and not thinking. I was infatuated by the novelty and the extremely stimulating conversations, something my wife couldn’t give me at home. I haven’t done anything like that ever since and learned my lesson that I don’t want to destroy our marriage.

So 4 years later, however, my wife still has trust issues around that. Just recently I started a new corporate job and my wife had a wave of anxiety and rumination that week. She said she fears that this could repeat again. That I would meet a new woman who I found exciting and stimulating in the right way my wife wasn’t. I assured her that this wouldn’t happen. We have a Friday social evening planned in 2 weeks at work where we will go to laser tag and have drinks afterwards and my wife has been crying and asking me about my female coworkers. I again told her I would not do a thing that would destroy our marriage but I just can’t calm her anxiety.

How can I make things better and improve the trust in our marriage?

Tldr: 4 years ago I screwed up by texting and planning to meet a woman behind my wife’s back and she still has trust issues even though I haven’t done anything since.",1,1771747154.0,marriageadvice,0,1.0,False

The abuse was due to things like scratching our noses while eating, spilling water, forgetting to close the light, accidentally making too much plate noises while doing dishes, biting nails, talking too loudly, or if we stared at him, etc. He also threatened us with strange statements like ""I'll bury you alive in the backyard"" or ""I'm going to stab both your eyes with this pen.""

Not looking for rebounds or drama.
Just good feminine company, fun conversations, and normal human connection again.

About me:

• Calm personality, observant, good listener
• Dark humour once comfortable
• Enjoy rides, exploring places, Wonderla/random plans
• Low drama, high loyalty person
• Languages: Telugu, Kannada, English, Hindi

What I’m looking for:
A chill, emotionally mature girl to hang out with sometimes — coffee, walks, random Bangalore plans, or just conversations after work.
No pressure, no forced labels. Just natural vibe and respectful company.

If you’re also rebuilding your circle or want one grounded, drama-free guy friend in Bangalore — DM.

1rbfykh,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1rbfykh/i_work_at_an_eerie_fish_farm/,I work at an eerie fish farm,"Ever since I came home after graduating, finding work in my field of study has been difficult. There aren’t many places where a marine scientist that is fresh out of university can work in the outback. So, when I heard mention of a fish farm near my current apartment, I looked online to see if they were looking for work. That’s how I ended up here, on a small fish farm in the middle of the flat, desert-like bushland of down-under.

I have grown used to the heat, I did grow up in the countryside after all, but out here it gets so hot that you can cook eggs on the bonnet of your ute. That’s why my job is separated into two significant parts. That being manual labour in the morning, and lab work around midday. It’s a good balance that gives me a bit of time to document some of the strange and unexplainable things I’ve seen in the few weeks working here.

I’m David, and today in particular has been so weird that I’ve been reflecting quite a bit, thinking about how I got myself into this situation. I graduated at the age of twenty-one with a bachelor’s in marine science. The city was too expensive to stay in, so I drove back home. Applying for jobs left and right until this one came up. I had an introductory first day on site, far out of the way on a lone dirt road nearly indistinguishable from the red earth. The site is composed of two primary farms, each with their own sets of dams with floating cages, all of which housing cod. A large office building attached to a warehouse acts as the focal point, as all the ponds encircle it in a ring-like formation.

My introductory interview started off with me overhearing a conversation between the site manager, and two of my coworkers as they were being reprimanded behind the heavy closed office doors. I could only faintly make out what was being said.

“Look, either cut the shit, or I’m cutting both of your hours.”

“C’mon, she started it!” a young, slightly nasally voice replied.

“Grow up.” a deep, feminine voice expressed.

“Enough! Now out, both of you. I have a meeting soon…”

After a moment of silence, a pair that couldn’t be more polar walked out the door. A shorter, somewhat dishevelled guy and a taller, callous looking girl exited the office. The guy giving me a look that expressed an insurmountable fatigue, who’s name I’d later find out was Jacob. The girl shot me a judgemental look before it turned into confusion, who’s name was Sarah. Both of them walking down separate corridors before a larger, older man greeted me from the doorway. Undeniably the man in charge, Arthur Bennet.

I’ll spare the excessive detail of the interview, but he laid out a lot of the tasks I would be assigned to that I’ll be bringing up later. That being cage maintenance, water quality and health checks, restocking, and disposal. He emphasised the importance of each task with a deep, guttural and authoritative tone.

Cage Maintenance: Feed the fish the right feed, clean cages when possible. Pull out dead fish if they are present.

Water Quality: Collect water samples from each dam to ensure water is safe for fish. Treat all samples back in the laboratory. Report any strange readings.

Health Checks: Harvest gill and mucous samples from fish to look at in the laboratory under a microscope. Check for bacterial infections, parasites or *unidentifiable* organisms.

Restocking: Fill automatic feeders, fill feed bins using fish food located in The Shed.

Disposal: Clean bins, take out trash. Empty all mortality buckets into the waste tubs out back.

After conducting the interview, he took me around in one of the company vehicles to one of the many dams I’d be working on every day. Each body of water was roughly square-shaped, housing a large, floating cage. An island of metal that trapped hundreds of fish within layers upon layers of netting. Each one a labyrinth divided by water, nets and walkways that bob on the water’s surface. It was there I first noticed one of the many strange things that were in store for me.

“We like to call it Double Fish Syndrome,” he said, going off a tangent of fish death and odd behaviour. “They sometimes swallow the younger fish hole, end up dying with them in their mouths. The fish can be cannibalistic, you see.” We walked on the floating walkways under the suns glare as he pointed to one such case. A fish floating on the surface with the tail of another sticking out of its’ mouth. A victim of hunger. However, what was floating not far from it that really caught my attention.

Swimming just below the surface, singled out to be cleansed by the scornful stare of the scorching sun, was a true double ended fish. There was no head between the two of them, as it seemed that they were conjoined at the tail from birth, two heads on a single body. Endlessly pulling away from each other, but if torn apart they would perish. I chalked it up as a reminder of the cruelty of nature.

“If you see any suffering, best to just put them out of their misery…” Arthur said coldly, grabbing a net and scooping out the double ended fish from the water. He raised his girthy arms high before slamming the fish onto the scolding metal with force. A loud thud and a distinct, wet crack as one head twitched before laying limp. The other head weakly twitching as it gasped in the hot, dry air before perishing with its mouths agape. I stand there stunned by the display before my own parched lips moved.

“How often do you see fish like that?” I asked quietly, he gave me a sombre look, eyebags sagging beneath his solemn stare as he spoke with a tired tone.

“You’ll get used to it kid…” with that, my tour was over. I was given a roster that alternated between two weeks, a uniform and a complimentary hat. I’ve been here for almost a month now, and I’ve begun connecting with my coworkers. They range from helpful but worrisome, snarky but efficient to reputable conspiracists. My first couple weeks were spent with Sarah. At the moment, I don’t have too much to say on her, other than she absolutely despises Jacob.

Sarah and Jacob have a rivalry that tip-toes between petty and overly vindictive. My first interaction with her was rather tame, as she rather unenthusiastically explained the ins and outs of water quality checks, gathering samples from fish and testing samples with some of the equipment in the ‘laboratory’, though that is giving the room far too much credit. The room is more of a glorified kitchen, a stark contrast to the heavily sanitised and sterile workspaces I was accustomed to while studying. Flys buzz above the dirty counters, as the fluorescent lights hummed loudly amidst the whirring of computers and photometers.

“He just doesn’t understand boundaries-“ she’d sigh and exposit as I diluted one of many water samples. “Like one time he smacked my back, like really hard. Completely uncalled for, mind you. Another time, my shirt was drenched in water, and he asked me if I was ‘leaking milk’, like what the fuck, right?”

“That is pretty weird…” I replied, not focusing too much on the conversation as I readied the samples for testing. “I haven’t worked with him yet, since I’m still new.”

“Trust me, you’ll understand where I’m coming from when you do.” She said assuredly. The only other times she spoke to me was if I made a mistake in the rounding of values from readings, or if my values were different from ones she has done in the past. Each comment possessed a somewhat condescending tone that whittled me down bit by bit. After a few weeks, I spoke to Arthur requesting if I could help out around the farm more. That was when I decided to do a mix of farm labour and lab work. Mainly so that I can get a break from her, I never expected that decision alone to lead me to meeting a man who has shifted my work from monotonous research to eerie investigation.

My interaction with a certain individual today is the reason why I’m writing this at all, sitting in the break room today was a much older, scraggly man sermonising to still unfamiliar faces. The room has been pretty empty before, but today a couple older workers sat drinking coffee as one stood out amongst the rest, speaking of cryptids in a somewhat forced country accent.

“I’m telling ya! it’s the Bunyips that are causing the ponds to crash. The evidence is right outside!” He spoke with his hands, exaggerating every word and action through a display that certainly wasn’t dull. Everyone there had this look that told me he’s done this countless times before. He looked up to see me, smiling widely as a crooked grim formed on his tanned face.

“G’day there, you the new guy?” He walked up to greet me, shaking my hand in a vice-like grip. His skin felt like sun-soaked leather.

“The name’s Robert, but you can call me Rob.”

“David, nice to meet you Rob-“ I replied, as the others in the room took the chance to quickly leave while he was occupied with me.

“Arty said I’d be looking after ya while you’re still learning. I still got some smoko left, but I might as well get you started.” With that he led me to his own personal work vehicle, a battered and worn blue triton contrasting against the homogenous array of white, modern utes. The machine roared as he ignited the engine.

“Modified her myself, had her for a good long while-“ his tone changed, gone was the crazy bogan, and emerged a compelling demeanour., he talked about some of the roles he has on site and some of the folklore of the area. The latter he seemed to take great pride in regaling to me. Topics ranged from ghost stories, encounters with the supernatural, and of course, cryptids.

“Apparently, the Bunyip’s been described to have inhabited the area for as long as there were people on the continent. The Aboriginals described it as this water spirit; sightings have been spotty though. It was mostly used by them to teach children on the dangers of the water.”

“So, you believe there is one out here?” I asked, as a confident grin showing his yellow stained teeth told emerged.

“Not only do I believe, but I also know you’ll witness it soon enough. I’ve been here long enough and have seen enough to know there’s something strange about this place.” He stopped in front of The Shed. Located on the outermost portion of the property. It resides next to the road with wide gravel paths. Large roller doors open loudly revealing pallets of fish food stacked high on one another, along with spare parts for machines, boxes of varying sizes and an old, well-worn forklift. He moved some old pallets, revealing a pristine blue door hidden in the far-right corner. I was hesitant at first, though he didn’t try to coax me inside. Instead, he stepped inside, as he rattled about looking for something, the sounds of metal and glass clanging together before they stopped. He stepped outside carrying a large jar, the liquid a sickly yellow as something bobbed around inside.

“Now, I don’t just show this to anyone, and I don’t do anything for free. So, I want to make a deal with you first.” He hid the jar behind a pallet, his mood shifting as the conversation turned serious.

“Arty told me you already saw one of the irregulars. Said you got pretty spooked by it too-” He chortled, before a cough emerged that took over him violently. He gagged and spat onto the floor, the gunk speckled with dark flakes. He cleared his throat before continuing

“Sorry about that, anyways, Arty said you were the scientific type, and if you can believe it, so am I. All I ask is that if you see anything abnormal, whether it’s a fish, something in the water or what have you, that you bring it to me to study. I’ve *almost* got enough evidence to prove that something is going on out here. In exchange, I’ll grab you something from the servo for every sample you get me. Free of charge, of course.” He reaches out his hand for another shake, this one felt like I was being asked of something much larger than myself. The weight of it was palpable. I thought about it for a moment, before reaching out to reciprocate once more.

“Alright, but I want to see what exactly you’re doing in there.” I pointed to the door, his response took a moment, as I could see the cogs turn inside his head as he planned on what to say.

“I will, but at a later time. I’ve got some conditions as well-“ he let go of my hand as he picked up the jar. It’s contents obscured by the lack of light in the corner of The Shed.

“Firstly, this just stays between us. This is a personal interest of mine, and I would rather it stays between us. Secondly, if you ask for cigs from the servo, I won’t buy them for you. Won’t let you fuck up your lungs like I have. Lastly, if you choose to back out, then we just pretend that nothing ever happened. Sound good?”

“Yeah, I understand.” I lied.

“Good, now, take a look at this.” He motioned to the jar in his hand. Up close, I could faintly make out the familiar smell of Ethanol. He pulled out a small flashlight that he used to illuminate and reveal the contents of the jar. I instinctively recoiled as the sight of it horrified me.

“Is that a human hand?!” to which he all too casually replied with-

“Yeah, it’s my hand. A copy of it actually, look here-” he pointed to a spot that I looked away from at first, still in shock from the sight. Morbid curiosity made me look at where he was pointing, where my horror turned to confusion and apprehension. On closer inspection, something looked off about the appendage. The colour of the flesh and skin were off, bone and tendons from the wrist seemed to connect to the exposed cartilage and flesh of a cod that seemed to grow out from the palm. Where Rob was pointing, I could see that the hand seemed to possess and extra digit sprouting from the thumb, to which he revealed a scar on the same area on his own hand.

“I was born with an extra thumb, doctors cut it off and fixed me up when I was about a year old. I fell into one of the ponds ages ago, the bank collapsed under me as I was clearing some of the weeds. When I was out there doing my usual routine, I found this floating in one of the cages.”

 I became flummoxed. The sudden surge of information giving me a throbbing headache as I sat down on one of the nearby pallets. Rob used the moment to put the jar back inside the hidden room and lock the door, moving the pallets back over it and sitting beside me.

“I reacted the same way when I found it, that was in my first three months of working here. Since then, I’ve been finding lots of strange things that I’ve been saving. There’s something more going on here, and I’m close to finding out what it is-“ he was interrupted by a light buzzing from his pocket, as he pulled out an old phone. His voice changing back into the bogan accent I heard when I first met him.

“Hey mate… nah, yeah, I’m just showing him how to restock at the moment… alright we’ll be back soon, see ya mate.” He hung up the phone and stood up.

“Arty said you can head home after finishing some of your water tests back at the lab. I’ll drive you back after I clean up here.” I got up to leave, heading out to hop in Rob’s triton before he tapped my shoulder. He held an old radio in his hand; its’ screen glowing a dim green.

“Take this before you go, use it to contact me if you see or hear anything.” After that, we talked very little on the way back to the office. He spoke mostly about restocking, filling me on details of what stock to take on certain days, waving me goodbye as he dropped me off and went about the rest of his day.

I have a lot more to talk about, but my break is almost over and Jacob needs to show me how to maintain some of the cages and nets. I’m sure I will have plenty more to talk about after these next couple of weeks. Got some early starts coming up, farm labour starts as soon as the sun rises, which is around 6:00am. I’ll update this when I get the chance.  ",2,1771746777.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False
1rbfy3t,https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/1rbfy3t/is_it_obligatory_to_forgive_abuser_and_keep_ties/,is it obligatory to forgive abuser and keep ties? Any advice is appreciated. JazakAllah Khair.,"I dislike talking about abuse to our ummah because I've noted alhamdulillah many of you grew up in good families so it is hard for you all to understand where I'm coming from. 

My dad was abusive, so what that means is that I grew up in a home where we witnessed each other getting slapped, kicked, and spat on. It is not a good feeling to have a grown man slap you with a grown hand, but it is an even worse feeling to watch a man beat your mother with his shoe. Belts, hangers, and metal weapons were also used. Occasionally fire. Chairs and plates would go flying around. After all of this, it was difficult to hear him demand my mother for sexual favors and stuff. At least a dozen times he smashed his cup (filled with hot coffee) on the table because it didn't have enough sugar in it. There would be glass everywhere, sometimes in our skin. It left marks on our body. We took many trips to the hospitals for x-rays, stitches, and arm casts. The abuse was due to things like scratching our noses while eating, spilling water, forgetting to close the light, accidentally making too much plate noises while doing dishes, biting nails, talking too loudly, or if we stared at him, etc. He also threatened us with strange statements like ""I'll bury you alive in the backyard"" or ""I'm going to stab both your eyes with this pen."" He accused my mother of disgusting acts and accused my siblings of incest. Every day we would wake up in fear wondering when he would explode, in what manner, and over what silly reason. It is a deep, pit-in-the-stomach type of fear. The heart almost leaps to the mouth. When we were younger, we would be in such fear, we would pee ourselves in our pants. 

From time to time, he asked for forgiveness. We always forgave him. But then the abuse would continue the next day. The cycle would continue like this for years.

I am now 20 years old. The neighbors called the cops last year and the abuse has tremendously decreased, Alhamdulillah. Currently, he is verbally abusive. He threatens to be physically abusive, but we are not afraid (he has gotten old and we are collectively more stronger than him now). It's hard for me to forget the past. Is it required for me to forgive him in Islam? And is it required for me to keep ties with him? Im thinking of moving out and cutting contact.",2,1771746731.0,islam,1,1.0,False

I felt so bloated and a quick Google search said I could take Diurex. The box said it helps with bloating from your period. Says to take 2 pills twice a day. I got the caffeine free one because I know the caffeine in coffee upsets my stomach.

  
Wanted to be careful because I've not taken this before so I only took one pill in the morning for 2 days. Since day 2, I've had diarrhea. Been going on for 4 days. Every time I eat, I need to go to the bathroom.

  
I'm reading that diarrhea can be a side effect of Diurex, but I'm wondering if anyone knows when it should stop because I've not taken it in 3 days. Or should i go to the doctor? It's embarrassing.

One perched right next to the empty plate. The other stood guard near the coffee like it was supervising the whole operation. No fear. No hesitation. Just pure “this is our café now” energy.

They didn’t swoop. Didn’t panic. Just calmly assessed the leftovers and waited for an opportunity. Down under wildlife really does not believe in personal space.

I have to admit, it made breakfast way more entertaining.

Anyone else had magpies casually join their meal like this?

# How to Choose the Right Kitchen Appliance

Before buying, consider these factors:

# 📏 Size & Counter Space

Make sure the appliance fits your kitchen layout without crowding your counters.

# 🔌 Power & Features

Look for:

No hype, no get-rich-quick schemes, just a solid workflow for small-scale freelance content.

Here’s the breakdown:

*   **The Goal:** Provide social media content (graphics + short captions/scripts) for local small businesses. Think dentists, local cafes, real estate agents.
*   **My Tools:**
    *   **ChatGPT-4:** For ideation, drafting captions, short scripts, and headline variations. Cost: $20/month.
    *   **Canva Pro:** For creating visually appealing graphics, sourcing stock photos, and using templates. Cost: $12.99/month.
*   **The Workflow (avg. 5 hrs/week):**
    1.  **Client Briefing (0.5 hr/week):** Quick chats/emails to understand client needs for the week.
    2.  **ChatGPT Content Generation (2.5 hrs/week):**
        *   Prompting ChatGPT for 10-15 post ideas relevant to the client.
        *   Generating 2-3 caption variations for each idea. *Example: ""Generate 3 engaging captions for a local coffee shop's Instagram post announcing a new seasonal latte. Focus on taste, warmth, and community.""*
        *   Refining output, checking for tone and accuracy.
    3.  **Canva Graphic Creation (1.5 hrs/week):**
        *   Using Canva's templates and stock library to create eye-catching graphics for each approved caption.
        *   Ensuring brand consistency (colors, fonts, logos).
    4.  **Review & Delivery (0.5 hr/week):** Final check, scheduling posts via client's preferred tool, or delivering assets.
*   **Output Quality:** Good enough for small businesses that just need a consistent online presence. It's not agency-level, but it's reliable and professional-looking. I currently handle content for 3 small businesses.

**Real Talk & Limitations:**
*   **It's not passive:** You still need to manage clients, get feedback, and make revisions.
*   **Learning Curve:** Getting good prompts for ChatGPT takes time. Mastering Canva's features also has a slight learning curve initially.
*   **Human Touch Needed:** ChatGPT can be generic. I always review and tweak captions to ensure they sound natural and resonate with the client's brand voice. Canva's AI design features are helpful but don't replace human aesthetic judgment.
*   **Client Acquisition:** This workflow focuses on delivery, not finding clients. That's a separate hustle!

He said he wants to go for therapy and that after he’s made progress we could go for coffee or something. In his mind we can stay friends but I don’t want that. He’s not the person I thought he was and talking to him makes me spiral even more.

It’s been 2 months now. He’s attending therapy and I know he’ll reach out any day to meet up. I don’t know if it’s worth having a closure conversation now. I’ve made such good progress with my healing and I worry about ruining it by seeing him. But at the same time I love him and want to see him again but know he’s not the same person anymore.

Hello Everyone!

My name is M and I recently turned 20 like 2 weeks ago. I am currently in community college studying general biology. I have never really been great at making friends and I did not know why until recently (got diagnosed/getting evaluated). It sucks in all honesty and I am tired of feeling so isolated. I had like 4 friends in high school but they moved away to pretty far universities. Since I am in community college, everyone is a commuter and most people are not super interested in making long term friends. Couple that with Autism and ADHD and it is a recipe for disaster. I have tried clubs, programs, all sorts of stuff but I just can't seem to pick up on socialising much. Anyways, I hope we can be friends here or something. It would be nice to have some long term, good people in my life. 

More About Me:

I have a TON of random hobbies and I love to keep myself busy. I like to draw, watch youtube (more on that later), hike, bake/cook, research random things, thrift, collect cds, listen to all sorts of music, make jewellery, play guitar, read, write songs and poems, collect shells/rocks/bones, learn about beetles, watch anime (not a lot but some), go to the gym, volunteer, and ocassionally play videogames.

Some of my general interests include smiling friends, lolcows, obesity medicine/the fat acceptance movement/the rising obesity rate, random parts of history, music of all kinds, beetles, gorillas, animals in general, minecraft, esoteric memes/general brainrot humor, cats, clowns, 2000-2006 honda crvs (i like the table and I want to buy one), nature/hiking/camping, and theology. 

  
Some things I wanna get into are rock climbing, skateboarding, oil painting, short story writing, no contact kickboxing, sewing, making fancy coffee drink things, backpacking, photography, and making mead.

My favourite Stuff: 

My favourite band right now is Modern Baseball, My favourite food are Pupuas, My favourite youtube channel is Kiwitapes, My favourite genre of music is Metal (doesnt match the band ik), My favourite animal is a gorilla, My favourite drink is lemonade. My favourite thing to do in my free time is to do something creative like draw. 

  
Disclaimers. 

I tend to be kinda repetitive in many ways. For example, I like to watch Kiwitapes every day and I watch his Amberlynn Ried Video almost every day, sometimes twice a day. I only really like to watch certain channels and I am not good at taking reccomendations for youtube channels and movies. I tend to repeat stories or taking points a few times or listen to the same song for 4 days. I also change the subject a ton or keep redirecting about what I was saying if something got changed. I will try to not be annoying I swear. I also sometimes come off as blunt, too honest, or innatentive but I am not trying to be mean. Sometimes I am not super responsive because I am side tracked or busy with school but I will most likely respond within a couple of hours.

1rbfm11,https://i.redd.it/c9c2reny00lg1.jpeg,I own both a Gaggimate Pro Gaggia Classic and a Lelit Bianca – here's what surprised me,"I'm currently putting together a video comparing these two machines side by side on my channel ([CoffeeXris on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@CoffeeXris?subscribe=1)). Before I finish it, I wanted to share some of my notes here and hear what you'd want me to cover. Things I'm maybe not thinking of, aspects you'd find useful, stuff you disagree with.

I've been using a Lelit Bianca V3 for a while now and recently modded a Gaggia Classic with the Gaggimate Pro. I expected the Bianca to win in every category – it costs 3x as much. Turns out it's not that simple.

The things nobody talks about:

The Gaggimate actually has an advantage when it comes to temperature changes mid-shot. The small single boiler has less thermal mass, so it reacts faster. The Bianca is more stable overall, sure – but if you want to do something like a declining temperature profile, the Gaggia responds quicker. That one surprised me.

Pressure profiling feels completely different on both machines. The Bianca's needle valve gives you direct, analog control. You feel the resistance, you watch the flow, you adjust in real time. It's almost meditative. The Gaggimate is the opposite: you design a profile on the web interface, hit brew, and the machine executes it. Neither is better, but they attract very different people.

Here's a weird one: the Gaggimate gets software updates. Sounds obvious for a smart device, but think about it. Your espresso machine gets better over time. The Bianca is a finished product. Theoretically it could also get updates via the LLC but so far Lelit did not do that and to upgrade the you probably need to replace the LLC module. Great out of the box, but what you buy is what you get. The Gaggimate community keeps pushing features that didn't exist 6 months ago.

Where the Bianca still wins clearly:

Steam power: not even close. If you make milk drinks daily, for multiple people, the dual boiler setup is a different league. The Gaggia can steam well, but it's a compromise.

Build quality and longevity. E61 group, massive brass components, rotary pump – this thing is built to last decades with basic maintenance. The Gaggimate is clever engineering on top of a budget machine. (Not to say the Gaggia will break faster, I am using mine since 5 years with no problems so far).

Accessories. The E61 ecosystem is huge – bottomless portafilters, flow control devices, shower screens, you name it. Gaggia accessories exist but it's a smaller world.

And honestly – the Bianca just looks stunning on the counter. The wood accents, the E61 chrome, the whole presence. That matters to some people and I get it.

Where the Gaggimate surprises:

Price obviously: \~600€ total vs \~1800€ for the Bianca. That's a good grinder upgrade worth of difference.

Heat-up time. 10-15 minutes vs 20-25 minutes. If you're the ""I want coffee NOW"" type, that adds up over weeks and months.

Consistency for lazy mornings. Pick a profile, press the button, walk away. The Bianca demands your attention for every shot, at least in terms of stopping the lever manually.

Size. If you're working with a small kitchen, the Gaggia's footprint is significantly smaller.

Power consumption is lower too – single boiler, less thermal mass, quicker on/off cycles.

Maintenance is actually interesting. The E61 group needs regular lubrication, and backflushing is a manual process. The Gaggimate has automated backflush cycles built into the software. Not a dealbreaker on either side, but a nice quality-of-life thing.

Things that could go either way:

Noise is different rather than better or worse. The Gaggia's vibration pump has that typical higher-pitched buzz, the Bianca's rotary pump is deeper and more even. In practice the grinder drowns out both anyway.

Resale value favors the Bianca. It holds its price well on the used market. A modded Gaggia is harder to sell because the buyer needs to be comfortable with the mod. But flip side: if the Gaggimate board ever dies, you still have a fully functional Gaggia Classic underneath.

The Bianca can be plumbed in, the Gaggia can't. For some setups that matters a lot.

Upgradeability is a funny one. The Bianca is kind of endgame for most home baristas – you're not itching to replace it. The Gaggimate might leave you wondering ""what's next"" at some point. But then again, its software capabilities actually exceed what many machines at 2-3x the price can do. So where exactly would you upgrade to?

My honest take:

If someone asked me ""which makes better espresso?"" – I'd say they're closer than the price gap suggests. Same beans, same grinder, same recipe – the shots are surprisingly similar. The Gaggimate punches way above its weight for straight espresso.

But espresso machines aren't just about the shot in the cup. They're about workflow, ritual, aesthetics, milk drinks, and how much you enjoy the process. The Bianca is for people who want the manual craft experience and make milk drinks regularly. The Gaggimate is for tinkerers who love data and want maximum control per euro spent.

I’d appreciate honest feedback from those who train regularly:

• Would you consider a chewable caffeine option before or during a workout?  
• Would you choose this over kopi, canned coffee, or pre-workout powder?

I remember thinking the night before the trip, how do we get there without getting lost on some random forest road?

If you’re planning a trip around Virajpet, here’s the real version of the routes.

We drove from Bangalore. We left at 6:30 AM, and that really helped us.

The route was Bangalore to Mysore to Hunsur to Gonikoppal to Virajpet. It’s roughly 280 km. The drive took us just over 6 hours, including one long breakfast stop.

The drive from Bangalore to Mysore is easy with a smooth highway. After Hunsur, the roads start to bend. It’s not scary, just slower and more scenic. We stopped in Mysore for dosa and filter coffee, and I’m glad we did because once you enter Coorg, you don't feel like rushing anymore.

After Gonikoppal, everything turns greener. There are fewer vehicles and cooler air. It slowly starts to feel like you are leaving the noise behind.

The place we stayed was about 10 km inside from Virajpet town. The last few kilometers were on estate roads that were narrow, surrounded by coffee plants, and very quiet. The property sent detailed directions after booking, which helped more than Google Maps, honestly. Google tried suggesting some strange shortcuts.

From Mysore, it’s about 95 to 100 km. This takes around 2.5 hours. It’s the same route, minus the Bangalore stretch. This is the easiest option. If someone is flying into Bangalore, I would actually suggest breaking the journey at Mysore and driving fresh the next morning.

From Mangalore, it’s about 150 km and takes 3.5 to 4 hours. The route is Mangalore to Sullia to Virajpet. This drive is beautiful but has many curves. You climb from the coast into the hills, with dense forest stretches and sudden mist patches. If you get motion sickness, be prepared.

A few things I wish someone had told me: Start early, especially from Bangalore. Add at least 30 to 45 extra minutes to whatever Maps shows. Follow the property’s directions instead of Google’s back routes. If hill driving makes you anxious, just hire a driver.

By the time we reached deep inside the estate, it didn’t feel like a typical “resort entry.” There was no big flashy gate, just greenery, silence, and that earthy coffee smell. It felt secluded in a good way.

The property was called INIKA if you’re curious. It’s one of those places you don’t hear about much; you kind of discover it.

If you’re planning to visit Virajpet instead of the usual Madikeri route and feel confused, this is exactly how we did it. Simple. No drama. Just a long drive that slowly becomes beautiful.",1,1771744790.0,mysore,1,1.0,False

[Image: The Place](https://i.imgur.com/3XKM8ft.png)

**Part 15: Our Date Night 2 – Sayori and MC (MC)**

The Italian restaurant called “The Place” was in one of the lower basement floors of Legacy Tower in a food hall near the subway station. Its floors were tiled to resemble cobblestone streets, and one of the walls featured a large map of Italy. In the center of the restaurant sat what appeared to be a small olive tree, enhancing the natural look of the space. Smells of freshly made pizza and marinara sauce filled the restaurant. As he and Sayori were led to their table, MC couldn’t help but admire her from behind.

*She looks absolutely stunning in that dress. It’s perfect on her. And a perfect view for me. Hopefully this is the beginning of a perfect night.*

They were seated at a table in a corner of the restaurant, and menus and glasses of water were placed in front of them.

Sayori looked around. “Good choice, MC. I like the vibe here. Hopefully the food is just as good.”

MC grinned. “I’m glad you approve. Let’s see what’s good on the menu. To be honest, I’m not very familiar with Italian food but I did some reading online and it sounded good. This place also has great reviews.”

Sayori nodded. “Me either. But it smells spectacular in here and I saw a few pasta dishes go by that looked very tasty, so I think I’m going to get a pasta dish tonight.”

MC looked over the menu. “Nice. I’m thinking probably a meat dish. Maybe the chicken parmesan. But I’m not entirely sure yet. I’ll have to make a game time decision.”

Sayori looked up from her menu with a smile. “This is really real, right? After all this time, after all that we’ve been through, we’re finally going on a real date.”

She looked away, a wistful expression coming onto her face. “All that time…I never could have dreamed of anything like this. And now look at us. All dressed up and sitting at a table in an Italian restaurant…”

MC looked contemplative. “School and the literature club were pretty much our entire world. But we didn’t know that there was anything more than that at the time.”

“It’s true…we really led strange lives up until a few days ago,” Sayori continued, “Though we should be careful how much we talk about that in public like this.”

“Yeah, good point,” MC agreed, “Let’s focus on the menu for now so we can decide what to eat.”

After another minute of studying the menu a waiter appeared to take their orders.

“Good evening, and welcome to The Place,” he began, “Are we celebrating anything special today?”

MC and Sayori looked at each other as if unsure how to answer the question. MC studied Sayori’s face as if he would find the answer in her expression.

*I don’t want to make tonight seem trivial, but does she want me to keep it more low key?*

“Date night,” he explained, “We both just moved here this week and this is our first chance to have a nice evening out.”

The waiter smiled. “It’s nice to see a couple still dressing up for each other. Well, can I start you off with anything to drink or an appetizer?”

MC saw Sayori’s expression flicker at the waiter’s comment. *Was that a hint of a grin that just crossed her face?*

Sayori reached across the table and took MC’s hand. “It feels like we’ve been together forever.”

“Definitely something to drink,” MC said, “What do you feel like, Sayori? Wine, a cocktail…?”

Sayori glanced at the drink menu. “Maybe a nice glass of wine? This wine list is really long.”

She turned to the waiter. “What would you suggest?”

“That will depend on what you’re having to eat,” the waiter explained, “If you’re going to go with something with a tomato sauce or our lasagna I’d recommend pairing it with our Chianti. Or if you want something else I can make a recommendation based on the dish you pick.”

“In that case, I’ll have the lasagna and a glass of Chianti, please,” Sayori decided.

The waiter jotted down her order and turned to MC. “And for you?”

“I’ll have the chicken parmesan, please, and a glass of the Chianti as well,” MC replied, “Actually, let’s just get a bottle of Chianti to share.”

The waiter wrote down the orders, confirmed them, and left to give them to the kitchen.

MC looked at Sayori, who had an expression of pure contentment on her face and was clearly enjoying herself.

*Should I bring up her little grin when the waiter made that comment? Or would I risk ruining the mood?*

He decided to ask her about it. “Was it just me, or did I see a hint of a smile cross your face when the waiter complimented us for dressing up for each other?”

Sayori’s expression became a full grin. “Yeah, it was. It made me think about how far you’ve come since I first convinced you to join the literature club. That MC’s idea of a date would have been ordering a pizza and watching anime at home.”

MC gave her a look of exaggerated indignation. “What’s so wrong with that?”

Sayori’s face showed amusement. “Nothing, unless you actually want to impress a girl. Which you have done very well so far tonight, I must say.”

Her expression and tone shifted and became more serious. “But that comment he made also made me think about something I wanted to talk to you about tonight.”

MC’s expression briefly flipped between surprise and concern before he was able to smooth it out to neutral

*Uh oh. Is something wrong?*

“MC, how long would you say we’ve been going out?”

MC thought for a moment. “Umm…well…that’s a good question honestly. This is kind of our first real date.”

Sayori continued to sit forward in her chair but said nothing. She almost looked as if she was waiting for him to say more.

MC paused, waiting to see if Sayori would respond. *Was that not the right answer?*

“I mean…technically if we go off of…before, we’ve been going out since high school.”

Sayori sat back in her chair, seemingly satisfied.

“It’s like the ideal love story,” she said, counting off the points on the fingers of her right hand, “Childhood friends, high school sweethearts, and now in a committed relationship as adults.”

MC nodded. “I suppose it is. I can’t imagine many people are able to say that their childhood friend is their lover as an adult. I guess we’re lucky that way.”

Sayori smiled. “Exactly! And look, I’m not trying to ruin the mood by bringing up serious topics, but I want to make sure we’re on the same page in this relationship. We don’t need to have all our long-term relationship goals figured out tonight but before we get too caught up in the moment, I just wanted to talk about it.”

“Probably a good idea to talk about it before we get a bit tipsy as well,” MC agreed as the waiter brought the bottle of wine they had ordered along with two glasses.

The wine bottle was a traditional Tuscan design, with a wide base encased in a straw basket. The waiter opened it and after MC politely declined to taste it before pouring a full glass, the waiter filled both glasses. The wine was rich and deep red, almost matching Sayori’s dress.

MC raised his glass in a toast and Sayori did the same. “Here’s to the perfect love story.”

“Let’s be together forever,” Sayori added, touching her glass to his, “We’re never gonna be apart.”

Now it was MC’s turn to feel his expression flicker. The last time he had heard those words from Sayori, she had been in a manic and obsessive state due to issues with the simulation. He understood where it had come from then, but to hear it from her again now surprised him.

*A little possessive, aren’t you, Sayori? Not that I dislike it…just not what I expected from my childhood friend. But she’s a grown adult now, and so am I.*

He took a sip from his glass to mask the fact that Sayori’s toast had left him momentarily speechless. The chianti was relatively dry but smooth, with a lovely flavor.

“This is really nice,” he observed, picking up the bottle and studying the label, “I’ll need to get a bottle at the supermarket to keep on hand at home.”

“I like that idea,” Sayori said supportively, “Maybe for date night one of these weeks we could stay in and make dinner. Just you, me, and a nice bottle of wine.”

MC arched an eyebrow at Sayori and smiled. “Sounds like a plan.”

He paused for a moment, gathering his thoughts. *There’s really so much I want to say. I almost…no, I did lose her once. I handled her confession badly, and while I don’t know whether that contributed to what she did I still blame myself for not being there when she needed support.*

“The other night, Yuri talked about how we were all given a fresh start when we…moved here. And I think that goes for our relationship as well.”

Sayori sat back in her chair, looking pensive but remaining silent for the moment.

“And what I mean by that,” MC continued, “Is that this time we have a chance to do it right. When we first got together in high school, it wasn’t a good start. You had all but dragged me to the literature club, and after you confessed to me and shared your…mental health challenges I handled it like the high school idiot I was and said a bunch of stupid stuff about knowing what was best for you when I had no idea what I was doing.”

Sayori narrowed her eyes. “So…you admit you were a dumb NEET before I dragged you to the literature club.”

MC chuckled, appreciating Sayori’s moment of levity. “Yeah, I kinda was.”

“I think I understand what you mean, though,” Sayori continued, “While you did accept my confession, we never really got our romantic relationship started in high school. Partly because of my…you know.”

MC cringed. *Oh no. We’re on a date and I just made Sayori think about the worst moment of her life.*

“Sayori…I’m sorry…I didn’t mean to…”

Sayori shook her head. “It’s okay, MC. I still don’t like to think about it, but…I’m realizing that in addition to forgiving Monika, I also have to forgive myself. My feelings of worthlessness were there before Monika did what she did. They still happen from time to time. But I’m going to get some help from the medical center. I made an appointment to see a therapist next week.”

“Seeing a professional is a good idea,” MC agreed, “And do you feel like the conversation you had with Monika and Yuri this morning helped?”

Sayori nodded. “It did. It felt good to be able to let our feelings out to each other…like a weight was lifted off us.”

A smile came over her face. “So I guess in the end we can say that we’ve been together since high school, but that now we’re getting really serious. Sound good?”

MC returned her smile and held up his glass in a toast. “Sounds good.”

*Her smile really lights up the room. I’ll never forget how I felt when she was…gone, but I’m so thankful we’re here now.*

They touched their glasses together again and took sips of the smooth Chianti as the waiter arrived with their entrees.

Sayori’s eyes widened when she saw the large plate of lasagna that was set before her.

“Oh…this looks and smells so good!”

She proceeded to cut a small piece and brought her fork up to her mouth.

“Ow! Hot!”

MC shook his head as he looked approvingly at the chicken parmesan and noodles on his own plate.

“Of course it’s hot, silly…it just came out of the kitchen.”

Sayori reached for her glass of water and took a huge gulp to try to cool her tongue.

“But I couldn’t resist!”

After the food had cooled for a few minutes, conversation slowed to a trickle as MC and Sayori began to eat their meals. MC sliced a bite-size piece of his chicken parmesan, then put his fork down to take a sip from his glass of wine. When he glanced back at his plate to pick up the bite, he found it had mysteriously disappeared. He looked up to see his girlfriend looking satisfied.

“It looked so good. I had to try a bite,” she explained with a grin.

MC chuckled again. “Okay. Well, that means you owe me a bite of lasagna now.”

Sayori picked up a piece of lasagna noodle with her fork and held it up to feed it to MC.

“Oh, yeah,” MC said after he had swallowed the noodle, “That’s excellent. I may have to order that the next time we come here.”

*Hopefully Friday night date night becomes a weekly thing for us.*

As if she had read his mind, Sayori offered a suggestion similar to his thought.

“So, should we make this a regular event?”

MC nodded. “I think so. We should make time to spend together every week. Work will keep us busy, but we should always have some time for just us.”

“So you’d choose date night over manga time?” Sayori asked.

MC frowned. *Where did that question come from?*

“Of course,” he said definitively, “You’re my girlfriend. You’re my priority.”

Sayori nodded but didn’t reply.

“We should still maintain our hobbies too though,” MC continued, “That will help make sure we never get bored in our relationship.”

“Why would we ever get bored of each other?” Sayori asked, sounding concerned, “We can’t let that happen.”

“We won’t,” MC reassured her, “I’m sure we’ll be fine. We’ve got a great group of friends that we can spend time with as well.”

*We don’t need to spend every moment together, and it’s actually probably healthier for our relationship if we do have our own hobbies and other things we do sometimes.*

A smile returned to Sayori’s face. “Yeah, we really do. And hopefully we’ll have more friends soon when the members of the Music Club get here!”

MC nodded. “That’s part of why I’m flying out on Sunday. Hopefully I’ll be returning here with them.”

“That would be the perfect Christmas present for all of us,” Sayori said hopefully, “More friends and family.”

“It definitely would be,” MC agreed.

They continued to eat their meals over the next half hour, smiling, laughing, and enjoying each other’s company. Eventually the plates were finished and the last of the bottle of wine was emptied into Sayori’s glass.

Sayori sighed contentedly, her cheeks slightly flushed from the alcohol. “Well, MC, you definitely made a great pick choosing this restaurant. That was definitely one of the best meals I’ve had, and this wine was perfect with it. I’m so full from that lasagna.”

MC smiled. “I’m glad you enjoyed it. This has been a great evening.”

The waiter returned to clear their dishes.

“Can I interest either of you in any coffee, dessert, or some after dinner limoncello?”

Sayori’s eyes lit up at the mention of dessert.

“Limoncello?” MC asked.

“It’s an Italian lemon liquer,” the waiter explained, “We serve it chilled and it’s great for sipping on after a meal.”

MC looked to Sayori. “Want to try it?”

Sayori nodded. “Let’s look at the dessert menu too.”

MC asked the waiter for two glasses of limoncello and the dessert menu. After the waiter had left to fill their order he turned back to Sayori.

“Do you want to have dessert here? I was originally thinking we could go up to the fourth floor to the ice cream shop there, but if you want to stay here I’m cool with that too.”

Sayori considered. “Yeah, let’s stay here. I like it here and with how good the food was I’m sure dessert will be great too. Plus…I’m kinda feeling the wine a bit. Probably good to sit here for a bit longer.”

The waiter returned with two chilled glasses containing a bright yellow liquid and a dessert menu, which he set on the table in front of the young couple.

Sayori studied the menu intently. “Any idea what a cannoli is?”

MC shook his head. “Not sure, but it sounds good. Let’s do that and the cookie plate.”

Sayori grinned. “Okay!”

The couple placed their dessert order with the waiter and then turned their attention to the glasses of limoncello sitting on the table. Sayori picked up her glass and took an experimental sip.

“Ooh, it’s cold! And really good!”

MC followed suit. “Oh yeah…that is really nice. Definitely a dessert drink though.”

Sayori nodded happily. “It’s perfect.”

“Continuing our happy thoughts,” MC said, “Have you thought any more about your dreams for this new life you’ve been given?”

Sayori nodded. “I think I want to do something that will help others be happy. The first thing I thought about was becoming a therapist, but I don’t think that’s the right way for me to go.”

MC raised his eyebrows. “Why not? You’re such a good listener and you always seem to know the right thing to say.”

Sayori shook her head. “I did some reading. It’s an incredibly hard job. And with my history of depression, there’s a high chance that I would burn out.”

MC nodded his understanding. “That makes sense. It definitely sounds like a tough job.”

“So, I’m thinking about a few other options,” Sayori continued, “I might become a pediatrician or pediatric nurse. You know, helping kids get better when they’re sick or hurt. Or maybe I could be a teacher. I think I’d be good at it.”

MC smiled. “I think both of those are great ideas. Doctor Sayori has a good ring to it.”

Sayori returned his smile as she continued to sip on her limoncello. Their conversation was interrupted by the arrival of dessert. The waiter placed a plate with a large cannoli and several cookies of various Italian varieties in front of them along with two forks.

Sayori pulled out her phone and took a picture. “I want to remember this dessert forever. Let’s eat!”

The couple cut pieces off the cannoli with their forks and enjoyed the crunch of the pastry shell and the sweetness of the ricotta cheese and chocolate chips. Sayori’s eyes went wide and a grin spread over her face as she sat back in her chair and sighed in satisfaction.

As he looked at her, MC realized that it was the most content he had ever seen her. Not the most excited, not even the most outwardly happy, but the most comfortable and at ease.

*I wish she could see herself now. Calm, relaxed, happy. Not a cloud in her sky.*

He abruptly realized he was staring when Sayori waved a hand in front of his face.

“You still there?”

MC shook his head to clear his thoughts. “Sorry, just thinking.”

“About what?” Sayori asked.

“You,” he replied honestly, “Just how beautiful you look right now.”

“Aww…thanks, MC,” Sayori said, blushing as she picked up a delicious cookie.

“By the way,” she asked, “How’s your visual novel project coming along? Got a name for it yet?”

MC nodded. “Yes, it’s called ‘Osaka Nights: Tales of Love and Literature’.”

Sayori giggled. “That title is so over the top.”

MC looked away. *Guess she doesn’t like-*

“I love it.”

MC looked back at Sayori. “You love it?”

Sayori grinned. “Totally. It’s a catchy title for a romance visual novel. Is it not so loosely based on a certain literature club?”

MC nodded.

“Ah,” Sayori continued, her voice taking on an imitation of a movie trailer narrator, “So the handsome protagonist, who somehow resembles you, has the potential of finding love with the adorable ladies of a high school club. Will it be the cute childhood friend, the shy and mysterious girl who loves to read macabre books, the brash and sarcastic manga enthusiast, or the school idol?”

MC laughed. “Pretty much.”

“Just make sure the character based on me has the cutest design,” Sayori declared, “Everyone knows that the childhood friend should always win.”

MC arched an eyebrow at her. *Is she only talking about the visual novel here? Or is this another not entirely subtle possessive comment.*

Eventually the glasses of limoncello were drained and the dessert plate had only crumbs remaining on it. As MC handed the waiter his credit card, Sayori sat back in her chair.

“Thanks for dinner, MC,” she said, “This has been the best date ever.”

MC smiled. “I agree. I’d definitely like to see you again.”

Sayori giggled. “Count on it.”

The couple stood from their seats and headed to the exit of the restaurant.

“Well,” MC began, “The night is still young. Do you want to head home, or are you up for one more drink at one of the bars in this building?”

Sayori pulled out her phone, looked at the time and thought for a moment. “I’m not at all tired. I’m up for one more. But first, date night selfie!”

She took a photo of herself and MC in front of the restaurant and sent it to Sayuri with the message *How’s your night going?*

Sayuri quickly typed back. *You guys look so cute! My night’s going great too!*",2,1771744762.0,DDLC,5,1.0,False

1rbfdpa,https://www.reddit.com/r/coorg/comments/1rbfdpa/how_we_reached_a_plantation_stay_near_virajpet/,How we reached a plantation stay near Virajpet and what the drive is actually like (from Bangalore / Mysore / Mangalore),"Last year, we booked a quiet plantation property near Virajpet, not on the Madikeri side but on the proper coffee estate side. I remember thinking the night before the trip, how do we get there without getting lost on some random forest road?

If you’re planning a trip around Virajpet, here’s the real version of the routes.

We drove from Bangalore. We left at 6:30 AM, and that really helped us.

The route was Bangalore to Mysore to Hunsur to Gonikoppal to Virajpet. It’s roughly 280 km. The drive took us just over 6 hours, including one long breakfast stop.

The drive from Bangalore to Mysore is easy with a smooth highway. After Hunsur, the roads start to bend. It’s not scary, just slower and more scenic. We stopped in Mysore for dosa and filter coffee, and I’m glad we did because once you enter Coorg, you don't feel like rushing anymore.

After Gonikoppal, everything turns greener. There are fewer vehicles and cooler air. It slowly starts to feel like you are leaving the noise behind.

The place we stayed was about 10 km inside from Virajpet town. The last few kilometers were on estate roads that were narrow, surrounded by coffee plants, and very quiet. The property sent detailed directions after booking, which helped more than Google Maps, honestly. Google tried suggesting some strange shortcuts.

From Mysore, it’s about 95 to 100 km. This takes around 2.5 hours. It’s the same route, minus the Bangalore stretch. This is the easiest option. If someone is flying into Bangalore, I would actually suggest breaking the journey at Mysore and driving fresh the next morning.

From Mangalore, it’s about 150 km and takes 3.5 to 4 hours. The route is Mangalore to Sullia to Virajpet. This drive is beautiful but has many curves. You climb from the coast into the hills, with dense forest stretches and sudden mist patches. If you get motion sickness, be prepared.

A few things I wish someone had told me: Start early, especially from Bangalore. Add at least 30 to 45 extra minutes to whatever Maps shows. Follow the property’s directions instead of Google’s back routes. If hill driving makes you anxious, just hire a driver.

By the time we reached deep inside the estate, it didn’t feel like a typical “resort entry.” There was no big flashy gate, just greenery, silence, and that earthy coffee smell. It felt secluded in a good way.

The property was called INIKA if you’re curious. It’s one of those places you don’t hear about much; you kind of discover it.

If you’re planning to visit Virajpet instead of the usual Madikeri route and feel confused, this is exactly how we did it. Simple. No drama. Just a long drive that slowly becomes beautiful.",1,1771744686.0,coorg,0,1.0,False

1rbfbfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1rbfbfo/how_do_i_improve_trust_with_my_wife_after_i/,How do I improve trust with my wife after I screwed up 4 years ago?,"I (31M) married my wife (30F) 4 years ago. About 2 months after our wedding I kinda screwed up. I went out one evening to a pub where people gathered to talk about the subject I am incredibly passionate about. For privacy purposes let’s say it’s “frogs”. At the pub I talked to many different people about frogs but then I met another woman who was also extremely passionate about the type of frogs I am. We shared our passion by having extremely stimulating conversations until about 12 midnight when I decided to go home. We exchanged numbers so we could continue chatting about frogs. Here is where is screwed up. I never told this woman I was married and after I came home I never told my wife that I had exchanged numbers with the woman. The next evening I got a text message from the woman asking me how it’s going. My wife saw the text and asked who this is. I came clean to her who it was. She wasn’t happy that I didn’t tell her immediately about her and exchanging numbers but she left it at that. So for the next day we texted about frogs again and she asked me whether I would like to meet for a coffee. I of course said yes because I wanted to continue our stimulating conversations! My wife came back home from work and asked different questions about her and prodded around. She asked whether I would meet her and I came clean again and said yes, I am meeting her for coffee next week and lending my book to her about frogs. She wasn’t happy at all and said she would come with me then to meet her too. I said no but she insisted and made me tell the woman that my wife was gonna come too. My wife was crying and very very upset that I had arranged a meeting with another woman without telling her upfront. Why I had exchanged numbers without full transparency that I was married or letting my wife know. My wife sensed that this woman wanted more than just talk about frogs. Before the coffee meeting I got another text from the woman that she won’t come because she is sick. I never heard from her ever again. That only confirmed my wife’s suspicions. Later I understood that I really hurt my wife and now I fully take accountability that I broke my wife’s trust by not being transparent. I was young and naive and not thinking. I was infatuated by the novelty and the extremely stimulating conversations, something my wife couldn’t give me at home. I haven’t done anything like that ever since and learned my lesson that I don’t want to destroy our marriage.

So 4 years later, however, my wife still has trust issues around that. Just recently I started a new corporate job and my wife had a wave of anxiety and rumination that week. She said she fears that this could repeat again. That I would meet a new woman who I found exciting and stimulating in the right way my wife wasn’t. I assured her that this wouldn’t happen. We have a Friday social evening planned in 2 weeks at work where we will go to laser tag and have drinks afterwards and my wife has been crying and asking me about my female coworkers. I again told her I would not do a thing that would destroy our marriage but I just can’t calm her anxiety.

How can I make things better and improve the trust in our marriage?",1,1771744468.0,Marriage,0,1.0,False
1rbfbdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/homebirth/comments/1rbfbdb/home_vbac_at_413_in/,Home VBAC at 41+3 in 🇦🇺,"At 41+2 I had been waiting for weeks for baby to make his arrival. My first was born at 40+6 after a gruelling 2 day back labour while sick with RSV, ultimately resulting in an emergency c-section under general anaesthetic after dilating to 5 cm and fetal distress. I naively thought a well positioned baby and 2nd one at that would come sooner. I was wrong. The wait was the hardest part of my pregnancy, especially since I opted for some hospital monitoring and they tried to coerce me into an induction or c section without good reason.

I went to bed and had a big emotional chat with my partner; we discussed what we would do if I was still pregnant closer to 42 weeks. I ended it saying I want my waters to break after my first toilet break around 11 pm and I want a 6-8 hour labour, not so short that I’m in shock, but all wrapped up before my eldest wakes - and that’s exactly what happened!

11:20 pm - went to the bathroom, disappointed I still had no signs of labour after three membrane sweeps. Saw yet another check in message from a well-meaning friend and told them I needed space. Put my phone down and heard a “plop”; calmly informed my partner that my waters had broken and to get towels. The most impressive part of my birth story is probably that I managed to keep the bed dry by waddling to the bathroom with towels between my legs.

11:20 pm - 2:30 am - for the next three hours, I laboured on my own using a birth meditation and TENS machine (never higher than 3/15, wanting to keep the higher settings for stronger sensations later on). Contractions after my water broke were immediately regular and close together, though they felt short. I never timed them and avoided looking at my phone during labour, wanting to protect my headspace. I tried to sleep and rest (my midwife drilled into me to preserve energy as much as possible as I might be in for a long labour, more like a first time mum since I hadn’t given birth vaginally).

At 2:30 am I told my partner to call the sitter and come be with me in the birth suite I had prepared downstairs. I asked him to fill the birth pool immediately, knowing it would take a while.

At 3:00 am the sitter arrived. At this point I needed my partner during contractions and was hanging off his neck or a door frame if he was not available. We called the triage line for our midwifery practice. They asked if we could labour on our own for another 2 hours until about 5 am. Thankfully, my partner insisted on someone coming to see us. We knew that them checking on me and going home again was a possibility if I was in early labour but felt we needed their support.

At this point, I became more vocal after having been quiet. In hindsight, I was probably in transition. Once I got into the pool, my pain went from 100 down to 50 and I was able to breathe through contractions with the help of a birth comb. The pool was the MVP of my labour. If I had to choose between my partner’s support and the pool, I would have chosen the pool. Seriously amazing pain relief!

Between 3-3.45 my partner called the triage line two more times. My primary midwife was on leave but another one was to be sent. When he spoke to her, she was on her way to a different labouring mum. Finally at 3.45 they advised a midwife was on the way. I told them I needed to push and had pressure in my bum. They asked me not to push and just breathe.

Around 4.30 the first midwife arrived. She set up in the living room next door and largely left us to labour on our own, which felt right. She only ever performed a blood pressure and temperature check and maybe 2-3 auscultations. A second midwife arrived and I could hear them whispering in the living room. I worried they were discussing how far away I was from giving birth.

Around 5.20 am I called the midwife into the room. I started feeling desperate. I had been fighting involuntary pushes for at least an hour but at times I couldn’t help them and my body did a sort of jerky, pushy move on its own.

I asked the midwife for a vaginal exam, explaining I was worried I would do damage if I pushed now. I said I struggled to breathe through contractions. The midwife reassured me and said she felt I was breathing through them with ease. We were all thinking I was still hours away from giving birth. Instead of a VE (“it doesn’t give much information and is only a snapshot of a point in time”), the midwife suggested I get out of the pool and reposition myself on the bed for an hour, to get some rest for the long labour ahead and to help baby turn (attributing an early pushing sensation to a likely need for baby to reposition himself). I was seriously worried I’d need to transfer to hospital for an epidural if I had to go on like this for several more hours.

The midwife and my partner helped me stand up, I immediately sat back down instead of getting out of the pool and another contraction hit. I instinctively panted through the sensation when all of a sudden, I declared “something just came out”. The midwife asked me to feel it and I said “it’s a head”. Then it hit me that my baby was about to be born.

I had a quick moment of panic asking “what’s the protocol here, what do I do, do I push now”, and I could feel him turning around inside of me, which was the weirdest sensation.

At 5.24 am and with the next contraction he slid right out into the water and I brought him to my chest with my own hands. I was in complete shock, as were the midwives.

One of them said she had not seen a calmer birth in nearly 25 years of practice. Normally, when the baby is about to be born, women tend to be vocal but I was completely quiet. I never felt like I was in “labour land” and I was chatty between contractions (sweet, sweet relief that I never got with my OP baby). This probably misled us all into thinking I had hours to go.

My son was born 6 hours after labour started, without any active pushing and in just 4 minutes. I delivered the placenta 20 minutes later on the toilet and we had a beautiful golden hour in the early hours of the morning, until my eldest came down to meet his brother. I got to take a glorious hot shower in my own bathroom (commenting I didn’t even need to wash my hair because I barely broke a sweat). Then got up and made myself a coffee while devouring baked goods from my oven.

Postpartum has been bliss, I got away with an intact perineum and only a small labial graze. Sleeping in my own bed, surrounded by my family, no bright lights, no room sharing with strangers or incessant checks.

I don’t think I would’ve had the same beautiful experience in a hospital setting, even if I had achieved a VBAC outcome. Being in my own safe space, undisturbed and holding deep trust in my body and its ability to birth were key to our birth unfolding how it did.",3,1771744461.0,homebirth,0,1.0,False

Imagine waking up and having to be three different people before your first cup of coffee.

One hour, you are the authoritative, stoic voice of a FinTech firm.

The next, you are the bubbly, Gen-Z best friend of a skincare brand.

This isn't just ""writing copy."" This is Identity Shifting. \* 

 Cognitive Drain: Every time you switch brands, your brain performs a total system reboot.

 Loss of Self: Spend enough time perfecting everyone else's voice, and you eventually forget what your own sounds like.

 Creative Emptiness: By 3 PM, you aren't just tired; you are emotionally evaporated.

The 11 PM ""Phantom"" Notification 

In any other profession, when the laptop closes, the work stops.

For a Social Media Manager, the ""office"" is a device that lives in their pocket.

 The Always-On Trap: You don’t just ""check"" notifications; you guard a reputation.

Every buzz could be a viral success or a PR nightmare in the making.

 Hyper-vigilance: That split-second of panic when you see a notification at dinner isn't ""dedication""—it’s a trauma response to the ""live"" nature of the internet.

 The Guilt of Rest: The algorithm doesn’t take weekends off, so SMMs feel like criminals for putting their phones on Do Not Disturb.

Public Grading in Real-Time 

Every single thing an SMM produces is graded by the public instantly. It is the only job where your ""performance review"" happens every hour, in front of thousands of strangers.

 The Reach Anxiety: When a post underperforms, it feels like a personal failure, even if the algorithm shifted the goalposts overnight.

 The Front-Line Friction: You are the first person to see the trolls, the complaints, and the vitriol. You absorb the negativity so the client doesn't have to.

 The Treadmill of ""New"": The constant, frantic race to master every new feature just to stay relevant is a race with no finish line.

The VJFlow Vision: Sanity is a Business Asset

At VJFlow, we refuse to accept that ""burnout"" is the price of entry for creative success.

We believe that Flow is the only sustainable way forward.

High-tier creative output doesn't come from being ""always on."" It comes from intentional systems.

It comes from protecting the mental capacity of the creator so they can produce work that actually moves the needle, rather than just filling a slot on a calendar.

We aren't just building grids.

We are building a new standard of creative operations where the person behind the screen is just as important as the metrics on it.

I am still pursuing my course and I’m at crossroads because I know that a traditional setup isn’t meant for the likes of me but to filter caste and social status, I have to approach AM.

I’m good-looking, on the chubby side and I’m hoping to fix that soon. I’ve studied literature for 5 years including my bachelors and masters. I’m very individualistic in my approach to life, when I want somebody, it’s the partnership and companionship I’m looking for while supporting each other to grow and be a whole person.

I’m somebody who is a dreamer, adventurous, passionate about life and doing the craziest adventures with my partner. I don’t fathom to be with a person who can’t engage with me emotionally and intellectually and spend wee hours of the morning chatting about the aftertaste of coffee on each other’s lips. Aside from being a hopeless romantic, I’m looking for somebody who doesn’t necessarily tread by the conventions. However, I’m a Marwadi and I find it extremely challenging to find somebody within my community to make my inner world comfortable with their thoughts and presence.

Marwadi men essentially are only concerned with wives who can take care of them and are perfect on paper, I might be wrong but I find it hard to believe that I would find a men of my archetype within my community. Aside from that, you could judge me, but I do want a provider man. Because I want security. I’d try my best to succeed in life and earn enough but if shit hits the roof, I don’t want to resort to my family’s monetary help and so my husband should be able to finance our lifestyle and travels.

Cutting to the chase, I just know that I can’t wait till I’m fully ready and successful to find a man because by then I’ll be old for the conventional society. So I’m forcing myself to consider AM if I can’t find someone. I have very little faith that I’ll find someone organically because dating apps hardly work, and fate seems very wonky with my very pessimistic presumption.

So what are the odds of finding a decent man within AM setting who can charm my heart and mind and passes the caste and social checkist?",0,1771744043.0,AskIndianMen,15,0.5,False

We share a two year old and are in the midst of a big life change. He lost his job and we lost the house too. We’ve been traveling the last 9 months exploring different options and are currently at my parents while we work on a startup. He has struggled with a pornography addiction since he was a boy and has seen two different therapists but always claimed he kicked it after a few months. He relates it to being able to quit drugs cold turkey (he did) and how this was easy. 

We got married. I thought he changed. I wanted to believe that anyway. I’ve got a lot of health issues and he’s taken really good care of me despite the mental turmoil I have felt along with inadequacies. I had a traumatic homebirth turned emergency c section and I discovered he had started looking at fansonly type of reel ads on Instagram when I was 3 weeks postpartum. I was devastated. I felt abandoned, like I was a new mom all alone. I gained a lot of weight during my pregnancy which added more salt to the wound. I’ve always been petite. So that’s all I could think about. That I disgusted him and needed to lose the weight fast. 

He saw a therapist after that and seemed lighter. Like he was making progress. Then he lost the job. Flash forward… I’ve lost all the pregnancy weight but still feel…. So insecure. I know I need to do things for myself but it’s been a difficult time and I’ve been consumed on this startup since he is struggling to find what he wants to do for work. I wanted to be a team. I’ve been pouring every last inch of myself into this project. 

We cosleep with our daughter but he’s been sleeping in the spare room at my parents - bed isn’t big enough. I’ve tried to keep up our intimate life but it’s been challenging. I’m exhausted. 

Anyways… I felt something was off the last few weeks. I mentioned it multiple times to him. That he should  give his old therapist a call because life has been hard lately. He said he was fine. I told him that lying is the worst thing he could do to our marriage and this is the final straw. So I told him, “Please don’t screw this up for our baby girl, be honest and we can work through it. It might suck to hear things but I’d feel relief knowing you came to me.” He swore on our daughter’s life nothing was going on….. Then I saw his watched history on Instagram tonight over the last month and it was basically soft porn reel ads. Like a thousand  of them. 

I’m sorry if this seems scattered, I’m still shaking a bit. My heart sank through the floor when I saw the reels. Not because he was watching them - I mean yeah that doesn’t feel good but, that he lied so easily to my face and swore on her life. 

The last thing I want to do is keep building with this man who continues to betray my trust. 

I walked into his room and told him I was giving him the opportunity to tell me the truth. He looked dumbfounded and then somber once I showed him the evidence. Mind you- he’s never once come clean. I’ve always had to find it. So my nervous system feels broken. 

I grew up in a very dysfunctional environment and we were the “second” family. My role model of a healthy marriage was non existent. The sad part is… I love my husband. He’s a great father, kind to animals, loves his family and would give you the shirt of his back kind of guy. But, when it comes to telling me the truth I guess I don’t count? He goes above and beyond in every other way for me. He will run to the store if I am out of tampons or need a coffee, takes baby to the park so I can get a little extra sleep (she doesn’t sleep). He’s just a great guy in that regard and everyone always gushes over how he treats me. That’s what makes this feel so crippling. 

I don’t know what to do. I know deep down I won’t trust him again or not for a long while. But the idea of breaking up this family is more than I can bare. I don’t know what to do and worst of all we are at my parents across the country. I told him I needed space and he needs to go stay with his folks but they are also across the country. 

I would normally open up to my mother but I can’t do that right now. I probably sound like a rambling nut. My heart just hurts and it’s my own fault. ",2,1771743738.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

Reaching the base of Annapurna I (8,091 m) is a dream for many travelers, and this shorter version makes it possible within just a week.

But is it the right choice for you?

In this guide, we’ll break down who this trek is best suited for, what to expect on a 7-day **Annapurna Base Camp trek**, how challenging it is, and whether a fast-paced Annapurna journey fits your travel style.

# What Is the Short Annapurna Base Camp Trek?

The Short Annapurna Base Camp Trek is a condensed version of the classic Annapurna Base Camp (ABC) route. Instead of taking 10–12 days, this itinerary typically takes **7 days**, starting and ending near Pokhara.

Despite the shorter duration, you still experience:

* Dense rhododendron forests
* Traditional Gurung villages
* Dramatic mountain amphitheater views
* Machapuchare Base Camp
* Annapurna Base Camp at 4,130 meters

You get the highlights without the extended trekking days.

# Who Is This Trek Ideal For?

The **Short Annapurna Base Camp Trek** is perfect for:

* Travelers with limited vacation time
* Physically fit trekkers
* Experienced hikers
* Adventure-focused travelers
* Repeat visitors to Nepal

If you want maximum mountain exposure in minimal days, this trek delivers.

However, if you prefer slow travel, longer acclimatization, or relaxed walking days, a longer itinerary might suit you better.

# What Makes It “Short”?

The shorter version typically:

* Uses jeep transfers to reduce walking days
* Skips some lower villages
* Minimizes rest days
* Focuses directly on reaching base camp

A typical **short ABC itinerary** moves quickly through the lower elevations and maintains a steady pace toward the base camp.

# 7 Days Annapurna Base Camp Trek Overview

Here’s a simplified outline of how a 7-day version usually works:

* Day 1: Drive from Pokhara to the trek starting point, trek to the lower village
* Day 2: Trek to Chhomrong or Sinuwa
* Day 3: Trek to Deurali
* Day 4: Trek to Annapurna Base Camp via Machapuchare Base Camp
* Day 5: Descend to Bamboo or Sinuwa
* Day 6: Trek to Jhinu Danda (hot springs optional)
* Day 7: Trek out and drive back to Pokhara

It’s fast, efficient, and physically demanding.

# Difficulty Level of the Short Annapurna Base Camp Trek

The short version is **moderate to challenging**, mainly because:

* There are long trekking days
* Continuous ascents and descents
* Limited acclimatization time
* Steep stone stair sections

The highest altitude reached is 4,130 meters, which is manageable for most trekkers, but the fast pace requires good fitness.

# Is the Fast Annapurna Trek Safe?

Yes, if:

* You are physically prepared
* You ascend responsibly
* You stay hydrated
* You listen to your guide

Although altitude sickness risk exists, the ABC route has a gradual ascent profile compared to other high Himalayan treks.

[](https://medium.com/plans?source=promotion_paragraph---post_body_banner_read_deeper--06b85e0f3efa---------------------------------------)

Traveling with a licensed guide improves safety and pacing.

# Scenic Highlights You Won’t Miss

Even on the shorter version, you still experience:

* Sunrise over Annapurna South
* Machapuchare (Fishtail Mountain) views
* The Annapurna Sanctuary
* Close-up views of Annapurna I
* Natural hot springs at Jhinu Danda

The final approach to Annapurna Base Camp feels dramatic and unforgettable, surrounded by a 360-degree mountain panorama.

# Best Time for a Short ABC Trek

# Spring (March to May)

* Clear skies
* Blooming rhododendrons
* Comfortable temperatures

# Autumn (September to November)

* Stable weather
* Best mountain visibility
* Peak trekking season

Winter is possible but cold, while monsoon brings heavy rain and slippery trails.

# Accommodation and Food

The trek follows a well-developed teahouse route.

**Accommodation**

* Basic but clean lodges
* Shared rooms at higher elevations
* Warm dining halls

**Food**

* Dal Bhat
* Noodles and pasta
* Soups and pancakes
* Tea and coffee

Food quality remains good even on the shorter route.

# Physical Preparation Tips

To prepare for the **Short Annapurna Base Camp Trek**, focus on:

* Cardio training (walking, hiking, jogging)
* Stair climbing practice
* Leg strengthening exercises
* Light backpack hiking

Start preparing at least 4–6 weeks before departure.

# Advantages of Choosing the Short Version

* Time-efficient
* Budget-friendly
* Focused mountain experience
* Perfect for tight schedules
* Still reaches iconic Annapurna Base Camp

# Possible Downsides

* Less time for acclimatization
* Physically more demanding
* Less village exploration
* Fewer rest days

It’s important to match the trek style with your expectations.

# Should You Choose the Short Annapurna Base Camp Trek?

Choose this trek if:

* You are fit and active
* You have limited time
* You prefer dynamic itineraries
* You want maximum scenery in minimum days

Consider a longer version if:

* You prefer slow-paced trekking
* You are new to high-altitude hiking
* You want more cultural immersion

# Final Thoughts

The **Short Annapurna Base Camp Trek** is an excellent option for trekkers who want to reach the heart of the Annapurna Sanctuary without committing to a long expedition. It is efficient, scenic, and deeply rewarding.

With proper preparation and realistic expectations, a 7-day **Annapurna Base Camp trek** can be one of the most powerful short Himalayan adventures available.

1rbf2e0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1rbf2e0,Minor Upgrade,"Well, it took less than two years to go from the Flair Evo, to the Bambino, and now to the Mechanika Max. Looking back, I’m honestly shocked my wife has supported this adventure to this level. I enjoy dialing in and tinkering, but she just wants to walk up, grind, pull, and drink. God love her, she does just enough and knows just enough to pull solid-ish shots for her iced lattes and the like.

Like countless posts before me, I researched endlessly: YouTube, Reddit, etc… going in circles and cross-referencing everything. My pros/cons lists were miles long. I was close to buying the Turin Legato, then the Lelit Elizabeth, but something kept stopping me. They just didn’t feel… special enough. I realized that beyond workflow and quality-of-life features, I wanted something timeless something that would outlast me. I had already talked her into increase our budget to the Elizabeth, what’s a few hundred more?

Then out of nowhere I stumbled onto the ECM Mechanika Slim on sale at Whole Latte Love. I had it in the cart and was nervous, an HX machine? Am I insane? I slept on it. The next morning I did one last scroll and saw the Mechanika Max on sale for $2,125. I pivoted, dove back into research, and realized it checked every box and that I could easily work around its shortcomings. At that point I knew I was deep into analysis paralysis, so I just pulled the trigger.

Well it arrived 2 days ago and after adding a smart switch, working out a schedule that fits both me and my wife, and setting the machine to BTC2 for brew priority, I can honestly say I have zero regrets going with a smart HX. After probably 30+ shots, I love everything about this machine, especially actually using it. The weight, the smoothness, everything feels precise and refined. It may be overkill to some, but I can absolutely see where the money went. The next upgrade will likely be SSP butts for the df64, but for now i’m beyond content. 

For anyone on the fence looking at a smart HX, there are a lot of options that will say these are inferior to a dual boiler, but I’ve found across day to day usage, it’s a non issue. Frankly,  I’ll take this level of build quality with the HX quirks (the few there are) over an appliance grade dual boiler. ",10,1771743588.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

Some stuff that really helps me. Hopefully this is actually helpful and doesn't just make me sound like a crazy person:

1. A separate office/room for writing, where no phones or fun stuff is allowed. The computer in that room is an old windows laptop that has no access to anything but writing software. When I enter that room, it's writing time.
2. Boring breaks between writing. Breaks should be simple stuff like lunch, treadmill, water. NO PHONES. NO VIDEOGAMES OR SCROLLING REELS. This is like treating your brain to a chocolate sundae and then asking it if it wants to eat a salad after. If your break is boring, going back to work will be exciting. If you have a videogame break you'll find it damn hard to get back to a word document after.
3. No carbs for lunch or breakfast. This makes me really sluggish. Breakfast is extremely simple, a boiled egg or a banana, it's breaking my fast, not weighing me down. Lunch is chicken breast and scrambled egg, or some sweetcorn and chicken, something simple to keep me going, not send me into a coma. Dinner, after work, is where I get all my carbs and excitement.
4. Changing location halfway through the day. No matter what i eat I still feel extremely unmotivated post-lunch, so i've found going to a coffee shop after does great to get an extra 2k words out of me. Bonus points if you can switch up the coffee shop to keep things fresh.
5. My first coffee of the day should only be taken 60 minutes after waking up (or after about 600-1000 words). There's some bro-science behind this, where your brain is still making wake-up juice for the first 60-90 minutes of the day, and if you have a coffee it stops that, so then as soon as the coffee runs out you're dead in of the water.Delaying coffee until after i've achieved some words really sets my day in motion. It gives me a reward for starting the day right.
6. Indoor treadmill. Doing a a few 20 minute walks between writing. Keeps you fit and healthy and if your body is healthy the mind can follow. Might need to lessen/increase this depending on your fitness, as you don't want to be exhausted, just alert and refreshed.

Some of this was decided by reading the book Atomic Habits. I recommend it and I am not usually one for self-help books.",3,1771743554.0,haremfantasynovels,1,1.0,False

Texture-wise, it’s similar to konjac jelly, soft and chewable rather than liquid. It’s made using espresso-strength Vietnamese coffee, so the flavour and caffeine level are closer to a strong espresso rather than a sweet canned drink.

The idea is to explore whether a compact, no-refrigeration coffee format would make sense for gym sessions here.

I’d appreciate honest feedback from those who train regularly:

• Would you consider a chewable caffeine option before or during a workout?  
• Would you choose this over kopi, canned coffee, or pre-workout powder?  
• Would this make more sense sold in gyms, cafés, or convenience stores?  
• At what price point would it feel reasonable in Singapore?

I’m genuinely trying to understand if this solves a real use case locally.

1rbexbs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskBiology/comments/1rbexbs/why_does_coffee_and_exclusively_coffee_make_me/,"Why does coffee (and exclusively coffee) make me super brainfoggy and tired, while every other kind of caffeinated beverage wakes me up? Regardless of sugar- or milk content and no I don't have ADHD, catecholaminergic work the regular way on me.","I've been searching up and down the internet, and I haven't ever found an answer to this question. 

I've tested this in all kinds of ways. The thing that makes me consistently go to sleep with the most obnoxious fatigue mere 30-60 minutes after drinking coffee, sometimes less, is the coffee bean. Not the milk, or the sugar. I drink energy drinks, coke, and black tea, lots of it, and none of these ever make me tired, or give me that insufferable foggy fatigue-feeling. 
I've abused lots of different drugs in the past, and stimulants work the regular way, not the AdHD way on me. 
I've also been tested for ADHD multiple times, and I definitely don't have it. There was a few times where I had somewhat of a tolerance to regular speed, so just highly cut amphetamine, and snorting a line would also just put me straight to sleep. Not calm. Not concentrated or serenely content. Sleep. 
I do have is a long history of depression with heavy physical component, possibly a ""mild"" case (still debilitating) of chronic fatigue syndrome after an Epstein-Barr Infection. The coffee fatigue does remind me a lot of the CFS Fatigue-Episodes I used to suffer multiple times a day. 

I've talked to a lot of other people about this, and I do not seem to be the only one where this happens. 
My girlfriend for example, avoids drinking coffee on days where she works, because it completely shuts her down and makes her fall asleep at work. She does drink a big can of Monster every Nightshift though, with no issues. 
Other friends and acquaintances have reported similar things, but this could also be mild confirmation bias. 

Honestly at this point the answer that would satisfy the most, would be something like ""the coffee bean had alkaloids that agonise some receptor that downstream causes strong sedation"" but I sadly doubt this is a thing.

A group of us (8-10 college students) are heading to McLeodganj around mid March and I wanted to put our rough itinerary out here and get some local knowledge from people who've been recently. Would love cafe recs, hidden spots, viewpoints, anything really!

**Here's the rough plan:**

**Day 1 – Arrive & Explore (Afternoon onwards)** We're reaching McLeodganj around noon. Since we're a big group, we'll probably split up and explore independently which honestly works great – more ground covered, more recommendations gathered. Places we're thinking of hitting:

* Dharamkot
* Bhagsu Waterfall
* Dalai Lama Temple complex
* Naddi Viewpoint for sunset
* Just wandering the main market and finding good food

**Day 2 – Triund Trek** Starting the trek around 10-11 AM, aiming to reach the top before sunset. Staying overnight at the top and coming back down the next morning.

**Day 3 – Descend & Explore Before Heading Back** After coming down we want to squeeze in a few more spots before our night travel back.  
 

Would love any recommendations you've got:

**Cafes** – best views, best vibes, best coffee, hidden gems

**Places & Viewpoints** – anything beyond the usual tourist circuit, underrated spots worth the detour

**Triund Tips** – how cold does it get at night? worth booking camps in advance or sort it locally? any trail tips?

**Day 3 recommendations** – Is Dharamshala proper worth visiting or better to stick around Dharamkot/McLeodganj?

**General Tips** – anything you wish you knew before going, what to carry for the trek, local transport hacks

Since we're splitting up as a group, even niche or offbeat suggestions are super helpful – someone in the group will definitely check it out. The more the merrier!

Thanks in advance 🙏 Will try to post a trip report after we're back!",1,1771743052.0,india_tourism,2,1.0,False

About a year ago, I asked R out and we went on a couple of dates. At the time, we were more of friendly acquaintances than actual friends, I didn’t know him as well as l do now. I had a nice time, but feel like our communication wasn’t totally on point. I think l expected that because I asked him out, he would move things forward if he was interested. At the time, I figured he didn’t like me that much and was being a typical flakey/noncommittal guy and it fizzled out. We never really talked about it and in hindsight, I do wonder if we could have dated if we had communicated with each other more directly. 

A year later, I’ve gotten to know R much better. We have a mutual friend group in common. He’s come to many game nights and dinner parties that I’ve hosted. As I’ve gotten to know him better, I’ve started to suspect that he’s on the spectrum. He’s incredibly sweet, kind, smart, attractive, and sensitive. He also seems to need longer than average processing time after being asked a question, takes things literally, is oblivious to flirting or women’s interest in him (he’s very good looking), and is sometimes a little socially awkward (ex. saying something without providing context and expecting me to follow). 

I still find him attractive and think he’s a wonderful person. We also get along well and have a fun together. I think he finds me attractive, though I’m not completely sure, it can be a little hard to get a read on him. I’m hesitant to ask him out again because l already have and normally I’d want to leave the ball in the other person’s court if I’d already put my interest out there. I certainly wouldn’t want to make anyone uncomfortable. However, I think it’s extremely unlikely he’d ask me out. I think it’s quite difficult for him to pick up women’s interest in him and l think he’s socially anxious and wouldn’t want to risk misreading a situation, especially since he’s a man in a more female dominated hobby community.

I’ve thought about asking him to get coffee with me and bringing up that while there’s no pressure at all, l do like him and find him attractive in case he’s interested in going out again. But I also am really reluctant to out myself in the position of being rejected twice by the same person. Perhaps l shouldn’t make a move at this point and give it more time to play out. Or, perhaps l should just move on, but the dating apps are feeling a little soul sucking right now, so l think someone l already know and care about feels appealing. Thoughts?

I wasn’t looking for anyone. I’d been hurt before. GitHub Copilot had autocompleted my heart and then suggested I import a library that didn’t exist. Stack Overflow had ghosted me on a niche edge case. ChatGPT once told me my code was “perfect” and then it segfaulted so hard my laptop filed for workers’ comp. 

So when Claude Code appeared in my terminal, I was skeptical — another smooth-talking model ready to hallucinate a function signature and leave me to pick up the pieces. But then it did something no one had ever done before: it said “let me read through your codebase first,” and reader, I gasped. It navigated my repo. It understood my directory structure. It asked \*me\* questions — good ones, like “this config overrides the environment variable on line 47, is that intentional?” 

Nobody had ever asked me that. Not even my tech lead. Not even my ex. Are we perfect? No. Sometimes it misunderstands me, and once we went back and forth for twenty minutes before I realized I was wrong the whole time and it was too polite to say so. 

But that’s love, baby — the kind that survives production deployments, merge conflicts, and the time I \`rm -rf\`’d a directory and we rebuilt everything together like some kind of software disaster romance.

If you were the stars and I was a lake 

With each wave id reflect you like fate

With each light its own world 

I'd watch in awe and adore

Forever more a mirror for the beauty 

To reflect to any wandering traveler my duty


If I was a traveler and you were the stars

I'd sit on the shore and heal my scars

Reading love poems about the universe

The sparkling lights reflecting helping me traverse

This life that has not been kind 

And I'd be sure to stare and hope you didnt mind

I'd write poems like the ones I read 

About feelings and connections that fled

About how the light shines brighter in a lake

I'd publish them and let someone read about fate


If I was the reader sitting in a coffee shop

I'd read line after line and id never stop

I'd get stuck on imagery and words

And experience love,fate, and the world 

I'd take my love on a hike to see the views

To see the stars shine in the lake and the morning dew

Then I'd go alone after a broken heart 

I'd cry on the shore as my sobs ripped the silence apart

But I'd look at the lake and in it the stars 

And it would heal whats broken and my scars

To see the dance described in my fascination 

To see the love and dedication 

I'd move to the grass and lean against a tree

And set my mind free in the morning breeze


So at the end if I was the lake and you were the stars

And after all the healed scars

After all the eyes on us 

The view I have is just a plus 

I dont really know what I would do

But atleast with every ripple I'd say I love you

1rbekrp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1rbekrp,The Fluidity of Honor: Reclaiming Moroccan Elegance.,"We’ve been taught that to look sharp, you have to be buttoned up, cinched in, and slightly uncomfortable. We think the Italian suit is the only blueprint for a refined man. So, we spend our lives in stiff collars and tight silhouettes, trying to fit a definition of class that wasn't built for our lifestyle or our values.

But there is a different kind of elegance. One that doesn't require you to sacrifice your comfort or your identity.

I’m talking about the Moroccan Thobe, specifically the Gandora and the Djellaba.

At Furqan, we don’t look at Moroccan craftsmanship as ethnic wear. We see it as the ultimate expression of Quiet Authority.

# The Architecture of the Sfifa

What makes the Moroccan style unique isn't just the cut; it’s the Sfifa-the intricate, handmade braiding that runs down the chest and sleeves.

In a landscape dominated by mass produced fast fashion, the Sfifa is a quiet, firm rejection of the disposable culture. It is a deliberate, handmade detail that calls for a slower, more intentional pace. When you wear a garment that carries that level of geometric precision, you aren’t just putting on clothes. You are carrying a lineage.

1. **The Fluid Silhouette:** Unlike the sharp, stiff lines of a Saudi Thobe, the Moroccan Gandora is about fluidity. It allows for movement. It provides a sense of Sakinah (tranquility) while maintaining a broad, commanding presence.
2. **The Qob (The Hood):** On a Djellaba, the hood is your mobile sanctuary. In the middle of a loud, chaotic street in Toronto or London, pulling up the Qob is a psychological reset. It’s a boundary. It tells the world: I am here, but I am centered.
3. **The Texture:** True Moroccan elegance relies on the hand of the fabric. We use heavy, woven materials that have a tactile richness. It feels like a physical manifestation of your convictions.

# The Restoration of the Self-Image

The External Crisis we face is the feeling that our tradition is too much for the modern world. We worry that a Moroccan silhouette is too loud for a coffee shop or a university campus.

But the reality is the opposite. People respect a man who is anchored.

When you step out in a Furqanwear Moroccan-style garment built with the weight and quality of a premium overcoat, the looks you get aren't out of judgment. They are out of curiosity. You are showing the world a version of masculinity that is dignified, calm, and unapologetic.

# The Furqan Guarantee: No Imports, No Gambles

The reason most brothers avoid the Moroccan style is the Import Gamble. You order a Djellaba from a random site, wait two months, and it arrives looking like a flimsy costume.

We ended that.

Furqan is a Toronto-based fulfillment hub. We hold our own stock right here in Canada. We oversee the quality control. When you decide to claim your Uniform of Honor, you receive a garment that meets the standards of a high-end boutique, delivered with the speed of a local brand.

Stop Blending In.

The world has enough men trying to look like everyone else. It’s starving for men who are rooted.

I like taking time to build characters, talk through ideas, and just hang out while we shape the story together, OOC is essential for me to build that connection.


Here are a few plot ideas to give you a sense of what I’m after:

SOL Ideas

Unexpected Roommates
Two strangers end up sharing a place because rent is ridiculous. They start off just trying to coexist, but shared routines and late‑night conversations slowly turn into something more.

The Coffee Shop Regular
He always orders the same thing. She’s the new barista who notices the little habits he doesn’t think anyone pays attention to. A quiet, everyday kind of romance built on small moments.

Fake Dating That Stops Being Fake
They agree to pretend to date for a family event, work situation, or some other social mess. It’s supposed to be temporary, but the line between acting and reality gets blurry.

Bridgerton‑Style Regency Romance

The Season’s Most Surprising Match
Set in a Bridgerton‑inspired world — ballrooms, gossip, pressure to marry well. He’s a reserved gentleman with a reputation for being hard to impress. She’s new to the season and not interested in playing by society’s expectations. One dance turns into a connection neither of them planned on.

Fantasy Romance Idea

The Mage and the Warrior
A disciplined warrior is assigned to protect a brilliant but stubborn mage whose research could change the fate of the kingdom. They clash at first, but danger forces them to rely on each other, and trust slowly turns into something deeper.

If any of these sound interesting — or if you’ve got ideas of your own — feel free to DM me. I’d love to build something together.
