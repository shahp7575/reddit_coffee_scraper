i'd love to hear your take on this for future reference

i'm traveling for two months right after meeting an amazing woman with whom i really connected. conversations, energy and sex are awesome between us. it was supposed to be casual, but as i said we really connected and it's mutual.  a conventional relationship is not possible between us, bc she's in an open long distance relationship and will be back to her country in august. and it's okay

the thing is that i was really thinking about her on this first week away and decided to reached yesterday with a pic of a coffee shop from her hometown, asking how she was

she commented on the pic and sent me a pic of her on the beach, saying she's been enjoying the sun a lot. then, after a few minutes, she sent me a one time view pic of her with friends coming home after a party and asked, with curiosity, how my week has been

so far, so good

but i got myself feeling stupid for reaching out when, rationally, i know i shouldn't be investing into this. moreover, i feel icky toward myself for initiating communication so soon and now i just want to disappear, honestly

bc of this emotional reaction, i'm gonna back alllll the way now and keep focusing on meeting ladies where i'm at

but would like to hear what you guys would do in such situation, so i don't make the same mistakes next time

I’ve been on a fixed-term contract (CDD) since January, working as a legal assistant in a law firm. I accepted the position because I really wanted to work in this field, even though I don’t have formal legal training (just a bit of experience in a notary’s office).

Context:

📋 How I got here:
	•	In October, I interviewed for an assistant position. I didn’t get it.
	•	Three months later, the firm contacted me again to ask if I was still interested.
	•	They mentioned a 6-month contract for a “more general” role, without a job description or clear details.

At no point did they say this was a long-term position or that it could lead to a permanent contract. (But at the end of my trial period, someone casually hinted that things were going well and they’d like me to stay long-term.)

I accepted because I was highly motivated to work in this field. I commute a lot (almost €150 in gas per month), which I normally wouldn’t do.
Salary: €2,000 gross/month.

🛠️ What I do now:
	•	At first, I worked directly with a lawyer for two months (it went well and was very interesting).
	•	Then, after an internal reorganization, I was moved to reception, where I’ve been ever since. (They didn’t really ask me, and they announced it to everyone during a coffee break.)
	•	I handle phone calls, general emails, and random tasks others don’t want or don’t have time to do. Basically, I’m getting disillusioned…
	•	I’m only in charge of family court (JAF) files, which represent a small portion of the firm’s caseload.
	•	I now do so few legal tasks that I feel like I’m regressing, not learning, and losing the skills I had at the beginning.

💬 Annual review = cold shower:

I expressed my disappointment:
	•	This is not the job I imagined
	•	I feel like I’m picking up the crumbs left by others
	•	I’d prefer to manage some cases from A to Z, with real responsibilities
	•	And if I’m going to be at the front desk, I’d at least like reception hours: finishing at 4 p.m. on Fridays, maybe even earlier some days

Their response?
No real discussion about my work. They didn’t want to share their point of view during the review. It was very one-sided…

Two days later, after I asked for feedback following that review:
	•	They offered me a renewal of the 6-month contract (wait, what??)
	•	Gave me responsibility for labor law cases (even though the firm barely handles any)
	•	And agreed to let me finish at 4 p.m. on Fridays

Their justification:
“The firm is growing, we don’t know how things will go with the trainee lawyers who’ve signed permanent contracts for the fall (and who’ve also been here for months), we’re figuring things out as we go, so we’re offering you another fixed-term contract.”

(Whaaaaaaat??)

⚖️ If I accept:
	•	I’ll still have no job description, no clear manager, no recognition
	•	I’ll have no benefits (unlike colleagues on permanent contracts): no bonus, no staff committee perks, no remote work, no paid vacation… NOTHING
	•	And if they offer me a permanent contract in 6 months and I turn it down, I lose:
	•	the end-of-contract bonus (10%)
	•	and I’ll have spent a year in a precarious role with nothing concrete at the end

❓Your thoughts?

I’m discouraged. I feel like they’re taking advantage of the fact that I’m new and untrained, keeping me in a low-value role.
At the same time, I wonder if I should stay another 6 months to “see how it goes.”

Are these kinds of practices common?
Would I be missing an opportunity by saying no?
Or am I right to set a boundary and look for a clearer and more respectful job?

Thanks in advance for your feedback 🙏

If you are the average guy, this is probably what you'll end up with. If you want hotter women, then my advice would be:

- be better looking

- have more charisma

- meet in person instead of through apps (women deeply distrust dating apps, and there is a 3 men: 1 woman ratio on dating apps)

- spend more time per woman, expect to spend longer to stumble across one (hot women are literally just rarer than average women), and try to focus on women you have things in common with (women value a deeper connection more than men, even for flings)",0,1749499438.0,datingadviceformen,1,0.5,False

1l7euuh,https://www.reddit.com/r/cuck_femdom_tales/comments/1l7euuh/how_it_started_pt_5/,How it started pt 5,"The weeks following Mara’s decision to let Elliot back into the bedroom were a precarious balance, a tightrope stretched over a chasm of her rules and his fragile hope. Elliot clung to her commands with a desperate precision, wearing only the panties and cage inside the house—today, a pair of soft lavender cotton with a delicate lace trim, the metal cage a cold, unyielding weight beneath. He moved through their shared spaces with a quiet reverence, his eyes averted from the bedroom door, his hands busy with chores to prove his devotion. He brewed her coffee each morning, folded her laundry with care, and kept the house spotless, hoping each act might chip away at the distance between them. But Mara’s gaze was unrelenting, her vigilance a constant pressure. She found fault in the smallest missteps—a shirt folded unevenly, a dish left in the sink, a moment when his eyes lingered too long near the bathroom door. Each infraction brought consequences, swift and unyielding.

One evening, after Elliot left a streak on the kitchen counter while cleaning, Mara’s eyes narrowed, her voice sharp. “You can’t even wipe a counter properly, Elliot?” she said, her tone laced with exasperation. She pointed to the living room, her hand steady. “Over the couch. Now.” Elliot’s heart sank, but he obeyed, bending over the arm of the couch, the lavender panties snug against his skin, the cage shifting slightly as he braced himself. Mara’s palm met his backside with a sharp crack, the sting radiating through the thin fabric. She didn’t speak, her strikes deliberate, each one a lesson in her control. Five, ten, fifteen—the pain built, his skin hot, his breath ragged. When she stopped, her voice was calm but firm. “Do better,” she said, leaving him to stand, his legs shaky, the shame burning deeper than the pain.

Another night, when he hesitated too long before leaving the room as she changed, Mara banished him to the couch without a word. The bedroom door locked with a click, and he lay in the dark, the scratchy fabric of the couch a stark contrast to the warmth of their bed. Her moans drifted through the walls, the hum of her newest dildo—a ten-inch black monster—punctuating her cries. Each sound was a reminder of her pleasure, a world he was excluded from, the cage and panties a barrier he couldn’t cross. He clung to her small moments of kindness—her hand brushing his when he passed her a mug, her rare smile when he cooked her favorite pasta—but they were fleeting, overshadowed by her relentless standards.

One night, after a particularly intense session with her toy, Mara’s cries reached a fever pitch, her screams echoing through the house, raw and unfiltered. Elliot lay on the couch, his heart pounding, waiting for her call to join her in bed, the privilege she’d granted only when her pleasure was sated. But the call didn’t come. The silence stretched, heavy and unfamiliar, and a knot of fear tightened in his chest. Had he done something wrong again? Had he missed a rule, a task? Driven by worry, he crept toward the bedroom door, his bare feet silent on the hardwood. As he reached for the handle, a sound stopped him—Mara’s voice, low and intimate, not the cadence of pleasure but of conversation. She was on the phone, her words muffled but deliberate, a soft laugh breaking through. “Yeah, I know,” she said, her tone warm, almost playful. “Soon, maybe.” Elliot’s hand froze, his breath catching. Who was she talking to? The intimacy in her voice, the ease he hadn’t heard in months, twisted something inside him. He backed away, retreating to the couch, his mind racing but too afraid to question her.

Weeks passed, and the pattern held. Mara’s late-night phone calls became a ritual, her voice drifting through the walls, sometimes teasing, sometimes serious, always private. Elliot remained on the couch, the bedroom door locked, her moans mingling with the hum of her toys most nights, but the calls were new, a secret she didn’t share. He wanted to ask, to understand who held her attention, but fear kept him silent. Her rules were absolute, her anger a storm he couldn’t face again. He doubled his efforts—scrubbing the house, checking her laundry, ensuring the cage and panties were always in place—but the distance grew, her eyes often elsewhere, her thoughts a mystery.

One evening, as the sky darkened with an autumn chill, a knock came at the door. Elliot was in the kitchen, rinsing dishes, wearing only a pair of soft pink cotton panties with a small white bow, the cage a familiar weight. Mara emerged from the bedroom, her hair loose, her body draped in a fitted black dress that hugged her curves, a rare departure from her usual loose sweaters. Her eyes glinted with something new—anticipation, perhaps, or resolve. “Answer it,” she said, her voice calm but commanding, a faint smirk tugging at her lips. Elliot froze, his hands dripping with suds. “Mara, I’m… I’m just in—” he started, gesturing to the panties, but her gaze sharpened, cutting him off. “I said answer it,” she repeated, her tone unyielding. “Now.” His face burned, shame and fear coiling in his gut, but he obeyed, wiping his hands and walking to the door, the panties clinging to his skin, the cage a cold reminder of his vulnerability.

He opened the door to find a man standing there—tall, broad-shouldered, his frame filling the doorway. He had a chiseled jaw, dark hair cropped close, and eyes that scanned Elliot with a mix of amusement and disdain. His lips curled into a laugh, sharp and unapologetic, as he took in Elliot’s appearance—the pink panties, the cage faintly visible beneath, the flush of embarrassment on his face. “Well, damn,” the man said, his voice deep, a chuckle rumbling through it. “This the guy you were talking about, Mara?” Elliot’s heart sank, his eyes dropping to the floor, but Mara’s voice came from behind him, cool and confident. “That’s him,” she said, stepping forward, her presence commanding the room. “Elliot, this is Mark.”

Mark’s laugh deepened, his eyes raking over Elliot once more before he stepped inside, brushing past him without a second glance. Mara moved to meet him, her movements fluid, deliberate. Their eyes locked, and the air shifted, charged with a raw, unspoken energy. Mark’s hand found Mara’s waist, pulling her close, and they kissed—a kiss that was hungry, unreserved, a clash of lips and breath that filled the room with its intensity. Mara’s hands slid up his chest, fingers curling into his shirt, tugging him closer as their mouths moved together, her lips parting to meet his tongue, a soft moan escaping her throat. Her body pressed against his, her curves molding to his frame, the black dress stretching taut as she arched into him. Mark’s hands roamed, one gripping her hip, the other sliding up her back, fingers tangling in her hair as he deepened the kiss, his teeth grazing her lower lip. The sound of their breaths, sharp and quick, mingled with the faint wet click of their lips, a rhythm that drowned out everything else. Elliot stood frozen, the door still open behind him, the sight searing into his mind—Mara’s abandon, the way her body responded, alive and open in a way it hadn’t been for him in years.

Mara pulled back, her lips flushed, her eyes bright with a fire Elliot hadn’t seen in months. She didn’t look at him, her focus entirely on Mark. “Come on,” she said, her voice low, a sultry edge to it, and took his hand, leading him toward the bedroom. The door closed behind them, the lock clicking with a finality that echoed in Elliot’s chest. He stood there, the pink panties a soft cage, the metal one a heavier weight, his heart pounding as the reality sank in. Mara had chosen this, had invited Mark into their home, into her body, while he stood outside, bound by her rules.
The sounds began almost immediately, raw and unrestrained, spilling through the bedroom door. Mara’s moans were louder than ever, a crescendo of pleasure that shook Elliot to his core. “Oh, fuck, Mark,” she gasped, her voice thick with need, the words punctuated by the rhythmic creak of the bed. “Harder—yes, like that!” The sounds were explicit, unfiltered—a slap of skin against skin, the wet, slick rhythm of their bodies moving together, Mara’s cries rising in pitch, raw and desperate. “God, you’re so big,” she moaned, the words a dagger to Elliot’s heart, a stark comparison to her mocking taunts about his “pathetic little thing.” The bedframe groaned, a steady thump-thump-thump that matched the pace of their fucking, Mark’s low grunts joining her screams. “Take it, Mara,” he growled, his voice rough, commanding, and she answered with a wail, “Yes, yes, fuck me!” The sounds painted a vivid picture—her body arching under his, her legs spread wide, the black dress likely hiked up or discarded, her panties—perhaps the soft white cotton she’d worn that morning—tossed aside. The wet sounds grew louder, a slick, relentless rhythm, her moans peaking in a scream that tore through the house, a sound of pure, unbridled release. “I’m coming!” she cried, her voice breaking, followed by Mark’s guttural groan, the bedframe shuddering one final time before falling silent.

Elliot sank to the floor, his back against the wall, the pink panties and cage a humiliating weight. The sounds had blown his mind, a brutal confirmation of Mara’s desire, now fully alive but belonging to another. Her pleasure was no longer a private act with her toys but a shared, visceral reality with Mark, a man who laughed at Elliot’s submission, who took what Elliot could only dream of. The shame burned, but so did a strange, aching awe—Mara’s power, her unapologetic claim to her own body, was absolute. He was outside her world now, a witness to her ecstasy, bound by her rules and his own failures. The bedroom door remained locked, the silence that followed heavier than the cries, and Elliot sat there, the weight of the panties, the cage, and her rejection pressing down, a new reality settling in: Mara’s desire was alive, but it was no longer his to share.

The morning after Mark’s arrival, the house felt smaller, the air thick with a new tension. Elliot woke on the couch, the pink cotton panties and cage a familiar weight, his body stiff from the night’s restless sleep. The bedroom door opened, and Mark stepped out, naked, his presence filling the hallway. His cock, heavy and thick, swung with each step, a stark contrast to Elliot’s caged state. It was impossible to ignore—long, veined, and unapologetically prominent, it drew Elliot’s gaze despite his efforts to look away. Mark’s lips curled into a knowing laugh, his eyes glinting with amusement as he noticed Elliot’s struggle. “Eyes up here, man,” he said, his voice deep, teasing, but with an edge of authority. Elliot flushed, his face burning, and forced his gaze to Mark’s face. “Sorry,” he mumbled, his voice barely audible. Mark chuckled again, unbothered, and leaned against the kitchen counter. “Mara says I’m staying the week,” he announced, his tone casual but commanding. “You’re on meals and cleaning. Laundry too—our stuff’ll be outside the bedroom door. Keep up, yeah?” He grinned, his cock still swaying slightly as he moved, and Elliot nodded, his throat tight, the weight of his submission sinking deeper.

The days settled into a humiliating rhythm. Elliot cooked breakfast, lunch, and dinner, his hands trembling as he prepared plates for Mara and Mark. He knocked on the bedroom door to deliver meals, waiting for Mara’s soft “Come in” before entering. Inside, Mara was always in a baggy sweatshirt, its loose fabric swallowing her frame, her legs bare or in sweatpants, her body a fortress even in Mark’s presence. Mark, by contrast, was usually naked, sprawled on the bed or leaning against the headboard, his cock resting against his thigh, a constant, mocking presence. Elliot kept his eyes down, setting the trays on the nightstand, the cage and panties—today, soft white cotton with a scalloped edge—a reminder of his place. Dirty laundry piled up outside the bedroom door—Mark’s boxers, Mara’s sweatshirts, and occasionally her panties, soft cotton in muted colors, a sight that stirred a forbidden ache in Elliot. He washed them carefully, folding each item with precision, his hands lingering on her things, guilt mingling with longing.

The sounds from the bedroom were relentless. Every night, Mara’s moans filled the house, raw and unrestrained, punctuated by Mark’s grunts and the rhythmic creak of the bed. “Fuck, Mark, yes!” she’d cry, her voice breaking with pleasure, the wet slap of their bodies a vivid soundtrack. Elliot lay on the couch, the lavender lace panties he wore tonight clinging to his skin, the cage tightening as his body responded uselessly to her cries. Mark’s voice would cut through, low and commanding—“Take it, Mara, just like that”—followed by her screams, peaking in a shuddering climax that left the house silent, heavy with the weight of her pleasure. Elliot’s heart pounded, the sounds painting a picture he could only imagine, his exclusion a sharp, aching truth.
On the third day, the routine broke. Elliot prepared lunch—grilled sandwiches, Mara’s favorite, with a side of fruit—and knocked on the bedroom door, his hands steady despite the nervous flutter in his chest. He thought he heard a muffled “Enter,” the sound faint through the door. He turned the handle, stepping inside, the tray balanced carefully. But the sight before him stopped him cold. Mara knelt on the bed, her body bare except for a black lace bra and matching panties, the fabric sheer, hugging her curves, her skin glowing in the dim light. Her lips were wrapped around Mark’s huge cock, the thick length glistening as she moved, her head bobbing with a slow, deliberate rhythm. Mark leaned back, his hands tangled in her hair, guiding her, a low groan escaping his throat. The wet sounds of her mouth, the faint pop as she pulled back, filled the room, her panties shifting slightly as she adjusted her position, the lace stretched taut over her hips. Elliot froze, the tray trembling in his hands, his eyes locked on the scene—Mara’s intimacy, her abandon, a world he was no longer part of.

Mara’s eyes snapped to him, her mouth stilling, Mark’s cock slipping from her lips with a slick sound. Her face twisted with fury, a storm breaking in her gaze. “Elliot!” she screamed, her voice raw, venomous. She scrambled to her feet, grabbing a sweatshirt from the floor and pulling it over her bra, her panties still visible, a stark reminder of her boundaries. “What the fuck are you doing? I didn’t say come in!” Her voice shook with rage, her hands clenched into fists. Mark sat up, his cock still hard, a smirk playing on his lips as he watched the scene unfold. Elliot stammered, the tray clattering to the floor, sandwiches spilling across the carpet. “I—I thought you said enter, I’m sorry—” But Mara cut him off, storming toward him, her eyes blazing. “You thought wrong!” she shouted, her finger jabbing at his chest. “You don’t just walk in here! My body, my space—you don’t get to see this!” Her voice cracked, tears of anger glinting in her eyes. She turned to Mark, her chest heaving. “He needs to learn, Mark. Punish him. Now.”

Mark’s smirk widened, a glint of amusement in his eyes as he stood, his naked body towering, his cock still half-hard, swinging slightly as he moved. “You heard her,” he said, his voice low, commanding, a trace of mockery in it. “Over the bed, Elliot. Face down.” Elliot’s heart pounded, shame and fear flooding him, but Mara’s glare left no room for defiance. He shuffled to the bed, the white cotton panties clinging to his skin, the cage a cold weight, and bent over the edge, his face buried in the sheets, the scent of Mara and Mark’s intimacy lingering in the fabric. Mark stepped behind him, his presence looming, and Mara stood nearby, her arms crossed, her sweatshirt barely covering her panties, her eyes unyielding.
“Count,” Mark said, his voice sharp, and before Elliot could respond, the first blow landed—a hard, open-handed slap against his backside, the sting searing through the thin cotton. Elliot gasped, his body tensing. “One,” he choked out, his voice muffled by the sheets. Another strike, harder, the pain radiating, the cage shifting with the impact. “Two,” he whispered, his hands gripping the sheets. Mark’s blows were relentless, each one a thunderclap, the rhythm steady, unyielding. “Three… four… five…” Elliot counted, his voice breaking, the panties offering little protection, his skin hot and stinging. Mara watched, her expression a mix of anger and resolve, her bra straps peeking from under the sweatshirt, a reminder of the intimacy he’d violated. At ten, Mark paused, his hand resting on Elliot’s back, his voice low. “You get it now, Elliot? Her body’s not yours to see.” Elliot nodded, tears stinging his eyes, his throat tight. “Yes,” he whispered. “I’m sorry, Mara.” Mark delivered one final blow, the hardest yet, and Elliot cried out, “Eleven,” his body trembling.

Mara stepped closer, her voice
 cold but steady. “You don’t walk in without permission,” she said, her eyes boring into his. “You don’t look at me, ever, unless I say so. and you don’t come near this room unless I call you. Understand?” Elliot nodded, his face burning, his body aching. “I understand,” he said, his voice barely audible. Mark stepped back, his cock still prominent, a faint smirk on his face as he glanced at Mara. “Good call,” he said, his tone approving, and she nodded, her anger softening but not gone. “Get out,” she told Elliot, pointing to the door. He stood, his legs shaky, and shuffled out, the tray forgotten on the floor, the sting of the spanking and Mara’s fury a heavy weight. The bedroom door closed behind him, the lock clicking, and soon the sounds resumed—Mara’s moans, Mark’s grunts, the wet rhythm of their bodies, a stark reminder of her pleasure, her power, and his place outside it all.",1,1749499308.0,cuck_femdom_tales,0,1.0,False

I have seen and heard numerous problems as to why it's best that she doesn't go there anymore, so I have told the grandparents that she isn't to go this establishment anymore but your welcome to take her somewhere else. 

Well you'd think I'd s**t on there living room floor, my mother is claiming she won't have my child any more if she can't take her to this establishment iv asked why does it need to be there and all I'm told is ""I like it there"", the other grandparent has said if you don't like it then find someone else to look after your child. 

There is nothing special about this eating establishment its just a cafe that serves food nothing more, its just not safe (easy access out the front door to a main road, kitchen has no door so daughter can wander in (which has), blind spots where they bring tea and coffee and there's been many close calls with kids. 

A back door that leads out on to the main road again left wide open. 

I don't think the place is safe so all I have asked is not to go there and just take her else where, so now I have 2 angry grandparents who want to take my daughter somewhere we don't wish her to go and they want to call the shots.

1l7es24,https://i.redd.it/axjzdre5jy5f1.jpeg,Would you drill and fill these stained spots?,"TLDR: have had some amount of staining on back of these top front teeth for at least 10 years, no cavities showing up on most recent December 2024 X-rays, was told today (June 2025) they should be filled since they are close to the nerve and teeth are thin in this area. Asked if explorer sticks in these spots and was told no but still could be lots of decay once dentist drills...

Further background:
Have been a patient at 5 dental practices in 10 years due to frequent moves. I remember only one dentist mentioning they would watch these spots back in 2015 or so. No other dentist has mentioned them to me at all. Had X-rays and a full new patient eval at my current practice in December 2024, no mention of these spots. Saw a different dentist at the same practice today (the practice owner) and he wants to preventatively drill and fill. When I asked if the explorer is sticking in these spots or if they showed up on X-ray in December 2024, he said no. His reasoning for filling is that he's been practicing 25 years and he frequently sees asymptomatic spots like these turn into cavities and quickly affect the nerve due to proximity. 

I am skeptical it's a money grab since I take good care of my teeth and have never needed work outside of the odd tiny filling. I am prone to deep grooves and pits however (and also drink a lot of coffee, lol).

Am currently pregnant and dentist recommended waiting until after baby is born to do the fillings, so I'm deciding what to do. 

Considering getting another opinion, not sure whether to do it before or after I have this baby since they won't be able to do x-rays while I'm pregnant? I don't mind getting necessary treatment....am I overthinking? What would you recommend? I try to be very careful with my teeth and am probably more wary than the average person of unnecessary drilling, but I'll move forward if the treatment plan seems reasonable.",1,1749499136.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

“I know, Mom. I'm in front of the café. Call you later!” Emmanuel Lowe hung up on his mother impatiently.

The twenty-eight-year-old man had never been in a relationship.

After spending seven years in the army, he retired from the military and worked at a hospital in Yeringham for three years.

He was a gynecologist at the hospital and made eighty thousand a year.

Worried he would end up old and alone, Emmanuel's mother urged him to settle down. Since he had no idea where to begin when it came to dating, his mother took matters into her own hands and set him up on multiple blind dates.

Thanks to her efforts, he had gone on seventeen blind dates so far.

Alas, wedding bells were clearly not on the horizon for Emmanuel. It was frustrating. He knew he was just going through the motions at that point.

“Help! Someone help me!”

Right before Emmanuel entered the café, he heard someone calling out weakly for help.

The cries came from an old man who had fallen on the roadside. Many pedestrians walked past him, but no one dared to stop and help him to his feet.

After all, helping the old man could be more trouble than it was worth if one ended up with an expensive lawsuit for injuring him further. No one would do something that risky and foolish.

It did not deter Emmanuel from stepping forward and helping the man to his feet. He asked, “Are you all right, sir?”

“I'm fine! Thank you so much, young man! It's so hard to find people as kind as you these days. I must repay you for your kindness!” replied the old man with a smile.

Emmanuel realized then that the old man's attire was at odds with his airs. Despite his tattered clothes, the old man's clean hands looked like those of a man accustomed to wealth.

Still, he had no time to satisfy his curiosity. After confirming that the old man was unharmed, Emmanuel rushed into the café for his blind date. He never once considered being repaid for his kind act earlier.

The café was massive and practically structured like a maze.

Emmanuel's mother mentioned that his blind date was seated at table number eight. He wandered through the confusing café, but before he could locate the correct table, he stumbled into a special area.

The lighting was softer there, and the floor was scattered with fresh petals.

The sweet scent of flowers wafted through the air. He wondered if he had set foot in heaven.

Emmanuel raised his eyes and immediately froze.

A beautiful, elegant woman sat before a table in the room.

It was no exaggeration to say she embodied perfection itself.

The heavens clearly decided to shower all their favors on her.

The woman quietly sipped her coffee with her legs crossed neatly to the side. On the table was a non-translated copy of The Power Broker.

When she noticed Emmanuel barging into the room, she looked up at him in confusion and disgust.

Thump! Thump! Thump!

When Emmanuel recovered from the shock of stumbling upon the beautiful stranger, he realized his heart was about to beat its way out of his chest.

Never once had he ever felt so attracted to a woman in his twenty-eight years of life.

The countless female bodies he had seen in his work as a gynecologist hardly appealed to him. At some point, he even wondered if he was attracted to women at all.

Against all odds, it seemed, the young woman before him made his heart race like a runaway horse.

Am I simply nervous, or am I already attracted to her?

More surprisingly, Emmanuel noticed a large number eight sign on the woman's table.

She's my blind date?

He took a deep breath to calm himself before approaching her table and taking a seat opposite her.

The young woman's expression grew increasingly flabbergasted. There was even a hint of hostility in her pretty eyes.

The audacity of this man! Barging into my private room is bad enough, but he's going to sit opposite me like it's nobody's business?

Emmanuel ignored her expression. It was not the first time a woman had scoffed at him.

They were free to go their separate ways after getting the blind date done and over with.

He introduced himself, declaring, “Hi! My name is Emmanuel Lowe. I'm twenty-eight years old, and I work as a gynecologist. I make eighty thousand a year and don't own a car or a house.”

Any man would need an incredible amount of courage to say such things to a woman, but Emmanuel appeared unusually calm and unfazed.

The young woman stared at him in shock. A moment later, her lips curved into a smirk, and she replied with an introduction of her own.

“Nice to meet you. I'm Mackenzie Quillen. I'm twenty-seven years old with dual doctorates in finance and business administration from Harvard University. I made three billion last year, and I have a car and a house.”

Emmanuel was stunned.

What the heck is happening?

He always thought women on blind dates came with red flags.

Mackenzie, however, was arguably flawless.

Where's the catch? Perhaps she's mental? Or crippled? Or infertile?

All sorts of fantastical theories filled Emmanuel's mind.

Mackenzie smirked at his perplexed expression. The pride in her cool gaze was evident.

She deliberately introduced herself to put the stranger in a difficult spot and intimidate him into retreating.

As expected, awkward silence lingered in the air after her words.

Urgh, forget it!

Whether Mackenzie was telling the truth was beside the point. Emmanuel decided to go through all the motions so he could at least mollify his mother, even if the date did not result in a trip to the altar.

He declared, “I don't make much, but if you decide to date me, I promise I'll always protect and cherish you. I'll take over all the household chores so you can be a queen at home. Of course, I hope you'll allow me to preserve my masculine pride in front of my family. If we do get married, I can give you about five to six thousand every month.”

It was a well-worn script that Emmanuel recited in a single breath.

Mackenzie was dumbfounded at his earnest expression and apparent lack of shame at his much lower salary.

A long while later, she burst into a chuckle.

She had never met a man who could humor her so.

“What are you laughing about?” Unimpressed by her reaction, Emmanuel continued, “I know I don't check all the boxes, but I promise I'll be a good and responsible husband if we're married!”

Pfft!

Mackenzie failed to keep in her snigger.

An annoyed Emmanuel demanded, “Why are you laughing, Ms. Quillen? Don't you think you're being rather rude?”

“Sir, you're a very good man!” Mackenzie stopped smiling and retorted coldly, “But I think you're the confused one here. I'm not here for a blind date!”

Huh? What is going on?

Emmanuel's eyes widened in horror as he sputtered, “Isn't this table number eight?”

“Yes, but this is the VIP area. You must be looking for table number eight in the common dining area. Please go out and turn right!” She pointed a slender finger at the exit.

“I... Sorry! I'm so sorry! I mixed things up!”

Emmanuel wished he could sink into the floor in embarrassment. He jumped to his feet, ready to make a hasty escape.

That was so embarrassing! How could I sit at the wrong table for a blind date? No wonder she was laughing so much. She must have thought I was shooting above my weight!

Shortly after Emmanuel's departure, an old man entered Mackenzie's private room, escorted by four black-clad bodyguards.

Emmanuel would have been astonished if he was still around. The old man was none other than the stranger he had helped earlier in front of the café!

He implored, “Perhaps this is fate, Mackenzie. You're twenty-seven, but you've never been in a relationship because of your misandry. No man would dare come near you! But that young man succeeded! He's also a kind and just person. A while ago, he helped me outside the café and didn't expect a reward for his actions!”

The old man's true identity was Terence Quillen, chairman of Yeringham's premier financial corporation.

While his wealth could trump that of entire nations, he had a major regret in life.

Terence had had three sons who tragically passed away before him. They either had no children of their own or only left daughters behind.

Mackenzie was Terence's favorite granddaughter and next-in-line to helm Terence Group.

Her intelligence and charisma did not change the fact that she was a woman.

Before Terence met his maker, he wished his favorite granddaughter could give him a great-grandchild.

That spurred him to fake his fall in front of the café and scout a decent man for his granddaughter. To his surprise, the young man who helped him earlier made a blunder of his own blind date and ended up meeting Mackenzie instead.

Isn't that fate?

Mackenzie remained stoically unmoved by her grandfather's words. “Grandpa, he may have passed your test, but he hasn't passed mine. I'll marry him if he aces my test.”

She wanted to fulfill her grandfather's wish, but she naturally wished to promise herself to a good man.

Marrying a man after one blind date was simply too hasty and careless.

Terence's gaze lit up expectantly, and he replied, “All right! I'm sure he will pass your test!”",1,1749498877.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

He’s younger—early 30s, though looks more like 35—handsome, fit, charismatic, and charming. He’s from a Latin American country, so our sessions have a fun, flirty vibe. He’s naturally hands-on as a trainer, but lately, I’ve felt like there might be mutual attraction.

I know his job is partly to make me feel good so I keep coming back. But in the past few weeks, something feels different. I’m posting here because I don’t want to embarrass myself! Does he like me, or just being a great trainer?

A few things to note:

– Language barrier: He doesn’t speak English, and I speak limited Spanish (currently in an intensive course).  
– He’s been extra affectionate lately: hand on my lower back, arm around me, laid his head on my shoulder.  
– I don’t see how he interacts with other clients, so I can’t compare.  
– He’s told me a few times that my body is looking good.  
– He likes my workout Instagram stories (I post maybe once a week).  
– He’s told me he’s single and wants a relationship.  
– Once, I caught him on his phone during a session and he said he was filming me and would send it (he didn’t).  
– I told him my sessions with him are the highlight of my week. He suggested we get a coffee sometime.

But then:

– He checks his phone during sessions (not constantly, but I notice).  
– I tried setting up a session outside the gym, and he never followed up.  
– He once said my friend was pretty (from an IG story).  
– Our texts are strictly about scheduling though they are friendly and flirty.

I’m super into him but avoidant by nature. I want to take a risk but don’t want to make things awkward. There’s a big age gap. I’m more cute-librarian and he's a hot-jock. So: does he like me? Or is this just business?

TL;DR: I (44F) go to a younger trainer who’s been flirty and affectionate, and recently suggested coffee. Is he into me or keeping a client happy?",0,1749498800.0,AskMenAdvice,17,0.33,False

1l7eklw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1l7eklw/have_the_mormons_gone_woke/,Have the MORMONS gone WOKE?!,"While learning about the Church from two teenage Elders they surprised me by how Liberal they are, which is not the impression I ever got about Mormons from American pop culture. Now that I'm baptized and in a YSA Ward it is getting harder and harder to ignore the Liberalism in this congregation.

For example when the lead Elder asked what got me interested in the Church (I approached them first) I said that as an American I appreciated that the Prophet Joseph Smith was American and revealed so much about this land's history and destiny. He derisively responded that the LDS is international and don't put America above other Nations.

While investigating at a Sunday service I attended I was greeted by another investigator who was a man that identified as a woman. I thought that this ""Trans"" identity went against the Church teachings in the Family Proclamation and other writings on the nature of our eternal spirits. I asked to speak to the Elders in an empty side room and once inside told them that I could not accept a Transgender identity as being True and Righteous. The lead Elder, the 19 year old, told me that it is not our place to judge others and God doesn't make mistakes.

The Bishop at the YSA I attend gave a half-hearted talk that implied support of Palestine when he said that, we know from history Jesus didn't look like a Norwegian (white) men's-fashion model but he probably looked like a poor Palestinian. Another student gave a testimony about how much in common we have with Muslims and the Latter-Day Saints are about love not hate (ironic since Muslims, especially the converts out of Baltimore, include some of the most hateful people I've ever seen. Fundamentalist Islam seems deliberately designed to inspire violent bigotry).

I didn't decide to get Baptized and start pay tithing so I could hear the same rhetoric I could hear at Red Emma's the pinko-hipster coffee ""infoshop"" down 33rd Street. I was Baptized because I have always known in my spirit that this is God's will for us and for America. The first Mormons I met were when I enlisted in the US Army Corps of Engineers and went through OSUT at Fort Leonardwood. They were the best and most motivated soldiers in my training Company and their example stuck with me through these years and inspired me to truly commit myself and dedicate my efforts to America's TRUE Church. Yet it seems that while my Faith grew over time, from the weak, frail seed left by an unfaithful, broken childhood home to true Faith, the Faith of so many young people born into the Church has withered on the vine in favor of the intellectual arrogance of Liberalism.

I’ve held this to myself for nearly 7 years. I (33M) used to work large corporate job in NYC.  It had an open-layout office, fancy coffee machines, glass walls…..you get it. It was also stuffy as hell, and the majority of people were sterile in personality. 



The bathroom situation was a nightmare. There were only two stalls to service the entire floor, of \~100 people working steadfast at their desks drinking coffee like water and ordering almost exclusively take-out. Disaster.  You’d be lucky to only have to wait 5-10 minutes to get one. You’d look like a fucking shit monster waiting or worse, pacing back and forth from your desk to bathroom hoping to catch a free stall. Will people think I have a small bladder? Or bladder issues? The paranoia would set in.  



One day, I had a world-class burrito for lunch from a new food truck. It came with 3 sauces, each transporting your taste buds to a new level of nirvana, and each hotter than the last. Big mistake. Just 30 minutes after, and my stomach was staging a full-on revolt. I was in a meeting, and managed to hold it down, but in my head I was playing the probabilities of getting a free stall. I knew luck wasn’t on my side. Then a lightbulb went off. Why not go to the executive floor, and use the posh, luxury bathrooms that are ample in supply. No one would have to know, just quickly in, and just as quickly out. Or so I thought….



Once I escaped the meeting, I sprinted to the elevators to make my pilgrimage to the executive bathroom, praying not to run into anyone — or get caught on the elevator with one of my bosses, whom regularly would attend board conferences with companies on that floor. To my amazement, I had succeeded and arrived to the luxury bathroom undetected. I was in the clear…..



But just as I’m handling business, the door swings open, and I hear one of my bosses, waltz in. I know exactly who it is, why?! Because this particular boss would also be whistling or humming, always. I hate whistling. I fucking hate it. But I especially hate it right now. This boss is also the type to make small talk, and draw it out for a prolonged period of time. He would undoubtedly make conversation with me through the stall wall, and worse, likely reprimand me for being on the executive floor ruining the bathroom. He had to know I was in the bathroom — not me specifically — someone, because it smelled foul. So, I go silent, hold my breath, lift my feet, and wait him out.



The problem is he takes fucking FOREVER. He’s brushing his teeth, gargling, having a whole spa day in there. My legs went numb, my stomach’s still angry and I’m in full panic mode thinking my co-workers will be wondering where I am. Finally, he leaves. I finish up, flush, and—horror of horrors—the toilet clogs! Like, doesn’t even pretend to flush. It’s just… there. A fucking crime scene.



I’m generally good under pressure, but I do the unthinkable — I try to flush again hoping for a different outcome. I get one. The water starts to rise, and rise, and fuck! It starts coming out over the bowl onto the floor. So, I make a split-second decision: I make for the door, no time to waste anymore — this just became life or death. I’m sweating, heart racing, imagining HR firing me over this and all my co-workers laughing about the guy who shit-housed the executive floor. 



I skip the elevators. I turn into Jason Bourne, quickly scanning corners, visualizing the layout, concealing myself along the way, until I make it to the stair case. There is one problem with this exit, the doors lock behind you once you enter the stair shaft. I would need either an accomplice to open the door at my floor, that’s much lower than the executive floor, or I would need to go the full extreme and go all the way to the lobby. The latter is more than 40+ floors. That’s time. That’s more time away from my desk. I can’t involve anyone — it’s too risky. I begin my descent, both figuratively and literally.  



Once I hit the ground floor, I come up with a brilliant idea. I go to Starbucks, get a coffee and head back to my floor  Back at my desk, I’m acting casual, but inside I’m spiraling. I make it through the day and head home. Believing I am in the clear. I sleep soundly, having escaped with my neck. I’ll live to fight another day. 



I arrive to work the next day. The bosses are a mixture of angry, and amused. Evidently, the executive floor bathroom was flooded with shit water and required a hazmat team to come and clean up the mess. Fucking hazmat?! What the serious fuck alternate reality am I in. What did I think would happen? Did I endanger lives? Who am I? I do know one thing, I’ve committed to the atrocity and the stakes are too high to come forward now. Apparently, the bosses had suspected someone on the lower floors, primarily the floor I work on and the two below. People had been using the executive bathroom  — they knew because of the elevator key cards going to the executive floor at night. My god. This really is the end for me. They are doing fucking elevator forensics — I will burn for this. We received a talk about what had occurred, and if anyone was involved. They made it out to be some sort of terrorist attack — an Us vs. Them between us lowly workers and the bosses/execs. For a moment, I felt like a warrior for my team, sticking it to the man — but I quickly came back to reality and remembered what this was all about: I had taken the most vile shit and destroyed a bathroom, costing the company heavily monetarily, requiring hazmat, and likely destroying several important meetings with company CEOs. All for what?! A burrito. 



I hear whispers from my co-workers “Who did this?” “The toilet’s destroyed!” “Hazmat had to come, this is serious!” I muster up the courage, and I throw a comment in the ring “Who could do such a thing?” And then, someone dubs it the “Phantom Pooper” incident. People are LIVID. There’s a group chat blowing up, and someone even suggests installing a security camera outside the bathroom.



For weeks, it’s all anyone talks about. I’m in every meeting, nodding along, pretending to be as outraged as everyone else. “Who would DO such a thing?” I say, clutching my coffee and sweating profusely. Meanwhile, I’m dying inside. I start using the Starbucks bathroom across the street to avoid suspicion. I’m constantly paranoid they will discover me using the elevator forensics, I even googled if you can be identified from your shit. I’m losing my mind. 



Luckily, they never found out it was me. The office manager sent a passive-aggressive email about “bathroom etiquette,” and life moved on. But every time someone mentions the Phantom Pooper, I feel my soul leave my body. I quit six months later, partly because I couldn’t handle the paranoia. I’m in a new job now, with better plumbing, but I’ll never eat an unconfirmed food truck burrito again. Some sick part of me enjoys that this happened, I am the Phantom Pooper! 



TL;DR: I clogged the office toilet so bad it became a company legend, pretended it wasn’t me, and lived in fear as the “Phantom Pooper” mystery consumed my workplace. I’ve lost my soul, and metamorphosed into the Phantom Pooper.  ",3,1749498108.0,confession,1,1.0,False

1l7eaxr,https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/1l7eaxr/observations_from_a_nondenominational_rockband/,Observations from a Non-Denominational Rock-Band Church service,"Yesterday, my good friends (who are deeply religious in a megachurchey kind of way) invited me and my wife and daughter to attend one of these modern non-denominational evangelical rock band churches with them while visting a town in a southern US state. I said sure, why not, even though I am agnostic and deeply cynical about churches in general and these modern ones in particular. My 5 year old kid likes the idea of god and praying, so I might as well give her the opportunity to explore it.

For reference, I grew up in a hyper-conservative lutheran church. Doom and gloom, exclusively male-led, strict liturgy, two hundred year old hymns, the works. This church was very, very different than anything I've ever attended, so here are my outsider observations.

* The building is basically a light-industrial pole barn with the only indication that it's a church being a flashy sign tacked above the doors. No traditional adornments - crosses, steeples, stained glass. There was a sick playground outside, though, which is an indicator of things to come.
* Walking through the doors,  I was greeted by several staff wearing t-shirts, shorts, flip flops and name tags. I realized at this point that I was wildly over dressed in my sport jacket and slacks. At least I thought better of wearing a tie. I have never seen a congregation so dressed down. Men wearing graphic tees to church! The women and girl children dressed appropriately, however.
* Upon entering the large vestibule, I am immediately standing in front of a coffee shop selling lattes, mochas, and frappachinos. Everyone is milling around chatting while holding their iced sugar blasters. It reminds me of the stay at home moms that get their Starbucks and hang around Target at 10am on a Tuesday. Apparently these coffee shops are standard at all of these new rock band churches. I opted for a styrafoam cup of drip coffee from the free stand in the corner instead. 
* I immediately am shuffled into a queue with my friends to get our kids signed up for the kid program. I was unaware of this dynamic- I thought the kids just come to the service and suffer through an interminable sermon like God intended. Not so. They get shuttled into various age-appropriate group rooms and spend the morning doing Jesus crafts and playing at the playground. Apparently this is also the absolute standard at all of these new non-denom churches. 
* Upon filing into the actual church room, it looks nothing like a traditional church. It is essentially a concert venue, with what must be at least a half million dollars in A/V equipment. A full stage set up, lights and speakers all over the ceiling, huge LCD screens, and in the back of the room, instead of an organist, there is a team of no less than 5 A/V technicians controlling the concert. There are no pews with kneeling bars and pockets with bibles, hymnals, etc - just plain old event chairs in rows.
* The service kicks off with a 25 minute long soft rock concert. The guys in the band are all mid-30s and have tattoos and wear sweat bands and lots of wrist jewelry. I think to myself that I bet they occasionally have to fire one of these guys for trying to fuck a teenager. The music is technically proficient, but awful in the seemingly unavoidable way that worship rock always is. People begin to sway, many middle aged ladies, even some men, begin holding their hands up, palms out. I think they are touching the lord. I am not.
* After the concert winds down, the pastor comes on stage. He's \~40, shaved bald, ZZ-top beard, full sleeve tattoos, wearing t-shirt, shorts, and flip flops (the male uniform, I am learning). While there is still a ghostly (or heavenly) low hum coming over the speakers for dramatic effect, he begins speaking to us softly and in earnest. He does not open with scripture or prayer, just straight into a 45+ minute long sermon about the importance of fathers and fatherhood and traditional masculinity in the rearing of good kids and for leading healthy households. He leans on statistics about what happens without dads, occasionally throws out some red meat about how the New York Times and the Washington Post don't want traditional men to exist anymore, but he resists the urge to say the word ""libtards"" and only dips a toe into the culture war momentarily and delivers a surprisingly good, positive, and universal message about what it means to be a good man and good father and how important it is to serve not just your own family but your entire community. I actually walked away with some food for thought. Didn't expect to be inspired by a guy in flip flops.
* Upon the conclusion of the sermon, the rock band reassembles and bangs out another worship song and they invite everyone to file up for communion where we collect our bread (Nestle Wheat Thin) and wine (Welch's grape juice) out of an unmanned tray and take them back to our seats to consume at our leisure. Another clergy member says a quick 30 second thank you and announces some events and we all file out and go home. This liturgical format is waaaaay different than what I know from traditional churches where there's lots of standing, sitting, standing, prayer, scripture, hymn, prayer, sermon, communion, scripture, hymn, etc. Drink coffee with your friends>rock concert>sermon>go home.

TAKEAWAYS

* Emphasis on community - the way they've set things up with a ton of free kids program, both during and outside of church service hours, make things really easy for parents. Based on the sermon, they clearly strongly encourage men (and women too) to get involved in kids coaching and mentorship programs. In an era where most people don't live close to grandparents and don't have super tight knit support networks, this feels pretty huge. 
* Terrible music - I'm sure 25 years ago it felt pretty revolutionary to begin strumming guitars and banging on drums and praising the lord through rock 'n' roll, but the music has not progressed even slightly from that super anodyne, ultra-earnest, soft rock sound. I would much rather sing along to the classics with an organ and choir than have to sway along to these abominations. It's also just weird having a concert during church and seems to put focus on the cool guy musicians. 
* Casual and accessible, for better or worse - everything about it seems to be so much more casual - dress code (schlubby), liturgical format, speech patterns and descriptions. Seems like they're trying to make it all feel modern and non-traditional. ""We're here to commune with god authentically, not just, like, do what people always used to do."" I bet these people wear sweatpants to the airport. 
* No emphasis on actual scripture - in a nearly 1.5 hour service with a 45+ minute sermon, I think there was maybe one reference to scripture. It was way more of a universalist message about being a good man. Felt much more like run of the mill self-help inspirational lesson rather than anything explicitly religious. Perhaps that comes down to the previous point, making it feel accessible.
* The whole church seems to exist to fulfill a role in a modern world where everyone is atomized, living in non-existent or fragile communities, far from family, bombarded by social media, and constantly looking inward for self-improvement and to find meaning. They offer an alternative and a clear set of guidance and community. I am still pretty snarky and cynical about the rock band churches, but I absolutely can see why they're attracting people while all the traditional churches are dying.

  
All in all it was a strange but interesting experience. Thus ends my notes from rural america.

1l7e7k0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1l7e7k0/aita_for_not_tipping_in_this_situation/,AITA for not tipping in this situation?,"This weekend, I was travelling home from a vacation. It was a good trip, and I had a day to kill in a new city, so I went to lunch. I stopped into a local place. The menu had a lot of burgers, sandwiches, and regular bar food. The burgers were advertised as very good, so I ordered one of those. The menu said that the burger was $28, which... ouch, but ok. The menu also said that sandwiches come with chips, or can be upgraded to fries for $1. The drinks were listed with water, coffee, and tea with no price listed next to them, soft drinks for a certain amount, and then beers (obviously charged per beer). 

So anyway, I ordered a burger. The server asked if I wanted fries, which I did. For a drink, I had iced tea. I was expecting a bill around $30 (I'm sure there's tax). So you can imagine my surprise when the bill came, and was actually over $59! I was sure there was a mistake, so I asked the server about it. She showed me the BACK of the menu, where it displayed the rest of the price list. To be clear, the menu opened like a book, with a front page (their logo) and the food/drinks on an inside page. I didn't turn it over to read the back.

Burgers are not considered sandwiches, so do not come with a side. As a result, the fries were considered a separate item (at $14.99). The water, tea, and coffee are considered 'unlimited', so do not show a per-drink price on the main page (but are priced at $11.99). So my bill was $28 + $15 +$12 = $55 + tax. I said that I thought that was, at best, deceptive and at worst was outright fraud. She got her manager who said that the prices were 'clearly' displayed (they weren't). The manager said that I could pay or they could call the police. 

I paid for my almost $60 burger and left, but I did not leave a tip. I've felt conflicted about that - I don't think it was necessarily the server's fault for the restaurant's pricing policy, and I'm sure she depends on tips for her income. But at the same time, I felt very ripped off, and didn't want to give that place or anyone associated with it another dollar. Anyway, it's been on my mind since Saturday.

1l7e6od,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1l7e6od/aitah_for_now_deciding_to_divorce_my_wife_after/,"AITAH for now deciding to divorce my Wife after she thought it be perfectly normal to Pee on me and my drinks without my consent because she thought I'd ""like it?""","My wife (F-32) and I (M-24) have been married for two years, and our lives have been going well until now. She has been struggling with Overactive Bladder (OAB) for a while, even before we met. However, this hasn’t stopped us from loving each other. I've told her multiple times to go to the doctor, but she refuses because she thinks it’s 'embarrassing' and believes it will 'go away' eventually.

While I did see her avoiding treatment as an inconvenience, it didn’t really affect me much. Thankfully, she hadn’t had any accidents (well, almost), and she was always careful during s3x by peeing first and going when she needed to.

Usually, we stay home since it’s easier for her, but we still go out sometimes. When we do, she typically drives to avoid any accidents, which I was okay with. We don’t travel far as we just go to halal food places (I’m Muslim, she’s Catholic) and nearby stores.

Normally, when she needed to use the bathroom, she would just say so. One day, I made a little joke by opening my mouth in response, and we both laughed because it was harmless fun. But then, she started turning that joke into a recurring thing. Every time she said she needed to pee, I had to open my mouth or say something like, ‘enhance the flavor of my food/drinks,’ pretending I wanted her to pee in them. I went along with it because I loved making her laugh, and she was very sweet and loving to me.

Still, I felt it was weird. She started saying it in a more sexual way, using an intimate tone, and I played along, thinking it was just more jokes. I didn’t think it would actually happen, and to be clear I didn’t want it to. Plus, as I said, I’m Muslim, so consuming urine or putting it in food/drinks is strictly forbidden in my religion and I think she knew that as I learned about her religion(Catholicism), and she learned mine(Islam).

Then it all came to crashing down. We were having s3x in bed as usual, and she made the “joke” again but this time, it wasn’t a joke because as soon as she said she needed to pee, she actually started peeing on me. I completely freaked out and ran into the shower. She apologized and finished peeing in the toilet. I was absolutely furious and disgusted, like she peed on me without my consent!

When I confronted her, she started crying and said she thought I’d like it because of all the 'jokes,' and she admitted to having a 'piss kink' and wanted to pee on me and my mouth for a long time. She believed I was being genuine about liking it. To make things worse, she confessed she had put a little bit of her pee in my tea and coffee over the past few days as a way to express what she thought was mutual interest.

I completely lost it an asked her how she would feel if I took a shit on her or in her drinks. She couldn’t respond but just sobbed on the floor. Mind you, she’s a grown woman and older than me, so I found this incredibly embarrassing. I left as it was her home while she was on the bed weeping. I decided to rent a hotel and started to cry because I felt disgusted and betrayed, how could she think this was okay when I've never consented? So now I'm filing for divorce because of this, AITAH?

TL;DR - AITAH for now filing divorce on my wife because she used her Overactive Bladder issues to support her kink by peeing on me and my drinks without my consent even though she tried to excuse it by thinking I'd ""like it?""",4,1749497775.0,AITAH,24,0.75,False

In more northern places, life often feels like it's run by clocks and calendars. Even friendships are scheduled: “let’s book a coffee” becomes the norm, and any hangout has to fit between obligations. It’s as if even the joy of social life has to be optimized.

By contrast, in many southern cultures, time is more fluid, especially in summer. There’s a culture of spontaneous gathering, long unhurried afternoons at public pools or plazas, a slower rhythm that allows for togetherness without planning everything in advance.

It’s not just a matter of climate — though warm weather does help — but of mindset. In the south, there’s more space for collective relaxation. In the north, even “free time” often feels like another item on the to-do list.

When everything has to be “booked,” even time with friends stops feeling free. But time shared spontaneously, without a clock ticking in the background, might just be the most human time we have.

Briefly the agenda: 

* presentation first thing in the morning
* talk with individuals I haven't met
* lunch with manager (1 hr)
* talk with others (teammates i've met virtually in the first round, and one other seems like manager's manager)
* coffee with manager (30 min)
* wrap up with manager (30 min)

I've only done virtual panels before so I'm wondering what to expect for the lunch part. Should I try my best to keep things casual (i.e. ask about general company culture, cost of living, where to live, etc.) since I'll have more time with the manager in the afternoon? Or would it be okay to follow-up on what I've talked about with the morning panelist (i.e. if they mentioned some collab projects, and I need some quick clarification)?

I'm generally good with ppl much older than me, but I haven't done lunch during interviews yet...

Even if I succeed at taking him out he'll punish me with bitterness and passive aggressive over little questions I ask, swearing at red lights and slow drivers, he always complains he's sore, tired and doesn't find anything interesting. He's said to me before how he's jaded with life but loves me. We never talk like normal ppl he hates phone calls, even if we have little chats when we meet it's always about economy, possible crisis or stocks. He always looks unhappy. I've been my best understanding self sailing this year and working on myself and now v less reactive and grounded after learning and researching about attachment theories.

We all have issues personally but I know this is not just avoidance but mix of bitter immature personality and emotional unavailability. But there are also a lot of good memories and good nights/days. I'm confused but I know such are not sustainable. What's happening here that I don't understand ? Even tho being around him is draining or hopeless I still feel empty when I don't see him on usual meet days. I suffer with anxiety and depression too but I can pull myself together and have a good time as needed, well my point is we all have issues but what's goin on with him ? To get his attention I need to at least repeat something 3 times. He doesn't like a lot of things including vacations I'm not big on vacations either but I like little outings or short walks and talk about us instead of just the world. Enlighten me with ur expertise. Idk if I wanted to vent or what I need right now 😔 I'm extremely in love and physically attracted, if I wasn't then this would be easy. He's been around thru my separation and divorce time so it's an attachment I've gotten so used to. If I bring up concerns he would fix it for a bit then back to rinse and repeat. Bringing up anything only leads to defensiveness in him or no contact for a few days. So I've started to just work on myself and tell myself I'll stay till my body says it's enough but I can't ignore the fact that I'm so invisible in my own relationship. If someone better understands and could help me with any advice I'd appreciate it. Thank you!

Edit - I'm only asking for basic interaction and him to genuinely connect with me not because I want him to, doing his hobbies and interests doesn't affect me at all if he gives me some of his undivided attention for a few hours without frustration and aggression respecting my time and presence. I feel like he's seeing me as a chore or a duty. I understand we're incompatible then why does he call me ""my everything and my world"" and cuddle and be affectionate for a short while then back to coldness and distracted.

1l7e1dt,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_VioletBureaucracy/comments/1l7e1dt/male_perspective_needed_is_my_hot_trainer_into_me/,"Male perspective needed: Is my hot trainer into me, or just doing his job?","I (44F) have been going to a personal trainer for 4 months. He’s younger—early 30s, though looks more like 35—handsome, fit, charismatic, and charming. He’s from a Latin American country, so our sessions have a fun, flirty vibe. He’s naturally hands-on as a trainer, but lately, I’ve felt like there might be mutual attraction.

I know his job is partly to make me feel good so I keep coming back. But in the past few weeks, something feels different. I’m posting here because I don’t want to embarrass myself! Does he like me, or just being a great trainer?

A few things to note:

– Language barrier: He doesn’t speak English, and I speak limited Spanish (currently in an intensive course).  
– He’s been extra affectionate lately: hand on my lower back, arm around me, laid his head on my shoulder.  
– I don’t see how he interacts with other clients, so I can’t compare.  
– He’s told me a few times that my body is looking good.  
– He likes my workout Instagram stories (I post maybe once a week).  
– He’s told me he’s single and wants a relationship.  
– Once, I caught him on his phone during a session and he said he was filming me and would send it (he didn’t).  
– I told him my sessions with him are the highlight of my week. He suggested we get a coffee sometime.

But then:

– He checks his phone during sessions (not constantly, but I notice).  
– I tried setting up a session outside the gym, and he never followed up.  
– He once said my friend was pretty (from an IG story).  
– Our texts are strictly about scheduling though they are friendly and flirty.

I’m super into him but avoidant by nature. I want to take a risk but don’t want to make things awkward. There’s a big age gap. I’m more cute-librarian and he's a hot-jock. So: does he like me? Or is this just business?

TL;DR: I (44F) go to a younger trainer who’s been flirty and affectionate, and recently suggested coffee. Is he into me or keeping a client happy?",1,1749497437.0,u_VioletBureaucracy,0,1.0,False

I work in an extremely accepting place; coffee shop with giant pride flags in the window, one of the owners is gay, almost none of the staff is cishet. I’m pretty new to nonbinary, I randomly started reading about agender identity and it felt like I was just reading a description of myself, so I adopted that label pretty quickly. I still go by he/they because he/him doesn’t bother me, I just feel no connection to any pronoun in the first place; she/her would just seem like a bit of an odd choice for me but certainly not offensive (I’m AMAB if that’s necessary context here). 

Anyway, I told all this to one coworker because she politely asked why I had been talking about doing makeup with the gender or nb flag colors for a pride event so I explained all of the above; this was a relatively recent thing as in like only a couple weeks ago and I didn’t really feel like having a big dramatic coming out moment to all my coworkers at once, plus since I’m still ok with he/him I don’t feel an immediate need to give everybody a pronoun update right away and I’m already fruity enough that nobody there treats me like a standard cishet guy. 

Sorry for the rambling but to get to the point of this post - before I completely finished explaining she cut me off and said that she was nonbinary before coming out as trans, and proudly declared that she would only use they/them because she figured ill come out as trans later. I kind of laughed awkwardly but it was pretty frustrating to have somebody basically just assuming they knew me better than I do; especially because I’m 10+ years older than her, and on top of that when I was much younger I did have almost a year where I had asked everyone to use she/her for me because I was thinking I could be trans, but ultimately it never felt like it fit for me.

Sorry for the rant here, I guess I just needed to vent to people, or maybe I really am doing something wrong with my identity and am open to discussion about that, but I don’t feel like I am. It feels like it fits.

Edit: to clarify, I’m not against the idea that I’ll come out as trans later. I’m just frustrated that me telling someone I’m nb just made them assume I’m just trans in denial or something; it felt invalidating.",43,1749497425.0,NonBinary,10,1.0,False

I meant I was tired of just doing nothing everyday while he was playing games, we spent everyday at one another’s homes, whether that only be at night where we would have like an hour to spend together or a full day where we would just do nothing, which made me so depressed, I feel like I had to ask for love and attention. I just wanted to explore like, go on walks or drives or dates that were more than just eating then screwing. It was so boring, and every time I would bring it up he would change for like a week and then go back to doing the same things. Our relationship didn’t start out like this, we both changed yes but he would tell me that I shouldn’t have to beg for the bare minimum but here I was begging for the bare minimum. I started getting angrier the more time went and I saw no changes, it’s like I was expected to just be okay with him ignoring me for a whole day and wanting me to be at his house all the time. I did so much for him I would buy him so much food, vapes, clean his goddamn room for him, wake up at crazy hours to make him coffee before he went to work when I legit never slept, I would stay awake until he had to work when he would ask me to make sure he would actually wake up, but anytime I would ask him to help me with cleaning and what not, he would complain, anytime I asked him to buy me food or a vape he would complain about how broke he was when he knew damn well I would spend my last money buying him stuff. But he was nice, despite everything else, he was sweet and funny, and would tell me how much he loved me he would say “I love you more than you could ever know” and would tell me I couldn’t love him more because his heart was bigger and he loved me with all of it. Literal liar because the second I drunkenly say some dumb stuff he breaks up with me, said he couldn’t trust me anymore, kept saying I was lying when I was trying to tell him what I actually meant, he told one of our mutual friends when she was explaining what I actually meant but with his interpretations of what I said, he said being with me would be like pretending. He also said “at least I don’t have to get off the game anymore” so dumb tbh. Idk with all of this I just feel like he didn’t actually love me, whatsoever, it felt like I meant nothing to him in the grand scheme of things because he was so content with just ending it, he said he had no choice but he did, the ball was in his court, I didn’t have a choice. Regardless, he was my first everything, my first love, my first time, my first relationship, literally everything I wasn’t his but he said he didn’t love anyone how he loved me. I just wanna tell him I miss him a part of me wants to just lower my self respect tenfold and tell him that I am willing to completely give up going out, let him go through my phone whenever, let him do whatever he wants just so he can trust me again and the other part of me is like screw him he doesn’t deserve that, he should want to fight for us too.

1l7dxdi,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1l7dxdi/student_struggling_with_underextraction/,Student struggling with underextraction & channeling — do I need a better grinder? [Breville Bambino],"Hey all,

I recently got a Breville Bambino and have been having a really tough time with **underextracted shots** and **serious channeling**. I've been trying to dial things in, but nothing really seems to fix it. I've already bought a Crema bottomless portafilter and tamper and distribution tool, but that hasn't made a difference either. Feeling kind of discouraged and frustrated because I had thought that upgrading my espresso machine would simply make the shots I pulled better and the whole process more enjoyable.

My main question is whether or not I need to just buy a burr grinder. I’m currently using a Black+Decker blade grinder, and while I’ve tried grinding the coffee *a*t various levels of fineness, the shots still gush or spray unevenly. I’ve been using a toothpick as a WDT tool, which helps a bit, but not enough to fix the core issue. Someone suggested old beans could be the problem, so I bought a fresh bag of high-quality beans, but that hasn't helped either. I also can't seem to get 18g in my basket, despite that seemingly being the default quantity everyone recommends. Is there a way to pull shots on nicer machines without being neurotic about the weight, extraction rate, etc.?

For context: I’m a **student**, so I’d really like to avoid spending $200+ on a fancy burr grinder if I don’t absolutely have to. I’m also not insanely picky—I used to enjoy my espresso from a much cheaper machine. At this point I just want decent shots that don't spray everywhere at 7:30 in the morning.

Is there *any* way to make this setup work better, or am I basically wasting my time without a burr grinder? Would a hand grinder be enough of a step up? Any advice would be super appreciated.

1l7dwpr,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/1l7dwpr/coup_at_work/,Coup at work,"I'm staging a small coup at work - and I don't mean a chicken coup.

I'm work as a consultant at a consulting company. Every friday the different departments at the office take turns arranging a friday breakfast, usually a buffet. The last couple of weeks there has been zero vegan options - even the bread wasn't vegan (contained honey). I've voiced this issue with my boss who took it up the ranks, but somewhere the flow of communication failed between the bosses and the consultants in the other departments and so the issue persisted.

This friday is our departments turn to host the breakfast - and since I have no real tasks assigned to me right now I took the opportunity to shoulder the task of planning, buying and hosting the breakfast.

I let this plan slip to one of my coworkers and he thought I should inform the participants that the breakfast will be vegan so they don't get their hopes up and expect a ""real"" breakfast, only to have to leave and feel hungry until lunch. I say no - if anyone has a problem with overnight oats with apple and coconut flakes; chia pudding with fruits; bread with homemade mushroom and sunflower seed pâté and assorted fresh vegetables; juice; tea/coffee with oat milk; and an asortment of fresh fruit and strawberries, then they can very well go hungry like I already have multiple times.

There are usually between 40 and 60 people attending these breakfasts.
My intention is to keep the menu ""real"" in the sense that nothing is imitating anything else (except the oat milk). So no soy-youghurt and no fake cheese. Every dish is ""itself"" as they should be.

I'll let you all know how this breakfast will be received by the participants. Maybe I'll be thrown out the door - maybe someone will open up to veganism. We have a lot of hunters in the company and I am pretty sure I'll get at least disgruntled comments from them.

The menu has not been fixed yet, so if anyone has any fantastic recipies or ideas I'd love to hear them!",12,1749497138.0,vegan,10,0.77,False

5/10 Flew United into Narita, Ez direct 11hr flight. 

Took the low fare bus into Tokyo, super cheap and after a long flight, it was nice to not have to use a train. is about the same time into town. 

**Tokyo Financial District.** 

Hotel was perfect for our arrival. (we are pretty minimalist and didn't need a bougee hotel room, we went cheap in the cities)

We hit the streets to look for food, which we found to be tough during the hours of 2pm-5pm. Lots of company people dressed up in suits out and about. 

Starbucks has a triple espresso latte, that we found to be the most accessible version of a latte in Japan, otherwise its tiny specialty lattes or black coffee. 

We walked a bunch while staying here but quickly found out that metros and trains take you wherever you need to go at a SUPER affordable price. ALWAYS double check the hours of the establishment you are wishing to visit, this goes for temples and shrines too, weird hours. Went to Imperial Palace and found out its closed on Mondays in May. LOL

Now, if you are planning on traversing Japan like i did, i highly suggest going to the tourist info booth on Day 1 at the train station and buying ALL long train rides in one shot. Don't count on being able to get your ticket the day of, not only are tourists traveling but locals use these trains exclusively. These attendants are super helpful and help plan your routing. 

We went to Ueno area by train and had A LOT of local experiences, like a small pop up flea market where they had a bunch of antiques and cool things to bring home as gifts. This was at Ueno Park, very cool open air park with a pond. We ventured into the neighborhood and found a very chill record bar where we talked with the locals and had some laughs. Not a busy area, which we enjoyed. a glimpse into the life as a local. Always ask the bartender what they are drinking, try the local sake, try the local whiskey.

We hit up a few Japanese BBQ spots where we cooked our own Wagyu short ribs and had a beer. LOVED THIS every time we ate at one of these restaurants. No chains, just local spots. YUM.

Into the Mountains.

**Nikko - Lake town**

Nikko, out in the wilderness alongside Lake Chuzenji, absolutely stunning. 

Have to take the local bus from Nikko station to the lake, about 45 mins. CASH ONLY or PASSMO

Our hotel was right on the lake, Hatago Nagomi, large room, lake view.  This hotel had breakfast available and a set menu dinner. MAKE RESERVATIONS AT CHECK IN. Not a lot to eat around the area and while we were there it must have been off season because not a lot of food options open.  

There is a lot of outdoorsy stuff to do here, hiking, waterfalls, shrines, temples. We took the bus back into town and found a FIRE Ramen spot where the locals were eating, WAS THE BEST RAMEN IVE HAD EVER. 

*Ramen Bonten* 

Our dinner at the hotel was pretty good, they gave us traditional garb to wear and all! 

Over all Nikko was a great low key, non city experience, we picked up a few goodies at the local shops. 

Back to Tokyo..

**Shibuya** 

We picked Shibuya because you have to experience it. 

I am a car guy through and through. The Car Culture in Japan got me into the Japanese culture at large so i HAD to book a tour with a local car enthusiast. 

He took us in HIS car, through Tokyo and stopped at a couple local spots where they have car meets. 

One of them being Daikoku Parking Lot. HIGHLY suggest getting here if you love the car culture. 

You can only get to it by car, so don't think about walking, or taking a cab. Very cool experience and the night i went WAS PACKED with custom vehicles of all sorts.

But we really went for the Koenji area, where they have vintage clothing and LOTS of shopping.

Atlantis Vintage Tokyo- they have certified vintage bags. Yuji the operator was amazing, my lady bought a 20 year old Louis V bag that she was VERY happy with. 

The main area is littered with shops and local cuisine, if you like to shop and eat this is the place for you. 

We went to Shinjuku area but it was raining that day and it was SOOOOO BUSY, not my style, loud and bright. we didn't like this area too much. so we stayed close to our hotel and found a couple of bars, where we chatted the locals, listened to good music and ate good food. 

Off to see Mt. Fuji

**Gotemba** 

We took the JR to Gotemba Station where we literally were in a cloud. It was cold, windy and couldn't see but ten feet in front of us. 

Gotemba is pretty out there and check in wasn't until 3pm!!! So, we had to lug our bags around, found a ramen spot to seek refuge from the elements, but we had to eat and go. We ended up at the Starbucks where we could get our bearings and chill for a moment. The Starbucks employees helped us call a cab to take us to our hotel. An example of how accommodating the Japanese can be. 

The place we stayed at was up in the hills, Well Fuji Resort. 

Two story House with our own amenities, washer, dryer, and a kitchen. 

We bought a bunch of food to cook while here and never left the house. We could see Mt. Fuji across the valley, it was epic. The house also had a private Onsen and sauna overlooking the valley. We loved this place, costly but worth every penny. 

Also the three days we were there, the National Defense was training with live ordinance so there were explosions rocking the house all day. We got used to it, didn't bother us. 

Kyoto Bound!! 

**Kyoto**

We took the Shinkansen from Gotemba to Kyoto, remember to buy tickets in advance. 

Short cab ride to the Hotel @ Miru Kyoto Nishiki. Great hotel, really close to the market. 

We spent most of our time here just exploring and eating food from the food stands in the market. 

Temples and shrines everywhere. pick a direction and get lost, it is fun to find so many secret shops and restaurants tucked back away from the crowds. 

We booked a tattoo appointment and got some cool ink to go home with. 

We also spent a lot of time trying to find the Gatchas that we wanted, lots of game stores and gatcha stores in this area. 

Back to Tokyo.... for our last day. 

**Narita.**

We booked a hotel close to the Narita Airport. Free shuttle to the town of Narita, which ended up being super fun because we found Japan's Version of the goodwill. VINTAGE PRE OWNED STUFF EVERYWHERE. 

Ate some good food before we called it a night. 

All in all, it was a great trip i made friends, experiences and fell deeper in love with my partner who accompanied me. 

Travelling can really be testing on patience. Go with an open mind and ZERO expectations and ANY trip you go on will be great. 

Its really hard to remember everything we did. We did so much during this trip it all blends together at a point. TAKE PICTURES, BE POLITE AND LINE UP IN THE QUEUE.

He’s created a device that forces you to stop at yellow lights. All of them. Something something devil magic. Anyway, if you accept you get a thousand dollars a month cash but you have to stop for every yellow light. 

1. You stop at the line.
2. No matter how fast you’re driving, the car will instantly stop when any part of it crosses the white line. 
3. You and your passengers will not be physically hurt by the sudden stop, and the car will remain undamaged.
4. Unsecured objects will still remain subject to the full force of physics. Coffee in a holder will still be traveling at the same speed as it was when you stop. That HP printer loose on the back seat will fly forward and hit your seat. These CAN hurt you and damage your vehicle.
5. If the light turns while you’re in the intersection, you will be allowed to continue.
6. You’re still allowed to run red lights. 
7. This applies to any car or bus, whether it is driven by you, another person, or automated, assuming you’re a passenger. 
8. If someone rear ends you, the car will take damage, and you will be susceptible to all injury caused by the stop.
9. You cannot opt out of this deal once accepted. 
10. The airbags will not deploy when you’re stopped at a yellow light, no matter how quickly you stop. 

Ex. You’re driving on the highway at 60 miles per hour, or 100 kph. You approach an intersection. While you’re 20 feet from the intersection the light turns yellow. You do not have time to react and brake. The front bumper touches the white line, and your car instantly stops. You are flung forward at 60 mph but stopped by your seatbelt. You have the air knocked out of your lungs and hit your head on the steering wheel but you do not sustain any actual injuries. However, it’s the 12 p.m. on the first day of the month so a thousand dollars magically appears in your wallet making you feel better about the whole thing.

1l7dpm8,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1l7dpm8/voicemail_from_room_616/,Voicemail from Room 616”,"I used to work night shifts at a front desk in a half-dead motel off I-95. The kind of place truckers crash for a night, where the sheets smell like bleach and regret. We only had 20 rooms, and we rarely filled more than 6. Easy gig. Until the voicemail started.

Every room phone was connected to the same ancient voicemail system. Guests could leave messages for each other or for the front desk. It was barely used. Except for Room 616.

That was the weird thing. We didn’t have a Room 616. The rooms stopped at 220. I checked the old blueprints—nothing.

The first time it happened, it was 2:42 a.m. I was sipping instant coffee and watching grainy security cam feeds. The red voicemail light started blinking on the console. Message from Room 616.

I assumed it was a glitch. Curiosity got the better of me and I played it.

All I heard was breathing. Not normal breathing—wet, labored, like someone drowning in molasses. Then a voice, hoarse and broken, whispered:

“It’s cold. I see you.”

Click. That was it.

I laughed it off. Told myself it was probably just some tech hiccup. Maybe a guest prank-calling from a burner. But the next night, same time: 2:42 a.m. New message. Still from Room 616.

This time, it was crying. A woman, maybe? Hard to tell. The sobbing rose to a panicked wail, then cut off mid-scream. No explanation.

I tried to trace the call. I pulled every log, even asked the manager to contact the phone company. Nothing. The number just said “INTERNAL EXT - 616”—which again, shouldn’t exist.

By night three, I was scared. I started recording the messages on my phone.

“Don’t let them in the walls,”
“She wears your face when you sleep,”
“You left the door open.”

It was always the same time: 2:42 a.m.

On the sixth night, I unplugged the whole damn voicemail system before the message could come in. That night was silent. I thought I’d won. I started to believe I imagined it.

Until I got home.

I checked my cell. One new voicemail.

Unknown number. 2:42 a.m.

I played it.

“You unplugged the wrong wire.”

Then came a screech—like a pig being skinned alive underwater. My phone died instantly. Wouldn’t turn back on no matter what I did. I smashed it and threw it in the dumpster.

I quit the motel the next day. Never went back. But every so often, around 2:42 a.m., I get this tightness in my chest. Like something’s waiting for me to check my phone.

So far, I haven’t.

But last night, my landline rang for the first time in years.

And the caller ID said:

Room 616.

## Key Features Analysis

The best cactus candles in 2025 showcase several enhanced features compared to previous generations, offering improved aesthetics and functionality.

**Realistic Detailing**

the advanced molding techniques now allow for incredibly realistic detailing in cactus candle designs. Today’s top-tier cactus candles exhibit textures that mimic the ridged surfaces and prickly spines of actual cacti, with subtle colour gradients for added authenticity. This level of detail is achieved using specialized silicone molds and high-resolution sculpting techniques, creating candles that are visually captivating.

**Scent Infusion Technology**

Improvements in scent infusion technology ensure a more consistent and prolonged aroma release.Modern cactus candles utilize micro-encapsulation methods to embed fragrance oils within the wax matrix, resulting in a gradual and even diffusion of scent as the candle burns. This technology prevents the fragrance from fading quickly so the candle provides a pleasant aroma throughout its burn time.

**Burn Time Optimization**

Enhanced wax formulations extend the burn time of cactus candles while minimizing soot production. Blends of natural soy wax, beeswax, and high-quality paraffin are engineered to burn cleanly and efficiently, providing hours of fragrant illumination without excessive smoke or residue.Candles made with these formulas are less likely to drip or create messes, making them more enjoyable and easier to maintain.

**Eco-Friendly Materials**

Increasingly, manufacturers are using eco-friendly materials in the production of cactus candles, reflecting a growing commitment to sustainability. These candles often feature natural soy wax derived from renewable sources, recyclable packaging, and lead-free cotton wicks. this focus on sustainable materials minimizes the environmental impact of the production process and appeals to environmentally conscious consumers.

Key features of the best cactus candles include:

*   Realistic and detailed designs
*   Long-lasting fragrance
*   Extended burn time
*   Eco-friendly composition

## FAQs Section

**How long do cactus candles typically burn?**

The burn time of a cactus candle varies depending on its size and composition. On average,a medium-sized cactus candle with a soy wax blend can burn for 20-30 hours. Candles with multiple wicks or made from higher-quality waxes may have even longer burn times.**Are cactus candles safe to burn around pets and children?**

While cactus candles are generally safe, it's important to take certain precautions when burning them around pets and children. Always keep the candle out of reach of children and pets to prevent accidental burns or ingestion of wax. Ensure the candle is placed on a stable and heat-resistant surface and never leave a burning candle unattended.

**What are the best scents for cactus candles?**

Popular scents for cactus candles range from floral and fruity to earthy and spicy. Scents like desert sage, sandalwood, and cactus flower evoke the natural aromas of the desert, while citrus and floral scents add a refreshing and uplifting touch. Ultimately, the best scent depends on personal preferences and the desired ambiance.

**How do I care for my cactus candle to prolong its burn time?**

To prolong the burn time of your cactus candle, trim the wick to about ¼ inch before each use.This helps prevent smoking and ensures a cleaner, more even burn. Avoid burning the candle for more than 3-4 hours at a time,as this can cause the wax to overheat and melt unevenly. Allow the candle to cool and solidify entirely before relighting it.

Lots of sweet treats, and my first time trying Huel! 🌱","To see my previous monthly reviews, please visit [this link](https://www.reddit.com/user/AnUnearthlyGay/comments/1bzrvze/monthly_vegan_product_reviews_thread/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). It was my birthday this past month, so I've had lots of tasty vegan goodies to try recently.

I've been wanting to try Huel for a while, and my first choice was a good one! Huel Iced Coffee Caramel is possibly one of the nicest drinks I've ever had. It is absolutely delicious and very refreshing. I've never really liked iced coffee in the past, but this was genuinely fabulous. I will be buying this many times in the future. 10/10.

Huel Chocolate was also very nice, but not quite as good as Iced Coffee Caramel. The flavour was nice but not as chocolatey as I would have liked. 8/10.

Huel Banana was very disappointing. I had heard great things about this, but honestly the whole experience was like if someone had blended up those banana sweets you get in shrimps and bananas. Even the texture was similar. The flavour wasn't offensive but it was very artificial and was not a good choice for a drink. 3/10.

Next is Lazy Day Millionaires Shortbread. This was ridiculously sweet to the point where it was almost too much for me. The flavours were nice though and the texture of the caramel with the biscuit was great. 5/10.

Lazy Day Tiffin was pretty good too, but again, very sweet. I'm sure these would be perfect for some people, but personally they were just too sweet. 6/10.

The Lidl Cookies & Cream Vegan Protein Bar was very weird. The texture was like nougat but it didn't taste like cookies & cream at all, more like coconut. I would eat this again, but I wouldn't buy it for myself. 4/10.

The Gingsters Bombay Potato & Spinach Pasty was a wonderful surprise. In the fast I've found Gingsters products to be very disappointing, especially the pastry. This however was a delight. The flavours were fantastic, less bombay potato and more like a samosa, which I found to be very enjoyable. Personally I enjoy them more cold rather than done in the oven. 8/10.

Now for some accidentally vegan products. First are the Lidl Soft Baked Jaffa Cookies. These were genuinely some of the nicest biscuits I've ever eaten. Wonderfully squishy cookies with pieces of dark chocolate and candied orange peel. I ate a whole pack and felt sick for the rest of the afternoon. I've since stocked up just in case Lidl stop selling them. Definitely give these a try if you can find them. 10/10.

I initially passed on Lidl's Giant Neos, thinking they were just big Oreos, which they are, but that is so much better than it sounds. There's something about a big Oreo (Neo) which is just incredibly enjoyable. There's a genuine difference between eating two Oreos and one Giant Neo. They were just good! Ok? Try them. 9/10.

Finally are the Aldi Top Twists, which is their answer to Pop Tarts. First is Strawberry. These were pretty good, but nothing special. They tasted similar to the strawberry Nutri-Grain bars, but more artificial. 6/10.

Next is Cookies & Cream. These were nice but a little bit disappointing. The pastry tasted chocolaty but the ""cream"" filling barely had any flavour at all. They're nice, but not as good as the Chocolate ones. 7/10.

Speaking of, the Chocolate Top Twists were very good. A rich chocolatey flavour in both the pastry and filling. 8/10.

1l7djj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ActuallyTexas/comments/1l7djj8/update_on_trip_in_april/,Update on trip in April,"This is an update on the trip my brother and I took in early April. We really appreciated all your input and tried to do as much as we could. 

Honorary mention: we initially flew into OKC and stayed there a night, driving to Dallas the next day. Ma Der Lao in the city was phenomenal, did not expect authentic Laotian cuisine done so well. On the drive down we went to the original Arbuckle Mountain Fried Pies, which was amazing. Exactly what we wanted.

The Good: Loved the Mavs game we went to. Fans were still salty but AD played, bought a Fire Nico shirt and participated in all the chants. Truly a great NBA environment, and even though I'm 1000% in the collusion camp I'm glad that you're gonna get Flagg because you guys deserve it. Unless it means Nico gets to keep his job.

We stayed at the Stockyards in FTW which was kitschy and fun. Loved the vibe there, HHH had great food and margaritas, probably my favorite part of the trip.

Drinks at Hotel Emma in San Antonio's Pearl were amazing. Super fun area in general. The Riverwalk was not what I expected, I thought it would be touristy and tacky but its very beautiful with the architecture.

Houston Museum of Natural History was really cool, really enjoyed the exhibits they had there.

Had BBQ at Interstellar in Austin and Truth in Houston. Truth had amazing brisket and I get why Interstellar has a Michelin star. Y'all are spoiled down there.

Got to see the bats under the Congress Bridge in Austin, that was an amazing experience. 

Alamo Drafthouse was a cool place, we don't have anything like that around here. 

Really beautiful landscape, bluebonnets and paintbrushes everywhere. Made all the driving worthwhile.

The Meh: Houston and San Antonio's NBA stadiums. Not very comfortable, food options were just OK, crowd vibe wasn't really there from what we were expecting, even in Houston. Also, is SA's stadium even in SA? Super annoying to get to.

Went to Pizzana in Dallas because it was on a bunch of lists for Best pizza in the US. At best it was fine. Cocktail I had was great tho.

Terry Black's in Austin was fine. It was the first place we went and even with nothing to gage it against we both agreed that it was just OK, definitely wouldnt go back when Interstellar is 20 minutes away and costs the same amount.

Went to the Alamo, I definitely liked it better than my brother but it was a little underwhelming. I liked the guided tours whole ""this is what both sides were thinking, you figure it out"" approach though.

Bucees is fun. BBQ sandwiches are ok and they didn't have any corn nuts or corn nut alternatives which are my preferred road snack, but the people there have an energy thats enjoyable.

Czech Stop was smaller than I expected so I was impressed that it was as well known as it was. I had a couple different savory rolls, one was amazing and the other was super salty, but overall worth it.

Drinking a Shiner in the Gruene Hall was cool, but the rest of the town didn't really do it for me. Felt very much like places I had already been before, but I'm sure if we had more time we could have found something good.

The Bad:Traffic in your cities suck, and I have to deal with California driving everyday. San Antonio was the most unbearable, but Houston was no slouch.

The weather. 90° heat with 90% humidity in the first week of April is diabolical. We couldn't stand to be outside for any amount of time and I felt drained.

No fault to anyone, but I had surprised my brother with tickets to Comedy Mothership but he got sick and so we couldn't go. So it sucked that I paid for them and couldn't give them away or get refunded. 

Not my complaint, but according to my brother it was really hard to find good coffee there. I don't drink the stuff so I couldn't tell.


Anyways, thats the highlights and lowlights of our trip. Overall it was a great experience, don't know if I'd love to do it again anytime soon. Thanks to everyone in this sub for your great help and recommendations!",16,1749496301.0,ActuallyTexas,4,0.94,False

I met this girl on Bumble, a week ago, after like 2 days, she told me if I wanted to move thr conversation to WhatsApp, so I did. But her texts were really slow (like every 4-5 hours or maybe even more) I did not point that out because thats weird. She apologised the next day, that she doesn't like to text a lot and I  shouldn't that take personally. So what my ass did asked her out :) 
That if she has time this week around evening lets just go for a coffee, she said yes and her go to café, decided sunday (we matched on Saturday, whatsapp on Monday and the coffee plan texting on Tuesday). Now I didn't text after that (i got busy with shit) and then on Saturday asked if good for tomorrow, and COINCIDENTALLY she suggested MY go to Café (that her roommate recommended to her) this made me really excited for Sunday, so I decided to make her my homemade muffins so around 10pm I went for grocery shopping and made a fresh batch in the morning. Gave it to her when we met (didn't really think too muvh about it) the date ig went well? But now, I am overthinking, did I too much? Like bringing homemade goods on a first date? And she hasn't texted me or skn that they were good (not that I am expecting that anyway) but after the meet, I texted her that I had a good time and would love to do it again and she replied me too and is open to do anything.

About me, I’ve been working since I was in college and my friend is taking up 👩🏻‍⚖️ school (don’t mind the emoji i think di pwede ang L word bc of the rules here idk why haha). Allow me to post this here kay tungod sa akong ka hilomon murag na puno nako. 

Nowadays, she wants to hang out kay summer lage or there are times na spontaneous iyang pag invite nako just to hangout. I understand na she wants to spend time with me pero naay times maka ingon ko unrealistic kaayo siya. Just because I work from home doesn’t mean pwede dayon ko mo lupad or “work sa cafe” based on what she suggested. It also takes time and consideration plus rude pud ang outcome nako if ga work ko and akong friend wants to spend time together so di ko ka focus niya (ofc I wanna focus on my friend like spend quality time). Not to sound rude or know-it-all but wa pa man gud siya kasulay og work cause she’s been given everything matod pa niya and makita rapud. Maka understand man pud ko niya kay I also grew up pina princess treatment kay only child with a foreign step dad but life isn’t always flat or the same naa pud ups and downs. I started working hard after my step dad died so it’s only me and my mom mag help each other. Yes I travel but gina save na nako and need e plan ahead ambot unsay naas utok niya basin anak dagway kong Henry Sy na di dayon mo save after travelling (bisag sila pud noh tig tigom pud na sila)

Right now, we’re seeing high prices of commodities and an economic downturn because of Tr*mp so mga foreign clients nag budget pud silas sweldo paras mga VA mao ng dili gud maka pa dali og “hangout”. Unsa iyang pagtuo she thinks na abi kay ga work na iyang mga friends need dayon mo lupad or stick beside her amay di nata high school or college magsigeg kita. I just hope this serves as an eye-opener that people who work aren’t as ‘rich’ as you think. Yes, we can afford our needs but everything is budgeted and we still have to spend our money wisely. 

Actually we had our fights before mga 3 ra and there are times na iyang insecurities iyang e lash out nako and telling me “I’m selfish”. Why? Cause I can do things on my own and not depend? Mahilig pud siya magpa kuyog bisag asa atay ka gulang na nato naa pud koy gi atubang. There was a time pud when this certain org ganged up on me cause ni resign ko due to their superiority complex behavior, ni side comment pagud siya “oh they liked me” like girl I didn’t ask for your opinion. If i was in that situation na luoy akong amiga I’d never say that. There are times pud when a guy would ask me out on a coffee date mo side comment pagud “oh he used to like me in high school” okay what am i gonna do with that info, good for you i guess? Kana pud mo post siyag pictures siya ra ang gwapa bahalag maot na ng tawo kay iyang rang self gi edit wa man lang ni consult ba sige ra padayona ipakita na gwapa kas imong crush. Idk what’s going on pero for sure naa gud siyay internal issues like she would say bad things about her brothers na “ako mas maka kita pakog work kaysa akong brothers kay mas smart pako nila” amay edi pangitag trabaho for sure I stopped opening up to her about my issues like I just know I can’t trust her anymore cause a person who would talk bad about their siblings or friends can’t be trusted cause heck yea for sure she would do that to me as well (she already did before).

That’s the thing about her, she can’t read the room and for me I wanna cut our friendship pero ako ra sayang ang 8 years namo. Mag excuse nalang ko na busy gud ko pero tinuod man pud busy nagud. Diri ko murag na triggered ni ingon pagud siya last week sa iyang 👩🏻‍⚖️school friend “sorry gi disturb tikaw ha, pwede ra nako ni samokan akong amiga (me) whenever I want”. That’s when I knew I needed to distance myself from her and tell her my boundaries. Iya pud OG best friend left her, I’m not sure what happened but she tends to be disloyal to her friends. One mistake sa person iya dayon ipanabi sa uban. Mao ng mag hilom nalang ko kay ipanabi pud niyas iyang “👩🏻‍⚖️school friends”.  

I do have long term friends gikan pas jhs na ga work or further studies wala raman lage mi problema mura rag gahapon nagkita. I also have my flaws I admit it na dili ko sige available pero I try hard to be a supportive friend na bahalag busy sige tawaga rako pila ka oras but sometimes I think it’s wasting my time and I’m giving her signals na pwede easily available rako. Gosh I need help or advice unsaon ba ni. Wa koy ma share ani kay for sure this is just a small misunderstanding na dili angay e open up sa other friends or kapoyan rakog drama wa nakoy time ana. Taasa man diay sa akong rant sorry.

Written with dark humor and spiritual rebellion.

Hi friends. I'm neurodivergent and disabled, and I’ve been working a physically demanding job that’s slowly been burning me out. At first, I wanted to be the perfect employee—reliable, honest, helpful. But over time, I realized the system doesn’t reward effort—it drains it. And when I burned out, I found that the foundation I had unknowingly built protected me.

So I wrote this down—not as a how-to on laziness, but as a sacred guide to survival. A gospel for the overworked, the masked, the misfits, and the quietly defiant.

This is The Gremlin Gospel: a disillusioned worker’s guide to getting paid without getting played.

**The Gremlin Gospel**
*A Disillusioned Worker’s Guide to Getting Paid Without Getting Played*

*Disclosure: This manifesto was written entirely from my own experiences, ideas, and observations—but I organized and refined it with the help of AI (ChatGPT), who acted as my scribe, editor, and hype gremlin while I snuck moments of writing between cleaning shifts.*


--- 

🕯️ Origin of the Gremlin Gospel:

I didn’t plan on slacking. I started off wanting to be a good employee—reliable, helpful, honest. I gave my job the best I had.

But over time, the cracks showed. The system didn’t reward effort—it consumed it. I got tired. I burned out.

And that’s when I realized… the trust I’d built, the habits I’d formed, the extra steps I’d taken? They were protecting me. They gave me space to rest without being questioned.

So I started writing it down. Not as a plan to be lazy—but as a manifesto for survival in a system that punishes care.

This is for every good employee who got tired. Every hard worker who ran out of fire. Every kind soul forced to ration their effort just to make it to payday.

Welcome to the Gremlin Gospel.

**Part 1: Building the Foundation (Reputation Is Armor)**

**Tip #1: Use Your Honeymoon Period Wisely**

Shine bright while the serotonin still sparkles. Show up early. Smile. Accept the Rookie of the Year award. Gain their trust. Let them think you’re the chosen one.

Then? Cut corners. Strategically. They won’t micromanage you anymore. You’ve earned their blind spot.


---

**Tip #2: Weaponize Honesty (But Only at First)**

Be totally honest about your mistakes in the beginning. Didn’t finish the checklist? Say it. Forgot a task? Own it.

This builds trust. You’ll get a rep as someone who ""holds themselves accountable.""

Later, when you're tired and jaded? Skip the small stuff. Don’t even mention it. No one cares that you didn’t top off the tissue box. Keep reporting the big things occasionally to maintain your sainthood.


---

**Tip #3: Occasionally Do More Than What's Expected**

Got energy? Do one thing that wasn't required. Something visible, manageable, and mildly impressive. Then casually mention it.

> ""Oh yeah, I just wiped down that area too, figured it needed it.""



Ask for extra tasks sparingly. You’ll look good, but you might get cursed with something awful. Better to pick your own little wins. This keeps your ""hard worker"" reputation alive, making future slacking look like you're just having an off day.


---

**Tip #4: Fill a Need (But Know Your Worth)**

Find something extra you don't mind doing—a niche task, a side duty, a skill you enjoy. Learn it. Do it well. Become slightly irreplaceable.

Knowledge is power. Cross-train. Be useful. But remember:

> Never take on a responsibility that deserves a raise without them offering the raise first.



You’re not a volunteer. You’re a professional chaos manager with bills. Respect your energy.


---

**Part 2: Slackcraft and Survival Tactics**

**Tip #1: Ritualize the Routine**

Build a ritual around your work. Learn the motions. Make them habit. Figure out what is absolutely necessary and do just that.

Make it automatic. Get good at it. Do no more and no less than what’s expected. Find out which corners can be safely cut—and cut them without guilt.

This is the heart of sustainable slackcraft: efficient, repeatable motion. The better you know the pattern, the less energy it takes. And the more time you free up to breathe, rest, or vanish into the Sacred Stall.


---

**Tip #2: Take Mini-Vacations**

I’m not talking about your scheduled breaks. I’m talking about intentional, on-the-clock, moments of escape.

Scout the territory. Know where the cameras are—and more importantly, where they aren’t. Find the blind spots, the hidden corners, the Sacred Stall. Use them to pause, reset, and survive.

Check your phone. Cry if you need to. Do deep breathing. Sip your lukewarm coffee like it’s a potion of clarity. Stay just long enough to gather yourself.

Then? Re-enter the fray like nothing happened. Because you are your first priority—and a few stolen minutes can mean the difference between burnout and making it to clock-out.


---

**Tip #3: Do More When You Can, and Less When You Can’t**

You’re not a machine. You will have bad days. Days where the fluorescent lights feel like an attack and every task feels insurmountable. On those days? Do the bare minimum.

No apologies. No explanations. Just do what’s needed—nothing more—and leave.

And on the rare days when motivation strikes? If you feel like doing more, if it feels good to push a little? Do it. But only if you want to. Only if you benefit. Not because you owe the job anything.

The system will take everything if you let it. Learn to honor your own energy, and let your output match your capacity.


---

**Bonus Tip: Look Busy Without Doing More Work**

Want to rest without getting caught? Master the art of productive-looking idleness.

Find repeatable tasks—things like “checking the bathrooms” or “doing a quick walk-through”—and use them as built-in breaks. You know the bathrooms are fine. You’re just making sure your vape gets a moment of peace.

Walk with purpose. Look mildly annoyed or overly focused. Everyone assumes you’re busy if you look inconvenienced.

Got a task you don’t mind? Do it—even if it doesn’t really need to be done. Take out a half-full trash can. Wipe the same counter again. Do it slow. Do it with ceremony.

This is the sacred dance of deception. You’re not slacking. You’re maintaining the illusion.

AZRIS WEEK 2025

# The Break

***Synopsis*** 

It’s day two of being stuck together in a protective shield and Eris just wants to relax and read his book. Meanwhile, Azriel gets bored and decides to snoop in the prince’s personal library.

TW: sexually explicit and strong language

# DAY 2 - Reading Material

“What are we doing today?” Azriel asks, draining the last of his coffee and looking ready to take off into the air. 

“I’m trying this thing called relaxation. You’re making it very unpleasant.” Eris responds, not bothering to look up from his book. 

It’s still morning and they’ve not long finished breakfast, but the prince has no immediate plans to move from his seat on the patio. The day, warm and pleasant and serene, is the perfect weather for reading. Eris has nowhere to be and no immediate obligations to attend to. When was the last time that happened?

“I can’t sit on my ass all day.” The spymaster complains. “Not without a reason at least.”

“Then leave.” Eris suggests glibly, knowing full well that Azriel cannot.

“You know I can’t do that.”

The prince snorts. As if he could forget that they are tethered together for the foreseeable future inside this forsaken protective shield…

“I have just opened my book and poured another coffee. You will have to entertain yourself.” Eris waves dismissively, not bothering to look up from the volume in his hand.

Azriel huffs and stands abruptly from the patio chair. The spymaster strides out onto the grass and the prince, intrigued, glances over just as the male tugs off his tunic. Eris straightens in his chair, his eyes snagging on the obscene swell of Azriel’s biceps in his sleeveless undershirt. 

“What are you doing?” The prince asks, trying and failing to sound anything but intrigued by the half naked display.

“Entertaining myself.” The spymaster responds archly, cracking his knuckles.

“You’re ruining my view.” Eris retorts.

Azriel scoffs and begins working through drills. The prince forces himself to look down at his book and continue reading, but as an hour ticks by, he cannot help but look up and admire the shadowsinger’s athleticism. It is very…distracting.

Finished with his drills, Azriel finally stops to stretch and shake his limbs loose, and Eris cannot help but notice how the loose fitting undershirt shifts about the male’s torso as he moves, drawing attention to each graceful arc of his body. Side panels in the fabric give the occasional intriguing glimpse of inked skin. When the Illyrian lifts the hem of his shirt to wipe his brow, revealing a flash of dangerous looking abs, Eris realises he is actually salivating.

*Fucking hell, he looks positively edible*. The thought crosses the prince’s mind before he can shake sense into himself. *What the fuck, Eris? Shut the fuck up.*

Azriel grabs his discarded tunic and turns back towards the house. The prince pulls his book upward, as though the sun has him straining his eyes, and buries his furiously blushing face in its pages. He hopes to fuck it looks like he’s engrossed in the volume, despite the fact he’s re-read the same paragraph eight times and still has no idea what it says. 

“I’m going to clean up.” Azriel calls as he passes.

Eris hums in acknowledgement, ears turning pink, and prays to the Mother the spymaster is not paying attention to him.

First dates can be daunting, especially if you go on many of them. Having to get ready, put on a smile, search for a connection, and partake in some bad dates isn’t ideal.

You’re not alone. I wrote this article to make you a first-date master who can find the right guy and make him your boyfriend.

# Focus On Attraction, Not Connection

The number one thing I learned as a dating coach who focuses on evolutionary psychology is that attraction is everything.

>When I talk about attraction, I don’t just mean sexual. I mean a person’s “gravity” or ability to pull others in, make them curious, and want more.

When you’re on a first, second, or even third date, connections do not do that. In fact, it hurts you.

I cannot tell you how many women I know who lost men because they focused so much on trying to get to know each other and build a connection before building attraction.

I know that sounds weird but trust me. Attraction is a facilitator. It’s what causes men to invest and want to build a connection in the first place. Men will never build a connection just to build one. They have to like you first.

That’s because of how courtship works:

Men are the offers and women are the choosers. Men have to offer themselves to women and women can accept or decline that offer. That’s how courtship starts.

A man doesn’t think, *“I want to build a connection with that woman, let me offer myself to her.”* He finds you attractive and appealing. That’s what makes him invest.

On the other hand, women want to build a connection because they’re still filtering the man and want to see if he’d stick around.

Check out this article: [***How To Be So Interesting A Guy Needs You In His Life.***](https://yourfavoritedatingcoach.com/how-to-be-so-interesting-that-he-needs-you-in-his-life-seriously/)

# First Dates Should Be Systematic

First dates are interviews to see if we are interested in each other and vibe well.

Too many women want extravagant dates and believe simple dates aren’t worth their time.

Newsflash: It’s a first date. He doesn’t know you apart from Eve lol. You’re not special or different than any other girl at that point in time. Just go on the date and see if there is a spark.

With that being said, you should keep first dates simple:

* Day date/coffee or night/drinks
* 90 minutes
* Keep things light and laugh a lot
* Keep it within 15-minute drive
* No wait times or places difficult to park
* Have a handful of topics you'd like to discuss
* Have 3–5 questions to slip in there that are important to you

I have found after 10 years of being a coach that the easier these things are to do with an individual, the better the date and connection will be.

For me, I do this all the time, but with Mexican food:

* Everyone likes Mexican food.
* Mexicans are the most generous people regarding food portions and spiking your drinks lol.
* Cheap.
* Always close by.
* Always good parking.
* Rarely long waits.

Because of this, the vibe is chill, the tension is eased, and we have more time to focus on each other.

# Have A Literal “List” Of Things

I feel you should be dating with these two things in mind:

* For meeting a specific person
* For being a specific person to someone

Hopefully that makes sense.

People cast their nets too wide and wonder why things don’t work out. People focus so much on looks and chemistry, which are extremely importan,t but the two problems with that are:

* You’re always going to have someone more attractive and interesting than you.
* Everyone, to some degree, is cute and interesting; otherwise, we wouldn’t agree to the date.

It’s a losing battle.

>Instead, you have to have a list in your head of what you’re about and what you offer. At the same time, you should have the cliche but important list: Must haves/wants/dealbreakers.

That way, filtering people on a first date is straightforward. Don’t just date anyone. Date someone in your tribe (more on this in my [***How To Hook A Guy Guide***](https://valueguide.carrd.co/)).

Keep it simple. The only thing I ask is don’t put cliche things here. Don’t say for must have/want:

* Kind
* Caring
* Sweet
* Funny

Those are prerequisites. Everyone wants nice, funny, and kind people. Instead, it should be things like:

* Loves to work out and takes care of themselves.
* They are very passionate about something and have a mission.
* Has amazing style.
* They have hair.
* Doesn’t drink.
* Or whatever you want.

# Master Filtering Over Everything Else

If you’re on a first date, you must learn the art of balancing having fun and gathering information.

Your ability to correctly filter a guy will save you 80% of the bullshit that comes along with dating down the road.

You need to figure out if this man is:

* Wanting a relationship
* How long he’s been single
* Was he cheated on
* What was his longest relationship

The best way to ask this is to ask one question and let it naturally flow into others. For example:

You can ask someone what they’re looking for before the first date (and you should). I don’t care what the apps say they want. Before a first date, you need to hear it from them via text/phone. No, it’s not intense or clingy. I don’t know why people think that.

On the date, you can make a nice statement about how this date is relaxing because the apps are a nightmare for women. Then, when he comments on it, you can laugh, go along with it, and ask him, *“How’s your time on the apps?” and guide it to “Oh, how long have you been on there?”*

If he gives you an answer but doesn’t indicate how long he’s been single, you can naturally say, *“How long were you single before getting on the apps?”*

Then when he tells you, you can start prying for information on that relationship.

Pace it and add statements and other things so it doesn’t feel like an interview.

Here is more information on filtering: [***How To Filter Men Who Don’t Want Relationships — A Five-Step Foolproof Way To Finding A Boyfriend.***](http://How%20To%20Filter%20Men%20Who%20Don’t%20Want%20Relationships%20–%20A%20Five%20Step%20Foolproof%20Way%20To%20Finding%20A%20Boyfriend)

# Follow The 70/30 Rule

Lastly, if you’re unsure of how much you should invest, talk, and keep the conversation going, I believe in the 70/30 rule.

This essentially states that a man should be doing 70% of the talking, and you should be listening.

This is VERY hard to do because the number one thing everyone is taught on first dates is not to talk too much and to let the other person talk about themselves.

It’s not a hardset rule. It can be 50/50 or 60/40.

I am a huge believer that if you can let a guy try to win you over (making you laugh, let’s say), and you laugh, make comments/statements, and ask a question to send it back his way, you’re golden and getting a second date.

This works because of the dopamine-chase loop. It’s crucial to make a man chase, give in to him a little, then repeat the process.

As soon as you’re doing more of the talking, courtship is over.

I've been in protracted withdrawal from an SSRI from the past 3.5 years, I had Akathisia briefly when I quit the drug but it went away quickly. Then, back in September 2024 I took Ashwaghanda (a bit too much of it) and had a horrible reaction to it which worsened my protracted withdrawal, it felt like proper kindling. A month after that it kept getting worse and I suddenly got an Akathisia crisis, pacing and pacing. I don't know why it happened a month after the Ashwaghanda intake but I am certain it was related. After that horrific crisis, I had it on and off, it fluctuated, but I struggled with it let's say one day out of 2, it was on and off. I got much better in November then it came back so I took hydroxyzine. It innitially helped, until for some reason one night in January I had a severe adverse reaction to it and it caused a really bad Akathisia crisis again. I then got slightly better but not great so I went to get acupuncture. Big mistake. The acupuncture sent me into a huge Akathisia crisis again, for a week straight, then again on and off. 
The aka crisis slowly started to become less frequent. It has now been almost 2 months that I'm Akathisia free. I can drink coffee again, and even smoke cigarettes without any bad effects. 


I really feared I wouldn't recover. It was the most painful agonizing experience, my heart is still with you those who suffer from this horrific experience. Believing you will not recover is part of the Akathisia. But it's false, you will recover with time. I promise you. 


I didn't do anything special to heal, except at the time I picked up running to burn off the awful energy. Running wasn't a magic cure, but I believe for me it felt like the best thing I could do for my brain. It felt like it help regenerate its damaged parts. 


Sending my love to all of you. Take care and remember this too shall pass.

1l7d8dp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneurs/comments/1l7d8dp/what_recent_startup_funding_patterns_are_telling/,What recent startup funding patterns are telling me about idea validation,"Since COVID, I've  seen a shift in how early-stage founders approach funding, especially compared to even just a couple years ago. Used to be, you'd polish a pitch deck for months, grind through customer interviews, and only then start emailing angels or prepping for a seed round. Now, I'm noticing more founders going after smaller, and/or faster rounds - sometimes pre-seed cheques in weeks, not months, often with just a landing page and a handful of validation signals. Im following this founder on Instagram now (of which there are a dime a dozen) who has gone from Idea to $1mil in funding in 3 weeks.

I think there's a few reasons for this:
- **Tighter markets** - especially in SaaS and no-code tools, investors want to see *real* market demand, not just a clever idea. Founders have more competition now than ever and the ones who are doing it right/want funding sell their story quickly. Also the speed of progression is much faster due to AI enhanced tooling.
- **Time to validation is now a competitive edge** - if your competitor can show traction or at least data-backed demand in days, not weeks, they'll get the meeting (and maybe the cheque).

the old way of validating - long surveys, endless cold calls, spreadsheet hell - just doesn't keep up anymore. Investors want to see *actual* customer interest, data on market size, and even early pricing feedback, before they even consider a coffee. Flipside to that is there seems to be more movement pre-seed - $25–100K chques are small enough that angels or small funds can write them fast, without complicated terms.

the founders who combine fast AI validation with old-school customer chats are the ones getting funded, while the rest get stuck in analysis paralysis. 

Is this all for better or worse?? Honestly, neither IMO. I think it just means the landscape is changing and what worked 3-4 years ago does NOT work now.

While I am personally bootstrapping, I'm very invested in this subject because I am building a tool that helps you validate rapidly with hard data, called IdeaFloat, and I thought I'd give you some thoughts of the trends I have seen over the last year.",1,1749495602.0,Entrepreneurs,0,1.0,False

who would you pick?

honestly? i would pick Mingyu because it must be insane looking like that on a daily basis (with those pecs!!!) catch me staring at my face in the mirror the whole day and i’ll be so glad i can be tall for a day loll 

PLUS since he’s usually the one who is pranked by the other Sebongs, i would plan a prank on everyone to get back at them (on behalf of Mingyu) 

second pick…maybe Seungkwan because he’s the sweetest and friendliest so it would be so cool to just be able to chat with all the celebs he knows (hit up Taeyeon-noona for a coffee?)

On the way, Arvyndas becomes possessed by a dark spirit, attempts to kill Kariwase, and the missing boyfriend, Dylan.","Some tense electronic music plays, looking over a vast, dense pine forest. a truck pulls shakily down a dirt road in the middle of the night, its headlights barely cutting through.

On the back reads ""Colorado Search And Rescue"". Two exhausted people sit inside the cab; one a grizzled, but kind looking Norse man, Arvyndas Grunwald (4lp), the other an angular, intrepid Iroquois woman, Kariwase (5lp). She monitors a drone tablet while he drives.

Arvyndas: How's it looking?

Kariwase: The drones aren't finding anything.

Arvyndas tries not to curse.

Arvyndas: I don't want to tell them how this looks..

Kariwase: What do you want to do?

Arvyndas: Trying this way. Feel good about it.

Arvyndas turns off the road.

Kariwase: Wait.

Arvyndas is very focused all of the sudden. He weaves the vehicle through the trees with a dangerous increase in speed.

Arvyndas: No.

Kariwase: No?

Arvyndas: Gotta go this way.

Kariwase: Arvyndas, I think I found something. A bit of her shirt.

Arvyndas: It’s not her.

Kariwase: What is wrong with you? Slow down, this is outside the grid.

Arvyndas ignores.

Kariwase: Arvyndas, stop the truck.

Arvyndas ignores her still. He races all the more.

Kariwase takes action. She takes hold of the wheel, chokes Arvyndas severely for a second, then suddenly releases. Arvyndas passes out from his interruption in blood flow. Kariwase turns and brakes until the truck stops.

Kariwase retrieves an AED from the back of the truck and monitors Arvyndas's heartbeat.

Kariwase: Heartbeat is fine. Why are you acting like this?

Kariwase opens Arvyndas's eyes, looks with a flashlight, his eyes contract normally.

Kariwase shakes her head. She exits the truck, and looks around outside.

She takes a breath, and tries to get a feel of the woods. She looks up in the trees, walking just a mite from the truck.

Only the sounds of a light wind, and the rumbling of the engine are heard. The engine revs. Kariwase spins round.

The truck has taken off, being driven by a rather peaky Arvyndas. he tries to run her over in the process.

Kariwase jumps to the side. The truck hits a tree instead. from around the tree, Kariwase sees into the cab, from where Arvyndas stares at her, smiling demonically. Kariwase slowly pulls a pistol, aiming at Arvyndas.

Arvyndas looks threatened, and growls at her. She fires into the cab, but he backs up the truck, and turns around.

The shot goes through the windshield. Arvyndas speeds away, with a feverish manner.

Kariwase lowers her pistol, still very confused. She has no choice but to push on.

We see Arvyndas now, speeding madly, down deep into the forest. Kariwase doesn't see him anymore. He finds a young bear, not quite as tall as him, and he rams it full speed.

This causes Arvyndas to nearly be thrown out of the cab. The seat belt restrains him, but he rips it off with a blind fury.

He exits the cab, and plunges his knife into the bear, who is nearly unconscious.

Arvyndas tears into him several times in succession. The bear bites him in the leg. Arvyndas roars, and rams the knife into the bear's skull. It collapses.

Now, Kariwase sets up a small roost up in a tall tree. She looks through binoculars for the young couple that'd gotten lost. She puts them away, and blows a whistle. She stops, listening for a reply. She hears one.

Boy: I hear you! I hear you! Hold on!

Kariwase looks immensely surprised, and relieved.

Kariwase: Watch for the SAR truck! Something went wrong with the driver, he tried to run me down.

Boy: I'm fine! I don't see-

His voice cuts off. A scream was silenced. Kariwase's eyes widen. She clenches her jaw shut. She tries to call out, but her instincts tell her not to.

She's switched to a different mode. She lowers her face, but keeps her eyes affixed on the direction of the last voice's source, unslings a long rifle, and aims it thus.

The sun has just begun to show itself.

She sits here for many minutes. Until another man drives up on an ATV from the road behind her. A Forest Ranger, Vince (7lp). He finds the sight of her very comical.

Vince: Find anyone up there?

Kariwase is still watching the spot ahead.

Kariwase: Hush.

Vince is quiet. She notices her looking deeper into the woods and follows suit. He gets off his ATV, takes a rifle out as well, ducking behind a tree.

Kariwase: Arvyndas went crazy. He tried to hit me with the truck..

Vince: What do you reckon, drugs?

Kariwase: couldn't have been. Hes been clean all his life.

Vince: Want to go follow him?

Kariwase lowers her rifle.

Kariwase: Yeah, okay.

Kariwase begins to climb down, when we hear a terrible roar in the distance. Vince looks off to the source, deeper still into the woods.

Vince: I’ll use the ATV. You stay and watch from there.

Vince mounts his ATV, takes a second to summon up the courage, and ignites engine. He feels like he’s marching to his death.

Vince: I can go with ya.

Kariwase: That's alright. Just... watch.

Kariwase nods, and goes back to her scope. Vince zooms down. He reaches a thick part of the wood, where the SAR truck sits, no longer running. He approaches from the front, but quickly finds a trail of blood coming from the back.

It’s leading out further downhill, toward a raging river.

A blood pack has been torn into, and dragged out of the truck. He follows the trail down the hill.

The rest of the blood pack has been left at a bend in the river. It seems the perfect trap. Vince looks all around, then proceeds to walk down to the blood pack.

Vince has an arrow shot into his leg. His knees buckle, he turns his torso and fires at where he believes the attacker to be, but there's nothing.

Vince tries to reach for his walkie, but the blood on his hand makes it difficult.

Vince: Kariwase, I'm near the river bend. someone out here with a bow... I got shot... respond.

Kariwase:(os) I'm coming. Where are they? Over.

Vince tries to abate his panic.

Vince: Hold on...

He checks compass.

Vince: North-northwest from here. Don't move too fast, they're quiet. Over.

Kariwase:(os) Got you. Over and out.

After Vince releases the button, shivering violently, he examines the arrow stuck in him. It looks like its just been made. It is simply a sharp stick. He looks back to where the arrow came from. There is plenty of light now.

Vince: I should've seen them.

A helicopter can be heard from far off. Vince cranes his neck, trying to see.

Kariwase walks up with a first aid kit.

Vince: You didn't see anyone?

Kariwase: No one. Keep an eye out.

She begins to pull out the arrow. Vince hides his pain, and distracts himself by surveying the surrounding area. A serene scene, besides the blood. Kariwase comments.

Kariwase: Did you tear that blood pack?

Vince: No, it was probably your friend, from the truck.

Kariwase thinks a long while, disinfecting and wrapping the wound.

Kariwase: We have to leave him.

Vince: Really? He's- he's known you since you volunteered. We've gotta do something.

Kariwase: We can't.

Kariwase helps him up. Vince looks surprised at her.

Vince: Shit. Okay, I guess we'll... keep looking for the couple.

Kariwase: I found a ripped piece of fabric a while back. Let me go first.

Vince looks at his wound.

Kariwase and Vince retrace their steps, and enter the SAR truck. Kariwase sits in passenger seat, one hand holding a pistol, the other the drone tablet.

Kariwase: Go back up the hill, i want to watch this for a little while.

Vince drives uphill. They drive through a clearing, and the terrain flattens out a bit. They do finally come across the torn fabric. Kariwase gets out to pick it up.

Kariwase: It's the girl's. The same shirt from her picture.

Vince: Do you think she was running from something?

Kariwase: Yeah.

She hops back inside. Vince accelerates, now back on the road. He slows down, upon finding a vehicle.

Vince: Look! Look! It's their jeep!

Kariwase: Good find. Don't get out.

Kariwase digs through the jeep's glove compartment. She finds a phone. She turns it over to see a smashed screen.

She looks to the vehicles front. There is no damage. She weighs the phone in her hand, and puts it back exactly where she found it.

Vince: You don't wanna bring it in as evidence? Assuming, you know, God forbid, we can't find them?

Kariwase: No, i think whoever left it there's gonna come back. Let's watch this spot for a minute. Hey...

Vince looks at her.

Kariwase: don't give up on 'em. That's not why we're here.

Vince: sure, I'm just saying.

Vince pulls over just a few hundred meters back. The river can still be heard from here. Along with a heavy dragging noise.

Vince and Kariwase snap to look at the river.

Kariwase is still holding a gun in the other hand. A light row of trees separates the noise's source from them.

We see what it is. Arvyndas drags a bloodless corpse down the riverbank. He watches them through the trees, moving very slowly. His vision is remarkably clear.

He seems firmly affixed on Vince. He wants him gone. He drops the body quietly, having left a new trail of blood to follow.

He prepares another arrow, and hides in the brush.

Vince spots some of the blood, farther upstream than where Arvyndas lies in wait.

He looks at Kariwase.

Vince: What do you think?

Kariwase: It's him making these trails. Arvyndas's the only one out here, besides the lost couple.

Vince: Whose... blood is that?

Kariwase: His own, maybe. I'm not sure. I'm not going near it.

She stares and expects to hear him agree.

Kariwase: You won't either, right?

Vince: No, no.

Kariwase Doesn't let up her stare

Vince: What?!

Kariwase looks to the bloody trail a while, then back to Vince.

Kariwase: Let's both go. He's the only real danger out here to the people we've been looking for.

Vince finds reason in this.

Vince: (nods) Okay.

Arvyndas rushes out of the forest and throws a long blade into Vince's upper arm. Vince shouts, and draws a pistol. Kariwase doesn't hesitate to drive away. Arvyndas fires five times, but the first two hit. Arvyndas takes two bullets in his chest, but no blood comes out. he roars, unhurt.

Vince is perplexed. He drops the clip. They have only just managed to escape.

Back in a vast house on a great plot of land owned by a family of farmers and ranchers. The ones that provide the funding for this search. A young adult answers a phone.

Jamee: Please tell me you found something.

Vince: (os) We did. But he went went- Arvyndas went crazy. He's trying to kill people with a bow. I'm more afraid for us right now.

We hear Kariwase's voice.

Kariwase: (os, faint) Speak for yourself.

Vince: (os) Yeah, we found his jeep. And a smashed phone. it's strange, the car isn't damaged. Kariwase thinks it was broken on purpose.

Jamee: I trust her judgement. What does she want to do about Arvyndas?

Vince: (os) I'll let you talk to her.

We hear the phone changing hands.

Kariwase: (os) Leave him.

Jamee looks surprised.

Jamee: If you think you need to.

Kariwase: (os) Yes. See if you can get more Rangers out here. Vince has been hurt.

Jamee: I'll do it. Watch over yourselves.

He ends the call. He exits his office, enters the dining room, and sits down to his family's full dinner table. 11 people and a puppy below. These people are always served far better than the others, and nobody really knows why.

Jamee: They've, they've found her jeep, but they're... having trouble with a member of their team.

Pockets his phone.

Jamee: I feel bad for them. The missing people. I know, they're not our family or anything, but I hate hearing news like that.

I: Go look for 'em, then!

K: What?

I: You're perfectly capable, you've learned a lot about outdoor survival from Dad.

Jamee: I've never had to use any of it. I don't have real experience.

I: You have enough. If you tried as much at you do with game competitions, you'd do fucking fantastic.

D: He doesn't need to do any of that. Unless he chooses to.

Jamee: I don't.

I: Listen, you're always talking about ""I'm a modern knight. I help people in need."" talking nice to people does not make you a knight.

Jamee: I've never said I'm a knight. I love what they stand for, but I don't think i can live up to that.

I: I swear, you talk about it like you're Sir Roland. Like the reference?

Jamee: Yeah, I get it.

They continue dining, Jamee regretting bringing work to the table.

  
  


Vince and Kariwase are driving near a great lake, the water much calmer. Wildlife is all around, suggesting little danger. They reach a long natural wall of stone, leading up to a treacherous mountain. A shadow cast by the mountain above slightly obscures a grisly scene below. Kariwase sounds disgusted.

Kariwase: That's her.

  
  


Vince seems choked up. Mainly because he was hoping not to find her remains. But also, the smell.

They get out, covering their noses to take a closer look.

Vince: How do you know?

Kariwase: I heard him kill her boyfriend. He'd just heard my whistle.

Vince: Shit...

Shes been smashed all over with a rock. Some broken glasses are about the only thing recognizable on her face. Her shirt matches the torn fabric. Kariwase holds them up to compare, then she takes a picture with her phone.

She reenters the truck.

Kariwase: We'll stop and get your ATV. You should ride back and get some better help for your wound.

Vince: Are you sure? Let me watch the drone for a minute, maybe we'll find Arvyndas!

Kariwase grumbles.

Kariwase: No. Go back.

Vince is a little afraid. He wonders whether something similar is happening to her.

Vince: I'll go.

They drive back down the road in silence. Kariwase makes a sort of ""I don't want to talk"" face. Vince ignores it.

Vince: We have to do something for him.

Kariwase: Your gun didn't hurt him. What do you suggest?

Vince: Lets both meet up with the other Rangers. We have a better chance.

Kariwase: (sighs) not a terrible idea.

Kariwase seems truly shaken for the first time.

Kariwase: What happened to him?

Vince: Sounds like... his mind is broken. It might be the job.

Kariwase: He loved his job. He loved being in the woods.

More of the lake passes by them. Very calm.

Kariwase: It makes no sense for Arvyndas to go so mad out here.

They drive past a beach. Kariwase tries to contact the other Rangers now that fewer mountains block signals.

This is Kariwase. We're at the south end of the lake. Arvyndas is killing the lost people. I’m sorry, we've, found the couple's bodies. I don’t know if he's responsible for both of their deaths, but I'm sure he killed the boyfriend. Can you send anyone out? Respond.

Static.

Kariwase: We need armed Rangers out here. Respond.

She hangs her head, feeling defeated. Vince keeps driving up the beach, thinking of something to say.

Vince:... I'm sorry.

Kariwase loosens up a bit.

Kariwase: We have to do this ourselves.

Vince nods, looking at his pistol.

Vince: We'll need a special kind of weapon. More than this.

Kariwase: I don't have anything like that. Besides my pistol, my hunting rifle's the only firearm I've got.

Vince takes a quick look in the back.

Vince: How about a flare?

Kariwase is intrigued.

Kariwase: Not a terrible idea, Vince.

She climbs into the back, holding rails for support, and fishes out the flare gun.

Kariwase: Just might work.

the next we see is the truck stopping next to the beach, Vince and Kariwase move up to a shadowed cliff dense with brush and watch the truck.

They sit, and sure enough, Arvyndas walks quietly up to the truck, holding the boyfriend's body. Kariwase does not aim the flare at him. This causes Vince to look from her to Arvyndas, expecting her to fire.

Vince: Shoot him.

She shakes her head, watching Arvyndas place the boyfriends head in the back of the truck, and place the rock that killed the woman in his left hand, and a fistful of her hair in his right. Arvyndas seems very sad. He looks at the body, feeling just terrible.

Kariwase: Look at him.

She watches as Arvyndas walks, mournful, back into the wood.

Vince isn't having any of this.

Vince: Shoot hi-i-im.

Kariwase: No. I want to see what he's left in the back.

Vince: Fuck that...

He rips the flare gun out of her hands and fires at Arvyndas. It doesn’t hit him. It lands a bit behind Arvyndas and starts a fire in a small bush. He turns, and looks just below the cliff upon which they hide.

Kariwase and Vince have withdrawn further behind the hill.

Kariwase: You piece of shit. I think he saw us.

Vince: I'll fix that.

He grits his teeth, and pulls out his pistol. He fires three times, but an axe hits him in the face. Arvyndas has thrown it, killing him instantly.

Kariwase breathes quietly, preparing her own pistol. She isn't approached by him, strangely enough. She chances a peek over her left shoulder, and sees him putting out the fire with water from the beach, using his hat. He leaves for the forest once again.

Kariwase is alone. For her, the sun is bright, but it gives no warmth. She starts to stand up again, looking over the body of Vince. She closes her eyes. A few moments. She climbs down the cliff. She reaches the back of the truck, where the boyfriend's body lies. She visually scans it, attempting to understand the rock and the hair.

Kariwase: Is Arvyndas... pinning the murder on him?

She carefully lifts up the rock, looking at the body.

Kariwase: Or was it this one?

She looks around, back to where Arvyndas has vanished. she walks in after him. She calls out, hoping to converse with whatever Arvyndas has become.

Kariwase: What did those mean? In his hands?

Arvyndas is lying on a mossy hill. He smiles at her, as one does with knowledge others don't have. He gets up slowly, and acts it out.

He imitates a car being driven, then points to the rock wall. He then points to the body in the truck, and pretends to grip a person tightly by their hair with one hand, then club them to death using the rock in the other. He looks meaningfully up at Kariwase. Then points hatefully at the body again.

Kariwase: He bludgeoned her. I get it. What a fucking maniac.

She changes the subject.

Kariwase: What happened to you?

Arvyndas tries to speak, but it pains him immensely. He gives up on that. He instead gestures with both hands to the woods all around. The wind, the bugs, the birds, all of it.

Kariwase: Nature. You've somehow become nature.

Arvyndas strides calmly around, feeling a true freedom. The frame-rate lowers, and it's in a slower motion, just to give us a feel of tranquility, of living on a calmer frequency, as he almost dances around, not a care in the world.

Kariwase walks with him, enjoying it nearly as much, but troubled by his stark white face. She still has a question.

Kariwase: Why did you try to kill us?

Arvyndas thinks, then spreads his arms, and shakes his head, looking concerned.

Kariwase: Not nature, but-

Arvyndas points to his shadow.

Kariwase: Darkness.

She stares at Arvyndas, wondering how much of himself remains.

Kariwase: Is it still you, Arvyndas?

Arvyndas looks back at her, smiling kindly, and nods. Its a little hard to tell, but its a real, sincere smile.

He goes back to his idle stroll, his path never straight. His steps almost like a dance.

Kariwase: Guess there's no point bringing you back.

Arvyndas shakes his head. He wishes to stay.

Kariwase: I'm going to miss you.

Arvyndas makes a quick grunt. He picks, and eats a berry.

Kariwase: You will too, right?

Arvyndas is off in his own world. Kariwase returns to the truck, and closes up the rear doors. She drives away from this bizarre situation. She makes it back by evening. Back to her house. She hangs up her jacket and falls on the couch. She turns on her phone, and tries to forget the three dead, one gone seemingly mad, all in one day. She dials Jamee.

Kariwase: Hello, Jamee. I found em. She was killed by her boyfriend. You want to tell the police? I need to sleep.

Jamee: They’re probably gonna want to hear it from you.

Kariwase: God... Alright, tomorrow morning. I’ll tell them the whole thing.

Jamee: Thanks a million, Kariwase. Are you okay?

She looks out the widow. The sun is setting over this little city...

Kariwase: I lived. That feels good, at least.

Jamee: There you go. You’re tough as c-

The phone call is interrupted. The boyfriend, Dylan, is infected by the forest's ""darkness"". a very wicked being, based on our experience. He's crawled in through the window, and snuck up behind the couch. Kariwase lowers the phone in mid-conversation, feeling something's amiss.

Dylan almost grabs Kariwase around the neck. She jabs a knife into his forearm, causing his hand to be stuck to the couch's back. Kariwase jumps out of the couch, seeing Dylan reach and thrash at her.

She looks around for another weapon. she calmly opens a utensil drawer, and picks up a corkscrew. From outside, a Jogger spots her moving toward a nearly rabid Dylan, through her kitchen window. He slowly moves to the house, watching the window.

Kariwase thrusts the corkscrew at Dylan, who in one motion grabs the knife suddenly out of his forearm, and slashes Kariwase's leg.

Kariwase steps back, wincing facially, then throws her coat at Dylan. he throws the coat off quickly, but Kariwase has already rushed into him. She uses both her hands on Dylan's knife hand, and rams him into the floor, landing on the back of his head. He seems only slightly dazed, but that's enough for Kariwase to force his knife hand upward, into his heart. He goes still. The lack of blood makes him simply appear ill.

That nosy jogger looks, terrified, through the window.

The Jogger quiets. He moves away from the window.

Kariwase: Wait a minute.

The jogger flees down the street, trying to find a Police Officer to report what hes just seen Kariwase do.

Kariwase runs out the door, down the street after him. He panics. She raises a knife, about to throw it. No one else seems to notice this.

Jogger: Help! Help!

Kariwase stops chasing him.

Kariwase: He was possessed. Tell them that.

The Jogger doesn't acknowledge.

Kariwase: Tell them that!

The Jogger turns a corner around the block, heading for the police station.

We see a short montage. Kariwase is arrested. Her mugshot is taken. She's being led to a prison cell. She's not resisting, but she scans the crowd around her. The face of Dylan appears; the one who seemed unable to die. It's a wonder the crowd doesn't notice him—such a freakish sight. She double-takes, back to where she saw Dylan's face, but it's gone. She walks on, to her cell.

One night, she is visited. The door opens without any key being turned. She moves away from the door.

Kariwase: I don't need anything.

Kariwase breathes a bit heavier. Dylan's form walks eerily and shakily into the cell. Kariwase growls at him.

Kariwase: I don't know what you are, but I didn't do anything to you. I was out there to save that couple.

Dylan looks to a wall. He speaks sloppily, like one who hasn't quite mastered speaking yet.

Dylan: You didn't save them.

Kariwase: No, I didn't. Because of you, right?

Dylan picks at the wall idly.

Dylan: Yes, because of me. I didn't like them much. Especially this one.

Kariwase: Explain yourself.

Dylan: Uh, how do I say this? I do... what gives me pleasure. What's the point of doing anything else?

Kariwase: I do too, but there's a line.

Dylan looks her madly in the eye.

Dylan: Ohh, no there isn't. You've been grievously misinformed.

Kariwase: Who are you to give such advice?

Dylan: More than you...

Kariwase steps further away from him.

Kariwase: Why haven't you tried to kill me, again?

Dylan: You could be a greater instrument than this one. I think you'd like it.

Kariwase doesn't answer. Dylan nods toward the door, and slinks out.

Kariwase follows after.

He leads her down through the prison, and as she follows, she notices several teams of guards dead on the ground, all killed with a blade.

Kariwase: You could've just possessed one of them. You didn't really have to kill anyone.

Dylan stops. He turns around.

Dylan: You've killed. Innocents, too. Don't lie.

Kariwase is stunned. The spirit possessing Dylan clearly knows some things that ordinary people don't.

Dylan: I want you to see this, here...

Dylan exits the prison, through an open gate meant for the bus to come through, also littered with bodies.

Kariwase: You're bloodthirsty... what about it?

Dylan: I've seen it in you, Kariwase. You are in no position to judge.

Kariwase: I hope you understand... I'm not going to be your ""vessel"", or whatever you called it.

Dylan: That's alright. I'll find a way. In the meantime, all I want you to do is go back to your work. Best for you, and me. You won't have any more trouble with the law. I can make sure of that.

He walks her out to a car. The door opens for her, despite no buttons or keypads being pressed. She stands and watches him for a second, who grins foully back at her. She feels she has no choice but to enter the car. It speeds away without her command, and races down the highway, back to her house.

She hastily exits the vehicle, which immediately drives itself away.

She walks down the sidewalk, and gets noticed by the jogger.

Jogger: Hey, you were sent to prison! What are you doing-

His neck is snapped by an invisible force...

Faintly, Kariwase hears some low laughing. The Jogger's body quickly rots, and fades into the ground. Kariwase stares at the ground in horror, then continues on her path.

She heads inside. Nothing seems warm, or bright in here, unlike last time. She can't seem to relax. She enters the next room to see-

Arvyndas, filthy with general forest debris, and looking somehow even more feral than usual, sits on the couch, his senses regained.

Kariwase: Arvyn!

Arvyndas's eyes light up to see her, to see clearly again. But he doesn't speak. Some attempts are made, but it sounds like he's trying to clear his throat, and can barely manage the effort.

He scrapes his face with his fingers, desperately wanting to communicate in a better way...

He stands up. He points to the hallway.

Kariwase: Yeah, that's where he was. The ""dark spirit"", right?

Arvyndas nods slowly, his eyes full of fear. It affects Kariwase.

She looks to the hallway.

K: He's not here. We've struck some sort of deal. I don't really get it, but I don't think he'll be bothering us.

Arvyndas relaxes, starting to breathe more slowly now.

The room gets a little brighter. Seemingly just as Kariwase joins him on the couch, relaxing as well.

K: He says i should ""go back to work."" That's all I can do. Do you want to go with me?

Arvyndas nods happily. Kariwase looks at him, blinking.

K: What are you doing here?

Arvyndas pats the couch.

K: Yes, it's very nice.

Kariwase leans back, and falls asleep, within seconds.

\_\_

The next morning, Kariwase awakes sprawled awkwardly across the couch. She looks, bleary-eyed, around the cluttered room, for Arvyndas.

K: Arvyn? Where'd you go?

She's a little bothered that he didn't stay the night after such a disturbing few days.

K: The real Arvyn would've stayed the night.

She looks, a bit too long, at the dirt-stained spot on the couch where Arvyndas was sitting. She gets up, and puts on a pot of cowboy coffee. She turns on the TV as she passes it to get a mug from the cupboard. The news is on, two Anchors chattering madly about the latest development.

Anchor: - by Esports professional Jamee Samson, which resulted in a literal walkout for the remainder of the game tournament, all chanting, ""Vivi must be nerfed!"".

Kariwase changes the channel to another news station with her remote.

Anchor 2: The Colorado wilderness claims another. 25-year-old Courtney Hayle of Nebraska was found, brutally murdered by an unknown assailant. However, this morning, a forensics crew identified one woman, supposedly one of the search and rescue volunteers, Kari-

Anchor 2 gasps, and chokes, their face horrified. They fall to their knees, and start to retch all over the glossy white floor. ANCHOR 3 stands up, and runs toward the film crew, but they don't reach. Their legs are cut from under them, by an invisible blade, and they fall to the ground.

By now, there are various shouts of fear and distress from the camera crew, but the signal abruptly cuts off before we can see or hear any more.

Thoroughly disturbed, watching a blank screen over her coffee, she flips the channel to a kids show. Something like *SpongeBob Squarepants.* She doesn't feel like anything else, just yet. Hopefully, the ""Pickles"" episode, where SpongeBob yells,

SpongeBob (TV): *I. can't. do it!* I can't *do it*, Mr. Krabs!

Kariwase looks, down, deep in thought, feeling the same way.

A silence lasts a while longer, until it's interrupted by:

Voice: Time to go to work, Kari.

Kariwase doesn't react right away. She doesn't want to be thought of as a test subject. She slowly tears her gaze away from the floor, and grabs her keys.

Careful listeners will actually hear that this was Arvyndas. The other one wouldn't call her 'Kari'.

\_\_

Back out in a clearing, in the bright wilderness, Kariwase leans up against the SAR truck.

Kariwase calls out to the quiet woods.

Kariwase: I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing.

There is a dramatic, downward musical note, as a dark vignette effect pulses, Kariwase almost falling asleep on the spot.

She forces herself awake, holding on tightly to the door of the truck, as if for a raft at sea.

  
  


Kariwase isn't willing to take this, anymore. She hops in the truck, and starts the engine, but her attention is caught by a rock that suddenly hits the right side of the truck. She cranes her neck to look out the right window, and sees Arvyndas speeding toward her, waving one arm, face stricken with horror.

She reaches for her pistol, but recognizes him, looking relieved, within seconds.

Kariwase: Arvyndas!

She stops the engine, and leans her arm out of the window, smiling casually. For a few moments, at least. She sees the look on his face, and his sense of urgency becomes apparent.

She turns the keys, as Arvyndas climbs inside the cab. She drives off, heading down the road, towards the lake.

The engine roars to life, when we see Dylan. In the back. Watching them, amused, like... well, test subjects.

\_\_

When Kariwase feels the moment has calmed, she tries at another partial conversation.

Kariwase: What are you so freaked out about?

Arvyndas pretends to stab a corkscrew into his neck. She smiles a little, proudly.

Kariwase: Yeah, I did pretty well there, I think.

Her face lowers.

Kariwase: Didn't kill him.

Arvyndas can't stand to see her like this. He gently lifts her head back up by her chin. She smiles kindly at him.

Kariwase: What do you think we should try?

Arvyndas thinks, a long while, then smiles confidently. He opens a small satchel on Kariwase's belt and takes out a silver, bullet-shaped lighter. He twirls it in front of her, and she tries to pay as much attention to it as the road will allow, sporadically looking at it.

Kariwase: God, that's pretty much what Vince said to do.

Arvyndas smiles more, and nods, excited.

Kariwase: I hate to do it, but that thing is evil. It has to be put down.

Arvyndas's smiles turns into a wide snarl. He relishes the thought.

Kariwase chances a look at Arvyndas. A look of great uncertainty. She wonders how much of Arvyndas is left.

Kariwase: I don't like you like this.

Arvyndas doesn't do anything. He just stares forward, holding his breath.

Kariwase: It doesn't feel natural. Something must've went wrong if Nature needs to take human form.

Arvyndas lowers his head, and looks at her, nodding, eyebrows raised.

Kariwase: Couldn't have gotten anyone else? What's so important about me, Arvyn?

He hugs her. She smiles, and hugs him back with one hand.

Kariwase: Thanks but... that doesn't really answer my question.

Arvyndas places his hand over his heart.

Kariwase: We're just good friends? Is that really the only reason?

Arvyndas nods, slowly and sincerely.

Kariwase: That's fine with me, I guess.

She accelerates, turning a rather sharp corner, which dislodges the hidden passenger in the back.

Dylan is flung up against the inside of the ambulance.

Kariwase and Arvyndas both look behind.

Dylan hisses at them nastily. Sunken, black eyes stare back at them, until Arvyndas steps into the back, and smacks him across the face with a wrench.

Dylan scrambles to a crouching position, smirks creepily, and simply opens his hand, whose fingernails suddenly appear claw-like, his fingers three-pronged.

He starts with Arvyndas. Dylan points his opened, clawed hand at him, and begins to drain the soul from his body. One of them, anyway. We see a brief, visual effect, somewhat like a white flash, coming from Arvyndas. He blinks, suddenly aware.

Arvyndas: Kariwase! Burn him! You have to burn him! It's the only thing tha-

He is cut off. Dylan had lunged at him, knocking him into the seat, and now tries to scratch mercilessly at him. Arvyndas is able to restrain Dylan's arms from doing too much.

Kariwase stops the car, but doesn't use the parking brake. No time. She rushes into the back to help Arvyndas fight off Dylan. Arvyndas summons more strength, and forces Dylan off, pushing him into a ready Kariwase, who stands holding a long survival blade.

Dylan is impaled on it, much of Kariwase's arm sticking out of the hole. He looks, frozen in fear, at his wound.

In a few moments, they start to droop, looking very tired, indeed. His head bobs around. It almost looks like he's headbanging to a very inconsistent beat.

He growls suddenly, and savagely.

Dylan: *There are three more like me.* I want you to find them. If for nothing else, to witness greatness. See what we're truly supposed to be.

Kariwase rips the blade out of him, roaring mightily. She stabs him in the head. His body flops to the floor.

She stands there, panting, heart still racing from such an encounter. Arvyndas looks from the body, to her, gets up, and watches the body with one arm around her.

They both look distraught.

2.) cables from water sensor to main control unit

After working through 1 and 2 (thanks @Clive Coffee!), it was clear the control unit was at fault. The problem was, I couldnt find the part (US1004) anywhere!

PSA: The M2004 control unit is confirmed to be working well as a replacement for the existing US1004. From talking with Clive (and reaching out to Profitec direclty), it is unlcear whether anyone knows this is the future replacement. As well it explains the massive backlog every distributor is facing tring to keep US1004 in stock. 

The only noticible difference is the M2004 only has 1 screw hole on the bottom, where the US1004 had 2. I had to reverse the orientation of the new unit and get a longer screw, but that was easy. ",1,1749495157.0,profitec,0,1.0,False

The rest of the summer passed uneventfully until the first week in August. I saw Jesse a few times at parties, but we didn’t speak until Angie asked me to attend one of Justin’s softball games with her. When I realized Jesse was on his team, it had been a shock, but it shouldn’t have been. Even though he was awarded a full scholarship to Grant West University for basketball, I knew he was talented in other sports. And baseball had been one of the others. He and Ethan would spend hours in the backyard pitching the ball to each other. Most of the times it was wiffle ball, but both of them played softball and baseball during the summers. As I watched him, I swore I felt Ethan beside me. Everything was starting to tingle inside of me and I could smell his cologne. I swallowed thickly when I felt tears start to swell up. As I continued to sit through the first game, my brother’s presence was so strong. I couldn’t hold the tears anymore. After the last inning when Jesse’s team scored their last home run, I couldn’t watch him run the bases for home plate and I left the bleachers. Alex!” Angie called after me, but I kept going.  I brushed some of the tears away and hid in her car until the crowd had started to leave. It was twenty minutes later when I saw members of their team going towards their cars. As I hunkered down and waited for Angie, I looked up and gasped. Jesse stood in front of the car. His dark eyes held mine captive. Then he blinked and the small spell was broken. I held my breath and waited. A part of me knew he would leave and not care about me, but the other part of me thought he’d come to the window.  He did nothing. He stood there and stared at me.  
  I realized he was waiting for me to decide, so I opened the door and crawled out. My legs were unsteady as I leaned back against the car and he came around to my side. He smelled of sweat and dirt. The front of his softball uniform was covered in the field’s sand from when he had slid to the bases. Beads of sweat glistened on his forehead; his hair was drenched from it. Then he ran a hand through it and I saw it was water instead.  
  
  “What are you doing here?” he asked in a low voice. He had no emotion, as always.  
  
  I took a deep breath to calm my nerves. “Angie wanted to watch Justin. I came for support.”  
  
  His jaw clenched, he rubbed a hand over his chin.  
  
  Everything in me was chaos, but I rasped out, “I didn’t know you were on the team.”  
  
  “Why would that matter?”  
  
  My eyes jerked to his and I saw the question was real. I couldn’t stop a snort in disbelief. “Are you kidding? You hate me.”  
  
  “Oh.” Then he looked away.  
  
  My nerves were stretched to the max as I waited for him to talk. I needed something, anything. I wanted to hear that he didn’t hate me, but after another minute of silence I knew it wasn’t coming. My gut had been right.  
  
  When he turned back, his eyes were piercing. A dark emotion was there, but he held it back. “Come over tonight.”  
  
  “What?”  
  
  “Come over tonight.”  
  
  “Why? It’s not Ethan’s—”  
  
  But I was stopped as he stepped close. His body heat radiated off of him in waves and I held my breath. His fingers touched the side of my hip and he lowered his lips so they were an inch from mine. He said again, “Come over tonight.”  
  
  I closed my eyes when his hand touched the side of my face and I nodded. I would’ve given him anything in that moment. His lips touched my forehead in a soft kiss and then he ran his thumb over my cheek before he left.  
  
  “See ya, Hunt!” Justin hollered and I was jerked back to reality.  
  
  It was sweltering outside. I gasped for breath. As I fanned myself, I knew my entire face was red, but I couldn’t ignore Angie’s silence. I knew she had witnessed that and I knew she was biding her time until we were alone. And because I didn’t want to undergo an interrogation, I did something I hadn’t done in a year and a half.  
  
  I twisted around and shouted, “Jesse!”  
  
  He stopped and looked back, waiting.  
  
  “Alex?” Angie asked in a soft voice.  
  
  My heart was racing, but I took a deep breath. “Can I get a ride with you?”  
  
  He had pulled his black shades back on so his eyes were blocked, but he didn’t respond for a moment. And then his shoulder jerked up in a shrug and relief exploded inside of me. I trembled from the onslaught of it, but grabbed my purse and bolted around the car.  
  
  “Wha—huh?” Justin glanced at his girlfriend. “Ang?”  
  
  Her mouth snapped shut and she folded her arms.  
  
  I ignored it all and picked up my pace as Jesse had started for his car again. He didn’t wait for me until he got into the Ferrari. My fingers fumbled for the door handle. I cursed after the sixth try. It still wouldn’t open. He leaned across and opened it from the inside for me. When I climbed in, the air conditioner was already working and blasted me with cool air, but I glanced at him. I expected some scathing joke at my clumsiness, but there was nothing. His shades were in place and his lips were flat as he gunned the engine and we soared out of the parking lot.  
  
  When he went past my street, I looked over in surprise. “Where are we going?”  
  
  He didn’t answer. He kept driving.  
  
  Then we went past his street. I sat forward. “Seriously, Jesse. Where are we going?”  
  
  The corner of his lip twitched, but he asked in a low voice, “How are your folks?”  
  
  “What?”  
  
  “Don and Shelby. Your mom and dad. How are they?”  
  
  He had  
n’t asked about my parents since…I blinked. It’d been before Ethan’s death. A different tension filled my body and I was rigid from my eyeballs to my toenails. “Why are you asking?” I couldn’t keep out the anger and I grimaced against it. I hadn’t wanted him to hear that.  
  
  He looked over this time, but didn’t say anything for a second. When he returned to the street, I caught the slight frown on his face. “Is something wrong at home?”  
  
  That got a laugh out of me. “Are you kidding?”  
  
  The frown vanished. There was nothing again.  
  
  I couldn’t stop another laugh and the sound was ugly to my own ears. “No, Jesse. My family’s great. Don and Shelby have mourned the loss of their son in their own way, and me, I’ll be just fine.

 I’m just screwing his best friend at times.”  
  
  And then I stopped. I had so much more to say, but I held it back. What good would it do? It’d only scare him away. At that confession, my heart shifted a bit. I felt it shrink or move or slip further away. I was with Jesse with the hopes that he’d give me anything, even a crumb of his touch. I was that girl. I sat back and stared straight ahead. I was that girl, just hoping for anything.  
  
  Shame filled me.  
  
  Jesse didn’t say anything more until the car started to slow down. I saw that we were at the ocean. When we got out, the salt in the air stung my eyes. That was why I was crying again. It had to be the reason. But I didn’t have time to continue my own lie as Jesse was already down a hill. I followed behind on the path and slowed as I watched where he was leading us. When he sat on the sand where there was no one around, I stopped in my tracks.  
  
  Why there? Why then? What was he—?  
  
  “Would you stop thinking and sit beside me?” Jesse patted the seat beside him and I obliged. Of course I would oblige. Where else was I going to go?  
  
  We sat in silence for awhile, longer than I could handle. My heart kept pounding. It got louder the longer we sat until I thought I was going to burst.  
  
  Then he sighed. He had his arms draped over his knees as he stared out at the ocean. “Your brother and I were supposed to go surfing here last year after graduation. We made the plans that day. It was our stupid way of celebrating together, even though Sarah wanted me to have that damn dinner with her parents. I didn’t go to the party that night.”  
  
  I looked down. I’d forgotten that fact.  
  
  He took a deep breath and shook his head. “I’m going to Grant West, you know.”  
  
  “I know.”  
  
  “I won’t be here anymore.”  
  
  Tears filled my eyes. He hadn’t been here for a long time, but I bit my tongue.  
  
  He sounded apologetic. “I don’t want to talk about you and me, about—whatever. It’s done. It’s fine. We’ll deal with it, but you’ve got some good friends. Angie’s a good friend to you, so is Marissa. They both care about you, in their ways. So you should be okay, right?”  
  
  “Uh, what?”  
  
  He looked at me this time, but he never took the sunglasses off. The wall was so pretty and perfect. “You have friends that’ll look out for you next year. I won’t be here and your folks…they’re good parents. Hell, they raised me most the time.”  
  
  But that was when he had lost his mother and when his father became an absent one. And that was when Ethan was alive, when my parents could function as normal parents and when they still cared about the little things in life like their other child. That wasn’t now and that hadn’t been for a long time.  
  
  I said none of that. Instead, I gave him a small smile. “You’re right. I’ll be just fine.”  
  
  “Your brother would want that.”  
  
  Ethan would want a lot more, but I didn’t say that either. I sighed. “What are you doing, Jesse?”  
  
  The wind shifted and he went with it. The cold Jesse was back in place. I was startled to realize that he had opened to me, just a bit, but it was gone. I couldn’t see through his sunglasses, but I knew his eyes were dead again. “We should go back.”  
  
  And just like that, the rare moment was gone. It had slipped through my fingers and I hadn’t even realized I had the chance to grasp something. When he dropped me off at home, I hesitated to ask if he still wanted me to come over that night. I didn’t think I could take more of his rejection, so I waited the rest of the day at home, ignored Angie and Marissa’s text messages, and dressed in something sexy.  
  
  I shouldn’t have. I knew that, but as my heart pounded, I knew I couldn’t stay away. He had asked. It was enough for me, so I wore a slinky black dress. It was simple, something that I could’ve worn to a party or to a girl’s night out. I drove to his house.  
  
  My heart wouldn’t stop pounding. That was my normal heart rate now. My palms were sweaty and as I knocked on his door, I didn’t know what I was going to face.  
  
  When it opened, I held my breath. His housekeeper answered. Before I could open my mouth, she held an arm out and pointed inside. When she turned and waddled away, I heard her mumble under her breath, “Always Alex, he says. Always Alex, he says.”  
  
  As I walked through the mansion, the same cold feeling came to me. Goosebumps ran up and down my arms as I turned down the last hallway. His room was the last door, but when I opened it, I knew he wasn’t there.  
  
  I took a shuddering breath. It rattled in my lungs and I didn’t know what else to do.  
  
  Leave?  
  
  But then I couldn’t look away from his bed. It was a king size. The sheets were rumpled from when he had gotten up that morning. I knew how they felt. I shivered from the need I had to curl up among them. The nights I had spent in there had been the best sleep I’d gotten. Before I had fully made my decision, I slipped off my sandals and crawled underneath his sheets. They were so soft to the touch. I nestled under them.  
  
  My body started to relax and the fatigue started to slip in. My eyelids grew heavy, but before I drifted off to sleep, I thought I saw a black shape in the doorway. But then it didn’t matter and I was asleep.  
  
  “What? What is she doing here?!”  
  
  A shrill voice snapped me out of my sleep and I jerked upright.  
  
  “Shut up.” It was a low command.  
  
  “I won’t shut up! Look at her! What’s she doing there, Jesse? I thought you wanted me tonight and we find her in your bed!”  
  
  I rubbed my eyes and tried to make sense of what woke me up.  
  
  Then I heard a curse and he snapped, “Fucking leave then.”  
  
  “What?” The girl calmed down and whimpered. “But I thought—”  
  
  “I don’t give a shit. Go.”  
  
  And then the door shut behind them and I lay back down, exhausted once again. It wasn’t long before it opened again and I sat back up. As I yawned, Jesse stood inside the door, frowning at me.  
  
  I continued my yawn. “You told me to come over last night.”  
  
  Then he yawned and rubbed a hand over his face. There were lines of exhaustion around his eyes and for a moment, they were sad. My heart skipped a beat. I resisted the urge to pull him into my arms. But then the look vanished and he grimaced at me. “I didn’t think you’d still come.”  
  
  I looked away, gathering the bedcovers around me. “You hoped I wouldn’t still come.”  
  
  Then he sighed. The bed sank underneath his weight and he sat against the headboard beside me. “Do you blame me?”  
  
  I swung around and searched him. The fatigue was back on his face, but the wall had fallen. Hope sparked inside of me. It leapt like a flame in a fire that’d been smoldering. It was hungry and wanted more, but I contained it. I kept my voice under control as I asked, “Why didn’t you want me to come?”  
  
  “Because I goddamn feel everything.” His voice was gruff. “I’m sick of feeling, Alex. Only you. No other girl makes me feel this shit I don’t want to.”  
  
  And without thinking, I reached out and took his hand in mine. Our fingers slid against each other and then I nestled back underneath the covers. It wasn’t long before he sighed again and scooted behind me. His arm came over my waist and one of his legs slipped between mine. When his chest started to rise and fall in a deep slumber, I allowed a small smile.  
  
  I didn’t know what was in store for the future, but I didn’t want to be anywhere else except in his arms. But then my gut kicked and I knew this temporary shelter would be ripped away once more.  
  
  Jesse was always ripped away from me.  
  
  CHAPTER FOUR  
  
  When we woke up, it was the afternoon. Normally we would be intimate the night before and go our separate ways the next day, but this time we went backwards. I woke up when Jesse nudged me onto my back and then moved above me. When my eyes opened, I knew what was happening and I wanted it. As his lips touched my neck, I wound my legs around his. Soon we were both groaning.  
  
  An hour later, after we were done an  
d Jesse had collapsed on top of me, he groaned and got up. He padded barefoot into his bathroom. His shower turned on and I took that as my cue. Instead of my dress, I nabbed one of his larger shirts and shorts. I knew they weren’t Ethan’s so I knew Jesse wouldn’t care. As soon as I was dressed, I hurried out of there.  
  
  When I got home, I had an hour to shower and get to my shift at the mall. The house was empty as I rushed upstairs, but I was used to it. It seemed that my dad lived at his offices and my mother was usually in bed at all hours of the day. It wasn’t until I pulled into the mall’s parking lot that I realized I hadn’t heard the television in my parents’ bedroom. Mom always fell asleep to the news. For some reason, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up, but I tried to shake the uneasy feeling. I’m sure my mother was okay. She was always okay, distant but okay.  
  
  Ben arrived at the coffee hut at the same time as me. It didn’t take long for the other two girls to leave and we got comfortable. It was a weekend night; we wouldn’t have that much business. And after an hour when we hadn’t had one customer, the sight of Angie and Marissa had me feeling giddy. Ben stopped in the middle of his story, but I was okay with that. I couldn’t hear much more about his dog, Mickey, who liked to hump other dogs and was the happiest English Cocker Spaniel there was in the world.  
  
  “Hey, guys!”  
  
  Both shared a look at my bright smile.  
  
  “What?” I rolled my eyes. “You guys want coffee?”  
  
  “No.” Angie snorted. “We’re just at the coffee hut to smell the merchandise, not actually to buy it.”  
  
  Marissa grinned and tightened her hold on the bags in her hands.  
  
  “Where’d you guys go?” I tried to count the bags, but there were too many. I wasn’t surprised. Marissa was the shopper in the group.  
  
  She shrugged and flipped her black hair over her shoulder. “Just some stores. I got a sexy outfit for school. You need to go with me next week. I’ve seen your wardrobe. You need something sexy for the first day.”  
  
  Angie narrowed her eyes. “Where were you last night? Justin had people over, but neither of us could get a hold of you all night.”  
  
  Ben sucked in his breath beside me. He started to hum from his excitement.  
  
  I shrugged. “I stayed home. I didn’t feel like going out.”  
  
  “But you couldn’t tell me that? I texted you a million times.”  
  
  Marissa arched her eyebrows and looked at Angie in surprise. She bit her lip as a frown formed.  
  
  “I know. I’m sorry. I’ve been out of sorts.”  
  
  “You’ve been out of sorts for a long time,” Angie snapped and crossed her arms. “What’s going on with you?”  
  
  “Hey—” Marissa opened her mouth.  
  
  “I don’t need a friend intervention. I’m fine. I’ve just been sad lately. Get off my back,” I snapped back.  
  
  “You took off with Jesse yesterday.”  
  
  “You did?!” Ben’s breathing picked up. He whispered underneath his breath, “That is awesome.”  
  
  “You did?” Marissa’s tone chilled and she moved back a step. Her arms formed over her chest as she mirrored Angie’s pose. “I thought the two of you were nothing to each other. When did this change?”  
  
  I felt caught in their sights. And something told me they both knew more than they were sharing. So, I sighed in surrender and asked, “What have you heard?”  
  
  Both girls frowned and glared at me, but Marissa was colder than Angie. Her shoulders squared back and she raised her chin. “Just that Casey Wright said you were in Jesse’s bed last night. She left the party with him, but came back an hour later majorly pissed off. And the things she was saying about you…if I wasn’t so pissed that you lied to us the whole night, I would’ve taken her out.”  
  
  I froze as I heard her words.  
  
  They both knew I lied.  
  
  This was not good.  
  
  Then I looked at Angie. Her eyes had softened, but I saw the hurt in them. “I’m sorry for lying.”  
  
  She softened even more. Her arms fell back down to her side. “It’s—whatever. I guess. So what’s going on with you two?”  
  
  Marissa looked away.  
  
  I wasn’t going to win with either of them, but they deserved the truth. I only hoped that I wouldn’t lose Marissa’s friendship because of it. “I thought you supported the idea of Jesse and me.”  
  
  “I did, but you’d been distant and even quieter since graduation two months ago.” Her hands lifted in the air. “What do you want from me? You’ve been off since Ethan died and you were finally becoming a little more normal until that night. Since you left with Jesse that night—”  
  
  “Wait. How do you know that?”  
  
  “I saw you.” Marissa sounded hurt too. “You never responded to my text, so I came out to make sure you were okay. I saw the two of you and he got in your car. It doesn’t take a genius, Alex. I knew what you did. And you never came to Barnies the next day for breakfast.”  
  
  “And you’ve been so distant from us since then. We can’t even depend on you to hang out with us. I mean, Justin had a party last night and you wouldn’t respond to our text messages.”  
  
  Ben harrumphed beside me. “She didn’t text me back either.”  
  
  I swung around. “You texted me?”  
  
  He shrugged and edged to the side. “I would’ve. I thought about it.”  
  
  I continued to stare at him.  
  
  He looked away and busied himself with a customer that had approached on the side. “Hi! How can I help you?”  
  
  I turned back to my friends. “I’m sorry. I am. I, just, I don’t know what to say.”  
  
  “So are you guys together or what? Casey said she got booted out by him. He took one look at you and practically threw her out of his home. Granted, I loved hearing that she got booted on her ass, but…” Marissa trailed off and shared another dark look with Angie. She took a breath, as if to ready herself. “But what’s going on? Are you guys dating?”  
  
  I looked away. What could I say? No, we weren’t. My friends would lecture me on how I needed to be a strong woman. I couldn’t give up the jewels for nothing, but they didn’t know what it was like. I could escape with him, only him. It wouldn’t be the same with anyone else. I would feel empty. I did feel empty with everyone else, even spending time with people.  
  
  Jesse understood.  
  
  Then I lifted my shoulders in a helpless shrug. “I don’t know what to say. Jesse loved him, too.”  
  
  “Oh!” Angie’s eyes went wide.  
  
  Marissa looked horrified.  
  
  “Oh my gawd. I didn’t even think about that.” Angie surged forward. Her hand clamped down on mine where it was on the counter. She squeezed it. “I am so sorry, Alex. We—we didn’t even think about that.” Her shoulders sagged. “I’m a horrible friend. I should’ve thought about that.”  
  
  “Yeah, well, don’t worry about it.” My tone was casual, but I couldn’t ignore the guilt in my stomach. It spread throughout me. I looked anywhere but at my friends. I shouldn’t have pulled away and I knew I had. Angie was right. Since graduation night, I had steadily stopped responding to them and hanging out with them.  
  
  “Okay, um…” Marissa still bit her lip, but she forced a cheery voice out. “There’s a thing at the baseball fields tonight. It’s like a midnight tournament. Do you want to go?”  
  
  I held my breath. Did I?  
  
  She added with a whine to her voice, “Jesse will be there. The whole thing’s like a goodbye to him tonight.”  
  
  And that was my reminder that he had become the school’s star over the last year. He went from an above average athlete to excelling where no one could touch his records. I forgot how much Jesse had achieved over the last year, but in a sense I understood. He pursued anything that would keep his mind from Ethan. I did the same, but that meant I pulled away from everyone else.  
  
  Ben gushed out, “Can I come, too?”  
  
  Both Angie and Marissa cracked a smile.  
  
  Then Angie questioned, “Alex?”  
  
  I already knew I was going. Who was I kidding? I nod  
ded my head. I was glutton for punishment and seeing Jesse in his element was definitely going to be a punishment for me.  
  
  Ben clapped his hands together. “Oh, goody! I can’t wait. I have the perfect shirt in mind.

My neuro said that he has one patient who had fatigue issues that only finally got better when she started doing keto (of course he also had to mention how incredibly unhealthy keto is 😆).

I've done keto for about 3 weeks since my diagnosis, done it before strict for 6 months. I feel better when I do keto, not perfect/normal, but I don't or way less so get crashes where I get dizzy, sick and fatigued and I really want to keep up eating keto at least, but wonder how many of you have had even better results without any fruit and veg.

I think I couln't do lion and would still have coffee, occasional zero soft drink and some spices, so definiertnietly rather ketovore than carnivore.

And Marissa rivaled her in the looks department. She was petite, with jet black hair, dark almond eyes, and a personality that dubbed her Sullivan High School’s man eater. Even........","CHAPTER ONE  
  
  When I got to the bonfire, the smell of fire and booze filled the air. Underneath was the smell of sweat. My nose wrinkled up and I grimaced, but headed towards it. The guys had been partying all day since it was the last day of school. I was glad I didn’t smell anything worse. People swarmed in the woods as I continued towards wherever the fire would be. That’s where my friends would be. Angie and Marissa liked to be the center of attention. Angie was the willowy blonde with a model’s look. Her blue eyes seemed to launch out of her body. They were intense, smoky, and had ensnared most of the male population in our school. And Marissa rivaled her in the looks department. She was petite, with jet black hair, dark almond eyes, and a personality that dubbed her Sullivan High School’s man eater. Even though we had finished our junior year and had three months of summer before we started our reign as seniors, I knew they wanted to start early. Those two were ready for the senior girls to leave so they could take the crown as the queens of our school.  
  
  “Alex!”  
  
  And there was one of them.  
  
  I couldn’t stop a chuckle as Angie leaned over her boyfriend’s shoulder and waved at me. She was so eager; she tipped forward and fell down his body and to the floor. She’d been standing on a truck and her movement sent a jerking movement underneath the rest of the girls who danced there. They screamed, grabbing onto anything to steady them. A group of guys stood around the truck. Some of the guys were ogling the girls, but some of them were chatting with their friends. More than a few jumped forward and couldn’t hide their smirks when the girls grabbed them for balance.  
  
  Justin looked down at Angie on the ground, sighed, and continued talking with his friend.  
  
  “Alex!” Her shout turned into a whine and I took her hand. As I hauled her back to her feet, she groaned. “I’m so embarrassed.”  
  
  “You shouldn’t be.” She’d done it enough times over the past year since she had started drinking. Then I glanced around. “Where’s Marissa?”  
  
  “Where else?” She drew upright. Her tone turned snippy. “Trying to hit on your man. I don’t know why she even tries. He doesn’t want a girlfriend since he broke up with Sarah. Everyone can see that Jesse Hunt is the hit ‘em and quit ‘em guy this year. Seriously. He’s hooked up with someone at every single party.” She threw her arm around in a circle and her voice raised a notch. “And everyone also knows that if he’s going to date someone, it’s going to be you.”  
  
  The slight enjoyment I had when I first got to the party died. “Stop, Angie. Jesse and I aren’t friends. We’re nothing.”  
  
  She snorted.  
  
  “And if he was going to date someone, it would be Sarah. It wouldn’t be me. He was with her for three years, remember? Those types of feelings don’t vanish.”  
  
  She snorted again. Her chest jerked up and down and she crossed her arms. “I’m going to get more beer. You want any?”  
  
  I shook my head.  
  
  She left even before she saw my response, but she knew I didn’t drink. The only two times I ever had any alcohol were the two times I got wasted. Both nights intermingled with harsh memories, memories I didn’t even want to think about now.  
  
  “Alex!”  
  
  This time it was Marissa. She had a bright smile on her face as she hurried around a group. She held a cup of beer in one hand and was wiping her face with the other as she stopped next to me. She panted for a second, but then flipped her black locks over her shoulder. Her hand went to her hip and just like that, her pose could’ve been in a magazine.  
  
  “Hey.” I was half warm, half cautious. Was she going to talk about Jesse? He’d been her obsession for the last month. I knew she didn’t want to really date him, but she did want to sleep with him. Marissa had always harbored feelings for him most of our lives. She never uttered a word to me until the last two months when she realized that Jesse and I were more strangers than what we had been.  
  
  She latched onto my arm. I fought from cringing from her beer breath as she fanned herself. “Okay, first: Jesse is an ass.”  
  
  I relaxed. Finally.  
  
  “But, holy cow, that makes him so super hot. Am I weird? I must be wired backwards. I dunno, but I want him even more. I swear. Can you talk to him? Tell him I’m good in bed. No, wait. He has to know I am. I mean, hello.” Then she frowned and her eyes crinkled together. “Wait. What was I talking about?”  
  
  “Marissa.”  
  
  “What?” She perked up. Her nails dug into my arm.  
  
  “Let go of my arm.”  
  
  “Oh!” Her eyes went wide again. “Oh my gosh! I am so sorry, Alex. Did I hurt you? Please tell me I didn’t. I’m such an idiot. What was I talking about before?”  
  
  I peered closer. She didn’t look that drunk.  
  
  “Oh, that’s right!” Her whole body jerked up in an excited spasm. She clapped her hand to her cheek. “Please talk to Jesse. I know you say you don’t want to. I know you say you’re not friends with him, but I know you are. I know you both are still close, so do you think you could put in a good word for me?”  
  
  “I…” I had no words. Even for Marissa, this was more forward than she’d ever been before. She had to have been drunk because the alternate option was that my best friend was incredibly insensitive to me. Had she not forgotten about the last year? Or why Jesse and I weren’t close anymore?  
  
  And then someone threw their beer on her. She was soaked in an instant. Her mouth fell open. Anger filled her face, along with shock, but her eyes were wide as she turned. Angie stood there with a smug smile and an empty cup. She waved it at Marissa before her hand fell to her hip. Both of them faced off against each other. Angie stepped close. She was taller and looked down her nose at Marissa. “Are you kidding me? You did not just ask Alex to put in a good word with Jesse for you? Are you serious? Seriously?!”  
  
  “You bitch!” Marissa screeched. She wrung her hands in the air, as if she wasn’t sure what to do with them.  
  
  “Guys.” I started to step between them.  
  
  I was hauled back by Justin; he bypassed me to grab Angie’s shoulders. He turned her away, but sent a scathing look at Marissa as he did.  
  
  Her hands flew in the air. “What?” she snapped at him.  
  
  His eyes flickered once. A dark look was in them and her hands fell back down. She took a breath, looked at me, and took another breath.  
  
  I looked away. I didn’t know what I was supposed to do. Comfort her? She was wrong. It’d been too much for her to ask, but she had a beer thrown on her because of me. I had no idea what I was supposed to do here.  
  
  And then I heard from her in a small voice, “I’m sorry, Alex. I wasn’t thinking about you.”  
  
  I took a deep breath. My stomach settled again and I shrugged. “It’s okay.”  
  
  “It’s not. I was a being a selfish bitch. I forgot…”  
  
  My heart pounded. What was she going to say?  
  
  “Never mind. Do you want something to drink?”  
  
  I let out a deep breath of relief. She hadn’t said it. And, like Angie, she left before I could reply. They both knew me so well.  
  
  Justin took Angie back to his truck and they climbed inside. Her arms flew around. Her face kept switching from outrage to fury and Justin kept patting her back. I stood there. I still had no idea what to do. They would reconcile in the morning. It was what they did. They would get heated, both of them were so honest and open. At times, the words weren’t received well, but they always made up in the morning. When I saw Marissa with some of her cheerleading friends, I knew it would be sooner than that. She was biting her lip as she cast concerned looks towards Angie. She sent a few towards me, but her eyes fluttered and she looked away.  
  
  I made the decision to leave. This party wasn’t for me, not that night, not with him there.  
  
  A few girls  
called out goodbyes when they saw that I was leaving, but no one stopped me. No one dared because the truth was that I wasn’t close to any of them anymore. I had been. A year ago I was one of the popular girls. It was why I had become friends with Angie and Marissa. No one could rival us when we were together.  
  
  My phone buzzed as I neared where I had parked my car. I pulled my phone out and saw the text from Marissa. I’m sorry. I really am. Please don’t be mad at me. I’m really really really sorry if I hurt you. I’m so stupid sometimes. Ok. All the time. This time. I was stupid this time. Ill make it r8t wth Angie too. Promise. Breakfast in the am? Barnies?  
  
  I thumbed a response back. Sounds good. Call when u wake up.  
  
  A second later. R U mad? R U hurt?  
  
  I heaved another breath. Was I mad? No. That was Marissa, she didn’t think sometimes. Was I hurt? On this night, I couldn’t breathe without hurting. I should’ve replied, told a lie to my friend, but I didn’t. I pocketed my phone and kept my head down as I got to the car.  
  
  Everything slowed to a halt after that.  
  
  Nothing happened. No one made a sound. No one moved. There were no animals in the background, no smell that warned me, but tingles raced down my spine and I knew.  
  
  I looked up, swallowing over a knot.  
  
  There he was, Jesse Hunt.  
  
  His dark eyes penetrated me from across the ten yards that separated us. His black hair had been buzzed since that afternoon. His lips were curved in a sneer and he was sitting on my car trunk. His knees were pulled up as his feet rested on the bumper. He had on a sleeveless black shirt that was ripped at the ends. The tattoos on his arms seemed even darker from the moonlight. They were highlighted against his skin though he was golden tan.  
  
  My voice couldn’t work. “What are you doing here?” I sounded hoarse.  
  
  My heart was pounding. I couldn’t get enough air.  
  
  His top lip curved upwards in a smile, but he still kept the sneer on his face. I never knew how he could do that, but he had perfected it from when we were in junior high. “What? You got those virginal panties on now?” His eyes flashed a warning to me. “What do you think I’m doing here?”  
  
  I swung away. Why could he affect me so much?  
  
  “Hey!” He raised his voice a notch. “It’s the big night for us, Alex. Come on. Who else would I be with tonight? Only you and me. We’re the only ones.”  
  
  I lowered my head. He was right. My heart slowed a bit. No one else could understand. No one else had loved Ethan like we had.  
  
  But that didn’t mean I wanted to think about my big brother at that moment. So I swung back and rushed out, “I saw Sarah at the bonfire. She looks pretty.” I wet my lips. When had they gone so dry? “Do you think you’ll ever get back together with her? I think she still loves you.”  
  
  He stared at me for a moment and then snorted. When he raised his hand, I saw the flask for the first time. He was drunk. Of course, he was drunk. I blinked back rapid tears. He only talked to me when he was drunk, but no—that wasn’t correct. There were lots of times when he had been drunk and he ignored my calls, my looks, or my pleas for any comfort he could’ve provided.  
  
  “Are you serious?” He rolled his eyes and for some reason, it seemed savage when it came from him. He fixed me with another penetrating stare. “Come on, Alex. What are we doing here?”  
  
  “You’re on my car.”  
  
  He snorted again and raised the flask once more. “It’s Ethan’s car.”  
  
  “He gave it to me.”  
  
  I tensed, ready for a sharp rebuke, but it never came. Silence. My eyes snapped to his and I was surprised to see that he wasn’t looking at me. He had turned away. I could see his Adam’s apple bobbing up and down. The image of it took my breath away. He was beautiful in that moment. The moon was behind him, casting its shadow over him and when he looked back, he draped both his arms on his knees. His head hung down.  
  
  His shoulders drooped as he took a breath. Hearing the shuddering inhale from him, I clasped my eyes closed.  
  
  I heard the pain in him. My own matched his and I wanted to go to him. But that was how it happened the last time. Nothing good came out of that except more suffering.  
  
  I felt my wall crumble and whispered, “I’m tired of hurting, Jesse.”  
  
  He looked back up. The cockiness was gone. The anger still burned in his eyes, but he had stuffed it down. I knew it was there, though. But it didn’t keep me away. His torment was on the surface and he let me see that.  
  
  Tears burst from my dam. I couldn’t stop them.  
  
  “It’s the exact time that it happened, you know. Right now. It’s 11:05. June 2.”  
  
  The pain suffocated me, but I couldn’t turn away. I nodded with my throat full. “I know.”  
  
  Jesse sighed again and stretched his legs down. He slid off the trunk and leaned against it. The moonlight flashed over his flask as he raised it again. As I heard it empty, he tossed it aside and crossed his arms over his chest. Even though Jesse was lean, his biceps bulged from the movement. He had always worked out, but since Ethan died he had doubled his time there.  
  
  “My god. I fucking loved that guy.”  
  
  A hand reached inside and squeezed my heart. More tears streamed from my eyes. I was helpless to stop them, but I choked out, “I know.”  
  
  “Drive me home?”  
  
  My eyes closed again and I wrapped my arms around myself. There it was. That was the request I knew was coming. My heart thundered while I tried to think clearly. And then I said, “Yes.”  
  
  The corners of his lips curved up, just slightly.  
  
  We didn’t speak after that. We didn’t need to. I went to the driver’s side. He went to the passenger side and neither of us said a word as I drove past his black Ferrari or even when we pulled up to the mansion his father had built when Jesse’s mother had been dying. As we walked through the hallways, up the stairs, and to his back bedroom my heart was calm. I was calm. And that made me not calm.  
  
  I shouldn’t have been calm.  
  
  Jesse went to his bar and poured vodka into a glass. He slid it across the counter to me. I picked it up and waited until he poured one for himself.  
  
  It was the third time we’d done this. Ethan’s funeral. Ethan’s birthday. And now the anniversary of the day Ethan’s car wrapped itself around a tree. He died a year ago and nothing was the same.  
  
  CHAPTER TWO  
  
  When I woke up, I rolled over. I wasn’t surprised to see Jesse beside me. Images of the night flashed in my head as I relived the erotic moments. There was a bittersweet taste in my mouth. I couldn’t stop myself from looking at his back. He was turned away from me with his arms bunched around the pillow under his head. He was on his stomach and I could see the sculpture he had created over the last year. He’d been ripped before, but he was defined, molded, and a piece of art now.  
  
  I sighed and wet my lips. The night had been one big blur of blind primal need. A carnal lust took over when I was near him and that was the problem. Jesse hated me. He needed me on the nights when neither of us could escape Ethan’s ghost, but the next morning would be another story.  
  
  As he stirred, I hurried out of the bed and dressed. When I couldn’t find my shirt, I spied a sweatshirt on the chair and grabbed it.  
  
  “What the fuck are you doing?”  
  
  I froze from the savagery in his voice. Then I turned around as I pulled the sweatshirt over my head and gulped. He sat on the edge of the bed with clear hate in his eyes. “What?”  
  
  The small hope I’d had for morning pleasantries, maybe more, died inside. I looked away as I felt tears coming. I shoved them down, deep down, and hardened inside as I looked back.  
  
  He still glared at me, but the loathing had been blanketed. Slightly. He gestured to the sweatshirt. “That’s mine. You can’t have it.”  
  
  “Are you serious? I don’t know where my shirt is. I need a shirt.”  
  
  He rolled his eyes and pushed up from the bed. His stomach muscles contracted from the movement and his arms bulged for a moment before it went back to his lean build.  
Then he disappeared into his closet. He came out a second later with a different sweatshirt in hand and threw it at me. “You can keep this one.”  
  
  It was white with a green four leaf clover on the front. “How generous.”  
  
  He flashed a smirk and rolled his shoulders back. “Whatever. Go in your bra for all I care.” He stuffed the other sweatshirt in a ball and tossed it across the room. When it landed on the bed, I gasped as I saw the front for the first time. I launched for it.  
  
  He caught my wrists in his.  
  
  “That’s my brother’s! I want it.”  
  
  My body was pressed against his as I strained for the shirt behind him, but he held my hands above my head and nudged me backwards with his hips.  
 “No!”  
  
  He kept going with his head down. I tensed as I felt his lips skim my shoulder and then I realized I was against a wall. Body aligned with mine, he leaned closer. His hips pressed against mine, his chest was against mine. Slowly my hands separated and he slid them down against the wall. They curved underneath me with him still holding onto them.  
  
  I breathed deeply. I was trying to calm down; my chest jerked up and down from the effort it took.  
  
  His lips softly touched my shoulder again. His hand curved over my waist, skimmed up my arm, and cupped the side of my face. He tilted my face back to meet his gaze and then sighed. His pain was evident. It shimmered on the surface, but he shook his head. He rasped out, “He died in that. I’m keeping it.”  
  
  My eyes clasped shut.  
  
  “I’m sorry. I really am.”  
  
  I felt his coldness before he stepped back. He had already retreated behind a wall. I looked up, but wasn’t surprised when there was no emotion on his face. And I swallowed over a painful knot. The moments when he allowed me in were fleeting. I wondered when he would stop altogether.  
  
  “Do you need a ride to your car?” My voice was hoarse.  
  
  “I’ll call a buddy.”  
  
  I jerked my head in a nod. We were done. Our needs had been scratched for the night. As I left, an empty feeling filled me once more. I knew it wouldn’t be filled until Ethan’s birthday, when Jesse would let me in once again.  
  
  When I walked through the mansion, everything was dark. There were paintings on the walls, all of them in dark colors. A few sculptures had been placed in corners and none of them were happy. All of them seemed sad and depressed. It wasn’t until I was almost to the front door that I realized none of the windows were open. All of the curtains were pulled shut. It was like the sunlight wasn’t allowed inside.  
  
  When I left the front door and saw my car in the open garage, I suppressed a shiver. Jesse’s home was big, cold, and empty. I now understood why he lived with us most of the time since seventh grade until last year. His mother had died when he was in eighth grade, but I never considered what his home had been like. The few times I heard him mention his father, he never referred to him as Dad, just ‘the dick.’ When I drew close to my car and opened the door, I saw the cars lined up beside it. A Lamborghini, a Porsche, another Ferrari. Jesse only drove his black Ferrari so these must’ve been his father’s. My dad drove a Sable. Something told me our fathers were very different.  
  
  And then I sighed. My phone beeped; I knew it was my alarm. I had to be at work within the hour. As I got home and rushed inside, my mom was in the kitchen. The aroma of coffee filled the air and I heard the coffee maker still brewing. Before I slipped upstairs, I peeked around the corner. My mom still had her robe on and she stood at the sink with a cup of coffee in her hand. I knew without seeing that there was a blank stare in her eyes. It had been there for a year.  
  
  As I watched, her head dropped down, her shoulders sagged, and she placed the mug to the side. A disgusted sigh came from her before she reached inside a bottom cabinet and poured something in her coffee. I knew it wasn’t creamer and I knew it was alcoholic. That empty feeling doubled inside of me. I went to my room. My arms and legs were numb now, but I tried to shower and dress in a hurry. When I went back down the stairs, my mom was still at the sink. Her mug was raised back to her lips. When I went outside and looked through the window, I knew I was right. A blank stare was on her face. I raised my hand to her, but there was no reaction. Her eyes never blinked. She never wavered in her stance.  
  
  So I left.  
  
  When I got to the food court in the mall, I slipped underneath the counter at the coffee shop. Ben pivoted at my abrupt arrival and had an eyebrow arched high before I even met his gaze. I cringed at the curiosity in them and steeled myself. “What?”  
  
  His mouth gaped open at me for a second before he snapped it shut in a dramatic fashion. Then he wiggled his eyebrows and pointed over my shoulder. “Your bff is here with all his godly basketball buddies.” Then he gestured towards the trendy clothes shop closest across from us. “And I think Casey and her winos are going to move in for the kill.”  
  
  I cringed again at the sarcastic pleasure he laced each of his words with. “Sometimes, Ben, you’re too interested in everyone else.”  
  
  He shuddered and clasped a hand to his heart. “I cannot believe you would dare say such a thing.”  
  
  I rolled my eyes and filled a coffee for myself.  
  
  He groaned as I put the lid on and sipped it. “Why you drink that without sugar or cream is beyond me. It’s foul, Alexandra. Foul, I say!”  
  
  I was about to respond when a customer approached our coffee hut and I took care of their order. A steady line formed after that. It was an hour later before I was able to drink my own coffee.  
  
  Ben reached over me for a lid as he handed the last order away, but then he checked me with his hip. “He’s still there. And he keeps looking over here.”  
  
  I knew who Ben was referring to. He was under the same assumption as Angie that Jesse and I were meant to be. We weren’t. Obviously. But I couldn’t help myself and looked over. Immediately I was caught and captivated by him. His friends were laughing around him, but Jesse stared straight at me.  
  
  I sighed and looked down. I couldn’t handle him, not now, not after last night and how he basically threw me out.  
  
  Ben gasped. His hand smacked his own chest and his stomach jiggled from the movement. He hissed, “He’s coming over here.”  
  
  And he was. Jesse stood from his table. A few of his friends glanced over, but no one stopped him. They went back to their stories or lounging in a cool way, the stance that jocks perfected long ago.  
  
  He had showered. His jeans rode low on his hips, but he had a simple black shirt on. It didn’t matter how simple his clothes were. He always looked beautiful. My stomach crumbled up and shattered into pieces as I admitted that last thought to myself, but then he was almost at the coffee hut.  
  
  “Hi, Jesse!” Casey stopped in front of him. Her hands were poised on her hips, which were prominent under skin-tight white jeans and a pink top that fit like a second skin. She flipped her platinum blonde hair over one shoulder and laughed in a flirtatious manner.  
  
  Her friends gathered behind her. All of them looked just like her, and Ben had once whispered that he thought their secret mission was to copy the leader until they took her down. When I caught a few of their hungry gazes, I wondered if it was true. If they waited in line until it was their turn to be the leader. When that happened, what guy would they go after?  
  
  Ben hissed again beside me. “Succubi. They’re all succubi.”  
  
  I nudged him as one of the girls flashed us a dark look. “If they are, you don’t want to take on a demonic beauty queen.”  
  
  He shifted to the side and lowered his voice. “That’s true, very true.”  
  
  Jesse had moved around Casey and she followed behind him. As he neared the coffee hut, she looked up. The light in her eyes dimmed and her smile slipped. “Oh. Hi, Alex.”  
  
  I gave her a polite smile, but gritted my teeth on the inside. “Hi, Casey.”  
  
  “How are Angie and Justin doing? I heard they had a fight last night.”  
  
  My eyes narrowed at her. “If they did, I’m sure they’ve made up by now. You know how those two are, always hot together.”  
  
  She snorted and flipped her hair back again. “Whatever. They’re not going to last. Justin was with me before. Everyone remembers the two of us. We were the perfect couple.”  
  
  The corner of Jesse’s lips twitched and I knew what he was thinking. My eyebrow arched. “Then why’d you throw yourself at my brother?”  
  
  Casey’s smirk vanished and her eyes grew heated. “Your brother was a good guy. And he shouldn’t have been with that ditzy airhead. I was doing him a favor when I broke them up.”  
  
  “And when you dropped Justin, your perfect boyfriend, at the same time?”  
  
  Her fury blasted me and she slapped a hand down on the counter. “Hear this, Alexandra  
Connors. I’ve always liked you and I will always have a special place in my heart for Ethan, but if you piss me off, you will have me as an enemy.”  
  
  I held my breath. I didn’t care about anything Casey threatened, but I couldn’t look away from Jesse. He had been amused at the beginning, but a wall slipped down again. The same blank mask was in place, but he reached forward and removed Casey’s hand from the counter. Then he moved to stand in front of her with his back to the coffee hut. Her eyes snapped to his, but the slight delight that sparked drained along with the blood in her face. She grew pale and backed away.  
  
  His voice was soft. “I think you should leave.”  
  
  A chill went down my spine. He was quiet, but there was a lethal undertone to his voice. Casey reacted to it. Everyone reacted to it. Ben’s eyes widened and he backed against the farthest corner we had. His hands shook, but he pressed them behind him and turned away. I caught the blush on his chubby cheeks and grinned.  
  
  Then I turned and my smile left.  
  
  Jesse placed my shirt on the counter. He lifted dead eyes to me. “I found it.”  
  
  “Thanks.”  
  
  A few of Casey’s friends arched their necks to see what he had put on the counter, so I snagged it quickly and stuffed it underneath the counter. I knew my own cheeks were red and I looked away. “Did you want something else?”  
  
  I couldn’t look. I shouldn’t have been embarrassed, but I couldn’t help it. He had returned my top in a public setting, at my job, at the mall. I groaned as I heard Ben’s sharp intake of breath, but then I noticed the lack of response from Jesse and looked back.  
  
  He was gone.  
  
  He was already at his table with his friends.  
  
  “That. Was. Awesome!” Ben breathed out and jumped to my side.  
  
  He sounded so excited, but the embarrassment was gone for me. Oh, no. Instead, I kicked myself. I should’ve known he wasn’t coming over to chat with me or see how I was. He found my shirt. Of course, that was the only reason he came over.  
  
  I felt the onslaught of a few tears. Hell no. I wasn’t going to cry over him. He didn’t deserve it and I knew that whatever twisted tradition we had on the days that celebrated Ethan’s birth and death was done.  
  
  As I watched him stand up with his friends and leave, I knew I couldn’t allow it to happen again. He didn’t give me a second look. He walked out as if we were strangers again, which we were. And I couldn’t forget it, even though I knew I was in love with Jesse Hunt. I always had been.

Chapter 6.

The alarms blared in his head, while the strobing lights assaulted his visual nodes relentlessly, demanding he regained full consciousness.

The cabin slowly came into view. The screens flickered with a myriad of readings he couldn’t process yet.

*What happened?*

He reached a gloved digit to the main screen, and tapped it once.

`Main route = off course.`

`Destinations = lost / unable to confirm.`

`Mission control = lost / unable to confirm.`

He did a double take. This was not good. This was the single worst possible outcome, the one they had warned him was possible, although unlikely.

Suddenly he realized something. He had gravity. Why did he have gravity? He shouldn’t have gravity. This was a test ride, there and back. If “back” w*as lost / unable to confirm*, why was his ship on what seemed to be solid ground? It made no sense.

He tried to relax, but the pain gripping his body had other plans for him. He oriented his visual nodes towards the ship’s small viewing port. It was dirty, and partially covered by the drag parachute, but in a corner, he could see… dirt.

Dirt. As in solid ground… Wait, the parachutes were deployed! He’d made planetfall! He was home! The sensory equipment must have malfunctioned somehow. That would explain not knowing where it was. Yes, that was it.

He gave a sigh of relieve. Everything was going to be fine. All he needed to do now was wait and rest… just for a bit.

\*\*\*

Lucia was chasing her twin brother through the meadow. The warm spring breeze tousled her long chestnut hair, making it flop about wildly. On her left, overlooking the valley, stood her main family home.

It was two stories tall and very wide, splayed over the land like a lazy fat cat. The stone structure kept watch over her family farm, like an old sentinel, build way before even her grandfather’s days. Ahead of her, she could see the massive seeders working tirelessly over the fields. The massive machines crawled slowly, planting this year’s harvest. Her uncle Luis was probably sitting somewhere nearby, controlling it remotely and drinking a cold beer.

“Marco, wait up!” She called to her brother.

“Come on! Don’t tell me you’re getting tired already.”

Even though she was used to his taunts, they still got under her skin. Her breathing grew heavier with each step, threatening to leave her breathless. Ever since he’d hit his growth spurt, playing tag with him had stopped being fun. No matter how hard she tried, she just couldn’t catch up.

“Ok, I’ll wait,” conceded Marco, feeling sorry for his sister. The girl’s face light up at the gesture, finally catching up to him and hugging him.

“I… got… you…” she managed to wheeze out.

“That you did,” he teased her back.

Suddenly, something in the sky caught their attention. A bright dot crossed the afternoon sky at incredible speeds, like some sort of shooting star, getting brighter and brighter with every second of its descent, until finally something seemed to fall off behind it. Two semi spheres, tethered to the shooting star, appeared behind it, seemingly slowing it down.

“What the…” began Lucia.

“Dad, dad! Look in the sky! What’s that?” cried Marco over his PIT.

The thing was no shooting star, but some sort of primitive space craft. Once it had slowed down enough, there was no doubt. The two previous semi spheres had vanished, replaced by a blossom of four even bigger ones. They were parachutes!

They had watched old footage of people back on Earth, jumping from great altitudes and using those things to slow themselves down. They couldn’t believe their eyes.

“Luis, get your lazy ass up! Bring the fire extinguisher!” Their father’s voice came through the PIT, over the emergency family channel.

A second after, an old hover pickup, glided down the road, appearing next to the kids. Antonio, their father, was sitting on the driver’s seat.

“Dad, what was that?” Asked Lucia excitedly.

“A spacecraft, a spacecraft!” Added Marco. “Can we come with?”

“No. Both of you, back home. Now.” His voice was stern, leaving no room for second-guessing.

Dejected, the kids had no option but to go back home… or so they wanted their father to believe. Pretending to leave, they waited for the truck to move on, and began tailing it from a safe distance.

Their uncle came out from one of the many supply sheds carrying a big, bright orange fire extinguisher and sat next to his brother, Antonio. Several other vehicles appeared from the neighboring buildings, all of them converging on the trajectory of the falling space craft.

The two kids followed as fast as they could, stopping every so often for Lucía to catch her breath, and to avoid being seen.

“What do you think it is?” she asked excitedly. “I bet it’s an escape pod. Like in those old space movies.”

“Don’t be silly. Space ships don’t use those types of escape pods. What would they need them for?”

“I don’t know,” she admitted. “Maybe it’s an older model?”

Both kids were laying on a knoll overlooking the improv fleet of vehicles converging on the ship. The space craft was slowly approaching a point in the distance close to the lake. Now that it had slowed down and was no longer on fire, its shape was visible against the blues sky. Pulling out his PIT, Marco used its magnifying feature to get a better view. It had an oval shape, like an egg, dark grey color and was covered in strange symbols.

“Let me see,” asked Lucia. Her brother took a still and showed it to her. “Wow, so weird.”

“Come on, lets skirt around the barns to get closer,” said Marco standing up.

After going around the barns housing the grain processing equipment, they came onto the corn fields. They would remain hidden from view easily if they cut through them. Lucia shielded her face from the sharp corn leaves as she ran through the field, trying to keep up with her brother. In the distance, the only thing they could see, were the top of the parachute’s canvas. Once they’d reached the other side, Marco peered out from the cornfield, staying close tto the ground, with his sister in tow. The craft was about to touch down, and vehicles began to converge on the likely landing site.

As the craft neared the ground, dust swirled in anticipation. With a heavy thud, the capsule hit the surface, bouncing slightly before settling into the ground, with its parachutes collapsed in a soft rustle on top of it.

“Ready the sensor array!” Came the voice from one of their aunts. “We need to see if there’s something alive inside!”

The two children watched in amazement as their relatives and neighbors gathered around the spacecraft, dousing it in fire retardant foam, taking all sorts of measurements with their makeshift equipment.

“Holy fuck!” Exclaimed Antonio, looking at the readings. “There’s a life signature! We’ve got a live one! Prep the medi-scan!”

\*\*\*

Nirales woke up in a daze. The throbbing in his head had partially stopped, but he could still feel it in his visual nodes. He shielded them with his arms from a bright light that barely allowed him to make out his surroundings.

He was lying on something, that much was obvious, but what? He had no clue. Tentatively, he stretched his arms and bent them to feel around him. Spreading his digit’s webbing he tapped his improv to bed, and…

*Wait, what?* He thought.

He tried to sit up, but the pain in his abdomen quickly made him give up on it. Everything ached. He compressed his nodes a couple of times until his surroundings came into focus.

He was definitely not home. He laid in what seemed to be some sort of transparent cube made out of plastic sheets, inside a wooden building. The sun light crept through the gaps between the boards, covering him in thin strips of light. He no longer was wearing his space suit, and was instead naked, covered with a blanket. An assortment of strange gelatinous patches, were spread all over the most painful areas of his body.

Of all the myriad things they told him could go wrong, getting stuck in some sort of alien backwater medical tent, was not even on the list. All their predictions and estimate of possible encounters with alien life forms, revolved around getting captured by some military vessel, or some mind melting eldritch abomination beyond oakarat comprehension, or even an encounter with some form of government representative of some sort, not… this.

He suddenly noticed there was a machine pumping something into his makeshift room. A humidifier? He took a deep breath, and realized —maybe a bit late—, that not only was the air breathable, but the water in the air had a strange taste. They were pumping something besides humidity into his tent. He didn’t think it was deadly —it made no sense for it to be—, but he failed to imagine what could it be. Maybe some stabilizing agent? More medicine?

A silhouette appeared on the other side of the tent, followed by another. They began communicating, emitting sound… only sound. He suddenly felt somewhat foolish for expecting they’d employ the exact method his species would, as if life only had one biological path it could follow. He flashed an embarrassing yellow burst of bio-light, that caught the alien’s attention. Through the plastic, he couldn’t quite make out their features, but they seem to be clad in some type of protective suits.

One of them entered his habitat, passing in between two overlaying rigid sheets of plastic, that stuck to each other when undisturbed. The alien was in deed completely clad in some form of protective gear, with a transparent square on its head. Its face was unlike nothing he’d ever seen; it was flat, with two shifting orbs in the middle —maybe a pair of visual organs—, between which descended a tube-like protuberance with two orifices, reaching to a fleshy horizontal slit. The slit parted revealing a white strip of… no, they were in fact small individual plates… teeth! That’s it! His mental faculties don’t seem to have completely returned to him.

The alien approached him holding some sort of large semi-transparent device in front of it. It waved it over his laying body, seemingly paying close attention at what the device was telling it. The alien spoke again in that weird lightless way, and the corners of its fleshy slit curled upwards, after which, it left.

Nirales was quite surprise with himself. He was taking this whole situation much better than he thought he would. Maybe he was still in shock, or maybe it was the pain, or even whatever weird treatment they had him on. Either way, for the time being, there was nothing he could do but lay, heal up and see what came next.

\*\*\*

“Mom! Can we come and see the alien?” begged Lucía for the hundredth time.

“How many times do I have to say no?” admonished María, her mother. “Give it a rest, would you!”

“But mom, I’ll be careful!”

“Girl, I know for a fact you won’t, stop pestering me or so God help me I’ll spank you blue and black.”

María had removed the head cover of her hazmat suit —still wearing the rest— when Lucia’s relentless onslaught resumed. The girl’s curiosity had remained unabated throughout the night, overpowering her common sense, pestering her mother incessantly, both during the night and the following day, undeterred by the very real threat of a motherly-slipper-based punishment that her annoyance might provoke.

She needed to see the alien, pathologically so. She’d heard from others that it was of a completely unknown species, and a Deathworlder at that, seeing as how it was pretty comfortable on their high gravity planet. This alone had whipped the young girl into a frenzy that no threat of discipline could talk down. Her brother, on the other hand, always the level headed one, was content to wait patiently until they gave him the say-so.

Once the enclosure for the alien had been built, and the atmosphere properly humidified, Maria spent the whole night trying to apply whatever medicine she could on a species utterly unknown to modern medicine, extrapolating where she could, and straight up guessing everywhere else. Suffice it to say, she did not appreciate her daughters relentless questioning one bit.

“How is it doing,” asked her husband, bringing her a cup of coffee.

“He’s actually a he,” she pointed out, taking a sip. “I just confirmed it. He’s got male gonads, no womb… you know, the basis for accurate assumptions”

“Well, until we can give him a mycobacteria injection, we’ll have no way of knowing for sure, but it’ll do for now.”

“He’s pretty banged up. Several of his internal structural bladders have ruptured during the impact, so he won’t be able to walk for a while. I’ve given him some fluid and re-gen patches, and his body is taking pretty well to them.” She paused to take another sip. “Any word from the Order?”

“We made the call as soon as he landed, so I guess they’ll send someone later today.” He gave a hardy chuckle. “Imagine they send my sister.”

“God, it’s been how long, six, seven years since we last saw her? Last time she called was a bit over a year ago. She should call more often.” Maria’s tone was unusually reproachful.

“She’s always been a bit of a scatter brain; you can’t blame her for that.”

Maria sighed. Lucia was still there, trying to find a way to get into the barn, like an army laying siege to an ancient fortress.

“Do you mind taking her away? She’s going to drive me insane.” She asked her husband, who smiled in agreement.

 “Sure thing,” and continued, picking Lucia up. “What’s gotten into you? It’s almost as if you’ve never seen an alien before.”

“I haven’t, dad! That’s the point!” She protested, holding on to him.

“What do you mean you haven’t? We meet aliens almost every week!”

“Those aren’t aliens. We know them. I’m talking real aliens, unknown things. Creatures that are truly unknown.”

“Well, you’ll meet him soon enough. Now he needs to rest. He’s probably traveled a long distance and is very tired. Moreover, he was injured sometime during the landing, so on top all that, he needs to heal. Now bee a good girl, and be patient.”

He carried her in his arms all the way to the hover-truck, buckled her in and they both drove back home.

I knew I had to stop bleeding money but didn't want to live like I was in a dungeon. So I made these 5 changes - and I still get to enjoy life (mostly):

1. **Ditching Delivery Apps.** I uninstalled DoorDash, Uber Eats, all of it. If it's not in my fridge or walkable, I'm not eating it. I saved at *least* $80/month just by doing this - and lost 5lbs.
2. **""Library before latte"" rule.** Instead of hiding in cafes to study, I made the library my second home. Free Wi-Fi, quiet, outlets, AND I bring my own $0.25 instant coffee in a thermos. The vibe isn't as romantic, but I save $40+ a month on fancy caffeine.
3. **Clothes-swapping parties.** A few friends and I started a monthly ""closet swap"". Everyone brings 5 items they don't wear anymore. I haven't bought new clothes since January and I now own the comfiest hoodie known to man.
4. **Student perks = secret gold.** Spotify + Hulu student bundle = $5/month. Apple Music free trial = 6 months. Free Microsoft Office via school email. Campus gym. So many people don't even *use* these, and they're gold when you're broke.
5. **Budget = awareness, not punishment.** I started using Notion to track literally every dollar. Once I saw how much I was spending on ""small stuff"" like vending machines and impulse snacks, I felt betrayed by myself. Just tracking helped me cut back $60/month without doing anything drastic.

You don't have to go full hermit to save money - just need small, intentional shifts. Curious: what's been your sneakiest money-saving move as a student?",1,1749494434.0,BrokeAndBrilliant,0,1.0,False

On the way, Arvyndas becomes possessed by a dark spirit, attempts to kill Kariwase, and the missing boyfriend, Dylan.","Released in June on Archive of Our Own:

[S.A.R. - Chapter 1 - BupBupSippyCup - Original Work \[Archive of Our Own\]](https://archiveofourown.org/works/66218446/chapters/170692438)

Excerpt below:

Some tense electronic music plays, looking over a vast, dense pine forest. a truck pulls shakily down a dirt road in the middle of the night, its headlights barely cutting through.

On the back reads ""Colorado Search And Rescue"". Two exhausted people sit inside the cab; one a grizzled, but kind looking Norse man, Arvyndas Grunwald (4lp), the other an angular, intrepid Iroquois woman, Kariwase (5lp). She monitors a drone tablet while he drives.

Arvyndas: How's it looking?

Kariwase: The drones aren't finding anything.

Arvyndas tries not to curse.

Arvyndas: I don't want to tell them how this looks..

Kariwase: What do you want to do?

Arvyndas: Trying this way. Feel good about it.

Arvyndas turns off the road.

Kariwase: Wait.



Arvyndas is very focused all of the sudden. He weaves the vehicle through the trees with a dangerous increase in speed.

Arvyndas: No.

Kariwase: No?

Arvyndas: Gotta go this way.

Kariwase: Arvyndas, I think i found something. a bit of her shirt.

Arvyndas: Its not her.

Kariwase: What is wrong with you? Slow down, this is outside the grid.

Arvyndas ignores.

Kariwase: Arvyndas, stop the truck.

Arvyndas ignores her still. He races all the more.

Kariwase takes action. She takes hold of the wheel, chokes Arvyndas severely for a second, then suddenly releases. Arvyndas passes out from his interruption in blood flow. Kariwase turns and brakes until the truck stops.

Kariwase retrieves an AED from the back of the truck and monitors Arvyndas's heartbeat.

Kariwase: Heartbeat is fine. Why are you acting like this?

Kariwase opens Arvyndas's eyes, looks with a flashlight, his eyes contract normally.

Kariwase shakes her head. She exits the truck, and looks around outside.

She takes a breath, and tries to get a feel of the woods. She looks up in the trees, walking just a mite from the truck.

Only the sounds of a light wind, and the rumbling of the engine are heard. The engine revs. Kariwase spins round.

The truck has taken off, being driven by a rather peaky Arvyndas. he tries to run her over in the process.

Kariwase jumps to the side. The truck hits a tree instead. from around the tree, Kariwase sees into the cab, from where Arvyndas stares at her, smiling demonically. Kariwase slowly pulls a pistol, aiming at Arvyndas.

Arvyndas looks threatened, and growls at her. She fires into the cab, but he backs up the truck, and turns around.

The shot goes through the windshield. Arvyndas speeds away, with a feverish manner.

Kariwase lowers her pistol, still very confused. She has no choice but to push on.

We see Arvyndas now, speeding madly, down deep into the forest. Kariwase doesn't see him anymore. He finds a young bear, not quite as tall as him, and he rams it full speed.

This causes Arvyndas to nearly be thrown out of the cab. The seat belt restrains him, but he rips it off with a blind fury.

He exits the cab, and plunges his knife into the bear, who is nearly unconscious.

Arvyndas tears into him several times in succession. The bear bites him in the leg. Arvyndas roars, and rams the knife into the bear's skull. It collapses.

Now, Kariwase sets up a small roost up in a tall tree. She looks through binoculars for the young couple that'd gotten lost. She puts them away, and blows a whistle. She stops, listening for a reply. She hears one.

Boy: I hear you! I hear you! Hold on!

Kariwase looks immensely surprised, and relieved.

Kariwase: Watch for the SAR truck! Something went wrong with the driver, he tried to run me down.

Boy: I'm fine! I don't see-

His voice cuts off. A scream was silenced. Kariwase's eyes widen. She clenches her jaw shut. She tries to call out, but her instincts tell her not to.

She's switched to a different mode. She lowers her face, but keeps her eyes affixed on the direction of the last voice's source, unslings a long rifle, and aims it thusly.

The sun has just begun to show itself.

She sits here for many minutes. Until another man drives up on an ATV from the road behind her. A Forest Ranger, Vince (7lp). He finds the sight of her very comical.

Vince: Find anyone up there?

Kariwase is still watching the spot ahead.

Kariwase: Hush.

Vince is quiet. She notices her looking deeper into the woods and follows suit. He gets off his ATV, takes a rifle out as well, ducking behind a tree.

Kariwase: Arvyndas went crazy. He tried to hit me with the truck..

Vince: What do you reckon, drugs?

Kariwase: couldn't have been. Hes been clean all his life.

Vince: Want to go follow him?

Kariwase lowers her rifle.

Kariwase: Yeah, okay.

Kariwase begins to climb down, when we hear a terrible roar in the distance. Vince looks off to the source, deeper still into the woods.

Vince: I’ll use the ATV. You stay and watch from there.

Vince mounts his ATV, takes a second to summon up the courage, and ignites engine. He feels like he’s marching to his death.

Vince: I can go with ya.

Kariwase: That's alright. Just... watch.

Kariwase nods, and goes back to her scope. Vince zooms down. He reaches a thick part of the wood, where the SAR truck sits, no longer running. He approaches from the front, but quickly finds a trail of blood coming from the back.

It’s leading out further downhill, toward a raging river.

A blood pack has been torn into, and dragged out of the truck. He follows the trail down the hill.

The rest of the blood pack has been left at a bend in the river. It seems the perfect trap. Vince looks all around, then proceeds to walk down to the blood pack.

Vince has an arrow shot into his leg. His knees buckle, he turns his torso and fires at where he believes the attacker to be, but there's nothing.

Vince tries to reach for his walkie, but the blood on his hand makes it difficult.

Vince: Kariwase, I'm near the river bend. someone out here with a bow... I got shot... respond.

Kariwase:(os) I'm coming. Where are they? Over.

Vince tries to abate his panic.

Vince: Hold on...

He checks compass.

Vince: North-northwest from here. Don't move too fast, they're quiet. Over.

Karewase:(os) Got you. Over and out.

After Vince releases the button, shivering violently, he examines the arrow stuck in him. It looks like its just been made. It is simply a sharp stick. He looks back to where the arrow came from. There is plenty of light now.

Vince: I should've seen them.

A helicopter can be heard from far off. Vince cranes his neck, trying to see.

Kariwase walks up with a first aid kit.

Vince: You didn't see anyone?

Kariwase: No one. Keep an eye out.

She begins to pull out the arrow. Vince hides his pain, and distracts himself by surveying the surrounding area. A serene scene, besides the blood. Kariwase comments.

Kariwase: Did you tear that blood pack?

Vince: No, it was probably your friend, from the truck.

Kariwase thinks a long while, disinfecting and wrapping the wound.

Kariwase: We have to leave him.

Vince: Really? He's- he's known you since you volunteered. We've gotta do something.

Kariwase: We can't.

Kariwase helps him up. Vince looks surprised at her.

Vince: Shit. Okay, I guess we'll... keep looking for the couple.

Kariwase: I found a ripped piece of fabric a while back. Let me go first.

Vince looks at his wound.

Kariwase and Vince retrace their steps, and enter the SAR truck. Kariwase sits in passenger seat, one hand holding a pistol, the other the drone tablet.

Kariwase: Go back up the hill, i want to watch this for a little while.

Vince drives uphill. They drive through a clearing, and the terrain flattens out a bit. They do finally come across the torn fabric. Kariwase gets out to pick it up.

Kariwase: It's the girl's. The same shirt from her picture.

Vince: Do you think she was running from something?

Kariwase: Yeah.

She hops back inside. Vince accelerates, now back on the road. He slows down, upon finding a vehicle.

Vince: Look! Look! It's their jeep!

Kariwase: Good find. Don't get out.

Kariwase digs through the jeep's glove compartment. She finds a phone. She turns it over to see a smashed screen.

She looks to the vehicles front. There is no damage. She weighs the phone in her hand, and puts it back exactly where she found it.

Vince: You don't wanna bring it in as evidence? Assuming, you know, God forbid, we can't find them?

Kariwase: No, i think whoever left it there's gonna come back. Let's watch this spot for a minute. Hey...

Vince looks at her.

Kariwase: don't give up on 'em. Thats not why we're here.

Vince: sure, I'm just saying.

Vince pulls over just a few hundred meters back. The river can still be heard from here. Along with a heavy dragging noise.

Vince and Kariwase snap to look at the river.

Kariwase is still holding a gun in the other hand. A light row of trees separates the noise's source from them.

We see what it is. Arvyndas drags a bloodless corpse down the riverbank. He watches them through the trees, moving very slowly. His vision is remarkably clear.

He seems firmly affixed on Vince. He wants him gone. He drops the body quietly, having left a new trail of blood to follow.

He prepares another arrow, and hides in the brush.

Vince spots some of the blood, farther upstream than where Arvyndas lies in wait.

He looks at Kariwase.

Vince: What do you think?

Kariwase: It's him making these trails. Arvyndas's the only one out here, besides the lost couple.

Vince: Whose... blood is that?

Kariwase: His own, maybe. I'm not sure. I'm not going near it.

She stares and expects to hear him agree.

Kariwase: You won't either, right?

Vince: No, no.

Kariwase Doesn't let up her stare

Vince: What?!

Kariwase looks to the bloody trail a while, then back to Vince.

Kariwase: Let's both go. He's the only real danger out here to the people we've been looking for.

Vince finds reason in this.

Vince: (nods) Okay.

Arvyndas rushes out of the forest and throws a long blade into Vince's upper arm. Vince shouts, and draws a pistol. Kariwase doesn't hesitate to drive away. Arvyndas fires five times, but the first two hit. Arvyndas takes two bullets in his chest, but no blood comes out. he roars, unhurt.

Vince is perplexed. He drops the clip. They have only just managed to escape.

Back in a vast house on a great plot of land owned by a family of farmers and ranchers. The ones that provide the funding for this search. A young adult with a red beard and long hair answers a phone.

S: Please tell me you found something.

Vince: (os) We did. But he went went- Arvyndas went crazy. He's trying to kill people with a bow. I'm more afraid for us right now.

We hear Kariwase's voice.

Kariwase: (os, faint) Speak for yourself.

Vince: (os) Yeah, we found his jeep. And a smashed phone. it's strange, the car isn't damaged. Kariwase thinks it was broken on purpose.

Jamee: I trust her judgement. What does she want to do about Arvyndas?

Vince: (os) I'll let you talk to her.

We hear the phone changing hands.

Kariwase: (os) Leave him.

Jamee looks surprised.

S: If you think you need to.

Kariwase: (os) Yes. See if you can get more Rangers out here. Vince has been hurt.

S: I'll do it. Watch over yourselves.

He ends the call. He exits his office, enters the dining room, and sits down to his family's full dinner table. 11 people and a puppy below. These people are always served far better than the others, and nobody really knows why.

S: They've, they've found her jeep, but they're... having trouble with a member of their team.

Pockets his phone.

S: I feel bad for them. The missing people. I know, they're not our family or anything, but I hate hearing news like that.

I: Go look for 'em, then!

K: What?

I: You're perfectly capable, you've learned a lot about outdoor survival from Dad.

S: I've never had to use any of it. I don't have real experience.

I: You have enough. If you tried as much at you do with game competitions, you'd do fucking fantastic.

D: He doesn't need to do any of that. Unless he chooses to.

S: I don't.

I: Listen, you're always talking about ""I'm a modern knight. I help people in need."" talking nice to people does not make you a knight.

S: I've never said I'm a knight. I love what they stand for, but I don't think i can live up to that.

I: I swear, you talk about it like you're Sir Roland. Like the reference?

S: Yeah, I get it.

They continue dining, S regretting bringing work to the table.



Vince and Kariwase are driving near a great lake, the water much calmer. Wildlife is all around, suggesting little danger. They reach a long natural wall of stone, leading up to a treacherous mountain. A shadow cast by the mountain above slightly obscures a grisly scene below. Kariwase sounds disgusted.

Kariwase: That's her.



Vince seems choked up. Mainly because he was hoping not to find her remains. But also, the smell.

They get out, covering their noses to take a closer look.

Vince: How do you know?

Kariwase: I heard him kill her boyfriend. He'd just heard my whistle.

Vince: Shit...

Shes been smashed all over with a rock. Some broken glasses are about the only thing recognizable on her face. Her shirt matches the torn fabric. Kariwase holds them up to compare, then she takes a picture with her phone.

She reenters the truck.

Kariwase: We'll stop and get your ATV. You should ride back and get some better help for your wound.

Vince: Are you sure? Let me watch the drone for a minute, maybe we'll find Arvyndas!

Kariwass grumbles.

Kariwase: No. Go back.

Vince is a little afraid. He wonders whether something similar is happening to her.

Vince: I'll go.

They drive back down the road in silence. Kariwase makes a sort of ""I don't want to talk"" face. Vince ignores it.

Vince: We have to do something for him.

Kariwase: Your gun didn't hurt him. What do you suggest?

Vince: Lets both meet up with the other Rangers. We have a better chance.

Kariwase: (sighs) not a terrible idea.

Kariwase seems truly shaken for the first time.

Kariwase: What happened to him?

Vince: Sounds like... his mind is broken. It might be the job.

Kariwase: He loved his job. He loved being in the woods.

More of the lake passes by them. Very calm.

Kariwase: It makes no sense for Arvyndas to go so mad out here.

They drive past a beach. Kariwase tries to contact the other Rangers now that fewer mountains block signals.

This is Kariwase. We're at the south end of the lake. Arvyndas is killing the lost people. Im sorry, Weve, found the couple's bodies. I dont know if he's responsible for both of their deaths, but im sure he killed the boyfriend. Can you send anyone out? Respond.

Static.

Kariwase: We need armed Rangers out here. Respond.

She hangs her head, feeling defeated. Vince keeps driving up the beach, thinking of something to say.

Vince:... I'm sorry.

Kariwase loosens up a bit.

Kariwase: We have to do this ourselves.

Vince nods, looking at his pistol.

Vince: We'll need a special kind of weapon. More than this.

Kariwase: I don't have anything like that. Besides my pistol, my hunting rifle's the only firearm I've got.

Vince takes a quick look in the back.

Vince: How about a flare?

Kariwase is intrigued.

Kariwase: Not a terrible idea, Vince.

She climbs into the back, holding rails for support, and fishes out the flare gun.

Kariwase: Just might work.

the next we see is the truck stopping next to the beach, Vince and Kariwase move up to a shadowed cliff dense with brush and watch the truck.

They sit, and sure enough, Arvyndas walks quietly up to the truck, holding the boyfriend's body. Kariwase does not aim the flare at him. This causes Vince to look from her to Arvyndas, expecting her to fire.

Vince: Shoot him.

She shakes her head, watching Arvyndas place the boyfriends head in the back of the truck, and place the rock that killed the woman in his left hand, and a fistful of her hair in his right. Arvyndas seems very sad. He looks at the body, feeling just terrible.

Kariwase: Look at him.

She watches as Arvyndas walks, mournful, back into the wood.

Vince isn't having any of this.

Vince: Shoot hi-i-im.

Kariwase: No. I want to see what he's left in the back.

Vince: Fuck that...

He rips the flare gun out of her hands and fires at Arvyndas. It doesnt hit him. It lands a bit behind Arvyndas and starts a fire in a small bush. He turns, and looks just below the cliff upon which they hide.

Kariwase and Vince have withdrawn further behind the hill.

Kariwase: You piece of shit. I think he saw us.

Vince: I'll fix that.

He grits his teeth, and pulls out his pistol. He fires three times, but an axe hits him in the face. Arvyndas has thrown it, killing him instantly.

Kariwase breathes quietly, preparing her own pistol. She isnt approached by him, strangely enougg. she chances a peek over her left shoulder, and sees him putting out the fire with water from the beach, using his hat. He leaves for the forest once again.

Kariwase is alone. For her, the sun is bright, but it gives no warmth. She starts to stand up again, looking over the body of Vince. She closes her eyes. A few moments. She climbs down the cliff. She reaches the back of the truck, where the boyfriend's body lies. She visually scans it, attempting to understand the rock and the hair.

Kariwase: Is Arvyndas... pinning the murder on him?

She carefully lifts up the rock, looking at the body.

Kariwase: Or was it this one?

she looks around, back to where Arvyndas has vanished. she walks in after him. She calls out, hoping to converse with whatever Arvyndas has become.

Kariwase: What did those mean? In his hands?

Arvyndas is lying on a mossy hill. He smiles at her, as one does with knowledge others don't have. He gets up slowly, and acts it out.

He imitates a car being driven, then points to the rock wall. He then points to the body in the truck, and pretends to grip a person tightly by their hair with one hand, then club them to death using the rock in the other. He looks meaningfully up at Kariwase. Then points hatefully at the body again.

Kariwase: He bludgeoned her. I get it. What a fucking maniac.

She changes the subject.

Kariwase: What happened to you?

Arvyndas tries to speak, but it pains him immensely. He gives up on that. He instead gestures with both hands to the woods all around. The wind, the bugs, the birds, all of it.

Kariwase: Nature. You've somehow become nature.

Arvyndas strides calmly around, feeling a true freedom. The framerate lowers, and it's in a slower motion, just to give us a feel of tranquility, of living on a calmer frequency, as he almost dances around, not a care in the world.

Kariwase walks with him, enjoying it nearly as much, but troubled by his stark white face. She still has a question.

Kariwase: Why did you try to kill us?

Arvyndas thinks, then spreads his arms, and shakes his head, looking concerned.

Kariwase: Not nature, but-

Arvyndas points to his shadow.

Kariwase: Darkness.

She stares at Arvyndas, wondering how much of himself remains.

Kariwwse: Is it still you, Arvyndas?

Arvyndas looks back at her, smiling kindly, and nods. Its a little hard to tell, but its a real, sincere smile.

He goes back to his idle stroll, his path never straight. His steps almost like a dance.

Kariwase: Guess theres no point bringing you back.

Arvyndas shakes his head. He wishes to stay.

Kariwase: I'm going to miss you.

Arvyndas makes a quick grunt. He picks, and eats a berry.

Kariwase: You will too, right?

Arvyndas is off in his own world. Kariwase returns to the truck, and closes up the rear doors. She drives away from this bizarre situation. She makes it back by evening. Back to her house. She hangs up her jacket and falls on the couch. She turns on her phone, and tries to forget the three dead, one gone seemingly mad, all in one day. She dials S.

Kariwase: Hello, S. I found em. She was killed by her boyfriend. You want to tell the police? I need to sleep.

S:Theyre probably gonna want to hear it from you.

Kariwase: God... Alright, tomorrow morning. Ill tell them the whole thing.

S: Thanks a million, Kariwase. Are you okay?

She looks out the widow. The sun is setting over this little city...

Kariwase: I lived. That feels good, at least.

S: There you go. Youre tough as c-

The pjone call is interrupted. The boyfriend, Dylan, is infected by the forest's ""darkness"". a very wicked being, based on our experience. Hes crawled in through the window, and snuck up behind the couch. Kariwase lowers the phone in mid-conversation, feeling something's amiss.

Dylan almost grabs Kariwase around the neck. She jabs a knife into his forearm, causing his hand to be stuck to the couch's back. Kariwase jumps out of the couch, seeing Dylan reach and thrash at her.

She looks around for another weapon. she calmly opens a utensil drawer, and picks up a corkscrew. From outside, a Jogger spots her moving toward a nearly rabid Dylan, through her kitchen window. He slowly moves to the house, watching the window.

Kariwase thrusts the corkscrew at Dylan, who in one motion grabs the knife suddenly out of his forearm, and slashes Kariwase's leg.

Kariwass steps back, wincing facially, then throws her coat at Dylan. he throws the coat off quickly, but Kariwase has already rushed into him. She uses both her hands on Dylan's knife hand, and rams him into the floor, landing on the back of his head. He seems only slihhtly dazed, but thats enough for kariwase to force his knife hand upward, into his heart. He goes still. The lack of blood makes him simply appear ill.

That nosy jogger looks, terrified, through the window.

The Jogger quiets. He moves away from the window.

Kariwase: Wait a minute.

The jogger flees down the street, trying to find a Police Officer to report what hes just seen Kariwase do.

Kariwase runs out the door, down the street after him. He panics. She raises a knife, about to throw it. No one else seems to notice this.

Jogger: Help! Help!

Kariwase stops chasing him.

Kariwase: He was possessed. Tell them that.

The Jogger doesn't acknowledge.

Kariwase: Tell them that!

The Jogger turns a corner around the block, heading for the police station.

We see a short montage. Kariwase is arrested. Her mugshot is taken. She's being led to a prison cell. She's not resisting, but she scans the crowd around her. The face of Dylan appears; the one who seemed unable to die. It's a wonder the crowd doesn't notice him--such a freakish sight. She double-takes, back to where she saw Dylan's face, but it's gone. She walks on, to her cell.

One night, she is visited. The door opens without any key being turned. She moves away from the door.

Kariwase: I don't need anything.

Kariwase breathes a bit heavier. Dylan's form walks eerily and shakily into the cell. Kariwase growls at him.

Kariwase: I don't know what you are, but I didn't do anything to you. I was out there to save that couple.

Dylan looks to a wall. He speaks sloppily, like one who hasn't quite mastered speaking yet.

Dylan: You didn't save them.

Kariwase: No, I didn't. Because of you, right?

Dylan picks at the wall idly.

Dylan: Yes, because of me. I didn't like them much. Especially this one.

Kariwase: Explain yourself.

Dylan: Uh, how do I say this? I do... what gives me pleasure. What's the point of doing anything else?

Kariwase: I do too, but there's a line.

Dylan looks her madly in the eye.

Dylan: Ohh, no there isn't. You've been grievously misinformed.

Kariwase: Who are you to give such advice?

Dylan: More than you...

Kariwase steps further away from him.

Kariwase: Why haven't you tried to kill me, again?

Dylan: You could be a greater instrument than this one. I think you'd like it.

Kariwase doesn't answer. Dylan nods toward the door, and slinks out.

Kariwase follows after.

He leads her down through the prison, and as she follows, she notices several teams of guards dead on the ground, all killed with a blade.

Kariwase: You could've just posessed one of them. You didn't really have to kill anyone.

Dylan stops. He turns around.

Dylan: You've killed. Innocents, too. Don't lie.

Kariwase is stunned. The spirit possessing Dylan clearly knows some things that ordinary people don't.

Dylan: I want you to see this, here...

Dylan exits the prison, through an open gate meant for the bus to come through, also littered with bodies.

Kariwase: You're bloodthirsty... what about it?

Dylan: I've seen it in you, Kariwase. You are in no position to judge.

Kariwase: I hope you understand... I'm not going to be your ""vessel"", or whatever you called it.

Dylan: That's alright. I'll find a way. In the meantime, all I want you to do is go back to your work. Best for you, and me. You won't have any more trouble with the law. I can make sure of that.

He walks her out to a car. The door opens for her, despite no buttons or keypads being pressed. She stands and watches him for a second, who grins foully back at her. She feels she has no choice but to enter the car. It speeds away without her command, and races down the highway, back to her house.

She hastily exits the vehicle, which immediately drives itself away.

She walks down the sidewalk, and gets noticed by the jogger.

Jogger: Hey, you were sent to prison! What are you doing-

His neck is snapped by an invisible force...

Faintly, Kariwase hears some low laughing. The Jogger's body quickly rots, and fades into the ground. Kariwase stares at the ground in horror, then continues on her path.

She heads inside. Nothing seems warm, or bright in here, unlike last time. She can't seem to relax. She enters the next room to see-

Avyndas, filthy with general forest debris, and looking somehow even more feral than usual, sits on the couch, his senses regained.

Kariwase: Arvyn!

Arvyndas's eyes light up to see her, to see clearly again. But he doesn't speak. Some attempts are made, but it sounds like he's trying to clear his throat, and can barely manage the effort.

He scrapes his face with his fingers, desperately wanting to communicate in a better way...

He stands up. He points to the hallway.

Kariwase: Yeah, that's where he was. The ""dark spirit"", right?

Arvyndas nods slowly, his eyes full of fear. It affects Kariwase.

She looks to the hallway.

K: He's not here. We've struck some sort of deal. I don't really get it, but I don't think he'll be bothering us.

Arvyndas relaxes, starting to breathe more slowly now.

The room gets a little brighter. Seemingly just as Kariwase joins him on the couch, relaxing as well.

K: He says i should ""go back to work."" That's all I can do. Do you want to go with me?

Arvyndas nods happily. Kariwase looks at him, blinking.

K: What are you doing here?

Arvyndas pats the couch.

K: Yes, it's very nice.

Kariwase leans back, and falls asleep, within seconds.

\_\_

The next morning, Kariwase awakes sprawled awkwardly across the couch. She looks, bleary-eyed, around the cluttered room, for Arvynas.

K: Arvyn? Where'd you go?

She's a little bothered that he didn't stay the night after such a disturbing few days.

K: The real Arvyn would've stayed the night.

She looks, a bit too long, at the dirt-stained spot on the couch where Arvyndas was sitting. She gets up, and puts on a pot of cowboy coffee. She turns on the TV as she passes it to get a mug from the cupboard. The news is on, two Anchors chattering madly about the latest development.

Anchor: - by Esports professional Sam Killian, which resulted in a literal walkout for the remainder of the game tournament, all chanting, ""Vivi must be nerfed!"".

Kariwase changes the channel to another news station with her remote.

Anchor 2: The Colorado wilderness claims another. 25-year-old Courtney Hayle of Nebraska was found, brutally murdered by an unknown assailant. However, this morning, a forensics crew identified one woman, supposedly one of the search and rescue volunteers, Kari-

Anchor 2 gasps, and chokes, their face horrified. They fall to their knees, and start to retch all over the glossy white floor. ANCHOR 3 stands up, and runs toward the film crew, but they don't reach. Their legs are cut from under them, by an invisible blade, and they fall to the ground.

By now, there are various shouts of fear and distress from the camera crew, but the signal abruptly cuts off before we can see or hear any more.

Thoroughly disturbed, watching a blank screen over her coffee, she flips the channel to a kids show. Something like SpongeBob Squarepants. She doesn't feel like anything else, just yet. Hopefully, the ""Pickles"" episode, where SpongeBob yells,

SpongeBob (TV): I. can't. do it! I can't do it, Mr. Krabs!

Kariwase looks, down, deep in thought, feeling the same way.

A silence lasts a while longer, until it's interrupted by:

Voice: Time to go to work, Kari.

Kariwase doesn't react right away. She doesn't want to be thought of as a test subject. She slowly tears her gaze away from the floor, and grabs her keys.

Careful listeners will actually hear that this was Arvyndas. The other one wouldn't call her 'Kari'.

\_\_

Back out in a clearing, in the bright wilderness, Kariwase leans up against the SAR truck.

Kariwase calls out to the quiet woods.

Kariwase: I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing.

There is a dramatic, downward musical note, as a dark vignette effect pulses, Kariwase almost falling asleep on the spot.

She forces herself awake, holding on tightly to the door of the truck, as if for a raft at sea.



Kariwase isn't willing to take this, anymore. She hops in the truck, and starts the engine, but her attention is caught by a rock that suddenly hits the right side of the truck. She cranes her neck to look out the right window, and sees Arvyndas speeding toward her, waving one arm, face stricken with horror.

She reaches for her pistol, but recognizes him, looking relieved, within seconds.

Kariwase: Arvyndas!

She stops the engine, and leans her arm out of the window, smiling casually. For a few moments, at least. She sees the look on his face, and his sense of urgency becomes apparent.

She turns the keys, as Arvyndas climbs inside the cab. She drives off, heading down the road, towards the lake.

The engine roars to life, when we see Dylan. In the back. Watching them, amused, like... well, test subjects.

\_\_

When Kariwase feels the moment has calmed, she tries at another partial conversation.

Kariwase: What are you so freaked out about?

Arvyndas pretends to stab a corkscrew into his neck. She smiles a little, proudly.

Kariwase: Yeah, I did pretty well there, I think.

Her face lowers.

Kariwase: Didn't kill him.

Arvyndas can't stand to see her like this. He gently lifts her head back up by her chin. She smiles kindly at him.

Kariwase: What do you think we should try?

Arvyndas thinks, a long while, then smiles confidently. He opens a small satchel on Kariwase's belt and takes out a silver, bullet-shaped lighter. He twirls it in front of her, and she tries to pay as much attention to it as the road will allow, sporadically looking at it.

Kariwase: God, that's pretty much what Vince said to do.

Arvyndas smiles more, and nods, excited.

Kariwase: I hate to do it, but that thing is evil. It has to be put down.

Arvyndas's smiles turns into a wide snarl. He relishes the thought.

Kariwase chances a look at Arvyndas. A look os great uncertainty. She wonders how much of Arvyndas is left.

Kariwase: I don't like you like this.

Arvyndas doesn't do anything. He just stares forward, holding his breath.

Kariwase: It doesn't feel natural. Something must've went wrong if Nature needs to take human form.

Arvyndas lowers his head, and looks at her, nodding, eyebrows raised.

Kariwase: Couldn't have gotten anyone else? What's so important about me, Arvyn?

He hugs her. She smiles, and hugs him back with one hand.

Kariwase: Thanks but... that doesn't really answer my question.

Arvyndas places his hand over his heart.

Kariwase: We're just good friends? Is that really the only reason?

Arvyndas nods, slowly and sincerely.

Kariwase: That's fine with me, I guess.

She accelerates, turning a rather sharp corner, which dislodges the hidden passenger in the back.

Dylan is flung up against the inside of the ambulance.

Kariwase and Arvyndas both look behind.

Dylan hisses at them nastily. Sunken, black eyes stare back at them, until Arvyndas steps into the back, and smacks him across the face with a wrench.

Dylan scrambles to a crouching position, smirks creepily, and simply opens his hand, whose fingernails suddenly appear clawlike, his fingers three-pronged.

He starts with Arvyndas. Dylan points his opened, clawed hand at him, and begins to drain the soul from his body. One of them, anyway. We see a brief, visual effect, somewhat like a white flash, coming from Arvyndas. He blinks, suddenly aware.

Arvyndas: Kariwase! Burn him! You have to burn him! It's the only thing tha-

He is cut off. Dylan had lunged at him, knocking him into the seat, and now tries to scratch mercilessly at him. Arvyndas is able to restrain Dylan's arms from doing too much.

Kariwase stops the car, but doesn't use the parking brake. No time. She rushes into the back to help Arvyndas fight off Dylan. Arvyndas summons more strength, and forces Dylan off, pushing him into a ready Kariwase, who stands holding a long survival blade.

Dylan is impaled on it, much of Kariwase's arm sticking out of the hole. He looks, frozen in fear, at his wound.

In a few moments, they start to droop, looking very tired, indeed. His head bobs around. It almost looks like he's headbanging to a very inconsistent beat.

He growls suddenly, and savagely.

Dylan: There are three more like me. I want you to find them. If for nothing else, to witness greatness. See what we're truly supposed to be.

Kariwase rips the blade out of him, roaring mightily. She stabs him in the head. His body flops to the floor.

She stands there, panting, heart still racing from such an encounter. Arvyndas looks from the body, to her, gets up, and watches the body with one arm around her.

I run a small real estate company outside the city and we’ve mostly avoided flipping homes in St. Louis City/County because of everything we’ve heard about the permit process—delays, red tape, etc.



That said, I’m starting to think we might be missing out on good opportunities by avoiding it entirely. I’d love to hear from people who’ve actually done remodel work in the city or county (especially flips or major renos). How bad is it really? Are there ways to work around it if you know the system?



Just to clarify, I’m not part of some big “We Buy Ugly Houses” outfit or trying to mass-buy anything. I run a small team, we actually do the work ourselves, and I’m just trying to learn more before expanding into city projects.

1l7chyz,https://www.reddit.com/r/strange/comments/1l7chyz/dreamed_about_a_café_opening_in_my_university/,Dreamed about a café opening in my university courtyard — it opened exactly a week later,"This happened during my first year of university, in the summer — about a week before the resit exam period. I had quite a few exams to catch up on, so I was obviously stressed and mentally drained at the time.

One night, I had this vivid dream: I was sitting in the courtyard of my university, at a table outside a specific café brand that I knew well (I won’t mention the name to avoid promoting it). In the dream, I was drinking coffee, studying, preparing for one of my upcoming exams. At some point, I felt extremely unwell and passed out right there at the table.

It felt so real that I remembered it perfectly after waking up — the colors, the mood, even the layout. The weirdest part is that the café didn’t exist there. The courtyard was just… the usual space, no café at all. I hadn’t been to the university in about 2–3 months since it was summer break, so I hadn’t seen any kind of renovation or construction going on.

Fast forward a few days later — I return to campus to start studying for my resits, and boom: the exact same café (same brand, same vibe) had just opened right there in the courtyard. The placement, the branding, everything matched. In real life, it was a bit smaller than in the dream (only three small tables outside instead of many), but the fact that it was that exact company, in that exact spot, and opened just days after the dream — that really freaked me out.

No one I knew had any idea it was going to open there. There were no signs, no announcements, no hints. And while it’s true I had gone to that café chain with my friends after classes in the past, it never once crossed my mind that they’d open a location inside the university courtyard.

I don’t think it was déjà vu — it felt more like the dream predicted something real that I had absolutely no way of knowing at the time.

Still messes with my head to this day.

Has this happened to anyone else who exercises a lot? For context, I have biked 100+ miles per week for the last 3 weeks, and exercise with weights on top of that. My cardio fitness has not changed. 

The only other variables I can think of is diet. I stopped drinking coffee (matcha only now) about a month ago. I also started “fueling” more during bike rides, so more energy bars and hydration tablets. I’m realizing those could be the reason for the increase in PWV, since both have a lot of sugar.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

Do you ever think about what the versions of you in other universes might be doing? I do. When I woke up after experimenting with drugs to my roommate shaking me and crying, “Don’t die,” repeatedly, I thought about a universe in which I didn’t. When the car on the way to my honeymoon lost control, hit the up-mountain side of the road, and flipped over, I crawled out of the window, thinking about a universe in which we hit the down-mountain side. When I stayed at a remote cabin in the woods to go skiing with an online friend, and we had a great time, I thought about a universe in which I’d experienced a much darker ski trip.

I rarely think about the other universes, though. The universes in which Judah didn’t kill himself. The universes in which my marriage didn’t fail. The universes in which I was born with a brain that made and processed all its neurotransmitters properly and in the correct amounts. 

In real life, I like to hear about other people’s good fortune when I’m at my lowest. It makes me feel good to know that, even if my own life is worthless, others have found meaning and happiness. 

To think about other versions of myself experiencing the same, though, is just depressing to me. I prefer to focus on the fact that this universe is one in which I’ve managed to get this far rather than focus on the fact that it’s one in which ‘getting this far’ is something that must be managed rather than a natural result of existing.

I thought about this when I woke up because it was a nicer thought than the pounding hangover attempting to send me back to oblivion, and because it’s what Corey and I spoke about on the Uber back from the bar to his apartment for a one-night stand.

He’d walked into the bar after I’d already been there, reading my book and sipping my way through their menu of martinis for more than an hour. Like me, he had very long, graying brown hair tied back into a braid, brown eyes, and casual clothes. We could probably pass for twins. I noticed him less for this, though, and more because he said his name to the bartender. It was mine. Or, my nickname anyway. In another universe, I was born the boy my parents thought I would be, and my name was Corey rather than the hastily-scrambled-for Corinne.

The bar wasn’t too busy, but enough that the seat next to me was one of the only ones available at the counter. He sat next to me, glanced at my book, and said, “Oh, I’ve read that. How’re you liking it?”

I looked at him skeptically. I’m well aware how niche my interests are and the likelihood that a random stranger would have even heard of the book, let alone have read it. “It’s okay,” I said with a small shrug. “The plot’s not bad.”

He snorted. “Sure, but the author’s insistence on repeatedly bringing up the main character’s age is uncomfortable at best.” 

I’d stared at him in shock. He really had read it. (And, thankfully, had the same opinion of the age thing.) Suddenly, I was far more interested in the conversation. Enough that I was still talking to him two hours later, drunk and buzzing pleasantly as the world spun around me. He invited me back to his apartment, and I agreed without a second thought. That was not, I’m afraid, because I was drunk or because I greatly trusted that he wasn’t a serial killer. It’s just that I have nothing I’m living for, so it didn’t matter to me one way or another. 

I couldn’t have picked better, though, as far as the sex went. I’ve never been a fan of sex. It’s not bad, I suppose, but… well… It’s messy and sweaty, and watching paint dry would be more stimulating (and probably also a great deal less stressful). But with Corey, it was like he was in my head, reading every thought, every fantasy I’d ever had, and tailoring the experience to me. Not just technique, although that seemed good too, but kinks. Even though he’d been generically nice when we were talking, when it came to the bedroom, he spoke with a perfect blend of praise and degradation. If sex were usually even *half* as good, I’d be more willing to take part. 

It made me wonder about the common perception that a considerate partner should try to ensure their partner enjoys themself. I’d assumed, given how miserable the entire experience was, that it was a misunderstanding. After all, I’d always thought that people who cared if I orgasmed were the worst because it just meant extending the experience and making it a million times more stressful, but… Maybe that wasn’t the norm. 

My stomach rumbled, my intestines warning me that they were unhappy with me. They never were, but drinking certainly didn’t help. Neither did coffee, so I naturally only managed to drag myself out of bed because I caught a whiff of it. 

I looked around the room blearily. I vaguely remembered Corey’s alarm going off at some ungodly hour. He’d told me he had to go to work, but that I could sleep in, so I did. Was that okay? Now that I was properly awake, I worried that it’d been one of those things you say to be polite but don’t mean. Maybe I was supposed to turn him down and make my way back home at that point. 

Well, it didn’t matter, since that wasn’t what I’d done. I wasn’t likely to see him again anyway. I remember thinking. 

He had random empty shelves along the walls, and it took me a moment to realize I was looking at shelves designed for cats. My heart warmed. It was good to see someone who took proper care of their cats. Not that I always managed, so I couldn’t talk, but still. Good. 

I stumbled into the bathroom and stopped, surprised. Atop a neatly folded towel and washcloth sat an unopened toothbrush and sample sizes of toothpaste, face wash, and deodorant (all, coincidentally, the brands I used). On the closed toilet seat were my similarly neatly-folded clothes, and when I picked them up to get dressed, they smelled clean instead of like the smoke that’d filled the bar. Honestly, it felt like a bit much, but it was also really nice. Maybe I'd hit the jackpot with this guy, a nice little bit of karma to start the weekend with. Or maybe one-night stand etiquette was just better than I’d expected.

I brushed my teeth and examined myself in the mirror. I didn't look too obviously hungover, even if my insides still felt queasy. Getting dressed slowly, trying not to think about the way my head pounded, I heard a clatter on the floor. I blinked, frowned, and fetched a bottle out from where it had rolled behind the toilet. Oh. He'd even included a bottle of Ibuprofen. Jeezus. This guy was too good. 

Or maybe my standards were just too low? Who knew. I'd thought my ex was nice, only for literal strangers to tell me after the divorce lines like ‘good on you getting out’ as though I’d initiated the proceedings rather than having them plopped in my lap one morning. Maybe I was the weird one, and women everywhere expected this type of service as a matter of course.

I shuffled into the kitchen, not quite expecting anything, but by now kind of half-hoping to find another considerate surprise (no matter that I told myself not to get greedy). At the very least, it'd be nice if the faintly lingering aroma of coffee resulted in a Mr. Coffee with half a pot left in it.  

I got better.

A mug of coffee with a small cup of milk sat on a tiny warmer. Beside it was a bottle of one of my favorite flavors of creamer in a bucket of ice. I didn’t always use creamer, and with the way my stomach felt this morning, I decided it’d be a poor idea, but it was nice that he’d offered. Wanting to repay even a hint of Corey’s consideration, I put the creamer into the fridge, taking the opportunity to snoop inside. There wasn’t much. It looked the way my fridge typically looked when I’d recently moved and hadn’t gotten around to collecting condiments and sauces and fermenting leftovers. I set the creamer in the door. The only things accompanying it were chicken and a handful of herbs and veggies. I poked into the cupboards and laughed. It looked like he liked Indian food too and had purchased just enough to make one or two meals. I closed the cupboards and returned to the coffee. 

As I picked up the mug, I smiled at the note that rested next to it, complete with small stick-figure artistry that waved up at me and a phone number.

*I had a great time last night. I hope you don't feel too sick this morning after how much you drank. Feel free to take your time going home, and use whatever you need.*   
*<3 Corey*

Well.

I realized that I was smiling somewhat giddily, but who could blame me? What insanely nice guy was this? I’d rate him at maybe a seven or eight out of ten on the conventional attractiveness scale, so it wasn’t like he was so unfortunate he’d have needed to develop exceptional aftercare to keep a girl. (For the record, I can pull a decent seven out of ten too, if I try hard, but I don’t. In other words, he was reaching down with me and had even less reason to put forth so much effort.) 

Quite frankly, I was starting to feel that this guy was too good to be true. Was he a drug dealer? Was he a serial killer who'd had a change of heart for some reason? Was he secretly into kids and just using drunk girls at bars as a cover? 

I set down the mug and then paused, frowning slightly. Small world indeed. I had this same quirky coffee mug at home. My mom'd gotten it for me from who-knew-where. If he shopped on the same websites as her, maybe there was something wrong with him after all, I thought with satisfaction at finally discovering a flaw, no matter how minor.

I picked up the mug again and wandered into the living room. It was strange. This apartment was my dream home. I'd always hated the idea of living in a big house, one of the reasons my marriage had failed. As much as being a housewife had appealed to me, it was hard to enjoy housewife-ing in a house I didn't like. This apartment, large but ultimately still an apartment, nice but unassuming, was my ideal. The colors were the same I'd have chosen if I'd been designing my own home. Every room I’d been in so far had a cat tower that led to shelves winding throughout the room. The walls were decorated with soothing abstracts that nicely suited my unused degree in East Asian Languages and Cultures. It was perfect.

A small sliver of unease curled through my stomach. I was one of those pessimistic paranoids who couldn't feel comfortable when things were too good.

I sat on the couch (firm, the way I like furniture) and turned on the TV, idly noting that he had many of the same games as me, along with several that I'd wanted to try. The TV turned on to Netflix, and anime, The Great British Baking Show, and Nailed It! were all among the suggestions. Our conversation the night before came back to me. Maybe I had slept with a parallel universe male version of me. I felt distinctly awkward now. The coffee began to taste sour in my mouth. I set the mug down on a coaster and frowned at the screen before turning it off again. I stood and walked to the cabinets under the TV.

Light novels, fantasy, horror, How to Draw... Every topic I normally bought was present and accounted for there. I turned to the bookcases on the walls, and found true crime sprinkled amidst references, chemistry, and engineering. That's right. He'd mentioned doing something in one of those fields, hadn't he? I couldn't remember exactly which, but at the very least, I had no interest in engineering. The unease settled ever so slightly.

Still though... I wandered around the house, and the absolute perfection of it made me bite my lip and wonder whether I should consider this a good thing or not. It was also clean. I mean, yes, that’s fine, but it was weird. The kitchen sink shone, no hard-water marks lined the shower walls, the grout between tiles was perfectly white, and the closets were mostly empty.

It was like someone had come and started living in a model house. 

A thought struck me. This entire time, I hadn’t seen hide nor hair of the cat that must live here. That it could be hiding was perfectly reasonable, but the utter lack of fur lining the surfaces? That was stranger. No amount of obsessive cleaning could get rid of that entirely.

Then I reached the sole room with a closed door.

Ideally, I thought, a guest should not enter closed doors. Certainly, that held for a guest who was, after all, nothing more than a one-night stand.

I opened it anyway and froze.

A lab. And not just a lab, but one that studied, as far as I could tell from a glance, me. The walls were covered in hundreds - thousands? - of pictures of me, all identical in size and all spaced perfectly evenly to form a white lattice-work of negative space framing them. I took a step in, feeling faint, and turned to look at the pictures closest to the door. On one side were pictures of a child me. On the other side were pictures of me as I was now, including several from the night before. There was no rhyme or reason to the subject matter other than that they all contained me. 

Some were of me eating, lovely candid photos that gave me a third chin, and others were pornographic images of me having sex with my partner’s form blurred to leave me the sole focus of the photo. There were close-ups of what I could only assume were my body parts, given the context, and far-away shots of crowds of blurry figures in which I alone stood out. Some were flattering. Most were not. There was my sixth-grade Halloween costume, which I’d mourned not having taken a picture of, and there was my seventh-grade ‘costume,’ which never needed to see the light of day.

Counters lined the walls, and personal effects dotted them. Some I recognized, while others were unfamiliar. I saw my neon green spandex shorts from elementary school and my first handmade cosplay, but also random pairs of jeans and underwear whose origin I could only guess at (though I don’t think it’d be strange to guess that they’d been mine at some point as well). 

It wasn’t only clothes, though. I picked up one of the stuffed animals. It was Pinky, my old stuffed bear. I’d thrown him out after the cat threw up on him, but here he was, pristine once more.

And here was Blankey, the ratty yellow blanket from my childhood that I'd played long, nonsensical imagination games with. And there was Emily, a pink, stuffed cat with a bell in her tail and an ugly, squished face.

What. The. Hell.

As if that wasn’t weird enough, there were rows of lab tables with drawers underneath and cabinets on top, and all were filled with labeled containers. I examined them with a faint sense of horror. Hair was present in disquieting quantities offset only by the even greater disturbance of finding a small collection of *eyelashes.* Then there were cases of slides, like you might find in a chemistry lab, labeled things like 'saliva' and 'urine' and 'arousal fluid,’ each additionally containing the time and location of collection. There were probably thousands of slides, so feel free to assume how far back these collections went.

I explored further, filled with sick fascination now, moving on from the question of why and on to *how.* He hadn’t looked any older than me. Was this a multi-generational obsession? I shuddered at the thought. And what kind of spy gadgets did you need to get some of these pictures? It seemed incredible that I had never once even suspected that someone was observing me, given how thorough that observation seemed to have been.

“Sometimes, data collection for official replacement procedures infects us with a kind of obsession.” I spun around. There stood Corey, leaning against the wall, smiling softly. He didn't look like someone who'd just been caught out as a total psychopath. “It’s a known, quantifiable risk. Standard procedure indicates that one so infected should report it immediately and be reassigned. Recovery takes several months, but all costs are covered by the government. I have no excuse for my failure to report this infection.” 

What did that even mean? I swallowed hard. ""H-how?"" I asked, gesturing vaguely.

“The usual methods.”

The answer meant nothing to me. What *did* mean something was his position right next to the room’s only exit. With no means of escape, I turned away from him, dazed, and continued my perusal of his collection. I found a binder full of Pokémon cards. I flipped through the pages absently as I tried to *think.* ""You stole these from my backpack in the YMCA.""

*Now* he blushed, rubbing the back of his neck awkwardly. ""Yeah, sorry. The early phases of infection include a marked loss of control and improper collection procedures. Don’t worry. I’ve long since passed that stage.""

I found a carefully reconstructed Horsea card. It looked like it’d been torn apart, crumpled, and soaked in water. “This is…” There was no way. 

“That may have been the start,” he said casually. “When that boy chewed up and spat out your card, I remember thinking your tears were lovely, which was a distinctly abnormal observation. I retrieved it and attempted to manually restore it, which was also abnormal. Ordinarily, ruined items are regenerated if we deem them important enough to retain.”

I remembered the incident. Bullying me had been a sort of fad for a while in elementary school, with a few of the boys going to ever greater lengths to show off how hard they could make me cry. I’d admittedly probably been annoying with my over-the-top love of Pokémon. Having my favorite card destroyed in such a disgusting way, shortly followed by my cards all disappearing from my backpack, had cured me of that love. I shook my head and closed the binder.

“Who are you?” I asked. 

“Your replacement,” he said. It still made no sense. How could this man possibly replace me? Sure, we had the same height, build, and coloring, but I was very much a woman, while he looked distinctly male. No one would ever confuse us with each other.

I glanced at the door. It seemed both close and also impossibly far away. ""Now what?"" I asked without much hope. I still didn't get the sense he planned on murdering me, but I doubted I had the kind of sense that would warn me of that in the first place. Not if I'd gone home with my very own stalker.

""Anything you want. You can ignore this, ignore me. But I'd like it if you'd stay."" He finally moved away from the door. He approached me carefully and caressed my cheek. ""I'll give you everything you need. Everything you want. I'll fulfill every desire you've ever had, even the ones you think you shouldn't have.""

The right answer was, of course, to get myself the hell out of there and on a beeline to the police. That would be the mentally stable, sane answer. The answer I'd give right away if I had any form of self-esteem.

But... Even if it was creepy and stalkery and interspersed with words I didn’t understand the context of, no one had ever cared about me like this before. “Can I have some time to think about it?” I asked. 

Amazingly, he agreed. He sent me home to my tiny alimony-funded apartment with his number and a deadline. I suppose, considering how skilled he is at observing me, he doesn’t need to worry that I’ll run. I don’t even know how he’s doing it, so how could I possibly escape? 

I don’t know that I believe his offer. It isn’t lost on me that the photos of me were chronological, and they ended at the door. There was very little room for more pictures, which likely meant there wouldn’t *be* more pictures. It’s hard not to make assumptions about what that means for my longevity. On the other hand, though, what would be the point of the offer if there weren’t some hope of survival?

And did I want to survive anyway? That room. That weird lab-turned-shrine… It showed everything about me, and there was nothing unique or special about the person it was dedicated to. Maybe he couldn’t replace me literally, but just about anyone could replace my role in the world for all the impact I have on it.

So here I am. He gave me a week to think, and I’ve spent the last few nights tossing and turning, debating the answer to this question. Do I ignore him and find out what results, or do I accept him? 

...

I think… I want to accept.

And maybe one day, I’ll spend time thinking about the universes in which I made a different choice.",3,1749493696.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

These are my original words before I allowed AI to edit it. There is no AI in this post. Just me ---- My child has chosen violence and I'm blaming the coffee.  So I know that theoretically caffeine is not going to damage him. Especially now that I've entered deep into the second trimester (18 weeks 4 days) however I've just not had much of it my entire pregnancy. Not coffee. Not soda. Well I had an emergency OB's appointment this morning and wasn't supposed to wake up until 7:30. But I have anxiety so I woke up at 6:30 worrying about missing it. That was strike number one. Then I had a cup of coffee and a little bit of Dr pepper. All in all equaling about 80 mg of caffeine. 200 is safe. This was my fatal mistake. From there I went on and had my doctor recommended protein shake and went to my visit. All went well at the visit. He decided that he did not want his heartbeat heard today. He was trying to hide from her. He was being poked and didn't like it. That was a mistake number three. I also did not give him any salad this morning. Which has been my massive craving for days. I don't know what strike that was but it was one for sure. When you combine all of these facts. Giving him caffeine, waking him up early, allowing doctors to poke him, and just generally existing, he  decided he was going to be offended. And violent. I know that I'm sometimes prone to car sickness but I was feeling so good when I left the house that I didn't bring any grocery bags with me just in case. Another mistake. About 5 mi from my house my child chose to be extremely violent and projectile vomit everything. It was on my face my hands my pants the car seats. My friend was driving and started gagging. We had to pull over on the side of the road so that I could empty my entire stomach so we could make it home without any more incident. And this?

1l7ca3m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paruresis/comments/1l7ca3m/a_paruresis_story/,A Paruresis Story,"I want to start out by saying that while this story is 100% true, I'm sharing it here for entertainment purposes, if it helps someone feel seen and heard, so much the better.  And maybe a little bit for the sense of comradery it might offer to this group.  Also, I shared it in a different thread about that one Extra Fabulous comic about the dude with the shy bladder, but I realize in retrospect, that probably wasn't the appropriate place to dump this whole tale.  But then I figured, hey, this is reddit, and there must be a community around paruresis.  Lo and behold, here you are!  So I'm pasting my story here.  Also, a warning that this story contains swearing, detailed (and crude) descriptions of bodily functions, and non-sexual references to certain parts of the male anatomy.  Enjoy:

I discovered that I have a shy bladder when I joined the military, about 15 years ago.  Arguably the worst place to be when one finds out they can't pee when someone else is in the room, let alone while an angry NCO is staring impatiently at you with your dick in your hands.  This caused me a lot of grief during my time wasting taxpayers money, but by far the worst time happened the day of my C-school graduation.

So, graduation had just wrapped up, 0900 on a Friday.  As luck would have it, I was on duty that day, so I couldn't just go fuck off for the weekend.  Right after I get out of my dress uniform, one of my instructors pulls me aside and tells me that my name got pulled for a rando piss test.  All I have to do is report to the NCO in charge of security, let him watch me piss in a cup, and then I can go about the rest of my dull day on watch.  But I know that ain't gonna happen.  It is going to take minimum three hours, for me to squeeze a drip of piss out of even a full bladder.  That is just the way it is.  So, I meet up the NCO, we'll just call him Mack, tell him I am no where close to being able to piss, and then trudge off on down to the commissary to chug the largest cup of black coffee I can get my hands on.  I hammer back the coffee and head back to the front of the building to wait near Mack's office until I can maybe, possibly piss for him.  

An hour goes by, and I have to piss, but internally, I know it ain't coming out.  Still, Mack comes up and asks me if I have to go.  I shrug and tell him, ""sure, let's give it a shot"".  For some context, let me describe the space.  This is a very large building. The front of the building is a huge open space, well lit with slick marble floors and a huge marble stair case running up the center to the second floor.  The security desk where Mack is posted is at the left of the stairs, and the common bathrooms and drinking fountains are on the right.  Behind the security desk is a small bathroom, big enough for one person, that is specifically used for piss tests.   A large mirror is positioned above the toilet that an observer can use to stare right down onto the subject's dick & balls as they relieve themselves.  Mack and I walk over to the bathroom, I step inside, with him right behind me standing in the threshold of the door way.  I go through the motions of trying to piss, but I know it is a waste of time.  Another shrug and a sheepish smile ""sorry, Mack, maybe we can try again in an hour.""  Two more attempts in as many hours go past, with similarly frustrating results.  By now, it is lunch time, and Mack is visibly aggravated by my apparent lack of compliance.  ""Listen, I'm going to get lunch and then I have some shit I need to do before the end of the day"".  He continues, ""When I am done, I 'll come find you and I expect you the provide a urine sample.""  ""Of course, Mack"", I say with little confidence.  I should say that by this time, I really have to piss, like really badly.  I'm starting to dance a bit.  But every time I'd enter that bathroom, my urethra clamps shut.  All I can do it continuously sip from the drinking fountain, hoping that I can build the pressure above the point that this bullshit mental block can handle.

Another hour passes, and I am not doing well.  The urge to pee is enormous.  I can no longer stand straight.  I am in obvious distress; hunched over, covered in a flop of sweat, shaking, gasping for air in between obscene slurps from the drinking fountain.  Mack is nowhere to be seen, and I am starting to panic.  Another hour goes by.  Propping myself up against the fountain, I start to become delirious and dissociative, higher brain functions shut down one by one.  I twist and groan, stomping the ground like a frightened deer as the autonomic urge to pee overwhelms me.  Overcome, and unable to hold on anymore, I rush through the bathroom door, shambling toward the urinal, drop my pants to mid thigh, and attempt to release a thin, controlled stream.  

That is not what happens.  An aggressive jet of high pressure piss gushes from me.  Simultaneously, a violent belch of black coffee diarrhea erupts from my anus.  In the briefest second after the release, I experience a blissfully ephemeral moment of lizard brain catharsis, interrupted immediately when my higher lever reasoning barges in.  WE NEED THAT PISS!  I look down at the solid stream of pee coming from me.  STOP THAT STREAM, MACK WILL BE BACK ANY SECOND, WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?!  My left hand grips my dick, while the right hand clamps on top, spraying high pressure piss everywhere, holding on tight until I can feel the pressure subside.  I take stock.  My dick in hand, pants around my knees, in the open air of the bathroom, I first become aware of the smell.  My ass, my thighs, my pants and my underwear are covered in shit; a sickly spackling of brown spray insulation.  I am rocketed back to reality.  “Fuck. Me.”  I waddle into a nearby stall and wrap a mitt of toilet paper around my fist, doing my best to scrape the pyroclastic shit flow from my ass and thighs.  I delicately pull my feet through my pant legs.  The underwear caught the brunt of it and are a completely lost cause.  With grim determination, balanced against the walls of the stall, I pull the underwear off, the heft of its soiled cloth is sickening.  I spot clean a couple of chunks from my pants and pull them back over my bare ass.  I toss my underwear into the trash and cover it with layer upon layer of paper towels.  I clean myself up as best as I possibly can and come to a frightening realization.  I don’t have to piss anymore.  I still owe Mack a urine sample, he’ll be back any minute and I have nothing to give him.  Like a man possessed, I rush back out to the drinking fountain, guzzling water as if the answer to everything was somewhere at the bottom of that drinking fountain.  The passage of time fades, another hour passes for me, frantically hunched over the drinking fountain. Mack returns, his face tired, his demeanor annoyed, the beginning of his dutiless weekend held back only by the strange, disheveled man before him.  “Are you ready to go yet”.  No. “Yeah, sure”.  I follow him to the security station, mouth agape, uniform unsat as fuck, feeling every crackle of the dried shit on my legs.  I take my position in the bathroom, and I can hear him audibly gasp.  I know that I smell like shit.  He knows that I smell like shit. I know that he knows that I know that I smell like shit.  He takes a step back, just enough so that he can still see me in the mirror.  I unzip my pants.

(It is here that we must take a brief detour to describe human male biology to readers who may not be familiar.  There is a certain phenomenon that occurs when blood is directed towards the male genitalia.  In most circumstances, this is in response to sexual stimulation, and as long as all parties involved have consented, this is actually a desirable response.  But not always.  Sometimes, the body will send blood to the genitals for other reasons.  On this day, after hours of manipulation (some perfectly banal and others quite violent) my quite confused nervous system could only conclude that something important was happening in my genitals, and it was best to play it safe and just send a bunch of blood there.  Back to the story)

I am fully torqued.  To my and I assume Mack’s dismay, I have what can only be described as an angry erection.  “Uh, I am so sorry, Mack.  I don’t.. this isn’t norma….”, I stammer.  “Are you fucking serious?”, he says sotto vocce.  “Please just get it the fuck over with, man”, Mack says out loud, in one breath, trying not to inhale.  I wrestle my blood filled member, doing my best to point it downward towards the cup.  We stand there for 5 minutes.  Nothing happens.  I’m at the verge of tears, Mack at the verge of vomiting.  “Please, please, please, please, please just gooooooo” I chant to myself through gritted teeth.  Nothing.  Mack is seething, holding back a violent gag.  Here he is, 1530 pm on a Friday, watching this strange sweaty junior NCO, who reeks of actual human shit, grotesquely grimacing as he bends his fully engorged cock into a piss cup, just mumbling “Sorry, Mack” over and over again.  The rules say that he has to observe the sample.  I cannot be left alone in that bathroom.

My head is throbbing.  My vision is blurring, the dangerously high levels of water in my body swelling my brain.  I am about ten seconds away from begging for a cath tube when Mack suddenly says, “I need to take that phone call, don’t go anywhere”.  The desk phone is not ringing.  Mack leans back and reaches for the phone, all while keeping his foot jammed in the door.  He goes through the motions of a performative conversation.  “Hey.  Yep. Uh huh…”.  This is your chance!  Does a foot in the door count to my bullshit subconscious?  I take a deep breath.  Focus.  I close my eyes.  Foooocus.  A drop.  A trickle.  A stream.  “Oh fuck, yes”, Mack hears from the cracked door, confirming his suspicion that I am some sort of degenerate weirdo.  I fill the cup and drain for a full minute.  Mack steps back in, opens the door the rest of the way.  “Hold up the cup”.  I screw on the lid and hold it over my right shoulder.  He confirms, I sign the paperwork, he signs the paperwork.  Delirious, I lack the better judgment to hold my tongue.  “Who was on the phone Mack?”, knowing full well he faked the call.  “Shut the fuck up and go home”.

I waddled home in a daze.  Confused.  Oversaturated.  Covered in shit.  Half-chubbed.  Brain swelling.  I grab a saltshaker, unscrew the bottom, and suck salt off of my finger until I fall asleep in my rack.  Osmosis is a bitch.  Next time, just cart me off to medical and stuff a tube down my dick.",2,1749493371.0,Paruresis,1,0.75,False

I’m dyslexic and text wrong numbers often and like it when people tell me I texted the wrong number. I got a response back that asked if I was serious. I responded yes. After that I got a text that apologized and said the assistant gave them my number. I was like no worries. Then I got a long worded text thanking me for being nice and protecting them from an awkward situation and wanted to buy me a coffee if we ever met and then asked where I was from. I just ignored it after that and there has been no more from this person. Was this a ‘scam’ to be friends to get nudie picks and then extort money or just a wrong number.

1l7c6m6,https://www.reddit.com/r/harate/comments/1l7c6m6/building_dreams_and_a_network_from_scratch_my/,Building Dreams and a Network from Scratch: My Journey as a Solo Architect in Bengaluru,"I’ve been lurking here for a while, soaking up all the wisdom and inspiration from this amazing community. Today, I want to share my story as a solo architect in Bengaluru, India, navigating the highs and lows of building my practice from the ground up over the past two years. It’s been a wild ride, and I hope my experience resonates with anyone trying to carve their own path in this field—or at least offers a glimpse into the grind!The Leap into Solo PracticeTwo years ago, I took a leap of faith. After working under some great mentors at established firms, I decided to go solo. I’m an architect with a passion for sustainable, context-driven design, and I wanted the freedom to create projects that aligned with my vision. Bengaluru, with its booming real estate, startup vibe, and diverse architectural landscape, seemed like the perfect place to set up shop. Plus, I was born and raised here, so I thought I had a decent lay of the land. Spoiler: Knowing the city and knowing its professional network are two very different things.Starting my own practice felt liberating at first—full control over my designs, my schedule, and my clients. But the reality of being a one-person show hit hard, fast. No HR team to handle paperwork, no marketing department to drum up leads, and no senior partner to lean on for advice. It was just me, my laptop, and a whole lot of ambition.The Struggle to Build a Contact BaseBengaluru’s architecture scene is vibrant but fiercely competitive. The city’s a mix of high-end developers, heritage conservationists, and budget-conscious clients, all with wildly different expectations. Breaking into this network as a solo architect with just two years of independent practice has been… let’s call it a character-building experience.

The Cold Call Conundrum: Early on, I underestimated how tough it is to build a client base from scratch. I spent months reaching out to potential clients—developers, homeowners, even small businesses—via emails, LinkedIn, and good ol’ phone calls. Most went unanswered. The ones who did reply often wanted “big names” or firms with a longer track record. I get it—trust is everything in architecture—but it stung to hear “come back when you have more experience” when I was already delivering solid work.

Networking in a New Way: Bengaluru’s professional circles can feel like a walled garden. I started attending local architecture events, real estate expos, and even sustainability workshops to meet people. These were hit-or-miss. Some events led to great conversations and thats all. Others felt like cliquey gatherings where established architects swapped business cards while I sipped coffee in the corner. Pro tip: Always carry a portfolio on your phone—it’s a lifesaver when someone unexpectedly asks, “So, what do you do?”

The Social Media Hustle: I turned to Instagram and LinkedIn to showcase my work. Posting renders, sketches helped me get noticed. But curating a feed that looks professional while staying authentic is a time suck. And don’t get me started on the cost of hiring a photographer for finished projects—my wallet still hasn’t recovered.

The Local Challenge: Bengaluru’s clients often want quick turnarounds and low budgets, especially for residential projects. Balancing creativity with cost constraints is a tightrope walk. I’ve had clients love my designs but balk at the timeline or fees, expecting MNC-firm speed from a solo operation. Explaining that quality design takes time (and fair compensation) is a skill I’m still honing.The Wins Amid the StrugglesIt hasn’t all been doom and gloom. Two years in, I’ve had some victories that keep me going:Small but Mighty Projects: I’ve completed a handful of projects I’m proud of—a compact G+4 home, a renovated a residence  and an interior design project for residence with a biophilic design. These projects are my calling card now, proof I can deliver.

Word-of-Mouth Magic: My first few clients came from personal referrals (shoutout to my cousin who convinced his friend to hire me!). Those early projects led to more recommendations, slowly building my network. It’s a reminder that doing good work is the best marketing.

Learning to Say No: Early on, I took every project that came my way, even ones that didn’t align with my vision or budget. Big mistake. Now, I’m learning to prioritize projects that let me flex my design muscles and clients who value my work.What I’ve Learned (and Advice for Others)

Patience is Key: Building a contact base takes time. Focus on quality relationships over quantity. One solid client who trusts you is worth ten flaky leads.Collaborate Locally: Partnering with local contractors, material suppliers, or even other architects for small collaborations has opened doors. Bengaluru’s construction ecosystem thrives on these connections.

Stay True to Your Niche: For me, it’s sustainable design with a local flavor. Sticking to that has helped me stand out in a crowded market, even if it means turning down some projects.The Road AheadI’m still a small fish in Bengaluru’s big architectural pond, but I’m optimistic. The city’s growth means there’s room for fresh voices, and I’m determined to be one of them. My goal for the next year is to land a mid-sized commercial project and maybe (fingers crossed) hire an intern to help with the workload.To anyone else out there starting their own practice, especially in a bustling city like Bengaluru: it’s tough, but it’s worth it. Keep showing up, keep designing, and don’t be afraid to ask for help—or coffee meetups!What about you all? Any solo architects or freelancers out there with tips for building a network?

1l7c5u3,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimMarriage/comments/1l7c5u3/husband_feels_too_pressured_when_hes_with_his/,Husband feels too pressured when he’s with his family and takes it out on me-is this normal?,"I’ve been married a month but have known him for 10 months. When his family visit or are involved, he seems to be frazzled, stressed and overwhelmed with the need to do everything for them, even at the expense of my needs. He feels suffocated by them but at the same time has tunnel vision for them when they’re around us. He has expressed to me that his younger brother never offers to pay for his mum and never gives him anything or does anything for him. He also expressed his mum picks on what he does and always tries to correct him. I’ve told reminded him that he is a brother and a son, not a father.

It seems as if he’s become a parentified son due to his parents divorce when he was 12. They struggled financially but Alhamdulillah he worked hard to buy an apartment and he also bought a car in order to marry me.

He seems to have insecurities about my lifestyle not matching his. I have a high salary and live above the means of an average person. He feels shame and guilt in not being able to give me what I want. I have never expressed desires for fancy gifts. Just a home, a small car and a gold ring. If we go on vacation I pay for half and he pays for half. I see it unfair to expect him to pay for something luxury when I’m the one who wants it. 

A few days ago he wanted to plan Eid vacation in a villa with a pool and asked me if I want to contribute. I said no, I am a new bride and his family is the one who should be contributing as his brother has a very good job and a side business. He said I was right but was sad because he knew whatever his family could afford would fall on him which means it wouldnt meet my “standards”. Me personally I don’t care if the villa has a pool or not. What’s important is to spend time together. We had a small disagreement where he admitted that he cannot afford me. I told him I can afford myself he just needs to focus on his duties as a husband and a man. On a separate note, prior to this discussion I had my own transgression : is that I made the mistake of saying “you’re not a man” to hurt him in retaliation to him not being able to express himself to his own brother and mother. This was a big mistake as he must have taken  that message and applied it to the financial aspect of our marriage. Fast forward to Eid, I’m with my in laws, we don’t speak the same language, from different cultures, different social classes, different life styles. It was good but ended on a horrible note. 

I’ll write a short description of how my first Eid went as a married woman:

We went on a short family trip with my husband, his mother, his sibling, and sister-in-law. I had concerns about maintaining certain health routines that help manage my vestibular migraines, including eating three meals a day, avoiding overheating, and limiting time in crowded places.
During the trip, after visiting the first beach, I expressed that I was tired and didn’t feel well enough to continue. However, the plan moved forward to visit additional beaches. Later that evening, I began to feel worse and asked my husband to help me get food. He was half-asleep and made a comment saying, “I’m never bringing you to a vacation with my family.” We walked to the beach area, but due to Eid, most restaurants were closed. I felt visible and self-conscious in the crowd and became tearful. We eventually ate late and got back to the accommodation at around 1 a.m.
The next morning, breakfast options were limited—mostly old pastries and sugary items. There was no fruit or protein available, and the gas wasn’t working, so I couldn’t prepare food myself. My husband went out and brought breakfast and fruit from a café and supermarket, which improved the situation.
He later went to the beach with his brother while I stayed at the accommodation. When he returned, I suggested going out for seafood. He declined at the time but agreed to have dinner after the return trip.
As we left the city, the journey was smooth until we stopped at a service station. I asked to sit at the café in the shade and have something to drink. He asked me to come outside to sit with the family, but I declined and said he could join them if he wanted to. He followed me inside and insisted I go outside. I stayed firm in my choice. He raised his voice in front of others and said, “I choose to go with my family. I won’t stay here with you.” I remained inside, ordered a coffee, but didn’t finish it as we needed to leave.
After dropping his family off, we continued toward Casablanca. Around 40 minutes from home, I started feeling nauseous from hunger, dehydration, and sun exposure through the car window. I vomited several times. He responded by driving faster to get us home. He asked what triggered the vomiting, and I explained it was from hunger. My vertigo symptoms intensified during this period. Once home, I had visible symptoms—my eyes were rolling back—and he placed a cold compress on my face. He went out to get dinner.
About 20 minutes later, I was feeling slightly better. When he returned with food, he asked why I had vomited on his foot without saying anything and questioned whether I cared about him. I was surprised by the question given the state I was in. I lost my appetite, which led to another disagreement. He said he didn’t think the marriage would last. I asked what made him feel that way, and he brought up various unresolved issues.
I expressed that I needed to sleep due to exhaustion. He wanted to continue the conversation. Feeling overwhelmed, I called my mother for support. He also spoke to her and explained that maintaining routine is important for my well-being. During the call, my symptoms returned briefly — my eyes rolled back again — and I lost capacity for a short moment. He encouraged me to speak to my mother again to reassure her, then I ended the call.
Afterward, we took a shower. While preparing to eat again, he asked why I didn’t reheat the food. I replied that the containers were plastic and metal and that the food still seemed fresh. He didn’t like my tone or response. I became anxious and cried again.
He became more upset and expressed that I was emotionally unstable, not feminine, and too demanding. He said I wasn’t understanding enough or willing to let things go. He made several comments about my behavior and its impact on the relationship. I responded by saying I was feeling afraid. I mentioned that his family seemed to be afraid of him as well. He took my phone while I was messaging my sister, which I found upsetting. I said I was beginning to feel unsafe and asked if I needed to contact the police. He then called my sister directly, as he had seen our messages. She spoke to us both and encouraged us to rest.
I took medication and went to bed. He said, “It’s going to be a long night,” and proceeded to turn on all the lights, put on a football match at high volume, eat, and cut his nails in the room. At some point, he came to the bed and asked for an apology. Then he resumed his activities and eventually went to sleep.

I was very scared and couldn’t sleep well until he left the house for work.

Can you advise please? Be open minded and kind in your responses.

How do I Forget the Bags?

By B.F. Rollins.  



My mom would tell me she felt an obligation to Aunt Lily because they were close growing up. Lily had a difficult time with money, and was the sole caretaker for a son from her divorce. Isaac was twenty-three and couldn’t live on his own. After Lily stopped taking him to his appointments he talked less and put on weight. I remember the footbaths Lily would set up for him while he watched TV. He’d soak there for hours, making the whole living room smell like epsom salt and skin.

I spent a lot of time at aunt Lily’s house. Isaac had a habit of collecting garbage in various containers. His largest repository was of empty tissue boxes, taking up nearly three whole plastic tubs near the fridge. If you touched them he would refuse to move for several hours. The loft was the only place that Isaac wouldn’t stash things. It was a simple room with a guest mattress. I didn’t like to sleep on it because it sometimes had weird stains. My mom let me play Wii up there while she and Lily talked. Our visits started becoming more frequent. Eventually we started going every Saturday.

Lily came up to the loft once. She sat very close to me on the bed and started telling me about her medicine. The smell of rancid coffee on her breath was distracting. She pressed a small brown glass bottle into my hand. There was a clear liquid inside which she said to drink a capful of every day. I showed it to my mom when we got home. Worry flashed on her face and she told me aunt Lily had different ideas about medicine that weren’t necessarily true. She said that even if Lily talked like she knew what was right, that only doctors who’d been to medical school had the knowledge to diagnose and prescribe remedies properly. Taking things that Lily gave me could be dangerous. I don’t know what she did with the bottle.

Our visits kept up for two more years and I graduated middle school. My mom got me a few Pokémon booster packs as congratulations. One of them contained a shiny Charizard, which became my most prized possession. I put it in a plastic sleeve and would take it with me places just so I could look at it. Around this time, Isaac’s complexion started to turn a shade of gray. The smell of whatever Lily rubbed on him stopped wearing off. I’d catch him walking out of the loft as I went up sometimes, sweating and breathing heavily.

I brought Charizard with me on my last visit to Lily’s. I was admiring it in an attempt to ignore the rumbling in my stomach. Aunt Lily only had PB&Js which I had grown tired of months ago. Eventually my hunger tore my eyes away from the card regardless. I left it on the bed as I went downstairs.

It took me a while to realize that Lily was out of peanut butter. Navigating Isaac’s various collections slowed my search. I heard his heavy footsteps on the stairs up to the loft as I opened another cupboard. A minute or two later, as I slathered two slices of white bread with a generous helping of grape jelly, I heard my mom call up to me. She was upstairs and hadn’t realized I was in the kitchen. Before I could respond, she started to yell my name a second time but stopped short.

Her footsteps raced down the stairs. She grabbed me by the arm and yanked me away from my sandwich fixings. I tried to ask her what was going on, but the look on her face silenced me immediately. I’d never seen her eyes so wide. As we raced out the door she mumbled a lie about a work project to aunt Lily which only confused me more. In the commotion I didn’t get a chance to go get Charizard.

I wanted to ask my mom about what happened on the drive home, make her turn around so I could go get my card, but her pursed lips and fixed stare intimidated me. In the end I said nothing. After that day whenever Aunt Lily would call, my mom would make an excuse as to why we couldn’t go over. It took about a week for Lily to stop reaching out. Whenever I tried to bring up her or Isaac, my mom’s face would grow dark and her responses would get curt. I learned to stop prying.

Two months later Isaac died. They said it was a heart attack. At the funeral Aunt Lily kept opening and closing her mouth. Her teeth hitting each other made this awful noise. My mom didn’t look at her. Lily went to stay with friends on the east coast. It was supposed to be temporary, but I never saw her again.

A friend offered me sixty dollars for my shiny Charizard recently. It was the first time I’d thought about it since my last visit to aunt Lily’s. I knew my mom kept a spare key. Part of me was screaming to not go, but I was saving up for an Xbox and I wanted that money. I waited for my mom to leave for work that weekend. As soon as I was alone I took the key from its dresser drawer and got on my bike.

The house stood silent and unchanged since I had last been there. On the ride over a terrible weight settled in my stomach. I had pushed it down somewhat, but I couldn’t hold it back anymore when I tried the front door handle and found it unlocked. 

Isaac’s garbage was still neatly piled in the living room: Cigarette butts, used coffee filters, empty lotion bottles. Something dripped from the bottom of the fridge door into a murky puddle on the linoleum. An oppressive feeling washed over me. I felt watched, judged. I made my way to the stairs.

With the electricity off, the light of the overcast afternoon outside was all there was to see by. It colored the walls and carpets gray. The stairs ascended into darkness. I turned on my phone flashlight before going up.

I paused before the last five steps to the loft. The feeling in my stomach grew heavier. I hadn’t gone high enough to see into the room, the window was the only thing visible to me. Dust hung in the air. It took a lot of courage to push myself forward. I stopped on the penultimate step.

The mattress was covered with a wide sickly yellow stain. I didn’t see my Charizard where I’d left it. My heart started pounding in my ears. As soon as I stopped holding my breath I noticed the smell.

It was thick, invading my nostrils, making my eyes water. I’d never experienced anything like it before: Chlorine air from a stagnant pool, sweat, sink mold. 

There was a plain paper grocery bag in the corner. Top folded down, its sides bulged; overfull. Another identical bag sat next to it, but this one was still open. The stench emanated from them. I could almost see it in the air. Isaac had collected something in this room.

I biked home so fast that I could taste blood in my teeth. I couldn’t explain to my mom why I was crying when she got back. Now whenever I think about my time in that loft, the smell comes back to me. The bags I always just looked over burn into my memory. How do I forget them? How do I stop feeling sick?",3,1749493051.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False
1l7c4j5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l7c4j5,I Ordered from the PSA your overpaying post websites in CZECH Republic,"BCV (pics 5 & 6)website was super easy, barely an inconvenience. 
 BIJOUX COMPONENTS (pics 1-4) website is a little harder to navigate. There was good communication via email. They had me put in a order request. Then they packed & verified shipping & customs stuff on their end before sending a payment request. I paid some kind of optional small fee (maybe 6€) on top of the shipping that had to do with VAT/ customs paperwork. Good experience! Would definitely recommend. 
 Both shipped FedEx, BIJOUX was priced higher, but faster, no tracking & USPS did the final delivery. BCV shipping was slow, had tracking & FedEx delivered. 
  
 Those coasters are awesome! I did crack the BCV mug. 100% my fault. It says no hot liquids. But as a coffee drinker, a .5L UG mug is just too great a temptation, I couldn’t resist. After almost a full week of use i got the dreaded “TINK”  There’s tiny crack behind the handle connection, almost impossible to see. I was preheating the mug with hot tap water & that still didn’t work.  When I order some Christmas gifts, unless something happens, I’ll use BIJOUX.

Hi there! 🤗

I hope you’re having a cozy, calm, or at least slightly sweet kind of day. I’m reaching out with an open heart, looking for a cuddle buddy (female) and maybe a new friend here in the Netherlands — ideally near Amsterdam, but anywhere not too far works too!

I’m not looking for any sexual activity and I stick to what we agree. 

A little about me:

• I'm 35 years old guy working as an executive and happily calling Amsterdam home for over 3 years now.
• I live alone, take care of myself, and try to stay fit — but also never say no to dessert.
• I’d be happy to host or come to you — whatever makes you feel safe and comfortable.
• I love being outside, especially in the summer — picnics, strolls, a lazy lunch on a sunny terrace… simple things, really.
•Traveling is a big part of my life and dreams — I’d love to see the whole world, one new place (and snack) at a time.
• I’m a good listener — friends often say I make them feel calm and heard. You’ll get lots of warm, respectful hugs and cozy company if that’s what you need 🤗
• Cleanliness and kindness go hand in hand for me — I value both deeply.
• I'm 183 cm tall, 80 kg, have broad shoulders, little muscular, tanned skin, black hair, brown eyes.

What I’m looking for:

Someone to share gentle, genuine connection with — whether that’s cuddling up on the couch, sharing a quiet moment over coffee, or just chatting about our days.

I’m also open to making new friends — movie nights, cooking together, mini-adventures nearby… whatever brings joy without pressure.

And of course, if you’d prefer to meet in a public space first, that’s absolutely fine — your comfort always comes first.

So if you’re someone who values kindness, closeness, and maybe the occasional silly laugh — I’d really love to hear from you. 💛

Let’s make a little space in this busy world for warmth and connection.

Looking forward to saying hi on DM!!

Note: I am not good at chatting online and prefer to meet and talk. So if you are looking for online chat buddy, we will waste each other time.",1,1749492986.0,r4r,1,1.0,False
1l7c2jq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l7c2jq,Help with natives surrounding oak trees.,"We just had a ligustrum turned tree cut down due to rot and infestation. It was next to two oaks and inside a mulched bed between and surrounding. I’m considering shiny leaf coffee to surround the base of the oaks but would love advice for a smaller layering plant to put in front of the coffee plants. I really like bushier green plants that flower at some point during the year. Kind of an old school southern vibe but wanting to do it with natives. I’m attaching photos of the space as is and then two AI images, one with ferns etc (do NOT like) and the next with bushier natives (like more but doesn’t feel complete).

And we do have a hammock stand but we positioned it just to the left of the oaks, rotated 90° compared to the images and will put it back in that same way (so the images are misleading as far as the hammock goes).

Inland edge of zone 9a/9b.
