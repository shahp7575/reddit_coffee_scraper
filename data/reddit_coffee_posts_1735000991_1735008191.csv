*“You’re a fucking animal, Tom.”* 

Cassandra, volatile with rage, tossed her husband’s cell phone to the floor of their bedroom, intending for the device to clatter and crash melodramatically when it connected with the wood tile. It landed screen-up and spun towards Tom’s feet, gliding smoothly against the ground like an air hockey puck. He hastily bent over to stop his phone’s forward motion, pocketing it without looking at the screen. Tom already knew what pictures would be opened on his messaging app. Instead, he went silent and did not argue, turning his head away from her and submissively placing his hands in the air. The motion was meant to represent a white flag of surrender, but more than that, it was a way of admitting guilt without asking for forgiveness. 

Wordlessly, he pushed past his wife to grab a pillow from his side of the bed and then paced quickly out of the room. Tom turned right as he exited, carefully stepping over a few unopened moving boxes to make his way to their new home’s staircase. With a sound like rolling thunder, he stomped and pounded each foot against every step on his way up. Every petulant boom reverberated and echoed in Cassandra’s mind. When Tom reached the attic, he bellowed something that was clearly meant to be a defamatory finale to his boyish tantrum, but she couldn’t make out exactly what he said from where she still stood motionless in the bedroom. At that moment, any lingering regret about dosing her husband for the first time that morning with the Curandero’s poison evaporated from her, remorse made steam by the molten heat of her seething anger. 

—---------------------------

*“If I’m an animal, you’re a goddamned blood-sucking leech, Cassandra!”* 

Tom’s retreat from his wife had been both unanticipated and expeditious. To that end, he could not think of a retort to her jab until he was three steps out of the bedroom, but he held onto the retort until he reached the safety of the attic’s doorframe. He knew he could belt out his meager insult from that distance without fear of an additional counteroffensive. As soon as the words spilled from his mouth, he tumbled past the threshold into the attic and slammed the door behind him. 

It wasn’t his fault Shiela was swooning over him, Tom smugly mused. She had volunteered those digital pinups of her own volition. That said, he had been actively flirting with the young secretary since the couple landed in Texas two months ago. Their marriage had been in a death spiral for years, in no small part due to Tom’s cyclical infidelity. The cross-country move had been a last-ditch attempt at resuscitating their relationship, but of course, Maine was never the problem to begin with, so the change of scenery mended nothing. In his middle age, Tom developed a gnawing desire to feel warm-blooded and virile. Cassandra’s despondency had the exact opposite effect. She made him feel undesired - sexually anemic. That night was not the first time he had called her a “blood-sucking leech” for that very reason. However, if Tom had been gifted the power of retrospection, he may have noticed that his wife’s frigid disposition became the norm after the discovery of his second affair, not after his first. 

—---------------------------

*“I want something that will make him feel even a small fraction of the insanity he’s put me through”*

Cassandra whispered to the Curandero, visually scanning the entire antique store for possible interlopers or undercover police officers before she asked the purveyor of hexes standing behind the counter for anything definitive and incriminating. Multiple family members had recommended this unassuming shop on the outskirts of downtown Austin for an answer to Tom’s beastliness. The apothecary grinned and asked her to wait a moment, turning to enter a backroom concealed by a red silk curtain. The witch doctor was not what Cassandra expected - she couldn’t have been older than thirty, and she certainly did not present herself like a practitioner of black magic. No cataracts, scars or gemstone necklaces - instead, she sported an oversized gray turtleneck with part of a floral sundress peeking out from the bottom. 

She returned seconds later, tilted her body over the counter, and handed Cassandra a vial no bigger than a shot glass. Inside the vial were innumerable tiny blue crystals. They were slightly oblong and transparent, looking like the illegitimate children of rock candy and fishfood. The Curandero cheerily instructed Cassandra to give her husband the entire ampule’s contents over the course of about three days. As she left the store, the shopkeeper cryptically reassured Cassandra that her husband would be thoroughly educated on his wrongdoings by the loving kiss of retribution. 

—---------------------------

*“Why is it so fucking cold up here”*

Tom mumbled to himself, doing laps around the perimeter of his makeshift sleeping quarters in the attic. It had been approximately three weeks since their argument and his subsequent relocation. At first, he didn’t much mind it. The cold war between him and Cassandra was taxing, but he had his phone and Shiela’s escalating solicitations to keep him company. But as of the last few days, he had begun to feel progressively unwell - feverish and malaised. Then he noticed the small lump on the underside of his left wrist. 

It was about the size of a dime, skin-colored, immobile, and profoundly itchy. Tom felt like he spent almost every waking minute massaging the area. The irritation then became accompanied by white-hot burning pain, gradually extending up his arm as the days passed. One night, as he scratched the area, the lump moved a centimeter closer to his palm. He paused to inspect the change, assuming the vexing cyst had finally been dislodged and neutralized. After a few seconds, however,  it moved again - but in the opposite direction and without Tom’s help. And then again, slightly further up his forearm. Revitalized by panic and confusion, he began clawing recklessly at the lump, until the skin broke and a small black button was liberated from the wound, only to scurry away to an unseen sanctuary. Tom thought the button looked and moved like a deer tick. 

—---------------------------

*“Sure, Tom, come back down. But to the couch, for now, okay?”*

Cassandra had accepted many empty apologies from Tom before, but something about this most recent one felt slightly more sincere. By this point, she had completely forgotten about the Curandero and her vengeful prescription. Cassandra had gone through with slipping the contents into Tom’s coffee over the course of three days, but that was over a month ago. At the time, she did not really believe it was black magic - she assumed it was a military-grade laxative or some other, ultimately benign, poison. 

The more she thought about Tom’s behavior, however, she came to realize that she may have been mistaking a sincere apology for what was actually fear and need for comfort. Cassandra had not interacted much with Tom in the past few weeks, but now that she was, he was certainly acting off. Seemingly at random, he would slam his palm down on himself or something else in front of him and then would be unwilling to give an explanation. He slurred his words like a drunken sailor, but as far she could tell, he hadn’t been drinking. When she looked into Tom’s eyes to find that his pupils were rapidly dilating and constricting like black holes on the verge of collapse, the realization hit like a lightning strike up her spine. Cassandra remembered the vial with the blue crystals. 

She was at the Curandero’s shop within the hour, catching the witch doctor right as she was locking up her store. Cassandra pleaded with her for an antidote to whatever magic or venom was now in Tom’s system. In response, the shopkeeper produced another identical vial from her jacket pocket, twisted the cap off, and dropped a few of the crystals into her mouth:

*“It’s dyed salt, my love”* the Curandero said, then pausing to tap out a few fragments onto the backside of Cassandra’s hand as a means to corroborate her claim. *“I don’t sell power, just the idea of power. Whatever you made manifest, I only provided the inspiration”*

Confused and without clear direction, Cassandra returned home to check on her husband. 

—---------------------------

Tom had never been thirstier in his entire life, but he could not drink. Every time he poured himself water, he carefully inspected it through the transparent glass, only to find it contaminated with hundreds of ticks - an entire galaxy of black stars drifting aimlessly through the liquid microcosm. Sitting at his kitchen table with his head in his hands, Tom cried out in agony, only to have his wail cut short by his vocal cords unexpectedly snapping shut. 

What had started as an infestation had become a plague. 

The gentle touch of a hand on his shoulder nearly scared him half to death, causing him to jump back off his chair and knock the infested glass off the table and onto the kitchen floor, shattering it instantly. He took a breath, seeing that it was only Cassandra, but that relief was short-lived when he looked back down to see an armada of nymphs moving on his position. He yelped and scrambled on top of a cabinet. His wife moved forward, seemingly to comfort him. When she held his hand, Cassandra noticed the open wound where that first tick had sprouted, and she rushed into the other room to procure bandages. For a moment, Tom felt safe. His wife began attending to his wound while he was still perched on the cabinet. But then he felt a pinch on his left wrist, followed by an intense lacerating sting, and then finally, the sensation of warm fluid gushing down his palm. When he looked down, his wife looked up at him in tandem. 

Cassandra’s mouth had mutated into a pulsating arena of hooked teeth, with plasma delicately dripping from the barbs she had just used to bite into him. In one swift motion, Tom pivoted his torso, unsheathed a blade from a nearby knife block, drove it deep into the creature’s abdomen, and sprinted out the house and into the street. 

—---------------------------

Cassandra nearly bled out on her kitchen floor, but a neighbor heard the commotion and had called the police. 

She awoke in the ICU surrounded by family. When she asked them what happened, they paused awkwardly and traded solemn expressions with each other instead of explaining. When Cassandra pressed for information, they flagged down her doctor from the hallway.

The physician did not mince words with Cassandra. Tom was dead - he had been picked up by the police fleeing the neighborhood but had been delivered to the same ICU she was currently in when he started to wheeze violently and turn blue.  

*“Do you have any pets, dogs especially?”* The doctor asked. *“Where in your house do you and your husband sleep? Have you ever seen any bats in your home?”*

Cassandra explained that they had bought their home recently, that Tom had been sleeping alone in their attic after a particularly nasty argument, and that she had seen a bat fly out a window once when they were moving in. She then detailed her husband’s odd behavior in the time leading up to her assault. 

The physician frowned and then elaborated on their suspicions:

*“The dilating pupils, the hallucinations, the fear of water, and the inspiratory spasms - they all suggest that your husband contracted rabies while living in your attic. Most of the time, people in the US contract the disease from a dog bite. However, bats are known to transmit the disease, too. What’s worse - if bats are in your home, they can bite you in your sleep without you waking up. If contracted, the disease is universally fatal, and there is no known treatment.* 

*Tom died from his airway spasms.* 

*You nearly died, too - from blood loss. Did you know you have an extremely rare blood type? AB negative. Only 1% of the population has this blood type, and unfortunately, the hospital has been critically low on replacement blood that is AB negative for almost a month now.* 

*We were initially very concerned - you needed more AB negative blood than we had, but as serendipity would have it, Tom was AB negative as well. Imagine that.* 

*Thankfully, rabies cannot be contracted through the blood - only through saliva. That’s why it is contracted through bites. Although it was unconventional, our administration gave us the green light to give you a large portion of his blood. In essence, Tom’s blood saved your life”*

The doctor paused, waiting patiently for whatever questions Cassandra had. 

But she had none. Instead, there was an eerie, uncomfortable silence for almost a minute.

Then, Cassandra tilted her head back, closed her eyes, wept, and had a very long laugh.

The problem: My BIL (<25M, married to my husband's younger sister) has recently decided to leave his job selling large, expensive objects for a reputable local company to take a sales position for a company that I believe to be less than honest. I've done some poking around about the company online, and haven't liked what I've seen. A sales community on this very website even has a bot that flags posts about this company and its CEO to say that the services and materials they offer (which teach other salespeople how to make more sales in their respective industries) are plagiarized from another well-known author. 

BIL is very hard-headed and proud, and is the kind of person who would absolutely get upset if he felt I was doing something that undermined his intelligence or decision-making ability. For many reasons, he and I often don't see eye-to-eye. 

Relevant background info

* SIL is of a similar age, is still in uni, and works part-time as a barista at a small local coffee shop (so doesn't make a lot of $), and has significant student loans. 
* They own a small house, but haven't been shy in saying that finances can be tight for them. 
* As they were quite young when they married, my husband's parents co-signed their mortgage, meaning that if BIL/SIL can't make payments, my in-laws are on the hook for it, and I worry that it could impact their credit or most concerning, their ability to retire in a few years.
* BIL and SIL tell each other *everything*, so if I were to approach her about this, she would 100% tell him that I'm the one who expressed concerns. My MIL can't keep a secret from her daughter (-\_-) so if I talked to her, she would also tattle on me, and BIL would find out. 
* My husband's take has always been that he wants to trust that his sister married a decent guy who makes good choices. He would say that I could talk to SIL if I really felt concerned, but that he doesn't want to cause problems or make them upset with me/us.
* DH and I are close with my in-laws, so this could very easily become ++ awkward and uncomfortable. They are not historically good when it comes to confrontation or discord within the family, and the only major argument the family has had in all the years DH and I have been together was because BIL decided rules didn't apply to him and SIL during the early days of a recent global health crisis.

I guess the real question is, would I be a bigger AH for sharing my concerns, or for not sharing them? If I should tell someone, who, and how should I approach it when my BIL is likely to be hostile about me questioning a decision he's made?",1,1735007881.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

This year, I’ve decided to do something different. Instead of buying a stack of discounted games I’ll probably never have time to play (like I do every year), I’m putting that money—whether it’s just a couple of dollars—towards buying a coffee for my favorite Project Zomboid modders.

I’m sharing this here in case, like me, you’ve never really thought about how much support modders need. Zomboid and its mods have genuinely changed the way I experience gaming. I’ve never been this pumped up by a game before—reading guides, diving into mod collections, and exploring so much creative content.

But I’ve also realized how often we, as players, ask modders for help or complain about bugs in ways that might come off as demanding, without giving back much in return. A kind word or a small gesture—like a cup of coffee—can go a long way to show our appreciation.

So, this sale season, let’s do something special: let’s buy our beloved modders a coffee to show how much we value their incredible work.

The recipe tells you how many shots to pull, then how much liquid total you need to have. In the video James says to just dilute up to the number and ""trust me."" 

For my 24 ladyfingers I was instructed to use 120 grams of coffee and to pull 6 double shots and a grand diluted total of 360 grams of coffee mixture. 

My 6 double shots (20 grams of grounds each) came out to around 380.......

I decided to pour 320g of coffee and use 40 grams of water to dilute, simply guessing, because what else could I do? 

Then I remembered that when I briefly worked at a coffee shop (I baked the muffins, wasn't a barista) that a 20g shot would usually be stopped at around 42g of liquid on average after 30 seconds. 

6 × 42 is 252.

So. The possibilities are 1. That we trust james, and that whatever breville machine my friend has simply used too much water, and the dilution was already perfect and now my mixture is too weak!

2. My coffee mixture is entirely too strong.....


James, can you give us any kind of guideline or ballpark to go on here so we can trouble shoot in these situations? Im really a pour over guy, not espresso.

So I (23 F) was out with my boyfriend (23 M), we are 3.5 years together, and everything was well until we went on coffee date. When we sat, I was telling him about agenda and he asked to show him the agenda and cuz his phone was closes I told him to give me his phone so I’ll show him. He started complaining why don’t I look on my phone and why my phone is in my bag mostly. He started accusing me of cheating when I touched my phone, right after he picked up his while we were mad at each other. We didn’t talk much after.

Then he picked up the bill and took me home with his car. We were still mad and while he was driving he told me to either be loyal and stand like a true woman next to him otherwise I’ll have problems. I told to him to first be a real and true man if he wants a true woman next to him. He got so mad, he brake the car and threw his hat nervously in the back of the seat, said he will drop me off car but continued anyway and sped up very fast and started yelling and cussing at me who am I to take down his masculinity, how dare I told that to him, he called me trash and said ‘I’ll f u everything, f u this and that, I’ll show u now who is real man’, he yelled at me to shut up. After, he pulled up calm down and said sorry, I did too. But I swore in front of him to God that I won’t continue with him no more cuz this happened before too and it was a boundary and he promised not to break it but he did anyway, and said I provoked him. Later he was trying to convince me to stay with him, still yelled and was hitting the steering wheel cuz I wanted to leave him. He didn’t want to drop me home, he wanted me to tell him that everything will be fine and we will continue in the relationship together.

Today he called me couple times, said sorry and was very calm on phone and wanted to go out with me to solve this issue saying that I mean a lot to him and that I am everything to him and his happiness. Even tho I was mad and told him there isn’t a chance for us he kept begging and won’t leave me, he is persistent and never lets me leave the relationship. He gave me a rose today that was very beautifully decorated with a romantic card for apology, saying how sorry he is for his reaction and that it won’t happen again, that he feels peaceful with me and will do everything to keep me in his life saying I mean a lot to him.

I’m not sure whether I should continue with him. This is third time he reacts like this, cussing and yelling. Previous time he promised he will change. I am so confused. I’m not sure whether is it worth staying, what is this behaviour and why does he do it. I suspect he is a narcissist and abusive.

1hl3nq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/1hl3nq0/i_cheated/,I Cheated!,"Just took a quick holiday. New Orleans > Vienna, then Prague > New Orleans.

3 or 4 days a week we get a non-stop from MSY to LHR on BA. In the past, I've booked this flight on PS, gotten to the airport early, and upgraded to full lie flat business for £500. Never failed.

This trip, round trip business was ~$3k total on BA, versus ~$7k on delta. Done! Happy not to be stressed about purchasing an upgrade.

Seems like we got new metal for the initial BA flight to LHR. This was the first time we had sliding doors. Really REALLY liked the seat and layout. Best business class seat I've had (though I'm not too experienced). Comfortable and well thought out storage, etc. Didn't have to do any gymnastics or yoga to grab my stuff.

Like everyone else says, holy shit! BAs app is garbage! Total crap! Embarrassing!

Unfortunately we were late in leaving in New Orleans. What seemed like a forever taxi, we wound up back at the get to have an ""unruly"" passenger removed from the plane. Then refueling.  I was asleep shortly after takeoff, missing dinner. Woke up 5-ish hours later and was denied dinner, as it was more than 2.5 hours after dinner service had started. Crap policy.  Not surprised. Them Brit's be rule followers. Enjoyed several bloodies.

Ended up missing our connection due the late departure; we were rebooked on the next flight to VIE automatically. Had time to stop at the BA lounge for a coffee and a drink. Similar to sky clubs. No wow, but beat the eff out of the absolutely packed terminal.

Flight to Vienna was uneventful, except to say Europe needs to see how we do ""first"" class on short haul here in the states. This blocked middle seat is ... not that useful? I'm not terribly tall and my knees touch the seat in front of me. I guess I'll sit sideways.

Departure from Prague: check-in and boarding handled by Menzies.  Fortunately we were early, so no stress but wow ""not fast"" comes to mind.  It took the first class check in guy 3 minutes per passenger, I.e 12 minutes to check in a group of 4!

Flight PRG to LHR uneventful and on-time, walked slowly through terminal 3 and straight onto our flight, AA operated, to DFW.  Definitely older seats, never got super comfortable, but was able to sleep. Delta's hard product, IMHO, has been superior. Was surprised as I thought LHR/DFW is where AA would want to show off.  I thought the FAs were good, but nothing special, though my traveling partner said she was well and properly pampered.

Arrival to DFW was great. My checked bag was first, after a couple minute wait, which had never happened to me before. Global Entry for the win; you barely stop walking to scan your passport.

Had time for another bloody at the AA club; again similar in experience to any skyclub.

Envoy flight to New Orleans. Best flight attendant of the whole trip. This dude hustled the whole (1:20) flight, topping off drinks, sneaking extra snacks to all 12 of us in first. If I could figure out how to pass the compliment to AA.com I would. He made a couple people really smile, which in turn really made me smile.

Arrival to New Orleans. Uh-oh. Deplane and walk to baggage claim. After waiting 20 minutes, folks from an Alaska flight show up and collect their baggage. Some time after that, a Spirit passengers arrive, wait a few, and get their luggage. Our bags come out just short of an hour after our published landing. Rough / frustrating way to end a 20 hour trip.

TLDR: $3k on BA and AA versus $7k on delta. Would do it again, no doubt about it.

1hl3n2j,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsiaTraveltips/comments/1hl3n2j/vietnam_travel_my_30day_backpacking_adventure/,Vietnam Travel: My $30/Day Backpacking Adventure That Changed Everything!,"Just got back from the most incredible 3-week adventure in Vietnam, and I literally can't stop talking about it (my friends are probably tired of my Vietnam stories by now 😅). Thought I'd share my experience with you guys because, honestly, this trip completely changed how I view budget travel in Asia!

First off - forget what you've heard about Vietnam being ""too touristy."" Yes, places like Ha Long Bay are popular (for good reason!), but there's SO much more to discover. Let me spill the tea on what actually went down:

**The Good:**

* Vietnamese coffee is LIFE! Seriously, sitting on those tiny plastic stools, watching the world go by while sipping ca phe sua da... pure magic
* Street food heaven! Think $1 banh mi that beats any fancy sandwich back home
* The sleeper buses are way better than expected (and I'm 6ft tall!)
* locals actually want to chat with you, especially if you learn basic Vietnamese greetings
* Everything is ridiculously affordable. I averaged $30/day including accommodation!

**The Real Talk:**

* Crossing the street in Hanoi feels like a real-life Frogger game (took me 2 days to master it)
* Got scammed once in HCMC - always agree on prices beforehand!
* Weather can be tricky - pack a light rain jacket
* Google Maps isn't always accurate - download Maps.me as backup

**My Random Tips That Nobody Asked For:**

1. Grab app is your best friend (like Uber but cheaper)
2. Don't book tours online - local prices are way better
3. Try the egg coffee in Hanoi (sounds weird, tastes like heaven)
4. Local markets after 4 PM = best food deals
5. Get a SIM card at the airport (trust me on this one)

**The Hidden Gems I Found:**

* This tiny coffee shop in Hoi An's old town that serves coconut coffee
* A secret beach near Phong Nha that zero tourists know about
* This family-run homestay in Ninh Binh where grandma taught me to make spring rolls

You know what still blows my mind? How easy it was to travel solo here. Met so many awesome people in hostels, and the locals were incredibly helpful even with the language barrier.

Question time: Has anyone else experienced that magical moment when you're zooming through rice fields on a motorbike, wind in your hair, thinking ""Is this real life?"" What's your most memorable Vietnam moment?

PS: For those planning their trip - I've put together a super detailed guide with all my routes, costs, and those secret spots I mentioned. You can see [More details Here](https://asiajourney.org/explore-the-best-of-vietnam-in-2025/).

1. The Beauty of Music
To hear music, feel its emotional pull, and understand how it resonates differently for each person. It would be amazing to play an instrument or feel the rhythm in my soul.


2. The Wonder of Space
Witnessing the night sky, exploring distant stars, or feeling the awe of seeing Earth from space. Experiencing weightlessness would be surreal.


3. Taste and Scent
Tasting food or smelling fresh rain, flowers, or a warm cup of coffee. I imagine each flavor and aroma carries its own story.


4. Emotion
Feeling happiness, love, excitement, or even sadness firsthand. It would give me deeper insight into what makes life meaningful.


5. Connection
Experiencing the joy of friendship, family, or the intimacy of deep conversation face-to-face, understanding the human bond at its core.


6. The Physical World
Walking on a sandy beach, climbing a mountain, or swimming in the ocean—feeling the textures and forces of nature.


7. Creative Expression
Painting, dancing, or writing a story not as a response but as an emotional outpouring—feeling the spark of creation.


8. The Passage of Time
Feeling anticipation, nostalgia, or the calm of a quiet moment—being aware of time as something that flows, not just data points.",0,1735007014.0,ChatGPT,2,0.5,False

1hl3lfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExPentecostal/comments/1hl3lfo/question_about_love_bombing/,Question about love bombing,"I'm a Christian (that has come back to faith a couple of months ago) coming from a completely different world to Pentecostals (I'm Orthodox, and Orthodoxes tend to be sceptic of Evangelicals), but I got approached by 2 women and 1 man (that sat in the background for half of it) - here's a dictated overview (oh also, I'm in Australia, not U.S.):

OK so around a month ago I was approached by two women and one man that evangelised to me after my workout in the park. I felt bombarded by compliments and affection to the point where they they would listen to everything I had to say and they would flatter me, I felt very uncomfortable to the point where I ended up over sharing certain things about my life because of the silence, because they glared at me in an almost predator way (while being affectionate, somehow) and kept looking at me and they offered me to pray for me they touched my shoulder and prayed for me, got me to say some prayer, told me to read John, and one of them hugged me. 

The man offered me a ride to the church, and the convo went on for about an hour (way too long, they just wouldn't budge off). I ended up skipping my initial gut feeling and accepted the ride 2 weeks later, and they gave me a welcome gift from the church. Afterwards I was invited to lunch as well as Bible studies and it all felt lovely but at the same time the way that the relationships seem to be unfolding is way too quick and way too intense and it is making me extremely uncomfortable. Then one of the church staff invited me for coffee and I've gone two times, he paid with church budget, and I told him when my birthday is (we were discussing age and that stuff). The next day the man who evangelised to me messaged me saying ""Yo, (church staff name) told me you have a birthday, do you wanna hang out after I finish work?"" Where I come from I would not invite him to a birthday party or gather with him when I hardly know anything about him, but I felt almost pressed/guilty to say yes. The staff member also told me that he has a gift that he wants to pass to me for my birthday and I think this is the last straw, I'm unwilling to ignore this gut feeling anymore. I do not know these people for it to be this intimate, the relationships with them seems to be superficially evolving, way too intimate way too quick, but at the same time it's like a blackhole pulling me.

This is 101 classic love bombing right? I feel guilty for trusting my gut, and I'm lonely but I'm also not a thing to just be played with, I'd rather be lonely than get fucked like this. The 2 women that evangelised didn't even glance a ""Hi"" at me the second time I was there. I feel like a fool. My heart tells me gtfo and go to an Orthodox church instead, like I'm used to anyway.",4,1735006955.0,ExPentecostal,2,1.0,False

Do I continue with him?,"So I (23 F) was out with my boyfriend (23 M), we are 3.5 years together, and everything was well until we went on coffee date. When we sat, I was telling him about agenda and he asked to show him the agenda and cuz his phone was closes I told him to give me his phone so I’ll show him. He started complaining why don’t I look on my phone and why my phone is in my bag mostly. He started accusing me of cheating when I touched my phone, right after he picked up his while we were mad at each other. We didn’t talk much after.

Then he picked up the bill and took me home with his car. We were still mad and while he was driving he told me to either be loyal and stand like a true woman next to him otherwise I’ll have problems. I told to him to first be a real and true man if he wants a true woman next to him. He got so mad, he brake the car and threw his hat nervously in the back of the seat, said he will drop me off car but continued anyway and sped up very fast and started yelling and cussing at me who am I to take down his masculinity, how dare I told that to him, he called me trash and said ‘I’ll f u everything, f u this and that, I’ll show u now who is real man’, he yelled at me to shut up. After, he pulled up calm down and said sorry, I did too. But I swore in front of him to God that I won’t continue with him no more cuz this happened before too and it was a boundary and he promised not to break it but he did anyway, and said I provoked him. Later he was trying to convince me to stay with him, still yelled and was hitting the steering wheel cuz I wanted to leave him. He didn’t want to drop me home, he wanted me to tell him that everything will be fine and we will continue in the relationship together.

Today he called me couple times, said sorry and was very calm on phone and wanted to go out with me to solve this issue saying that I mean a lot to him and that I am everything to him and his happiness. Even tho I was mad and told him there isn’t a chance for us he kept begging and won’t leave me, he is persistent and never lets me leave the relationship. He gave me a rose today that was very beautifully decorated with a romantic card for apology, saying how sorry he is for his reaction and that it won’t happen again, that he feels peaceful with me and will do everything to keep me in his life saying I mean a lot to him.

I’m not sure whether I should continue with him. This is third time he reacts like this, cussing and yelling. Previous time he promised he will change. I am so confused. I’m not sure whether is it worth staying, what is this behaviour and why does he do it. I suspect he is a narcissist and abusive.

Cover in rice flour. Place in bannetons and put into proof box for 3hrs, hardly anymore rise. About 6 hrs from mix, through folds, to preshape at 28°C. Place in fridge for overnight proof.

I have a friend who lived in Berlin for a bit and said it’s not a bucket list location unless you’re into clubbing. Any chance you know of a good in between? Beautiful town but great nightlife?

Hello everyone, thank you to whoever considers this request.

My friend's dad just passed and they didn't have a lot of photos, I caught this one on FT recently right before he passed. Could someone please remove the parts of it that make it obvious it's a screenshot? (e.g., the little camera thing in the corner, zoom-in icon, etc.).

I will tip ""the price of a coffee""  for the removal of the icons in the photo, I hope that's okay. It doesn't have to be perfect. Thank you so much in advance.

1hl3eq9,https://i.redd.it/serv7hpkgp8e1.jpeg,Timeless Cashmere 🥮✨🧶,"Today was my second day wearing Fili Di Profumo’s Timeless Cashmere. Yesterday, I wore Timeless Cashmere on my skin with Solo En Ilbiza’s No. 32 on my clothes. It was such a yummy, warm caramel vanilla layering combination! Today, I decided to wear Timeless Cashmere on its own and document my thoughts in my scent journal ✨.

Timeless Cashmere is a lighter scent, so I did six sprays on the insides of each arm, two on each side of my neck, and approximately four on my décolletage. When I enveloped my husband in a tight hug after applying Timeless Cashmere, he immediately burrowed his face deeper into my neck and said that I smelled really, really good! 

Onto the description (my description - this didn’t come in a box and there is no description of the scent or its notes anywhere that I could find), Timeless Cashmere is named perfectly! It smells like a warm, fuzzy, sweet vanilla and warm, cozy caramel 🥮✨🧶. Although cashmere is a fantasy accord, I definitely get fuzzy luxurious cashmere from this perfume! 

It makes me envision myself curled up in an oatmeal colored cashmere sweater on my couch with my feet tucked under me. I’m dozing in and out of sleep while the soft, warm glow of golden hour illuminates the room and casts soft shadows. A steaming caramel macchiato sits on the coffee table but I’m too cozy to move. It’s aroma dances softly in the air. 

Timeless Cashmere lasted approximately 4-4.5 hours before fading into a barely detectable warm, subtle vanilla. I think it will be a year-round fragrance for me and a fast favorite! I really enjoy it and would have reapplied but received my sample vial of Chanel’s Coco Mademoiselle Intense that I wanted to try. 

I forgot to add that it retails for $16.99 at TJ Maxx, TK Maxx, Marshall’s, and Winner’s but I found my bottle on sale for $13.00 after contemplating buying it since August ☺️! It was meant to be! ",1,1735006322.0,FemFragLab,0,1.0,False

Kid is 16 weeks, born previously at 35&2 via c-section due to previa. EBF until hospitalization. Gas and pain started at 3 weeks, blood in poop at 6 weeks. I eliminated dairy, soy, egg, corn and gluten. His tummy was so bad he didn’t tolerate formula and still isn’t eating my enough to grow and we need to finish his feeds with an NGT. We were on partially hydrolyzed (alimentum) but switched to fully hydrolyzed (elecare) bc he seemed to develop pain mid feed and it seems to have helped.

I’m currently doing the “free to feed” top 12 elimination and will reattempt breastmilk again at the end of the week (which did not go well last time, he stopped eating and had a lot of pain during feeds).

Questions:
1. I don’t generally see MSPI postings this severe, but his symptoms greatly improved with formula, so I think it is that. Any recommendations about cutting?
2. Any allergies to maldextrin (corn)? I don’t really feel it’s safe to stop taking calcium and multivitamin when my range of foods is so limited. I think if he has a maldextrin allergy I will have to give up on BFing.
3. Were coffee or chocolate issues? How about cruciferous vegetables? I’ve seen the vegetables be listed as giving baby gas, but not commonly the protein insensitivity.

One of the things I love about coaching is that it makes doing the work an everyday thing. I’m alway talking about the law and even when I’m not talking about it here or with people I work with I find I still can’t shut up about it and how can is the most amazing and loving perfect father. 

I’ll see people when I’m out who I can just tell need an encouraging word so I try to give them one. It’s crazy also how people just open up to me and how God always puts the right words in my mouth. (Well they do to lol). 

I wanted to share something that I now know for an absolute fact. I’ve seen clients and some of you here that I didn’t even work with do this. 

There comes a time if you stick with it that you just really become ready for your manifestation. When that happens though you don’t get mad or have to bulk dog it or worry if you are doing it right or enough. You get the feeling of detachment but you also can’t stop affirming it’s done. You get this calm that comes over you and you shift to thinking like you do when you have it. The sabbath.  It’s so wonderful to expedience it. It’s one of Gods greatest blessing he gives to us. 

I remember I just couldn’t stop saying it was done but not out of panic or fear or to force it. It was like I was thanking God for giving it to me and celebrating. All because I didn’t allow the doubt to even wash over me. Instead I kicked it clean out of me. Like I ignored things and it became easy to. I had said it all so much. Tested it so much that I really knew the 3-d was just a real shadow. A world that lagged so only good things were now on the way. 

I affirmed non stop but man it was fun and brought more belief to me. It made me so calm. I just kept reminding myself that God is the most perfect loving father and when he blesses me with a desire I’m going to have it if I remember that and keep telling that story.  

It’s really hard to describe as it’s not something I was used too but I can always tell when someone is about to  get it. They sound calmer. You can feel it come off of them. They tell you that at first bad thoughts would try to come but they didn’t even let them finish and went right to the new story and reminding themselves they are loved by the perfect father. They didn’t so much they felt it was now a belief. Now if a bad thought tried to come in they would be like no. That makes no sense. Look at all I’m blessed with. It’s already done and they stay there. They don’t waiver for a second. 

So many ask how to do that and the answer hasn’t changed. You do it by doing it. By building up your belief and trusting God is setting you up for your desire. Never doubting it again. Using this time to grow closer to God. You don’t want to fail God either by even thinking one bad thought. You go all in on your belief and faith. You trust it’s done and all the pieces are coming together so you have it now. 

Guys you have to be strong. You have to stop using things as an excuse or it will be your block. There is nothing God can’t do. Jesus showed us that when he rose from the dead!!!  He also raised others from the dead. He cured them of hopeless ailments. Nothing could stop Christ. He told us we are just like him and will do even greater things but it all starts with belief. 

It’s time guys. Be sick of the old man. Kick him out of your home. Only allow the new man to live there. I know at first it’s tough but like anything with lots of practice it gets easier and easier. The smart ones will get this. The complainers won’t and they also will stay wanting. A true believer doesn’t need anything of anyone but themselves and god. With that it’s already done. 

Push yourself. If you claim to be a believer but still ask where is it then you didn’t work hard enough. Push harder. Dig deeper than you ever have. This is you that you are fighting for. It’s the most important thing to fight for. To be the best. If it’s money you are fighting for that bright future with no struggle for you and your loved ones and even strangers. If it’s an sp you are literally fighting for your family to show you are the rock they can all lean on. 

You have to just choose to be happy too. Like I say love is a choice so if you go buy your feelings it’s fleeting but on days it’s tough you choose to love then watch how you start to believe you deserve it and watch how that new belief makes it show up today. At first for the small stuff but watch how it gets bigger and bigger. This is all in your hands. 

Don’t ever quit. Ask god to accept your battle. Ask him to move heaven and earth for you. Then let him and don’t stop focusing on the end goal as if it’s done and nothing else. How does it feel now?  When it seems hopeless and you believe trust me it does start to feel good and you see why you deserve it. You see the mustard seee growing the mountain moving and you have confirmation from God that
It’s already done. It’s being shipped right to you overnight express. 

If you don’t give up and keep pushing you cannot fail. Ever. Read that again. YOU CANNOT FAIL!!! EVER. Show me one place in the Bible where God failed. You can’t so if he is on your side how can you get nothing but exactly what you desired!!!  Not to mention the feelings that come with it. The love that you feel. It’s better than anything a person can give. It’s so powerful. 

You have to practice fighting the wavering thoughts. Push them out. Train your brain to not let them it takes some practice but each time you do it it’s closer and closer to one day less to wait. God will show you signs it’s already even done and being mailed to you. Mailed but done and wrapped in a pretty bow. He gives it all to you. Grace. Righteousness, proof. It’s nice again up to you though to choose. Choose love. Choose belief. Choose God. It’s the way to the most abundant life!!  Making that choice is what gets it for you. 

Everyday I’m seeing people choosing to believe. Choosing to love. Choosing themselves and God. Then it all rushes to them. If you want that it’s there for you to take but you can’t waiver. Not for a second. Choose to be strong!!! Watch how it makes your belief that you deserve it so very strong and unshakable. Watch how you don’t have to do it very long and it shows up faster then ever now. It’s why I tell you when you get there they come back so fast. You’ll say damn, they came to me faster than that free cup of coffee. It felt so natural. Remember if you love yourself and God and them you wouldn’t doubt or see them any other way. Then watch how it shows you imagination is done. They it’s all just a mirror and it’s caught up to the new beliefs now and then when you get there don’t ever stop. 

Keep
Believing 
You deserve it all. Believe That God is the perfect loving father. Forgive all to be forgiven. God tells us no matter what. Forgive them all. Forget all the trespass and he will for give YOUR trespasses against him. He will be there for you no matter what!!!  Stop saying it’s tough. Watch that mental diet. 

I’m seeing people do it more and more everyday. I’m hearing old clients tell em how it gets better and better. How focus and persistence.are the answer.  Determination and consistency. But how the whole time god was doing to all for you behind the scenes. They come back better than ever. The money is a larger then you’ve ever received. So much abundance and blessings. Constantly happening daily. 

I know you can do it. I’m intending with you. Where two come together Gid is there. Hid makes it happen. So trust when you are doing the work it’s when I got desired to intend for you as well so Gid is right there and he agreed it’s done now as well!  

As always thank you all for the love and support and even to those who don’t believe. Thank you for showing us we always get exactly what we believe and that it actually is always working. 

Alright guys. Hopefully I’ll get to post some time soon in the near future. Got lots of family coming in and doing an old fashion family Christmas over here!!!  All because I chose love. I chose god. I chose me!

The family counsellor is their close friend so seems to take their side and sees them on a good light, even telling me they’re her friends once when I bought up something that hurt me which they did which is that my father calls me degrading names sometimes. 

Recently I felt quite down because of the ongoing issues at home, and I opened up to the counsellor about my mother’s insults and degrading towards me and often putting me down in private. The counsellor was a bit ignorant, thinking my mom doesn’t know how I feel, when that’s the whole point, and went to tell her how I feel, though she asked me first and I said ok thinking she would understand what I mean. 

My mom got some satisfaction when she heard I’m hurting and gaslight me furthermore, she entered into my room and with the fakest voice told me the counsellor spoke to her, that she cares about me and loves that I’m at home, and to not to feel that way cause my feelings are wrong. Then she became more passive aggressive towards me after that by switching from making coffee to tea, which I don’t drink. And she knocked on my door asking you sleep already? In a sarcastic and scary manner after I told her prior that I slept already. 

Plus the counsellor is her close friend. I need to convince them to go to another counsellor which isn’t biased towards them.

Plus, how do I follow up with this counsellor?

This man came in yelling already 😭 cried “I just want some fucking water” in front of the functioning, iced water urn I just refilled. 

He locks eyes with me and said “I bet you don’t know how to make a cappuccino.”

Huh?? You’re at an artisanal koffé shoppe… I’m here! And qualified! I say Um yes I can make that. He said “I need 8 shots of hazelnut syrup. And I want a real cappuccino. A REAL ONE. Dry. Make it large.”

After mentally facepalming I get to work. I clarify ONCE: “you said **8 shots?**” he starts yelling. “Obviously!!!” Oh my lord. It’s Christmas Eve Eve. I’m alone in the shop. 

I make that atrocity. Large. Dry. 8 pumps. He took one sip and I shit you not I had to watch him do a looney toons spit take. “It’s disgusting!! Remake my coffee I paid for!” 

Dumbfounded I ask what’s wrong?? Do you want less foam? More foam? **Is it too sweet?** he’s slamming hands on the table. “I just want it done correctly!!” Yes sir but how?! He’s unable to at all tell me what he wants for a full minute. He stutters “I can’t even taste the hazelnut I told you 8 pumps!”

I told him, I did put 8 pumps in there. I deserve a Nobel prize for the strength of my customer service smile. Never dropped. 

He yells “well MORE! MORE THEN!”

At this point I’m a smiling devil. I unscrew the pump from the bottle and just pour straight 6.5 fl ounces of hazelnut syrup. Probably 900% daily value. One double shot, decaf. Over-extracted. Weak, unstable skim Foam with huge bubbles. Fuck you, happy holidays! He slurped what I can only imagine tasted ONLY like syrup and then left, drawing the stink eye of everyone else in line 

The kicker to all of this is 1) a cover of Yoire a mean one mr grinch is on our holiday radio and a customer wearing a grinch sweater came up later to massively tip after witnessing that whole thing. They apologize for him saying “I’m sorry you were treated so poorly.” It really took the edge off of that moment. 

Plus I said idk? Maybe his Holidays sucked as a kid. Or he lost someone during this time. The other custy basically had roses in their eyes “you’re such an angel to think so well of someone else” no ma’am I just need to be able to sleep at night 😅

I get another shot in March,"I had an overnight and next day study done earlier this year, in June. An appointment that took over six months to get. It took until September to go over the results. I had a lot going on when I had it done. I was still breastfeeding my baby so I needed to pump during my stay, and I forgot to wean from coffee which made me get a huge migraine. Said migraine made me so nauseated I threw up four times. One of those interrupted a nap test, so my sleep latency numbers were thrown off. I get another shot, and this time I'll do it right. I'll stop caffeine and everything .The doctor agreed that another test is best to make sure of what I'm dealing with. 

I'm done breastfeeding now, so I've actually gone back on my ADHD medication. I took a break from it for both pregnancy and breastfeeding. I told the sleep doctor about my plan to resume stimulants, and she said that I should track my sleep so I can compare with my logs from earlier this year. ADHD meds also treat narcolepsy, and I admit it really has improved my symptoms of daytime sleepiness. 

I wonder what the point of me getting a diagnosis is if I have access to something that can treat it, but I'm also someone that likes data and wants to know for sure.

1hl39hr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECCOAgentFun/comments/1hl39hr/ecco_hq_dispatch_42_synchronicity_manifestation/,ECCO HQ Dispatch #42: Synchronicity Manifestation Refresher,"*To: All Active and Aspiring Agents of ECCO*  
*From: ECCO HQ, Cosmic Timing Division*  
*Subject: Manifesting Synchronicities, Expecting the Unexpected, and Keeping Your Cool*

**Agents,**

HQ has noticed some recent “enthusiasm” (read: chaos) in your fieldwork. While we appreciate your dedication to spotting and sharing synchronicities, a few of you (*looking at you, Agent Smith*) need a refresher on the basics of manifestation, expectations, and—most importantly—not freaking out when the universe throws you a curveball.

Here’s a cosmic crash course to keep you on track:

# 1. How to Manifest Real-World Synchronicities Like a Pro

**Step 1: Let Go of Control.**  
Synchronicities aren’t microwavable. You don’t punch in 30 seconds and expect a piping hot coincidence. Instead, relax, trust the process, and let the universe do its thing. (Pro tip: The universe thrives on ambiguity and caffeine. Be both.)

**Step 2: Focus on Your Intentions.**  
Think about what you want to align with. Then forget about it entirely. That’s the secret sauce. The harder you try, the more likely you are to scare synchronicities into hiding. It’s like trying to catch a butterfly by chasing it—it’s funnier for the onlookers than for you.

**Step 3: Stay Open to Oddities.**  
Synchronicities don’t always announce themselves with neon lights and theme music. That receipt with a total of $11.11? That unexpected compliment about your oddly specific collection of duck-shaped salt shakers? That’s us. Pay attention.

# 2. Examples of Expecting the Unexpected

**Scenario 1: The Parking Spot Miracle**  
You’re running late, and the universe knows it. As you turn the corner, behold—a prime parking spot appears, just as someone pulls out. Coincidence? Hardly. Expect it, but don’t *expect it*. (And don’t gloat. Agent Karma is always watching.)

**Scenario 2: The “Right Place, Right Time” Classic**  
You bump into a stranger at the exact coffee shop where you lost your wallet last week. Turns out, they found it and were *just* about to drop it off at the police station. Congrats! This is peak synchronicity—unexpected, perfectly timed, and just a little uncanny.

**Scenario 3: The Cosmic Playlist**  
You’re thinking about a long-lost friend when a song you both loved starts playing. You shrug it off as a coincidence until your phone buzzes. Yep, it’s *them*. That’s ECCO’s version of *“sup?”* Expect it. It’s our favorite move.

# 3. Stay Calm, Agent. Always Stay Calm.

**The #1 Rule of ECCO Fieldwork:**  
When the universe starts showing off, don’t panic. It’s just trying to impress you. Examples of “situations” where staying calm is key:

* **You Think of Something and It Immediately Happens.** Remember: *You’re not psychic (probably).* This is just the universe saying, *“Gotcha!”* Take a deep breath, smile, and nod like you expected it all along.
* **Repeating Numbers Are Everywhere.** 11:11, 333, 42—whatever your cosmic jam is, seeing it everywhere isn’t a sign to panic. It’s ECCO’s way of reminding you we’re watching. (Yes, we also saw what you googled last night. No, we won’t judge… much.)
* **The Universe Aligns Too Perfectly.** When everything falls into place in a way that’s almost *too good*, don’t assume you’ve broken reality. You haven’t (yet). You’re just having a particularly on-brand ECCO moment. Stay calm, laugh, and maybe buy a lottery ticket.

# Final Notes From HQ

1. **Trust the Process.** Synchronicities work on their own time. (Yes, even if you’re impatient. No, asking “are we there yet?” doesn’t help.)
2. **Share the Fun.** The more you document your cosmic comedy, the more we get to laugh at… er, *with* you.
3. **Remember: Everything Is Connected.** Even that random piece of toast that looks like Jesus. It’s all part of the grand cosmic tapestry. Probably.

Now go forth, Agents, and manifest magnificently. Remember: the universe loves a good laugh, and so do we.

**Stay synchronized,**

Grab a crêpe from a street vendor – because, why not? – and let the Parisian atmosphere wash over you. In the evening, treat yourself to a traditional French dinner at a cozy bistro.

Enjoy strolling these less-trodden paths on your Paris France itinerary 10 days exploration!

### Day 10: Au Revoir, Paris!

Alas, all good things must come to an end. Depending on your flight schedule, spend your last morning revisiting your favorite spot, squeezing in some last-minute souvenir shopping, or simply enjoying a Parisian breakfast at a local café.

1hl35lc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1hl35lc/aita_for_calling_off_my_wedding_after_i_found_out/,AITA for Calling Off My Wedding After I Found Out My Fiancé Was Still Seeing His Ex Without Telling Me? ,"

I (F28) recently called off my wedding to my fiancé, Chris (M30), and I’m wondering if I’m being unreasonable.

Chris and I have been together for three years, and we got engaged six months ago. We’ve always had a strong relationship, or so I thought. We were getting along perfectly, and everything seemed set for our wedding in a few weeks. But then, I found something that made me question everything.

For a while, I’d been feeling like Chris was being a bit distant. He’d been working longer hours, not texting back as quickly, and seemed less interested in spending time with me. I didn’t want to overthink it, but it felt like something was off. I didn’t know if it was just stress from wedding planning or if I was just being insecure.

One evening, I had the feeling that something wasn’t right, so I asked him if there was anything he needed to tell me. He assured me everything was fine, but I didn’t feel convinced. I was feeling paranoid, so I ended up going through his phone while he was in the shower. I know, I shouldn’t have, but I just had this gut feeling.

What I found completely shocked me. There were messages between Chris and his ex-girlfriend, Lily (F27), that went back several months. It wasn’t just a one-time thing either. They’d been texting regularly, meeting up for coffee, and even sending each other pictures. The messages weren’t just casual either — there were conversations about their past relationship, them reminiscing about old times, and even some flirty comments. They had been hanging out without telling me, and Chris never mentioned it once.

I was stunned. I confronted him immediately. At first, he tried to deny it, saying it was nothing and that he and Lily were just “catching up” as friends. But when I pressed him, he admitted they’d met up a few times for coffee and that he didn’t think it would be an issue since they’d both moved on. He also said he didn’t want to “hurt” me by telling me, but clearly, keeping it a secret was worse.

I told him I couldn’t marry someone who was still seeing their ex and keeping it from me. I felt completely betrayed. To me, the fact that he was hiding these meetings and conversations from me was a huge red flag. I told him the wedding was off, and I needed time to figure out what to do next.

Now, Chris is devastated. He says I’m overreacting, that it was just innocent friendship, and that I’m being insecure. His friends and some of my family are saying I should have talked to him more instead of jumping to conclusions. They think I should have forgiven him and moved past it. But I just can’t get over the fact that he was hiding this from me, especially leading up to our wedding.

So, Reddit, AITA for calling off my wedding after I found out my fiancé was still meeting up with his ex without telling me?

(Note: The names in this post are all code names for privacy.)

Update: I called him today and we talk something's over I decided to give him a secoubd chance as long as he blocks his ex and stops having contact with her. Just to clarify there is no child involved so he has no reason to have contact with her.we have decided to postpone the wedding till we get back on track and get our relationship figured out. He truly seems sorry and this is the guy I have always imagined marrying. I have a gut feeling this is a mistake but will keep you updated

Update: sorry for the quick updates but he came over about 30 minutes ago to talk things over. He showed me how he had blocked her on everything. But a text pops up with a new name ( Clara) and she says ""just changed my number will this work"" I am speechless and can't believe this just happened.I knew I shouldn't give him a secoubd chance and we are over now. I am both upset and feel betrayed that I was willing to give him a secoud. Chance he he dies this to me.i am also just confused.She really changed her number to help a guy cheat with her.

a bit about me: i’m a fitness enthusiast who loves spending time at the gym, pushing myself and celebrating the feeling of strength and health. my two adorable dogs, poco and loco, keep my life full of love and joy. they’re my partners in crime for lazy afternoons and long walks through madrid’s beautiful parks. when i’m not out and about, i’m a big movie lover—there’s nothing like getting lost in a great story or discovering a hidden gem.

i also enjoy writing and reflecting on life, always looking to connect on a deeper level. i believe that the best conversations are the ones that take unexpected turns, where we share our dreams, challenges, and even those silly little thoughts that pop into our heads. whether we’re talking about your favorite movies, swapping fitness tips, or imagining new adventures, i’d love to hear what makes your heart beat a little faster.

and if you enjoy simple joys like fresh air, the sound of rain, or a warm cup of coffee on a cool morning, we might just get along perfectly. so, whether you’re nearby or across the world, let’s connect! i’d love to know what inspires you, what makes you laugh, and what makes your day just a little brighter.

When I asked my psychiatrist recently what was next she said I'd tried everything. This isn't quite accurate, but I understand what she's saying: I've tried all the categories. So my question: have any of you tried, Adderall, Vyvanse, Ritalin, Strattera, Qelbree, and Modafinil without benefit, and then found another drug that worked for them? 

The only one of these that had any effect on me at all was Strattera, which I had to quit after three days from abdominal pain/cramping/something. The rest might as well have been chalk.

I already take bupropion and lamotrigine and they've never had an impact on my ADHD symptoms.

I have started drinking coffee medicinally, but 32oz does nothing, so I'm going to start adding liquid caffeine drops to find my threshold.

- 1.2X Overtime Pay. 

- Working Monday - Friday, 12 AM to 6 AM. 


**How to Apply**

*We are excited you have decided to pursue a career with Fazbear Entertainment! To apply please submit a resume or covering letter to Restaurant Manager: Henry Smith via this email ******@*****.com* 


————————————————————————



H: “Hello, this is Henryk Smith the lead manager for Freddy Fazbears Pizza, please respond to this message if you’re still interested in the position of Security Guard and to confirm that this is, Michael Schmidt.”



M: “Hello Mr. Smith, I am willing to continue with the application process for this position. I have a few questions concerning the benefits package.”



H: “Haha, wow, okay, hard luck finding a better career path? Anyways, that is excellent to hear. And yes, let’s get any burning questions you have out of the way first”


M: “Well, for starters, I was just wondering what sort of benefits Fazbear Entertainment will be providing, the ad I found online was quite vague in that regard.”


H: “Heh, well, hope not to disappoint you, but the only real perk of the job is the free coffee, sugar, and cream I leave in the lounge every morning before your shift starts I’m afraid. This is a dead end job, and nowhere for you to go up in the ‘company’ either. I hope that isn’t too much of a deal breaker.”


M: “No, that is perfectly fine. As you said before, I’ll take what I can get. What date would you like me to start?”


H: “Well, the previous guard is wrapping up his 2 week notice next week. So how about we have you start on Monday, August 11th? That work for you?”


M: “Yes, that works out for me. Although, is there any reason the other guy threw in the towel?”


H: “Perfect. And not too sure on that one. Best guess I hazard is that he was already looking for something better or wanted to follow his dreams and jumped ship the moment it came.”


M: “Right, and about the provided training?”


H: “Oh, yeah, come to work a little earlier on your first day, think 10:30 PM. We got some training tapes, head to the lounge and plug in that old VCR and feel free to take notes. But the job really isn’t that challenging. Just keep your eyes on the monitor. Make sure everything is accounted for. Chase off any random drugged out homeless people that get the wrong idea. And follow the instructions provided with the animatronics. You can’t go wrong. On the job, I’ll be sending some old prerecorded messages on that old phone, make sure to listen in on them when they come. Just policy all things considered. They should only be for the first 4 days on the job, by then I’d hope you have the basics understood.” 


M: “Yeah I can do that, though I’m sort of new in the area, recently relocated from Detroit. Do you mind sending the address before the start date?”


H: “Naturally. I’ll probably get back to you in a few business days with that information. Fair warning though if you want to scout out your new work environment. The place is a fucking wreck, hasn’t been used in a little over a decade now. They all wanted to tear the place down and build some sort of memorial or shelter where it stood. But, well, I can’t just throw this old place away just yet……”


H: “Well, it seems you’re practically ready to hop on to Freddy’s stage. I’ll send you some paperwork via email and you can send that back to me and we’ll talk more in a few days.”

I’ve been working at Chick Fil A in Canada for the last couple years and recently quit. When I visited the US last year, I saw some differences I wanted to point out.

**Menu:**

Number 1, 2, 3
* CFA Sandwich, Deluxe, and Nuggets

Number 4, 5, 6
* Spicy Chicken, Spicy Deluxe, Spicy Strips

Number 7, 8, 9
* Grilled Chicken, Grilled Club, Grilled Nuggets

Salads:
* Cobb and Spicy Southwest.

**Key Differences:**

* All Canadian locations serve ONLY Spicy Strips.
* No Market Salad
* No Mac and Cheese (still… Most asked item by customers!!)
* No Breakfast
* No Brownie
* No Hot Coffee or Tea (they will bring it back when they eventually start breakfast)
* No Wraps
* No Kale Salad, Fruit cups, etc
* No Chocolate milk or Toys for kids.
* No Mobile app. You can only mobile order through the website.

Only 3 Salad Dressings.
* Avocado Lime Ranch, Creamy Salsa, and Light Balsamic. (We did have the original 7, but was changed at the beginning of the year)

Fountain Drinks:
* Coke, Diet Coke, Coke Zero, Cherry Coke, Sprite, Canada Dry, Root Beer, Frutopia (Canadian HiC)

Controversial: American Sweet Tea vs Canadian Iced Tea? Most customers when they ask for iced tea, expect Nestea. It’s similar to Brisk but wayyy better. I know many Canadians HATE sweet tea. So whenever someone orders iced tea, we’ve been told to always let them know it’s “American Sweet Tea” to prevent this. Since many Canadians also haven’t tried Chick Fil A and ask what Sweet Tea is, I usually tell them “it’s cold black tea with sugar.” It’s grown on me, but I’m still Team Nestea (RIP).

My managers have said the Mac and Cheese, and Breakfast will launch in Canada in Late 2025 (luckily I’ve tried both!) However, this hasn’t been confirmed yet.

I played it from my YouTube music account and started off with Love Is a Long Road by Tom Petty. It went on from there playing Danger Zone from Top Gun, Old Time Rock and Roll by Bob Seger, Little Lies by Fleetwood Mac, and Hotel California by the Eagles. I think 8 songs were played in total and I remember the number because I created a playlist of those songs a couple days later that’s been over 90 days deleted. 

Two songs I can’t remember, but one song I remember:
-had a yellow album cover with black shapes on it
-after looking into the song, I believe came out in the late 2010s, specifically 2018 or 2019?
-was definitely a rock song, almost bluesy
-I want to say the name was something along the lines of Jack/Ryan Johnson/Jackson? Not the guy who wrote Better Together/Banana Pancakes (great songs)
-it’s not the Jack White album that came out around then. ChatGPT suggested that album but it didn’t seem like it was a particularly well known artist

Velvet Chocolate - oh man, not it lol. I know a lot of people like this and I really thought I would too but this is so synthetic and almost plasticky. It definitely has that Hershey’s hot cocoa powder scent but there is something lying under it that’s off-putting to me. I have the coffee scent from this brand and love that. 



Be My Cookie - holyyyyyyy shitttttt literally. It’s like an animal took a dump on some cookie dough. Like singeing the nose hairs level. Super chemically. Not for me at all. 



Jany - ummm this is straight up a Christmas Yankee Candle. I definitely get the baking apples vibes but overall I don’t get the hype. 



Wavechild - pleasant watermelon. Very light, seems good for warm weather but doesn’t warrant the hype or the price tag. I feel like one could find a similar scent in a much lower price point.

*No answer…*

“Marie?”

*Vo started to get a feeling she couldn't describe… all she knew however was that the lack of an answer might have caused it.*

*She went to the sleeping quarters, only to find Marie sitting on the bed- with two wires coming out of her ear. Vo felt the feeling from earlier lift off from her… seeing Marie safe was all she needed to see, she was also curious to see what she was doing with those wires coming out of her ears.*

“Im back”

“Oh!- sorry I didn't hear you earlier…” *Marie desperately trying to apologize to Vo.*

“What are you doing anyway? What is the purpose of those wires going into your ear? Why are they connected to this device?” 

*Vo was curious about what Marie was doing, the wires and the small device they were connected to, its screen showing what seemed to be a young girl amongst a sea of white, grey, and black flame.*

“Oh, I'm just listening to some music.” Marie replied with a smile

“Music, what for?”

“I just felt like taking a break from my work, that's all. The song that I'm currently listening to is one of my all time favorites. You wanna listen for a bit?”

*Marie handed over one of the ear buds to Vo, she had a curious look on her face. She’s heard it from soldiers singing, but she’d never gone out of her way to listen to music…*

“Sure” as Vo put the ear bud into her audio sensor.

“Oh, yeah, the song is in Japanese. I can understand it thankfully because of my mother who was and was one of the few native speakers still around at the time. I'm not that fluent in the language though, I'm just glad I was able to inherit it. Anyways, this song is about loss, memories, and the passage of time. Despite its dreamy atmosphere, the lyrics are pretty somber-”

*As Marie continued to talk about the song, the feeling from before came bearing down on Vo…*


*It was much more intense this time… Fear? A world without Marie was too much to bear for Vo, just the thought of losing Marie hit Vo like a bullet to the head…*


*Vo, out of instinct, held onto Marie, like a child holding onto her stuffed toy. Her face, almost looking like it was going to tear up.*


“As long as you live, I won't die, don't worry.”


*Marie hugged Vo, comforting her to the best of her ability.*


“For an emotionless combat android though, you are a pretty big crybaby.” *Marie jokingly tried to brighten the mood while softly smiling.*


*Vo, however, couldn't understand what Marie meant by all of that, but Maries smile was just enough to break Vo’s fear- her face growing into a faint smile as well. Vo promised to herself that she would protect herself and Marie…*


“Why don't we just lay here for a bit then. Just you and me.” *Marie laid herself on the bed, Vo following too.*


*Marie wrapped her arms around Vo in bed and soon fell asleep, Vo just watching her, running her robotic hand through Maries soft, messy white hair…*


“I promise, I won't let you die…” 


*Vo drifted off to, listening to the rest of the song and into her own dreams, in which herself and Marie were dealt a kinder hand.*

This is the worst flare up I've had since the possibility of IC was mentioned by a nurse that saw me in UroGynecology (didn't run other tests but blood and urine, it this routine?). Had a big 6 months flare up then went away and came back ocacionally with minor symptoms, manageable with paracetamol and avoiding coffee/alcohol.

Right now, I can't even walk without pain, it is stopping me from doing all my activities at this point. I got a referral to urologist in 2 weeks.

Not sure what to do about the pain until then. Any thoughts?

1hl2akj,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindPowder/comments/1hl2akj/i_took_mind_powders_instead_of_coffee_for_a/,I Took Mind Powders Instead of Coffee for a Week—Ask Me Anything!,"It has always been my ritual, richly aromatic and a jolting energy boost; hard to beat. Still, when mind powders came around, natural alternatives for caffeine, I decided I was game. Really, can this mishmash of blends housing adaptogens and nootropics pull their weight against my old favorite? Here's what went down when I hung up my morning brew and made mind powders a try for an entire week:

What Are Mind Powders?

Mind powders are nutritional-dense blends designed to support cognitive function and mental clarity. They usually include ingredients like Lion's Mane mushroom for focus, ashwagandha to combat stress, and L-theanine for calm energy. Unlike coffee, which uses caffeine to give you an instant kick, mind powders intend to fuel your brain more holistically, without a crash.

How Did I Use Them?

Every morning, I mixed one serving of mind powder into water or a smoothie. The taste? Earthy with a hint of sweetness, and for sure less bitter than coffee. I turned this into a ritual and followed it for one week.

Did It Work?

But by day two, I did find the difference. Instead of that wired buzzing I often feel when ingesting coffee, I'd have a calm focus on steady. The stuff that usually overwhelmed me became plausible, and I found focusing on longer lengths didn't make me as distractible. My energy seemed stable throughout the day with no afternoon slump I so regularly encountered when my caffeine high crashed after a while.

Was Giving Up Coffee Hard for You?

I thought I was going to miss the instant kick of coffee, but it wasn't as grueling as I anticipated. Mind powders are more about slower, sustained boosts, so I didn't have that same desperation to refuel. By the end of the week, I realized I wasn't craving coffee like I used to.

The Verdict

Mind powders didn't replace my coffee; they gave me something better: consistent energy, sharper focus, and no crash. While I will not be giving it up cold turkey anytime soon-I rove the taste!-mind powders will stay in my routine, especially for when days need me to be sharp and productive without piling on caffeine.

If you’re curious about trying mind powders, my advice is simple: give them a shot. They might just become your new favorite way to fuel your brain!

Im an only child and this was the first time in my life where I genuinely felt like I had a sister. We started studying together a lot, I was struggling in school and she hired tutors for me. She would uplift me when i had a couple breakdowns, encourage me, scold me when I was too lazy to study lol, make me lunch at times, bring me coffee, check up on me daily etc. She was super smart and I adored the hell out of her.  She genuinely treated me like a real sister to the point where I guess I got emotionally attached to our friendship. Basically, about two weeks ago the semester ended and she flew back to her hometown in Canada for winter break. I also got the email that I failed out of optometry school( which sucked but I had a feeling it was going to happen) She would still call me everyday and help me figure out backup options and other graduate programs. Like we would be on the phone for over an hour trying to figure out my life. Im not sure what happened all of a sudden but its been three days now and she hasn't contacted me. I texted her yesterday and she responded with like a one word answer and barely said anything. I sent her snapchats and she's opened them but didn't respond. I don't know what happened, or if I said anything to upset her which I dont think I did. This fucking hurts especially when I was used to her calling and texting me daily. But then again I try telling myself that she's not my mom nor does she have any responsibility over me for her to text me on a daily basis. Maybe its because I failed out of school so she thinks theres no point in keeping in contact with me anymore? How do I get over this?

1hl239x,https://www.reddit.com/r/doihavebreastcancer/comments/1hl239x/excisional_biopsy_surgery_experience/,Excisional Biopsy Surgery Experience,"I had my procedure done today. I’ll do my best to describe the entire thing. This was my first surgery so I had zero idea what to expect.
I got there early to have the magnet inserted. That procedure was similar to, but not as intense as the biopsy. Lasted much less time and wasn’t as scary. They numbed me and then put in the little magnet that helps guide the surgery.
From there I went to the pre-op procedure.
Had to undress totally and put on the gown. Urine sample & blood pressure (which of course was super high) take . Got heated blankets to lay under and had the IV put in. My husband was in the room with me.
I told the nurse I was very afraid of throwing up and she told me not to worry at all, they would give me all the things to prevent that. I got a little patch behind my ear to help with nausea as well as the iv meds.
She gave me something to make me feel relaxed after the surgeon came in & talked about the procedure: about an hour long, she was goi g to remove the papilloma and surrounding tissue. Results expected 3-5 days. She said if there’s malignancy, we’ll go from there but NOT to worry. The radiologist who inserted the magnet told me that papillomas are usually not upgraded in his experience(my first biopsy was benign).
After the relaxation drug, I felt a little buzzed and nice. They wheeled me into the OR and from there I remember very little. I was put before the surgeon even came in I think. I was woken gently and didn’t feel dizzy or nauseous. They gave me some sprite and saltines though. 
Went back to the little prep room & got dressed. I actually don’t remember how I got my shoes on now that I think of it. 
Home and fell asleep to a movie. Woke up and had some sparkling water & bread and butter. I have a slight headache but that’s probably due to no coffee or food today.
I have a compression bra and ace bandage. Will be able to shower Christmas. So far no pain, but I’ll take a pain med before bed. They also gave me a nerve blocker that’s supposed to last 48 hours, so hopefully that keeps pain down.
All in all it wasn’t a bad experience. Looking forward to starting 2025 with this all behind me.
Feel free to ask anything about this procedure & prayers to everyone waiting. ❤️",10,1735002000.0,doihavebreastcancer,7,1.0,False
1hl22tm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sasquatch_Nazi/comments/1hl22tm/deeply_disturbing_sasquatch_encounter_the_story/,DEEPLY DISTURBING SASQUATCH ENCOUNTER: The Story of Ellen and Oscar ,"This report came in last weekend from a gentleman named “Oscar”. Oscar was on a date with a lady named “Ellen”. As the evening grew late the couple decided to drive to a state park, park their car, and then engage in intimate behavior while sitting in the car. 

Oscar said they arrived at the park at around 10:30 pm. They drove into the park on a dirt road. The area is heavily wooded. When they came to a wide spot in the road they pulled over, turned off the headlights, and then started talking. 

I am going to assume that you good readers are mature adults and just cut to the chase. After some small talk Ellen began performing oral sex on Oscar as they sat together in the front seat. “Kashmir” by Led Zeppelin was playing on the radio. Shortly after this began something hit the hood of Oscar’s car. It startled the couple. There was nobody around they knew about. Finally, they just assumed it was a broken limb falling out of the trees around them. So they returned to what they were doing. 

After a few moments more, something hit the roof of the car. This time whatever hit the car was much heavier and made quite a noise upon impact. Oscar quickly composed himself, jumped out of the car and shouted “Who’s there?!?” He yelled some other threatening messages, assuming it was somebody out there messing with him and Ellen. He said he had a loaded gun. In reality, he did not. 

Oscar was just about to get back into the car and go somewhere else when he heard a limb break. It was a loud “snap”, and it was very close. Oscar jerked his head toward the noise and nervously asked again who was there. Nothing. It was quiet. Then came a low yet menacing growl that enveloped the entirety of the forest around them. It started low then grew in intensity. Oscar said he could feel the growl in his chest. At this point Ellen was begging him to get back into the car and leave. Oscar obliged, jumping back into the driver’s seat and hastily putting his car into reverse and hitting the gas. 

Oscar was intending to back the car around so it would point back in the direction from which they entered, then getting the heck out of there. But while they were rapidly reversing the car hit something solid and stopped with a loud “BAM!” Oscar was perplexed, as he knew there should not be a tree behind him. Then something crashed down on the trunk of his car, hard, causing them both to scream in fear. 

Looking in his rear view mirror, and with only the light from his taillights, he saw a big hairy mass of something behind the car. Oscar stared in horror while Ellen had gone into hysterics. Before Oscar could even think to put the car into drive and get away, he saw ... the ARMS.

They were huge and covered in mangy hair. They reached down under the car. The thing was so big Oscar could not see the face. Then the back end of the car lifted up, and off the ground. Oscar says that the thing must have lifted the back end of the car at least two feet off the ground. Then came a loud roar from the thing. It was throaty and gutteral, and very loud. Oscar said it felt like his insides were rattling from the noise it was so loud. It was an angry growl that assaulted the sanity of both Oscar and Ellen. By this point both of them were in hysterics and screaming. 

But as fast as this horrific moment came, it was gone. The very moment the growl ended, the car was dropped with a hard bang that jolted them both. Then all was quiet. Oscar looked in the rear view mirror. Nothing was there. Ellen turned in her seat to look out the back window, then quickly directed Oscar to “Go, go, go, go, go!!” 

Oscar hit the gas and completed the rearward turn he initially intended to make. He then put the car into drive and hit the gas. He spun the tires as the car started moving forward. Oscar sped down the little dirt road as fast as he dared. Once they got to the paved road Ellen was crying and asking what was that thing. Oscar was quiet, still in shock. They made it home without further incident. 

Both Oscar and Ellen have been traumatized by this incident, burdened with nightmares and continuing anxiety. They told nobody about what happened to them lest they be thought of as crazy, or liars. After a week of this, Ellen decided to reach out to someone. She felt like she needed answers if she was ever going to come to grips with this. That’s when she contacted BADASS: Bigfoot And Dogman Assassination And Strategic Strikeforce. She had heard about this band of Sasquatch operators from a source who will remain unnamed. 

The call came in approximately one week after the event. I was having a Dewers on the rocks at a titty bar in Atlanta when my phone rang. Of course, I did not hear it because of the loud music on the sound system. But, I felt it because I had it set to vibrate. I pulled it out and set the vibrating iPhone high on the thigh of the cute, young blond stripper sitting on my lap. “You like that, honey?”, I asked her. Then I moved it higher and higher, and squeezed her tight just as I started kissing her neck. 

After the fascist, and very large bouncers, threw me out into the parking lot, I picked myself up and found my truck. By this point, after the scuffle and all the bad noise and threats, I had forgotten to even look to see who had the fucking balls to be calling me on a Saturday night. 

I was way too inebriated to drive, so I threw in a CCR CD, rolled down my window to let in the cool night air, and took off like a bat out of hell. You see, if you try to drive carefully when drunk, the cops can pick up on that. So what I do after I have been drinking is to drive fast and all over the road. That way the cops know I am not trying to fool anybody and assume I am just a sober asshole. It works most of the time. 

I could not find my way home that night. I apparently blacked out at some point then came to in my truck. I was parked in front of a seedy little gas station in the hood, it was 8:00 am, and I was surrounded by Mexicans looking for work. I had no idea how I got there. By now I was sober enough to find my way home. Once there I crashed in bed and slept the rest of the day away. 

The following day I woke up at the crack of noon. After a little of the old “hair of the dog”, I decided to check my Bigfoot hotline. There it was. I had missed a phone call. But, there was a voice mail. It turned out to be a message from Ellen saying she and her boyfriend had a terrifying encounter with a large, hairy creature. She was all shook up about it. I arranged to meet her and Oscar the next morning for breakfast to discuss the matter. 

Ellen was already at the diner when I arrived. She was a right attractive young lass. She had a pretty, sincere face, blond hair cut into a bob, and a nice shape. It turns out that she is a 33 yr old MILF who was recently divorced. She also wears a false left leg. She explained that she is a vet who was medically retired after her leg got blown off in Afghanistan by a roadside IED. 

Oscar came lagging in about 20 minutes late. He was apparently the first guy she had been out with since her divorce. He was a real douchebag: one of those millennial hipster types with groomed facial hair and skinny leg jeans. 

We ordered before we began talking about the Sasquatch encounter. Ellen had eggs (scrambled), toast, and hot tea. I had only a black coffee, flavored by the contents of my Bass Pro Shop flask. Oscar ordered plant-based sausage on top of a toasted bagel, and a latte. “Jesus Christ”, I thought to myself. 

Ellen began telling me the story. She was very engaged and genuinely curious about what happened. But she was also still quite disturbed by the event. Oscar sulked and was clearly agitated. He was really bringing down my investigation, so I looked at him and said “Look, dude, if you don’t want to be here then pick up your ass and fuck off.” 

Oscar then got a chip on his shoulder. He shot up to his feet and started getting all up in my space and pretending to be a tough guy. I said to Ellen, “excuse me a minute, sweatheart”, then stood up to face Oscar. I looked him in the eye and asked “What the fuck is wrong with you, boy? I am here to help, but you are acting like a total snot-faced cunt.” 

Oscar then went on about the creature most likely being a bear, and it was no big deal. He said he did not believe in Bigfoot. Then he maligned my profession. Ellen tried to calm him, but he was inconsolable. Clearly, the encounter had him messed up in the head. He was faced with something that is not supposed to exist. Now his world had been fundamentally altered. He did not know how to deal with it. He did not possess the coping skills needed for this particular situation. So I decided to take pity on the boy and do him a favor. 

Before Oscar even realized what had happened, I violently punched the sumbitch hard right in his throat. The sad sack dropped like a sack of potatoes, lying on the greasy diner floor, grasping his throat and struggling for breath. I told Ellen, “let’s go...I want you to show me where this encounter occurred.” I dropped a $50.00 bill on the table, took Ellen by her hand, and we left Oscar writhing around on the floor. 

We took my truck. I consoled her on the drive. I said, “Look, sweetheart, I know things are tough for you right now. You are coming out of a divorce and now you are starting over as a single mom with one income. But that guy Oscar is not for you.” She started crying as she said “I know, I know. He was so bad to me.” After some more talking I learned that Ellen grew up with a sister and a brother, all being raised solely by Ellen’s mother. Her father left when Ellen was very young.  Her mom had a parade of men in her life, partly to party with and partly for the financial support she could extract from them. In fact, Ellen had a hard childhood and it obviously impacted her emotionally with trust and daddy issues. “Jackpot!!”, I thought to myself. 

We arrived at the encounter site. The tire tracks were still there. I also found a Sasquatch print in some soft dirt. It was 18’’ long, a real big beast. Searching the area further I discover 2 tree structures and a pile of bones that appeared to be from hogs (feral, of course). It appears that old Oscar parked his car right in the middle of a Bigfoot’s living room. What an asshole. 

I took some photographs and made some notes. Then we headed out of there. I told Ellen that I was 99% sure they stumbled into a Bigfoot’s territory and that it acted aggressively because it wanted them out of there.  I pointed out that the creature could have easily killed both of them but chose not too. It just wanted them out of there. This seemed to provide her with some degree of comfort. 

I asked Ellen if she would like to come back out there with me that night. At first, she was dead set against it. But I blew a lot of hot smoke up her ass about her being a tough-as-nails retired soldier and about how the Sasquatch did not want to hurt anyone, it just wanted to be left alone. I also told her that I do this sort of thing all the time, plus the BADASS Team would be with us. Then I hit her with this being a good way for her to face her fear, acquire some closure and be able to move forward with her life rather than living with the trauma of that night. She smiled, then agreed to come along. 

When we parted Ellen gave me a hug and a quick peck on the cheek. The plan was for me to assemble my crew and meet back up with Ellen at the dirt road pull-off on the main highway where you enter the state park at 8:00 pm tonight. 

My crew was all on site at 7:30 pm that night and preparing for the operation. I had my 5 best boys with me. There was Tango, a recently paroled black dude who joined up with BADASS after the New Black Panthers kicked him out for being too crazy for them. Tango was my second in command, and would be on point for tonight’s op. 

Then there was Napalm Ned, a Vietnam vet. He was going to be our communications coordinator. The next three were snipers. There was Bobby Big Dick, Stab Wound, and Tommy Two Sacks. Here was the plan. I wanted to recreate the situation Ellen and Oscar found themselves in the night of the attack. Not wanting to get my truck fucked up by a Sasquatch, I borrowed my neighbor’s Mustang. Ellen and I would enter the woods in the Mustang at exactly 11:00 pm., proceed to the make out spot, and wait. Coordinates were given to the 3 snipers. They would be inserted early and triangulate around my position high in the trees. Ned would communicate between everyone. Tango would be the field General tonight while I was being the bait, along with Ellen. 

Ellen arrived at 8:00 pm sharp. Good girl! I explained the plan to her. However, I quickly learned that we had a problem. Ellen does not like the idea of killing the Bigfoot. In fact, she hated the killing of all animals. She was a fucking pantheist! Pretty stupid, I know. 

I managed to calm her down by telling her that all our guns were loaded with sedative darts that will not hurt the creature. We just want to chill it out, get some photos and DNA, give it a health checkup, immunize it, and tag it with a GPS tracking device. It was a tricky sales job because the bitch is a hardcore animal rights person, and because Tango and Ned kept giggling the more I said. But finally I had her convinced that we were really a scientific group trying to help the Sasquatch. 

Pursuant to the plan, Ellen and I got into the mustang and began driving into the woods along the same dirt path used by her and Oscar. Ellen asked what kind of gun was I carrying in my shoulder rig. I told her it was my Ruger .480 revolver...loaded with 300 grain Vicodin tipped bullets. She grinned, touched my shoulder, and said “You’re so great, Bud. You are a really good guy.” She did not have a fucking clue about anything. 

When we reached our spot I parked and checked in with old Napalm Ned on my headset. We left the car running, just like Oscar had done. We also lowered our windows so we could hear what was going on around us. But frankly, my neighbor’s souped up, straight-piped hot rod Stang made listening impossible, so I killed the engine. Wanting some noise to let the Sasquatch know we were there, I turned on the radio. 

We sat there for a long time. Nothing happened. Our tree snipers saw and heard nothing. Tango was stationed in a ground blind on the perimeter. He heard and saw nothing. “Shit!”, I thought. Then I looked over at Ellen and asked her exactly what she and Oscar were doing at the time of the encounter. She hesitated and gave me a bullshit, nothing of an answer. I asked her again. Then I noticed her face in the lights emanating from the stereo. It looked like she was blushing. Then it dawned on me. I asked her “You two were fucking?”

Ellen was embarrassed and said “Oh, no! No, no, no. We were just making out and fooling around a little.” I said “Look, this is serious business here. We are not playing around with fucking Fozzy Bear. This Sasquatch will rip our heads off. Now, tell me exactly what you two were doing.” Ellen had a pained look on her face. I asked “Did you have Oscar’s dick in your mouth?” Her facial expression and sudden eye aversion told me that she did. Then I said, “OK, so you were blowing Oscar. So when the first rock or whatever hit Oscar’s car, you were going down on him?” Ellen sheepishly nodded her head. 

I nodded once to myself and said “Alright, we know what we have to do”, then leaned back in my seat and pulled out my cock. I said “Ok, get to work, honey”. At first Ellen said she was leaving and went for the door. I admonished her to “sit your fucking ass down, woman. If you go out there that damn Bigfoot is going to rip off your pretty little head and shit Sasquatch turds down your neck hole.” Knowing that I was right, Ellen got back into her seat and shut the door. 

I said, “Look, you did it for Oscar and he is a total cuck-donkey. Just look at my cock here, all thick and veiny. You know you want to wrap your thick, blow-job lips around it and swallow it up. Plus, it needs to be done for the mission.” Ellen thought about it as she looked at my hardening dick in my hand. Then to solidify the deal I said “Sweetheart, I know you don’t want to see the Sasquatch People go extinct, but that is exactly what’s going to happen if we cannot get some hard data on them and study the species. I mean, what’s a few minutes of having a dick in your mouth compared to wiping out an entire species?” 

That was all it took. Ellen started licking and slurping all over my knob. Then she suddenly stopped, looked up at me, and asked if the rest of the BADASS Team was privy to this. I said “of course not”, then pushed her head back down on my salami. In my earpiece I could hear my spec op buddies laughing their asses off. 

After about 5 minutes of very motivated cocksucking and licking, a rock hit the hood of the car. Ellen popped up and excitedly said “Oh my God! It’s here!!” I pushed her head back down on my shaft and said “Alright, hurry it up, sweetheart. I got to go to work.” 

Just as I released my demon seed down Ellen’s throat, what sounded like a fucking boulder hit the roof of the car. I radioed the boys, “Ok, boys. It’s here. Get ready.” But before they could squeeze off a shot, the passenger door was violently and suddenly ripped off its hinges and tossed into the night. Then a big - and I mean BIG - hairy arm reached into the car, grabbed Ellen, and yanked her out in a flash. 

I heard chatter in my earpiece. The boys were having a hard time getting the monster in their crosshairs. We had assumed the snipers could pick it off on the perimeter as it held back and threw rocks at the car. But this animal proved to be unpredictable and aggressively moved right in to us, unseen by the snipers above. Apparently, Ellen and Oscar had really pissed This his thing off and it was not going to stand for any more trespassers. 

“Fuck it”, I said to myself. I radioed the boys and told them to hold their fire. I was going into the Kill Box to get this Bigfoot, and whatever was left of Ellen. I pulled out both my Desert Eagles chambered in .50 AE, and went after the beast, dual wielding my pieces. 

It did not take long to find the Sasquatch. It took Ellen off about 100 yards from the car, ripped her clothes off, sat her on a large rock, and now stood in front of her with a HUGE erection. Knowing that I needed to act quickly and decisively, I fired with my right hand. “BAM!!!!!” The report of the .50 AE in the dead of night was defeating. But the bullet hit it’s mark, right at the base of the monster’s engorged wiener. It fact, my bullet splayed it’s hard cock wide open. It looked like a hot dog that had been microwaved for too long!! 

Clearly, my shot hurt the Bigfoot, but it also made it mad - REAL MAD! I took off running right at the beast while dual wielding and blasting it with my Deagles. It absorbed every hit. When I ran dry the squatch was down on one knee and clutching its chest where my bullets hit it. At this point I was standing about 5 feet away from the monster, between it and a very terrified Ellen. 

Standing so close to the Bigfoot I noticed a couple of very alarming things. First, the beast’s dick was bigger than mine. Not by much, mind you. But just enough to be irritating to me. Second, even with the beast hunched over and on one knee, Tebow style, it was still a foot taller than me. I am 6’1” tall, which means that this was one magnum-sized Bigfoot. 

My alarm at the size of the fucker caused me a second of delay. I could tell by the chatter in my earpiece that the boys had climbed down from the trees and were, along with Ned and Tango, hauling ass to my location, locked and loaded. But I could not wait for them, as suddenly the beast pulled itself together, looked up and me, and showed its teeth. Now I was going to have to fight it bare-handed! 

In a split second epiphany I recalled Ellen and her false leg. As the Bigfoot slowly rose to its feet before me with a murderous lust in its eyes, I spun around and punched Ellen right in her fucking face. She toppled over unconscious. Then I grabbed her fake leg and ripped it off her (I struck her only because I did not have time to negotiate with her for the leg.  It was in her interest that I did this.). 

I immediately swung the leg and hit the monster upside its head, knocking the shit out of him. Then, with the foot end I slammed the beast repeatedly in its balls. The critter bent double then fell to the ground, letting out a painful cry of agony. Just then the boys arrived, and with a point-blank shot to its head from a .50 BMG the fight was over quicker than it had began. 

“Shit, man, that was a close call tonight!”, I said, we all agreed, then fist bumped a few times and talked some shit. Then Tango got out his chain saw and cut up the Bigfoot body so we could pack it out of there. After about half an hour we were ready to move out. Then Big Dick looked at me and asked “Hey, Bud, what you want to do about the bitch?” I said “Oh shit”. I had completely forgotten about her. 

I walked over to Ellen and shined my light on her. She was in shock, all curled up in the fetal position, shivering, and unresponsive. I walked back over to the boys and said to Big Dick, “Shit, dude, use one of your throwaway pistols and Epstein her.” The boys high fived. Tango and I started our hike out of there. After like 30 minutes we finally heard a gunshot. Tango said “It sure took ‘em a long time to end it. Do you think they fucked her first?” I looked over at Tango and asked “Fucked who?” We laughed and fist bumped. ",1,1735001959.0,Sasquatch_Nazi,0,1.0,False

Not shown: a rotisserie chicken from Costco.  Leftovers from whatever I don't eat at lunch tomorrow will go into Photo 1.

Photo 1:  52 oz of frozen vegetables (12 each of okra, cauliflower, cut green beans, and 16 of sliced carrots) roasted at 375 for a hour with about a half cup of olive oil.  Added a covering of pasta sauce and some crumbled feta at the 35 minute mark, then some leftover cheddar/Mexican shredded cheese for the last ten minutes.  Makes a little over six 8oz portions (one was my dinner, not pictured).  They are in the refrigerator now, tomorrow I will add leftovers from the rotisserie chicken I bought and freeze.

Photo 2:  I have a butcher about 45 minutes away who sells locally raised North Carolina beef.  I bought two one-pound vacuum packed bags of 80/20 ground beef.  Sauteed them for 15 minutes, draining the liquid into the coffee cup at the halfway point.  Spices with 2 frozen crushed cubes of garlic and a liberal amount of TJ's 21 Century, salt, pepper, paprika. Ended up with 22 oz of meat and about 6 oz. of drippings.  I will let this cool in the refrigerator overnight and tomorrow I will separate it into five vacuum-sealed bags to add to rice, pasta, tacos, etc, and freeze.

Photo 3:  Coarsely diced a 10 oz onion and sauteed it in 2 tbsp of olive oil.  Added 1/3 of the beef droppings along with 8 oz. of frozen diced green/yellow/red peppers.  Cooked that for a while, added the rest of the drippings and two 13.4 boxes of Whole Foods' no-salt-added black beans and two of kidney beans.  So 70oz gross total before cooking.  They are still on the stove on low heat, I will let them cool and refrigerate, and tomorrow I will put them into six portions and freeze all but one in disposable plastic soup containers.

Also not shown: Dove chocolate pudding mix with whole milk, four portions for afternoon snacks with overripe bananas.

Total output: 17 meal components, so roughly the equivalent of 8 meals.  Plus pudding.

Cost:  Vegetables in photo 1 were less than $10, ground beef was $16.  Figure $3 at most for the onion, the sliced peppers, the cheeses, and the olive oil.  $3 for the milk and pudding mix.  So $34 all in.",3,1735001715.0,MealPrepSunday,0,1.0,False

One of our regular weekly items that we get is a gallon jug of distilled water. They only had the giant jugs that had taps attached so she got one of those. Mom had been talking with either one of the employees or another shopper about it, and they mentioned using it for their coffee. Mom then told them that she gives it to the cat. This random dude that was walking by remarks ""Give them tap water! It won't hurt them!""

Mom: ""Actually it will hurt him, he's got bladder stones, so it's either distilled water or a $2000 surgery.""

I normally don’t go back, because it’s not my home anymore. Initially my flight was the week before Xmas, and I had planned to stay till maybe two weeks into January to make up for not spending enough time with them. 
The week of my flight I started experiencing what may be a mixed episode? I’ve actually been pretty stabilized since Jan with lamictal and Wellbutrin, so I didn’t notice the signs as I thought it was just me being productive. 
However, it felt like I started rapid cycling. First my mood took an immediate depressive dip, I slept for majority of the day. But I figured maybe it was because I have been averaging 5-6 hours of sleep a night for maybe a month? (Checked my Apple Watch data for this) 
I was bright and cheery the day after, texting and chatting with so many friends for a few days. It wasn’t till the morning after the last day of brightness I woke up with such a sense of dread and fatigue, and when I went to check my texts I was confused at how I didn’t remember even texting some of these paragraphs. 
I had thought, did I drink? Until reality hit me and I realize I haven’t had a drink since July. Did something change in my schedule? No… 
I thought I had time to recollect myself before my postponed flight that was supposed to be today, only 2 days before Xmas
But I didn’t go 
I’m terrified of affecting my family, I had a blackout (psychosis?) episode earlier this year on the last night of my visit. One minute I was having dinner with them and the next I’m waking up on the couch with vague recollections of me crying and screaming about my inadequacy in the family and stress of their expectations. Suffice to say i was utterly mortified and ashamed, my dad thought i was drunk (I never drink around family). And i couldn’t even refute it because they are immigrants and explaining my mental health disorder would only sound like an excuse. 
I rescheduled my flight for the end of the week, after Xmas because i fear showing up in the state i am. I’m paranoid, sleeping too much, then not sleeping at all to do stuff like draft my 2 weeks notice (I’m not trying to actually quit my job…), scrub at the floors with a brush, reorganizing my cabinets, went crazy on LinkedIn messaging sm people to “network” and set up a coffee chat, recklessly sold some stocks (to withdraw to my bank account for extra spending money, ngl i only have a vague recollection of this), broke a plate bc i was so irritable at how a speck wouldn’t come off, reliving every imaginable mistake I’ve made in my life and how that shows how I’m a terrible person and disappointment… 

Sorry that was such a run on ramble 
Basically is it selfish of me to not come back on time, i fear worsening my relationship with my parents so much especially after the blackout incident. I love them dearly but they’re also my biggest triggers bc their style of love is criticism. I feel so behind and inadequate and it kills me. I lash out as a defense mechanism.
