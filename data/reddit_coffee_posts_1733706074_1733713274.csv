1ha00we,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Critical_Armadillo_4/comments/1ha00we/my_balconyterrace_kills_around_one_and_one_half/,My balcony/terrace kills around one and one half bees a week and I have done nothing about it.,"The building I currently live in has a long and thin balcony that streches the entire width of the apartment. I´m on the 8th floor and have an amzaing view of a prestigious golf club -that I'm not part of- but, neither me (24M) nor my parents (56M) and (52F) use it. Not at all! Still, they make me clean it every week under the excuse that they always want to go out and 'enjoy' it but cannot because it happens to be dirty. My mother says I should clean it even more frequently: every other day. For context, I live in a desert mountainous coastal city so the balcony acumulates dust and sand. How frequently you ask? Every other day. Yes. 

I'm getting to the bee murder part.

The description of the 'Interstellar' apocalyptic environment is rather the normal lifestyle for me. Wind blows. Picks up humidity from the sea. Mixes it up with sand from the mountains and sticks it like concrete right in the floor of my balcony

...so I clean.

And every time I do I notice sometimes one, others two dead bees. Thereof one and a half bees. If it would be any other insect, I wouldn't shed a tear or give it a thought. Depending on the species, it might even make me glad. At most, it would bother me the fact that I would have to sweep them up -plus dried bird shit- before mopping the terrace. It would be some unpleasant extra work. But no. It is bees. They are cute, yellow and cute because of their color. Furthermore, I happen to know from general knowledge, that they are endangered species (Bee Movie, 2001). 

All added up: It hurts. Bad.

But I have not explained how they die yet. I will. The balcony is made of glass. It's transparent. And like many, if not all, insects can't see it. So they fly into the balcony and then try to fly out and I guess they hit the glass 'railing' (not sure if that's the right word. English is my second language) And these retards just don't to fly up so they exhaust themselves flying full force, helplessly, into the glass wall. Now; I say I guess because, I never actually see them die, I see them dead: full of dust, contracted and dry. On some rare cases I see them still fighting for dear life so I help them escape. One unfortunate time, I grabbed one and dropped it from the balcony to it's freedom. 

Oh how wrong I was. 

The little guy must have been so tired and dehydrated from flying towards a wall for hours, that it didn't took flight, at least until I lost sight of it around the 5th floor.

I try to comfort myself with the fact that, since this entire city was built on a desert, those bees exist thanks to people in the first place. Why? Well because there would be no vegetation nor water to live from. So existing and ceasing to by your maker doesn't sound so bad and even quite poetic -now that I think about it. But it still bothers me. You might say: ""It's just 2 bees a week, no big deal. 

No it isn't. 

My building is 18 stories tall, 16 of whom have a terrace. there are two apartments per floor. That is 32 balconies. Assuimg each kills one and one half bees every week. That is 48 bees a week, 2496 bees a year! 

It gets even worse.

I moved in in 2019. I believe the building was built in 2017. Best case scenario, in 2018. We are nearing the end of 2024. It's been 7 years. My building has killed 17472. According to google, that's the size of a bee colony. Madness. This is mass murder. This is genocide. But, at least unlike Bee Movie 2001, my building don't steal all the hive's hard earned honey.

I'm devastated.

My building has strict rules. I can't just replace the glass railing for another bee friendly/visible material. Once, my american floor-neigbours placed their towels to dry in the balcony and the karens in the building made a scandal through the WhatsApp chat of the building's landlords. They are tenants  so they hopefully didn't read the class slurs they were ranting. They were asked not to do it again indirectly through the concierge. Poor neighboors. They were kind law-abiding fellows. It's because of this aesthetic-related rules that I can't touch the balcony to save the bees.

On the other hand, I have to 'bee' honest (haha). I hate cleaning the balcony more than the death of those bees. It's hard to accpets but it doesn't hurt enough for me to do anything about it, yet I clean that damn balcony every week. My unemployed ass owes it to my parents. What did hurt was when a bee stung me when I was a kid. I cried. So maybe, this is karma for the bees. Sins of the father, sins of the son.

I have told only one person about this. 

My younger sibling (19M) who studies abroad in the US, so he could review my spelling since his english is better. As of today I don't plan on telling anyone else. Anyways, there might be enough information here for a geoguesser type of guy to deduce my identity from the details I've given. I'm posting it on reddit thanks to the anonymity of this social network. I'm not sure I would ever dare to talk to someone IRL about something so random. That is what I'm trying to find out. If I would, how could a normal conversation naturally degenerate enough for it to justify me introducing this 5 year old anecdote? I belief to remember that once, a topic's conversation reminded me about this bee predicament and I sought to mention it but stopped myself in time. Is it normal to have such thoughts? 

Am I retarded? 

Will people think I'm retarded if I confide in them? To add insult to injury, many people I know already feel that way about me. The question then would be: Would the disclosure of such thought harden such judgement? These questions I wish be answered by strangers. Specifically by redditors. The weird stuff I read in here makes me feel like you guys are as weird as me and that somehow I won't get abused in the comments below. Are some of these stories even real?

I think some are not. 

But some have such espicificity that convince me in spite of their insanity. For the record, this one is. I have been as honest as I can be articulate in english. The ages of people mentioned are true, the genders, the time frames and specially the number of dead bees. 

If it's not believable, I take the blame. 

I hardly do myself, but I had to get that itch from the back of my head. Maybe this way the thought will stop coming up every time I have to mop that useless balcony/terrace. When I move out, God willing, it won't be to place with one; unless it's 2m^2 tops. Enough to put two chairs and a tiny round coffee table. That's for another time because I don't have the money for a place of my own, I'm still single and I don't even drink coffee.

May your judgement come with mercy. 

PS: It would be fun to see someone deduce the country I'm from just from these thoughts. Please don't hack me. I promise to admit if someone guesses the right answer and it's substantiated correctly. Lucky guess don't count.

1h9zzzc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1h9zzzc/am_i_developing_feelings_for_my_girl_bestfriend/,Am I developing feelings for my girl bestfriend again?,"22M. Have been friends with this girl for 4 years, close friends for around 2 years. We met in college by being in the same friend group. We became really close very quickly during sophomore year after having a few classes together. We began to talk & text a bunch, study together, spend a lot of time together just us two (watching movies, grabbing coffees, getting lunch, etc.), and we'd often go off on our own at parties & dance together. She instantly became one of my best friends but I developed feelings for her as I found her super pretty and found out how cool of a girl she was. She was subtly flirty with me and progressively got more touchy. She told me how I'm the only guy she's comfortable around. The lines became a bit blurred for me as to whether we were just friends or if something more was going on. But I didn't want to risk ruining our friendship. It wasn't until I found out her own friends thought I should ask her out, so I built up the courage to ask her if she ever saw us as more than friends, to which she said no. It honestly shocked me, as I thought she for sure felt the same way, but it also hurt because I was worried I just ruined our friendship.

Fast forward, things were a bit weird for a while but we got over it. Now, we both graduated last spring but she's doing an extra year while I'm back home working, so we don't see each other often. But, we are definitely close friends again, we ft each other every now and then to catch up and she doesn't live far from me luckily, so when she is home we can see each other. Anyways, so I'm super happy we're close again as I really do value our friendship. I haven't thought about her as more than a friend in over a year. But, we met up over thanksgiving break to spend a day together, which was so much fun. It made me realize how much I missed her. And she kept telling me how she'll be home again in a few weeks for winter break so we have to meet up at least a few days over break. So I knew she really missed me too. My dilemma now is that after meeting up, I now find myself questioning again what it'd be like if we dated and if she'd ever develop romantic feelings for me. But I don't have a crush or anything on her again. I honestly think it might just be that I missed her so much and just wish we could spend more time together (which dating would be the easiest to do so). I'm not really sure what I'm feeling, if I maybe do have some romantic feelings for her again or if I just really missed my good friend?",1,1733713003.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

It's time to break out the repo troll. It's the build I learned with, lots of S-level games, but never any orbs. Not a Coglin Hunter. Should be fun! Back to some low-key dumb splats. WELL... 

    D:4 the ring ""Bogom"" {rPois rN+ Str+3 Slay+3 SInv}

  
I guess it's time to try hard. This ring truly carried the whole game. I grabbed a second cup of coffee... and then an early granite talisman. With a mid-game that just kept throwing slaying items at me, I cruised easily to a 4-rune (and my second ever!) win!

I was on cloud 9. What an incredible morning. This game that lives rent-free in my head, that has crushed my soul thousands of times, and now I have two orbs! Fantastic! ...also, I still had most of the day, so, why not keep playing? Time for some victory lap style decisions though. Back to Coglin Hunters (it's what I know) but let's screw around with Xom or Lug or something...

After a few quick deaths, I found a D:7 Temple with Xom and I got on board the chaos train. I was expecting a difficult game, and I had some close calls, but when Xom yanked me into a Bazaar mid Orc:2 and sold me these two absolute beauties, I knew it was going to be a blast. Punk, the weapon that carried me on my first win, but now with chaos? Oh, sure, Xom was going to end up getting me killed, but it was going to be glorious on the way down.

    Bought the chaotic +3 greatsling ""Punk"" {chaos, acid, rCorr} for 406 gold pieces

    Bought the +7 hand cannon ""Pukheb"" {chaos, rElec rN+} for 773 gold pieces

Back in my first CoHu win, I trained Evocation up to 24.6... and then I never used an Evocable. This play through I wanted to put that exp. Into something fun, so I dumped it right into Necro. Sure, moving around friendlies is obnoxious as a hunter, but they also eat enemy fire, and they spawn way over where they died... far away from me. Animate Dead, Death Channel, and Fugue of the Fallen while raining acid and chaos? Even when Xom ripped me across the map into the loot area of Elf:3, my tide of undead elves was inevitable!  Could it get any better?

    Snake:2 Acquired the +7 hand cannon of Massacring {speed, rC+}

Popped an Acq scroll and got the drop I never get. Dual-wielding Speed and Chaos all the while trying to survive Xom and build my hoard of undeath... what a great victory lap indeed! 

By the time Xom took me out of Zot:2 and threw me into the third level of the Abyss I didn't even care anymore. The Abyss couldn't deal out the pure chaos that I was. I got out, grabbed the orb, and ran for it. My 3rd ever win. With Xom. While screwing around celebrating finally winning. Even got a gem.

                 Began as a Coglin Hunter on Dec 8, 2024.

If you look for videos there are 2 different versions one with a Straw and one with a bag. 

**Straw Version:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckj7tFVrM0c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckj7tFVrM0c)

**Bag Version:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kjMj8Zh5vg&t=37s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kjMj8Zh5vg&t=37s)

Are there other version? Maybe, 

So the Lactose Liquid is the version I had, I poured in an 8 ounce glass and drank it.  It really had almost no taste to it.  I had no symptoms from drinking it, I didn't expect to have any anyway.  My issue is constant belching causes from something some foods are worse than other, even Low FODMAP foods didn't seem to reduce it, I did the diet for 7 weeks, lost like 15 lbs on it.  

The worst part of the test is the anxiety, from prepping for it, not taking any GERD medications, 14 days, the caffeine withdrawal from the 1 day fast, what a headache that brought on.  I don't drink coffee, cause it makes me feel like shit, even-though black was allowed, I didn't drink any.

I hope I did it right, I wish the bottles had a click, to know when you tightened it enough.  Over-tightening is bad they say. 

Other then that the test was pretty smooth, the 2 hours go by pretty fast since every 15 minutes you have to do something. 

I don't know why I'm hoping for a positive result, but I am, I just want to be able to solve this issue, belching like 20-30 times after certain meals suck.  With my luck UPS will lose the package. 

If I had to rate this test from 0 being easy to 10 being hard, if you remove the 14 day prep, it's a 0.  With the Prep, depending on your gerd conditions I can see it being a 10. ",1,1733712369.0,SIBO,0,1.0,False

1h9zr6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1h9zr6o/korean_german/,Korean German,"I met you in April 2024 through Tinder. You super-liked me on March 18, and I was thrilled—you’re Korean, and I’ve always been fond of anything Korean. You messaged me shortly before I traveled to my hometown, asking where I usually play tennis. I didn’t respond right away because I was busy, and your question made me think you were only interested in tennis. I ignored it until March 24, when you sent another message. This time, I replied. You asked if I was up for a game, and we agreed to meet in mid-April when I returned to Manila. You mentioned you were a bad texter (so am I), so we didn’t keep in touch much before meeting.

Fast forward to April 16—we played tennis at VMMC. I picked you up at MRT Quezon Avenue station, and you were my first non-family passenger since I started driving in Manila. I was so nervous because you didn’t talk much, leaving me to carry most of the conversation. I also didn’t expect you to speak English so well—I thought communication might be a challenge. On the court, I played terribly because I hadn’t practiced in over a month and wasn’t used to hard courts. I was so embarrassed. Afterward, we went for lunch at a Mediterranean restaurant near your place, Feta. I liked how you took the lead in choosing the restaurant and ordering food—it was a relief since I’m bad at making food-related decisions.

During lunch, we talked about your nice condo, your ex-girlfriend who moved abroad, and your upcoming trip to Germany to celebrate your birthday with friends. I felt the date didn’t go well—the mismatch in tennis skills and the awkwardness during lunch left me intimidated. You paid for lunch, and I dropped you off at your condo. You gave me a side hug before leaving, which felt like a good sign. Still, I thought it was a one-time thing and that I wouldn’t hear from you again.

In June, I saw you at VMMC tennis courts, wearing the same purple shirt from our first meeting. I pretended not to recognize you. Then, on July 11, you messaged me, asking if I was playing in the weekend tournament. The conversation was brief but ended with you suggesting we play again sometime. On July 24, out of the blue, you messaged, “Hope you’re fine during this typhoon season. Depressing weather.” It was so random, but it made me happy. Still, I guarded my heart, not sure if you were really interested.

On August 5, you asked if I was playing in a tournament at CSA Bulacan on September 7. I initially said no—I was tired of doubles due to partner issues—but you encouraged me to try singles. I agreed, partly to spend the day with you. I figured you might need a ride since CSA is far, and we planned to go together.

September 7 marked our second meeting, five months after April. We ended up spending the entire day together because my games were in the morning and yours in the afternoon. I picked you up at 6 a.m., and we headed to the venue. Playing singles, a game I’m not confident in, was nerve-wracking because I wanted to impress you. Despite my poor performance, we grew closer that day, supporting each other throughout the tournament. You met some of my friends, which felt special. On the drive back, we talked a lot, thanks to the heavy traffic. We had dinner at Hyeongje Grill, a Korean BBQ place near your condo. For the first time, we sat next to each other—it felt like a boyfriend-girlfriend moment as we cut meat for each other. Before parting, you gave me another side hug. This time, it felt more meaningful because you returned to the car just to say goodbye. I knew there’d be a next time, but I didn’t want to rush it.

Our next meeting was at UP Diliman for tennis. You met some of my friends, though you were very introverted and not as social. Later, we had lunch at Din Tai Fung in Megamall, where you introduced me to my now-favorite dessert, Golden Lava Salted Egg Buns. We had coffee at Muji, where I learned your go-to order is iced Americano. At the elevator in Shangri-la Mall, you gave me your usual side hug before leaving.

When you injured your wrist, you weren’t sure if you could play tennis. I hesitated but asked if we could do lunch instead. You took a day to respond, which made me anxious, but eventually, we planned to meet on October 20. For the first time, we met without tennis involved. After meeting at Zara, we had lunch at Grifoni in Podium, followed by coffee at Elephant Grounds. I was still very conscious around you, but I enjoyed our time together. When I left, you said, “See you in December when I’m back from Thailand.” It was the first time you expressed wanting to see me again, and it meant a lot.

November was filled with thoughts of you. I couldn’t get you out of my head and counted the days until December. Then, as I prepared for a friend’s wedding, John Mayer’s XO played, and it made me think of you. Hours later, you messaged me. It wasn’t much, but knowing you reached out meant the world to me.

I don’t know what will happen next, but I want to keep seeing you and getting to know you. Writing this on my flight back to Manila from Iloilo, I just can’t get you out of my mind.",4,1733712198.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Im in kind of a tough situation and im not really sure what to do. My brother and sister in law live in boston so one morning while im visiting boston i was supposed meet up with them for coffee but i just found out a close family relative is staying with them. And this close relative used to be very inapropriate with me when i was little. He would baby sit me and my earliest childhood memories are all of him and what he did to me but i never told anyone because he made my feel like i wanted it and it was all my fault and even though logically i know its not but i feel like it is my fault because i remember instances where i willingly went into his room. So i always felt that if i told anyone they would say its my fault and my parents love him and he would tell me they would chose him over me. And my parents have been through so much and i never wanted to burden them with this so i stayed quiet. It stopped when i was like 12 but i still have night mares and i when someone touches like my lower back or butt or thighs i feel like im gonna vomit. But hes gonna be in boston and hes coming to the breakfast thing and i dont know what to do cause my dad wants me to see my bother cause their relationship is rocky and i dont wanna mess it up but i cant tell them to not bring him with out it being suspicious you know. And i feel like a terrible daughter because i love my parents and i dont want to cause problems but theres also a small part of me that hates them becuase they never noticed! How could they never notice? I would have panick attacks when ever he came over for holidays like balling on the floor uncontrollably and they just thought i was being difficult and i felt like them words to tell them where stuck in my throat and suffocating me. There were years where i wouldnt let people touch me at all and they never saw that something was wrong and im so sorry to put this all on you but im really panicking and ive never told anyone this before like ever not in a diary not ever and i just need someone to hear the words that have choked me for 15 years",1,1733712187.0,rapecounseling,1,1.0,False

I'm not used to reddit or community stuff I'm 31 male. I hope this post might help somebody. I hope this post might help guide some soul and tell him/her that is not alone. That there are more people that are dealing with you issue

  
I've been following Dr K since the Pandemic in 2021. It was like fresh air in the worst part of my life and because I watched him I had expectations on my medic. When I got into medication I asked my shrink (psychiatrist I love the word shrink because one english teacher used it in an english class and I never forgot it I always wanted to use it in a sentence) for advice and he told me that he's here for the pills if I want some self improvement I should go to a psychologist.

I work at HR (Human Resources or Inhumane Resources as we joke) as a crew manager for two cruises (small ones) but it was like doing a lot of papers for like 160 people. The red flag that now I know that was there was that the person that was working in my position wanted out because of burnout and lack of mobility in the corporate ladder.  I went to the gold rush of wall street bets and loose big money for my reality. I went into debt with the bank. Having a huge debt and working in a company in which I could be fired got me into fear mode and God knows how much did I try to do my best to keep my work but the more I wanted that the more conflict that was generated.

  
During the pandemic the company fired a lot of people. One of that was the former CEO. He was a guy that started in the company with a internship and made his way up. People usually said that he was a hermetic person and that he never wanted to teach people how to work, but in the few months that we where working he taught me some basic stuff. For what I know he was the person at the company he knew all the ins and outs. He was what I wanted to become. He was a tree that was starting to shelter me in the work. Unfortunately he did not want to cut his salary during the pandemic and the company fired him. They paid him and he went his way. 

The new person in charge was with the company for a long time. But he didn't know how to do the job. The former CEO did all the heavy lifting and nobody else knew all the company in the same way as he did. The hard times for the company where starting.

I that started to work in the company in January 2020 was now the go to ask person. I managed the people and because when the coworkers where cozy at home during the pandemic taking it easy I was reading all the info that I could get into. I read all the manuals that the former CEO made for the company and I got into studying the maritime laws in my country (totally not Chile) that were changing at the time.

For what I've leaned from my inner work I was doing all that because I was afraid and scared. But also because I wanted to invigorate my ego. Me me me. I can do all this at the company and because I can do all this you can not fire me. I'm afraid of being let go so give me more work to do. I'm afraid of being lonely so I can't say no to other coworkers requests. I can do everything so I don't need help or as my inner smart kid sayid I should be able to do all. I never failed a subject. Never. I always went to extra curricular activities and we won. I knew no defeat. I. the same I that Dr K yells with energy on the videos of ego was in charge. And because that if it wasn't my way it was wrong. All the advices that people tried to give where on deaf ears. I was like a raging bull. Some people tried to help but in that state of mind those were no advice those were punches launched at me. I was in a fight mode. And because nobody knew what to do (because the former CEO did all the heavy lifting) all the people in the company were in similar mode. I think that the people were thinking something like if the ship is going to sink it's not because of me.

The head of HR was a lady that new nothing of the maritime industry and she was the last person that was fired during pandemic. I always remember a worker that said to her. You are going to be the last one fired and that happened. She tried tho. She always went home late. She always was in the office and she was the last one there. Looking back I relate that she might have been afraid. Then the new head of the company put other persona as head of HR. They asked the team (me and the person that pays the payroll) to teach him the ins and outs of HR. We did, but he didn't liste. We told him to prepare with time but he did not. He used to work for other company of the holding an now he was head of HR for our company too. He was used to other kind of life. He was the person that was always in the kitchen drinking coffee or he was talking with coworkers. Now he needed to work, take decisions and file reports. It's not as he changed that much but the team had to work around that.

Looking back during that time form me was like being in the bridge of a ship in a stormy day. The engine of the ship is not working. You try to contact the personnel for help but they are putting out the fire. You are an officer and there is no captain for help he's out of the picture. You are alone in the bridge. Other ships are pointing their guns at you. The sea is moving and all the lights are red and red doesn't mean good. The alarms are ringing and you have to make a choice. You jump the ship to try to save yourself but you drown, but when you drown you apear all again in the same situation. There was no escape I was sinking myself deep into the sea. To the unknown. It was my firs failure.

For context during a day I started to work at 8 AM (the entry time was 9 AM) an worked all day until 10 pm (exit time was 6:30 pm). I always was behind in work. One of the worst recurring issues was that I was hiring a person, that person was sited next to me while I was working his documentation While I was sending an e-mail to a coworker that needed data, while I was talking on the phone to the next hire I needed, while a coworker was talking me to send him/her information that was urgent. Hell I was like an octopus. A person told me during this time something that translate like this. You might not be able to finish your workload, but your workload might finish you. During this time I needed to do stuff fast, and because of that I usually fought with coworkers (usually higher ups in the food chain) to do stuff faster. That's why I hate meetings, you are in a room with people trying to come up to a solution that you came up half an hour ago and because they don't know what to do they want you to explain to them step by step why they should do that and they take their time (and yours too) time that you need to do operative stuff. It was frustrating. It was here the point when I went numb. I was a working and fighting machine, I needed to do my job. For all the people there that might be in a similar situation, that might lack the capacity to tune with your own emotions and you feel like you are in a dark place. All I have to say is that you could be able to overcome that. But as Dr K says it's going to be a hell of a ride. Sometimes you might go back to that dark place and then see the light. It's like drowning yourself and then taking a bit of air, just enough not to drown but you still drowning. What can I say. You'll drown many times. More than I would like to admit. But each breath you take is becoming larger and larger. The liquid that you are fighting with it's becoming way less denser and when you think you are good again you'll drown again. Hell some crocodile tears are running on my face. But now you know you can save yourself and the cycle continues. But with time each cycle is not as hard as the previous one. Now you are back in the bridge of your ship and the lights are not red, the lights are not green not yet, the lights are yellow. The other ships are not pointing at you, they are just ships in the same sea as you. You might discover that you might need the assistance of a captain but there is other possibility, that because you have more experience and knowledge you might have become your own captain.   

In school, high school, college and even in a masters degree program the people teach you how to succeed. But they never tell you what to do when things go south. It was my first huge set back and it was very personal. My ego was damaged, my mind was in shambles. Learning to deal with failure for me was hard. I was not used to failure. I'm still working on that.

Dr K was like a star that helped me guide my ship. But a guide serves one purpose, to choose by yourself your destination. You are the person that has to choose where is your new destination. 

What did the best improvements for my situation? 

First you have to ask for help, you might like it or not, but the truth is that you are in no position of taking a decision. You have to ask for a professional. You might need medicine. You might have been in a position in which you were like a frog that was in a pan with cold water but the chef decided to turn the stove on and bit by bit the water starts to heat. You might tolerate it, but you might not now the real difference between warm an boiling. Maybe you just are used to boiling and you forgot what does cold feel like. Maybe your body is telling you that you are boiling but you don't listen.

Second you have to move your body, you have to exercise. Your body has to be able to keep with your mind and if your mind is exhausted it's better for your body to be exhausted as well (why I don't know but it did work). For me a rowing machine worked and I only do three sets of 15 minutes per week. Also i do stretching in the morning.

Third having more muscle helps you during the day now you can help yourself. Cleaning my room and my house has helped me a lot. But when I stoped doing exercises I stoped doing all the related stuff.

Fourth having an emotions diary helps to get to know you better. It does help to identify what does triggers certain reactions. For example thanks to this I realized that when I was near a coworker I was starting to feel bad emotions. My stomach started to grow. My spine started to curb. It was like Golum from Lord of the Rings.

Fifth keep the people important for you together and look for excuses to interact with them. I pushed away my friends because of the workload that I had. Because if I wanted to hang out with them it was usually late. And it's weird how after laughing until 3 am I can wake up with energy at 7 am on Saturday and be productive in house stuff. If you can not interact with them face to face maybe a vodeogame might help with some voice chat. There is a fulfillment in knowing that you matter to another person.

Sixth the way is long and you should look for your own mantras for difficult times. I used to over eat (and some times I still do but not as bad as before). My mantra was something that translates like this. A morning without eating for fun is a day I won. Then it became a morning and a evening, then a day. Now I say it to myself when I want to over eat and I'm starting to loose weight.

Seventh you are going to loose some days, but you can also try next day. And when that happens I say to myself It's ok to loose today but I have to win tomorrow. But I have to put emphasis that I say it as a friend to myself. With a smile as a anime character (maybe Naruto)

  
Eight you have to learn from yourself, you write down your own manual and when you learn from yourself you start to pick up somethings that you never even considered. For example some people say that I don't look at people that I glare at people (mirada penetrante in Spanish). Some people had said that I'm very intuitive with people that I'm starting to know. But now I realize that I glare because I was bullied as a kid. I have to be intuitive to because I have to know if the persona approaching me has good or bad intention. It's sad in a way but not many people can do that. It's kinda like a super power. And with that information now I have to learn to get my guard down and relax.

  
You never stop learning

  
I hope this helps you

Have a good morning/evening/night/day/year/decade/life :)

I'd find a girl to date and she wouldn't be 'the one' (odds are you won't marry your first partner), I'd build up confidence through college and have some hook ups in college and through my 20s. I'd move to a big city where there's stuff to do and I could play rec soccer. Around age 28 I'd seriously start looking for love. I'd try a couple jobs and figure out what I wanted to do, I'd take some trips. 

Well, none of that has happened. I'm 30, I've gone on nine dates and my first and only kiss was nine years ago. No, I never went further than that quick kiss on the lips. I have no relationship experience and very little idea what I want in a partner. I never gained any confidence and have no clue how to flirt. In general I still feel completely unwanted, undesirable, and at best invisible to women. I feel like having done none of those goals I had, that I wasted college and my twenty's and effectively my youth. Yeah, I know 30 is still young, but other than having a job I don't feel any different than I did when I was 20. 

I haven't been able to get over my anxiety and there is no way I can approach a woman in person. Dating apps destroyed in less than a month what confidence I had that took nearly three years to build up in therapy. My depression is still here and I don't feel like medications have helped at all. I still feel like I'm broken, I'm unwanted, I'm an outcast, and obviously I have no self esteem or confidence in myself. 

I know there's so much more to life than sex, but it's damn near the only thing I think about sometimes. There are teens who weren't alive when I was in high school that are having sex. Then I'm over here having a panic attack lasting for hours when trying to decide which coffee shop to ask a girl to meet me at. 

Therapy and everything else I've done hasn't made me feel like I have any chance to stop feeling like shit or that I'll find a girl who likes me. Online dating is terrible, I used a half dozen apps for nearly a year and I had nine on my phone at one point; I used tinder, hinge, and bumble for about 15 months, and from all of that I got maybe 50 matches and two dates out of it. I know a lot of people agree online dating sucks, but holy fuck that makes you feel unwanted and rejected by women. If I did get to a date, I have no idea what I'm doing. I don't know how to really act on a date, I can't flirt, I struggle to pick up on body language, and I'm not charismatic. I'm weird and awkward and who tf wants to go home with the weird guy? Let's say she was okay with me going for a kiss, I think I'm more likely to vomit from the nerves than try to kiss her. 

In summary, I feel like I've wasted more than a decade of my life and that after years of trying to work through autism, social anxiety, and depression and seeing no progress, I see no light at the end of the tunnel. I'm unhappy with myself, I'm sexually frustrated and touch starved, and I have no goals or direction in life. I feel like a complete failure in so many areas of life.

Near the beginning of my sophomore year of college, on my 20th birthday, my girlfriend of 3 years and I ended our toxic relationship due to me discovering that she had been cheating on me.

And then, just two months later, I started dating a girl that I thought I would be with forever. 

The college we went to was a little weird. We would go to a state sponsored community college for 2 years and earn our associates degree, and then we’d be able to move up to our main campus which was a major University that was also in the same state. If we did this program (2 years at the community college and 2 years at the university), then the state would cover most of our tuition.


Needless to say; just after my 20th birthday in October 2021 when my long term girlfriend and I broke up, it was rough living at home and commuting to a community college. More than anything I just wanted to fully immerse myself in the college lifestyle and forget about her, but that lifestyle didn’t exist outside of our “main campus”. I was living at home and driving to school just like I always had, it was a rough time.

But all that changed when I met this girl. We were in a history class together and really hit it off talking after class, she was so cool and funny to talk to, it was the most fun I’d had meeting someone new in such a long time. And she was so unbelievably beautiful, you wouldn’t believe it. The fact that she’d be seen talking to a guy like me was insane to me. I eventually got her number and we started texting a lot. When the semester was coming to and end we started going on study dates to local coffee shops so we could prepare for our finals. These study dates eventually turned into real dates and I was loving every second I spent with her. She officially became my girlfriend shortly after Christmas in 2021.

She was so perfect and everything about our relationship was wonderful, better than anything I could have ever imagined for myself. We went to the city together to go on romantic dates, and could spend cold winter nights just driving around and having deep conversations about life. We painted together a lot (one of her hobbies), and cuddled up at night to watch our horror shows together. We went to the mall together, we went to fancy restaurants together, we took cold walks on the beach together. I spent all my time at her house, which was in the same town as our community college and was also the capital of our state. 

For the first time in my life, and after two failed relationships before, I felt like I was truly in love. And I could tell that she was in love with me back. We made a pact to be with each other forever, we called each other our soul mates and we would talk all the time about what our future would look like. She was so nice to me and respected me like no one else ever had. And I loved her more than anything else in the world.

When the spring semester of my sophomore year started, we signed up for a lot of classes together and hung out together all the time. I was also able to score an internship with the state government, which was absolutely perfect because I have always been obsessed with politics and government, it was my major in college and more than anything I want to hold elected office some day and do my best to change things for the better. The office was also 5 minutes from her house and 10 minutes from our campus, so I was in this town all the time. I was over the moon. I had my dream job, my future career prospects seemed great, I was with the love of my life and only falling deeper in love every day, and I was acing all my classes.

Also around this time I decided to take up Shakespearean stage acting, I auditioned for and was cast in a Shakespeare show at a local theater in my home town, which was huge for me because I had never put myself out there like that.

June 2022 eventually came around and my girlfriend and I graduated from community college with our associates degrees. My internship came to a close, and I performed in my play, which sold out every night and went amazingly. Also around this time my girlfriend and I made plans to continue our studies at our university’s main campus. She would be moving into a dorm and I would be moving into a townhouse with my best friends from high school who were already up there. They were about 10 minutes apart.

I spent the summer of 2022 managing the campaign for a state senator who I had met through my internship with the state government. It was a grueling job that took up most of my time and he ended up losing, but he paid me well and I got a lot of valuable experience, definitely saw the hard side of politics that I would have to undertake if it was something I wanted to do.

As my junior year started, my girlfriend and I moved up to our main campus and our relationship grew even stronger. We were no longer living with our families so aside from when we were in class and when she was at work, we spend almost all of our time together going on dates or having sleepovers or just hanging out at each others places. It was so perfect and we felt like we were preparing for our marriage life when we would live together. Every day I kept falling deeper and deeper in love with this girl. We had such a profound connection and we knew everything about each other and were completely vulnerable together all the time. I was certain I had found my soul mate.

It was also so great getting to live with my friends and have people over to our house all the time. Every night if I wasn’t with my girlfriend, me and my friends were all partying at my place after hitting the bars.

On top of this I had always been pretty good at school and had saved a lot of money up, so life was going pretty well for me, I was the happiest I’d ever been in my life.

I even started in another Shakespeare play in spring of 2023, and began to earn some serious props as an actor.

In the summer of 2023, after my junior year,I was offered an internship with my dad’s company as a salesman.His company is a massive manufacturer in the restaurant industry and I would be charged with selling to end users. I did pretty well with it, ended up closing about 200k in business. This caught the attention of an affiliate company (a broker firm that worked closely with my dad’s company) and they offered me a full time job when I graduated with extremely generous pay. Obviously I accepted.

My senior year was essentially a repeat of my junior year. I starred in another Shakespeare production, I was living with my friends acing all my classes, I was with my girlfriend all the time.

But in a way it was even better. I had the security of a job offer after college and my girlfriend took a one year lease on a townhouse that was right next to mine, so I got to see her even more often.

Everything continued to be so perfect, until I graduated college with my bachelors degree. 

My girlfriend’s lease ended about a month before mine, so she moved back home immediately. I planned to do the same once my lease was up as I thought it would make more sense to work full time and save up for a house rather than renting. 

She changed pretty much immediately after we graduated.

We were a very normal couple, we enjoyed a healthy sex life and occasionally going to the bar together. We made crude jokes and laughed a lot about stupid shit, and we did a lot of stupid shit together.

She spent the last month of our relationship falling deeper and deeper and deeper into a religious rabbit hole until she was essentially a fundamentalist evangelical Christian. She had always been somewhat more religious than me, but not like this.

For context, I’m not a religious person at all.

The last month of our relationship consisted of one ongoing fight. I needed to convert and throw myself as deeply into religion as her and make Jesus the center of our relationship, or we would be done. I tried and tried and tried to compromise with her but ultimately I couldn’t lie about the person I was to appease someone else. We broken up mutually at the end of June, on our 2 and a half year anniversary.

I was completely devastated. But I didn’t have time to heal. I had started working full time just two weeks prior, and two weeks after our breakup I moved back home with family.

I was numb. I was upset about leaving college and moving out of the house I shared with my friends, but most of all I was completely fucking broken over the fact that the relationship I thought would last forever had ended. All I did was work, I threw myself into my job and started working constantly.

And I discovered that I don’t like my job.

I cover the entire metro area of the major city that I live 45 minutes away from. I have accounts all over here and I’m expected to be calling on them all day or doing admin work. It’s a lot of driving, a lot of sales, and a lot of soulless boring fucking work that I don’t enjoy doing. Don’t get me wrong, I’m extremely lucky. I couldn’t get paid this much bag my age anywhere else and I’m very grateful for that. But I don’t want to do sales; I don’t like it. I like government and politics, and that’s what I’ve wanted to do since I was 12.

I have some friends living in my hometown, and I see them as much as I can, but it’s hard to do much more than play video games together or go to a bar together for a few hours at a time when most of us are all working full time.

Furthermore, the girl I thought I would marry started seeing someone else (a youth pastor) right around my 23rd birthday. She meant everything to me and I was fucking replaced in 4 months.


I’m empty. Most days I go to work and come home and don’t do shit. I’ve started working out and I was cast to be in another play, but it’s not helping. I see my friends when I can, but it doesn’t help. I feel completely stuck.


It’s been 5 and a half months of dealing with this new reality. I have lost all hope and optimism I have for the future. I also had a falling out with all of my female friends, so the only people I talk to are my few close friends, my family, and my coworkers. And I only ever even see my coworkers like once every two weeks, I’m alone at work most of the time.

I truly don’t know where to go from here. I know I want to move out of this town as soon as possible, but it feels like all the happiness I once had was gone.

I feel dizzy, winded, foggy, and like I have anxiety for no reason. And I generally just feel extremely fatigued on a daily basis. I’ve had to quit drinking coffee because of the increased heart rate and anxiety. I haven’t been diagnosed, but I’m at the point I think I should talk to a doctor about my symptoms. I work in a high stress career field, and I feel like I may have to find something else that’s not as stressful.

1h9zjrs,https://www.reddit.com/r/CotUPCC/comments/1h9zjrs/milk/,Milk,"Milk has always been a staple in my life, but I never thought it would play a role in my journey towards enlightenment. It started with a simple realization: the act of pouring milk into my morning coffee became a moment of mindfulness. Each day, as I watched the white liquid swirl and blend with the dark coffee, I felt a sense of peace and calm. This small act, seemingly mundane, was my first step towards appreciating the present moment and embracing mindfulness.

As I delved deeper into the practice of mindfulness, I began to see milk as a symbol of purity and simplicity. Its white, unassuming nature reminded me of the importance of stripping away the complexities of life and returning to a more basic, authentic state of being. This symbolism became a powerful reminder to focus on the essentials, to nourish not only my body but also my mind and soul with simplicity and clarity.

Milk also taught me about the interconnectedness of all things. From the cow that produces it to the farmers who collect it and the process it undergoes before reaching my table, I began to see how everything is interconnected. This realization expanded my understanding of the world and my place in it. It made me more conscious of the choices I make and the impact they have on the environment and others. It was a humbling experience that fostered a sense of gratitude and responsibility.

Another aspect of milk that resonated with me was its nurturing quality. Just as milk is one of the first sources of nourishment for many, I began to see the importance of nurturing myself and others. This realization encouraged me to cultivate kindness and compassion, both towards myself and those around me. It was a gentle reminder that, just as milk provides sustenance, my actions and words can provide support and comfort to others.

The routine of having milk daily also became a lesson in consistency and discipline. Every morning, preparing my coffee with milk became a ritual that grounded me. This simple act of consistency reminded me that enlightenment is not a sudden epiphany but a gradual process that requires daily practice and commitment. It taught me the value of perseverance and the importance of nurturing good habits that contribute to my well-being and growth.

Milk's transformative nature, as it changes from liquid to foam or mixes with other ingredients to create something new, became a metaphor for personal transformation. It inspired me to embrace change and be open to new experiences. Just as milk can take on different forms and flavors, I realized that I, too, could evolve and adapt. This perspective helped me to let go of fear and embrace the unknown, knowing that change is a natural and necessary part of life's journey.

The simplicity of milk also helped me appreciate the beauty in everyday things. Often, we get caught up in the search for extraordinary experiences, overlooking the simple joys that life offers. Milk, in its plainness, reminded me to find beauty in the ordinary. This shift in perspective allowed me to see the world with fresh eyes and appreciate the little moments that make life meaningful.

Another lesson milk taught me was about balance. Whether it's in my diet or in life, balance is essential. The presence of milk in my meals became a reminder to maintain balance in all aspects of life—between work and rest, solitude and socializing, giving and receiving. This balance is crucial for maintaining harmony and well-being, and recognizing it was an important step in my journey towards enlightenment.

Sharing milk with others, whether in the form of a cup of tea or a meal, became an act of connection and community. It reminded me of the importance of sharing and being part of something larger than myself. This sense of community and connection is a vital aspect of the human experience and a key component of enlightenment. It taught me that we are all interconnected and that true happiness comes from connecting with others and contributing to their well-being.

In conclusion, milk, in its simplicity and purity, became a powerful symbol and tool on my path to enlightenment. It taught me valuable lessons about mindfulness, simplicity, interconnectedness, nurturing, consistency, transformation, appreciation, balance, and community. What started as a simple ingredient in my daily routine evolved into a profound source of inspiration and insight. Through milk, I learned to see the world differently, appreciate the little things, and embrace the journey towards a more enlightened and fulfilling life.",1,1733711528.0,CotUPCC,0,1.0,False

I am 5’1”, plus sized, and experience anxiety (especially in relationships). I have little dating experience, so please be patient! My love language is words of affirmation. I understand physical attraction is necessary, so I’m open to swapping pics sooner than later. I am looking for a serious relationship, so if you’re only looking for nsfw chat, I’m not for you.

🎵🎷 I graduated with my music ed degree, play saxophone and sing!

☕️🍣 I love sushi, chain restaurants, and coffee. My go-to order is an iced vanilla dirty chai latte.

🍿📺 I like watching movies (thrillers/romcoms) and the same tv shows over and over (dance moms, glee, good girls, etc.)

About you:
* Preferably between 23-30 years old and in the area (within reason)
* Masculine leaning or male. I tend to go for mountain men (tall, muscular/bulky build and beard), but I’m open to all figures and ethnicities :) 
* Kind, patient and a good communicator

1h9zh3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Autism_Parenting/comments/1h9zh3w/how_do_you_enjoy_holiday_activities_as_a_family/,How do you enjoy holiday activities as a family?,"It feels like every time we try to go out and do something together as a family—pumpkin farm, Christmas markets, etc.—the kids ruin it for us.  I’ve learned we can’t go anywhere without everyone being fed first, then potty breaks, and no stops along the way from home to the event/destination or the little one yells at us and demands we go straight there because there is zero patience with that kid.  It also can’t be too crowded of an event because they will get bored and boredom equals mad, so we can’t just stroll along and look at things or enjoy the atmosphere because the older one gets social anxiety and the little one storms off and demanded do what they want to do (which is usually whatever kid activity is there and nothing else).  We made the mistake of going to a carved pumpkin walkthrough display that ends with a bounce house kingdom.  Well, they put the bounce houses in front so you see those first but you can’t get to them until the end.  So the whole time the kid was crying about how they wanted to “have fun” and wouldn’t do anything else along the path.

Today we decided to go to an old fashioned Christmas market.  We had to stop 3 times on the way to find a bathroom, by the time we got there we realized it was so packed we weren’t going to be able to move in there so we chose to go somewhere else.  The change of plans was difficult at first but we got through it.  We went to a nearby town to walk their small shops and cafes.  We told the kids that we were looking for gifts for family and that this wasn’t about getting stuff for ourselves, it was about giving to others.  Well, apparently we didn’t say it literally enough because the little one found a toy in the first shop that they were in love with and wouldn’t leave it alone.  When we finally moved onto the next shop, they wouldn’t let the idea go.  It festered into an obsession and before we knew it, the kid was mad and crying and refusing to do anything unless we bought that toy.  We tried explaining that Xmas is coming and this isn’t a time for us to buy things for them, but to shop for others.  This smart kid says “but you said we’re shopping for family and I’m family!  I’m part of your family, so you should buy it for me!”  We had to leave the store and sat outside in front for a good 20 minutes with them sobbing and throwing a fit because they couldn’t move on from this toy.  Finally I just gave up.  I walked away saying “I’m going to get an ice cream cone”, went across the street and came back with 1 single cone in my hand and just stood there not saying a word, hoping it would be enough of a distraction to shift this kid’s attention and make them want that instead so we could calm down and talk about the situation.  I assumed there was a low blood sugar thing happening as well because they refused to eat the sandwich we ordered earlier because the peanut butter tasted different from ours at home.

So, once we all went back over and got ice cream and could move on from the toy obsession a little bit, we weren’t able to go in any other stores because we were afraid the kid would find something else they wanted and freak out all over again.  We walked up and down the town, stopped in 1 store to get coffee and 1 to get a box of chocolates as a gift.  But other than that, the entire day was blown over a stupid toy in the first store!  

I just don’t know how to handle this anymore.  Our oldest used to love going to stuff like this when they were little.  But the last couple times it’s been the youngest causing a big stink over things and making the whole experience miserable.  My therapist suggested we get a sitter and do these things without the kids, but it just doesn’t feel right to do that. These are typical holiday things that we consider family traditions and we only have so many weekends during the holiday season to enjoy these things.  I never thought they would be so hard!

Can any of you relate or offer advice on how to keep our family outings alive without a guaranteed meltdown?

1h9zcoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h9zcoh/my_grandpa_was_a_prison_guard_and_he_told_me_the/,"My grandpa was a prison guard, and he told me the horrible things he witnessed there","  My grandfather was always kind of a dick. I know that’s probably not the most kosher thing to say about a close family member but I think most people who knew him (including him) would agree.

  He was a stone-faced man, never showed much emotion and always had a fuse about as short as the balding grey hair atop his scalp. He wore a seemingly perpetual scowl upon his face and a narrowed brow that seemed to sneer with that get-the-hell-off-my-lawn energy that only a proud boomer could properly muster.

  I remember one summer my family went out to visit him and my grandma, only for him to chastise my older sister for gaining a bit of weight. It of course made her cry and quickly devolved into a huge family drama that may never have been fully resolved.

  In stark contrast, my grandma was the most loving and kind person I’ve ever known, so when she passed a few years ago it really struck my whole family hard. The funeral was a sordid affair with my grandfather remaining distant the entire time, and not bothering to say a word on her behalf. The rest of the family gave eulogies and tried commemorating her the best we could, but grandpa seemed not to notice or care either way.

  Once the ceremony concluded, most of the guests dispersed from the church. As the attendees thinned, I found myself alone in the pews. Grandpa was seated up at the front, and although I didn’t necessarily want to talk with him, I felt as though I should.

  “Hey grandpa… I’m really sorry for your loss.” He turned to me, a look of spite etched upon his face. He seemed to take note of my expression and his faltered into a sigh.

  “Thanks buddy… tough day for all of us.” He dabbed his forehead with a handkerchief and swallowed hard. In that moment I saw my grandfather in a way I never had before. He was broken and vulnerable; newly alone in the world and clearly struggling to come to terms with it. I felt for him, and although we’ve never had the best relationship I very much wanted to try and be there for him.

  Grandpa rose from his seat and approached the casket. He put a hand down upon it, speaking softly under his breath.

  “Don’t worry darlin’, I’m right behind you.”

  Grandpa and I talked a bit more, and eventually I decided he could use some company for the night. Although he was off-putting as a person, he was family. There was also something I always found interesting about him. There was something about him that always enthralled me. Despite his cold exterior, I knew there was more to him than just ‘mean for mean’s sake’. Either way, no one should have to mourn alone and so I decided to join him for dinner.

  After the ceremony concluded I left the church and went to the store and picked us up some fresh steaks, golden potatoes and asparagus. I figured cooking him a good meal was the least I could do considering the difficult circumstances.

  My grandparents’ old home was considerably more worn and overgrown than last I’d seen it as I pulled my car into the driveway. Of course, it was understandable considering the situation, but the difference was stark. It had been well over a decade since last I’d been out there, and although vaguely familiar the wear and tear made it seem foreign.

  Grandpa welcomed me at the front door, and the two of us went into the backyard as he fired up the grill. It was a bit awkward at first, but after a beer or two we started opening up little more to one another. I told him about my life, fiancé and work, and he seemed genuinely interested in it.

  We talked awhile as the steaks grilled, but I realize not many are reading this to hear about my fated reunion with my estranged grandfather. This is a horror sub after all, and as such it’s probably best I just cut to the chase.

  Grandpa worked in prison rehabilitation for the entirety of his career. He began at just 18 years old as a prison guard, and eventually worked his way up to warden which he presided as up until his retirement several years ago. I asked him which prison he worked for, but he sort of avoided the question.

  “Boy that’s gotta be a tough line of work, huh?” I floated the question out, and he paused to ponder it. He swished the beer in his bottle before shrugging.

  “You get used to it, like anything I ‘spose, but it’d be a lie to call it easy. Always gotta be on your toes, anticipating things to pop off at any moment. Never know what to expect really.”

  He told me a few stories he had from his long tenure of corrections. He almost seemed overly eager to talk about them, and it made me realize he probably didn’t have anyone else to tell them to. He was a bit of loner after all, and it made me feel for him that his wife and likely only real human connection in the world was now gone.

  The two of us ate our dinner and continued chatting about his work in the prison industry and the miasma of experiences he was subjected to there. He had plenty of lighthearted stuff about coworkers and various interactions with inmates, but his tone seemed hampered. I don’t know how to explain it, but it was likely there was something else that bothered him, and I decided to try and coax it out of him

  “You probably saw some messed-up things there too, huh?” Grandpa sat back in thought, his pale-white beard partially obscuring his disconcerted grimace. He then chuckled and clasped his hands together on his lap.

  “Yeah, you could say that.”

  As I’d hoped, he then delved into a few stories about stabbings, attempted breakouts and attacks on prison personnel. He had no shortage of rather gruesome events to recall, but of course there was one which dwarfed them all.

  “Then there were the experiments.” My interest piqued as soon as he said that. He paused then, his head slowly swiveling on his shoulders.

  “Experiments?”

  “Yeah, or clinical trials I ‘spose. They can sugarcoat them however they like… but that don’t change the reality. Far as I know they never even published the findings… and I’m not surprised.” He was clearly a bit reticent to divulge the details, and I didn’t want to push him on it. The admission alone seemed to hang like a weight on his neck, dragging his posture down and his eyes into fog.

  “If there is a god out there… I can understand why we never hear from him.”

  Grandpa said he had been working at the prison for a good two decades when these experiments began. By then he was the lead guard on shift, and essentially second in command to the presiding warden at the time. Grandpa was summoned by the warden one day for an impromptu meeting, or so he thought.

  As he entered the room, he found the warden with two other men in his office. The two men were well dressed in blue suede suits with polished black wingtips. Both had neatly combed hair and beards with stark blue eyes. The warden introduced them to grandpa as Mr. Smith and Mr. Johnson, but did not elaborate who they were or what organization they worked for.

  “No doubt it was some government branch… but I never got confirmation either way.” Grandpa explained.

  Apparently the two men had already struck a deal with the warden, and Grandpa was to be a part of it as well. They explained they were conducting an experiment to test the limits of the human psyche. They explained that all grandpa would have to do was the same thing he’d been doing for 20 years. Guard the cells, and ensure there were no complications with the inmates. The deal came with a substantial financial bonus, one which nearly doubled grandpa’s salary that year, but of course, he knew there would be a catch.

  “The things we do for money…” He just shook his head solemnly as he said it.

  These experiments would go on to be known unofficially as the ‘Seclusion Project’. The idea was a simple one; take five prisoners and put them into solitary confinement indefinitely. Smith and Johnson’s crew would monitor them and conduct research as they saw fit. The two men explained it was important research to determine the harmful effects on the human psyche to further understanding of the brain, but grandpa saw through it.

  “It was cruel… it was inhumane… and by the end it was a crime against humanity. They knew that from the beginning, but they also knew no one would speak on the behalf of those they chose.”

  Five inmates were chosen for the experiment. The warden claimed they volunteered for a reduced sentence but grandpa knew that was a lie. To put it simply; the five chosen were among the worst offenders currently imprisoned.

  Prisoner 1 was a middle-aged white male who had been convicted of multiple counts of aggravated sexual assault against minors. He’d been sentenced to 57 years and had served just 4 up to that point.

  Prisoner 2 was an elderly white male who had been convicted of the rape, murder and mutilation of 6 different female sex workers over the span of 9 years. He’d been given three life sentences, and was the longest currently incarcerated inmate in the entire prison

  Prisoner 3 was a black male responsible for the stabbing murder of an elderly couple and their 7-year-old grandson as a result of a home invasion. He’d been sentenced to capital punishment, and had been on death row for almost 5 years awaiting his fate.

  Prisoner 4 was a middle-aged Hispanic male who had once served as a hitman for a notorious drug gang. He’d been convicted of executing 8 people and disposing of their remains during his tenure, though many believe his body count was much higher.

  Prisoner 5 was actually the only inmate that wasn’t currently incarcerated at my grandpa’s prison. He was brought in from another prison, but grandpa was never able to get ahold of his file to see where he was transferred from or what he was actually in for. He described the guy as a young, very skinny white male with long black hair and ‘evil eyes’. Grandpa said he locked eyes with the guy once, and only once, viscerally rattled by the experience.

  The cells in which the participants were to be housed were in an isolated wing of the prison deep underground. Each cell had to be retrofitted with a number of augmentations which were completed by Smith and Johnson’s crew. It took them almost a full year to do it, but once they were done the cells were unlike any others. Entirely soundproof from the inside, and entirely devoid of light. Cameras equipped with both infrared and night vision lens’ were installed upon the ceiling of each cell to monitor the occupants 24/7.

  Finally, the renovations were completed and the cells were ready to fulfill their grim purpose. One by one grandpa and his team escorted the men into each of the cells. Most went quietly without a word spoken. Grandpa theorized that the men were given promises of commuting their sentences which helped ensure their compliance, but this was never confirmed.

  Inmate 3 talked nonstop throughout the trek to the cell, asking all manner of questions about a variety of things. Grandpa and his men just remained silent. Inmate 5 was mostly silent during the transport as well, his long dark hair covering his face the entire way. At several points grandpa swore he heard the guy giggle under his breath. He said it sounded like a kid’s laugh, and that obviously didn’t make him feel any better. The guy went into his cell without protest, and as his door shut the trials had officially begun.

  All the lights in the block were extinguished, and the outer soundproof doors were shut. Each cell was separated far from one another to prevent the inmates from being able to communicate verbally. From there all the supervising team had to do was wait and watch.

  Grandpa simply went back to his duties then, checking in periodically on Smith and Johnson’s team but never venturing into the cellblock. The inmates were to have no contact with the outside world whatsoever, and no exposure to light of any kind. Small slots in the walls were used to distribute food and water, and the inmates were well fed with good hearty meals unlike the majority of the other inmates in the prison. Grandpa continually emphasized how uncomfortable he was with the whole thing; even from the get go.

  “Why didn’t you say anything?” I bit my tongue as the words left my lips, worried I would offend him. Grandpa just sighed; his shoulders slumped as his lips pursed.

  “It’s hard to speak on behalf of those you detest, even if you know they are being wronged.” There was a profound truth to his words, and it made me take pause as he added another thought.

  “It’s not an acceptable excuse but…” He just trailed off there, shaking his head and sighing.   

  After just a few days of seclusion the inmates were already struggling quite a lot. Inmate 2 had been crying periodically, while 3 showed signs of severe paranoia. The other 3 remained mostly silent. 5 was the most unnerving however, sitting almost entirely motionless for the entire day aside from sleeping. 4 tried to keep himself busy doing calisthenics like push ups and sit ups, while 1 mostly just laid around in various positions slipping in and out of consciousness.

  On the eve of day 5 Inmate 2 had slammed his head into the side of the cell and began bleeding from his nose and mouth. After the impact he fell and convulsed for several seconds on the ground as blood dripped from him. He fell still, and my grandpa anticipated them conducting a medical intervention, but they never did. They just continued to monitor as Inmate 2 was left to his own devices.

  Later that same day and Inmate 3 suddenly screamed. He began scrambling around his cell blind, slamming into walls and babbling incoherently.

  “There’s something in here man! Let me out!” He shouted the words as tears poured from his eyes. He continued freaking out for a few more minutes until tiring himself out. He then collapsed onto the ground panting heavily, staring upward to the top of the cell. He couldn’t have seen it, but my grandpa swears he was staring directly into the feed of the camera.

  Inmate 1 began having conversations with himself, apparently acting as both parties on either side of the conversation. The things he discussed with himself began as asinine even comical at times, but they quickly took a disturbing turn. He seemingly role-played conversations between a young boy and his father, and the things discussed turned grandpa’s stomach. He wouldn’t repeat or even hint at them, but considering why Inmate 1 was imprisoned in the first place I can probably fill in the blanks.

  Inmate 1 then broke down sobbing quietly as he held himself in the fetal position. My grandpa says this was the moment that really made him actually feel something for the inmates, and question what the hell he’d signed up for.

  “These men did horrible things, ain’t no changing that. But even so, you come to realize how everyone has a story. Were they born monsters or were they made monsters? I won’t pretend to understand how these things work, but what I do understand- from one human being to another, is the suffering of life.”

  Things only got worse from there, and outbursts of screaming and sobbing became commonplace amongst all participants minus Inmate 5. Alone in the silent darkness, they had nothing but their own minds to keep them company, and that company was clearly not bringing much comfort.  

  Inmate 4 would often pantomime holding a gun, and seemingly acting out shootouts and conflicts in his cell. His breathing would increase and he’d be moving and ducking around the cell as though he were trying to avoid getting shot. Inmate 3 would shuffle around his cell, flinching randomly and at times collapsing to the ground as though someone had struck him.

  Inmate 2’s condition had continued to deteriorate. Clearly his head wound trauma had likely caused brain trauma, and he would regularly suffer seizures and fits of screaming at the top of his lungs. He refused to eat, and the food he was given began to pile up by the cell door. Some of the prison personnel wanted to retrieve him for medical assistance, but Smith and Johnson wouldn’t allow it. They were told time and time again that no matter what happens to the inmates, they were not to intervene.

  By day 9 Inmate 2 was dead. He’d been laying motionless face down for nearly a full day when his passing was finally confirmed. As they rewound the footage to try and determine the time of death, they noticed something odd.

  As soon as Inmate 2’s chest had stopped moving, Inmate 1 suddenly perked up. He then lifted his head and smiled, extending his hand to wave at something as though he were saying goodbye to an old friend. He of course had no way of communicating with Inmate 2 nor knowing he had passed. It was a weird event, but it was regarded as a simple coincidence.

  Inmate 1 continued to deteriorate after that, spending most of his time just sitting catatonic in his cell. Inmates 3 and 4 also continued to show signs of severe delusions and paranoia. Inmate 4 would randomly burst into fits of screaming as though he were threatening a rival before reverting to hysteric sobbing as he begged to be let out of the cell. At one point he punched the wall full force, shattering his fist into a mangled mess of flesh and bone.

  Contrary to the rest, Inmate 5 hardly ever made a peep. He would sit motionless in his cell for hours, hiding his face as he seemed to meditate. Every once in awhile he’d look directly into the camera lens though; despite not being able to see it. My grandpa said he still gets chills picturing the way the guy smiled, and swears something about him was downright evil.

  “Lemme ask you a question.” Grandpa suddenly interrupted his tale. Behind the smoldering campfire I spied him staring down at his boots, swirling his whiskey in his glass. His eyes then drifted to me, an almost hesitant aura in his eyes.

  “Is it evil to do evil things to evil people?” I thought about it a moment, a cold chill slithering down my spine as I anticipated where this topic was headed. I wish I could say I came up with some profound response, but I didn’t and still don’t have one. In the end I just shrugged and took a swig of my lager. Grandpa’s expression than shifted, as though he were at a similar stalemate himself.

  “I fear the day the world finds an answer to that question.”

  Eventually the team conducting the trial brought medical supplies to Inmate 4. As soon as the guard slid open the access port at the bottom of the door, Inmate 4 lunged for it.

  “Let me out man please! You gotta let me out I’ll do anything.” He tried grabbing at the guard through the port, but the guard managed to retreat away. He then slammed his baton on the man’s hands until he recoiled back inside. The guard flung the tray of food along with the medical supplies in after him and slid the port shut.

  Inmate 4 began to sob hysterically, switching between bargaining and yelling threats for nearly half an hour. He eventually seemed to wear himself out and collapsed in a heap in his cell, but not before muttering one final chilling phrase.

  “Please don’t let it get me.”

  Grandpa ended up working late that night, and just before he clocked out was when it happened. One of the other guards frantically called him to the monitor station. On the feed Grandpa saw Inmate 4 flailing around desperately and screaming. He said it seemed like something was attacking him, but of course, there was nothing else in there.

  By this point the two station guards had already witnessed so many disturbing events that they wanted to intervene and help the guy, but Grandpa overruled them. His chest seemed to deflate as he admitted that, but in the end, all the 3 of them did was watch.

  Inmate 4 continued to wrestle around for several long minutes until finally falling flat on his back. He then began to grasp for his neck and appeared as though he believed someone was straddling his chest and choking him. He began to gurgle and cough, flailing desperately as his eyes bulged from their sockets. In under a minute he let out a soft gasp as the strength drained from his body and he fell still, never to move again.

  Once again, the moment Inmate 4 fell still, Inmate 1 perked up. Just as before he then smiled and waved while staring in the direction of Inmate 4’s cell, despite not knowing where he was housed or even that he was there to begin with.

  Inmate 5 then suddenly perked up from his fetal position. His neck craned backwards, and head angled upwards but his face seemed entirely devoid of emotion.

  “Please don’t let it get me.” He repeated the final words of Inmate 4 in a whisper. He like Inmate 1 had no way of knowing nor hearing Inmate 4, and yet somehow repeated the exact same phrase. As the words left his mouth his lips curled into a wide, almost inhuman smile. Grandpa described it as the ‘look worn only by the most deranged of lunatics’.

  Inmate 5 then erupted into a bellowing laugh which caused everyone in the observatory room to flinch. Grandpa said he was damn near scream-laughing at the top of his lungs as his eyes seemed to bulge out of their sockets. After a good full minute he finally seemed to quiet as his calamitous laugh quieted to a hushed giggle.

  “Please don’t let it get me.” He then turned and once again glared directly into the hidden camera lens in his cell. Grandpa described that moment as feeling like he was staring into the eyes of the devil himself.

  He’d seen enough for that night, but before leaving, Smith caught up with grandpa as he was about to head out. He first made casual conversation with him, before asking him a series of strange questions.

  You ever see anything weird around here?

  How are you sleeping lately?

  You guys get a lot of inspections in this facility?

  Grandpa didn’t say much in response, just shrugging off most of the questions. Smith tried to coat his inquiries in a nonchalant manner, but Grandpa knew better. There was no way of hiding the dread which dripped from his every word, for Grandpa felt it too.

  The following morning grandpa got a call as he was preparing himself for his shift. The call was from a frantic coworker telling him they needed him there ASAP but didn’t clarify what had happened. Grandpa arrived at the prison not long after, and was quickly ushered into the camera room. There he noticed that Inmate 5’s cell was suddenly empty.

  Grandpa asked where Inmate 5 was and the solemn guards just guided his attention to the monitors. They replayed the recording from the previous night at just before 3am. Grandpa watched mystified as one second Inmate 5 was seen sitting idle before suddenly just vanishing. There was no split in the feed, no movement of any kind. Just one second he was there, and the next he was gone.

  Grandpa stared at the other two guards, but neither of them had any explanation for what had just happened. One of them suggested going into the cell to check it out firsthand, but none of them were eager to do that. Instead they waited around spitballing theories until Johnson and Smith arrived along with the warden.

  Grandpa then informed them what had happened and showed them the video from Inmate 5’s cell the previous night. Grandpa said that was the first and only time he ever saw any emotion on their faces, and their reaction clearly conveyed their fear.

  “Lock the prison down now. No one comes in or goes out.” Johnson commanded, and the befuddled warden sounded the alarm. Every single prisoner in the entire complex was returned to their cells. Grandpa and the other guards spent the next 12 hours combing every square inch of the prison. Despite their best efforts, not a single trace of Inmate 5 was found. The search was eventually extended beyond the prison walls, but once again the attempt proved futile.

  Eventually Smith and Johnson ventured in to search the seclusion cellblock themselves. By this point only Inmates 1 and 3 were still alive in their cells. Neither of them reacted as the men entered the block. Inmate 1 continued just rocking back and forth mumbling while Inmate 3 appeared to be asleep.

  Smith and Johnson were in there for nearly an hour before returning defeated and stupefied. They didn’t say much to the others, and by that point the entire staff was exhausted from the day’s events.  Grandpa and his crew were dismissed as the night crew took over. Grandpa said he had some of the worst nightmares of his life that night, and barely slept a wink despite being exhausted.

  When he returned to work the following day he found the other members of his crew looking much the same. They were all summoned into the meeting room with the warden as they awaited their instructions. The warden then informed them that the experiment had been discontinued. The only surviving members of Inmate 1 and 3 were to be returned to general population. Grandpa protested that decision, but was overruled.

  It turns out grandpa was right to be warry, as neither inmate lasted long when back in the prison. Inmate 3 began behaving like a cornered animal, showing signs of paranoia and aggression. He got in multiple fights with other inmates, until one scuffle ended with him getting his head slammed into a bed. He ended up dying from severe cranial hemorrhage not long after.

  Inmate 1 was much more composed, but no less traumatized. He just kept to himself, refusing to eat and isolating himself from everyone. After about a week of his self-imposed starvation grandpa’s team prepared to intervene. They found him dead in his cell the following morning. His body was taken for autopsy, but the coroner could not determine a cause of death.

  Apparently, the fallout from this event caused the former warden of the prison to step down. My grandfather was named the new warden shortly thereafter, but a lot of the other guards ended up leaving as well. For awhile the management was worried about a potential legal investigation, but as time went on there was nothing. They never heard from Smith or Johnson again, and in time people forgot, but grandpa never did.

  He polished off the remainder of his beer and clasped his hands before him as he concluded his story. The campfire had been reduced to smoldering coals by then and grandpa’s once serious demeanor appeared suddenly much more crestfallen.

  “We all do things we’re not proud of, y’know? We all make decisions for what we think is the best option, but sometimes were wrong. I did it for the money; no denying it, but why did they do it? Smith and Johnson… whatever their real names were. Why did they do it?” His grey eyes drifted to me, as though he expected me to answer. More than likely he searched for any answer that could be offered, but I hadn’t one to give.

  “Did they ever find him? That prisoner that disappeared?” Grandpa’s head slowly swiveled side to side as his eyes seemed to deflate.

  “As far as I know he was never seen again.” It was in that moment that I almost found myself skeptical. He’d told his story so well that I very nearly believed it.

  “You’re fuckin with me.” I called him on it, but his face didn’t falter an inch. He slowly turned to me with that cold, ironclad stare that he was renowned for. He didn’t need to say anything in his defense, for his expression told me his words were true, and they had haunted him for a lifetime.

  “How does that happen? How does someone just vanish into thin air?” Grandpa shrugged at the question and massaged the back of his neck. He thought for a moment then smirked, but refused to make eye contact.

  “If you can figure that one out, you let me know.” He chuckled to himself then crossed his arms.

  “There was one report years ago… this young gal was at home alone one night when someone tried to break into her house. Poor thing was scared stiff… and the description she gave of the man she’d seen seemed to match inmate 5.” He met my bewildered stare as I hung on every word.

  “So the cops look around, but can’t find anything. Things calmed down… then about a month later the same young lady vanishes; never seen again, never solved.” He paused once more then scoffed as he adjusted his posture.

  “Course it’s impossible, right? All of it is. That’s what I’d say if someone told me, but yet I was there, I seen it.” He fell silent once more as the two of us contemplated the prospect. I figured it best to allow him to convey his thoughts and so I waited until he spoke again.

  “Maybe it’s best we don’t know, but there was one detail of that troubling story which really spooked me.  There was a message written in blood on the front of her house.” He paused and glanced to me, as if waiting for me to conclude the thought. It struck me then, and a cold chill slithered down my spine.

  “Please don’t let it get me.” I answered, and grandpa nodded solemnly. The two of us just fell silent for a while, contemplating the disturbing story before he spoke again.

  “There’s a phrase I’ve heard before… maybe you have too. ‘Hurt people, hurt people’. People that have been traumatized will traumatize others. Maybe that’s what these things we call ‘demons’ are. Trauma that takes on a life… or existence of it’s own.” He paused, and I contemplated his words once more. It was a frightening thought, but I haven’t the faintest clue how these things work so maybe he’s right.

  “It’s the best explanation I can think of… but what do I know? I’ve screwed up my own life enough that maybe I’m just trying to not hate myself.” His eyes seemed to gloss over, and his lips trembled. He seemed like he so desperately wished to pour his heart out, and for once be vulnerable, but as always he didn’t.

  “Good talk bud, don’t stay up too late.”

  That was all I got; his last parting words before taking his leave. It was the last conversation we ever had, but his words have been with me ever since.

  I didn’t know what to make of his story, but he sure seemed to put a lot of stock in it. It horrified me knowing what he was a part of, but I suppose I shouldn’t be that surprised. I’m sure there’s all sorts of nefarious experiments and trials in the past, but that’s not really what this account was for.

  Grandpa was a complicated man who lived a complicated life. I never knew him well, but I am glad I got to know him a little bit. It makes his sour demeanor throughout the years a little less imposing, and sheds some new light on why he was the way he was. I just hope he found some peace before the end, but after what I heard I’m not sure it worked out that way.

  Grandpa passed away a few weeks after my grandmother did, so I suppose he was right when he shared those words with her. I heard from my aunt later that he’d been found in his favorite chair, a cup of coffee beside him with a single piece of paper in his lap etched in a simple handwritten phrase which rattled me to my core.

My daughter turned 2 yesterday.

The last month she’s gone through what feels like a personality change.

She fights every nap, not only is she fighting it she acts mental in her bed.
Not crying but like just yelling NO NO No and turning over jumping and being crazy but if I don’t let her nap she’s feral she defiantly still needs her nap.

Then she can’t put her self to sleep anymore.
She was always able to self settle from 6-7 months of age.
Now she screeeeama for mumma or baba (dad) when we put her down and we have to sit with her.

-

When she doesn’t want something lie us to clean her face, change her, tell us no or grab something she says “is mine” to put away even if she isn’t using it she will absolutely go mental.
Like head back, scream!! Not an ahhh scream but she will have an angry scream yelling what she wants.

She’s very smart, talks like. 4 year old. Everyone who meets her says both things.

1- woah she’s sooo smart and clever because you can have conversations with her .

(she’s also super interactive like she loves pretending to play doctors, tea and coffee with her toys hide and seek ect)

2- she’s a fire cracker.

- when she’s angry it’s game over. It’s sooo hard not to get frustrated and snap.

- she ends her tantrums fast they’re not meltdowns because she knows what she wants, they are not for no reason but she has a lot of them and she’s super bossy.

-
She has no fear!! Lately her new thing is to step of the slide instead of sitting on her bum or tummy.
And she falls on her face and tries to do it again.
Like wtf?

I get worried because I don’t remember my nieces or nephews having extremee temper tantrums.
I also don’t remember them being so fearless.

I wonder if it’s signs of adhd or if she might be high on the spectrum.


When she’s mad her voice is the loudest ever, I think my neibours can hear her yelling/screaming.
They must thing I’m torturing her.

The head back thing also worried me that she will hit on something hard one day.


Are some toddlers just crazier than others?

She gets away with things sometimes being a toddler but I don’t want her being those 4 year olds that scream down a shopping centre when they don’t get there way.

I don’t give into her either, but that doesn’t teach her.

She’s not behind in anything at all and is so smart so I don’t know if she’s on the spectrum but her emotions are so whack that I really question it.

She honestly starts giggling after a tantrum after she gets her way sometimes (not always but sometimes I just need too for sanity)

The last month she’s gone through what feels like a personality change.

She fights every nap, not only is she fighting it she acts mental in her bed.
Not crying but like just yelling NO NO No and turning over jumping and being crazy but if I don’t let her nap she’s feral she defiantly still needs her nap.

Then she can’t put her self to sleep anymore.
She was always able to self settle from 6-7 months of age.
Now she screeeeama for mumma or baba (dad) when we put her down and we have to sit with her.

-

When she doesn’t want something lie us to clean her face, change her, tell us no or grab something she says “is mine” to put away even if she isn’t using it she will absolutely go mental.
Like head back, scream!! Not an ahhh scream but she will have an angry scream yelling what she wants.

She’s very smart, talks like. 4 year old. Everyone who meets her says both things.

1- woah she’s sooo smart and clever because you can have conversations with her .

(she’s also super interactive like she loves pretending to play doctors, tea and coffee with her toys hide and seek ect)

2- she’s a fire cracker.

- when she’s angry it’s game over. It’s sooo hard not to get frustrated and snap.

- she ends her tantrums fast they’re not meltdowns because she knows what she wants, they are not for no reason but she has a lot of them and she’s super bossy.

-
She has no fear!! Lately her new thing is to step of the slide instead of sitting on her bum or tummy.
And she falls on her face and tries to do it again.
Like wtf?

I get worried because I don’t remember my nieces or nephews having extremee temper tantrums.
I also don’t remember them being so fearless.

I wonder if it’s signs of adhd or if she might be high on the spectrum.


When she’s mad her voice is the loudest ever, I think my neibours can hear her yelling/screaming.
They must thing I’m torturing her.

The head back thing also worried me that she will hit on something hard one day.


Are some toddlers just crazier than others?

She gets away with things sometimes being a toddler but I don’t want her being those 4 year olds that scream down a shopping centre when they don’t get there way.

I don’t give into her either, but that doesn’t teach her.

She’s not behind in anything at all and is so smart so I don’t know if she’s on the spectrum but her emotions are so whack that I really question it.

She honestly starts giggling after a tantrum after she gets her way sometimes (not always but sometimes I just need too for sanity)

I just want to make a post to show that some guys do like smaller boobs! And, if you want, I'm happy to chat, too!

About me: 
- 28 years old
- 6 ft tall
- halfie 🇺🇸 🇵🇭 
- average-to-fit body type (SFW/wholesome pics on my profile!)
- big fan of good coffee shops, fantasy books, live music, and silly questions like this

Ok, a lot of women I know are self-conscious about their size. So I wanted to make a post like this because, in my opinion, small boobs are underrated!

It's funny to see so many posts assuring men that size doesn't matter, but so few posts offering that same kind of affirmation to women. Really, there are a lot of guys - including myself - who even prefer small boobs! 

Don't get me wrong, of course. Big ones are nice, too. But I honestly just like smaller ones more, and I'm sure I'm not alone. 

So, if you're a lady with itty-bitties, know that small chests are beautiful! And, if you want, feel free to message on here!

1h9z8y7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1h9z8y7/nobody_believes_that_i_was_kidnapped_by_fairies/,Nobody believes that I was kidnapped by fairies on Christmas Eve.,"It was always the same words, the same slightly upturned lips like they were trying not to smile. I always expected that response, but not so passively, like dragging a blunt knife down my spine. 

Nobody believed me. 

A year since I was kidnapped by fairies and left behind while my friends were taken away, and I was slowly losing my mind between giving into my own delusions and gaslighting myself into believing I’d had some kind of psychotic break and none of it was real. 

Dr. Casey was my latest in the long line of psychologists assigned to me since my so-called mental breakdown. 

Sitting in front of me, her smile was patient and her eyes were trying to be sincere. I liked her office. It was a lot cosier than the others. The one in Boston had walls that made me feel like I was in a psych ward. Sickly green, resembling barf, with too-bright lights and a TV in the waiting room that only played ancient game shows with zero volume. 

Dr. Casey’s office was minimalist with a desk and a bookshelf. The decor was warm, purplish blue, an outdated laptop sitting in front of her. Unlike my other therapists, she seemed… human. 

While the others had clinical white offices and scary looking posters on the wall bearing mental health disorders and human trafficking warnings, Dr Casey had stained coffee mugs and ancient comic books piled on top of each other, a dogeared map sitting on top.

She chewed on her pen between writing, tapping her feet to a beat only she could hear. 

Which was familiar and relatable. 

My therapist was a beautiful woman, kind, brown flecked eyes and velvet coloured hair tied into an untidy ponytail. When she leaned forward and met my gaze, I found myself taken aback by her natural beauty.

She smelled of fresh pine and lemon, and had a smile that wanted to help. 

Dr. Casey made me feel comfortable. 

I thought I could tell her everything. 

So, I started talking. 

Hesitantly at first, but the more I was speaking and actually letting everything out, all of this fear and frustration and anger I had been bottling up for a whole year.

Initially, she seemed interested when I told her the basics, nodding and making comments to assure me she was listening. 

I started telling my story as normally as possible. My flight was cancelled on Christmas Eve, and because of my age I had no choice but to join my fellow young travellers inside the unaccompanied minors lounge. 

Dr. Casey kept smiling and scribbling in her notebook until I got into the meat of my trauma. Why I couldn't fully look her in the eye, and even a year later, I still struggled to sit still.

My hands were always wandering, either delving into my lap or playing with stray thread on my jeans, my fingers steepling together, constantly  clammy. I could never fully suck air into my lungs during a therapy session. 

I had an odd posture, leaned over myself, my lungs crushed. 

There was never enough air for me to breathe, and my body was constantly too light, like at any moment I would lose contact with the ground all together.

This kind of thing was better to explain by saying, “I had a psychotic break” but I thought I could talk to someone who would listen. Who wouldn't call me crazy. 

I always felt small and childish, hating the words coming from my mouth. 

Eighteen years old, and I still felt so much younger. “I was kidnapped,” I told her, a lump growing in my throat. 

Dr. Casey’s smile faded, eyes darkening. 

I noticed her fingers tighten around the pen. She began to write before pausing, her gaze snapping to me. “Kidnapped?”

I could already see the cogs in her head turning, ready to make phone calls and offer support– maybe even call the police. It's not like I didn't look like a kidnapping victim. 

I was sickly pale from malnourishment, my hair hung in tangled streaks in front of my face, and I hadn't bathed in days. 

But my failure to meet basic hygiene was for a completely different reason. I didn't know how to tell her I couldn't wash or brush my hair, and I couldn't force food down my throat. They wouldn't let me. 

When I spoke of them, she leaned forward with wide, sympathetic eyes that were going to listen, urging me to take my time. 

She thought they were human, an abusive family member or significant other. That was until I dropped my gaze, shuffling uncomfortably on my chair. 

It had been the same leather chair for three weeks, and I still couldn't get comfortable. 

The upholstery felt wrong grazing the backs of my jeans and I had been nervously picking on it since starting my session. I had been skating around the subject of my depressive episodes. 

Because when I eventually let loose and went into detail, I always lost them. I lost my therapists with one single word. 

“Kidnapped,” I said again, “By fairies.”

Dr. Casey stopped writing, her lip twitching slightly. She lifted her head. 

“You were kidnapped by fairies,” her brow shot into her hairline. 

Dr. Casey’s expression crumpled into what might have been sympathy before confusion and amusement took over. 

Before I could respond, she cleared her throat a little too harshly, and spoke the words my last five therapists had said with the exact tone. “Miss Jaimison, aren't you a little old to still believe in fairies?” 

Yes, I was. 

I didn't even believe in them when I was a little kid, and now I was being hunted by them. In the space of a year, fairies, and to an extent, Santa Clause were real. 

Dr. Casey sighed when I didn't reply.  “Okay then, Ruby,” she continued to scribble in her notebook, and I wondered if she was making a note to send me for an MRI. 

Her smile was still polite, though a little strained. Just like the others. 

“Why don't you talk me through what happened?” 

I started to, but she cut me off. “Miss Jaimison, there is nothing wrong with disguising your mental trauma with preferred fantasy. It's common with young people.”

Fantasy? 

Was she fucking serious?

I knew the difference between reality and fantasy. 

For the last several months, both had blurred into each other, enveloping me completely. To other people, fantasy was what they saw on TV or read in books. 

The fae folk, beings of light and beauty hiding amongst the flowers. 

Which was the fantasy I grew up with. 

That fantasy, however, had been haunting me since I escaped my fate to become an heir of the kingdom. 

It existed in the tricks that woke me up at night, open windows when I was sure I'd shut them, and poison ivy between my sheets, my possessions being whisked away. That was a warning.

When I refused to submit, they bled inside my brain and made me question my own reality. I coughed up my own blood and teeth, lost clumps of my hair.

They wouldn't let me shower, or brush my hair, or eat. 

They were constantly there, whispering and giggling in my ear, murmuring nursery rhymes in their language, their songs all entangled with my lost friends' names. These little bastards tugged on my hair when nobody was watching, a symphony of childish giggles entwined in my skull. 

“It's not… fantasy,” I spoke coolly and calmly, but in the corner of my eye, I could see sharp flickers of movement. “It's real,” I whispered. “I was taken to a different world where fairies exist.” 

She nodded, continuing to write. “Okay, and would you say you were awake during this, uh… this venture? You said you were falling asleep in an airport terminal, correct?” Dr. Casey nodded at me with a smile. “Do you think maybe you experienced a vivid fever dream?” 

“No.” I swatted at my own face again. I could hear giggles. They were laughing at me. “No, I was definitely awake,” I spoke through gritted teeth. “I wasn't alone either. There was a group of kids with me, and there were these screens that…” 

I caught hold of myself. “I know it sounds crazy, but,” I struggled with my hands, stuffing them into my lap. “These screens… the ones in the room they took us to. They hypnotised kids into thinking they didn't have parents.” 

“Mmm hmm.” Dr. Casey lifted her gaze. “So, are we talking, like, mind control?”

I nodded. “Yes. There was this Christmas themed animation playing, and it put my friend into a weird trance.” I felt my own secondhand embarrassment, resisting the urge to rake my nails down my face. 

“It made him think he was an orphan. Just like everyone else. I saw it too, and I can't explain it.” my hands were wandering again, this time streaking through filthy strands of my hair. 

I could feel them tugging my scalp. It was an endless tug of war with them. 

Still though, thinking back to their influence on me, that for a single moment with my eyes captured by their magic, my mind drowned by their light and lullabies, I thought I was an orphan myself. 

It was so vivid. I had been suffocated with false memories of an orphanage I never attended; wooden bunk beds and children that were not real. 

These things had planted fake thoughts, fake feelings and memories inside my brain, enchanting me and luring me in, before I had snapped out of it with the help of Levi and Thalia. 

I didn't realise I was choking all of that out, words tangling from my lips, my voice splintering, until I was handed a tissue, and I swiped at my eyes. 

I didn't mean to say any of that out loud, but saying their names, or at least revisiting the memories I had tried to suppress, was a surprising weight off my chest. 

Dr. Casey continued writing. She was scribbling way too much to just be making notes. “Okay, and who was this friend?” she looked up at me, lips quirked into a smile. She wasn't laughing at me. 

This was a sympathy smile. She thought I was fucking crazy. 

I tried to lean across the desk to see what she was writing, but she easily hid her notebook from my prying eyes. 

“Was he an, um, a ‘fairy person’ too?”

“Jude Whitlock,” I whispered. 

His name didn't feel real or right on my tongue, almost like he didn't exist anymore. 

“No. He was a human, and they took him along with the others.” 

I played with the thread on my jeans. 

“He was the worst affected. I think because he, uh, he already felt detached from his parents. So, it wasn't hard for them to wipe them from his memory.” 

I straightened up in my seat. “Jude didn't have a good relationship with his Mom.”

Dr. Casey cocked a brow. “Oh?” 

“Yeah.  He said he only got to spend time with her two days a year.”

She paused writing, tapping her pen. “And you haven't seen him since?”

I shook my head. “No. The last time I saw him, he was completely under their control.”

“Their… fairy mind control?” Dr. Casey cleared her throat. Something flickered in her expression. I saw her write separation followed by a question mark. “And did you say the other kids…” she flicked back through the pages of her notebook. 

“Levi and Thalia. Were they taken too?”

Nodding, I squeezed my eyes shut. “Yes. But they were replaced by fake versions. I think they're called changelings, though there are also these things called Strays. Who are human kids turned fae that the Kingdom gives back.”

“Uh-huh.” she chewed on her pen. “So, to go over, your human friends were kidnapped by fairies and replaced with…” she nodded at her notebook, “replicas of them, that are called Strays.”

I shook my head. “No, the Strays are different. They're not wanted, and given back to the human world. They're previously kidnapped kids no longer wanted.”

She met my gaze. “And have you met a Stray?”

I did. 

When I was saved by the kind fae who brought me back, there were two Strays in the car.

I still remembered their battered and bruised faces, skeletal figures and haunted eyes. I remembered the markings on the boy's head from his crown, his flesh shredded and burned, sliced and ripped apart. 

The slits in the girl's back, where a semblance of wings may have been before being cruelly sliced away. I never saw them again. 

There were hunters on earth who specifically went for Stray kids. I was told they were  worth millions to humans. “I did,” I admitted. “But they ran away before I could talk to them.”

“Ahh, of course. They ran away.” 

I stuffed my fists in my lap, trying to breathe. “You think I'm crazy.” 

Dr. Casey dropped her pen with a sigh, her gaze flicking to me. “Well, at least you're self aware. Honestly, this all sounds a little far fetched. I am not supposed to be harsh with my patients, but you are an exceptional case.” she inclined her head. 

“Ruby, how exactly did you get it into your head that you're being hunted by fairies? This world,” she glanced at her notebook. “All of these  things. Your friends being kidnapped and uh… half fairy kids spirited away, child eating plants, magical doorways and stray kids being hunted down. It’s not really real, is it?” 

Here we go.

“Ruby, the world is boring. And I don't blame you for creating this world inside your head.""

Dr. Casey offered me another sympathetic smile. 

“You are an intelligent young woman and you don't seem to be suffering from either neurological trauma or PTSD.” she tapped her manicure on the edge of her desk, rechecking over her notes. 

“Do you think you may have an overactive imagination? These friends you talk about.” I watched her fingers drum a single beat. 

“Levi, Jude, and Thalia. Are they perhaps people you strayed away from?""

Dr. Casey talked with her hands a lot. “It's possible that you have created a fantasy of sorts, to cope with losing their company.” she leaned back, her smile a lot more patient and understanding than all of the others. 

But she still didn't believe me. 

I think those words were what broke me. Not telling me I was too old to believe in fairies, or implying I had psychosis. She was telling me friends I lost were not real.

Just delusions of my mind. And if they were real, they were past friendships I was dwelling on and clinging onto.

Something splintered inside me. “I can't breathe,” I managed to grit out. “I feel like I've lost half of my breath since coming back, and sometimes I can't suck in air,” my voice broke. “It feels like I'm suffocating.” 

My therapist cocked her head. “That sounds a lot like asthma, Ruby.” she leaned forward. “Do you think maybe you're suffering from panic attacks?”

“They're not panic attacks!” I surprised myself with a yell. “They stole my breath!”

“Who stole your breath?” 

“The fairies!” I swallowed my words, clawing out my hair, pulling it from a particularly violent tugging match between two sets of tiny hands. “I mean fae... I think they're…referred to as fae?”

“Yes, I believe that is what they are called.” 

Her deadpan tone was starting to get under my skin. 

“Can't you see them?” I hissed out, holding out a strand of my hair. “They're right here!”

Dr. Casey’s mouth hung open, like she was struggling to coerce words. Before she could speak though, her gaze snapped to behind me, her expression twisting. “Liam, this is a private session!” 

I twisted around in my chair, meeting eyes with a boy who was my age. 

Hiding behind a bed of dark blonde curls, his eyes were wide with terror, parted lips moving like he was trying to speak, but failing. 

His gaze was frenzied, almost feral. It only took a single glance where intricate lines of ink danced across his forehead, like a child had been using his face as a canvas, for me to know what he was. 

Dr.  Casey was blind to the state of him, and he knew I'd noticed it, quickly yanking the hood of his sweater over his head. “Shut the door! I'm with a patient. I'll be with you in a moment.” 

The boy shot me a look, like he was trying to speak, before nodding and stumbling back into the waiting room, quietly shutting the door behind him. 

“Please excuse Liam, he's one of my patients. He doesn't know the meaning of privacy.” My therapist turned back to me, her expression relaxing. “Have you spoken to your parents about any of this? Do they offer their support?”

“No.”

I didn't mean to raise my voice, but I felt like I was being ripped apart inside. 

Parents were a sore subject. 

Just because I escaped the kingdom didn't mean I wasn't replaced too. 

There was a girl with my face living with my Mom and Dad. A girl with too-pale skin, a playfulness in eyes full of mischief.

I watched her meet my father at the airport. Ever since then, my life had been on a downward spiral. I choked up bloodstained flowers daily. I lost my teeth. There were vines growing at the back of my throat, markings I couldn't explain on my legs and arms. Like I had already been branded as theirs. 

Marked for the hunt. 

“I’m not crazy,” I whispered, trying to ignore my hair being yanked and pulled from side to side by tiny fingers. 

“I’ve lost my parents to a thing that looks exactly like me,” I hissed out. “I've lost half of my breath. There is a constant chokehold around my neck squeezing breath from my lungs. They're slowly killing me.” 

When I jumped up, Dr. Casey flinched slightly, like I was going to attack her.

“I'm constantly light on my feet,” I continued. “I feel like I'm floating. Like I'm never really touching the floor.”

Sinking back into my chair, I couldn't resist a sob. “They send me… warnings.” 

Dr. Casey hummed. “Warnings? Okay, and do you have them here with you?”

I thought back to the confused look on my Boston therapist’s face when I tried to hand her an old piece of parchment I'd found glued to my window with the remnants of my roommate's cat. 

The parchment was an invite into the kingdom and to accept my crown as an adopted heir to the court. 

The calligraphy was always graceful, beautiful, scrawled in human blood. 

I dropped my gaze, losing all my bravado. 

“It's…it's invisible to adults.”

Risking a glance, I could see the muscles in my therapist’s face twitching. Casey’s lip curled. I was losing her. “These warnings that are haunting you are… invisible to adults?” 

She cleared her throat. “Okay, so your kidnapped friends have been replaced by fairy replicas, and you are being haunted by a fairy kingdom, but their warnings are completely invisible to adults.”

I thought back to Liam. “And what they do to you,” I added. The markings and brandings. It's all invisible to adults.”

I could tell Dr. Casey was losing her patience. Still though, I was surprised she held out this long. The Boston therapist gave up at the start. “Miss Jaimison, you are eighteen years old which is classified as an adult.” I jumped when she dropped her pen on her desk. “Go home, Ruby.”

The woman nodded at me to stand up, and I did, grabbing my bag. “I don't think we need to continue this conversation.” 

Before I could protest, her phone rang, and she picked it up. 

“Yes,” My therapist lowered her voice, gesturing for me to shoo like I was a rabid raccoon. “Uh huh. Yes. Perfect condition. Yeah, I'm in the possession of…” she trailed off, meeting my gaze. 

“It.”

Dr Casey cleared her throat, irritation pricking in her eyes. “Ruby, I believe we are finished talking. Have a nice evening.” she went back to her phone. “Yes, I've got it with me. Mmm. Yeah, like I'd said, zero scratches or marks.”

When she collapsed into hissed whispers, I strode towards the door, only for something to catch my eye. On her bookshelf were tiny wooden fairies bearing wide smiles and intricate wings.

These things looked cute and playful. They looked nothing like the beings that kidnapped my friends. I couldn't resist turning around, my gut twisting. 

“Do you collect those things?”

Dr. Casey turned to me, her phone still glued to her ear. “Sorry, what was that?”

I pointed to the figures. “Those fairies. Do you collect them?”

Her gaze flitted to the figures, lips curving into a smile. “You could say that,” she pointed to her phone. “I'm actually in the middle of selling them right now, so if you wouldn't mind…” 

Before I could answer, I was already being escorted out of her office, the door slamming in my face. In the waiting room, the boy from earlier was sitting cross legged on a plastic chair. 

My heart leapt into my throat. I knew it wasn't him, but the way he was sitting, tense, dark eyes following me across the waiting room, like a caged animal, he reminded me of Jude, bearing the same scowl and eyes that did not trust easily.

Jude was a private school kid I'd met in the airport, a boy who didn't want anything to do with me until our plane was cancelled. When we were taken into the kids lounge, I lost him, his mind already captured by the hypnotising screens. Jude mentioned a lost sister.

Which made me wonder if there was more to him than I'd thought. 

The last thing I said to him was reminding him he had a mother and a sister. But he had been far too gone to hear me, enveloped in their fairy dust. 

Unlike Jude, who previously had a destination, his parents house, this kid looked tragically lost. He purposely bowed his head to hide himself, but I already knew who and what he was. 

I could see exactly where his disgraced crown had sat on top of thick blonde curls. 

“You're a Stray.” I said, folding my arms. 

“Go away.” He shied away from me, shuffling back like a wild animal. The boy pressed his head into his lap. “They already know your name,” he sniffled.

His voice was rough. I could hear the turmoil and torture he had gone through. I wondered how long Liam had been inside the kingdom. From the way he was acting, he must have been young. “You can't run from them.”

A shiver skittered down my spine. “How did you escape?”

Liam looked up, his lips splitting into a grotesque smile of razor sharp teeth. 

“I was replaced.”

I nodded slowly, swatting at a tiny ball of golden light hovering in front of my eyes. Liam’s gaze followed its manic dance, his eyes narrowing. “My friends were taken,” I said, “Is there any chance they could be given back?”

Liam cocked his head. “Do they have your friends' names?”

I thought back to the list of naughty and nice. 

Yes. They had their full names. 

“Yes,” I said in a hiss of breath. “But–” 

“Liam?” Dr. Casey’s door flew open, her head poking out. I tried to ignore the boy flinching, the way his body seemed to lurch back. “Would you like to come in?” her gaze snapped to me. 

“Ruby. Go home please.”

I glanced at Liam, who looked panicked. 

“Do you… want to go in there?” I asked him. 

“Liam.” Dr. Casey’s tone hardened. “Come on, what did we talk about? I told you I’m going to help you, remember?”

He nodded with a quiet, “Yes” before ducking his head and following her into the office. When the door clicked shut behind them, I thought back to the miniature fairies sitting on her bookshelf. 

I hovered outside the door for a few more minutes, before swiftly leaving. I was on my way down the stairs to the reception area, when two men shoved past me on their way up. 

Dr. Casey told me to go home, so I did.

That night I woke up coughing up blood stained flowers, vines stuck between my teeth and blossoming at the back of my throat. They weren't just haunting me mentally, they were playing with my body. 

There was something there, twisted and sandwiched, stuffed down my throat. 

Standing in front of a mirror with tweezers, I forced the two blades into the back of my mouth, pinching a single vine. 

When I pulled it from my lips, my throat ruptured and I choked up blood tinged petals, leaves, and a growing tendril of earth entangled with a single strand of hair. Thalia. Her long red hair stuck in my memory, and now it was clogging my faucet and shower drain.

Thalia’s hair was the first real warning that they were coming. 

Quickly followed by a shred of Levi’s hoodie.

And then, Jude's private school sweater. 

It was always pieces of them, nothing was ever whole. All I got were torn remnants and fragments of what had been real. It felt like a tease, like they were dangling my friends in front of me. Cutting them apart, piece by piece. 

Until nothing remained. 

I grew sicker. Paler. Pulling scarlet streaked flowers from my lips and coughing up clumps of Thalia’s hair became a daily occurrence. I was barely conscious in class when the air around me suddenly stilled, a streak of shivers spiderwebbing down my bones. 

I could barely concentrate on the class itself, beforehand, white noise screaming in my ears. Now it was too silent. 

Like all the sound had been sucked into a vacuum. Even the sounds of light typing, brief conversations and pages flipping over. Everything had come to an eerie stop. Lifting my head, it wasn't just the sound. Movement had come to halt too. 

My professor stood at the front of the class. He was frozen, glued to the spot. 

But his eyes were still moving, frantically snapping left and right.

Around me, my classmates were paralysed to their seats. 

The ponytailed blonde next to me was mid-drinking her water. She was frozen, while water sloshed down her throat. 

I could sense that she was choking, her cheeks turning red and then purple. But she couldn't move. The sound of water filling her gut, her stomach expanding, sent my own catapulting into my throat. 

It took me a disorienting moment to realise the wave that had enveloped my class had taken me too. Glued to my chair, I caught a flash of movement in the corner of my eye. There was a shadow moving down the aisle, a figure drowned in light so bright I couldn't see a face. 

When a sharp breath sounded next to me, and the girl with the water dropped to the ground, I thought it was just her. 

But when it came again, another hiss of breath, and then another, students collapsing like dominoes, I knew exactly what was happening. It was pulling their breath from their lungs, teasing it, before tearing it from their lips. 

Bodies continued to drop around me. I could sense it, almost see it, wisps of dancing white being dragged from parted lips and disappearing into nothing. 

The lights flickered above me. 

I saw feet moving toward me, dancing down the steps. 

Closer. 

Under dull light, I glimpsed the torn remnants of a navy blue sweater clinging to a skeletal figure. The closer he came to me, I felt my own breath leave my lungs and squirm its up my throat, forced through my lips. But it didn't leave me.

Not yet.

When he stopped in front of me, the lingering students around me toppling off of their chairs, he teased my breath, once, and then twice, holding it between my frozen lips, letting me slowly suffocate. 

When my professor dropped, the lights brightened. The figure was no longer a shadow, a being that was once human. It still bared a human face, remnants of its old self. I wasn't sure what to call him. Beautiful, or maybe horrifying. 

I couldn't tear my gaze from his skin, flesh that had been battered and burned, branded and used as a canvas. 

There were intricate lines of black dancing his cheeks, just like Liam. But while Liam’s had been old, faded, his were wet and fresh. I could still see the gleam, imagine the dripping paintbrush. 

There was so much wrong with him. Malnourished cheeks and skin so pale and brittle, like the pages of a book. 

And yet I still found a sick sense of beauty, that grotesque and breathtaking beauty I remembered from their world. 

I had nightmares of him being twisted and contorted into one of them. But it was real. I had aged since our kidnapping. 

A whole year had gone by. Jude, however, was still frozen at sixteen years old. 

Dark brown curls adorned with flowers and thorns, a crown of bone sitting on top of his head. I could see sharp pieces of bone sliced into his flesh, old and new rivers or red streaking down his face. 

His lips carved into a feral smile that greeted me. 

No longer human and forever sixteen years old, I still recognised him. Jude suited his crown. 

He suited his smile, too-pointy teeth and eyes filled with mischief. 

Jude never had human parents, or at least ones that cared about him. Maybe that was why he had accepted his fate. 

Accepted his crown.

After all, what 16 year old human boy wouldn't want to be the heir to a fairy court? 

What he didn't suit, was the bruises and burns, his body twisted into a plaything for the Kingdom. Jude looked both human and fae, twin slits in his back, flaps of flesh resembling their sick idea of wings. I waited for him to take my breath. 

He did, tearing it to and from my lips like I was his own personal toy. 

When he was bored, Jude reached out his hand, finally, his eyes lighting up. 

I pretended not to see the scalding marks covering his arms. 

The rugged flesh on the backs of his hands. 

“Ruuuuuuuuby.”

From the look on his face, and the whispered giggles in my ear, him laughing with the fireflies buzzing around me tugging on my hair, I didn't have a choice. He made that clear when he violently ripped breaths from my lungs, one by one. I accepted his hand when I could move again, gulping in oxygen. 

Jude didn't speak to me. But he did speak to the things still clinging to my hair, giggling in their tongue twisting language. We left the room, his claw-like fingernails digging into my skin. 

He told me my classmates were not harmed.

However, they were missing a significant chunk of their breath. 

“Your sister,” I managed to get out, when he pulled me through the dark. I didn't even notice the passage of time. He could have had my breath for hours. 

Something rancid crept up my throat, and I spat out another explosion of red. 

More of Thalia’s hair stuck to my lips, glued to my chin. 

“Did you find her?”

He surprised me with an inhuman grin that was not his, a glitter in his eyes that was both insanity and glee. 

Jude had their exact mannerisms, their twitching smiles and gleeful eyes. He was a bigger version of the fireflies trying to rip my hair from my scalp, laughing along with them. “What sister?”

I was wrong.

I thought Jude still had lingering humanity. 

But he was completely gone. 

I knew where he was taking me. Jude took me back to the nightmare world that I had been told multiple times wasn't real. The world filled with child-eating plants, and the wooden cage filled with human children that I had escaped. 

I didn't feel as light back in their world. 

I felt like I could breathe again, my bare feet grazing the floor. I wasn't expecting the reception Jude got when he dragged me through streets threaded with plants and vines, beings with painfully beautiful faces and horrifying twisted and contorted bodies dropped to their knees in front of him. 

The ground became harder to tread through, vines and flowers with minds of their own twisting around my ankles. Jude pulled me through them, laughing. 

Quickly, it turned to bones we were wading through. 

Humans. 

These things didn't just forcefully adopt  people. 

They murdered them, proudly brandishing their horrified looking faces. 

Stumbling after Jude, I scanned each kill. 

Levi and Thalia. They couldn't be here, right? 

Looking back, I think part of me wished they were. The palace was not what I was expecting; a building made purely of human bone and entangled vines, a towering structure standing over the court.

The guards standing in front of the doors bowed when Jude stepped through the door. While the exterior of the palace was exactly what I was expecting inside a fae court, the interior surprised me. 

I could tell the fae stole not just children, but human possessions. 

Glittering chandeliers hung from the ceiling, a staircase made purely of rose quartz.

The ground was made up of patchwork human flooring, carpet and marble with pieces of plastic, woven with thick greenery. In front of me loomed two thrones made up of entangled vine, the King and Queen, adorned in the remnants of children, blood and bone decorating them.

The Queen wore an adult human skull, velvet coloured hair framing a heart shaped face. Her clothes were patchwork, a dress made of white silk. 

She looked human at first glance, before her features were narrowing, like she was screwing with my perception. 

Jude lowered himself in front of them, yanking me with him.

Kneeling in front of the king, I could still see the skeletal smile of the victim sitting on top of his head. 

I could see exactly where their head had been savagely severed from their torso. 

His clothes were made up of flesh that had been dried and stitched together. I had to bow my head, swallowing a shriek. 

“He's wearing someone's skull,” I managed to breathe, my chest aching. 

Jude shot me a glare, and there was a splinter of his human self. “Be quiet.” 

Oh, so he could speak. 

The Queen stood, and spoke in a language I could not understand. 

Looking at Jude, at the knot between his brow, he could hear what she was saying in perfect clarity. To me, however, it was a colourful tongue twister language. “She’s asking all of her children to present themselves to her,” he murmured. 

“What does that mean?” 

“That something big is about to happen,” Jude  hummed. “Stand up. The Queen asks her children to present themselves to her only three times a day. Dawn, high eve, and late eve.” 

“What?”

He didn't reply, the sound of footsteps taking me off guard. They took their places next to the King and Queen.

I recognised Levi immediately, still dressed in the remnants of his Adventure Time sweater. 

His hair was overgrown, skin blistered and burned resembling a Stray. 

Unlike Jude's, his crown looked like it had been forced onto his head, splinters of bone glued to his skull, threaded vines and flowers adorning his hair. Levi’s eyes were empty of that glitter I remembered, when he called fake Santa a meth head. 

His smile was too wide. I could see blisters on his mouth where his lips had been sewn shut. I didn't want to see it, but I saw the exact transformation, slight points in ears hiding behind thick reddish curls, his face narrower, malnourished cheeks sticking out.

Following those same inky black lines marking his face, I wondered if male fae bore them. Just from looking at Levi Parish, the boy had fought a battle he had lost, ending in him bearing a crown forced on his head, and vacant eyes. 

Next to him…Thalia. 

She was perhaps the most transformed from the three. Her naked back had been twisted into something inhuman. 

I could see where her spine used to be, now something was growing from her flesh, something writhing up and down her skin, trying to burst out. Thalia’s hair was entangled in flowers and vines, a crown of thorn sitting on top of her head, instead of glued on like the boy's. 

Half of her pretty face had been scorched, and then clawed away, ugly flaps of flesh where her cheek was supposed to be. 

I could still see the claw marks on her neck, streaks of red. 

And yet, just like the boys, her grin was wide. 

The smile I knew was gone.

Looking at all three of them, it hit me that my friends weren't heirs to the throne. 

They were toys. 

Playthings.

Canvases for fae children. 

“Mother.” Jude lifted his head, smiling wide. “Father.” 

“Ruby.” The Queen’s voice was melodic. She rose gracefully. “I am so glad you finally came to your senses.”

I lifted my head.  “I had no choice.”

“Careful.” Jude breathed. “The last time I spoke back to them, I got the flesh melted off of my back.”

The Queen's lips curled. “Human child, do speak louder. You are mumbling.”

Instead of responding, I bowed my head. I was speaking before I could stop myself. “I’d like to… make a request.” 

“And what is that?” The Queen asked, tilting her head. “Speak clearly, Ruby.”

“An exchange.” I forced out. ""I would like to request that I exchange myself, Thalia Wednesday, Levi Parish and…” 

I struggled to speak, the words tangled on my tongue. My gaze flicked to Jude’s bruised knees, the thorns wrapped around this neck which were constantly squeezing breath from his lungs. “And Jude Whitlock.” I spat out. “For four human children of the same age.""

I stopped when Jude grabbed my arm, his eyes suddenly fearful. Terrified. His lips were twisted, failing to form words.

“What are you doing?!” His expression screamed.

“I accept.” 

I risked lifting my head, and she was smiling. 

“Ruby, you are yet to become my full blooded daughter, and you are already pledging yourself to rounding up human children!” She spoke with a manic giggle. 

“My, now how could I reject an offer like that? We are already in a deal for fifteen children this Christmas. Five more would be a luxury. Oh, the things we could do.""

Her words sent slithers down my spine. “No.” I said. “No, I didn’t mean—“

My feet left the ground, and I was choking, suddenly. The breath had been sucked from my lungs, and I felt them.. invisible fingers wrapped around my neck, squeezing. I was aware of my body hovering several feet off of the ground. 

The Queen sat back down. 

“You did not mean what?”

“I…”

“I don’t think you’ve been educated in our laws,” she said smoothly. “You do not speak my children's names. Do so again, and I will rip out your tongue.”

A fountain of red escaped my mouth, and I could feel something sharp winding its way around my neck. Like claws it stabbed into my flesh. I felt my head spin, my vision blur. I was going to die, I thought. I was going to fucking die at eighteen years old, when my replica was out there living my life— and there I was choking on my own blood.

When I dropped to the ground, the Queen cleared her throat. “Speak clearly. You didn’t mean what?”

I couldn’t speak. The words were shredded in my throat.

“She didn’t mean to bad mouth you, Mother.” Jude hissed out. “The… human child has a sharp tongue, and I ask just this once. Please spare her request, and her stupidity. What Ruby meant was a gift,” he said. “She will gift you four human children in exchange for your kindness and hospitality. As well as your forgiveness  and a seat in the court.”

He wrenched me to my feet and dragged me in a bow. 

My chest was aching, blood dripping from my mouth and chin. But I bowed. 

I bowed three times. And each one was progressively more humiliating. 

When my face hit the ground for the third time, the Queen cleared her throat.

“I accept!” her eyes lit up. “Ruby, you must be so hungry! Please! Eat!”

A table was brought in filled with fruit and berries, and further down the table, a human teenager skewered on a stick. His mouth was wide open, teeth pulled out, a bright red apple stuffed inside.

That was when my mind started to slowly break apart. 

When the half human, half fae heirs began to rip flesh from bone, giggling manically, chewing through splattered scarlet dripping from the table. Jude handed me a goblet and told me to drink. It tasted like strawberry milk.  

The windchimes started in my head, growing louder until I was laughing myself, choking on a scream trying to claw its way up my throat. 

When my crown was lowered onto my head, pricks of glass and bone cutting into my scalp, warm blood slipping down my temple, I felt dizzying happiness and unbridled fear, my lips splitting into a grin that wasn't mine. 

I was home. 

I don't know how long it had been since the feast. 

Since the crown on my head stopped hurting, and blood started like tasting like milkshakes.

I was dancing, a whirlwind of color around me, dancing inside the wooden cage, dancing for my life. If my audience did not like my dancing, then I would be punished. I was twirling around and around, my thoughts cotton candy, until I stamped on something. 

Something…sharp. 

Something that went straight through my bare foot. 

A nail. 

The pain was enough to wake me up, and when I was blinking rapidly, drinking in the pooling red I had been dancing in, a river of blood staining my legs, did I look up and see a familiar face peering through the wooden bars. 

His crown of thorns was still glued to his head but I could see claw marks where he'd tried and failed to pull it off. 

Levi. 

He was awake.

1h9z8r6,https://www.reddit.com/r/kidneydisease/comments/1h9z8r6/lmk_your_experience_wglomerulonephritis/,Lmk your experience w/glomerulonephritis,"I (21F) just went to see the urologist last week, and I just wanted to hear from people with glomerulonephritis. I’ve had digestive issues all my life and they’re mostly associated with anxiety or foods I have intolerances to. That being said, I started having intense nausea starting around my first year of college. I figured it was because I moved to a place with a warmer climate, but I couldn’t stop drinking water. If I did, I would feel even more nauseous than my base level nausea. This made it increasingly hard to attend class because I couldn’t get up quickly or take naps during the day. This nausea was especially bad if I ate anything with robust flavor, anything spicy, greasy, or red meats, so I stuck with chicken, rice, salads, pasta, and vegetables as my safe foods. I drank coffee maybe 2-3 times a week and alcohol once a month because both would increase my nausea, and I’m incredibly scared of throwing up. I started having more frequent “episodes” where I would eat something that my stomach wouldn’t agree with and it would set my body into a sweat and stomach cramps before having really bad runs. I would usually take nauzene during times like these, but I had been having “episodes” since around my 6th grade year. 

Well within the past year of my freshman and sophomore years in college, I also started getting strep(?) more frequently (or a throat infection at least). I got strep pretty much every year as a child, but the middle of March of this year is when I saw blood in my urine too. I had already gone to the doctor, and they gave me antibiotics, but I went back to get a urinalysis done. They failed to tell me the results couldn’t be read properly due to the antibiotics in my system already, but my urine went back to normal within a day regardless, so I didn’t worry much about it. I came down with strep(?) again around the end of September, and I saw blood in my urine before I went to the school clinic. They said the strep test was negative like the time before, so they diagnosed me with pharyngitis and a possible UTI and gave me antibiotics. The urinalysis they did came back with increased protein levels but regular white blood cell levels, so there wasn’t an infection. I got a throat infection in mid November after this, and I went back. Unfortunately, they asked if it was my period, diagnosed me with allergies, and sent me on my way (same doctor as last time). The results of the urinalysis showed no infection again and increased protein levels. I couldn’t sleep through the night for three nights straight because of the throat pain, and the blood lasted for around 4-5 days. Rusty colored to bright red to rusty again.

In addition, I’ve had pretty recent symptoms including frequent urination, a nonstop dribble when I need to stop urinating, and sensitivity to sweets (they make me feel nauseous too now).
I have taken a pregnancy test btw, and I know I don’t have any STDs

I got an appointment with a urologist at my parents’ request. I went and they said their best guess was glomerulonephritis based off the symptoms I gave, but they went ahead and did another urinalysis, an ultrasound, and a blood test in office. The urinalysis showed increased protein levels, but it also showed microscopic red blood cells despite my urine being a normal color that day. They said the normal amount of red blood cells was usually around 0-5, and I had around 43-60. The urologist also said that they saw a little swelling in my right kidney from the ultrasound. The blood tests aren’t back yet, but they referred me to a nephrologist in town and suggested a CT scan which will likely be after the holidays

I just wanted to hear from other people and get to know their experiences because I don’t know how many of my symptoms are related and how many I might need to get checked out with someone else. I’m fully aware I only have the iffy diagnosis from the urologist and it isn’t a full diagnosis, but I think it might give me a little peace of mind knowing other people have similar experiences. I’m in no way expecting anyone to fully diagnose me or cater to my feelings here. I know that I won’t have any true answers until I see a specialist. I just feel a little alone in my experience right now because I don’t know anyone else with these issues.",1,1733710558.0,kidneydisease,0,1.0,False
1h9z7ny,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h9z7ny,Advice needed for a kitchen facelift :-),"Hi! I’m looking to get some advice for our kitchen renovation. We’re not trying to gut the whole thing and start over- just some minor things to make it look better overall and more cohesive with the rest of the house. The old owners of the house re-did the kitchen before they sold it to us in a very cool-toned modern style, which doesn’t match the warm wood tones throughout the rest of the house. So, we want to try to cozy it up a bit.

We will keep all appliances and the cabinets for sure. We definitely want to add cabinet pulls in a brass tone, update sink faucet to match, update sink to a cream/white farmhouse apron sink, add backsplash (2nd to last pic is my main inspo and the dark backsplash i included is the same one she has; the white square one would be second choice), possibly add in cabinet inserts like the last pic to get the coffee machines off the valuable counter space, and install granite countertops. Also welcome advice for anything in the space between the barstools and that back wall/french door. It feels a bit awkward, but don’t want to block that walkway. Also note that we don’t expect to live here forever, so don’t want to sink too much money into it. I would love ideas to warm it up but still tie in to the rest of the house.

1h9z7fb,https://www.reddit.com/r/DatingApps/comments/1h9z7fb/korean_german/,Korean German,"I met you in April 2024 through Tinder. You super-liked me on March 18, and I was thrilled—you’re Korean, and I’ve always been fond of anything Korean. You messaged me shortly before I traveled to my hometown, asking where I usually play tennis. I didn’t respond right away because I was busy, and your question made me think you were only interested in tennis. I ignored it until March 24, when you sent another message. This time, I replied. You asked if I was up for a game, and we agreed to meet in mid-April when I returned to Manila. You mentioned you were a bad texter (so am I), so we didn’t keep in touch much before meeting.

Fast forward to April 16—we played tennis at VMMC. I picked you up at MRT Quezon Avenue station, and you were my first non-family passenger since I started driving in Manila. I was so nervous because you didn’t talk much, leaving me to carry most of the conversation. I also didn’t expect you to speak English so well—I thought communication might be a challenge. On the court, I played terribly because I hadn’t practiced in over a month and wasn’t used to hard courts. I was so embarrassed. Afterward, we went for lunch at a Mediterranean restaurant near your place, Feta. I liked how you took the lead in choosing the restaurant and ordering food—it was a relief since I’m bad at making food-related decisions.

During lunch, we talked about your nice condo, your ex-girlfriend who moved abroad, and your upcoming trip to Germany to celebrate your birthday with friends. I felt the date didn’t go well—the mismatch in tennis skills and the awkwardness during lunch left me intimidated. You paid for lunch, and I dropped you off at your condo. You gave me a side hug before leaving, which felt like a good sign. Still, I thought it was a one-time thing and that I wouldn’t hear from you again.

In June, I saw you at VMMC tennis courts, wearing the same purple shirt from our first meeting. I pretended not to recognize you. Then, on July 11, you messaged me, asking if I was playing in the weekend tournament. The conversation was brief but ended with you suggesting we play again sometime. On July 24, out of the blue, you messaged, “Hope you’re fine during this typhoon season. Depressing weather.” It was so random, but it made me happy. Still, I guarded my heart, not sure if you were really interested.

On August 5, you asked if I was playing in a tournament at CSA Bulacan on September 7. I initially said no—I was tired of doubles due to partner issues—but you encouraged me to try singles. I agreed, partly to spend the day with you. I figured you might need a ride since CSA is far, and we planned to go together.

September 7 marked our second meeting, five months after April. We ended up spending the entire day together because my games were in the morning and yours in the afternoon. I picked you up at 6 a.m., and we headed to the venue. Playing singles, a game I’m not confident in, was nerve-wracking because I wanted to impress you. Despite my poor performance, we grew closer that day, supporting each other throughout the tournament. You met some of my friends, which felt special. On the drive back, we talked a lot, thanks to the heavy traffic. We had dinner at Hyeongje Grill, a Korean BBQ place near your condo. For the first time, we sat next to each other—it felt like a boyfriend-girlfriend moment as we cut meat for each other. Before parting, you gave me another side hug. This time, it felt more meaningful because you returned to the car just to say goodbye. I knew there’d be a next time, but I didn’t want to rush it.

Our next meeting was at UP Diliman for tennis. You met some of my friends, though you were very introverted and not as social. Later, we had lunch at Din Tai Fung in Megamall, where you introduced me to my now-favorite dessert, Golden Lava Salted Egg Buns. We had coffee at Muji, where I learned your go-to order is iced Americano. At the elevator in Shangri-la Mall, you gave me your usual side hug before leaving.

When you injured your wrist, you weren’t sure if you could play tennis. I hesitated but asked if we could do lunch instead. You took a day to respond, which made me anxious, but eventually, we planned to meet on October 20. For the first time, we met without tennis involved. After meeting at Zara, we had lunch at Grifoni in Podium, followed by coffee at Elephant Grounds. I was still very conscious around you, but I enjoyed our time together. When I left, you said, “See you in December when I’m back from Thailand.” It was the first time you expressed wanting to see me again, and it meant a lot.

November was filled with thoughts of you. I couldn’t get you out of my head and counted the days until December. Then, as I prepared for a friend’s wedding, John Mayer’s XO played, and it made me think of you. Hours later, you messaged me. It wasn’t much, but knowing you reached out meant the world to me.

I don’t know what will happen next, but I want to keep seeing you and getting to know you. Writing this on my flight back to Manila from Iloilo, I just can’t get you out of my mind.",1,1733710434.0,DatingApps,0,1.0,False

He's a single dad, and I'm the eldest child and likely the only one getting him a gift, so I really want it to be something he enjoys. 

**About him:** He's 54, about to be 55. He's a real foodie, and a great cook, but has more kitchen utensils than I know exist. He's also a real intellectual, legitimately one of the smartest people I know. He loves to read, but he already has a large pile of books he's meaning to read. A dry, sarcastic sense of humor. He wears things out easily because he has a very physical job, but he replaces them so often it's possible he'd buy a new wallet or pair of shoes or whatever else before Christmas. He works a lot, and I also don't have a lot of free time between school, internships and work. He loves coffee, spices, not a big fan of lotions and body care sets, but if it is a very nice one he may enjoy it? He listens to music a lot.

I'm stumped. I usually don't struggle with gifts, but I really need some advice. As a teenage girl, I unfortunately have no idea what the average middle-aged man may like. 

Any advice appreciated, thanks in advance!

So we had to fly down to Florida for what might be my grandmother’s last birthday. All the shitty people were there. They chose a very expensive restaurant with a dress code so my husband had to borrow a nice coat even though they knew people were traveling from out of state. Whatever.

My grandmother wanted to talk with me specifically over drinks before the event even though she doesn’t drink. I told her I’m not drinking and brought us to a coffee shop instead and she just got a water. Not sure what that was about but I’m guessing she wanted to get me to drink to get more dirt in my mom and her boyfriend. But it went ok.

During the dinner my father tried several times to split me and my husband up in the seating arrangement to sit next to me, but my husband looked him in the eye and said, “I’d like to sit next to my wife.” And my dad backed off. I was blown away.

Throughout the dinner we were asked all sorts of questions which we answered vaguely. We gave these people nothing to work with. At one point my aunt’s boyfriend started yelling at her at the table for stepping out taking a work call, but that was short-lived and the only real drama of the evening.

On a side unrelated to the conflict: I did have a very important heart to heart with my grandmother about my TBI and why I can’t visit as often. She said she would visit me then, but we both knew realistically our health would keep us from seeing each other much for the remainder of her life. She was under the impression I was trying to avoid her, but she became a lot kinder when I disclosed the extent of the injury. Still not thrilled with her about how she behaved throughout this, but I realize she’s old and dependent on my dad and it’s not entirely her fault that she’s been shitty.

My dad will reach out to me, no doubt. He went above and beyond to talk to us the whole night and be “good.” I am going to speak with my therapist on Tuesday about setting very firm boundaries I can stick to so I can move on with my life. No contact is not an option as long as my grandmother is alive.

Thank you for all the kind words throughout this process. You guys are really freaking cool and I appreciate you. 

TLDR: I had what I hope was my final dinner with my dad’s side of the family that blew up my wedding. It went ok.",43,1733710221.0,weddingdrama,0,0.99,False

1h9z3sm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Weddingsunder10k/comments/1h9z3sm/central_texas_wedding_cost_breakdown_18000_for/,"Central Texas Wedding Cost Breakdown - $18,000 for 100 guests. This includes a beautiful venue, two wedding coordinators, all rentals, decor, florals, a violinist, DJ, full service buffet style catering, full service latte bar, photographer & videographer, and my wedding dress and his suit. ","Central Texas Wedding Budget Breakdown. We are estimating just under $18k for 100 guests. We will be married Spring of 2025. ❤️ 

This forum has been so helpful as we’ve planned our wedding and hopefully this helps someone else. Here is a breakdown of our costs and an explanation of each cost and any money saving tips that I used.

We are paying for everything ourselves and with the exception of me DIY’ing our centerpieces, we are using a professional for all other services. Though we had a goal of staying around $15k, we are very pleased with the deals we’ve gotten. The $18k includes everything except rings and the honeymoon. With the price of everything increasing in our current economy, I’m even more pleased with the cost of everything.

Venue: $5,500 for a 48 hour rental. We booked for a Wednesday & Thursday with the ceremony to be held Thursday night. Our guests live within a couple of hours for the most part, so a Thursday worked for us. The cost of a Friday & Saturday was $19,000!!! We had major savings by doing a weeknight. The venue includes all tables, chairs, cottages for the bride & groom for 48 hours (or two nights during the  event) and a day of event coordinator which is a game changer. All setup and cleanup is included in the package. 

Venue insurance & security: $600

Officiant: Free. Family friend.

Marriage license: $100.

Rehearsal dinner: $200. Chick-Fil-A!

Wedding day brunch for wedding party: Charcuterie boards, coffee, & fruit. $200 from H‑E‑B. 

DJ: $850. We found a great deal on a local DJ who gave us a discount for paying in full. 

Violinist: $775. She will play the ceremony and cocktail hour. This is a splurge for us. 

Linen rentals: $950. We went to the next town over (a smaller town than the one we are in) and saved HUNDREDS of dollars. The $950 includes satin tablecloths, flatware, chargers, glasses, and napkins. It also includes delivery and pickup. I really encourage getting multiple quotes. Our first quote from the rental place in town was nearly $1k and only included tablecloths and napkins. By going to a smaller town, the rate was so much better. We also got 10% off of this rate. I’m not sure how we got the discount, but it was a nice surprise!

Caterer: $3,200. This was a STEAL! Other quotes were double this. This rate includes non alcoholic drinks, passed appetizers, salads, rolls, entree with two sides, and a full dessert bar. We are using a caterer who does catering on the side instead of full time. The owner has her own venue in another city so she’s very familiar with the industry. Once again, we got a great deal for paying in full and she included free salad, rolls, and a dessert table. The dinner is buffet style and the price includes servers, acrylic plates and plastic ware, and table bussing. Our caterer is from a different part of the state and we saved a lot of money by looking outside of our region. 

Coffee bar: $600. Full service lattes for 100 guests with a customized menu and customized cups with our wedding logo included! Two baristas included for two hours of service. We are huge coffee lovers and this was a sweet idea for us. Again, by looking in a town about an hour away, I saved hundreds of dollars as some of the local for this were nearly $1,000 and didn’t include any extras.

Florals: $800. I am DIY’ing part of this. Kroger is doing my floral arrangements for the wedding party and I’ll be doing the centerpieces. Kroger is doing our arrangements and boutonnières for only $300! This includes my bouquet, three bridesmaids bouquets, and four boutonnières. The remaining $500 will be used table arrangements and baby’s breath to line the aisle.

Photograpy and Videography: $2,300. We got another great deal on this one. This includes our engagement session, 9 hours of photography on our wedding day, and 3 hours of videography for the ceremony and part of the reception. Our photographer threw in the videography for free for paying in full at the time of booking. 

Decor: $250 for signage, table numbers, etc.

Suit for him w/tailoring & dress shoes: $500 (got the suit on a Black Friday sale!)

My dress: The biggest splurge for me. $1,000. It retailed for $1,300 but I got it on sale for Black Friday. Tip: David’s Bridal has a 10% sale on all dresses more than $1,000 right now. You can layer an additional 15% off when you sign up for a free account and make your first purchase. It saved me $300 for my dream dress. I had no intention of spending more than $500 on my dress but fell in love with it!

Alterations: I’m budgeting $500 for this but haven’t had my first appointment yet.

That’s everything! I know it’s not under $10k but I’m very proud of how it’s all come together and the deals we’ve managed to find for such great prices. We have friends who’ve been married in the past year or so who’ve spent much more than this for the same size of event. Their weddings were GORGEOUS but there was no way we could shell out the $30k-$40k they spent. I’m so happy with how things are turning out with our wedding! 💕💕💕

TLDR; Managed to get all professional vendors with the exception of florals for our 100 guest wedding for less than $18k.",6,1733710102.0,Weddingsunder10k,1,0.75,False

I like iced pumpkin spice lattes (venti, only four pumps of pumpkin syrup please), hot caramel macchiatos, and raspberry dark chocolate mochas. I average 1-3 drinks a day.

My solitary practice grew quickly, so I used it to get me high paying jobs like seafood work in Alaska or political campaigns.

What's the better move at this early stage? Should I continue showing up to the run events and trying to let things slowly build between us (to even see if there's any potential mutual interest), or should I directly just ask for his number next time? I'm worried that if I tried to initiate a coffee or one-on-one hangout, he could possibly turn it down or not be mutual, but then it would make things awkward for future running events, so I'm not sure how to play it! At the same time, I'd wanna be intentional if it even seems like it could be worth exploring for both of us!

For years, I thought I was just shy—or maybe socially awkward. But in reality, I was living with social anxiety. The constant fear of being judged turned even the simplest tasks, like making a phone call or meeting someone new, into a source of panic and dread.

I want to share what helped me—both the lessons I’ve learned through therapy and some surprising tools that brought me relief. If you’re struggling with social anxiety, I hope this post reminds you that things *can* get better.

The real turning point for me was during therapy when I learned about **cognitive distortions**—those sneaky, distorted thought patterns that fuel anxiety. For example:

* **Mind Reading**: Assuming others are judging you (e.g., “They think I’m boring”).
* **Catastrophizing**: Believing one small misstep will lead to disaster (e.g., “If I stutter, they’ll never respect me”).

I was living in my head, running scripts that weren’t even real. My therapist taught me to notice these thoughts and gently challenge them. For example:

* Instead of “They think I’m weird,” I’d ask myself, “What’s the evidence for that? What’s the evidence against it?”
* Instead of “I have to be perfect,” I’d reframe it: “It’s okay to be human. People aren’t as focused on me as I think.”

It wasn’t a magic fix, but practicing this daily slowly rewired my mindset.

Here are a few actionable strategies that helped me take back control:

* **Exposure Therapy in Small Steps**Avoidance only makes anxiety worse. I started with manageable challenges—like saying “hi” to a cashier—and worked my way up to initiating conversations with strangers. Every success, no matter how small, built confidence.
* **Body Language Reset**I learned that your body influences your mind. Standing tall, keeping my hands visible, and making eye contact not only projected confidence but *helped me feel it too*.

Over time, I built a toolbox of resources that complement therapy and help me stay grounded:

Books

* **“The Confidence Gap” by Russ Harris**This book is a gem for understanding and managing anxiety through Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). It taught me that confidence doesn’t mean fearlessness—it means taking action even when afraid.
* **“Quiet” by Susan Cain**For introverts dealing with social anxiety, this book is a validating hug. It reframes quiet strengths and shows how to thrive without changing who you are.

Podcasts: **“The Social Anxiety Solutions” with Sebastiaan van der Schrier**Practical tips and strategies from someone who’s been through it. I especially appreciated his insights on reframing negative thoughts.

 Apps

1. **LePal**My friend, a former Google engineer, created this app after overcoming her own struggles with depression. What sets it apart is its *spirit pet*, which guides you through daily journaling and therapy-like activities in a fun, approachable way. I use it to reframe anxious thoughts and track progress. It feels like having a nonjudgmental therapist in my pocket, especially for those days when therapy feels out of reach.
2. **Insight Timer**Free meditations tailored to anxiety. I love using their live sessions for grounding when I feel overwhelmed.
3. **Shimmer**Tracks your moods and helps you identify patterns. Over time, I’ve learned what triggers my social anxiety and how to manage it better.

I’m not “cured” of social anxiety—it still pops up from time to time. But I’ve learned how to manage it, and it no longer controls my life. Therapy, practice, and these resources have all played a part.

What’s worked for you? I’d love to hear your tips, too. ❤️

1h9ysn3,https://www.reddit.com/r/zoloft/comments/1h9ysn3/how_to_handle_headaches_and_being_tired_all_the/,How to handle headaches and being tired all the time?,"Hello. First of all, this is my first time posting on Reddit and I’m on mobile, which I’ve read sorta screws over the formatting, so I’m sorry if this is all over the place for whatever reason.

I just started sertraline last week, 25mg for the first 8 days and after tomorrow I’m switching to 50mg. It's okay, I suppose; I’m pretty much unable to feel anything at all and am pretty static most of the time, which I know a lot of people hate but tbh since I started psychiatric treatment three years ago, all I wanted was to not feel, so I can't complain about that.

However, it does cause me really bad headaches, my head has been hurting all week (half of it made me feel like my cranium was about to split open), and also caused me to have some really weird dreams (which I am bringing up as I've read these past few days is a normal side effect of the meds). The headaches have started to get in the way of my job and honestly, I'm tired. I am also on methylphenidate (Ritalin/Concerta) for ADHD and clonazepam for anxiety, and I'm a little bit reluctant to add painkillers to the mix because it just seems like too much for me. Not only that, the weird dreams, in addition to the drowsiness already caused by the meds, makes me sleepy all day and no matter how much I sleep, I don't rest.

How do you guys manage headaches and tiredness from sertraline? Coffee is a no-go for me because it worsens the pain and tiredness, so I'm kind of lost on how to manage the physical side effects.

I know I should talk to my doctor but I'm kind of scared she'll tell me to hold on to the 25mg dose then, as I had a pretty bad depressive relapse and really want to try the full dosage of antidepressants.

I've been living in LA for the past 8 years, and let me tell you – this city's food scene is absolutely incredible. I've made it my personal mission to try every notable restaurant, from hole-in-the-wall gems to fancy dining spots. Today, I want to share my absolute favorite must-eat restaurants in Los Angeles.

Before I dive in, I actually discovered most of these places through a local food tour I booked on https://athometouch.com/losangeles. If you're visiting LA, I highly recommend checking them out for food tours and other cool activities.

First up is Grand Central Market downtown. This historic food hall has everything from tacos to coffee. Eggslut is a must-try – their egg sandwiches are legendary. The line might be long, but trust me, it's worth it.

Next, you can't miss Bestia in the Arts District. Their homemade pasta and charcuterie are mind-blowing. Pro tip: make reservations way in advance, this place books up fast.

For the best Korean BBQ, head to Park's BBQ in Koreatown. The quality of their meat is unmatched, and the banchan (side dishes) are amazing. If you're new to KBBQ, the staff is super helpful in guiding you through the experience.

n/naka is my go-to for special occasions. It's probably the best Japanese restaurant in LA, offering an incredible kaiseki experience. Yes, it's pricey, but the artistry and flavors are unforgettable.

For amazing Mexican food, head to Guelaguetza in Koreatown. Their mole is world-famous, and the tlayudas are incredible. The vibrant atmosphere makes you feel like you're in Oaxaca.

Don't forget about Langer's Deli – home to what many consider the best pastrami sandwich in America. Their #19 sandwich is iconic.

Another hidden gem I discovered through https://athometouch.com/losangeles was Republique. Their brunch is fantastic, and the building's architecture is stunning. The chocolate croissants are to die for.

Being a local foodie, I've found that the best way to discover these places is through local food tours. You get to try multiple spots in one day, learn about the history, and get insider tips from knowledgeable guides.

These are just a few of my favorites – LA's food scene is constantly evolving with new restaurants opening all the time. What are your favorite spots in LA? I'd love to hear your recommendations in the comments!

PS - If you're visiting LA and want to explore more food spots, definitely check out some food tours. It's a great way to discover places you might have missed otherwise!",1,1733709090.0,AskTheTraveler,0,1.0,False

We have been together 16 months. He is almost done renovating the house he's been working on for about 5 months. He has included me in most decisions he makes about the house as far as decor and the look, about 50% of the time. I have never doubted his love either. He asked me to move in 6 months in and continues to talk about it.

Today I was coming home from a party at my mother's for the holidays and offered to come help him at his house the next day. He agreed and asked me to do a few things. I went, even though I could have stayed at my mom's or just studied at my apartment (I'm a part time student). I like to help him because he has said he wants me to live with him multiple times.... I would have loved that, mostly because I liked him so much. I've never lived with a partner but I know it's difficult at times. I've lived with 3 different roommates and I know it's challenging at times but fun so it's worth it.

Long story short, I tipped a bag of grout over and he said, ""this is why I don't want to work with anyone!"" He shouted this. I did not spill anything, but started to cry involuntarily, I tried to stop the tears but they came. I went home and cried a lot he tried to call me but I didn't feel like I could talk with him yet. While texting he said ""I get frustrated when people insist on helping when I don't need it"" I explained, ""I wil not offer my help anymore"". He said ""Sounds good, thanks.""

This makes me think what would happen if I spill coffee or red wine, or juice even.... It makes me feel like I am wrong to help?

TL;DR: my boyfriend is almost done renovating his house. I feel like he is mad at me for helping(due to him saying that) even though he wants me to move in).

Hey everyone, M29 here. So I’ve recently met a woman (F19) at work. Normally, I don’t date younger women, especially those under 21, but she has completely surprised me with how mature and intelligent she is. We started talking as friends, exchanged numbers, and over the past couple of months, we've grown really close. We talk about everything, and we’ve both expressed that we’re attracted to each other and have talked about HOW MUCH we click. I’ve been upfront with her about my feelings, but last week, she told me she thinks we should just be friends because she’s focusing on her mental health and can’t handle a relationship at the moment, which I totally respect and understand.

Here’s where I’m torn, though: despite her saying we should just be friends, she does things that make me second-guess her intentions. For example, a customer was being flirty with me (which I wasn’t responding to at all), and I could clearly see it bothered her. She still texts me good morning and good night every day, and we chat constantly about our lives and what we want from life. She even bought me a small teddy bear for my car mirror, along with some gum and coffee, she sprayed it with a perfume she knows I like. I catch her staring at me all the time and when I look back, she quickly looks away and blushes. Shevcalls me cute pet names and is always flirting with me. If we're not together we're texting each other.

All of this has me thinking about her constantly and has me going insane. Honestly, I’ve never connected with anyone like this before. So, I’m stuck—should I push forward and try to pursue a relationship with her, or do I stick with the “just friends” approach and respect her boundaries?

.
.
.

      Waffle House, an icon of American midwestern and southern culture. Often, it’s yellow glow is a beacon of hope to those late night dwellers, whether they be members of the working class or alcohol favoring partiers. Druggos are also a staple clientele. Waffle House, for better or worse, opens its doors to everyone from every walk of life. 

I will set the scene: it’s a late Thursday night, or early Friday morning in technicality, and I was heading home from a late night bender where I had the important but ultimately boring job of designated driver. All I wanted to do was go home and crack open a cold one for myself to kick off my weekend. Nature had other plans, however. The weather in the midsouth turned on a dime, and tonight was no exception. A downpour diminished any visibility on the road, and I knew I couldn’t confidently drive through this. The familiar yellow glow shone through the onslaught of rain and hail, however, and given that Waffle House will probably remain open under threat of nuclear war, I knew I could seek refuge there. 

The jingling bells welcomed me more than any employee did, but I could not blame them. The restaurant was a mess, probably from a busy evening earlier. The rodeo was this weekend, after all, and those rodeo boys sure loved their Waffle House. Shit, we all did. It was a Waffle Home in this part of town-- it was all we had after the rest of the town went to bed at sundown. 

A waitress sighs and tells me to sit wherever I’d like and she’d get to me when she could. She looked so tired. I picked the one somewhat clean table in the place, and watched the storm rage on outside. My phone confirmed that I would be here for awhile, and all I could do at this point was hope it didn’t evolve into a tornado. Waffle House would probably remain open even if it did. 

Even this late into the night, Waffle House had a buzz of conversation and kitchen noises. I saw a full staff and other customers, and yet, the only sound in the place was the hail beating on the roof and windows. The usual late night sound of laughter or arguments (usually the latter) was replaced by this frighteningly eerie silence. 

Seeing my phone was nearing the end of its battery life, I glanced around for an outlet when my eyes met those of the man in the booth across me. His hunched shoulders were cloaked in a dirty plaid shirt, and I assumed he might have been one of the rodeo boys. He wasn’t terribly old, maybe in his fifties at most, but the weariness of his features aged him. He stared at me momentarily, a slight crustiness to his gaze, before he returned to his plate of syrup soaked waffles. 

I slid down a little in my booth, knowing I’d soon be phoneless. Well, not the end of the world, I figured. People operated just fine without phones for years. I set it aside and waited for my waitress to remember I was here. 

The lights above flickered, and yet were silent-- none of that fluorescent hum. Or maybe there was, and I just couldn’t hear it among the thunder and hail. It still struck me as unsettling, but my thoughts were interrupted by the work worn face of Marilyn. 

“What can I get you?,” she asked in a monotone voice that added to my increasing unease. She didn’t sound tired, or annoyed, she sounded utterly blank. Almost robotic, but with an inflection of human that made it uncanny.

“Could I get a coffee, and the two egg breakfast with--”  I didn’t get to specify anything about my plate before she was walking away. Must have been a hell of a shift, I thought to myself. Whatever, food was food, I would be fine with whatever I got at this point, as long as it passed the time faster. I just wanted to go home. 

Her shoes echoed as she shuffled off, and she didn’t speak with the cook, she just handed him a plate with random crap on it. Figuring my staring would be rude, I turned back to the window. Luckily, the hail stopped, but the rain was still coming down in buckets. No tornado watch yet. The atmosphere felt oppressively thick, and I almost felt like I was choking on the smells of burnt coffee, bacon, and stale cigarettes. There was an undertone to it though, something I couldn’t place right away. It was oddly….metallic. 

I pressed the heels of my hand to my eyes and took a deep breath. I had to relax. It was just a fucking Waffle House. It was always weird-- that was part of the charm. My growing anxiety was just the storms, right? 

“Good time for a late night meal, huh?” The voice made me jump from my seat. It was the rodeo guy, staring right at me. His voice was low and gravelly and much more human than the waitress’s, yet it gave me even more anxiety. Despite how I’d seen him actively eating, his plate had the same amount of food on it that I’d seen earlier. He had a little smirk on his face, and glanced at the window, as if suggesting I do the same. 

I smiled nervously, wondering why the fuck some random man was talking to me. I was a newer face around this part of the country, and what they called Southern Hospitality still creeped me the fuck out. As if noticing this, he let out a frightening little chuckle before returning to his plate of waffles, his weirdly hypnotic gaze now breaking. 

I looked back out the window, weirdly compelled to, and the rain had downgraded to less apocalyptic now. I could see my car, and a few bodies in the parking lot smoking. I had a bad habit of not locking my doors, so I locked them from my remote to deter any smokers out there who might be interested in my stunning little Nissan Altima that smoked if you drove it longer than twenty minutes. Lightning flashed, momentarily illuminating the parking lot. That’s when I noticed the shadows. They moved unnaturally, and danced only at the very edges of the parking lot.

My heart began to race, but like before, the waitress interrupted my growing unease. A cup of coffee was placed in front of me, its smell warm and familiar. And yet, it brought me no comfort. I tried to ask for sugar and cream, but again, the waitress walked away before I could. Black coffee was better than no coffee, I figured. Taking a sip eased my nerves a bit, and I told myself I was just letting my anxiety get out of hand. I was finding fright in things that were perfectly normal-- for a Waffle House. 

Aside myself and the rodeo boy, there was one other table here. Five people in total, who were silent the whole time. I only knew this because they stared at me as they walked by to leave. No words, no smiles, just vacant staring. I knew I stood out, but it made me feel uncomfortable regardless. 

Rodeo boy laughs once more. “Saw yer plates,” he said, motioning to the window. “Out of state. You’re new here, aren’t ya?”

“Been about six months,” I replied. Did that count as new? Ever since I moved here, people seemed obsessed with the idea of me being from out of town. It felt so unnecessary.

“That’s just a drop of piss in the bucket, son. I’m here every night, and I ain’t ever seen you.” He was right. I’d never been to this Waffle House before. I much more preferred the one on the highway, surrounded by other businesses. This one was more remote, which added to it’s uncomfortable atmosphere. “They’re gonna stare, son. You’re out here dressed as Count Dracula, chokin’ back black coffee. We don’t do cream ‘n sugar, you’ll just have to mature a bit.”

He laughed once more, but I decided not to reply. Why should I? He was a creepy, hulking man who was getting a kick out of scaring and insulting me. It felt safest to pretend he wasn’t there. 

My eyes go back to the window, and in another flash of lightning, I see them again. The shadows. It was as if fingers of darkness were clawing at the edges of the parking lot. I inched closer to the glass to get a better look, when the sound of a plate slamming once again pulls my attention away. My waitress. 

“Syrup?,” she asked. 

It confused me, until I looked down and saw waffles. I hadn’t ordered that. “Oh, this is--”

“All we got,” she snapped. “Syrup or not?”

I nervously shook my head and slumped in my seat some as she walked away. I wasn’t the biggest fan of waffles-- even Waffle House’s-- but hey, food was food. I took a bite, and again looked out the window. The sight made me nearly choke on my food. 

The man was laughing wholeheartedly now, as if my horror was the funniest thing he’d ever seen. The entire lot now was engulfed in the strange tendrils of shadow, and it was pulling at the hedges that perimetered the building. I got up quickly, getting as far from the window as I could in a short amount of time. 

My eyes looked to rodeo boy. “Shut the fuck up dude-- don’t you see that!?”

“See what?,” he mocked. “Oh, hush boy.” His laughing ceased and he pointed at the seat across his. “Your mind’s playing with ya, making ya see shit. Why don’t ya sit awhile and relax some?”

I shook my head and turned to the counter, trying to pay. But it was like the staff was ignoring me. 

“Ah, come on!,” the man teased. “You look like you’d be a big fan of the creepy crawlies that hang out ‘round here! C’mon, sit with me, I can tell ya all about it.”

I still didn’t want to, and every instinct said not to, and yet, it was like he was forcing me to. I was stiff as a corpse as I sat down, and my eyes refused to meet his. They were quite suddenly full of life, like a proud predator who had just caught his prey. 

“They say these woods are haunted,” he said.

“That’s cool…” I murmured, looking for any out to leave.

“The shadows yer seeing, they ain’t real. The trees pull weird tricks out here. No, no, see the real worries in this neck of the woods ain’t no ghosties. There’s weird people.”

No shit. I’m sitting with one.

He then says something that injected ice into my veins. “Yanno, you’d make a fine lookin’ corpse, Hollywood.”

There was an instinct to correct him, wanting to say that just because I was from California didn’t mean I was from Hollywood. I’d never even been to fucking Hollywood. But fear took over, and I tried to inch out of my seat.

“Not a lot of meat on ya, though. But I bet you’re one of them clean eaters, all that plant based shit. I bet that’s like a good, grass fed beef. Ya dig?”

I dug, alright. I once again tried to leave, but now, his hand had a frighteningly strong grip on my own. “I wouldn’t go out there right now if I was you. Like I said, they say these woods are haunted. They say they make people do crazy things. There’s a few families in them there woods, families I won’t ever speak to. They like to wait for the dark--” His voice immediately stopped with the tingling of bells. A new face had just walked in.

He was a tall, thin, utterly filthy man. I would guess that he was a farmer based on his clothing, but it was almost as if he was dressed in a costume to trick people like me who weren’t raised around here.

Rodeo boy in front of me now leaned in close. “That there’s one of em,” he whispered. “You sit tight, pretty boy.”

I had a chance to escape then, as he’d gotten up to greet this freak. But that meant walking right by them, which I didn’t want to chance. This new comer had dead eyes, the kind with no soul in them. I turned away, quietly listening to rodeo boy talk him up. 

“Well, shoot, Todd I ain’t seen ya in, shit, how long’s it been now?” Rodeo boy sounded genuinely friendly now. 

“Not since our Brodie went missin’,” Todd replied. His voice was oddly deep for someone as scrawny as he was. “It’s been ‘bout six months.”

Todd glances my way, and I again feel ice in my blood. “You looks a lot like my Brodie,” he said. “You wanna be Brodie?”

Rodeo boy, takes him by the shoulder and leads him to a table. “Now, Todd, that twig looks nothing like Brodie. You don’t want him.”

Want me? I got up now, knowing this may not end well. I tried to be inconspicuous as I went for the door, but Todd’s voice warned me not to. “You don’t wanna go out there right now. Mama’s out, ‘n she’s in one of her moods. She’s been real hungry, Mason. I dunno what to with her.”

Rodeo boy, aka Mason, told me to sit back down before turning back to Todd. “You gotta ride it out. Yer family can’t keep doin’ this.” His voice dropped to a hush. “One of these days, someone’s gonna catch on. Get her a deer or somethin’, all these missin’ boys is eventually gonna turn back to you.”

It was all clicking. Was this Mama some crazed murder? Was she blood thirsty? Or was it a more literal hunger? 

I didn’t want to stick around to find out. My car was less than twenty feet away. If I ran, I could get in it fast enough to beat it out of here. 

“I wouldn’t try it!,” Mason called after me. But it was too late. I was dining and dashing sure, but I had to get the fuck out of here. Through the rain, I sprinted to my car, and practically dove inside. I prayed for it to start on the first try, for once in my life, and thank god it did. I ensured all my doors were locked before turning on the headlights. 

The sight before me made me scream. An older, larger woman was in front of my car. In my panic, I was struggling to shift into reverse, giving her a chance to hobble to my door. Through the glass, I could hear her wailing, “You gotta light!? You gotta light for my cigarette!?” She was pounding on the window, begging for a light. 

I did not care. I threw the car into reverse and whipped the fuck out of there. I was going about ninety on the highway, wanting to put as much space between me and this Waffle House as possible. It was all a bad dream, I told myself, a manifestation of my anxiety. Seeing my apartment complex in my headlights felt like salvation, and I knew this was all behind me. Now, more than ever, I craved a Modelo. I took a moment in my car to just breathe. Everything was going to be alright, I assured myself. It was all fine. Mason was just scaring me for fun, Todd was obviously mentally ill, that woman was probably on drugs. It was just a weird night. I was letting my fear of storms make everything into a horror movie. 

Once I’d stopped shaking, I started for my apartment. Typically, I never paid attention to anything in the lobby, least of all the mess of papers that littered the billboard. There was usually all the same shit: local ads, lost pets, and missing people. The same things you’d see at a Walmart or a post office, or anywhere else. I’d seen it all so much that it melted into the background in my day to day life. 

But tonight, it caught my eye. A missing person’s flyer with a photo of a guy looking vaguely like myself. Brodie Wells, it read. Brodie. My heart sunk as I ripped it off and inspected it closer. Behind Brodie’s flyer was another, very similarly formatted. Another young guy, looking like an outsider. And another. And another. There were over twenty of them-- all within ten years of age from each other, all not dressing like the townsfolk I'd seen here, and all missing in this area. All last seen around that Waffle House by those woods. They were also all tourists, visitors-- just like myself. I brought all the flyers to my unit with me, laying them all over my floor to get a better look. This kidnapper definitely had a type. Or was it a kidnapper? 

I pulled open my laptop and started researching each name, and everything came back the same. No trace of any of them, and this had been going on for years. Two of them had an ounce more of information on them, as their names were better known. They had public profiles, so there was much more on their case. They were also tourists, but they looked different from the kidnappers' victim type. They were in town for some YouTube video project, and apparently, one recommended they film out the woods in the area after a dinner at Waffle House. For years, nothing ever came up about them, until a hiker’s dog came running out of the woods with a human bone. One that was so smooth, it was as if all flesh had been cooked away. Those were the article's exact words. Soon, another bone was found, and both were DNA matched to a pair of missing YouTubers named Hunter and Isaiah. But that was years ago, and they were never explicitly tied to other missing persons cases. Despite the differences, I found connections. Were these the first victims? Did they put up too much of a fight, perhaps? The one did look a little intimidating, like he didn't trust strangers. Maybe he'd fought back? My heart was pounding and my mind went back to Waffle House. 

Mama’s in one of her moods. What was the mood? Homicidal? Damn it, Mason, that’s not something to ride out! I decided to try and call the police, but my phone was dead at this point. Surely, there was a public phone in the lobby. I raced downstairs for it, but to my dismay, the line was dead. Had the storm taken it out? It had picked back up again, the thunder rattling the whole building as it sounded. The lights flickered before also going out, and now, it was pitch black. The only light came from the occasional flashes of lightning. 

That’s how I saw her, standing in that glass doorway. As shadows unnaturally danced about in the same way they did in that parking lot, I saw her silhouette and a glimpse of her face, but there was no mistaking it. It was the same woman, and my only saving grace was the door being locked from the inside. She was pounding on the glass once more, begging to be let in. 

“Come on, now, boy, you can spare a light!,” she begged, somehow yelling loud enough that I could hear her clearly through the glass. Her fist was pounding on it in a jarring display of strength, sending echoing booms through the quiet lobby. I couldn't see a thing in the dark to find where I was going, and I stood frozen in fear. I was hoping the lock would hold and that the rain soaking her would make her give up. 

A million things ran through my mind. Mason really was a freak, but he was trying to be nice, wasn't he? Was he trying to save me? He seemed to know, and yet, he seemed to have a soft spot for Todd. Was Todd an unwilling accomplice? Were Mason's comments nothing more than to get me to either leave sooner, or pay attention to him? It seemed Marilyn, my waitress, was trying to keep me distracted too. Did they not want me to look out the window? Was that how this Mama spotted me? I lived my life in near constant fear of everyone around me that I missed those who maybe had good intentions at heart. How I regretted that now. 

All at once her pounding stopped, and I thought for sure she was done. But she suddenly pressed her face to the glass, and a long flash of lightning illuminated her unholy grin. She's not human, I thought to myself. She couldn't be. 

“You'd make a lovely corpse!,” she yelled, and it sent chills through me. 

It wasn't just because of those harrowing words. It was because I could hear her much clearer now. The door was open, the glass shattered around her frail, twitching frame. Her skin hung on her like kudzu hangs on an abandoned home, and her teeth were unnaturally large and white as she grinned maniacally. I was frozen before the sound of shuffling glass against the bottom of her slippers pushed me into action. Her eyes shone like a predator’s, and I had to act to live. 

All I could do now was run.

1h9yjg3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SonicTheMovie/comments/1h9yjg3/who_freed_shadow_who_freed_gerald_and_who_and/,Who freed Shadow? Who freed Gerald? And who (and when) is launching missiles into the Chao Garden?,"So there's been a question floating around since the very first trailer of the movie: Who helped free Shadow at Prison Island?

Because it's not Eggman. Eggman is only approached by Team Sonic, and then subsequently approached by Gerald AFTER Shadow has already been released. I don't know if it would be Shadow himself who breaks out, since at this point in time he's in stasis, and it would assumed that there needs to be some sort of outside intervention that would cause him to wake up. We also hear a line from Walters that ""There's been a high level security breach,"" which could refer to someone breaking into the prison in order to free Shadow.

The most obvious candidate, and tbh, the only one who really made sense to me, is Gerald. He's smart enough to break into prison, awaken his own creation, and it's very easy to see him approaching Shadow right afterwards and talking to him about starting their plan. (We even hear Gerald say ""It's time, Shadow..."" in the second trailer)

... But then we see this in the second trailer as well:

[Not the prison jumpsuit-looking outfit](https://preview.redd.it/961o0e20bp5e1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=0204bf046aebd5c6905ef1137b64f2e316020d4e)

Which implies that Gerald has been locked up at some point - perhaps even being locked up for the ENTIRE fifty years between the end of Project Shadow and the present day.

If we assume that this is indeed the case, then does that mean Gerald managed to escape through some kind of means, and then went to release Shadow right afterwards? Or could it not have been him? Was it the other way around, with Shadow freeing Gerald after getting out from Prison Island? Could it have been Agent Stone who freed Shadow at first, which then led to Shadow freeing Gerald?

And that's only the first half of my questions. The other half is this: When does the Chao Garden scene happen? And WHO, for goodness' sake, is launching those missiles at it?

[Based on the interior of the glass, I'm 99&#37; sure they are aimed at the Chao Garden](https://preview.redd.it/yu09aw23bp5e1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=49179cf9b49a1712bd8dafa3a18724ed162b2028)

The second trailer confirms that at the very least, Badniks are being used to open fire at the cafe with a bunch of children inside of it (whoever's doing this has got some major ""fuck them kids"" energy)

While the Badniks themselves don't automatically confirm who it is that's launching them,  it does highlight a couple of suspects based on whoever's got access to being able to operate them.

There was a really compelling theory of the culprit being Director Rockwell as a sort of covert assassination attempt on Walters or even Team Sonic, and based on some movie footage that was recently released, >!it does appear that she's got a pretty low opinion on GUN working alongside the alien furries.!< However, unless she's got some kind of access to Badniks, it looks like the chances of it being her has decreased.

So it seems to come down to two suspects: Robotnik, since he's the one who made the Badniks, but there's also my pre-second-trailer guess, Gerald.

So my original assumption was this: After getting their asses beat by Shadow, Team Sonic meets up with Walters and they talk about stuff; then Gerald, having hacked some Badniks that were stored SOMEWHERE, (iirc, when we see the scene at the abandoned lab, where Gerald and Ivo meet for the first time, there was what looked like a deactivated Badnik there) uses those to blow up the Chao Garden in the hopes of taking out the Commander of GUN.

[Granted, the Badnik here could have been brought by Ivo, but I think there's a chance it could have been used by Gerald](https://preview.redd.it/nfafqpklbp5e1.png?width=2002&format=png&auto=webp&s=7be93a66f5ffc9becc1b1471396d7c64bd6b4bc9)

But since we have confirmation that Ivo will join up with his grandfather for a decent portion of the movie, and after seeing a few more scenes in Tokyo, it's brought up questions about how exactly the timeline is going to work.

There was an idea previously posited by u/Lost_Page_2030 about there actually be TWO fights against Shadow in Tokyo, with the Chao Garden scene happening in-between them.  I bring this up because I've been thinking about this, and I think maybe it could actually happen?

There is a TV spot out there where Sonic passes out after getting his ass handed to him by Shadow, as a minor [reference](https://www.reddit.com/r/SonicTheMovie/comments/1gz0vnw/new_tv_spot_references_the_shadow_the_hedgehog/) to Shadow 05's animated intro cutscene. And there's been people who [pointed out](https://www.reddit.com/r/SonicTheMovie/comments/1f4ufkq/so_i_watched_it_very_closely_and_heres_a_partial/) that the backgrounds of Team Sonic facing off against Shadow in Tokyo seem to vary greatly in-between shots.

Also worth pointing out that the new trailer includes this scene:

[Presumably this takes place before the \\""giant fireball\\"" that catches Team Sonic's attention?](https://preview.redd.it/tyndrv03sp5e1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc32a2120e8c4e40f0bd5519748a532f1c494b5a)

And also this scene of Team Sonic I'm fairly confident does NOT take place inside the Chao Garden before the missiles hit them like the trailer implies:

[\\""Konichiwhaaaaaat?\\""](https://preview.redd.it/tuupcu47sp5e1.png?width=1996&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bf84780f3499236f638e9c1b48f836391860342)

So, taking into account the ""two fights in Tokyo"" interpretation, here's what might happen.

Team Sonic jumps of the plane after seeing the giant fireball caused by Shadow. They face him there, but then get bodied and knocked out. By the time they come to, they either 1) meet Walters at ~~Olive~~ Chao Garden or 2) Decide to recruit Eggman. 

Option 1, they go there, and then the Badniks blow up the place. At this point, it would presumably have to be either Gerald or maaaaaybe Agent Stone who was using those Badniks.

Option 2, they get Eggman, then they go exploring what is presumably the lab Shadow was created in, Eggman meets Gerald and betrays Team Sonic, Team Sonic travels back to the Wachowskis and recruits them, then they visit the Chao Garden. When it's blown up in this scenario, it can be more easily believed that it would Robotnik who launched the missiles at them in order to try and kill them/GUN's Commander.

But post-Chao Garden explosion, is when Team Sonic re-encounter Shadow, and this is probably where we get the motorcycle fight scenes. The fight ends with Shadow and Sonic clashing in the sky, and knocking out the power in Tokyo.

.... Now here's how I think it would have to work if we only have ONE fight in Tokyo.

Shadow is surrounded by GUN soldiers, and proceeds to take care of them, causing a fiery explosion that alerts Team Sonic to his whereabouts. Team Sonic jumps off the plane and encounters him, but Shadow casually sweeps the floor with them and then we get the Shadow 05 cutscene reference. But Team Sonic doesn't stay down for long, and Knuckles attempts to ambush Shadow by jumping at him, only to get his hand twisted. THEN Shadow gets the motorcycle and the gun, and the fight ends with Sonic and Shadow hitting each other in the sky and knocking out all the power.

Team Sonic then reconvene with Walters at Chao Garden, and then are proceeded to be interrupted by the missiles. At this point, since Robotnik isn't active, presumably it shouldn't be him behind the missiles. So again, I point to Gerald being the one behind him, or maybe Agent Stone.

Also, since Team Sonic only has seconds to turn around and actually see the missiles before reacting, there's a chance they don't realize it's Badniks that were the ones to fire at them, so they may or may not think it's Eggman who fired it at them. Anyways, post-explosion, they decide to seek out Eggman.

This was supposed to be a quick analysis of whatever sequence of events is supposed to be taking place at Tokyo, as well as when exactly Gerald and/or Shadow would have been freed. But instead it took me the whole day so.... Feel free to tell me your thoughts and if I missed anything. I genuinely feel so confused trying to sort through this specific section of the movie....",4,1733708323.0,SonicTheMovie,7,1.0,False

I have 2 beautiful cats that I dont want to leave behind with my abusive family, so I will either take them or give them to a friend.

Here's my budget (based on Moneysmart's budget planner):

Income:

* Weekly pay: $500 (assuming \~20 hours of work per week, fitting into a VERY busy uni schedule)
* Fortnightly Centrelink Youth Allowance: $500

Rent/Utilities:

* Weekly rent (flatshare) \~$250
* Monthly mobile $25
* (I'm not sure of things like electricity and water are usually counted in rent, as well as wifi)

Insurance:

* Monthly car insurance $110 (Green P plater)
* Annual contents insurance \~$300
* Monthly pet insurance \~$180 (2 cats)

Groceries/Personal

* Weekly supermarket \~$100, (I try to eat healthy whole foods which I think hikes this price up)
* Weekly pet food \~$20
* Monthly toiletries \~$20-30
* Monthly pharmacy $20
* Annual dental \~$200 (very rough number, I haven't been to the dentist in over a year, not sure how much it costs)
* Quarterly doctor \~$200 (same to dental, I know Medicare covers most accidents but I'm not certain on the number so rather safe than sorry)
* Quarterly pet care \~$1000 (Not sure on this either, the cats are young and yet to have any serious medical problems)
* Monthly hobbies \~$100 (Architecture school supplies are very expensive)
* Quarterly clothing \~$200 (In case stuff breaks)
* Weekly gym \~$40 (planning on normal gym + social sport)

Entertainment/Take Aways:

* Weekly coffee \~$25
* Weekly take aways \~$45
* Quarterly books \~$30

Transport:

* Weekly Public transport \~$50
* Fortnightly petrol $100 (hate my 2007 Camry it gets maybe 400km per tank)
* Annual Rego \~$800-1000 (again Green Ps)
* Annual repairs \~$500 (rough balling, the Camry really sucks)

This makes for a total of \~$39k, against \~$43k in expenses. How do I lower my expenses? I am seriously considering selling my car, but I would need to find a good place to live first with accessible PT. I am very desperate to keep my costs down. Is there anything major you see that could be whittled down?

And I don’t need to go downtown for work nearly as much since 2019. 

In general, I’ve enjoyed the west suburbs more than the north, although I do miss the easier access to the North Side that north burbs offer. We’re thinking maybe Elmhurst, Wheaton, or Glen Ellyn, or Lombard. We don’t want a big yard or an HOA subdivision.

Pros and cons we should consider? Any other areas we should add to the consideration mix?

Berwyn has had its advantages, but we haven’t loved it. Part Berwyn itself, part the limitations of a bungalow. Would be great to live in a burb with a downtown that’s fun to hang out in (coffee shops, ethnic restaurants, etc). Plus if I could ride my bike to nearby trails. And we don’t want to be so close to O’Hare that noise is an issue.

Pour Over vs Drip vs Espresso,"I just got my KF7 in the mail and it’s an amazing machine. Does everything that it says, build quality is great, etc etc - I think the KitchenAid line will be one of the top machines in this sub! I am regretting the purchase though and may send it back. 

My problem is I don’t know that I correctly read the right machine for our family. My wife is used to me making her a drip coffee every morning with some Starbucks store bought creamer and then I froth some foam on top. She loves it, but she also loves a good coffee shop drink. Usually an americano with a pump of syrup and some almond milk. 

She just hasn’t found what she likes with the KF7. We both also like 10-12 oz cups. I feel like I’m having to make double of everything. I’m wondering if I would be better off going with a Automatic Pour Over like a Fellow Aiden or like a a DeLonghi Drip 

Here is what I’m looking for:
1. 10-16 oz cups of GOOD (not the normal motor oil Mr Coffee drip) coffee or americano (but now I’m wondering if I should just stick to coffee to make this  - maybe I didn’t need espresso )

2. Option for frothy foam - should I just buy the Nespresso countertop frother?

3. Carafe would be a nice feature - I even considered the Eletta Explore just to have a carafe. Our current plan is to just keep a second drip coffee maker around when we have a lot of guests. 

Do I keep the KF7, look at another super automatic like a TK-02 that does good dip, or switch gears and do a Fellow Aiden or a TrueBrew? I’m not in such a rush that I can’t spend 5 mins grinding beans… plus I can just pour my wife’s creamer and use a frother to make a great cup of coffee with some creamer in.

Imagine this: it’s the summer of 2054. We’re on the porch of a cozy house—one of those timeless places where the steps creak like old memories and the swing hums softly in the evening breeze. The sky is a canvas of gold and fire, and we’re there, painting it with laughter and shared stories. The kind of tales that weave themselves into your soul: travels that shaped us, mishaps that made us laugh, and quiet moments where no words were needed—just the warmth of each other’s company.

It’s not about grand adventures every day, but about finding magic in the ordinary—the way the sunset turns the edges of the world golden or how a shared silence can feel louder than words. Now, I’m here searching for the co-author of this future. Could it be you?

A Little About Me
I’m a contradiction wrapped in curiosity. A writer of thoughts, a collector of sunsets, and a seeker of those fleeting moments that remind us how beautiful the world can be. Quiet at first, but if you’re patient, you’ll find someone who speaks in passions and listens like it’s the most important thing they could ever do.

Right now, I’m looking for a friendship that feels like the first chapter of a well-worn book—something natural, unforced, where we build a connection page by page. I believe the best stories begin with a spark of understanding, and maybe, just maybe, they grow into something more.

Here’s what makes my story unique:
🎵 Music as a Muse: A future vinyl collector searching for a space, a lover of playlists that take you on a journey, and songs that feel like a warm hug. Music has a unique way of connecting moments, and I love finding the perfect soundtrack for every memory. Got a favorite song? Share it—I’m always ready to discover melodies that move you.
🌍 Adventure in My Veins: Whether it’s chasing the perfect golden-hour light, wandering through unfamiliar streets, or hiking trails that lead to breathtaking views, I’m all about exploring the world—both near and far. Life’s too short not to follow the whispers of adventure.
📚 Wordsmith at Heart: Writing is my way of capturing the fleeting and the unforgettable. I love playing with words until they reflect the emotions I can’t quite say aloud. And recently, I’ve been dabbling in photography—turning moments into memories through a lens.
🕹️ Low-Key Gamer: When the world feels too loud, there’s something comforting about a quiet night in with a good game or a classic movie marathon.

What I’m Looking For
I’m searching for someone who’s as curious about the world as I am—a woman who is kind at heart, sharp of mind, and carries a quiet strength that makes you want to know every story behind her smile. Someone who’s not just eager to explore the world around us but also willing to dive into the uncharted territory of creating a world together.

A partner in curiosity, someone who loves sharing dreams and building them into something real. Whether it’s small projects, grand adventures, or simply learning to navigate life’s challenges side by side, I want to create something unique with you—a shared journey filled with meaning, discovery, and connection.

What Sets Me Apart
I see life as a tapestry of little details: the way sunlight dances on leaves, the rhythm of rain on a quiet afternoon, or the poetry of a shared moment that feels too good to end. I’ll notice the way your eyes light up when you talk about something you love, and I’ll make a mental note of your favorite coffee order—not because I have to, but because I want to.

Loyalty is my cornerstone. I’ll show up, not just in the big moments, but in the small ones too—the random text when I know you’re having a rough day, the laughter when you need a distraction, or simply being there when you feel like the world isn’t. The best stories aren’t about grand gestures; they’re about the quiet consistency of someone who’s truly there for you.

I’m also a romantic—not in the cliché way, but in the way that makes you feel seen. Sweet gestures, thoughtful words, and a knack for making everyday moments feel special. I’m the kind of person who’ll leave you a note in your favorite book, point out constellations during a midnight drive, or turn a casual Sunday into something unforgettable.

And when it comes to connection, I value honesty above all. If something’s on your mind, I’ll always want to hear it. Because real stories—the ones worth telling—are built on truth, not games.

What About You?
Are you the kind of person who finds beauty in the cracks of everyday life? Who laughs easily, dreams deeply, and values honesty like a rare gem? Maybe you’re someone who savors both the quiet moments and the spontaneous ones—a cozy evening in or a bold adventure out.

Let’s start as friends, as kindred spirits who share an appreciation for the world’s quirks and wonders. Maybe we’ll swap stories, exchange playlists, or even embark on an adventure or two. And if the story decides to write itself into something more, we’ll let it—after all, the best tales often begin with an unexpected chapter.

If this resonates, let’s start the first line of what could be an unforgettable story. One filled with porch swings, golden sunsets, and the kind of connection that makes you believe in the magic of “what if.” Let’s see where the words take us.",2,1733707745.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

I was only on the med for about three weeks at the 35.7mg dose, and I'd chalk my experience up to placebo, given that venlafaxine isn't supposed to have immediate effects (but rather build up like SSRIs do), except the shift's been too wild to personally discredit. 

I've got primarily inattentive-type ADHD, and this shit hit like an amphetamine. noticed within an hour of taking a pill that it had ""kicked in"" (which is, again, not how an SNRI is supposed to work), and from that point on I was The Most Functional ADHD Man; worked nearly as well as when I had been taking vyvanse for executive function / energy / motivation. Bear in mind I'd been taking the lowest possible dose of vyvanse too (10mg) so I may just be a really reactive-to-meds kinda person? or, again, placebo

Was taking it for anxiety primarily, but the anxiety had turned into awful, spiralling depression, so was kinda trying to target both. Historically had taken three different kinds of SSRIs and two different benzos with no real usefulness. Venlafaxine mostly just blunted the shit outta my emotions until I didn't have the oomph to be Scared Of Everything; this has actually continued since dropping the meds. I've got my emotional range back, but what was rampant Anxiety TM about everything has simmered down to more of an Apprehension, even a solid month after stopping the dosage I was on, and even after many mugs of coffee. I'm overall more emotionally stable; haven't figured out if this is a permanent blunting of my emotions or what, but I think my adrenals are relieved about it lol  
  
Just generally I feel more like a functional actual person now after doing the meds? hard to describe, but I think that short term of venlafaxine is the closest I've ever come to fulfilling the ""if only I could just take a pill to make my brain normal forever"" wish so many ND people have. I wouldn't *recommend* it per se, given its intense side effects (the chemically-induced anorexia is dangerously subtle, for one), and I'm still a little wary about what exactly it's done to me long term (since I still sweat more than usual and occasionally get arm-tingles, and I stumble over my words much more often now), but the short stint I did with venlafaxine did honestly save me a lot of suffering, both when I was in the thick of my struggles and now that I'm recovering. Turned down the dial on my anxiety enough that I could function again.

So uh. if anyone's got a theory as to what could have been rewired up in the gray matter of my noggin that'd be great, because I'm absolutely baffled. placebo effect should have worn off by now?? SNRIs aren't supposed to work like this?? is it even POSSIBLE that anything was permanently shifted??? send help

I am missing you tonight. Some transphobes tried to get us down but I didn’t let them. The mods were great on all of my posts that were affected, and that was very encouraging. I think I got brigaded? I got a bunch of DMs too. Well, when the first comment came in I just thought real hard on what you would do, and so I did that. Donated to the trans lifeline each time I got a comment or a message, reported, and blocked each account. I usually only donate on your birthday or the anniversary of your passing, but this seemed like a good way to stand up for you and say screw the haters. 

I wish I could talk to you about this now. Text you or call you and we could laugh about the absurd stuff they said. I always knew it was bound to happen one day, especially with how things are right now in our country. You know, I always thought it would really really upset me. That I would cry and be upset. But I didn’t, and I’m not. It just made me feel sad for them and how hard their lives must be. We never really talked about it. Did you feel the same? I am certain it is very different when it is you they are attacking. I wish I could hear your thoughts on it. 

It did make me recall one memory of when we were picking up your niece at the bus top. There was an old man waiting there and he said something like hello ladies. And you had the biggest smile. That was a very nice thing to remember. 

I really wanted to keep reading our book today, but I ended up fighting the transphobes for a while. I did, however, make progress in it this morning! I just finished Part One and I am on Interludes I now. Or however those are titled. I like the end of Part One and always have, and really relate to it. 

(I don’t know how to do spoilers on Reddit, so beware of spoilers for Part One of Way of Kings in the next paragraph. Sorry! I doubt anyone will read this, but just in case.)

Anyway, so! The final few pages of part one!!!!! Gosh. They made me cry this time. I used to just get teary, but they really made me think of us and our relationship and how special it was. Kaladin had one foot over the chasm, ready to leap, and Syl brought him a leaf. It made me think of all the times we helped each other not take the next step into the chasm. I’m so sorry I couldn’t be there when the fentanyl pushed you off. I would have caught your hand and tried to pull you up. I wish I had been there and not 12 hours away. I wish our vacation time had been moved up a week early, or that we had settled on ticket times so you wouldn’t have had all that money burning in your pocket. I think that might have made a difference. 

Anyway. The chasm. I also reminisced on how many times since you passed that I’ve had one foot over the chasm and have had to pull myself back all on my own. Gosh, that is hard. Were you over the chasm by yourself at the end? Was it Tuesday? Was it Friday? We last spoke on Tuesday. I assumed something had happened and you were in jail and would call soon, because that happened often enough. So I just sent you happy messages for you to see when you got out. That had been the pattern, you know? I dont respond, its because I am depressed. You don’t respond, its because something went sideways and you are in jail. We had a system. It worked. Until it didn’t, I guess. I do regret that I didn’t think harder about it. I just accepted it, as I have always accepted and loved you just as you were. But maybe if I had thought about it more I could have done something to change the outcome. I don’t know. It’s possible there was nothing I could have done, being 12 hours away. It’s possible that even if I called on Wednesday that would have been too late. I will never know. Was it Tuesday? Was it Friday, like the paperwork says? Did you lay in your apartment for days alone? I hate the thought of you being so alone. I choose to believe it was Friday. 

I don’t remember where I was going with this. I am distracted by so many thoughts tonight. Maybe I should dig out your niece’s contact info and send her a Christmas card. Maybe yearly. To keep in touch. She was the one who told me. She was so good to me. I talked to your whole family afterwards and they were all so kind to me. None of them blamed me for the events that ultimately led to this. They told me they had never blamed me. I blame me still. I wish I had fought harder for you to stay in the apartment with me, convinced you we could make it work and get help and live together and be free. But I was young and unwell and didn’t have all the skills that I have now. I had a lot of emotions and wasn’t able to regulate them and said things I regret. I never actually got to apologize for those individually. We issued each other blanket apologies when we reconnected once you were safe again, but I still wish I could apologize for those things. They were unkind, not okay, and done only because I was feeling abandoned and it was so painful. I am so sorry. 

Remember how I stopped smoking inside when you moved in? Well, I’m back in the same complex now and you can’t do that anymore. No smoking indoors or anywhere on the grounds. Believe it or not, I have to get in my car and go for a little drive around the block to have a smoke. I don’t mind it too much, except in the winter it gets to be dark at like 4:30pm here and then I have to drive in the dark. Which I hate. So I tend not to smoke much at night. 

I live right up the hill from the building we lived in. This building kinda sucks though. Ours was better. 

This is turning into a ramble of all the things that would come up in a conversation with you. I keep wondering if I should end it, but I really don’t want to stop talking to you. Is it okay if I keep going for a little longer? 

I am doing Christmas for the first time in over a decade this year. I didn’t want to do it after you left the apartment and never did it again ever since. But the cats you loved are very old now, and I thought they might like to sleep under a cozy Christmas tree. So I decided to do Christmas. The tree and tree skirt arrive next week, and the things for the cats have already started arriving. They have seasonal holiday toys out for them to use, two Christmas presents hidden in the closet waiting to be wrapped, and DIY paw imprint ornament kits. It is all very fun. I am having a nice time doing all of this for the girls. Anyway, it should all turn out really nice. Mom says I should get myself something to put under the tree too. I don’t know what to get though. You would know. I wish you could tell me. 

It’s hard to believe that in three months time it will have been three years of you being gone. It feels as painful as it did the day I found out. Oh, not all the time anymore. Not all the time. Just sometimes. Recently a lot of times, but I am doing a lot of things trying to honor you and the love we shared. So I suppose it makes sense that it hurts. 

Remember how we had three washes and dryers in that building? Well, this one only has two. And I shit you not they are literally always in use. All day long every day of the week. So I go weeks and weeks without doing laundry (which I hate, you know me) until I finally give up and stay up until 3am to do it when no one else is awake. It seems to be the only way to get anything done. So, I think that is what I will do tonight. I need to do my clothes and I’d like to do my sheets but also the complex has really gone downhill and I hate to give them more money than absolutely necessary, so I might hold off on the sheets as long as I can. Gross, I know, but seriously they have turned into slum lords. My lease ends next summer and I can’t get out of here fast enough. 

My anxiety has calmed down some since starting this. That wasn’t my goal, but I’ll take it. Thank you. You always knew just what to say to make me feel better. I guess you can still do that even from beyond the veil. 

Well, I guess I’ll end this here. Go for one of my little drives. Have a cup of coffee to wake me up so that I can at least get one load of laundry done tonight. 

I love you. Talk later. ",1,1733707097.0,GriefSupport,0,0.99,False

By the time I was 16 my grandmother was one of my closest friends, and I felt very strongly about her. She is a small but intense woman, good natured but also a bit guarded, and sometimes tended to look a bit unsettled or a bit anxious. She was diagnosed with an anxiety and mood disorder, but sometimes I saw her uneasy expression and wondered if there was something else on her mind. I was 16 years old the last time I saw her. 
Grandma had been visiting my parents and I the day that it happened. We were all having a nice time, until out of the blue she started to look very concerned and distressed. She said nervously that she had to get back, she said she loved me, and loved my parents, and she got into her car, left my parent’s house, and that was the last contact we ever had with her. Her car was found parked neatly on the side of the road with the driver’s side door hanging open, and she was gone. Nothing was missing from the car other than my grandmother. That was 6 years ago. No one has seen or heard from her a single time. That was until yesterday. 
Yesterday I received 10 calls in a row from an unknown number. I thought it was spam but decided I might pick up to tell them to stop calling me. When I answered the phone, I heard a voice that made my stomach drop. It was my grandmother. She was half in tears, and she seemed ecstatic to hear my voice. She told me that she loved me, and that she had something very important to tell me, something only I should hear. Her ecstatic response seemed to shift into an intense nervousness. She told me to meet her at a coffee shop in an hour. I wondered what could’ve possible happened to her. 
She was already there when I arrived at the coffee shop. When she saw me she burst into tears and gave me a big hug. I immediately asked what had happened to her, why she couldn’t let us know that she was okay. She said “I wasn’t okay. There are things I need to tell you. This is bigger than you think.” She looked around nervously. “I can’t tell you here in public.” She took a letter out of her purse and handed it to me. It said “With Love, Grandma” on the front. “Read this letter where no one else can see, and you’ll know why I couldn’t contact you.” She said she needed to get back to her hotel room and left abruptly. “Read the letter. I love you.”
I got back to my apartment my mind reeling, desperately wondering why she couldn’t have talked longer, and what the letter might say. I locked the door to my room and sat down on my bed next to the window. My hands trembled as I opened the letter. As I opened the envelope there was no letter at all, instead a handful of Polaroids fell out onto the floor. I picked them up and looked at each one. The first was a blurry photo of a building at night. Next was an image of a simple symbol drawn with a pen. The next was an apartment complex that reminded me of mine. And the next was a blurry door.

Hi, this is my first ever Reddit post and English is not my first language so apologies for any mistakes.

I (21F) and my bf (22M) have been together for almost 1 year. I know it is not a very long time but a lot has happened in this year. First thing you need to know is that he and his ex-gf had a kind of a messy breakup (around November) and it was not long before we got together (in January )(we knew each other already then but no he never cheated with me on her just for context). 
I did feel insecure about her for a long time because I was told for some time that he didn’t have a gf for almost a year but I obviously found out about her because she was blasting his phone with messages on New Years Eve which we celebrated before we got together with some of my friends.

I actually moved to his house after around three months we were together mostly bc of my family situation witch is for another hole story and his parents were very welcoming. I also still study so I can’t afford to pay for an apartment. I very much liked them apart for some situations when they both sometimes accidentally called me the exes name and his dad made jokes about it. So fast forward to now and what the title is actually about:

I endured the other name and some comments for the hole year because apart from that his mom is a sweet woman and they did let me stay here for a long time but right now I’m not really sure what to think.
So me and his mom bought a bottle of wine and decided to have a nice evening that turned out to be a disaster. 
We all were sitting at the table including my bf and his dad and the first mby two hours were so fun and wholesome bc I never had a chance to do that with my parents. But the mom brought another bottle and that was when it started going downhill. 
I still don’t really know why she started talking about it but she eventually told me that she is still in contact with the ex. I learned that they went to get coffee and that they occasionally call and text. I wouldn’t mind this really if I didn’t know the history of them and if she never said the two sentences she did: 
1. That she is like her daughter because she was the first he brought home and because they understood each other in a different way because of their relationship with their mothers. 
And 2. That she has a place in her heart and a connection with her that she think will last forever. (For more context if someone is wondering his mom is 56 and the ex is 21 like me)

I tried to hold it together but lost it a little bit and she just apologized for making me cry.
So I was really puzzled in that moment and talked about it with my bf till like 2am when I decided to ask him the question. I was supposed to spend Christmas with them but in that moment a didn’t feel comfortable even staying there so I asked him if I decided to spend Christmas somewhere else if he would be with me or stay with his family. 

It was not my final decision I just wanted to know if he was on my side because he knew about it and decided not to tell me so I was confused and overthinking everything at this point. 
Maybe is has nothing to with me and I just take it too personally 

So am I really just overreacting this and is it completely normal? ",1,1733706519.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,4,0.67,False
1h9xxrw,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1h9xxrw/mil_doesnt_believe_i_have_a_disabilty/,MIL doesn't believe I have a disabilty,"Using a friend's account as a throw-away so my HB and JNMIL don't come across this. I have a condition that makes walking long distances difficult. On top of this, I fell recently and had been using crutches until 2 weeks ago. My in-laws are visiting and as HB was at work, I went out with them. I explained I would not be walking around the mall with them. 

Dropped them at the entrance, parked nearby in a handicap spot. Then took my time and went in for a coffee because I knew it would be at least 3 hours of shopping. HB calls a few hours later to say they can't find me. I tell him it's odd that I have no missed calls and I'll call them. I call my MIL and they say they're almost back to the entrance. I say HB was worried they were lost and couldn't find me. She says he must have misunderstood. For reference I routinely record my calls with her. Not FIL, just her. Experience has been a rough teacher in our relationship, and really I was getting tired of doubting myself. 

We get back on the road and stop by a bookstore. My leg starts to hurt so she offers to drive us to lunch, FIL doesn't drive much after a stroke and not in unfamiliar surroundings. We get to the restaurant and she doesn't want to valet even though I say it's fine I'll pay. So she decides to drop us by the entrance and I tell her to park in the nearest handicap spot. It's a restaurant my SIL and I go to often, so the valets know us and they always try to seat us in a booth since that's more comfortable for me. I always tip well as they go out of their way to assist with little things. 

My SIL was to meet us, but had an appointment run late, so I got her lunch to go. When we head out, my MIL walks past in the opposite direction of the nearest handicap spot and I don't see my car. I asked her where she parked and she says around the corner. I asked why she didn't just park in the spot that WAS STILL FREE. She says she's not handicapped. I swallowed my response and asked how far she parked, remembering that it took her a bit to come in to the restaurant. She says just a few minutes walk. So I stop, saying I'll sit on a bench while she goes for the car. My FIL now asks how far she parked and she says we're making a big deal of nothing, that I barely walked today, and a brisk 10 minute walk won't kill me. And insists that she will not 'fetch the car'. So I call my SIL, her daughter and tell her what happened. She says stay where I am she'll come for me.

So I stop engaging with my MIL and send my SIL my location. She starts to say I'm being a little b\*\*\*h and if she can make the walk so can I. I explained that persons who drive disabled persons can park in the handicap spot. My SIL and her husband went through the trouble of geting the tags for the vehicle with wheelchair access for me. SIL arrives shortly and FIL decides to come with us. HB calls after a few minutes saying I abandoned his mother and she said his dad came with me to try and convince me to stay. I asked him if that made sense. His sister shouted at him saying he needed to stop being an idiot with their mom.

At this point she calls and reports the car stolen, because it is still in her name. I ignore calls on my phone for the next hour. All along she was calling HB but when the police pick her up, she tries to call me. After a while she gave up and called FIL, who calls HB. HB says I should have stopped SIL from calling the police, how I don't know, or answered the call and tell the police she was lying. 

I have told him over and over she doesn't take my illness seriously and when we visit would do similar things, which is why I stopped going with him to visit them. Which after we had kids meant the kids don't go, because he isn't traveling with 2 kids under 10 for 4 to 6 hours. That forced her to behave for a while, since their first visit to us was a year before the big C lockdowns. But she's starting back up, and this was the worst. So I am going LC again. Which means she will not be allowed to stay in out home. He can't fight that because it's my parents property, and my dad does NOT like her. I haven't spoken to her since the police picked her up. I think it's hilarious. My FIL was embarrassed and is upset with her. He hasn't stopped apologising to me, and he was starting to get upset with my HB because SIL told him HB was saying this was heavily my fault for 'not being the bigger person and understanding she that she doesn't fully understand invisble disabilities'. Somehow my FIL who is over 10 years older than her gets it, even before I had kids and things got worse. After his dad spoke to him, I'm not sure exactly what was said, he was quiet for 2 days then apologised early this morning. Says he just thought I made a big deal about walking around the corner. SIL and her husband came over this morning and reminded him the car has a tracker that we all have access to and when they remembered to check it last night, she had parked 3 blocks away from the restaurant. No way I could have made it, and uphill at that. Her husband looked at him and said it was sad I couldn't depend on on my own husband to protect me. HB looked like he wanted to cry, I did cry. SIL hugged me, told HB to stop being an ass, they weren't kids anymore and he had his own family to take care of. So hopefully this was the wake up call he needed. But we've come close to enlightenment before and he just falls back in the fog. I hope this time with not just me saying this was bad he really gets it.",91,1733706453.0,JUSTNOMIL,16,0.98,False

We talked there for a while and eventually exchanged numbers when we got more comfortable. We FaceTimed a lot, which in turn ended in him asking me out on a date, i obliviously said yes. 

A week or two later, we met up for coffee. He picked me up, and to my surprise, I found a big teddy bear in the backseat accompanied by coloring books, as I had told him I like to color. We went to dinner and I felt like I was on cloud 9! He’s everything I look for in a guy; honesty, respect, silliness, love, you name it. 

We went on a second date where he took me on a walk through a park, as he held my hand the whole way through and we even took some pictures on a lake. I loved every bit of it. He texted me saying he wanted to do this again. 

After our third date, which was for ice cream, he texted me a few days later saying we were done and he wasn’t sure about his living situation, due to him living with his parents and having 8 siblings, 2 of them being on the autism spectrum. He said his parents were downsizing on their home, because they believe that they shouldn’t have to rely on them when they’re all 18 and older. This obviously left me very confused and upset. I cried myself to sleep for a week, holding the teddy bear he gave me, just so I could feel him. 

A while later, he texted me apologizing for all the pain he’s caused me; that he didn’t want to put me through so much hurt and suffering. I asked what was gonna happen and he said his landlord might give him the possibility of staying where he is with his brothers while his parents go their own way. We still keep in touch but he says he’s been busy with working two jobs, as well as finding work for his brothers. He still reacts to any kind of coloring page I sent him but that’s about it. He said by the 27th this month, he’ll let me know what’s going to happen with us, as well as him and his brothers.

I feel so selfish for wanting to get back together with him, but also feel sorry for the situation he’s going through. Maybe I should stop being so unfair but is there a chance we might get back together? ",1,1733706215.0,love,3,0.99,False
