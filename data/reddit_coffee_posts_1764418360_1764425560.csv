1p9pjpp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p9pjpp,My 2nd-ever international trip: Paris in November ❤️,"I (25F) just got back to the States after spending almost a week in Paris. It was my second time ever leaving the country (the first was a trip to Honduras in 2021), so I had sky-high expectations - and Paris delivered on every single one!

What a stunning city. In about 5 days, we saw the Louvre, Eiffel tower, Musée d’Orsay, Notre Dame, Saint-Chappell, the Arc de Triomphe, Champs-Elysees, Montmartre, Galeries Lafayette, the Pantheon, Jardin du Luxembourg, and more! We stayed in the Latin Quarter, and walked/took the Metro everywhere. We averaged over 25K steps per day. 

Paris was lovely in November - chilly, slightly rainy, and not too crowded. The city was cleaner than I’d expected, and I felt very safe everywhere we went. The Parisians we met were very kind and accommodating, and almost everyone spoke English (although we had some French speakers in our group too, which helped). 

Some of my personal highlights: 

1. The Louvre. We spent 3.5 hours here and I easily could’ve stayed for days. There is so much to see - both the paintings and the buildings themselves. We pre-booked tickets for 9am and only had to wait around 10 minutes to get in. Definitely a must see!

2. The Eiffel tower at night. We had originally planned to go during the day, but ended up waiting until 6pm. The city views were stunning at night, and we ended up being inside of the tower while it sparkled, which was so cool. It also wasn’t too crowded - about 30 mins in line. 

3. We went to a jazz club (Caveau de la Huchette) our last night and it was amazing. Such a fun atmosphere. The main room is inside of a cave! Everyone was dancing and singing along, and we had a great time. We ended up staying for hours and left early in the morning. 

4. The food and drinks (especially the coffee)! Our group is full of coffee drinkers. We were impressed by how many coffee shops/cafes there are in Paris, and how high-quality they are. We went to approx. 2 coffee shops per day, and they all were delicious. The coffee is strong and smooth. They don’t offer sugary syrups or flavors like the US, but you don’t need them since the espresso is so good. 

5. The walkability and public transit. You can get to almost anywhere in Paris by walking or taking the Metro/RER. They just permanently stopped selling paper Metro tickets this month, but you can buy a Navigo card for £2.50 and load passes onto that. Each pass is an additional £2.50 and can get you almost anywhere in the city. The system was easy to use, efficient, and safe. It’s similar to the NYC subway, but cleaner and (in our case) less crowded. 

Overall, my trip to Paris was even better than I had anticipated it would be. Thank you to this sub for helping me plan and providing travel advice. I loved Paris, and I’ll definitely be going back as soon as I can! ❤️",12,1764424556.0,ParisTravelGuide,1,1.0,False

Moving to North Shoreview in San Mateo, hopefully near the bay and closer to parks. We are excited but also a bit nervous since it is a new neighborhood for us. I would love to hear honest experiences from people who live there or nearby.

Specifically, I am curious about:
	•	Parks and walkability
	•	Which parks or walking paths do you actually use and enjoy?
	•	Pests and general nuisances
	•	How bad are mosquitoes or bugs, especially in warmer months or near the water?
	•	Any issues with rodents, raccoons, or other critters around homes or yards?

Crime and safety
	•	How safe do you feel walking around during the day and at night?
	•	Any recurring issues like car break ins, package theft, or other crimes to be aware of?
	
Flooding and drainage
	•	Have you seen any real flooding issues during heavy rain or king tides?
	•	Any specific streets or corners that tend to pool water or have drainage problems?

Noise and air quality
	•	Any plane noise, traffic noise, or construction that surprised you?
	•	Smells or air issues from nearby roads, industry, or the wastewater treatment plant?


Other “I wish I had known” things
	•	Anything about schools, commute patterns, wind, fog, parking, or neighbors that you wish someone had told you before you moved in?
	•	Any local tips for services, favorite coffee shops, restaurants, or hidden gems nearby?

Please feel free to share the good, the bad, and any practical suggestions for new homeowners in the area. All perspectives are welcome.

Overall as a home brewer didi find worth it. It's more for cafe owners etc to network and get good exposure. 

However found a few brands I hadn't heard of before.

The one that stood out was First Crack. Based out of Rajasthan, had one of the best floral brews i have  had (Pic attached: Ratnagiri Naturals). The prices there were inflated due to the scam of exclusive payments by AtomX in such events. Why aren't regular payments allowed is beyond me. The vendors themselves seemed irritated by it as well and recommended ordering online for better rates. 

Anyway, would highly recommended especially given the reasonable rates on there website

I've been trying to wrap my head around this and could use some perspective. It feels like I'm spending 4-5 hours every single day just on outreach. Between trying to find the right audience, crafting posts, engaging in different communities, and the occasional cold call, it's a massive time sink.

It's a full-time job on top of actually building the product. The part that really gets me is how fragile it all is. You can spend weeks building a presence, then post one link a platform's algorithm doesn't like, and your account is just gone.

I see so many founders burn out from this exact cycle. The sheer exhaustion and frustration lead them to give up before they can get any real traction. It feels totally unsustainable.

So, I'm genuinely curious: How are you all solving this? Is everyone just running on pure grit and coffee, or am I missing a smarter approach? There must be a better way, right?",1,1764424236.0,Entrepreneurship,4,1.0,False
1p9pdrm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p9pdrm,Healing progress photos for post-session 1 with Cutera Enlighten,"Hi, all! I just started my removal journey 9 days ago. The tattoo was really well done, but way too big for my personal taste, and the artist added lots of back-shading that I had specifically expressed I didn’t want. I’ve been lurking here for about 4 months and doing lots of research on what to expect and how to optimize results from this long removal process. Despite all the preparing, at 12 hours after laser, the SHOCK and fear I felt at seeing how swollen and red my forearm was when I unwrapped had me wishing for others’ more detailed healing progress photos. By day 7-9, the aggressive look had mostly calmed, and I’m pretty pleased with the results so far. 

Photos 4 and 5 show detailed, nearly day-by-day healing results. 

*Healing description*:
-Peak swelling was from 12-48 hours
-Peak redness 1-48 hours. At day 9 now, it’s mostly just some small patches of dusty pink. 
-Blistering formed from days 2-5; started wrinkling day 5 - not painful unless accidental friction. Collapsed and disappeared on day 7. 
-Black ink appeared to darken on day 5 or 6. Haven’t noticed this fading much yet.
-Mild tenderness day 3-5 (mostly from swelling)

*My habits*:
-First 3 days, I iced every 1-2 hours. First 3 nights, I slept with arm elevated. I should’ve elevated another night or two, but I was tired and missed my warm Trex fold sleeping position. 
-I typically run every day. But I took a break for the 24 hours before session and 7 days after session. I wanted the swelling gone and the blisters to be fully flat and dry before I reintroduced sweat/heat/friction. 
-I’ve been drinking 80-100 oz water daily, but allowing myself my one cup of coffee. I took Tylenol for swelling. My daily supplements included magnesium, turmeric, bromeline, zinc, omega 3s, and a multivitamin. I ate a whole foods, low sodium, low simple sugar diet. Lots of protein and fiber.

There are Baby Boomers and their adult children that get along, and they let their sons and daughters live in the house until they were mid to late 20s no problem, and there was no abuse, and it was a good environment and the sons and daughters could save.  There are Baby Boomers that helped fund their adult children's projects and ideas and helped them with their careers.

But there seems to be a good chunk of Baby Boomers - or what's been your experience - that are adverse to help.  The idea of help seems offensive to them.  It's like well, in 1975 I was able to buy a house.  I just worked 5 years and put a downpayment on it.  My parents (WWII Gen) let me stay at home until I was 21, and I saved there and got me a huge house with a yard that is worth 2 million dollars now.  I just crossed the street with my resume and John hired me and I worked there for 40 years.  So if you can't do the same, something is wrong with you.

It's fine to share your experiences, and fine to offer your advice, but also, for f\*ck sake, LISTEN.  OPEN YOUR EYES.  KEEP YOUR EGO IN CHECK, BABY BOOMERS.

You hear and read comments like oh they (the super young little kid 30-something year olds) just prioritize Starbucks coffee over wanting to save for a house.

So look if a Baby Boomer worked hard, and made smart decisions and his or her house is now worth over a million dollars (and they're living in it, so it's not even a huge advantage) I have no issues.  Good for them.  But I have issues when they won't help the next generation, when they don't help their kids.  They would rather their adult kids struggle, work low paying jobs for 15 years (from like 22 to 37 years old) to try to save for additional schooling to get started on a career that pays better, instead of just here, here's the few thousand dollars that we easily could transfer you.  Some let their kids go homeless, will argue over even paying for life changing medical treatment.

Here are 5 creator tools that seriously leveled up my game (and hopefully will level up yours too!):

*   **Headline Analyzer:** Seriously, stop guessing! Are your headlines even clickable? A good headline analyzer will tell you, giving you actual data instead of just relying on gut feeling. Changed my click-through rates like crazy!
*   **A Decent Grammar Checker:** Look, we all make typos. But glaring grammar errors scream ""unprofessional."" A solid grammar checker (even a free one!) is essential. Trust me, your audience will thank you.
*   **Easy-Peasy.AI:** This one is *amazing* for anyone diving into AI-powered content creation. It's super intuitive and packed with features. Plus, for the security-conscious folks (like me!), they've got some seriously impressive AI encrypted options. Think ninja-level privacy for your ideas. 🤫
**Small affiliate disclaimer:** If you find Easy-Peasy.AI useful and decide to sign up through my link (https://easy-peasy.ai/?via=aca), I may earn a small commission. This helps support the community!
*   **A Project Management Tool (Even a Simple One!):** Trello, Asana, even a shared Google Sheet can be a lifesaver. Keeping track of your content pipeline, deadlines, and ideas is key to staying sane (and actually finishing things!).
*   **Canva:** Obvious? Maybe. But are you *really* leveraging it? From social media graphics to thumbnails, Canva makes creating visually appealing content shockingly easy. Plus, they have templates for EVERYTHING. Why struggle when you can just tweak a pre-made design?

Seriously, these tools aren’t magic bullets, but they're like giving yourself a serious head start.

What are *your* go-to tools when you're feeling overwhelmed? What's that one thing you wish someone had told you when you were first starting out? I'm always on the hunt for new tricks to make life easier! 🤔",1,1764423501.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

1p9p3uk,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1p9p3uk/notes_from_a_week_in_the_marais/,Notes from a week in the Marais,"**Staying in the Marais**

Not sure why there have been/are so many negative comments about staying in the Marais. For us it was absolutely perfect. Tons of local food shops, vintage shops etc. Sure there's a big brand store here and there but they are pretty rare. A lot of great places to eat between the 3/4/11 (and 1/2) that you can walk to and the Metro is SO easy to use. 

We used The Fork to find a lot of great smaller places to eat and if you wanted to you could probably spend a whole week not walking more than 10 minutes from your hotel. And a ton of bars and good spots to have a nightcap when you are done for the night. Absolutely would stay there again.

**Metro**

We didnt take a cab or uber once other than to/from the airport. I think if people do 5 minutes worth or research or YouTube watching they can figure it out with zero problems - and if you've ever taken public trains pretty much anywhere, forget it, its easy. We took it just about everywhere and if we got tired of walking, just hoped on the train back. We saw a ton of security/police doing card checks in the stations and we did see people frequently walking through broken lanes straight onto the trains. 

But for $2.50 a ride or whatever it is, its so much easier than taking cabs. Using CityMapper made it fool proof, it tells you what line and direction to take, how many stops, where to stand on the train and what exit to take. If you've never taken it and you finally do, you will kick yourself at how easy it is.

**Crowds**

Honestly I dont know why people talking about an ""off season"" in Paris, we found it mobbed no matter where we went. Even sort of out of the way places like the Army museum was packed with people. The Louvre? Forget it, its almost not worth going anymore. Getting in couldnt be easier and they do a great job of getting you in \*fast\*. Problem is once you are in there, no matter where you go, it was wall to wall people. We usually like to walk around there for a few hours but I dont think we'd go back. 

We'd probably go back in the spring/fall vs winter again, I'd rather have it be a touch warmer knowing that its not like the winter is empty or even that much less crowded.

**Food**

We ate at a pretty wide variety of spots. Went to Les Ombres one night which was the most expensive but I found surprisingly worth it. I thought it might be a little touristy but the food/wine selection was actually pretty good and the cost was not bad at all. Found a great ramen place on Rue St Denis that hit the spot one night and an absolutely mobbed dumpling shop near the Enfants de Marches that was tiny but so good. Hit the Christmas market one day for lunch and the Bastille Market Sunday morning for breakfast. 

Look, no doubt you can find a lot of great Michelin star dining in Paris - we ate at Palais Royal last time and it was to die for. But I dont think people talk enough about how many great spots there are where two people can eat and have a good bottle of wine for $100.

**Tipping**

We only found one egregious spot (Musee de Orsay cafe) where the waiter stood there and asked us how much we'd like to add for the tip and even then we just said nothing and he clicked the machine and handed it to us. I'd say 1/3 of the spots had an option in the swipe to add a tip but most of them did not even do that. If I had to really break it down, the places that were more local/locals focussed didnt even have an option for tipping.

**Coffee**

This is a random side note but I have no idea why so many of the local coffee spots recommended by people that live there open at like 9 or 10 or even 11. Or were closed three random weekdays. Sure they looked like nice spots. But where are the coffee shops for people who are actually...awake in the morning. You want to know why Starbucks is \*packed\* full of locals? Its the only place thats open when people actually, you know, want coffee LOL.

  
**CDG**

Honest to God after 3 trips through there I dont know that I've flown through a worse or more confusing airport. Even the people working there half the time seem to have no clue where to send you and it just turns into absolute mayhem with crowds of people just standing around. Even if you have priority bags they take forever to get out. I've flown to/through/from maybe 15 European airports and it remains my least favorite. Someone gave us the guideline to leave your hotel in Paris 4 hours before your flight and I might leave myself more time next time.

For months, I’d wake up feeling sluggish, almost groggy in a way that no amount of coffee could fix. I thought it was just stress or bad sleep, but deep down, I knew something else was off.

It started with a conversation with my roommate, who casually mentioned, You should really rinse your shower mat more often it’s probably getting gross. I laughed it off at first, but later that night, I actually took a good look. The mat was grimy, damp, and smelled faintly musty. Something clicked. I washed it, hung it out to dry, and also decided to give my bathroom a proper scrub.

The next morning, the change was subtle but noticeable. Stepping into a clean, fresh-smelling bathroom while brushing my teeth and washing my face made me feel awake. Energized. Suddenly, my morning felt intentional, not like I was dragging myself through routine motions.

From there, I started noticing other small habits I’d ignored. I replaced my old toothbrush, washed my hair more regularly, and even started keeping a small bottle of hand sanitizer on my desk. It wasn’t about being perfect or expensive it was about feeling clean, organized, and cared-for.

Within a week, my energy improved, my confidence increased, and my mental space felt clearer. Something as small as a clean shower mat triggered a chain reaction of better hygiene habits that completely changed how I started my day.

1p9p0sz,https://www.reddit.com/r/gayrelationships/comments/1p9p0sz/priorities_is_the_one_most_important_thing/,Priorities is the one most important thing,"One thing I (M56) have learnt after a few decades of gay dating – it’s all about priorities. If you are feeling any kind of interest in someone you meet, you are willing to re-prioritize. And what governs those priorities is where you are on the scale interest-to-disinterest. What do I mean with this?

Let’s say you meet someone from a dating app. And both of you feel an immediate, strong attraction to one another. Sexual attraction. It wouldn’t take long before the two of you end up in someone’s bed. In that case, you find yourself on the 100% mark on the interest gauge. I would guess that, for young, equally and very attractive guys that see each other for the first time, that’s the only thing it takes. A mutual 100% reading and boom – you score. But that’s the easy game.

The challenge is when you find someone in borderline territory, or the guy you are meeting finds you in that place as well. And that is where priorities will become significant. His priorities will guide the relationship between the two of you to either failure or success.

In an ideal world, there are only two outcomes from when you meet someone on a date (that actually includes both nightly booty calls, as well as more relaxed coffee dates).

Either, you say: *“Thanks for the meeting. I had a nice time. Unfortunately I wasn’t into you”*. Proposing friendship as a way out here is both dishonest, disrespectful and cowardly. No, just make a clean cut. Your gauge has bottomed out on the disinterest mark. Fine. Move forward.

Or, there was something about this guy that you found attractive, albeit not attractive enough to want to go sleep with him that very same evening. But your interest in him is strong enough for you to want to see him again. And that soon. You want to make things happen. And if you are a busy man with a tight schedule, you have to make a choice. You have to re-prioritize. You might tell one of your lady friends *“Hey Sarah, I know we said we were going for a coffee on Wednesday. But I met this guy, and I think I need to see him again soon to find out where this is going. Would you be mad at me if we go for that coffee next week instead?”* Or, this other guy texts you and asks if you are available the next day. Maybe then, you are willing to skip one of your yoga classes just that once.

It's an iterative process, of course. Maybe you realize after that second meeting that he wasn’t after all that interesting. Then, you turn him down respectfully, exactly as in the first case. Or, you keep re-prioritizing.

This is in an ideal world, yes. The problems arise when one or the other doesn’t have the guts to tell you honestly what’s going on. That’s why people get ghosted, or passively-aggressively friend zoned. Maybe you tell him it was nice meeting him, and you would like to see him again, but you need to work a lot the next couple of weeks. And then you hope that the situation will resolve by itself, that he stops texting you after a while.

But what about friendship? Yes, of course. I have quite a few gay friends of mine. But those friendships developed in a completely different way, than originating from a date where you both met in order to spot attraction. If you are going on a date with someone, your objective is not to find friends, and you don’t mentally accommodate for that outcome in the first place. Of course, there might be exceptions there as well. If you both, when you meet, realize and admit that you feel no attraction whatsoever, but you might have a special common interest or hobby, you might want to meet again to pursue that hobby of yours. But that is something the two of you will discover *during the meeting*.

This is at least my experience, but I’m interested in hearing your story on this matter.",4,1764423045.0,gayrelationships,0,1.0,False

If you're trying to decide between a drawing tablet and an iPad for your art, you're probably feeling a bit stuck. Both options have their perks, but they work pretty differently. Let's break down what makes each one special so you can figure out which fits your needs better.

## What's a Drawing Tablet Anyway?

A drawing tablet is a device that connects to your computer and lets you draw digitally using a special pen. Think of it like a super-powered mouse designed specifically for artists. The tablet picks up pen pressure and tilt, which means your brush strokes can look more natural and realistic. Most drawing tablets need to be plugged into a laptop or desktop to work.

## The iPad Approach

An iPad is basically a standalone computer in tablet form. You can download art apps like Procreate or Adobe Fresco and start creating right away. Everything happens on the screen you're looking at. It's portable, wireless, and doesn't need another device to function.

## Price Comparison

Here's where things get interesting. iPads can cost anywhere from $300 to over $1,000, and that's before you buy the Apple Pencil (another $80-130). Drawing tablets have a much wider price range. You can find decent beginner models for under $50, while professional-grade options might run $200-500. If you're on a tight budget, a [drawing tablet](https://athomewave.com/drawing-tablet) gives you more bang for your buck.

## Drawing Experience

Both tools offer pressure sensitivity, but they feel different. With a drawing tablet, you look at your computer screen while your hand moves on the tablet surface. This takes some getting used to, kind of like rubbing your belly and patting your head at the same time. With an iPad, you draw directly on the screen, which feels more like traditional paper and pencil.

The Apple Pencil is super responsive with almost zero lag. Quality drawing tablets also have great response times, especially the mid-range and higher-end models.

## Software and Apps

iPads run iOS apps, which means you're limited to what's available in the App Store. The good news? There are tons of amazing art apps made specifically for iPad. Drawing tablets work with whatever software you have on your computer - Photoshop, Clip Studio Paint, Krita, you name it. This flexibility matters if you already have favorite programs or need specific tools for work or school.

## Portability Matters

iPads win hands-down for portability. Throw it in a backpack and draw anywhere - at a coffee shop, on the bus, or in bed. Most [drawing tablets](https://athomewave.com/drawing-tablet) need a computer nearby, which makes them more of a desk setup situation. Some fancier display tablets work standalone, but those cost significantly more.

## Screen Size Reality

If you go with a non-display drawing tablet, your workspace is your computer monitor - which is probably pretty big. iPad screens max out at 12.9 inches. Some artists feel cramped on smaller screens, while others love the compact size.

## Making Your Choice

Pick a drawing tablet if you want affordable entry into digital art, already have a computer, use specific desktop software, or don't need to create art on the go. They're perfect for students, hobbyists, and professionals who work from a dedicated studio space.

Go with an iPad if portability is essential, you prefer drawing directly on screen, want an all-in-one device, or don't mind spending more upfront. It's ideal for artists who travel, work in different locations, or want something that's ready to use out of the box.

## The Bottom Line

Neither option is ""better"" - it depends completely on how you work and what you need. Both can produce amazing artwork in the right hands. Think about your budget, workspace, and how you plan to use it. The best tool is the one you'll actually use consistently, not the one that costs more or has fancier specs.",1,1764422739.0,UmmAmazon,0,1.0,False

Mostly cuz of my shyness

I guess you can say i am an introvert. 

So I will start from the beginning, I have been liking this girl from my work i have been seeing her for sometime One day i gathered the courage and went to her and gave myself an intro and just asked the general stuff and she was asking the same (cuz i had asked and she did it out of courtesy) After that i was having general chats with her everyday atleast once ,

nothing much just the usual “Hi , Bye , had lunch ? , busy day ? “ and all those

This was going on for 2 weeks

And after that i gathered the courage and asked her on a coffee date not too far just in the food court below our office She said she was okay and we can go in the evening !

I was genuinely excited and surprised that she accepted so easily I was eagerly waiting for that time to come all day And when fateful time came

First i will tell from my POV what happened

I went out and looked in her place she was not there waited for some time and asked her friend if she had left for the day and she said yeah ,

After that my mind went into overdrive mode and i started thinking that if she had planned it like this from the beginning or something

So with little hope of what i had , i thought maybe she was waiting for me in the food court and went there searched but of no use

But after that i know shouldnt have done this but i took her number from our office whatsapp group and gave a call hoping she was waiting somehwere

She picked up the call and  i was like “I am so and so , i have been waiting here , did you leave for the day or something ? “

Her reply was “yes yes bro it got late and i had left for the day “

I was shattered after this And thought alot of negative things

But after an hour or so i a got a call from her

This is where i got to know what happened from her POV

She seemed to have looking for me in which “she thought was my place” which was not ( i was sitting there helping a friend ) and thought i had left for the day

And she left as well and when i called her , she thought i was someone else hence she said “bro”

After getting to know this i first apologised for getting her number from the office group and all

And we had the call for like 10-15 mins where i got to know she is someone  who is getting famous on Instagram she currently has 2.5k followers and she is currently doing some acting gigs

I paid no mind to these details

after this we started having convo in whatsapp it was mostly kind of late off reply convo where i was asking something and she will reply after 4 or 6 hours and i will ask something again and the cycle continues

But lately i didnt share about her Instagram status to anyone but lately a lot of people have been talking with her ,

Maybe this is my insecurities kicking in but i have started to think “maybe i am not so special to her and if anyone had done what i have done till now she would reacted the same way, i am just one among many for her”

whatsapp convo have been monotonous i ask skmething abiut her and she replies for that, thats it

So what can i do to make her notice me , i genuinely don’t know what to do anymore, what can i do to make her feel i am special in her eyes ? Can anyone help me here

TLDR: it’s a high baseline level or unregulated norepinephrine in the prefrontal cortex, caused by a rare subtype of ADHD 

For those that can stay a bit longer, enjoy… 

This hangover effect was actually a strong clue that led to my breakthrough of being able to be treated correctly for my ADHD. 

I had untreated ADHD for about 36 years now. I’ve tried Adderal, vyvanse, concerta, Ritalin, etc. nothing worked and it always left me feeling really angry, irritable, zoned out like a zombie. Etc. 

I took this hangover effect that I have and several other symptoms / clues (as well as my genetic profile from 23 and me) and I spent months going back and forth with chatgpt until it was able to spot a pattern that led to my absolute breakthrough. 

This is caused by having a very rare subtype of ADHD (less than 1% of the ADHD community has this) where you have a low baseline level of dopamine and high COMT 
(The mechanism that breaks down and clears your dopamine) which results in your already low dopamine levels being cleared way way way too quickly. 

This results in your prefrontal cortex substituting the only other catecholamine it has available as a backup option, norepinephrine. 

This results in issues like emotional disregulation, irritability, feeling constantly on edge, face and ears getting hot when you drink coffee even. Symptoms of irritability often worsening with coffee/caffeine (since it raises NE even higher). 

With this subtype of adhd, none of the amphetamine class of medication will ever work because they raise NE along with dopamine. I used this information to find the right class of medication that finally worked for me (this is not medical advice, just my experience). Dexmethylphenidate, which disproportionally increases dopamine much more than NE. This as a microdose (.8mg) has been a GAME CHANGER. 

How this relates to the hangover effect. My high baseline level of norepinephrine caused by my ADHD subtype cause the following sequence to occur… 

When drinking alcohol (beer for me), both the alcohol and hops have a dramatic lowering effect on NE. Which lasts well into the next day. Additionally alcohol increases dopamine a therapeutic amount while I am drinking. The lowering of NE causes a deeper sleep and more restorative rest, as well as a resolution to the anxiety and tension I carry ALL DAY. 

This explains why when I drink just even a couple cans of non alcoholic beer before bed, It has almost the exact same effect as drinking regular beer in causing me to relax.. because hops lower NE (I drink athletic brewing company’s NA beer because the hops are potent). So as a tip, if you want relief from stress and want to be able to use the hangover effect to help without becoming an alcoholic, consider trying NA beer. It really helps. 

That’s all I got for now! Hope that helps! ",3,1764422431.0,hangovereffect,6,0.8,False

1p9om1q,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1p9om1q/getting_tired_of_my_31m_insecurities/,Getting tired of my [31M] insecurities.,"I am a [35] and me and my boyfriend have been together nearly four years and plan on moving in together this Spring, we were supposed to move in last year but decided we needed to work through some issues first, one of the biggest being his insecurities. I told myself that I’m done trying to constantly make him feel “safe,” meaning I want to be able to go out alone, have days to myself without needing to explain why, and not feel like I have to prove anything, we already share locations and communicate where we are, so there’s nothing shady happening.

Yesterday I went to see my friend of six years, someone I haven’t seen in almost a year, I told him earlier in the week that I was planning to go, and when I arrived I told him again and even sent pictures of her and her dogs, which honestly felt silly, but he still got upset because I didn’t remind him right before I left, even though I had already told him my plans. He used the reasoning “What if something happened to you?” but it felt more like he was worried I’d do something behind his back.

I have never cheated, but he’s always been insecure. What made him even more insecure was a guy friend I had of 12 years, someone I introduced to his now-wife, and he occasionally checked in on me, once suggesting we grab coffee so he could vent about personal things, I didn’t go and when he jokingly said “I guess I love you more than you love me,” I didn’t say it back because I knew my boyfriend would take it the wrong way. My boyfriend later went through my phone one night because he said I was acting suspicious, which I wasn’t, and he found the messages and questioned why I watched a show alone without mentioning him, the truth was I was embarrassed to talk about him sometimes because of the way he previously behaved and spoke to me. I had vent to my guy friend about that and he wasn’t happy about it. At all. Mind you I don’t tell people or my parents on what happens in my relationships because I don’t what people to look at him bad. But that particular incident I had to. I felt like shit. But it’s taken me a long time to introduce him to friends because he can be awkward and dismissive of different views.

I ended my friendship with my guy friend and his wife, I communicate more (maybe not on his timeline but I do communicate), and I’m planning on introducing him to my female friend to make him more comfortable, but he still says what I did was disrespectful and “not how people behave in relationships,” and I’m wondering if he’s right because I feel like I’m making a lot of sacrifices while he still gets upset over normal independence. He’s a great person but his insecurity makes me feel like I’m not allowed to be free, he’s never been in a relationship before but I have, and while our relationship is good in many ways, it still comes with these heavy barriers.",1,1764421870.0,relationshipadvice,1,1.0,False
1p9om1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p9om1p/aita_for_being_annoyed_at_my_daughter_because_it/,AITA for being annoyed at my daughter because it looked like she was upset?,"I (41F) got into an arguement with my husband (47M) about me thinking that he is cheating on me in his game that he plays, we were both on the couch, and so was our daughter (15F).

My daughter stared off into the distance with weird looks on her face, which annoyed me, so I told her if she is upset, to go to her room, she told me she wasn't upset and asked me why I said that, and I told her that she's staring off into the distance making stupid faces.

Me and my husband continued arguing, and then I got up off the couch to go into the kitchen for something, I came back, and my daughter stared at me as I talked to her, but it looked like she was making puppy dog eyes at me to make me feel guilty (for arguing with my husband), so that pissed me off, and I told her, ""If this is upsetting you, please go to your room."", to which she responded that she isn't upset about this, and I responded back, ""Well then don't make puppy dog eyes at me please!""

She told me that she wasn't, to which I responded that yes she was, she was looking at me with *this face* (I remade the face that she was making at me), and she continued to argue that she wasn't, to which I responded, ""Ok, it's over now, move on!""

She continued to tell me she wasn't making puppy dog faces at me, and said so what if she was, and I told her, ""It's annoying, you're acting like I'm doing something wrong!""

She continued arguing with me, I told her to stop, to move on, that it was over, and that it doesn't matter.

Before she went back to her room and probably cried back there, I saw a bunch of trash on the coffee table in the living room (since we always put trash on there), and since I was already frustrated and annoyed, I told my daughter and my husband, ""I need you guys to start helping around more!"", to which my daughter said that she does help and clean after herself, and I responded back, ""No you don't, I just had to clean a whole bunch of stuff from your bedroom floor!""

My daughter explained that yes, I had to clean things from her bedroom floor, but after that, she's been helping around more and cleaning up after herself, but I wasn't hearing any of it because I was so tired of her, and I told her, ""Just stop, you always go on and on and I just can't!""

After that, she went to her room and probably cried, and I went back to the bedroom with my husband because I had told him that if he went to the room with his phone to play his game, I would follow him back there because I want to see what he is doing, and he went back there.

I feel bad for snapping at my daughter as a result of something little that I felt like she did wrong after having an arguement with my husband that she had to watch, but she often makes weird faces at me trying to make me feel guilty and like I'm doing something wrong for things that I should not feel guilty about, and I am just so tired of it.

I don't know if I'm in the wrong for being overly snappy with my daughter over something little, or if I was in the right to do so because I am just so tired of her making me feel guilty for everything and acting like I am doing something wrong, she has done it so much, and I just want her to stop. Please tell me what y'all think.

The only way to lose weight is through a calorie deficit, there is no shortcuts. Fad diets don’t work they usually put you in a yo-yo cycle. I know because I’ve lost weight myself. When you realize losing weight is very easy it just requires you to build consistent habits and proper guidance (if you’re not knowledgeable on this topic and you need assistance) 
Anyways here’s some tips to control your cravings on a calorie deficit :)
1. Drink coffee - Don’t drink coffee to “lose appetite” instead use this when you’ve eaten your calories needed for the day and you feel like diving into those tempting cookies and chips on the pantry. It works and keeps your appetite down for 2-6hrs

2. Engage in hobbies- Do things that occupy your mind most of the time it can be anything reading books, watching movies, crafting origami’s, painting, sketching (whatever you love doing)

3. Add a weekly/monthly treat meal - we all love eating those delicious junkies don’t we? Eh? Don’t make your diet too restrictive, eat your favorite meal once every week or twice every month. Plus eating more than your daily intake once after a period of time helps your metabolism be faster ;) win-win

4. Track your progress but not too obsessively-
When you’re not obsessed with every single number on the scale or every single inch you lose. You don’t get stressed too much. Do it once a week or twice every month. 

5. Stay consistent- remember that good things require good effort tho If you join my program I can help assist you and guide you better.. Don’t be afraid if you overeat when you didn’t intend to. We’re all just humans. It’s not about being perfect but being consistent with it that makes all the difference.

1p9o7uw,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelAroundAsianatur/comments/1p9o7uw/top_5_best_homestay_in_kerala/,Top 5 Best Homestay in Kerala,"# The Charm of Kerala Homestays

They don't say Kerala is God's Own Country for nothing, do they? Of course, the backwaters and beaches take one's breath away, but it's really the people that make this place unforgettable: the warmth in their smiles, stories over chai, and home-cooked meals tasting like love.

And what would be the best way to feel that side of Kerala?

Stay in a locally run homestay — every stay will feel like visiting with old friends you just hadn't met yet.

Let us take a leisurely walk through the **Top 5 Best** [**Homestay in Kerala**](https://www.sukruthamfarmstay.com/) that combine comfort, culture, and nature in the most appealing way.

# How to Choose the Right Homestay in Kerala?

It's not about exotic rooms or glossy photographs; finding that perfect homestay is all about the feeling of belonging. Be it waking up to birds in Wayanad or ringing temple bells in Thrissur, the right homestay makes you feel at home miles away from it.

1. **Choose Your Ideal Environment**

Every nook in Kerala is in a different mood.

* **Thrissur or Wayanad:** For greenery, culture, and warm-hearted hosts.  
* **Munnar:** For those who love cool mornings and endless tea gardens.  
* **Alleppey:** For dreamy backwaters and lazy afternoons on houseboats.  

**Pro tip:** Mix it up — a few nights in the hills, a few by the water: best of both worlds.

1. **Read Beyond the Photos**

Pretty photos are nice, but the real story comes from the guest reviews. Look for food mentions and cleanliness, especially how welcoming the hosts were. [Farm Stay in Kerala](https://www.sukruthamfarmstay.com/farm-stay-rooms.html) can make magic with even the simplest of places.

1. **Ask What's Included**

Most of these homestays have added delights to their offers, like farm walks, cooking demonstrations, or spice plantation tours. And it is in these little touches that the magic lies.

1. **Check Accessibility**

Some of these gems are deep in nature; ask about options for transportation or pick-ups, especially when it is a case where one does not self-drive.

1. **Book Direct, Support Local**

Bookings, wherever possible, should be done directly with the hosts. It's more personalized and aids in keeping hospitality alive in Kerala among local families through livelihoods — like the good people at **Sukrutham Farmstay, Thrissur.**

**Planning Your Kerala Homestay Trip**

Kerala is best enjoyed slow — letting each stay sink in.

**Best Time to Go**

* **October to March:** Weather perfect for sightseeing.  
* **June to August:** Magical monsoon — lush greenery and serenity.

**Plan a Flexible Route**

If possible, try to stay at least two nights in each place. Let your hosts do the guiding — they'll take you to secret waterfalls and local eateries no guidebook can.

**Live Like a Local**

Take a cooking class or try toddy tapping; if you're lucky, join a Theyyam festival. It's those little moments that linger.

**Pack Light, Travel Right**

Cottons, sandals, mosquito repellent, and a light jacket if you're heading uphill.

**Stay Present**

Put away the phone, sip chai, and chat with your hosts. That’s when Kerala really opens its heart.

Proposed order:
Melbourne -> Tasmania -> Whitsundays (Hamilton Island) -> Sydney

Melbourne – 4 nights (Feb 6–10)
	•	Great Ocean Road day trip
	•	Yarra Valley wineries or Phillip Island day trip
	•	1–2 days for city, laneways, coffee, Fitzroy, St Kilda, rooftops

Tasmania – 4 nights (Feb 10–14)
	•	Plan: 2 nights Hobart + 2 nights Freycinet (or Cradle Mountain instead)
	•	Hobart for MONA, waterfront, Mt Wellington
	•	Freycinet for Wineglass Bay, beaches, light hiking, honeymoon-style lodge

Whitsundays / Hamilton Island – 5 nights (Feb 14–19)
	•	Whitehaven Beach day
	•	Great Barrier Reef day (pontoon/snorkel)
	•	Pool/beach chill time, maybe Passage Peak hike and a flex day

	•	Opera House, Circular Quay, The Rocks
	•	Bondi Beach + Bondi to Coogee coastal walk
	•	Manly ferry and beach

1p9o4f4,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/26/science/brandon-williams-nuclear-weapons-nnsa.html,U.S. Nuclear Arms Chief Warns Against Leaks of Secret Information,"Brandon M. Williams was just weeks into his job of supervising the nation’s arsenal of thousands of nuclear bombs and warheads when President Trump put him at the center of a storm over whether the United States should change its posture on nuclear weapons testing.

Now, Mr. Williams, head of the National Nuclear Security Administration, has ordered his subordinates to step up their vigilance against leaks of classified information, signaling a need to preserve the secrets that empower the world’s deadliest weapons.

“This is not a suggestion,” he wrote on Saturday in a memo emailed to the heads of the nation’s nuclear weapons labs and their associated physical plants. “It is an order. Our national security permits no alternative.” The subject line of the note read: “URGENT: Upholding Our Oath.”

The message seemed unusual for its harsh tone and wide distribution.

The email was shared with The New York Times by a former official with knowledge of the nuclear weapon complex who was not authorized to speak publicly about its inner workings.

Unlike many of his predecessors, Mr. Williams has no deep technical roots or experience in running the nation’s nuclear weapons complex. The former Navy officer and one-term congressman from upstate New York was described in a lengthy 2022 Syracuse.com profile as a multimillionaire who starts each morning by reading a section of the Bible.

In taking the N.N.S.A. job, Mr. Williams inherited what some federal and private experts consider an aging world of incompatible parts that can verge on ungovernability. The agency has a budget this year of roughly $25 billion, and its facilities employ some 65,500 people at sites from coast to coast.

“Look at how many contractors they have,” said Henry D. Sokolski, formerly a nuclear policy official in the Defense Department. He added, “You have to accept that your ability to control information, and how the money is spent, takes a hit when you contract out.”

In recent decades, federal officials have taken enforcement actions against scores of offenders involved in security breaches, according to the Department of Energy, which oversees the N.N.S.A. Many involve the nuclear weapon labs.

Last month, President Trump made a surprise announcement that the United States would resume explosive testing, throwing the nuclear complex into disputes over his proposed agenda. Among the objections were those by officials at the N.N.S.A., according to CNN.

Mr. Williams has made no public comments on the swirling controversy, and his letter seems to be directed primarily at the institutional failings and missteps of the giant weapons complex he now oversees rather than on media leaks.

Among the letter’s recipients was the head of a sprawling plant in Kansas City that makes the mechanical guts of America’s nuclear warheads and is bigger than the Pentagon. An investigation concluded this summer found that secret information on the design and production of nuclear arms was compromised in three separate incidents at the site. No criminal charges were filed, but the plant’s managers agreed to a settlement of unspecified civil penalties, improved training and workplace upgrades.

Days after the settlement’s public announcement, Mr. Williams was sworn in as head of the N.N.S.A.

Another recipient of the Williams letter was Thom Mason, the director of Los Alamos, the lab where the atomic bomb was born and where weapons are now designed. He has served in that role since November 2018. Last year, the organization was cited for a security breach.

The violation was characterized as recurring incidents in 2023 and 2024 that involved the introduction of unauthorized items into secure areas. They included cellphones, earbuds with microphones and coffee makers equipped with Bluetooth for remote operation.

The Williams letter implicitly addressed the wide array of violations, ranging from minor to major. Past actions by personnel affiliated with the nuclear agency have “undermined national leadership’s confidence in our ability to safeguard classified and sensitive unclassified information,” the letter began.

He argued that any compromise of that information, “regardless of its perceived sensitivity, represents a direct threat to our strategic interests, our personnel, and the American people we are sworn to protect.”

Mr. Williams said he expected each recipient of the memo “to disseminate this message with the gravity it deserves throughout your respective organizations.”",2,1764420381.0,WhatTrumpHasDone,0,1.0,False

- Back story -
Had terrible stress from work/uni/life but didn't feel sad/depressed, more like burnout. But I started to have panic attacks and pretty bad SI and SH from the stress.

I went on SSRIs for 3 weeks -- horrible side effects, started feeling numb and got more agitated/active and had really intense attacks of SI/not feeling like I was in control. Agitated depression feels like it explains it perfectly. https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/agitated-depression
Stopped SSRIs, felt unstable but not ""depressed', just burnt out with SI and SH tendencies.

- Current situation -
I started on SNRIs (desvenlafaxine, 50mg) expecting terrible side effectsb too but instead felt amazing from day 1.

It's been 10 weeks of just feeling pretty great, at least 1-3hrs a day most days it's like I feel super charged on coffee - I'll clean or weed the whole backyard, rearrange the furniture etc. I barely eat because I'm never hungry. My sleep is generally 7-8 hrs but even if I sleep 4 (like last night), I can get through the work day easy and nothing stresses me out, uni has been a bit of a breeze and I now I can complete assignments the day before where normally id be an anxious mess.
Nothing really effects me either - I can feel sad and cry, angry etc but none of the negative feelings last for more than 5 minutes, or they just don't feel nearly as strong.
Some days I feel so good it's like I'm high, but I'm also so much more productive at work (office work).
Waves of feeling more sexually impulsive, but still feel like I'm being thoughtful about it and not taking huge risks.

In the last week it's felt a little more back to normal - feeling unmotivated/stressed, or extra sad if I drink. But still, sooooo much better than before.

What I'm wondering --- how does hypomania feel? Is it similar to this? Or is this just life of not experiencing depression lolll? I'm feeling better than ever on these SNRIs but having something euphoric at times has made me wonder if this is okay, and if its all going to come crashing down? Doctor is slightly concerned but I'm not risk taking and my sleep is generally okay so we are just keeping an eye on it (I'm also anti stopping my meds because I feel so damn good, but also, that could be a problem)",5,1764419781.0,bipolar2,0,1.0,False

I have a custom arcade coffee table powered by an old Dell Optiplex 755 SFF which works very well but I was thinking of adding a HDMI output to drive the LG OLED in the living room and also adding one or two wireless controllers to enable games on the arcade table to be played on the main TV while sat on the sofa rather than sat on the floor at either end of the coffee table.

The system itself is old purchased back in 2015 but the Optiplex was originally shipped in 2008 and uses Intel Q35 1280x1024 32 bit Integrated Graphics so I guess I would have to add a low-profile graphics card with HDMI output?

How feasible is it that I can find/add a suitable low-profile graphics card that can continue to drive the Dell P1914S 19"" Monitor and output to the LG via HDMI in 2025 and are there any gotcha’s that I need to be aware of?

And is it possible to easily add a couple of wireless controllers/joysticks by using a USB BT dongle or will I have to add some sort of wireless controller board in addition/instead of the iPAC 2?

Would I be better served to completely replace the Optiplex with something more up-to-date that is more powerful, has HDMI built-in and if so what would be a good replacement?

I picked up old hobbies I’d left collecting dust, went on solo coffee dates, met new people online who eventually became friends, and even started reading again — mostly to sort through the million feelings I pretend I don’t have. It’s been grounding. Healing. A little dramatic at times (blame the OPM I listen to). But freeing.

And somewhere in between all that self-discovery, I realized something I didn’t want to admit out loud:

Not in a frantic, “OMG I need a partner” type of way. More like… I have this steady, quiet love in me — the kind meant to be shared in small, everyday moments — and it would be nice if someone wanted to receive it.

Not all at once. Just gradually. Gently. With intention.

*\*Here comes the pitch\**

I want to start with a friendship. The kind where conversations stretch past midnight *because neither of us wants to end it yet.* The kind where we hype each other up about our passions — kahit geeky, weird, or wildly niche.

I’m not looking for instant magic. I’m looking for that slow-burn “let’s see where this goes” energy. Someone who’s willing to go on dates, talk deeply, laugh stupidly, and maybe, if life is kind, build something real.

What I tend to vibe with:

* same age range give or take a few years
* someone curious about the world, politics, people, music, anything
* may at least *one* geeky obsession
* articulate (or at least thoughtful)
* emotionally aware
* and, fine, cute & tall. I’m not gonna lie HAHAHA
* from Manila

About me:

* 5'1
* pretty chill-looking, decent enough, and very comfortable in my own skin
* a science girlie
* love good music
* I fall in love with movies, songs, ideas
* always up for coffee, long drives, or weekend and study dates
* usually busy but I give effort where effort is appreciated

My name is Anthony. I’m a 35-year-old man (US, ET time zone) who thrives on thoughtfulness, curiosity, and mutual experiences.

I’m thoroughly introverted with a bold soul; connecting with someone who matches my energy enkindles that tendency like little else. I seek people who seek meaningful connection that plays out in several different ways, from daily casual chats to shared passions and endeavors. I appreciate the sudden whim of adventure as well.

I adore abstract minds and vibrant souls.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I’m an autodidact who’s been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I’ve been young.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also dabble in photography.

Little and foundational things fill the spaces of my life, some of which include coffee, both simple and bitter and excessively frilly concoctions, burning incense, because I've always thought the smoke is cool, archiving and organizing, collecting (written texts, oddities and cool things), and time pieces.

If my signal created resonating vibes with you, send me a short message about yourself or the things that make your life up. Let’s see where our conversation takes us.",1,1764419250.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

I’ve been having a problem with my espressos for almost 2 weeks now. No matter what I do, almost every shot tastes sour and undrinkable.

I first noticed the problem right after I last cleaned my grinder. After the cleaning, the espresso was great for about a week, but now I only get bad results.

My setup:
	•	La Marzocco Linea Mini R (93.5 °C)
	•	Prebrewing: 3 sec on, 2 sec off
	•	Mahlkönig X54 grinder
	•	17 g basket
	•	16.5 g dose of mid-roast beans
	•	Distribution tool & WDT tool
	•	Precision tamper
	•	Thin 0.5 mm puck screen for the La Marzocco screw

My recipe: 1:2.3 in 28 sec

Before this, I dialed in really well and my shots were perfect. Now, they’re consistently sour with a thin body.

I’ve tried:
	•	Extracting in 25 sec
	•	Extracting in 31 sec
	•	Extracting in almost 40 sec

…but the result is almost always the same: sour and thin.

The shots look okay in a bottomless portafilter – they drip normally at the start, then get a little watery at the end.

I’m wondering what I could be doing wrong. Could it be:
	•	The grinder?
	•	Something I did while cleaning it?
	•	The temperature on my Linea Mini R?
	•	My puck prep? (I haven’t changed anything there in 5 years)

I’d really appreciate your ideas!

Me: 

- Atheist
- Socially aware, left-leaning with a strong personality—NOT A DDS/Marcos apologist
- Can hold and navigate conversations well and tries to learn and use politically correct language. Correct me if I’m wrong, I’m always down to know better.
- Mental health, women’s, children’s, and labor rights advocate
- Introverted but makulit and fun once I’m comfy around you. Hates unnecessary small talks, but welcomes memes and YT shorts/IG reels.
- Has a decent voice (I think)
- Shows I like The Good Place, AHS, Archive 81, Sandman, Superstore, Kim’s Convenience, Modern Family, TBBT, HIMYM, etc. Currently watching Bob’s Burger on repeat as background noise while I’m doing things. 

Other things that might catch your fancy:

⁠- Tea and hot choco > coffee type of tita
- From a constituent campus of one of the big 3, and fairly decorated with academic accolades in the past (if that matters), but nangangapa sa math so please no aptitude test.
- Cheated my way into the Slytherin house but was actually a Ravenclaw. Took the test again recently and now I’m a Gryffindor and confused.
- Exploring outdoor activities and hobbies. I wanna try bouldering and pottery again. Would love to meet someone who can teach me golf, chess, wood work, or driving!
- End-to-end spectrum in the hobbies department (from long walks, reading, getting back into writing, to going out with friends to dine and drink and spontaneous gala!)
- You can check my profile for photos and to get a better feel of who I am if this isn’t long enough for you.

Hey Bangalore fam! 👋

I'm making the classic Delhi → Bangalore migration and yes, I know flat hunting here is legendary for all the wrong reasons. 😅

**About me:**

* IIT graduate currently building my startup
* Clean, responsible tenant who respects shared spaces
* WFH friendly (won't blast music during your meetings!)
* Can discuss everything from tech to filter coffee preferences

**What I'm looking for:**

* A room in a shared flat (sublet/temporary also works!)
* Preferred areas: Koramangala, Indiranagar, Domlur
* Flexible on duration: few days to few months
* Open to other areas too – let's chat!

**What's in it for you:**

* Reliable rent payment (startup life hasn't made me broke... yet 😄)
* Potential roommate who won't eat your labeled food
* Happy to split utility costs fairly
* If you're in tech/startup space, always down for brainstorming sessions over chai
* References available on request

Even if you don't have a room but know someone who does, a quick DM or tag would mean the world. The Bangalore housing gods have been tough, but I'm optimistic!

Drop a comment or DM if you can help or know someone who can. Let's make this transition smoother than my last debugging session! 🚀",1,1764418894.0,FlatmatesinBangalore,0,1.0,False

Who: 2 adults travelling with our 5 year old. 5 year old loves water: pools, slides etc... but has since difficulties with lots of noise/crowds. Grandparents might join, one has mobility challenges. 

Fly out of: Ottawa YOW or Toronto YYZ

Budget: 8K or 13K respectively if it's the 3 or 5 of us. There can be some wiggle room.
We don't want to be nickel and dimed for upgrades etc... once there. If there is something necessary for us to get the most enjoyment it should be included. 

Where: some where warm! DR or Mexico seems best. Travel time less then 5 hours and direct flight at good hours. 

When: escaping winter in last week of Jan through March (like everyone else) 

Duration: 5 nights

Important to us:
1. Safety/health - don't expect to go off resort. We'll need shade.
2. Family fun centered around our daughter. Pools, water park, sand, other activities. Not a party/drunk location. 
3. Easy - don't want to be fighting for spots, waiting in long lines etc. just to ensure we 'enjoy' our time.
4. Kids club - wouldn't use everyday but likely a couple times. 
5. Food - decent taste and options. Like most people good food will improve our stay, awful food will ruin it. Daughter is picky but fine with the normal picky kids food... Pizza, chicken nuggets, grilled cheese. Easy to get ice cream. No one drinks coffee/teas. Not huge alcohol drinkers, but we'll have a couple. 
6. Room - quiet especially after 8pm and some privacy. Would strongly prefer a separate bedroom with door from living space so adults can exist after daughter is down. Two beds in one seperate bedroom would be ideal. Balcony or other to enjoy at this time too.
7. Some enjoyment for adults during kids club to relax or experience!

Our current short list: 
1. Paradisus Grand Cana  Family concierge suite
2. Paradisus  playa del carmen   Family concierge suite
3. Majestics elegance or mirage (seems one bedroom options are only a single king) 
4. Oceans El Faro - rooftop or Master (single king only)

Appreciate any help narrowing it down further or an option/consideration we may have overlooked that would be better suited.

I’m 22M from Spain. I’m introverted in real life, practical and mostly logical, and I tend to be reflective. Most of the time I’m friendly and polite. I sometimes joke or act a bit dumb on purpose cause it's fun. I study computer science and AI. I speak Spanish and English. I also don't have any social media besides YouTube (if you can even consider it that), and reddit. 

I don't have many hobbies, mainly watching YouTube videos or movies, reading stuff sometimes, playing video games sometimes, and studying while listening to chill music and maybe having a cup of coffee or tea.

 I try to reply when I can, but sometimes I get busy with Uni or life stuff.

I’m looking for someone I can talk to regularly, by text or voice. I like deep conversations but I also enjoy small everyday stuff. I prefer people who put effort into conversations, someone who checks in now and then, asks how things are, or brings up random small topics. I’d like someone in a similar situation who wants a steady friend to talk about anything. It would be a plus if our tastes in movies, series or music line up, but it’s not essential.
