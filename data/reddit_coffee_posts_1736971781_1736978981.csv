Unresolved trauma or similar issues? ,"I need some perspective on a situation I went through recently. I was in a relationship with a woman (33) who seemed emotionally distant throughout whole our time together. I made the effort, listening to her when she had bad days, bringing her coffee when she was struggling, even planning special dates like trips, etc. She had a safe place with me where she could be herself. But never reciprocated much and would rarely initiate affection or meaningful conversations. I had to do it all. 

When I confronted her about our lack of emotional connection, she said I was being ‚Äòcontrolling‚Äô because I wanted more clarity and commitment in the relationship. Her excuse was ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get there on my own time‚Äù. In the end I lost interest because I never saw any real effort to get herself there and ended it. 

I want to mention that I‚Äôm far from allowing anyone to use me. She was removed when I knew she couldn‚Äôt step up. I don‚Äôt chase anyone so now she‚Äôs the one contacting me. It just makes no sense as to why women who have this tendency get it all and throw it all away.

Why would someone do this if they know they had it all with a man? It‚Äôs very confusing and I am mostly disappointed in myself. My take is to end it sooner if they don‚Äôt show the same level of reciprocation. Any advice would be appreciated.",1,1736978731.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Fez. The name conjures images of bustling souks, the scent of spices, and the labyrinthine alleys of its iconic medina.  But beyond the captivating chaos of the old city lies a wealth of history and beauty often overlooked by visitors.  This isn't just about ticking off sights; it's about truly experiencing Fez, delving beneath the surface to uncover its hidden secrets.  Let's explore!

**Beyond the Walls:  Exploring Fez el Bali's Lesser-Known Gems**

While the medina is a must-see, venturing slightly beyond its walls reveals a different side of Fez.  Forget the tourist crowds for a moment and discover:

* **The Chouara Tannery:**  Yes, it's touristy, but experiencing the ancient process of leather tanning is a truly sensory adventure.  While the smell can be strong, the vibrant colours and skilled craftsmanship are captivating.  Consider a guided tour to navigate the experience effectively and learn more about this traditional craft. (Pro tip: Mint tea helps with the smell!).
* **The Nejjarine Museum of Wooden Arts and Crafts:** This exquisite museum showcases the artistry of Fez's renowned woodworkers.  From intricately carved ceilings to delicate furniture, the museum offers a stunning glimpse into a rich tradition.
* **Bab Bou Jeloud:** While many pass through this iconic gate, taking the time to truly appreciate its stunning zellij tilework and architecture is rewarding. Step back and admire the craftsmanship, capturing some fantastic photos of this iconic entrance.
* **Hidden Riads:**  Escape the bustling streets and discover the tranquil beauty of hidden riads (traditional Moroccan houses with interior courtyards). Many offer cooking classes, spa treatments, or simply a peaceful retreat away from the medina's intensity.

**Fez Jdid & the Ville Nouvelle: A Contrast of Eras**

Stepping outside Fez el Bali unveils a fascinating contrast in architecture and atmosphere:

* **Fez Jdid (New Fez):** This area, built in the 13th century (though considered ""new"" at the time!), boasts the Mellah, the historic Jewish quarter. Explore its narrow streets, visit the Jewish Museum, and soak in the unique atmosphere.  It‚Äôs a quieter, less crowded alternative to the main medina.
* **Ville Nouvelle (New City):**  A stark contrast to the ancient medina, the Ville Nouvelle, built by the French during the colonial era, is characterised by its wide boulevards, European-style buildings, and a more modern feel. It's a great place for a change of pace, a relaxed coffee break, and to experience a different side of Fez.

**Day Trips from Fez: Expanding Your Horizons**

Fez makes an excellent base for exploring the surrounding region.  Consider these day trips:

* **Volubilis:**  Explore the remarkably well-preserved Roman ruins of Volubilis, a UNESCO World Heritage site.  Imagine stepping back in time to the Roman Empire!
* **Meknes:** Another captivating imperial city, Meknes offers grand gates, impressive mosques, and a fascinating medina, all offering a different perspective on Moroccan history and culture.
* **Ifrane:** Escape to the beautiful Ifrane, often known as the ""Switzerland of Morocco,""  surrounded by stunning natural beauty, perfect for those seeking a peaceful escape from the city.


**Tips for Exploring Beyond the Medina:**

* **Use a reputable guide:** While exploring independently is possible, a guide can provide invaluable insights into the history and culture of Fez.
* **Wear comfortable shoes:** You'll be doing a lot of walking!
* **Learn some basic Arabic phrases:** Even a few words will enhance your interactions with locals.
* **Dress respectfully:**  Modest clothing is appreciated, particularly when visiting religious sites.
* **Be mindful of your belongings:**  Pickpocketing is possible, so be vigilant.


Fez is more than just its famous medina; it's a city of layers, revealing its secrets to those willing to explore. So, venture beyond the familiar, embrace the unexpected, and uncover the true magic of Fez.  Your journey awaits!

I have a crush on my friend. She used to work at the same company as me. I managed to talk to her and get her contact information before I quit, and that took me two years. I was always watching her from afar (surprisingly, she wanted to talk to me as well but was afraid to start a conversation).

Since then, we‚Äôve stayed in touch, but not very frequently‚Äîjust a few messages every two to three months. We‚Äôve hung out twice: the first time, she invited me for coffee, and the second time, I invited her to watch a movie. I didn‚Äôt flirt because she‚Äôs straight, and I wanted to respect her boundaries. I also told her I‚Äôm a lesbian, and she was totally fine with it.

I worked at starbucks for 6 months abt a year ago. I recently got hired at a licensed starbucks store in a plaza and my supervisor is literally KILLING ME! For starters today was only my 3rd day ive told basically everyone that I work with that ive worked at a corporate starbucks before ( a stand alone store with a drive thru and everything). The supervisor that is my trainer is literally so insufferable for starters my online training, she kept breaking it into pieces meaning instead of just letting me get everything done shes dragging out the training so today she tells me to do a certain section for training for support roles and I asked her if there was a reason why she keeps giving me little tiny section by sections instead of just letting me do all my training especially since because I already have experience( I literally was making drinks and serving customers my first day here when she wasnt there and another supervisor was and ok'd it as long as i had another coworker with me incase i had questions) She tells me ""oh its because there are things we have to do in between the trainings"" im like ok sure cool. This lady has me doing a packet answering questions like im in school still, then she isnt even letting me actually practice the things she expects me to do ( for example taking temps, i never did that before or calculating waste. Those were never my responsibilities as a barista at the corporate starbucks i worked at"" she just keeps talking and talking like I didnt even have to go through all of this when I worked at an actual corporate starbucks üòê on my first day of training she showed me where everything was and explained how she expected things to be done ( just want to add everybody else that has told me how to do stuff literally says to me ""oh I know you worked at starbucks before so i know you know how to do x,y&z but if you dont let me know"" BUT HER ? she keeps saying to me  "" I know you worked at starbucks and I know you know how to do this but im gonna tell you anyway"" exactly like that and then she talks for 20 minutes abt one thing THAT I ALREADY KNOW HOW TO DO üò´) I havent warmed one piece of food yet either üò≠ typically when you first start at starbucks and you dont know how to do a lot , one of the first things they do is train you on support roles, warming or register. The ONLY thing she wants me to do is support now mind you we work in a starbucks thats in like a truck stop so we aren't necessarily ever really busy so there isnt much I can support. So today when I came in she said I was on support role even though the other supervisor told me at my last shift that my next shift would be me on bar just so they could see im able to make drinks so I was already annoyed. I said ok fine. She hands me a checklist of things that need to be done and as im going through the check list im realizing 97% of the things on there dont even really make sense because we never get busy and we work in a plaza so cleaning bathrooms/ seating areas arent our stores responsibility thats what the sanitation workers are for so im like ok, ice bins? More than half full thats fine because WE DONT GET BUSY. Lids and cups ? Literally filled to the brim of their organizers and we dont get  busy so no need to over stock. I kid you not while im talking to a coworkers she makes her way over to my check list and says "" oh I notice you marked off the ice bins was that on accident?"" And I say ""no I marked it off because the ice bins are more than halfway full and we don't necessarily get busy so thats should be enough ice"" she goes ""yeah but I want a full ice bin so if you could just do that, that would be perfect"" I say ok and go get more ice. 2 seconds later she goes ""oh can you put out some more lids and cups"" I wish I had a picture to show yall, everything was literally stocked to the brim like if I put more stuff it would fall and I told her that and she goes ""yeah but I just want to be ready for peak"" remember there is no peak there is never a rush ü§£ü§£ but I said ok and put more lids and cups and guess what kept happening throughout the day... people kept knocking over cups and lids because everything was over stocked. Then she decided to quiz me on the packet that I filled out earlier also keep in mind while shes doing this im literally making drinks for customers and here is one standout moment from that interactionüòÇ she goes "" how many pumps go into a whatever"" and I said "" 5 pumps"" SHE LITERALLY GOES ""yup youre right you wrote 4 but yup the answers 5"". üòê lady there is no way you take your job this serious and then in front of customers? like have some damn common sense to hold off until I atleast finish making their latte. Then she goes into ""im going to quiz you on drinks and I want you to make them"" I said ok no problem she has me make a cafe mocha, a latte , an americano , cappuccino and a flat white. When I went to make my first drink she told me to make she goes ""can you explain to me what youre doing while youre doing it"" sorry not sorry but that was my last straw no I didnt say it with attitude but I said "" can we just do it where I make the drink then at the end you tell me what I did wrong because theres no point in me making the drink while youre telling me what im doing wrong if that makes sense"" she goes ""oh but you said you completed all your training on the computer so you should know how to make them right"" in my head im like yeah I do but it just doesnt make sense because whats the point of wasting milk and product if i make a mistake and youre just going to correct me right then and there ? Like wtf. But I did it. I made the drinks and described everything I was doing. I kid you not this lady says to me ""youre doing good its just your putting your syrup in before your espresso shots"" mind they have an older espresso machine so im like ""yeah im doing it that way because by the time the machine rinses and actually starts dispensing the espresso I could already have my syrup in the cup and have my milk started steaming and or be working on another drink"" literally the same way we all did it at corporate starbucks with no problem. Shes like ""well yeah but you need to do syrup first then espresso"" and im thinking to myself like lady it literally doesnt matter because they both come before the milk and lets be honest youre supposed to be mixing your espresso shots with the syrup before milk anyway ( something ironically she didnt want to mention and talk my head off about for 20 minutes üòÇ) so it doesnt matter which one I do first but I left it alone. Also when i was done steaming my milk she literally leans over me and tells me to leave the steam wand pointing out ( something i was told not to do at my corporate starbucks job) so my plaza manager was standing there and goes "" no youre supposed to push it in when youre done"". She goes into this whole performance of ""oh when i was trained blah blah blah"" then looks at me and goes "" well yes put the steam wand in dont leave it out"" DUHH LADY its like common sense and not only that why not just say "" oh my bad you were right"" why make it this whole thing instead of just acknowledging that i know how to do my job. I wouldnt have applied if i didnt feel like i could do starbucks again üò≠Now my favorite memories of today was the flat white and the cappuccino. When  I made my cappuccino she asked me how long do I aerate the milk for and I told her I dont know the exact amount of seconds especially because this machines a little older but I know when the milk looks right and she was like no actually blah blah blah so when I made that cappuccino I put my all into it and it came out perfect then onto the flat white when I made my flat white I had the perfect milk dot tell me why this lady goes "" yeah your flat white is decent but let me show you how I was trained to do it"" when I tell yall this lady steamed her milk so horribly there wasnt even a white dot it literally looked like soap bubbles but coffee colored on the top of the drink so to be petty I said "" yeah but you see how yours is really foamy mine has that perfect white dot without all that foam"" she goes "" yeah I suppose yours is really decent"" and im like lady why cant you just admit you dont know everything and its ok ü§£ü§£ you tried to one up me and played yourself so to keep it going I picked up my cappuccino and my latte and I said to her and another coworker ""oh yeah another thing  another way to tell if your cappuccino is a good one is if its lighter than a latte"" I picked up her ""flat white"" and said "" see how your flat white is about the same weight of a cappuccino it should still be the same weight of a latte"" THEN TO BE EXTEA EXTRA PETTY I said ""oh yeah and the thing with cappuccinos is you can aerate for however long you want but if you dont put the cup at the right angle on the steam wand youre never gonna get the right cappuccino consistency"" because girl im true to this not new to this ü§£ and my last story of today dont forget this was all from today üòí when she was leaving she said her little goodbye speech and then said ""oh (my name) is to only be on hot bar and coffee rotation"" mind you I was making a cold brew at the time and I didnt know that their cold brew wasnt diluted. She continues with her statement and goes ""she is not to be on cold bar because that right there is wrong"" TALKING ABOUT THE COLD BREW I WAS MAKING üò≠üò≠üò≠ how was I supposed to know the cold brew needed to be diluted isnt that something that you shouldve told me instead of having me make 30842 lattes after I showed you multiple times I can make them like lady get a life ü§£ü§£ she asked me earlier in the day if i knew how to steam milk so i asked her if she knew i worked at starbucks before and she was like "" yeah you told me before and the other managers told me but i want to make sure they trained you the right way"" WHAT RIGHT WAY? Youve only ever worked at two licensed starbucks ü§£ i dont think im better than someone because i worked at an actual starbucks but come on its like a common stereotype that licensed starbucks drinks are never the same quality as actual starbucks so what do you even mean girl üò≠welp thats been my rant ive only been there for a couple days and I swear I could make like 6 of these rants because she literally just doesnt quit.

I worked at starbucks for 6 months abt a year ago. I recently got hired at a licensed starbucks store in a plaza and my supervisor is literally KILLING ME! For starters today was only my 3rd day ive told basically everyone that I work with that ive worked at a corporate starbucks before ( a stand alone store with a drive thru and everything). The supervisor that is my trainer is literally so insufferable for starters my online training, she kept breaking it into pieces meaning instead of just letting me get everything done shes dragging out the training so today she tells me to do a certain section for training for support roles and I asked her if there was a reason why she keeps giving me little tiny section by sections instead of just letting me do all my training especially since because I already have experience( I literally was making drinks and serving customers my first day here when she wasnt there and another supervisor was and ok'd it as long as i had another coworker with me incase i had questions) She tells me ""oh its because there are things we have to do in between the trainings"" im like ok sure cool. This lady has me doing a packet answering questions like im in school still, then she isnt even letting me actually practice the things she expects me to do ( for example taking temps, i never did that before or calculating waste. Those were never my responsibilities as a barista at the corporate starbucks i worked at"" she just keeps talking and talking like I didnt even have to go through all of this when I worked at an actual corporate starbucks üòê on my first day of training she showed me where everything was and explained how she expected things to be done ( just want to add everybody else that has told me how to do stuff literally says to me ""oh I know you worked at starbucks before so i know you know how to do x,y&z but if you dont let me know"" BUT HER ? she keeps saying to me  "" I know you worked at starbucks and I know you know how to do this but im gonna tell you anyway"" exactly like that and then she talks for 20 minutes abt one thing THAT I ALREADY KNOW HOW TO DO üò´) I havent warmed one piece of food yet either üò≠ typically when you first start at starbucks and you dont know how to do a lot , one of the first things they do is train you on support roles, warming or register. The ONLY thing she wants me to do is support now mind you we work in a starbucks thats in like a truck stop so we aren't necessarily ever really busy so there isnt much I can support. So today when I came in she said I was on support role even though the other supervisor told me at my last shift that my next shift would be me on bar just so they could see im able to make drinks so I was already annoyed. I said ok fine. She hands me a checklist of things that need to be done and as im going through the check list im realizing 97% of the things on there dont even really make sense because we never get busy and we work in a plaza so cleaning bathrooms/ seating areas arent our stores responsibility thats what the sanitation workers are for so im like ok, ice bins? More than half full thats fine because WE DONT GET BUSY. Lids and cups ? Literally filled to the brim of their organizers and we dont get  busy so no need to over stock.

1i28zrz,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Moe-Nawaz/comments/1i28zrz/the_10x_mindset/,The 10X Mindset ,"**For leaders Ready to Break Through Growth Barriers**

Are you a business leader frustrated by stagnant growth despite relentless effort? Do you find yourself endlessly firefighting, unable to focus on the big picture while your vision remains unfulfilled? If so, you‚Äôre not alone. Many leaders of successful businesses find themselves stuck, unable to scale beyond their current plateau. But here‚Äôs the good news: growth is not a matter of working harder‚Äîit‚Äôs about thinking smarter and leading differently. This is where *The 10X Mentor* comes in.

# The Reality of Business Leadership: Why Growth Stalls

For many 8-figure business owners, the early days of growth came naturally. New clients, new markets, and operational success followed one another. But as businesses expand, growth becomes exponentially harder. Complexity increases, systems strain, and what worked before starts to falter. Leaders often face:

* **Operational Chaos**: Processes that once supported a small team crumble under the weight of expansion.
* **Time Constraints**: Leaders are pulled in too many directions, leaving little room for strategic thinking.
* **Talent Gaps**: Finding, aligning, and retaining the right people becomes a constant challenge.
* **Market Saturation**: Traditional growth strategies deliver diminishing returns in crowded spaces.

These barriers are not just frustrating‚Äîthey‚Äôre exhausting. They create a sense of inertia, where despite the desire to scale, progress feels elusive.

# The 10X Mindset: Shifting from Incremental to Exponential Growth

Enter the 10X Mindset‚Äîa transformative way of thinking that redefines how leaders approach growth. Unlike incremental improvements, where progress is measured in small, predictable steps, the 10X Mindset focuses on exponential leaps. It challenges leaders to envision bold possibilities, reimagine their strategies, and align their teams toward transformative results.

At its core, the 10X Mindset involves asking powerful, disruptive questions:

* Instead of, ‚ÄúHow can we grow by 10%?‚Äù ask, ‚ÄúWhat would it take to grow 10 times larger?‚Äù
* Instead of, ‚ÄúHow can I manage my time better?‚Äù ask, ‚ÄúHow can I delegate and systemize so I focus only on what matters?‚Äù
* Instead of, ‚ÄúHow can we do more?‚Äù ask, ‚ÄúHow can we do less‚Äîbut better?‚Äù

# The Five Strategic Pillars: A Blueprint for Exponential Growth

The journey to 10X growth is not just about bold thinking‚Äîit requires a structured framework. That‚Äôs where the **Five Strategic Pillars** come into play. These pillars are the foundation of *The 10X Mentor*, providing a step-by-step roadmap to overcome stagnation and build a scalable, sustainable, and sellable business.

# 1. Systemization: Build Your Operational Backbone

Growth without systems is chaos. Systemization involves creating processes, workflows, and tools that ensure consistency, efficiency, and scalability. Leaders who embrace systemization free themselves from day-to-day operations, allowing them to focus on strategy and vision.

# 2. Staffability: Aligning Talent with Vision

Your business can only grow as far as your people allow. Staffability emphasizes hiring, aligning, and empowering the right talent. It‚Äôs about creating a high-performing team that shares your vision and executes with excellence.

# 3. Scalability: Growth Without Overwhelm

Scaling successfully requires more than just ambition. Scalability ensures that your growth doesn‚Äôt come at the expense of quality, customer satisfaction, or employee well-being. It involves building systems and strategies that allow your business to expand predictably and sustainably.

# 4. Sustainability: Building Long-Term Resilience

Short-term gains mean little without long-term viability. Sustainability focuses on financial health, operational efficiency, and cultural resilience, ensuring your business thrives in any market condition.

# 5. Sellability: Maximizing Business Value

Even if you‚Äôre not planning to sell, building a sellable business ensures it‚Äôs efficient, profitable, and independent of you. Sellability involves clean financials, strong systems, and a brand that attracts customers, investors, or successors.

# The Power of Mentorship: Your Catalyst for Growth

Behind every successful leader is a trusted mentor. Mentorship is not just about guidance‚Äîit‚Äôs about accountability, perspective, and unlocking opportunities you didn‚Äôt know existed. A mentor challenges your assumptions, holds you accountable to your goals, and helps you navigate the complexities of exponential growth.

Consider this: CEOs in elite mastermind groups and mentorship programs consistently outperform their peers. Why? Because they leverage the collective wisdom of others, avoid common pitfalls, and stay focused on their most impactful priorities.

# Real-World Success Stories: The 10X Mindset in Action

The strategies in *The 10X Mentor* are not theoretical‚Äîthey‚Äôve been tested and proven by leaders like you.

# Case Study 1: From Stagnation to Global Success

David, the CEO of Hearth & Harvest Coffee, transformed his $3 million local coffee business into a $30 million global brand. By adopting the 10X Mindset, he launched a subscription model, built a direct-to-consumer e-commerce platform, and partnered with international distributors. These bold moves allowed his company to scale globally while maintaining its artisanal values.

# Case Study 2: Transforming Chaos into Order

Michael, the CEO of Precision Dynamics, faced rising costs and inefficiencies in his manufacturing business. With mentorship and the Five Strategic Pillars, he implemented automation, streamlined operations, and diversified into high-margin product lines. Within three years, his profits tripled, and his company became an industry leader.

# What Makes The 10X Mentor Different?

This is not just another business book filled with motivational quotes and generic advice. *The 10X Mentor* is a practical, actionable guide rooted in real-world success. It‚Äôs designed for leaders who are serious about growth, ready to embrace change, and committed to achieving extraordinary results.

In this book, you‚Äôll find:

* **Proven Frameworks**: Step-by-step strategies for applying the Five Strategic Pillars to your business.
* **Expert Insights**: Lessons from a mentor with decades of experience helping leaders scale to eight, nine, and ten figures.
* **Inspiring Stories**: Real-world case studies that show how the 10X Mindset delivers transformational results.
* **Actionable Tools**: Practical exercises, templates, and tips you can implement immediately.

# Are You Ready to Break Through?

If you‚Äôre fed up with spinning your wheels and ready to unlock your business‚Äôs full potential, *The 10X Mentor* is your roadmap to exponential success. It‚Äôs time to stop settling for incremental gains and start thinking 10X.

Your journey to transformation starts now. Are you ready to lead boldly, embrace change, and achieve the extraordinary?

We were fortunate to be able to brew coffee at our sister store and haul it over to my store. 

So we offered cold brew (cut with boiled water), drip coffee, and our pastries we baked this morning. 

Oh at least 5 different occasions, we had people say ""what's drip coffee?"" 

We had people gesture at the espresso bar like it's right there just make me coffee 

We had people who were on board, but then when we said our sealed dairy products were okay to use, just lost it and said it made no sense. 

What the hell, y'all? I had to start dumbing it down to ""we have the coffee your parents make"" ""like a Mr. coffee"" ""like the stuff you see at a mechanic or in a church narthex""

The fires in and around LA have left behind a hellscape of unimaginable proportions.

I‚Äôve spent the last three days with old friends in Santa Monica, where smoke and ash was carried in mostly from the Altadena fire and not the Palisades, despite its close proximity. The winds are picking back up today so the terror is still not over for many.  But the bulldozers are starting to clear some debris to make roads at least passable. And those who work are back at work as best they can.  Life goes on. If you need to work, you work.

 It seems like everyone who has been here any length of time and is connected to the world knows someone who has taken a hit - a recording studio in the Palisades, a home in Topanga Canyon, an investment property near Pasadena. We do what we can.  For those directly and indirectly affected, there seems to be a whole lot of self-medicating going on (thank goodness most of it is now legal). Living here comes with known risks, just like anywhere, but shit got very real for a lot of people. It's not the kind if shit that is helped much by skipping rope, plunging into an ice bath, or drinking magic green powder potions. You need something a little more potent.

Like good people do anywhere, homes are being opened to fire refugees while the literal and figurative dust settles, businesses are offering help to rivals who lost everything, most school children are back at their desks. Go-bags are being taken out of car trunks and brought back inside, even if not back in storage. The threat of evacuation has been a useful exercise in assessing what is truly important!  That new guitar? Nah. That guitar your dad bought you in school and you used in your first professional gig? Absolutely. 

Here, we snark. To be absolutely clear - Amanda Kloots was **never** in danger from any fire, and did **not** evacuate her home. Neither of the  Laurel Canyon houses she owns was under an evacuation order. People in that area were told to prepare for evacuation should it become necessary. Thank goodness it did not became necessary.  She was wise, for once, to take herself and her son out of her $2m house and into her Porsche SUV, to a safer location for the night. Again, to be clear, it was **not** to Malibu, despite her re-posting someone else‚Äôs footage of driving *south* along the PCH through Malibu. 

What did she do while others were losing everything?  She created a tall tale of fleeing the advancing fire; she went to great lengths to film herself donating a few trash bags of used and gifted clothes at a high-end shop in a high-end part of the city. Let the corporate sponsors like Skechers do the heavy lifting, right?  How pathetic that Amanda, being Amanda, chose this way to try to stay relevant in the larger Hollywood community, amidst this disaster that **IN NO WAY** was ever about her.

Would she have taken her bags of clothing donations to less affluent parts of LA had the fires affected, say, Watts or El Monte? Hell to the no. This was about keeping the industry‚Äôs focus on herself during a disaster. Group hug and smile for the cameras.


Before the fires are even contained, she is back to shilling her magic health powder and reverting to the grieving widow personae.   Free promotional kits of her miracle powders got sent to her family and friends (including to her billionaire benefactor, Saskia Evans) and now Amanda is getting busy on social media re-posting their thank you videos. She sure has learned the art of the circle jerk. Note that none of these videos so far are by her former co-hosts on the canceled TV show she used to be on. I wonder why not?   Hopefully she will be shamed into donating a large chunk of the gross sales of her magic powders. This time show us the receipts, Amanda!

DON‚ÄôT WASTE YOUR HARD-EARNED MONEY ‚Äì ¬†
I recently stayed at the Melia Punta Cana Beach A Wellness Inclusive Resort- Adults Only property in the Dominican Republic, and I must strongly advise you to steer clear of this location.¬†

The conditions of the rooms are appalling and reflect a severe lack of maintenance from both exterminator and cleaning services. In January 2025, I checked into room #303, where the AC malfunctioned and dirt spewed from the vents, causing breathing difficulties. After reaching out to management for a room change, we were made to wait for eight hours before being moved to room #318. This room appeared somewhat cleaner, and while the AC functioned properly, we were soon greeted by cockroaches emerging from the bathroom molding.

Once again, we packed our belongings and went to the front desk to express our frustration. We were then relocated to room #517, which was infested with insects in the coffee tray and refrigerator‚Äîit was absolutely revolting! With only two days remaining in our trip and already drained from moving twice, we tried our best to clean the rooms with Clorox wipes. However, the toilet wouldn‚Äôt flush, and the sink was clogged. Our calls to the front desk went unanswered, and management dismissed our concerns completely.

Having visited numerous properties without any issues, I can confidently state that the experience we encountered here was utterly unacceptable.

I worked at starbucks for 6 months abt a year ago. I recently got hired at a licensed starbucks store in a plaza and my supervisor is literally KILLING ME! For starters today was only my 3rd day ive told basically everyone that I work with that ive worked at a corporate starbucks before ( a stand alone store with a drive thru and everything). The supervisor that is my trainer is literally so insufferable for starters my online training, she kept breaking it into pieces meaning instead of just letting me get everything done shes dragging out the training so today she tells me to do a certain section for training for support roles and I asked her if there was a reason why she keeps giving me little tiny section by sections instead of just letting me do all my training especially since because I already have experience( I literally was making drinks and serving customers my first day here when she wasnt there and another supervisor was and ok'd it as long as i had another coworker with me incase i had questions) She tells me ""oh its because there are things we have to do in between the trainings"" im like ok sure cool. This lady has me doing a packet answering questions like im in school still, then she isnt even letting me actually practice the things she expects me to do ( for example taking temps, i never did that before or calculating waste. Those were never my responsibilities as a barista at the corporate starbucks i worked at"" she just keeps talking and talking like I didnt even have to go through all of this when I worked at an actual corporate starbucks üòê on my first day of training she showed me where everything was and explained how she expected things to be done ( just want to add everybody else that has told me how to do stuff literally says to me ""oh I know you worked at starbucks before so i know you know how to do x,y&z but if you dont let me know"" BUT HER ? she keeps saying to me  "" I know you worked at starbucks and I know you know how to do this but im gonna tell you anyway"" exactly like that and then she talks for 20 minutes abt one thing THAT I ALREADY KNOW HOW TO DO üò´) I havent warmed one piece of food yet either üò≠ typically when you first start at starbucks and you dont know how to do a lot , one of the first things they do is train you on support roles, warming or register. The ONLY thing she wants me to do is support now mind you we work in a starbucks thats in like a truck stop so we aren't necessarily ever really busy so there isnt much I can support. So today when I came in she said I was on support role even though the other supervisor told me at my last shift that my next shift would be me on bar just so they could see im able to make drinks so I was already annoyed. I said ok fine. She hands me a checklist of things that need to be done and as im going through the check list im realizing 97% of the things on there dont even really make sense because we never get busy and we work in a plaza so cleaning bathrooms/ seating areas arent our stores responsibility thats what the sanitation workers are for so im like ok, ice bins? More than half full thats fine because WE DONT GET BUSY. Lids and cups ? Literally filled to the brim of their organizers and we dont get  busy so no need to over stock. I kid you not while im talking to a coworkers she makes her way over to my check list and says "" oh I notice you marked off the ice bins was that on accident?"" And I say ""no I marked it off because the ice bins are more than halfway full and we don't necessarily get busy so thats should be enough ice"" she goes ""yeah but I want a full ice bin so if you could just do that, that would be perfect"" I say ok and go get more ice. 2 seconds later she goes ""oh can you put out some more lids and cups"" I wish I had a picture to show yall, everything was literally stocked to the brim like if I put more stuff it would fall and I told her that and she goes ""yeah but I just want to be ready for peak"" remember there is no peak there is never a rush ü§£ü§£ but I said ok and put more lids and cups and guess what kept happening throughout the day... people kept knocking over cups and lids because everything was over stocked. Then she decided to quiz me on the packet that I filled out earlier also keep in mind while shes doing this im literally making drinks for customers and here is one standout moment from that interactionüòÇ she goes "" how many pumps go into a whatever"" and I said "" 5 pumps"" SHE LITERALLY GOES ""yup youre right you wrote 4 but yup the answers 5"". üòê lady there is no way you take your job this serious and then in front of customers? like have some damn common sense to hold off until I atleast finish making their latte. Then she goes into ""im going to quiz you on drinks and I want you to make them"" I said ok no problem she has me make a cafe mocha, a latte , an americano , cappuccino and a flat white. When I went to make my first drink she told me to make she goes ""can you explain to me what youre doing while youre doing it"" sorry not sorry but that was my last straw no I didnt say it with attitude but I said "" can we just do it where I make the drink then at the end you tell me what I did wrong because theres no point in me making the drink while youre telling me what im doing wrong if that makes sense"" she goes ""oh but you said you completed all your training on the computer so you should know how to make them right"" in my head im like yeah I do but it just doesnt make sense because whats the point of wasting milk and product if i make a mistake and youre just going to correct me right then and there ? Like wtf. But I did it. I made the drinks and described everything I was doing. I kid you not this lady says to me ""youre doing good its just your putting your syrup in before your espresso shots"" mind they have an older espresso machine so im like ""yeah im doing it that way because by the time the machine rinses and actually starts dispensing the espresso I could already have my syrup in the cup and have my milk started steaming and or be working on another drink"" literally the same way we all did it at corporate starbucks with no problem. Shes like ""well yeah but you need to do syrup first then espresso"" and im thinking to myself like lady it literally doesnt matter because they both come before the milk and lets be honest youre supposed to be mixing your espresso shots with the syrup before milk anyway ( something ironically she didnt want to mention and talk my head off about for 20 minutes üòÇ) so it doesnt matter which one I do first but I left it alone. Also when i was done steaming my milk she literally leans over me and tells me to leave the steam wand pointing out ( something i was told not to do at my corporate starbucks job) so my plaza manager was standing there and goes "" no youre supposed to push it in when youre done"". She goes into this whole performance of ""oh when i was trained blah blah blah"" then looks at me and goes "" well yes put the steam wand in dont leave it out"" DUHH LADY its like common sense and not only that why not just say "" oh my bad you were right"" why make it this whole thing instead of just acknowledging that i know how to do my job. I wouldnt have applied if i didnt feel like i could do starbucks again üò≠Now my favorite memories of today was the flat white and the cappuccino. When  I made my cappuccino she asked me how long do I aerate the milk for and I told her I dont know the exact amount of seconds especially because this machines a little older but I know when the milk looks right and she was like no actually blah blah blah so when I made that cappuccino I put my all into it and it came out perfect then onto the flat white when I made my flat white I had the perfect milk dot tell me why this lady goes "" yeah your flat white is decent but let me show you how I was trained to do it"" when I tell yall this lady steamed her milk so horribly there wasnt even a white dot it literally looked like soap bubbles but coffee colored on the top of the drink so to be petty I said "" yeah but you see how yours is really foamy mine has that perfect white dot without all that foam"" she goes "" yeah I suppose yours is really decent"" and im like lady why cant you just admit you dont know everything and its ok ü§£ü§£ you tried to one up me and played yourself so to keep it going I picked up my cappuccino and my latte and I said to her and another coworker ""oh yeah another thing  another way to tell if your cappuccino is a good one is if its lighter than a latte"" I picked up her ""flat white"" and said "" see how your flat white is about the same weight of a cappuccino it should still be the same weight of a latte"" THEN TO BE EXTEA EXTRA PETTY I said ""oh yeah and the thing with cappuccinos is you can aerate for however long you want but if you dont put the cup at the right angle on the steam wand youre never gonna get the right cappuccino consistency"" because girl im true to this not new to this ü§£ and my last story of today dont forget this was all from today üòí when she was leaving she said her little goodbye speech and then said ""oh (my name) is to only be on hot bar and coffee rotation"" mind you I was making a cold brew at the time and I didnt know that their cold brew wasnt diluted. She continues with her statement and goes ""she is not to be on cold bar because that right there is wrong"" TALKING ABOUT THE COLD BREW I WAS MAKING üò≠üò≠üò≠ how was I supposed to know the cold brew needed to be diluted isnt that something that you shouldve told me instead of having me make 30842 lattes after I showed you multiple times I can make them like lady get a life ü§£ü§£ she asked me earlier in the day if i knew how to steam milk so i asked her if she knew i worked at starbucks before and she was like "" yeah you told me before and the other managers told me but i want to make sure they trained you the right way"" WHAT RIGHT WAY?

Apple juice, milk, coffee, Mountain Dew‚Äîsomehow nothing within this grand variety of beverages piqued any interest when compared to the fascinating bliss of water or cola mixed with the frozen vegetables. This is surely a metaphor for life as we know it, while variety can be the spice of life, too much variety can dull the senses. Additionally, sometimes it's best to stick to what we know is interesting (water or cola mixed with frozen peas) instead of branching out to things like dairy products or more advanced soft drink formulations. One also can't help but empathize with the frozen peas‚Äîjust as we are born into this world without ever having asked to exist, the frozen peas are thrust into a variety of beverages without having been consulted. Then just as the passage of time wears on us physically and mentally, each new beverage slowly contributes to the inevitable melting of the peas, until we are nothing more than a soggy pile of spent legumes floating in the tepid dregs of Mountain Dew that is our reality.",1,1736977419.0,DecreasinglyVerbose,0,1.0,False

was dating this girl for a few months, one of those super intense extremely up and down highest of highs lowest of lows relationships, she was actively suicidal 

One night she (22f) is acting out of character, pushing me away insisting on not seeing me for no good reason, at this point I didn't know she was suicidal but on instinct I go to her place to check up on her, we talk the whole night, she tells me she was planning on killing herself that night

Weeks later, same situation, insists on not seeing me, I go to see her anyway, same result, this time she explicitly told me I may have saved her life, I say all this to show you that she tied her mental health to me 

Now a third time over a month later the same behavior but more worrying, this time she had been losing weight, missing uni classes, and she is absolutely adamant on not seeing me,

I get the car and floor it to her place, I knock on the door a Few times and she eventually comes out, stonewalls me as she walks to her car, I tell her I want to talk I'm really worried, she sits in her car, I sit next to her, try to ask about her mental health and that I'm worried she's gonna kill herself and it's hurting me (shouldn't have done that shouldn't have made it at all about me I'm aware), she's silent and on her phone. 

Then a car pulls up beside us, her male friend/ex boyfriend is in it basically saying ""is this guy bothering you"" then tells me to fuck off and she doesn't want to see me, he gets very aggressive first with the ol ""move or I'll make you"" I ask if he wants to fight me knowing he doesn't, he then  threatens to run me over. bare in mind I'm in no mental state for confrontation right now I was borderline crying breaking down from concern a few seconds ago. My head is spinning because this completely blindsided me, I'm trying to make head or tail of this while I have a stranger yelling at me with my girlfriend now at his side.

I decide on reason rather than violence, I talk with him tell him I'm really worried about her, im still barely mentally holding it together at this point. I tell him he needs to check up on her if she's gonna push me away and he wants to get involved like this, now knowing I'm not gonna fight him imboldens him and he basically says go fuck yourself leave, gives me a lecture on consent and respecting boundaries, insults me a bunch, now I see him with the woman I love as a united front against me, this wasn't pleasant I was at a complete loss for words it was awful 

He eventually leaves because he knows I train and he couldn't actually beat me, I leave right after, would've left sooner but at this point my ego didn't want me to let him step me out. I did regrettably say some spiteful parting words to her something along the lines of ""I have mental health problems too"" ( I do) ""it didn't make me a bad person""

After this I am blocked on most things, she becomes very emotionless and hostile, she was nothing but warm and caring the day before, even knowing my grandmother died the day of this incident (got the call while I was in the car with her) she showed zero emotion or empathy just stone cold and all following communication was text something along the lines of ""do not contact me"" refuses to meet up for a friendly coffee to end things on a pleasant note, refuses to engage at all. Even refuses to have her possessions dropped in her mailbox with no contact. Now Months later the way things ended still greatly bothers me. 

Now I am naturally bias towards myself that is the human condition, in my eyes I didn't conduct myself perfectly but it wasn't the worst thing in the world to show up like that under the circumstance, but perhaps I'm just blind to my own wrongdoing and it genuinely was that much of a violation of personal space that it warranted the reaction 

I think that we had a nuanced situation with a lot of context, including trauma I have regarding others suicide that she is well aware of. she invites an outside party while I'm extremely vulnerable, to give me a lecture on textbook ethics and respecting boundaries, in the most aggressive Way possible, I can't bring up the context with this outside party because they're unwaveringly hostile and on her side his job is simply to make me leave. there's no point trying to make him understand my plight so I'm at a complete loss no matter which way I turn. 

Please correct me if I'm wrong, I would like to be wrong, I would rather know that I just had a momentary lapse in judgement that I'll never have again, than know that I consistently had a lapse in judgement over the course of months on thinking she was an amazing person.",1,1736977011.0,AITAH,5,1.0,False

The on screen keyboard and mouse are horrible.  Idk why they shortcut does the keyboard then the mouse separate,  or at least some combo to have a full screen setup with keyboard, mouse, and whatever else.    The haptic touch feedback is horrible.

13in laptop is just dumb for a 2 screen device.   They should have made it 15/16in then they could combine the keyboard with a touchpad in a single piece of hardware.

There's no way to store the mouse while moving.  Imagine you're at a coffee shop and sitting at a table but need to go to another table.  You need to fumble around holding the laptop, keyboard, stand, and MOUSE.   The keyboard mag locks to the top of the laptop, and also folds into the stand and locks but the mouse doesn't do anything and the stand doesn't mag lock to the laptop.    WHY couldn't they just make the cover mag to the laptop lid and same with the mouse.... then we could just toss it all there and hold it with one hand and walk to another table, carrying a coffee or backpack or food or whatever.   

You cant keep 1920x1200 resolution, every restart it reverts back.  I think even from sleep it does this.  Also when on 1920x1200 the on screen keyboard doesn't work.    My VDI doesn't copy the scaling so it'll copy the resolution and everything's so small.  Higher resolution doesn't really matter.

We met by chance at the elevator and started talking. I found out that he lives across the hall.

The next day, when my boyfriend went to work, I was bored sitting at home alone, so I decided to go to my neighbor's house in a long satin robe without underwear, under the pretext of asking if he needed help.

When he opened the door, he was shocked to see me, but invited me to come in and have a cup of coffee with him.

How could I refuse if I had come here for something more? While the coffee was brewing, I caught his eye several times on my protruding nipples.

Getting as close as I could, I undid my belt on my robe so that he could see a little more of my naked body and whispered in his ear that I wanted to have some fun with him¬†

He abruptly picked me up and put me on the kitchen table, spread my legs and started eating my pussy.His tongue was so playful that after a while I splashed it right on his face.

Before I could say anything, his cock was already inside my womb. He fucked me for about 30 minutes, after which I felt his cock start to throb inside me and said I wanted him to fill my pussy to the brim.I felt his hot shot of sperm, deep in my uterus.

He came out of me slowly, as if he didn't want to leave this place. So now that we're neighbors, it seems he won't have to say goodbye to my pussy for long))

As soon as I got off the table and got to my feet, I felt his cum slowly leaking out of me.

About 6 months ago, and with the advice of my therapist, I decided to put myself on a new, structured sleeping arrangement after having to take some health leave for exhaustion.

I take a shower at 9pm, crawl into bed, read a chapter or two of whatever book I'm reading to wind down, and I'm asleep by 10pm.  No devices during the wind down.

I started sleeping through the night and I now wake up energized instead struggling to get out of bed.  Instead of frantically driving to work in traffic, I walk the 25-minute commute and do some mindfulness exercises along the way.  I don't need coffee or energy drinks to get through the day, getting a big rush of energy, feeling jittery for 45 minutes, then crashing and needing another coffee to continue.  

I've even lost some weight and toned up because instead of being too tired to cook and relying on quick, processed foods, I pop into the supermarket and grab fresh meat and vegetables on my walk home from work. 

The problem is my fianc√© still sticks to our old schedule of going to sleep whenever.  Obviously, I can't stick to my schedule 100%.  For example, the other day was our friend's birthday party.  We went to dinner with her and friends to celebrate, but I told my fianc√© that he can stay out as late as he wants, but I intended to say my goodbyes at around 9pm, so I didn't disrupt my sleep schedule too much.  He's beginning to find episodes like this annoying and this particular time it turned into a small fight that I'm being too anal about my new lifestyle and I need to be more flexible.  I feel I *am* flexible when it allows and matters and that dinner and a drink or two from 7-9pm is a perfectly acceptable way to celebrate a birthday with a friend.

It's not just my fianc√©, too.  Even my friends are commenting that I'm not as fun as I used to be and have started jokingly referring to me as ""Granny.""  And I've noticed I'm not really invited to much anymore (I see their outings on social media), which means my fianc√© misses out, too, since they can't really invite him and not me.  I feel like I'm doing this good thing for myself and everyone seems to have real problems with it.

I'm mentally happier and physically healthier than I've ever been due to the changes I've made.  I'm not in college anymore, I can't party until 4am, skip class, and sleep until noon.  I don't want to stay out until midnight on a Monday night and struggle throughout the day at work the next day.

I occasionally see posts talking about running the wheel on a stock and using high deltas...basically ATM.

I was intrigued, and being the curious sort, eventually, I got the urge!

This past weekend, I deposited $15,000 in a dedicated account at my brokerage to run the ""Fast Unicycle Wheel"".

What the heck is that?

Well, it's designed to spin fast (at least that would be my guess...we'll see!) and I'm only doing it for one stock: NVDA.

Here's what I'm doing.

* Sell weekly ATM puts until assigned
* Sell weekly ATM calls until assigned
* Objective is to not roll to avoid assignment
* Rinse and repeat

I opened my first cash secured put on Monday and have been providing results daily; after this week I'll likely just post a weekly update.

The weekly update will be pinned to the top of the sub. (There's another strategy I'm running which is also pinned.)

This is for fun and to see what happens! And I certainly won't be extrapolating this to any other situation or use it to either promote or warn against using the strategy...it's just a one off to see how it behaves!

ok so I started seeing this guy like 6 months ago and at first he didn‚Äôt wanna be in a relationship at all, but a few months ago he finally agreed and things have been going pretty great.


but here‚Äôs the problem:

he works at a coffee shop and became friends with this girl (25F) who goes there a lot over the summer. She‚Äôs also friends w the rest of the employees there, so it isn‚Äôt like they‚Äôre just special friends on the side. The thing is, im scared he would leave me for her if he had the chance. Im not sure if im being paranoid but here are some of the reasons i think that

1) the first time they hung out they spent a whole day together and he was ignoring me all day but when i finally met up with them (she made him call me back) he had his arm around her (she went home pretty quickly)

2) they text A LOT and even though nothing is outright flirtatious, they definitely talk like friends most of the time, but sometimes he‚Äôll do stuff like tell her how hot she looked in something or text her saying he misses her or that he wishes she were there (even when he‚Äôs been with me)

She‚Äôs pretty good at kinda changing the convo to a friend thing (using self deprecating humor when he compliments her or saying ‚Äúugh I miss you all too‚Äù when he says he misses her etc)

3) one time she was at the coffee shop and didn‚Äôt have a coat so he gave her his coat and even though she washed it and brought it back the next day it still kinda bothered me 

4 and probably the biggest one) she goes out a lot near the coffee shop so they see each other at bars they both frequent and hang out (while I‚Äôm home) and there have been a few occasions where he walked her back to her place (she lives like 15 min away) and hung out there for a while

I‚Äôve told him more than once that she makes me insecure because she‚Äôs honestly a lot prettier than me and more fun and everyone really likes her, and she‚Äôs always super sweet when I see her. I really don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs interested because she asks him to set her up w people a lot and talks about guys she‚Äôs hooking up with. Apparently she‚Äôs one of the reasons we started officially dating bc she told him how great I am and how he needs to stop being stupid.


There are a few more other examples but I‚Äôm really just a little scared. Even though she isn‚Äôt interested, im worried that she might suddenly become interested and that he‚Äôd leave me for her. He always reassures me but im not sure if I buy it.

Do you think that I should just go ahead and end this now? He‚Äôs a great guy and I love being with him, but I also just don‚Äôt love their dynamic.

TL;DR
my boyfriend has a close girl friend and I‚Äôm scared he‚Äôs secretly into her. She isn‚Äôt really reciprocating interest but im thinking about breaking up with him because im paranoid that if she suddenly decided she wanted to date, he‚Äôd leave me for him.",3,1736976419.0,relationship_advice,29,0.8,False

This post has been a long time in the making. For context, my first Mirena IUD was inserted in 2018 following a blood clot, I could no longer take the pill. In 2023, I had that IUD removed due to time, and a new Mirena inserted. 3 months after it was inserted, my skin completely blew up. The first IUD did not cause acne like the second one did. I had struggled with acne for ages - which was why I started birth control so young. But this was a different beast.

I saw three different PC doctors, nutritionists, dermatologists, OBs, and everyone said I had PCOS - that was the only answer. I took spironolactone, doxycycline, metformin - nothing helped. I was absolutely losing my mind. My self confidence was down the toilet, as a 29 year old with raging acne. I would wake up every morning and cry, stare into a magnifying mirror daily wondering how I was going to live my life like this forever. I focused on my skincare, changed my diet, stopped drinking coffee, dairy, and alcohol. I changed my exercise routine - started doing low impact movement and weights. Was taking every supplement recommended for PCOS and hormone imbalances. Started getting regular facials. Nothing helped. After 3 years of trying to figure out the combination, reading every reddit thread, I really did not know what to do. I was at a complete loss. Until I came across a 5 year old reddit thread where someone said their IUD caused hormonal acne. I immediately went to my camera roll and that's when I noticed the acne started 3 months after insertion. It was like a light switch and I realized that my IUD could even cause this - I never thought that since my first one didn't do this to me, and none of my doctors mentioned this could be a side effect. The next day, I went to my OB and had my IUD removed. A few weeks passed, and I started to see relief. 3 months after removal, I wasn't getting any new breakouts and things started healing. I also started seeing a new esthetician who specializes in hormonal acne. It's now been nearly 6 months without the IUD, and while my skin is not perfect, I'm finally able to focus on healing.

I'm sharing this because of the pain I was in for years. The physical pain from the cysts, and the emotional pain I felt on a daily basis. If you are struggling with acne, I see you. I feel for you. And I know the constant nag that is in your head, looking at everyone else's skin asking yourself ""why not me."" Keep trying. Keep educating yourself, and don't rely on doctors for the only source of truth. I am so thankful to the reddit community for sharing their experiences. As a woman, I felt so much pressure to be on birth control - that that was the only way to control your life. When in fact, birth control was the reason why I had no control. As a 29 year old, 13 of those years were on birth control. I had never lived an adult day of my life actually knowing what my body felt like without it - what my cycle was like without it. It has single handedly been the best decision I have made in my 20s.",13,1736975681.0,SkincareAddiction,16,0.84,False
1i27zqn,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/1i27zqn/cobels_vs_oirvings_tactics/,Cobel's vs. oIrving's Tactics,"A lot of theorizing on this sub says both Cobel and oIrving are trying to trigger memory bleed, which I agree with. Cobel with Mark (don't rush the saints, etc), and oIrv with his innie (coffee + loud music + painting and sending a message/visual about the testing floor)

However, Cobel and oIrv's approaches seem to be completely opposite in what I assume is attempting to achieve the same end:

* Cobel --> Wants Mark to get MORE sleep presumably to trigger memory bleed
* oIrv --> Is actively DEPRIVING himself of sleep presumably to trigger memory bleed

Do we think they are just by happenstance trying different techniques to achieve the same goal? Does one of them know something the other doesn't? Are we as the viewer just seeing different iterations of their memory bleed tests?

With our knowledge as the viewer, it seems to me oIrv may be more on the right track. When he starts to doze off, he gets the black paint goo drips, seemingly signifying memory bleed is occurring. The universe appears to further validate this logic with innies being discouraged for sleeping on the job (and IIRC iIrv was even punished for this).

Of course, Cobel's candle + wellness session technique also appeared to work with Mark making the tree out of clay. And arguably - without Cobel witnessing it - oMark's voiceover where he says he appreciates all things about Gemma equally.

In my mind, it doesn't logically make sense that both MORE sleep and LESS sleep - being the polar opposites of how they would effect the mind/individual - would achieve the same goal with memory bleed.

The way I see it, it would seem to make sense that less sleep = mind tired = mind slipping = memory bleed. Whereas more sleep would be mind refreshed = mind sharp = chip works better.

But it seems clear Cobel is driving the more sleep strategy, so I'm curious what you all think of Cobel's approach in this context? Why do we think Cobel thinks more sleep will trigger memory bleed?",1,1736975677.0,SeveranceAppleTVPlus,3,1.0,False

[$1,000-$1,500]","I purchased a Diletta Mio for $1,150 from Seattle Coffee Gear during Black Friday and received it just a couple weeks ago. Despite some initial disappointing quality control and setup issues, the machine is mostly as expected. SCG's customer service however has been slow and ineffective.

  
**Some things I like:**

* Water tank on the right-hand side is **essential** for me
* Supports simultaneous espresso brewing and milk steaming
* Cool-touch steam wand
* Precise PID temp control
* Pressure gauge
* Practical drip tray
* 110v for US

**On the fence:**

* The design is modern and neat. But I might prefer the design of the Lelits, Rockets, etc.

**Dislikes:**

* Minimal height clearance beneath the included double-spouted portafilter
* Portafilter doesn't rotate in all the way. Requires extra force just to get it part of the way in. Can't get it perpendicular to machine.

  
Around the same time I purchased the Mio I discovered Espresso Coffee Shop which sells espresso equipment for well under US retail. I actually purchased a Eureka grinder for half of what SCG charges. Diletta is SCG's in-house brand co-developed with an Italian manufacturer so you won't find it for a lower price on ECS or elsewhere.

  
I'm new to at home espresso brewing. With so many machines in the $1,000-$1,500 price range on ECS, I just wonder if I'm actually getting good value with the Diletta Mio from SCG or if it's overpriced like everything else they sell.

  
What are your thoughts on alternative machines in the price range (using ECS prices) and how do the alternatives stack up against the Mio? Note that I really need the water tank to be accessible from the right-hand side or front of the machine as I'm placing it in a corner beneath low-lying cabinets. This is partially why I pulled the trigger on the Mio at the time. Thank you for your suggestions!",1,1736975512.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

I've lived in Portland for a decade now and this city has been good to me. I started out slinging lattes at a hipster caf√© that (rightfully) took its coffee a little too seriously. After that, I went into the funeral industry during COVID. Since then, I've been trying to find my footing as an artist and writer, and stumbled into circus arts as a performer.

I've had the pleasure of performing at venues like the Alberta Rose Theatre, and even done street shows at the Belmont Street Fair, with my 7 foot unicycle.

A few months ago I got my first book contract!

This 19th century gothic thriller novel The Black Carnival, is going to debut in the autumn and I plan to have some events at Powell's. If you like A24 films and series like Peaky Blinders, this story might be up your alley.

I haven't signed with a massive publishing company, in fact some might call it 'indie' so like many artists from this city, I'm looking to my local community both online and person help get things off the ground.

The book has a little less than a humble 200 preorders, and it would mean the world to me if the city could help rally behind it.

There's a full synopsis on the official website, and buttons linking to preorders there as well. Hope to see some of you at Powell's in the fall!

Looking for advice on my next career move.

About six months ago, my girlfriend and I were in a tough spot‚Äîwe had just moved out, both lost our jobs, were drowning in debt, and my car broke down. I didn‚Äôt have much time to think, so I took my current job because we needed cash immediately.

The role is a BDR position for a recruiting and compliance software company. I‚Äôve been grinding hard‚Äîbooked more demos in my first month than anyone in company history, and I started this January with 5 demos on the very first day. I know I‚Äôm good at what I do, and I have a proven track record of being a top performer at my last three jobs.

But here‚Äôs the problem: the pay and structure are killing me. I‚Äôm making $40K right now, with a raise to $44K coming soon. Commission is $30 per demo (industry standard is $100-$150), and deals take up to 6 months to close. Even then, I only see $300-$500 per closed deal, and the payout depends entirely on the AE. I‚Äôve been working hard, but I haven‚Äôt seen a dime beyond my base so far.

They delay the payouts for demos by a month not sure why‚Ä¶ there delivered‚Ä¶ what are we waiting for I want my bonus, I understand the contracts delayed a month to be paid in full for that commission but‚Ä¶why..

Management feels overly controlling‚Äîyou have to tread carefully when the owners are around, and communication feels stifled. The only real perk is coffee, but we‚Äôre still the ones expected to clean up the kitchen. It‚Äôs a far cry from my last company, where the CEO would personally bring energy to the office, recognize our efforts, and motivate us to excel‚Äîand on top of that, I was making great money. I‚Äôm eager to get back into a real sales role where my performance directly translates into high earnings.

I‚Äôm at the point where I know it‚Äôs time for a change. I‚Äôm looking for a role where I can thrive‚Äîa base of $50K-$60K would be fine if there‚Äôs a good commission structure and room for growth. Ultimately, I want to be in a role where I can make $100K+ because I know I can perform at that level.

If anyone has advice on transitioning to a better BDR/SDR role or suggestions on companies that actually reward top performers, I‚Äôd love to hear it. I‚Äôm active on LinkedIn and already hunting, but any additional tips or referrals would mean the world.

It‚Äôs been a tough couple of days for me so I‚Äôm just trying to collect things in my head.
I‚Äôve been with my bf for over 3 years, we‚Äôve known each other for almost five but it took a bit of time since we decided to try as a couple. ‚ÄûThe talk‚Äù was my initiative, but since that day he was consistent, we travelled together with his friends, I met his family etc, not a day went by that we would not talk. He gave me the Keys to his place and I gave him the keys to mine. 
Deep down, I was still not entirely sure of his feelings for me, as he never said he loved me; still, he did the other things. Except ever going on dates, or giving me flowers, but it was ok. All I wanted to do is to be with him. What always bothered me was his insta following and likes; he would follow over 800 people, mostly women that would follow him back, and liked the photos in their galleries. I once even saw him commenting ‚Äû<3‚Äù under a girl‚Äôs post, to which she responded. I confronted him about this and he would not comment, but always had some story about the following. 
It‚Äôs out of his initiative that we spent the new years period together, he Even took a couple days off. 
Now, I know I have flaws. I can be short tempered when overstimulated, which I am, out of stress and anxiety. For exemple a couple weeks before the new years I went with him to help him place his second car in a parking lot for the winter, cool, ofc I could do that for him. On the way back I asked him if he doesn‚Äôt mind that we stop by the gas station because I was already on reserve, and I didn‚Äôt want to deal with it in the morning, this was my car and i was driving and paying. He proceeded to complain how he didn‚Äôt want to do it, better we go strait home etc. I got kinda mad because he knew I was anxious with driving in general, I was nit screamjng or anything but I had attitude and complained back about how it‚Äôs such a short, simple thing to do on the way and he was all acting up. We went home without tanking. I collected my thoughts and was cool after this, he put on the movie that I wanted to watch and all was ok. This is just an exemple of situations like this that would happen.

Back to new years. He came to see me the 30th and we went to get tobbacco that he wanted to buy for his pipe, that took like 30 minutes and I was totally fine with me. I asked if he would like to do grocwries so we wouldn‚Äôt have to worry for the days to come. He said idk, i don‚Äôt want to. Later on it turned out he‚Äôd like to, so we went. I complained how i left the shopping bags in the car because he said we wouldn‚Äôt go groceru shopping. Ok. Not a big deal. I cooked carbonara after we came back to my place as he was trying out the tobbacoo. Normally it‚Äôs him cooking, so it was fine. 
December 31st. He made me tea to drink to bed to wake me up, still asleep I said something along the lines of ‚Äûooh i wont drink that so early in the morning‚Äù. It was not very nice of me, I felt bad. He said ‚Äûof course, it‚Äôs my fault‚Äù and went to the living room. Rest of the day was fine. He actually slept for a couple hours.
In the evening we were watching some tv and chilling, drinking some whiskey coke that he was making. The last movie we watched before midnight was ‚ÄûThe eternal sunshine of a spotless mind‚Äù. Just before midnight, we went to the balcony. We kissed as midnight came. I said we would see the fireworks better if we came downstairs, as the buildings were covering most of it. He said no, by the time we went down the fireworks would end. They went off for more than 10 minutes after that. The alcohol mixed with my frustration and I counlnt shut up about how he would just say no to go and do anything, but then I just stopped myself, I felt it was stupid. We started to watch some music videos, i was dancing. ‚ÄûFinally you‚Äôre happy‚Äù, he said. He was then showing me something on his phone, when I though I saw something - ‚Äûshow me your phone for a sec‚Äù ‚Äûno, nobody touches my phone‚Äù. I asked why, it‚Äôs not like i wanted to go through his messages or something, that‚Äôs what o said too. ‚ÄûBecause it‚Äôs my phone‚Äù. 
I felt so frustrated how he wouldn‚Äôt Even try to reason, my anxiety mixed with my frustration that a together mixed with all the alcohol. I stood up, went to the bathroom to get ready to sleep and just went to the bed. He came to ask me if i really was going to sleep right now as it wasn‚Äôt that late, and i said yes. He then sat for a couple hours before the tv, drinking beer.
Next day we wouldn‚Äôt talk at all since the early morning, he tried to show me something funny but i still felt hurt he wouldn‚Äôt talk to me about the phone, I said he avoided talking about what he didn‚Äôt want to talk about. 
We did wverything in silence January 1st, still we ate together, I made him coffee and tea. In the evening he would Just get dressed and left.
I called him crying later, saying I‚Äôm sorry I ruined new years. He said it‚Äôs ok, but was distant ever since. I tried initiating seeing each other, said I wanted to be next to him and I felt bad.
He responded with how ‚Äûi always complain we sit at home and now I wanted to just sit with him‚Äù. I responded with ‚Äûno, I know sometimes I say too much but in the end I always feel the happiest next to you‚Äù. He said the new years made him think if he saw is together anymore, that something didn‚Äôt sit right with him since the summer and that he didn‚Äôt make the decision yet, but we needed to talk.
We met to talk in 2 days after, he was physically distant, didn‚Äôt kiss me to say hi. We sat there watching funny shit before I initiated the difficult talk. I said I saw him being distant and asked what is it he wanted to talk about. He said he feels like I have changed, how maybe we are not exactly a match as a couple, how he didn‚Äôt miss me the last couple days but felt like he got used to me. Like what happened on new years was not the first time I had short temper. I agreed with him, said I notice this, too, and am about to talk to a therapist. Then he explained how he actually was dissapointed I wouldn‚Äôt clean his apartament reguralsly (I did a couple times, he just never asked me) and how he would actually enjoy if I cooked him after he comes back from work (he cooks most of the time and mostly didn‚Äôt like when I did, again never brought this up). He said that he was surprised when I was panicked with prefnancy scare, as he would actually like to have 3 or 4 kids and that I used to talk about it more lightly before. All like he just made up his mind it‚Äôs over.
I asked, why did you never talk to me about this before, he always talked about his plans for the future in the first person. I never felt included, so how was i supposed to know he considered me a part of it? I realised how big of an issue communication was in this relationship. We parted to ‚Äûrethink this conversation‚Äù.
He kept being distant afterwards. Did not really want to talk casually, did not initiate. So I asked him to spare me the pain of waiting and just say it if its over for him. He said yes and he thought it would be the best for both of us. 
He said it hurt him and he still holds me very close but he belives its for the best. I asked him to try again, that Im willing to work on myself, because I loved him and he was the most important to me. He apologised to never have brought up any conversation before. He made up his mind without trying to save us.

So I‚Äôm there a couple of days later, trying to put my pi√®ces back together after he left me like that. 
Do you think he actually lost all of his feelings for me, if he had them in the first place? Do you think that maybe he actually met somebody else? Or is my attitude just unbearable for a healthy man? Is it possible he changes his mind?

Growing up as an only child without an older sibling, I understand the longing for guidance. Now, I strive to be the mentor I wished I had, ensuring others feel supported and avoid the mistakes I made. To my fellow only children, be the ate or kuya you always wanted, you might change someone‚Äôs life more than you realize.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I recently graduated from college in 2023 and am currently pursuing law. My stress levels with life are at an all-time high, but I recently managed to find some free time to visit my former institution. I reconnected with close friends who are professors and some students from the lower batches that I had the privilege of mentoring through my former organizations.

When I started college, I was a lost soul, unsure of what to do or how to prepare. Luckily, I knew some seniors from high school who helped me navigate this new chapter. Among them, I shared a special and genuine connection with one. He taught me the ropes of living alone on Taft Avenue, guided me on what to do, and warned me about what to avoid. His words and lessons stayed with me and carried me through college, even though we only had a few months together. Sadly, we no longer talk for various reasons, but I will always appreciate everything we shared. He was the closest thing I ever had to a kuya.

This visit made me reflect on my relationship with a friend from a lower batch, who is three years younger than me. I invited him out for coffee and lunch to catch up. He‚Äôs still the joyful, energetic student I remember, fully embracing his college experience. Seeing his happiness reminded me of my younger self, filled with excitement and hope for the future. Afterward, I offered him a ride home, as he lives nearby in Makati. During the drive, he expressed his gratitude, telling me how much it meant to him that I was someone he could look up to. He shared a lot of things related to the advice and stories I gave a few years ago and how it improved his life in Manila. He thanked me for being his kuya and said I was the older brother that he never had.

The ride home was an emotional one. Over the years, I‚Äôve learned to suppress my emotions, but this moment was something I wanted to embrace fully. I realized that I‚Äôve become a kuya to many of the younger kids. Being there for them, guiding them to avoid the mistakes I made, softened my heart and brought tears to my eyes.

Growing up, I never had a kuya or a kuya figure. I was often the independent kid, yearning for help that never came. Now that I‚Äôm in the position of being a kuya to others, I‚Äôm determined to ensure they never feel the same pain, the kind that lingers and resurfaces when you‚Äôre sipping whiskey late at night.

So, to all the redditors here who grew up as an only child, especially those who longed for an ate or kuya to share stories with or seek advice from, remember that you can become that guiding presence for the younger generation. Be the ate or kuya you always wished you had, someone who listens, supports, and guides with kindness. Your impact might mean more to them than you‚Äôll ever know.

The host had asked us in advance if we wanted a 19 L drinking water bottle when we arrived, as the tap water is not drinkable.  We understood we had to pay for it, which was no problem as we were planning on buying water anyway and having it delivered. We could not find a water dispenser anywhere and when I called the housekeeper to ask where it was, she said people keep breaking them, so they don‚Äôt provide one anymore (even though there was a photo of a water dispenser in the photos). She  said we should just tilt the large jug and pour it into a plastic container they have and to just use it from there. We told them it is difficult for us to reliably hold and tilt and pour from that jug, being senior citizens with some mild strength/mobility challenges. She said, we‚Äôll ANYONE can do that, with a critical tone. We then found an unbreakable one in a local store that was not very expensive, and we bought it, but they said they will not pay for it.  

They listed a coffee maker as an amenity, and it was here, but instead of the regular glass carafe, there was an old damaged dented stained aluminum pot. Neither we nor anybody we know back home uses aluminum because of the health risks, especially for hot water, and also an aluminum pot has a very hot handle, but they don‚Äôt provide any potholders.  They said this is what they have, and would not provide us a glass coffee carafe  for the coffee maker or a tea kettle so we could use the pour over filter we brought, and the only thing we could use to heat water for coffee is a large stainless steel cooking pot or the small old aluminum pot. 

We have to walk 100 m to the local trash area to take the garbage out, and he is not providing us with any garbage bags other than the one that was here. (We are going to be here for two months) 

The last thing is that we are a couple who does many things together, but not everything, and there is an outside gate that we only have one key for, which must be locked at all times, which means we can‚Äôt go out and do different things during the day and come back at different times. When we asked for another gate key, he said no, he only provides one. There are two other houses behind this gate that he owns and rents out long-term. 

One more thing which we haven‚Äôt asked about yet, because he seems very irritated with us, is there were nice Adirondack chairs in several photos of the front porch, and the amenities  listing said that there is patio furniture, but they are not here, there are only two kitchen chairs, which are not very comfortable. 

Are any of these things reasonable for a host to not provide?  There are some more details which are complicated to explain, but it feels like there‚Äôs a very hostile energy from both the owner and the housekeeper right now (He actually complained to Airbnb about us asking him for these things, and said that we were disrespectful to his coworkers, but I only spoke to the housekeeper once on the phone, asking her where things were, and the teenager, who is the only one we have met in person around here who doesn‚Äôt speak English but felt like a very genial meeting, trying to understand each other 

We‚Äôve been to this country and town several times before, and a reasonable pot for heating water, a water dispenser, trash bags, etc. were always provided (meaning, these are things that we have always been provided to us and everyone else we know who come to this place)

Thanks for reading and giving me any feedback!

EDIT: 
a few more things: the listing said there was a washing machine at the house, but it's actually a shared washer behind another house on the property, and they said there was a garden and grassy yard which does not exist, there are just some plants between the 3 houses and a gravel path. also THE BATHROOM DID NOT HAVE A PLUNGER! A bowel movement was going down slowly, so we noticed there was no plunger and asked the host for one, and he started accusing us that we must have flushed something down there that doesn't belong (this country asks everyone everywhere to not flush toilet paper which we know about and we don't do) and did not seem to understand that most bathrooms have a plunger in the bathroom in case it is needed so you don't have to call somebody to deal with it at an inconvenient time for everybody.

It may not be the case in your meeting but in my meeting, the member count is typically ten women for every man. It is said that every alcoholic affects the lives of at least twenty people but, certainly, those twenty people can‚Äôt all be women. So why aren‚Äôt there more men in Al Anon? Some evenings, I‚Äôm the only man in the room.  
  
When I first came to Al-Anon more than seven years ago, I sat in my car wondering if I was really going to do this. Then I darted from my car to the back door of the church, trying not to be seen. After all, I was the man, the head of the family, the breadwinner‚Äîin charge. There shouldn‚Äôt be any problem that I couldn‚Äôt handle.  
  
I walked in the basement of the small stone church, and there sat three women at a folding table covered with little placard slogans and coffee cup stains. They proceeded through the ritual of reading the Steps and Traditions and sharing announcements among themselves and with me.  
To my thinking ‚Äì which I had yet to realize was unhealthy thinking ‚Äì it was nonsense! I wondered who was in charge. I wanted answers, not announcements about other meetings and workshops. I wanted to know how to make my wife stop drinking. They were patient, told me the program was for me, not for the alcoholic, and to ‚ÄúKeep Coming Back.‚Äù I left dissatisfied and crossed Al Anon off my list of things to try.  
  
A year later, I was back. The drinking had progressed and, by that time, I was broken, on my knees, and ready to listen. Still, the feeling persisted that I needed to find another man who understood my situation: raising children, trying to keep a job, and dealing with feelings that I thought men weren‚Äôt supposed to have‚Äîlike fear. And, there were things about Al Anon that weren‚Äôt typically male, like hugging, wicker baskets, and butterflies; and much of the literature spoke of ‚Äúhis‚Äù drinking and ‚Äúher‚Äù pain.  
  
I went from meeting to meeting; I would occasionally run into another man who was often new to the program, as well. Afterward, I would ask women, who seemed calm and at peace, if they knew of a man in the program who would understand my situation.  
  
Again, they were always patient. They would smile and ask more about my situation, give me a few things to think about like ‚ÄúFirst Things First,‚Äù or ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll know when it‚Äôs time.‚Äù Finally, in this runaround way, I learned about Bill, who had been in the program for ten years. I found Bill and he became my Sponsor. He shared wise thoughts and advice that was not unlike what those smiling women had been saying all along.  
  
Seven years later, it‚Äôs my turn. I don‚Äôt always know what to say when a man walks into our meeting as a newcomer. If they‚Äôre on their knees, like I was, then I think maybe this will be their time to stay and I offer them a thought that I hope will stick.  
  
But most don‚Äôt stay, and I know they will continue to be affected by alcoholism; it‚Äôs a problem that will not be solved, controlled, or denied. It doesn‚Äôt recognize distinctions between social status, faith, family heritage, or whether you‚Äôre a man or a woman.  
  
Ultimately, over time and in these rooms, the women in  
Al-Anon have served as some of my best role models: they have kept their jobs, raised their children, made time for their own recovery, and learned how to make tough decisions. I have discovered how much we have in common, even amid the occasional butterfly sticker.

1i27ge9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diverticulitis/comments/1i27ge9/my_experience_six_weeks_in/,My experience (six weeks in),"Hello all, thank you for the community you have created and the resources that you all have compiled here. This has been a useful place to find context while navigating recovery from my first flare. 

For context: 32 M - 6‚Äô 3‚Äù 185lbs - active (cyclist, skier, runner etc)

On December 1st (6 weeks ago) was feeling bloated and like I was having some indigestion. Felt like it would go away overnight so I continued my life as normal. Biked to work the next day and symptoms had not subsided, wasn‚Äôt in a ton of pain but couldn‚Äôt focus on my job due to generalized pressure and bloating. Biked home on my lunch break and noticed that symptoms were not subsiding. Began to notice a lack of appetite, nausea, and a low fever. Called a telehealth doctor and due to my age, symptoms and context they told me I really had to go to the ER to rule out appendicitis. This was my first trip to the ER as an adult and after 6.5 hours there, blood work, a CT scan, some IV antibiotics and also my first dose of Flagyl, I was released with a diagnosis of mild uncomplicated diverticulitis. No real suggestions about the plan moving forward minus following up with my PCP.

Thanks to this subreddit and friends whose parents have experienced this I was given good advice and didn‚Äôt immediately return to my diet. I started off with broth, popsicles, white rice in broth, and some unseasoned tofu. And day over day I started to feel better and more normal. I will say - this process has been interesting considering the flare symptoms weren‚Äôt particularly targeted to one side of my abdomen or the other (DV was in descending). As I started to recuperate - the feeling changed from gas and bloating to more of a ‚Äúburny‚Äù soreness across my lower abdomen, I followed up with a PCP three days later, all of my vitals had returned to normal and they told me I could ‚Äúreturn to a normal diet as soon as I could handle it‚Äù (I did not do this) - and ‚ÄúI should follow up with a GI doc to make sure it isn‚Äôt cancer‚Äù (I am seeing this GI doc tomorrow). 

After two and a half weeks and adding some more cooked vegetables and ground poultry and dairy I felt like I wasn‚Äôt making progress so I scheduled another follow up with my PCP and by the time I got there I was just feeling a little ‚Äúache‚Äù in my gut but nothing acute. This doctor said ‚Äúwhat are you doing here you‚Äôre too young for this!‚Äù But listened to all my questions, told me I was doing the right thing, and told me to ‚Äúenjoy my holidays, have some sweets‚Äù (this I also did not do).

I continued to stick with ‚Äúsafe‚Äù foods that were not eliciting reactions, and slowly began ramping up fiber starting with plain oatmeal from week 3 on, adding more fibrous cooked vegetables after week four, returning to coffee in week three (thank goodness) and remaining SUPER hydrated (120+ ounces a week). No fried food, no alcohol, no red meat. I had some feelings of lack of progress after eating straight dairy or having a latte with regular milk (not oat milk thankfully!) and so I removed those variables as well and experienced more progress. From week 4-5 I added lentils (great success) and other home made MILD vegetarian Indian food (with ground spices not whole seeds). Around NYE I was feeling great and pushed my luck by having a day with oats, lentils, dairy, complex carbs AND beans (dairy with the beans too) and woke up the next day feeling less good but not in pain. Dialed back the diet to dairy free and foods with a proven track record. Four days later felt great again and made a butternut squash orzo and that was a similar step back (but less than beans) so dialed it in again and three days after that reintroduced lentils (success!). I‚Äôve been keeping a food journal and writing my thoughts on all of this because it has been all consuming, I‚Äôve had a hard time being present and not hyper fixating on what I‚Äôve eaten and what the consequences might be. The uncertainty has made it hard to plan for the future, even months away. I will say the break from booze and processed food has actually been nice, and my community has been great meeting me for coffees and walks around. 

I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing the GI tomorrow and asking questions, I currently feel pretty normal. I‚Äôm sleeping great, I‚Äôm running again, bike commuting again, skiing again and during those activities I feel great. I will admit when I sit in silence, I still don‚Äôt feel quite - right, but I‚Äôm very open to that being partially or fully because of how stressful this last month has been. I will plan on continue slowly and intentionally adding foods, keeping my healthy habits, and thanking the people in my life for their support and hoping for the best. I‚Äôll hopefully get a colonoscopy scheduled soon and get some more clarity from that. I understand this process isn‚Äôt linear, and that has been difficult. The internet saying that all of this will ‚Äúresolve within a week!‚Äù Vs. the reality of my slight discomfort and food sensitivity weeks later has been at points hard to deal with. I hope that I can one day look back at this as an opportunity where I made positive changes in my life and some of the healthy foods added (oatmeal, I‚Äôve really come around) have been revelations.


I just wanted to post this because I found posts like this helpful throughout my process so far. I left the dates in so that years from now when someone reads this in their panic they can get a sense of my timeline, and I hope everyone finds some relief whatever that looks like for them. I‚Äôm still hopeful that the day will come I feel 100% normal again, and maybe I won‚Äôt even notice when it happens. 

Thanks y‚Äôall for sharing your experiences - it‚Äôs helpful not to feel alone in all this. ",3,1736974295.0,Diverticulitis,2,1.0,False

I was driving an hour each way to work my coworker made it miserable and after having my daughter it was hard to be back. December 31 was my last day of work. After many tear calls to my husband after work we decided it was best for me to stay home with our daughter. I feel like im learning a new routine and adjusting which feels exhausting. My daughter is almost 10 months so I feel like ""sleep when the baby sleeps"" is an excuse at this point. I feel guilty not working due to living at my in laws while we prepare land for our future home. As much as I love being with my daughter I feel like I should be working to have our future home sooner. I wake up at 6:30 every morning to make a hot breakfast for my husband before work and get his lunch ready for the day. I make my coffee and then my daughter wakes up so mornings are productive but by late afternoon I'm out of it. I don't have mom friends which can be hard. I feel guilty in a way that my daughter don't play with other babies since pulling her out of daycare. 

Any advice or ideas, for me as a recent new SAHM? Things to do with my daughter (she's not yet crawling so some things may not be beneficial for her like a children's museum for her to crawl around and play). Any advice on getting her on a schedule? She naps and gets tired for the night around the same time every day. Night time is rough lately as we lay her day at same time in her crib she has only fell asleep if my husband is holding her. Transferring her to crib hasn't been an issue just falling asleep alone. How to keep each day interesting for her? ",1,1736974267.0,sahm,4,1.0,False

Just upgraded from over 10ths with Sage/Breville Dual Boiler to Micra and Atom 65w grinder.
The issue is I‚Äôm having to completely redial-in every 1/2 days. First thought it might be due to beans but now tried 3 different med to dark roasts with same result.
Example 
Dial in . Getting nice 17 in / 34 out in 29 -31 secs.  Two or three shots over day and all consistent.  Setting on Atom 4.
Next day 17 in / 34 out but gushes out in about 18 secs. Puck is perfect. No channeling and fully saturated..
Dial in again. Get back to 34 out in 30-31 secs.  Atom now at 2. Puck good and tastes great. 2-3 more shots over the day. Same result.
Next day 17 in but machine is choked - 3-4g out in 25 secs. Dial in again (4 to 5 sink shots). Atom now at 3.5. Eventually get to 17g in 34 out in 29 secs. Tastes good. OK for two days / 6-7 shots . All same ratio in 28-33 secs.
Next day . Gusher.34g in about 15 secs.  Back to dial in again.

So no idea why this is happening.
Coffee is about 14 days post roast.
Puck prep is really good. (WDT plus paper filter on top. Never get channelling. Naked PF and pour looks great.
Checked weight off Atom in case this was issue and was inside .5g variation.

Hi! I‚Äôm Stephanie. I‚Äôm 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection, something close to a relationship. I‚Äôd like to find someone I can confide in, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older. Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don‚Äôt have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I am single, and would prefer that you are as well. I‚Äôm not looking to change my situation at this time, but do crave a relationship-like connection. I‚Äôm not interested in anything solely or immediately nsfw in nature, I prefer to know a person quite well before that. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health

* [This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/zUFNfnA)

That‚Äôs just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages.

While she was a little upset that I wanted to keep things casual she said she understood and said that it was just a little hard for her.

So my question is, if I get one a super auto machine (budget up to $5K, thinking maybe a Jura), will I still get a good enough quality espresso that I'll be able to taste the same flavor as my favorite coffee shops, and be able to mimic what I would normally order at the shop?

You won't find me camping, hiking, or running a marathon‚ÄîI prefer my adventures in or near civilization with AC, tasty food, and a proper cup of coffee or tea.

1i2749r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Microdiscectomy/comments/1i2749r/now_3_weeks_post_opday_22/,Now 3 weeks post op(day 22),"Since I posted here ([original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Microdiscectomy/comments/1hrxs13/day_9_post_op_curious_about_few_things_doctors/)) about my Dec  24th surgery on my L5/S1 having a 3cm chunk taken out I have had a lot of good and bad. I have continued to experience a lot of my pre-surgery pain which seems to be in a way coming back but not as bad, to go along with the numbness/calf pain I got seemingly FROM surgery that I was told could take weeks/months to resolve due to them having to retract the nerve during surgery. The hip/butt/thigh stuff that seemed to mostly disappear post op has come back a bit which has me concerned, but not yet to some intolerable amount. My hope is it's just flaring up a bit before going back down. My Right calf/knee area tightness/pain is my primary issue at this point.   
  
That said...both of these are slowly getting better. Today I woke up and noticed a significant difference in the numbness in my toes. The small toes are the remaining numb area though it creeps into my foot/calf sometimes still. I just went on a walk for about 1.5miles without it getting all that uncomfortable today, which is the first time since early October I think I can say I did so. That seems to be just getting better and better every day too. My mobility is increasing daily and if I hadn't been strictly told to avoid bending/twisting I probably could better than pre-op at this point. Sitting still seems to be causing me the most trouble but a little less every day. Pre op I would get up and hobble around the house to make coffee etc and I noticed today I just popped up mostly pain free and had no troubles for a bit. Like many, my pain is best earlier in the day, worse in evening/night.   
  
So I'm both concerned but also a bit encouraged. I still have a good bit of swelling around the incision site which makes me think I probably still have a good amount of inflammation INSIDE my body/spine still as well so the fact I'm nowhere near ""better"" I guess is to be expected. So I was hoping for better quicker result for sure, but I'm also for sure getting something out of this here. If you are feeling discouraged as I was day 9, I would just echo those who preach patience. For the first time I'm starting to really think this maybe was ""successful"" and I just need to give it time to heal.  I would definitely consider it a success even if it just means I can walk and sit normal again and do normal human things. I hoped I might get back to intense workouts/etc but I'll take what I can get after a miserable 6 months now.

Things between me (37M) and my wife (32F) cooled down almost immediately after. Shocking, I know. I stopped trying in general the last few weeks because I wasn‚Äôt in the mood to navigate the rejection while we work on ‚Äúus‚Äù. Fast forward to earlier this week, my wife sends a goofy meme that it‚Äôs ‚ÄúNational Buy Your Favorite MILF an Iced Coffee Day‚Äù. I take the casual implication she‚Äôs identifying as a MILF flirtatiously and shoot my shot. 

It misses, obviously.


ANYWAYS, only update on that front.

Meanwhile, at work I‚Äôm chatting with my friend (late 20s F) because it‚Äôs what we do sometimes. I‚Äôve recognized she‚Äôs someone I‚Äôm attracted to in the past and try to minimize my time with her, but if I had to be honest, in a different world‚Ä¶ she strikes a lot of chords for me, both as a person and in looks. Former is probably why we‚Äôre such solid friends. 

Anyways, we‚Äôre discussing awkward teenage years and parents. Im a pretty vanilla dude, but I do have ***one*** kink. I *really* like facefucking. Im sure most guys do, but it‚Äôs next level for me. Already had a couple rounds? Im on SSRI‚Äôs? Surefire way to get to the promised land for me. Don‚Äôt know why, shit sends me through a loop. Naturally, I haven‚Äôt indulged in almost six years now.

So talking with my friend, and she mentions she used to share something flirtatious around her mom to embarrass her. Without thinking I mused ‚ÄúHuh, what‚Äôd you say‚Äù?

‚ÄúOh, um,‚Äù looking around making sure no one is in earshot, ‚ÄúThat I don‚Äôt have a gag reflex.‚Äù

Took every ounce of willpower I had not react as blood rushed from my brain. Just a sudden flash of my friend in my head and now I‚Äôve got this monkey on my back I have no healthy way to handle. My wife *also* doesn‚Äôt have a gag reflex and **yall** - to quote the younger generation, that shit is peak. I loved being able to grab a fistful of my now-wife‚Äôs hair and taking her like it‚Äôs my last day on earth.

I really, really wish I could go home to my wife and channel all of this energy through her. There was a time she‚Äôd *encouraged* me to do just that. Instead Im gonna go take a shower and jerk off with the knowledge I‚Äôm not going to fuck anyone, in the mouth or elsewhere. I hate this. I hate this entire aspect of myself I can no longer explore or speak about or *anything* without feeling like Im ‚Äúwrong‚Äù.

My favorite first‚Ä¶You‚Äôre Cheeky. I do think it‚Äôs similar to GG Blush. This one is one of the stronger longer lasting of the bunch. I wore this yesterday and even after a shower I could smell it on my skin. It‚Äôs a beautiful feminine floral vanilla scent. I love it and plan to buy more. 

Guilty As A Fig‚Ä¶I really enjoy this one. I have never smelled either of the perfumes this has been compared to, so I can‚Äôt speak to it smelling like either. This is more of a skin scent. It‚Äôs the lightest of all, at least on my skin. It‚Äôs sweet fig based with musk and very slightly floral. I have nothing like this in my perfume collection. I can‚Äôt wait to buy all the body care on sale of course!

Aqua Hour‚Ä¶This one is the second strongest longest lasting on me anyway. It‚Äôs a burst of citrus (grapefruit to me) at first spray and then the watery bergamot kicks in with peony. It‚Äôs a freshy marine perfume. Leans just a tad masculine even with the floral. This will make a great summer scent. 

Midnight Addiction‚Ä¶I find this one to be close to Black Opium but better. It‚Äôs not as sharp if that makes sense. The sweet plum and coffee bean are the star and the almond makes it creamy like. I thought this one would be stronger like BO. It‚Äôs a medium on strength and long lasting. I like it a lot. Great date night perfume.

Viva Vanilla‚Ä¶Amber, plum and vanilla is what I get. It‚Äôs a medium on strength and longevity. I do get a bit of Ariana Grande dna. And I get a bit of Vanilla Vice. It‚Äôs a great vanilla variation for the vanilla girlies. 

Loyal To You‚Ä¶I left this one behind because every time I sprayed it there was a strong alcohol note. I did get sweet lemon with the orange flower and vanilla like DG Devotion, but thought it was better since I don‚Äôt like Devotion. I thought it‚Äôs something I may try whereas I would never buy DG Devotion. Again, I got a lot of alcohol with this one. 

Seeing Rouge‚Ä¶I left this one behind also because I have a million and one BR540 dna perfumes and I‚Äôm kinda over it for now. 

Covered in Roses‚Ä¶I didn‚Äôt even spray this one because I hate strongly based rose scents and this one is exactly that. Great one for those who love Delina or want Delina at 4% of the cost of a full size bottle. ",16,1736973143.0,bathandbodyworks,1,1.0,False

Removing my limb hand from my keyboard, I mosey it down into my front pocket. Falling into place around my phone like the hands of virtuosic violinist taking command of their bow. I pick up the call before the phone even leaves my pocket. Looking down at my thigh, the phone creeps into view from behind the fabric of my jeans. The caller id is not as expected. ‚ÄúBlood Bank‚Äù. I take the phone to my cheek.

 

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I spoke like I questioned if someone was at the other end.

 

‚ÄúYes, hello It‚Äôs Michelle from the blood bank, are you aware of how much of a difference 20 minutes of your time can do for others?‚Äù As phone salesmen come they all seem aggressively upbeat. But she was something different. She didn‚Äôt really sound like a woman. She sounded feminin; but too aggressive in her sales pitch. Like someone had coerced her into having the cadence of a top salesman. It was slightly off-putting, in that same way as salesmen admittedly always are.

 

‚ÄúNo. Sorry Michelle but I am actually not that interested in blood donations.‚Äù After I said it, I realised that she had set a trap for me. Her initial question was designed for me to stay on the line. Even my no was an invitation to educate me further on the possibilities of helping others. And she was at it immediately.

 

‚ÄúThat is no fault of yours mister. Many people have no idea.‚Äù She sounded playful.

‚ÄúWhen donating blood you are actually donating three separate life saving materials. That means that only one donation could save three lives. That‚Äôs only 20 minutes of your time! Doesn‚Äôt it sound exiting to make such a big difference to so many people?‚Äù

 

It was an malicious question to end on. What could I say to that? I wouldn‚Äôt capitulate to her that easily. I was figuring out how to divert without sounding selfish. Noticing my hesitation she started again.

 

‚ÄúIf you are willing to become one of our lifesavers you are in luck! Because we are actually extending a special service to people in your neighbourhood. That means that if you want us too, we can come to you! Dosen‚Äôt that make it convient? Do you know what blood type you have sir?‚Äù

 

Reacquiring my footing I try again.

‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôm actually not really interested.‚Äù

 

Ignoring me again she changed path.

‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs fine most people aren‚Äôt that keen on knowing their blood type. But figuring out what blood type you have could potentially save your life. It can be vital in future emergency situations. Are you interested in the home donation service?‚Äù

 

‚Äúhow would that help me?‚Äù I guess this was the idea. Keep me on the line until they finally posed me a piece of information I was interested in.

 

‚Äúwell sir, If you are ever in the hospital the doctors would be able to match your social security number to your blood type. Making sure you can receive blood immediately without waiting for doctors to do testing in such a time sensitive situation. So this donation is also a chance to help yourself.‚Äù

 

I am not much for a sales pitch. But this one worked. I could tell others I had done a good deed. And I was actually creating a safety net for myself. Besides, chicks dig men that donate, and this is by far the least time expending option.

‚ÄúIs that information automatically put into the system?‚Äù

 

‚ÄúYes our staff will fill it in for you‚Äù

 

‚ÄúYou said you could come to me?‚Äù

 

‚ÄúYes. We have nurses that will travel from donor to donor during normal business hours.‚Äù

 

They are bringing their nurse to me. I guess it is more convient. Well any method they use to save more taxpaying lives, I guess.

 

‚ÄúWhat time?‚Äù

 

‚ÄúAnywhere within normal working hours, we will schedule a route that matches our donors preferences.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be home around one o¬¥clock on Thursday‚Äù Even though I work from home I wanted to give a time. It just felt like a way of taking back control over the conversation. I deserved to make them come too me when I wanted. And as much as I regret to admit it, saying one o‚Äôclock meant I was sure to be awake by then. Being single with a programming job made it a little to easy to sleep in late. This often forces me to code at night. I tell my self I‚Äôm a night writer, but really I think by now procrastinating has become so prevalent in my life that I am forced to schedule around it.

 

‚ÄúThat will fit perfectly, one o‚Äôclock Thursday. What‚Äôs the address?‚Äù

 

\[redacted\]

 

‚ÄúPerfect. I wont take up any more of your time mister..‚Äù

 

‚ÄúSkinner‚Äù

 

‚ÄúHave a great day mister Skinner‚Äù

 

‚ÄúYou too miss‚Äù as I took the phone away from my ear I was reminded of my fear of needles. I never had an easy time with foreign objects being inserted into me. I remember telling my highschool girlfriend that it was a good thing I wasn‚Äôt into men. I think statements like that is why she left; although she did manage to laugh them off in the beginning. I still think those same idiotic thoughts. I feel a kind of connection to my past as I laugh about it; just as she used to. I hang up the phone as the first snikker leaves my lips. Hope Michelle didn‚Äôt hear that. God I am such an awkward man.





As the day creeps closer, I start feeling my skin clinging itself tighter to my tissues. Tucking away my veins behind their only layer of protection. Looking at the soft skin in my elbow joint has become habitual. Eyeing down the treasonous vein puffing out my skin right at the most opportune point of attack. Looking at it forces conjurations of being penetrated. The sensation of the needle rubbing against me from within my life pipes. And then to have it remove my essence like I didn‚Äôt need my blood anyway. That couldn‚Äôt be safe. There is a reason why I have the amount of blood I have. Surely there is. And having it removed is unnatural, and almost surely detrimental to my health. Such invasive medicine should be outlawed. Wishing the imaginative needle gone, I start thinking about the needle tickling me from within my vein as the surgical instrument was retired from it‚Äôs violation of my cellular integrity. In turn, I shudder.

 

There is little escape now though. It‚Äôs almost one a clock. The nurse would be here any minute. Looking around my home I realised that it was completely unpresentable. I had to clear out my livingroom at least. I started by clearing away old plates. Too many tv dinners. Some of the plates had begun sticking to each other. I put them in the kitchen and take the bin with me back to the livingroom. Old bags of snacks and drinks lay scattered about as well. While picking them up I was interrupted by the doorbell ringing. I kick the last pieces I could see under the sofa and put the trashcan on the other side of the kitchen door. Closing it. The doorbell rang again as I moved towards it. Having almost forgotten all about my fear of needles for a short minute of clean panic.

 

Sharp inhale.

 

Long exhale.

 

Simultaneously I depress my shoulders and door handle.

 

Light floods in through the door, like an army of photons breaking down a castle door. Blinking I see a silhuet come into focus.

 

‚ÄúHello mister Skinner‚Äù The voice is almost cheerful. And by the end of the sentence my vision has acclimated to the light and I can finally see my visitor clearly. If I had to describe her appearance I would say no more than 25, blonde, narrow nose, her forehead only reaching my shoulders, full lips, playfull smile like a cats, holding a small white cuboid box with a big cartoonish drop of blood on it, her knees pointing inwards. If I had to use only one word it would be: nurse. In other words. She looked the part.

 

‚ÄúOhh hey, miss.. and, your name?‚Äù She looked at me for a second, her smile dropping from her face. The cheerful voice remained.

 

‚ÄúWalker. Audrey Walker. Can I come in?‚Äù Her smile returned with a vengeance.

 

‚ÄúYes of cause.‚Äù I stepped aside letting her into me domicile. As she took the first step over the barrier of my doorstep I felt a cold run up my back. In that moment all I could think was. God she is hot. Don‚Äôt fuck this up. It had been so long since I had been within arms reach of a woman, it gave me shivers.

 

‚ÄúDo you have a comfortable place for us to sit?‚Äù The question caught my female starved mind as very sugestive. And I stumbled getting my footing back to the professional.

 

‚ÄúI can, I‚Äôll sit wherever you would want me to sit; at.‚Äù Pathetic.

 

She laughed.

 

‚ÄúWell your couch seems suuper comfy‚Äù There was a question embedded in the suggestion. A slight change in inclination at the the word ‚Äúcouch‚Äù that made it clear that I was supposed to direct her to the area. I did.

 

She almost skipped over to it. Laying her white box on the newly unburdened coffee table. She turned nimbly on the balls of her feet and bent at only her knees and hips as she sat herself gently onto my couch. I would remember where she had been seated.

 

‚ÄúAre you joining me?‚Äù Once again I felt like she was using sexual undertones for some sort of gain. But damn it if I wasn‚Äôt willing to entertain her.

 

‚ÄúYes, yes I am. Where do you want me?‚Äù I tried to act like I had meant it as flirtatious, while in fact it was just a coincidence of my nervous brain falling into her submission.

 

‚ÄúWell for now mr. skinner. I want you right here.‚Äù She padded the sofa next to her. I remembered the trash underneath it. I caught myself wishing that she wouldn‚Äôt see it.

 

I walked slowly,  unsteadily. Putting one foot in front of the other felt like a puzzle to me. How do people handle these emotions? Heart throbbing I bent over gripping the armrest. She opened up the white box and suddenly all of the sexual tension I had been engrossed in vanished. The light reflecting off the deflated plastic bag evaporated it like a puddle in summer. Now all I could think about was that empty canister, which would hold within it the liquid that now kept me alive. Some part of me given away to the dying masses.

 

‚ÄúYou afraid of needles?‚Äù She reached out for the bag while I quivered in fright.

 

‚ÄúNot really.‚Äù I lied. She lifted the bag and the attached tubes out of their container.

 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry I‚Äôll be gentle with you.‚Äù She smiled at me. Once again I thought of her tone as suggestive. But it didn‚Äôt matter. Nor did it matter how gentle she was actually able to be with me, the blood would be drained from me regardless.

 

Laying the bag on my table, she then took a small vial out from her pocket.

 

‚ÄúCan I get you to verify your information for me?‚Äù She said while looking intently at the small vial.

 

‚ÄúYes of cause, it‚Äôs \[redacted\]‚Äù

 

‚ÄúYes and you grew up in?‚Äù

 

‚Äú\[redacted\]‚Äù

 

‚ÄúPerfect, that‚Äôs the worst part over‚Äù Her smile was getting annoying. Or I was getting angry. I needed her to know how I felt, without seeming less masculine. An impossible task.

 

‚ÄúHow much blood are you taking?‚Äù An authoritative question. I think I solved that nicely.

 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only 0.85 liters, plus the 20 millilitres for the blood test.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know how much that was of my total, or if it was standard to take that much‚Ä¶ or that little?

 

‚ÄúOh that‚Äôs; just, ffine.‚Äù Damn I was back on the defensive. She was taking the alcohol swap and the small needle with the three-necked nuzzle. I could already feel my nervous sweat erupting from my skin like molten lava. The evaporation of the droplets quickly turning my perfectly adequate body temperature into shivering cold. 

Taking a small adjustable ribbon she slid it up my arm. Her nails stroking my skin every inch along it‚Äôs journey to my bicep. Retracting her hands she ripped the packaging of the alcohol swap. Revealing the small white fabric solely responsible for maintaining my genomic integrity against the microbial assailants lurking on my skin.

 

She leaned in and grabbed my forearm. Her hands where soft. I closed my eyes as soon as our skin contacted. It was involuntary. A cold wetness fell on my skin as I once again opened my eyes. She was fully focussed on that one treasonous vein of mine. Packing away the alcohol swap she quickly brought the needle to the vein. I didn‚Äôt know if it would be best to look or not.

 

‚ÄúYou are going to feel a little sting.‚Äù Her gaze fixed to my vein, not a moment of compassion for my situation.

 

‚ÄúCan you count down?‚Äù She looked at me with surprise.

 

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù Smile returned. Her gaze returned to the vein. I had to figure out if I was going to look or not.

 

‚Äú3‚Äù If I looked I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised by the sensations that would follow.

 

‚Äú2‚Äù If I looked I would watch as my body became scarred, and blood became scarcer.

 

‚Äú1‚Äù If I didn‚Äôt look I could focus on something else. I might not feel as much of it.

 

I blinked. And kept my eyes closed.

 

I felt an exponentially rising pressure on my skin. Then my cartilage gave in, it collapsed with a snap as the needle broke through my armor. When it settled within me, the vein bounced back up like a spring enclosing the foreign object. As it scraped upon the needle I felt my toes cringe. I let out a small puff of air, and opened my eyes.



 

She put the tube of the bag into the nuzzle and turned a hinge. The blood poured into it.

 

‚ÄúKeep on working this hand gently.‚Äù She said and tapped my palm.

 

I was losing consciousness. Watching the liquid streaming out. She couldn‚Äôt take this away from me. I spent all my energy remaining upright. Controlling my breathing. Not because it helps against panic or whatever. But because I didn‚Äôt want to be visibly flustered.

 

In

When I awoke it was to gentle laughter and a stroke on my arm.

 

‚ÄúHaaey mister.‚Äù I liked this smile even less. It was belittling. Degrading. How dared she look at me like that.

 

‚ÄúI think you dosed of there for a minute. Hihi.‚Äù Fuck her. What had she been doing in the meantime. Had she been going through my stuff?

 

‚ÄúGood news is that we are done! So I hope I¬¥ll get to see you again. It‚Äôs really very kindhearted of you to donate and save lives.‚Äù She grasped my forearm with her hand. A small ball of cotton was secured to my joint with tape.

 

Out of my peripheral red caught my eye. I was looking at the bag full of what was collected from me. I was trying to estimate the amount of it. Thinking about how it would look, if instead it where to be spread out over my floor. Silently comparing that with the amount of blood I had seen in horror movies. And if the character survived or not.

 

She left. I felt at home again. The sun was still shining. I threw out the trash under the couch. And updated my dating profile.

I‚Äôm looking for:

1. **Great cities** in Europe, preferably surrounded by other students 
2. **Amazing study spots**: Coffee shops, libraries, coworking spaces, or any quiet and cozy places.
3. **Practical tips**

Durng my breaks I'd like to walk, visit museums, or enjoy good food.

Have you ever studied or worked in a place you‚Äôd recommend? I‚Äôd love to hear your suggestions! üòä

Thanks in advance for your tips and ideas! üôå

I've checked that the portafilter isn't blocked and water seems to run through it fine by itself, although water does sit in it, I'm not sure if this is normal? The only thing I haven't tried is descaling it as its a brand new coffee machine so not sure if that would fix anything?

1i26tbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1i26tbh/allergy_test_shows_my_wife_is_allergic_to/,Allergy Test Shows My Wife is Allergic to Everything ,"Hi I'm just trying to get some advice for my (m36) wife's (f29) new situation. 

So around the start of December my wife had a series of allergic reactions that came out of nowhere. We're not sure what triggered them, but it went on for around 2 weeks then seemed to clear up. But she's been careful about what she's been eating. Two of the reactions happened after eating pizza, for instance. So no pizza. 

Anyway she scheduled an appointment to have an allergy test done and they started her with an inhallant test. Confirmed a long held belief that she was allergic to certain grasses and trees since she'd had a severe reaction in high school after mowing her yard that left her eyes swollen shut and all that. Pretty much full on anaphylaxis as far as I can tell (I'm not a doctor.) 

Anyway, yesterday she had another skin test done to determine what foods she may or may not be allergic to. According to the test it's everything *EXCEPT* for chicken, egg whites, egg yolk, beef, pork, buckwheat, and soybean. According to the test she's allergic to every vegetable and every fruit under the sun, specifically mushrooms and spinach.

Which I mention because the night before I made spinach and mushroom omelets and she didn't have any sort of reaction. 

So now I'm just looking for advice, mainly on how accurate these skin tests are. Because it listed things that she's never had any sort of reaction to before like chocolate and coffee and vanilla. She eats oranges and peanut butter like they're going out of style but she's never had any sort of reaction to eating them since she and I have been together. 

So yeah, I'm just looking for advice. My wife is basically thinking her life is over (not literally,) because according to this test she can't eat anything she actually enjoys. She's not much of a meat eater, for instance. 

I hope any of this makes sense. I'm just trying to find some hope for my wife. ",1,1736972601.0,AskDocs,3,1.0,False

1i26p4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/LowellMA/comments/1i26p4o/a_statement_from_the_manager_of_the_luna_theater/,A statement from the manager of The Luna Theater ,"**You‚Äôve got questions. Here are (some) answers.**

Mill No. 5 & The Luna Theater will be closing their doors forever at the end of this month.

It is with deep regret that, after a decade of serving as a cultural focal point for the City of Lowell, Mill No. 5 is shuttering. Sadly, we have to announce that we will not be reopening The Luna Theater.

Please try to understand that the past couple of months since the closure was announced have been a difficult time for us. We want to answer your questions about the future of the Mill No. 5 shops and features that you've come to rely on‚Äîbut we don‚Äôt have all the answers.

And while we truly appreciate your sympathy and concern, constantly talking about the closure and fielding the same questions over and over can be a bit overwhelming at times.

To give my staff a break, I offer a list of frequently-asked-questions (or FAQ, if you will).

1. *WHY ARE THE MILL AND THE LUNA CLOSING?*

This is a complicated question with no straightforward answer. But I'll try to take a shot at it for you. Simply speaking, the fourth and fifth floors of the Mill were donated to The Lowell Community Charter Public School, which serves 815 students in pre-kindergarten through eighth grade.

Why? The short answer is that before the COVID pandemic lockdown we were a thriving organization open seven days a week. I think we all know something changed in our society after we emerged again into the light of day. The visitor numbers, which definitely peaked for weekends and special events, just never returned to their former glory. Add to that staffing shortages, elevator breakdowns, and maintenance downtime and repair costs. Let's be honest about the fact that we were struggling.

2. *WHEN WILL THE MILL AND THE LUNA BE CLOSING?*

The last day will be Sunday, February 2nd. I think we'll be closing at 5PM. But if you come earlier, we'll be showing a special FREE movie!

3. *WILL THE LUNA BE MOVING TO A NEW LOCATION?*

As far as we are aware there are no plans for a ""Luna 2.0."" Running a tiny 80-seat left-of-independent movie theater in the 21st Century wasn't easy. Not being a multi-screen corporate megaplex meant that we often were not exactly a priority for distributors. The owner of the Luna also owned and operated the cafe Coffee & Cotton, Dows Soda Fountain, and The Overlook performance venue on the fifth floor. None of these businesses currently have any plans to stay open or relocate.

We'd appreciate it if you'd refrain from asking if we are staying open. Lately this question has been (almost) as popular as asking what the bathroom code is. (>!It's 0317, in case you need to go.!<)

4. *IS THE POPCORN MACHINE/ARCADE CABINET/SOFA/ETC FOR SALE?*

No. They'll be going with the owner. We also have no plans currently to sell our poster collection, either. So please, don't ask.

In case you ever were wondering, the popcorn machine is a Manley Aristocrat model from 1949! The proscenium (the ornate frame that surrounds the top and sides of the stage) are a replica of the one in the former Royal Theater here in Lowell, while the front doors of the theater came from the York Theater (which still stands) in Athol, Mass.

5. *WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HAVE IN STORE FOR LOWELL'S MILL NO. 5 COMMUNITY?*

A great question! In my opinion, the loss of Mill No. 5 and The Luna Theater is a net cultural loss for our community. We'd established ourselves as an independent safe space for people who represented all the colors of the rainbow of life. We provided an experience unique to Lowell and Massachusetts and it would be a shame to see the community that has grown organically around the space vanish in a puff of smoke.

You'll be relieved to hear that the proprietors of the awesome Red Antler Apothecary & Hive & Forge (up on the fifth floor currently) have risen to the challenge and are leading the way to a new non-profit venue called HIVE PUBLIC MARKET (Instagram: @HIVEPUBLICMARKET) on the other side of downtown at the former St. Jean Baptiste Church building (where Jack Kerouac was baptized!). Plans are still in the fundraising phase (go donate!) but many of your favorite shops will be following them over there!

I think this has potential to be even better (in some respects) than the current location. (For example, no sketchy elevators!) I highly suggest you look up more info online and contribute to their GoFundMe campaign as soon as you can. For individual updates about your favorite shops and their future, I suggest you check their respective Instagram pages.

6. *WHAT WILL YOU AND YOUR STAFF DO NEXT?*

This has been an extremely stressful experience for us the past two months. Some of us have worked together and been friends for years at this point. I know I am going to miss my Luna Dream Team (or Lunatics, if you prefer) terribly. Some of our staff were just hired a few days before the surprise announcement and to their credit they've stuck around despite being the crew of a sinking ship. But, more likely than not, we'll all be looking for new jobs come February. If you have any job leads, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.

We'd like to thank the people who have supported us and been our guests over the years. Our staff will miss providing you with an alternative experience to corporate commercial cinema.

Sincerely,

Edward Sears Read

Soon-to-be Former Manager of The Luna Theater

Flew to Amsterdam from South Africa for an xmas week holiday and border control (entering) was the most laxed I've experieced. He simply asked how long (7 days) and purpose (tourism) and was like ""that short?! Merry xmas"" 
Didn't ask for proof of acc, insurance or return flight. 

Exiting was weird. The dude took a while examining my passport under a loupe. 

And today I am flying to Copenhagen via Amsterdam from South Africa. The border control dude was borderline shouting at people. 
He asked for my return ticket which I duly printed.
Then asked for proof of accommodation. Also gave him proof of insurance cover. 

Then asked why am I going there? I responded going on holiday for 6 days. Visiting Copenhagen. 
He looked at my passport for a bit and then asked again.
""Why are you visiting Copenhagen?""

Response - ""Tourism, I am visiting the city. Bakeries, restaurants, coffee shops. Just a holiday.""

His colleague asked ""what are you visiting in Copenhagen?"" Right after my response. 

I stayed calm and said the exact same thing and added that I work in coffee hence why I visit coffee shops when I travel. 

Then they asked for my work contract. He looked at it. Said something in Dutch. Then stamped my visa. 

Tldr; Hope for the best but prepare for the worst kind of immigration officer. Print all your documents. Keep calm even if they are shouting at you. If your intention is genuine, no need to panic. Stay truthful. 

If you are in some dodgy dealings, thanks for making it hard for honest people. 

Also; don't take it personally. Enjoy your travels while they sit at their desk.

After uploading my resume, they hit me with: ‚ÄúPlease manually enter your work history.‚Äù

I got so frustrated with sites like Workday, SuccessFactors, Oracle etc. that I decided to automate the process. Using vanilla JavaScript, I built a¬†[browser extension](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/swift-apply-ai/ibociagipgmjbdhgpheakalnhiogjkgf)¬†that autofills job applications. It pulls info from the info that you give to the extension when you set it up and fills in all those annoying fields for you everytime.

Once I had that working, I figured I‚Äôd level it up. I added a feature that lets you tailor your resume to any job description on LinkedIn with a single click. It‚Äôs been super helpful for customizing applications without spending 20 minutes tweaking everything manually.

It's called¬†[Swift Apply AI](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/swift-apply-ai/ibociagipgmjbdhgpheakalnhiogjkgf)¬†and you can try it out here :¬†[Swift Apply AI - Microsoft Edge Addons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/swift-apply-ai/ibociagipgmjbdhgpheakalnhiogjkgf)  
It‚Äôs been a lifesaver for me during my job hunt, and I thought some of you might find it useful too.

Now, everything except the resume tailoring feature is completely free. You get autofill for job apps and a tracking tool to keep tabs on what you‚Äôve applied to. Plus, the tailored resumes are saved in the extension, so you can access them whenever you need.  
It's very reasonably priced for the value it gives you. 50 tailored ones costs you less than 2 cups of coffee at your local starbucks.  
The only reason I charge is because it costs me money to run this.

1i26mn7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Perfumes/comments/1i26mn7/affordable_perfume_recs/,Affordable perfume recs?,"I would love recommendations for perfumes that don't cost an arm and a leg. I have some idea of what I like when it comes to types of smells.

My budget is $50 per bottle. Preferably less than that, but around $50 is okay.

I would like recs for every day and for occasional wear or dates. 

I've never layered perfume and don't really know how to do that.

From what I know, I DON'T like:
-Candy-sweet smells. (Stuff like cotton candy and marshmallow. Chocolate or caramel is okay if it's not too sweet.)
-Cherry blossom.
-Soapy smells and smells too close to talcum powder.
-I don't want to smell like a man's body wash or cologne.

I DO Like: 
-smokey (like bourbon)
-light woody smells
-floral smells
-vanilla 
-Cherry
-Fruity/citrusy
-berry
-Coconut
-coffee
-tea

Even with this, I'm open minded to trying new fragrances and don't expect anyone to know 100% what I will like. I haven't explored many perfumes, these are mostly just every day scents I know I like. 

I'm wanting to expand on my perfumes and hopefully build a nice little collection of scents I like.

Some extra:
*My favorite perfume ever is Donna Born in Roma Intense, but I only wear it on occasion because of how expensive it is. I got it for dates with my husband and I'm not really looking for a dupe.
*I once had a Honeysuckle perfume I bought from etsy, and it smelled fantastic, but I got it too hot and it turned into a weird soapy smell that I couldn't stomach. I can't find it anywhere now.
*I've tried Sabrina Carpenter's Caramel Dream and I do like it, though it's not something I desire to wear often.",3,1736972104.0,Perfumes,5,1.0,False

1. Hicks - I mean everyone knows this one, rarely full, wide variety of seating and has a good sized computer lab. Located outside of PMU and Stewart.  
2. Boiler Up Bar - If you are 21+ the times most people would be studying this bar is basically dead and you get the coffee smells of the coffee shop next door. There is an alcove with Spirit bottles that is awesome to sit and read in. Located on PMU 1st floor.  
3. PMU 1st Floor, The first floor of the PMU is just good in general, it can often be full but access to the rest of the PMU facilities without having to sit in the loud cafeteria below is very nice.  
4. The Jedi Council Room - This is the best place honestly, but finding a time where it's open and devoid of a meeting can be challenging but if you land yourself here on a nice sunny spring day, or a right after a fresh snowfall can really sell it with all the good sights from the windows. Very Relaxing. Despite myth students are allowed to study here, it just needs to be open and unoccupied. I always like to leave how you get here a mystery because I find it fun to find it for yourself. Good Luck :).  
5. Dudley and Lamburtus Halls - Can be busy, but if you find a spot it's worth it due to it being new, lacks some of the drab and dark interiors of other buildings.  
6. Basement of Beering Hall. It has a newly renovated study space with a microwave, mini kitchen and some vending machines. Most of the closed study space are for grad students only but the big middle part is open to anyone.  
7. Knoy - Knoy has a number of spaces on several floors with places to sit and study, never couldn't find a place here when I was still in the polytechnic college and I still come back occasionally to study. Also has loads of computer labs you can use when not in use.  
8. Armstrong Hall - Has a surprising amount of places to sit and study and often isn't super busy, also nice wide open spaces and large windows to look out of and relax when breaks are needed.  
9. Cordova - Now you might wonder why a gym is a good place to study, but that's sort of why it's a good place, this place's study spots are hardly busy especially if you actually use your ID to enter and find tables past the check in point which do exist by the way.

My question here is whether there is a rule of thumb for how far apart screws need to be placed vertically on a stud? Some L brackets had screw holes pretty close together; my main concern is drilling in too close to the one stud screw from the original bracket. 

**ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON WHY I ASK:**

I have a floating kitchen shelf that uses a hidden bracket (two horizontal poles basically) inside of it for support. The shelf has a little too much give for my liking when putting any sort of pressure on it, like pressing down to make coffee. Unfortunately, where it is located I could only use one stud, the other side is using toggle bolts in the drywall. My plan is to add an L bracket underneath along the stud to give it more support.

Note before I start: This is my first time fermenting anything. I did it for fun and because I wanted to try carbonated coffee. The reason I‚Äôm sharing this is that I couldn‚Äôt find much information about people trying this, so now that I have, I wanted to post my experience to help others.



As the title says, I made a coffee soda using a ginger bug. I wanted to try carbonated coffee, but is'nt available where I live. (To compare, I ended up spent 50$ to ship four cans of ""La Dolce Vita"" carbonated coffee to me. After testing both, I honestly couldn‚Äôt tell much difference. Both had the same flavor and a light fizz. I personly was hoping for a stronger fizz and tought mine was week becuase of my recipy.) My version didn‚Äôt have any ginger flavor, so if you follow my recipe, yours shouldn‚Äôt either. However, it did have a slight alcohol taste in the background. I did play it safe when making this, and with a bit of research, I found that cold brew coffee should only sit at room temperature for two days to avoid issues. So that‚Äôs exactly what I did since I also wanted to minimize alcohol content, but anyways here‚Äôs the recipe:



1 Ginger bug: if you don't have one yet just follow any online recipe that's what i did.



2 brew coffee: I went with cold brew because it made the most sense to me and letting hot coffee cool down would affect that flavor. BUT i did use a snickers flavored coffee and i did that for 2 reasons. 1: it's what i had on hand. 2: i was worried about a strong ginger flavor based off what i heard from others. I used 2 cups of distilled water (chlorine can kill the yeast in the bug) and 1/2 cup of coffee. After that, i let the coffee brew in the fridge for 2 days.



3. Prep the coffee: After two days, I filtered the coffee grounds out and added four tablespoons of sugar. By the time I was done filtering the coffee, it had warmed up a bit, so I just added white sugar and shook it until it was dissolved.



4 add ginger bug: Let the coffee fully come to room temp (I made the mistake of adding the ginger bug to the coffee right from the fridge, it didn't affect it too much but i would let the coffee warm up.) Then add 60 mL of the ginger bug, ofc strain out the gigner.



5 ferment: I kept the coffee in my room for 2 days, but the longer you let it sit, the more CO2 and alcohol should form. I personally kept my room at 27c, but I made sure to burp it every day. After that was all done, I threw it in the fridge.",3,1736971905.0,fermentation,2,1.0,False

The sun hitting my skin, my hands warm preparing themselves to peal thin

My fingers like parchment paper and my throat like a desert¬†

I remember the work of bringing a gulp down and my eyes gingerly closing

But the taste isn't part of it

And that's the only thing that I remember when I think about it

I did it to impress you, an act of courage or maybe servitude

I talked to you once in class and you didn't remember until I mentioned it

A thousand years later when we first kissed

You moved your hair like we were underwater

You guided my fingertips to your shoulders under streetlights¬†

The skin on your cheek reflected the night like freckles made of stardust

And it tasted like coffee and it still does¬†

Of course you did, but I wonder if in your memory of it, the snow falls and melts on our faces

A head full of nest and I'm told that he didn't stand a chance

I always remembered a man who would prove that he was one with a flared chest and deep breath

He got into bar fights, yelled at the television, and played war in his mind

He‚Äôd give gift cards at Christmas then pour himself drinks as his face slowly flushes¬†

He‚Äôd cry to himself when he was alone¬†

He took me to a park once

He fought my dog

In the middle of the day as the sun bathed the countertops and shadowed the chaos¬†

I remember him picking me up from school until he didn't in the winter because of the ice

I remember he cared so much for us that he‚Äôd kill anyone who stood to take it

He has a daughter now but we dont see her

He adored her like every decision he made was hers

She has his eyes, blue and white like a stretched ocean under a summer sky

He loved us and I think he still does

It's slow like honey

Every waking memory trickles down and only parts make it to the mouth

I feel too old now to be worrying about how I remember a memory

The glint blinds me so I look into the shade hoping to find a reprieve in the bushes

The book closed and I admired the white and yellow ring at my knees

My aunt killed herself with a shotgun in the spring¬†

She would post sunsets with no caption

Her artwork was pretty and colorful with space cadets and long-haired women covered by branches and solar winds

Nobody cared to see it but they claimed their reasons

This was a different woman than the one I knew

Her hair spray would stick to my neck when she‚Äôd hug me

That day she left I smelled the perfume she wore creeping in from an open window

I stood tall and weak for a moment in the kitchen watching as birds fluttered from the feeder

I hadn't seen her in some time, but I heard a lot of stories about her

She could not help herself and what I remember was only a shell

She worked in the hospital

She had demons with voices that followed her

She accused the doctors

I don't know what she believed in but whatever it was I hope she's comfortable¬†

I don't pray but I think about her all the same

She was always sweet to me, she talked to me like a person and not a child

We didn't hold a funeral for her, I would‚Äôve made it if we did

For me, I dont want one either

Give me to science or throw me to the vultures

I hope she had the same sentiment¬†

She adored my brother

I tilt my drink back and forth so that the ice cubes clink like a boxing ring

An impressionist painting of curiosity

He didn't speak but did so eloquently. He was saying things we just didn't hear them.

His hair cowlicked like mine

My hair is long now and its waves and curls become light in the summers

I remember those women who would come by for speech and therapy

They talked to you carefully as I watched on the carpet¬†

You flew through the cognitive sessions like practice

I remember the expressions on all of their faces

We read books and slept in the same bed, watched movies and I knew you understood everything

We walked the yard and played ball. I never underestimated you.¬†

You were four when they found you unresponsive in bed¬†

I looked but I didn't want to

That night you found me in a dream and we watched that morning unfold from the periphery, holding hands and listening to the clouds

I felt everything from the breeze to the sun, my mother's arms around the boy on the couch watching cartoons, but I wasn't sad, you told me that everything was in its right place

I was told you were in purgatory, but I knew better than to believe what they said¬†

If there was a God he would‚Äôve had you at his hip¬†

We carried that stone of yours with Cars and John Deer all the way north

I still watch it close when I‚Äôm home¬†

I sip my drink looking over the water that reflects the deflecting red in the sun's disappearance

Slow like honey

I swallow and brace for the impact of everything

I don't know of all these remembrances what I'll all remember in the morning

I look behind me and see you resting your eyes on the sofa under arching orange skies

The first time I saw you sleeping I cried¬†

Because I‚Äôd never seen such a beautiful thing¬†

You slipped off into your dreams like a thief of masculinity, quick and unapologetic

Under the TV light and arm on my right, you swallowed up my pride for me

I remember such things as dessert because the longer they bake they burn¬†

It‚Äôs slow like honey

And if I remember enough they‚Äôll taste like my pancakes with berries and peanut butter in a swirl

I watch as your eyes flicker under the comfort of nature on a television

I remember a fortune.

I remember everything.

1i26j9n,https://www.reddit.com/r/glossier/comments/1i26j9n/i_think_black_cherry_cloud_paint_turned_me_into_a/,i think black cherry cloud paint turned me into a jane austen heroine,"i don‚Äôt know what about this drop compelled me, as the only glossier product i‚Äôve ever owned previously was a cloud paint i bought in 2020 at a discount and used until i realized it was perhaps too expired and was breaking me out.

but something about seeing the photos of the black cherry cloud paint‚Ä¶ it transfixed me. i was obsessed. i had a sephora gift card from christmas. i needed it, expeditiously and with a fervour i could not explain. i obsessively refreshed the sephora app, waiting for it to come out, certain that my precious would sell out before i could get one. i refreshed in the morning, in the middle of the day, at midnight. and then finally, i got it.

when i received mine, i pulled it from the box like i was an archaeologist handling a priceless artifact. my hands shook (or maybe that was my fourth cup of coffee ü§î) and i opened the little foil.

rookie mistake. almost immediately, a glob of cloud paint launched itself from the tube and landed on my hand. i shrieked not unlike a banshee and in a desperate attempt to get my money‚Äôs worth because i have never in my life spent this much on a blush product, i ran to the mirror to apply some.

and something happened. i looked‚Ä¶ healthy? like a‚Ä¶ cutie patootie?? like i‚Ä¶ drank water and did pilates???

there was still SO MUCH PRODUCT on my hand. in a tizzy, i dabbed it on my lips after searching ‚Äúis it safe to put cloud paint on your lips?‚Äù (i have anxiety)

it was the lip colour of my dreams. i looked like i could give kiera knightley‚Äôs lizzie bennett a run for her money with mr. darcy. i had period piece lips!! my god!!

i took a second to ask myself whether i thought i might be undergoing some sort of manic episode or a stress-induced delusion but i was actually totally okay. the cloud paint was seriously just that good.

i feel lighter now, though that may just be me replacing the six blushes and a couple lipsticks i have in my makeup bag with this one singular tube. no longer do i have to mix various cream blushes, tints, and lipsticks to try and achieve my perfect blush shade because i‚Äôve found her. and her name is black cherry cloud paint.

i wish i could deinfluence anyone who still hasn‚Äôt bought this but i can‚Äôt. in good faith, i just cannot.

buy it and you‚Äôll look like you‚Äôve been running on the wily, windy moors. you might even feel like it, too.
