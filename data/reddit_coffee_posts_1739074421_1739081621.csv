1il8bak,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1il8bak/current_university_student_starting_to_wonder_if/,Current university student starting to wonder if I made a mistake in choosing my major,"Hi, I’m going to try to make this as short as I can without rambling. Currently I’m a 4th year university student. I transferred from a cc and got excepted as a Korean culture and literature major. Now with my graduation around the corner, I’m starting to wonder if I made a mistake and it’s making me feel a bit depressed. 


Originally I didn’t plan on going to college, mainly because of my mental health. I was fighting depression and anxiety during my junior and senior years in high school, which demotivated me and kept me from wanted to continue my studies. So I decided to take a break from school. Eventually I started going back to school feeling motivated by my dream to someday go to South Korea. I wanted to go to school doing something I enjoyed and loved instead of focusing only on the money aspect. My plan was to do whatever I can to go to Korea. The best option was for me to work as an English teacher, which only really required I receive my bachelor’s in any subject. So I thought why not Korean studies? I can go to school and study something I’m interested in. And while I still have an interest in Korean culture and language, with my graduation coming up, and with me really being forced to actually face my future I’m getting cold feet.

Today I went out for coffee with a Korean acquaintance, and the conversation we had really made me start to think. She basically told me that most Koreans prefer to have connections with other Koreans. That they for the most part cannot get real close to foreigners and tend to be more closed off. And while I did notice that even in a very heterogeneous place like where I live (I live in California) Koreans do mostly stick together. I had a meetup with my former Korean language professor who is really young, and she said she has no foreign friends and she doesn’t really care to. 
I used to chalk it up to maybe they really wanted to make friends with non Korean people, but they had a difficult time because of the language barrier. I naively thought that they wanted to. According my Korean acquaintance they just don’t really care to. And if they do it’s not a true friendship. And unfortunately even foreigners in Korea said most Koreans refer to them as their “foreign friend” not just a friend. 

It got me thinking about what kind of genuine relationships I can actually make there. Especially for someone like me who is quite shy and a bit sensitive, I can’t help but start to wonder how well I will actually do in Korea. 
It’s already weighing down on me that I’ll be leaving my family. But it was something I was willing to risk because of my idealism and faith things can go well and I can experience another culture, which was my dream. 

I plan to study abroad over the summer in Korea, but now what happens if I go and don’t like it? What kind of job could I actually get in the US with a Korean literature and culture degree? Thanks to my stupid decisions I am limited to my options. 
I’ve thought about postponing graduation and maybe double majoring in maybe journalism, but can I really do that? I don’t even know if my financial aid will cover any of that. And with Trump in office I don’t even know if I will continue to get aid. I just don’t know what my future holds. I’m sitting here thinking my mom was right, I should’ve had a plan b instead of living in my dreamland thinking things will go well. Now it’s hitting me, and I don’t know if I screwed up my academic opportunities, and this might be one of my biggest mistakes yet. Is this really the end? I don’t know what to do at this point.

Just takes you further from me.”

I woke up at 5:00 AM, felt like shit and really didn’t want to go to work. At least, I was already here. I only had two hours of sleep, I would’ve had less if I didn’t shower last night for today. The next time my job offers us rooms to stay the night since we have work related early the next morning, I’m going to tell them no. I can’t sleep with those fucking mattresses. No cushioning at all to that shit. And people really pay $200 a night to stay here.

Might as well bite the bullet and have to get up a half hour earlier by staying at home because I’ll get some sleep at least. 

I would’ve slept better if I was able to smoke. I wasn’t trying to get in trouble. Maybe I shouldn’t be that reliant on carts to help me sleep either though. 

I clocked in about 20 minutes after waking up. My uncle, brother, and I were going to be working this breakfast buffet for this big dairy company. They made a big deal out of being a dairy company since they made me throw out the oat milk option in our coffee stations for 2% milk instead. I had a long shift the day before working for the same group, it went alright, but damn, these days are boring. Work isn’t supposed to be fun so that doesn’t really matter. It’s only about the money and how much of that is worth going through shit.

The breakfast went fine. I guess it didn’t help that my hands were weirdly sore. There was this one lady who came in late, I’ve never seen anybody eat scrambled eggs that fast in my life. She was eating them as if it was her first hot meal in years. How the fuck do you manage to be two hours late when you were here yesterday.

We then cleaned it all up and took everything down to set up tomorrow’s breakfast. My uncle had cut me from working it since there was no point in me being there if it’s only going to be 45 people. I’m fine with that because I’m about to be chilling with all the shifts my boss at my other job has been offering me these past few days. Getting paid much more for less work.

My brother and I soon left because we pretty much did everything that we had to do. I thought he was going to be annoyed that I left early yesterday. Me getting him some Canes did alleviate that. He can be a fucking drama queen when it comes to that shit, I don’t bitch about it to him when he does crazy shit like leaving when he pitches a fit. But he’s gonna have to owe me some shit when the time comes. 

I mainly just rested in bed. Even though I had some ice coffee at like 6 AM, I didn’t have trouble knocking out. I needed it, my back needed it too. During work, just simply sitting on a chair fucking me up because of how bad that hotel bed was. It still feels kinda messed up as I’m journaling right now.

And that doesn’t even include the issues I’ve been having with my right leg. Begins to get more restrained the more I use it some days, it gets fine after a while. But it’s never done shit like that before. Like I even bought this compression brace, which has helped, but I feel like a fucking NBA player returning from injury with that shit on. Maybe it’s time for me to go to a chiropractor, but I’m worried I’ll get one of the actual shitty ones. A massage spot would be better. I think it might’ve been due to all the weight I’ve lost (and still losing) 

Nothing else really significant happened today besides Kanye crashing out. He’s been the #1 musician I’ve listened to for 5 years now. Thats going to change now I’m just done with that man. That bullshit he was spewing on twitter, it’s indefensible. I don’t know how people could still listen to his music or support him after that. His music doesn’t hit the same at all. It doesn’t feel the same. 

It’s clear he’s not going to change. 

Just sad seeing how different he used to be when he first started out compared to how he is now. That huge ego, money, fame, untreated mental health, untreated trauma, yes men, and some fucking more. All led to him being the way he is now. He’s not someone people should look up to. 

At the same time, I’m stupid for continuing to listen to his ass after that 2022 bullshit. I remember watching that Alex Jones stream as I was waiting for a class to begin at Uni. I thought it was just a real bad manic episode. But it’s clear that it’s more than just that after lately. Especially with past stories people would say about him. I thought they were just bullshit but after those tweets, it’s just who he is. 

And if he isn’t willing to better himself, that just makes him even worse. Too big of an ego for him to realize that. Also his whole thought process on being better than others because of his wealth is just ridiculous. No one could talk some sense into him now. All those Yes men over the years caused him to be like this, shit, he pays them to be his yes men. 

I feel shitty about it all cause I fell in love with music again because of that man. I’d even go as far to say that his music saved my life. Listening to that same music now just depresses me. How the fuck can I listen to Ghost Town after all that…

1il86l3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1il86l3/should_i_move_on_from_this_crush_or_talk_to_him/,SHOULD I MOVE ON FROM THIS CRUSH OR TALK TO HIM ?!?,"This is the first Reddit post I’ve ever made, but I’m honestly just confused and tired of this consuming so much of my mental psyche. Just to give some basic information about me and him: 
I’m a trans gay man, and I’ve been out for about 2 years now. I’m not on any hormones or had any surgeries, so most people still see me as a “woman.” The guy that I have feelings for is a cis gay man who I met also around 2 years ago when we first entered college. I met him through mutual friends, so we run in the same social circle. Anyways, when I first met him, I thought he was really cute, and I was interested in him. I’m kind of socially awkward though so I didn’t really talk to him much at first. Then I learn that he really likes video games, so we start playing some games together in our college game room (it’s like an area in our student center with a bunch of PC’s and consoles). I got to know him a little bit, and that’s when I started having actual feelings for him. Long story short, I told him I had feelings for him, and at the time he was going through a situationship with a guy. I don’t know if that had anything to do with it, but he told me that he didn’t feel the same, and I understood and told him that I still wanted to be friends, but I would understand if he doesn’t. 
So yeah, we did get kinda distant after that happened. We didn’t really talk much, but we would still occasionally run into each other and end up playing some games. Flash forward to December of 2024 during Christmas break: he starts texting me because he got a game off of steam that I really love. He basically send me a text of like “I got (insert game here.” And we started talking about the game and other things because of it. This kept going throughout December until like a week into January where he stopped answering and left me on delivered. It was very stressful at the time because me and some friends from my hometown were planning to visit his area to see our friends that live up where he does (friends from college). So we go on the trip and I’m kinda scared because I don’t want to see him after he kinda ghosted me for a week, and when we get there he joins us. Literally the first thing he says to me is “omg. I just realized that I haven’t been responding to messages at all lately when (insert friend’s name here) texted me about yall arriving today.” And I was kinda pissed so I said “yeah. You haven’t. It’s been a week.” And I walked off to talk to some other friends. 
After that happened, we kept walking through their local shopping thing and I wanted to go to the coffee shop there, but the group was busy looking at other things. He and another friend said that they also wanted to go, so us three went ahead. It was weird, but normal I guess. We got our drinks and met back up with the group who then wanted to go to the cafe (of course) so we all walked back there together. I didn’t feel like going back inside cuz it was crowded so I sat at this two person table (there was like a row of them) by a big window. The view was kinda nice, and another photographer friend got some really cool photos. Well, he joined me at the table and sat across from me, and the photographer friend took a picture of us. We talked about a TV show and the game that he got over the break, and then realized that the group was walking off without us. So we followed and somehow got separated from them(?). So it was just us walking through the place. We actually did talk about him ghosting me and he apologized. This went on for a while and we were just hanging out with each other, and I even ended up riding in his car to go to a park and to dinner. In the car, he opened up about some things he was going through. We actually had a deep conversation about our life situations, and it was nice. He also only played music by my favorite artist so I was very happy. 
The same thing kinda occurred the next day, except me and my hometown group had to pick him up to take him to a place that was like an hour out. I was sitting in the back with him and another friend, and I was in the middle. Nothing much happened, just car singing. When we got to the place (a thrift store but like huge), it ended up being just us two again walking through the place. Again, we just talked and joked and explored. We stayed for like two hours before heading back, and on the drive back he fell asleep. Now he didn’t put his head on me, but his body was like slouched against mine. And all I could think was that I didn’t want to move or talk because I didn’t want to disturb him. We dropped him off and I didn’t see him anymore on the trip.
This was like a week before school got back in. And he actually asked me and a friend if we wanted to get dinner, but the other friend wasn’t back in town yet. Me and him ended up getting dinner and even headed back to my place to hang out and play video games. This continued except I’ve been going over to his place the last few times over the last couple of weeks. He asks if I want to hang out and offers to pick me up, and then we either get dinner and go or he drives me to his place. The last couple of times, we’ve just been doing homework and school stuff for like a couple hours, and then we play video games, talk, and etc. Nothing romantic or sexual has happened. This last weekend, we drank and got a little tipsy, but we were just having a silly goofy time. Anyway, I’m where I am now. I think I have feelings for him again, and I’m just confused. Only one of my friends knows what’s happening and she’s been worried and telling me that I need to stop this. I know I should probably listen to her, but I also really enjoy hanging out with him. And I would think he has feelings for me too, but there’s the fact that he rejected me last year and he doesn’t text me back a lot of the time. He’s also a really dry texter and leaves me on delivered for days. 
Then there’s the fact that I’m trans. I don’t know how he feels about trans people or dating them, but most cis gay men prefer not to because of genital preference. I’m also like preT and preTop surgery, and I probably won’t be able to access those things any time soon with the state of the world. 
I just don’t know if I should drop him, ghost him, talk to him, or just continue whatever this is. I really like him and care about him, but I also value his friendship and not jeopardizing whatever we’ve built back after our long period of not really talking.

Teacher and student father (M4a or m4f) only discord and Instagram 


I’m the father of my 7-year-old son/daughter—a brilliant but mischievous kid. Recently, I was called to the principal’s office because my child decided to rip up another student’s book. After a stern discussion with the principal, I was directed to visit the class teacher’s room for further guidance.

I knocked on her door, and a soft, sweet voice answered, “Yes, please, come in.” I stepped inside with my child, taking a seat at her desk. The moment I saw her, my attention shifted. She was wearing a traditional saree, draped elegantly, and her natural charm was impossible to ignore. Her warm smile and graceful demeanor made it difficult to focus on the reason I was there.

As she began discussing my child’s results and behavior, I found myself less interested in the report card and more captivated by her. It was as if the world slowed down. Then, almost unexpectedly, she looked at me and asked, “Would you like to meet for coffee?”

Her words caught me off guard, but I quickly replied, “Yes, please,” without hesitation.

What could she possibly want to discuss over coffee? Was it about my child—or something more? I couldn’t wait to find out.

---

FADE IN:

INT. SHABBY APARTMENT/INVESTIGATION OFFICE – NIGHT

A dim, neon-lit room cluttered with VHS tapes, dusty 13-inch CRT monitors, and old remote controls. The atmosphere is heavy with analog nostalgia—a nod to 90s noir.

Main Character 1 (ALEX) , an unassuming but curious soul, stands before a foggy mirror mounted on a scratched wall. The sound of a slow, pulsing synth track underscores the mood.

CLOSE ON – THE MIRROR

Alex exhales slowly, and his breath fogs the mirror. For a few seconds, the only thing visible is a translucent haze. He reaches out with a trembling hand and wipes it away, revealing his face—confident yet edged with subtle confusion.

ALEX (V.O.)
(dryly, with a hint of disbelief)
Sometimes, you only see the truth when you wipe away the illusions.

Alex glances at his reflection, as if expecting something different. But all seems normal—almost too normal.

CUT TO:

INT. INVESTIGATION OFFICE – CONTINUOUS

Main Character 2 (SAM)—equally amateur yet equally enthusiastic—flips through a box of old VHS tapes. The room is peppered with stacks of case files scribbled with notes and clippings.

SAM
(excited, but a bit jittery)
Check this out, Alex. I found another tape—our so-called “big clue.” It’s all here: the odd coincidences, the little moments we ignored back then.

Alex nods, still distracted by his earlier moment in front of the mirror. The two set up the CRT monitor, insert a VHS tape, and hit play. The grainy footage reveals their past—a jumble of moments that, until now, looked like ordinary life.

ON SCREEN (VHS FOOTAGE):
Alex laughing with friends, a candid moment at a party, and then—briefly—the mirror scene, where his breath fogs the surface. The moment is barely noticeable amid the static.

SAM (CONT’D)
(leaning in, puzzled)
You ever wonder why that mirror looked…off? Like it was hiding something?

Alex shrugs. They exchange a knowing glance, the first hint that something isn’t quite right.

CUT TO:

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE OFFICE – LATER

The mood darkens further as a tall, shadowy figure steps into view. It’s DEATH, leaning casually against the doorframe. His tone is laconic, irreverent—a voice reminiscent of dry humor.

DEATH
(with a wry smile)
Evening, amateurs. I see you’ve been busy re-watching your lives on loop.

Sam and Alex exchange startled looks. Neither is prepared for the sudden intrusion—nor for the fact that they are being addressed like routine coworkers.

ALEX
(nervously)
We’re just... piecing together clues. Isn’t that what we do?

Death steps forward, his presence both comforting and ominous.

DEATH
Oh, you do more than that. You’re investigating the only case you’ll ever have—your own existence. But enough chatter. Time for a little procedure.

He moves to a heavy, ancient-looking door at the back of the office. With a casual motion, Death slides a large, archaic key into the lock and turns it. The metallic click echoes ominously.

DEATH (CONT’D)
Consider this door the point of no return. From now on, you’re not just watching life pass by. You’re locked into the afterlife. And trust me, it’s not all mysterious clues and midnight coffee runs.

Sam steps forward, a mixture of indignation and panic rising.

SAM
(protesting)
Wait, what? You can’t just lock us in here! We’re not on call for... afterlife clerical work!

Death arches an eyebrow, his tone dry and dismissive.

DEATH
Clerical work? Kid, you should’ve read the fine print of your contract when you breathed your last. There’s no exit once the door’s locked.
(pauses, then with a sardonic grin)
But hey, if you ever get tired of crunching cosmic case files, you can always start your own afterlife. Franchising’s all the rage these days.

Alex and Sam exchange a look—a mixture of disbelief and dawning comprehension. The room grows colder, shadows lengthening as the reality of their situation settles in.

ALEX (V.O.)
(reflective, a trace of dark humor)
And just like that, our life became a never-ending rerun—a mystery that we’d have to solve, one forgotten clue at a time.

1il804t,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1il804t,"Ending 2024 with a Trip to Central Asia: Part 2 - Bishkek, Kyrgyztan","Hi fellow travelers! This is the continuation of my 15-day year-end trip to Central Asia. My first stop and entry point was Almaty, Kazakhstan (here’s Part 1 of my post), where I spent my first three days.

Part 2: Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan

From Almaty, Kazakhstan, you can travel to Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan by land, which is both affordable and hassle-free. You can book a Yandex taxi from your location to Sayran International Bus Station, where you can board a bus to Bishkek.

✅ Bus fare: KZT 3,300 (approx. Php 375)
✅ Travel time: ~5 hours to the border
✅ Ticket purchase: Buy directly at the station (no extra fee for luggage)

The bus stops at the Kazakh-Kyrgyz (Qorday) border, where all passengers must get off to go through immigration. At the Kyrgyz border, you’ll need to present your E-Visa, as Kyrgyzstan is not visa-free for Filipinos. The immigration process takes around 20–30 minutes.

I exchanged a small amount of Kyrgyzstani Som (KGS) at a money changer at the border and also bought a local SIM card. After clearing immigration, the same bus from Almaty waits at the border and continues to Osh Bazaar, where you can take a Yandex taxi to your hotel.

Accommodation
For Bishkek, I booked my hotel via Booking.com, as I wanted a place that offered laundry services. I stayed at Camelot Hotel, which is just a few kilometers from the city center.

Budget
Like Almaty, Bishkek is also very affordable—still cheaper than Manila. As mentioned in the first part, my total budget for the 2-week trip across Central Asia was Php 50,000 (excluding airfare, souvenirs, and train tickets), and I even had some leftover.

In Bishkek, I spent approximately Php 6,000 for tours, food, and transportation. Digital payments are widely accepted, but I also exchanged some USD to KGS, so I used both for payments.

If you’re planning to use cash, I highly recommend planning your finances carefully before withdrawing money. I had difficulty exchanging my extra KGS in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, as they don’t accept KGS at all. I still have about Php 2,000 worth of KGS, so if anyone is planning to visit Kyrgyzstan, I can sell it at market value—lol!

My Bishkek Itinerary

Day 1: Arrival in Bishkek (PM)
* Ala-Too Square
* Oak Park
* Night stroll at Erkindik Avenue
* ANT’S Coffee Shop
* Victory Square

Day 2
* Ala Archa National Park (AM)
* Osh Bazaar
* Victory Square
* State History Museum
* Opera and Ballet Theater

Day 3
* Erkindik Avenue
* Gapar Aitiev National Museum of Fine Arts
* Strolling around Bishkek
* Flight to Uzbekistan (7 PM)

Highlights and Reflections

The vibe and ambiance of Bishkek are quite different from Almaty. While Almaty is generally peaceful and organized, Bishkek feels more like a typical Asian city—traffic, crowds, and noise—which reminded me of certain parts of Manila.

Since my visit to Bishkek was during Christmas, I could still feel the holiday spirit. Families and friends gathered together, especially on Christmas Eve. The people were incredibly friendly and even made an effort to use Google Translate to communicate since most locals don’t speak English.

The highlight of my trip was visiting Ala Archa National Park, about 30 km from central Bishkek. The itinerary mainly involved trekking through snow-covered trails, and the tour cost 2,000 KGS (Php 1,400), including transportation. This was one of the most breathtaking moments of my entire trip—the scenery felt surreal. I even got teary-eyed, appreciating God’s creation. The experience made me want to explore the Himalayas in the future, as it gave off a similar vibe. The fresh air, the peaceful surroundings, and the quiet time to pray made me feel deeply connected to God.

Most of Bishkek’s tourist attractions are within walking distance, especially around the city center. One unique experience I had was watching a ballet performance for the first time. The ticket cost 1,500 KGS, and the entire experience felt straight out of a movie with strong Russian aesthetics (like in John Wick or Ballerina).

Travel Tips
☑️ Transportation & Maps
•Download YandexGo (their version of Grab). Fares are very affordable, ranging from Php 50–150 per trip.
•Since many attractions are within walking distance, Google Maps was incredibly helpful for navigating the city.

☑️ SIM Card
*I bought a local SIM card at the Qorday border for around Php 500.
*You can also buy an eSIM, but I personally prefer a physical SIM for reliability.

☑️Winter Attire
*Proper layering is essential since temperatures were around -5°C during my visit.
*My Uniqlo Heattech and puffer jacket were lifesavers!

☑️ Communication
*Since most locals don’t speak English, using Google Translate makes interactions much easier.

I’ll be sharing Part 3 of my trip soon, covering my journey to Uzbekistan—stay tuned!",20,1739080256.0,phtravel,1,1.0,False

I just discovered it last week and decided what the hell I’ll give it a shot. So I made a post a couple days ago and I got some responses.

Of course some were bots and others were real women and so I spent some time talking to them. Eventually, I was able to meet a girl who was actually in my area. 

She was definitely a good looking woman so I had my reservations about being catfished but eventually we set up a time for today and met up.

Luckily she was who she said she was and we met up at a local coffee shop. She was a bit shy since like me, it was her first time meeting someone from the sub. 

Eventually, we got comfortable enough to go back to her apartment and get down to business. It started out slow and the make out sesh got heated and I did what I was there to do.

I thought it was going to be a quick one time thing and she would just kick me out but after the fact we started talking and seemed to have clicked more than expected.

We aren’t a couple or anything yet but she was very down to keep seeing each other again and so we have another meeting set up for tomorrow and then one Friday night for Valentines Day.

 I don’t want to count my chickens yet but things are looking up. I definitely recommend for you all to post on the sub RAOMD. It only took me one post and a few days of talk to have something set up.

She’s personable. I think the main thing about Julia (and Rachel tbh) is they aren’t personable. I mean. None of us can relate to just returning shit to Amazon every day and getting $30 coffee and vegan “treats”. 

It’s just the same bullshit everyday. 

As I’ve gotten into my 20s, I reflect on a lot. But one thing that’s stood out to me recently is; if someone says “oh what did _____ do for work” or “how did ______ make money / do for a living”. I want people to be able to say something positive and worth while. 
An electrician, an interior designer, an architect, even just an idea person can make a career in fashion or whatever your passion is. 

MY POINT IS : what are her family and friends and potential kids gonna have to say about what their mom does? Nothing all day? Complain about being babied? I mean she doesn’t do anything for herself. 

washing fucking berries is the BIGGEST chore in her life. It’s fucking wild to me. When I was like 10 years old maybe that would be a daunting task to wash 3 containers of berries. 

But as an adult I mean why would you even record and post that? Like who the fuck wants to see that or cares like seriously. 

She uses the FUCK OUT OF RACHEL. 
You really think Julia could afford to Uber 70 min from the airport to her house , to the restaurant, and back home on her own dime? She doesn’t even work😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 
I promise you based on the few hundred views she would get on YouTube I doubt she’s making money. It’s just crazy to like make your friend pay for everything. It’s disgusting as fuck. 

Does she not understand or realize she’s fallen hard asf off the wagon? 
If she’s trying to get her views like she used to years ago she should stick to catering to children and teens and not adults who have a real life. At this point it’s just sad as fuck. ",4,1739079867.0,juliagilmansnark,0,1.0,False

*I don't wanna have to call you up and meet you at some coffee shop, just to find out how you've been. Lately, I been wondering...*

My thumb stops, hovering over the potential mistake. Fear washes over me and in one quick swipe, deletion of my melodramatic sentence follows. I *tsk,* it echoeing back at me in the loft. Anger pulses through my veins as I throw my blanket off, pouring another glass of wine.

*I don't know what i'm doing. Why do I even try.*

I prop myself up, deciding not to feel sorry for myself. I suck in my stomach, attemping to mask every ounce of anxiety and doubt with a puffed out chest.

Me: *I miss you.*

Me: *Won't you call me?*

Me: *Baby i'm panicked. Can I hear your voice?*

I stop scrolling, hearing the southern notes in my tone as I read. So supple and sultry, full of love, spilling with idiotic trust of his reply. *Why?* I always ask, with a death grip on my phone. I must know I deserve more, but I want *his* more. It only stings, so I push the thought away, ignoring its loud correctness.

Me: *My car broke down not far from your job. Could you give me a ride?*

Him: *I have to get down the hill after work danny has a dog show.*

Me: *Can't you just take me to the nearest triple A??*

Nothing. I click the phone off, throwing it away from me in disgust. I feel the tears stinging my waterline, but I dare not cry. Not about this. Not about him. Not *now.* I curl myself forward, pulling my knees toward me. There's no escape without scratching my heart. I want the love I put out, but no one wants it. Is endless torture my gain, Unrequited love my pain? I sniffle, cursing myself for the sprinkles that fall.

*I love you, you said you love me. Is it true?*

*Or is the deafeaning silence new to you, too. I often wonder if you can hear yourself think, or if the voids so big, your voice hid. Far away in a box, locked. That's why I like to hear you talk; for a moment, I can imagine its not.*

1il7ud9,https://www.reddit.com/r/hockeyplayers/comments/1il7ud9/our_goalie_keeps_showing_up_drunk_team_captain/,"Our goalie keeps showing up DRUNK - Team Captain has no idea, what can I do?","I’m beyond frustrated. Our beer league goalie is a disaster, and our captain has no clue. Apparently, this has been going on for years, according to some of the guys who have been on the team longer than me. He’s just a “party boy” who shows up drunk or high. Sometimes he’s surprisingly okay – or at least okay enough for beer league – and sometimes he’s a complete trainwreck. It's a total crapshoot every game.

I've been with the team for two years, but until this season, we had a separate women's locker room. The rink added more games, so now there's only one locker room per team. I just thought he was wildly inconsistent. Some games he'd be lights out, others he'd let in the softest goals imaginable. I had no idea he was showing up intoxicated all the time until we shared a locker room this year. Now it's painfully obvious.

Tonight was a perfect example. He was slurring his words, stumbling, and could barely track the puck. We lost 8-1. It's not fun. It's never really fun, because you just never know what you're going to get.

The problem is, he’s the captain’s best friend. We’ve all tried talking to him in the locker room, telling him he needs to lay off the substances before games. He just brushes it off, laughs it off, says he plays better when he's ""loose"" or some other nonsense. 

 I was there last month when he puked on a referee midway through the first period! It was disgusting.  The ref was skating by the net, and our goalie just projectile vomited all over him.  I swear, it looked like something out of a movie.  The ref was understandably furious.  He was yelling, and our goalie was just sitting there, looking dazed.  But then… then he gets up, shakes it off, and starts making some incredible saves.  He was a brick wall.  We somehow won that game.  And afterward, he just acted like nothing happened, telling everyone he was just feeling a bit under the weather and ""pushed himself too hard.""  He actually convinced some people he was just really giving it his all.  Unbelievable.
Apparently last year he even offered a referee an EDIBLE before a game!

The locker room atmosphere is toxic. Guys are furious, but nobody wants to go over the captain’s head. He’s a good guy, but he’s never around before games. He works at the rink, so he’s always there super early, usually flirting with the cute scorekeeper. By the time we trickle in, the damage is done. The goalie’s already in his altered state, the captain is nowhere to be seen, and we're stuck dealing with it.

We’ve tried hinting to the captain. Someone mentioned needing to have a team meeting about “pre-game preparations,” but he just shrugged it off. He's just never there to witness it. He sees his buddy after the game, most of the evidence is gone, and everything seems fine to him. Another time, the goalie showed up clearly wasted, couldn't even lace his skates. The captain walked in just as he was ""magically"" sobering up with a coffee the goalie had stashed in his bag. The goalie winked at me. The captain just chuckled and said, ""Rough night, huh?"" That’s it.

It’s not just the losses, although those are a big part of it. It’s the disrespect. We all pay to play, we all show up on time, we all try our best. And this guy is showing up in whatever state he’s in, making a mockery of the whole thing. It’s making me not even want to play.

I don’t know what to do. Do we go to the league? Do we try to stage some kind of intervention? Do we just quit the team? I’m open to any suggestions. This has been going on for years, apparently, and it’s beyond frustrating.

1il7tub,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1il7tub,Two birthday cakes,"
Me and my friend had birthdays within the same week so I made two cakes, one plain vanilla with orange fruit spread layer and aquafaba frosting, from Addicted to Dates recipe, and one chocolate cake with raspberry filling and chocolate ganache, from Angelica’s Kitchen cookbook recipe. They were nicknamed Death by Frosting and Death by Chocolate, respectively. I don’t care for chocolate cake myself and yet somehow I managed to make one that is chocolate af. I don’t drink coffee so chocolate really does a number on me with its caffeine content. I added pistachios on top to make it look pretty and because I love pistachios. A small chunk fell off from the side of the cake and my attempts to glue it back on with ganache didn’t work but otherwise the chocolate cake was round and tasty.

The blue cake frosting was colored with Unicorn Superfoods blue spirulina, and I thought it was nice shade of mermaid blue.

Gary, before becoming a cafe owner had a multitude of different jobs, his favorite job being a Roblox myth hunter.

""Where should I begin,"" Gary said with a soft chuckle, leaning back in his chair as the old-time radio played some classic tunes. ""Ah yes, it all started back in 2008 when these myths started appearing, enigmatic folks, I'm telling you. They always had this air of mystery to them, a story to tell, or just wanting to be outright creepy."" \*He said with an unchanging smile on his face, taking a sip from his coffee mug before continuing, putting the cup down on the table\*

""But I started the job in 2010, it was starting to grow popular as some of the young Robloxians in that era started to solve these myths for a decent amount of Robux and Tix back when Tix was still around, and I was one of those starry-eyed Robloxians who saw these enigmatic figures and wanted in on the action. It didn't help when videos came out about them, how they appeared randomly in-game, and how they gave vague clues on who they are- anyways it was February of 2010 and I just got in with a couple of other folks to solve and study this figure called ""**Ouroboros**"". Apparently, she had this t-shirt of a snake eating itself with black scales, she had long black hair and pale white skin. She only appeared in games with Japanese titles and the only reason we were able to find out about this elusive figure was because one of my buddies just stumbled upon it in their recommended games! Crazy I know!"" \*He moved his hands as he talked, gesturing to the interviewer as he spoke. **It seems like he was getting into it.**

""But anyways, back then I was a timid guy, the mystery got me hooked but I didn't have the studs to step even an inch in that forsaken place. I only got in because of other people joining me on this hunt for this girl, and oh boy I am glad that they were so patient with me, or else I wouldn't have joined in,"" He said with a hearty laugh before continuing ""The first one to join the game was a buddy of mine named ""Prim"", he had much more experience than me as he started hunting since the year it started, he was the leader of our little group. I was the second one that stepped in and once the game finished loading, I.. I was frozen in shock and amazement! The game had this dark atmosphere, snake statues everywhere, and kanji filling up the sky, there was this ambient track playing on a loop in the background which made my growing fear even worse! But after two more of my buddies, ""Lilac"" and ""Shuro"" it made things feel a bit better."" Gary soon noticed the interviewer started talking with what appeared to be their manager and Gary, being the kind of patient man that he is stopped talking, so they can finish their conversation and so that he could keep talking.",4,1739079611.0,RobloxAvatars,4,1.0,False

My fiancée suggested that she try to wait until intermission, and the woman said she didn’t wear her Depends and then added that that was a joke. She continued to talk to her friend and be disruptive, shuffling through different bags and taking out her snacks from a Ziplock, through the whole overture, and then she kept talking during the first scene.

We had good conversation over text but our first date was odd: we agreed to a coffee in an open mall, but when we got to the location, he decided that he wanted to grab food from his favourite vendor. He did ask if I wanted anything but since we agreed on coffee, I already had lunch so I declined. I went and bought my own coffee and only after I paid, he mentioned he should've paid. He started talking politics for the first part of the date and he didn't ask me any questions or make it into a conversation. I tried to change the subject but he kept on telling me about what he thinks and it was a bit too much for me. We walked around and noticed he would browse stores just to show me something he.

Despite this, I agreed to a second date thinking maybe he was nervous. When we met up, he seemed less nervous but he chose a restaurant serving food I'd already told him I don't eat. He didn't offer to go somewhere else and I sat there with no food or drink. He spent most of the time talking about moving away because everything is crumbling in our city. I finally told him I feel he sound not ready to settle, he said these all dreams of his and he probably will not be able to move.

Moving forward to this week, I got the flu and I mentioned that to him over text. Two days go by and he doesn't text to check. He pops after that with the usuall hey how are you? I say Im still going through the sickness, he proceed to suggest that he wants to see me tomorrow if I feel better. I decline politly and end the chat. Comes today, no check up text or anything..

Droning on about the past, droning on about the future. *If it meant anything to him he would call me*, I whisper under my breath, wineglass in hand. I hold my cellphone tight in the other, debating. 

*I don't wanna have to call you up and meet you at some coffee shop, just to find out how you've been. Lately, I been wondering...*

My thumb stops, hovering over the potential mistake. Fear washes over me and in one quick swipe, deletion of my melodramatic sentence follows. I *tsk,* it echoeing back at me in the loft. Anger pulses through my veins as I throw my blanket off, pouring another glass of wine. 

*I don't know what i'm doing. Why do I even try.* 

*Ding* 

Startled I jump, prompting the wineglass to follow. I watch it tumble in slow-motion, staining my fluffy off-white carpet. 

*Shit!* 

My hands shake as I hurry to cleanup the mess, rattled by the notification sound. *Is it you? I hope its you. Please be you.* 

I cleanup, and sit myself on the couch with a plop. Maybe that'll ensure its him. Maybe, if I plopped hard enough, It'll butt dial him. 

*Work starts at 7:30 sharp. Be there, or be fired.* 

I exhale a breath I didn't even realize I was holding in. Relief swells in my chest promising a new symphony of hope. *Thank god.* But soon after, saddness follows. Like always, I put myself through this stupid game wanting your love. Your touch. Your smile. Like always I end up with nothing. And like always, I try again. 

I prop myself up, deciding not to feel sorry for myself. I suck in my stomach, attemping to mask every ounce of anxiety and doubt with a puffed out chest. 

I stretch out my arms, pulling up our texts. 

Me: *I miss you.* 

Me: *Won't you call me?* 

Me: *Baby i'm panicked. Can I hear your voice?* 

I stop scrolling, hearing the southern notes in my tone as I read. So supple and sultry, full of love, spilling with idiotic trust of his reply. *Why?* I always ask, with a death grip on my phone. I must know I deserve more, but I want *his* more. It only stings, so I push the thought away, ignoring its loud correctness. 

Me: *My car broke down not far from your job. Could you give me a ride?* 

Him: *I have to get down the hill after work danny has a dog show.* 

Me: *Can't you just take me to the nearest triple A??*

Nothing. I click the phone off, throwing it away from me in disgust. I feel the tears stinging my waterline, but I dare not cry. Not about this. Not about him. Not *now.* I curl myself forward, pulling my knees toward me. There's no escape without scratching my heart. I want the love I put out, but no one wants it. Is endless torture my gain, Unrequited love my pain? I sniffle, cursing myself for the sprinkles that fall. 

*I love you, you said you love me. Is it true?* 

*Or is the deafeaning silence new to you, too. I often wonder if you can hear yourself think, or if the voids so big, your voice hid. Far away in a box, locked. That's why I like to hear you talk; for a moment, I can imagine its not.*

While the Swiss enjoy more online freedom than many countries, there are still reasons to use a Virtual Private Network (VPN). Think region locked streaming content, avoiding snooping eyes, and secure online banking. So, what are the **best VPNs for Switzerland**?

This guide cuts through the jargon and gives you the straight goods on staying safe and unlocking the internet's goodies from within (or outside) Switzerland's borders.

# Why You Need a VPN in Switzerland

Switzerland's internet laws are, for the most part, pretty chill. No widespread censorship here. But, that doesn't mean you're completely free from digital headaches. Here's the deal:

* **Geo-Restrictions are a Pain**: Wanna watch that US Netflix show only available in America? Or perhaps you miss your favorite Swiss TV channels while globetrotting? A VPN lets you bypass geo-restrictions and access content as if you were in another location.
* **Torrenting Can Be Tricky**: While downloading copyrighted stuff for personal use is *technically* legal in Switzerland (whoa!), uploading it is a big no-no. If you're using P2P, you might inadvertently be sharing files, opening yourself up to copyright nastiness. A VPN masks your IP, keeping your torrenting private.
* **Gambling Restrictions Bite**: Want to try your luck at an international online casino? The Swiss only allow access to casinos *with a Swiss license*. A VPN can ""move"" you to a different country where these restrictions don't apply (wink, wink).
* **ISPs are Watching (Kind Of)**: Even in Switzerland, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) store your data. While the exact duration may vary, this raises privacy questions. A VPN encrypts your traffic, preventing your ISP from seeing what you're up to.
* **Public WiFi Risks Abound**: Sipping coffee while catching up on emails at a local café sounds idyllic, right? But, public WiFi networks are a haven for hackers. A VPN encrypts your connection, shielding your data from prying eyes.
* **Online Banking Safety:** If there's on thing that's a bit tricky with the banks there, if the website flags you for having the wrong IP it might hold-up or trigger some compliance/fraud protocol checks when accessing a local account or tv chancel as an example. Using a vpn with the right location can by pass those restrictions.

# What Makes a Great Swiss VPN? The Must Have Features

Alright, so you're convinced you need a VPN. But with so many options, how do you choose? Here's what to look for when picking a VPN for Switzerland:

* **Lots of Servers (Especially Swiss Ones!)**: The more servers, the merrier. This gives you more options for unblocking content and ensures you get decent speeds. Having servers *within* Switzerland is essential for accessing local content when you're abroad.
* **Blazing Fast Speeds**: No one wants to watch a buffering wheel all day. Pick a VPN known for its speedy connections, so you can stream, download, and browse without lag. Look for modern protocols like WireGuard and NordLynx.
* **Ironclad Security and Privacy**: Your VPN should have strong encryption (AES 256-bit is the gold standard), a strict no-logs policy (meaning they don't track your activity), and a kill switch (which cuts your internet if the VPN connection drops).
* **Unblocking Prowess**: Not all VPNs are created equal when it comes to bypassing geo-restrictions. Choose a VPN with a proven track record of unblocking Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, and other popular streaming platforms.
* **Multi-Device Support**: You probably have more than one device. Make sure your VPN offers apps for all your gadgets (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, etc.) and allows multiple simultaneous connections.
* **User Friendly Apps**: No one wants to spend hours figuring out how to use their VPN. Look for an interface that's intuitive and easy to use, even for beginners.

# The Top VPNs for Switzerland in '25: Reviews & Recommendations

Okay, drumroll please... Based on all the info in the PDF, here's my rundown of the **best VPNs for Switzerland**. These VPNs have all been put through their paces and ace those essential features you learned about above.

# 1. NordVPN: The King of Swiss VPNs

* **Why it's great:** NordVPN is the champ, and that makes it pretty good. It offers tons of servers across the planet, solid performance and privacy, and Swiss server locations that will give you a local IP with very decent encryption with the addition to kill-switches.

In Switzerland Surfshark won't be a slouch thanks to being a really low cost for a premium service. All with tons to show, you won't really notice that you're making due for its price, especially with multiple devices for use!

# 3. ProtonVPN: For The Extra Paranoid

* **Catch**: The biggest catch will be its limit of small amount for access, however its great features and open-source has those concerned happy ontop
* **Perfect For**: Those who want the highest level of performance, privacy features, this will ensure peace, but that can only do with an additional free tier so its really meant for an additional service as something ontop of itself than another provider.

# 4. IPVanish: All you need is Privacy

4. **Surf Away**: That’s right! Now you have the location

# Free VPNs: Should You Bother?

The allure of a free VPN is strong, I get it. But, in most cases, free VPNs come with more downsides than upsides.

* **Slow Speeds and Data Caps**: Free VPNs often throttle your bandwidth and impose data limits, making streaming and downloading a nightmare.
* **Sketchy Security**: Many free VPNs use outdated encryption or, worse, actively collect and sell your data to third parties. Not so private, huh?
* **Limited Servers**: Free VPNs typically offer a small selection of servers, which can lead to overcrowding and slow connections.
* **Ads, Ads, and More Ads**: Get ready to be bombarded with annoying ads. Free VPNs need to make money somehow!

**The Verdict:** If privacy and performance are important, avoid free VPNs like the plague. A premium VPN with a money-back guarantee is a much safer and reliable option. Look to the previous parts to see this. It is far cheaper on its own that some of its features. Of all those, there may be a more robust amount that would need more premium like a Switzerland of security

However! you can work under most parts that may cover the top if things are already good enough with top three for a free of Switz.!

# Tips on Maximizing Your VPN Experience in Switzerland

* **Choose the Right Server**: For the best speeds, pick a server that’s geographically close to you, with good server in it and good server
* **Use a Kill Switch**: Make sure your kill switch is enabled. This will prevent your IP address from being exposed if your VPN connection drops out. This ensures whatever security that covers on that!
* **Explore Advanced Settings**: Many VPNs offer customization options. Dig into the settings to tweak your connection for optimal speed and security and all!

# Final Thoughts: Swiss Internet Security

The internet of Switzerland and any kind will go up!. A VPN provides that freedom and secures everything! Look for it at Switzerland as you want! Switzerland, here we go! Enjoy what’s with there on, the providers may secure!. Good hunting! And they're worth every penny of what's going

1il7p6w,https://www.reddit.com/r/spooky_stories/comments/1il7p6w/grandmas_beautiful_life_in_augenstadt/,Grandma’s Beautiful Life in Augenstadt,"Chapter 1: Playing in the Plastic Grass

I am lost. I have no words for what I have found. Due to this discovery horrifying me, I've decided that I can't process it alone. So I have chosen to share it with the world, hoping the input of others might help explain this.

Anyway, here is some background information on my predicament. My life is simple—I grew up in a small town, moved into the city, lost my parents in a horrible accident, and now I live alone in a small apartment.

Recently, I received a package. Inside was a small book, in brutal condition—muddied and bloodied. I have very little family, and there was no name on the package. So I opened the book, searching for answers. On the first page, it read:

“From Grandma, Thank you for giving me this beautiful life in Augenstadt.”

I was confused. My grandma had disappeared four years ago. She was an old woman, had memory issues, and was mostly blind—she could only read from inches away. She was not much of a fighter. But I loved her.

I had assumed she got lost in the woods by her house due to her condition and the lack of guidance she had in her life. Her husband had died when she was just a young woman, but she chose not to move on.

I felt scared. My legs were weak. I was standing alone in a dark apartment, reading a book covered in blood and dirt, sent from my presumed-dead grandma.

But, of course, I started reading.



From Grandma:

*""Thank you for giving me this beautiful life in Augenstadt. I am writing here from my cozy couch in my new home. It’s a struggle, as I have to hold this book close to my face, but I am learning to write well.

I woke up last week in a new home I’ve never seen, in a bed I’ve never laid in. I was scared, to be quite frank. But a doctor walked in. He explained to me that I got into a brutal accident after being hit by a car and that I’ve been in a coma for two years.

After I started showing signs of recovery and slowly began gaining consciousness, they moved me to this cozy little two-story house in a retirement town named Augenstadt. I’ve made friends with all the neighbors, and dear grandson, I think the mailman has a crush on me.

Things are going great. I’ve been waking up early, practicing my writing, drinking coffee. Oh, I’m just so happy.

Today was a little strange, though. I woke up, slowly went downstairs, and made a cup of coffee. My friend Sara stopped by to hand me a tray of muffins she made. I’ve never fully seen her face, but I assume it is beautiful. She’s a kind, tall woman with blonde hair.

But today, when she handed me the muffins, my hand brushed against her forearm. And I felt… hair.

I laughed a little. It was light hair, but you would think a fellow old maiden would keep her arms plucked clean. But oh well.

After she left, I went outside and took a seat on my favorite porch chair. The breeze feels the same as it does every day—it comes in small gusts of wind. I sit here every day, so I have time to analyze things like this.

The sun shines bright here. It’s a mix of pale white and orange-yellow. I can’t see the sky—it looks like a blur to me.

I wake up when the sun is up, and I fall asleep when it is up. But when I wake up in the night… I’m scared. It’s so, so dark. And silent.

There is never any wind.

But the doctor gave me sleep medication, so I fall asleep easily and stay asleep until the sun wakes me up.

But one time, I forgot to take it. And I woke up to the darkness.

Now I make sure to take my medication.

Anyway, back to what made today weird. I was walking to my mailbox when I tripped. I fell into the grass with a thud. I quickly gathered myself, and as I tried to stand up, I grabbed the grass.

It was… synthetic.

The grass felt thin, with a tarp-like texture. The dirt was small and rubbery, clumping in my hand. I was baffled at why the dirt was like this when I felt arms wrap around me and pull me up.

When I had been set on my feet, I recognized the voice that addressed me.

“Oh, Ms. Davis. You must stop falling like this,” said David, my neighbor.

He was a tall man—smart and kind. Always willing to help me when needed.

“I really didn’t intend to,” I said lightheartedly.

He hurriedly brushed the rubber dirt off my hands. He was about to say something when his phone rang.

The ringtone was a somewhat beautiful but slightly eerie opera song.

He quickly answered it and ran.

I was left alone in the blurry yard.

I slowly hurried back to the living room.

And that’s where I am now. I think I’m going to go to bed soon.

This is where I’m leaving off.

Goodnight.*


---

I’m scared.

I’m sitting in my room. It’s pitch black.

I’m hiding under my sheets with a flashlight, struggling to write this.

It’s dark. The darkness came from nowhere.

I went to the bathroom, came out… and the sun was gone.

I ran into my room, painfully hitting my hand on the wall, attempting to trail this path I have had to memorize.

The sun is gone.

It’s silent.

There is no wind outside.

I’m scared, William.

I’m scared.

Something is off with this place.

Something is unnatural.

Something is fake.

I am probably just overreacting bu—...

What’s that..?

I hear something.

There’s something in the house.

William, I can hear its breathing.

Last week before my baby turned 3 months I got a write up at work and got my hours taken away (I’m a barista at a local coffee shop). What is hard is that I can’t talk about what postpartum feels like to anyone, my manager is a man and wont even understand and nobody I have worked with has had a baby or dealt with pregnancy. Im also dealing with PPD which isn’t helping me at all, I literally feel on edge all of the time, and I’m having identity issues, I don’t feel like myself at all whatsoever. I don’t do my makeup anymore, I don’t dress up, I don’t draw or read books anymore, i’m literally just taking care of my baby and going to work at this barista job to make money, and what sucks all of my money goes to bills and rent. When I was told about the write up I was in shock and just accepted it, it was ridiculous because Im always working hard, I stock non stop and clean, do the dishes, and I clean up after my coworkers. My coworkers get high and vape in the back of the sink area but no I get a write up because what I do isn’t good enough. I just had a baby, I just went through the most traumatizing thing in my life and I get a write up and got my hours taken away as a punishment. It doesnt make sense. Ive been working at this place for over a year and doing fine but all of a sudden its not good enough? Im so close into quitting, it doesnt feel fair to me. Am I okay for feeling this way?

1il7gfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1il7gfi/just_got_divorced_and_im_struggling/,Just got divorced and I'm struggling...,"Just got divorced and I'm struggling. Sorry for the extremely long post.

I was married for 14 years to a woman (call her ""M"") and it didn't work. She lost respect for me and out of love, I could feel it so I left... I had a girlfriend (call her ""S"") who distracted me along with heavy drinking throughout that time and in retrospect I never processed the divorce. 

About a year and a half later, I met a great woman (call her ""L"") who was a bartender at a place I got lunch and a beer at once in a while. Just like I did, through her divorce she had a boyfriend and drank heavily and never processed the divorce. 

 We hit it off and my girlfriend at the time was angry and a bit crazy and I had already broken up with her once and was on the way out. So we broke up and I hooked up with a woman older than me for a month, all the while going to lunch at the place. 
Well I hit it off with L and she gave me her number. We were both divorcing. Lots in common. She had been married for 12 years or so to an abusive drunk who is a real pos, (call him ""R""). Started shit with me and wanted to fight and all that. A violent loser who smokes meth and drinks himself into a stupor about every day. Always causing drama. We both have 2 boys each by our previous marriages. L is 36, I am 47. We had so much in common and hit it off. We had so much fun together and a year and a half later, we got married. Everything seemed perfect. We went on trips all the time and had a great life together. It was like the stars aligned and everything was meant to be. I was a good step-dad and she was a good step-mom. We made so many great memories and had pictures of us all over the house.

The whole marriage to L she had to communicate with R obviously, but she was very close with his family still and always gossiping with them about him and all in his business and would go rush to help him on several occasions, including picking him up from jail. She would cut me off and say don't worry, don't be insecure which I wasn't. At her kids birthday parties he was there and I could feel the energy between them. Me and R never ended up getting physical because I thought it would be damaging for me to fight him/beat him up due to her kids. Not cool for my stepkids to see or know that. Peace is always better. I boxed for many years and stil train so I dont have anything to prove. She seemed to really hate him and would be disgusted at his behavior and drama. 

After a year of marriage, my wife said she's not happy and was thinking divorce. We talked and she could see how upset I was so she after talking with her mom, decided to give it a chance. She started going out alot, hanging out with his family more and going to concerts, going out drinking with friends,  etc which was fine with me. She is free to do what she wants. She also started sleeping on the couch and doing puzzles and generally being unapproachable. I would go to bed early and she would stay up late watching shows she knew I didn't like and getting up at 5am to do the same, texting whoever and generally avoiding me. I tried to hang out with her but she was being distant so I gave her space. I figured that's what she wants.

I have always suffered from depression and this affected her. She took it personally. I let her in and became vulnerable. She would ask me to show my feelings and communicate. I did and as a result she lost respect for me. She got resentful and bored. 

So I was in a depressed phase for a couple months and on November 1st, one week before our 2 year anniversary, she told me she doesn't love me and wanted a divorce, she's not happy. I didn't take her on dates and wasn't doing the things she told me she needed. 

We owned a house together, we made it a home and we had a great life. I thought she loved me. I was in shock. She all of a sudden was very cold and final about it all. No talking it through, refused counseling. She said she tried everything which obviously she didn't. 

She initially said she would give me a couple months to save money so I could get my own place while she can stay with friends and R's brothers house as she was friends with him and his wife... She refused to stay home with me and said it just makes it harder. 

I would try to talk to her when she came home to get ready for work or came home with her kids for a bit. Mainly she stayed away. There was no talking it through. Quickly she came off giving me months to save up for my own place and gave me until mid December to be out. She was keeping the house. I had to scramble to pack and also get my shit together. 

So she came and stayed the night on a Monday, saying she was super stressed and her back hurt and needed to sleep in bed... I offered her a massage and she said I didn't have to and didn't want to give me the wrong idea, but if I wanted to she would take it. So I did and after, she asked if it would be weird if we had sex... I figured it would be the last time so I said no it would be fine, and we did... We went to sleep holding hands. 

On Saturday morning, I woke up to see texts from both her and R separately with her saying her and R had sex and she didn't want me to hate her but wanted to be honest. He said she had been staying at his house for a month and they had sex and wanted to let me know. I didn't respond to either. I just fell apart. She said she was staying at friends houses and all the while she was at his place. He has a girlfriend and she said he was staying with her the whole time except the night they slept together. 

I was too hurt to be angry. When I was staying with my mom she had R come over to spend the night a couple times because his lease was up and she wanted to help him... She said she and him only had sex the one time. I don't believe her. She said he slept on the couch, not that it matters at this point. She brought him in to muscle me out, saying he's coming and if I don't want the drama, I better go stay at my mom's or exes. I didn't want to assault him or involve the cops, so I did. I stayed at my mom's for 2 weeks while I could get a place of my own.

I got a small depressing shitty apartment. I only had my kids on weekends which I normally have them one week on, one week off. My ex, M told me my older son told her he was worried about me and she asked why, and he said he thought I was gonna kill myself. That woke me up in a way.

I had been shaking uncontrollably especially my limbs and I was struggling at work. I couldn't stop shaking. I'm in physical therapy working with geriatrics in a skilled nursing facility. I couldn't function. I lost 30 lbs during that month. People at work including long term residents were telling me I look like shit. Word got to my boss and she pulled me into the HR office which I'm very friendly with the HR girl, and they basically told me they could see I'm struggling and I'm not fit to work like this, that I need to check myself in somewhere. I was planning suicide at the time so I agreed and the HR girl drove me to a mental health facility and I checked in. I was there 4 days. It was like a jail more than anything. After I was discharged I was on new meds but didn't feel any better. 

Me and L met at a restaurant to talk. We shared a beer and ate and I wrote my feelings on a notepad and read it to her during. I told her where I was. After, we were about to walk to our vehicles and she was standing there looking upset, so I went to hug her. She embraced me and we hugged for like 3 minutes, with her kissing me on the cheek 3 times. We both wept.

About a week later it was new years eve I decided to drink vodka and got very dark and was gonna go through with suicide. I called a close friend (call her ""K"") who she knows everything about the whole story, more than anyone else and she helped talk me down and stop drinking for the night, so I did. She told me to think about my kids and that I have plenty of people who would be devastated if I went through with it, inculding her. The next day she saw me at work and said I looked really bad and I probably need to go back to a mental health facility to check myself in, so again I went to HR and she took me to another facility. 

Again it was like jail. Really fucked up people there. I had a cellmate and there was a shower curtain for a bathroom door, I don't smoke but there were smoke breaks about every 2 or 3 hours, so I would smoke cigarettes and walk the yard. Drank black coffee all day. That's all there was to do. There was 2 therapy sessions per day and I attended all of them. Got my meds adjusted. I was there 6 days this time. I befriended a career criminal who was a fentanyl and meth dealer, as I would bum him cigarettes. He had a good heart and had so many stories of his life about dealing drugs and all his toys and guns he bought from the money and about kicking in doors and robbing people... I learned all the creative ways they had to take meth and fentanyl. It was a fascinating experience. I saw two fights while I was there, including between one of the bouncer dudes who patrolled the place and a patient who had major mental health issues. Dude got power slammed against a wall and flattened... Entertaining. Most of the people there were homeless and/or had major life problems. I looked around and decided this isn't me. I'm not one of them. I have a good job, kids and friends that love me, I have my own place and own car. It could be way worse and I should be grateful. 

I was out of pto and was discharged and let L know where I had been, told her about the almost suicide and she asked if I wanted to meet up again to catch up and talk. I responded by saying I didn't want to be friends and it was better for my mental health to not talk to her. She said ""sounds like a perfect plan, good luck"". 

I've been no contact with her since, other than when she contacted me to give me my tax mail. She gave it to my older son who works with her at her restaurant. Awkward.

Also I texted her about getting my copy of the divorce paperwork so I can get her and one of her kids off my insurance... Since it's not open enrollment I need proof of a life changing event to make changes to the policy. She has yet to contact me and said she would once she gets it in the mail. I plan to have lunch or meet her somewhere to get it and read another thing I wrote about my thoughts about how it went down, which contains no insults but I lay it out about how disgusted I am with her and that it's like a Jerry Springer episode.

Since then I've stopped drinking, as I would drink every day and have for years... I don't know how I did it but I just quit and haven't drank since early January. I've been seeing a psychiatrist for meds and a counselor weekly. I've been working on myself and staying to myself, learning to love myself and my new life, embracing my solitude. Focus on my kids. I have no desire to date or really see anyone. I hadn't been working out due to depression but last week I went to a buddy's house and talked and hit the mitts for a couple rounds and it felt good to get back to what I love- boxing. My older son is 17 and has boxed for a couple years now and goes to the same boxing gym I used to. We are hitting the mitts this weekend which we haven't done since I was in the house. I had a whole boxing ring and all kinds of bags and equipment, gloves, etc and would train anyone who came over, including my kids friends. I had to throw the ring away through a bulk trash service and it broke my heart. I've had that ring for many many years. I had to give all the gloves and bags and equipment to my kids who store it at their moms.

It's all so depressing and deflating. Very traumatic to have someone you really connected with and thought was perfect for you only to have them lose respect, lose their love for you and betray and disrespect you like she did. 

So really long story short, I went through a terrible divorce and ordeal but I'm starting to come through it by changing my destructive self talk and meditating and being sober. I've subscribed to motivational and inspirational subreddits which I read as I scroll through. I'm recovering but still struggling. I've just now got to the point where I can go grocery shopping and pay my bills and self-care like taking showers every day, as it was monumental achievements to do those things weeks ago. I'm back to work and able to function, changing my thinking to work being a safe place and a good distraction.

So for those suffering after a breakup or divorce, know that there is hope. Just work on yourself and get back to doing things you love. Learn to embrace being alone and standing on your own. Be your own man and learn to count your blessings and be grateful. It could almost always be worse.

Chosen By Dragon Kings
✨🌟On the way to escape from the Dragon Kings, I was caught and they chose me to be their sharing mate!
Chapter 1
When I was a child, my grandmother used to tell me stories of the Chosen One. At the time, I never gave them much thought. Thinking they were just that… stories. Growing up, I soon realized that they weren’t lofty fantasies and fairy tales, but memories of her past, memories of our ancestors before our world turned to shit.
When the uprising happened twelve years ago, all Fae creatures fought alongside the elves and the angels trying to right the wrongs of our ancestors from the great war, trying to restore the balance back to where it was meant to be.
My parents were among those who fought bravely. I was nine at the time. My grandmother hid me in the bunker under our house, promising to watch over me if they didn’t return.
Only when we came back up, the world had changed, and so did my life. My parents were gone. Not a single person who fought in the war survived. No Elves, no Fae, no Angels. Even the humans were mostly wiped out, including the Oracle. Her death was the biggest blow because with it, we lost not only lives, but our magic.
I was part of a dying species. There were hardly any Fae left. A few hid, but we tried our best to keep to the shadows, trying to go unnoticed. I had never met another Fae other than my grandmother, yet I refused to believe we are the only ones left.
We were on the bottom of the food chain now, next to humans. Ruled over by the Dragon Kingdom.
The Dragon Kingdom was different from any before it, and those that ruled were merciless and cruel. No one was allowed in or out without their say so.
I have never left the city, forced to hide amongst those that live here, hoping that we remain unnoticed. Because being Fae was a death sentence.
At the top of the food chain were the Dragons, then the Lycans and Vampires. We used to be next before the Elves and the Pixies, then the Mermaids. Right at the bottom were humans.
Now we were right beside them, the scavengers of the world, taking what was left after the rest discarded what they didn’t want. Fae without magic might as well have been human. We look like humans except our eyes, each unique to our bloodline. Mine were the color of amethyst, like my mother’s bloodline.
My bloodline was all but eradicated. We used to be among one of the largest Fae families, helping to rule among our kind. My bloodline was royalty, now gone, just like our ancestors, leaving only me and my grandmother.
My grandmother said our bloodline used to be among the royal Fae, that our ancestors achieved great things. Now I was the last one of our bloodline and possibly the second last Fae. Once I go, that’s it. The survival of my bloodline rests entirely upon my shoulders.
Yep, the future didn’t look great for my family, soon to be snuffed out of existence.
My twenty-first birthday was coming up. I had been dreading this day for as long as I could remember, the day when they would hunt me down and drag me to the castle. There weren’t many job opportunities for Fae, just like the humans.
Fae were now nothing but a distant memory people refuse to believe existed, so we disguise ourselves by blending in with the humans. Most humans were sold into the sex trade or into slavery, unless, of course, you were caught and proven to be Fae.
Then you only earned the right to die painfully for the sins of your ancestors. That is why no Fae exists. That is why my grandmother and I keep to the shadows, blending in with the humans, so we remain unnoticed.
Turning twenty-one was a significant day for Fae creatures. It is the day when our magic is supposed to manifest. No Fae have been found since the uprising, at least not that I know of. It’s believed when we lost the war, then the Oracle it angered the fates, and they shunned the Fae stripping us of our magic. The ancestors turned their backs on all of us.
My grandmother told me it was to try to stop the extinction of our kind, yet I believe they just gave up on all of us.
These days, Dragons and vampires summon all humans on their birthdays. Humans would line up and stand before the rulers, who would ultimately decide their fate. If you showed any magical ability, they killed you instantly, whether or not you were Fae.
In one week, they would summon me. My grandmother and I have remained hidden in the hopes I go unnoticed. My grandmother refused, point blank, to let them find me. She could not imagine me being sold off to the highest bidder.
Yet, deep down, I knew she was powerless to stop them. Sure, she had power, the only Fae on earth with ancient magic still flowing through her veins. The magic that had kept us alive. Yet her magic was slowly dwindling. It would eventually die out. Then, we would truly face our demise.
My grandmother coughs as she comes up behind me, pulling me from my thoughts. She grabs my hand, making me look at her. Her pale face holds a knowing look, like she knew what I was thinking. I never doubted her ability to read people. She often knew me better than I knew myself.
“What are you thinking, my child?” she asks, her eyes softening as she looks at me.
“Nothing grandma, but I will go get something for that cough. It has lasted too long,” I say worriedly. I can’t afford to lose her too. She was all I had left in this world. My grandmother shook her head, but I stood up, not taking no for an answer.
“Here take this,” she said, pulling her wedding band from her withered old finger, it slipped off easily, much too big for her frail finger. The ring was one of her most prized possessions, with intricate vines wrapping around the band.
“I won’t allow you to sell any more of your mother’s things for me.” I hold the gold band in my hand. It was another family heirloom that was given to her by her late husband, my pop. Passed down from his mother. I close my hand before dropping it into the pocket of my jeans.
“I will be as quick as possible, grandma. Try and stay warm,” I tell her, trying to put her mind at ease.
I grab my coat, throwing it on as I walk outside. The snow is sinking into my holey shoes, making my toes go numb.
We wanted to leave the city, but the Dragon lords refused to let anyone leave. Guards are stationed at every checkpoint, and in our opinion, it wasn’t worth the risk.
But being a Fae in the city was hard. I struggled finding work because I couldn’t remain in one place for too long; anyone looking too hard would be able to tell I was Fae. My grandmother, who was unable to use magic to disguise herself, could not work either.
So, my options were scavenging and bartering or being forced to steal.
Walking up the muddy streets, I retrieve my contact lenses and pop them in, instantly turning my eyes to a mud brown. I hate wearing them, my vision was enhanced being Fae, and I could see every line on the thin film irritating my vision.
Rounding the corner onto the next street, I glance up to see the dirty wooden sign that indicated I had arrived at the pharmacist.
The man that worked there was a nice human, and since money was scarce here, he would allow me to barter for what I needed, gold being one the hardest-to-come-by currencies yet also the most valuable.
I drop my gaze and start walking, trying to blend into the crowds of people. Making my way into the derelict store, I remove my hood, letting my black hair cascade down my back like a veil.
Victor, the store owner, looks up. A smile plays on his lips when he sees me. He always liked my grandmother. They used to be friends before everything went to shit.
“Elora dear, how is your grandmother?” he asks.
“Not good, Victor. The cough hasn’t gone away. She is getting worse,” I tell him, retrieving my grandmother’s wedding band from my pocket.
I drop it on the counter, shooting him a knowing look. He snatches it, placing it in his pocket, and nods his head before ducking out the back and bringing back a bottle of liquid. Victor knows what my grandmother is, yet he never mentions it, knowing it is a death sentence if anyone heard him speak of the Fae.
“Give her this three times a day; I haven’t got anything stronger. Herbs are becoming harder to find, especially in the winter.” I nod before grabbing the bottle and placing my hood back over my head.
“Elora stay safe out there,” he warns, following behind me, getting ready to barricade himself in before those that go bump in the night come out to play.
Bowing my head against prying eyes, I take off for home, running. When I reach the corner, I run into someone.
I mutter “Sorry” at them before I go to take off, only for them to grab my arm, ripping me in front of them. His grip on my arm is tight but also warm as I feel his heat seep into my skin through the jacket.
“Take the hood off,” a man’s deep voice commands. I try to free myself of his grip, yet he is stronger.
He yanks my hood off, revealing my black hair. I continue averting my eyes. My heart skips a beat when I hear his voice again.
“Look at me, girl,” the voice grumbles.
I shake my head, trying yet again to wriggle out of his grip. He grabs my face, forcing my eyes to look into his.
My eyes dart to his gold reptilian eyes, fear clear on my faces.
This man is Dragon!
Chapter 2
Dragons stood taller than any other supernatural creature in the city, they also had this air around them that told you they were a predator. Their godlike appearances made it blatantly obvious what they are.
However, only three Dragons resided in this city. The dragon lords ruled, and the city was their playground and they only allowed us to merely exist here.
Another strange fact about Dragons was no female dragons had been born since the war, making the Dragon lords angry, fuelling their hate for the Fae. They too were a dying species.
Although immortal, most have spent their lives alone or chose to take another male as a mate. I had seen the Dragon lords from afar, but never got close enough to actually meet one and I prayed I never would.
There are three lords and rumors circulated through the city that when they couldn’t find their mates, they chose to mate each other, hoping to keep themselves strong enough to rule over the kingdom.
Sometimes people would be forced into the castle, never to be seen again. That was particularly true for any woman to pass through those gates.
Dragons were insatiable and impulsive, usually taking a woman before killing her, it didn’t matter what species or status they held, no one survived them once they stepped through those iron gates.
That's the kind of crisis I was facing right now. I was afraid of this Dragon would take me because I didn’t follow his command.
I hear him growl lowly; it rumbles through his chest, his eyes flicker dangerously, eyes that weren’t human, his tan skin is warm even through my parka.
I barely reached the middle of his chest. His hair was dark, almost black in color but longer on top, he looked like he hadn’t shaved for a couple of days, stubble lining his face, his features were sharp, high cheekbones and nice full lips, he looked like a woman’s wet dream. Yet his aura was intimidating, his grip on me unrelenting.
“What are you?” he demands.
One thing I hated about being Fae was our inability to lie. We could beat around the bush but couldn’t answer a direct question dishonestly. I press my lips into a tight line, fighting the urge to answer as I stare wide eyed at the man.
A fight between two homeless people breaks out up the street, distracting him for a second. I don’t waste any time before ripping my parka off and sliding my arms out, escaping his clutches.
I hear a mighty roar and know he is chasing after me. I keep running, refusing to look back.
When I see houses lined up along the street, I dart through their yards, jumping fence after fence and finally losing him.
Desperate, I continue to run until I find our house, bursting through the door and slamming it shut behind me. My heart was pounding in my chest so hard I could hear its erratic rhythm. That was close, too close.
“Elora dear, is that you?” I hear my grandma say before she breaks out into a violent coughing fit. I make my way to her; she is still in the kitchen sitting at the table. She smiles softly before noticing my jacket is missing.
“What happened?” she asks breathlessly. Worry making her thin brows furrow.
“I ran into a Dragon,” I say, my voice shaking. “He chased me, but I think I lost him.”
My grandmother frowns in mild panic and starts coughing again. I race to her side, looking on helplessly as the coughing fit racks her slight frame.
“I lost the medicine grandma; it was in the jacket. I will have to try again tomorrow,” I tell her, tears welling in my eyes.
“It is okay dear, what matters is you are safe now,” she murmurs, though I can sense the fear of me nearly being caught worrying her. Her hands tremble slightly on the table as her nails tap with worry.
The night goes quickly. We were asleep when we heard the voices of people out in the street screaming. I jolt upright, paralysed with fear. Walking over to the window, I pull the curtain back and peer out, seeing men with torches, some in human form, others not.
They were ripping people into the street, going from door to door. I see a man in armour go to the house next door to us before I hear the shrill sound of a woman screaming as she is dragged into the street, her family looking on helplessly as she is dragged by her hair.
My blood runs cold hearing her begging and pleading with them as they drag her from her house. The entire street is in chaos. I run over to the couch where my grandmother is sleeping, only she too is now wide awake and looking alert having heard the cries of everyone on the street.
“Grandma get up we need to leave. They are going door to door,” I whisper, slipping my holey boots on my feet and quickly doing the laces. Slipping my contacts in, I hear more screams coming from outside and people fighting.
“Come on, grandma get up,” I tell her, pulling on her arm. She shakes her head before pulling a small knife from the coffee table drawer into her lap. She looks up at me with a sad look on her face.
“Run, Elora. I won’t allow them to know. I will only slow you down. You need to leave without me,” she whispers. I looked at her, panicked. What is she talking about?
“No grandma, come on. We need to leave now,” I tell her, trying to get her to her feet. She shakes me off and shakes her head.
“I promised to keep you safe. I can’t if you don’t go now.”
“What are you talking about, grandma? Promised who?”
“Remember the stories, Elora. You need to remember the stories. Now run.”
“No, I am not leaving without you.” I tell her, feeling tears running down my face. Before someone bangs on the door so hard, I thought it was going to smash off its hinges.
“Please grandma, we have to go.”
“I love you, Elora,” my grandma whispers before raising the knife and slashing her own throat. I scream and clutch at her neck, trying to stem the bleeding.
“Run,” she gurgles out. Just as they kicked the door in, my hands coated in her blood. Adrenaline kicks in, and I take off out the back door, through the criss-crossed streets of the city.
I can hear a soft sobbing only to realize it was coming from me as hot tears run down my cheeks at what my grandmother just did. The images forever burnt into my memory.
I clamp my hand over my mouth, trying to stop the noises I am making, my breathing erratic. My heart is pounding so hard I can hear it. Looking over the dumpster, I duck back down behind the dumpster when I hear a man call out, pointing in my direction.
“You there! Stop!” I don’t listen; instead, I take off running. I run to the end of the alleyway to find it is blocked off by a building and a brick wall making it dead-end.
Hearing someone crying behind the dumpster, I look down only to notice a little girl dressed in rags. I pull the ladder down and reach my hand down to her.
“Where is your mother?” I ask, peering down at her tear-stained face.
“They took her,” she sobs.
Without hesitating, I hoist her up so she can climb, and together we race upwards toward the roof. But not fast enough for the vampire chasing us.
A strong hand grips my ankle, ripping me back down to the ground. I fall painfully on top of a man, my head smacking the ground with a loud thud as I bite into my tongue. Another man retrieves the girl, and I hear her scream before a loud SMACK comes from him slapping her on the face.
Her dirty matted blonde hair is all I see as her head whips to the side, blood trickling from her lip and the sound of flesh on flesh echoing down the alleyway.
“Leave her, she is just a child!” I scream. The little human girl, who appears to be maybe nine years old, escapes the man and runs behind me, hiding against my back.
A tall man with black armour walks over his hair down to shoulders and a huge scar across his face, his crimson eyes reflecting oddly as he stares at us.
A Vampire.
Chapter 3
Chapter 3
“Hurry up, bring them to the castle with the rest of them,” he yells to the other men. The man who caught me grabs my hair, the roots painfully tearing from my skull as my head is yanked back.
“Move,” he screams in my face. I obey, following the Vampire man dressed in black armour. The little girl hangs onto the back of my shirt.
When we get to the main street, I find a huge line of women being herded to the castle. They shove us in the line behind more women, all sobbing as they had been ripped out of their beds in the middle of the night and torn away from their families.
When we finally walk through the high castle gates, I find the group of women all separated into rows. A man I recognize to be a Dragon standing at the front, watching everyone be dragged in and lined up. I am in one of the middle rows.
When I see his eyes dart over the crowd, I quickly duck my head down, hoping he didn’t notice me staring. Another man walks along the first line looking at each person and grips their faces looking at their eyes. He then dismisses them, and another man marches them back out the iron gates once they have been cleared and declared not to be whomever they were looking for.
I make sure to keep my head down to avoid making eye contact.
However, a deep husky voice comes above my head. “Look at me,” I can feel his eye penetrating into me.
I flinch away from the anger in his words. He grabs my hair, pulling my head back. I close my eyes breathing through the pain searing through my skull as I feel my hair being ripped out.
“I said look at me,” he growls again. I slowly raise my head to be met with the same hypnotic gold snake eyes of the man I ran into on the street. He scrutinizes my face before letting my hair go. My eyes instantly snap back to the ground.
“Remove them,” he says, his voice daring me to disobey.
“What?” I whisper, confused.
“The contact lenses; remove them now.” I shake my head in a pleading sort of way, knowing if I do, I will be killed instantly.
“Remove them or I will,” he grumbles, grabbing my arm. I whimper at his rough voice echoing into the darkness, making me shiver. I slowly lift my fingers, and one by one, I took out the contact lenses to reveal my sparkling violet eyes . He grabs my chin, forcing my eyes to meet his.
I hear everyone gasp before I hear the murmur of whispers throughout the crowd.
“Fae.”
“She is a Fae.” Everyone’s eyes on mine, which I know are glowing fluorescently into the night. Burning brightly like an amethyst beacon.
“Silence,” the man yells out to the crowd. The chatter instantly died down at his words.
“I knew I sensed a Fae when you bumped into me.” His lips were next to my ear, his cool breath sending shivers down my spine as he moves closer. He leans in inhaling my scent and I can feel his lips barely touching the skin in the crook of my neck.
“You’re coming with me,” he whispers, grabbing me and pulling me towards the old sandstone castle. It was huge, and something right out of a fairy tale, only dark and covered in snow, the vines growing along the sides looked like snakes, dying from the cold and the sandstone high walls tarnished from not being maintained properly.
I struggle, trying to free myself from his grip. He looks to one of the guards that we pass.
“Kill the rest,” he commands, and chaos ensues. All the women’s voices start screaming, echoing through the night at his words. Fear so pungent I could smell and taste it, as the guards moved closer, circling around and trapping them, and leaving them nowhere to run.
“No please, they didn’t do anything,” I begged as I fought against him. He stops and looks down at me and I cower away from his gaze, knowing I shouldn’t speak out of turn, especially to a Dragon king.
He grabs my face, making me look at him.
“Please, I will do anything you want, just don’t hurt them,” I beg. Tears roll down my face as I glance at the women behind me, begging for their lives. All staring at me, fear in their eyes as all the guards freeze waiting for his answer. His thumb rubs over my bottom lip, and a smirk forms on his lips.
“Anything?” he asks, his thumb pulling on my bottom lip softly. My eyes move back to the crowd behind him, before looking down at the little girl still clinging onto my shirt.
The fear in their eyes makes a tear slip from mine, all begging me to agree with whatever it is he wants from me.
“Yes, anything,” I whisper, feeling defeated. He smiles, and I can see all his perfectly straight pearly white teeth gleaming back at me.
I study his face. He has an evil glint in his eye, like he is looking at his prey. Nice full lips and high cheekbones with a firm jaw. He looks like the reincarnation of a god, built strong and beautiful, only I know he is the devil in disguise.
“Let them go,” he commands, raising his voice, his eyes not leaving mine. I shudder at the thought of being alone with this big brooding man. I hear the little girl sob beside me, which makes the man focus his gaze on her.
Pushing her behind me with my hand, his eyes snap back to mine, a devious smile playing on his lips.
“She is coming too,” he says, not leaving any room for argument, not that I would dare argue back. I hear everyone running out of the castle gates before he changes his mind. Before I hear the metal gates shut loudly, the steel groans as the lock slips into place.
He tugs my arm, pulling me toward the castle. Torches are lit along the path as we walk toward it. The only light coming from the lanterns next to the huge heavy double doors leading inside the castle.
He walks down a hall before leading us up some stairs. My feet make noises on the stone steps as we climb them. He pulls me to a door and opens it, swinging it open to reveal a room. A huge four-poster bed sits in the middle with black gauze hanging from the top.
He lets me go, leaving me standing in the middle of the room in front of another fireplace that is taller than me. The warmth is a welcome relief after spending hours in the cold. However, I feel more terrified than ever. He folds his arms over his bulging, muscular chest.
Another man enters the room, his skin the color of mocha, with dark onyx eyes. His chest is bare, revealing his muscular body and abs that look like they are carved from stone, a deep v-line disappearing into the waistband of his pants.
He smiles when he walks in, noticing me. I can tell he isn’t a Dragon but Lycan, which leaves me confused. Only the Dragon Kings live in the castle with their slaves, so why was this man standing beside a Dragon?
“You found her,” says the Lycan; his voice is silky and deep with a slight accent I do not recognize. He smiles, revealing his sharp teeth. As his eyes look me up and down.
I take a step back, feeling my heart thumping faster in my chest. He steps forward, crossing his arms across his chest. Both of them are standing over me.
“Strip,” says the Dragon King. I shake my head, not wanting to remove my clothes in front of their watchful, lust-filled eyes.
Chapter 4
“I said strip,” he repeats, raising an eyebrow at me, daring me to disobey.
I struggle to remove my shirt, trying to cover my bare chest by turning away from him. The girl beside me starts to remove her clothes as well.
“Not you, child. I don’t want to see you naked; you’re only here to make sure she obeys orders,” he says, making me relieved as she pulls her dress strap back up.
I remove my pants, leaving me only in my panties. Using my hands, I cover my breasts before turning around to face them.
The Lycan man steps forward, he licks his lips approvingly making me flinch. “Remove them,” he says looking down at my panties.
“Please,” I beg, not wanting to remove them.
“Remove them or I kill the child,” he says tauntingly. I look at the little girl who darted behind me at his words. I feel my cheeks burn with embarrassment.
This was so degrading and humiliating.
I pull my panties down before placing one hand over my breasts and the other trying to cover my lady parts. Both men step forward and I step back, nearly tripping over the girl behind me.
The Lycan man grabs my wrist, pulling my arm away from my chest, my ample breasts on display for them. I feel a tear run down my cheek as the other man removes my hand from my sensitive parts.
“Why are you crying? You have nothing to be embarrassed about,” says the Dragon. How didn’t they understand how degrading this is? No one should have to be put through this humiliation. I had never been naked in front of anyone besides my grandmother.
“Open your legs,” he growls, stepping closer. The Lycan man peers around me.
“Close your eyes little one,” he whispers to the small girl, and I feel a sob leave my lips. When the girl does as she is told, he stands upright.
He taps my foot with his, forcing my legs apart. His fingers move to my slit before he shoves his finger inside me quickly before removing it. I cry out at the sudden intrusion.
“A virgin like I thought,” he murmurs. I watch horrified as he sucks the finger into his mouth and moans loudly.
“You made me strip to see if I was a virgin? What, asking was too hard?” I ask but instantly regret it as they both step closer.
“You can put your clothes back on,” he says. The Dragon bent down and picked up my shoes. He looks at them before tossing them in the fireplace. I quickly get dressed.
“Follow us, we will take you to your chambers,” the Lycan man says. We follow silently. The Lycan leads the way while the Dragon remains behind us. I can feel his eyes boring into my back, feel the little girl’s arms grip my hips tightly.
We stop outside a door on the bottom floor, he opens the door and reveals a small room with a single bed and small fireplace.
I watch mesmerised as the Dragon man walks in and over to the fireplace, he takes a breath in then blows it out of his mouth like he's blowing a kiss. Yet I can feel the heat in the air rising rapidly as the logs start burning catching alight. He turns and winks at me.
I notice off to the side is a bathroom with a shower and toilet. I don’t move though, too scared by the men standing in front of me, I don’t want to risk angering them.
“You will stay here for now until Silas comes back and verifies you are who we think you are,” says the Lycan man, his eyes burning oddly mirroring the flames coming from the fireplace.
“If you need anything knock on the door, someone will hear you. My name is Matitus, this is Dragus,” says the man I recognize to be a Dragon. I store their names to memory, hoping I never have to utter them.
They then walk out, closing the door behind them. The little girl tugs at my shirt making me look down at her.
“Are they going to kill us?” she asks, concerned. Now that they are gone, I can really look at her. The poor girl is underweight, not that that is something unheard of in the city, starvation being the main killer.
“I don’t think so, well I don’t think they will kill you anyway,” I tell her. Suddenly, there is a knock on the door, and an old woman who I believe is a human walks in with her head down carrying towels and a pile of clothes. Yet something seemed off about her, I just couldn’t put my finger on why I felt that way.
“For you,” she mutters, her eyes never peering up. She thrusts them forward again and I grab them from her before she hurriedly walks back out. I can sense her fear, like she was told not to talk to linger too long.
It would also make sense why she didn’t look up and make eye contact. She then shuts the door and I hear the jingle of keys and I know she locked it. I place the clothes on the bed along with the towels.
“What is your name?” I ask the little girl who comes and stands beside me. “Lilith” she whispers, looking at the pile.
“My name is Elora,” I tell her.
“Elora?” she repeats, trying out my name and making me smile. I dig through the clothes and take Lilith to the shower.
After that, we sit in front of the fire for a while and eventually fall asleep.
I am jolted awake when I hear the door swing open, creaking loudly. Matitus, one of the Dragon Kings, is standing in the doorway. I sit up, groggy before recognition hits me and I become anxious.
Dropping my gaze to the floor. My long black hair falling to my sides creating a veil. I see his boots come into my line of vision. He then kneels in front of me and grips my chin, bringing my gaze to meet his own.
“Why aren’t you sleeping on the bed?” he asks curiously.
“We fell asleep,” I tell him. I watch as he cocked his head to the side examining my face carefully before he lets go of my chin. I see Dragus walk in behind him carrying a tray with what smells like chicken soup. He sets the tray on the desk.
“Get on the bed,” Dragus says, making me glance at him. I feel sick suddenly, my blood running cold at his words. He seems to notice what he said before putting his hands up in mock surrender.
“Not in that way, take the girl with you,” he says, looking down at Lilith laying on the floor. I place my hand on her back, shaking her softly. Her eyes open before she jolts upright leaning against me in fear as she tries to get as far away from them as possible. I stand up to suddenly feel the cut on my back reopen and tear.
I grimace, feeling warm blood running down my spine, but I ignore it. Instead picking up Lilith and placing her so she is sitting on the edge of the bed.
I go to sit beside her, when I feel hot fingers move across my shoulder brushing my hair out of the way before lightly tracing the mark running from my left shoulder down to my right hip. I flinch slightly as it stings. I can feel the singlet sticking to the blood as his fingers run over it.
“Silas won’t like that” I hear Dragus mutter as I sit next to Lilith on the bed. Dragus then brings the tray over, sitting it between us both. Lilith looks at me unsure and I nod my head telling her it’s okay.
She must be starving, and when she finishes her piece of bread, I give her mine before turning to look at the two men standing in the room. They are both still watching me with indecipherable expressions on their faces.
“What is your name?” Matitus asks. Instead of answering I fight the urge and ask a question of my own, trying to avoid giving them my name. I know if they ask again, I won’t be able to help but answer them.
“What do you want with me?” They seem taken aback by my question and I have a feeling no one who has stepped in this castle has ever spoken out of line, let alone asked them a question as to their intentions.
“Your name?” Matitus asks his tone telling me to answer or else. I shiver as the urge to answer honestly takes over; I try to fight against it, sweat beading on my neck. Trying to ignore a direct question is painful to a Fae, telling a lie is almost impossible. One of the things I hate about being Fae. Matitus steps closer his hand cupping my cheek.
“Fae can’t lie or help but to answer. Why are you fighting against answering me?”
I shake my head and his fingers stroke my cheek softly, I grit my teeth trying to fight the urge to answer. “Elora” I stammer out breathlessly.
“Good girl,” he says, letting go of my face and stepping back.
“Why didn’t you want to answer?” he asks, cocking his head to the side. I see Dragus also watching me intently, his face holding some emotion, I don’t recognize. Was it awe? Wonder? I don’t know but it made me uncomfortable. I grit my teeth at his question not wanting to answer, but I know the words will come out anyway.
“Elora Aziza.” My words spew out of me in a rush.
“You’re from a royal bloodline?” Matitus steps back, recognition shining in his eyes, and he looks to Dragus.
Chapter 5
Chapter 5
I nod my head knowing it is useless trying to fight the urges to answer.
Aziza was a known name amongst the Fae, they are direct descendants of the Royal Fae. My grandmother told me the chosen one would be born of one of the three royal bloodlines. Aziza, Zana, and Helcate.
That was all the Oracle knew, apparently. She didn’t know which generation but that they would be of Royal Fae blood and be the Fae’s redemption.
Dragus steps forward. “I haven’t heard that name in decades,” he says, kneeling in front of me.
“Eat little one, I mean neither of you any harm,” he says turning to Lilith who had stopped eating and listened intently to their questions. She resumes eating and I rub her cheek assuredly.
“Silas will want to know for sure,” Dragus says, looking up at Matitus. Matitus looked a little worried by his words, his lips pursing and his brows furrowed while his eyes flickered dangerously making my heart beat a little faster. He nodded once before glancing at me with what appeared to be worry in his eyes.
“Why am I here?” I repeat daringly. They don’t seem bothered by my questions, but I also know that no one would dare question them, they were known for being merciless killers.
“All will be revealed when Silas returns, eat and rest for now. Abigail will be by later in the morning with some chores.”
I nod, glad that they were finally leaving. I watch as they both leave and close the door, I hear lock clicking in place and I finally let out the breath I hadn’t realized I was holding before I turned to Lilith. Her bowl was empty, so I pushed mine towards her.
“You have it,” I tell her. She was terribly skinny, and she needed it more than I did. Lilith thanked me before quickly gobbling my soup down.
When she finished, I place the tray on the desk before pulling the blankets and sheets back on the bed. And climbing in, Lilith curls up beside me and I wrap an arm over her protectively. We both drift off once again.
The next morning, I was awakened by someone opening the door. A woman stands in the doorway. She looks to be around my age, but her skin is chafed like she spent a lot of time outdoors in the cold. Her blue eyes look at mine with curiosity before turning away.
“I’m Abigail, follow me please,” she says, looking at me before noticing Lilith who is also awake and alert to the newcomer. We quickly sit up and walk to the door.
Peering out the door I notice Abigail was waiting at the end of the hall. She waves us to follow, which we do obligingly. She walks us to a large kitchen area where people are busy preparing food and cleaning dishes.
They look up when we enter, their eyes darting away before snapping back to mine. I see the woman in the middle nudge her friend and her brown eyes dart to mine widening, a huge grin lighting up her face. She has freckles and red hair that looks wild and untameable. “A Fae,” she whispers.
At her words, everyone in the room stops to look at Lilith and I. To which, Abigail clears her throat before speaking, her tone harsh.
“Yes, the girl is a Fae, now get back to work and stop gawking,” she says, dismissing them as they hurriedly resume their tasks.
Abigail hands both of us an apple before telling us to follow. We eat our apples while following behind her as she stops at the front of a huge cupboard in the hall. Opening the doors, I can tell it was a cleaning cupboard, with various chemicals on the shelves and mops and brooms along with a cleaning cart.
“You will both be cleaning the library at the front of the castle, when you're done with that come and see me for more work” she tells me, pushing a cart with cleaning supplies toward me and pointing us in the direction of the library.
I walk down the stone corridors towards the front of the castle, stopping when we finally find the room I noticed yesterday. Pushing the cart to the side, I grab out a cloth and some polish, as I hand a duster to Lilith and tell her to dust the blinds. I started the bookshelves and I can’t help but notice most of the books were diaries and books on the different sorts of creatures roaming the earth.
I continue dusting the shelves before coming to the last one, where I find the entire bookshelf is full of books on Fae history.
Most books on the origins of our people and our magic were destroyed after the war. Yet, there I stood, amazed at how many books they had.
My grandmother had one book on our history which we always kept hidden but here, there were hundreds. I let my fingers skim over the leather-bound books that held the stories of my ancestors, when I hear someone clear their throat.
Turning around I see Matitus standing behind me, making me jump, my backside brushing up against the bookshelf. He is staring at the book my fingers were touching. His eyes darken as they move back to mine which makes my heart rate pick up and a chill crawls up my spine making me fight the urge to shiver under his deadly gaze.
“What were you doing?” he asks. I wanted to shrink under his hardened gaze.
“I was just looking, I didn’t mean to do anything,” I tell him, my heart skipping a beat.
He nods,“If you want to read that you should also read this,” he says, holding another book out toward me as he steps in the room. I take the book from him and look at it. It’s a book on Dragons and mates. I look up at him.
“Read them. I know Fae have their own stories of the past, but what if they aren’t correct? What if your ancestors lied?” he says.
“Fae can’t lie,” I whisper, not understanding what he means.
“They can and did long ago, your kind blames the Dragons for the wars and the blood spilled, yet what they took from us far outweighs anything we could have ever done to any of you,” he tells me, and I feel anger build up at his words bursting out of me.
“What have you taken from us? You killed my kind off,” I tell him incredulously. The nerve he has saying what we did was worse, when they killed every one of my kind.
“Your kind aren’t the only ones forced into extinction, Elora; my kind is nearly extinct as well because of what they did.”
“And what is that?” I dare to ask, not liking the way he talks about Fae.
“Read the books and you will find out,” he says before walking out and shutting the door behind him.
I stare at the closed door, when I see that he isn’t going to return, I relax slightly. Picking up the book on Fae history, I sit back on the bed and start reading. I can’t remember the last time I actually read a book. Being constantly on the move meant I didn’t get much time to read and with moving, books would mean more things to carry.
After a few hours of reading, my back aches from being slumped over. The book was pretty much the same as what my grandmother had already told me. How the war started after a Dragon killed one of the royal Fae and our kind sought out revenge.
If only they had known this world we currently live in would result from that war, maybe they wouldn’t have sought revenge. I noticed halfway through that there were pages torn from the middle.
Sitting up, I make my way into the bathroom. I grab the towel that was hanging on the back of the chair drying, ",1,1739078038.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

Chosen By Dragon Kings
✨🌟On the way to escape from the Dragon Kings, I was caught and they chose me to be their sharing mate!
Chapter 1
When I was a child, my grandmother used to tell me stories of the Chosen One. At the time, I never gave them much thought. Thinking they were just that… stories. Growing up, I soon realized that they weren’t lofty fantasies and fairy tales, but memories of her past, memories of our ancestors before our world turned to shit.
When the uprising happened twelve years ago, all Fae creatures fought alongside the elves and the angels trying to right the wrongs of our ancestors from the great war, trying to restore the balance back to where it was meant to be.
My parents were among those who fought bravely. I was nine at the time. My grandmother hid me in the bunker under our house, promising to watch over me if they didn’t return.
Only when we came back up, the world had changed, and so did my life. My parents were gone. Not a single person who fought in the war survived. No Elves, no Fae, no Angels. Even the humans were mostly wiped out, including the Oracle. Her death was the biggest blow because with it, we lost not only lives, but our magic.
I was part of a dying species. There were hardly any Fae left. A few hid, but we tried our best to keep to the shadows, trying to go unnoticed. I had never met another Fae other than my grandmother, yet I refused to believe we are the only ones left.
We were on the bottom of the food chain now, next to humans. Ruled over by the Dragon Kingdom.
The Dragon Kingdom was different from any before it, and those that ruled were merciless and cruel. No one was allowed in or out without their say so.
I have never left the city, forced to hide amongst those that live here, hoping that we remain unnoticed. Because being Fae was a death sentence.
At the top of the food chain were the Dragons, then the Lycans and Vampires. We used to be next before the Elves and the Pixies, then the Mermaids. Right at the bottom were humans.
Now we were right beside them, the scavengers of the world, taking what was left after the rest discarded what they didn’t want. Fae without magic might as well have been human. We look like humans except our eyes, each unique to our bloodline. Mine were the color of amethyst, like my mother’s bloodline.
My bloodline was all but eradicated. We used to be among one of the largest Fae families, helping to rule among our kind. My bloodline was royalty, now gone, just like our ancestors, leaving only me and my grandmother.
My grandmother said our bloodline used to be among the royal Fae, that our ancestors achieved great things. Now I was the last one of our bloodline and possibly the second last Fae. Once I go, that’s it. The survival of my bloodline rests entirely upon my shoulders.
Yep, the future didn’t look great for my family, soon to be snuffed out of existence.
My twenty-first birthday was coming up. I had been dreading this day for as long as I could remember, the day when they would hunt me down and drag me to the castle. There weren’t many job opportunities for Fae, just like the humans.
Fae were now nothing but a distant memory people refuse to believe existed, so we disguise ourselves by blending in with the humans. Most humans were sold into the sex trade or into slavery, unless, of course, you were caught and proven to be Fae.
Then you only earned the right to die painfully for the sins of your ancestors. That is why no Fae exists. That is why my grandmother and I keep to the shadows, blending in with the humans, so we remain unnoticed.
Turning twenty-one was a significant day for Fae creatures. It is the day when our magic is supposed to manifest. No Fae have been found since the uprising, at least not that I know of. It’s believed when we lost the war, then the Oracle it angered the fates, and they shunned the Fae stripping us of our magic. The ancestors turned their backs on all of us.
My grandmother told me it was to try to stop the extinction of our kind, yet I believe they just gave up on all of us.
These days, Dragons and vampires summon all humans on their birthdays. Humans would line up and stand before the rulers, who would ultimately decide their fate. If you showed any magical ability, they killed you instantly, whether or not you were Fae.
In one week, they would summon me. My grandmother and I have remained hidden in the hopes I go unnoticed. My grandmother refused, point blank, to let them find me. She could not imagine me being sold off to the highest bidder.
Yet, deep down, I knew she was powerless to stop them. Sure, she had power, the only Fae on earth with ancient magic still flowing through her veins. The magic that had kept us alive. Yet her magic was slowly dwindling. It would eventually die out. Then, we would truly face our demise.
My grandmother coughs as she comes up behind me, pulling me from my thoughts. She grabs my hand, making me look at her. Her pale face holds a knowing look, like she knew what I was thinking. I never doubted her ability to read people. She often knew me better than I knew myself.
“What are you thinking, my child?” she asks, her eyes softening as she looks at me.
“Nothing grandma, but I will go get something for that cough. It has lasted too long,” I say worriedly. I can’t afford to lose her too. She was all I had left in this world. My grandmother shook her head, but I stood up, not taking no for an answer.
“Here take this,” she said, pulling her wedding band from her withered old finger, it slipped off easily, much too big for her frail finger. The ring was one of her most prized possessions, with intricate vines wrapping around the band.
“I won’t allow you to sell any more of your mother’s things for me.” I hold the gold band in my hand. It was another family heirloom that was given to her by her late husband, my pop. Passed down from his mother. I close my hand before dropping it into the pocket of my jeans.
“I will be as quick as possible, grandma. Try and stay warm,” I tell her, trying to put her mind at ease.
I grab my coat, throwing it on as I walk outside. The snow is sinking into my holey shoes, making my toes go numb.
We wanted to leave the city, but the Dragon lords refused to let anyone leave. Guards are stationed at every checkpoint, and in our opinion, it wasn’t worth the risk.
But being a Fae in the city was hard. I struggled finding work because I couldn’t remain in one place for too long; anyone looking too hard would be able to tell I was Fae. My grandmother, who was unable to use magic to disguise herself, could not work either.
So, my options were scavenging and bartering or being forced to steal.
Walking up the muddy streets, I retrieve my contact lenses and pop them in, instantly turning my eyes to a mud brown. I hate wearing them, my vision was enhanced being Fae, and I could see every line on the thin film irritating my vision.
Rounding the corner onto the next street, I glance up to see the dirty wooden sign that indicated I had arrived at the pharmacist.
The man that worked there was a nice human, and since money was scarce here, he would allow me to barter for what I needed, gold being one the hardest-to-come-by currencies yet also the most valuable.
I drop my gaze and start walking, trying to blend into the crowds of people. Making my way into the derelict store, I remove my hood, letting my black hair cascade down my back like a veil.
Victor, the store owner, looks up. A smile plays on his lips when he sees me. He always liked my grandmother. They used to be friends before everything went to shit.
“Elora dear, how is your grandmother?” he asks.
“Not good, Victor. The cough hasn’t gone away. She is getting worse,” I tell him, retrieving my grandmother’s wedding band from my pocket.
I drop it on the counter, shooting him a knowing look. He snatches it, placing it in his pocket, and nods his head before ducking out the back and bringing back a bottle of liquid. Victor knows what my grandmother is, yet he never mentions it, knowing it is a death sentence if anyone heard him speak of the Fae.
“Give her this three times a day; I haven’t got anything stronger. Herbs are becoming harder to find, especially in the winter.” I nod before grabbing the bottle and placing my hood back over my head.
“Elora stay safe out there,” he warns, following behind me, getting ready to barricade himself in before those that go bump in the night come out to play.
Bowing my head against prying eyes, I take off for home, running. When I reach the corner, I run into someone.
I mutter “Sorry” at them before I go to take off, only for them to grab my arm, ripping me in front of them. His grip on my arm is tight but also warm as I feel his heat seep into my skin through the jacket.
“Take the hood off,” a man’s deep voice commands. I try to free myself of his grip, yet he is stronger.
He yanks my hood off, revealing my black hair. I continue averting my eyes. My heart skips a beat when I hear his voice again.
“Look at me, girl,” the voice grumbles.
I shake my head, trying yet again to wriggle out of his grip. He grabs my face, forcing my eyes to look into his.
My eyes dart to his gold reptilian eyes, fear clear on my faces.
This man is Dragon!
Chapter 2
Dragons stood taller than any other supernatural creature in the city, they also had this air around them that told you they were a predator. Their godlike appearances made it blatantly obvious what they are.
However, only three Dragons resided in this city. The dragon lords ruled, and the city was their playground and they only allowed us to merely exist here.
Another strange fact about Dragons was no female dragons had been born since the war, making the Dragon lords angry, fuelling their hate for the Fae. They too were a dying species.
Although immortal, most have spent their lives alone or chose to take another male as a mate. I had seen the Dragon lords from afar, but never got close enough to actually meet one and I prayed I never would.
There are three lords and rumors circulated through the city that when they couldn’t find their mates, they chose to mate each other, hoping to keep themselves strong enough to rule over the kingdom.
Sometimes people would be forced into the castle, never to be seen again. That was particularly true for any woman to pass through those gates.
Dragons were insatiable and impulsive, usually taking a woman before killing her, it didn’t matter what species or status they held, no one survived them once they stepped through those iron gates.
That's the kind of crisis I was facing right now. I was afraid of this Dragon would take me because I didn’t follow his command.
I hear him growl lowly; it rumbles through his chest, his eyes flicker dangerously, eyes that weren’t human, his tan skin is warm even through my parka.
I barely reached the middle of his chest. His hair was dark, almost black in color but longer on top, he looked like he hadn’t shaved for a couple of days, stubble lining his face, his features were sharp, high cheekbones and nice full lips, he looked like a woman’s wet dream. Yet his aura was intimidating, his grip on me unrelenting.
“What are you?” he demands.
One thing I hated about being Fae was our inability to lie. We could beat around the bush but couldn’t answer a direct question dishonestly. I press my lips into a tight line, fighting the urge to answer as I stare wide eyed at the man.
A fight between two homeless people breaks out up the street, distracting him for a second. I don’t waste any time before ripping my parka off and sliding my arms out, escaping his clutches.
I hear a mighty roar and know he is chasing after me. I keep running, refusing to look back.
When I see houses lined up along the street, I dart through their yards, jumping fence after fence and finally losing him.
Desperate, I continue to run until I find our house, bursting through the door and slamming it shut behind me. My heart was pounding in my chest so hard I could hear its erratic rhythm. That was close, too close.
“Elora dear, is that you?” I hear my grandma say before she breaks out into a violent coughing fit. I make my way to her; she is still in the kitchen sitting at the table. She smiles softly before noticing my jacket is missing.
“What happened?” she asks breathlessly. Worry making her thin brows furrow.
“I ran into a Dragon,” I say, my voice shaking. “He chased me, but I think I lost him.”
My grandmother frowns in mild panic and starts coughing again. I race to her side, looking on helplessly as the coughing fit racks her slight frame.
“I lost the medicine grandma; it was in the jacket. I will have to try again tomorrow,” I tell her, tears welling in my eyes.
“It is okay dear, what matters is you are safe now,” she murmurs, though I can sense the fear of me nearly being caught worrying her. Her hands tremble slightly on the table as her nails tap with worry.
The night goes quickly. We were asleep when we heard the voices of people out in the street screaming. I jolt upright, paralysed with fear. Walking over to the window, I pull the curtain back and peer out, seeing men with torches, some in human form, others not.
They were ripping people into the street, going from door to door. I see a man in armour go to the house next door to us before I hear the shrill sound of a woman screaming as she is dragged into the street, her family looking on helplessly as she is dragged by her hair.
My blood runs cold hearing her begging and pleading with them as they drag her from her house. The entire street is in chaos. I run over to the couch where my grandmother is sleeping, only she too is now wide awake and looking alert having heard the cries of everyone on the street.
“Grandma get up we need to leave. They are going door to door,” I whisper, slipping my holey boots on my feet and quickly doing the laces. Slipping my contacts in, I hear more screams coming from outside and people fighting.
“Come on, grandma get up,” I tell her, pulling on her arm. She shakes her head before pulling a small knife from the coffee table drawer into her lap. She looks up at me with a sad look on her face.
“Run, Elora. I won’t allow them to know. I will only slow you down. You need to leave without me,” she whispers. I looked at her, panicked. What is she talking about?
“No grandma, come on. We need to leave now,” I tell her, trying to get her to her feet. She shakes me off and shakes her head.
“I promised to keep you safe. I can’t if you don’t go now.”
“What are you talking about, grandma? Promised who?”
“Remember the stories, Elora. You need to remember the stories. Now run.”
“No, I am not leaving without you.” I tell her, feeling tears running down my face. Before someone bangs on the door so hard, I thought it was going to smash off its hinges.
“Please grandma, we have to go.”
“I love you, Elora,” my grandma whispers before raising the knife and slashing her own throat. I scream and clutch at her neck, trying to stem the bleeding.
“Run,” she gurgles out. Just as they kicked the door in, my hands coated in her blood. Adrenaline kicks in, and I take off out the back door, through the criss-crossed streets of the city.
I can hear a soft sobbing only to realize it was coming from me as hot tears run down my cheeks at what my grandmother just did. The images forever burnt into my memory.
I clamp my hand over my mouth, trying to stop the noises I am making, my breathing erratic. My heart is pounding so hard I can hear it. Looking over the dumpster, I duck back down behind the dumpster when I hear a man call out, pointing in my direction.
“You there! Stop!” I don’t listen; instead, I take off running. I run to the end of the alleyway to find it is blocked off by a building and a brick wall making it dead-end.
Hearing someone crying behind the dumpster, I look down only to notice a little girl dressed in rags. I pull the ladder down and reach my hand down to her.
“Where is your mother?” I ask, peering down at her tear-stained face.
“They took her,” she sobs.
Without hesitating, I hoist her up so she can climb, and together we race upwards toward the roof. But not fast enough for the vampire chasing us.
A strong hand grips my ankle, ripping me back down to the ground. I fall painfully on top of a man, my head smacking the ground with a loud thud as I bite into my tongue. Another man retrieves the girl, and I hear her scream before a loud SMACK comes from him slapping her on the face.
Her dirty matted blonde hair is all I see as her head whips to the side, blood trickling from her lip and the sound of flesh on flesh echoing down the alleyway.
“Leave her, she is just a child!” I scream. The little human girl, who appears to be maybe nine years old, escapes the man and runs behind me, hiding against my back.
A tall man with black armour walks over his hair down to shoulders and a huge scar across his face, his crimson eyes reflecting oddly as he stares at us.
A Vampire.
Chapter 3
Chapter 3
“Hurry up, bring them to the castle with the rest of them,” he yells to the other men. The man who caught me grabs my hair, the roots painfully tearing from my skull as my head is yanked back.
“Move,” he screams in my face. I obey, following the Vampire man dressed in black armour. The little girl hangs onto the back of my shirt.
When we get to the main street, I find a huge line of women being herded to the castle. They shove us in the line behind more women, all sobbing as they had been ripped out of their beds in the middle of the night and torn away from their families.
When we finally walk through the high castle gates, I find the group of women all separated into rows. A man I recognize to be a Dragon standing at the front, watching everyone be dragged in and lined up. I am in one of the middle rows.
When I see his eyes dart over the crowd, I quickly duck my head down, hoping he didn’t notice me staring. Another man walks along the first line looking at each person and grips their faces looking at their eyes. He then dismisses them, and another man marches them back out the iron gates once they have been cleared and declared not to be whomever they were looking for.
I make sure to keep my head down to avoid making eye contact.
However, a deep husky voice comes above my head. “Look at me,” I can feel his eye penetrating into me.
I flinch away from the anger in his words. He grabs my hair, pulling my head back. I close my eyes breathing through the pain searing through my skull as I feel my hair being ripped out.
“I said look at me,” he growls again. I slowly raise my head to be met with the same hypnotic gold snake eyes of the man I ran into on the street. He scrutinizes my face before letting my hair go. My eyes instantly snap back to the ground.
“Remove them,” he says, his voice daring me to disobey.
“What?” I whisper, confused.
“The contact lenses; remove them now.” I shake my head in a pleading sort of way, knowing if I do, I will be killed instantly.
“Remove them or I will,” he grumbles, grabbing my arm. I whimper at his rough voice echoing into the darkness, making me shiver. I slowly lift my fingers, and one by one, I took out the contact lenses to reveal my sparkling violet eyes . He grabs my chin, forcing my eyes to meet his.
I hear everyone gasp before I hear the murmur of whispers throughout the crowd.
“Fae.”
“She is a Fae.” Everyone’s eyes on mine, which I know are glowing fluorescently into the night. Burning brightly like an amethyst beacon.
“Silence,” the man yells out to the crowd. The chatter instantly died down at his words.
“I knew I sensed a Fae when you bumped into me.” His lips were next to my ear, his cool breath sending shivers down my spine as he moves closer. He leans in inhaling my scent and I can feel his lips barely touching the skin in the crook of my neck.
“You’re coming with me,” he whispers, grabbing me and pulling me towards the old sandstone castle. It was huge, and something right out of a fairy tale, only dark and covered in snow, the vines growing along the sides looked like snakes, dying from the cold and the sandstone high walls tarnished from not being maintained properly.
I struggle, trying to free myself from his grip. He looks to one of the guards that we pass.
“Kill the rest,” he commands, and chaos ensues. All the women’s voices start screaming, echoing through the night at his words. Fear so pungent I could smell and taste it, as the guards moved closer, circling around and trapping them, and leaving them nowhere to run.
“No please, they didn’t do anything,” I begged as I fought against him. He stops and looks down at me and I cower away from his gaze, knowing I shouldn’t speak out of turn, especially to a Dragon king.
He grabs my face, making me look at him.
“Please, I will do anything you want, just don’t hurt them,” I beg. Tears roll down my face as I glance at the women behind me, begging for their lives. All staring at me, fear in their eyes as all the guards freeze waiting for his answer. His thumb rubs over my bottom lip, and a smirk forms on his lips.
“Anything?” he asks, his thumb pulling on my bottom lip softly. My eyes move back to the crowd behind him, before looking down at the little girl still clinging onto my shirt.
The fear in their eyes makes a tear slip from mine, all begging me to agree with whatever it is he wants from me.
“Yes, anything,” I whisper, feeling defeated. He smiles, and I can see all his perfectly straight pearly white teeth gleaming back at me.
I study his face. He has an evil glint in his eye, like he is looking at his prey. Nice full lips and high cheekbones with a firm jaw. He looks like the reincarnation of a god, built strong and beautiful, only I know he is the devil in disguise.
“Let them go,” he commands, raising his voice, his eyes not leaving mine. I shudder at the thought of being alone with this big brooding man. I hear the little girl sob beside me, which makes the man focus his gaze on her.
Pushing her behind me with my hand, his eyes snap back to mine, a devious smile playing on his lips.
“She is coming too,” he says, not leaving any room for argument, not that I would dare argue back. I hear everyone running out of the castle gates before he changes his mind. Before I hear the metal gates shut loudly, the steel groans as the lock slips into place.
He tugs my arm, pulling me toward the castle. Torches are lit along the path as we walk toward it. The only light coming from the lanterns next to the huge heavy double doors leading inside the castle.
He walks down a hall before leading us up some stairs. My feet make noises on the stone steps as we climb them. He pulls me to a door and opens it, swinging it open to reveal a room. A huge four-poster bed sits in the middle with black gauze hanging from the top.
He lets me go, leaving me standing in the middle of the room in front of another fireplace that is taller than me. The warmth is a welcome relief after spending hours in the cold. However, I feel more terrified than ever. He folds his arms over his bulging, muscular chest.
Another man enters the room, his skin the color of mocha, with dark onyx eyes. His chest is bare, revealing his muscular body and abs that look like they are carved from stone, a deep v-line disappearing into the waistband of his pants.
He smiles when he walks in, noticing me. I can tell he isn’t a Dragon but Lycan, which leaves me confused. Only the Dragon Kings live in the castle with their slaves, so why was this man standing beside a Dragon?
“You found her,” says the Lycan; his voice is silky and deep with a slight accent I do not recognize. He smiles, revealing his sharp teeth. As his eyes look me up and down.
I take a step back, feeling my heart thumping faster in my chest. He steps forward, crossing his arms across his chest. Both of them are standing over me.
“Strip,” says the Dragon King. I shake my head, not wanting to remove my clothes in front of their watchful, lust-filled eyes.
Chapter 4
“I said strip,” he repeats, raising an eyebrow at me, daring me to disobey.
I struggle to remove my shirt, trying to cover my bare chest by turning away from him. The girl beside me starts to remove her clothes as well.
“Not you, child. I don’t want to see you naked; you’re only here to make sure she obeys orders,” he says, making me relieved as she pulls her dress strap back up.
I remove my pants, leaving me only in my panties. Using my hands, I cover my breasts before turning around to face them.
The Lycan man steps forward, he licks his lips approvingly making me flinch. “Remove them,” he says looking down at my panties.
“Please,” I beg, not wanting to remove them.
“Remove them or I kill the child,” he says tauntingly. I look at the little girl who darted behind me at his words. I feel my cheeks burn with embarrassment.
This was so degrading and humiliating.
I pull my panties down before placing one hand over my breasts and the other trying to cover my lady parts. Both men step forward and I step back, nearly tripping over the girl behind me.
The Lycan man grabs my wrist, pulling my arm away from my chest, my ample breasts on display for them. I feel a tear run down my cheek as the other man removes my hand from my sensitive parts.
“Why are you crying? You have nothing to be embarrassed about,” says the Dragon. How didn’t they understand how degrading this is? No one should have to be put through this humiliation. I had never been naked in front of anyone besides my grandmother.
“Open your legs,” he growls, stepping closer. The Lycan man peers around me.
“Close your eyes little one,” he whispers to the small girl, and I feel a sob leave my lips. When the girl does as she is told, he stands upright.
He taps my foot with his, forcing my legs apart. His fingers move to my slit before he shoves his finger inside me quickly before removing it. I cry out at the sudden intrusion.
“A virgin like I thought,” he murmurs. I watch horrified as he sucks the finger into his mouth and moans loudly.
“You made me strip to see if I was a virgin? What, asking was too hard?” I ask but instantly regret it as they both step closer.
“You can put your clothes back on,” he says. The Dragon bent down and picked up my shoes. He looks at them before tossing them in the fireplace. I quickly get dressed.
“Follow us, we will take you to your chambers,” the Lycan man says. We follow silently. The Lycan leads the way while the Dragon remains behind us. I can feel his eyes boring into my back, feel the little girl’s arms grip my hips tightly.
We stop outside a door on the bottom floor, he opens the door and reveals a small room with a single bed and small fireplace.
I watch mesmerised as the Dragon man walks in and over to the fireplace, he takes a breath in then blows it out of his mouth like he's blowing a kiss. Yet I can feel the heat in the air rising rapidly as the logs start burning catching alight. He turns and winks at me.
I notice off to the side is a bathroom with a shower and toilet. I don’t move though, too scared by the men standing in front of me, I don’t want to risk angering them.
“You will stay here for now until Silas comes back and verifies you are who we think you are,” says the Lycan man, his eyes burning oddly mirroring the flames coming from the fireplace.
“If you need anything knock on the door, someone will hear you. My name is Matitus, this is Dragus,” says the man I recognize to be a Dragon. I store their names to memory, hoping I never have to utter them.
They then walk out, closing the door behind them. The little girl tugs at my shirt making me look down at her.
“Are they going to kill us?” she asks, concerned. Now that they are gone, I can really look at her. The poor girl is underweight, not that that is something unheard of in the city, starvation being the main killer.
“I don’t think so, well I don’t think they will kill you anyway,” I tell her. Suddenly, there is a knock on the door, and an old woman who I believe is a human walks in with her head down carrying towels and a pile of clothes. Yet something seemed off about her, I just couldn’t put my finger on why I felt that way.
“For you,” she mutters, her eyes never peering up. She thrusts them forward again and I grab them from her before she hurriedly walks back out. I can sense her fear, like she was told not to talk to linger too long.
It would also make sense why she didn’t look up and make eye contact. She then shuts the door and I hear the jingle of keys and I know she locked it. I place the clothes on the bed along with the towels.
“What is your name?” I ask the little girl who comes and stands beside me. “Lilith” she whispers, looking at the pile.
“My name is Elora,” I tell her.
“Elora?” she repeats, trying out my name and making me smile. I dig through the clothes and take Lilith to the shower.
After that, we sit in front of the fire for a while and eventually fall asleep.
I am jolted awake when I hear the door swing open, creaking loudly. Matitus, one of the Dragon Kings, is standing in the doorway. I sit up, groggy before recognition hits me and I become anxious.
Dropping my gaze to the floor. My long black hair falling to my sides creating a veil. I see his boots come into my line of vision. He then kneels in front of me and grips my chin, bringing my gaze to meet his own.
“Why aren’t you sleeping on the bed?” he asks curiously.
“We fell asleep,” I tell him. I watch as he cocked his head to the side examining my face carefully before he lets go of my chin. I see Dragus walk in behind him carrying a tray with what smells like chicken soup. He sets the tray on the desk.
“Get on the bed,” Dragus says, making me glance at him. I feel sick suddenly, my blood running cold at his words. He seems to notice what he said before putting his hands up in mock surrender.
“Not in that way, take the girl with you,” he says, looking down at Lilith laying on the floor. I place my hand on her back, shaking her softly. Her eyes open before she jolts upright leaning against me in fear as she tries to get as far away from them as possible. I stand up to suddenly feel the cut on my back reopen and tear.
I grimace, feeling warm blood running down my spine, but I ignore it. Instead picking up Lilith and placing her so she is sitting on the edge of the bed.
I go to sit beside her, when I feel hot fingers move across my shoulder brushing my hair out of the way before lightly tracing the mark running from my left shoulder down to my right hip. I flinch slightly as it stings. I can feel the singlet sticking to the blood as his fingers run over it.
“Silas won’t like that” I hear Dragus mutter as I sit next to Lilith on the bed. Dragus then brings the tray over, sitting it between us both. Lilith looks at me unsure and I nod my head telling her it’s okay.
She must be starving, and when she finishes her piece of bread, I give her mine before turning to look at the two men standing in the room. They are both still watching me with indecipherable expressions on their faces.
“What is your name?” Matitus asks. Instead of answering I fight the urge and ask a question of my own, trying to avoid giving them my name. I know if they ask again, I won’t be able to help but answer them.
“What do you want with me?” They seem taken aback by my question and I have a feeling no one who has stepped in this castle has ever spoken out of line, let alone asked them a question as to their intentions.
“Your name?” Matitus asks his tone telling me to answer or else. I shiver as the urge to answer honestly takes over; I try to fight against it, sweat beading on my neck. Trying to ignore a direct question is painful to a Fae, telling a lie is almost impossible. One of the things I hate about being Fae. Matitus steps closer his hand cupping my cheek.
“Fae can’t lie or help but to answer. Why are you fighting against answering me?”
I shake my head and his fingers stroke my cheek softly, I grit my teeth trying to fight the urge to answer. “Elora” I stammer out breathlessly.
“Good girl,” he says, letting go of my face and stepping back.
“Why didn’t you want to answer?” he asks, cocking his head to the side. I see Dragus also watching me intently, his face holding some emotion, I don’t recognize. Was it awe? Wonder? I don’t know but it made me uncomfortable. I grit my teeth at his question not wanting to answer, but I know the words will come out anyway.
“Elora Aziza.” My words spew out of me in a rush.
“You’re from a royal bloodline?” Matitus steps back, recognition shining in his eyes, and he looks to Dragus.
Chapter 5
Chapter 5
I nod my head knowing it is useless trying to fight the urges to answer.
Aziza was a known name amongst the Fae, they are direct descendants of the Royal Fae. My grandmother told me the chosen one would be born of one of the three royal bloodlines. Aziza, Zana, and Helcate.
That was all the Oracle knew, apparently. She didn’t know which generation but that they would be of Royal Fae blood and be the Fae’s redemption.
Dragus steps forward. “I haven’t heard that name in decades,” he says, kneeling in front of me.
“Eat little one, I mean neither of you any harm,” he says turning to Lilith who had stopped eating and listened intently to their questions. She resumes eating and I rub her cheek assuredly.
“Silas will want to know for sure,” Dragus says, looking up at Matitus. Matitus looked a little worried by his words, his lips pursing and his brows furrowed while his eyes flickered dangerously making my heart beat a little faster. He nodded once before glancing at me with what appeared to be worry in his eyes.
“Why am I here?” I repeat daringly. They don’t seem bothered by my questions, but I also know that no one would dare question them, they were known for being merciless killers.
“All will be revealed when Silas returns, eat and rest for now. Abigail will be by later in the morning with some chores.”
I nod, glad that they were finally leaving. I watch as they both leave and close the door, I hear lock clicking in place and I finally let out the breath I hadn’t realized I was holding before I turned to Lilith. Her bowl was empty, so I pushed mine towards her.
“You have it,” I tell her. She was terribly skinny, and she needed it more than I did. Lilith thanked me before quickly gobbling my soup down.
When she finished, I place the tray on the desk before pulling the blankets and sheets back on the bed. And climbing in, Lilith curls up beside me and I wrap an arm over her protectively. We both drift off once again.
The next morning, I was awakened by someone opening the door. A woman stands in the doorway. She looks to be around my age, but her skin is chafed like she spent a lot of time outdoors in the cold. Her blue eyes look at mine with curiosity before turning away.
“I’m Abigail, follow me please,” she says, looking at me before noticing Lilith who is also awake and alert to the newcomer. We quickly sit up and walk to the door.
Peering out the door I notice Abigail was waiting at the end of the hall. She waves us to follow, which we do obligingly. She walks us to a large kitchen area where people are busy preparing food and cleaning dishes.
They look up when we enter, their eyes darting away before snapping back to mine. I see the woman in the middle nudge her friend and her brown eyes dart to mine widening, a huge grin lighting up her face. She has freckles and red hair that looks wild and untameable. “A Fae,” she whispers.
At her words, everyone in the room stops to look at Lilith and I. To which, Abigail clears her throat before speaking, her tone harsh.
“Yes, the girl is a Fae, now get back to work and stop gawking,” she says, dismissing them as they hurriedly resume their tasks.
Abigail hands both of us an apple before telling us to follow. We eat our apples while following behind her as she stops at the front of a huge cupboard in the hall. Opening the doors, I can tell it was a cleaning cupboard, with various chemicals on the shelves and mops and brooms along with a cleaning cart.
“You will both be cleaning the library at the front of the castle, when you're done with that come and see me for more work” she tells me, pushing a cart with cleaning supplies toward me and pointing us in the direction of the library.
I walk down the stone corridors towards the front of the castle, stopping when we finally find the room I noticed yesterday. Pushing the cart to the side, I grab out a cloth and some polish, as I hand a duster to Lilith and tell her to dust the blinds. I started the bookshelves and I can’t help but notice most of the books were diaries and books on the different sorts of creatures roaming the earth.
I continue dusting the shelves before coming to the last one, where I find the entire bookshelf is full of books on Fae history.
Most books on the origins of our people and our magic were destroyed after the war. Yet, there ",1,1739077946.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

Is it rude to take too long looking?? It feels weird when there are people behind the glass waiting to take my order, and I’m making them wait while I decide.

So, I figured I’d give this a shot and see if I can connect with like-minded people!

I love exploring new cafés, visiting art galleries, checking out town festivals, and taking relaxing strolls along the beach on weekends. When I’m not out and about, I’m probably at home binging Netflix.

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/1i80nit/how_can_i_make_sure_im_a_great_date_tomorrow/)**: January 23, 2025**

Hi all, I’m a single dad in my mid 30s, and after my marriage ended last year I’m dipping my toe back into dating (via ‘the apps’)… with a coffee shop date tomorrow!

I’m normally very chatty, ask lots of questions, and over the last 5 years I’ve become much more confident and extroverted…

But I’m suddenly so nervous! The lady is really interesting and funny and beautiful, she’s mid 30s single parent too so similar situations. But really worried my mind will go blank, or I’ll ask too many questions like an interview, or my ex will walk in or something!

Any tips / advice? Any suggested topics to chat about? Have I made a mistake by doing a coffee date and not an activity? Agghhh!

***Some of OOP's Comments: (responding to realistic advice and funny advice)***

Commenter: don't talk about your ex.

>**OOP:** Obvs! I’m sure they’ll ask though, seems par for the course when you have kids and post marriage and such! But in my mind answer openly and then moooove the fuck on!

Commenter: Don't talk about your ex unless asked. Cut your nails, no one likes sharp nails when they're getting fingered behind the bins.

>**OOP:** Wow! Top tips. I’ll jot that down…

Commenter: Also, do not, under any circumstances, put on too much aftershave! Too many men smell like they've taken a bath in it and it's migraine and vomit-inducing.

Other than that, you'll do great going by what you've written. Best of luck!

>**OOP:** What is the right amount to spray anyway? I try to do a TINY spray on either side, but it’s a little hard to control the volume that comes out. Also yes I wash, I’m 30 something not 18

Commenter: Make notes of a couple of things she mentions on her profile and ask questions about them. I ended up single in my early 40s and spent a lot of dates listening to men go on about themselves and not asking me anything. I timed one: 10 minutes talking about a hobby (I think it was golf but I tuned out) without a pause.

>**OOP:** Fuck me. Yeah I’m all about questions! I just don’t want it to switch to an interrogation! 10 minutes on golf! I hope he paid

Commenter: Don't put a pack of extra large condoms on the table, and when she sees them go ""How did those get there"".

>**OOP:** So only a pack of extra small ones? Got it!

Commenter: It's not a job interview with a one-sided power dynamic. You're BOTH trying to feel each other out to see if you're compatible. There's no need to feel nervous in this situation, unless you've put too much importance on her being 'the one'. Which is an obvious mistake.

Just be yourself.

>**OOP:** I mean I probably am guilty of thinking every one is ‘the one’ and getting desperately infatuated immediately. But I’ll work on it!

Commenter: Wear very short shorts with at least one bollock hanging out to show how virile you are.

>**OOP:** Dominance. Power. Elegance?

Commenter: Treat it like making friends, and the goal is to find something mutually interesting to chat about. If you're feeling agitated before hand, remember to slow down your breathing (this lowers heart rate and helps you relax). Have fun!

>**OOP:** Treat it like making friends is the one, this is great advice, thanks!

***Comment*** [**Update**](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/1i80nit/comment/m8wc7v7/)**:** ***January 24, 2025 (Next Day)***

Thanks Reddit, you kooks. Went really well, I think!

Didn’t shit myself / cover myself in lynx / turn up drunk / finger anyone behind any bins, so I’m calling it a win.

As we left the coffee shop she asked about a second date for tapas and drinks, so I think it was good! She’s lush. 😊

**Update 1 (Same Post): January 24, 2025 (Day after OG post)**

UPDATE:

Thanks all! It went great. At the end she asked about a second date, which I just booked! We chatted about a fun idea for a third too. I loved listening to her talk. She seems genuine and sharp and kind, and she’s bloody gorgeous and well out of my league! She’s a rocket! 😊

***Some of OOP's Comments Post date:***

>Thank you, I mentally shifted myself from ‘this has got to go well’ to ‘I hope I get a second date’ to ‘the goal is to have a good time’ prior to going on, and that probably helped! She was great, second date booked

Commenter: Too many comments to read how it went, but you sound like a decent fella so hoping you did brilliantly pal. P.s. nothing to be worried about, you got this 👍🏻

>**OOP:** Thanks bud! It was lovely, still buzzing. Been messaging each other all day, not got much work done 😅. Complicated getting together as we’ve both got kids, and I’ve never dated anyone with kids or post myself having kids, so it all feels slightly different in that regard, but as a date, it was lovely, I like watching her talk! And excited to get a little over-wined with her next week. Lucky me!

Commenter: No idea who you are but definitely cheering you on. Oi oi. Go on man you deserve it 😊

Don't rush into things though, play it by ear and have fun. You lucky so and so 🙃

>**OOP:** Thanks bud! I made a this account the other day after having my other one for like a decade plus. Obviously this one has had more impact than my main one ever did! 🤣  
Yeah I feel lucky! Also feel like a teenager, all the warm and fuzzies of seeing a message and a bit of back and forth flirting going on. It’s lovely little experience isn’t it!

*Previous relationship:*

>Thank you. I think my last relationship was just so fraught with sadness and tension and distance towards the end I was really excited about the prospect of an ‘easy connection’, which there was.  
Also the last time I dated I was like 20, and to be honest dressed like shit, had a pubey beard, cut my own hair, and was in a student hippy phase. So having got my shit together fitness / style / hair / dress sense / career / confidence wise, some of the women who seem to want to date me are MIIIIIILES out of my league in my head. So I think that adds a bit of nervousness, I keep expecting to be found out as some kind of homunculus troglodyte!

Commenter: Aww. You sound lovely. Good luck❤️

>**OOP:** Aww thank you. I think I’m just an over thinker. And the prospect of actually arriving to a first date for the first time in an eon suddenly made me question if I really have become a more confident, chatty person, or if it was all a wild dreaaam!

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/1ifsppl/how_can_i_make_sure_im_a_great_date_tomorrow/)**: February 2, 2025 (10 days from OG post)**

Hey folks! So a week or so ago I posted this thread (https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/s/uwPmxPoPgN) and had a lot of great / lovely / funny / weird responses from you all.

Just wanted to give an update….

So date 1 went reaaaally well. 🙃 I was predictably nervous as shit and sort of in awe of her in person, so I definitely didn’t take in everything she said… it was a bit like trying to hear someone while also staring into the evening sun and while white noise blared really loud in your ears… you know? Lovely… but hard to take stuff in! But it was a very cute coffee date and I managed to remain coherent enough to decide date 2!

We planned date 2 (dinner and wine 😊)… but then before that booking came around we snuck in a walk the day before, so date 3 came before date 2 😄, real cute stuff.

Dinner and wine was amazing… stayed til the restaurant closed, then chatted and such all night. Just got home. She’s a bit of a delight. Super lush. What a time to be alive. 🫠

Just wanted to share that wholesomeness with you this morning Reddit. I’ll probably leave it there unless anything significant happens in the future!

Have just the most incredible Sunday internet friends! 🙌

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: You're such a cutie! What a lovely post to read on a Sunday morning. Wishing you both plenty more dates and cuteness!

>**OOP:** There was a lot of cuteness, she’s a peach, so long may I not fuck it up and continue to enjoy lots of cute dates ✨

Commenter: Really pleased for you!

>**OOP:** Thank you! I’m pretty flipping ecstatic too. Exhausted though 😅 and now need to parent on very little sleep, terrible instant coffee and glowing vibes

Commenter: I'm just a sad lonely old bloke these days but this post really made me smile and remember similar times from my past . Ahhh, its a great thing to experience! Good luck ☺️

>**OOP:** It’s lovely isn’t it. It’s never too late champ. You got this, you gotta play the game to have any chance of success. I’d love it to last, but even if it doesn’t this bit is bloody amazing. Keep trying friend!

Commenter: So delighted for you. I think everyone here feels like the best friend waiting on tenterhooks to hear how you got on.

I can hear the smile on your face! Good luck! Enjoy every minute.

>**OOP:** Thank you internet best friends! Big goofy smile on my face. I don’t want to be annoying with updates but thought some folks might like to know! I’ll probably do another update if there’s anything super positive and significant down the road.. I probably won’t if it doesn’t work out, so that it remains a nice little internet good news story (with a little mystery ending)

Commenter: Yes, yes, yes, yes, to updates on official date 3 or unofficial date 4 whichever way you look at it.

>**OOP:** I’ll put a bit of time between updates, don’t want to tip into being annoying and don’t necessarily want to chronicle the entire relationship online! Taking it easy and enjoying it and will do some updates if anything lovely and cool comes of it, it’s all promising and lovely at the moment, but very early days so I must try to keep my head screwed on!

Commenter: Good to hear things are going well; can you highlight any specific useful advice people gave in the last post? May be useful to give other people some insight and hope if they’re single and in a similar situation

>**OOP:** Good question! I guess things that helped / nudged my brain to chill out a bit were:

* Treat it like making a friends
* The goal is just basically to find out stuff you have mutual interest in

>And then of course the evergreen good advice:

* Cover yourself in 3 bottles of lynx africa and don’t shit yourself",43,1739077216.0,BestofRedditorUpdates,13,0.85,False

[snyder.substack.com](http://snyder.substack.com)  |  [www.2025and.me](http://www.2025and.me)

1. **Do not obey in advance.** –  A citizen who bends over is teaching power what it can do.

2. **Defend institutions.** –Choose an institution you care about—a court, a newspaper, a law, a labor union—and take its side.

3. **Beware the one-party state.** – Tyranny exploits democracy for autocracy. Vote. Join Boards. Run for office if you can. 

4. **Take responsibility for the face of the world.** – Symbols matter. Notice the signs of hate. Do not look away, and do not get used to them. Remove them yourself.

5. **Remember professional ethics.** – Do not facilitate atrocity. DRAW A LINE and HOLD THE LINE.

6. **Be wary of paramilitaries.** – When the pro-leader paramilitary and the official police and military intermingle, the end has come.

7. **Be reflective if you must be armed.** – One day you may be asked to hold firepower and do unspeakable things. Be ready to say no.

8. **Stand out.** – Someone has to. Remember Rosa Parks. When one sits down, we all stand up.

9. **Be kind to our language.** – Resist jargon and coded speech. Read Books. Use common language. A spade is a spade! A nazi salute is a nazi salute!

10.  **Believe in truth.** – To abandon facts is to abandon freedom.

11.  I**nvestigate**. – Seek information. Support and listen to investigative journalists. Beware controlled media and propaganda. 

12.  **Make eye contact and small talk.** – These actions can maintain a sense of shared community. 

13.  **Practice corporeal politics.** – Get out into the real world. Digital activism is fake. Power wants your body in a chair and your eyes glued to a screen.

14.  **Establish a private life**. – Email is insecure. Texting is insecure. Have personal exchanges in person without devices. Tyrants seek the hook on which to hang you.

15.  **Contribute to good causes.** – Support civil society through direct action and donation. If you do not have money give time.

16.  **Learn from peers in other countries**. – Stay connected with international trends. Hungary, Russia, Brazil, and the USA. Have passports and emergency plans.

17.  **Listen for dangerous words.** – Be alert to the use of the words extremism and terrorism. Be alive to the fatal notions of emergency and exception. Be angry about the treacherous use of patriotic vocabulary. 

18.  **Be calm when the unthinkable arrives.** –When the ‘terrorist attack’ comes, remember that authoritarians exploit such events in order to consolidate power. The sudden disaster that requires the end of checks and balances, opposition parties, fair trial and free speech. DO NOT FALL FOR IT.

19.  **Be a patriot.** – History is watching. Set a good example of what America means for the generations to come. They will need it.

20.  **Be as courageous as you can.** – If none of us is prepared to die for freedom, then all of us will die under tyranny.

1il6tfl,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiazBeez/comments/1il6tfl/how_we_accidentally_became_beekeepers/,How We Accidentally Became Beekeepers,"It was a crisp October evening, the kind where you can feel the seasons shifting, and my brother and I were doing what we often did—playing video games on our PCs, a couple of beers in hand. The sound of clacking keyboards and virtual explosions filled the room when suddenly, during a lull in the game, I decided to browse the internet. That’s when it happened.

I have this habit, you see, of making late-night, slightly tipsy purchases. Usually, it’s harmless—maybe a quirky gadget or some obscure book—but that night was different. I stumbled upon a website advertising bees for $125. Not just any bees—three pounds of them. The listing was framed like a once-in-a-lifetime deal: 3 lbs of bees and a queen for just $125! And in that moment, it made perfect sense. My brother glanced over, half-amused, and said, ""You’re not really going to buy bees, are you?"" To which I confidently replied, ""Of course I am! What a bargain!""

The next morning, I woke up, coffee in hand, and thought, Did I buy bees last night? A quick check of my email confirmed it—order placed, payment received, and our bees were set to arrive in April. I showed my brother the email, and after a long silence, he just said, “Guess we’re beekeepers now.”

At first, it was a joke. We knew nothing about bees, except that they made honey, and that stings hurt. But as the months passed, something shifted. We couldn’t just let these bees show up without being ready. So, we buckled down.

We watched every beekeeping video YouTube had to offer, joined local groups, and ordered a couple of books with titles like Beekeeping for Dummies. We learned about hives, frames, nectar flows, and the mysterious waggle dance. We discovered that bees communicate with one another through vibrations and that their entire existence depends on a well-organized queen-led system. It was fascinating. Suddenly, what started as a drunken impulse became a shared mission.

We ordered hive kits and spent weekends in the garage assembling them, sanding down the wood, and coating the frames in a thick layer of beeswax. It wasn’t easy—there were moments of frustration, sawdust everywhere, and more than one argument about the ""right"" way to hammer a frame together. But by April, our hives were ready.

Then came bee day. The bees arrived in two wooden packages, each buzzing with life. We had our protective gear, a smoker to keep the bees calm, and the hives set up in the perfect spot in the backyard. We carefully opened the packages and introduced the bees to their new homes. To our amazement, they seemed to settle in right away, exploring the frames and getting to work like they’d always belonged there.

Standing there, watching thousands of bees adjust to the space we’d prepared, we felt something unexpected: pride. We’d built this. And the bees—well, they seemed happy.

That was the beginning of something far bigger than we ever anticipated. Beekeeping became more than a hobby; it became a way of life. It taught us patience, respect for nature, and the incredible interconnectedness of the world around us. What started as a late-night whim turned into a passion that’s shaped who we are today.

And yes, we still laugh about it—because really, who buys bees at 1 a.m.? Turns out, we do.",1,1739075935.0,DiazBeez,0,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1il6jxr,https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddard2/comments/1il6jxr/our_needdesire_for_something_creates_our_struggles/,Our need/desire for something creates our struggles,"I just had an epiphany about why so many struggle with manifesting. Why somethings can manifest effortlessly while others seem to be an uphill battle. It is because our need or desire for it.

When people first get introduced to the law, they are told to test the law. They may manifest a coffee, climbing a ladder, finding a coin on the ground, etc. and bam, it will manifest within days but when people use it for money, sp, business they struggle to do exactly what they did before. They overthink and over do it which implies that you are not the person who has it.

It is our need for the thing to come that causes the struggle. I’ll give you an example, for the SP people out there. A good majority of you are manifesting someone back, if you think about how things were when you first started seeing them you didn’t NEED them. You may have not cared too much in the beginning and you had the relationship. During your time together you fell in love obviously and you gave your power to them. The break up happened and now you’re trying to get them back. Your need/want for them back is causing the struggle.

Now before my words get twisted, I’m not saying you can’t want someone or something specific. I am just pointing out how our need can cause the separation. If you were the person who was irresistible to all men or women, would you be worried about what one thinks? Probably not because you’d have a huge selection to choose from and that’s how it should be with manifesting. You choose that specific thing to manifest to experience it and not to get it.

You have to remember that you are God. You are the one that is the prize not them. Work on your self concept and become the very best version of yourself. Not for your sp, money, or anything else other than doing it for yourself because YOU are the greatest thing to EVER happen to this planet",5,1739075018.0,NevilleGoddard2,3,0.78,False

1il6hnl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1il6hnl/stream_of_consciousness_first_impression_reviews/,Stream of Consciousness First Impression Reviews of 21 Fantome Samples,"I ran across Fantome because I saw a scent named Baba Yaga and I had to know. (And you know what? I was right.) Realizing there was an entire Slavic Fairy Tales collection, I decided to get the full set and use it to do an immersive re-read of one of the most beautifully written books I've ever read, Catherynne Valente's *Deathless*. SO EXCITED. I wanted to sample everything first because impatient curiosity, obviously, but also so I could better time the scents to the writing.

Anyhow. I also got a sample set of 7 other scents because the whole catalogue is so interesting and I particularly wanted to smell Duende, Lymphae, and Olwyn (I'm on the hunt for memory scents involving lilac and gardenia).

Typically, I love things like florals, musk, rice, spices, and forest scents. I amp vanilla and vetiver (and maybe aquatics? or I'm just sensitive to them), so they tend to put me off by their intensity and how the scent goes out of balance. Typically I'm not a gourmand girlie and I don't like boozey notes. I'm not into extreme sweetness (or some things not relevant to these samples, like coconut and sunscreen scents). Spoiler, but I'm really impressed with Fantome bringing me around on their use of vanilla, sweetness, and aquatics. 

Due to impatience, I decided to speed test everything. Four scents at a time. One to each inner elbow and one to each wrist. I applied one at a time, waiting at least an hour or two before moving on to the next and jotting down stream of consciousness thoughts. Here's my hot mess of first impressions notes lol. Now that I have a solid idea of what everything is like I'm going back to sample everything individually with informed expectations.

1 - Scrubber.  
2 - Not for me.  
3 - It's fine.  
4 - Like it. I might consider a mini size if it's really interesting, but I can probably live without it.  
5 - Love it! I would happily use a bottle of this.

**Arashiyama** (EDP) *Rain-drenched bamboo, fresh aomikan slices, Japanese pear, cherry blossom, sandalwood, ginger, white tea, and faded perfume musk*: This smells like a (beautiful, expensive) bar of soap on me. There are some faint hints of interesting details that I can't quite get a grasp on yet. The soapiness fades a little as it wears and I like it more the longer it's on. I'm hoping that aging will bring out more complexity, so I'm going to set this aside for a while. It's likely too much soapiness for me.

Verdict: 3/5 - Need to wait and retry again later. It's on the upper side of fine.

**Baba Yaga** (EDP) *Black and red musk, a smoldering cauldron, cracked bone, cardamom, hanging animal skins, burning mugwort*: So smooth! Sweet, in a nostalgic way that I can't pinpoint yet. But a soft, cozy sweetness. Pressed powdered sugar, maybe? But with something more going on. Delicate. Shockingly subtle and not at all what I expected. The impulse to buy a full size of this after a single sniff is STRONG. Doesn't smell anything like what I imagined from the list of notes. There's a faint hint of herbs underlying the sweetness, making it really complex and counter-balancing it well. I love this. I'm excited to see if a longer rest period brings out more of the herbs and musk and smokiness (I get zero smoke thus far), because I think that would only make me enjoy it more (but I also love it as is). This one feels quite unique.

The longer it's on the more it evolves and it's SO cool. This smells like the way putting on a leather jacket feels — there's no leather note or anything that smells like a leather jacket, but there's a really powerful feeling that putting this on magically makes me cooler, even if I'm just wearing a t-shirt and jeans. Or sweatpants. Or whatever. The initial burst of sweetness mellows more than it fades and that's when the edgy atmosphere of the list of notes starts to emerge, all within that fluffy haze of sweetness. This is some badass candy. I can't stop huffing this one. The more I smell this, the more I can't imagine a world in which I don't buy a bottle of it. This one is special. After about 14 hours it's still going strong, but the sweetness finally fades to a soft musk with a wisp of smoke swirling through it. I saw someone describe the musk that this fades into as the scent of someone you love. It's true. That's exactly what this smells like.

Additional thoughts on a dedicated wear: It's a little bit animalic before it dries. That tang mellows immediately upon drying, becoming slightly earthy beneath the herbal and sweet notes. This is a very linear scent, which is impressive considering its complexity. It gets quieter throughout the day, but no matter how faded it gets I can still smell the whole of the fragrance. I get bummed out when a scent is FANTASTIC but then it fades down to like... vanilla. Which can be fine, but it's not generally that compelling to me on its own. Every moment of this one makes me want to smell my wrists. It's kind of like an herbal Fun Dip stick. (Or maybe herbal Necco Wafers?) That's definitely what's making this feel nostalgic to me.

Verdict: 5/5 - This is so cool and unique. I absolutely want to smell like Baba Yaga. What a baddie. I want a bottle of this real bad. This is my favorite of all 21 scents.

**Dantalion** (EDP) *Creamy chai tea, obscuring mists, sandalwood, a plaster mask, clarifying ginger, carnations, dandelions, & a melted beeswax candle*: I really like the spices and the tea note comes through well, but I'm unsure about the sweetness and wish it was a bit less. There's an initial burst of something that smells bready (in an almost savory way) to me, but it faded pretty quickly, which is too bad because I was kinda into it. I assume the spicy-floral is the carnation, which I like. The spices muddle a bit as it settles, get a little funky, then blend nicely. I kind of wish they were easier to pick apart and a little less smoothly blended. Man, if the sweetness were more subtle I'd be so instantly obsessed with this. As it is, it's nice, but I don't know if it's something I want to smell like? It becomes a near photorealistic chai tea scent as the wear goes on, which is nice. Don't know if I need that though.

Okay, nope, after a while the ""candle wax"" is what it settles down to and then it's straight up cheap French Vanilla candle. That's unfortunate. Really nails the wax though. (It's actually kind of nostalgic, but for something I didn't miss.) This is likely just a me-problem because of how my skin amps vanilla; I bet Dantalion is really great on most people. Hours later and it's still that same candle scent. Bummer. I'll give this another go after it ages a while, but it's definitely a pass for me.

Verdict: 2/5 - Could have been a high 3 or maybe even a low 4, but that vanilla candle scent that took over the second half of the wear is simply something I don't need in my life. Not that I need a realistic chai latte perfume either, but objectively that part was pretty cool.

**Duende** (EDP) *Evokes the smell of being lost in a forest—with oakmoss, cedar, fir, resinous labdanum, benzoin, tree sap, wild violets, and lilac*: I really wasn't expecting this to be so powdery. It's a nice kind of powdery, kind of a subtly masculine powdery, but I'm not sure if I get anything foresty from it. There's a hint of warmth that I like. I think this one really needs to age for a while. It just doesn't feel like much of anything. It's vague and unopinionated, which bums me out because I was so excited for this one. At the end of the day this smells like warm dust to me, in a way that's strangely nice? But that's not really what I aspire to smell like. Hmm.

Verdict: 3/5 - but it should probably be a 2. Go on girl, give us nothing! I think I didn't spray enough. I put it in the middle because I feel like I can't judge it yet.

**Finist the Falcon** (EDP) *Bulgarian rose married with dewy Russian rose, swirled in strawberry, currant, & peach kissel with cream*: Damn. This is great. The fruitiness is deliciously beautiful with the rose. The cream is subtle. Brightly, unapologetically feminine. This is quite sweet, but I don't find it cloying. It's not a vanilla sweetness, but rather something soft and fluffy. The sugar whipped into the cream. This has quite a bit of projection for something I only sprayed one small spritz of from a tester bottle. Really floats around in a pretty cloud. A little definitely goes a long way.

The rose asserts itself more as time goes on, the fruit mellowing and giving way to the earthiness of the floral. If I hadn't tested this at the same time as Vasilisa, I think I'd be more enchanted with it. It's lovely, but in a direct comparison with Vasilisa's warmth and honeyed sweetness, Finist doesn't feel quite as special. It's so pleasant, but I'm not transported. It's beauty for the sake of beauty, but it doesn't compel me to daydream. I'm still quite pleased to have a sample and excited to wear it again, but it doesn't feel difficult to talk myself out of wanting a full bottle when comparing it to other scents. On its own, I think it would be an easy love affair. Swift and consuming, but not meant to last longterm.

Gah, the middle of this wear is just so good. Effortlessly balanced. This is what I always expect designer perfumes to smell like, but they never do. The rose makes the fruit smell a bit wild. As in free. Vines curling around a fence post to pull it down and swallow it into the earth, thorns snaring the hem of a dress. After a while longer there's a hint of freshly laundered white sheets. It's definitely my favorite moment in this scent so far. Where it started out with a decadent banquet of dessert, almost overwhelming, this part is perfectly blended and more complex. It carries within it the memories of everything that came before, but now it's more. As someone who's not a gourmand girlie, I find this balance of notes quite appealing. Anyone who enjoys rose and fruit should smell Finist. It's so enthusiastically what it is. It doesn't last as long as other Fantome scents, despite being more powerful than their average. When it's almost faded away it kind of smells like the haze of sweetness in Baba Yaga, which then mostly makes me want to smell Baba Yaga again.

Verdict: 4/5 - This is beautiful and could have been a 5 if I weren't smelling so many excellent scents at once. Mostly the thing stopping me from absolutely loving it is that I'm interested in more unusual things right now and this is a very straightforwardly pretty scent. If you want to smell good more than you care about smelling interesting, try this.

**Firebird** (EDP) *Smoldering embers, burning cloves, golden saffron, bright orange, soot on feathers, soft flame, a stolen apple*: It's kind of giving bbq when it's wet. The initial smoke note is a bit caustic for me. And there's some booziness? The apple is nice, when I get it. It's all a bit muddled at the start. After a few minutes it starts to settle. There's a hint of something clean beneath it all, in a nice way. I just don't know about this smoke note. On me it's kind of sour with a tinge of gasoline, which is a scent I tend to be hyper-sensitive to and really dislike. It feels at war with the apple and soapy-clean notes. If this were a dryer, more straightforward smoke note then it would work much better for me. As it is, I think my personal loathing of gasoline is going to make this an automatic pass for me. Even if this settles nicely, I can't get into this gasoline bourbon apple pie situation. I wish I got the clove note. I LOVE clove and it's the aspect of this scent I was most looking forward to, but there isn't even a hint of it. That's disappointing.

It gets much better as it mellows, but there's not anything in it to hook me and make me excited to keep smelling it. Without the spices coming through it feels a bit empty and unfinished. Once it's all the way settled I don't mind the smoke note; if it smelled like this the whole time maybe we could have been friends. What this finally fades down to is really nice — warm and extremely comfy — but not worth suffering through the journey to get there. 

Verdict: 2/5 - On the verge of being a 1. If I weren't so curious about how it would develop, I would have scrubbed it. This could be great on someone else, but it's definitely not for me.

**Ivan the Fool** (EDP) *Golden figs, oakmoss, Siberian fir, Russian leather, wolf fur, juniper berries, sparkling bergamot*: Oh! At this point I'm having trouble mustering excitement for some of the more ""masculine"" scents, even though I really like that vibe, just because the more ""feminine"" scents have been such mega hits for me and now it's all I want to think about. But this is fresh and a bit lush! Not so heavy as I was expecting. It has a sparkle about it. The juniper is great. The golden figs are sweet and beautiful. The leather is a subtle warmth beneath everything. Really nice. It's maybe a bit expected in comparison to other samples I've become enamored with; I'm not feeling surprised by anything except the lightness of the mood. The forest is in the background; this is more about the person in the forest — the snacks they brought and what they've touched in their travels. It's bright with excitement, sweet with naivety. And all throughout the juniper keeps it fresh. A little bit tingly. The fruit is so fragrant. The figs get even sweeter as the wear goes on and it can veer on being a bit much for me. After a while the base turns powdery and I'm not as into that. Powderier and powderier at the end.

Verdict: 4/5 - There's a lot to like about this one, but it has enough in common with scents I like a bit more (the juiciness of Kinmokusei, the lushness of Lyudmila) that I don't need it. That juniper though. I would love a good juniper scent.

**Kinmokusei** (EDP) *Golden osmanthus in its full complexity—golden blossoms tinged with citrus, ripe apricot, juicy peach, tree sap, and deep, resinous amber*: This one is delightfully fruity on me and I REALLY like it. There's a faint hint of spiciness in this, underlying the juiciness of the fruit, probably from the amber and/or tree sap. I've seen people call this powdery, but I get absolutely zero powder. Just peak season fruit (the fruitiness lasts the entire wear, it doesn't fade on me) with a really subtle floral quality to the fruitiness itself. This is also one that keeps making me smell my wrist. It's kind of sexy in a gluttonous way, ripe peach juice dripping from your chin after biting into fresh picked fruit. Not grocery store fruit. This is orchard fruit.

Verdict: 5/5 - I love this. It's hedonistic. There's no grand narrative to it, but it's so good it doesn't need one.

**Koschei the Deathless** (EDP) *Forest mushrooms, turmeric, myrrh, treemoss, dry bones, sea kelp, dark patchouli, creamy ylang*: Beautifully medicinal. Is that a hint of licorice? Smells cozy. There's something that sparkles in the deep forest darkness of this. The sea kelp is really neat — hinting at the depths of the ocean within the depths of the woods is like a twist of magic. A hallucination. A mirage spell cast by a trickster. It smells untrustworthy in a way that induces temptation. It's something you know you shouldn't get closer to, but you'll lose your mind of unsated curiosity if you don't, like a death sentence to wonder about an unknowable mystery for the remainder of your life. This is dangerous in the way that faeries are. Deceptive. There's a threat of obsession if you're careless with yourself. Underneath everything there's the absolute faintest hint of something sweet — it's easy to miss, wavering in and out of frame. (It's perhaps a similar sweetness to that of Baba Yaga? But in such a different proportion that they're nothing alike, just cohesive as different parts of a collection.) Such an interesting scent. A beautiful monster lurking in another plane of existence and you feel an echo of their presence, but you're otherwise utterly incapable of seeing them.

This pairs really well with Marya Morevna — they clash and intertwine in a really fascinating way. Complementary, but not in a way where they belong together. They're just very much of the same story. There's something fresh and clean about this, despite also being quite earthy. The soft medicinal tang, maybe. I wouldn't be mad if this were a bit creamier — there's some creaminess, but a bit more might make it even more bewitching. It's super interesting when I smell it at the same time as Vasilisa.

Oh! After an hour or two the dry bones note is having its moment. They smell cracked to me. A skeleton half-buried in the forest floor, with a tree root grown through the eye of the skull. A few bones dangle from different lengths of twine tied up into the branches overhead. Cool. The way this is developing smells like being on a walk, discovering small, forbidden secrets in nature. Things not meant to be found. This has a lot of presence for something I find to be fairly subtle and I'm also catching some pretty defined whiffs of it, despite only putting on one very small tester bottle spray and it also competing with three other scents. It's dank. It's dank in a way that I really enjoy, but I think my wife isn't going to be a fan or this one (she hates mushrooms). This is going to smell like mold to her, I just know it.

Finally, it's as if the vision of the forest begins to fracture into a marshy reality. Curiosity got the better of you and now you're trapped, snared in tangles of decay. Maybe the bones you passed by earlier were your own. Koschei the Deathless is what I wanted Encre Noir to smell like.

Woah, this one is eternal; 24 hours of wear and it's still going STRONG. (This is after I half-heartedly tried to wash my samples off before going to bed.) That would be great except that by now it has lost all of the things I enjoyed most about it and now it's nothing but patchouli and — indeed — my wife keeps asking if I smell mold, so it's definitely not a great patchouli on me :c 

Verdict: 3.5/5 - This was a 4 (and a 5 for the fun of the experience), but the eternal patchouli note lasting over 24 hours kinda burned me out. Also my wife definitely hates this.

**Lymphae** (EDP) *Fresh musk, cool vanilla, a swift-running stream, Italian lilac, orange blossom, damp earth, and the ozone of spring thunderstorms*: This is fresh and green in a way I immediately like. The lilac is very present right away, so I'm thrilled. There's a bit of spiciness too, tucked into the subtle earthiness. It's also watery, but not in that generic aquatic way I dislike. A faint, pleasant tinge of sweetness that must be the vanilla. I'm so excited! This is exactly what I wanted this to be. The vanilla is actually nice with it, assuming my skin doesn't end up amping it too much. Really keeps the aquatic aspect in check. This smells cooling somehow. It does capture the feeling of a cool stream on a warm day. This is a truly refreshing scent. As it settles down, everything blends together so nicely. This is incredibly wearable. It just smells good. Period. The vanilla is actually starting to fade, so it's ending on that gently floral watery note. I'm so pleased! I wasn't even going to be that mad to end on vanilla, but it makes it feel more unique in comparison to the other Fantome scents I'm liking most and I'm glad for it not to feel redundant in any way.

Verdict: 5/5 - Just beautiful, but also a bit unusual. I want a lilac perfume so bad; this one isn't quite the memories in a bottle situation I'm looking for, but it gets everything else right. I would love to own a bottle of this, but I'll probably prioritize some of my other favorites first. Maybe smell a few more lilac perfumes before committing.

**Lyudmila** (EDP) *Ruby red grapefruit, jasmine sambac, vanilla, hinoki, a drop of dragon's blood, bitter orange, rosemary*: Gorgeous. So much depth and warmth, but there's also zingy, fresh citrus top notes. Such a range captured all at once! I immediately really like this one. Fantome might convert me into a vanilla fan at this rate. I, of course, love the florals. This is crazy good, to be honest. If it can continue to be this interesting and not burn out to just vanilla then this is a real contender. This got a bit drowned out by me sampling multiple things at once, which is too bad and entirely my fault. I'm very excited to test a full wear of this. It mellows down into this gently spicy, incredibly interesting ghost of everything it was and that's what I want. I love when the faded end of a scent is still something I'm excited to smell.

Additional thoughts on a refresh: When I put this on before, I was surprised by lunch and didn't get to appreciate it properly. I felt robbed, so I just put on one more little spritz. I love the rosemary in the opening. It's so herbal and deeply green. After Koschei The Deathless I really started craving something like this in a context that would work better for me in a real life wearability way. So this is really scratching that itch. As the rosemary mellows, the grapefruit comes out. It's a beautiful transition. This is so fresh yet rich. Effortlessly addictive. There's something freshly baked about the middle of this scent's wear, like the gentle sweet-savory note of steam wafting from a fresh loaf of simple bread. (It's vaguely En Passant-ish to me, in that detail.) The vanilla in this one is light, sugared. Not heavy. Not cloying.

Verdict: 5/5 - I love this one. The rosemary makes it kind of weird in the best way. This one doesn't seem like it should work, but it really does. This is a Top 3 contender for sure.

**Marya Morevna** (EDP) *Sharp steel, rare Siberian lotus, skin musk, ambrette, white Baltic amber, wild orchid, blood red beets*: This smells EXACTLY like the notes listed. Somehow it's everything and nothing like what I expected. Really beautiful and surprisingly wearable. The opening of *an unexpected blade to your neck* is done just right — not so much of a steel note that it twinges, but enough to be distinctly present. This is really well blended. I can pick out all of the notes, but they coexist together so smoothly. It makes it very subtle. This is a scent for powerful women. It's not a challenging scent to me, but there's nothing sweet about it, nothing that cares about the opinion of anyone but herself. The floral note is entwined with the beet note in such a cool, interesting way. It's effortlessly gorgeous but deeply grounded. Both feet on the earth with her eyes on the horizon, ready to take on the sky. This is a scent for women who think masculine fragrances are the sexiest thing a woman can wear, except this scent has never thought about a man. This really is sexy and cool as hell. Rather than aiming to be a masculine scent, this is mercilessly feminine. Lotus scented armor.

There's a little bit of spiciness coming in as the steel note fades, but also a bright freshness. This is the kind of clean scent I like. It's nothing like a bar of soap, but it smells like being freshly bathed in the middle of a countryside battlefield. It keeps getting better as the day goes on, little complexities coming out. Never thought I'd say this, but I kind of wish there were more beets??? Why is the beet note so good??? Hands down the best part. Once it's wound down, it's pleasant but not particularly notable. I do wish it ended with something... more. It's fine, but I don't know if winding down to ""fine"" is good enough to justify a full size, even if the first half of the wear is great.

Verdict: 4.9 - I feel bad not giving this a 5. She deserves a 5! But I do wish there was just a teensy bit more going on at the end. It's epic for most of the wear, but then it fizzles out to vaguely fine. With how much I love so many of these scents, I guess that's something I'm picking on. This would be a 5 if I weren't so blown away by several other things.

**Mesmer** (oil) *Deep, luxurious oudh, refined vetiver, cool frankincense, slightly salty ambergris, smooth myrrh, and dark patchouli*: Mentholated? I wasn't expecting that, but I like it. Semi-sweet. Herbal. A hint of saltiness. This is a bit like my favorite parts of Koschei The Deathless, but refined instead of dank. (Maybe I'll do a side by side comparison.) Spicy. Earthy. Crisp. There's something relaxing in this. It's quite different from the contentment of Vasilisa, this is more like... relaxing to put you in a trance. How appropriate. Fantome is so clever. Unfortunately my skin amps vetiver, so about an hour in it's starting to take over and drown out the nuances. Eventually fades down to... a soft vanilla? Where was that hiding? Faintly salty, in an interesting way. And vetiver, I'll be amping this vetiver for ages. 

Verdict: 3.5/5 - It's a 4, except for the vetiver getting out of control, which is a me-problem. The first half of this was a very high 4, even.

**Morozko** (EDP) *Smooth peppermint, cracking birch, nutmeg, biting winter wind, cold vanilla, black pepper*: York peppermint patties? Affectionate. Chocolate isn't on the notes list, but I absolutely smell it. The black pepper is faint, but I like it — I'd like more, even. The peppermint is indeed very smooth. Not getting nutmeg or birch yet, but hopefully I will as it wears. The vanilla is balanced well. I'm not sure if this is something I aspire to smell like, but depending how it settles that could definitely change. I don't mind the sweetness; it seems to be that same fluffy, light sweetness that's sprinkled throughout this collection and I've been a fan so far. As the slightly too gourmand for me opening mellows it starts to feel a bit more cozy and interesting. Surprisingly nice. The spices and the birch are great once they start to assert themselves more. I don't know that I'd wear this a ton, but if it maintains this instead of burning out to a pure vanilla base then I might consider a mini size, as an occasional winter treat. Yeah, the more the birch comes through the better it gets. This wafts nicely. Alas, the vanilla is starting to take over and sooner than I was hoping. It's not a bad vanilla, but I really wanted the spiciness to at least stick around, if not take over. It's still pleasant and cozy though. Doesn't seem like it'll last very long at this rate — it's struggling to hit the 4 hour mark — but to be fair I put on the teeniest amount possible for this test wear, so I'm not really judging it on that today. It's just seems unusual, compared to every other Fantome scent so far.

Verdict 4/5 - This one isn't the most Me, but I like it anyway. A lot! It's a high 4. I wouldn't hate having a mini of this, but the price point will probably stop me. I have higher priorities.

**Olwyn** (EDP) *Magnolias, plush white lilies, night-blooming jasmine, and gardenias over rich, buttery vanilla, myrrh, benzoin, and a hint of orange blossom*: Ohhh I would really love if a longer resting period really brings out the florals. The initial florals are so great! And the vanilla is so buttery and rich! I don't actually like vanilla in perfume as a rule (at least not before Fantome), I tend to find it cloying, but this is maybe the best vanilla I've ever smelled. The thing is, my skin really amps vanilla, so after a bit the vanilla takes over EVERYTHING and becomes the only thing left. Recently I've tried some samples with really noxious vanilla (Mon Guerlain, By The Fireplace) and so I think I'm holding those negative experiences against Olwyn a little bit. I think I need a longer resting period as much as this sample does. I can see why this scent is so loved though! The vanilla-floral combination feels very Now.

Verdict: 4.5/5 - I'm not usually a vanilla girlie, but some of these are really changing my mind. Very excited to do a full wear of this one and also to see how it ages. Beautiful.

**One White Crow** (oil) *A soft  fougère with creamy white tea, airy vanilla, violets, honeysuckle, and a touch of lavender over a bed of moss and ivy*: Really powdery. Clean. Soft. It's hard for me to pick apart the notes. I'm not usually big on things this powdery, so I'm impressed at how much I like this. It's quite pleasant. It doesn't make me feel any big feelings or paint a dramatic picture, it's just pleasant. I can see why this one is popular. It's good for if you just want to smell nice. I'm tempted to write it off for not being very exciting, but it's definitely worthy of being given attention to its nuances. It's classy. Warm. The vanilla starts to come out more as it wears, which is no surprise on me. It's gently sweet and nice. Just a whisper of sweetness. This really is so likable, but I don't think it's compelling enough for me to want to buy a bottle. It'd be a great signature scent for someone wanting one lovely scent to wear in any situation. This is both elegant and effortless. Keeps getting prettier and prettier. My cat seems fond of this one, he keeps sniffing my wrist lol. A couple hours in and this is just lovely. No longer powdery, just smooth and alluring. It really makes me wish likable were enough for me, but I know myself better than that. Eventually fades to a very soft vanilla.

Verdict: 4/5 - It's really nice. I kind of want to test this side by side with Arashiyama.

**Ruslan** (EDP) *Black spruce, smoky opopanax, oud, fresh cedar, hinoki, oakmoss, dry fir needles, frankincense, black tea*: Medicinal, initially. Apparently I'm into that right now. I think it's the black spruce? There's a gentle waft of something sticky as it dries, with a sweet tinge. Like very dark sap. I love a sap note. This is a deep, dark forest. I like this. I'm a pretty easy get when it comes to forest scents and this is a pleasant one. I won't need a bottle of this (I already own a forest scent that I'm obsessed with), but it's fun to try. While the medicinal note is interesting, it's not always smoothly blended as the scent wears on. As the medicinal quality mellows, I can start to get a hint of black tea. It's quite nice.

I start to lose the forest after a while? Like there's wood, but not in an atmospheric tree sort of way anymore. Still pleasant, but almost generically so. Brightens up the longer it wears, like sun breaking through the branches to cut a swath of light onto the forest floor. There's a shadowy sweetness to it too, like the way shaded places can smell noticeably cooler. No matter one's opinions on gender, this smells distinctly unisex. On a woman or a man, this is mysterious and rich.

Woah, where did the forest go? The wafting scent from this is almost fruity now. I like it, but what an unexpected turn of events. It's warm, almost stewed fruit. Non-specific and not at all syrupy. Almost citrusy? But not? Fresh. Clean. Where did fresh and clean come from??? Then just a wisp of smoke at the end? Into something softly candy-like? What an interest journey. My wife might like this. I should offer this sample to her.

Verdict: 3.5/5 - The way this changes is very fun and unexpected. Might be a 4 if I were in a better mood for it.

**Solovey** (EDP) *Black amber, crushed violets, black currants, dark espresso, labdanum, black agarwood, tobacco*: Huh. This smells BIZARRE at first. Gothic play-doh? I see people compare scents to play-doh sometimes, but I dunno if this is what they mean. Gah, this is weird. It's almost plastic smelling, but that's not it. I don't see this settling down into something that's for me, but we'll see. It smells like the notes are all clashing just a bit. It's not even that unpleasant, I think it's just that there's no note that really stands out as one that I'm excited about. Smelling this feels like sampling designer scents, where I tend to get a little overstimulated by how much is happening in the scents, while also being understimulated by the absence of a focal point. Once this is wound down it's kind of warm and pleasant, but still doesn't smell anything like what I'd guessed it might. I think this one might be better appreciated by someone into more traditional perfume scent structures than I am. There were points where it smelled... expensive, in a way I can't articulate. I'm just not the target audience for this one.

Verdict: 2/5 - I just don't know about this one. I wish it had both more and less going on. It would be a 1 for me, but I didn't scrub it because I wanted to know how it would develop.

**Stolas** (EDP) *Bluebells, an unburnt cedar offering, cool night air, lavender, soft owl feathers, blueberries, & a hint of dark chocolate*: It's a bit sour right off the bat. Boozy. Like an espresso martini? I'm not generally into boozy scents. There's something so familiar about this though. The chocolate smells quite like coffee to me initially, but does mellow pretty quickly. It's all a tiny bit sharp. I don't hate it, but it's not how I think I want to smell. I do appreciate the way the floral note is blended in. I get the blueberry, but it's not juicy. It's dry. I dunno, the more this settles, the more I don't hate it. I don't mean this in a bad way, but I keep thinking about potpourri. But like... masculine potpourri, maybe? The more masculine this gets as it wears, the more I think I'll like it, but I wish that sharp boozy note would see itself out. I wish it was smoother. Aside from that, this is actually getting pretty good. There's a lotttt of boozy potpourri wafting from this, which is kind of nice in its way, but isn't something that excites me right now. Unique, but not in a way that's for me.

Verdict: 3/5 - Not for me, but it's kind of an interesting one. It's also just not at all what I'm looking for right now. At points it was maybe a 2, just because of how boozy it is.

**Surem** (oil) *Honeysuckle, cedar, labdanum, myrrh, creosote bush, musk, and tobacco evoke the rich and complex scent of the warm Sonoran sun*: I really enjoy the dry spiciness of this one. It's well balanced and complex. Usually I'm not a big fan of tobacco, but this is quite subtle and feels way more balanced than I'm used to in every other tobacco fragrance I've smelled. It's used for atmospheric complexity instead of feeling like I'm being nuked with it. What a delightful freebie. So warm. Golden. I appreciate this one extra when testing it alongside scents where the spiciness feels absent; Surem fills that void and I'm so thankful for it in the moment. But on its own it's not as exciting as it needs to be for me to want to buy a bottle.

Verdict: 3.5/5 - I like it, but I wouldn't choose it over things I love.

**Vasilisa** (EDP) *Clover honey, neroli, rich tonka, chamomile, dry hay, a flower crown of marigolds & sunflowers*: Ohhhhh the honey note. Gorgeous. This is pure sunshine and a daydream of a picnic in a meadow. Lying on a handmade quilt, watching clouds drift across the sky. Nowhere to be and fully present in the moment. The hay and flowers keep this warm and ensure the honey doesn't go too sweet. The tonka is just right. The chamomile is so relaxing. Fantome is going to take all my money, isn't it? My love for this is immediate. This scent feels like memories of contentment. It's incredible to find that feeling captured in a bottle. Can't stop smelling this one. I think I'll mourn it when it's gone. Is there a world in which I don't buy this one? That's hard to imagine. After a while the beeswax of the honeycomb becomes slightly more prominent, but softens as time goes on, as if melting against the warmth of skin. The whole scent mellows down to such a warm, lovely honeyed sweetness.

Additional thoughts on a dedicated wear: Now that I'm testing it on its own, I immediately detect more of the meadowy hay and warm florals beneath the clover honey. This is just... contentment. That's still the all-consuming feeling. I love this so much. I keep saying that Baba Yaga is my favorite because it's so captivatingly unique, but Vasilisa evokes the biggest emotional response. And who wouldn't be instantly addicted to having contentment captured in a bottle? I'm in awe of this one. This is witchcraft. People love to frame witchcraft as dark and menacing, but this feels truer. This is magic for sure, the most optimistic kind. The scent only shifts in subtle ways, overall it's quite linear. Excellent longevity. Lasts all day.

Verdict: 5/5 - The way this one makes me feel, I think to never smell it again would send me into mourning. I have to have it. It's incredible.

General thoughts:

I'm utterly in love with the Slavic Fairy Tale scents as a collection. They feel so cared for and deeply considered. They belong together. While they're distinctly different, there are little dots to connect the stories, referencing each other in subtle, elegant ways. It's so impressive. I'm SO glad I got a full sample set of them to try all together. The experience of them as a collection is much better than if I'd split them up into scattered individual picks. I'd have missed out on the overall story and I'm so enjoying that aspect.

I'm in trouble. I like too many of these scents too much. I dunno what I'm gonna do. Well, I mean, I'm gonna get Baba Yaga. And Vasilisa. I know that. Probably Lyudmila. But alsoooo I really love Lymphae and Kinmokusei? Olwyn isn't out of the running either. In the future I'd even consider dabbling in mini sizes of Marya Morevna, Morozko, or Finist The Falcon. Especially if re-wears of Marya Morevna go well; that one is so cool.

Guess this is my favorite house. I thought I was picky, but I'm feeling pretty easy right now.

Any recs for things I didn't try? I'd truly love to sample their entire catalogue. I was so close to swapping in Lycanthrope, Olympias, Lorelei, or Tatami. And everything else sounds interesting too.",18,1739074807.0,Indiemakeupandmore,2,1.0,False

This has been my living space for awhile now and I like parts of the direction but it feels a tad lifeless and stuffy (the plants in the picture have long since kicked it) 

Things I’m considering:
- adding more ambient lighting to relax it - just not sure where to put it 
- changing the coffee table for something more practical / casual 
- changing the rug / curtains to something a bit livelier since the walls are neutral 
- adding back the plants 
- adding more wall art - especially above the couch 


Any other thoughts or ideas would be much appreciated! Going for a practical, relaxing, laid back and less stuffy look overall with some nice details ",1,1739074611.0,InteriorDesign,1,1.0,False

I even try and stick to less junk food more keto now and tbh I just want a week without this I’m never fully healed it’s always almost healed and then bam I have to stay up a little later to study for my classes, or I drink some coffee, or I go out till 11 and have a drink with my friends  and I get a horrible outbreak to the point where it’s bleeding. This is my life now virtually anything and everything a college student dose will cause me a outbreak. I haven’t been able to date or go out for too long because that could also trigger a outbreak and frankly I’m not ready to disclose if I can’t even get it under control and being constantly contagious. I should be living a better life now but shit always the same eveything just progressively gets worse. This has been my life since October and I’m basically just learning how to live with the virus constantly being active and causing my outbreaks after outbreak nonstop. I don’t even remember what life is like without an outbreak and I don’t know how much longer I can last like this. See some hope with clinical trials and I’ll try to do more advocacy but if nothing changes by the time I’m 21 I’m just done because I don’t want life a life like this I can’t take it its driving me insane and I just can’t do this any longer the a year or two.
