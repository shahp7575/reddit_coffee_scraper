Afraid to mess it up,"So I (30M) matched with this woman (31F) last week on a dating app. Yesterday we finally met. I have to admit it was the first date I had in my life, but from my perspective it was amazing! 

Originally we wanted to go for a walk, but since I had a 2 hours commute to her city she suggested to have a coffee instead to recharge. I was there earlier, practiced greeting her in her mother tongue because I thought it might be nice, messed up and didnt go through with it because of nervouseness when she appeard, but joked about it afterwards. We laughed and chattet about various things. Some moments of awkward silence (since I didnt know what to say, I am awkward sometimes.) just looking at each other. She was smiling and laughing nearly the whole time. The place was about to close, so we left and we walked to the train station together. It was raining slightly, but I had an umbrella with me which I held for her to protect her from the rain. When we arrived whe hugged, said goodbye, then she asked when my train leaves, I told her its okay she can leave, but her bus would also take 30 more minutes, so we waited together there until she had to leave. We hugged again and then parted ways.

On my way home she actually messaged me, saying that she hoped I got home safely and that it was nice to meet me, which I responded to that it was nice to meet her to, that it way a lovely evening and that I would love to see her again. She said that she is glad I also enjoyed the evening and something like ""let's see when we can meet again"". She also told me happily that she is invited for a job interview (it was a topic we talked about and its really important for her). We exchanged some messages of reassurance, I asked her when the interview is so I can cheer her on that day, she said that she has to choose between a few options and she will let me know once she figured out her schedule. I messaged her some words of reassurance, and today in the morning she just thanked me, said its kind of me and that she'll do her best.

So my instincts right now are, first of all, I am not sure if she is really 100% sure if she wants to see me again, but even if she does, right now that job interview is very important to her and she is very busy with it for the coming week. So I want to give her some space and not pressure her by talking about a second date. So my instinct is to leave it at that and wait for her to let me know when she has her interview, maybe in a day or two check in with her how its going?

But I met with some friends yesterday in a bar after coming back, and two of my friends (both women by the way) said that she expects me to plan a second date and I should message her about it today or tomorrow. Since I am so inexperienced I am usually more inclined to take advice, but it does not feel right...

I dont want to mess this up, she was amazing. I am actually a bit anxious about it. When should I ask her for a second date? Or should I do it at all? We are still just on the app, didnt exchange phone numbers or anything, is that a bad sign?",1,1757755036.0,dating_advice,10,1.0,False

What to do?,"My wife had a traumatic past. Born in a village in Russia, in the early 90s. Violent stepdad, mentally ill mother. Ab#sed physically all the time and forced to raise at just 9 years old her baby sister. Be--aten, thrown out at night during harsh winters, emotionally ab\*sed, terr0rised. At 13 she ras r\* ped by a man in his 50s. It hapepened several times. At 14 it happened again with another man. She was bullied at school for being a h...e. She told me she was brutally r\* ped an gang r p\*ed several times until she ran away at 18. She got a job as a stri pper and started dating a guy who was 40 who was bea-ting her and she ended up in hospital several times. She tried to end her life 3 times for the first time at just 14. She asked her aunt for help when she was 17 and that aunt tried to talk her into pr0stitution.

So a very trau-matic upbringing. I met her when she was 21. I was 26. She was working at the canteen of the industrial plant I work at as an engineer.

We got married 2 years later. My mother cut contact with me because I married someone without a real education and she also heard stuff about her past. Financially we are doing very well. I am in my 30s now and already got promoted to technical plant manager and make lots of money. I try to offer her the queen treatment. And she deserves it. She is amazing and I wouldn't have made it without her support. We have a 3 years old son and her depression is back. She had had episodes in the past but with meds and therapy she managed to overcome them. Now its really bad. She had inward treatment for 2 weeks. And is not back home but she barely eats, I feed her myself, I begged her to shower yesterday, she lost her job at the coffee shop she worked at because she didn't go for days. She tried to cut her..... wrists with our 3 years old in the next room. This is when I took her by force to hospital and they kept her for 2 weeks. She adores our son and is a great mother but I am afraid of leaving him with her. I want to pay a nanny and she started crying that I will cheat on her. I would never, I love her.

But I love my little son too and I am afraid for his safety. I cannot take any days off right now as we are in a a critical situation at the plant and I am responsible for over 280 people. He can stay at the day care until 5PM. But I can leave only at 6PM. I order food every day because she doesn't cook. She just lays in bed all day and cries and repeats she wants to d... ie.

Today when I touched her (arm around shoulders) she jumped. She said its her body and she doesn't want people to touch her body and pushed me away and crawled into the corner. I am lost and exhausted

1nfstk6,https://www.reddit.com/r/sprinklesprinkle/comments/1nfstk6/shera_seven_tips_that_caught_my_attention_when_i/,Shera Seven tips that caught my attention when I first discovered her content,"* A 3 can turn into 10 real quick with a wig and some make up.” -SheRaSeven1
* You’ve got to put yourself together enough to compete with the next woman who has her game already together. You can’t just attract a wealthy man because you ‘feel’ you deserve one.
* You can’t walk out of the house looking crazy or trashy. You’ve got to upgrade the areas that you know you need to work on. Upgrade your looks and yourself esteem. Look good. Smell good. Speak well. You may need to change your hair, make up and clothing to attract the man you want.
* If you’re not an expert at make-up application, watch YouTube videos to learn how to apply it.
* Dress as a classy, sophisticated woman, who’s wife material. Your look will prove your worth and broke men won’t approach you because they know you’re going to reject them.
* Go to fund raisers, go to nice restaurants and sit at the bar. Go to business networking events and seminars. Go to events at the museum, if you want a cultured man. Go to nice hotels in affluent areas and have dinner at the restaurant. When you go out, go alone.
* Women talk too much. Don’t tell your whole life story. This is why you get dumped after 3 dates. It’s not interesting. When gold digging, silence can be golden. Every word you say on a date should be strategic. Surprise them. Be mysterious and sexy—yet classy.
* In your seductive talk, tell him something like, “I can’t wait to tell you about all the stuff I want to do to you. I promise ou’ve never experienced what I’m going to do to you.” Throw in some seductive behavior such as: Kissing him cheek, putting your tongue in his ear or touching his nipple over his shirt. Then pull back and tell him, “No, no. I want you to wait. I want you to suffer by waiting first. I want you to want me so bad.” In one or two days, text him and ask him, “Are you suffering? How bad do you want me? Tell me.” If they think you’re freaky or kinky they’ll wait longer.
* Make them feel good about themselves. Always leave them wanting more and they’ll be like putty in your hands. Compliment him on their clothes, smile, etc. “You’re so strong. You’re so handsome. You’re so smart. You smell so good” Compliment him in front of the waiter and other people. “He’s so good to me.” Whisper something seductive and dirty to him at the end of a date (and spontaneously/unexpectedly at other times). Tell him that you can’t wait to see him again. You’ve got to act. You want him to associate you with pleasure and happiness. Let go of being shy and seduce your way to what you want. Go to places where there’s shopping and restaurants. Use this time to both show what you want, be seductive to get a response and as a response to what he does. Don’t try to impress him or bore him by talking too much.
* ***Don’t be so serious. Let go of your serious business/intellectual talk. If he feels that you are smarter than him, he’ll feel that you won’t need him. This threatens his masculinity. Be the most exciting thing in his life. Be fun and unpredictable. So, let him feel like he’s teaching you things. This plays to his ego. Get him hooked on you.***
* The ultimate goal is to not get upset when a man doesn’t meet your expectations. Remember what I said at the beginning of this book: Go into relationships and dating with goals NOT expectations.
* Have short term goals. Once you achieve them move on to other goals and this keeps you from falling in love too fast.
* Make him think that marriage is the last thing on your mind. If you're too easy, they won’t chase you. They're chasing the woman who doesn't answer their calls or texts.
* You can get a little emotionally attached only after they become emotionally attached to you first.
* Get him emotionally attached by getting him alone and seducing him. Get him hooked with a weekend vacation. Lingerie (fetishes?) Blow his mind...then pull back (be busy all the time) Do this because ***men fall in ""lust"" first before falling in ""love."" You've got to be the best he's ever had sexually. Study on techniques. Read The Art of Seduction. Turn him out. Put it on him like he's never had it before.***
* **Getting to commitment mentally** : But if you do want to be exclusive, Make him see himself with you long term. Paint a picture of your life together when you’re with him. Say, “I’m imagining us at the beach” “I can see us during the holidays.” Then he will see himself in your vision in a relationship with you. If you know the law of attraction, you know that visions become reality. Plant the seed in his mind of being a couple with you. Couple the coupling visions with sex and seduction.
* Don’t do coffee dates. You’re worth more than $4.75.
* Do realize the importance of your appearance. You don’t have to be a perfect 10 in the looks department or be 25 years old, but you must look your best at all times.
* Do expand and upgrade where you hang out. Go to places in affluent areas. Go where wealthy people go.
* This table that men are speaking of represents a relationship. But a relationship is not a potluck dinner and you don't bring anything because in this circumstance you are the guest of honor. You bring yourself to the table and that's what you need to tell him. If you begin explaining what you bring to the table then you've already lost. The moment you open your mouth and start explaining what you are bringing to a grown man, you’ve already lost. They’ll stop asking it if you stop answering it.",2,1757754411.0,sprinklesprinkle,3,1.0,False

1nfsq9d,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Keyspace_realestate/comments/1nfsq9d/familyfriendly_areas_in_dubai_for_longterm/,Family-Friendly Areas in Dubai for Long-Term Residents: Best Places to Settle,"  
Finding the [best place to live in Dubai as a family](https://keyspacedubai.com/best-place-to-live-in-dubai/) can feel like a challenge at first, but the city is filled with communities designed for comfort, safety, and long-term living. Parents are often drawn to Dubai because it offers more than just housing. It combines excellent schools, modern healthcare, world-class entertainment, and green spaces that allow families to live with both convenience and quality of life. For many long-term residents, investing in Dubai’s real estate market is not just about property value but about creating a stable home where children can thrive.

# Exploring the Best Place to Live in Dubai with Family

When families begin their search, they usually look for three things: a secure neighborhood, nearby schools, and a strong sense of community. Dubai delivers on all three, and each neighborhood brings its own flavor to family life. From quiet suburban-style living to beachside communities, the city has options for every type of lifestyle.

# Arabian Ranches: Suburban Comfort

Arabian Ranches has earned its reputation as one of the best places to live in Dubai for families. Designed as a gated community, it offers villas with large floor plans, lush landscaping, and family-friendly facilities. Imagine a Saturday morning where kids can cycle safely along wide paths, parents enjoy a coffee at a local café, and families gather at one of the many parks for picnics. Beyond lifestyle perks, Arabian Ranches provides easy access to some of the best schools in Dubai, making it a practical choice for parents who want both comfort and convenience.

# Dubai Hills Estate: A Growing Favorite

Another standout community is Dubai Hills Estate, a development that blends modern housing with green open spaces. The centerpiece of the area is Dubai Hills Park, a massive green expanse that families use for everything from jogging to weekend picnics. Parents also appreciate the easy access to nurseries, international schools, and healthcare centers. The nearby Dubai Hills Mall adds another layer of convenience with shopping, dining, and entertainment. For families looking to balance modern living with a peaceful environment, Dubai Hills Estate is quickly becoming one of the most popular areas in Dubai.

# Mirdif: Traditional Meets Modern

For those who want a more traditional neighborhood feel without breaking the bank, Mirdif is a solid option. Known for its affordability compared to upscale areas, Mirdif has long attracted families who want spacious homes at a reasonable cost. The area features multiple parks, playgrounds, and schools, along with Mirdif City Centre mall for shopping and dining. Unlike some of Dubai’s newer developments, Mirdif has a well-established community vibe that makes it attractive to long-term residents. Families who prefer quieter, less crowded surroundings often find Mirdif to be the best place to live in Dubai.

# Jumeirah: Beachside Lifestyle

For families who love the sea, Jumeirah is hard to beat. This neighborhood offers villas just steps away from the beach, allowing children to grow up with the sand and water practically at their doorstep. Beyond the scenery, Jumeirah is filled with high-quality schools, medical centers, and lifestyle facilities. On weekends, families often gather at the beach, while during the week, parents enjoy easy access to shops, cafés, and cultural attractions. The combination of beachside living and top-notch facilities makes Jumeirah a popular choice for expat and local families alike.

# The Villa: Spacious Homes for Larger Families

Families looking for more space often consider The Villa community. Known for its large homes, quiet surroundings, and suburban feel, it provides the room to grow that larger families need. While it is slightly further from central Dubai compared to some other communities, its affordability and spacious layouts make it an appealing option. The Villa also provides easy access to main highways, so residents remain connected to the rest of the city. With schools and family facilities nearby, it checks all the boxes for families seeking a long-term home.

# Why Families Choose Dubai

Dubai has become one of the world’s top destinations for long-term living, especially for families. Safety is one of the biggest draws, as the city is consistently ranked among the safest in the world.

1nfsq44,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1nfsq44/broken_relationships/,Broken relationships,"I don't know where to begin to post here.    From a young age  I was affected by the broken relationship of my parents.  I've experienced some bad abuse.    When I grew up, I married someone for the wrong reasons, and we has a child and they experienced abuse from others..   We later divorced.  

I tried to become a Christian, but my mental health was very poor.    Someone tried to exorcise me and that didn't go well.   So many people say that Jesus helps them.    I did feel alright for a little while, although I was taking medication, going to church.    However, I think the church I was at wasn't healthy too.    

I couldn't seem to get that off my mind as I moved to different churches.    I couldn't seem to move forward.   I didn't feel accepted by some people at church.   I'm overweight, the medication changed my metabolism and I comfort ate, sometimes binging.    I thought I was accepted by one woman, although I wasn't sure if her husband did, but the relationship broke down.      

People kept telling me to read the bible, and pray.   However, I was getting in a muddle with the bible.    Some bible studies seemed too fast and some seemed biased towards popular teachers that I wasn't sure about.     Finally, I rejected books I thought were written by Paul.   I thought I was distracted from Jesus teachings.

Throughout all of this from time to time I would get troubled by loneliness and voices.     

I know the bible is not innerrant, because there's been lots of different translations.   However I do think there are some good teachings in it.   

Having recovered some memories of abuse, I'm estranged from all my family.    Also, when mentally ill, I said some awful things.

I'm a lot more stable these days, but I don't know what to do.   I think my child who has grown up may be in trouble spiritually.

I'm not sure what to do.    I tried going to a church coffee morning yesterday and it was uncomfortable because I wasn't sure i should be there.   It felt too formal for me.     

How has God helped you through knowing Jesus?     Could there be a way forward for me?

# Prologue:

The rain sliced through the town’s streets like knives, drowning everything in grey. It was a night bodies didn’t belong outside. Drops pounded against the asphalt, rhythmic and relentless, like a countdown to something irreversible.

Under the skeletal branches of an old sycamore, where children used to swing high above the whispering grass, a figure lay motionless. Rain drummed against her clothes, seeping into the fabric like cold fingers searching for lost secrets. Her eyes - once bright, according to the people that knew her - stared blankly upward now, as if questioning why the stars weren’t visible through the storm’s shroud.

A piece of paper clung to her dampened clothes, blank except one short phrase: *Be afraid*. No signature. No explanation. Just that cold warning like a door slammed shut.

The killer watched from the shadows beyond the tree’s dark silhouette. Had they lingered too long? Rain distorted sounds; the streetlamps cast fractured halos like broken dreams. They’d done it clean. Precise. Where would the threads lead?

Wind rustled above; water pattered relentlessly. For a moment, it seemed the only heartbeat was rain’s cold percussion. Then…silence. Heavy as the secrets that behold the century old Stonehenge.

The darkness swallowed intent, motive, identity. Left only that note - typed sentinel guarding what lay broken beneath the sycamore.

This is the part where chapter 1 is supposed to start, but you see; this isn’t just any murder mystery, this isn’t even a murder mystery. Just murder. Cold blooded murder. That beautifully written prologue is my perspective, me being the killer. That's what the whole story is going to be like. For the sake of the story, you will know me as Chloe.

 And I know you’re all waiting for a character description, so here it is: *‘My name is Chloe, and my surname…it’s not important. I’m 16 years old. Yes, 16 years old. I know what you’re thinking, “Why is a 16 year old girl killing people? That’s some very concerning behaviour.” Yes, I know that’s concerning behaviour. But I didn't ask for your opinion, did I? Anyways, you can imagine my looks however you want, i’m not sure i care. But please, don’t let your imagination get too wild.’*

Did you enjoy the description? Was it good enough for you lesser minds? Well, guess what? I don’t care. Now how about we jump into chapter one before I bore you with my non-stop yapping? Sound good? Glad to hear.

# Chapter 1: The news:

The rain was a good alibi. It was a dark, wet curtain that hid a multitude of sins and washed away a fair amount of evidence. I pulled my hood up tighter, the fabric scraping against my ear as I turned and walked away from the sycamore. The body was a problem for someone else now, someone who would find it, or not find it, in the morning. My work was done.

My mind felt clear, not cold, just… efficient. The pounding in my chest was gone, replaced by the steady, quiet thrum of a mission accomplished. The streetlights bled their fractured light onto the pavement, and I stepped through one halo after another, each one a little less broken than the last. I was just a girl walking home in the rain. Just a girl with a conscience clean as the freshly washed asphalt.

A small, satisfying weight bounced in the pocket of my coat. I didn’t think about what it was, not really. It was just a thing I had to dispose of. Not a murder weapon, not a tool, just a loose end. A few blocks down, I came to a city trash can, brimming with the day’s refuse. A quick, practiced motion and the weight was gone, tumbling down into the muck. The rain would finish the job, and the sanitation department would take care of the rest.

I turned onto my street, where the houses were uniform and the porch lights were a comforting, golden glow. My own house, number 14, stood there, a beacon of bland, suburban normalcy. The kind of place where nothing bad ever happened. The kind of place a killer would live.

I let myself in through the back door, the familiar squeak a welcome sound. The warmth of the house hit me, smelling of stale air and something my mother had cooked for dinner. I left a trail of small puddles on the kitchen tile as I peeled off my wet clothes, stuffing them into a plastic grocery bag. I tied the bag with a sharp twist and carried it to the basement. The laundry machine sat waiting, a dull, white monolith. I threw the bag inside, started the spin cycle, and tossed the shoes on top. The whirring of the machine filled the silence, and I knew the rain wasn’t the only alibi I had. The mundane was just as good.

Upstairs, I took a shower, letting the hot water sluice over my skin. I scrubbed and scrubbed until the water ran clear. The water felt good. The steam fogged the mirror, and I couldn’t see my face, but I knew what I would see if I could. The same face that had stared out from the shadows. The same face that would be sitting at the breakfast table in the morning, asking if anyone had seen the news.

The morning came with the sound of my mother's humming and the smell of sizzling bacon. A normal Tuesday. I woke up to the sun streaming through my window, a stark contrast to the previous night's gloom. I felt… rested. It was a surprise. No dreams, no nightmares, no lingering dread. Just the quiet hum of the house and the steady rhythm of a life that felt a million miles away from the one I had lived just a few hours ago.

I pulled on a pair of jeans and a simple t-shirt, brushing my hair until it lay flat. My reflection stared back, the same face I saw every day. No dark circles, no guilt in my eyes, just a pair of regular, green eyes that looked a little too wide, maybe. I shrugged. No one would notice. They never did.

""Chloe, breakfast!"" my mother called from downstairs. Her voice was cheerful, oblivious. I took a deep breath, pasted on my best teenager-at-school face, and headed down.

My father was already at the kitchen table, reading the newspaper. My mother was at the stove, a spatula in her hand. The television in the corner was on, the sound low, a morning news program droning on about traffic and the weather.

""Good morning, sweetheart,"" my dad said, folding his paper. ""Sleep well?""

""Fine,"" I said, grabbing a plate and serving myself a couple slices of bacon. ""You?""

""Couldn't be better,"" he said, smiling. He turned back to his paper, and I sat down, picking at my food. The conversation was small, predictable. It was a performance I had perfected over sixteen years.

Then, the low drone of the television changed. The anchor's voice became more serious, the music shifting to a somber, urgent tone. My mother stopped humming.

""...a body was discovered early this morning in a downtown park. Police have not released the victim's identity, but are asking for anyone with information to come forward. The victim appears to be a young woman, and a note was found at the scene, though police would not disclose its contents.""

The camera showed a grainy, zoomed-in shot of the sycamore. The yellow tape stood out starkly against the wet ground. The sight of it felt like watching a movie I'd already seen.

""Oh, my God,"" my mother whispered, her hand going to her mouth. ""That's just terrible. Right here in our town. I wonder who it was.""

I looked at her, then at my dad, who was frowning, his newspaper forgotten. I made my face go blank, a perfect canvas of concern.

""What a psycho,"" I said, and the words tasted like ash. My parents looked at me, not with suspicion, but with a shared, parental sadness. I had played my part perfectly.

My performance continued through breakfast, through my ride to school, and into the crowded hallways of Northwood High. The morning air was thick with whispered theories, fragments of the news report passed from locker to locker like a secret virus. It was all so… predictable. They talked about the note, the rain, and the 'psycho' who could do such a thing. They talked about it with a morbid fascination, a thrill that was entirely foreign to me.

I walked to my locker, the scent of damp wool and cheap perfume filling the air. My best friend, Maya, was leaning against it, her brown hair a tangled mess and her eyes wide.

""Chloe, did you hear?"" she said, her voice a hushed urgency. ""They found a body downtown. A girl. I live right near the park. I walked right by it this morning before the tape was up, and I didn't even notice a thing. What if she was one of our classmates?""

I opened my locker, a practiced combination of clicks and clacks. ""Maybe,"" I said, my voice as neutral as I could make it. ""It's awful, though.""

Maya shivered. ""My mom says we should stay away from the park. She says it's not safe.""

I nodded, pretending to be concerned. ""Yeah, I guess not."" I grabbed my textbooks, the familiar weight a small comfort. It was the only honest thing in this whole charade.

I looked at Maya. She was just a regular girl, terrified by something that had happened to someone else. I wondered, just for a moment, what she would do if she knew. What they would all do. My mother, my father, Maya.

The bell rang, and the hallway traffic surged. It was time for the first period. It was time to go to class and pretend to be a normal teenager. The world went on, oblivious. They didn't know I was the reason their world had shifted, just a little, on a Tuesday morning. And I knew, with a certainty that was as cold and clear as the rain, that they never would.

My first class was English, and as I settled into my desk, I felt a familiar relief. The rhythm of school was a dependable lie. The teacher, Mr. Harrison, was talking about figurative language. The irony was so rich, I almost smiled. He wrote a sentence on the board: ""The boy’s heart hammered like a drum."" Everyone scribbled it down. I wrote it down, too. My heart, I thought, had simply hummed. It had been a different kind of percussion, less frantic, more… purposeful.

I looked around the room. A few people were still whispering about the murder, their faces a mix of fear and morbid excitement. I saw the girls in the front row, their hair perfect, their clothes brand-new. I knew them. They were the popular ones, the ones who always seemed to have the answers, the ones with a life as flawless as a magazine cover. The girl under the sycamore, her eyes staring blankly at the stormy sky, had been one of them. A queen of a small kingdom that no longer existed for her.

My thoughts drifted to the note. *Be afraid.* It was simple, direct. A warning to anyone who might get in my way, a little gift for the detectives who would inevitably be stumped. It was a good touch. It elevated it from a simple act to something more… artistic.

The bell rang again, and the class scrambled to pack up. As I walked out, I saw her, a girl named Bethany, standing alone by her locker. She was a quiet girl, a loner. She wasn't talking about the murder. She was just looking at her phone, her face as neutral as my own. I paused for a second, a thought flickering in my mind. She was an outsider. Just like me. But she didn't have a secret. Not yet. I walked past her, my mind already working on a new rhythm. The mundane was an excellent alibi, but boredom was a different kind of sin entirely. It was time for a new project.

# Chapter 2: Bethany:

The next few days at school were a study in casual predation. My new project, Bethany, was an easy target. She was a ghost in the hallways, a flicker in the periphery of everyone's vision. She had no clique to protect her, no best friend to ask questions. She was a blank slate, and I was about to write on her.

I began with a slow, calculated approach. Not a sudden pounce, but a patient, circling motion. I noticed she ate her lunch alone, always in the same corner of the cafeteria. On Wednesday, I casually walked by her table, my lunch tray in hand. On Thursday, I walked by again, this time dropping a pencil. She didn't notice. Good. My presence was an easy ghost for her to ignore.

On Friday, the game changed. I had my lunch tray, a book clutched in my other hand, and a new strategy. I walked to her table, a small smile on my face. ""Do you mind if I sit here?"" I asked, my voice as neutral as I could make it. ""Everywhere else is full.""

Bethany looked up from her phone, her eyes wide and startled, as if she'd been caught doing something she wasn't supposed to. She looked around the cafeteria, her eyes confirming what she already knew. There were plenty of empty tables. She just looked at me, a flicker of suspicion in her eyes. I simply smiled again, a soft, friendly smile. The kind of smile a person can't say no to. The kind of smile that says, ""I'm a good person."" She shrugged a single shoulder, a small, barely perceptible motion. A silent invitation. I sat down.

The silence between us was heavy at first. She went back to looking at her phone, and I opened my book, pretending to read. The title of the book was a lie, of course. I wasn't really reading. I was watching her from the corner of my eye, taking in every detail. She had a small, faded scar on her cheek, a chipped fingernail, a phone case with a cartoon cat. She was perfectly, utterly unremarkable. A ghost, just as I had thought.

After a few minutes, she spoke, her voice barely a whisper. ""You're Chloe, right?""

""Yeah,"" I said, my voice warm and friendly. ""And you're Bethany. We have English together.""

She nodded. ""Mr. Harrison's class.""

""Yeah,"" I said, and a comfortable silence settled between us, the kind of silence that happens when two people are alone but not really together.

I had planned to leave it at that. Just a simple introduction, a foot in the door. But a thought, a new rhythm, came to me. ""What are you reading?"" I asked.

She held up her phone. ""Nothing. I'm just watching a show. It's a murder mystery.""

I almost laughed. The irony was so rich it was practically dripping from her lips. ""I love those,"" I said, a little too quickly. I had to rein it in, make it sound more... casual. ""I'm more into the psychology of it, you know? Why they do it.""

Bethany's eyes flickered to mine. A small smile, a real one this time, appeared on her face. ""Me too,"" she said. ""Everyone always wants to know who did it. I want to know what they were thinking.""

Bingo. She was exactly what I thought she was. A mirror, a reflection of me, just with a less... hands-on approach. I closed my book and put it back in my bag. I didn't need it anymore. I had found my way in.

""Well,"" I said, leaning forward. ""Do you have any theories?""

Her eyes lit up, and she began to talk. She was a different person now. She wasn't a ghost anymore. She was a girl, with a voice and a face and a secret fascination. She talked about motives, alibis, and the dark underbelly of human nature. She had no idea she was talking to a textbook, a living, breathing case study. I just listened, nodding along, her words a sweet, sweet sound to my ears. I had her. The game had just begun.

We continued to meet for lunch every day. Bethany was a font of knowledge about cold cases and true crime. She devoured documentaries and podcasts, and she had a file on her laptop dedicated to unsolved murders in neighboring towns. Her fascination was pure, an innocent curiosity about the dark side of humanity. She didn’t know she was sitting with a living, breathing case study.

""I think the detective missed a key piece of evidence,"" she said one afternoon, her eyes glued to her phone as she showed me a grainy photo of a crime scene. ""See this. It's too clean. There’s something missing from the narrative.""

I nodded, watching her, not the picture. ""And what do you think that is?""

""The *why*,"" she said, without looking up. ""The motive. Everyone always looks for the weapon and the means, but they never ask the right questions about the *why*. It's a story, a dark story, but it's still a story. And every story has a reason.""

Her words were a thrill, a new kind of high that was almost better than the murder itself. I was a story. A story she was trying to understand, with a motive she was dying to uncover. I was her project. And she didn't even know it.

""So what about the one here?"" I asked, my voice low. ""The girl in the park. What do you think her story is?""

Bethany’s face went pale. ""I… I don't know,"" she whispered. ""It's different when it’s so close to home. The news said they found a note, but they won't say what it said.""

My heart felt a small, pleasant thump. The kind of thump that meant I was in control. ""What do you think it said?""

She shook her head, her eyes wide with a mixture of terror and excitement. ""I can't imagine,"" she said. ""Something scary, I guess. Something from a book or a movie.""

I just smiled, a small, secret smile. The kind of smile that knew a secret. The kind of smile that belonged to a psycho.

And in that moment, I knew I had found my next collaborator. She wasn’t a witness. She wasn't a victim. She was something much more interesting. She was my muse.

The weeks that followed were a meticulous slow burn. Bethany and I fell into a routine. Lunch at school, then homework at my house after school, and sometimes a walk to the downtown coffee shop. Our conversations were an endless loop of cold cases, and I was a student, a sponge, soaking up every detail she shared. I let her do most of the talking, occasionally interjecting with a question that felt like a key turning in a lock.

""Do you think the killer ever feels anything after?"" I asked one day, as we sat in my room, surrounded by half-eaten chips and notebooks filled with algebra. ""Like, regret? Or is it just… nothing?""

Bethany paused her show, her eyes fixed on the screen. ""I think it has to be something,"" she said, her voice thoughtful. ""There's no such thing as 'nothing.' It's either relief, or… or a new kind of hunger.""

A shiver of genuine pleasure ran down my spine. She had no idea how close she was getting.

""What if we went to the park?"" I asked, the words coming out before I could think. It wasn't part of the plan, not yet. It was a test, a new thrill.

Bethany flinched, her face paling. ""What? No. Why?""

I shrugged, a casual motion that belied the thrumming excitement under my skin. ""To see it. To see what a real crime scene looks like after the fact. You talk about it all the time, but you've never been. It's like... a pilgrimage.""

She looked at me, her eyes darting between fear and an almost irresistible curiosity. The curiosity won. ""Okay,"" she said, her voice barely a whisper. ""But just for a minute. And only if we go during the day.""

I smiled, a victory smile. ""Of course. Tomorrow afternoon. After school. We can be our own detectives.""

The next day, as we stood under the sycamore, a ghost of yellow tape still clinging to its rough bark, Bethany looked at me, her face pale. The spot was empty now, just a patch of damp earth and a few fallen leaves. The rain had long since vanished, and the sun was a warm, gentle presence. Everything looked so normal. So innocent.

""It’s… so quiet,"" she said, her voice small. ""I thought it would feel different. I thought it would feel… haunted.""

I looked at the spot where the body had been, at the tree, at the world that had swallowed a secret. ""It's not haunted,"" I said, a little too loud, my voice raw and honest. ""It's just a place. The haunting is in the person who did it. The haunting is a story.""

Bethany looked at me, and for the first time, I saw a flicker of genuine fear in her eyes. Not the fear of a ghost or a psycho, but the fear of a person. She didn't say anything, but she took a small step back. And I knew, with the cold, clear certainty of a new project, that she had finally started to see me. The game had just begun. And this time, I wasn't just writing the story. I was about to write the ending.

# Chapter 3: The Haunted:

The next week was a dance of anticipation. I was a puppet master, and Bethany was a doll made of strings and dreams. She was so convinced we were bonded by our morbid curiosity that she didn't see the truth. She didn't see me watching her, taking notes. She didn't see the way I smiled to myself when she talked about her love of being a detective. It was so perfect, I almost wanted to leave a note saying, ""You played your part perfectly."" But that would be far too messy.

I started a new notebook, one with a blank cover and no name on it. In it, I began to outline my new project. It was a story, a dark one, and I was in charge of the plot, the characters, and the ending. I had a name for it: The Haunted. It was a perfect name. It had a nice ring to it.

The first step was to get Bethany to a place where no one would expect her to be. I knew she had a part-time job at the local library on the weekends. So I told her I was writing a story, a mystery, and I needed help with research. I told her I wanted to set a scene at the old abandoned house on the outskirts of town. It had been empty for twenty years, a forgotten relic of the town’s past. A perfect setting for a story that was about to unfold.

""Are you serious?"" she asked, her eyes wide with a mixture of fear and excitement. ""That place is spooky. People say it's haunted.""

""Exactly,"" I said, a small smile playing on my lips. ""It's the perfect place for my story. I need to get a feel for the setting. You could help me with that.""

She hesitated for a long moment, a flicker of genuine fear in her eyes. It was a beautiful thing to see. I had her. She was a detective, a true crime junkie, and this was an opportunity she couldn't pass up.

""Okay,"" she said, her voice a little shaky. ""But... we go during the day, right? And we don't go inside.""

I laughed, a warm, reassuring sound that was completely and utterly fake. ""Of course not. Just a quick walk around the property. We'll be in and out in an hour.""

The week crawled by, each day a new page in my outline. I spent my lunches alone, pretending to eat, but really I was running through scenarios. Would she resist? Would she fight? Would she cry? I had a plan for each of these. I had a plan for everything. The anticipation was a delicious, slow-burning fire in my veins. It was the thrill of the hunt, the thrill of the chase. The thrill of a story about to be told.

By Friday, I was so wired, so ready, I could barely sit still in class. I watched Bethany from across the room, her head bent over her notebook. I wondered what she was thinking. Was she scared? Was she excited? Was she already imagining herself as the hero of her own murder mystery? I hoped she was. It would make her final moments all the more delicious. I didn’t just want to kill her, I wanted to break her.

Saturday morning came with a bright, relentless sun. Bethany met me at the edge of the library parking lot. She looked nervous, her hands fidgeting with the strap of her bag. ""Are you sure about this?"" she asked, her voice a little too loud.

""Come on,"" I said, a little impatient now. I had to rein it in. ""We're not going to be gone long. We'll be back before your parents even notice you're gone.""

She nodded, and we started walking towards the outskirts of town, where the suburban landscape gave way to overgrown fields and trees. The pavement turned to dirt, and the air got a little colder. The old house stood in the distance, a dark silhouette against the bright, blue sky. It looked like a broken tooth in the mouth of the earth.

As we got closer, Bethany's steps faltered. ""I have a bad feeling about this, Chloe,"" she whispered. ""It's giving me the creeps.""

I just smiled, a small, secret smile. ""That's the point, Bethany. This is where the story gets good.""

We walked around the perimeter of the property. The house was even more decrepit up close, with broken windows that looked like vacant eyes and a porch that sagged like a broken spine. The air was heavy and still, the kind of stillness that feels like a held breath.

A few yards from the front door, half-hidden by a bush, was a small, overturned wooden chest. It looked like it had fallen from a window and landed with a thud, spilling its contents onto the long, dead grass. A few trinkets glinted in the sunlight, but what caught my eye was the half-open book lying next to it. Its pages were yellowed and water-stained, and the title was barely visible: *The Haunting of Northwood*.

""Look!"" Bethany said, her voice a hushed exclamation of pure, unadulterated delight. She forgot all about her fear, all about the 'creeps.' Her detective brain had taken over.

""Oh, my gosh,"" I said, feigning an awed gasp. ""Do you think... do you think it's a journal? From one of the people who used to live here?""

She didn't answer. She was already rushing toward the book, her eyes wide with a mix of thrill and professional curiosity. She picked it up with a reverence that was almost comical. She held the book carefully, as if it were a fragile bird.

""It looks so old,"" she said, her voice a whisper. She flipped through the pages, her face a mask of concentration. I watched her, a perfect, predatory calm settling over me. The trap was set. Now all I had to do was wait for her to fall into it.

""Bethany,"" I said, my voice barely above a whisper. ""Look.""

I pointed to a small, dark shape on the ground, partially covered by the overturned chest. Bethany's eyes followed my finger, and her hand went to her mouth. It was a tarnished silver key, and a small, rusted iron plate with the number '5' stamped on it.

""A key,"" she whispered. ""And a number. Do you think there's a locked room inside?""

I have many guy-friends who are my homies. But they aren't ""cute"" you know, and I am not gay so I don't find them cute either ways.


Now, guys though they pretend they are cool and tough, every guy has a small mischievous kid inside them (""Pretty Little Baby :)"") and that kid needs to come out from time to time.

And the only person who can bring that kid out is a girl (Ofc the right one 💀). Sometimes I just gotta relax after office. I have a guitar and I keep myself occupied with that. Mornings, I go to gym.


Doing all that and even doing decently at workplace does make me feel satisfied, but sometimes it just becomes monotonous. Only a girl-friend can bring some twist to it.

See frankly I am not looking to get into a relationship. I just feel that I'd like to be around someone who can bring that other shade out from me, and same I could do for her.

Yeah now the typical opinion that ""A girl and a boy can't be friends"". So yes to end that debate, I'll just agree and go with that idea. That means, I am open to a relationship, but not until we are fully compatible.

This concept of girl-friend has been orchestrated by me so as to bring a mediator between a friend who is a girl and a proper GF. This would be like friends with benefits. Obviously not those kinds 💀😂, but maybe who knows 🙃. Just kidding, I don't believe in premarital stuff or a live-in kind of thing. Many of this generation might find me boring or ""unc"" but I kind of believe in one life one love philosophy and the old school kind of love.

So let's say we'd be in talking stage, if someone hits me up and we vibe. If things work out well, we can plan a few coffee/dinner dates. If they don't, then we don't need to just be back to strangers again (ofc your choice), I am great being mutually connected via social media later on, without being emotionally attached.

Was that coffee shop where I had a great day? Did that park always make me anxious? My memory would fade and I'd lose those emotional connections to places.

So I built a simple web app over the weekend.



* Drop emoji pins anywhere on a map → capture how that place made you feel instantly
* Private by default → but you can share publicly if you want others to see
* No complex features, no social pressure. Just emotional geography.



I'm curious if anyone else has struggled with this ""place vs feeling"" connection.

Do you remember emotional associations with locations, or do they fade over time like mine?

Behind the shield and the bright blue eyes lies a heart that beats fiercest for Bucky Barnes, the boy he lost and the man he's found again.

Bucky, no longer Hydra's weapon but still haunted by fragments of his past, carries his scars in silence. Graceful where Steve is solid, vulnerable where Steve is steadfast, he is piecing together who he once was and who he wants to be. His piercing eyes hold both pain and hope, and in them, Steve sees the boy from Brooklyn he's always loved.

Together, they stand on the fragile line between past and present - one a super-soldier built to endure, the other a survivor learning how to live again. In the quiet moments between battles, they rediscover not just friendship, but a love that has waited decades to be named.

_____Chapter 1______






Rain lashed the safehouse windows like thrown gravel. Inside, the air hung thick with damp wool, stale coffee, and the low thrum of tension. Maps of Eastern Europe were pinned haphazardly across one wall, corners curling. Steve Rogers stood near a chipped laminate counter, the weak overhead bulb bleaching his blond hair almost white. He gripped a mug too tightly, the ceramic threatening to crack. His broad shoulders were a rigid line beneath his thin Henley.

""Easy there, Cap,"" Sam Wilson murmured, leaning against the doorframe to the cramped kitchenette. ""That mug didn't do anything to you."" He sipped his own coffee, eyes tracking Steve's restless energy. ""Still no sign of him?""

Steve shook his head, a sharp, frustrated jerk. His gaze kept flicking towards the hallway leading to the bedrooms. ""Three hours. In this."" He nodded towards the window where rain streamed down the glass, distorting the dim streetlights outside. ""He just... vanished after the briefing.""

""Vanished is Bucky's default setting lately,"" Natasha Romanoff observed calmly from the battered sofa. She was meticulously cleaning a Glock, her movements economical, precise. Her red hair was pulled back severely. ""Especially when Stark starts poking.""

Tony Stark, perched precariously on a rickety stool near the comms station, looked up from his tablet. ""Poking? I merely inquired about the structural integrity of his fancy new arm. Hydra engineering fascinates me. Besides, he bolted before I even got to the good questions about tensile strength versus vibranium resonance."" He waved a dismissive hand. ""Barnes is just twitchy. Like a feral cat.""

""He's processing, Tony,"" Steve ground out, the muscles in his jaw working. He set the mug down with a hard clunk, coffee sloshing over the rim. ""Something in that intel packet must have triggered him. Or someone."" His blue eyes, usually so clear, were stormy.

""Or maybe he just needed air,"" Sam offered reasonably. ""Crowded briefing. Heavy stuff about those old Hydra cells. Even without Stark's commentary.""

""He doesn't get to just disappear!"" Steve's voice rose, sharp enough to cut through the drumming rain. The sudden volume made Clint Barton, dozing in an armchair in the corner, jerk awake, blinking owlishly.

""Whoa. Okay."" Sam held up a placating hand. ""Point taken. But pacing a hole in the floor won't bring him back faster. He's got a tracker. We know the general area. He'll surface.""

Steve didn't answer. He turned his back on them, staring out into the rain-lashed darkness, his silhouette tense and imposing against the window. The air vibrated with his unspoken worry, a counterpoint to the storm.

The back door to the safehouse, shielded from the street by a narrow, garbage-strewn alley, slammed open with a crash that echoed off the wet brick walls. Bucky Barnes stumbled in.

Water streamed from his long, dark hair, plastering it to his skull and neck. He was shirtless, pale skin gleaming wetly under the harsh hallway light, muscles tense and defined across his chest and abdomen. Rainwater traced paths over old scars and the intricate plates of his gleaming left arm, which hung slightly loose at his side, fingers twitching erratically. He gasped for breath, his chest heaving, eyes wide and unfocused, darting around the dim hallway like a trapped animal's. He shuddered violently, a full-body tremor that had nothing to do with the cold.

""Bucky?"" Steve's voice, low and urgent, came from the end of the hallway. He'd moved silently, instantly alert to the sound of the door.

Bucky flinched as if struck. He pressed his back hard against the damp wall beside the door, water smearing the peeling paint. His gaze snapped to Steve, filled with raw panic. He didn't speak, just panted, pushing himself harder against the surface as if trying to melt into it. His metal arm whirred softly, a low, stressed mechanical purr.

Steve stepped forward, filling the narrow space. He moved slowly, deliberately, his tall frame blocking the retreat back into the alley, the hallway exit deeper into the house, and the doorway to the main room where the others had fallen silent. The storm raged behind him, casting his face in shadow, but his bright blue eyes were fixed on Bucky with fierce intensity. He didn't crowd him, not yet, but his presence was an undeniable wall.

""Buck,"" Steve repeated, his voice dropping to a near-rumble, rough with concern and something harder, more protective. ""Talk to me. What happened?""

Bucky shook his head jerkily, water droplets flying. He squeezed his eyes shut, then snapped them open, the panic still there, edged with something darker – guilt, maybe. Fear. His knuckles, where flesh met metal on his left hand, were bone-white. He tried to slide sideways along the wall, away from Steve, towards the dark living room, but Steve shifted subtly, cutting off that path too.

""Nowhere to run in here, pal,"" Steve murmured, the words thick. He took another cautious step closer. The air crackled between them, charged with the storm outside and the tempest within Bucky. The scent of rain, ozone, and Bucky's unique mix of gun oil and faint, clean sweat filled the cramped space.

""It's just me,"" Steve said, softer now. He kept his hands loose at his sides, palms open, non-threatening, but his posture remained unyielding. A sentinel. ""Just Steve.""

Bucky made a choked sound, part gasp, part sob. He pushed off the wall slightly, muscles coiling as if to bolt anyway, but Steve was suddenly right there, invading his space without touching him. He filled Bucky's vision, solid and real, the heat radiating off him a stark contrast to Bucky's rain-chilled skin.

""Look at me,"" Steve commanded, a low growl vibrating in his chest.

Bucky's head jerked up, his wide, vulnerable blue eyes locking onto Steve's. The fear was still there, screaming beneath the surface, but so was recognition. And something else. A flicker of the old Bucky, buried deep beneath the Winter Soldier and the guilt. The way he held himself – that slender, toned frame trembling, the graceful lines taut with panic, the beautiful, rain-slicked face etched with exhaustion and terror – it tore at Steve. Not fragility, but a profound, devastating vulnerability laid bare.

Steve reached out slowly, deliberately. Not to grab, not to restrain, but to offer. His large, calloused hand hovered near Bucky's arm, just above the gleaming seam where metal met scarred flesh.

""You don't have to run from me, Buck.""

His voice was gravel scraped raw. It wasn't a plea. It was a statement. An anchor thrown into Bucky's chaotic sea. The words hung in the damp, electric air between them, heavy with everything unspoken, everything remembered, everything possible.

Bucky froze. His breath hitched. His gaze dropped to Steve's hovering hand, then snapped back to his face. The panic warred with a desperate, fragile yearning. He didn't pull back. He didn't lean in. He just stood, trembling against the wall, caught in the gravity of Steve's presence. The rain hammered its relentless rhythm against the safehouse walls, the only sound in the suddenly silent hallway.

In the main room, Sam lowered his coffee mug slowly. Natasha had stopped cleaning her Glock, her green eyes sharp and focused on the hallway entrance, though she couldn't see the confrontation. Clint was fully awake now, leaning forward in his chair. Tony had lowered his tablet, his usual smirk replaced by a look of uncharacteristic stillness.

""Told you,"" Sam whispered, the words barely audible over the rain. ""Twitchy cat.""

Natasha's lips thinned slightly. ""More like a wolf backed into a corner. But Steve..."" She trailed off, her gaze thoughtful, calculating. ""He's the only one who doesn't see the teeth as a threat to him.""

Tony finally broke the silence, his voice uncharacteristically quiet, almost sober. ""Yeah. He sees something else entirely."" He tapped his tablet screen absently. ""Something worth getting bitten for."" He looked up, meeting Sam's eyes, a flicker of something like understanding, perhaps even reluctant respect, in his gaze. ""Guess that's why he's Captain America, huh?""

Sam just nodded, his eyes still fixed on the dark hallway where the real storm was raging. ""Yeah,"" he murmured. ""Guess it is.""

The silence in the main room felt brittle, broken only by the drumming rain and Bucky's ragged breathing echoing down the hallway. Sam's muttered comment hung in the air, met with Tony's uncharacteristically sober agreement. Inside the cramped corridor, the world had shrunk to the damp wall, the pounding storm, and the impossible space between Steve's outstretched hand and Bucky's trembling arm.

Steve didn't move. He held himself utterly still, a mountain rooted in the narrow passageway, his gaze locked on Bucky's face. The raw terror was still there, a feral glint in those wide blue eyes, but beneath it, Steve saw the fracture lines. Saw the exhaustion that went bone-deep, the confusion that twisted familiar features into a mask of anguish. The way Bucky's chest hitched, not just from the cold or the run, but from the internal pressure threatening to shatter him completely.

""Just me, Buck,"" Steve repeated, his voice a low thrum that vibrated through the humid air. Softer, this time. Gentle, but no less absolute. ""Nobody else. Just us.""

Bucky flinched again at the sound, a small, involuntary jerk of his head. His gaze darted past Steve's shoulder, towards the faint light spilling from the main room, then snapped back, wilder. He tried to press himself even flatter against the peeling paint, water dripping from his hair onto his bare shoulders. The whirring sound from his metal arm intensified, servos straining.

""Can't... Steve..."" The words were choked, barely audible over the rain. He shook his head again, violently this time, droplets flying. ""Saw... flashes. The briefing... Stark... god, the noise..."" He squeezed his eyes shut, teeth gritted against something only he could see or hear. A fresh tremor racked him, starting in his shoulders and running down his slick, lean frame to his clenched fists.

Steve didn't look away. He absorbed the words, the raw pain in them. Whatever Hydra ghost Tony's questions or the intel packet had summoned, it had Bucky cornered inside his own skull. The urge to simply grab him, pull him in, shield him from everything, was a physical ache in Steve's chest. But Bucky wasn't a mission objective. He was a live wire, sparking and dangerous.

He needed grounding. Something real. Something that wasn't memory or nightmare.

Holding Bucky's terrified gaze, Steve slowly, deliberately, lowered his hovering hand. He didn't grab. Didn't clasp. His movement was deliberate, unhurried, telegraphing his intention. His palm, broad and calloused, descended towards Bucky's left arm. Not the gleaming vibranium, but the scarred seam where cold metal met vulnerable flesh near the shoulder – the boundary line between what Hydra took and what Bucky was still fighting to reclaim.

Bucky's breath hitched audibly. His eyes widened impossibly further, tracking the descent of that large, steady hand. He stiffened, every muscle locking, bracing for impact or pain. The whirring in his metal arm stuttered, then rose to a frantic, high-pitched whine.

Steve touched his arm.

His fingertips made contact first. Flesh to flesh. The contact jolted through Bucky like an electric shock. He gasped, a sharp intake of breath that sounded almost like a sob. His body went rigid, coiled tight as a spring.

But Steve didn't flinch. Didn't pull away. His palm settled fully, warm and heavy and undeniably real, over the junction of scar tissue and living muscle just above the metal shoulder joint. The pressure was firm, grounding, a counterpoint to the chaos inside Bucky's head. It wasn't a restraint. It was an anchor.

For a heartbeat, Bucky remained frozen, eyes wide and unseeing, lost in whatever internal tempest raged. Then, the rigidity bled out of him in a sudden, violent rush. His shoulders slumped. His head dropped forward, dark, wet hair obscuring his face. A shudder, deeper and more profound than before, wracked his entire frame. The frantic mechanical whine subsided abruptly, leaving only the drumming rain and Bucky's uneven breathing.

He didn't pull away. He leaned, ever so slightly, into the solid warmth of Steve's hand. Not collapsing, but yielding, accepting the tangible point of contact in a world that had dissolved into terrifying fragments. His own right hand, clenched into a fist, slowly uncurled, fingers trembling against the damp wall.

Steve felt the minute shift. Felt the tension ease beneath his palm, replaced by a profound, bone-weary exhaustion. He kept his hand exactly where it was, the connection a lifeline. His thumb moved almost unconsciously, the slightest brush over the rough texture of the scars, a silent reassurance. The heat of Bucky's skin seeped into his own, contrasting sharply with the chill of the rain still evaporating from Bucky's bare torso.

The warmth, the solidity, the sheer presence of Steve's touch cut through the cold dread like a knife through smoke. Bucky squeezed his eyes shut tighter, a choked sound escaping his throat – not a sob, not quite, but a raw exhalation of relief so profound it bordered on pain. His forehead bumped lightly against Steve's collarbone, a point of contact as vital as the hand on his arm. He didn't register the damp fabric of Steve's Henley, only the radiating heat beneath it, the steady thud of Steve's heartbeat against his temple. It was real. Solid. Anchoring him against the dissolving world inside his skull. The frantic static, the fragmented screams, the icy grip of the chair... they receded, pulled back by that single point of blazing warmth on his arm and the solid wall of Steve's chest. He shuddered again, a full-body tremor, but this time it was the aftershock, the release of tension so extreme it left him trembling.

Steve didn't move. Didn't tighten his grip. He just stood, an immovable mountain in the narrow hallway, shelter against the storm. His thumb traced another slow, barely-there circle over the scars. He tilted his head, resting his cheek lightly against the top of Bucky's wet hair, the scent of rain, ozone, and the unique, clean sweat that clung to Bucky filling his senses. His other hand came up, not to embrace, but to rest gently between Bucky's shoulder blades, a second point of grounding contact. The metal beneath his left palm vibrated faintly, not with stress, but with a low, settling hum, like machinery finding its idle state.

""Got you,"" Steve murmured, the words a warm breath against Bucky's soaked hair. They weren't boastful, just a simple, undeniable truth spoken into the fragile space between them. ""I've got you, Buck."" He felt the tremor beneath his hands lessen slightly, felt the frantic rhythm of Bucky's breathing start to even out, matching the steady beat of his own heart. The hallway was still cold, the rain still lashed the windows, Hydra's ghosts still lurked in the shadows of the briefing, but here, pressed against the worn wall, Steve Rogers held onto James Barnes, and for this single, suspended moment, nothing else mattered. The storm could rage. They were anchored.

The safehouse hallway remained a fragile bubble. Rain drummed its hollow rhythm against the outside walls, the only sound besides Bucky's gradually slowing breaths, warm and damp against Steve's collarbone. The frantic tremor beneath Steve's hands had subsided into a deep, bone-weary shiver. Bucky's weight leaned more fully into him, a silent surrender to exhaustion and the undeniable solidity of Steve's presence. Steve kept his palm firmly anchored over the scarred junction of Bucky's shoulder, the warmth of his hand a stark contrast to the lingering chill on Bucky's rain-slicked skin. His other hand remained a steady pressure between Bucky's shoulder blades, feeling the subtle shift of muscle and bone beneath the damp flesh.

Steve tilted his head slightly, his cheek still resting lightly on the tangled, wet strands of Bucky's dark hair. The scent of ozone, wet pavement, and the unique, clean sweat of exertion filled Steve's senses, mixed with the faint metallic tang from the vibranium arm. He felt the low, settling hum of the arm beneath his left palm, a mechanical sigh mirroring the exhaustion in Bucky's frame.

In the stifling silence of the main room, the tension was a physical thing. Natasha hadn't moved from the sofa, her gaze sharp and distant, listening intently to the quiet murmurs and shifting fabric down the hall. Clint leaned forward in his armchair, elbows on his knees, his usual dry humor replaced by watchful stillness. Sam stood frozen near the kitchenette doorway, his coffee forgotten, his expression a mixture of deep concern and profound understanding. Tony had finally put his tablet down entirely. He stared at the hallway entrance, his trademark sarcasm wiped clean, replaced by an uncharacteristic gravity that tightened his features. He swallowed, a dry click in the silence. Even he could feel the raw, exposed nerve of the moment radiating from the confined space beyond.

Steve shifted his weight, just enough to ease the pressure on his own muscles without disturbing Bucky. He felt the minute tightening of Bucky's fingers where they now loosely gripped the damp fabric of his Henley at the waist. Not a desperate clutch, but an anchor point, a confirmation of contact. Bucky's breathing hitched again, a small, vulnerable sound barely louder than the rain. Steve felt it vibrate against his chest.

""Easy,"" Steve murmured, the word a low rumble felt more than heard against Bucky's temple. ""Just breathe. You're safe here. With me.""

Bucky didn't speak. He just pressed his forehead harder against Steve's collarbone for a second, a silent acknowledgment, a desperate seeking of that solid warmth. The tremors running through him softened further, becoming almost imperceptible shudders. The fight had gone out of him, leaving only the profound weariness and the fragile hold Steve offered.

Steve lowered his head a fraction more. His lips brushed against the wet, tangled crown of Bucky's hair. It was instinctive, a gesture of comfort pulled from a deep well of feeling that transcended friendship, duty, or even their fractured history. A tenderness so profound it momentarily eclipsed the storm, the mission, the ghosts. He pressed a soft, lingering kiss onto the damp strands. It wasn't calculated, not romantic in the grand gesture sense, but a raw, grounding expression of pure, unwavering presence. I'm here. You're not alone.

Bucky went utterly still beneath the touch. For a heartbeat, even his breathing seemed to stop. Then, a long, slow exhale escaped him, warm and damp against Steve's neck. The last of the rigid tension bled from his body. He leaned into Steve completely, his head heavy now, the fight utterly drained. The grip on Steve's Henley loosened slightly, but didn't let go. Under the warm weight of Steve's hand on his arm and the lingering pressure of that kiss on his head, the frantic whirring in the metal limb ceased entirely, leaving only the steady drumming of the rain outside and the quiet synchrony of their mingled breath in the dim, damp hallway.

Born in a village in Russia, in the early 90s. Violent stepdad, mentally ill mother. Ab#sed physically all the time and forced to raise at just 9 years old her baby sister. Be--aten, thrown out at night during harsh winters, emotionally ab\*sed, terr0rised. At 13 she ras r\* ped by a man in his 50s. It hapepened several times. At 14 it happened again with another man. She was bullied at school for being a h...e. She told me she was brutally r\* ped an gang  r p\*ed several times until she ran away at 18. She got a job as a stri pper and started dating a guy who was 40 who was bea-ting her and she ended up in hospital several times. She tried to end her life 3 times for the first time at just 14. She asked her aunt for help when she was 17 and that aunt tried to talk her into pr0stitution.

So a very trau-matic upbringing. I met her when she was 21. I was 26. She was working at the canteen of the industrial plant I work at as an engineer.

We got married 2 years later. My mother cut contact with me because I married someone without a real education and she also heard stuff about her past. Financially we are doing very well. I am in my 30s now and already got promoted to technical plant manager and make lots of money. I try to offer her the queen treatment. And she deserves it. She is amazing and I wouldn't have made it without her support. We have a 3 years old son and her depression is back. She had had episodes in the past but with meds and therapy she managed to overcome them. Now its really bad. She had inward treatment for 2 weeks.

She tried to cut her..... wrists with our 3 years old in the next room. This is when I took her by force to hospital and they kept her for 2 weeks. She adores our son and is a great mother but I am afraid of leaving him with her. I want to pay a nanny and she started crying that I will cheat on her. I would never, I love her.

But I love my little son too and I am afraid for his safety. I cannot take any days off right now as we are in a a critical situation at the plant and I am responsible for over 280 people. He can stay at the day care until 5PM. But I can leave only at 6PM. I order food every day because she doesn't cook. She just lays in bed all day and cries and repeats she wants to d... ie.

Today when I touched her (arm around shoulders) she jumped. She said its her body and she doesn't want people to touch her body and pushed me away and crawled into the corner. I am lost and exhausted",6,1757753004.0,AITAH,7,1.0,False

It’s no secret that I have very severe health anxiety… but recently I’m kinda depressed because of some „symptoms“ and the uncertainty of what is going on.

So long story short I have some ibs symptoms due to very long laxative abuse. I’m 24 yo female, no history of colon cancer in the family.

My problem comes from the fact that I don’t really have any of the major symptoms…. I do have ibs symptoms like I said but not truly… I don’t have diahreah but rather very soft (yet formed) stools. They are normal light brown kinda have slight yellow tint only on the toilet paper tho. Sometimes they float and sometimes if I swoosh them around they kinda dissolve in the water. No blood or anything, i do have build up of gas that sometimes get uncomfortable. Some mucus here and there. No pain. No urgency to go frequently. Usually One bowel movement per day. I sometimes have slight pain under right ribs but no swelling, or constant dull pain, gets better when I release gas. I tend to drink coffee first thing in the morning with milk and the past two weeks I eat rather greasy foods and ice cream. Other than that I’m 51 kg 170 tall and I play sports. So yeah quite understandable doctors dismiss me cuz I’m young, no symptoms no blood, no lack of appetite or weight loss, no lack of energy…. Every blood test I had so far was perfect.. And i should be calm right? Nope… cuz im browsing trough forums (I know it’s dumb but I guess everybody with health anxiety can understand me) and I see how people are demanding that colon cancer can cause absolutely not a single symptom even if it’s stage 4 and in their lungs and liver already. How they were super duper healthy nothing out of the range young and everything…. So of course I panic because basically I can have it but since there are no symptoms no one will test me….

I guess (without accusing anyone) my question is- how? What did you even get tested for if you are saying you were so so healthy… and I’m not talking about the routine screenings because there were people demanding they had it at like 20 something or 30 with no family history and not a single symptom… so who the fuck tested you and for what? I don’t know if I live in some sort of cave (Austria) but here or I go to the doctor at 24 and tell him „hey I don’t have a single symptom, no family history or anything but let’s get tested“ he will straight up laugh at me and kick me out… I’m just struggling to understand this and if it’s true then what? I can’t get tested because there is nothing to make me go test myself I’m young and everything… and I should just accept that today I’m healthy and tomorrow I may have stage 4 and there is nothing I can do and I just accept that I will die?

I’m really not trying to accuse anyone of lying, I know this is horrible illness and my prayers are with anyone who is fighting it. But I really wanna understand if maybe these people are maybe overreacting or not putting some symptoms they did had? Or maybe trying to sound more dramatic? I just wanna live a normal life and those stories are basically making it worse… how can I live calm life when apparently I can die next week from stage 4 without knowing….

Any advise will be highly appreciated. Also if someone things that the symptoms I have are something worth pushing the doctors for please tell me. For they sound more like ibs or cancer?

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Buffalo Bulls vs. Kent State Golden Flashes: A MAC ""Championship"" for the Books**

The Mid-American Conference’s latest “championship” game pits the **Buffalo Bulls** (1-1) against the **Kent State Golden Flashes** (1-1), a matchup that’s less about parity and more about why the Flashes are still paying their team to show up. Let’s break this down with the precision of a spreadsheet and the humor of a locker room roast.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why Buffalo’s Line Feels Like a Math Test

The odds tell a story where Buffalo is the professor and Kent State is the student who slept through the lecture. Buffalo’s **decimal odds of 1.04** (implied probability: \~96.15%) suggest bookmakers expect a snoozefest where the Bulls nap through the second half. Kent State’s **odds of 12.5-1** (implied probability: \~7.69%) are so laughable, they’d make a Vegas dealer chuckle—*“Bet on the Flashes? Go ahead, I’ll just pour you a coffee and a pity pot.”*

The **23.5-point spread** is so lopsided, it’s like asking a toddler to race Usain Bolt. For context, Buffalo’s defense held Saint Francis to **45-6** last week, allowing just **4 rushing yards**. Kent State, meanwhile, let Texas Tech score **62-14** in a game where they were *paid $1.5 million to take the loss*. If football were a casino, Kent State’s team would be the “sucker bet” section with a velvet rope.

---

### News Digest: Injuries, Interim Coaches, and a Team That Needs a Time Machine

Buffalo’s **Ta’Quan Roberson** is the closest thing to a human highlight reel, throwing for 133 yards and a TD while adding 98 rushing yards. His backfield mate, **Al-Jay Henderson**, is a touchdown machine with 98 yards and 2 scores. The Bulls’ defense? A fortress. They’ve allowed just **284.5 yards per game** and made Saint Francis look like a practice squad.

Kent State? They’re a case study in football’s version of “Groundhog Day.” Under interim coach **Mark Carney** (who took over after Kenni Burns was fired), the Flashes have a **2-24 record in their last 26 games**. Their lone wins? A \*\*4-point victory

More and more businesses - from coffee shops to online stores - are moving away from email blasts and are using WhatsApp to talk directly with customers.

The crazy part? Customers actually reply.
Unlike email (where most things go unread), WhatsApp messages feel personal, instant, and way harder to ignore.

One tool I came across recently is Dondy, which basically helps small businesses run campaigns, automate replies, and manage customer chats all inside WhatsApp. It’s not about spammy messages - yit’s about being where customers already are, in real-time.

Makes me wonder:
	•	Will WhatsApp replace email for marketing/support?
	•	Or will it just become another channel that eventually gets flooded?

Curious if anyone here has tried using WhatsApp for their business what worked, what backfired?

1nfs6o0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JFKFilesreleased/comments/1nfs6o0/judyth_vary_baker_and_lee_harvey_oswald/,Judyth Vary Baker and Lee Harvey Oswald,"Lee Harvey Oswald called himself a Patsy as he was being arrested for the murder of President John F. Kennedy Jr. Bits of information over the years have come to the surface that substantiate that claim. The Warren Commission seemed to hang the murder on him wrap it up neatly. So the country could march forward confident in the nation and her leaders.

I keep learning more and more about him because this topic is popular and there are so many theories and information is being revealed from sources inside and outside the government. The connections between Texas, Louisiana and Washington, DC reveal several issues going on at that time.

First the United States’ fear of the spread of Communism was at a mock 10 in the early 1960’s. The Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, confrontation between the US and the USSR concerning the ballistic missile deployment almost turned into WWIII. There were plots and subplots regarding getting rid of Castro. Because of how President Kennedy saw himself as the president, not a puppet, there were plots on how to handle him.

During this period Lee Harvey Oswald was working for a coffee distribution company, the Wm B. Reily Co. as a cover for intelligence work. It is also where he got involved with Judith Vary Baker.

He actually met Judyth Vary Baker as she came into New Orleans to work with Dr. Mary Sherman at the Ochsner Clinic.  It was a summer job after her sophomore year in college, with a promise for a scholarship to Tulane Medical School.  Judyth believed she was helping to find a cure for cancer. She soon discovered she was helping to create a super-cancer virus for the purpose of killing Fidel Castro.  She was also introduced to more nefarious characters at this time like Guy Banister, mafia boss Carlos Marcello, and Jack Ruby. She became personal friends with David Ferrie.  

Judyth worked with Lee at Wm B. Reily, Co. as a cover for her work with Dr. Sherman. Judyth stated, “Lee became a successful double agent working secretly against Castro for the CIA, with ties to the FBI even while posing as pro-Castro. He had successfully worked as a spy for the US Inside the USSR and was assigned to prepare himself as a spy inside Cuba. He had many jobs for both the CIA and FBI inside the US also. I had at times posed as his wife in New Orleans, and for some time had also served to help cover his activities while he and I worked at a small coffee company in New Orleans.” (1)

In her high school years, she had induced lung cancer in mice in record time in the science lab. Judyth utilized this skill with Dr. Sherman, in figuring out if she broke down Castro’s immune system, introduced the cancerous agent, and then had used massive radiation as a treatment it would kill the leader and it would seem like he died of natural causes. It was during this period Oswald took Judyth under his wings and they developed a liking to each other that developed into a love affair, although they were both married. (2) After Dr. Mary Sherman was murdered, the experiments stopped immediately and the plot abandoned.

After the murder of John F. Kennedy, Dr. Sherman was murdered, Guy Banister died in 1964 and David Ferrie committed suicide according to sources and Judyth was warned to become the “vanilla Girl”. So her life in science was over. She raised a family and did not speak out for 38 years after Kennedy’s assassination. She has evidence of what she speaks of, but speaking out took a toll on her life. She lives in Europe now, she has gone through health issues, lost teaching jobs, and is separated from her family to protect them. Her book “Me and Lee” about her life and relationship with Lee Harvey Oswald has garnered acclaim.

She professes that Lee Harvey Oswald is innocent of the murder of president Kennedy. That he is a man who is well read, intelligent with a sense of humor. Not the maladjusted traitor/murder he is portrayed as in the media.  Many people believe her, and each year more and more information comes out about the Kennedy assassination, that seems to support her claim. It seems there were plots and sub plots in the government. Kennedy though beloved by the country was feared and disliked by the industrial military complex.  Kennedy believed he was president and would not behave like a puppet. Judyth’s story is another in the complex tale of the assassination of a US President that continues to unfold before a questioning nation.
