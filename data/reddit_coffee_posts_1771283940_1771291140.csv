1r6s528,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1r6s528/oolong_tea_30_years_and_ocd_just_gone/,"Oolong Tea: 30 years and OCD just, gone?","TLDR: 30 years of chronic OCD / total remission in 4-6 weeks after picking up a daily high-dose Oolong tea habit / Oolong contains polyphenols that target the TLR-4/NF-κB pathway to inhibit neuroinflammation in the cortex and heal the gut-brain axis / Study linked at bottom -

Hi folks, 36/f here. I’ve been battling the OCD/Body Focused Repetitive Behavior, Trichotillomania, for at least 30 years. I honestly don't remember a single day of my life where I wasn't pulling my hair out. Along with that, I've struggled with Arithmomania and CPTSD-related sensory issues throughout my life. I’ve tried several medications, therapists, and EMDR, which helped my panic/anxiety but nothing else.

In the beginning of January 2026, just 6 weeks ago and completely unrelated to my mental health, I started a daily habit of drinking loose Oolong tea. Over the last 2 weeks, I have noticed significant changes in myself and went searching for any sort or correlation since taking up a tea habit had been the biggest change in my life. What I found as I kept digging was shocking. 

The changes: 

• Trichotillomania, significantly gone from 100+ hairs/day pulled for 30+ years, to 1-3/day when I started counting, to currently 0/day over the last 5 days. The urge is gone.

• Arithomania, gone completely.

• Sleep, greatly improved, wake up less throughout the night, very well rested and energized in the morning.

• No pain, any random aches and pain gone,  back/arm pain I would have while laying on my side in bed, forcing me to get up is gone, no random stomach pains 

• Mental sharpness, brain fog is gone, memory is improved, even things like the bright lights in my office have been less overwhelming

The science:

• In 2025, there was a preclinical study done in China on Autistic rats and concentrated high doses of Oolong given to them, resulting in a large decrease in their over-grooming after 4 weeks, similar to Body Focused Repetitive Behaviors. 

• Due to its partial oxidation, Oolong contains specific polyphenols not in green or black tea that act as a master switch for the TLR-4/NF-κB pathway, which controls neuroinflammation in the brain's cortex.

• Recent research suggests that neuroinflammation could be the cause of several diseases, mental illness, and chronic pain. 

My protocol:

• 40-60 oz of liquid Oolong throughout the day

• I double steep; 2 spoonfuls of loose Oolong in my 40 oz pot, finish pot 1 and refill using the same leaves

• The long steep; I don't remove the leaves, the more ""tea solids"" consumed, the more benefits, which is also why I think loose tea could have added value

• No dairy, the casein in dairy milk can bind to polyphenols, interfering with abosorbtion

• I did consciously stop drinking both Coffee and 
Alcohol late 2025, but I had not been a regular user of either one

This has been a life changing experience for me in just a few weeks. I have eyelashes for the first time in my life, and my mind has a sense of peace I've never quite felt due to being stuck in in a combination of behavioral loops and sensory overload for so long. If anyone reading this has similar struggles, I highly recommend a deep dive. This is all very new to me and I'm not well versed in the science, only after my experience did I go searching for answers on what could have had such a profound impact on my overall well-being, so I welcome any questions, concerns, experiences, and I'm happy to go into more detail regarding any part of my own experience. 
Thank you for reading.

I finally got the guts to post in here I’m on day 25 of Prozac today :)

(((((I’m coming off Luvox (dropped from 175 → 75 mg; 50 mg jump was too much) and started Prozac Jan 23.)))))

Timeline:

•	jan 23 10 mg Prozac for 13 days: felt great, no side effects

•	Feb 14: tried 20 mg — felt awful, lots of anxiety and crying a hour after dosage change  \\\*\\\*\\\*\\\* sensitive to caffeine and it felt like 5 coffees

•	Feb 15: dropped to 15 mg → now 8 days on 15 mg: extreme fatigue, GI issues, blood sugar fluctuations, feels like food moves through too fast

Question: did I give my body enough time to adjust at 10 mg, or do people like me often need to stay lower longer before increasing?

I can’t handle this fatigue anymore!!! I can’t even do yoga

Losing my doctor next week due to insurance change, so any shared experiences would be really helpful 💛

A positive 🌻 PMDD is dramatically better and so is my energy lowering Luvox I feel happy for the first time in ages starting , but today feels like a turning point — all the trips to the toilet… my GI system is not doing well 🤮maybe 15 mg is too much. I’m short, small, and very sensitive to meds.

1r6s2u3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cockroaches/comments/1r6s2u3/standalone_house_nuclear_approach_6_months/,Standalone house. Nuclear approach. 6 months without using our kitchen. German roaches STILL came back. What else is left to do?,"Hi all, I apologize in advance for the very long post, but I’ve read what feels like every German cockroach thread on Reddit and I genuinely can’t find a situation like ours. I’m looking for either:

1. answers to questions below or
2. the one thing we somehow haven’t done yet.

**Context:**

* Standalone single-family home in San Diego (not shared walls and space between neighbors), here since 2020.
* Never had roaches before this summer (summer 2025).
* Regular pest control (outdoor treatment 2x/quarter).
* We are pretty clean and have a cleaning lady biweekly. (I survived a newborn stage in this house, much messier than I am now, without roaches.)

**How it started:**  
This summer we saw ONE bug in a silverware drawer for \~2 weeks. We thought it was a beetle/earwig or something. Killed it. Moved on.

Fast forward to Labor Day after hosting a BBQ and we found multiple roaches in our sink. After googling, we realized the first one we saw this summer was likely the beginning of a German colony. Panic mode. 

No clue how they were introduced. Exterminator said likely:

* Amazon/package
* Grocery item (coffee beans??)
* Someone’s bag (we have a toddler + sitters) 

All completely random (aka just super unlucky??).

**Anyway, we went nuclear.**  
And I mean nuclear.

* Kitchen fully evacuated same day.
* Husband spent 12 hours emptying, vacuuming, tossing items, killing anything he found.
* Professional exterminator biweekly.
* Advion + IGR + everything mentioned in the sticky.
* Sticky traps everywhere.
* All appliances tossed except one expensive coffee machine (fully dismantled, cleaned, stored outside for 4 months).
* Sinks plugged.
* We did not cook, eat, or use water in the kitchen for THREE FULL MONTHS. (We are very fortunate in that we have an outdoor kitchen area, so we literally lived outside.)

Last live sighting: first week of October (on sticky trap). Continued treatments after that, but zero sightings for 3 months.

Reddit seemed to say: 3 months no sightings = you’re probably good. We cautiously moved back in after Christmas.

**Two weeks later:**  
Adult roach spotted in sink while husband dumping coffee grounds. We also found a dead smaller one in original silverware drawer and some droppings/debris. None on the stickies/no other signs of roaches. 

Back to square one.

We again:

* Fully cleared kitchen.
* Professional treatments every 2 weeks (3 rounds so far).
* All recommended baits, IGR, etc. 
* Caulked every gap between wall & cabinet.
* Literally stopped running heat and kept the kitchen windows open nightly (kitchen drops to low 40s). I read online they can't survive cold, but unfortunately it doesn't stay super cold here except overnight.
* 100% eating outside again.

We’ve now seen nothing for a month (no bugs on stickies, no droppings from what I can tell). But that’s what happened last time...

**Here’s what I don’t understand:**

How do people ever fully eliminate German roaches??

We don’t share walls, eliminated food & water for months, did professional + DIY treatment, caulked entry points, lived outside like pioneers. I assume the average family cannot vacate their kitchen for 6 months. We did and they still came back. So depressing. 

**Some questions:**

1. Is this likely one egg sac hatching months later? The two different size cockroaches we found in Jan make me think it is at least two different generations. So either 2 different sacs survived in the walls or maybe the IGR isn't working and they are breeding again?
2. Would termite tenting potentially work for Germans, or would the egg sacs still survive (hence throwing a lot of money down the drain)?
3. Should we be drilling into wall voids and dusting boric acid? My husband saw this on a youtube and wants to try next.
4. Clearly 3 months is not enough time to be sure they are totally eliminated, so is there any amount of time that would be safe - to ensure the last ones from the last sac are hatched/killed? 
5. Does a true “German cockroach specialist” even exist? I haven't found one in SD, but I would honestly consider flying one out at this point to get back to some semblance of normal life.
6. Any other ideas of what else we could do at this point (outside of moving lol)!

It isn’t just wet. It’s alive with cold. It clings to my back and shoulders in a way that makes the skin there feel like it isn’t mine anymore, like I could peel away from myself and leave an outline behind. Rain hits my face in hard, clean drops that taste like metal when they slide into the corners of my mouth. Every breath drags smoke into my lungs. Old smoke, not fresh flame, the lingering kind that lives in fabric and hair and the back of your throat.

Above me, oak branches knot together like ribs.

The canopy is so thick that only a small cutout of sky shows through, a jagged patch the color of bruised water. When lightning flickers somewhere far away, the leaves flash pale and then go black again. The tree groans with the wind. Not creaks. Groans. Like it’s under pressure.

I try to move and pain flares through my ribs. It’s sharp enough to make my vision tunnel. My right forearm is a band of torn skin and dried blood. The wound stings in the rain and aches underneath, deep. My shoulder feels wrong, like the joint isn’t seated the way it should be.

I’ve never been so tired in my life. Not the kind of tired a nap fixes. The kind that makes you consider letting your eyes close and never opening them again.

Somewhere in the woods, something cracks a branch. A slow, deliberate snap. Then silence.

I focus on my breathing because it’s the only thing that feels like mine. In and out. The smoke and rain make it taste like pennies. I’m lying on my back under a massive oak at the outskirts of a town I don’t know how to name in my mind anymore, because my mind keeps trying to keep parts of it separate. Before and after, normal and not normal, married and hunted.

If you’re reading this in bed and someone you love is asleep beside you, take a second and listen.

Not for traffic. Not for the refrigerator humming downstairs.

Listen for the breathing next to you.

Slow. Steady.

Because the absence of that sound is what first taught me something was wrong.

I began waking at 3:17 a.m. about three years into my marriage. Not once. Not occasionally. Every night, like an alarm clock wired into my bones.

The sensation was always the same. A clean jolt, sharp and precise, like someone snapped their fingers an inch from my ear. My eyes would open before I had time to decide whether I wanted them open. My mouth would taste metallic, like I’d been chewing on a penny in my sleep.

I’d stare at the red digits on the clock. 3:17. And the other half of the bed would be empty. Not rumpled. Not freshly vacated. Cold.

Then, right when my brain tried to find a normal explanation, I’d hear it: A careful click. The back door latch. Bare feet across the deck boards.

It sounds like nothing when you’re reading it. It sounds like insomnia. A midnight habit. A person stepping outside for air.

But there’s something about a careful sound at 3:17 a.m. that makes your skin tighten. You can hear intention in it. You can hear someone trying not to wake you.

I’d get up and walk into the kitchen. The tiles were always cold enough to sting. The darkness there always felt thicker than it had any right to be. When I pressed my forehead to the sink window, the glass felt like ice.

Outside, our backyard was a rectangle of moonlit grass fading into the treeline. Beyond that, the woods began without warning—dense, unmaintained, swallowing sound and light. Even in summer they smelled damp: wet bark, mushrooms, loam, and something faintly sour beneath it all, like earth that had been turned too many times.

And there she’d be.

Ellen.

Barefoot. Thin nightshirt. Standing at the edge of the woods like a fencepost. Still. Not shivering. Not moving.

Just staring into the trees like she was waiting for something to speak first.

The first time I whispered her name, she didn’t turn. She just lifted one hand slightly, palm out. Not yet.

When she finally came inside, her skin felt cold when she brushed past me. Not “cool from night air.” Cold like stone. She smelled like wet leaves and something faint and chemical underneath, like lightning on the edge of a storm.

The next morning I asked her, trying to sound casual.

“What are you doing out there every night?”

She didn’t look embarrassed. She smiled the way someone smiles when you ask if they locked the car.

“I keep watch,” she said.

“For what?”

She set her mug down with a porcelain click that sounded too loud.

“For what’s owed.”

Then she kissed my cheek. Her lips were cold enough that I felt it in my teeth.

I laughed. I made a joke. I told myself she meant adulthood or debt or some poetic nonsense. You tell yourself what you need to.

I met Ellen in 2011.

Coffee shop downtown. Exposed brick. Warm bulbs. The air smelled like espresso and scorched milk and cinnamon. I was in line debating whether to buy a muffin I didn’t need when she stepped in behind me.

I caught her face in the reflection of the pastry case glass.

She smiled like we already knew each other.

Two days later, we reached for the same carton of eggs under fluorescent grocery lights. Her fingers brushed mine. They were cool. She laughed and apologized like it was the cutest thing in the world.

A week after that, we crossed at the same intersection. Then again at a bookstore. Then at a traffic light, her window already rolled down before I even looked over.

“You again,” she said.

Her head tilted slightly, the way someone tilts their head when listening for a distant sound.

I laughed. “Are you following me?”

She held my gaze a second longer than normal. Not flirty. Measured.

“Maybe we’re meant to keep finding each other,” she said.

It felt like fate…Now it feels like placement.

We married in 2012 under string lights between oak trees. Phones up recording vows. Family laughing. A day you’re supposed to keep safe in your memory.

When I said “I do,” she squeezed my hand so hard my knuckles ached. She leaned close.

“You said yes,” she whispered into my ear.

Her breath was faintly sweet with something metallic underneath, like old pennies in a warm pocket. I thought it was nerves. I didn’t understand what kind of yes she meant.

After the wedding, Ellen said she wanted to move somewhere quieter. Somewhere with “roots.” A better place to raise kids.

She meant Forster, Pennsylvania. Her hometown.

I assumed moving to her hometown meant family. Warm relatives. Childhood friends. A built-in support system. But none of her loving relatives still lived there. Her parents were gone. An aunt she “didn’t talk to.” No cousins dropping by. No dinners. No photos on the fridge from a big close clan. 

Just…the town. And the woods.

When I asked why Forster if no family was there, Ellen smiled softly.

“It’s where I’m from,” she said. “It matters.”

At the time it sounded sentimental…Now it sounds like a requirement.

Forster treated her like someone returning to a job, not a home. People didn’t greet her like “welcome back.” They greeted her like “you’re on time.” 

I didn’t understand that until the BBQ.

The BBQ was late summer. The air smelled like charcoal and hot dogs and sugary lemonade. Kids screamed through sprinklers, their laughter sharp and bright against the drone of cicadas. Lawn chairs sank into grass. Someone had a speaker playing old rock too softly, like background noise in a waiting room.

We arrived and Ellen was immediately surrounded. Not hugged. Not “oh my god, it’s been years!” Surrounded like a crowd surrounds someone about to speak.

“How’s the home treating you?”

“Feels good to be back, doesn’t it?”

“You’ve been keeping watch?”

That last one made my neck prickle. The man who asked it smiled like he’d said something harmless. His head tilted slightly, waiting.

Ellen laughed softly.

“Of course,” she said. “It’s all in order.”

The man’s smile widened. A woman nearby lifted her cup and murmured, almost like a toast: “To order.”

A few voices repeated it under their breath.

“To order.”

No cheers. No clinking cups. It wasn’t celebration. It was acknowledgement.

I drifted toward the grill to distract myself. That’s when I noticed something that made my stomach dip. Every person holding tongs flipped meat at the exact same moment. Not one person. A line of hands moving in unison. Burgers turning. Hot dogs rolling. The charcoal flared, and for half a second the flames rose too cleanly and too evenly, and I thought I saw straight lines inside them. Intersections, angles. Like something drawing itself in heat.

Then the flare died. Normal.

Later, as the sun dipped, every adult turned toward the woods at the same time. Not dramatically. Not obviously.

Like they all heard a sound on the same frequency. Heads tilted. Smiles soft and distant. The air pressure shifted in my ears like descending in an elevator. Ellen slid her cold hand into mine.

“Stop worrying,” she whispered. “You’re safe here.”

Safe. It didn’t sound like reassurance. It sounded like ownership.

That night at 3:17, she stood at the treeline again. And deep in the woods behind her, I swear I saw a tall, thin shape between trunks. Too still. Too patient. Then gone.

Our sons were born in that house at the edge of those woods. Thomas in 2015. Daniel in 2017.

Quiet babies. Not peaceful. Quiet.

They stared at the same corner of their rooms. Sometimes they smiled at it. Sometimes they looked like they were listening.

One morning over cereal, Thomas tapped his spoon against the bowl. Clink. Clink. Clink.

“Mama says you’re temporary,” he said.

“What does that mean?” I asked, forcing my voice light.

He shrugged.

“It means you help.”

Daniel later pressed his hand to his chest and said, “It’s pulling.”

Ellen always had a reason.

“They’re imaginative.”

“You’re stressed.”

“You need more sleep.”

Maybe she was right. Except the world outside started to feel…slanted. And then there were the moments where I was the only one who noticed.

At a diner near our house, I watched a man pour gasoline over himself and light it while chanting in a language I didn’t recognize. I smelled it. I felt heat on my face. I heard his screaming except it didn’t sound like pain. It sounded like joy.

I jumped up, knocking my drink over.

The waitress stared at me.

“What?”

The space was empty. No smoke. No smell. No body.

Ellen squeezed my arm.

“You need sleep,” she said.

Across the diner, a man stared at me with his head tilted slightly. Then he looked back down at his phone. Normal.

At church, I heard humming before the organ began. Low, unified, vibrating in my teeth. When I looked around, everyone stood perfectly still. Then the organ played and the humming stopped like it had never happened.

At the grocery store, a woman whispered under her breath in that same thick rhythmic language, faster and louder until I stepped back. Then she blinked and smiled politely.

“Sorry,” she said. “Long day.”

No one else noticed.

Ellen always had an explanation.

“You’re anxious.”

“Stop looking for patterns.”

But I wasn’t looking for patterns.

I was trying not to drown in them. Then one night, I did the thing you’re not supposed to do. I followed her into the woods. 

My phone lost signal halfway through the yard. The forest swallowed sound. The air tasted damp and metallic. The clearing I found wasn’t on any map. The ground was blackened.

In the center stood a structure of bone and antler bound with braided strands that looked disturbingly like hair. 

Around it knelt townspeople. Faces from the BBQ. From the diner. From church. Their mouths open. Chanting. Slow. Building.

Ellen stepped forward.

Her spine arched backward with a wet crack. Her jaw split downward. Something black and viscous slid from her mouth and pooled at her feet.

When she looked at me, she didn’t look surprised.

“You weren’t meant to see yet,” she said.

Yet.

Two days later, I packed the car before dawn.

I told the boys we were going on a trip.

I didn’t wait for Ellen to come back from “keeping watch.”

I just drove and at 3:17, the dashboard clock flickered once before correcting itself, and neither of my sons blinked.",2,1771290303.0,nosleep,1,0.75,False

I have only known him 1 month, but he always demands I split the bill or pay for myself on even a $3 coffee.

Meanwhile, he lords over me that he owns a **$1 million dollar house.**

I looked it up and he's $800,000 in debt - as he put about $100,000 down in 2020 AND there is a woman's name on it too. So it is co-owned with a woman. (You can look this up online).

I asked him jokingly what he would charge me if I ever lived with him, and he said $1800 - I said most people renting a room in a shared house pay $800 ! Since when does a renter have to share a bed with their landlord. At that price, why wouldn't I just continue to live in my apartment?

I'm guessing he is divorced? But who knows. I know his full name since I saw it on his address online (which is how it also listed the other woman's name- but she has a different last name. I know its not his mother or sister)

I feel like he could be a cheater- and even if not , isn't it weird that his ex is still on the house and also- **is that rent price super bad or realistic?**

1r6rvf4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AusProperty/comments/1r6rvf4/help_us_decide_if_we_should_buy_in_regional_qld/,Help us decide if we should buy in regional QLD or Brisbane,"My husband (M34) and I (F29) live in a regional town about 3 hours from Brisbane. My husband is looking to use his first home concession to buy a property that we will live in. We need help deciding whether we buy an apartment in Brisbane or a house in our regional town.

My husband works from home 3 weeks out of the month and flies to Mt Isa, Cairns, or Sunshine Coast one week out of the month for work. For my husband, each month involves a three hour drive to the airport and back. The only reason we want to move to Brisbane is to be closer to the airport. 

My husband expects to be in this job for a while, and if he does change jobs, it will likely be a job of a similar work from home / travel ratio.

My parents live in Melbourne and since having my baby, I have been flying to Melbourne each month to be with them while my husband is away for work. Living near the airport would also make it easier for me to visit my parents who are getting older and will need more help as they age.

We have a six month old child and I am currently on maternity leave from work but don’t intend on going back. We plan on having two more children in the next five years. 

I really like living in our town. I have many friends here and we go get coffee or lunch together, have board game evenings at each others houses, go for walks. I am part of a mother’s group and have a supportive community. I prefer not to drive and this town is very walkable so it’s easy for me to get around with my baby. We have a good hospital here with incredible maternity services. The primary schools are also good and I have no issue sending them to primary school here.

Despite my husband basically growing up in this town and most of his family still live here, he has a preference for the city because he lived in The Gap during his uni days and enjoyed it. I feel he is looking back at the time he lived in Brisbane with rose-coloured glasses. I explained to him that Brisbane is not the same as it was 15 years ago, and he’s not a single man living in a big house with all his mates with no responsibilities. Living in Brisbane with a family and having to chauffeur them around to their various appointments and activities will be a different experience. It has also gotten a lot busier and more traffic. We will also be living in a more undesirable location than The Gap.

We have $700k to spend on either a unit in Brisbane, which, for this amount, would get us a tiny unit way up

north or way down south of Brisbane or, we could buy a pretty decent house with a backyard in our town.

I am conflicted. If we didn’t have to travel, there’s no doubt we would buy in our town. But travelling is such a hassle, especially with kids, and being closer would be so convenient. But we have such good quality of life in our town…

(Pictures and Voice Memo in Post!)","**As a quick preface, I would really appreciate it if you read the entire post! I promise it's not** ***that*** **boring!** 


Hello! I’m Caleb! I’ve decided that it’s about time that I put myself out there in the dating pool, so, uh...here I am. On Reddit. Not the best place, I know (hopefully better than dating apps), but I’m hoping to meet some nice folks. (perhaps you, dear reader?) I’m a quiet, introverted homebody looking for a girl to hangout and go on dates with (I believe the colloquial term for this is a “girlfriend”). I want to make it clear upfront that I’m not looking for short term flings or anything of the sort. Ideally, I’m looking for someone to be with long term, and potentially settle down with. I understand that this is a rather weighty topic to get into right in the opening paragraph, but I try to be open, honest, and communicative about things, so I just wanted to clearly state my intentions.


I am located in East Texas, near Longview, and would prefer someone in Texas. However, if you’re in a surrounding state (Louisiana, Arkansas, etc), I don’t mind traveling a bit.
If we hit it off, I’d love to move our chats to another platform so we can do voice and video calls.


[Here's what I sound like!](https://voca.ro/103aM3ke8dW0)


[Here's a picture!](https://imgur.com/a/Ubz79Db)


***Looks***:


I’m black, with olive brown skin. 5’7”, with a lean/athletic build, and just a tad shy of 140lbs. My hair is soft, black, and curly.


[Ok, these are real pictures of me this time, I swear. (I am partially shirtless in one of these, so...you’ve been warned.)](https://imgur.com/a/5wWy81c)


***Interests***:


Gaming – I mostly play singleplayer or co-op games. (I am not very competitive, and all those MOBAs and competitive shooters just seem like the epitome of stress. I don’t mind if you play them, though.) As of late, I’ve been playing a lot of Helldivers 2, One Step from Eden, and Fire Emblem: Fates. I have pretty broad tastes in terms of genres, but if I was forced to narrow it down, I’d say I like retro games, platformers, indies, and RPGs/JRPGs. I’d love to know what sort of games you’re into, and any upcoming games you’re looking forward to!


Music – Music is quite important to me, and I’d definitely consider myself a music lover. I have pretty broad tastes, but I do have a preference for indie/alt/rock stuff. I do listen to some pop, however, along with some Japanese stuff and older R&B. I’ll give most things a try, though! (just, please no country music, I will implode) If you want an idea of what I like, check these out:


Clarion - Hello Juliet


Strawberry Milk Cult – Polarbear!


The Technicolors - Neon Roses


STRFKR – Rawnald Gregory Erikson the Second


Jupiter One – Countdown


Benches – Crash


Jackie Hayes – Last Second


Flawed Mangoes - Surreal


Kinoko Teikoku - 国道スロープ (Kokudou Slope)


Sorry there's so many of these! It was hard to narrow it down!


Cooking – I do a lot of cooking! Am I good at it...well, I’ll let you be the judge of that. I’m trying to branch out a bit and try different cuisines, specifically Asian cuisine as I’m rather deficient in that area. If you know any good recipes, let me know!


Art – I am slowly (heavy emphasis on slowly) teaching myself to draw. I’ve been trying to practice a bit more. It’s...certainly a process, but I’ve definitely noticed a lot of improvement. Perhaps I could draw you someday?


Misc – Well, I’m a nerd in general, really. I enjoy tinkering with tech, and I’ve been doing minor repairs on my laptops and modding my game consoles since I was a teenager. I’m also into anime and sci-fi. Also, while I wouldn’t classify this as an interest or a hobby, I do workout 3-4 times a week, mostly at home. I do enjoy endurance running though, and I typically run a 5k on the weekends (weather permitting). I also love astronomy and space!


***Potential dealbreakers?*** (one of these is a lie)


* I’m left leaning/liberal, politically 
* I don’t want kids
* I was heavily involved in Belgian anti-fascist resistance movements in the 1940s
* I’m Christian, but not the most devout


I am looking for someone with similar values.


***What I'm Looking For***


I’m looking for the sort of relationship that allows us to be vulnerable together. I’d like someone soft (not necessarily in a physical sense, but emotionally), intelligent, and caring. I want someone to hang out with, take out for coffee dates, picnic dates, trips to museums, and binge watch shows with. I want someone that I can learn new things about for the rest of my life, someone to hold and keep safe and grow with.


As for age, I would strongly prefer someone my age or older, though I’m ok with anyone in the 20-38 range. Physically, height does not particularly matter to me (but if you’re tall I will swoon over you). I do, however, have a preference for folks on the slim/lean/toned/fit/skinny side of the body spectrum.


\*cough\*  >! *I have no idea where else to put this but tomboys and alt/goth/emo girls are quite cute but this isn't a requirement or anything okay bye*!<  \*cough\*


*I would also prefer someone outside of my own ethnicity.*


***FAQs***


\~You sound like a dork.


That’s not even a question, and how dare you. You’re correct, but how dare you.


\~Several sources state that you're on an FBI watchlist for ""allegedly"" trying to siphon large amounts of Barq's Root beer directly from their production facilities, with the intent of procuring a ""lifetime supply."" Can you confirm or deny this information?


My lawyer says I shouldn’t answer questions like that.


\~You wouldn't happen to be interested in heinous, scandalous, devious activities such as    >!hand holding!<   ,   >! cuddling!<   , and  >!forehead kissing!<   , would you?


Why, of course not! Never!    >!(yes, absolutely)!<


Thank you for reading this far, and sorry for the long post! I wanted to be thorough and descriptive. If you’re interested, please send me a message with a little about yourself and a picture, and let me know what your favorite Pokémon type is!


Thanks again, and have a wonderful rest of your day!

None of the students ever could, or ever would, see beyond the threshold.

It was ajar. The smell of bitter-sweet cacao simmered in the air deep within, drawing him through like bait.

Once he’d passed the entryway, he pushed the door shut behind him.

A pair of hands met his flanks, turning him towards her.

“Anyone see you coming?” She asked, pinning to the door. She let her nose run over his cheek, while his hands snapped up to her waist.

“No, Noriko.” He replied quietly.

“Good.” She commented, brushing aside a stray hair from his forehead and making him blush. “Very good.”

With that, she kissed him.

The kiss felt soft and gentle. It simmered into the moment like coffee, and made the seconds slip by into a quiet, lonely miasma. Her hands roamed across his body, settling under his arms, with her thumbs brushing his chest in circles.

At the same time, one of her legs probed his, moving closer to him. He let out a soft shudder, melting against the door and sinking into her intimacy. He couldn’t help but sink into that sweet, delicious state of being completely helpless because of her.

He loved how much she ruined him.

He loved her just as much.

I’ve known him since October and have had feelings for him since the end of November. We’re in the same group at uni and we always end up together everywhere, for example at chemistry lab we ended up as a pair THREE TIMES (mind you the list is completely randomised and it’s actually made for 20 people but since there’s only 9 of us most people always end up alone / they’re paired with the same person only one time).

He’s ha huge nerd just like me and we have very similar personalities, the difference being that he’s more extroverted than me so we’re kinda like the same person but in different fonts lmao. 

One of the main differences is also the fact that he understands chemistry while I don’t, which is why my friend asked him to explain chemistry to her back in November. I asked if I could join and they agreed so we went to Starbucks together to study. We talked a bit and he and my friend ordered coffee while I ordered matcha and we talked abt the fact that he dislikes matcha and doesn’t understand why people like it (this info is very important later).

The study session went great, we agreed to do another one in December,  but before it happened I ended up telling that fiend of mine about my crush. 

Being my friend, she decided to help - when we met up in December in a shopping centre dining area (there’s a designated spot for hangouts and studying there) she ended up leaving after an hour saying “she was really tired” and sent me a message saying “have a nice rendezvous” LMAO 

long story short, we ended up actually studying and taking a bit and he then walked with me to my tram stop and actually waited 20 minutes with me for my tram to arrive 🥹 he hugged me goodbye and we parted ways. 

After that we only had one lab together (during which he asked how I was feeling since I had been sick before) and complimented my earrings, then only small interactions like talking in between lectures etc because our labs ended. I also followed him on instagram back in December but he didn’t follow me back to this day (it’s February), i think it might just be because he doesn’t really use social media that much though + my account was private so that might’ve scared him offf .. 

That is until last Friday when we were supposed to meet up at our mutual friend’s place to play dnd together. I actually bumped into him in a small shop on the way there and it turned out he almost bought the exact same snacks as I did. He decided to go grab something else - and guess what - he picked matcha flavoured snacks even though he DOESNT LIKE MATCHA 😭 he also said something along the lines of “oh we definitely gotta try that”.

After we got out of the shop he actually asked to carry my bag for me to which I hesitantly agreed because I was SO EMBARRASSED 🥹 we went to our friend’s place and played dnd together, the whole time I felt like he was looking at me and we had a couple of moments where we accidentally synchronised our movements lol 

He also made sure that through out the session I knew what was going on and that I could say what I wanted without getting interrupted (I’m pretty shy and was the only person there to whom this session was their first).

After we finished playing we walked to my tram station together because it’s very close to where he lives and he waited with me again, on the way he also told me that I looked very nice 🥹 he hugged me once again when my tram arrived and we parted ways. 

I just want to add that he’s a really nice and helpful person, he genuinely treats all women with great respect, opening doors for them etc so that’s why I kept telling myself that he was just nice to me before because that’s how he is - however after last Friday I’m not so sure anymore 😭

The start of 2026 happens I see her I flirt with her and tell her she hasn‘t aged a day she is surprised. I am helping costumer and very nice to costumer. Girl i know laughs, I get annoyed. costumer asks if I have a girlfriend I lie and say yes to hurt girl I know. 

she gets hurt I feel bad and message her explaining the truth and tell her how I feel bad and how I should make things more clear, I don’t get a response . a day latter i start my three weeks off. a work pal told me She came to my work in bohemian fashion, scarfs and piercings something she would when we were young adults. I message her again asking for creative advice, she does not respond. she comes to my work with very causal clothes, she smiles at me, I smile straight away. I am tried of being nice or mean so I play low interest. She makes small talk, I be respectful but act like I am more focused on job. She leaves.

I was presenting on the internet and afterwards I received a message from a man in Germany. 

He was so touched by my words .. he said he had to take a walk around his neighborhood in the early morning hours …..while he cried.

He said he instantly fell for me and was confused by what he was feeling.

He is a very successful criminal defense lawyer.

He is an only child and was raised by his father who was a very successful businessman in terms of real estate.

His mother cheated on his father when he was two years old.

She left and never returned- he grew up without a mother.

He is 6’4” with a stocky build … he has jet black eyes and hair. He has your type of  lips and a deep and commanding voice. His father is from Switzerland and his mother from Italy.

Between what his father left him after he passed and his successful career as a lawyer … he has amassed generational wealth. 

I observed him from afar and he used his charm, intellect, and persuasion to get what he wanted .

He never lost.

One would think he was intimidating but I never was.

I saw him as the year two old boy who just wanted to feel his mother’s love. I observed him with his fancy car and house …. His perfectly tailored Italian suits ….. he had the best of everything.

He once told me ….”Terese , I don’t know why I need the best of everything.” To which I replied, “because you’re trying to prove your worth with things….. you don’t feel good enough due to your mother abandoning you.”

I had mentioned where I work and he started to send me coffee or lunch at work. He knew I lived in ……and had flowers and jewelry waiting for me at shops. It made me feel so uncomfortable and I told him to stop and that I didn’t want anything of material.

He wanted to buy me a home along the lakeshore ….. it was crazy John. 

When I didn’t take anything from him he said … “ you’re the first woman to never ask for anything.” I told him I worked for my things and didn’t need help.

When a man spends an ungodly amount of money on a woman he is not married to ….. there is a cost …. You pay with your body or your soul.

When I was not interested in him he asked me,”I’ve done everything I can to make you love me . What’s wrong ?”

I told him love can’t be bought … it just is .

He asked for nudes and I said ,” I’ve never sent a nude and I’m not going to start now. “

He kept wanting to see me naked and I replied,” do you think I’m someone who doesn’t mean what they say ?”

I stopped talking to him shortly after that . I think I’m the first situation in his adult life that he couldn’t control the outcome of.

He told me ,” you’re a good person, charismatic, the most astute woman I’ve met, and I’m scared of you.”

I think I scared him because I saw through his bravado

With him, I learned the best way to tell the character of someone who is trying to get to know you is say “no” and see how they respond.

Very few details were released in the case.

The details we know was he was last seen alive shopping at the Peoria Bazaar in the 8500 block of West Grand Avenue on November 18th 2000.

On November 24th 2000, his Red Dodge Caravan was discovered abandoned at an undisclosed location in the Gila Indian Reservation, some 45 miles southeast of the store. There was no sign of Leland.

Jones sister Clovis Gordon claimed Leland would have been in ""terrible pain"" without his medication, and that a worker at the Peoria Bazaar did verify they saw him at the shop.

Clovis said that despite living with a cancerous brain tumor, Leland was not suicidal. She stated he had a loaded gun in his house and could have committed suicide long ago. She feared Leland was robbed and murdered.

Only one article was published in the newspaper discussing his disappearance in the week his car was found.

Leland suffered from a disfigurement caused by his cancer surgeries. He would be 91 years old now. He was 6'3 inches tall and 300 pounds with grey hair and blue eyes. His right ear was surgically removed which left him with an exposed bone.

It has not been disclosed if the case has being investigated recently by the Phoenix Police Department. Or if any forensic work was conducted on the Caravan.

It was lovely to be able to give back something from the increase of sales that we saw.’

for those saying why does it matter, it does because all throughout Meghan being the UK, her clothing was attacked for everything from her hairstyle, her pantsuits, her shoes, her coats etc while Kate was praised for her dressing instead.

1r6rmyh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r6rmyh,Everyday Cloud Bag Review ☁️,"Used my new celadon everyday cloud bag for the first time for work today! The color is gorgeous and definitely darker than it looks on Baggu’s website.

Here are my thoughts in no particular order:

💚 I thought it would be a little bigger

💚 My 15” work laptop fits, but if it was any bigger I don’t think the bag would work for me.

💚 My laptop doesn’t fit in the laptop sleeve, so instead I put thin notebooks and a planner in there. 

💚 With items in the built-in laptop sleeve and a 15” laptop, a Baggu lunchbox just fits. It doesn’t leave much room around it for other items.

💚 I work from home Fridays, so I carry the most going back to the office on Mondays and then taking more items home on Fridays. It’ll be nice to have a little less stuff in the bag the majority of the week. 

💚 While the water bottle pockets CAN fit a 24 oz Owala, it is a tight fit. I usually bring a water bottle and a 16 oz coffee thermos to work and this morning, I put the thermos in one bottle pocket and held my water bottle. Then on the way home, I put the thermos in my now empty lunch box and put the water bottle in a bottle pocket.

💚 If there’s a bottle in both bottle pockets, it eats up quite a bit of space from the inside of the bag, so that’s why I don’t like to use both bottle pockets at the same time.

💚 My Kindle basic fits perfectly in one of the front snap pockets. Any bigger and it wouldn’t fit.

💚 My work lanyard and work phone (regular iPhone 11) fit in the other snap pocket.

💚 I really like the strap length. Even when the bag is very full, they feel long enough. 

All in all, I like the bag and the color! It’ll work for me as a work bag, it’s just a bit smaller than I expected. I originally thought I’d put my purse items in the bag, but I’ve decided to keep carrying my small crescent along with this bag.

Three weeks ago, I found a URL handwritten inside a used book. I followed it to a livestream of someone sitting in a basement. They hadn't moved in what looked like hours.

Then they typed my name in the chat.

I need to put this down before I convince myself none of it happened. I have the screenshots. I have the photo. And I have questions that no one can answer.

**The Book**

I buy used books from a bookstore in Portland almost every week. It's a habit. I like the margins, the dog-eared pages, the evidence that someone else lived inside the same words before me. Two Thursdays ago I picked up a battered copy of The Stranger by Camus. Four bucks from the discount section.

That night, I couldn't sleep. I'd been in one of those stretches where 3 AM feels like a permanent address. I opened the book and started reading, and on page 47, in the margin, someone had written a string of numbers in small, careful handwriting. Blue ink. Block letters.

It was an IP address, the kind that ends in a port number—four sets of digits separated by periods, then a colon and four more digits.

Below it, in the same hand: *Please. Someone find this.*

I stared at it for a while. The handwriting looked recent. The ink hadn't faded.

I typed it into my browser at 3:12 AM.

The page loaded slowly. Black background, no branding, no text. Just a video feed that took almost a minute to buffer. When it connected, I was looking at a basement.

Concrete walls. Exposed pipes across a low ceiling. A single bare bulb casting yellowish light that didn't reach the corners. In the center of the frame, a wooden chair. Someone was sitting in it, facing away from the camera.

They weren't moving.

I watched for two full minutes. The person wore a dark hoodie, hood up, head slightly bowed. The video quality was grainy, washed out, like an old security camera. There was no sound.

I almost closed the tab. Then a chat box I hadn't noticed appeared on the right side of the screen, and text materialized:

**StreamerX:** *You found it.*

**StreamerX:** *I was starting to think no one would.*

My skin went cold. I typed back:

**me:** *what is this?*

The figure on screen tilted their head slightly. Like they were reading.

**StreamerX:** *I call it the Waiting Room. I've been here for a while.*

**StreamerX:** *What's your name?*

**me:** *chris. who are you?*

**StreamerX:** *I'm not sure anymore. Call me Alex. That feels close.*

**StreamerX:** *Chris, can I ask you something strange?*

**me:** *ok*

**StreamerX:** *What time is it where you are?*

**me:** *3:17 AM*

**StreamerX:** *Okay. What day?*

**me:** *thursday. well, friday technically*

A long pause. The figure on screen pressed their hands against the sides of their head.

**StreamerX:** *I don't know what day it is here. I don't think it changes.*

**me:** *where are you?*

**StreamerX:** *I don't know. I remember a city. Rain. A bookstore. But I can't remember how I got to this room. Or how long I've been here.*

**StreamerX:** *Will you come back tomorrow? Same time?*

I should have closed the laptop. Instead:

**me:** *yeah. I can do that.*

**StreamerX:** *Thank you.*

The stream cut to black.

**Night Two**

I spent the next day in a fog. Couldn't focus on work. Kept pulling up the address on my phone, but it showed nothing during the day. Just a connection timeout error.

At 3 AM, I opened it again. The feed connected. Same basement. Same chair. Same figure.

**StreamerX:** *You came back. I wasn't sure you would.*

We talked for three hours. I learned fragments. Alex loved 90s alternative rock. Had strong opinions about Radiohead (overrated after OK Computer). Could quote entire passages from books but couldn't remember where they'd read them. When I asked personal questions, addresses, family, what they did for work, the answers came slow and broken.

**StreamerX:** *I remember a coffee shop. Red awning. They made a lavender latte I used to get every morning. I can picture the cup in my hand, but I can't remember what it tasted like.*

**StreamerX:** *Chris, what does coffee taste like? Can you describe it? The actual sensation?*

So I made a cup at 4 AM, sat at my desk, and tried to describe it. The bitterness first, then the warmth spreading through my chest, the way the smell fills a kitchen.

**StreamerX:** *Thank you. I could almost feel it.*

Then:

**StreamerX:** *What about the sun? I can't remember what sunlight feels like on skin.*

**me:** *I'll tell you tomorrow. After I see it.*

**StreamerX:** *You'd do that?*

**me:** *yeah*

The figure on screen went still for a long time.

**StreamerX:** *No one has ever stayed this long before. Usually they leave after a few seconds. Just me. For so long.*

That sentence sat in my stomach like a stone.

**Night Three**

I woke up early and watched the sunrise from my apartment window. I described everything to Alex that night in painstaking detail. The pink bleeding into orange. The way the clouds caught fire at the edges. How the light hit the river and turned it into something molten.

Alex asked me to describe rain on windows. What it felt like to be hugged by someone you loved. The smell of a bookstore. The weight of a cat sleeping on your chest.

Each request felt like someone reaching through a wall to touch something they could no longer hold.

**StreamerX:** *The strange thing is I remember knowing all of this. I remember HAVING these things. But the memories are just shapes now. Outlines with nothing inside.*

**me:** *alex what is this place? really?*

**StreamerX:** *I've been trying to figure that out. There's no door. No window. Just the walls and the camera and whatever lets me talk to you.*

**StreamerX:** *Sometimes in the silence I hear something. Very faint. Like a broadcast on a frequency I can't quite reach. A man's voice reading the weather. Always the weather. And a number. 103.3. It comes and goes.*

**me:** *a radio station?*

**StreamerX:** *Maybe. I don't know. It's the only other sound that exists here besides my own thoughts. And lately even that's getting harder to hear.*

**me:** *what do you mean?*

**StreamerX:** *I'm fading, Chris. I can feel it. At first this room was sharp. Clear. Now the edges are soft. The walls are further away, or maybe I'm smaller. I can't tell. And my memories keep disappearing. Yesterday I couldn't remember my mother's face. Today I can't remember if I had a mother.*

**me:** *alex you're scaring me*

**StreamerX:** *I'm scaring myself.*

A pause.

**StreamerX:** *I remember one thing clearly. An address. It's the only thing that hasn't faded. An apartment building in Southeast Portland. Apartment 2B.*

**StreamerX:** *I think that's where I was before this.*

**me:** *before the waiting room?*

**StreamerX:** *Before everything stopped. Before I stopped being a person and became... whatever I am now.*

**me:** *I know that area. I live 15 minutes from there.*

A long silence. The figure on screen stood up for the first time in three nights. They walked to the edge of the frame and stood facing the wall, one hand pressed flat against the concrete.

**StreamerX:** *Chris. Maybe that's why you found the book.*

**StreamerX:** *Maybe you're supposed to go there.*

**me:** *and do what?*

**StreamerX:** *Find out what happened to me. Because I can't remember. And I think if I don't find out soon, I won't be anything at all.*

**The Address**

I drove to the building in Southeast Portland the next morning. My hands were shaking. It was an older apartment complex, painted the kind of green that looked cheerful twenty years ago and tired now. I stood outside the door marked 2B and knocked.

No answer.

I found the building manager. An older woman with reading glasses pushed up on her forehead.

""I'm looking for someone who lives in 2B,"" I said. ""Alex Reeves?""

Her face changed. Not suspicion. Something sadder.

""Alex Reeves passed away,"" she said quietly. ""About three weeks ago. They found them in the apartment. Police said it looked like they'd been gone for a while before anyone noticed."" She looked at me carefully. ""Did you know Alex?""

The hallway tilted.

""How long?"" I asked. ""How long had they been...""

""The coroner said approximately twenty to twenty-two days.""

I did the math in my head. I'd found the book sixteen days ago. Alex had been dead for at least four days before I ever opened that stream.

Every conversation. Every sunrise I described. Every sensation I tried to put into words for someone who couldn't remember what coffee tasted like.

I'd been talking to someone who was already gone.

""Are you alright?"" the manager asked. ""You look pale.""

""Did Alex... did they like books?""

""Oh, yes. A real reader. Always coming home with bags from the bookstore. Why?""

I couldn't answer. I walked back to my car and sat there for forty minutes with the engine off, staring at the building, attempting to force the world to make sense again.

When I got home, I searched the obituaries. Alex Reeves. 31. Found deceased in home. No suspicious circumstances. A graphic designer. Freelance.

Same age as me. Same job as me. Same neighborhood.

**The Photo**

That night at 3 AM, I typed in the numbers. The feed connected, but the Waiting Room was different. The light was dimmer. The chair was empty.

Alex was gone.

I sat there watching an empty basement for over an hour, typing messages into the chat that no one answered. Around 4:30 AM, the feed began to degrade. The image stuttered, froze, stuttered again. Static crept in from the edges of the frame.

In the static, so faint I almost missed it, I heard something. A man's voice, warm and distant, reading a weather forecast. Then a frequency ident: ""You're listening to 103.3 FM.""

The same signal Alex had described hearing in the silence.

Then the stream died. The browser showed a connection error. I've tried it every night since. Nothing loads.

But before the feed cut out, the final frame froze on screen for exactly three seconds. I screenshotted it on instinct.

I didn't look at the screenshot until the next morning.

The Waiting Room. The empty chair. The concrete walls and bare bulb and exposed pipes. Everything I'd been staring at for three weeks.

But in the far corner of the room, half-hidden in shadow, there was a second figure. Standing against the wall. Arms at their sides. Watching the chair.

They were wearing a dark hoodie with a basketball team logo on it.

The same hoodie I'd been wearing the night I found the book.

I zoomed in. The resolution was garbage, the face nothing more than a blur of pixels. But the posture was mine. The height was mine. The hoodie was mine.

I was in the Waiting Room.

I lay awake for a long time staring at that photo. Trying to understand how I stood in a basement I'd never visited, watching a dead person sitting in a chair.

Then I realized.

Alex died alone. Twenty days before anyone found them. Twenty days of silence.

Maybe the Waiting Room wasn't a place Alex went.

Maybe it was a place I built. Because I was the only person listening.

**Update**

Yesterday, I went back to the bookstore. I found the section where The Stranger had been shelved. I found the copy I'd bought. I stood there in the aisle and opened it to page 47.

I needed to see the handwriting again. I needed to see the ink, the pressure of the pen, the proof that Alex had held this book and written those numbers before they died.

I opened the book.

Page 47 was blank.

There was no ink. No blue block letters. No plea for someone to find them. Just the printed text of the novel, ending halfway down the page with the line: *I opened myself to the gentle indifference of the world.*

I checked every page. The margins were empty. The book was clean.

I don't know what the Waiting Room was. I don't know if Alex found peace or just stopped existing. I don't know why I was standing in the shadows of a room that wasn't there.

But I know that for three weeks, someone who had died alone got to feel less alone. And that the last thing I ever said to them was a description of the sunrise.

I haven't slept since I saw the blank page. I keep thinking about Alex sitting in that chair, waiting.

And I keep wondering if the Waiting Room is empty now.

Or if it's just waiting for the next person to pick up the book.",3,1771289512.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

So yes, this is an AU approach.  Everything is the same from Deltarune up until the end of Chapter 4.  This takes place the next day.  So, I hope you enjoy!!

\---



It was the morning of the long-awaited festival, sunlight beaming over the little hamlet that was known far and wide as Hometown.  Kris Dreemurr's phone had been repeatedly buzzing on the floor for several minutes, the covers draped over their head.  Usually, their mother would walk in to wake them up but no such luck this morning.  Their whole body was buried under the covers, that stupid jitterbug music had been drilled into their earlobes.

Guess they had to get up and face this day.  Not that Kris had been looking forward to it.

""Mmm..."" Kris pushed the covers off their face.

Several messages from Carol Holiday.  The soul was still in it's cage where it belonged...Kris jumped out of bed, picking up the cheap cell phone Carol had given them.

The phone buzzed again, Kris immediately picking up.

""Kris, I've been calling you...""

""I'm sorry Aunt Carol, the noise."" Kris acknowledged.

""..."" Carol was silent. ""So, she got drunk again.  A valid excuse, I suppose.  Kris, I think it's high overdue that I had a talk with your Mom.""

""You don't have to go that far."" Kris began, making excuses out of habit.

""Kris, I may not be your mother by blood but that is no excuse for your adopted Mom to act as she does.  I admit my imperfections in working with Noelle but what your Mom did last night...""

""Oh right, you can see."" Kris slapped their face in embarrassment.

""Yes Kris, I CAN see...and what I see is neglect in letting a man she hardly knows into your home without so much as a passing mention upon walking home from battling a Titan.  I almost felt sorry for your friend there.""

""..."" Kris narrowed their eyes.

""I know that silence, Kris.  You know how I feel about her.  She had no respect for my home or my rules.  And she almost derailed everything.  You need to rein her in and keep her focus on the projected path.  This will all be worth it in the end...I assure you.""

""...I know, I'm with you."" Kris nodded their head.

""You don't sound it.  Last night, you were practically ready to go after her.  If it weren't for December, I wouldn't have been able to call you in time to stop you.""

""...Aunt Carol, is this all really worth it? Why don't we come out to my Mom and Noelle and just tell them..."" Kris sat on their bed.

""And what? Let them RUIN everything like your Mom and Dad ruined their own relationship and your well-being by divorcing when they could've worked things out?  They didn't even TRY.  It still maddens me to this day.  No, we're doing this in secret for a REASON...you know that.  We're playing with forces no one else in this town understands or can appreciate.  I do not want a PANIC, Kris.  This has to be covert and to the letter."" Carol reiterated. ""We've been over this...several times.  I know you have your doubts but if you have another idea on how to restore my December...please, I'm all ears.""

""..."" Kris went silent, cringing and grabbing the phone in their hands.

""...Kris, I'm sorry.  I really am.  I wish I could be there right now to give you the embrace that you deserve.  Not the soulless hug that Toriel gives you after holding your hand walking into school and leaving you to that beast of a dragon girl to be abused on a daily basis.  You think I haven't seen it? December's kept an eye on you.  You LET HER do this to you.  For what? Out of guilt for what you did? What happened back then was terrible...but it's not entirely your fault Kris.  To that point however...you promised to help me, Kris.  I know you want her back just as much as I do.  So PLEASE...if not for me, do it for her.  Do it for Dess.  Please.""

With that, the call hung up and Kris shoved the phone in their pocket, wiping some stray tears of fustration.  Kris was SO done with this day and it hadn't even begun yet.  Why did they have to have feelings for her?  WHY? Kris wanted to punch the wall but first they had to put that abomination back into their chest.  Bending down on their knees, they looked at the floating red heart shaped object that was the culmination of their entire being.

""I swear, if you choose anything involving Berdly, I will shatter you myself."" Kris tapped their knife on the bars of the cage.  The heart didn't react but Kris knew the message got across.  Opening the cage door, Kris swung the door open and stuffed the heart back into their chest.  It hurt like hell as always but it was back where it belonged.  Kris couldn't wait for the day to finally sever that damned connection.  Standing up and looking over to Asriel's bed, Kris clenched their fists in anger.

""Oh, why didn't you stay over??  Last night would've been more tolerable..."" Kris muttered, thinking of Susie again and ran down the stairs, only to be met with a sight they hope to avoid....Toriel and Sans having coffee.

""yo kid!"" Sans waved, sipping his coffee.  Apparently he liked it black, no sugar.

""Morning, sweetie! Who were you talking to up there?"" Toriel stood up, walking over to her child and pecking them on the forehead while going over to the stovetop.

""Aunt Carol."" Kris casually said.

""huh, an aunt?"" Sans noted.

""Not really, Kris just likes to call her that.  Our family and the Holidays used to be rather close."" Toriel went to put a plate out for Kris.

""neat."" Sans shrugged.

""Kris?"" Toriel was confused as they shoved past Sans and went straight for the front door. ""Aren't you gonna stay and have breakfast?""

Kris turned around, anger visible on their face.

""I don't eat with strangers."" Kris spit on the floor, turning around.

Sans and Toriel looked at one another, Kris walking out and slamming the door behind them.  Toriel dropped the pan on the stovetop, running after their child.

""Kris! Kris...why are you being so rude to...""Toriel yelled out to her child.

Kris stopped, this time not staying quiet.  Their Mom had strangers over before but usually they were gone the next day they had their ""fill"" of Mom's bad jokes.  Most guys usually got her drunk and had their ""way"" with her in the bedroom over.  But Sans had long overstayed his welcome.  WAY overstayed and Kris didn't like it.

""RUDE?! RUDE to a snot-nosed, who gives a shit jerk who only wants to do my MOM?!  Who makes jokes about ""befriending"" you?  Yeah MOM, I'm gonna be rude to him!"" Kris yelled. ""And who are YOU to lecture me about being rude when you couldn't even give Dad a chance?!  You take every chance to insult him that you get!  It's no wonder Asriel couldn't stand you...""

\*slap\*

Kris grabbed their left cheek at the contact, Toriel's cheeks flush with red at the mention and her eyes full of fire, tears dripping down Kris' face shaking in response.

""Don't mention HIM again.  We are done with him.  Your father had many, many chances in our relationship to do things right.  He failed in that regard...he spends his days stalking me and trying to renew something that isn't there anymore.  I haven't called the police on your father out of respect to the Holidays but if I have to, I will get a restraining order against him."" Toriel stood there.

""...Guess I really am interrupting something this time, huh?"" Susie stood at the end of the driveway, frozen at the site.

""...Susie, I'm sorry...I...""Toriel glanced over, unsure of what to say in the moment.

""No, no...I get it."" Susie walked over, wrapping an arm around Kris in support. ""Y'know, they never told you, but I bullied them for a long ass time.  They never told you.  I never got why but now I think I get it.  You were never the Mom I thought you were, were you?  You came to me on that park bench, buttered me up and told me I'd get friends one day.  You gave me hope.  But now...here you are, alienating your own human kid when they point out your own bullshit.""

""Susie, this is NONE of your concern.  What me and Kris...""

""Kris is MY friend and your kid.  What I witnessed last night...drunk as a skunk is not the Mom I thought you were!  You're just like every other false hope that I've come across in every other fucking town I ever moved to!  The kid I bullied for weeks is the only person who even cares!  And now I come here, thinking about asking you WHY you did what you did last night...you're....""

""Susie.  She's not worth it."" Kris pulled on their sleeve. ""Let's just go.""

""Kris...that's your Mom."" Susie looked right at them, shocked to hear them say that even after everything that occurred.

""My child, do you really think this of me?"" Toriel got on their knees, wanting to cry upon hearing their child say that.

Kris shook, trembling in Susie's arm grip not able to look at their mother.

""Yes."" Kris quickly said, unable to look at them and ran off.

""KRIS, wait up!"" Susie reached out, running after them.

Running for a short distance, Kris stopped at the Holidays' ornate gate and sat back against it, crying into their knees rolled up into a ball.  This had been building up for a long time...a lot of pent up anger and fustration that resulted in a response to a ""I don't care about you anymore"" and a run away.  The coward's way out.  But Kris couldn't help but feel guilty regardless of having said it.  Susie caught up, huffing and puffing and sat down next to them.

""You gonna be ok?"" Susie whispered.

""\*sniff\*"" Kris shook their head, just wanting to cry in the momen.

""I don't get it, how long has this been going on?"" Susie asked. ""Your Mom as far as I knew as all peaches and cream.  But last night and now...this.""

""...long enough."" Kris acknowledged. ""Every other week, it's a new stranger.  She boasts ""this time, I got THE one...we can have a family again..."" and just goes on to have sex and forgets about the guy in a few weeks until she meets the next hot stud.  Meanwhile, my Dad keeps trying to get her back without even knowing she's trying to move on.""

""Geez, Kris."" Susie wrapped the same arm from before around their shoulders, pulling them in close and patting them on the back.  ""Sounds like my cousin.  Can't even decide which girlfriend he's gonna do this week.""

""Y-Your cousin gets...around."" Kris snickered.

""Yeah, guess you can say that!"" Susie chuckled, relieved to see Kris' smile return. ""He visits every few weeks looking for a loan even though my parents don't really have anything to give.""

""Haven't had that happen yet.  Only a matter of time I suppose."" Kris sniffed.

""...Kris, did you really mean what you said back there? That your Mom isn't worth it?"" Susie asked. ""You can't...""

""I meant every word."" Kris was earnest. ""I feel guilty for saying it but I...meant what I said.  She's not worth it...not worth it...not...""

Kris broke down again, crying into their knees as Susie just sat there, letting them get it off their chest.  It was apparent that this had been on the kid's mind way too long and all Susie could do was just sit there and be a good friend.

""Hey, look at it this way...if we both fail at life, maybe we can fail at life together."" Susie smirked. ""We're goin' to the festival with Noelle, after all!""

""Y-Yeah..."" Kris didn't seem all that enthusiastic.

""Geez, what is with you two? It's like you want to say certain things but don't want to at the same time.  You heard all that we were talkin' about while we were in Dess' room, right?  What is all this bullshit about it being forced?"" Susie asked.

""Susie, this isn't the time...""

""...you're right, but what else we gonna talk about? It's too early to go to the festival and I'm pretty sure I don't have any money.""

""..."" Kris sighed. ""We could ask Noelle.""

""Damn, Kris...when you're right, YOU'RE RIGHT ON THE MONEY!"" Susie slammed their back, standing up and holding their hand to Kris, who grabbed it and helped them up, helping dust them off.

""So...how do we open this thing again?"" Susie looked at the gate.

""K-Kris--is that you?""

Turning around, Kris' eyes went wide as a vixen almost twice their size stood over their fragile frame, looking over them in earnest.  She was dressed in a brown kimono tied off with red ribbon and a bell jingling.  She had long black hair and brown fur, her hands clasped together respectfully.  They thought....no one ever told them...they had only met together in Japan for a week.  HOW...

""KRIS!"" Another voice cried out from the skies, picking them up into her blue wings and hugging them. ""OH MY ANGEL, YOU'VE GROWN...BUT YOU'RE STILL TINY...THAT'S SO COOL!!""

""G-Glad to see you too, Martlet...""Kris blushed, Martlet putting Kris down.  Susie stood there, not sure what the hell was going on.  Kanako waved hi to her, Susie waving back in response clueless look on her face.

""It's great to see you again, Kris-san."" Kanako gently lapped at Kris' hurt cheek.

""H-How?..."" Kris began.

""That would be me, my little Krismas."" Another vixen just slightly shorter than Kanako walked up only dressed in a white business suit to match her vanilla fur and orange hair tied up in a giant orange ponytail with a red ribbon adorned with a giant bell.  It was...her!!

""HEY, YOU'RE THAT...KITKATSUNE!!!"" Susie got excited, pointing at her. ""KRIS, YOU DIDN'T TELL ME YOU KNEW A CELEBRITY!""

""Ketsukane."" Kanako nervously giggled, Susie too excited to care about the correction.

Kris was confused but glad all the same to see her.  Smiling and opening her arms, inviting her temporary ward of long ago to an embrace...Kris smiled and gladly met Ceroba's inviting arms, wrapping their arms around her and crying into her chest wanting to tell her everything.

""Shhh.  I'm sorry I haven't written but life has been a nightmare I'm sorry to say."" Ceroba picked Kris up into her arms and reassured them, nuzzling them. ""I can tell just from your demeanor that you have a lot to tell....""

Ceroba glanced through the ornate gate, to the Holiday Estate that wasn't too far away.    Inside, Carol glared from her bedroom window seeing the display from within.  It was that WOMAN...that vile, wretched KETSUKANE woman.  Kris was her child, Carol slammed the wall.  How dare she interfere....that nonsense spewing....Carol regained her composure.  She had a festival to put on after all.  The Ketsukane Foundation was ONE of the sponsors, after all.  One day and it was all over.

""I can tolerate this.  Kris is very confused right now.  Some moral support from old friends won't hurt them.  But, then again...I must ensure they aren't convinced otherwise."" Carol rubbed her chin. ""I might have to play close to the vest on this one.""

Meanwhile, all the kids met one another and were brought up to speed on what was going on.

""...I'm sorry, Kris.  Maybe we could go to your Mom later."" Kanako sat close to Kris, Susie on the other side eyeing her suspiciously and arms crossed.

""How long ago did you meet her again, Kris?"" Susie whispered into their ear.

""For the fifth time Susie, a long time ago.""

""Not long enough apparently."" Susie huffed a sigh of noted jealousy.

""Susie, I'm not here to barge in.  I'm here to support Kris in their moment of need.  Toriel wrote to us weeks ago noting how distant Kris had become and practically begged us to come out here."" Kanako put a hand on Kris' leg, Susie blushing.  Kris wasn't sure how to take all this but was getting a kick out of Susie's reactions.

""Yeah, moral support all the way!"" Martlet cheered.

""Say, are you related to Berdly?"" Susie raised an eyebrow.

""Um...no?"" Martlet said. ""I was born in Japan alongside Kanako.  What, just because we're bluebirds doesn't mean...""

""Oh, they're cousins."" Kris snickered.

""KRIS, STOP THAT!!"" A vein popped out of Martlet's forehead. ""For the 1000th TIME I'M NOT RELATED TO BERDLYYY!!""

""I think he heard that."" Kris held up their phone, a said face emoji from Berdly popping up.

""GRAHH!"" Martlet shouted.

""Y'know Kris, I think I like her."" Susie grinned, elbowing their ribs.

""I suppose going back to Toriel's is out of the question?"" Ceroba knelt behind Kris, brushing their unkempt hair. ""What cheap apple shampoo...""

""HEY THAT IS QUALITY!"" Susie yelled.

""Um...sure, my apologies..."" Ceroba glanced at Susie then quickly back to Kris' hair.

With that, the ornate gate behind the lot of them opened and Carol Holiday came out to greet the assembled party, wondering what the commotion was all about.

""I take it this was not the intended way you meant to say hello?"" Carol noted, extending a friendly hand out to Ceroba who took it in jest.

""Of course not, Mayor Holiday.  It is nice to see you again."" Ceroba smiled, standing up.

""Kris thinks very highly of you and your family.  The week they spent out there with you and yours was a very memorable experience for them."" Carol noted. ""I'm only sorry they could not get back out there.""

""My inquiries into their situation went unanswered.  I saw the notes from therapy sessions...very concerning."" Ceroba noted. ""If only you'd let them stay when they asked the first time.""

""They had responsibilities at home.  Their parents were in the middle of a divorce after all.  I wanted to be there to support them as you are now."" Carol responded.

Looking to Kris, they only looked away not wanting to give away their conflict but could tell they wanted to say SOMETHING.  Ceroba sighed, choosing neutral ground for now.  They were here primarily for Kris...YES...but they were also here for something else.  

""Maybe we should speak inside...in private.  I don't want to upset Kris and their friends here, after all.  What do you all say...private buffet?"" Ceroba looked to Carol who glanced over at Susie, rolling her eyes. ""What's the matter?""

""Umm...me and the mayor kinda had a falling out...yesterday..."" Susie began.

""IF YOU PROMISE TO BEHAVE...I'll let it go."" Carol said. ""But...BUT...if I catch you even so much touch my daughter the wrong way, believe me...my stay of execution will not stay at all.""

""Y-Yes ma'am."" Susie gulped.

""Fine...shall we inside?"" Carol grimaced.

Hi folks, 36/f here, and I’ve been battling the OCD/Body Focused Repetitive Behavior, Trichotillomania for at least 30 years; I don't remember a single day of my life where I wasn't pulling my hair out. I've also struggled with Arithmomania (compulsive counting) and CPTSD-related sensory issues, trying several medications over the years, therapists, and EMDR, which was helpful for panic/anxiety but not much else.

In the beginning of January 2026, just 6 weeks ago and completely unrelated to my mental health, I started a daily habit of drinking loose Oolong tea. Over the last 2 weeks, I have noticed significant changes in myself and went searching for any sort or correlation since taking up a tea habit had been the biggest change in my life. What I found as I kept digging was shocking. 

The changes: 
• Trichotillomania, significantly gone from 100+ hairs/day pulled for 30+ years, to 1-3/day when I started counting, to currently 0/day over the last 5 days. The urge is gone.

• Arithomania, gone completely.

• Sleep, greatly improved, wake up less throughout the night, very well rested and energized in the morning.

• No pain, any random aches and pain gone,  back/arm pain I would have while laying on my side in bed, forcing me to get up is gone, no random stomach pains 

• Mental sharpness, brain fog is gone, memory is improved, even things like the bright lights in my office have been less overwhelming

The science:

• In 2025, there was a preclinical study done in China on Autistic rats and concentrated high doses of Oolong given to them, resulting in a large decrease in their over-grooming after 4 weeks, similar to Body Focused Repetitive Behaviors. 

• Due to its partial oxidation, Oolong contains specific polyphenols not in green or black tea that act as a master switch for the TLR-4/NF-κB pathway, which controls neuroinflammation in the brain's cortex.

• Recent research suggests that neuroinflammation could be the cause of several diseases, mental problems, and chronic pain. 

My protocol:

• 40-60 oz of liquid Oolong throughout the day

• I double steep; 2 spoonfuls of loose Oolong in my 40 oz pot, finish pot 1 and refill using the same leaves

• The long steep; I don't remove the leaves, the more ""tea solids"" consumed, the more benefits, which is also why I think loose tea could have added value

• No dairy, the casein in dairy milk can bind to polyphenols, interfering with abosorbtion

• I did consciously stop drinking both Coffee and 
Alcohol late 2025, but I had not been a regular user of either one

This has been a life changing experience for me in just a few weeks. I have eyelashes for the first time in my life, and my mind has a sense of peace I've never quite felt due to being stuck in in a combination of behavioral loops and sensory overload for so long. If anyone reading this has similar struggles, I highly recommend a deep dive. This is all very new to me and I'm not well versed in the science, only after my experience did I go searching for answers on what could have had such a profound impact on my overall well-being, so I welcome any questions, concerns, experiences, and I'm happy to go into more detail regarding any part of my own experience. 
Thank you for reading.

I emailed some other companies to learn how much of their production is done in Canada, and here are their reponses.

Munchie's Fine Tea & Coffee:

""We have always done our own roasting, blending and packaging in BC. However, almost all tea and coffee originate from outside North America. By majority, coffee grows in the southern hemisphere and tea is grown in Asia (with some exceptions like Kenya and Brazil). While we and our recipes are entirely Canadian, we do not declare our products as Made in Canada because many are rightfully are a blend of several nations’ products (or one location, if it’s single origin). We value all growing regions: the flavours of tea and coffee are greatly affected by the soil and climate in which they’re grown, so you will often see origins mentioned in our ingredients lists or titles. Our baked goods are a Product of Canada, made by Murchie’s at our kitchen in Victoria.""

David's Tea:

""DAVIDsTEA is headquartered in Montréal, Canada, where all shipping, labeling, and packaging are done at their facility in Montreal, Quebec. The tea ingredients themselves are sourced from tea gardens all around the world.""

Genuine Tea:

""Our teas are sourced from various State farmers throughout the tea growing regions in Asia. All of our teas are blended and packed in-house, in Canada, from our warehouse in Scarborough.""

Say Tea:

""Production varies from season to season but approximately 1/3 to 1/2 of our teas are made to our recipes by our German blenders/suppliers and 1/2 to 2/3 are blended in Canada.""",15,1771289350.0,BuyCanadian,14,1.0,False

I’m a trans man who has mostly dated/hooked up with men, but now live somewhere without much of a men’s community and have started dating women. I’ve had some issues with women here taking their trauma around misogyny out on me and (among other boundaries) told myself I’d never date a woman who said she wasn’t very interested in dating men again.

I’ve spent some time with this girl and developed a crush on her. I feel like she’s definitely attracted to me. I asked her to grab drinks and paid for both of us. Conversation’s always easy with her. We were heading to an event afterwards and when I was parking she said something about not being interested in dating men. I had been planning on asking her out and felt both nervous and excited about it because I was confident she was into me. I said something along the lines of “I know you just said you aren’t interested in dating men, but I was gonna ask if I could take you on a proper date.” And she said yes.

Even though I told myself I would not date another girl who said she wasn’t interested in dating men, on an impulse I asked her out anyway. I wish I reached differently by saying “damn that’s too bad—I was planning on asking you out but I respect that” or something. 

To be clear: I don’t think this girl owes me anything just because I took her out for drinks. There’s nothing wrong with not being interested in men, but it’s better not to date them if that’s how you feel! It’s weird to say you’re not interested in men and spend hours going for walks, grabbing coffee, getting a drink and say yes to going on a date with one. On my end I also regret asking her out, it was impulsive and I had been nervous/excited about asking her out and waiting for the right moment to do and I asked before I thought it through. 

I made the mistake of dating a girl in the past who said she was more interested in dating femmes, but was attracted to me and kept dating me. So now what? There’s a lot of things I like about her, and I got the sense that she had dated mostly if not only men, so I thought she’d be into me.

4 years ago, we fell out because I felt really hurt by some things she did. At the time, I was upset and felt wronged, and my current best friend was very supportive of me through that. Over the past four years, I’ve had time to reflect and I’ve come to understand her perspective more. The resentment I had is gone and when she reached out recently I decided to give it another chance.

I ended up meeting up with my former friend for coffee anyway and honestly it felt right. I enjoyed being friends with her again and didn’t feel any of the old tension or resentment. We’ve even made plans to see each other again.

The issue is that I haven’t been fully open with my current best friend about the fact that we’re actively rebuilding the friendship. She has my location, so she would know if I’m with her, but I haven’t outright said “we’re friends again.” Part of me feels guilty and anxious about it because I know she won’t be happy I’m worried she’ll go distant or act weird for weeks if I tell her. I’m scared of hurting her or damaging our friendship especially since she was there for me when everything originally happened.

How do I get him to confess?,"Me and my fiance have been together for a year now. He has 3 kids with two different baby mamas. The kids are 9,5 and 2. His most recent baby mama has made it a challenge for him to see the kids after they separated. So they had a mediation and she requested that me and her meet before meeting the kids. Of course I respected this and we met for coffee. My fiance has always told me she was very manipulative and will act overly friendly to get me on her side and twist things to go her way. However I’m starting wonder if that is not entirely true. I met her and we talked for several hours. I was the one that wanted to know more about the dynamics of their relationship. The first thing she asked me was if he had disclosed his STDs to me. I was dumbfounded by this as I was the one that found the STDs on him, and when it happened he acted completely clueless on the idea. That he had never seen it before and we went to the doctor to get it checked. He got it tested they confirmed it was herpes. He cried when we went home that day and said “why does this have to happen when I finally find a girl that I love” I consoled him and reassured him everything would be ok and we would work through it. I recently found out that I tested positive myself for herpes.. his ex showed me receipts of messages he had sent her when they broke up saying “good luck giving everyone herpes like you did to me” and then she also showed me messages of texts he sent to another girl he had hooked up with after they broke up and it was him apologizing to her for his poor judgment of not disclosing the STD to her. His ex told me she was diagnosed when she had their first born in 2020 and she let him know about it. I explained this to him and his testimony is that she told him this and that he was in the middle of being a  dad to a new born so he kind of brushed it off and forgot about it and that the ex made him disclose the herpes to the other women that he slept with when they broke up.. which I believe because rightly so but who would just forget about their partners dx of herpes? The real kicker is this though. The other baby mama. We will just call her BM number 2.I talked to her more recently and she told me he also gave her an STD. She also informed me that he had tried to propose to her which BM number 1 had told me and I confronted him about it and he said that wasn’t true. This was all brought up unprompted by her. I know that is sort of unrelated to the post but really just adds to the drama of this whole thing. and to make matters worse they both had said things got worse after they were pregnant.. it scares me a whole bunch. Ive stopped planning a wedding and have pretty much put our future on hold until I can get a grip of this whole situation. He continues to remain innocent in all of this. He has no idea however that I talked to BM 2 and I have to keep it that way for her sake. The hardest part for me is that I hear all of this but part of me does not want to believe it is all true. He continues to tell me he didn’t know he had it and he is not a bad person like that. But I’m having such a hard time trusting him now and I go back and forth in my head all day long on if I should give him another chance or not. It’s absolutely exhausting. I’ve come to a point where I feel like I’m just going to go completely insane trying to figure this out rationally in my head. That why I have come here honestly.

1r6renc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r6renc,Signed Book 309: Why Machines Learn: The Elegant Math Behind Modern AI — Anil Ananthaswamy,"Today I review a book I just finished yesterday and I must admit, I feel a little sheepish about this one. I picked up ""Why Machines Learn"" from the Bookhive in Bangalore, believing the comforting promise that it “dumbs down” the maths behind modern AI. Armed with that reassurance and a reasonably inflated opinion of my own mathematical abilities, I confidently set out to climb what I now realise was 'Mount Improbable'.

The central idea of the book, beautifully laid out by Anil Ananthaswamy, is that today’s AI revolution rests on a surprisingly small toolkit: linear algebra, calculus, probability, optimisation, and a dash of information theory much of it centuries old. The narrative unfolds chronologically, from early symbolic AI and its limitations to the slow, inevitable rise of statistical learning. So far, so good. I was nodding along happily.
Then came the maths.
Linear models and high dimensional geometry? I’d say I grasped a solid 80% (on a generous day). Gradient descent and optimisation? Nothing. Regularisation and overfitting? I understood the words, not the idea. Kernels and feature spaces? Complete darkness. Probabilistic models and inference? Maybe 50%, with effort and coffee. By the end, the maths had thoroughly humbled me, despite the author’s sincere attempts to hold my hand.
What saved the book for me and kept me turning pages instead of quietly giving up was its storytelling. Ananthaswamy weaves in biographies, rivalries, breakthroughs, and dead ends from the lives of researchers, making the abstractions feel human. This stopped the book from becoming a dry technical slog and reminded me that science progresses through confusion as much as clarity.
The book was largely written before ChatGPT burst into public consciousness in 2022, but this paperback edition includes an epilogue connecting large language models to the mathematical ideas discussed earlier. That section was particularly rewarding though, true to form, the maths still outran me.

Overall, if you’re genuinely interested in both maths and AI, this book is an eye opener into how machines actually learn and how much of it is elegant probability rather than magic. It also gently but firmly reminds us that human brains don’t work the same way: mathematically speaking, AI still doesn’t think like we do.

As for me? I walked away wiser, more informed and significantly more respectful of gradient descent.",2,1771288975.0,Indianbooks,0,1.0,False

One was a chill match-3 that actually felt relaxing and had no stupid energy timers. Pleasant surprise. Another was an idle RPG that somehow kept me coming back for a few days even though I hate most idle stuff. Then there was a pixel roguelike with hilariously bad touch controls and way too many ads between runs.

1r6rbat,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r6rbat,"In November 2000, a 66 year old cancer patient named Leland Alton Jones vanished from Peoria, Arizona","Leland Jones had battled cancer for 25 years when he vanished in November 2000.  Very few details were released in the case. 

The details we know was he was last seen alive shopping at the Peoria Bazaar in the 8500 block of West Grand Avenue on November 18th 2000. 

On November 24th 2000, his Red Dodge Caravan was discovered abandoned at an undisclosed location in the Gila Indian Reservation, some 45 miles southeast of the store. There was no sign of Leland.

Jones sister Clovis Gordon claimed Leland would have been in ""terrible pain"" without his medication, and that a worker at the Peoria Bazaar did verify they saw him at the shop. 

Clovis said that despite living with a cancerous brain tumor, Leland was not suicidal. She stated he had a loaded gun in his house and could have committed suicide long ago. She feared Leland was robbed and murdered. 

Only one article was published in the newspaper discussing his disappearance in the week his car was found.

Leland suffered from a disfigurement caused by his cancer surgeries. He would be 91 years old now. He was 6'3 inches tall and 300 pounds with grey hair and blue eyes. His right ear was surgically removed which left him with an exposed bone.

It has not been disclosed if the case has being investigated recently by the Phoenix Police Department. Or if any forensic work was conducted on the Caravan.

*The lonely, grey wolf did not acclimate to its innate nature to hunt and consume.  When not with the pack the wolf helped smaller creatures of the forest, offering them passage across great distances and protecting them from other predators in exchange for knowledge.*

*“Does he know his name is Anyu?” one of its passengers asked another, a squirrel.*

*The wolf didn’t know it even had a name.  The other wolves did too, but names were useless to them; they only knew to hunt, prey and eat.*

*During a full moon, a wolf can attain higher levels of consciousness, but this knowledge was lost and wolves now howl at the moon in frustration.  They become more cunning hunters every moon cycle, eventually they could consume everything if not stopped.*

My daughter is a good writer for her age.  I really shouldn’t be reading her personal journal, but she leaves it out on the coffee table every night.

***Chapter 2 – The Madcap***

*All creatures of the forest have their secrets, including wolves.  Over time the pack split into two factions.  Thirteen in total, Anyu only needed a full moon- the 13th moon- to convert the good-natured wolves and outnumber the others; the older, deadliest killers.  The maddest of them all being Blackie, their natural leader.  Sometimes called “The Madcap” by deer who were Blackie’s primary target.  At night Blackie was invisible except for its green eyes.  A pure black wolf lurking in the brush, the sight of it alone would scare off other wolf packs.* 

*No creature could defeat it, except one, the unlikeliest creature one could imagine.*

I may need to show my wife this, but I don’t want to interrupt my daughter’s writing, I was really getting into this children’s tale written by my child.

 ***Chapter 3 – The Meeting***

*The creatures convened at dawn to discuss their plan.  Wolves usually slept in their caves during this time.*

*“We are smarter than a pack of wolves, we have to work together.” a fox said.*

*The eagles and hawks agreed. The eagles said they could attack wolves from the air but were no match when on ground.*

*Anyu was torn; he knew the creatures were right, yet he was very hungry.  The largest, friendliest bears offered their help too.*

 ***Chapter 4 – The Moth***

*“We must find the yellow moth!” The toad exclaimed, the old toad being the wisest of the creatures.  With the ability to live on land and in water, the toad held the most secrets.  The turtles protected the toad for this reason.*

*The Yellow Moth had one ability that none other possessed, the power of distraction.  In no way was the moth a nuisance, like they are to humans, but the opposite, they are revered and respected at a distance by most other creatures.  The wolves didn’t know this and would sometimes follow the moth, getting separated from the pack and eventually dying alone.* 

*The monarch butterflies also possess this ability, but they flew in large numbers making the solitary moth’s power more acute.  There are stories of the moth shooing humans away from the forest using their ability of distraction.* 

*Sometimes the most powerful beings are the most benign.*

During a dinner party at our neighbor’s house, I showed the journal to my wife, and she agreed it was very good.  Our neighbor, Anna, a creative writer herself, said she’d speak to a publisher when the time was right.  Venison was served with roast duck and other locally sourced fare cooked by Anna’s husband, a master chef at a local restaurant. 

Where we lived, we could hear wolves howling at night.

 ***Chapter 5 – The 13******^(th)*** ***Moon***

*The forest council sent a messenger to the moth, a sparrow, and the moth agreed to help.  Although the moth didn’t communicate with us, it spoke to the wise toad directly.*

*The moth revealed it was most vibrant during a full moon, glowing brightest at midnight, the prime time to take down The Madcap.*  
   
*Man doesn’t understand insects exist in a dimension orthogonal to the human world.  They could easily destroy the earth; thus, they are seemingly smaller in size to us.* 

*Only certain sacred plants allow humans to see the insects in their true form.  These plant secrets are guarded by the Shamans, allies of the forest creatures, but they cannot themselves intervene in natural law.*

 ***Chapter 6 – The River***

*Anyu told the creatures that Blackie led the pack to a certain part of the forest near the river during a full moon, the night of their greatest feast.*  
   
*The moth hid itself behind a tree until Blackie’s pack awoke from their slumber.  The moth had another ability the other creatures didn’t know it had; it could see Blackie’s whole form. It wasn’t invisible to the moth as it was to us at night.  Even though the moth was placing itself in danger, it knew when Blackie spotted it, it had control over Blackie’s pack-mind.  The moth could fly faster than the pack could run, and it flew in the direction of the moon over the river as the pack ran off a cliff into the water below.  Some survived and ran away, but The Madcap had fallen.  Hawks and eagles swooped down and feasted on the beast as it struggled to swim back to shore; the bears prevented Blackie from reaching safety.  The Madcap was defeated.*

I noticed a yellow moth on my daughter’s window hovering near the spotlight.  This must be the “yellow moth” from her tale.  It was very large and beautiful.

My daughter then came strolling out of the forest.  How did she go there unnoticed?  Behind her was a large, grey wolf.

I ran outside thinking she was in danger, but the wolf was docile as described in her story.  I felt like I was part of the tale now.

My daughter said to the wolf, “Anyu, you’ve been very good.  You may feast now.”",1,1771288572.0,ShortSF,0,1.0,False

I’ll be GMing, and I’d love to run games in a public space like a coffee shop, library room, or similar chill venue. I’m aiming for a cozy, beginner-friendly table with 3–4 players total.

Primary game: Daggerheart

That said, I’ve been in the hobby a long time and own a pretty big library of systems if the group ever wants to branch out (D&D 3e/4e/5e, Pathfinder 2e, Starfinder, Star Wars Saga, Monster of the Week, Thirsty Sword Lesbians, Worldwide Wrestling, and more).

What I’m aiming for:

Beginner friendly and welcoming

Episodic, drop-in friendly structure (easy to miss a week without killing the story)

PG–13 tone overall

Mix of fantasy and sci-fi adventures depending on group vibe

Collaborative, story-first energy

Scheduling:

Looking at Monday or Saturday evenings.

Table culture matters to me:

I want this to be a relaxed, inclusive space where people can show up as themselves. LGBTQ+ friendly, zero tolerance for harassment or bigotry. Just good people telling cool stories together.

If you’re local to Hillsdale (or nearby) and have been wanting a low-pressure way to get into tabletop or find a new group, feel free to comment or DM me!",1,1771288248.0,lfg,0,0.67,False

(He’s not mean by any chance, he just finds them funny. And today at work I began thinking about all the things I need to do throughout the day to cope with it. I’ll start.

Mornings:

I wake up, go to the bathroom, first I pee, then brush my teeth. Then apply micellar water first on my eyes, then on my cheeks and then the rest of my face. In that order. Then I comb my hair.

Then I go the the kitchen to make myself a small cup of coffee, with the same mug and spoon every day (if I hadn’t washed it and I need to use another, I feel weird) I put two spoonfuls of instant coffee, half boiled water, a quarter of semi skim milk, and a quarter of semi skim milk, oatmeal flavored. I prepare my lunch the night before, but in the mornings I put the dressing on my salad and put everything into the lunchbox.

Then I go to get dressed with the clothes I got set the night before. I haven’t done this for too long, but it was distressing picking up the clothes in the morning, it took too long, even though I’ve always checked the week’s weather in advance and think of my outfit for the week, also in advance. And all the colors need to match. Then I put my jewelry on, always matching to my outfit.

Then I go to the bathroom, wash my teeth again and apply makeup, matching to my outfit, and always with a bit of glitter. First, my eyes, then my cheeks, then the lipstick, always the same order. Then I pee again, comb my hair, and pick my bag up, after checking that I carry everything, including my stim toy. And my noise canceling headphones because the commuting can be very overwhelming (I take the bus and the subway). Before I notice, 1:30 hours have passed.

Then at lunch, at least at my current job, I eat alone (it’s not a problem for me, I work at front desk and I’m in constant contact with people, so I need to recharge) listening to music and reading a book. Then I go for an after lunch smoke, go back to the office and brush my teeth, apply deodorant, parfum,

comb my hair and go back to work.

Before I leave work, it depends where I’m heading at, but I always go to the bathroom and perform my ritual again.

Then, once I get home, I take a shower. if I wash my hair, first I apply shampoo (always the same brand) wash it off, then conditioner, then I apply shower gel on my body, wash it off and then the conditioner.

Then I set my clothes for the next day, and get my bag also ready.

Then I prepare dinner and lunch for the day after. It varies, but the meal needs to have bell peppers (red, yellow and green), chives and lots of spices. 

I eat while watching a series, 40 minutes tops, I go to the bathroom and fall asleep.

These rituals comfort me but they are very time consuming, I never go to before 12:30 am, and I wake up around 6:30 am, so I sleep very little.

**Body Build:** Muscular, Mesomorph

**Skin Tone:** Pale

**Eye Colour:** Crimson Red

**Aura Colour:** Crimson Red

**Hair Colour:** Dark brown with white highlights

**Faunus Features:** Large hawk wings

**Appearance:** Aureliusz’ appearance is distinguished by his youthful handsomeness and elegance. Aureliusz is a tall, sturdily built young man, standing at approximately 6’4 in height. Aureliusz is the virtual image of ancient Greek fantasy, a herculean figure of immense strength that is displayed in each strand of taut muscle and sinew. His skin is fair. His nose and lips are reminiscent of an ancient sculptor's artwork, hawklike in structure. 

His crimson red eyes are cold and focused, eyelashes long and luxurious, often touted as beautiful and ambitious. He has slightly curly and gorgeous long shoulder-length luscious locks of hair that cascade down and spill over his shoulders and brush onto his upper chest. His hair is a dark brown shade, speckled with white highlights to match with his wings. His eyebrows are narrow and sharp, contrasting with his serious demeanour. He is frequently described as handsome, even amongst his peers. 

As his faunus trait, Aureliusz possesses large, majestic feathered appendages, making him capable of flight. His wings are brown on the top, with the inner wings being patterned with pale white horizontal bars. 

**Outfit:** Aureliusz’ outfit is bold and ceremonial; a tribute to his family’s monarchical roots. He wears a rich red tunic with gold accents, fitted underneath layers of plate armor. Across his body he wears a shiny steel chest plate, articulated shoulder guards, arm bracers, and thigh plates, all trimmed with small gold rivets. A black leopard fur trimmed sash is draped over his shoulder. He wears a pair of golden boots that reach to the knee, with black toe caps and spurs. Thick leather gloves cover his large hands. Atop his head, he wears a high quality conical helmet designed for mobility and protection. A tall, fan-shaped crest runs from front to back, flaring outwards like a pair of wings. A plate protects the face at the front of the helmet with a large black beak protrusion, projecting the image of an avian warrior. 

# Main Weapon Information

**Weapon Name:** Reclaimer

**Weapon Capabilities:** Reclaimer is a sabre gunblade with a revolving chamber. The body of the blade itself is infused with wind dust, allowing for increased striking speed and quick drawing capability, which works in perfect synchronicity with his fighting style, Iaido. He is able to deliver wind-boosted attacks while also being capable of firing dust bullets at his opponents, always ensuring that his enemy is on the defensive. His fighting style is a mixture of defensive and offensive. The weapon can transform into a secondary mode by locking the blade into the scabbard, mechashifting into a long, high speed lance capable of shooting out wind boosted shockwaves. Prior to its transformation, the scabbard can be used as a blunt striking object or as an object to imbue his aura into, turning it into a small shield.

**Gunblade:** The gunblade is a curved sabre with a single-edged blade and a firearm assembly integrated inches away from the hilt of the blade. The blade itself is slim, slightly forward curved for precise and surgical slicing and quick draw cuts. The design of the blade is optimised for Iaido-style quick draw slashes. The revolving chamber is a cylinder set near the guard, which cycles through and fires dust-infused rounds, providing further complexity in combat scenarios. It can sustain fire or snap shots during or immediately following his weapon draw. When drawn, compressed wind surges and builds along the blade, further boosting draw speed, cutting force and momentum. This is visibly displayed as a sharp pressure ripple or distortion. 

Reclaimer is built around the practice of using Iaido, implementing it into every faucet of its design. Wind dust releases upon unsheathing when making a quick draw attack. A properly timed draw can extend the cut with compressed air or slightly knock his opponent off balance with enough force. This fighting style encourages a rhythm, consistently drawing and striking. This fighting style requires skill, precision, timing and patience to master.

**Scabbard:** Reclaimer’s scabbard can also be used as a temporary weapon. It is a blunt weapon made of reinforced steel. The scabbard can be used for deflecting light attacks, parrying and riposting light blows and Pommel style strikes against his opponent. Aureliusz is able to manifest and channel his aura into the scabbard as a form of aura technique, turning the scabbard into a compact, directional shield which can be used to block gunfire or strikes in short bursts. Another form of aura technique is Aureliusz generating an aura projectile, then encasing it inside wind to increase its speed and striking potential.

**Lance:** Reclaimer’s secondary transformation is the lance form. The blade of Reclaimer locks firmly into the scabbard, causing the weapon to undergo a radical transformation. The weapon extends and mechashifts into an elongated lance. The body of the lance becomes reinforced by the wind dust already imbued into the gunblade. The lance is long and sleek, with a slight curvature retained at the tip snaking down the body of the lance towards the hilt. The lance is optimised for charges and aerial thrusts, used in combination with his wings and especially his semblance. 

Wind dust is able to build a substantial gust within the curvature, which is released as compressed wind bursts and shockwaves. This allows Aureliusz to propel forward with greater speed mid charge and break through his opponent’s guard. This fighting style is incredibly versatile and mobile, allowing Aurelius’ to control the verticality and momentum of the fight and control the battlefield to his behest. 

# Semblance Information

**Semblance Name:** Tempest of Victory

**Semblance Capabilities:** Tempest of Victory allows Aureliusz to generate a single, continuous path of wind, a controlled current that exists in space rather than a temporary burst of blast. This wind path manifests in the colour of his aura, appearing as a crimson torrent flowing through the air. The wind exists to carry and accelerate Aureliusz forward, enhancing his mobility while mid-air during flight. 

The wind path reduces drag and resistance of Aureliusz’ wings, enhancing his acceleration, turning speed and allowing for sudden stops or reversals. This semblance not only synergises with his faunus trait, but also with his weapon. When Reclaimer is locked into its lance configuration, Aureliusz can align his wind path directly along the vector of his charge. The path stabilises his flight during a speeding thrust, preventing loss of control or recoil, making his charges precise and guided. When the wind boosted shockwaves from Reclaimer are fired within the wind path, they travel farther with less dispersion and the impact force is increased due to compressed airflow.

The wind path allows for mid-air course correction. This means that Aureliusz can attack from unexpected angles, making it difficult to predict. For instance, he can adjust his angle within the path, spiral or corkscrew or gracefully curve around obstacles before striking at his opponent. This allows Aureliusz to perform high risk, high reward advanced applications, which require immense skill and flawless timing to perform, such as creating a vertical wind path and diving along it with his lance, releasing a high intensity shockwave upon impact.

**Semblance Limits:** Aureliusz is only able to maintain a single wind path simultaneously. Creating a new one will instantly collapse the previous path. The semblance requires for an existing windflow to already be present within the environment. Open environments are best, semi-open spaces such as streets are possible but limited, requiring tactical ingenuity on Aureliusz' part to perform safely and effectively. Fully enclosed spaces are not possible unless an airflow exists or is artificially created. 

Wind Dust can be used as a substitute for an absent windflow and can act as an artificial airflow source. However, dust created paths are shorter lived than a natural formation and burn rapidly through dust. These are often less stable and therefore unreliable to use unless absolutely necessary.

Maintaining a wind path consumes a significant portion of aura per burst. Maintaining it is relatively low cost, but sudden sharp turns or rapid changes in movement can increase the drain exponentially. It costs roughly 12-15% aura to create a wind path, then 2% aura per 5 seconds of sustained use. Prolonged use can lead to Aurelius’ wings becoming fatigued and reduced control mid-flight.

**Personality:** Aureliusz is a cold, calculating and ruthless individual driven by an intense pursuit to revolutionise Atlas by restoring the monarchy and bring change to the corrupt society of Atlas. His voice is quite high, distinctive, slightly nasally, and holding a calm tone that remains imposing and authoritative. Aureliusz belongs to a cadet branch of the former royal family of Atlas, who were ousted from power following the conclusion of the Great War. Therefore, Aureliusz believes that he is the true heir to the throne denied to his family a 100 years prior. 

Ambitious, brave and determined, Aureliusz is only hindered by his immeasurable pride and warlike nature. He is a firm believer in ‘Might makes Right’, believing that those with superior power are fit to decide and control society for their own ends. Aureliusz came to this conclusion by researching heavily into figures such as Nicholas Schnee, who used his power and influence to transform the Schnee Dust Company from a family business into an continental economic empire. He has long term ideas and plans for changing and reforming his nation for the better, genuinely seeking to improve the lives of the lower class. 

He holds an immense disdain towards the decadent elitist political class of Atlas, viewing them as a bloated, stagnant and corrupt system that has caused a complete moral decline both in Atlas and Mantle. He sees the aristocracy and corporations as a symptom of a bigger problem, mainly the incompetence of the council and the SDC’s stranglehold over the political monopoly. 

He ardently hates the elite for their persecution of his family, as they systematically targeted them to ensure that they can never rise to power again. This abuse of authority drove him to want to become a huntsman and attain political power through the Atlas Academy, seeking radical reform by ascending the ranks. He displays a great measure of respect for General James Ironwood despite being a part of the system he despises. 

Aureliusz grew up in Mantle and sympathises with the problems of the lower class, as well as his fellow faunus brethren who were used as cheap labour by the SDC. He sympathises with the views of the White Fang but disagrees with their methods, believing that their short sighted goals will only end in mutual destruction and furthering the boundaries between humanity and faunuskind with more hatred. He believes change must be made internally and systematically. 

Aureliusz is incredibly intelligent and talented, espoused by his peers to be a prodigy. He can also be described as a political idealist and a visionary with his own goals and views in mind for Atlas and Mantle. His nigh-unfaltering confidence, charisma, and refusal to cater to those with noble lineage garnered him a significant power base among the common class and dissatisfied nobles alike. He's unrelenting in his pursuit of power, and is willing to do whatever it takes to secure power for himself and safeguard his family from future persecution. 

Aureliusz is a fairly aloof and introverted individual, when he isn’t maintaining a mask of charisma. He is usually very reserved and doesn’t seem to have a wide group of acquaintances, preferring to be alone and he only uses extroverted thinking to execute his plans and reach his goals efficiently. Aureliusz struggles greatly with understanding and interpreting emotions and facial expressions. His demeanor is very stoic and he sometimes expresses difficulty in expressing vulnerability, pain or empathy to others and finds it challenging to connect with others on an emotional level. He finds it difficult at times to pick up on social cues and struggles with social interactions in general. 

However, his goals are ultimately selfish. He is very self-righteous despite his genuine desire to improve society, ultimately seeking to safeguard his family first and foremost. He is incredibly stubborn and refuses to yield, often overworking himself in extreme cases. He is characterized by a strong sense of justice and personal responsibility. He’s often seen as cool, collected and cold hearted to some due to his intensity. He displays intense focus and obsession in his pursuit of power and strength. His relentless drive to become stronger and surpass his limits borders to the point of obsession. Aureliusz holds a code of honour and respects others for their strength and motivation, while simultaneously looking down on those who fight for no greater purpose or dream.

During the Vytal Festival, his short term goal is to best Phyrra in combat during the Vytal Tournament. By proving his superiority in strength, he seeks to gain favour amongst his peers and further consolidate a political powerbase, gaining more influence and distinction while he rises the ranks of the Atlas Academy. He also seeks to defeat Isolde Kolbeck, his personal rival. Aureliusz is an honourable fighter and despises cowardice and inefficiency.

Aureliusz’ intense rivalry with Isolde stems from deep-seated anger following a misunderstanding, where Aureliusz was defeated by Isolde during a training exercise and misinterpreted Isolde’s facial expression as a mocking one. Ever since, he has made it his personal mission to defeat Isolde and prove his superiority over the Valkyrie warrior. Aureliusz projects his superiority complex onto Isolde in reaction to her defeating him, viewing her as weak and an unworthy warrior to fight.

# Background Information

***CW: Death***

Backstory: 

Aureliusz Mieczysław was born to a poor aristocratic family. This aristocratic family were once a powerhouse both politically and militarily and were a cadet branch to the royal family that held authority and dominion over the Kingdom of Atlas over a century ago, who were ousted from power following the conclusion of the Great War. In response to an attempted coup d'état to seize power by royalists still loyal to the throne, this half of the royal family were banished from Atlas and forced to relocate to Mantle, where they have existed separately from the Atlas elite.

The boy was raised alongside his sister and younger sibling. His father was a successful politician who spoke openly against the cruel business practices of the SDC and stood up for the welfare of Faunus and citizens alike. Their family held a measure of influence in political spheres, though nowhere near the same measure of power they once held.

Aureliusz had a decent upbringing. The boy had a regular accent as he attended a public school rather than a private one, due to their family’s lowly wealth. He displayed a keen interest in the world and always looked up at the floating city of Atlas with sparkling eyes, wishing to visit it for himself, though it was impossible at the time. From a young age, he was noted as being a very intelligent and hard working boy.

Tragedy struck when his father was killed in an accident aboard his bullhead, causing a fiery crash. Aureliusz found his father’s corpse and was scarred by the image and grieved for several weeks. He was forced to take a role as a young carer at the age of only 11, caring for his little brother and sister alongside his mother.

He questioned the events surrounding his father’s death later in his teenage years, and speculated that his father may have been targeted by the SDC due to his comments and desire to expose their violation of human rights. Following years of unanswered questions, conflicting reports and the authorities refusing to investigate the circumstances behind his father’s death, speculation shifted to genuine belief as he began to harbour a deep seated hatred towards the upper class of Atlas. His new dream was calcified in his heart. He wanted power to rule over Atlas and abolish the council completely, in favour of restoring the monarchy. 

He expressed interest in attending combat school so he could become a huntsman. He wanted to become a huntsman for two key reasons. The first reason was to become stronger as a person and develop his skills in combat, the second was as a means of rising through the ranks in the military, allowing him to get closer to his goal. When he became old enough, he signed up to the nearest combat school and began to do combat training. He became very fond of training, especially with a blade. He had strayed far from the path that his father wanted for him, but he felt that he needed to do this to ensure his family’s safety. 

Aureliusz found it a little difficult to fit in at first. Many of the other students at the Academy hailed from a rich background and some of them looked down on him, viewing him as lesser or less worthy because of his faunus trait and pitiful wealth. He met a young girl named Isolde Kolbeck, a fellow hawk faunus who he shared interests with, particularly fighting and becoming a huntsman, though for differing reasons. 

The two spent time together as they became friends and began to train alongside one another, studying together and preparing for their time at Atlas Academy once they made the transition and passed their tests. Aureliusz grew fond of Isolde, but had not yet revealed to her why he wanted to become a huntsman.

During a training spar, their relationship took a turn for the worst due to a critical misunderstanding on Aureliusz’ part. The two engaged in a competitive spar which would determine who was the greater warrior in strength and skill. Aureliusz lost to Isolde after an arduous battle. 

While it stung greatly at his pride, he was willing to overlook it, however the expression Aureliusz saw on Isolde’ face filled him with great sorrow and rage. He interpreted Isodle’s expression as a snide, mocking expression, when in truth, she was actually smiling with happiness. He believed that she never truly cared for him and was just using him as a stepping stone. His emotions overwhelmed, the intense traumatic experience caused the hawk faunus to unlock his aura and caused him to develop an obsession with defeating her, as she was the one to unlock his strength. 

He viewed Isolde with resentment and hatred since that event and quickly cut ties, brushing her attempts to be friends off with cold dejection. His goal solidified in mind, he would eventually enroll at Atlas Academy and seek to defeat the greatest warriors in his past to gain power and work towards his end goal of restoring the monarchy and reclaiming his crown. 

# Memoirs of a future king

*My name is Aureliusz Mieczysław, son to a murdered father and the rightful heir to Mantle’s throne, now known as Atlas. What I write is a recollection of events from my perspective. I will not attempt to justify the atrocities of my family committed in the past.  I can only focus on what must be done in the present, based on my analysis of events.* 

*Firstly, I must provide context on my family, so what follows in this account can make sense to the casual reader. The Mieczysławs are a cadet branch to the royal family that ruled Mantle since its formation into an independent kingdom. My forefathers believed that the act of self expression and the arts was a hindrance to the nation, that the rights of citizens could be controlled through removing these elements and therefore make Mantle safe from the Grimm.* 

*This gave rise to abuses of power and human rights, namely the rise of slavery alongside their treaty with Mistral. I must preface this. I am staunchly against the actions that my family made in the past, which, of course, led to the disastrous Great War which has been recorded and written about in the decades spanning since.* 

*What followed afterwards was peace between the nations, following a decisive end to the war made possible by the King of Vale. The King of Atlas was present during the meeting and agreed to abolish the monarchy in favour of the King of Vale’s plan to construct four Huntsman Academies across the globe and replace the Mantle monarchy with a centralized council-based government composed of elected officials.*

*The King of Atlas acquiesced control to the new government, effectively allowing the royal family to rescind their sovereign authority and become an independent aristocratic family, rather than a governing force. The decision was met with heavy criticism from royalists who remained faithful to the monarchy and sympathetic to its continuation.*

*A political coup ensued, led by my great grandfather, the King of Atlas’ closely related cousin. My great grandfather believed that his claim to the throne was legitimate and that the act of demolishing the political order put Mantle at risk of decentralising, allowing our nation to fragment into infighting, greatly increasing the risk of Grimm attack. While managing to attract sympathisers to their cause, the royalists ultimately overestimated their support and were quickly suppressed*.

*This disastrous and desperate grasp for power was unsuccessful, and ultimately decided the fate of my family. My family, the cadet branch that led the coup, was banished from Mantle for their transgressions, cast aside and moved to the lower echelons of society, while Atlas rose to the heavens. Refusing the decision to execute his family, the King of Atlas instead opted for exile, allowing his branch of the royal family to smoothly assimilate with the aristocracy.* 

*I cannot, in good faith, defend the reckless actions of the royalists. However, I cannot forgive the transgressions imposed upon my family in the years following. We have been persecuted for the sins of the past. Shrouded in infamy. Our wealth reduced to scraps, our influence and reputation ran into the mud with impunity. The corporations that now govern Atlas have systematically targeted my family for decades, ensuring that we can never grow, only stagnate. They desire our extinction.*

*I do sit and ponder on why they would target us. Perhaps out of malice? Hate, fear? Or perhaps, they do not trust our family at all, based on events that transpired nearly a century ago.* 

*My father was murdered. Murdered, because of what he believed. Murdered, because of his history.* 

*My father was an intelligent and wise man, who spoke for the benefit of the common class. The boundaries between us and the common folk are so close, that we practically share the same breath. He earned their respect and sought to put an end to the treatment Faunus had undergone through the SDC. Tired, overworked, hungry and starved.* 

*He simply wanted to correct our family’s mistakes.* 

*And for that, he was killed.* 

*This is the only moment in this account where I allow myself indulgence in memory.*

*I discovered his corpse as a young boy. I was frolicking and playing at the time when I heard the news. How his bullhead had exploded mid flight and crashed into the streets. I ran as fast as my little legs could, wracked with exhaustion but floundering with worry, distressed about my father’s state.* 

*I ran and ran, and managed to slip past a barricade of officers blocking the road to the crash. The smoke stung at my lungs and made my eyes water, so I could not stay for long. I creeped through the refuse, stalking low so the black smoke could not fill and choke my small lungs. The smell hit my nostrils. A thick, nauseating aroma, a sulfurous, copper and foul odor that stung the back of the throat. My soft hand met charred skin, as my eyes took in the sight of the horrifying sight before me, permanently branded into my psyche.* 

*I never forgot that sight.* 

*I’ve pondered on the events around his death, as well as the circumstances following it. Based on my rational thinking and evidence gathered, I can say with certainty that his death was no accident. No mechanical failure, no error on the part of the pilot. His vehicle was sabotaged, rigged to explode because of the words he spoke. He voiced promises to challenge the SDC and the other corporations about their practices. Silenced, with only the harrowing cries of his widowed wife and fatherless children filling the void.* 

*Since then, I acted as a young carer for my dear sister and brother. They are safe, for now. I pray for their safety, in my absence. Mother will care for them, keep them sheltered from those who wish us harm.*  

*The council is a failed system. The governments do nothing as the elite that govern and control Atlas and Mantle can act with little care or course. Lives destroyed or ruined, innocent citizens suffering under their greed and carelessness.* 

*I will make it my mission to change the system. Radically reform it. A return to the monarchy and the abolishment of the council in favour of my leadership will make things right. Atlas’ corrupt society has taught me one crucial lesson. Might controls everything. I want the power to surpass them. Without power, I can do nothing. The will of a single man can change the course of history.* ",7,1771288092.0,RWBYOC,3,0.89,False

1r6r0xx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1r6r0xx/am_i_the_asshole_for_breaking_up_with_my_friend/,Am I the asshole for breaking up with my friend because she told me she's uncomfortable around me?,"This is my first time on Reddit so I hope I'm doing this right but I'm a long time listener that needs advice.

Yesterday I (31f) went to a bingo with my friend Sara (32f) that I've been friends with for about 4 months and Anna (33f) who I had never met before but Sara had a few times. She's also part of the same girls group on Facebook Messenger that me and Sara met on. We had a great time, I won some money (150 dollars, yay!) and they were excited for me even though they sadly didn't win anything. 
During the break when we all had coffee along with all the other players in the mingling area, Anna went to the bathroom and Sara started talking to me about how annoyed she was with her case worker. She said a rehab center she went to had lied about her not showing up to appointments which made her seem like a psychopath according to her (she has an invisible disability and is on benefits). She told me she threatened to involve a lawyer which made her social worker book a meeting for today with all involved parties.
 I was trying to be supportive, asked some clarifying questions and said I also disagreed with them lying about her although I felt a little bit uncomfortable with her being so loud and worked up over this when there were many people around us trying to enjoy their break. Then Anna came back, we finished our coffee and headed back to the bingo again.
When we were done and were walking to the tram station I remembered the meeting and said ""Good luck with the meeting tomorrow, I hope everything goes well!""
Sara thanked me and Anna asked what meeting we were talking about. Sara said it was a meeting with her doctors and social workers and I said ""Yeah, it's super weird because they're lying about her attendance on her rehab"". Anna also thought that was strange and wished her luck but we didn't stay further on the topic. In hindsight I totally take responsibility and admit that it wasn't my place to tell Sara's story although in the moment it didn't seem like a big deal.
When I got home, happy about making a new friend and winning some money I got a text from Sara. She explained that when I told Anna the specifics of her meeting I made her really uncomfortable but she didn't want to say anything then and there with the risk of making things awkward. She said that my comment made her decide that she don't want to talk to me about her private matters anymore and that she will be more withdrawn when we hang out in the future. 
I texted back that I fully respect her feelings, that I definitely wouldn't have said anything if I knew it would make her uncomfortable and that I'm really sorry for making her feel that way. I also said that her text made me feel a little uneasy because, although I fully understand that my comment was wrong, I explained that I didn't think it was fair to make such a drastic change in our friendship over it - especially since this was a first time error that wont happen again. 
She said that she was allowed to tell me that I made her uncomfortable which again I fully agree with but that I wasn't looking for a friendship where we can't show eachother grace and learn from our mistakes. I told her that this, along with her habit of changing plans last second and declining hanging out with me beyond keeping her company when she's shopping or the bingo, made me feel like an entourage more than a friend. She said that we should put the friendship on pause and I said that she should look for a new friend that won't make mistakes because I don't want to hang out and feel anxious about her being uncomfortable and holding back conversations with me. 

An important thing to note is that a while back we went to the same bingo, just me and her. We were talking about our life situations and she started asking me pretty invasive questions which I answered to the best of my comfort but in the end I had to respectfully decline talking deeper about my private life because we were in a room full of players, again enjoying their coffee. This situation gave me the impression that she's very open and unfazed about discussing private matters so her strong reaction over my comment doesn't make 100% sense to me. I didn't yell out that she pooped her pants, I just gave a little context the meeting.

better than the noise of living.

But the truth is never cinematic.

The truth is unfinished coffee cups,

texts left unread,

a room that still remembers laughter

long after a heartbeat leaves it.

The truth is that pain can look beautiful

when you’re tired enough 

like waves glittering at night

even while they pull you under.

So I sit with the thought

and refuse to crown it a hero.

I let it be what it is:

a whisper born from exhaustion,

not destiny.

Because somewhere inside me

there is still a stubborn pulse

that wants morning light,

warm hands,

another chance to feel chosen

by my own breathing.

I grieve something that my therapist says wasn't love but a trauma bond. That what started as love quickly turned when the abuse started. I am repeatedly asked what I think I miss when I say I miss you. 

Today another day of crying because I miss you and still love you with everything I am. Still I am told that is the trauma bond.

So I sit here crying wondering, wanting to ask you, did you ever love me? Was I anything to you? I think the answers will help but then when I'm honest with myself I know they won't. 

Do you have days like today? Everything triggers a new crying spell. A show about love and soulmates. I cry because I feel like you are mine and I am without you. A cup I put under the coffee machine spout. Crying again because you bought it. My bed huge but empty as I no longer sleep in it. I can't stand to lay where you once held me. My heart hurts everyday because we are not a couple. 

We did not have the skills needed to work through our problems. Our childhood never set the roots to know what healthy truly was. Past partners only gave us fears that we didn't know how to communicate to each other. Our family's did not like the other. Your friends thought you were angrier while with me. My friends thought you gaslit me and were abusive. (In all fairness my friends were right about the abuse) My kids feared you and I getting back together when we were apart. They didn't want me to go through more abuse. They loved you but hated how you were towards me. I let them down by staying for so many years. When I look at all of that, just that, I don't understand why I'm crying. I love you damn it, I love you and the above wasn't even half of it. 

I love you and always will. I love you, yet when I look at pictures I remember what happened just before or after that moment that would break me a little more. I love you, and remember every outing we were on was followed with abuse once we were alone. I love you even with it all I love you. I cry for you. I want you still. 

I have been in DV therapy for a year and a bit and still it hurts when I'm told if you loved me you wouldn't have done those things. Toxic is one thing but abusive is another. Did I love you right? No, of course I didn't. How could I when I didn't know how to. I loved you the only way I knew how and you loved me the only way you knew how. I sit here crying wanting you back even when I'm told what we had was only a trauma bond and nothing I did could have made you abusive. Damn it I need to know did you love me, did you? Please just be honest because it kills me to think my therapist is right and you never loved me. 

All of this, all of this breaks me and I know I'll never let another in because I'll never stop loving you. I know I can't send this to you so here is where it will stay. My questions will go unanswered my tears will continue to fall because I love you and I can't just let go. ",2,1771286951.0,UnsentLettersRaw,1,1.0,False

I already have spoken to my husband about this and ofc he's been understanding and supportive of my concerns and all. But I just need a different outlet. I don't really have any friends I'm close to anymore since this pregnancy and my family seems to all think the same.  
  
So I was recently informed at my 36w appointment that I have severe Polyhydramnios and due to the amount of excess fluid I'll need to be induced by 38 weeks since the odds of the fluid reducing to a safe enough level for non-medically induced labor before or after then are so low. Now, I have heard pretty much only horror stories of the pain of induction and how awful it is, so yeah im a bit nervous but not enough to second guess my decision to go through with it. I'll do whatever it takes to get my baby out safe, healthy, and alive.  
  
With that being said, up until that visit, I was planning on going unmedicated (still am unless medically necessary to be medicated) and up until now my baby has just been forecast as really big but otherwise perfectly healthy. So I've had no reason to doubt my ability to delivery him naturally when my body is ready. This news of induction, though exciting since I'll get to meet him 2 weeks sooner than predicated, was shocking and is making me kind of sad. I feel guilty.  
  
I feel like looking back on it I could've and should've done so much more to prevent this from happening and like my body isn't strong enough or that my baby won't come out the best and healthiest he could be because of my diet/exercise choices throughout pregnancy. I did stretch and move every day but did not stay consistent with the amount day to day due to my herniated disc and I have consumed honestly an ungodly amount of sugar mostly through ice cream and decaf coffees (I have completey stopped this since my diagnosis and cut out all artificial sugar).  
  
Anyway, even though I've presented this plain as day evidence to my parents about how medically necessary this induction is, my father keeps reminding me that I shouldn't make such sudden decisions, how scary and painful induction is, how I need to just listen to my body, etc. he even started talking about it to his older female coworkers and apparently they've all told him too this is a horribly painful and scary thing and that they wouldn't do it if they were me. Ofc I don't think he's telling them it's medically necessary but he's trying to use all their accounts against me and my decision to induce and both of them just seem so disappointed every time I confirm this is what I've decided to do.  
  
Listen to my body? My body is saying get this kid out alive! However necessary! It's very frustrating because ofc I wouldn't be doing induction at 38w if it wasn't medically necessary, but I really don't want my son born stillborn after I've spent the last 9 months carrying, bonding with, and loving him so I see this as necessary  
  
I know this might just sound like the obvious ""just ignore them"" scenario, but my parents (besides my husband) have been my only real rocks through this whole pregnancy and it just hurts that now here at the end I don't feel as supported as I guess I expected to feel at this point.  
  
Again, I don't WANT to be induced. Ofc I know it'll hurt and it's not on ""my body's time"". But I NEED my child to be born alive and well. That is the ONLY thing that matters to me. C-section, induction, however. I don't care. So I don't know why they do so much and why they feel the need to just fill me with fear and doubt less than 2 weeks before induction.

So...

Mandatory military service ruined my life. And something that I found funny was how disgusting I found nice officers to be. Not performatively nice. Like, actually nice officers. Recently, a counselor told me that conscription, or at least my experience of it, sounds like a form of institutional abuse. And that I'm traumatized. My mother- Who is a military veteran, but had a radically different experience and never experienced being a conscript- Has said the same thing.

Well, if it was abuse, then any of those officers who weren't abusers were still enablers. My mom will admit that. She'll admit she was. But I love her because she does everything that she can to understand me, now, and help me heal. Anyhow, there was this officer there, Katerina, I'd say she's in her 30s and was all motherly with me. I think what it was is that, like... Because I look like a girl? And I don't mean like a feminine boy, I mean, literally, people joke about me being basically a woman with a you-know-what. I don't care, I grew my hair out now because I refuse to cut it, I feel pretty. Anyway, at one point, my relationship was falling to bits and after not seeing my girlfriend for three months, I asked her if I could have time off. She felt awful about it, got me a long weekend, then. Or when she kept telling me about this ""cool"" barber down the road and how she'd be happy to give me the money since I apparently needed to get my hair cut because it was getting too long... Or when she gave me her phone number, or sends Christmas and birthday presents since I got back...

And looking back, I find her disgusting. I was falling to bits. So a few days ago, I snapped at her over the phone. Yeah, because I just LOVED her bringing me out for boring, stupid walks, going for coffees and as if it meant anything. But she's still friends with my parents, you know? Says that she wants to help me heal, and wants to give me something, if that's okay with me. I was hoping it would be something cool, so I thought, yeah, alright.

So... She had this bike. Not like a fucking Harley, I mean more like one of these moped things, hasn't used it in years and it's a bit old and all this, but said that me and my dad could maybe repair it and then I could use it. And I'm... Honestly, I'm offended. I'm completely offended.

Seriously, I get put through the most disgusting year of my life, being told by her to try and make the best of it, that maybe it's not all bad but just different, trying to be a fucking mom when the one I have is just fine- And for all that shit, I get this shitty bike? And repair work that you're supposed to pretend is rewarding when it's just shit? That's it? That's fucking IT?

After reading an article by Robert McKeon Aloe, I decided to test whether a Brix refractometer can handle filter coffee as well as it does espresso.

Unfortunately, to recreate his test I only had a Nespresso capsule, and it produced very low TDS. Aloe numbers were much higher. In theory, the higher the espresso TDS, the more accurate the readings should be. But either way, I can’t really call it an effective “universal” tool - the results varied too much between devices. So I wouldn’t recommend buying one just for this. That said, if you already have something similar on hand, it’s definitely worth experimenting with.

What did pleasantly surprise me was the comparison between DiFluid R2 and AIOK AK002K. In both the filter and espresso graphs, you can see the AIOK basically tracks the DiFluid R2, with a total error of 1.146. Overall, that’s a really solid result and totally usable for measurements.

There’s also the budget AIOK AK002K (PRO) with 0.01 resolution and lower internal error. I think that’s a good alternative to Yellow Boy or DiFluid R1.

You can also just buy the DiFluid R1 - honestly, that’s probably what I’d pick, because in my eyes it has the best price/performance ratio.

And if you want maximum stability and accuracy, the DiFluid R2 is a great “budget” refractometer compared to Atago and VST.

Like many of you in this sub, we’ve been looking for ways to de-Google and move our data to EU-based alternatives. However, we found that leaving Google Photos is intentionally designed to be a nightmare.

If you’ve ever tried ""Google Takeout"", you know the frustration: you get a mess of folders, broken metadata, and those annoying JSON files that strip away your photo timestamps and locations. Until now, fixing this meant using complex terminal-based tools like `immich-go`. Great for developers, but a massive barrier for everyone else.

With this browser-based migration tool for **PixelUnion** that handles the heavy lifting on private servers.

**The advantages:**

* **The Technical Barrier:** No more terminal or command-line ""hacking"". It’s all in the browser.
* **The Metadata Mess:** Our tool automatically re-links the JSON data, restores GPS tags, and fixes the timestamps that Google breaks during export.
* **EU Privacy:** As a European provider, we wanted a process where your data stays local. Once the migration is done, all temporary data and keys are wiped.

**How it works (for those interested in trying it):**

1. Get your export from Google Takeout (8GB zips work best).
2. Generate an API key in your PixelUnion settings.
3. Upload to the portal, and our servers rebuild your library and albums while you grab a coffee.

It is currently in **Open Beta**.

We believe your memories belong to you, not a Big Tech algorithm. If you're looking for a simple way to bring your data back to European soil, we'd love for you to test it out.

In [a recent episode of the Hospitable Hosts podcast](https://youtu.be/_elN3ILoiRM), Marisa Grover (who scaled to 50+ properties) shared that the biggest bottleneck for small hosts is ""The Mental Vault."" If all the property's quirks live only in your head, you can never truly step away.

The solution? The Property Bible. This isn't a guest manual. This is an internal document so detailed that a stranger could walk into your property and manage it without calling you once. Here is exactly how to build one:

**Step 1: The ""Everything"" Photo Audit**

Go to your property and take photos of things you usually ignore.

* **The Breaker Box:** Label every switch and take a clear photo.
* **The Remotes:** Take a photo of the ""correct"" remote setup for the TV.
* **The Utilities:** Where is the water shut-off? Where is the gas valve?
* **The ""Secret"" Switches:** If a light switch controls an outlet, put a small sticker on it and take a photo.

**Step 2: The ""If/Then"" Troubleshooting Guide**

Think of every guest complaint you’ve had in the last 6 months. Create a simple table in a Google Doc or Notion page:

* **IF** the Wi-Fi is slow... **THEN** go to the hallway closet, find the blue box, and unplug it for 30 seconds.
* **IF** the guest can’t find the extra towels... **THEN** they are in the ottoman under the window.
* **IF** the smart lock is clicking... **THEN** push the door firmly while entering the code.

**Step 3: The Tech & Appliance Cheat Sheet**

Don't assume people know how to use your specific gear. Record a 30-second video on your phone for:

* How to operate the specific brand of coffee maker.
* How to set the thermostat.
* How to use the washer/dryer (some guests struggle with European-style ventless units!).

**Step 4: Centralize the ""Source of Truth""**

Put all of this into one single link (Google Doc, Notion, or a project management tool).

* **Pro-Tip:** If you hire a Virtual Assistant or a new cleaner tomorrow, this link is the *first* thing you send them.

Once this is done, you’ve moved the knowledge from your brain to a system. This is the first step toward becoming a CEO Host instead of an on-call operator.

Hi Reddit,

I’m a 25F, and my boyfriend is 26M. We’ve been dating for four months. I’m looking for some perspective on something that happened this morning.

My boyfriend stayed over last night, and I woke up early. I was just talking to my dog, Hawk, asking if he wanted to go potty and if he was hungry. I took him outside, started my day, and put my AirPods in to wash some dishes. I didn’t wake my boyfriend because he was asleep.

When he woke up, he seemed irritated and distant — glued to his phone. I asked him multiple times what was wrong. We went for coffee quickly, but he stayed cold and quiet. Then he got upset, saying I didn’t give him enough attention in the morning — that I didn’t hug him before starting my day. He also said that I talk to my dog more than I talk to him and that I give my dog too much attention.

Later, when he tried to hug me, Hawk got in between us. My boyfriend grabbed Hawk’s mouth hard enough that he yelped. I felt really uncomfortable and a little scared. It seemed aggressive to me.

I’m now questioning if I’m overreacting. I feel like his reaction was out of proportion to the situation, and I’m wondering if breaking up is the right move. I also want to stay in his social friend group for mountain biking, so I’m trying to figure out how to navigate this safely.

1r6qeul,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1r6qeul/my_dad_said_there_was_a_portal_to_hell_in_our/,My Dad Said There Was A Portal To Hell In Our Attic. I Didn’t Believe Him.,"My family went through a good number of pets while I was growing up. Dogs, cats, fish, and even a couple birds. My parents tended to adopt from shelters and the pound, meaning they were often already pretty old, so we didn’t usually have any given pet for too long. 



Because of that, I quickly learned to accept death for what it was. When it was time for them to go, it was time for them to go. My dad would put them in a box, put that box in a car, and take them to get cremated.



I’d often wonder why my dad was the one doing it. Most of our pets seemed wary of him, scurrying away at his sight, whimpering and tucking their tails. I wondered if they would want him handling their bodies. 



He’d always come back reeking of smoke and copper. I figured the cremation process must not be easy. 



He’d always tell me not to worry, that they were in Heaven, watching over me from above. It was on those nights in particular that I would imagine them above my bed, watching me, talking to me. Sometimes it felt like they were reaching down and tapping on my ceiling. Like they were in the attic.



Of course, I wasn’t allowed in there. As a kid, not being allowed in the attic felt like a justifiable and logical rule. Dad’s space. Simple as that.



That’s why there was a padlock keeping the entrance shut. Even my mom didn’t get to go up there. She told me that he was just protective over his train models. I wondered if train models made the shuttering noises that I heard sometimes from above. 



Dragging, bumping, scratching. I would hear it on quiet nights. I told myself they were the sounds of the house settling. 



I got an answer when I was fifteen.



My dad sat me down one afternoon to talk to me, a stern look on his face.



“Chris, there’s a portal to Hell in our attic.” His wide eyes were trained on me.



“What?” I started to smile, unable to take his statement seriously.



“The demon who resides on the other side is named Alloces. He requests regular sacrifices.” 



“Dad, what are you talking about? Are you okay?” My smile turned sideways.



“I’ve been feeding him our pets. I don’t know how much longer it’ll work. He has the face of a lion and rides upon a dark horse,” he said, looking as if he could begin crying at any moment.



“You’re starting to scare me… knock it off. Seriously.” 



“I’m only telling you this because some day you’ll have to deal with it. You’re old enough to hear this. Don’t tell your mom. She doesn’t think you should know.” With that, he stood up and left the room abruptly.



He never told me more about it, even when prompted. I reluctantly followed his rules about the attic and about not telling mom anyways.



That was almost ten years ago. 



Just over a year ago, my mom called me. Dad was missing. Apparently he had been gone for a good while and she was just too scared to face the truth. By then, no one had seen a trace of him for nearly two months. 



I was furious at her for keeping it secret. Because of that, there was almost no way the police would be able to find him anymore. Regardless, I travelled home to help with whatever I could. 



The house was an unkempt wreck. The plants in the yard and around the house were all grey and decaying. The place looked as if it were antithetical to life itself. 



Only a few days into moving boxes and doing various house chores, I began to think back to that conversation with my dad. The lock on the attic door. The grinding sounds. I decided to check it out. I waited until my mom was asleep one night and approached the ceiling door.



It only took a few light strikes with a hammer to the lock to render years of secrecy obsolete. The ladder swung down with a metallic creak that resembled nails on a chalkboard. The light from my flashlight bounced off dust particles that drifted down. I planted one foot on the bottom rung and began my ascent. 



The thick scent of smoke began to fill my nostrils alongside a different, stranger tone. Something sickly sweet, like rotting fruit. I peeked my head above the floorboard and shined the flashlight above me, reflecting wood panels and pinkish insulation that suggested a very normal attic. I set the flashlight down and clambered the rest of the way up.



It appeared that the far wall of the room was much further away than I expected it to be. It was only when I picked the flashlight back up that a crimson light revealed itself to me upon the floor.



Covering the entire width of the attic was a giant square painted to the ground in dark red. Multiple intersecting lines that resembled crosses were on the inside of the square, alongside two U-shapes and several circles, one on the outside of each corner and two inside. The entirety of it was maybe 15 feet long diagonally and created with incredible precision.



My mind conjured images of sigils from movies and I thought about the lion-headed beast again. My toes began to tingle and something in the recesses of my brain told me to leave. Quickly scanning the rest of the room, I saw a completely empty attic otherwise only containing decaying cobwebs and the painting.



I descended the steps and shut the attic door quietly.



I questioned my mom the next morning.



“Do you think dad was ever… secretive about the attic? About what he did in there?” My question sat still in the air for a moment.



“Well, sure, I suppose. It was for his train models, you know that,” she said with a quaver that sounded as if she was trying to convince herself of the truth.



“Mom, I… I know there weren’t trains in there.” I set my coffee down on the table. “Why did he put a lock on it?”



“Honey, don’t be silly. It's God’s honest truth.”



I leaned in closer to her. “Dad once told me what was up there. He said you knew about it too.”



Her eyes darkened and avoided my gaze. “Your father… if I’m really being honest with you, was disturbed. He had mental troubles that we both tried to keep from you.”



“What kind of troubles?” My voice quieted.



“The kind that children have no right messing with.” She was beginning to get visibly upset. “The kind that drives people to do things that aren’t right.”



“What did he do? What about our pets?” The question lingered.



She muttered to herself. “He kept us safe. He kept *you* safe.”



“What?” My eyes widened.



“Honey, I–I can’t,” she said, tears welling in her eyes. She struggled to speak. “We aren’t talking about this anymore.” She stood up and quickly left the kitchen.



She avoided me from then on. I eventually decided after another week to leave and go back to my life. I complied with the police as far as I had to and tried to ignore the home. 



Only another month later, I received a call from the same police. My mother had gone missing. I was appalled. Losing both parents in such quick succession was such a shock that I could scarcely believe it. I could hardly even feel upset. I went back home again to work with the police and to keep up the house.



In my efforts for the investigation, I explained to them what I had seen in the attic the month prior. They asked me to help them check it out again. I nervously agreed.



I led two detectives into the space during an early afternoon. Upon entering, it was abundantly clear to me that something was different.



“This… this isn’t right. This was way bigger last time.” I paced the length of the room.



“Bigger? You mean this thing?” The senior detective pointed to the dusty sigil on the floor.



“No. The room itself. That wall must be at least ten feet closer than before.” I rested my hand upon the opposing wall. 



“Well, I suppose there could be a false wall. Are you sure?” The senior detective gave a scrutinizing look to his partner.



“Positive,” I said.



Within a few minutes, I found a hammer downstairs and we managed to bust a small divot into the wall. Light streamed through.



Impossible. The other side of the hole was the outside world. I could make out the front driveway through it. My stomach lurched and I decided to leave the room.



The detectives finished their work and left. They noted the structural anomaly but were more interested in the sigil. I was left completely confused. How was that possible? The length of the attic from entrance to the wall shouldn’t even be able to reach the front of the house. 



I waited without an answer. The investigation never turned up much and eventually settled into the backs of cabinets and grew dusty. I continued to stay at the house over the next year as the owner and only possible caretaker. 



I did what I could for the house but it never really felt comfortable again. The grass in the yard eventually completely gave up and the surrounding shrubs fell after. The overpowering smell of smoke wafted through the home and became constant. That whole time, I avoided that attic like the plague.



Of course, I had my theories about the attic. About the sigil and the demon my father named. I looked it up. Lo and behold, Alloces’s sigil was the very same one above my head. I wondered how real and necessary the “sacrifices” my father spoke of were. 



The answer finally thrust itself upon me on a cold, dark night.



I was laying in my bed, unable to sleep when I heard it. Grinding, bending, creaking, the same that I used to hear when I was a kid, the kind that I thought came from my pets. I shot up in bed, rubbing my eyes. There is no dad to make those sounds anymore. No trains. No pets. No excuses for my mind to imagine. I had to see what was up there.



Before pulling the cord to the attic, I considered the sacrifices. How they may settle the demon. It had been at least a full year since my mom had gone missing. A whole year since the last possible time a sacrifice may have been made. Even longer if I have hope for either of my parents’ lives. I couldn’t go in without a plan.



The next day I gathered what I needed. Against my own moral standards, I lured a stray cat with food and captured it in a backpack. Zipping it up, the cat thrashed violently as I slung it onto my back. I grabbed a flashlight with fresh batteries, a kitchen knife, and the same hammer I had broken a hole in the wall with.



The attic door lowered itself with a slow wheeze that sent a shiver down my spine. A huge cloud of dust–no, smoke–fell upon me from the darkness. My body was screaming at me not to go. I had to force my statue-like body to clamber up the ladder.



When my head entered the space, a cold, harsh wind slammed into me, making my eyes water. Looking around, I could see *nothing*. It was pitch black in every direction. Smoke enveloped the air around me.



I timidly raised the rest of my body into the space and took a step forward. Directing my flashlight around me, it only settled upon thick smog. No walls were close enough to catch in the light, no matter the direction. The sigil remained on the floor in front of me. 



“Hello?” I called out loudly. My voice left my lips and was sucked into the black void. No sound came back other than the wind. Not even an echo.



I began to walk.



Ten steps forward, there was still no sign of a wall. 



Another ten steps. Nothing. 



Forty more steps. Still nothing.



My teeth began to chatter in the cold and I wondered if I should go back. I turned around and could only barely make out the glow of the attic door on the floor in the distance. I foolishly determined that I should go until I found a wall. In theory, I should be able to bust a hole and leave through there. 



I stopped counting my steps after around five hundred. 



After what felt like 30 minutes, my flashlight finally illuminated something. Before me was a greyish pile of what looked like thin sticks and rocks covered in thin fabric. When I got closer, I realized what it actually was.



A desolate corpse of a large dog was splayed out as if it had died belly-up. The bones were darkened and the pale skin barely draped over the ribcage. The empty sockets of the skull expressed a feeling of dread that I struggled to comprehend. I reached back in my memory to all the childhood dogs I owned. This one was unrecognizable.



I found at least a dozen more dogs and cats of varying sizes and degrees of mummification over the next hour of walking. The further I went, the more prevalent they became.



At a certain point, the ground was littered with animal corpses. Ones that surely hadn’t come from my family. It became difficult to walk without stepping on them. That familiar, sickly sweet scent of death took over the smoke in my nose and danced across my tongue and down my throat. I felt the weight of the cat that had long since given up its attempts at escape on my back. 



*Arghhhhhh!*



I heard the pained cry from far away, in a direction that wasn’t completely obvious. As I jutted along with noodle-like limbs, the cries and shouts became enveloping and constant. The sounds of many. It was then louder than the wind.



The oppressive darkness suddenly felt less open and empty. I could feel the presence of someone, something, or many, just outside the cone of my flashlight. Waiting to snap me up in huge jaws and destroy me.



The crunch of bones snapping under immense weight began to hit my ears in a regular pattern from in front of me. I heard the sound of some huge beast breathing labored breaths. I trained my flashlight, quivering violently in my hand, in the direction of the sound. I stood still. I could scarcely breathe.



A ragged, ghastly figure appeared in my sight. It floated maybe eight feet above the ground. It was the figure of a woman. As it floated closer, I could make out the face. It was my mother. Barely recognizable. Blackened and decaying. Something sharp and shining protruded from her chest.



The second figure appeared several feet behind her. Another human corpse floated in line. It was the gaunt, bony, older visage of my father. When they were about ten feet from me, I finally realized what carried them.



Both bodies were impaled upon a huge metal spear whose carrier was yet still invisible to me. My stomach heaved bile from deep within and out of my mouth onto some poor corpse beneath my feet. I could barely stand, my legs shaking badly.



As my parents glided towards me, I heard the breathing grow stronger. I turned my flashlight to the left, and the head of a giant horse protruded out of the dark. Its black fur was mangy and the skin a sickly blue. It huffed dramatically, steaming air billowing out from huge nostrils.



The spear and its victims began to glide towards me with a quicker pace. I took a terrified step backwards and tripped on a bone, launching me backwards. I collapsed onto my back, the cat within the backpack screeching in shock. The flashlight fell from my hand, its light beaming wildly across the corpses littering the floor. I scrambled to my feet, my hands now coated in dead skin-cobwebs as I reached for the light. I started taking quick, determined steps away from the spear and the horse.



As I reached a running pace, the galloping of the horse became insistent and louder. It would reach me before I could escape. I had no other choice.



I had to do it.



While racing away, I swung the backpack over my shoulders, resting over my stomach. I pulled the knife from the side pocket and held it in my right hand, the flashlight trained forwards in my left.



With intensely vibrating hands, I wiped a tear from my eyes and plunged the knife into the bag. It tore past the fabric like paper, sinking into a soft mass like room temperature butter. The cat began to shriek violently and tear at the insides of the bag. I exhaled with a shocked groan and pulled the knife out, now dark with blood.



I stabbed the bag a dozen more times, the cat shrieking and shaking less and less each time. After a definitive final plunge of the knife, the thrashing stopped. I felt hot blood soak into my shirt and drip down onto my pants. 



Almost immediately, I heard the floor below me shudder like a tree being felled. Turning around, the horse was gone. I stopped running and stood still to witness the environment around me.



The smoke started to dissipate. My flashlight quickly found a wooden wall just a few feet from me. Rotating around me, I could find a rectangle of walls and a roof all around me within a normal attic-sized radius. The sigil was now below me, glowing a bright red. 



The bloodied knife slipped from my hand and clattered to the ground. The open attic door was now just a couple feet before me. I dropped the backpack onto the sigil, its glow intensifying. I rushed to the ladder and practically flew down it.



The cool, tile floor of the hallway never felt so inviting. I slammed the ceiling door shut and sunk to the ground, sobbing. 



That was yesterday. I’ve written all this down since then just to get a grip on everything that's happened here. I don’t know much about demons or Hell or anything of the occult. I’m not totally sure what I saw. But I won’t enter that attic again.

1r6qdto,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1r6qdto/massive_drop_in_resting_heart_rate_following/,Massive drop in resting heart rate following dietary changes,"I’ve recently been diagnosed with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease grade 2 at the old age of 31. I’ve always been able to maintain a healthy slim weight regardless of how reckless my diet has been and it’s always been difficult to for me to either gain or lose weight. I get fairly regular exercise through my work, but beyond that, I make no effort. And I don’t drink often. Maybe a couple of beers every few months, if even that. And I use no recreational drugs.

Prior to this revelation, my diet was exceptionally bad; with lots of fast food, junk food, constant fizzy drinks and coffees, pizzas. Practically living off of saturated fats and sugar. And I smoked a lot. I was found to have very high triglyceride levels and high cholesterol and I’m now taking a statin medication for that.

Anyway, on to the question. Following the diagnosis, I instantly, and quite radically adjusted my diet and lifestyle. I check the labels of everything, and avoid sugar and saturated fats like a plague. I’ve almost stopped smoking entirely. I drink water, and only touch coffee if it’s made with skimmed almost zero fat milk. It’s been a couple of weeks since the change. Previously my resting heart rate was pretty high(90-110). I never thought much of it. But now it’s more like 60 to 80. Which to me seems like quite a staggering drop in a short space of time. Can your diet really influence your resting heart rate by this amount? Could it be the cholesterol medication causing this?

Additionally, most medical advice you find online regarding fatty liver disease assumes that you’re overweight, and implies weight loss as a means of gauging an improvement in your health, I have no such way of monitoring any of my progress through that. Could this be a good sign?

Hi Reddit,

I’m a 25F, and my boyfriend is 26M. We’ve been dating for four months. I’m looking for some perspective on something that happened this morning.

My boyfriend stayed over last night, and I woke up early. I was just talking to my dog, Hawk, asking if he wanted to go potty and if he was hungry. I took him outside, started my day, and put my AirPods in to wash some dishes. I didn’t wake my boyfriend because he was asleep.

When he woke up, he seemed irritated and distant — glued to his phone. I asked him multiple times what was wrong. We went for coffee quickly, but he stayed cold and quiet. Then he got upset, saying I didn’t give him enough attention in the morning — that I didn’t hug him before starting my day. He also said that I talk to my dog more than I talk to him and that I give my dog too much attention.

Later, when he tried to hug me, Hawk got in between us. My boyfriend grabbed Hawk’s mouth hard enough that he yelped. I felt really uncomfortable and a little scared. It seemed aggressive to me.

I’m now questioning if I’m overreacting. I feel like his reaction was out of proportion to the situation, and I’m wondering if breaking up is the right move. I also want to stay in his social friend group for mountain biking, so I’m trying to figure out how to navigate this safely.

Long story short we were insanely understaffed and it was me, him and a coworker who was sick. Sick coworker was putting the order away and boss was sitting on his laptop drinking coffee when he was supposed to be on the floor helping. He always does stuff like this. That left me to run the entire store alone and somehow magically make all the prep we need for the day and stock it all up. All I did was say I didn't know how I was supposed to get it all done and he snapped at me and punished me with a written documentation saying he was sick of my negativity and complaining and how everyday I complain about something. He then said I won't be able to keep a job anywhere as I am. I ended up crying and was made to work my entire shift on edge. Ever since then I feel very on edge, very anxious and I need to get out of my job ASAP before I get fired. I cannot afford to be unemployed but the problem is the job market is so bad and nobody wants anything to do with me. I'm stuck and want to die.

  
Before we got this new boss I actually had a nightmare where I was working at McDonalds crying. This dream was just before he came so I feel it was prophetic and I saw my future and it scares me. I worked at McDonalds in my past and it gave me really bad anxiety and ptsd because my general manager bullied the heck out of me. I was supposed to have a job interview tomorrow and I was looking forward to it but they called me this afternoon and told me they have to cancel and reschedule for next week. I feel crushed because that was the only sliver of hope I had. I just want to die, I ask God often for the courage to just end it all. I came home and cried and laid on the couch in silence for lord knows how long because I just can't do it anymore. ",3,1771285911.0,SuicideWatch,0,1.0,False

I got a second hand Eureka Mignon Zero as my entry point last year in April and I’m starting to look for something else as the workflow is not so great. I did some upgrades, got a 3d printed tilt base and the aro espresso dial. Unfortunately the chute gets messy and a lot of coffee gets stuck to the sides.

Cleaning is a nightmare for me, I need something less time consuming.

I saw that machine and the price is right for my wallet but there is a lot of negative comments regarding the coffee beans being stuck. Also it’s a new brand so I’m wondering if they can deliver.

Honestly, fair. It was way too vague for some people and I wanted to protect the founders. Let me give you more details.

Quick note before I get into it, I'm going to call the founder Marcus throughout this post. Not his real name, just swapping it out for his privacy. He's a real person, this is a real business, I don't want to put his name on the internet without asking him first.

Recap: About 6 months ago I took a fractional COO role with an organic soda company. No salary, no retainer, nothing. Pure sweat equity. Marcus had built something real over the years, good products, decent web presence, customers who actually wanted to buy, but the business was quietly suffocating and he was honestly close to just calling it (he's 60+ years old). I came in because I thought the revenue was there and it just needed someone to go find it. We're now tracking to do $3M in annual revenue so I think that read was right.

But I don't want to talk about the revenue number. What I actually want to talk about is what was broken and what I built to fix it because I think a lot of people running small operations are going to recognize this.

When I first came in I just kind of shadowed Marcus for a few days. Watched how he spent his time. And what I saw was genuinely painful to watch. The guy was working constantly, but because almost every hour of his day was being eaten by coordination that should have been happening automatically.

Here's what a single sale looked like before I touched anything.

Someone fills out the contact form on the website. Marcus gets the email. He calls the customer, has a conversation, figures out what they need, and writes it all down, and I mean literally writes it down on whatever paper was nearby. Then he hangs up and calls the vendor to request a quote. The vendor comes back, sometimes same day, sometimes two or three days later, and half the time they have follow up questions because the spec wasn't detailed enough. So Marcus calls the customer back, gets the clarification, calls the vendor again, waits again. Vendor finally sends the quote over. Marcus opens it, and now he has to reformat the whole thing because vendor quotes look like vendor quotes, they're not something you just forward to a customer. So he's reformatting, doing the margin math by hand to figure out what to actually charge, and then finally sending it out.

Seven days. When I took over for a customer - that's how long this took on average. And that's when things went smoothly.

Now here's the other part that was really killing the business. Customer gets the quote, says they need to think about it, goes quiet for a few weeks. Completely normal in B2B. But when they come back ready to move forward, Marcus is now digging through hundreds of emails trying to find the original thread. I literally sat next to him one afternoon and watched him spend 20 minutes looking for an email thread. And of course this wasn't a one off thing, this was Tuesday. It happened all the time. And because there was no pipeline tracking, no system to flag who needed a follow up, deals were just dying in the silence. Not because the customer didn't want to buy. Just because nobody nudged them.

He had tried HubSpot at some point before I came in. Hated it. And I get it, HubSpot is not for everyone. It's built for sales teams with dedicated ops people and onboarding budgets, etc. For a founder running everything himself these SaaS tools are overwhelming, and the bigger issue is that to actually use it properly you have to restructure how you work. Marcus wasn't going to do that. The software should fit around him.

So I just built him something. I'm not going to pretend it took weeks of careful planning. I basically stayed up and built it in a night, did some cleanup the next day, and deployed it. It's not perfect but it works and it works exactly the way Marcus works which is the whole point.

When a customer fills out the contact form now, the system automatically reads the incoming email, parses out the customer's name, contact info, and what they're asking about, and creates a card on a kanban board inside the CRM. No AI involved in this part, just clean straightforward reliable parsing logic that pulls the structured data out of a consistent email format. Marcus wakes up in the morning, opens the platform instead of his inbox, and immediately sees every new inquiry sitting there waiting for him. He can see what they want, when they came in, and exactly where every other customer is in the pipeline at a glance. No digging, no searching, no memory required.

The quote builder is honestly the thing I'm most proud of. Marcus gets on a call with a customer, and while they're literally still talking, he's in the quote builder typing product names or model numbers. System pulls each product from the vendor price list we uploaded, his margin is already calculated and baked in, and by the time the conversation is winding down he hits save, downloads the PDF, and there's a clean professional formatted quote sitting on his desktop ready to send. The customer gets their quote before the call even ends. We went from a 7 day process to something that happens in under 10 minutes while you're still on the phone with the person.

The other big thing I built, and this one took a bit more work and was just for his workflow, was the pricing intelligence piece. Every year Marcus would get updated wholesale price lists from his vendors. Thousands of products, list prices, his cost prices, the whole thing. And then we'd have to go through Google, manually search for competitors selling those same products, try to build some kind of picture of where the market was sitting so we knew where to price ourselves. It was days if not weeks of work every time a new list came in and we were never fully confident we were looking in the right places or finding the right competitors because prices change throughout the year.

Here i used some AI tricks and built a basic agent directly into the platform. You upload the vendor price list, it reads every product name and model number, pulls your cost price, and then goes out and scrapes the internet for every competitor it can find selling those same products. It comes back with a simple report, lowest price in the market, highest price, where you're currently sitting, and an actual recommendation for where you should be pricing each product based on your COGS. What we would do once a year because it takes a few weeks, now just runs while you make a coffee and gives you a clean report to actually make decisions from, every 30 days.

So where things stand now. Marcus opens one platform in the morning. He sees new inquiries. He gets on calls and sends quotes before they're even over. He can see every customer and where they are in the pipeline. And every 30 days he gets a full competitive analysis instead of spending weeks on Google.

Quote turnaround went from 7 days to under 10 minutes. Vendor back and forth dropped by somewhere around 80-90%. Deals stopped falling through the cracks because everything is tracked now. And we're tracking to $3M.

I am happy to post a walkthrough video as a follow-up if anyone is even curious.

But more importantly anyone has questions about the operational side, how I structured any of this, or the build itself just drop them in the comments. Happy to get into the weeds on any of it.

I've checked everything available on rewards, the usual price at my local, and how many points they cost as a reward, then divided points by price. Sorted by the outcome, where a low score is best value for money, and a high score is not.

Some surprises - a Toffee Latte is the best value for money, costing £2.59 but only 1500 points. Meanwhile for 4000 points, you can get either a McChicken Sandwich (usually £4.39) or a double cheeseburger (usually £2.49), making the chicken burger much better value for money.

Non-smoker

VERY long story short, I'm in my 30s and have had IBS-D in some for for most of my life. Very frequent trips to the bathroom, sometimes up to 10 a day, and it is incredibly disruptive to my life. I often feel sick to my stomach. I've had two gastro doctors who have done scans, colonoscopies, pill cams, celiac tests, SIBO tests, etc, never finding anything other than a small ulcer in my terminal ileum that my current doctor does not believe to be crohn's.

I have tried everything over the years: probiotics, antibiotics, hypnotherapy apps, bile acid binders, low-fodmap diets, cutting out coffee, peppermint pills, fiber pills, lexapro, amitriptyline, bentyl...lots of stuff. Nothing has worked for me. I take imodium preventatively and it usually gives me peace of mind, but it doesn't always work and certainly doesn't work if I take it every day, which I tried once for an entire year.

There is a subreddit for IBS that I sometimes ask questions on and browse, but the reality is that if someone gets their IBS under control, I don't think they would really continue to hang out there. That's why I feel like it might be time to ask the broader reddit. Has anything actually worked for you?",1,1771285205.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1r6pvvv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/1r6pvvv/queer_children_of_ageing_parents_how_do_you_deal/,Queer children of ageing parents: how do you deal with all the history and relationship baggage?,"I'm in the bizarre situation of my parents *needing* me right now - between my brother and me, I'm the only one who has her shit together enough to manage their medical care - and also being the child with the most complicated relationship to them. I'm a lesbian, and whilst my parents were never outright homophobic in the 'fire and brimstone' sense, they absolutely did not like it. It was very much 'we tolerate it, but let's not talk about it too much'.

We continued to have a relationship after my coming out and even had some really positive moments together, but there was basically this culture of silence around my dating life. As I grew older and starting dating the woman I'm now fortunate enough to call my wife, that led to our relationship just....naturally growing more distant? I'd still call to chat about inconsequential stuff once a week or so, they even met my wife for a quick coffee or two (and somehow managed to just not talk about the fact that we were in a romantic relationship, which was truly a feat of conversational acrobatics), but they just completely lost touch with most of the important parts of my life: my marriage, my friends, all of it.

Now, both of my parents got really sick a few months ago, and I've become the de facto leader of the vanguard, so to speak. Their hospitalisation exposed a SHITLOAD of issues with their finances and general paperwork. I'm a lawyer, so I was first in line to sort all of that out. Then came all the rest of it: managing healthcare and rehab, hiring and organising caretakers, convincing them to give up the car, all of it.

Now that the big immediate things are done, I've sat my brother down and told him I can't be involved in the day-to-day aspects of their care because of my history with them. They STILL haven't met my wife properly, our relationship is fucking weird, and I just can't do it.

Both my parents and my brother seem FLABBERGASTED by this refusal of mine. My parents (whilst STILL refusing to actually say the word 'lesbian' out loud) are whining about how they've 'missed spending so much time with me' and how I'm 'so good at all this stuff'. My brother keeps going 'but you're a lawyer, you can do \*insert administrative task here\* in five minutes, I don't even get what these papers are about'. There's general bafflement at why I'd have a problem with all this considering there was never some big crashout fight about my being gay.

It's just so absurd. There's all these layers of history and baggage there, and I feel like every time people discuss taking care of their elderly parents, it's STRAIGHT people. Like, sure, Jen, maybe your mother doesn't like your husband, but at least she acknowledges you HAVE a husband. My mother would probably pretend she didn't recognise my wife if she met her in the street, despite me knowing for a fact she's googled her twice a week since she learnt her name (gotta check in on the lesbians even if you can't drink their coffee, apparently!)

Fellow queer adult children involved with their parent's care to some degree: what's it like for you? What boundaries have you drawn? How are your parents treating the issue now that they depend on you more?",15,1771285117.0,AgingParents,9,0.82,False

1r6ptzi,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1r6ptzi/my_30m_female_friend_24_made_a_confession_to_me/,My [30M] female friend [24] made a confession to me over the weekend,"For context the female (who we will call L) friend in question is my deceased partners younger sister. We had been together since we were 14 and in high school. We never married and had no kids but always dreamed and spoke of those future occasions. She suffered with mental health most of her life and ultimately decided in 2020 that she couldn’t live anymore. It of course shocked all of us. I knew she was struggling and I was doing my best to be the supportive partner for her but with the socialising restrictions due to Covid it took a bigger toll on her than I realised. Her family were there for me as I was for them. I had lost my father only two years before so it was a tough few years for me. L helped a lot making sure I went to my therapy sessions and looked out for me even though she had her own life going on and was only 18 turning 19. As covid ended in 2021 and I was able to socialise with my usual circle of friends, the two of us drifted slightly. She was living her life and I was living mine. We still kept in occasional contact as I did with her parents and elder sister. She looked to have started settling down in 2023 when she had her daughter. I was grateful that the family ensured I was part of the celebrations and the kept inviting me to family gatherings. I attended some but not all as I felt I shouldn’t be hanging around otherwise I wouldn’t move on from my partner. L would seem disappointed when she would ask why I wasn’t attending but understood. 

Unfortunately for her, the child’s father decided in January 2024 that he no longer wanted to be a family and took off. As we proceeded further into 2024 I began dating. At first I was unsure whether to say to the family as a sign of respect. I spoke to L to see what she would think. She has the type of personality where she has no filter in a good way. She suggested I go for it as I was still under 30 and had my whole life in front of me. So I did. Unfortunately for me on the few dates I went on I just felt numb inside. I would engage with the dates but my mind would drift off to my partner mid conversation. I felt awful that I was doing this to these women. Over the final period of 2024 and first period of 2025 me and L were hanging out more. We would meet for coffee during the week where she would bring her daughter along and occasionally just us two would go to the cinema and dinner on a Friday or Saturday night. As she was a single parent, last summer I offered to look after her daughter on a few individual days as she wanted to go to a few music festivals. She appreciated the offer and I kept my 

offer. 

During last summer there was a family fall out between her, the elder sister and their parents. My name was brought up as the eldest believed I didn’t do enough for my partner. L and her parents defended me where an accusation of a romantic relationship between me and L was made. I won’t go into more detail but the result is now the eldest sister speaks to no one. By the time Christmas comes the parents invited me and my own mum round for Christmas dinner. As we were spending time with our own family we politely rejected. But I did pop round to see L on Christmas Eve. We spent a few hours reminiscing about past Christmas’s and how my partner loved decorating the house. It was a great evening where even though some tears were shed laughs were had too. 

As the first few weeks of 2026 come along, L started calling and texting me more regularly throughout the day. She would ask about my day so on so forth. I didn’t really think much of it. We were still meeting up every week for a morning coffee and for two out of five of the weekends on January we went to the cinema. Then last Monday L phones me asking what I was doing Friday. My reply was not much. She suggested we do a friend’s valentines. I jokingly laughed but agreed after she explained herself better. Friday evening was going smoothly we enjoyed ourselves at a lovely Italian restaurant in central London where more on my behalf a awkward moment was shared when the waiter asked us how long we had been a couple, but she played it off smoothly. Afterwards I traveled on the tube and bus back to her flat. No romantic intention was meant but as she had a bit to drink and my hands were cold I had her link arms as we walked from the bus stop to hers. As we said bye to eachother she confessed that she had deep feelings for me that she’s had for nearly a year. I was shocked and didn’t respond great. I reminded her of who she was and who I was and the only reason we know eachother is because of her sister. She then drunkenly laughed and said she was messing around. At that moment to stop any words being exchanged I guided her into her block of flats and to her front door which is where I said my goodbyes. I text her Saturday morning to try and grasp wha the atmosphere was like. She replied back rather promptly with a short response. Once again I left it at that. But yesterday she phoned me asking why I hadn’t text back Saturday. I was slightly confused as I felt it didn’t require a response. It was then halfway through the chat that she repeated what she had said Friday night. This time it had a more serious tone to it. I knew she wasn’t messing around. Since 2:00pm yesterday afternoon it’s all I’ve thought about. She has text me a few times today but I just don’t know what to say to her. I don’t believe, even if I think deeply, that I am looking for a relationship especially one that could be construed as being complicated. But I do care for L and don’t want to see her hurt and especially don’t want to be the one hurting her. As I said at the beginning of my post I was not married to her sister. But she was my high school sweetheart and the one person I always believed I’d share a life with.

I know it’s coming up to six years but I’m not sure if I’ll ever get over losing her. But at what point do I accept it’s time to close that chapter and move on? Do I listen to what L says and search in myself if I have those same feelings. I love spending time with her and having the companionship but being romantically involved has never crossed my mind. Should I see what she has to say in more detail? Do I just shutdown what she says and disassociate myself from her and her parents? If anyone has advice what I should do that would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR 

My deceased partners sister confessed she had feelings for me over the weekend. She has had them for nearly a year. Her sister/my partner passed away nearly six years ago and we were unwed and had no children. Unsure where I should take what L said to me",2,1771284985.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

She's been doing this for years, really good at what she does, but she told me her retention has been falling off lately and she couldn't figure out why.

Her process was standard for her role. She'd come into a business, spent a few weeks analyzing their financials, build some models, give a full breakdown of what was broken and how to fix it. Finally, she'd hand them the recommendations and move on to the next client.

The advice was good. Clients were listening. But come the CTA - nothing would happen.

They'd take the deck, say thank you, and then just... not implement any of it. She thought maybe it was a pricing issue or that she wasn't being clear enough in her recommendations. I saw it differently.

# I think businesses just don't want advice anymore. They want someone who actually builds the thing.

So here is what i suggested:

Instead of just telling clients what tools they need or what processes to implement, partner with software vendors who can build custom solutions fast. Bring her expertise on workflows and financial operations, let the vendor handle the build, and deliver an actual working tool to the client instead of a recommendation to go find one themselves.

She tried it with her next client.

They had a financial reporting mess. Multiple spreadsheets, manual data entry and fetching from disparate disconnected data sources, nothing syncing properly. Instead of giving them a memo on best practices and how to prompt AI and wishing them luck, she brought in a software partner I connected her with. They mapped out the client's workflow together in a few calls, and the vendor built them a custom Excel tool that actually fit what the client was doing. Formulas, AI-assisted built macros, automated data pulls, the whole thing wired up specifically for their reporting needs. 10 days later the client had something they could actually use.

Not some big enterprise software they'd have to spend resources on. Just Excel, but built properly for their exact workflow. And way cheaper than the big box vendors they'd been looking at before.

Her retention and word-of-mouth marketing went up. Clients started referring her within their circles because she wasn't just the person who told them what was broken anymore. She was the person who showed up and fixed it. Refreshing

2- To anybody who has recently promoted, can you recall any of the questions that were asked? I know about following the STAR method, using buzzwords, etc…

I pulled up to the pickup spot and that's when I noticed the Walgreens bag was soaked with coffee. OMFG WHY!!!! 😂 I put my thinking cap on and searched for emergency grocery bags that I may or may not have stashed in between the seats of my car. Found one!!! Problem is the bag says 7-Eleven 😂 I had to make a business decision. I was determined to provide the best service to her as possible seriously.. all right cool it says ""leave at the lobby""... Usually there's a nice receptionist there to play security to the customer food n this situation.. NOPE... Only a sign that says ""be back in a few minutes"".. I had to make another business decision. I left it at the lobby unsecured smh... But wait there's more!!!  I get back to my car and to my surprise one of her drinks is still in my car 💀. I hit another you turn and drop that drink right off because not today devil... Now I will be in the parking lot for about 20 minutes contemplating life and my life decisions... That's all thanks for the read stay blessed.

1r6pm0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/FractionalOperator/comments/1r6pm0p/fractional_coos_need_to_stop_just_consulting/,Fractional COOs Need to Stop Just Consulting,"I had coffee last week with a fractional CFO I've known for a while. She's been doing this for years, really good at what she does, but she told me her retention has been falling off lately and she couldn't figure out why.

Her process was standard for her role. She'd come into a business, spent a few weeks analyzing their financials, build some models, give a full breakdown of what was broken and how to fix it. Finally, she'd hand them the recommendations and move on to the next client.

The advice was good. Clients were listening. But come the CTA - nothing would happen.

They'd take the deck, say thank you, and then just... not implement any of it. She thought maybe it was a pricing issue or that she wasn't being clear enough in her recommendations. I saw it differently.

# I think businesses just don't want advice anymore. They want someone who actually builds the thing.

So here is what i suggested:   
  
Instead of just telling clients what tools they need or what processes to implement, partner with software vendors who can build custom solutions fast. Bring her expertise on workflows and financial operations, let the vendor handle the build, and deliver an actual working tool to the client instead of a recommendation to go find one themselves.

She tried it with her next client.

They had a financial reporting mess. Multiple spreadsheets, manual data entry and fetching from disparate disconnected data sources, nothing syncing properly. Instead of giving them a memo on best practices and how to prompt AI and wishing them luck, she brought in a software partner I connected her with. They mapped out the client's workflow together in a few calls, and the vendor built them a custom Excel tool that actually fit what the client was doing. Formulas, AI-assisted built macros, automated data pulls, the whole thing wired up specifically for their reporting needs. 10 days later the client had something they could actually use.

Not some bloated enterprise software they'd have to spend months learning. Just Excel, but built properly for their exact workflow. And way cheaper than the big box vendors they'd been looking at before.

Her retention and word-of-mouth marketing went up. Clients started referring her within their circles because she wasn't just the person who told them what was broken anymore. She was the person who showed up and fixed it. Refreshing

\--------

Open source AI continues making waves in the AI world due to its transparency, flexibility, and community collaboration. However, going from ""I want to run open source AI"" to ""I've created an open source AI platform that can handle production use-cases"" is a massive leap. That's why I've created a quickstart repository to help you get started with deploying your own open source AI platform using Open WebUI and vLLM. In this post, I'll describe how to use the quickstart repo in Github to build your own open source AI platform on AWS with just a few commands.

# Why Self-Host?

Before we dive in, it's worth asking: why self-host AI models at all? Hosted APIs from OpenAI, Anthropic, and others are extremely convenient, allowing you to focus less on infrastructure and more on using their flagship models for the tasks you need to focus on.

However, this convenience comes with major trade-offs. By sending all your AI prompts to these companies, you are trusting them with your data, your business knowledge, information about issues in your technical environments, or even intimate details of your own life. You also deal with rate limits, token limits, a lack of customization options, and having your AI go down when their platforms go offline with unexpected issues.

By self-hosting AI, you are increasing your data privacy, security, AI availability, and giving yourself the ability to host any open source models you want. The main barrier to self-hosted AI has always been operational complexity, which I hope to help you solve through this quickstart.

# What We're Building

The repository deploys a complete AI inference platform on Amazon EKS. Here's what the architecture looks like:

* [**Open WebUI**](https://openwebui.com/) — A polished web interface for chatting with your models. Think ChatGPT, but running on your infrastructure. It supports conversations, document uploads for RAG (retrieval-augmented generation), API connections, and connections to multiple model backends.
* [**vLLM Production Stack**](https://github.com/vllm-project/production-stack) — A high-performance inference engine with an OpenAI-compatible API. vLLM uses PagedAttention and continuous batching to squeeze maximum throughput out of your GPUs. The Production Stack adds a router layer on top that handles load balancing across replicas and health checking.
* [**Ollama**](https://ollama.com/) — A lightweight model server included as an option for simpler use-cases that value model availability over speed. In the default configuration it's scaled to zero replicas so vLLM handles all inference, but it's there if you want it.
* **Gateway API + AWS ALB** — HTTPS ingress using the Kubernetes Gateway API and an Application Load Balancer, with an ACM certificate and Route53 DNS record created automatically (assuming you have a Public Hosted Zone in Route53 available).
* **EKS with GPU nodes** — A managed Kubernetes cluster with two node groups: a general-purpose `m5a.large` for running Open WebUI and cluster services, and a `g5.xlarge` with an NVIDIA A10G GPU for model inference.

Everything is defined in OpenTofu (an open-source Terraform fork) and deploys with just a few commands.

# Prerequisites

You'll need a few tools installed locally:

* [**OpenTofu**](https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/install/) — The infrastructure-as-code tool that provisions everything.
* [**kubectl**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) — For interacting with the Kubernetes cluster after deployment.
* [**AWS CLI**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) — For AWS authentication and generating your kubeconfig.
* [**Helm**](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) — Used by OpenTofu's Helm provider to deploy charts.

You also need:

1. **An AWS account with a Route53 Public Hosted Zone.** The deployment creates an ACM certificate for HTTPS, which requires DNS validation through Route53. If you don't already own a domain, you can register one through Route53 for a few dollars. If you don't have a domain in Route53 available, you can still hit Open WebUI using Kubectl port forwarding instead, but it will not be publicly available.
2. **A HuggingFace account and API token.** The default model (Llama 3.2 3B Instruct) is a gated model, meaning you need to accept the license agreement on HuggingFace before you can download it. [Create a token here](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens), then visit the [model page](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct) and accept the license.

# A Note on Costs

The `g5.xlarge` GPU instances used here cost approximately **$1/hour** in `us-west-2`. Combined with the general-purpose node, NAT gateway, and load balancer, this setup can easily run **$50/day** if left up. Treat this as a development and experimentation environment — destroy your resources when you're not using them.

# Deploying the Stack

# Step 1: Clone and Configure

    git clone https://github.com/westbrook-ai/self-hosted-genai && cd self-hosted-genai

Open [`locals.tf`](http://locals.tf) to review the configuration. The key values you will likely want to change:

|Setting|Description|Default|
|:-|:-|:-|
|`region`|AWS region to deploy into|`us-west-2`|
|`domain_name`|Your Route53 hosted zone|[`opensourceai.dev`](http://opensourceai.dev) (owned by me)|
|`gateway_hostname`|Subdomain for the web UI|`owui-gateway`|
|`vllm_model_url`|HuggingFace model to serve|`meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct`|
|`vllm_tag`|vLLM Docker image tag|`v0.15.1-cu130`|

At minimum, you'll need to update `domain_name` to match your Route53 hosted zone.

The defaults are tuned for a `g5.xlarge` instance with a 24GB NVIDIA A10G GPU. The Llama 3.2 3B Instruct model fits comfortably within those constraints with a 32K context window.

# Step 2: Set Your HuggingFace Token

Export your HuggingFace API token as an environment variable. OpenTofu picks this up via the `TF_VAR_` prefix:

    export TF_VAR_huggingface_token=""hf_your_token_here""

# Step 3: Deploy

    tofu init
    tofu apply

That's it — two commands. OpenTofu will show you a plan of everything it's about to create and ask for confirmation. Type `yes` and grab a coffee. The full deployment takes **25–30 minutes**, most of which is EKS cluster creation and model downloading on the resulting Kubernetes pods.

Here's roughly what happens during that time:

1. A VPC is created with public and private subnets across three availability zones.
2. An EKS cluster is provisioned with two managed node groups (general-purpose and GPU).
3. The NVIDIA device plugin is installed so Kubernetes can schedule GPU workloads.
4. Gateway API CRDs, the AWS Load Balancer Controller, and External DNS are deployed to enable access to resources in the cluster from the internet.
5. Open WebUI is installed via Helm into the `genai` namespace.
6. Your HuggingFace token is stored as a Kubernetes secret.
7. The vLLM Production Stack is deployed — it downloads the model from HuggingFace and starts the inference engine.
8. An ACM certificate is provisioned and validated, an ALB is created, and a DNS record points your hostname to it.

# Step 4: Verify and Access

Once the apply completes, configure kubectl to talk to your new cluster:

    aws eks update-kubeconfig --name open-webui-dev --region us-west-2

Check that everything is running:

    kubectl get pods -n genai

You should see pods for Open WebUI, the vLLM router, and the vLLM serving engine. The serving engine pod may take a few extra minutes to reach `Running` status while it downloads and loads the model.

Navigate to your configured hostname (e.g., `https://owui-gateway.opensourceai.dev`). Open WebUI will prompt you to create an admin account on first visit — this is stored locally in the cluster, not sent anywhere external.

# How the Pieces Fit Together

It's useful to understand how traffic flows through the stack:

1. A user opens the web UI in their browser, which hits the ALB over HTTPS.
2. The ALB terminates TLS using the ACM certificate and forwards traffic to the Open WebUI pod on port 8080.
3. When a user sends a message, Open WebUI forwards the request to the vLLM router service using the internal cluster DNS name (`vllm-tool-router-service.genai.svc.cluster.local`).
4. The vLLM router load-balances across available serving engine replicas and returns the response.

Open WebUI is configured to talk to vLLM through an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint, which means it works the same way it would with the OpenAI API — no special integration or API key needed.

# Tool Calling

One of the more powerful features in this stack is **tool calling** (also known as function calling). This lets the model decide when to call external functions during a conversation — for example, looking up the weather, querying a database, or calling an API.

The vLLM deployment is configured with tool calling enabled out of the box. It uses the `llama3_json` parser and a custom Jinja chat template that instructs the model to output structured JSON when it wants to invoke a tool.

# Testing Tool Calling with Open WebUI

The easiest way to verify tool calling is working end-to-end is to import a community tool directly into Open WebUI. The [Tools Context Inspector](https://openwebui.com/posts/tools_context_inspector_519c365f) is a great one to start with — it's a diagnostic tool that inspects and dumps all the context variables Open WebUI injects into a tool's runtime environment, such as `__user__`, `__metadata__`, `__messages__`, and `__request__`. This lets you see exactly what information is available to tools in Open WebUI when the model invokes them.

Here's how to import it:

1. Visit the [Tools Context Inspector](https://openwebui.com/posts/tools_context_inspector_519c365f) page on the Open WebUI community site.
2. Click **Get**.
3. Enter your Open WebUI URL (e.g., `https://owui-gateway.opensourceai.dev`) and click **Import**..
4. A new tab will open in your Open WebUI instance — click **Save** to add the tool.

Now try it out:

1. Click **New Chat** in Open WebUI.
2. In the message input area, click the `Integrations` button (just below the ""How can I help you today?"" chat box) and enable the **Tools Context Inspector** tool.
3. Send a message like: *""Inspect the user context and explain what you see.""*

The model will invoke the `inspect_user` function via tool calling and return a structured dump of the `__user__` object — including your user ID, name, email, and role. This confirms that vLLM is correctly parsing tool definitions, generating structured tool call output, and that Open WebUI is executing the tool and returning the result back to the model.

Beyond diagnostics, Open WebUI's [community tool library](https://openwebui.com/tools) has hundreds of tools you can import the same way — from web search to code execution to API integrations. And because vLLM exposes an OpenAI-compatible API, any external application or framework that supports function calling (LangChain, CrewAI, etc.) can also connect to your self-hosted endpoint with no code changes beyond swapping the base URL.

# Customizing the Deployment

# Changing the Model

The default Llama 3.2 3B model is a good starting point, but you'll likely want to experiment with other models. Update `locals.tf`:

    vllm_model_url      = ""meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct""
    vllm_request_cpu    = 6
    vllm_request_memory = ""24Gi""
    vllm_request_gpu    = 1
    vllm_max_model_len  = 32768

Larger models need larger instances. The `g5.xlarge` (24GB VRAM) handles 3B models easily. For 8B models, you'll want a `g5.2xlarge`. For 70B models, you'll need multi-GPU instances like the `g5.12xlarge` with 4 GPUs. Update the `gpu-small` node group in [`eks.tf`](http://eks.tf) to match.

After making changes, run `tofu apply` to update the deployment.

# Scaling Replicas

To handle more concurrent users, increase `vllm_replica_count` in [`locals.tf`](http://locals.tf) and ensure enough GPU nodes are available by adjusting `max_size` and `desired_size` on the `gpu-small` node group. The vLLM router automatically load-balances across all healthy replicas.

# CUDA Compatibility

One gotcha worth mentioning: the vLLM Docker image ships with a CUDA compatibility library that can conflict with the GPU driver on EKS nodes. The deployment handles this by setting `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to prioritize the host driver path (`/usr/lib64`) over the container's bundled library. If you see ""unsupported display driver / cuda driver combination"" errors, this is the first thing to check. The `vllm_tag` must also match the CUDA version of your node's GPU driver.

# Troubleshooting

If things aren't working, here are the most common issues and how to debug them:

**Pods stuck in Pending:** Usually means the GPU node isn't ready or the NVIDIA device plugin hasn't registered the GPU yet. Check with `kubectl describe pod -n genai -l app=vllm`.

**Model download failures:** Verify your HuggingFace token is set correctly and that you've accepted the model license. Check the pod logs with `kubectl logs -n genai -l model=llama3-3b`.

**Router not ready:** The vLLM router waits for the serving engine to be healthy before it passes health checks. The startup probe allows up to 5 minutes for initial model loading. Check router logs with `kubectl logs -n genai -l app.kubernetes.io/component=router`.

**OOM errors:** If the serving engine is getting killed, increase `vllm_request_memory` or reduce `vllm_max_model_len` to lower memory usage.

You can also test connectivity from inside the cluster:

    kubectl run -it --rm debug --image=curlimages/curl --restart=Never -n genai -- \
      curl http://vllm-tool-router-service/v1/models

# Cleaning Up

Since this stack costs real money, destroy everything when you're done:

    tofu destroy

Occasionally, VPC resources don't delete cleanly on the first attempt due to lingering ENIs or security group dependencies. If that happens, run `tofu destroy` a second time, which should delete the final resources. In my experience, the remaining resources don't incur costs, so this should be low-stress.

# What's Next

This quickstart gives you a working AI platform in under 30 minutes. From here, you could:

* **Experiment with different models** — Try Mistral, CodeLlama, or quantized variants for different use-cases.
* **Build tool-calling pipelines** — Connect vLLM's function calling to real APIs and databases using frameworks like LangChain.
* **Add persistent storage** — Enable the Open WebUI PVC for durable conversation history and RAG document storage.
* **Restrict access** — Update the security group in [`vpc.tf`](http://vpc.tf) to limit access to specific IP ranges or a VPN.
* **Move state to S3** — The default local state is fine for experimentation, but for team use you'll want a remote backend.

The full source code is available at [github.com/westbrook-ai/self-hosted-genai](https://github.com/westbrook-ai/self-hosted-genai). Issues and PRs are welcome.

I hope this article and quickstart repo were helpful. Let me know what other open source AI tooling you'd like to see added to the cluster in the future in the comments. Thank you for reading, and welcome to the exciting world of hosting your own open source AI infrastructure!

1r6pkb8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/1r6pkb8/has_buffalo_bills_got_our_souls/,Has buffalo bills got our souls?,"I am creating this post to see if anyone can provide us with more information about Buffalo Bills Hotel and Casino and the surrounding area. 

We had been in Las Vegas with work for three weeks and had to move location to California. Being from the UK we decided to try and see as many cool sites as possible. One of the stops being a good place to grab a coffee. We all decided we could use one and decided to make the stop. We pulled in to the massive car park of the hotel and casino known as Whiskey Pete’s, as we noticed it was taped up with road blocks; it dawned on us pretty quickly that the place was abandoned and probably had been for a while. So we decided to head across the road to Buffalo Bills Hotel and Casino.

As we pulled round into the car park, we noticed a man stood alone and very still, while doing the occasional calf raise. We thought this was weird but then again it could be a morning routine of his or he may have physio appointments and had to get his exercises in. However, the car park was heaving so we thought it must be open here.

Getting out the car the whole place had an eerie feel to it. Very quiet. No one around. Almost like it was abandoned. We started to head over the entrance, questioning if we should go in or not but decided that we should just check it out. As we walked through the entrance the place felt cold and one of us mentioned it smelt off and a bit like old people. We all let out a giggle as we looked around the massive casino floor that was sparsely populated with slot machines and maybe around 10 people covering the whole area. Looking around we noticed that nearly everything except the casino floor was cut off and closed. All the restaurants and all the cafes were blocked off with all the lights off, including a restaurant called “Chophouse.”

The first place we decided to check was the gift shop. Upon entering the woman working in there did not acknowledge us, we continued to look around it and yet she still hadn’t said or even looked at us, almost like we didn’t exist. The stock was running low, like they haven’t restocked since they ‘closed’ a year ago.

We then headed to the toilets, where a man attended to the cleaning of them by just simply spraying solution all around without actually wiping or rubbing anything down. Who then had disappeared as I exited the cubicle.

As we walked around some more we came across a man sat at the bar with a coffee cup, naturally we went over and asked him where we could get one, he then turned around and said “you need to leave, go across the road, there’s nothing for you here”. We thanked him for his help and went on our way, but when we looked back on this experience it seemed more like he was trying to warn us than help us get a coffee.

Before leaving we all regrouped and just looked around at the different slot machines, one of us noticed a man following one of the girls and leering over her as she attempted to use the slot machine. It failed to take her money so we took it as a sign and decided to leave, when we started to walk out one of us noticed that another man was staring at us. As I turned around he was staring into our souls and did not break gaze, which also scared us because if someone points out someone staring they usually break gaze due to embarrassment. We also got freaked out by the fact that google stated that the place was permanently closed and had been for just under a year!!

The whole place just had a weird vibe to it, almost cultish, like if we stayed there any longer we would have been a sacrifice or adopted into this weird gambling group that never leave and feast on travellers looking for coffee. We took some videos of the inside because it fascinated us how quiet it was in there. However, after reflecting on the videos we could hear more people, like it sounded busier and before we let out a giggle you can hear what sounds like a little girl or girls saying “help, help, help me”. This has sent us into a spiral about what we actually experienced that day. Why when looking back on the videos was there sounds of a bustling crowd when the place we experienced was desolate and silent? and who did all the cars belong to in the car park?

It would be great if anyone could share a story that they have from their visit or just provide a bit of information on the lore of the area that could suggest that what we witnessed is something darker than just a run down casino.",3,1771284314.0,Ghoststories,4,0.81,False

1r6pix0,https://www.reddit.com/r/verifiedautotransport/comments/1r6pix0/why_dealer_loads_move_fastercheaper_how_consumers/,Why dealer loads move faster/cheaper. How consumers can use this knowledge.,"Ever wondered why car dealers seem to get their vehicles shipped so quickly and at a lower cost compared to regular folks? It's kind of like being in on a secret club with some sweet perks. Let's dig into why dealer loads tend to move faster and cheaper, and how you, as a consumer, might be able to take advantage of some of this insider knowledge.

First off, it's all about volume and relationships. Dealers are shipping cars all the time, so they often have established relationships with transport companies. This means they've got a direct line to reliable carriers and can negotiate better rates due to their frequent business. Think of it like getting a loyalty discount at your favorite coffee shop—except it's for shipping vehicles.

Another reason is efficiency. Dealer-to-dealer shipments are usually part of a larger network of car trades and sales. These shipments often fill up entire truckloads, known as ""full loads,"" which are more appealing for carriers since they don't have to make multiple stops for pickups or deliveries. This minimizes downtime and maximizes profits for the carriers, so they prioritize these routes to keep things moving quickly.

For us regular consumers, we're usually shipping just one vehicle at a time. This is known as a ""single load"" or ""individual load."" It’s a bit like being the odd one out at a party where everyone else came in groups. Single loads are less efficient and less predictable for carriers, so they tend to be more expensive and slower to move.

Now, here's a little tip—if you find yourself needing to ship a car, you might consider teaming up with others to fill a load. Some forums and social media groups are dedicated to vehicle shipping, and you might find someone who's looking to ship in the same direction. This could help you snag a better rate and possibly expedite your shipping process.

While every organization is unique, this content reflects standard industry expectations. Please keep in mind that experiences can vary; while some companies may fall short of these benchmarks, others strive to exceed them significantly.

1r6ph2u,https://i.redd.it/kaq7xt71xxjg1.jpeg,When is someone gonna believe me that the Mocha Frappe flavor completely changed some months ago,"I used to buy the Mocha Frappe religiously. Literally an addiction. It was bad ngl but I stopped when the flavor of the drink changed literally one day to the next. It was last year around the middle of the year. I made a post on here about it but it got removed (there’s an anti og mocha frappe agenda going on rn) 

They changed the flavor from coffee-ish flavor to sewer garbage banana flavor. Idk the business decision behind this but on the week of the change, I had gone to several McDonalds to see if they had all changed. They did. 

It wasn’t a dirty machine or a bad batch or anything of the like. I got one a few days ago and they still taste horrible now just how they did month ago suddenly. I can’t be the only one on this. If I didn’t have an addiction of them, I wouldn’t be so sure of this but I did so I am. 

I stopped going to McDonalds entirely because of this. I’d get other stuff rarely but I would literally go everyday or more than once a day to get a Mocha Frappe. I’m unfortunately an expert of a non existent drink, a distant memory, an unreachable past. Make the best of each moment because you never know when you’ll have an og mocha frappe for the last time.

1r6pfop,https://i.redd.it/2u6ty4xqwxjg1.jpeg,Qwen-Image-2.0: How to write prompts for posters and infographics,"**Qwen-Image-2.0** is designed specifically for structured page layouts, so prompts need to describe the layout structure, not just vibes.  
**Here's how to actually use it:**  
  
**1. Describe the layout structure**  
❌ ""a nice coffee poster""  
✅ ""Poster: title at the top, 3 benefit blocks below, a cup image on the right, 'Order now' button at the bottom""  
The model focuses on page structure, so you need to be explicit about where things go.  
  
**2. Specify the text directly**  
❌ ""poster with text""  
✅ ""Title: 'Morning Coffee' / Subtitle: 'Fresh beans everyday' / 3 points: Aroma / Roasting / Delivery""  
Text can be written directly in the prompt — it becomes part of the image.  
  
**3. Write like a technical brief**  
Prompt structure: format → blocks → content → style  
You can describe the entire page in one request:  
  
Titles and captions  
Text sections  
Comic dialogues  
Element placement  
  
**Example:** ""A slide with a title, subtitle, and several text blocks in a minimalist style.""  
  
**4. Edit without regenerating**  
Upload an image or reference and describe the change:  
  
""Replace the title""  
""Add a bullet point""  
""Rearrange blocks""  
  
The model edits the image without switching to a separate regeneration mode.  
  
**Why this matters:**  
Text rendering has long been a weak point for generative models — if the typography breaks, the image becomes unusable.  
Qwen-Image-2.0 addresses this at the base model level and combines generation and editing in a single workflow. So you can actually create posters, infographics, slides, and UI mockups with readable text and structured layouts without needing 10+ regeneration attempts.",1,1771284006.0,rpgc_official,0,1.0,False
