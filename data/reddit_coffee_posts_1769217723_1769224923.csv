( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cat. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievement/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, music, and chess courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

\- tidying up: My kids don’t help and it always turns into a massive battle and my worst parenting moments. I’ve been dragged over the coals for suggesting I just throw stuff away but it’s too much for me to handle and really affects my mental health. I’ve always struggled to keep house and it’s 100x harder when you add in all the random treasures that a 3-5 year old accumulates in the middle of the living room. I don’t know how to organise it all or where to start and I’m either on the verge of a panic attack or I completely shut down. I have read How to Keep House While Drowning for anyone wanting to suggest it.

\- I HATE being at home. I’m just surrounded by constant demands and reminders of things I have to do. It never ends.

\- Never having any time to myself. I try to set limits but any time I try to take a minute to myself I get interrupted. This morning I tried to read my book while I had my coffee - I told everyone that this is what I was doing and that I’d play with them afterwards. I read zero pages because one child had to pretend to be a cat and constantly drop random plastic objects on the pages (fuck, more stuff for me to find a place for) while pawing at my face, and the other child had a meltdown with several layers of escalation because I put her babycino in the wrong cup.

\- Limited opportunities for self care or dopamine. If I listen to my preferred music my kids complain to the point that it just adds to the stress and/or I have to be careful about expletives. I can probably guarantee myself 10-30 seconds to myself at a time and I’ve resorted to doom scrolling because what else can you do for 10-30 seconds when you just need some metaphorical air? At the end of the day I just want to crash lately despite having a million things I want to do instead.

My husband does a lot of the cleaning and can get things done quicker than I do but the kids follow me wherever I go, and he struggles just as much as I do. We’re several hours away from any family and we both work.

A few years ago, I opened a small independent coffee shop in Washington, DC. No investors. No prior coffee or coffee shop background. Just a love for coffee and a belief that I could build a community space.

1qlbnvd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeEssays/comments/1qlbnvd/transfer_essay_for_ut/,Transfer Essay for UT,"My interest in economics didn’t come from a classroom. It came from a poker table. When I played in games that forced people to make big decisions under pressure, I began to notice and exploit patterns when people's behavior changed due to incentives and risk constantly changing. Some people became overly cautious, some very impulsive, and very few acted rationally when uncertainty was in the picture. Poker left me with much more than just chips, I gained a unique insight of human behavior under pressure and uncertainty.

At Texas Tech, those observations finally had meaning. Studying incentives and tradeoffs helped make me understand how deeply economics is tied to people and not just markets and money. I became most engaged in class when we discussed companies and the factors that influence their financial decisions. I found myself naturally understanding their thought processes because of my experience with poker, where I managed risk and fought for value. For the first time, academic material felt intuitive rather than forced.

As my connection with economics grew, I realized it was a place I could really excel, I have a passion for finance and a strong ability to connect with people. Naturally, those skills pointed to economics. However one challenge I encountered was recognizing how limited my roots in economics were. When I reached out to industry professionals to learn more about careers in economics and finance, I was told that they don't typically do coffee chats with students at Texas Tech. Although that was a hard pill to swallow, it made me aware that I would need to take a greater personal responsibility for my own academic future

That new perspective pushed me to pursue independent study. I enrolled in Yale’s Financial Markets course, taught by award winning Robert Shiller. From him, I learned how incentives play into risk management and other behavioral finance principles. I was challenged to think beyond simplified assumptions. That short course reinforced my interest in understanding how people behave differently under risks and uncertainty and confirmed my decision to further pursue economics. 

This motivational spark started to influence how I worked with others and by myself. I put my pride aside and asked for help from teachers, and stopped waiting until 11:59 to get my work done. I made schedules and plans to be more efficient in and out of the classroom. In a recent project, I took the lead to coordinate group members in a way that we could capitalize on everyone's strengths and minimize our overall weaknessess. I realized that these seemingly small shifts have a large impact on how I learn and work with others. 

Texas Tech has been important in helping me develop as a person and a student. I've had the pleasure of meeting supportive peers and professors who helped guide me through challenging coursework and building discipline. I've learned many new things, however as my academic interests became more focused, I felt ready for an environment that would push me further rather than allow me to settle.  

At the University of Texas, I look forward to taking unique classes, such as Business Strategy ECO 352K, and learning to develop skills I can use in a future career. Additionally I am most excited to talk to organizations such as the Asian Business Student Association, where I can learn from people who have similar backgrounds as me and can help push me in the right direction.  

Each time I’ve toured the Forty Acres, I’ve felt a sense of belonging that extends beyond the campus. The community feels personal in a way I haven’t experienced in Lubbock, and being closer to Houston matters to me because family is central to my life. As a transfer student, I aim to pursue a deeper personal and professional relationship with economics as well as bring a unique perspective to the classroom.

He showed up For me. So i chose him. I didn’t know it would turn into this. I tried so hard to be the person he wanted to be but i can’t. I have to be myself and not someone I’m not. He knows who i am. 

its not Perfect. It’s never been. I tried really tried. And he takes and takes. I put my foot down. I made boundaries and he becomes a victim. So we scurry to own sides of the house. We pretend things are good. After all, Grandma wouldnt approve of divorce. But he would. He would leave in an instant if he had an out. I know it. He’s all but said it. He told me. He would rather sleep in the car than deal with me and the truth. So we pretend. We pretend it’s love. It’s love. But it’s not the kind of love romance movies are built on. Its friend love. theres no intimacy or romance. It’s grey. It’s shallow. It’s cold.

We could pretend we actually dance in the kitchen, smile, chat and have good conversations, work along side eachother to build a life. But we don’t. You don’t want to dance with me. You don’t want to make memories. You don’t care. You don’t celebrate me, us, the kids, our wins. Nothing.

this is becoming a really hard life to live. A lonely one. maybe that’s why i keep thinking of blue eyes from a lifetime ago. Maybe that’s why i keep having this reoccurring dream of going on a date with blue eyes at a restaurant overlooking the ocean… a restaurant idk if it even exists. It’s just another figment of my imagination. 

loneliness. The real silent killer. Killing me slowly on the inside. Sad thing is i know im not the only one. But no one wants to admit it. If they did we could all get the lonely people together and be less lonely. Maybe we could even find some temporary happiness and joy. 

where are you joy?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I was born and raised in a super strict, hyper-religious, southern Baptist household with two parents that were extremely racist and homophobic.

Think of your stereotypical “God, guns, Jesus, country, Bible” hicks. That’s my whole family. 

I used to be racist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, and an extremely narrowminded MAGA nationalist. I was intolerant of anything or anyone not like me. I was this way all the way until my early 20s.

In my early 20s, I began to read more and I began to actually question everything I had been brought up to believe. This was mostly due to seeing people online trashing everything I was raised to believe was right. I read a lot of compelling arguments against religion, racism, and every other gross personal belief I held. Yet, cognitive bias allowed me to push it out of my mind until I could push no more.

I figured we both cannot be correct, so I told myself I’m going to be as unbiased as I can and research this thoroughly.

After about three years of reading articles, books, research papers, and historical literature, hell, even watching YouTubers who I’d avoided for years because I didn’t want my echo chamber ruined, I came out the other side a left-leaning, empathetic atheist who is no longer racist, homophobic, xenophobic, or transphobic. 

All that is great, except for one of my closest friend in the world is still a dyed-in-the-wool Trump supporter, who is overtly racist, homophobic, xenophobic, transphobic. It is almost like looking in the past at my former self. I detest his personality, but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t still love the guy.

It’s also worth mentioning I think he has caught on to my transformation. We’ve grown much more distant in the past five or six years and I feel like it’s doing neither of us any good.

I feel like I should grab a coffee with him and just explain my growth as a person, my new personal beliefs, and how I think we are incompatible as friends and how I would like to just discontinue any contact.

( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

Bored as all living hell. I’m traveling through deep space with a group who specialize in transporting goods or people to wherever they need to be, aboard a transport vessel whose greatest achievement is proving that time can crawl. My job is ship maintenance. Sometimes I check on cargo. Sometimes I babysit passengers. But once in a blue moon we actually get to do something interesting. 

Most of the time, it’s just slowly drifting through space long enough that you start wondering if dying of old age counts as an occupational hazard. I’m writing down some stuff to pass the time on this damn ship. I hope these will be somewhat interesting to you. They’re not as cool or exciting as some of the other spacecraft going around. But hey, you found these entries, so I’m guessing you’re desperate for something. So let me tell you a little bit about a time on The Rust Star Boat, or RSB for short.


So no shit, there I was on the RSB, peacefully asleep, enjoying one of the few times I have to myself when suddenly the peaceful moment was ruined.


“Fornax! Fornax! Wake up!” Comet said, rocking me back and forth. “I need your help with the engine. You have got to show me how the energy converter works, and you need to do it in a way that I can actually understand this time!” I don’t understand how she can wake up this early every time to nag me. I’m wondering if she even sleeps at this point.


I groan from not getting enough sleep from this constant torment and brush her away.
“You’re not going to get breakfast if you keep sleeping in!” Even though there’s no sleep schedule we need to follow, if you want food, you have to show up on time if you want it hot and ready. I reluctantly rolled out of bed for food. Comet skipped ahead of me to the kitchen, where everyone else was waiting.


This is Comet, our other engineer. I don’t know why we have two engineers when she doesn’t even know how to do her job. Comet is a complete novice who barely passed school and just jumped aboard when she could. I make sure she doesn’t destroy the ship, but she’s not bad at everything else. She’s good at cleaning, cooking, and passenger care. She’s fine around weaponry if needed. Just... she’s so adamant about wanting to be an engineer and pesters me to teach her to become a master. So basically, never gonna happen. But she’s sweet, besides waking me up way too early to work on the same part I already fixed.


“Mornin’, Fornax. How’d you sleep?” the captain said with a mouth full of eggs.
This is Captain Macross. The captain is a large, muscular, cheerful guy. Probably the only person out there who can run this slow ship and not make it a living hell. He’s caring, considerate, can make everyone laugh, and surprisingly smart when it comes down to it. If it wasn’t for the little box we’re stuck in, I’d be more than happy to have him as a captain on literally any other ship. He’s just a bit too loud and tall to fly around in this box.


Next to him drinking coffee is Icarus. He doesn’t have a real title besides Captain Macross’s right-hand man, but he mostly manages the supplies on the ship. A perfectionist, but he gets the job done. He’s tall, skinny, no muscles, looks like he’ll snap in half standing next to the large captain. He’s almost the direct opposite of the captain: too serious, doesn’t talk much, comes off as rude. But there’s a reason he’s the captain’s right-hand man. They’re like brothers who trust and care for each other. Icarus could learn to not be a jackass every once in a while.


“Poorly. Why is breakfast at an ungodly hour?” I said, getting some coffee.


There’s me, Fornax. Not much more to say from what I told you earlier. I’m an engineer who can’t afford to leave and find a better gig. Not my first space trip with a bunch of weird faces, and certainly not my last for a good long while.


“Because the chef said so!” Comet said while making me a plate, then handing it to me. I hate how everyone just accepts this cruel abuse of power, but I also really hate how good a cook Comet is. I never really care for home made food, I can basically live off the nutritional gel. Having said that, putting Comet on cooking duty makes me reluctant to go back to that job.


“What are you planning to do today, Fornax?” the captain said with his mouth still full of food.


“Depends. Does the ship still need fixing, or are we getting a new one?” I said before taking a sip of coffee. The captain burst out in a fit of laughter, spewing spit and tiny bits of food on the table.


“HA! You sure know how to make a good joke, Fornax! I’d take it you’ve been spending most of your time in the engine room. We’ll come getcha if we reach our destination or need something else fixed!”


“Noted.” I got up to take my plate to the sink.


“Oh, here. Give that to me.” Comet said, washing the dishes.


“Thanks.”


“But don’t leave just yet. I want to join you on our way down into the heart of the RSB!”


“Ok.” I left and started heading to the engine room. The lights flickered on my way down, another problem I’ll fix later. Reaching my other room with how long it takes to make sure the old stupid thing doesn’t fall apart on us. But I do enjoy peacefully working on machines by myself. I’ve been working with metal and machines my whole life, but it never fails to put me at ease. I’d enjoy my brief moment of calm and joy before I heard small footsteps running down the hall.


“Fornax! I told you not to leave without me!” Comet yelled when she entered the room.


“Huh? Oh, sorry. My brain doesn’t work that well without my 8 hours of sleep.”


“Aww! I’ve missed so much valuable info. I’ll never get anywhere at this pace.” Comet said, It’s odd how she likes all of this stuff and can name what they are, but tinkering or fixing them is out of the question.


Most of the day was me fixing the ship and trying my damndest to find ways to have Comet do anything that doesn’t damage the ship, then go fix the problems she somehow manages to cause. This went on for a little bit until Pavo’s voice rang out from the speaker.


“Fornax, head on up to the control room.” The captain probably needed something, so I told Comet not to touch anything and made my way there. Arriving at the cramped control room with Pavo plugged in and the captain waiting for me.


I should mention Pavo real quick, our Intelligent Construct assigned to the RSB. This hunk of metal is the pilot of the ship and helps maintain life support, a handy fellow who doesn’t take up too much space. He mostly stays docked in the charging port by the controls and can communicate through the comms throughout the ship. This helps us with our limited space, and with his low battery life. Pavo is an ancient model. I’m really surprised that the captain and Icarus would keep such an old thing with them. But despite needing to be plugged in and being the second-most-needed thing for repairs, it’s nice to have a reliable construct on the ship. Even if he can be a bit blunt at times, I still trust him more than most flesh-and-bones I know.


“Need something, captain?”


“Ah, there you are, Fornax. We got a problem with the radar. Pavo said he saw something, but it died out before he could check what it was. We need you to fix it and see if something’s out there.”


“Sure thing, boss.” One good thing about this ship is that it’s really not too hard to fix. With newer ships and the latest and greatest stuff, you need to learn all the new equipment and all the difficult ins and outs on the go. It’s nice to not worry about that and just fix things you already know.


“There you go. It should be fine now.” We all looked at the screen to see if anything was still out there. And damn, something was.


“Huh? What was that?” I said, looking up at the screen. There was a second where the radar was showing something, but it left before anyone could identify what it was.


“Yeah, this can’t be good. I’m hoping it was just some debris floating past us.”


“And what do you think it really is? Our luck doesn’t account for junk moving past us and not damaging the exterior.”


“Hmmm. Pavo, are you picking anything up from motion sensors?”


“Negative, Captain. No signs of movement or life outside the ship.”


“It’s never too late to say that we just saw a glitch on the screen.”


“I still don’t like the look of this. Pavo, keep all systems running for any movement or interference and report back to me for any updates. Fornax, you’re with me until we regroup with everyone els—” Suddenly, the whole room went dark. No flickering, no dimming, just sudden darkness. It wasn’t the usual power outage, I’ve dealt with that plenty of times to know this was something else.


“The light? Captain, do you think this has to do with the thing outside, or wanna bet that this is Comet’s doing?” It took a second, but my eyes adjusted to see the captain looking around the room.


“Let’s stick to the plan for now. Pavo, are you ok?”


“My connection to the ship has not been compromised. Only the lights have been affected, and I cannot turn them on myself.” Small colorful lights could still be seen all around us.


“All systems are running but not the lights? Why?.... Wait, Captain! I think we’re dealing with Wraiths!”


“Yeah, but this seems like a small bunch. They don’t live out here in this region with this many planets close by. They might be some wanderers, or they got caught in some kind of dark matter expansion.”


“There’re still Wraiths, and our equipment is on the other side of the ship.”


“Then let’s go over there and get rid of this infestation! Pavo, just like I said, keep me updated on anything and everything on this ship!”


“Yes sir, Captain.”


“Good. Fornax.” The captain took two flashlights from a little box and handed one to me. “Let’s go find the others.”


The captain and I walked down the quiet, dark hallway of the ship. It’s surprising how scary a place can get with no lights and entities that can kill you floating about.


“Where is Icarus? In the loading bay?”


“Yep, that’s where I last saw him before Pavo called me up—which is why we’re going there first. As you know, the loading bay has the least protective walls against beings like Wraiths. This ship was built before there was technology that can adapt to what cargo we’re holding, so we’re stuck with thinner walls for our cargo and an easy way to let unwanted guests in. I want to check on Comet, but if she’s still holed up with the engine, then she’s in the safest place on the ship. Icarus could be in danger right now. We need to find him along with our Wraith-repellent!” Can’t argue with that logic. Off we went to save Icarus—or so we thought, until not long after, we heard Comet screaming down the other hallway.


“Comet? Guess she’s not fine.”


“Come on! We need to save her. She doesn’t know what we’re dealing with!” the captain said, running to the engine room. I followed right behind him.


“Wait! What about our stuff? We’re unarmed, even if they’re smaller than usual.”


The captain looked at me with a grin, “That’s why I brought these flashlights! They hate light, and these bad boys come with an ultra-bright setting that will either stun or scare away our ghastly friends. Got them on sale, to boot!”


“This is probably the only time your bad spending habits actually paid off!” We continued to run, then stopped at the corner right before the engine room.


“On my mark, we’ll set our lights to max and scare away the Wraiths and save Comet. Ready? 1… 2… 3!” Both of us jumped out, pointing our extremely bright flashlights forward to scare someone else we didn’t intend to.


“AH! Guys, stop! It’s too much light!” It was Comet, covering her eyes, perfectly fine.


“Comet! We thought you were being attacked by Wraiths !” the captain said while pointing his flashlight away.


“Wraiths? What’s that?” Comet said, rubbing her eyes.


“Wait, hold up. If you don’t know what Wraiths are, then why were you screaming?”


“Oh, well, you see—when you left, I thought it would be a fun challenge to blindfold myself and try to screw in some bolts. I thought I was doing a good job, so I took off the blindfold with the room totally dark, so I screamed thinking I was going blind. But it turns out the power went out, and you guys are here, so it’s all good now!”


“Well, I’m glad to see you’re alright. Can’t have a young star like you getting hurt.”


“Ugh. First off, don’t do that again. Second, we should go find Icarus. Comet, you stay here with as much light as possible.” I said putting away some of the tools Comet left out.


“What about you two? You still haven’t told me what’s going on and what this Wraiths thing is.”


“We’ll tell you later. Right now, me and the captain need to head to the loading bay and hopefully find Icarus before. Click…. click, click. Click click click click. What? Is it broken? No, it’s out of power. Captain, how’s your flashlight?”


“Well, mine is. Click……. Huh? Click, click, click. Oh, that’s why they were on sale. The extra-bright mode uses up all the current juice in the lights, so it’s a one-time thing. Kinda forgot about that.” The captain said, tossing the dead flashlight to the side.


“Great. One of our crewmates is missing, there are Wraiths aboard, we don’t have anything to even cause a distraction, and we don’t have any spare batteries for the dumb flashlight that you just had to buy. Man, I’m getting another headache.”


“Don’t worry, Fornax.” Comet put her hand on my back. “I’m sure you can figure something out.” The captain put his hand on my shoulder with the same message in his eyes.


“Ugh. We’ll just use some weaker light until we find our stuff. Comet still stays and hides for now, we’ll find you when all of this is over.”


“Fornax is right. You’re too inexperienced in this kind of stuff. It would help us a lot if you’re in a safe spot so we don’t have to worry about more than one crewmate in trouble.”


“Yes, Captain.” Comet went off into the back of the engine room and collected every light that wasn’t bolted to the room.


“So, about that other light.” The captain said, leaning towards me.


“Huh? Oh, yeah. I have a small flashlight on me—only one, so we’re going to have to share.” I pulled out my own flashlight. I kinda forgot I had it in my utility belt until I was shown that the ones the captain bought were utter dog shit.


“Fine by me. Let’s go find Icarus!” The captain slapped my back and pushed me along to the front. Holding onto the flashlight, we made our way through the dark ship yet again.
Another way to tell if a spaceship is boarded by Wraiths—besides the lights—is how fucking cold it will get. I’ve heard that some unlucky ships encounter a massive horde of really old Wraiths and completely freeze over the whole ship, killing everyone and everything aboard. I haven’t seen any proof of this happening, but I’m not interested in finding out. All I know is that they don’t kill outright, just that their existence could kill someone just by being too close to one.


It didn’t take long for me to see my own breath and start shivering. The captain’s fine with all the muscle mass he has to keep himself warm.


“I’ve been telling ya to put on some more weight. Muscles aren’t only meant to move heavy stuff around.”


“Y-yeah, b-but someone needs t-to keep this damn ship in one p-piece! I-I don’t have time t-to work out l-like some p-people!” Breathing into my hands to no avail, we continued on slowly so we didn’t stumble into a face full of cold death.


The silence was killing me. I could only hear my teeth chattering and my footsteps as we made our way through the ship.


“C-captain, d-don’t you have s-something ins-spiring to sa—?” I turned to the captain, but he wasn’t there. I looked back to see that I was all alone, feeling the temperature dropping as I realized that I’m all alone. I quickened my pace while holding out a metal rod I found in front of me. If the metal starts to freeze over, I’ll at least have some chance to save my ass. I started to run as I saw the loading bay door just up ahead. The metal in the floor and walls was creaking and shifting from the extreme cold, breathing became harder as they began to freeze over, my finger felt like falling off but I held on desperately to both the flashlight and rod. Besides being really cold, this wasn’t the worst. Which was my last normal thought till everything started to slow down as I remembered what the captain said earlier: “This ship was built before there was technology that can adapt to what cargo we’re holding, so we’re stuck with thinner walls for our cargo and an easy way to let unwanted guests in.” Meaning I didn’t have any way to react to the metal rod I was holding getting completely frozen over on its side.


I jolted awake, feeling my eyelashes breaking apart from being frozen over. Peeling my face and then body off the floor, I felt numb and heavy. Thankfully, I dropped the piece of metal before I lost my hand to the cold with it. Some snot and mucus were frozen on my face, but I ignored it along with the lights now back on as I made my way towards the loading bay, with the captain’s back blocking the way.


“C-... Captain?! Wh-where were y-you?! I-I-I think a Wraith brushed past m-me, a-and how are t-the lights back on?! And for the l-love of god, what are you doing just standing ther—!” I grabbed the captain by the shoulder and moved him to the side to see Icarus on the floor. He was completely pale with frostbite all over the exposed skin, blue lips and fingers. There’s even a pool of spit running down to the floor that was completely frozen. His eyes were open, but the mucus on the eyes were also frozen to ice. Some parts of his clothes had some small patches of frost coating it, some of it continued to the floor where he fell. There was a small patch of blood from the fall, but that too was frozen solid before it had the chance to seep out.


“H-how long do you think he’s been like this?” I said, rubbing my hands together.


“Welp, hard to say. Just got here myself, poor bud.” We both looked down at the dead man who lay frozen before us for a few seconds. “But the lights came back on. Pavo called us up when he noticed that the Wraiths were leaving. You were probably too scared to hear anything, huh?” the captain said, poking me in the arm.


“Haha, very funny. So no more Wraiths?”


“That’s what Pavo said, but those ghostly bastards did a number on my ship! It’s going to take forever to get rid of all the ice!” 


“God damnit!  And here I thought I was finally making progress. So, you’re going to put him in the revive chamber? We really haven’t cleaned it out that well.”


“Yeah,” The captain said, reaching down to put Icarus over his shoulder. “but I can't have my right-hand man sleeping on the job! You know that we can’t sleep on the job even if we’re dead! Shouldn’t take too long for him to wake up.”


“And you’re still against telling Comet about it? It’s supposed to be basic 101 space travel knowledge so the whole crew doesn’t get wiped out in situations like this!”


“Yeah, but I just don’t think she can handle that topic just yet. You’ve seen how sad she gets when some random bozo dies in the daily news report. How do you think she’ll react to this kind of tech? Let alone some of the backwards stuff our employers pull? Some time is in order to prepare her for this position she chose, and we should ease her into it. She’s just a kid, Fornax. There’s no rush to turn her into a corporate slave just yet.” The captain said, taking Icarus into the revive station near the cockpit.


“You’re the boss. I just hope this decision doesn’t leave us all dead in space. I need a drink.”


And there you go, a normal day you can expect here on the RSB. Nothing too crazy, if you asked me. I had to ask Pavo about this time because I forgot most of the details, and he recommended this little moment when I was having a hard time picking one out. I’d say it’s ok to show you what goes on in our daily lives, besides long stretches of nothing and working. The lesson of the story is never buy cheap flashlights, not worth it when nearly freezing to death. Let me know if you guys would like to hear more stuff from our adventures. I’m sure Pavo has plenty backed up in the ship’s files. I enjoyed taking a break from the usual. I just hope it didn’t bore you to death.

I went straight back to ChatGPT which to be honest is not as good as I remembered.  Later after the rage subsided, I went back to using Gemini, grok and ChatGPT rarely. 

I have been using “Fast” model and I don’t find it to be much if at all worse than pro. And since I don’t have to wait long it is a better experience than when I paid and used pro each time… lol

But I wonder - are there some cases when normal stuff would be better analyzed by pro? I kinda wish it just had an auto option where the correct model was chosen.

1qlb1sp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1qlb1sp/daily_notes_of_a_boring_space_adventure/,Daily Notes of a Boring Space Adventure,"Hey, how's it going? Good? I hope so. Me? Bored as all living hell. I’m traveling through deep space with a group who specialize in transporting goods or people to wherever they need to be, aboard a transport vessel whose greatest achievement is proving that time can crawl. My job is ship maintenance. Sometimes I check on cargo. Sometimes I babysit passengers. But once in a blue moon we actually get to do something interesting. 

Most of the time, it’s just slowly drifting through space long enough that you start wondering if dying of old age counts as an occupational hazard. I’m writing down some stuff to pass the time on this damn ship. I hope these will be somewhat interesting to you. They’re not as cool or exciting as some of the other spacecraft going around. But hey, you found these entries, so I’m guessing you’re desperate for something. So let me tell you a little bit about a time on The Rust Star Boat, or RSB for short.


So no shit, there I was on the RSB, peacefully asleep, enjoying one of the few times I have to myself when suddenly the peaceful moment was ruined.


“Fornax! Fornax! Wake up!” Comet said, rocking me back and forth. “I need your help with the engine. You have got to show me how the energy converter works, and you need to do it in a way that I can actually understand this time!” I don’t understand how she can wake up this early every time to nag me. I’m wondering if she even sleeps at this point.


I groan from not getting enough sleep from this constant torment and brush her away.
“You’re not going to get breakfast if you keep sleeping in!” Even though there’s no sleep schedule we need to follow, if you want food, you have to show up on time if you want it hot and ready. I reluctantly rolled out of bed for food. Comet skipped ahead of me to the kitchen, where everyone else was waiting.


This is Comet, our other engineer. I don’t know why we have two engineers when she doesn’t even know how to do her job. Comet is a complete novice who barely passed school and just jumped aboard when she could. I make sure she doesn’t destroy the ship, but she’s not bad at everything else. She’s good at cleaning, cooking, and passenger care. She’s fine around weaponry if needed. Just... she’s so adamant about wanting to be an engineer and pesters me to teach her to become a master. So basically, never gonna happen. But she’s sweet, besides waking me up way too early to work on the same part I already fixed.


“Mornin’, Fornax. How’d you sleep?” the captain said with a mouth full of eggs.
This is Captain Macross. The captain is a large, muscular, cheerful guy. Probably the only person out there who can run this slow ship and not make it a living hell. He’s caring, considerate, can make everyone laugh, and surprisingly smart when it comes down to it. If it wasn’t for the little box we’re stuck in, I’d be more than happy to have him as a captain on literally any other ship. He’s just a bit too loud and tall to fly around in this box.


Next to him drinking coffee is Icarus. He doesn’t have a real title besides Captain Macross’s right-hand man, but he mostly manages the supplies on the ship. A perfectionist, but he gets the job done. He’s tall, skinny, no muscles, looks like he’ll snap in half standing next to the large captain. He’s almost the direct opposite of the captain: too serious, doesn’t talk much, comes off as rude. But there’s a reason he’s the captain’s right-hand man. They’re like brothers who trust and care for each other. Icarus could learn to not be a jackass every once in a while.


“Poorly. Why is breakfast at an ungodly hour?” I said, getting some coffee.


There’s me, Fornax. Not much more to say from what I told you earlier. I’m an engineer who can’t afford to leave and find a better gig. Not my first space trip with a bunch of weird faces, and certainly not my last for a good long while.


“Because the chef said so!” Comet said while making me a plate, then handing it to me. I hate how everyone just accepts this cruel abuse of power, but I also really hate how good a cook Comet is. I never really care for home made food, I can basically live off the nutritional gel. Having said that, putting Comet on cooking duty makes me reluctant to go back to that job.


“What are you planning to do today, Fornax?” the captain said with his mouth still full of food.


“Depends. Does the ship still need fixing, or are we getting a new one?” I said before taking a sip of coffee. The captain burst out in a fit of laughter, spewing spit and tiny bits of food on the table.


“HA! You sure know how to make a good joke, Fornax! I’d take it you’ve been spending most of your time in the engine room. We’ll come getcha if we reach our destination or need something else fixed!”


“Noted.” I got up to take my plate to the sink.


“Oh, here. Give that to me.” Comet said, washing the dishes.


“Thanks.”


“But don’t leave just yet. I want to join you on our way down into the heart of the RSB!”


“Ok.” I left and started heading to the engine room. The lights flickered on my way down, another problem I’ll fix later. Reaching my other room with how long it takes to make sure the old stupid thing doesn’t fall apart on us. But I do enjoy peacefully working on machines by myself. I’ve been working with metal and machines my whole life, but it never fails to put me at ease. I’d enjoy my brief moment of calm and joy before I heard small footsteps running down the hall.


“Fornax! I told you not to leave without me!” Comet yelled when she entered the room.


“Huh? Oh, sorry. My brain doesn’t work that well without my 8 hours of sleep.”


“Aww! I’ve missed so much valuable info. I’ll never get anywhere at this pace.” Comet said, It’s odd how she likes all of this stuff and can name what they are, but tinkering or fixing them is out of the question.


Most of the day was me fixing the ship and trying my damndest to find ways to have Comet do anything that doesn’t damage the ship, then go fix the problems she somehow manages to cause. This went on for a little bit until Pavo’s voice rang out from the speaker.


“Fornax, head on up to the control room.” The captain probably needed something, so I told Comet not to touch anything and made my way there. Arriving at the cramped control room with Pavo plugged in and the captain waiting for me.


I should mention Pavo real quick, our Intelligent Construct assigned to the RSB. This hunk of metal is the pilot of the ship and helps maintain life support, a handy fellow who doesn’t take up too much space. He mostly stays docked in the charging port by the controls and can communicate through the comms throughout the ship. This helps us with our limited space, and with his low battery life. Pavo is an ancient model. I’m really surprised that the captain and Icarus would keep such an old thing with them. But despite needing to be plugged in and being the second-most-needed thing for repairs, it’s nice to have a reliable construct on the ship. Even if he can be a bit blunt at times, I still trust him more than most flesh-and-bones I know.


“Need something, captain?”


“Ah, there you are, Fornax. We got a problem with the radar. Pavo said he saw something, but it died out before he could check what it was. We need you to fix it and see if something’s out there.”


“Sure thing, boss.” One good thing about this ship is that it’s really not too hard to fix. With newer ships and the latest and greatest stuff, you need to learn all the new equipment and all the difficult ins and outs on the go. It’s nice to not worry about that and just fix things you already know.


“There you go. It should be fine now.” We all looked at the screen to see if anything was still out there. And damn, something was.


“Huh? What was that?” I said, looking up at the screen. There was a second where the radar was showing something, but it left before anyone could identify what it was.


“Yeah, this can’t be good. I’m hoping it was just some debris floating past us.”


“And what do you think it really is? Our luck doesn’t account for junk moving past us and not damaging the exterior.”


“Hmmm. Pavo, are you picking anything up from motion sensors?”


“Negative, Captain. No signs of movement or life outside the ship.”


“It’s never too late to say that we just saw a glitch on the screen.”


“I still don’t like the look of this. Pavo, keep all systems running for any movement or interference and report back to me for any updates. Fornax, you’re with me until we regroup with everyone els—” Suddenly, the whole room went dark. No flickering, no dimming, just sudden darkness. It wasn’t the usual power outage, I’ve dealt with that plenty of times to know this was something else.


“The light? Captain, do you think this has to do with the thing outside, or wanna bet that this is Comet’s doing?” It took a second, but my eyes adjusted to see the captain looking around the room.


“Let’s stick to the plan for now. Pavo, are you ok?”


“My connection to the ship has not been compromised. Only the lights have been affected, and I cannot turn them on myself.” Small colorful lights could still be seen all around us.


“All systems are running but not the lights? Why?.... Wait, Captain! I think we’re dealing with Wraiths!”


“Yeah, but this seems like a small bunch. They don’t live out here in this region with this many planets close by. They might be some wanderers, or they got caught in some kind of dark matter expansion.”


“There’re still Wraiths, and our equipment is on the other side of the ship.”


“Then let’s go over there and get rid of this infestation! Pavo, just like I said, keep me updated on anything and everything on this ship!”


“Yes sir, Captain.”


“Good. Fornax.” The captain took two flashlights from a little box and handed one to me. “Let’s go find the others.”


The captain and I walked down the quiet, dark hallway of the ship. It’s surprising how scary a place can get with no lights and entities that can kill you floating about.


“Where is Icarus? In the loading bay?”


“Yep, that’s where I last saw him before Pavo called me up—which is why we’re going there first. As you know, the loading bay has the least protective walls against beings like Wraiths. This ship was built before there was technology that can adapt to what cargo we’re holding, so we’re stuck with thinner walls for our cargo and an easy way to let unwanted guests in. I want to check on Comet, but if she’s still holed up with the engine, then she’s in the safest place on the ship. Icarus could be in danger right now. We need to find him along with our Wraith-repellent!” Can’t argue with that logic. Off we went to save Icarus—or so we thought, until not long after, we heard Comet screaming down the other hallway.


“Comet? Guess she’s not fine.”


“Come on! We need to save her. She doesn’t know what we’re dealing with!” the captain said, running to the engine room. I followed right behind him.


“Wait! What about our stuff? We’re unarmed, even if they’re smaller than usual.”


The captain looked at me with a grin, “That’s why I brought these flashlights! They hate light, and these bad boys come with an ultra-bright setting that will either stun or scare away our ghastly friends. Got them on sale, to boot!”


“This is probably the only time your bad spending habits actually paid off!” We continued to run, then stopped at the corner right before the engine room.


“On my mark, we’ll set our lights to max and scare away the Wraiths and save Comet. Ready? 1… 2… 3!” Both of us jumped out, pointing our extremely bright flashlights forward to scare someone else we didn’t intend to.

“Wraiths? What’s that?” Comet said, rubbing her eyes.


“Wait, hold up. If you don’t know what Wraiths are, then why were you screaming?”


“Oh, well, you see—when you left, I thought it would be a fun challenge to blindfold myself and try to screw in some bolts. I thought I was doing a good job, so I took off the blindfold with the room totally dark, so I screamed thinking I was going blind. But it turns out the power went out, and you guys are here, so it’s all good now!”


“Well, I’m glad to see you’re alright. Can’t have a young star like you getting hurt.”

“Great. One of our crewmates is missing, there are Wraiths aboard, we don’t have anything to even cause a distraction, and we don’t have any spare batteries for the dumb flashlight that you just had to buy. Man, I’m getting another headache.”


“Don’t worry, Fornax.” Comet put her hand on my back. “I’m sure you can figure something out.” The captain put his hand on my shoulder with the same message in his eyes.


“Ugh. We’ll just use some weaker light until we find our stuff. Comet still stays and hides for now, we’ll find you when all of this is over.”


“Fornax is right. You’re too inexperienced in this kind of stuff. It would help us a lot if you’re in a safe spot so we don’t have to worry about more than one crewmate in trouble.”


“Yes, Captain.” Comet went off into the back of the engine room and collected every light that wasn’t bolted to the room.


“So, about that other light.” The captain said, leaning towards me.


“Huh? Oh, yeah. I have a small flashlight on me—only one, so we’re going to have to share.” I pulled out my own flashlight. I kinda forgot I had it in my utility belt until I was shown that the ones the captain bought were utter dog shit.


“Fine by me. Let’s go find Icarus!” The captain slapped my back and pushed me along to the front. Holding onto the flashlight, we made our way through the dark ship yet again.
Another way to tell if a spaceship is boarded by Wraiths—besides the lights—is how fucking cold it will get.

He was completely pale with frostbite all over the exposed skin, blue lips and fingers. There’s even a pool of spit running down to the floor that was completely frozen.

“Haha, very funny. So no more Wraiths?”


“That’s what Pavo said, but those ghostly bastards did a number on my ship! It’s going to take forever to get rid of all the ice!” 


“God damnit!  And here I thought I was finally making progress. So, you’re going to put him in the revive chamber? We really haven’t cleaned it out that well.”


“Yeah,” The captain said, reaching down to put Icarus over his shoulder. “but I can't have my right-hand man sleeping on the job! You know that we can’t sleep on the job even if we’re dead! Shouldn’t take too long for him to wake up.”


“And you’re still against telling Comet about it? It’s supposed to be basic 101 space travel knowledge so the whole crew doesn’t get wiped out in situations like this!”


“Yeah, but I just don’t think she can handle that topic just yet. You’ve seen how sad she gets when some random bozo dies in the daily news report. How do you think she’ll react to this kind of tech? Let alone some of the backwards stuff our employers pull? Some time is in order to prepare her for this position she chose, and we should ease her into it. She’s just a kid, Fornax. There’s no rush to turn her into a corporate slave just yet.” The captain said, taking Icarus into the revive station near the cockpit.


“You’re the boss. I just hope this decision doesn’t leave us all dead in space. I need a drink.”


And there you go, a normal day you can expect here on the RSB. Nothing too crazy, if you asked me. I had to ask Pavo about this time because I forgot most of the details, and he recommended this little moment when I was having a hard time picking one out. I’d say it’s ok to show you what goes on in our daily lives, besides long stretches of nothing and working. The lesson of the story is never buy cheap flashlights, not worth it when nearly freezing to death. Let me know if you guys would like to hear more stuff from our adventures. I’m sure Pavo has plenty backed up in the ship’s files. I enjoyed taking a break from the usual. I just hope it didn’t bore you to death.

“Blue Dog Transports — or the BDT. Affordable, intercity bus travel. Buy your digital ticket now!”

My hand shivered as I turned it over. Against the snow, it looked wrong. Too… red.

I scrubbed until my skin burned. I scrubbed. I scrubbed and I scrubbed and I scrubbed… but it never lifted. It stayed. It stained. Why wouldn’t it come off?

I sank onto a frozen bench beneath the ill-lit canopy.

Small, unsteady clouds escaped from my lips.

A thin haze clung to the street.

My eyelids felt nearly frozen together. I forced them open, blinking through a brief blur.

When my vision cleared, he was there.

He stood just three feet in front of me, dark-skinned and poised, dressed in a deep blue suit. His polished cane caught the streetlight like something old and ceremonial.

“Why, I do declare, miss,” he said. “Did I frighten you?”

The phone fell from my hand and landed at his feet.

He knelt slowly, pinching it between long, thin fingers.

“I don’t quite understand these strange mechanics.”

“They just weigh your pants down.”

The gentleman flashed a pearly white smile, amused by his own joke.

“Go on now. Take it. I won’t bite.”

I reached for the phone, and he grabbed my crime, examining its boldness.

“Well, well, well… what do we have here?”

I wrenched myself free, snatching back the phone.

“My apologies, darlin’. Just a sight I know well.”

“You can call me Mr. Everett.” He tipped his hat. “Now, what’s a lady like you doing out here, Miss…?”

I hesitated.

“Sarah. My name is Sarah.” It felt strange in my mouth.

“Ah, Miss Sarah! What a timeless name.”

Mr. Everett stared back at me, his dapper demeanor out of place on the empty street.

“What… what are you doing out here?”

I kept my voice low.

“Why, I presume the same reason you’re here, Miss Sarah! I’ve got a place to go!”

He watched me long enough that responding felt like a mistake.

“Where are you going?”

“Oh, not too far, Miss Sarah… Whereabouts are you headed?”

The brim of his hat dipped as he studied me. Even under the streetlight, his pupils looked completely dilated.

“I… uhhh… I’m… well… I don’t know.” That wasn’t a lie. “Just far away from here.”

“Why, Miss Sarah, this city bus won’t take you too far. Not as far as you need to go, that is.”

He tapped the tip of his cane against the hardening snow.

“What you’re lookin’ for is the 1318. That ol’ thing’ll take you as far as you need to go. And I…”

Mr. Everett reached into his vest pocket.

“…just so happen to have a ticket right here.”

He extended his arm toward me, revealing a small but impressive-looking bus ticket in the palm of his hand.

It was beautiful, almost impossibly so.

Ruby-red inscriptions traced intricate designs across its golden surface.

A deep emerald border framed the red, sharp and vivid, like blood held in place, and on the stub, etched in the same emerald, were the numbers 1318.

“Just trade your ticket for mine, and we can be on our way!”

“But… how would that even work? I only have a digital ticket.”

Mr. Everett leaned closer, the brim of his hat dipping low, casting his face in shadow.

“Miss Sarah, sometimes honesty is worth far more than gold.”

His fingers flexed around the ticket, almost caressing it.

“We can do an exchange. A verbal contract.”

He straightened and held the ticket out to me.

“I’ll make sure the bus driver knows the arrangement.”

“All you need to say is, ‘What was mine is now yours.’ Say it, and we’ll have our trade. Say it, and the ticket is yours. Say it… and you’ll be on your way.”

I reached for the ticket — and for a moment, I swear I saw it throb.

Then I said the words that would seal our strange bargain:

“What was mine is now yours.”

Time stilled. Sound fell away, and it felt as if all the air had been pulled from the world.  
Mr. Everett looked at me, his eyes locked with mine as headlights flared behind his head.

“Good luck, Miss Sarah.”

He tipped his hat— and vanished.

The bus ticket drifted down in his place, catching the light as it settled on the snow.  
When I bent to pick it up, the bus doors were already open in front of me.

My foot hit the first step and I pulled myself in.

The bus was dated but clean, bathed in a sickly green-yellow light that made my eyes ache. The air smelled of burnt metal and old paper. A faint hum thrummed beneath my feet.

“Ticket, please.”

The man behind the wheel didn’t turn or blink.  
His gaze stayed fixed straight ahead, posture locked in place like he’d been molded into the seat.

I held out my ticket.

His eyes flicked once to my stained fingers—brief, exact, uninterested—before his white-gloved hand lifted the slip away.

He turned it slightly, then pressed a small device to the paper, burning an arcane pattern of intersecting triangles, before placing it back in my possession.

He faced forward again.

The triangles flickered across the paper, their corners sparking along lines I couldn’t follow.

A question hovered on my tongue, but something about the bus swallowed it.

I slid the ticket into my pocket and faced the aisle.  
Keeping my head down, I walked to the back of the bus and slipped into an empty seat in the far right corner.

I sank into it. The faint hum beneath the floor drifted into silence.

…

The screeching of brakes ripped me awake. Sweat prickled my forehead. I sat with my head against the window.

Outside, the darkness was total, as if the bus were traveling through a place left unfinished.

The doors slammed shut, and the bus lurched forward.

Someone came down the aisle, his heavy, worn coat draped over broad shoulders, a black dog slipping silently at his heels.

He halted in the aisle.

“Mind if I sit here?”

I nodded.

He eased into the seat beside me.

The four-legged companion sprang up onto his back paws, his upper body plopping into my lap.  
His eager tongue lashed at my cheeks as his claws tapped lightly on the floor.

“Cerb!”

The dog slid off my lap with a disappointed thump, then curled beside the man’s boots, letting out a soft sigh.

I shifted back in my seat.

“Sorry about that,” he said, patting his black canine on the head.  
“That there is Cerb… and I’m Pluto.”

He touched two fingers briefly to his brow, then let his hand fall back to Cerb.

“Pluto?” I wiped my face.

“That’s what they call me.”

Cerb’s ears flicked as Pluto shifted, stretching his frame between the seats before leaning back into the corner.

He settled in. His attention lingered on me.

“So,” he continued, “what brings you to these parts?”

I stared down at the floor. “I… I’m just… passing through.”

Pluto sat up, leaning the slightest bit in my direction.

“Passing through, huh? Sounds about right.”

He hooked his elbow over the back of the seat and nodded toward the rows of quiet passengers.

“You’re no different than any of them,” he said, settling back. “Everyone here comes with their own pain, their own pleasures, and their own stories.”

“And what makes you so different?”

Pluto met my eyes, something sharp and almost impressed flickering in his.

“I’m the only one who’s not running.”

Part II - Marv

Before the war, he’d been odd but harmless. A man who kept to himself, did what he was told.

Dishonorably discharged in ’69, Marv drifted through New York like a stain the city refused to claim.

One rainy night, he slept beneath a narrow awning, pressed against the slick brick wall. His jaw hung slack, the hollows in his face deepened by shadow.

In his dreams, he drifted back. Wet boots, soaked uniforms, red mud, and the metallic tang of life spilling out around him.  
There, chaos was fluent, the screams dissolved into jungle static; flesh, bone, the snap giving way.

A tickle brushed his lip, dragging him out of sleep. He spat, static clouding his gaze. A brown, bulbous mass twitched at the edge of his vision. Its yellow guts washed thin.

Marv pinched it between his fingers, smearing pale matter against his skin as he lifted it toward his mouth. He closed his eyes and bit down.

The metallic flavor spread across his tongue.

Static hissed louder as he leaned his head back and chewed, letting the sensation settle. A thick glob seeped from the corner of his mouth while his tongue moved, coated in a gritty, sticky film. Marv licked his lips.

He tore through dented trash cans in the long-abandoned alleys, tipping them over, pawing through what time had left behind. Old paper. Rusted tins. Broken things that once had purpose.  
He dug through the gaps in brickwork, the dark mouths of collapsed crates and forgotten corners, grabbing anything that skittered, buzzed, or twitched.

The sounds grounded him. The scrape of metal, the hollow thud of cans hitting concrete, the wet rustle of movement in the dark.

Warmth spread through him. Not comfort. Not relief. Heat.

Marv slumped back against the brick wall. That’s when he heard her.

“I know, I know,” she said, phone pressed to her ear. “I’m just trying to figure out where I am.”

Her heels clacked against the wet street as she drew closer. “It’s so creepy out here.”

Marv slid farther into the shadow, barely lifting his eyelids. She passed him without slowing—then stopped.

“Oh,” she murmured. “There’s a man here… sorry, sir?” She took a step closer, water splashing under her heel. “Dammit.” She lifted her foot and shook it.

When she looked up again, Marv’s eyes were open. They locked.

She understood then.

“Never mind,” she said, already backing away.

Marv lunged.

Her scream tore through the empty street, only driving him faster. She tried to run, but he caught her foot and dragged her down.

He climbed on top of her, slammed her head against the pavement once, twice, and pulled her unconscious body toward the storm drain. Her phone slipped from her fingers, its screen glowing in the puddle.

…

“They found her three months later. Marv had turned her body into a human insect farm. He harvested anything that moved. She was covered in boils, serving as his personal buffet—hers too. The medical examiner declared her DOA, but the first responders swore they saw her chewing.”

“So… what happened to Marv?”

“He was committed. When the police found them in that storm drain, he wasn’t exactly… stable.”

“Meaning?”

“He’d been living down there. He thought whatever was happening in that drain was his legacy. Called it his seed. His children. Said it gave him life.”

I felt my skin crawl. “Is he still alive?”

Pluto hung his head. “He passed recently.”

“Don’t tell me you feel sorry for him.”

“Hey now.” Pluto lifted his hands. “I’m not here to judge. And, Sarah… you really ought to respect the dead.”

Part III - Jenny

“Now, Judy, how many Pumpkin Pumps do we have left?”  
“I’m glad you asked, Janet! We only have 10,000 left in stock. And order fast because the first FIVE! THOUSAND! ORDERS!!! will get not one… but TWO!!! Pumpkin Pumps!”

Jenny lay sprawled across her mattress, surrounded by a graveyard of Hostess wrappers and Dorito crumbs.

She rolled over with a groan and landed on a fork, cake dried onto the prongs. The dull jab made her blink.

She patted blindly for the remote and shut off the TV.

A 2-liter diet soda sat on her nightstand, its cap missing. The bottle crinkled under her fingers as she took a swig. Her lips peeled from it with a sticky sound.

She rubbed her eyes and fished the clock out of the mess beside the bed.

**3:00 AM.**

Jenny rocked forward and tipped upright, grunting as she stood.

Ankles cracked like bubble wrap as she waddled toward the bathroom, pausing halfway to dig out an embedded wedgie.

Her work clothes were still on the floor from her last shift.

Jenny plopped her backpack onto the counter. It slumped open, already too full. She shoved another bag of donuts inside and dragged it off.

Wrappers and crumbs marked where the bag had been, a cream-colored envelope left behind.

She reached for it. Yellowed nails slid under the fold.

**Class of 1985**

**We are pleased to announce Bell View High’s 15-Year Class Reunion!**

**Come for a blast from the past!**

**July 12th — 6:00 PM to 11:00 PM**  
**Bell View High Gymnasium**

**RSVP with Becky @** [***mrsbeckydonahew@yahoo.com***](mailto:mrsbeckydonahew@yahoo.com)  
**$50 cover without RSVP**

**Attire: ’80s Retro**

Bell View High.

Jenny tore through her bag shoving handfuls of donuts in her mouth.

She stared at the typed invitation, chewing only once before swallowing.

*“Hey, Jenny. Is that broccoli in your pants? Or is your cellulite showing through your ass?”*

Her mind spun.

*“Hey, Jenny—do you have to pay rent for the extra square footage you take up?”*

*“And what about insurance? Hey, Jenny! Do you have to carry license and registration while operating through these hallways?”*

Her breathing grew ragged. She grabbed a diet soda and gulped it down, forcing the donut mush past the tightness in her throat.

Becky’s voice rose over the others—a singsong cadence she hadn’t heard in years.

*“Jenny, Jenny, cheap as a penny.”*

Jenny inhaled her bag of snacks.

*“Worse than a peasant. Despised like a tranny.”*

She moved to the freezer, consuming seven hand-torn pieces of frozen pizza.

*“No one will touch her, they flee at her smell.”*

Her body gave out before her mind did.

*“Be lucky you’re not her.”*

She slid down the kitchen cabinet and slumped onto the linoleum floor.

*“I’d rather choose hell.”*

Her eyes glazed. The invitation fluttered from her hand, landing a few inches from her belly.

The world began to dim around her.

Not sleep.

Not rest.

Shutting down.

A knock at the door pulled her back into consciousness.

Jenny’s eyes felt dry, as if they’d been open the whole time. Her tongue was thick. Her throat burned.

Another knock. Persistent. Polite.

The front door opened.

“Jenny?”

The voice was soft and wispy. Warm. Empty.

Mrs. Grein stepped into the kitchen in denim-styled tights and floral ballet flats, her face perfectly powdered. A short blonde pixie was fixed in place, frozen with hairspray.

Her smile was bright. Plastic.

“There you are, Jen,” she said, as if Jenny were sitting at the table instead of on the floor. She closed the door behind her.

“Jenny… shouldn’t you be at work?”

Jenny gestured toward the invitation on the floor beside the empty pizza box. Mrs. Grein followed the motion, brows lifted. Her gaze settled on the invitation.

“Ohhh,” she breathed, her voice light as cotton candy. “What’s this?” 

She bent with delicate, practiced movements and picked it up. Examined it briefly, then slowly—each syllable crisp and carefully enunciated—began to read:

“Bell… View… High…  
Fif… teen… year… re… u… nion…”

Her smile widened slightly, a brief flicker beneath the emptiness.

“Well, dear,” she said, tilting her head, “that sounds lovely.”

She set the invitation neatly on the counter, smoothing the edges with gentle fingertips, then gave one last floating smile before slipping out the door, humming a tune that wasn’t real.

Jenny stared at the counter. The invitation seemed less threatening. She pulled herself up, leaving an impression in the mess on the floor, and moved down the hall toward her parents’ old room.

The door groaned open.

A rush of crisp air brushed her stringy hair as Jenny stomped past the bed and yanked open the closet. She dug around blindly, shoving aside blankets, coats, old shoes, until her hand struck cardboard. She dragged the box out and dropped onto the floor, the bookcase rattling beside her.

Cassette tapes. Yellowed newspapers. A 1984 glam magazine. And… her old yearbook.

Jenny pulled it into her lap.

*Happy graduation, Jen! Love, Mrs. Grein*

She skimmed the pages—rows of smiling strangers. Lunch tables. Basketball games.

Then a familiar name appeared.

**Class President: Jake Donahew**

Jenny closed her eyes.

*“BEEP BEEP BEEP… GARBAGE TRUCK COMING THROUGH!”*

A shove from behind. Books scattered across the floor.

*“UH OH, TRAFFIC JAM!”*

Two boys laughed, high-fiving as they walked away.

Jenny crouched and gathered her things.

A pair of white sneakers stepped into view.

*“Forget about those jerks…”*

He knelt beside her, collecting her books.

*“You’re Jennifer, right? I’m Jake. Jake Donahew. We had… what was it… U.S. History together?”*

She looked up. Dark, clean-cut hair. Kind eyes.

He handed her the stack and smiled.

*“See you around, Jennifer.”*

The memory faded.

She stared at his picture, then reached for the old glam magazine. Glossy models. Teased bangs. Bright lipstick. Painted eyes. Neon cheeks.

**Attire: ’80s Retro**

Jenny sat stiffly on the floral loveseat while Mrs. Grein bustled around her perfectly staged living room. The yearbook and magazine lay on the coffee table.

“I want to… do this…” Jenny said, pointing at a neon-covered model on the glossy spread—

Mrs. Grein set down her teacup, then picked up the magazine with dainty excitement.

Moments later, Jenny was seated at the vanity. Mascara. Eyeshadow. Blush. Mrs. Grein’s tweezers reached for her brows. She didn’t get past the first pluck before Jenny screamed.

“Beauty is pain, dear.”

She showed her how to tease her hair. How to soften the edges. How to choose the right lipstick.

“You can have my mother’s old nightgown,” she said with a warm, distant smile. “She was quite larger than me and very broad-shouldered.”

The nightgown was satin white, with thin straps and a slit up the side. Jenny held it against herself, almost awed.

“Now all you need is an idol.” Mrs. Grein placed a hand on Jenny’s shoulder and guided her back to the vanity.

“Mine was Grace Kelly in ‘*To Catch a Thief’*.”

“I-dol?” Jenny asked, staring at herself in the mirror. For the first time, without donut crumbs or sticky soda on her lips.

“Yes, dear. Someone to look up to. Someone you can…”

Mrs. Grein stared at Jenny’s reflection, eyes empty, smile fixed.

“Someone you can mirror, dear.”

Jenny was back on her parents’ bedroom floor. Mrs. Grein’s mother’s nightgown lay smoothed out on the bed.

She went through every model in the magazine to no avail. Her yearbook followed.

The pages were sharper than expected. One of her swollen fingers snapped a page forward, slicing the tip. A blot of blood bloomed on the paper.

“Ow…” she muttered, more confused than hurt. Her yearbook lay on the floor as she sucked her finger, eyes settling on the two open pages. She read the names absently:

…Steven Spencer…  
…Todd Spencer…  
…Becky Smith…

Her heart kicked.

She stared into the black-and-white portrait. Becky’s perfect hair and white teeth smiled at her. The invitation lay beside her leg, creased and bent. Jenny reached for it, smoothing it flat.

**RSVP with Becky @** [**mrsbeckydonahew@yahoo.com**](mailto:mrsbeckydonahew@yahoo.com)

Jenny’s mind worked harder than it had in a long time.

Becky Smith.  
Jake Donahew.  
Becky Donahew.

Becky with the perfect friends.  
Becky with the perfect life.  
Becky with the perfect husband.

Jenny had found her idol..

Her parents’ bedroom filled with faces. Pages torn from magazines taped to the walls. Cutout faces of old classmates scattered across the floor. Not Becky’s.

Jenny ripped the mirror off her parents’ wooden dresser and placed it on the floor. Taping all of Becky’s yearbook photos on the glass.

Becky’s senior class portrait.  
Becky at the pep rally.  
Becky at prom.

Mrs. Grein came by with three bags of old makeup and four cans of hairspray.

“So you can find your look, dear.”

It started with practice. Mascara clumped. Blush went uneven. Eyeliner slanted and smeared.

She sat cross-legged on the floor in Mrs. Grein’s mother’s satin nightgown.

She didn’t sleep. There was no need. Week-old food lay on the counter. Chinese takeout spoiled in the fridge.

Her entire world condensed into one question:

Would Becky do this?

**July 12th 5:12 PM**

She teased her hair until the strands crackled like plastic. Then teased it more. She layered blush until her cheeks burned hot and bright. She blended blue shadow all the way to her brow bone. Then packed pink on top.

Her eyes were jaundiced from lack of sleep. Her lips were chapped from constant reapplication. Her hand shook every time she reached for something.

But her smile — the Becky smile — stayed frozen and strained, exactly like the picture.

The nightgown felt like part of her skin, stained with makeup fingerprints and stretched tight across her body. She hadn’t taken it off. In her mind, it was elegant. Transformative. Almost holy.

In the mirror, her reflection fractured. Between taped magazine pages and yearbook photos — glossy models arched in high heels, Becky’s smile caught in the glass beside her own.

The invitation slipped from her hand and drifted under the bed.

Jenny bent stiffly to reach it. The nightgown pulled tight across her hips, seams tugging as she lowered herself into a crouch.

Her fingers closed around the edge of the invitation, her knuckles lightly brushing against something beside it.

She pulled out an old shoebox, the invitation still pinched between her fingers.

Inside was a pair of church heels.

Faded yellow. Softened leather. Creases split at the toes.

The straps strained as she fastened them, flesh pressing through the opening.

The pain was immediate, sharp, and blooming.

She straightened and faced the mirror again — from the models, to Becky’s photo, to her own reflection.

Jenny stood in Mrs. Grein’s living room, her heels biting when she shifted her weight.

Mrs. Grein’s gaze moved over her without urgency.

She paused and picked up an old camera.

“Your smile is lovely, dear.”

The flash burst bright, filling the room for a single white-hot moment.

Mrs. Grein lowered the camera. Her smile lingered, soft and automatic.

“You’ve found your look.”

She opened the door, watching as Jenny stepped out into the hallway, her eyes fixed on a vague point past the doorway, unfocused, dreamy.

Jenny climbed the bus steps, gripping the rail.

The driver gave her a quick up-down glance — polite smile, empathetic eyes — before turning away.

A few riders shifted in their seats as she passed.

A small gasp near the middle.  
A muffled snicker toward the back.  
Someone whispered, “Oh… wow…” under their breath.

Jenny stared out the window, watching her reflection shift in the glass. Her fingers lifted to her hair, checking its place, then fell back to her lap.

The bus rattled and swayed. Each bump tugged at her balance, but she held herself upright, shoulders set, chin level.

Bell View High came into view — balloons tied to a folding table, music leaking into the warm air, cars lined along the curb. People moved toward the entrance laughing, bright in neon and denim and glitter.

Her heels tapped in uneven rhythm across the concrete. The gym doors stood open behind the table where a woman sat with a clipboard.

“Name?”

“J–Jenny P–purtle.”

The woman’s eyes stayed on the page.

“You’re not on the list. It’s fifty dollars to enter.”

Jenny set the invitation on the table. Damp. Wrinkled.

The woman looked up.

Her expression shifted — just enough to register — then settled again.

“You didn’t RSVP.”

Jenny tried to pass her.

“Ma’am!” The woman yelled, clipboard remaining between them.

“What’s going on?”

A voice came from nearby, unhurried.

The woman turned her head slightly.

“Mr. Donahew, she didn’t RSVP!”

Jake looked from the clipboard to Jenny.

He reached into his wallet and placed a fifty into the tin.

“That should take care of it.”

The woman exhaled and reached for a wristband. She tore it free and handed it over.

Jake took it.

“Let’s get this on you,” he said, smiling easily.

The paper band barely closed around Jenny’s wrist. He pressed it flat anyway. The edge bit into her skin. She didn’t flinch. She didn’t look down.

“Good to see you, Jennifer,” he said.  
“I hope you have a great night.”

He stepped back toward the doors and was gone.

The band tightened as her hand relaxed.

She smoothed her dress and lifted her chin.

Jake paid.  
Jake remembered.  
Jake wanted her inside.

Neon bled across the room.  
Jenny stayed close to the wall, letting bodies pass.

She looked for her.  
She looked for him.

Faces moved by.  
Glasses clinked.

Jenny ducked into the bathroom and stood at the sink, checking the damage without fixing it, smoothing the nightgown and pressing her hair back into something that would stay.

When she stepped out, Becky was at the bar with a cluster of friends pressed close enough to count as one body. 

Someone slid a glass into her hand. She tipped it back, clean and practiced, her head tilting just far enough before the glass came down again.

 Another appeared almost immediately.

Laughter moved around her in waves, rising as she wiped her mouth with the back of her hand, settling as she leaned into someone’s shoulder. 

 Arms wrapped her waist. A hand found her elbow. The space around her tightened and loosened again, adjusting to her movements.

Jenny watched long enough for the motion to slow, for each small action to separate itself—the lift of the glass, the swallow, the brief pause before the next laugh.

Jenny made her way to the bar.

“S-shot.”

The first one went down hot and stayed there. The second resisted, rose, then settled. Her eyes watered. The room shifted slightly off its center. Heat moved across her face.

She stumbled toward Becky.

“Huh…hi…” she tried, but it came out soft, the word losing its shape on the way out.

“Did you see Brian? He grew up good. I don’t know why I even dumped him.”  
One of Becky’s friends swatted her arm.  
“You’re still the same, aren’t you, Beck?”

Jenny’s mouth moved before the sound did.  
“Beh—”

“And can you believe who he’s with now? Stacy. Stacy Turner. He definitely downgraded after I dumped him.”

Jenny held the Becky smile, trying to speak through lipstick-coated teeth.  
“Buh…Becky.”

Becky whipped back nearly colliding with the girl beside her. Her face twisted in disgust.

“What the— what the fuck IS that!?”

Jenny reached out.

Something surged inside her. Overflowing her stomach and rising through her esophagus like a tsunami.

A thick, chunky explosion splattered across Becky’s chest, down her dress, and onto the barstool. Hot, sour, and loud enough to cut through the music. The entire gymnasium went silent. 

Someone whispered, “Oh no…”

Someone else, “Dude—gross—”

And then a voice from the crowd:

**“YOOOO! Jenny Penny is WASTED!!”**

Laughter broke.  
Screams.  
Gags.

Becky shrieked, dragging her hands down the front of her dress, her face folding in on itself.

“You FREAK—”

Jake stepped in between them.

“Becky, stop—she didn’t mean—”

“Move, Jake!” Becky shoved him. “She ruined—”

Jake tried again.  
“Beck, seriously—she’s not—”

Becky’s hand snapped across his face.

**CRACK.**

Jake staggered back, stunned, colliding with Jenny.

Jenny folded forward as a growling sound rose from her stomach and out her mouth.

…

“Wha—what happened to her?” I asked, leaning into the aisle.

Pluto didn’t look up from the photograph in his hand.

“Who? Jenny? Her heart gave out.”

Pluto continued to study the photograph—the one of Jenny in the nightgown, hair teased, makeup cracked. Swollen feet.

He smoothed the crease with his thumb.

“Right after she… spazzed out on Becky.”

“Spazzed out?”

“Well… you know how reunions are. Old wounds. Old crushes. Old rivalries.”

He shrugged, tucking the photo into his coat.

“Sometimes people make a mess they can’t clean up.  
When Jenny came to, she saw the carnage.  
The screaming. The blood.”

“Did she… did she kill—”

Pluto’s smile sharpened.  
He looked out the window, as if admiring the endless dark.

“I’ll tell you this.”

“She earned her seat fair and square.”

1qlazxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1qlazxx/the_cigarette_case/,The Cigarette Case,"🇵🇱Gdańsk, Poland. The 90s.

Kazimierz found the cigarette case one morning on a bench as he walked his usual route through the park to the shipyard, where he worked as a painter. In the gloom, the ugly outlines of creaking cranes loomed, resembling sick birds, and the smell of dampness and rotting autumn leaves seemed to crawl directly into his soul, causing fits of melancholy.

Kazimierz looked around and, seeing no one nearby, picked up the case from the rain-soaked bench. It was silver, looked simple — without inscriptions or engravings. On the move, Kazimierz opened it and saw that it was full.

— O kurwa! — Kazimierz exclaimed with joy. — O kurwa! To dobrze!

He was genuinely happy about the find: his cigarettes had run out yesterday, and Kazimierz desperately wanted a smoke. He took out a filter cigarette with no markings, sniffed it, and, after making sure it was tobacco, lit it and took a greedy drag. His head swam, and with a sigh of relief, he exhaled the smoke, noting that the tobacco was excellent. Pleased, feeling as if on wings, Kazimierz hurried to the gate to make it to his shift on time.

The rusty wind beat against the walls of the smoking area when the crew came out for their afternoon break.

— Got a smoke, Kazimierz? — his partner Tadeusz asked, coughing terribly and spitting up yellow phlegm. — We’ll smoke mine tomorrow.

— Here, — Kazimierz said, opening the case and offering him a cigarette.

— Wow, good tobacco, — Tadeusz said, taking a drag, and again went into a fit of coughing, exhaling smoke.

— Kurwa mać, this painting work will be the end of me, I’ll cough up my lungs, — Tadeusz rasped glumly.

Kazimierz remained silent. He knew about the harm, but he continued to go to this job, as if chained, just like all the other laborers. He saw their thoughts on their faces in the morning and knew what they were thinking when they walked home from work.

The next morning, Kazimierz, as always, woke up earlier than anyone else and left while his son and wife were still asleep. Coffee and a cigarette on an empty stomach were his loyal morning friends. And, opening the case, he saw that it was full again.

— Matko Boska!, that can’t be! — Kazimierz exclaimed and began to carefully examine the case and the cigarettes. Nothing unusual. But he couldn’t believe his eyes and tore up one cigarette: it looked like tobacco, good tobacco, and the smell was right.

— Fine, — he said, snapping the case shut and finding no explanation for what had happened. He lit up, sipping his coffee, looking out the window, and thinking about the miracles that still happen in this world.

So several days passed, and every morning the case was full. Kazimierz, offering the foreman a cigarette in the morning, asked about Tadeusz.

— I called his wife, Agnieszka, last night, — the foreman replied. — She said he died. First, he started throwing up blood, and then he coughed up his lungs into the sink. The ambulance didn’t make it.

— Jezu Chryste… — Kazimierz whispered, his blood running cold, and stepped away. He understood that the case was the cause. The very one from which he had been handing out cigarettes left and right. “Who’s next?” — Kazimierz thought with horror. After smoking down to the filter and burning his fingers, he immediately lit the next one.

— Heard the news, Kazimierz? — the workers asked in the smoking area.

— What news? — he asked, growing cold inside.

— Waldek, our grinder, died. He choked on phlegm in his sleep. How did he manage that?..

Kazimierz shrugged indifferently and, without another word, went back to work.

Over the next few months, a series of accidents and fatal illnesses wiped out almost the entire old crew of their shift. Only Kazimierz and a few other guys who didn’t smoke were left. Just yesterday, after work, when Kazimierz offered a cigarette to a new guy, the man died in a crash, his head hitting the dash as his car swerved into oncoming traffic. The cause of the accident was a cigarette that had fallen onto the seat.

Maybe the cigarette case wasn’t forgotten or lost, but left there on purpose? Maybe someone before couldn’t bear the weight and got rid of it that way?

These thoughts swirled in Kazimierz’s head as he stood early in the morning in that same gloomy park at the familiar bench. He thought: it’s time to leave it, to throw it away for good, enough!

At the same time, he rationalized it to himself: now he was more careful — he only offered cigarettes from the case to random passersby. For his own, he had a regular pack.

— Tomorrow… I’ll throw it away tomorrow, — Kazimierz promised himself and hurried to work, knowing deep down that this “tomorrow” would never come.

That night, his son woke up, needing to use the toilet. Returning, he noticed the edge of the cigarette case sticking out of his father’s jacket pocket. Listening — everyone was asleep — he quietly and carefully pulled out two cigarettes for himself and a friend.

“Well, even if Dad notices, what’s he gonna do? Spank me?” — the boy thought.

And what else is missing or wrong with it?,"In a particularly dark night in winter a young man was playing games on his computer. 

The table top was filled with cups of coffee and soda. Along with a dozen or so takeout boxes. 

The young man was wearing dark headphones with red cuffs. 

"" On your back! "" The man yelled into the headphones. He furiously smashed the buttons of the keyboard. 

In the screen, the character he was playing moved to behind a tree and was peaking the surroundings. 

"" This game is mine"" The man said while grining, his forehead furrowed. 

Suddenly his character got headshoted from far away. 

"" F\*ck!!!!! Where the hell was that player!!! "" He yelled angrily while his expression turned ugly. 

Crack!

He suddenly unplugged his keyboard and threw it hard on the floor. Some of the keys broke and the keyboard itself cracked in two, making a loud crack sound. 

Screech! 

A harsh rasp echoed through the room as he pushed back from the desk. 

Thump! Thump! Thump! 

He continued to stomp the broken keyboard. 

As he stomped the sharp sound of stomping and rattles filled the room. 

The small pieces of of plastic and metal scattered as the keyboard become just a scrap of metal. 

The man continued to stomp his foot on the keyboard relentlessly. His hands clenched into fists and nails digging into his palm. 

Huff! Huff! Huff! 

After a minute of stomping non stop he finally stopped. He took huge breaths of the cold air in the room, as his ragged breathing slowly began to even out. his forehead was almost shiny with sweat. 

 

Thud! 

He sat back on his chair with a dhup.

"" I need some soda"" He grumbled softly while opening his phone. 

The phone showed the time was 1 am. He tried to order takeout but he saw the restaurant wasn't accepting deliveries. 

"" Damn! I have to go get it myself now! "" He grumbled in annoyance with his forehead furrowing deeper. 

He started blankly at the computer screen, which now said lost. He neither lashed out nor started another match. 

A moment later he got up from his chair once again. 

A screech echoed through the room as he got up from his chair. 

He turned off the computer without even closing the game Or powering off. 

He grabed a dark navy blue jacket that was hanging in the door. Couples with his casual black trousers he looked particularly sharp. 

He pocketed his phone in his right pocket as walked towards the front gate of his house. 

 

Tick! Tick! 

The car lights lit up after clicked the open button in his keys.

He opened the car door and got inside without any extra movements. 

The car roared to life as he slowly drove to the main gate. 

A security gas was sitting in a small guard post. 

The security guard noticed the bright lights coming from the car and immediately stood up. 

The guard quickly opened the large steel gate with metalic screech. After opening the gate the guard stepped aside, waiting for the car. 

The car slowly came to the main gate before stopping in front of the old guard. 

the man rolled down the window and looked at the guard. He spoke slowly and softly. 

"" Uncle Sam.  I'm going to the convince store, do you want something? "" 

As he spoke, white smoke came out because of the cold. 

Hearing the man, the guard shook his head. 

"" No no. My boy Adam. I don't need anything "" 

Adam frowned and his eyes narrowed. 

"" Cmon. Say it "" 

The guard shook his again. 

"" I'm serious I don't need anything. "" 

Adam starred at the old guard without moving. 

The guard sighed helplessly. 

"" Fine fine, grab me some cigarettes and a sandwich if you can"" 

Adam smiled. 

"" You should've said so earlier, old man"" 

He turned on his car and drove off in the road. 

Adam was driving in an empty road with the only light source being the cars headlights and the faint milky white glow of the moon. 

The mix of the bright yellow of the car light and moonlight created an ethereal palish yellow that followed the front of the car, wherever the headlights fell. 

As the car drove bit by bit, slowly the moonlight started to dim, and after driving for only 10 minutes the moonlight almost disappeared. 

Now the only light source remaining is the bright yellow headlights. 

As Adam drove, his eyes scanned the surroundings. 

It was pitch dark with the trees and rocks getting an even darker pitch of black. 

One could almost mistake them for dark figures if they didn't have a light. 

"" Maybe I overdid it "" Adam mumbled to himself while driving. 

"" But then again, the keyboard was pretty old and I already got a new one"" 

He grinned a little. 

"" Just an excuse to bring out the new stuff, I guess ""

Suddenly Adam saw smoke coming out of his cars engine. 

At first Adam panicked but quickly shook his head and slowly pulled up in the wide and empty road. 

He got off his car and came in the front to look at what's wrong with his car. 

He opened the cars Hood to find that the engines wires were burned to a crisp. 

The smell of the burned wires wafted into Adams nose before he raised his arm to cover his nose

Adam let out a deep sigh. 

"" I could try to fix it but I'm not sure I'll be successful ""

He looked around the empty road. 

"" No cars at this time either "" 

He closed the hood with a loud thud. 

He slowly walked and got inside his car. 

"" Well, at least the light is still on"" 

Adam took out his phone from his pocket. He opened it to find there's no signal. 

He tried to call the emergency number but still no answer. 

At this moment it seemed like the whole world was trying to isolate Adam. But Adam did not show even a hint of fear in his face. Only annoyence lay written across his face. 

Tap! Tap! Tap! 

He taped on steering wheel Rythematically. 

"" Well..... I guess I'm stranded here until the day comes. "" 

His taping become more rapid as thought. 

' well not like it's the worst situation I've been in. ' 

He suddenly stopped the taping. 

He leaned in the seat and adjusted the elevation to get more comfortable. 

"" Nighty night world"" . After saying that he closed his eyes while half laying, half sitting. 

Hours passed as he slept soundly. Without caring about the world outside. 

On the outside however, the night refused to pass. Still engulfed in the pitch black environment. 

But as time passed, slowly clear white fog started to surround the area of the car. 

However, even in this state Adam had not woken up. 

A few more hours later , Adams eyes started to twitch.

 A while later, he opened his eyes slowly. 

A faint tint of red can be noticed in his eyes, that appears when one is not well rested. 

He elevated his seat back to the original position. 

"" Ouch"" He grumbled while leaning in front to look through the window. 

He rubbed his back with his right hand as he glanced around him. 

"" What the..... "" He said in annoyance and with a faint surprise. 

He opened his car door with a click and got out. The cold wind him square in the face. 

Adam instinctively raised his left arm to cover his face while holding the car gate with the right one. 

Against the howling wind, Adam stood strong and firm. His left hand was clenched into a tight fist and the right hand was gripping the door as hard as it can, resulting in a faint crunch sound of metal. 

After the wind calmed down a bit, Adam peaked at the front. 

There a figure stood, covered in black cloak while holding a lantern with blueish purple flames. 

Adam got startled at first but slowly a thin smile appeared on his face. 

"" Old man sam..... Looks like you're not getting your sandwich anytime soon. ""

In the paper ‘Computing Machinery and Intelligence’ (1950), published in the journal *Mind*, Turing set out his objective: ‘to consider the question, “Can machines think?”’ In true human fashion, he immediately re-phrases the question, at some length, and eventually arrives at the ‘imitation game’, modelled on a drawing-room entertainment from before the internet, before television. The original game he has in mind involves a guesser in the hotseat who poses questions to a man (X) and a woman (Y), who are out of sight and hearing in a separate room. The guesser has to determine from their written answers which is the man and which the woman. X tries to mislead, and wins if the guesser is wrong; Y wins if the guesser is right. Try it, it’s fun.

In this context, the first question posed in Turing’s proposed test is less surprising than at first it seems: ‘Will X please tell me the length of his or her hair?’ Next, Turing asks, equally politely: ‘Please write me a sonnet on the subject of the Forth Bridge.’ Two questions in, and the contested boundary between human and machine thinking is already looking for answers in literature, in art. Turing’s 1950s version of X – the participant aiming to mislead – replies: ‘Count me out on this one. I never could write poetry.’ To imagine this answer, in the second phase of his game, Turing’s complicated brain is playing the role of a machine playing X, hidden from sight and typing its answers, pretending to be a man (who previously played the game pretending to be a woman). I know, but if the test were easy an air-fryer could pass it.

Turing isn’t suggesting that a machine can’t write poetry. In the convoluted logic of the imitation game, X calculates that in 1950 ordinary people didn’t write poetry, a commonsense assumption that every computer masquerading as human should know. Among other prejudices from the mid-20th century, Turing’s paper makes incautious references to race, religion and the Constitution of the United States. He likens the inability to see computers as sentient as equivalent to the ‘Moslem view that women have no souls’. Turing wades in: he doesn’t compute as we would now.

And neither do the future computers of 2026 that he was trying to envisage. Any of today’s large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT or Claude, can write an instant sonnet on the subject of the Forth Bridge. I typed in Turing’s test question, and Claude 4 threw up 14 lines of poetry including the abbreviated word ‘mathemat’cal’, for the scansion. The poem made sense, and was formally a sonnet, and appeared in seconds.

Whether or not this counts as thinking, Turing intuits that the frontier he’s marking out will be picketed by the arts. In his paper, he picks a fight with an eminent neuroscientist of the time, Sir Geoffrey Jefferson of the Royal Society, who believed that ‘Not until a machine can write a sonnet or compose a concerto because of thoughts and emotions felt, and not by the chance fall of symbols, could we agree that machine equals brain – that is, not only write it but know that it had written it.’ For Jefferson, addressing the Royal College of Surgeons in his 1949 Lister Oration, mechanising the efforts of the infinite monkeys on typewriters didn’t really count.

These days, in the arts, it’s harder to share Jefferson’s confidence. The advances made by AI prick at artistic vanity – the work of a human artist can’t be all that special if a machine can replicate the results almost instantly. That hurts. A great human artist, we’d like to believe, amplifies and defends the exceptionalist spirit of our species but, in an echo of the anxieties that haunted early photography, a demonised version of AI threatens to steal away our souls. Encroaching on the best of what we can do and make and be, machine art intrudes onto sacred territory. Creative artists are supposed to be special, inimitable.",1,1769221980.0,CATiim,0,1.0,False

1qlaoln,https://www.reddit.com/r/hingeapp/comments/1qlaoln/question_from_online_dating_newbie_about_making/,Question from online dating newbie about making date feel safe,"Context: I am M, she is F, both in 40s in Toronto.

Reason for asking: Because I’d like to know the opinions of other humans

So most of my romantic life has been the old fashioned kind where you met people through work or school or friends or whatever, rather than meeting up with strangers from the internet. But I have my first proper internet stranger date tomorrow, and I’m excited about it! She’s really cute and seems like a wonderful combo of nerdy & cool.

The only trouble: I’m starting to wonder if the date I planned would throw up danger flags. If it was someone who already kinda knew me, I wouldn’t be worried, but what does this woman know about me, really? Anyway, it’s a late morning 1h hike through an urban wooded ravine, ending at a farmer’s market. On a day that’s supposed to be extremely cold and snowy (so we’ll be even more isolated than we would have been on a normal day). We had planned it for last week, REALLY early, but she had to reschedule because of work. So we’re doing it tomorrow at a more reasonable hour (11am instead of 8am). I’m planning on bringing a thermos full of hot water, and two mini thermoses for hot drinks. I’d planned on packing a cute little vintage round stacking lunchbox filled with servings of hot chocolate mix, gourmet instant coffee, matcha, teas, etc., plus some snacks (loose tamari almonds). Now I’m thinking: isolated location with unsealed drinks and glasses and foods with a total stranger…

I don’t want to send her a text like what I’ve written here, explaining how dangerous our date is for her lol. I’d like to reassure her of what I already know — that I am 100% a net positive to her safety. Current thought is a text like the following:

“Hey Marsha - Looking forward to tomorrow! A friend told me that when she goes on dates with a new guy, she’ll sometimes text a friend with their info, share location, etc.. I can imagine that might feel awkward to ask for, so just in case you have a similar safety routine… My full name is Marty Fakename, I live in Fakehood, and work at the Fakeplace in Ersatz Hills :)”

Hopefully you’ve already figured out that I’d send her my \\\*real\\\* info, not the fakes ;)

But yeah, what do you think?

SPECIFIC, NOT BROAD QUESTION: Is the above quoted text a good strategy for making a person feel safer going on a first date with a stranger?

Particularly interested in straight women’s perspectives, who I suspect have to worry about their safety more than we men do? But also others: what do you do to help your dates feel safer meeting you?",1,1769221634.0,hingeapp,2,1.0,False
1qlaofc,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1qlaofc/breville_barista_pro_as_a_first_machine_500/,Breville Barista Pro as a First Machine? [$500],"Hi. I found a Breville Barista Pro for $500 at Marshalls and I bought it but haven’t opened it yet and looking for some advice.

My wife loves coffee but I’ll say it’s not for the intricacies of it, more the caffeine and she does want it to taste good.

I’ve had a long history of making her coffee most mornings for the last 15 years. I’ve used everything before - Aeropress, Pour over using a Chemex, Keurig (yuck), etc. - you make it and I’ve probably used it. She does always have it with some cream or light sugar. Her favorite creamer right now is a brown sugar oat creamer from Trdaer Joes. She likes some Starbucks drinks also - Flat White, Machiatto, Americano, Cortado.

I’ve never been a coffee drinker myself. Basically, the only thing I ever drink is a Starbucks Iced Brown Sugar Shaken Espresso. I could have 1 of those a day for the rest of my life but it’s the only thing I’ve ever found that I loved. I actually can make something very close to it at home using her Trader Joe’s creamer and a Chemex.

I do have a grinder, and a decent one for regular coffee but not for espresso (the Oxo burr grinder). Over the years I’ve used lots of different grinders, always burr, all other previous ones have been manual / by hand.

She mentioned that maybe we could try an espresso machine and I found a good price on this Breville Barista Pro but I haven’t opened it yet. I have fears that it’ll be a waste, will I be able to make her coffee that she will love using it every morning? Will I be able to make my 1 specific coffee that I love? Will it be a big fuss for not much payoff?

I’m needing advice on how many extra things / customization I should get for it or should I just open it and try it out the gate and look up on this /r advice for that specific machine or should I just return it and wait for us to have a higher budget?

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

1qlafba,https://www.reddit.com/r/DanmeiNovels/comments/1qlafba/seizing_dreams_why_im_really_excited_about_this/,Seizing Dreams: Why I'm really excited about this licensing announcement,"I'm so excited for everyone to read this novel! I'm honestly shook it took this long, because IMO it's one of Feitian's strongest works. 

Something I'm curious about, though - the original novel was uncensored and had a bit of pa pa pa (ofc lol, it's Feitian x), but the raws on JJWXC were fade to black for obvious reasons. I wonder which version 7seas will use? 

Anyway! I stumbled across my notes from when I finished reading this, and thought I'd articulate them into a review for anyone who might be curious about picking this up now that it's going to actually have a translation!!  

**Main Couple**

**Yu Hao** \- our soft and self-conscious MC! This novel is really just his coming-of-age story. Watching him grow into himself, learning to trust and learning to love, was one of the most beautiful things I've read in a long time.

**General**  \- the man of Yu Hao's dreams. He's a mysterious General who literally saves our MC at the beginning of the novel. His identity is revealed kind of early on, but I'm not going to spoil anything about that. 

*""To tell you the truth, I have always yearned for someone who would still stand before me after countless sunrises and find me once again.""*

**Relationship Dynamics** 

Yu Hao finds himself accidentally falling for his saviour, who is a straight guy with a bad temper. His ""General"" isn't perfect, but I think that's what's really beautiful about this story is that there's no expectations from either of them to be perfect.

It's a realllll slow burn like watching a closeted sweetie and a staunchly straight guy figure out what their connection means in real time. They fumble around for a while, and you will want to bang their heads together (affectionately) because literally everyone's figured it out except them. But when it finally clicks, it's soooo rewarding and sweet.

It was honestly like watching two of my best friends fall in love for the first time. 

*""Ah? I'm waiting for you?""*  
*""Oh, I'm waiting for you. Didn't you say that you had to mentally prepare yourself?""*  
*""I'm gay, what kind of mental preparation do I need...""*

**Plot**

When I was reading this, I genuinely pictured Feitian sitting in his living room with a cigarette in his hand, playing WoW. There were a few Freudian books scattered across the coffee table. Then, (still in my mind), he pauses mid raid and thinks, ""Hm... time to write something."" 

It's honestly jam-packed with psychological depth and dream analysis, but also has crazy fun fantasy themes. The dream aspects reminded me of this video game I played once called Ni no Kuni. In the game you would enter into dreams and ""fix problems"" that had a direct impact on the main storyline. 

In terms of world-building, this is probably my favourite of his novels!!

It all begins with our sweet baby Yu Hao on the verge of ending his life. From there, it explores how real-life traumas and fears manifest in our subconscious. Feitian honestly tackles dark and painful themes with such empathy and care! What I loved the most, though, was how this novel made me feel. 

Yes, there's dreamscapes and battle and cool stuff happening in the background, but there's soo many quiet moments that are just delicious. I can imagine that this would offer a real sense of comfort and recognition to readers who've felt isolated in their own struggles (especially those within the LGBTQIA+ community! x)

So all of this is sprinkled into a slice-of-life university setting that's rife with Feitians dry af humour. (again, something I love)

**My Overall Thoughts**

At the time I read this, I was trying to read less fantasy/cultivation and dip my toes into more modern-day settings. This was such a good transition novel for me because it had both! 

I was a bit unsure at first, because I wasn't sure if it would be *totally* my thing. But I gave it a shot and accidentally ended up reading for 9 hours straight. I couldn't stop. Nothing could tear me away from this.

I genuinely adore this novel. It's wild. It's sometimes a bit camp. It's deeply emotional. It somehow perfectly blends over-the-top fantasy dreamscapes with psychological depth. It didn't feel like I was reading a typical Danmei novel. It felt like something sooo much more. 

I have so much love for this, and can't wait for more people to read it! 

*""The words 'I trust you' have been said - this was the premise that all emotional bonds are formed upon, and it marked the beginning of someone's journey out of their darkness as they ventured towards the sun.""*",9,1769220924.0,DanmeiNovels,0,0.91,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

It claims to hold 60oz but doesn’t really once the center is filled with beans. 

I read that the most common ratio for cold brew concentrate is 1 (coffee) : 8 (water) so 60oz of water would be \~220g of ground coffee, which just doesn’t seem economic cause that’s almost a full standard 10oz bag of coffee. 

I’ve also tried a 1:14 ratio for cold brew that isn’t concentrate but it just tastes watered down. It’s smooth but just off. 

I’m assuming my limitation is this knock-off pitcher?

1qlabtw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Beingabetterperson/comments/1qlabtw/how_to_gain_real_power_the_sciencebacked_playbook/,How to Gain REAL Power: The Science-Backed Playbook Nobody Talks About,"ok so i've been studying power dynamics for the past year (books, podcasts, research papers, the whole thing) and honestly? we've got it completely backwards.

everyone's out here trying to look powerful. posting their wins on linkedin. talking louder in meetings. wearing expensive watches. and that's exactly why they'll never actually have it.

real power is invisible. the people with the most influence in any room are rarely the ones you'd expect. and after going down this rabbit hole, i realized most of us are playing a game we don't even understand the rules to.

here's what actually works:

**1. master the art of making others feel powerful**

this sounds counterintuitive but it's literally the most effective strategy. people who feel valued around you become unconsciously loyal to you.

the book ""[The 48 Laws of Power](https://www.amazon.com/48-Laws-Power-Robert-Greene/dp/0140280197)"" by Robert Greene breaks this down (yeah it's controversial, but it's based on 3000+ years of historical examples). greene shows how the most successful power players throughout history made themselves indispensable by making others look good. the ottoman sultans who lasted longest weren't the ones who demanded respect, they were the ones who elevated everyone around them.

in practice: ask thoughtful questions in meetings instead of dominating them. when someone shares an idea, build on it publicly and credit them. recommend people for opportunities. this creates a network of people who genuinely want to help you succeed.

**2. control information flow, not people**

power isn't about telling people what to do. it's about being the person who knows things first and connects the dots.

become the person who understands what's happening across different departments, friend groups, industries. this doesn't mean being a gossip, it means being genuinely curious and connecting with diverse people.

there's this concept from network science research called ""betweenness centrality"" which basically proves that the most influential people aren't those with the most connections, but those who bridge different groups. you become invaluable when you're the link between separate worlds.

practical move: have coffee with people outside your immediate circle. read widely. join communities that don't overlap. the ash app is actually solid for this (it's like a relationship and social dynamics coach) because it helps you understand different communication styles and emotional patterns across various personality types.

**3. develop ""negative capability""**

this term comes from the poet keats but it's incredibly relevant. it means being comfortable with uncertainty and not needing to have all the answers immediately.

people who rush to fill silence or always need to prove they're right? they're easy to manipulate. the powerful move is being okay with ""i don't know yet"" or just listening without reacting.

the podcast ""the knowledge project"" with shane parrish has an insane episode on this with former cia operatives. they talk about how real intelligence work is about patience and observation, not action. most people lose power by acting too quickly or revealing their position too early.

**4. make your dependencies invisible**

everyone needs things from other people. money, approval, opportunities, whatever. the difference is powerful people hide these needs.

never let someone know they're your only option. always have alternatives (or at least appear to). this isn't about being manipulative, it's about maintaining your negotiating position.

""[never split the difference](https://www.amazon.com/Never-Split-Difference-Negotiating-Depended/dp/0062407805)"" by chris voss (former fbi hostage negotiator, not some business guru) is genuinely the best book on this. voss explains how kidnappers have obvious power but actually negotiators gain the upper hand by controlling their own emotional reactions and creating the illusion of options. every technique is backed by real life or death scenarios.

key insight: powerful people can walk away. or at least make it seem like they can.

**5. shape the frame, not the content**

most people argue about what decision to make. powerful people control what options are even on the table.

if you're in a meeting and you want outcome x, don't argue for x. instead, structure the conversation so x appears as the obvious middle ground between two more extreme options. this is called the overton window in political science.

or ask the right questions that lead people to your conclusion on their own. ""have we considered how this affects...?"" is more powerful than ""i think we should...""

**6. build genuine competence (boring but crucial)**

here's the unsexy truth, you can't fake power long term without actual skills. empty charisma gets exposed eventually.

pick 2-3 areas and become legitimately excellent at them. when you're the person who can actually solve problems that others can't, you don't need to posture.

if you want a more structured way to build these skills without feeling like homework, [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) is worth checking out. It's an AI learning app built by Columbia grads and former Google experts that creates personalized audio content from books like the ones mentioned here, plus research papers and expert interviews on influence and power dynamics.

You set a specific goal, something like ""become more influential in professional settings without being pushy,"" and it builds an adaptive learning plan just for you. You can customize how deep you want to go, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with examples and context. The voice options are surprisingly addictive too, there's even a smoky, confident tone that fits this topic perfectly. Makes it way easier to actually absorb this stuff during your commute instead of just adding more books to your ""someday"" list.

the ""range"" book by david epstein makes a solid case that generalists with deep knowledge in a few areas (not specialists in one thing) are becoming more valuable. having diverse competencies that you can combine in unique ways gives you leverage that's hard to replicate.

**7. practice strategic vulnerability**

this is probably the most counterintuitive one. calculated honesty about struggles or uncertainties (not weaknesses that actually matter) makes you more trustworthy and relatable.

people instinctively distrust those who seem perfect. sharing a relevant struggle or admitting you're figuring something out creates connection. but this only works if you're selective about what you reveal.

brené brown's research on vulnerability shows it increases influence, but only when it's authentic and contextually appropriate. don't trauma dump in a job interview. do admit you're excited but slightly nervous about a new challenge.

**8. create systems, not moments**

one impressive thing doesn't create power. consistent small actions do.

set up routines that put you in the right rooms, expose you to the right information, build the right skills. automate your growth basically.

for me that looks like: weekly calls with people smarter than me in different fields. daily reading from carefully curated sources. monthly skill audits to see what's working. these systems compound over time.

the book ""atomic habits"" by james clear (sold 15 million copies, the guy clearly understands behavior change) shows how tiny consistent actions create identity shifts. when you become the type of person who does x regularly, the results follow naturally.

**9. manage energy, not time**

powerful people aren't busier, they're more selective about where their attention goes.

learn what drains you and what energizes you, then structure your life accordingly. say no to most things. this creates scarcity around your time which increases its perceived value.

also, rest isn't laziness. the most effective people i know are almost annoyingly good at recovery. they sleep properly, they take breaks, they know when to push and when to back off.

**10. play long term games**

probably the most important one. optimize for decades, not days.

that means sometimes taking the less impressive option that builds better skills. helping people when there's no immediate benefit. walking away from quick wins that damage reputation.

the people with lasting power are the ones who consistently show up, treat people well, and deliver on their word over years. that compounds into a reputation that opens doors without you knocking.

there's no shortcut here. but understanding these dynamics gives you a framework that most people never even consider. you're not trying to dominate anyone. you're becoming someone who others naturally want to work with, listen to, and support.

and honestly? that's actual power.",1,1769220669.0,Beingabetterperson,1,1.0,False

For the first half of my trip, I stayed at the Sotetsu Fresa Inn Nihombashi-Kayabacho. The hotel is a minute walk from the Kayabacho station. It was so easy to get onto the trains to head to Shibuya, Shinjuku, Ginza, Tsukiji Fish Market, and Tokyo Disneyland. It’s away from most tourist areas and closer to business areas so it’s a super quiet neighborhood. The room was a typical size for a Japanese hotel room. You can’t control the AC/heat so I did end up leaving the window open cause I liked it colder. They had many free hygienic amenities, which I appreciated. The included breakfast was decent. The coin laundry was easy to use and clean. I was able to wash and dry 5 days of clothes and it was 600 yen. Overall, I definitely recommend this area and hotel.

At the end of my trip, I stayed at the Hotel Villa Fontaine Otemachi. It was a 7 minute walk from the Kanda Station. It is across a 7/11, which was very convenient. I stayed in a double twin room and was pretty normal for a Japanese hotel room. You can add breakfast but it’s around 1,500 yen for some pastries and coffee. You’re able to control the AC/heat, which was helpful for me who likes the room cold. You need your room key to keep all lights and heat on and they don’t provide a proxy card to keep them on while you’re out of the room. When they come to clean your room, they do not make the bed but only pick up trash and change towels. Overall, I think I would skip this hotel location next time.

4. Ian: A shy anthropomorphic lop bunny. He's the leader, & he's very kind hearted. He's a pacifist through & through. He also knows magic, but he uses it for good. He also tries his best to be a good person, because he doesn't want to be seen as a villain. 

5. Blumeiel: Like Ian, he's an anthropomorphic lop bunny. He's a wannabe hero who starts out with cardboard armor & a cardboard sword. He acts brave, & is also quite confident. He tries his best when being a hero, & like Ian, tries his best.

1qla4ow,https://youtu.be/M4wLSz8kyvA?si=K9eWBslCotheIhb-,Coffee Bean Corral Addressed My Question About Temperature Targets on the SR800,"Didn't give me answer I was hoping for but still pointed me in a direction that could prove useful. 

TLDR: The SR800 and most home roasters will show wide variance of intake temperature making it useless for companies to provide temperature based profiles - even with probes installed. One machine can easily display 50° or more variance than other machines of the same model. :-(

However, I'm not quite ready to give up using temperature targets in combination with time, F/P settings, bean movement, smell and color changes. 

The partial answer, I hope, is logging. I preheat my ROOM to 65°. At least on 5 lbs of  washed seeds, first crack occurs around 460° on my temp monitor. Browning starts around 375 to 400. These targets probably won't work on your machine but by logging roasts I can get good approximates of critical events and an idea of when to push heat on MY machine. Also monitoring temp let's me know when ror is stalling.

I'm a complete noob so call me out if I'm still wrong on this approach. 

Regardless, I'm having fun and got 14 batches out of my first 15 that were very drinkable or even very good. I burned one when trying for a very dark roast. 

Thanks for all the help.

I’m not into the performative formal date vibe, the roster nonsense, or anything that feels like a game. I just want something slow, simple, and real.

I’m not really a big going-out person. I connect best with real conversation, consistent effort, and actually building something over time.

My ideal relationship is being each other’s person. Calling, texting, sharing every small detail we find interesting, sending random stuff throughout the day, and actually feeling close. Then spending time together watching movies and shows, playing video games, cooking something simple, coffee(I don’t even really like coffee lol) and walks, chill nights in, lowkey weekends. The simple stuff that makes feelings build naturally.

I’m drawn to the quieter homebody type: kind, loyal, low-drama, supportive, relationship-minded. If you want one person and you actually mean it, that’s exactly what I’m looking for too.

Some things about me:

\\\\- I’m a pilot (private pilot, going for my instrument rating), future airline pilot

\\\\- I absolutely love cars and I will go on for hours about random niche topics

\\\\- FC Barcelona fan and yes I have opinions

\\\\- Computer science at UMD

\\\\- I’m really ambiverted quiet at first, then I’ll yap about literally anything

In a relationship I value honesty, commitment, and loyalty. If you’re looking for something real and you want to build, we’ll probably click.

Looking for 18-22 only, from the US, Canada or the UK.

1ql9whu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ql9whu,Why I Never Forget What I Study Anymore?,"This tool solves the **two biggest problems** for 99% of students: **heavy memorization** and **lack of time**.

From one who really struggled with memorization and tried everything you can imagine—taking notes, summarizing, solving lots of questions— nothing worked for me in the long run except **one method**: **Spaced Repetition**.  
The idea is simple: you review each lesson at **specific, spaced intervals**.

A lot of people know about spaced repetition, but many don’t know **how to use it properly**.

Personally, I had no idea how to consistently review each lecture on its own over time—until I made something genius.

It’s a [notion template](https://lnk.ua/5V1oBo54d), and honestly, I’ve been using it since my first year. It helped me a lot with **memorization** and **time management**.

You can add every lecture you study into a table (each subject has its own table), and the system automatically tells you the **exact days** you should review it. After each review, you just check it off—this way, you’re almost guaranteed **never to forget** what you studied.

And it’s not just about memorization.

The template has a **clean, organized interface** that helps you manage your daily tasks and **track your progress**.  
Each subject has its own page where you can:

* Follow up on your reviews
* See what you’ve already studied
* Know what you still need to study

And of course, everything is **fully customizable**, so you can adjust it exactly the way you like.  
So, let’s imagine a simple day:

You start your day with a cup of coffee and open Notion.

1. First, you check what you need to review today and quickly start reviewing.
2. After finishing each review, you tick it off.
3. Then you look at your task list, add new tasks and lectures.
4. As you complete each task, you check it off as well.
5. Finally, once you finish a lecture, you add it to the table, so the system schedules your future review dates automatically.

That’s it—simple, organized, and effective.

I run a small dating event company called Akta - we host board game/coffee nights for singles who are tired of dating apps. We had an event last week and literally just got this message from an attendee:

""*I went on an actual date last night with one of the guys I was matched with at coffee and it was legit a 4.5 hour date. I don’t think we would’ve crossed paths otherwise and it is such a genuine connection with shared values and interests and we’ll definitely be going on another date.*""

So the events WORK, but I'm struggling with marketing. I have a christian board game night Wednesday at Bongo Java East and I have 7 guys registered but only 2 women. Which means terrible ratios and nobody has a good time.

I'm genuinely asking for advice:

1. Where do Christian singles in their 20s-30s actually hang out in Nashville? (Or where would be the best place to reach single people in general?)

2. Is there a better way to reach this demographic than Facebook ads (which aren't working)? 

3. Am I just fundamentally approaching this wrong?

I'm a real person (software engineer turned accidental dating event founder) trying to solve a problem I kept hearing from friends. If you have suggestions on how to not be terrible at marketing to this demographic, I'm all ears.

I’m a 36-year-old guy from New England, and like a lot of people here, I’ve never been in a relationship. It wasn’t for lack of trying — shyness, bad timing, and life just kept getting in the way. But I’ve been working on myself, opening up more socially, and I’m genuinely ready to connect with someone.

A bit about me:

Firstly I have some sort of fame, if thats what you call it. Ive been in the news in Boston and Matt Sheer a reporter social media covered it. I’m a huge nerd who loves conventions, gaming, and cosplay. It’s been an amazing community for me, and I’ve met some great friends through it. I cosplay characters like Eddie Munson from Stranger Things and Leon from Resident Evil. I stay active, take care of myself, and oddly enough, I’m freakishly lucky with raffles and giveaways (no clue why, but I’ll take it).

I’m looking for someone kind, patient, and down-to-earth. You don’t need to cosplay — just be someone who enjoys nerdy stuff or at least doesn’t mind it. I’m not expecting perfection; I just want a genuine connection with someone who understands what it’s like to navigate dating later than most.

If you’re local, maybe we could start with something simple like coffee. No pressure — just two people seeing if there’s a spark.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

My whole life I have lived in the bi/pan space and have been comfortable there. I’ve only dated men and long story short, I always got a wall where I wonder if I’m comphet and begin to really feel repulsed in the relationship. Blah blah I self sabotage blah blah repeat the cycle. Date a man, love life, hate life, break up. 

That’s the prelude. 

So before my current relationship, I was super close with a friend from highschool. Loved them (NB/F25) to death. We hung out all the time, went on picnics, went thrifting, smoked a lot of weed together. We did a lot of things together and mutually felt like we where very similar and fed off each others AudHD vibes. Now, they got married to their husband in 2023 and are happily married. I’ll be honest, there were occasions where I was invited into the bedroom and was blessed with their presence. But at the moment I was under the impression from myself that I would be able to do the no strings attached energy. Boy was I very wrong. I had always had a masssive crush/attraction towards them (NB25) and lived with it. But once it got intimate, so many things changed. I never brought up the feelings and it kind of ate at me. 

Now fast forward like 6 months, I meet a guy at my work and I can tell he is interested in me. Buys me coffee, compliments me, and I like it. We talk and decide to date and unconsciously I start to back away from (NB25) mainly because I feel I have no chance because of the whole married part of the equation. 

Another long story short, I fuck up amd have to cancel plans a few times because of social anxiety and the fact it hurts to be around them. So they end up unfriending me on every social platform and everything cuts off there. 

2 yrs later and I think about them everyday. Especially these past few months and I so desperately want to reach out but I’m so scared of the possible harsh words or kick back if I even think about being honest. I don’t have any friends where I live anymore and it’s really hard to make queer friends where I live. So I have nobody to talk to about it. I’m in a relationship with a man that is good to me and has helped me grow and mature but I don’t know if I am IN LOVE with him. I love him and care for him deeply but these past months I don’t feel the sexual attraction like I used to and at that, I don’t know if it was sexual attraction or the pleasure of having someone be attracted to me and want me. 

I dont know anymore and i feel like i am going crazy. Please give advice and tell me if i sound delusional or like an asshole in this situation. I genuinely can’t tell if I’m crazy in love or crazy. ",3,1769218981.0,latebloomerlesbians,5,1.0,False

I will leave some info from their website below detailing the event:

Caffeine Crawl comes back to San Diego, to kick off the 2026 season of Crawls. It will take place on the weekend of January 24th and 25th, and include close to 30 different local shops, roasters, and chocolate makers. This will be our 13th annual Caffeine Crawl in San Diego, and the state's longest running specialty coffee event. Caffeine Crawl has been a part of highlighting San Diego's local scene since 2014 - supporting and watching it grow.

This 8-route event will travel from many neighborhood and district pockets of the metro creating an enjoyable experience outside of exploring specialty drinks and chocolate. Caffeine Crawl San Diego is one of the most exciting coffee events in the country. Each stop on a route gives out a sample drink (or chocolate) alongside a demo or presentation/talk. The designated time at each stop is used for that experience, plus a few extra minutes for shopping and one-on-one questions with industry pros. Ticket holders travel via their own transportation, and each route has a team leader with them. 

There are a LOT of well respected shops participating this year. Grab your tickets fast!",2,1769218851.0,SanDiegoCoffeeBeans,0,1.0,False

# Discover the Delicate Brilliance of Light Roasted Coffee Beans

There's a certain magic to a light roast. It’s the subtle dance of aroma that unfurls as the hot water meets the grounds, the promise of a bright, nuanced cup that awakens the senses. For those who appreciate coffee’s inherent complexities, a light roast is where the true character of the bean shines through, unmasked by deeper roasting notes. It’s about clarity, a vibrant acidity, and a spectrum of delicate flavors waiting to be explored.

But not all light roasts are created equal. At Intelligentsia, our approach to light roasting is rooted in our legacy as **Direct Trade pioneers**. This means we cultivate long-term, equitable partnerships with farmers who grow exceptional coffee. We pay premium prices for beans that exhibit remarkable quality and distinct terroir, ensuring that every origin’s unique story is honored. This commitment is crucial for light roasts, where subtle origin characteristics are paramount.

What truly sets Intelligentsia apart is our dedication to freshness. We operate on a **Roast-to-Order** model. Your chosen coffee isn't sitting on a shelf; it’s roasted specifically for you and shipped immediately. This guarantees peak flavor, especially critical for the delicate profile of a light roast. You experience the coffee as the roaster intended, just days, not weeks, after it left the roaster.

Why choose Intelligentsia for your light roast journey?

I want to share my story.,"Hey y’all, I’m glad to find this community. I just need to vent. I think this is more than light girl talk so if this isn’t the right forum just delete.

Ever since I was 8 years old I was fascinated with women’s clothing. First it was just Keds sneakers then it became other clothes. I thought I was just really into women/females and the clothing stuff was just related to my heterosexuality (I know…). I also had a lot of shame about my behavior. I was raised super conservative and told not to have sex before marriage or you would go to hell. I desperately wanted to have sex because it was put on such a pedestal and I was going through puberty you know. I didn’t have a serious girlfriend until I met my (soon-to-be) ex wife when I was 25 years old.

By this time I’d spent years crossdressing in secret. I did not have any language for it. I didn’t know the word crossdresser. I thought it was just the weird freak thing wrong with me that would go away someday. I would try on my sister’s clothes, I would sneak into friend’s closets and try on shoes, etc. I’m sure some of you can relate.

Well I thought now that I was married and would have a sex life the clothing stuff would just go away. NOPE NOPE. I started wearing my wife’s clothing in secret. I started buying my wife a ton of shoes and clothes I liked for HER to wear. I didn’t realize how much I really wanted to wear the clothes too. This went on in secret for 6 years of the marriage.

Well I finally confessed this all to my wife last summer and at first she was supportive. She even gave her panties to wear, she offered to give me some of her old blouse’s, we wore matching Keds on a date etc. I thought I had a safe person who was embracing this very vulnerable part of me.

But then in Sept everything changed and she told me I looked RIDICULOUS and that she couldn’t be with me if I crossdressed. I was so shaken and confused because she had been supportive. Well a lot of other things about our marriage came out and how unhappy she was with me. My wife told me she was going to divorce me in October.

We are now in the midst of the legal divorce process and I am juts NUMB and so HURT. I feel like I was coming to terms with a part of myself and she left me in the cold.  
  
I desperately wish I had read more about coming out as it had dire consequences for me. I was NOT careful and thoughtful about who were safe people to tell. I regret telling my wife and even more so my family. I really should not have told my Mom and siblings. I don’t know why I did I just was so happy to be exploring this part of myself I thought people would understand. NO NO NO. They think I am super sick and need to be institutionalized for my “disorder.” Ugh. I told coworkers and more. I don’t know what the hell I was thinking.

I’m just looking for an online community to talk to while my life falls apart. I am sick over the loss of my marriage but my wife has been turning so cold to me I’m slowly breaking away. It’s so hard. And here I am just wanting to wear a pretty floral dress and read classic literature at a coffee shop!!!

I have a therapist, psychiatrist, a PCP, supportive church, etc but reddit communities can be special so here I am.

My fem name is Epica (pronounced Eh-Pih-kuh) . I did join Crossdresser Heaven today too! Also I got a new cute dress that I can only wear in our guest room with the door locked. I still live with my wife and kids but they don’t know I still crossdress.

I just want some people to talk to about my crossdressing who will understand. Thank you.",8,1769218377.0,Crossdressing_support,4,1.0,False

Should I worry?,"So, I (21F) have had two episodes where I had a hard time with desvenlafaxine. First one was when I first took it about 2 months ago – I took it (50mg) with my morning coffee and a prescribed antibiotic for a sinus infection, and had horrible anxiety where I was convinced something was wrong. My heart was pounding, my hands were sweating, my face was tingly, and so on.

At the time I spoke with a doctor that told me to hold off on it for a bit while I finished taking my antibiotics. I don't remember whether or not I mentioned having coffee that morning, but either way, not the psychiatrist who prescribed it to me or this doctor told me to avoid caffeine.

Then a couple of days ago I forgot to take desvenlafaxine for a couple of days, but took it on Wednesday morning. Then, at 5pm or so, I had a coffee with my mom and she didn't finish hers so I drank hers too before going to the gym. At the gym, I couldn't do much at all. I felt a kind of ""low blood pressure weakness"", where I wasn't dizzy or faint but something felt off. I felt breathless and anxious, my chest hurt a bit, and did pretty light exercises because of it. Then after the gym, my chest hurt a tiny bit, on and off, for the rest of the night. 

Ever since then I've gotten better, but my chest has hurt periodically – for example, I laughed a bunch just now and my chest hurt a bit. It doesn't hurt to breathe or talk or anything of the sort, but a bit of discomfort comes and goes. 

I've just read desvenlafaxine and caffeine together may be dangerous and cause seratonin syndrome, but this information wasn't given to me at all.

Am I okay with the symptoms I just gave? I'll stop with the coffee for sure for now on, but I'm worried for my health now.

TLDR; Everytime I begin taking desvenlafaxine it gives me bad physical symptoms for a little while, and now the persistent one is a bit of chest pain ever since I drank too much coffee on Wednesday, and now I'm worried for my health.",1,1769218197.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I’m not into the performative formal date vibe, the roster nonsense, or anything that feels like a game. I just want something slow, simple, and real.

I’m not really a big going-out person. I connect best with real conversation, consistent effort, and actually building something over time.

My ideal relationship is being each other’s person. Calling, texting, sharing every small detail we find interesting, sending random stuff throughout the day, and actually feeling close. Then spending time together watching movies and shows, playing video games, cooking something simple, coffee(I don’t even really like coffee lol) and walks, chill nights in, lowkey weekends. The simple stuff that makes feelings build naturally.

I’m drawn to the quieter homebody type: kind, loyal, low-drama, supportive, relationship-minded. If you want one person and you actually mean it, that’s exactly what I’m looking for too.

Some things about me:

\\- I’m a pilot (private pilot, going for my instrument rating), future airline pilot

\\- I absolutely love cars and I will go on for hours about random niche topics

\\- FC Barcelona fan and yes I have opinions

\\- Computer science at UMD

\\- I’m really ambiverted quiet at first, then I’ll yap about literally anything

In a relationship I value honesty, commitment, and loyalty. If you’re looking for something real and you want to build, we’ll probably click.

Even walking felt like I was about to die.

I went on Zoloft and it worked really well for about 2 years. The problem was the side effects: constant sleepiness, ED, zero energy, etc. I eventually came off it and felt okay for about 6 months… until I had another panic attack. And just like that, I spiraled again. I couldn’t work, couldn’t leave the house, and felt completely trapped.

My doctor suggested Wellbutrin. I started at 75 mg and eventually moved up to 150 mg XL (extended release) — and honestly, it’s been a godsend.

I haven’t had a full-blown panic attack since starting it. I still get anxiety here and there, but it’s very manageable.

I won’t sugarcoat it though — the first 2 months were brutal. I felt awful and honestly thought it was making things worse. I almost quit, but I didn’t want to go back on Zoloft, so I stuck it out. Around 3 months in, especially after switching to the 150 mg XL, I finally started noticing real improvement. Now I’m about 6 months in, and I can even drink coffee again (Vietnamese coffee too… and if you know, you know 😅).

This week really made me realize how much this medication has helped. I had 4 wisdom teeth and 1 molar removed, and I actually had a panic attack during the procedure — but instead of spiraling, I just let it pass… and it went away while the surgery was still happening. That would have been impossible for me before.

Yeah, the adrenaline hit hard afterward and I could barely walk for a bit — but the recovery from the panic attack was 2–3 hours, not 2 months like it used to be. Before, I wouldn’t leave my house for months, thought everything would kill me, and was afraid to eat. This time? I bounced back the same day.

So if you’re considering Wellbutrin — I’d say it’s worth a shot, especially if SSRIs helped but the side effects were too much.

Side effects I experienced:

	•	Early on: extreme sensitivity to caffeine

	•	Occasional nerve/muscle twitching

	•	Increased sex drive

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says to me.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf in my head.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat and loads up my bags.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I can manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and damage we do fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chucking it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will enquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf did not touch anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

1ql98ng,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoldenInuTokens/comments/1ql98ng/scroll_of_the_golden_inu_a_time_for_bravery/,🛡️ Scroll of the Golden Inu: A Time for Bravery Edition 🔥,"Inscribed in therapy sessions and bullet casings, where grief wears a badge and healing rides shotgun, the Golden Inu patrols the streets of Mexico—not to arrest, but to ritualize the sovereign absurdity of two broken men who find redemption in each other’s wreckage.

I. The Shrink and the Shotgun (Silverstein & Díaz)

Mariano Silverstein, a disgraced psychoanalyst sentenced to community service, is assigned to Officer Díaz—a brilliant but emotionally shattered cop unraveling after his wife’s betrayal. What begins as a mobile therapy session becomes a buddy-cop descent into corruption, grief, and unexpected brotherhood. The Golden Inu rides in the backseat of their patrol car, tail curled beside a half-eaten torta. It sees the sovereign tension of two men pretending not to bleed. The scroll begins not with justice—but with jagged healing.

II. The Case and the Conspiracy (The Van & the Vanishing)

Two ex-soldiers vanish. A stolen van. A staged accident. A trail of lies. As Silverstein and Díaz investigate, they stumble into a web of military corruption and a nuclear smuggling plot orchestrated by the National Intelligence Agency. The Golden Inu walks the perimeter of the safehouse, sensing the sacred rot beneath the uniforms. It does not flinch at the uranium. It listens for the truth buried in the silence. For this is not just a case—it is sovereign exposure.

III. The Breakdown and the Breakthrough (Dinner & Detonation)

When Silverstein invites Díaz to dinner, the emotional minefield explodes. Accusations fly. Guns are drawn. Secrets spill. But in the wreckage of their personal lives, something sacred emerges: a bond forged not in trust, but in shared unraveling. The Golden Inu curls between them in a dingy motel room, eyes reflecting the flicker of a broken TV and a half-hearted apology. It does not judge the mess. It honors the attempt. For this is not just friendship—it is sovereign co-survival.

Epilogue: The Badge That Became a Mirror

The Golden Inu does not enforce.  
It endures.  
It walks with the wounded, the watchers, the ones who show up anyway.  
And in its wake, it leaves relics:  
—A therapy notebook stained with coffee and blood.  
—A badge bent from a bullet.  
—A voicemail that ends with: “Gracias… for not leaving.”

This scroll is not about crimefighting. It is about the mythic labor of staying alive together.  ",1,1769217742.0,GoldenInuTokens,1,1.0,False

I’m philanthropic…no money….but I think of ways to help in the local community.  It makes me feel better about myself, makes me a better human.  I’ve come up with blankets for the homeless, getting feral cats spayed and neutered and meal delivery for those in need.  I just don’t actually do the things I think of.

I think of them, I feel more human, more connected.

I was having coffee with my buddy Jorge and I told him some of the ways I thought of helping in the community.  He said he saw a flyer for blanket collection and was really impressed I thought of it.  I don’t think I’ve ever felt better about myself.  That was my idea!
