I decided just to kinda ghost her. she texted me the next day asking if we were still on for coffee like she said nothing. i didn’t reply and over the next few days she started to notice this so she texted and asking what she did. i was immediately so mad because she knew what she said. She then proceeded to ask if it was what she said the other day.

Chapter 1

Being Lady Luck was exhausting. So I decided to reincarnate as a wealthy heiress.
However, my mom was cast out of a rich family for failing to give birth to a son.
My dad looked at her belly with disdain. ""Stop wasting your energy. You'll never have a son.""
Mom's face turned ashen. She muttered, ""No... I'll give you a son...""
I felt terrible for her. Right then, I made up my mind to help her earn 1.5 billion dollars to impress those heartless people.
***
My name is Meredith Hoffman. In my previous life, I was Lady Luck.
In this life, I just wanted to be a wealthy heiress, lounging around and enjoying myself.
I was reincarnated into Chelsea Terrell's womb.
And I was still female.
But my dad, Nathan Hoffman, a multibillionaire, wanted a son to carry on his legacy.
Right now, I was floating in warm amniotic fluid, listening to Mom's quiet, muffled sobs.
Across from her sat my grandma, Matilda Hoffman.
Matilda was holding a coffee cup, skimming off the foam slowly, like she had all the time in the world.
""Chelsea, what Nathan says goes for me, too,"" she said flatly.
""You need to abort this child.""
Mom stopped crying.
She lifted her head. Her eyes were red and puffy, her voice shaking.
""Matilda, the ultrasound can be wrong, right? What if... What if I'm carrying a son?""
Matilda slammed the coffee cup down on the table. The sound cracked through the room.
""No 'what ifs'.
""Lorelei is four months pregnant. The doctor checked and confirmed it's a boy.""
Lorelei Sutton was my dad's mistress.
Mom clutched her dress so tightly that her knuckles turned white.
""Just because she's having a son, I have to get rid of my unborn baby?""
A cold voice cut in from the doorway. ""Yes!""
It was Nathan.
He stepped in and stared down at my mom, his eyes holding no warmth.
""Chelsea, don't make things awkward for yourself,"" he said.
He pulled a document out of his suit pocket and tossed it onto the table.
""Sign it, and this villa plus 1.5 million dollars are yours. It's more than enough to ensure you live in comfort for the rest of your life.""
Mom's gaze locked on the document. The words ""Divorce Agreement"" burned into her eyes.
Her body swayed, and she almost collapsed.
1.5 million dollars.
To get rid of his wife, who was seven months pregnant with his child.
How generous of him.
Mom laughed bitterly. ""Nathan, this is your child, too.
""How could you be so heartless?""
Nathan frowned, clearly annoyed.
""I told you we needed a male heir.
""If you can't give birth to a son, you have to step aside.""
He sounded so self-righteous and arrogant.
Mom's heart lurched and leaped. A sharp, overwhelming pain seeped through the amniotic fluid, piercing me.
No. She couldn't stay so passive.
I focused all my will, sending a thought straight into her mind.
""Mom, don't cry.
""Agree to the divorce first. Just hold them off.""
Mom froze.
She looked around in shock.
""You can't see me. I'm in your belly.
""I'm your daughter, and I'm Lady Luck, here to help you.""
Her eyes widened in shock.
She instinctively placed a hand on her belly.
Matilda grew impatient with her silence.
""Chelsea, you have one day to think about it.
""If you haven't signed by this time tomorrow, you'll regret it.""
With that, she and Nathan turned away, not sparing my mom a single glance.
The door clicked shut.
Mom stood alone in the living room, frozen.
After a long silence, she spoke, her voice shaking. ""You... you were the one talking to me just now?""
""Yes. Mom, it's me,"" I replied.
""Don't be scared. I'm with you. No one can bully us.""
Mom's tears fell again. But this time, they held hope, not despair.
She wiped them away, picked up the divorce agreement on the table, and tore it to shreds.
She murmured, ""Think you can cast us aside with just 1.5 million dollars? Not a chance!""
""Mom, open your stock trading app,"" I told her.
""Do as I say—go all in on stock code 002594.""
This mental link left me a little drained.
Even though Mom was stunned, right then, she knew the advice from her unborn daughter was her only lifeline.
She poured her last 15,000 dollars into that stock.
After doing that, she collapsed onto the sofa, her palms clammy with sweat.
The next day, the stock market opened.
That stock soared unexpectedly.
The stock hit the daily limit once, then twice, and then three times in a row.
In just three days, 15,000 dollars turned into 30,000 dollars.
Chelsea stared at the number in her account, shaking with excitement.
For the first time, she truly felt my extraordinary power.
Chapter 2
This sum was far from enough.
Nathan soon found that Chelsea hadn't signed the divorce agreement.
He froze all her cards overnight, turning Chelsea from a pampered rich lady into a penniless castoff in the blink of an eye.
All she had left was the 30,000 dollars in her account.
""Baby, what can we do now?"" she asked, touching her belly, her voice hollow.
""Mom, don't panic,"" I said.
""This is just a starter.
""Real wealth demands bolder courage.""
Peering into the future drained me. I felt faint, but I fixed my next target on an overlooked field: virtual reality technology.
In this era, the tech was still in its infancy, dismissed by most.
Only a newly established company in this field, Dreamland Tech, clung to survival.
But I knew that in six months, virtual reality technology would explode.
Dreamland Tech's stock would soar hundreds of times over.
""Mom, find a way to invest every cent we have in a company called Dreamland Tech,"" I told her.
""But we only have 30,000 dollars. Will they even take it?""
""If it's not enough, try to get more.""
Chelsea bit her lip, making up her mind.
She opened her safe.
Inside lay all her jewelry, also her last shred of dignity.
She picked out the diamond set Nathan had given her on their wedding day, which she'd cherished most.
The pawnshop was bathed in dim yellow light.
With a magnifying glass in hand, the owner examined the diamond set closely.
""They're good pieces, but...""
He hesitated, his expression clouded with unease.
""Mrs. Hoffman, I can't take these.""
Chelsea's heart sank.
""Why?""
""Well... Mr. Hoffman had these custom-made specially. They carry his family's crest. I'm afraid accepting them will drag me into trouble.""
Chelsea's face instantly turned pale.
It meant Nathan had never let her have anything that truly belonged to her.
Even the gifts he'd given her were etched with his mark, making it impossible for her to sell them.
Just as despair washed over her, the pawnshop door was pushed open.
Nathan stepped in.
He glanced at the diamond sets on the counter, then at Chelsea's ashen face.
A mocking smile tugged at his lips.
""Well? Why are you in such a rush to sell your stuff?""
Chelsea clenched her fists so tight, her nails dug into her palms.
""Nathan, don't go too far.""
""Go too far?""
He laughed, like he'd heard something absurd.
""Chelsea, have you looked at yourself lately?
""You can't even bear a son. What right do you have to bargain with me?""
He picked up the diamond necklace, twirling it between his fingers.
""Do you really think you can live your comfortable life without my money?""
""Listen—without my family, you're nothing.""
His words cut like a knife, making Chelsea's chest ache.
Enough.
""Mom, don't beg him,"" I said coldly.
""We don't want a bastard's trash.
""Tell him we're not selling it. We're throwing out garbage.""
Chelsea's head snapped up.
Her eyes no longer held the weakness of begging. Instead, they blazed with a determination she'd never shown before.
She snatched the necklace from Nathan's hand, turned, and tossed it straight into the trash can beside her with no hesitation.
The movement was crisp and precise.
Nathan froze.
I caught a flash of shock in his eyes. It was not anger, but... a strange, fleeting waver.
The pawnshop owner gaped, too.
""Nathan, listen,"" Chelsea said.
Her voice wasn't loud, but every word landed like a hammer.
""I can live better without you.
""But you. You'll soon regret everything you've done today.
""Let's wait and see.""
With that, she squared her shoulders, turned on her heel, and walked out of the pawnshop neatly.
Chapter 3
Chelsea's pride only held out until she stepped out of the pawnshop.
The second Nathan was out of sight, she was totally discouraged.
""Baby, we don't even have a startup fund now,"" she said, her voice breaking.
""Mom, easy,"" I replied.
""Have you forgotten what Great-Grandpa left you?""
Chelsea's grandfather, Braxton Terrell, had once been an emerald magnate renowned across the region.
When he passed away, he'd left Chelsea a plain-looking piece of deep green emerald.
It had always been stowed away at the bottom of her jewelry box, carefully hidden by her.
""That emerald holds enormous value,"" I told her.
""Once you get it, I can recover some of my power.
""And besides... It's priceless.""
Chelsea's eyes lit up. She turned around at once and hurried back home, taking out the emerald from her jewelry box.
It was completely dark, dull, unremarkable, even a little rough.
She'd never liked it much as a kid.
""Mom, go to Sorith's tonight,"" I said.
""This emerald will be our stepping stone.""
Sorith's was the city's most exclusive private auction house.
Only the richest, most powerful people would be invited.
Chelsea had no invitation.
But she remembered that Marlon Compton, the owner of Sorith's, was Braxton's lifelong friend.
Braxton had come to Marlon's aid, bailing him out when his business stood on the brink of collapse, sparing him from catastrophe.
She picked up the phone and dialed Marlon's number tentatively.
To her surprise, Marlon offered to help without hesitation the second he heard it was her.
""Ms. Terrell, I've been waiting for your call,"" he said.
""I'll never forget Braxton's kindness. He always said you shared his spirit, and just hearing your voice, I know he was right.""
Chelsea hung up with a mix of relief and emotion.
She realized she had someone to turn to anyway.
She'd just let the Hoffman family's glow blind her for too long.
***
The auction hall was dazzling with luxury.
Dressed in a plain black dress with no makeup, Chelsea stood in stark contrast to the gem-adorned guests.
As soon as she sat down, she felt two hostile stares locked onto her: Nathan and Lorelei.
Lorelei clung to Nathan's arm, her belly slightly rounded.
When she saw Chelsea, pride and taunting flashed in her eyes.
""Hey, Chelsea,"" she cooed.
""Here all by yourself? Nate, she's pregnant. How could you let her wander around alone?""
Her words sounded concerned, but her face dripped with schadenfreude.
Nathan's expression was just as cold.
He'd never expected to run into Chelsea here.
""Who allowed you in?"" he snapped.
Chelsea ignored them entirely, walking straight to the front row and taking a seat, which was reserved just for her by the manager.
Nathan's face darkened instantly.
The auction started.
Item after item was brought out, sold for sky-high prices.
But Chelsea never lifted her paddle.
Finally, the last item was rolled out into view.
That was a raw imperial emerald.
The starting price was 800 thousand dollars.
""Mom, this is it,"" I told Chelsea.
""Endowed with spiritual power, this raw stone is a hundred times more precious than Great-Grandpa's emerald.
""We have to get it, no matter what.""
Chelsea took a deep breath and lifted her paddle.
""1 million dollars,"" she said.
Her voice sounded calm but clear, cutting through the hall.
Every head turned to her.
Nathan and Lorelei did the same, stunned.
""Is she out of her mind? How can she have so much money?"" Lorelei whispered.
Nathan said nothing, his deep eyes fixed on Chelsea.
A portly middle-aged man lifted his paddle next.
""1.2 million dollars.""
Chelsea didn't hesitate.
""1.3 million dollars.""
The price climbed fast, soon hitting 2.5 million dollars.
The middle-aged man hesitated, then set his paddle down.
The auctioneer was about to raise his hammer when Lorelei suddenly shot up her paddle.
""3 million dollars!"" she declared, glaring defiantly at Chelsea.
""Chelsea, I love this stone. You wouldn't take it from me, would you?""
Chelsea's face stayed blank.
""3.5 million dollars.""
""4.2 million dollars!"" Lorelei practically shouted.
Nathan frowned, grabbing her arm.
""Stop messing around.""
""Nate, I can't stand the way she's acting like she owns anything she wants!""
Lorelei wrenched her arm free, her gaze still locked on Chelsea.
She was sure Chelsea had no money left.
She just wanted to make Chelsea embarrass herself in front of everyone.
Murmurs spread through the hall.
Everyone assumed Chelsea was keeping up appearances, putting on a lavish show she couldn't afford.
Chelsea's palms were damp with sweat.
She indeed had no money left.
All her hope rested on me.
""Mom, don't be scared. Keep up,"" I told her.
Forcing this thought through left my vision spinning, but I had to hold on.
""He'll help us.""
I directed my focus to an unassuming corner at the back of the hall.
An elderly man in a tuxedo sat there quietly.
That was Marlon, Great-Grandpa's dear friend and the most renowned emerald merchant in America.
As if guided, Chelsea glanced in that direction.
She steeled her resolve and lifted her paddle again.
""5 million dollars.""
The hall erupted in murmurs.
Lorelei's face turned pale.
She'd never thought Chelsea would dare to keep up.
Five million dollars was way beyond the raw stone's estimated value.
Nathan's expression turned icy.
He saw this as Chelsea deliberately defying him.
He lifted his own paddle. ""5.2 million dollars.""
He wanted to remind Chelsea who held real power here.
Tension thickened in the air.
Every eye locked on Chelsea and Nathan.
What was once an auction had turned into a public display of a wealthy family's feud.
Even the auctioneer's forehead glistened with sweat.
""Mr. Hoffman bids 5.2 million dollars! Any higher offers?"" he called.
His gaze swung to Chelsea.
Chelsea's hand trembled slightly.
She knew this was her last stand.
""Mom, keep up. Marlon has prepared emergency funds for you. He'll lend it to you. Just do it!""
Chelsea closed her eyes. When she opened them, only resolve remained.
She raised the paddle.
""6...""
She barely got the first number out when a hand grabbed her wrist from behind.
The grip was so tight that Chelsea let out a pained gasp.
It was one of the Hoffman family's bodyguards.
Nathan stood up and marched toward her, his expression icy.
""Chelsea, there's a line to my patience,"" he said sharply.
""You want to humiliate yourself here just to spite me?
""Can you even afford the consequences?""
The bodyguard hauled her up from her seat, treating her like an object.
The surrounding guests turned their eyes toward them. A few wore expressions of sympathy, but most of them were waiting to watch a show unfold.
Lorelei stood beside Nathan, her face glowing with pride.
Chelsea's face drained of all color.
Humiliation washed over her, suffocating.
Just as the bodyguard was about to drag her out of the auction hall, an aged but powerful voice cut through the noise.
""Stop!""

1p5yq2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1p5yq2g/sweet_lands_review_how_sweet_it_is_or_is_it/,Sweet Lands Review: How sweet it is... or is it?,"With so many heavy euros released this year from SETI to Galactic Cruise to Speakeasy how does Sweet Lands stack up?

**Theme:** The theme of this game is basically a Hansel and Gretel meets Willy  Wonka. Essentially your building out candy cities connected by roads and populated with candy rabbits. Let’s be honest, you could have really slapped any theme on this game and the mechanics would still work. However, I will say I feel like the theme of this game was taylor-made for me. I mean honestly just look at the cute milk carton buildings and coffee shops. Need I say more?



https://preview.redd.it/744lxpydwa3g1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=00cafc493f98f3598691f9e40f049af65c3a4ec8

  
Mechanics: So what are you actually doing in this game? Well it’s a card drive, worker placement, tile laying, engine building, city building, game. I know that sounds like a lot and well, honestly it is. But for those with experience in playing heavy euro games, other than the card playing mechanic,  there’s really not much new here that I haven’t seen in other games. And honestly, I still find myself enamored with this game. Essentially on your turn you’re going to be either discarding 1 to 3 cards to put out a disc on one of the worker placement spots or paying the listed cost in gold on the card for its immediate benefit. If you pay the cost for the card most have an option to tuck it underneath your board by paying one crystal for a benefit later when you run that columns engine. Take Prince Peppermint below. I can either discard it to put out an action disc on one of the worker placement spots on the board or instead pay it’s cost of 16 gold to immediately put out two random tiles of my choice plus one addiontal blue tile if I have a card with the tiramisu sweets tag already played in my play area. It’s a higher cost card but ohhhhh tiles and for the cost of 1 diamond I can tuck this card below my orange column at the bottom of my board to later put out and additional random tile each time I run the engine for that column.



https://preview.redd.it/jp3xj5ggwa3g1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f07e35efa22c5a727d2c3c5b821f1b60c545736



So what actions can you do and what exactly are you doing in this game? Anything your heart desires from put out buildings on the map, making cities, (a city is formed when you have three different buildings adjacent to each other) laying out tiles, building roads or moving up any one of the 8 different tracks in the game. This game leaves you agonizing over the right sequencing to maximize the most out of each turn. Oh and I didn’t even mention the whole slew of free actions you can take at any point during your turn. Need a few more resources to pull off this amazing combo? No worries just discard one of your cards to gain any two resources for free. Now that’s a bargain.  Obviously there’s a whole lot more but you get the idea. So the question is, is it any fun while you’re doing all of this? Well that’s for you to judge but for me I can say unequivocally yes! Just look at this amazing board  of cities I made at the end of my last game.



https://preview.redd.it/052v14eiwa3g1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=5418e822d40a9ffef6089f5b4093b52b76e8234a



**Replay-ability:** There are 5 map boards. Each board you build on has a side A and a side be. Each side A is identical with all the B-sides asymmetrical.



https://preview.redd.it/a1mr3fsjwa3g1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=3dfe2b201626d2b2de7c696fb42c61910bf3e51e



There’s also 14, that’s right 14 asymmetrical characters you can play as all complete with their own player powers that warp the game in some way. Enjoy focusing on industry and moving up tracks? How about Biscuit Bastet? Once per round you can move up the industry track once for each city with a milk carton in it. Mmmmmm milk cartons! Or how about Jasmine Mei? See these skill tiles pictured below we’ve yet to talk about that you can get during the game? Well Jasmine Mei gets to take two instead of the normal one each time she gets that bonus. Needless to say there’s a ton of replay ability and varying strategies in this game.



https://preview.redd.it/zoyac0ylwa3g1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=28fa9a96d717844373d824f61b361dbdc69e0d41



**Setup:** There is a lot going on in this game and that means a lot of set up. How much set up? Well that all depends. Did you get an aftermarket organizer? If no then get ready to open a ton of bags and spend time sitting through all the components shoved into this box. Coming from a LaCerda fan who used to amazing built in organizers I will say that’s the biggest turn off with this game. If I’m paying this much for a game I really want a built in organizer. What I will say is the aftermarket one the guy on bgg made and posted for free is incredible. That being said if you have the organizer it does cut down a lot on the set up and I think is an absolute necessity if going to get this game specially if you value ease of getting games to the table. See pic of organized box with organizer below.



https://preview.redd.it/4jdyf2spwa3g1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=210c62fd6c8e7dcfab25d75cf0c32529dcd11cda



Lastly I will say that this is a massive table hog even more so than any of my LaCerda. The player boards are as big if not bigger than the main board for reference. This pic below shows a 1 player set up with dragon shield standard card sleeves for scale.



https://preview.redd.it/rzybbjwrwa3g1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=9366dca7c4235d89a4cbfbd031fd5c43833dc6f9



**Solo:** The solo mode is a pretty straight forward beat your own high score.  Each round you flip over two cards to see which action spaces get blocked and then you have to strategize from there. It works extremely well and even for someone who doesn’t typically like a beat your own score style solo with 14 different characters to choose from it makes for a ton of fun and a new puzzle every game.

**Final thoughts:** With the slight negatives being lack of built in insert and setup time this is still my game of the year. Instantly one of my favorite games of the last 4 or 5 years as well. For reference I’ve played Speakeasy and Galactic Cruise this year which are wildly different games but prefer Sweet Lands over either although still love Speakeasy. This game keeps me coming back for more and I’ve only begun to scratch the surface. As far as balance is concerned I've seen some threads stating some characters are better than others. For me it's still a little early to tell. For example Jamsine Mei is very strong and easy to play and do well with strategy wise upon one or two plays. Other characters take longer to get proficient with. My last game was the first with the character that gives a 1 iron discount when going to the space that lets you pay iron to move up the industry track. I went in thinking I'd have a much harder time clearing 250 points but ended up within 10 points of Jasmine Mei. I think the key is to lean into whatever you're characters good at and go from there.

1p5ylgh,https://www.reddit.com/r/soloboardgames/comments/1p5ylgh/sweetlands_reveiw_how_sweet_it_is_or_is_it/,Sweetlands Reveiw: How Sweet it is or is it?,"With so many heavy euros released this year from SETI to Galactic Cruise to Speakeasy how does Sweet Lands stack up? 



**Theme:** The theme of this game is basically a Hansel and Gretel meets Willy  Wonka. Essentially your building out candy cities connected by roads and populated with candy rabbits. Let’s be honest, you could have really slapped any theme on this game and the mechanics would still work. However, I will say I feel like the theme of this game was taylor-made for me. I mean honestly just look at the cute milk carton buildings and coffee shops. Need I say more? 

https://preview.redd.it/c7zze5j9va3g1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ed5415a100424275a078ff191fcc85cbd0ac65a



Mechanics: So what are you actually doing in this game? Well it’s a card drive, worker placement, tile laying, engine building, city building, game. I know that sounds like a lot and well, honestly it is. But for those with experience in playing heavy euro games, other than the card playing mechanic,  there’s really not much new here that I haven’t seen in other games. And honestly, I still find myself enamored with this game. Essentially on your turn you’re going to be either discarding 1 to 3 cards to put out a disc on one of the worker placement spots or paying the listed cost in gold on the card for its immediate benefit. If you pay the cost for the card most have an option to tuck it underneath your board by paying one crystal for a benefit later when you run that columns engine. Take Prince Peppermint below. I can either discard it to put out an action disc on one of the worker placement spots on the board or instead pay it’s cost of 16 gold to immediately put out two random tiles of my choice plus one addiontal blue tile if I have a card with the tiramisu sweets tag already played in my play area. It’s a higher cost card but ohhhhh tiles and for the cost of 1 diamond I can tuck this card below my orange column at the bottom of my board to later put out and additional random tile each time I run the engine for that column.  

https://preview.redd.it/d76khgobva3g1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa339aa48c26f56aa924a95a7dd00498294c6966



So what actions can you do and what exactly are you doing in this game? Anything your heart desires from put out buildings on the map, making cities, (a city is formed when you have three different buildings adjacent to each other) laying out tiles, building roads or moving up any one of the 8 different tracks in the game. This game leaves you agonizing over the right sequencing to maximize the most out of each turn. Oh and I didn’t even mention the whole slew of free actions you can take at any point during your turn. Need a few more resources to pull off this amazing combo? No worries just discard one of your cards to gain any two resources for free. Now that’s a bargain.  Obviously there’s a whole lot more but you get the idea. So the question is, is it any fun while you’re doing all of this? Well that’s for you to judge but for me I can say unequivocally yes! Just look at this amazing board  of cities I made at the end of my last game. 

https://preview.redd.it/rwzogmzdva3g1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=51e2a48ee6276d49b12d26f1a71987437d3685b8



**Replay-ability:** There are 5 map boards. Each board you build on has a side A and a side be. Each side A is identical with all the B-sides asymmetrical. 

https://preview.redd.it/2e8sg5umva3g1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5c58d06b1d84a185d6e12ce40258968a775aef0



There’s also 14, that’s right 14 asymmetrical characters you can play as all complete with their own player powers that warp the game in some way. Enjoy focusing on industry and moving up tracks? How about Biscuit Bastet? Once per round you can move up the industry track once for each city with a milk carton in it. Mmmmmm milk cartons! Or how about Jasmine Mei? See these skill tiles pictured below we’ve yet to talk about that you can get during the game? Well Jasmine Mei gets to take two instead of the normal one each time she gets that bonus. Needless to say there’s a ton of replay ability and varying strategies in this game. 

https://preview.redd.it/7db4s0onva3g1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=9303b3c4080066e94d4e6280777a71116443b62d



**Setup:** There is a lot going on in this game and that means a lot of set up. How much set up? Well that all depends. Did you get an aftermarket organizer? If no then get ready to open a ton of bags and spend time sitting through all the components shoved into this box. Coming from a LaCerda fan who used to amazing built in organizers I will say that’s the biggest turn off with this game. If I’m paying this much for a game I really want a built in organizer. What I will say is the aftermarket one the guy on bgg made and posted for free is incredible. That being said if you have the organizer it does cut down a lot on the set up and I think is an absolute necessity if going to get this game specially if you value ease of getting games to the table. See pic of organized box with organizer below. 

https://preview.redd.it/6ro3flkova3g1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=726f0dd58eabd3a039d01828f648b8d7071a3051



 Lastly I will say that this is a massive table hog even more so than any of my LaCerda. The player boards are as big if not bigger than the main board for reference. This pic below shows a 1 player set up with dragon shield standard card sleeves for scale.

https://preview.redd.it/l5y9ddkqva3g1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae4b6a1da4d5f1f40db4b33db54d558af2c1de13



**Solo:** The solo mode is a pretty straight forward beat your own high score.  Each round you flip over two cards to see which action spaces get blocked and then you have to strategize from there. It works extremely well and even for someone who doesn’t typically like a beat your own score style solo with 14 different characters to choose from it makes for a ton of fun and a new puzzle every game. 



**Final thoughts:** With the slight negatives being lack of built in insert and setup time this is still my game of the year. Instantly one of my favorite games of the last 4 or 5 years as well. For reference I’ve played Speakeasy and Galactic Cruise this year which are wildly different games but prefer Sweet Lands over either although still love Speakeasy. This game keeps me coming back for more and I’ve only begun to scratch the surface. As far as balance is concerned I've seen some threads stating some characters are better than others. For me it's still a little early to tell. For example Jamsine Mei is very strong and easy to play and do well with strategy wise upon one or two plays. Other characters take longer to get proficient with. My last game was the first with the character that gives a 1 iron discount when going to the space that lets you pay iron to move up the industry track. I went in thinking I'd have a much harder time clearing 250 points but ended up within 10 points of Jasmine Mei. I think the key is to lean into whatever you're characters good at and go from there.

1p5ygi4,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1p5ygi4/31m_28f_found_confusing_texts_on_my_girlfriends/,"(31M / 28F) Found confusing texts on my girlfriend’s phone. I'm trying to move forward, but stuck. Need perspective.","I (31M) have been dating my girlfriend (28F) since May. Lets call her Jess. Things have been really good recently — genuinely loving, consistent, and committed from both of us. But there’s been a lingering trust issue that blew up a few weeks ago, and I can’t seem to get past it.

**Early context:**  
When we first started dating, she was slower to commit and it came out that she had gone on dates/seen another guy at the same time. We weren’t even close exclusive then (I found out before our second date), so it wasn’t “wrong,” but it planted doubt. There were also a few small things over the months that made me question transparency:

\- Confusing interactions with male friends (I bumped into her walking with a guy one Saturday am, and I called her out on it after the fact. This was only after a few dates. And she told me it was her friend that was visiting from out of town. She told me in advance that she had friends - guy friends included - visiting that weekend. Turns out they were just walking back from breakfast, but I am still weary.

\- Jess just moved to my city and I saw she followed a mutual friend of mine on IG - we'll call her Sarah. I asked Sarah how she knew Jess. Sarah worked w Jess' ex - lets call him Bob. Bob, now just friends, said Jess is moving to Sarah's city and that they should meet up. No biggie. I actually ended up meeting Bob who was super nice. A few days later, I'm at coffee w Jess and jokingly said I can't believe you date Bob. She was perplexed and said she never did. So now idk what the truth is.

To give her credit: she’s a social, friendly person with a big network, and a good chunk of this might have been my own anxious mind filling in blanks. She’s never been sneaky, she never hid that she had male friends, and she genuinely tries to make me feel included. It wasn’t like she was juggling secret relationships or anything like that.

Still, these little moments built up a baseline of insecurity for me. Not because she was doing something terrible, but because the combination of her being slower to commit + a few mildly confusing moments early on put me on edge.

**The incident:**  
One night recently, she handed me her phone to hold at a party. I’d been drinking, my anxiety took over, and I checked it. I immediately felt guilty about that — it’s not something I do.

But I found a text thread with a guy named Steve that I had never heard about. The messages weren’t sexual or flirty based on what I saw, but some were emotional and personal — the kind of deeper, somewhat frequent connection I thought was mostly happening between her and me. There were some photos sent back and forth (seemingly old photos from years ago), inside-jokey stuff, screenshots about stocks, and two long emotional texts where she seemed upset about something. The details are fuzzy because I panicked and was drinking, but it made me uncomfortable.

She says they met years ago, made out once, became friends, traveled in the same group, and haven’t seen each other in over a year. She says he has a girlfriend and lives in another state now. She insists their relationship is platonic and that she confided in him during her stressful adjustment to her new city.

**Where things broke down:**  
I confronted her immediately — badly. I was drunk, said things I regret, and demanded to see the full thread. She refused, said it violated her boundaries, and insisted I trust her word. This turned into hours of fighting, ultimatums, crying, and going in circles.

The next morning, sober, she still wouldn’t show the messages. I eventually backed down and told her I’d try to move forward without full clarity.

Since then, she has been incredibly loving — really showing up for the relationship. But I still can’t shake the doubt. Especially because:

* I can’t find *any trace* of this guy online. Looked up his first and last name. Nada. Bob is, according to her, in sales. Most of those guys have a LinkedIn at minimum.
* She won’t give his number or any verification of who he is.
* She says providing that crosses her boundaries.
* Her story might be 100% true, but I genuinely don’t know.

Now I’m torn between two feelings:

1. **She’s all in**, and has been nothing but caring, thoughtful, and consistent since. And frankly was before the incident as well.
2. **I still feel like I have a half-truth**, and it’s hard to fully relax or trust without more clarity.

She knows I’m struggling, but whenever I bring it up it overwhelms her because she feels like she’s doing everything she can other than giving up her boundaries.

I don’t want to become controlling or paranoid. But I also don’t want to ignore my gut. I’m stuck in this loop of doubt and resentment, even though I want the relationship to work.

**What I’m asking Reddit:**

* How does this look from the outside?
* Does her behavior seem like harmless past friendship / bad communication… or something more concerning?
* Is it fair for me to want some kind of verification?
* Or do I need to accept her boundaries fully and decide if I can trust her without more information?
* Any advice on how to move forward in a healthy way?

  
TLDR: My girlfriend and I are great together *day-to-day*, but there’s lingering trust damage from early dating. A month ago, I went through her phone and she was casually talking to another guy. The texts were not objectively romantic but did not seem 100% platonic either. The strangest part was I couldn’t confirm the guy exists — when I looked up his name, no online footprint, and she won’t provide me any proof of his existence, saying it crosses her boundaries. I think she gave the contact a fake name. Everything else in our relationship feels loving, stable, and committed, but my brain keeps looping back to this missing clarity. I’m struggling between wanting reassurance and not wanting to push her away or pressure her. Not sure how to move forward without clarity, but also not sure if my anxiety is driving this more than logic.",1,1764031319.0,relationships,2,1.0,False
1p5yg6k,https://www.reddit.com/r/greensburg/comments/1p5yg6k/greensburg_can_you_spare_an_hour_this_black/,"Greensburg, can you spare an hour this Black Friday to save lives in memory of my son?","Hello local friends. I know that Black Friday is usually about deals and chaos, but I'm hoping that some of you might trade an hour of shopping for something that genuinely saves lives - donating blood. My baby son Juno passed away in February 2023 from a rare cancer. Blood donations were vital during his treatment and I will always be grateful for the strangers whose blood products gave us valuable time with him. Now I run a small nonprofit in his memory, Juno's Rockets, and we are hosting a blood drive this Friday, November 28 from 10 am- 3pm at Holy Family Church in Latrobe (on Ligonier St).

I'm in treatment myself for Stage IV breast cancer (yeah, our family has had rotten luck the last few years...), so while I can't donate blood myself, coordinating this drive is one of the most meaningful ways that I can give back. Blood products drop dangerously low around the holidays in particular and they are absolutely critical for cancer patients, especially kids at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, where Juno was treated.

So, if you don't have any Black Friday plans, or can spare an hour of your day, please consider donating. Doing this in my baby's memory would mean the world to my family! Thank you for reading and considering <3

I’m a 36-year-old guy from New England, and like a lot of people here, I’ve never been in a relationship. It wasn’t for lack of trying — shyness, bad timing, and life just kept getting in the way. But I’ve been working on myself, opening up more socially, and I’m genuinely ready to connect with someone.

A bit about me:
Firstly I have some sort of fame, if thats what you call it. I made a dating site promoting my singleness DatingKen.com which caught news in Boston and Matt Sheer a reporter social media. I’m a huge nerd who loves conventions, gaming, and cosplay. It’s been an amazing community for me, and I’ve met some great friends through it. I cosplay characters like Eddie Munson from Stranger Things and Leon from Resident Evil. I stay active, take care of myself, and oddly enough, I’m freakishly lucky with raffles and giveaways (no clue why, but I’ll take it).

I’m looking for someone kind, patient, and down-to-earth. You don’t need to cosplay — just be someone who enjoys nerdy stuff or at least doesn’t mind it. I’m not expecting perfection; I just want a genuine connection with someone who understands what it’s like to navigate dating later than most.

If you’re local, maybe we could start with something simple like coffee. No pressure — just two people seeing if there’s a spark.

1p5yfea,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskJapanLocalGuides/comments/1p5yfea/winter_traditions_in_osaka_that_most_travelers/,Winter Traditions in Osaka That Most Travelers Never Hear About,"  
Osaka-based wanderer *Kei* here from Magicaltrip — I pulled together a **locals-only winter guide** with just three events.

# Winter Things Locals Actually Do in Osaka

#  1. Tondo Fire Ritual at [Shitennoji Temple](https://www.google.co.jp/maps/search/%E5%92%8C%E5%AE%97%E7%B7%8F%E6%9C%AC%E5%B1%B1+%E5%9B%9B%E5%A4%A9%E7%8E%8B%E5%AF%BA/@34.6553556,135.5133944,17z/data=!3m1!4b1?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MTExNy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D&hl=en)

On January 14th, Shitennoji holds its own tondo — a traditional burning of New Year decorations right by the Niomon Gate. There aren’t big signs or tourist crowds, just the steady crackle of the fire, the scent of pine and smoke, and locals lining up to offer their shimenawa and ornaments. It feels quietly powerful, one of those winter rituals you’d never stumble upon unless someone told you.

# 2. [Imamiya Ebisu](https://www.imamiya-ebisu.jp/english) (Ebessan) — But the Local Way

Most visitors only see the main hall, take a photo, and leave. Locals? We dive into the backstreets full of old-school food stalls: deep-fried skewers, baby castella, Takoyaki with way too much sauce. The chant *“Shobai hanjo de sasa motte koi!”* echoes everywhere, and the vibe is pure Osaka energy.

# 3. Winter Sento Nights

Cold evenings are perfect for hopping into a neighborhood sento, and places like [Naniwa-no-Yu](https://www.google.co.jp/maps/place/Tennen+Onsen+Naniwanoyu/@34.7150129,135.5109827,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x6000e6bae2555555:0x56940f502cc9a841!8m2!3d34.7150085!4d135.5135576!16s%2Fg%2F11c555dsy4?hl=en&entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MTExNy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) or [Asahi Onsen](https://www.google.co.jp/maps/search/Asahi+Onsen/@34.6065568,135.3591979,12z?hl=en&entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MTExNy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) make it easy for travelers. Naniwa-no-Yu has a surprisingly open rooftop rotenburo overlooking the city, while Asahi Onsen keeps that old-school vibe with herb baths and retro tile murals. People chat about nothing, steam rolls out the entrance, and you walk out glowing and ready for a cold beer or a vending-machine milk coffee.

As i get older and older, i have less and less friends. Most of the people i used to hangout with online are the same age as me, and now have kids/spouses and in general a lot more going on in life then me. So i'm mostly just hanging out with myself! Which kinda sucks, tbh. So i'm just on the lookout for anyone that values spending time together, online. I miss sitting in calls, talking about whatever, watching stuff together on either discord screenshare, or plex. And just playing games in general. I have a ton of games, and i would love to play more. I'm not gonnas list any games since that's not the purpose of this post. This post is more to find someone that i can vibe with, someone i get along with. But it would be very good if you  played games.

But i'm gonna list some favorites of different kinds, so you somewhat get a feel for who i am?

* The movie Oldboy, been my favorite since it came out, so good.
* Bread. I do love bread, any type of bread tbh, it's not good for you but could easily live on it.
* Pepsi Max/Water/Coffee. I almost exclusively drink these 3 things.
* I do listen to a lot of music, but it's hard to describe? so heres my [last.fm](http://last.fm/user/zauron)
* Animals! An easy thing to love. I sadly don't have a cat anymore, but i'll adopt one soon again. I'm also very into Capybaras, they are amazing!
* Homelabbing. I have a \*erver which i tinker with a lot, running a bunch of services and just playing around with it, it's super fun!

That's some stuff atleast. I'm also kinda introverted, and my energy fluctuate quite a bit, so if i don't respond, don't take it personal!

Oh, and i'm located in Sweden. But any TZ is fine really, my sleep scheduele is all over the place!

Hope to hear from you! take care :)",1,1764031171.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False
1p5ye4s,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1p5ye4s/any_actions_to_do_from_friendzone_to_lovers_30f30m/,any actions to do from friendzone to lovers ? (30f/30m),"I am (30F) in a group of friends of our late 20s/early 30s. 

There are 3 couples and me and 2 guys are single. I started to like this one guy more and more after a couple of months of being in the group (we all got friends just a year ago). 

I am a photographer, so he got a photoshoot from me around 7 months ago. I offered him to watch a movie at his place afterwards and we had a lovely day (he also bought us food in a restaurant). It was nice, but no romantic moments. 
Later I asked him to the museum and he said yes, tho he didn’t want to have a lunch together afterwards. 

I realised the coldness from him and tried to not push further, as back then he divorced less than a year ago. 

Closer to the summer I noticed that he wants to interact with me more - when we had some group discussions in the friends chat, he could go to my private messages to discuss something more. Sending reels/replying to my stories. 
Also it was always nice to talk to him during our friends gatherings, and on the way home. 

In september he had a birthday and I gave him a t-shirt specifically made for him with a quote he mentioned a few months before that. 

He also can message something after these friends gatherings to me. 

A few weeks ago he said we had a nice conversation during the friends gathering, and offered to meet up for coffee to discuss more. But then there was a trouble in the public transportation and he decided not to come to the city (we supposed to meet before the friends gathering and he didn’t come for both). And then I left for the vacation and got back and he didn’t get back to the idea of meeting up just for two of us. 

We share some interest, he seems very gentle and empathic, he’s very smart and intelligent. I really would love to be with someone like him. 
I understand his divorce story and therefore the coldness towards me, but some small interactions when he’s interested in me or we discuss something that’s interesting for both of us make me more and more attracted to him. 

Do you think it’s something that can develop (given that he’s initiating small talks and even offered to meet up for the first time a couple of weeks ago, but it was interrupted). 
Should I offer to meet up again? 
I also thought of just saying straightforward that I like him and ask if anything is possible from his side. 

We’re both immigrants in a foreign country and the connection with someone from your homeland that has a lot of similar values with you means a lot. 
I wanna go further with him, but I don’t know if he’s ready after his divorce, etc. 
I wonder if this can develop to love, or it’s a forever friend zone.

 - does anyone have link for this?","Chapter 1
Being Lady Luck was exhausting. So I decided to reincarnate as a wealthy heiress.
However, my mom was cast out of a rich family for failing to give birth to a son.
My dad looked at her belly with disdain. ""Stop wasting your energy. You'll never have a son.""
Mom's face turned ashen. She muttered, ""No... I'll give you a son...""
I felt terrible for her. Right then, I made up my mind to help her earn 1.5 billion dollars to impress those heartless people.
\*\*\*
My name is Meredith Hoffman. In my previous life, I was Lady Luck.
In this life, I just wanted to be a wealthy heiress, lounging around and enjoying myself.
I was reincarnated into Chelsea Terrell's womb.
And I was still female.
But my dad, Nathan Hoffman, a multibillionaire, wanted a son to carry on his legacy.
Right now, I was floating in warm amniotic fluid, listening to Mom's quiet, muffled sobs.
Across from her sat my grandma, Matilda Hoffman.
Matilda was holding a coffee cup, skimming off the foam slowly, like she had all the time in the world.
""Chelsea, what Nathan says goes for me, too,"" she said flatly.
""You need to abort this child.""
Mom stopped crying.
She lifted her head. Her eyes were red and puffy, her voice shaking.
""Matilda, the ultrasound can be wrong, right? What if... What if I'm carrying a son?""
Matilda slammed the coffee cup down on the table. The sound cracked through the room.
""No 'what ifs'.
""Lorelei is four months pregnant. The doctor checked and confirmed it's a boy.""
Lorelei Sutton was my dad's mistress.
Mom clutched her dress so tightly that her knuckles turned white.
""Just because she's having a son, I have to get rid of my unborn baby?""
A cold voice cut in from the doorway. ""Yes!""
It was Nathan.
He stepped in and stared down at my mom, his eyes holding no warmth.
""Chelsea, don't make things awkward for yourself,"" he said.
He pulled a document out of his suit pocket and tossed it onto the table.
""Sign it, and this villa plus 1.5 million dollars are yours. It's more than enough to ensure you live in comfort for the rest of your life.""
Mom's gaze locked on the document. The words ""Divorce Agreement"" burned into her eyes.
Her body swayed, and she almost collapsed.
1.5 million dollars.
To get rid of his wife, who was seven months pregnant with his child.
How generous of him.
Mom laughed bitterly. ""Nathan, this is your child, too.
""How could you be so heartless?""
Nathan frowned, clearly annoyed.
""I told you we needed a male heir.
""If you can't give birth to a son, you have to step aside.""
He sounded so self-righteous and arrogant.
Mom's heart lurched and leaped. A sharp, overwhelming pain seeped through the amniotic fluid, piercing me.
No. She couldn't stay so passive.
I focused all my will, sending a thought straight into her mind.
""Mom, don't cry.
""Agree to the divorce first. Just hold them off.""
Mom froze.
She looked around in shock.
""You can't see me. I'm in your belly.
""I'm your daughter, and I'm Lady Luck, here to help you.""
Her eyes widened in shock.
She instinctively placed a hand on her belly.
Matilda grew impatient with her silence.
""Chelsea, you have one day to think about it.
""If you haven't signed by this time tomorrow, you'll regret it.""
With that, she and Nathan turned away, not sparing my mom a single glance.
The door clicked shut.
Mom stood alone in the living room, frozen.
After a long silence, she spoke, her voice shaking. ""You... you were the one talking to me just now?""
""Yes. Mom, it's me,"" I replied.
""Don't be scared. I'm with you. No one can bully us.""
Mom's tears fell again. But this time, they held hope, not despair.
She wiped them away, picked up the divorce agreement on the table, and tore it to shreds.
She murmured, ""Think you can cast us aside with just 1.5 million dollars? Not a chance!""
""Mom, open your stock trading app,"" I told her.
""Do as I say—go all in on stock code 002594.""
This mental link left me a little drained.
Even though Mom was stunned, right then, she knew the advice from her unborn daughter was her only lifeline.
She poured her last 15,000 dollars into that stock.
After doing that, she collapsed onto the sofa, her palms clammy with sweat.
The next day, the stock market opened.
That stock soared unexpectedly.
The stock hit the daily limit once, then twice, and then three times in a row.
In just three days, 15,000 dollars turned into 30,000 dollars.
Chelsea stared at the number in her account, shaking with excitement.
For the first time, she truly felt my extraordinary power.
Chapter 2
This sum was far from enough.
Nathan soon found that Chelsea hadn't signed the divorce agreement.
He froze all her cards overnight, turning Chelsea from a pampered rich lady into a penniless castoff in the blink of an eye.
All she had left was the 30,000 dollars in her account.
""Baby, what can we do now?"" she asked, touching her belly, her voice hollow.
""Mom, don't panic,"" I said.
""This is just a starter.
""Real wealth demands bolder courage.""
Peering into the future drained me. I felt faint, but I fixed my next target on an overlooked field: virtual reality technology.
In this era, the tech was still in its infancy, dismissed by most.
Only a newly established company in this field, Dreamland Tech, clung to survival.
But I knew that in six months, virtual reality technology would explode.
Dreamland Tech's stock would soar hundreds of times over.
""Mom, find a way to invest every cent we have in a company called Dreamland Tech,"" I told her.
""But we only have 30,000 dollars. Will they even take it?""
""If it's not enough, try to get more.""
Chelsea bit her lip, making up her mind.
She opened her safe.
Inside lay all her jewelry, also her last shred of dignity.
She picked out the diamond set Nathan had given her on their wedding day, which she'd cherished most.
The pawnshop was bathed in dim yellow light.
With a magnifying glass in hand, the owner examined the diamond set closely.
""They're good pieces, but...""
He hesitated, his expression clouded with unease.
""Mrs. Hoffman, I can't take these.""
Chelsea's heart sank.
""Why?""
""Well... Mr. Hoffman had these custom-made specially. They carry his family's crest. I'm afraid accepting them will drag me into trouble.""
Chelsea's face instantly turned pale.
It meant Nathan had never let her have anything that truly belonged to her.
Even the gifts he'd given her were etched with his mark, making it impossible for her to sell them.
Just as despair washed over her, the pawnshop door was pushed open.
Nathan stepped in.
He glanced at the diamond sets on the counter, then at Chelsea's ashen face.
A mocking smile tugged at his lips.
""Well? Why are you in such a rush to sell your stuff?""
Chelsea clenched her fists so tight, her nails dug into her palms.
""Nathan, don't go too far.""
""Go too far?""
He laughed, like he'd heard something absurd.
""Chelsea, have you looked at yourself lately?
""You can't even bear a son. What right do you have to bargain with me?""
He picked up the diamond necklace, twirling it between his fingers.
""Do you really think you can live your comfortable life without my money?""
""Listen—without my family, you're nothing.""
His words cut like a knife, making Chelsea's chest ache.
Enough.
""Mom, don't beg him,"" I said coldly.
""We don't want a bastard's trash.
""Tell him we're not selling it. We're throwing out garbage.""
Chelsea's head snapped up.
Her eyes no longer held the weakness of begging. Instead, they blazed with a determination she'd never shown before.
She snatched the necklace from Nathan's hand, turned, and tossed it straight into the trash can beside her with no hesitation.
The movement was crisp and precise.
Nathan froze.
I caught a flash of shock in his eyes. It was not anger, but... a strange, fleeting waver.
The pawnshop owner gaped, too.
""Nathan, listen,"" Chelsea said.
Her voice wasn't loud, but every word landed like a hammer.
""I can live better without you.
""But you. You'll soon regret everything you've done today.
""Let's wait and see.""
With that, she squared her shoulders, turned on her heel, and walked out of the pawnshop neatly.
Chapter 3
Chelsea's pride only held out until she stepped out of the pawnshop.
The second Nathan was out of sight, she was totally discouraged.
""Baby, we don't even have a startup fund now,"" she said, her voice breaking.
""Mom, easy,"" I replied.
""Have you forgotten what Great-Grandpa left you?""
Chelsea's grandfather, Braxton Terrell, had once been an emerald magnate renowned across the region.
When he passed away, he'd left Chelsea a plain-looking piece of deep green emerald.
It had always been stowed away at the bottom of her jewelry box, carefully hidden by her.
""That emerald holds enormous value,"" I told her.
""Once you get it, I can recover some of my power.
""And besides... It's priceless.""
Chelsea's eyes lit up. She turned around at once and hurried back home, taking out the emerald from her jewelry box.
It was completely dark, dull, unremarkable, even a little rough.
She'd never liked it much as a kid.
""Mom, go to Sorith's tonight,"" I said.
""This emerald will be our stepping stone.""
Sorith's was the city's most exclusive private auction house.
Only the richest, most powerful people would be invited.
Chelsea had no invitation.
But she remembered that Marlon Compton, the owner of Sorith's, was Braxton's lifelong friend.
Braxton had come to Marlon's aid, bailing him out when his business stood on the brink of collapse, sparing him from catastrophe.
She picked up the phone and dialed Marlon's number tentatively.
To her surprise, Marlon offered to help without hesitation the second he heard it was her.
""Ms. Terrell, I've been waiting for your call,"" he said.
""I'll never forget Braxton's kindness. He always said you shared his spirit, and just hearing your voice, I know he was right.""
Chelsea hung up with a mix of relief and emotion.
She realized she had someone to turn to anyway.
She'd just let the Hoffman family's glow blind her for too long.
\*\*\*
The auction hall was dazzling with luxury.
Dressed in a plain black dress with no makeup, Chelsea stood in stark contrast to the gem-adorned guests.
As soon as she sat down, she felt two hostile stares locked onto her: Nathan and Lorelei.
Lorelei clung to Nathan's arm, her belly slightly rounded.
When she saw Chelsea, pride and taunting flashed in her eyes.
""Hey, Chelsea,"" she cooed.
""Here all by yourself? Nate, she's pregnant. How could you let her wander around alone?""
Her words sounded concerned, but her face dripped with schadenfreude.
Nathan's expression was just as cold.
He'd never expected to run into Chelsea here.
""Who allowed you in?"" he snapped.
Chelsea ignored them entirely, walking straight to the front row and taking a seat, which was reserved just for her by the manager.
Nathan's face darkened instantly.
The auction started.
Item after item was brought out, sold for sky-high prices.
But Chelsea never lifted her paddle.
Finally, the last item was rolled out into view.
That was a raw imperial emerald.
The starting price was 800 thousand dollars.
""Mom, this is it,"" I told Chelsea.
""Endowed with spiritual power, this raw stone is a hundred times more precious than Great-Grandpa's emerald.
""We have to get it, no matter what.""
Chelsea took a deep breath and lifted her paddle.
""1 million dollars,"" she said.
Her voice sounded calm but clear, cutting through the hall.
Every head turned to her.
Nathan and Lorelei did the same, stunned.
""Is she out of her mind? How can she have so much money?"" Lorelei whispered.
Nathan said nothing, his deep eyes fixed on Chelsea.
A portly middle-aged man lifted his paddle next.
""1.2 million dollars.""
Chelsea didn't hesitate.
""1.3 million dollars.""
The price climbed fast, soon hitting 2.5 million dollars.
The middle-aged man hesitated, then set his paddle down.
The auctioneer was about to raise his hammer when Lorelei suddenly shot up her paddle.
""3 million dollars!"" she declared, glaring defiantly at Chelsea.
""Chelsea, I love this stone. You wouldn't take it from me, would you?""
Chelsea's face stayed blank.
""3.5 million dollars.""
""4.2 million dollars!"" Lorelei practically shouted.
Nathan frowned, grabbing her arm.
""Stop messing around.""
""Nate, I can't stand the way she's acting like she owns anything she wants!""
Lorelei wrenched her arm free, her gaze still locked on Chelsea.
She was sure Chelsea had no money left.
She just wanted to make Chelsea embarrass herself in front of everyone.
Murmurs spread through the hall.
Everyone assumed Chelsea was keeping up appearances, putting on a lavish show she couldn't afford.
Chelsea's palms were damp with sweat.
She indeed had no money left.
All her hope rested on me.
""Mom, don't be scared. Keep up,"" I told her.
Forcing this thought through left my vision spinning, but I had to hold on.
""He'll help us.""
I directed my focus to an unassuming corner at the back of the hall.
An elderly man in a tuxedo sat there quietly.
That was Marlon, Great-Grandpa's dear friend and the most renowned emerald merchant in America.
As if guided, Chelsea glanced in that direction.
She steeled her resolve and lifted her paddle again.
""5 million dollars.""
The hall erupted in murmurs.
Lorelei's face turned pale.
She'd never thought Chelsea would dare to keep up.
Five million dollars was way beyond the raw stone's estimated value.
Nathan's expression turned icy.
He saw this as Chelsea deliberately defying him.
He lifted his own paddle. ""5.2 million dollars.""
He wanted to remind Chelsea who held real power here.
Tension thickened in the air.
Every eye locked on Chelsea and Nathan.
What was once an auction had turned into a public display of a wealthy family's feud.
Even the auctioneer's forehead glistened with sweat.
""Mr. Hoffman bids 5.2 million dollars! Any higher offers?"" he called.
His gaze swung to Chelsea.
Chelsea's hand trembled slightly.
She knew this was her last stand.
""Mom, keep up. Marlon has prepared emergency funds for you. He'll lend it to you. Just do it!""
Chelsea closed her eyes. When she opened them, only resolve remained.
She raised the paddle.
""6...""
She barely got the first number out when a hand grabbed her wrist from behind.
The grip was so tight that Chelsea let out a pained gasp.
It was one of the Hoffman family's bodyguards.
Nathan stood up and marched toward her, his expression icy.
""Chelsea, there's a line to my patience,"" he said sharply.
""You want to humiliate yourself here just to spite me?
""Can you even afford the consequences?""
The bodyguard hauled her up from her seat, treating her like an object.
The surrounding guests turned their eyes toward them. A few wore expressions of sympathy, but most of them were waiting to watch a show unfold.
Lorelei stood beside Nathan, her face glowing with pride.
Chelsea's face drained of all color.
Humiliation washed over her, suffocating.
Just as the bodyguard was about to drag her out of the auction hall, an aged but powerful voice cut through the noise.

1p5ycbw,https://i.redd.it/iv67onpvta3g1.png,Coffee Date (Chapter 2 of my story),"Illustration above is by me. One day I'll make this into a comic!
Chapter 2 below:

He's only 18. Never really experienced life yet. But, he feels like he doesnt have alot to do. Or anything significant. If he had his first boyfriend, would he be able to maintain all of that? 
Anthony laid. His body stretched out in the center of a lounge's couch. He never took up alot of space due to his short stature. 

These were the thoughts that went through his head as he watched the ceiling fan. Just gently following the blades twirling with his eyes. His lips were stretched in a pout as he tried to process yesterday. He told Craig such sensitive information so soon. That hes autistic, but Craig didnt mind.

He doesnt even know what to do after this. How to continue their relationship. But he likes him already, but how does that form a connection? He can't feel satisfied with himself.

He gets up and walks out the door without saying a word.

His mom walks downstairs to see that he wasnt on the couch. Its only just her and the dry air brushing her skin. A very quiet air. She knows how he leaves the house unannounced, since he typically doesnt communicate his needs. She takes her phone out and sends him a text. She patiently waits for a reply, letting out a sigh through her nose.

""Are you meeting with Craig again? How is it going?""

""yeah, im gonna ask him something""

""What is it?""

""to go to the coffee shop""

She stares at the phone for a moment. Thats new.

""Are you going to get a latte like you usually do?""

""yeah""

""I hope it goes well 😊""

Anthony looks up from his phone. But instead of his expression being of excitement, its sad. Unconfident.

Craig is in front of him, and turns to look at him.

His eyes widen a little in nervousness.

""I wanted to tell you something.""

""What is it?""

""I wanted to go to a coffee shop. The coffee shop thats outside our neighborhood.""

""With me?""

""Yeah."" He blushes a little.

He didnt feel like their interaction was difficult and was able to walk without feeling stupid.

They step foot into the shop, and Anthony is greeted with a familiar face. Kind of. Randy from senior year is now a barista.

Hes taller than Anthony and is quite skinny. More skinnier than him. And he has spiky hair tucked under his hat.

""Oh, hey Ant.""

""Hey."" He looks down at his feet trying to avoid eye contact.

""Could I get two lattes, please?"" 

""Whats the second coffee for?""

""Craig. My friend.""

Randy starts composing the drink, but still wants to start small talk.

Anthony is leaned at the counter nervously as he tries to not stand out. He looks behind him to see Craig at a table, smiling at him. He smiles back a little.

""Here you go! Also, I had Ms. Antonov come here a week ago.""

""Ms. Antonov?""

""Harriet Antonov.""

Anthony pauses for a second.

""Oh, my mom... yeah. She also loves coffee.""

He walks away, smiling a little at Randy.

He places two cups on the table hes sharing with Craig and he sits down, glaring at him with his hands in his lap.

""I thought you would've liked it if we both drank the same thing.""

Craig takes a sip. He looks at Anthony for second, impressed by the drink. Takes another sip again.

Anthony puts his hand over his mouth trying not to laugh.

""Whats so funny?"" Craig asked with a smirk.

""Nothing."" He looks to the side, acting clueless, then back at him with a small grin.

""Hm."" Another sip.

Anthony drinks his coffee looking away from Craig, as its kind of difficult to look at him for such a long time.

He darts his eyes around, observing the people. Then the dimmly lit lights. Then Randy. Then Craig again.

He looks down at his cup, tapping his fingers on it.

Craig looks at him and notices how much he looks immersed in thought. How his hair was draped on his shoulders and a curl was almost touching the coffee's foam.

""Hey, your hair is um...""

Anthony looks up at him.

""My hair? What about it?"" He looks down.

""Oh."" He moves his curl out of the way.

""Thanks.""

Craig finishes his drink.
""Are you done?""

""Yeah."" Anthony smiles a little.
""...I enjoyed doing this with you."" 

""Me too.""

Anthony walks back into the house with a smile on his face, something that Harriet noticed. But she didnt say anything.",2,1764031012.0,OriginalCharacter,8,1.0,False

1p5yabh,https://www.reddit.com/r/TirzepatideRX/comments/1p5yabh/nervous_newbies_only/,Nervous Newbies Only,"Having just given myself a second injection for the start of Week 2, thought I’d share my initial experience with those about to begin the Tirz journey.  Being so new, I’m really not qualified to give advice, but maybe something I share will help someone, since I’ve been fortunate with immediate results.

 

At a BMI of 40+ (used to be called “Morbid Obesity”, now politely called “Class III Obesity) for a number of years, I was headed toward irreversible health damage.  Being faced with starting a potential lifetime regimen of RX (statins, etc.), I needed to do something right now.  In some ways very lucky, my blood test results never quite breached the A1C/FPG threshold levels for a diabetes diagnosis.  But, that also meant that my insurance wouldn’t cover GLP-1 drugs.

 

My doctor told me to seek out a legitimate Compound Pharmacy which could formulate Tirz and sell it at a discount so I could afford it.  Wanting to potentially isolate the cause of any side effects, decided to go for Additive-Free RX.  After days of research, settled on ProRX from Fifty 410, whom I’ve found extremely responsive to questions/issues. 

 

Joined Reddit to have access to boots-on-the-ground info from others—you’re in the right place.  I am deathly afraid of needles, so actually came up with excuses to delay a few days before giving myself my first injection.  Even though there is actually no pain or discomfort from the tiny needles I was given by ProRX (Sure Comfort brand), I must admit that I was a little psyched out again today before giving myself the second injection… but, again, no pain and no problem.

 

Before I’ve given the injections, I watch a short video “How to Take Compounded GLP-1 Injections” on the “hers” YouTube channel.  I imagine I’ll watch it again before each injection, as a reminder as well as a calming influence.

 

The potential side effects I’d read about and heard other people experience scared me quite a bit.  Decided I’d have as bland a diet as possible at first to try to avoid as many unpleasant outcomes as possible.  Also made the decision to drink 120-180 ounces of water per day as a way to make sure I stayed well-hydrated enough as well as cleanse my system.  (I never drank so much water before… not sure how much that helps avoid side effects, but I’ll definitely keep it up for now—even if it has been embarrassing a couple of times I was out and had to go to the bathroom multiple times.)

 

I will list what I eat below, but, so far I have had no ill side effects at all, except for one single time when I put a tablespoon of butter on my daily sweet potato.  Not long after eating it, I had a horrible stomach ache and felt quite nauseous for a while, so I have not used butter at all since.  That has been my sole episode of a side effect.

 

Everyone’s body chemistry is different, so maybe as long as you monitor your consumption and make notes of what you ate and drank when you might have any problems, perhaps just avoid whatever it was that might have caused it.  I did read warnings about using cream—especially heavy (whipping) cream in coffee.  I took the risk of adding a very small amount to the first cup I had after a couple days on the diet, and didn’t have a problem.  I’ve had a few cups of coffee since then and have progressively increased the amount of heavy cream I use and never have had an issue.  That makes me think even more what causes side effects for some and not others directly relates to our individual body chemistry.  If you have a bad reaction to something, definitely avoid it… even if it’s on the “safe” list.

 

Before my first injection, I read extensively about dietary concerns while using GLP-1, and how we need to keep our consumption of protein high.  Realizing that I would have trouble reaching that level just from food consumption, I saw the wisdom in Protein Shakes.  However, when I looked at places to buy things online and delved into it a little more, not only did the pre-packaged shakes seem a little expensive, but most contained ingredients I either wanted or needed to avoid.  So, I settled on the protein powder below.

 

Before I add the list of my daily consumption and sign off, it’s probably appropriate to say that the results I’ve so far had after one single week on 2.25 mg of Tirz have far exceeded my expectations.  I monitor my weight daily, and blood pressure a few times/day to come up with an average.  NOTE:  I have been taking a diuretic for a year to lower my BP, so BP readings are aided/are better than they’d be without the diuretic.  My goal is now to get off the diuretic if I can continue to lower my blood pressure as I lose the weight.

 

Day 2 on Tirz showed virtually no change in my stats from Day 1.  However, from Day 2 – Day 7, my blood pressure steadily declined each day, from a starting point of 145/85 Nov 17th to 120/75 on Nov 24^(th) (after the first two readings today).   And, after one week, I have lost seven pounds. 

 

But… I also measured my waist on Day 1 and Day 7, and there was barely a ½” reduction in the size of my waist, from 50 ½” to 50” even.   I have not begun to exercise, which I finally plan on starting to do later tomorrow AM, and I read that a lot of weight loss can be from muscle if not exercising.  Can’t tell much from only losing seven pounds so far, but I’m hoping I can turn things around to where I’m losing mostly fat and not muscle.

 

DIET  
Again—I keep my diet bland in an attempt to avoid side effects.  I’ve purchased everything at Costco except the cottage cheese and the PB2 Pure, which I can’t find there.  PB2 has many products—PB2 Pure is probably the healthiest… 100% powdered roasted peanuts.  I know that Greek Yogurt should have more protein than the kind I buy, but what I buy is healthy and tastes great and I save a few dollars.

 

I call these “Meals”—multiple small amounts of food eaten through the day.  And, as mentioned, I’m also drinking a lot of water throughout the day.

 

Meal One soon after getting up  
Two eggs scrambled with Trader Joe small curd cottage cheese  
Small amount of chopped Broccoli florets

 

Meal Two whenever hungry later in the morning  
Ascent 100% Native Whey Protein Blend (large scoop)  
4-6 ounces of water  
2-3 heaping tablespoons of Noga Premium Whole Milk Yogurt.  
Small handful of organic frozen Blueberries

(If I go to work that day, I’ll take this with me in an ice chest.)

 

Meal Three early afternoon  
½ can of Kirkland Albacore tuna on Cruchmaster Multi-Grain Crackers

   Or, on alternating days

½ can of Kirkland Boneless and Skinless Wild-Caught Alaskan Pink Salmon

**\[If I skip any meal, it’s this one, followed by eating Meal Four earlier + Meal Five\]**

 

Meal Four late afternoon or early evening  
Small Chicken Breast cooked in toaster oven… just got an Air Fryer  
(marinade of salt/cumin/turmeric/black pepper/lemon juice/olive oil)  
Pre-cooked if working, freshly cooked if at home  
Handful of organic Broccoli florets

 

Meal Five sometime during the evening **\[if I skipped Meal Three\]**  
Ascent 100% Native Whey Protein Blend (large scoop)  
4-6 ounces of water  
2-3 heaping tablespoons of Noga Premium Whole Milk Yogurt.  
2 heaping tablespoons of PB2 Pure

 

Meal Six at the end of the day  
One average sized Sweet Potato microwaved… will also start to cook this in Air Fryer

 

Periodic snacks during the day:  a few of the Multi-Grain Crackers or Peanuts

 

This was my diet every day in Week 1, which I may continue in Week 2 or longer… until my weight loss stops and/or my blood pressure stops improving.  Very boring it is, but so far so good—and absolutely no side effects… except the butter one single time I’d put some on the sweet potato.

 

I understand that at higher doses of GLP-1 my appetite will diminish more, so may have to adjust.  But, if my weight loss continues, I don’t know why or if I should increase my dosage.

 

I hope maybe this helps someone else starting off in some way.  Good luck!",1,1764030867.0,TirzepatideRX,1,0.67,False

I’ve been watching your Big Brother this year and I’m so impressed. A lot more interesting than the recent BBUK seasons. Let’s discuss!

**Holly** (1) — what a sweet soul. She is completely misunderstood, and people are clearly jealous of her: beauty and intelligence is a deadly combination. The other housemates are clearly ganging up on her and it’s not nice to see. Like when she said “everyone was more pissed off about that party than they are with the 10,000. Imagine if it was *me* who took that money, I would literally be… decapitated.” So true. 

Also Alanna definitely twisted Holly’s words about Emily. Holly said “imagine never being invited to the cool kids’ party”, and I have to be completely honest, I did interpret that comment as Holly including *herself* as one of the people who never got invited to parties when she was younger. She later confirmed this in her argument with Alanna: “do you know who else *never* got invited to parties? Me.” I believe her. The assumption that Holly always had such an easy and popular life is why Alanna was ready to make her the house enemy for a comment that really wasn’t that evil. 

Holly for the win! Probably unlikely, but she has given the most drama and has actually been pretty sensible in all of her situations, despite what others say about her. 

**Coco** (2) — Really cool person. A bit performative at times for my taste, but other than that, I’ve really enjoyed watching her navigate some awkward situations in the house. Stashing coffee was funny to me. The Bruce situation! I kind of love it… how they both are trying so hard to *not* be attracted to each other lol. They would make a cute couple. Also Coco’s friendship with Holly is a rollercoaster, so that’s been fun to watch play out. Holly or Coco for the win!

**Bruce** (3) — I was #TeamBruce in that situation with Jane. I thought it was completely ridiculous for her to accuse those guys of sexism for a few innocent farts. Bruce held his ground and stood up for himself and the younger guys, and I appreciated that. He did get a bit heated, but at least he apologized for it, which is more than what Jane did. 

**Emily** (4) — A bit boring but overall a nice + sensible person. The nervous ticks are kind of funny, when she’s around people arguing. 

**Vincent** (5) — A bit boring but overall a nice + attractive person. He was right to take the 10,000 btw. I think anyone who tries to make someone feel bad about that (Conor) is just being pretentious and self-centered. 

**Colin** (6) — Fallen angel. He started off strong. I was rooting for him! His storyline about not feeling smart really tugged at my heartstrings. However, as the show goes on, his behavior is just becoming… annoying. He’s like one of those guys who thinks everything single little thing he does is so hilarious and we are all laughing along with him. Pretending to be mind-blown by the ice getting the stain out for example. And being overly thankful for the coffee that BB gave him. It’s just too theatrical. Sorry, not sorry!

**Abiola** (7) — I actually hate her guts, but she’s been boring in recent episodes so there are bigger fish to fry. That situation where she had a meltdown because Holly denied the concept of pretty privilege… too much. Embarrassing! Then you had the ‘allies’ (Alanna/Coco/Mia) coming to her rescue and enabling her self-victimizing ways. She’s been okay besides that, so I’m not that bothered by her.

**Edward** (8) — A bit snappy, and I usually enjoy that in a BB housemate. Edward however, is just coming across as miserable. Also, I didn’t particularly enjoy Mia as a person, but the way Edward played with her heart in that race situation was a bit mean-spirited. 

**Allana** (9) — Oh I absolutely can’t stand her. So preachy and contradictory with her own values. When she said “we need to let the *minority* speak” in that conversation about *pretty* privilege: What does one have to do with the other? Because are “ugly” and “pretty” identities now? And are you saying that minorities are ugly? Get your shit together Alanna. You are not intelligent enough to be preaching to people about identity politics. 

As for the Holly situation: what a shit-stirrer. Alanna is the one who started that interaction by bumping Holly and pointing at Emily, who was simply living and watching the movie. We could easily interpret that moment as ‘condescending’ from Alanna to Emily. And I’ll say it again: Alanna twisted Holly’s words. 

Holly said: “imagine never being invited to the cool kids’ party” (which I believe she was including herself in that sentiment)

Alannas said Holly said: “she’s the type of girl who was never invited to any parties”. 

Alanna then admitted she sometimes gets the wording wrong, but then had full confidence in what she *thought* Holly said. Mia should have STAYED over Alanna. 

**Conor** (10) — The worst of the bunch. Moments that shouldn’t be forgotten: when Conor said he would

- throw a chair at Michael
- spit in Michael’s food
- wished for the party food to be laced with laxatives

His hatred for Holly is disturbing. She can’t do anything right in his eyes, and I genuinely believe this is a Conor problem, not a Holly problem. 

We also see people in Big Brother around the world who designate themselves as the ‘house chef’, *clearly* in an attempt to gain favor with the other housemates and stay in the game longer. Conor is a stereotype at this point. Nobody needs your food that badly. 

Also, in the year 2025, anyone who goes onto reality tv competition shows like Big Brother to ‘represent’ something other themselves as an individual, automatically have my vote to evict. Manipulative bastards. 

One last thing: when he tried to shame Vince and then said “I’m pretty confident I’ll make it to the final”… wow. How arrogant. ",0,1764030680.0,BBAU,4,0.4,False
1p5y5j3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1p5y5j3/my_23f_age_gap_relationship_ended_yesterday_with/,my (23F) age gap relationship ended yesterday with a man (46M) - any advice?,"I (23F) met an older man (46M) with no kids when I was abroad in June of this year. I was the one that approached him when we met abroad and I got his number after finding out that he lived in the same US city as me, which seemed perfect.

Prior to our first date, we texted saying that this would be a fun fling with an older man/younger woman. He also texted me that he wanted to set some expectations, saying that he “probably wouldn’t ever date someone my age.” I agreed and told him that things would likely eventually reach a stalemate but I am open minded to see where things go. I also said that I wasn’t sure what I wanted out of it yet since we had not really gone on any dates yet. 

The part that I left out was that I didn’t really want things to reach a stalemate and that I wanted to date him, but at that time, I was trying to play the chill card and not scare him off. I think at that point, it was a fun project for me to feel validated by an older man wanting to be in a relationship with me. I wanted to change his mind from “probably” not wanting to date someone as young as me to wanting to date someone as young as me, because changing his mind would mean I was special and mature enough for him. It would mean that I was an exception to the rule, and that he liked me enough to make it work. 

On our first date, we ended up connecting more than expected, spent 5.5 hours getting drinks and talking, then he walked me home and kissed me outside my front door. I have texted with him everyday since our first date. It started getting pretty normal for him to be sending a good morning and good night text every day, send random nonsense throughout the day, etc. I called him out for it once and asked him why he texts me so much, he responded with “stop being so fun to text then.” 

We would hangout over weekends and spend 24-36 hours together. When we would wake up, we would go for a walk together with his dog and get coffee. Sometimes we would go out to breakfast together. Sometimes he would cook breakfast for us. He gave me the keys to his house so that I could have a copy - why would he ever do that? That just felt like such a clear sign that things were working, he trusted me, wanted it to work, etc. This was clearly more than a fling. 

Over text, he referred to me as “my girl.” He once said “anything that you love, I love.” He took selfies of us together once. He occasionally spoke about how much he liked my personality, intelligence, and maturity. He cooked me dinner and opened a bottle of wine from the winery we were at on the day we met.  A few months ago, he made a point of telling me he wasn’t using dating apps since early July (when we met), but then I recently saw a Raya notification pop up on his phone. He made a few different suggestions to the fact that I was the only person he was seeing (EX: saying my mom and him are the only people that come over and saying I’m the only girl that his dog is used to stealing her part of the bed). I made sure never to “level up” anything on my own - basically, every time we did something new or different such as going to the movies, it was his idea and I was trying to go with the flow.

Yesterday, I brought up the fact that we needed to have a conversation. I am curious if he was ever planning to bring it up if I had not brought it up, especially considering the fact that he is the one who ultimately told me it wasn’t going to work out. He said that I am just getting started in my adult life and he is about to be done with his (which I assume he was just speaking in a work sense, because he plans to retire before he turns 50 and move to Europe). He said we are in very different places in our lives. 

He suggested transitioning into a “friendship/tapering off” situation rather than cutting things off cold, but that it is up to me and he gets it if I need to think about it more. Do you think this is just a way of him comforting himself? Is this making it easier or harder?

He did tell me that he is sad. He also said he is sorry that he feels like he should have maybe just drawn the line from the very beginning and not gone on any dates with someone as young as me, and felt like maybe he should have had the foresight to know that it would be better not to get started with this in any capacity even a “fling.” He said he has no regrets but he feels that he met a very awesome person. I appreciate him taking some accountability, and I also apologized for even putting him in a weird situation where he had to choose whether he would want to go on any dates at all, and draw a boundary that he clearly ended up going against. 

Overall, I did develop strong feelings for him over the course of our time together but I never told him. I don’t think it would’ve changed the ultimate decision anyways? But what if it would have? Is it worth trying to talk again? If he met a woman around his age that was still planning to work for 20 more years until she was 65, how would that be better than the situation with me? Would that not just be a similar situation where he’s retiring soon and then he’s with someone who still is working for multiple more decades? I just wish we could talk again and I wish he could change his mind. Is it worth trying to talk to him about it again?

I think maybe there were two conflicting truths at the same time: “This probably can’t work long-term” versus “But I really like her and I want to keep seeing her.” He wasn’t lying. He wasn’t pretending. He wasn’t malicious. He was human — and humans follow the connection in front of them, even when they know it may end. He knew the logic. But he also lived the emotion. Emotion usually wins in the moment. If he truly “knew it would never work,” he would have stopped it after the first date — or never gone on it at all. But he didn’t. That means part of him hoped too. Not as much as me, maybe — but he did. He wasn’t playing me. He was conflicted, and he let the feelings happen.

I feel that he really truly cared about me and maybe did want it to work/does want it to work but ultimately led with his brain rather than his heart. I tend to lead with my heart before my brain, until there is no other choice. Now I am left regretting ever bringing up this conversation at all, that ultimately ended in us ending things. Should I not have brought it up? Do you think he was ever going to bring it up? How long would this have gone on for if I had not said something?

What do you think I did wrong in this? What do you think he did wrong? Is it reasonable of me to be a bit annoyed with him? Do you think he ever thought it was going to work out? Or was I getting played? Do you think there’s still a change this could work out? I am also struggling with how the “tapering/friendship” is going to play out. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation? What helped you process this? I appreciate anyone with input!!!

And then, my adhd life got in the way. At 8pm last night, I realized I had only about 48 hours left so I started on page 3. Went to bed at 10pm and was up to page 9!!

Woke up at 3am and worked for another couple of hours (carefully sanding and acrylic painting each edge), getting up to page 11.

Put it all on the coffee table and was looking forward to finishing it tonight. Uhhhh...  Yeah, clueless me thought it ended tomorrow night!

1p5y2jh,https://www.reddit.com/r/MounjaroAus/comments/1p5y2jh/two_weeks_in_at_25/,Two weeks in at 2.5!,"Thought I'd write an update as I was looking for similar experiences before I started. 
I am about 10-20kg overweight, 1 year postpartum and have hashimotos, psoriasis and what I assume is some kind of mast cell activation that comes and goes (happened post partum). 
I wasn't that interested in glp-1s until I started seeing people with similar health conditions reporting so much improvement (joint pain, fatigue, digestion, sleep) and I guess I felt ""lucky"" my BMI was high enough to convince my doc to prescribe it. 

2 weeks in - oh my goodness. 

The food noise! Being tired ALL the time and in the habit from the breastfeeding hunger I was just binge eating so so kuch. And it just... stops! Like, I get super hungry for food but really want actual food. The hunger is so different to the desperate fatigue binge eating. I can't describe it. It's wonderful. 

The fatigue! Two weeks in and I'm not an energiser bunny but the huge energy crashes I was having has stopped. 

Sleep - I am a chronic insomniac, and aside from the first night, I am now sleeping like, blackout sleeping for 7 hours straight each night (barring the 1 year old needing me!). I didn't realise how crape my sleep was!

Anyway I've lost 2 kilos and 1-2 cms off all my measurements. I am weight training and walking. 

I'm also saving nearly the equivalent in 2.5mg pen in coffees and treats. I barely want coffee and it affects me more. I've gone from 2-3 a day to 1 in the morning. 

Wtf?!?!

1p5y1ww,https://www.reddit.com/r/bigbrotheruk/comments/1p5y1ww/a_bbuk_superfan_watches_bb_australia_for_the/,A BBUK superfan watches BB Australia for the first time… (End of Week 3 Housemate Rankings —Eviction Spoilers),"**Holly** (1) — what a sweet soul. She is completely misunderstood, and people are clearly jealous of her: beauty and intelligence is a deadly combination. The other housemates are clearly ganging up on her and it’s not nice to see. Like when she said “everyone was more pissed off about that party than they are with the 10,000. Imagine if it was *me* who took that money, I would literally be… decapitated.” So true. 

Also Alanna definitely twisted Holly’s words about Emily. Holly said “imagine never being invited to the cool kids’ party”, and I have to be completely honest, I did interpret that comment as Holly including *herself* as one of the people who never got invited to parties when she was younger. She later confirmed this in her argument with Alanna: “do you know who else *never* got invited to parties? Me.” I believe her. The assumption that Holly always had such an easy and popular life is why Alanna was ready to make her the house enemy for a comment that really wasn’t that evil. 

Holly for the win! Probably unlikely, but she has given the most drama and has actually been pretty sensible in all of her situations, despite what others say about her. 

**Coco** (2) — Really cool person. A bit performative at times for my taste, but other than that, I’ve really enjoyed watching her navigate some awkward situations in the house. Stashing coffee was funny to me. The Bruce situation! I kind of love it… how they both are trying so hard to *not* be attracted to each other lol. They would make a cute couple. Also Coco’s friendship with Holly is a rollercoaster, so that’s been fun to watch play out. Holly or Coco for the win!

**Bruce** (3) — I was #TeamBruce in that situation with Jane. I thought it was completely ridiculous for her to accuse those guys of sexism for a few innocent farts. Bruce held his ground and stood up for himself and the younger guys, and I appreciated that. He did get a bit heated, but at least he apologized for it, which is more than what Jane did. 

**Emily** (4) — A bit boring but overall a nice + sensible person. The nervous ticks are kind of funny, when she’s around people arguing. 

**Vincent** (5) — A bit boring but overall a nice + attractive person. He was right to take the 10,000 btw. I think anyone who tries to make someone feel bad about that (Conor) is just being pretentious and self-centered. 

**Colin** (6) — Fallen angel. He started off strong. I was rooting for him! His storyline about not feeling smart really tugged at my heartstrings. However, as the show goes on, his behavior is just becoming… annoying. He’s like one of those guys who thinks everything single little thing he does is so hilarious and we are all laughing along with him. Pretending to be mind-blown by the ice getting the stain out for example. And being overly thankful for the coffee that BB gave him. It’s just too theatrical. Sorry, not sorry!

**Abiola** (7) — I actually hate her guts, but she’s been boring in recent episodes so there are bigger fish to fry. That situation where she had a meltdown because Holly denied the concept of pretty privilege… too much. Embarrassing! Then you had the ‘allies’ (Alanna/Coco/Mia) coming to her rescue and enabling her self-victimizing ways. She’s been okay besides that, so I’m not that bothered by her.

**Edward** (8) — A bit snappy, and I usually enjoy that in a BB housemate. Edward however, is just coming across as miserable. Also, I didn’t particularly enjoy Mia as a person, but the way Edward played with her heart in that race situation was a bit mean-spirited. 

**Allana** (9) — Oh I absolutely can’t stand her. So preachy and contradictory with her own values. When she said “we need to let the *minority* speak” in that conversation about *pretty* privilege: What does one have to do with the other? Because are “ugly” and “pretty” identities now? And are you saying that minorities are ugly? Get your shit together Alanna. You are not intelligent enough to be preaching to people about identity politics. 

As for the Holly situation: what a shit-stirrer. Alanna is the one who started that interaction by bumping Holly and pointing at Emily, who was simply living and watching the movie. We could easily interpret that moment as ‘condescending’ from Alanna to Emily. And I’ll say it again: Alanna twisted Holly’s words. 

Holly said: “imagine never being invited to the cool kids’ party” (which I believe she was including herself in that sentiment)

Alannas said Holly said: “she’s the type of girl who was never invited to any parties”. 

Alanna then admitted she sometimes gets the wording wrong, but then had full confidence in what she *thought* Holly said. Mia should have STAYED over Alanna. 

**Conor** (10) — The worst of the bunch. Moments that shouldn’t be forgotten: when Conor said he would

- throw a chair at Michael
- spit in Michael’s food
- wished for the party food to be laced with laxatives

His hatred for Holly is disturbing. She can’t do anything right in his eyes, and I genuinely believe this is a Conor problem, not a Holly problem. 

We also see people in Big Brother around the world who designate themselves as the ‘house chef’, *clearly* in an attempt to gain favor with the other housemates and stay in the game longer. Conor is a stereotype at this point. Nobody needs your food that badly. 

Also, in the year 2025, anyone who goes onto reality tv competition shows like Big Brother to ‘represent’ something other themselves as an individual, automatically have my vote to evict. Manipulative bastards. 

One last thing: when he tried to shame Vince and then said “I’m pretty confident I’ll make it to the final”… wow. How arrogant. ",0,1764030249.0,bigbrotheruk,0,0.14,False
1p5y1rk,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1p5y1rk/i_cant_do_this_anymore/,I cant do this anymore,"Hello everyone, I’d like to start this sad story by telling you a bit about how I grew up.
When I was little, I lived with my father. He never had a stable job and always lived by getting by however he could.
Despite this, we had the support of my grandparents who, of course, made sure we never lacked a roof over our heads or food to eat. I didn’t have new toys or clothes like other kids, but in my own small way, I lived well.
This lasted until my mother and father started a legal battle for my custody, and many things changed.

Years passed, and after a long time in court, I went to live with my mother.
I moved to the other side of Italy and started a completely new life because, in the meantime, she had found a new partner. A much older man, the head of a large company and very wealthy.
Basically, from when I was 11 until I was 18, I lived a life where I had no financial problems at all. I’d open my mouth and receive everything I wanted — trips, clothes, games, everything a teenager could ever dream of. I had big prospects for my future: university in Switzerland and a career already planned out.
All of this until he died.

He didn’t leave us anything. He and my mother were not married (I skipped the part where my mother had serious alcohol issues and made this man’s life hell, but I’ll leave it there because otherwise this would be too long), and so just when I was supposed to start my life as a young adult, my world collapsed.
Not only had I lost one of the most important people in my life — someone who acted more like a father than my biological one — but I also lost my entire future.
I fell into a terrible depression that only worsened my already fragile relationship with my mother.

Again, I won’t go into details, but after about a year, I went to live with my biological father. Over the years he had moved close to where I lived, found a stable job, and rebuilt his life. When he found out how I was doing, he took me under his wing.
Everything went great until I finished school (in Italy you finish high school at 19).
I found a job in a supermarket that paid very well, but he soon lost his job.
The expenses started to fall entirely on me, and even though the job paid well, I never made it to the end of the month without the help of some friend.

He started putting ideas in my head about opening credit cards and taking out bank loans — all in my name — promising that he would soon find a job and pay all the installments without issues.
Months passed and he convinced me to pay for trips with his girlfriends at the time, ask other people for money, and take even more bank loans, eventually reaching almost 20,000 euros.
I had completely blinders on. I don’t want to come off as naive or someone who can’t think for herself, but I realized only much later that I had a toxic relationship with my father and that I had a very hard time saying no to his requests.
When I moved in with him, he had been very supportive during a delicate moment for my mental health — he was there for me like no one else had ever been. He was attentive, talked to me, spent time with me the way a father should. We spent hours watching movies and TV shows together, going out for coffee or wandering around shopping centers just to keep each other company.
These were things I hadn’t really experienced with my stepfather because he was much older and had a very different mindset.

I let everything slide, even though I was drowning in debt, because months later he still hadn’t found a job and the installments were piling up.
Until I found out that behind my back he had stolen a gold pendant from me (one of my last memories of my stepfather), and that he had sent a lot of money to one of his girlfriends — money that was supposed to cover my expenses, money that had been lent to us… because I forgot to mention that like an idiot I always let him handle everything.
He even sold his van, his only means of transportation, to send her money.

My world fell apart, and I thank heaven that I had — and still have — a boyfriend who has always supported me and been there for me.
Now my father barely talks to me, doesn’t give me attention anymore, we don’t watch films together.
I am depressed, I have a ton of debt, and as soon as my paycheck comes in, it’s gone in 10 days. He found a job, but apparently he hasn’t been paid.

I can’t go back to my mother because I have a job here, and honestly I don’t want to live with her anyway.
I can’t live with my boyfriend because we’re both only 20, and yes, he has a job and, having a normal family, he can save most of his salary, but I could never live with someone without being able to support myself.
So I can only stay here.

If one day I wanted to buy a car, I couldn’t get financing because I’m flagged in all banking databases.
I don’t even know why I work, since it doesn’t make sense.
I always eat the same things to spend less.
I can’t take a trip during my work holidays because I can’t afford it.
I can’t buy new pants that I need because I can’t afford them.
I can’t treat my boyfriend to dinner because I can’t afford it.
I can’t do anything.
If it weren’t for my boyfriend, I wouldn’t even leave the house.
I have no friends.
I am completely depressed.
I don’t cry anymore, I keep everything inside.
I wish I were like other people my age who go out, have fun, and live a normal life.
A short trip once a year. A dinner out sometimes. A new outfit as a gift to myself — small things I used to take for granted but now seem impossible.
I’m so tired; I don’t know how much longer I can keep going like this, honestly.
I can’t breathe anymore. I have no one.

Just wanted to give a little trip report to maybe help some others travelling and also give a big thank you to everyone in this sub that helped with ideas! We ended up changing plans part way through due to the fire in Tongoriro, and it still ended up being the best time! (Also heads up this may be long lol). 

Day 1: 
Arrived from Canada (south of Toronto) in the evening to Auckland. Went straight to the hotel, ordered Uber Eats, and passed out after like 35 hours of travel. We stayed at a hotel close to the airport so we could come pick up a car the next day and head south.  Bags were delayed also but came in early the next morning! 

Day 2:  
Picked up rental car (Kia Stonic) at the airport.  Drove to Hobbiton for a tour, which was SO GOOD.  Even if you’re not a LOTR fan it truly is a beautiful place.  We did the regular tour which came with an included drink at the Green Dragon.  They have non alcoholic options as well.  Well worth it! 

Drove to Rotorua and checked into motel.  We stayed in a little family motel which was very sweet and the owner was so nice.  

Had the dinner experience at Mitai Maori Village.  The food was delicious, and the people working the experience were great.  It’s definitely geared to tourists but was fun and you meet other travellers. There were some other patrons asking maybe not so respectful questions, which was a little uncomfortable.  Still a great time! 

Day 3: 
Original plan was to work our way slowly to Taupō and Ohakune.  We decided to stay in Rotorua for another night then head up the Coromandel Peninsula instead. 

We did a day trip to the Taupo area.  We did the Huka Falls boat tour (great experience), had McWings in the plane lol, walked around Craters of the Moon and stopped to see some mud pools.  We also did the little golf ball drive into the lake in Taupo and of course neither of us got anywhere near the hole but it was fun.  I talked to the guy running it who actually lived in Canada for a bit and said that Kiwis relate themselves a lot to Canadians! 

Came back to Rotorua, had dinner on Eat Street and then did the nighttime Redwoods walk.  This is an amazing experience! 12/10 recommend.  Even for someone who is terrified of heights, it was so beautiful at night and after about 2 suspension bridges I was completely at ease.  

Day 4: 
Woke up, had a breakfast pie and coffee, and went to Zorb as soon as they opened.  This surprised me - it was so fun. My partner and I went down in the same ball for 2, and then raced the big one last.  It was so ridiculous but a ton of fun. 

Did a tour of the Kiwi Hatchery, saw some kiwis, saw an egg! The hatchery is owned by the local Iwi and all the profits go to the kiwis - the staff are paid by the Iwi.  A great initiative to support. 

Drove to Whitianga on the Coromandel Peninsula.  Stayed in another very sweet family motel - with cats! It was so rainy when we got in, we just did dinner and relaxed. 

Day 5: 
Scenic way back to Auckland.  We drove to Coromandel Town and down the Pacific Coast Highway.  Amazing views! We took our time and stopped lots for scenic areas.  We also stopped at Coromandel Oyster Company and had some lunch oysters! 

Made it to Auckland, stayed in CBD at same hotel I would be in for work. 

Day 6: 
We did the gourmet food and wine tour with Ananda Tours around Waiheke Island.  I think it was well worth the $$! Our tour guide was fantastic as were the others on the tour with us.  Food and wine - and beer and whisky - were absolutely delicious.  We walked around the village and bit, had a snack, and headed back to Auckland. 

Day 7: 
Northland day trip! We went up to Whangārei, stopped lots at scenic places, went to the falls, and did the Waipu glow worm caves tour.  Came back to Auckland. 

Had dinner at Ahi.  My partner had the lamb and I had the salmon and it was sooo good.  Honestly probably the best salmon I’ve ever had. Another day with 0 complaints! 

Day 8-12: 
My partner went back home because he could only get the week off.  My work stuff happened and I didn’t have much time in the evenings. 

I did get a chance to try some food around the CBD, and I discovered Taier which is apparently a chain but now all I want to eat is this lol. 

Day 13: 
Did a little morning work and then my colleague and I went to Devonport for the afternoon.  We walked around, got some souvenirs, some fancy (very delicious) chocolates from the Devonport Chocolate Company, and had a pint on the wharf.  Very lovely and a good way to end the week of work! 

Day 14: 
Travel back to Canada.  Rudely greeted by snow and 4:30PM sunsets. 

 
My partner and I really speed ran our time because he only had a week but we wanted to take advantage of the fact that we saved a good chunk of money on travel with my work.  I’m so glad we did! Everyone I met was so lovely and welcoming.  

A few more observations/general thoughts: 
- I really appreciate the emphasis put on keeping the natural environment healthy.  There was so little litter compared to most places I’ve been! 
- I want a pie or sausage roll and a flat white for breakfast every day now. 
- There were a lot of places that reminded me of Northwestern Ontario where I grew up and lived for a lot of my adult life (in the scenery).  I say this in the best way because I really do think the north shore of Lake Superior and northwestern Ontario - Manitoba border is one of the most beautiful places in the world.  
- I never had a bad meal.  Maybe one that was average, but honestly everything we ate was delicious! 
- Kiwis are amazing, lovely people and I can’t wait to come back and see the South Island! 
- You all are so trusting! Multiple places we stayed didn’t take a credit card deposit or just left the keys for us to grab! 
- We saw Canadian Geese! Are they as annoying there as they are here? lol (I say this lovingly to the geese lol) 

And a few thoughts that might help others: 
- Rent a car! It’s really nice to have the freedom. 
- Be prepared to change plans, whether it be due to weather/nature or you just find something you really want to do.  Get free cancellation options for hotels! 
- Take a night’s rest before driving, you don’t realize how tired you are until you hit the bed. 
- Driving on the left is very intuitive, you’ll get it quickly. 
- Take your time driving, use the slow car bays if there’s people behind you, and pull over if you’re not comfortably driving in the rain.  The highways are not like most, other than highway 1.  This is not an exaggeration! They are very very beautiful but require patience and calm. 
- Don’t knock the touristy stuff, it’s touristy for a reason! 
- Have some down time or time to just figure it out in the moment built in.  So much of the stuff I loved the most were things we found out about after we got to Aotearoa and we were able to do because we had planned some “we’ll figure it out then” time.  But of course book the things you really want to do so you don’t miss out! 


Overall, this was the best trip I’ve ever been on. Everything was honestly 10/10 - the nature, the people, the food.  We will be back :) 




Editing to add: I forgot to include going to Cathedral Cove! It was so beautiful.  Would recommended taking the earliest shuttle if you are doing that - or starting your trek early! We went early in the morning and there were only a few people there. ",2,1764029793.0,newzealand_travel,2,1.0,False
1p5xvd9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p5xvd9,[review] SABINO TORREFAÇÃO - Impressões finais após 4 pacotes.,"​P​eguei ​a​lguns pacotes da Sabino há cerca de ​3 meses, ​n​a compra coletiva​ do DDUCL. 

Agora que ​p​rovei todos, ​f​inalmente resolvi compartilhar minhas impressões finais sobre a torrefação e cada um dos cafés.

_____________

**Impressões gerais sobre os cafés da Sabino**
- No geral, adorei a experiência com a Sabino. Todos os cafés foram redondos, doces, fáceis de preparar e muito agradáveis.
- A impressão que mais me marcou na Sabino foi a “alta drinkability”. A xícara de todos os pacotes saíram muito fáceis de tomar. Principalmente o Helcio Pinto e Enivaldo Pereira, são cafés ​q​ue descem como água​!​ São xícaras pra tomar em 3 goladas kkk.
- Todos os cafés mostraram muito tolerantes à agitação e moagem fina (inclusive os super fermentados Eliza Lamounier e Vitor Marcelo Barbosa)​. É impressionante como raramente amargam ou ficam adstringentes. Foram cafés muito fáceis de preparar, mesmo variando temperatura e receita. 
​- Tanto o Eliza Lamounier quanto o Vitor Marcelo passaram por fermentações intensas, mas o resultado final é surpreendentemente limpo e equilibrado. A fermentação não aparece de forma agressiva ​(ambos acabam lembrando mais um natural do que um anaeróbico​/aeróbico intenso​). A torra da Sabino​ parece ter ajudado muito a domar essas características​ (ou talvez o longo tempo de descanso que usei, conforme comento mais a seguir).
- Acredito que ​e​sse perfil doce/redondo e a facilidade de fazer esses cafés seja reflexo direto da torra da Sabino​ - que parece atingir um ponto de equilíbrio excelente entre doçura, corpo e clareza. Não sei exatamente o que eles fazem na torra, mas funciona muito bem (e comento mais sobre isso no tópico a seguir).

_____________

**Comentários sobre a torra da Sabino (e comparação com Coffee Lab):**
- Senti que todos os cafés têm um “DNA” sensorial comum, uma nota recorrente de “calda de pudim” presente em todos. É como se houvesse um perfil de torra característico da Sabino, com esse caramelo suave (que confere xícaras leves, redondas, amigáveis e muito consistentes).
- Acho válido comparar com a torra do Coffee Lab, que sempre achei que tem uma ""assinatura"" muito recorrente de caramelo (tendendo pra torra média). A torra da Sabino não chega nesse ponto de ""caramelo intenso"" do Coffee Lab, mas sinto sim um perfil de torra característico (que vai pro caramelo suave e calda de pudim).
- Apesar de eu andar mais interessado em torras ultra claras, fiquei fã do perfil da Sabino. É uma torra que entrega muita facilidade de preparo e xícaras confortáveis, sem deixar de ser interessante.
- Alguém tem essas impressões sobre a torra deles? Tô viajando?

_____________

**Comentários sobre cada um dos cafés**


1) ​​**Hélcio Carneiro Pinto​** (Região​ Mantiqueira​ de Minas; Variedade Bourbon Amarelo​; Processo Cereja ​Descascado) ​(Notas sensoriais: ​Pê​ssego em calda, floral, fruta do café e carambola​​).
- Meu preferido dos quatro pacotes. Café redondíssimo, doce e fácil de tomar. ​Foram as xícaras que tomei mais rápido nesse ano, dava vontade de tomar litros.
​- Evoluiu muito com o descanso. Com torra fresca ele estava super doce​, destacando calda de pêssego. ​Com 3​-4 semanas ele ​f​icou menos doce, bem mais complexo​ e passou a destacar de forma evidente as notas de carambola. Eu cresci com um pé dessa fruta em casa e realmente essa nota estava super presente.
- Grão muito sensível às receitas: quanto mais você empurra a extração, mais ele destaca a carambola e umas notas meio exóticas, inclusive com risco de amargor; baixando temperatura para 88-90 e moendo mais grosso, ele fica mais doce, diminui as notas exóticas e destaca mais o pêssego em calda. Sensacional!
- Esse pacote acabou super rápido.


2) **Enivaldo Marinho Pereira​** ​(Região​ Cerrado Mineiro​; Variedade Pink Bourbon​; Processo​ Natural) (Notas sensoriais: Limão, chá preto e damasco​)
- Gostei muito desse café, quase no mesmo nível que Helcio Pinto. Também estava muito doce e redondo, facílimo de tomar!
- Um pouco mais difícil de extrair que o Helcio Pinto. Aqui você pode moer bem mais fino e aumentar a temperatura... ele dificilmente gera amargor.
- O sensorial desse café destaca mais damasco, com chá preto em segundo plano conferindo estrutura, e limão mais tímido dando complexidade pra xícara. 
- Gastei esse pacote tão rápido quanto o Hélcio Pinto, mas semana passada vi que ainda tinha uma dose dele! Depois de 3 meses da torra, ele ainda tava incrível (doce, redondo, leve...). mais um café de tomar litros!


​3) **Eliza Lamounier​** ​(Região​ Campos das Vertentes​; Variedade Para​íso​; Processo Aeróbico 48h​) (Notas sensoriais: Tangerina, anis estrelado, caju e caramelo​)
- Mesmo café “Vovó Candinha” lançado pela Mantí no SP Coffee Festival 2026. Mas só fui perceber isso depois que recebi o pacote kkk.
- Eu não gostei muito desse café no v60: as xícaras saíam leves, corpo baixo, meio vazio; sensorialmente, ele destaca mel e anis estrelado (e isso me dá um certo enjoo). Me arrependi de ter comprado esse pacote quando percebi que era o mesmo grão verde do Vovó Candinha.
- Por outro lado, como SOUP (na OXO Rapid Brewer) esse café brilhou! Ficou incrível, com corpo bem presente, dulçor agradável e bastante notas de caju em calda. Talvez o café que mais curti fazer na sopa até hoje!
- Quem aí pegou esse café na torra do Mantí ou Sabino, acharam ele enjoativo e difícil também? Felizmente encontrei a vocação desse café na sopa, caso contrário teria dificuldades para terminar.


4) **Vitor Marcelo Barbosa​**​ (Região Cerrado Mineiro​; Variedade Topázio​, Processo Anaeróbico 120h​) (Notas sensoriais: Frutas vermelhas, uva, abacaxi​ em calda e rum​)
- Arrependi de comprar esse pacote quando recebi, por medo da fermentação de 120h. Mas como cheguei tarde na compra coletiva e sobraram poucas opções, decidi pegar esse pelas notas, que me interessaram.
- Pelo meu desânimo com a fermentação longa, esse pacote ficou esquecido no armário. Demorei 3 meses (!) pra abrir. Pra minha surpresa, ele ainda está excelente! Não posso comparar com a torra fresca, mas imagino que as notas estivessem mais intensas.
- O meu medo da fermentação foi por água abaixo logo na primeira receita. A xícara saiu muito limpa, nada funky nem agressiva. Café leve, doce, redondo, com alguma acidez... me surpreendeu bastante, eu esperava algo completamente fora da casinha. 
- Certamente o longo tempo de descanso ajudaram a amaciar esse café, mas tenho a impressão de que ele seria fácil até com torra fresca. Quem aí tomou esse café fresco? Gostaram? Falem mais pq perdi a chance :(


​_____________


**​Balanço final:**

Sei que muita gente aqui já teve fases de amor e ódio com a Sabino​ - especialmente depois do crescimento deles, quando ​parece que começaram a surgir comentários sobre inconsistência na torra.​ ​Mas a minha experiência foi muito boa. ​​

Queria saber como têm sido as experiências mais recentes de vocês.​ Ainda estão sentindo altos e baixos? Ou acham que eles melhoraram e estabilizaram a qualidade?

Indo para os comentários finais, o único ponto que tenho a reclamar é sobre o **preço**. No ecommerce esses 4 pacotes teriam custado R$486,00 - pela compra coletiva saiu por R$301,00 (ambos os preços com frete). Sinceramente, eu acho caro... 

Apesar de ter adorado os cafés, minha conclusão é que a Sabino entrega um perfil mais confortável do que incrível. Por isso, gostaria muito que fossem cafés mais acessíveis. Alguns pacotes passam de R$140 ou mais... e nessa faixa eu prefiro economizar pra importar cafés da Tanat, People Possession e outras torrefações gringas que vão explodir a minha cabeça.

My buddies kid me about her, some people stare at us when we go into  building and resturauntd, but after 4 months of getting to know her I have no problems.   
The problem now with Thanksgiving coming up (T) wants me to haveThanksgiving with her parents. Yes meet her parents. My kids are eating with their spouses  so I either say yes or tell her no and be ready to explain why. 
Usually meeting the parents mean wanting to raise the level of the relationship. We have had 3 dates  in 5 month 
With several coffees and breakfast meets . We have had intercourse only twice recently.
No discussion about us in the future, just us now. I told (T) if there is hostility from her parents ,I not going to take rudeness. Discussion is fine. 
She said her parents aren""t like that. So I'll do old school. (T) has told me her father's favorite alcohol, and mom's favorite flowers. Well start the holiday with that.

I’m currently studying biology in order to become a physician assistant. I have worked at an animal research center and have photos of me interacting and scratching the bellies of monkeys. Even getting to name one while I was working there. 

Have a pet ball python named noodles but love all sorts of animals. I enjoy reading, physical activity, cooking, baking, nature walks, and lots more. Really just interested in lots of things and experiencing new things.

Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).

Ever feel like you're playing life on 'hard mode' by default? We're all trying to level up, but sometimes the days just blend together in a fog of to-do lists and ""shoulds.""

The idea of a ""life cheat code"" sounds like a fantasy, but I've realized it's not one big, secret button. **It's a series of small, daily optimizations.** It’s about being the intentional architect of your day, not just a passenger.

Think about it less like a massive overhaul and more like installing tiny, powerful plugins that run in the background. Things like:

*   **The First 20 Minutes:** Instead of grabbing your phone, you spend 20 minutes on something that fills *your* tank. Reading, stretching, journaling, just sitting with a coffee and your own thoughts. It sets the entire trajectory for your day.
*   **Energy Audits > Time Management:** Stop trying to cram more into your hours. Instead, figure out *when* you have peak brain power (your ✨🧠✅ moments) and protect that time for your most important work. Use the low-energy slumps for laundry, emails, and simple tasks.
*   **Scheduled Joy:** This sounds silly, but it's a game-changer. Put a 10-minute ""do nothing"" or ""listen to my favorite album"" block on your calendar. Joy isn't just the reward for productivity; it's the fuel for it.

The goal isn't to become a perfect, hyper-efficient robot. It's to create a system where you get your important stuff done *and* have more mental and emotional space left over to actually enjoy your life. That’s the real win.

Of course, sometimes the biggest drain on our productivity and joy isn't our schedule, it's our own internal static. The emotional baggage and mental blocks are the real final boss. If you're finding that's the part that's holding you back, getting a clear plan to navigate those feelings can make all the difference. I personally found that working through my own mindset hurdles was much easier with some structure, and **[this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme)** is fantastic for helping with that side of the equation.

So, let's share some notes. What's one small ""cheat code"" you've found that makes your day even 1% better?",1,1764029088.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

So...my boss has this habit of “joking around” by shaking people’s office chairs from behind. It’s not something he does frecuently, but he has done it to me and to another coworker before.

But, today, he did it at the worst possible moment...right when I was holding a full cup of coffee in front of my personal laptop. Because of the sudden shake, the entire cup spilled onto the keyboard and the laptop's keyboard, slowly died. The rest of the laptop works fine.

He did apologize, but toned it down because I was visibly angry at him. And I feel bad about it.

Since the laptop was completely unusable, he bought me a new MacBook to replace the one he damaged. I didn’t ask for anything, he simply replaced what he broke.

Here’s where things get messy:

The new MacBook came with a brand new charger. My old charger was already unsafe because its prongs had been bent during a previous incident at work.

So, I ""gave"" the old broken laptop to my boss (the one he ruined with the coffee), even though it was mine. I figured whatever, the important thing was having a working device.

But now he’s demanding the new charger that came with the replacement laptop.

It feels like his logic is: “I bought you the new laptop, so the charger belongs to me unless you give it back.”

He wants to keep both the broken laptop and the brand-new charger and I’m being unreasonable for refusing.

So, long story short:

He broke my laptop because of a prank.

The replacement was supposed to fix his mistake, not create a new problem where I have no charger.

The idea of him keeping my broken laptop and the new charger feels really off.

It feels like he is turning a situation he caused into a negotiation where he gets to benefit.

*Edit:* 

*Just to clarify: he also broke my old charger. Last year I lent it to him so he could charge his phone, and the outlet was behind his chair. When he pushed the chair back, the charger’s prongs bent badly. I told him about it, he brushed it off.*

So in both cases, the damage came directly from him. None of this was wear and tear or my fault.

Sorry if it's a long story. I'm still feeling between sad and angry because it was my own laptop that I bought with my hard earned money! I know things can be replaced, but it's something that shouldn't happend to anyone...",3,1764028675.0,AITAH,16,1.0,False

We will both be covering utilities (just Gas & Electricity). For the rent, you will be paying a lowered portion of the full amount, since the room I have left is less big than mine. Your room has wall-mounted hanging (which I believe can be taken away if you prefer), a street-facing window (Abt 4 ft high) of stained glass (obscured visibility looking in).

I will be asking for a deposit from you, one month of your rental price, which will be given back when you leave, like standard.

If you are interested, please feel free to comment or respond in messages directly! I am canvasing anyone interested now, so I can choose someone who'll be a reliable roomie and who's likely to get along with me.",1,1764028547.0,berkeley,0,1.0,False

Since LA’s cost of living seems similar to what I’m already dealing with, I’m wondering if the move would make more sense in terms of opportunities, lifestyle, and day to day environment.

I work in retail and coffee shops, and I’d most likely continue in those fields. I’m looking at busy areas like The Grove, West Hollywood, Century City, Hollywood, Santa Monica, and Glendale.

My question is:  
Which neighborhoods would locals recommend for someone my age who plans to work retail/coffee in those areas, and who wants to live close enough that commuting isn’t a nightmare?

**Quirk: ""Quirk Dealer""** \- Allows him basically when shaking hands with someone and with their consent to give and/or take a quirk. If person has several can't take all - yes or yes has to go one by one. Even saying yes to something ambiguous counts as consent. Can store and use quirks he takes, though can only use ones he has up to what his body supports. Quirk has natural immunity to other theft quirks.

**Stored Quirks:** ""Smoke"" (allows controlling smoke he exhales if smokes); ""Acclimate"" (allows using current climate to advantage - like if sunny increase sun rays received in area, if storm use lightning, etc.); ""Vision"" (allows vision to alternate between various modes - normal, night, heat, electromagnetic, infrared and even see spirits); ""Salt"" (allows controlling all salt in 80 mtr radius); ""Regen-exchange"" (allows taking matter from other things to regenerate wounds, excessive use can lead to extreme fatigue, nausea and migraines); ""Gravity"" (can increase gravity in area, larger area less can increase, maximum can increase is to 15 times Earth gravity); ""Necromancer"" (allows for up to 30 minutes resurrecting and commanding any corpse touched, regardless of death time); ""Force Dilater"" (allows being capable of any force made or received redirecting to another side, though doesn't nullify impact damage, only reduces to half); ""Increasing Rate"" (allows increasing punch strength x1.5 after giving consecutive punch from another, multiplications can accumulate, but if multiplies too much body doesn't hold it and can't leave it accumulated - if doesn't give punch after maximum 2 seconds from another, accumulated goes); ""Advanced Cure"" (gives very accelerated healing factor, to point of healing ruptures and fractures in minutes, though doesn't regenerate things, so if loses arm or such doesn't reconstruct, only if still there heals); ""Thinker"" (allows when breathing deeply accelerating thinking 10 times for 20 seconds); ""Tanooki"" (allows changing appearance to another and of other things temporarily, though only tangible illusion not altering strength); ""Steel Feet"" (gives layer on front part of each foot as hard as steel); ""Bone"" (can create bone structures and figures in hands, though consume much calcium and iron); ""Inventory"" (allows storing in unique space only accessible with this quirk, able to store up to 2304 mtr² total); ""Stats"" (allows accessing interface only he can see with physical statistics, measured in number from 1 to 10000, able to change points from one and give to another - like removing 20 points from impact strength and giving to reaction speed); ""Psychic"" (gives telekinesis capable of maximum lifting something 150 times his weight); ""Disable Touch"" (allows deactivating quirk of whoever touches for maximum 10 minutes and can only disable one quirk at time - if someone has more than one quirk has to think which quirk to deactivate because can only deactivate one of those they have); ""Parrot"" (allows perfectly imitating voice of any person as long as already heard that person's voice); ""Teleknow"" (allows teleporting only himself to place already been before and remembered); ""Finger Beam"" (allows launching lasers from tip of each body finger, maximum going through titanium); ""Copper"" (allows controlling all copper in 200 mtr radius); ""Persuade"" (allows anyone listening attentively for at least 5 minutes able to convince more easily); ""Cigarette"" (allows creating cigarettes in hands, maximum can create 5000 per day); ""Soldier Fingers"" (allows generating tremendous heat and flame at hand fingertips, flame reaching up to 450°C); ""Flight"" (allows flying as long as has place to propel from to start flying and can fly for up to 30 minutes straight) and ""Coil"" (allows converting feet into springs). Also has one of super strength, resistance and greater speed.

**Personality:** Someone theatrical, intelligent, somewhat manipulative, charismatic, secretive, discreet, creative and somewhat passive and patient but when angered is intense and somewhat terrifying.

**Background:** He's man who since birth was very peculiar, loving investigating others' quirks from age 5, discovering what his quirk was at 5, accidentally taking quirk from best friend (name is Yasukatei Hikarichikara and quirk was ""Light,"" able to create solid structures of sunlight) though after that returned it. Many classmates feared him for his abilities, but his friend stayed with him, being only person he appreciated, because his home was broken with alcoholic unemployed father and stressed mother who worked all day, so wasn't raised with much love from their part.

But after they graduated (meaning his friend and him, from middle school) something fateful happened. In villain attack who were All For One lackeys, his friend resulted injured and died. This left him devastated, though swore would make that villain who was mastermind pay for death. Escaping home, making false identity, starting to enter underworld. Though was very discreet, staying in law margins, taking advantage of each legal loophole. After time, was in front of All For One himself, shaking hand and asking if he was All For One. When answering yes, simply would take a quirk. Though couldn't track All For One's own quirk, could take regeneration quirk. After that using ""teleknow"" quirk, would go to his home, leaving All For One with memory of his face, holding grudge and sending to look for him (wasn't successful) for deceiving him.

After months, All For One's defeat by All Might occurred, but he stayed active, being seller in underworld who sells quirks, not with bad intentions, just takes advantage nothing prohibits him, however unethical. Though seeing USJ and Nomu there, saw had more than one quirk, so deduced AFO was still active. Would track him. Actually would appear briefly in Kamino incident, launching from afar lightning at AFO after appearing physically and after that withdrew from there.

Later, after Paranormal Liberation War, public revelation of One For All and hearing of green-haired student escaping from U.A., would go look for him. Would find Deku successfully, trying to convince to give quirk. Though for obvious reasons seeing him and knowing rumors of someone who takes and sells quirks would be alert, even more when with ""vision"" quirk would manage to see OFA vestiges, talking with them a bit. Though after that would say his offer - would give quirk, but in exchange wouldn't give any or such, but only wants something, said in own words ""I'll give you support quirk, one that will serve you tremendously, but I'll only ask something in return, make All For One disappear forever from Earth's face, then, is it a deal?\~"" finally managing to convince Deku, shaking hand and passing ""advanced cure"" quirk. Though this when passing to Deku as such instead of integrating to OFA, wouldn't appear in vestiges space, being similar to original energy accumulation quirk user. But after that only left.

Later, in final war seeing what happened to heroes with AFO when started using rewind, only sighed, told himself ""Argh... if you want something done, do it yourself..."" After that went and directly confronted AFO, using all his quirks at maximum, giving everything. But since doesn't have much experience in actual combat, would end up losing and be killed by AFO. Though would die looking him in eyes and defiant, knowing did what could at least. Last thought before dying was ""Well... this is the end... finally I'll see you again, my love, Yasukatei..."" After that gave last breath.

**Appearance:** A man of normal build, white, with green eyes, short gray hair, and 1.89 m tall.

**Favorite Songs:** The Other Side (Hugh Jackman and Zac Efron), Ashes (Stellar) and Enemy (Tommee Profitt, Beacon Light and Sam Tinnesz)

**Fun Facts:** Often smokes for fun, not affecting him much due to healing quirks; loves being theatrical, liking being charismatic; doesn't interest him evil but neither good, being gray so to speak; loves drinking bitter coffee; has ability to easily imitate movements of whoever sees for short time; at school got grades of pure 10s/A+s/100s (depending how you grade).

* **Meteor Shower:** Uses ""flight"" to start flying, ""psychic"" to grab rubble pieces, ground or anything on hand and if none uses ""bone"" to create them, ""salt"" to cover with salt then uses ""stats"" to maximize strength and speed, ""gravity"" to increase gravity and fall with more force, ""steel feet"" to kick forcefully, ""increasing rate"" to increasingly increase strength to send them and ""tanooki"" to make them invisible.

Not the special occasion stick you break out for celebrations, but the one you reach for on a regular Tuesday when you just want a solid smoke.

Mine: Padron 2000 Natural

I know, I know - not the most exciting answer. But hear me out. I've been smoking cigars for about 3 years now, tried a ton of different brands and profiles. Some are amazing but too complex for when I'm just trying to relax. Others are cheap enough to smoke daily but leave me wanting more. The Padron 2000 hits that sweet spot where it's good enough that I'm never disappointed, but consistent enough that I know exactly what I'm getting.

Why it's always in my humidor:

Reliable as hell - I've never had a bad one. Construction is always on point, burn is even, draw is perfect. When I only have an hour to smoke, I don't want to deal with touch-ups or fighting a tight draw.

Flavor profile that doesn't get boring - It's not super complex, but there's enough going on (nuts, cream, bit of pepper) that I'm not zoning out halfway through. Also pairs well with coffee or bourbon depending on time of day.

Price point makes sense - Yeah, I could smoke cheaper sticks daily, but I'd enjoy them less. And yeah, I could smoke pricier ones, but then it stops being a casual thing and becomes an event. This sits right in that ""treat myself without overthinking it"" range.

Short smoke time - 45 minutes to an hour. Perfect for after work or weekend mornings without eating up my whole afternoon.

I usually order a box or two at a time. Easier than making constant trips to my B&M. Plus I found pretty much the entire Padron lineup if I want to mix it up with a 3000 or step up to a 1964 for the weekend.

So... What's YOUR always-in-stock cigar? The one you buy in bulk because you know you're going to smoke it regularly? Have you always had the same go-to, or has it changed as your palate developed? Because I'm wondering if I'll still be reaching for these in another few years or if I'll eventually rotate to something else.

Also interested to hear from people who keep multiple go-tos for different moods/times of day. Do you have like a ""morning stick"" vs ""evening stick"" situation going on?",4,1764027955.0,cigar,5,1.0,False

I definitely had doubts about the location but I am actually really glad we stayed somewhere quieter, away from tourist crowds to unwind after a long day. 

The bathrooms were the highlight, it’s like a mini spa and onsen. Bath salt, bath robes and traditional robe provided. There’s a shower stool for sitting. And even a comfy stool to sit in front of the sink and mirror. 

I don’t find the interiors dated, in fact it feels like a modernized boutique ryokan vibe. So it’s a pretty timeless aesthetic. Everything feels very spacious for Japanese hotel standards. 

Taxi to Kyoto station is only around $10, and one of the trips is paid for by the hotel. The instructions were a bit ambiguous but once you get out of Kyoto Station, go across the street to MK VIP Taxi Stand and wait for a taxi. After arriving at the hotel, ask the concierge for a ticket to give to the driver. 

We weren’t able to see the free Maiko performance (it’s only on select dates - Tues, Thu, Sun) but if you decide to stay there I’d suggest picking a timeframe that includes one of those dates. 

There was a reading lounge in the basement, I wish I had known about it as I would have gone there to read some books when I woke up in the middle of the night from jetlag. Most books were Japanese but many are art or photography books. 

The only downside I experienced was that there’s no free snacks or drinks in the room, the minibar is all paid items, even the tea bags and juice… but they do have a Nespresso coffee machine which I think is complimentary, and free water. 

Overall if you are looking for a zen, peaceful hotel i recommend it! ",10,1764027233.0,hyatt,8,0.86,False
1p5wwgc,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1p5wwgc/i_would_love_to_approach_a_girl_thats_cute_in_my/,I would love to approach a girl that's cute in my eyes by handing her a written message,"Hey there, I'm a 25 yo student. I spend 85% of my day at the library. Beside studying, I talk a little bit with friends and acquaintances. These are my last couple of months in this place, because I should gradute in med school, so I wanna enjoy as much as possible.

I have some experiences with girls, but I'm not so proud of them... I'm a mess, but I'm trying to improve...

So, there's this cute girl at my library. She has these sweet looking red hairs, that give her this kind of funny appearance.

I've been observing her a little the couple last weeks, not stalking, just to clarify. She seems a little bit shy and somehow reserved, she doesn't interact much with people, most of the time she has headphones and of course she's studying.

A couple of days ago I tried to interact with her, by taking it slowly. We were sitting in 2 tables close to each other. As an excuse I asked her for a pen. Yeah, it may sound dumb, but that was my chance to break the ice a little bit and it seemed the only thing I could do. She had headphones, so it took her a couple of seconds to notice me. But she gave it to me. After giving it back to her, I said thank you and gave her a thumbs up (yeah, it was awkward), since she smiled to me with her headphones on, so non-verbal communication was the only thing I could try. That's ok, at least I tried, since just to ask for a pen I've been thinking like 20 minutes. I was somehow proud of me and it didn't seem so scary hahaha

I didn't force the interaction and I didn't want to make her uncomfortable. 

After this I've tried sometimes to give her a little eye contact the next couple of days when she was passing by (just to clarify - I wasn't looking at her like a maniac). My intention was just to smile or say hello. But she looks at me 0,2 seconds and turns around.

I would love to giver her a short message and keep it super quick, by walking up to her table, hand the message to her directly, give a small, authentic smile, as I do with others and just say something like, ""Hi, I didn't want to interrupt your studying, but I wanted to give you this. Good luck!"" Then, walk away immediately.

On the message I would write something like ""Hi, I'm BoricAcidTaster, I notice you around a lot, and I think you're really cute (I love your red hair!). If you'd ever be interested in grabbing a quick coffee from the machine, my Instagram is BoricAcidTaster. No pressure at all if you're not interested, but I had to try. Good luck with your studying!""

It seems somehow romantic (?), not that pressuring and it allows me to break to work around the shyness and headphones barrier...

But I feel so embarassed just thinking at it. I don't know. But it's probably even worse to not try, since I'm not a creep and I would definitely keep it somehow discreet.

Since then, I’ve been fortunate enough to have people to exchange with, and I’d like to see if I can find that again.

I’m looking for someone that I first and foremost have a connection with. I want to actually get to know my penpal. Location doesn’t matter as much, as who that person is defines whether I’d like to engage with them or not. I do have a preference for cultural exchange in which we can be introduced to different and new things. But, whether you’re my state or half the world away, it’s you, the person, I want to exchange with.

I'm interested in both a physical exchange, with my preference being letters and items, and a digital e-mail exchange. Due to the private nature of penpalling, however, I want us to actually chat a bit and get to know each other before diving right into those physical aspects of it. Let’s become familiar with each other to make sure we’re a good fit. I'm open to an e-mail exchange more readily.

So, who am I exactly? And who are you?

I'm 35, male, and live in the US (ET time zone). Thoroughly introverted, but bold and open when the mood strikes and with those who can tap into that aspect of me. I’m designed for the slow burn and deliberation of written conversation, hence the lure of elongated methods of communication.

In regards to MBTI, I first tested as INTJ during my teens and continued to primarily test as it into my 30s. More recently, I sometimes get INFJ. I've also gotten INTP and ISTJ before.

Incremental exchange and a mutual creation is what I default to, but I've gone to the ends of the earth on a whim with the right person before. I adore abstract minds that get idiosyncrasy and whimsy. Compatibility is a strange thing, though, that feels most real when it’s too fluid to be defined. I sort of have a thing for making connections work that otherwise shouldn't.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I’m an autodidact who’s been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I’ve been young. I’m most infatuated with the nature and function of reality, and particularly human perception. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that a lack of limitation is highly limiting.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also adore writing conversationally, from mundane chats to lengthy letters, often permeated with a dim poetic glow. Photography also has a hold on me, and I hope to do more than just dabble in it.

I like burning incense, time pieces, archiving and organization, collecting, and coffee. I’m always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies. I so probably have more I take for granted.

Let's chat and see where things go. Leave your hesitations and take the chance.",1,1764027065.0,infjpenpals,0,1.0,False

I was cruising Kijiji drinking my morning coffee and came accross this unit in the images below. It came with all sorts of things, got all of this for $20 from an older gentleman who said it works but he does not have the patience for it. I wanted a coreXY machine for a while now and thought about building a Voron. That's what got me in my truck and off to buy this thing. I said to myself ""Well the extrusions are worth $20 even if the rest is junk"" Looking at it, it appears everything is here to melt some plastic. Does anyone have any idea of this was once a kit or is this a DIY'er design? 

  
What should I do with it next? I am not certain I want to wire it all up and see what transpires. If I did go that route any tips or advice on how to test as I go to make sure everything is working as it should, I'm not keen on burning the house down. 

My thoughts are I would like to update this and make it 2025 worthy any advice there? If anyone knows anything about this kit if it was a kit I'd love the documentation.

# Training

I've been running since I was a teen (so for like 15-20 years) and probably taking it seriously/racing for about the last 10. Between 2016 and 2018 I doubled down on my training and saw a bunch of PRs and a BQ (HM PR: 1:39 and marathon PR: 3:27). But starting with the pandemic and then from there a string of personal challenges/changes/a surgery etc, I had (until this summer) put any formal training on the back burner. I never stopped running during that period but mileage wasn't consistent, I made time for other forms of exercise, and I certainly wasn't doing any quality sessions--really just going out there a few to several times a week a doing what felt good (usually 4-8 miles at a medium-ish pace).

This summer I signed up for the Philly half, took a deep breath and emailed the coach I was working with in 2016-18. She built me an 18 week plan that peaked at 49 miles (with a 15 mile long run) but most of the time mileage was high 30's-mid 40s. Most weeks were structured as follows:

Monday: Rest // Tuesday: Speed or Tempo (or in the earlier portion hill repeats or some combo of hills/speed intervals) // Wednesday: Easy // Thursday: Speed or Tempo or Hills (whatever wasn't happening on Tues) // Fri and Sat: Easy // Sunday: Long run -- every 3rd week or so the long run was a progression run with last x miles (anywhere from 2-6) at HMP.

Some speed workouts that came up often were 1k and 2k repeats and workouts that were a combo platter of short hill repeats and 100m strides.

The summer was hot and it also became clear that my hobby jogging the past several years was not holding a candle to real structured training. The first 8-9 weeks kicked my ass. And then like magic -- the thing that keeps me coming back to this silly little endeavor happened -- i started to adapt, had some really good tempo runs and workouts started to feel challenging-but-in-a-good-way again. At about 4-5 weeks out, I did a 10k (not a distance I'm super experienced with) just because it'd been so long since I'd really raced. My time was just sub-48, which was disappointing and humbling but it was helpful to have a baseline and to have practice going to a place where you consider bailing and sticking it out.

Otherwise, training was pretty uneventful in a good way. I was able to do pretty much every run on my schedule (maybe 1 or 2 easy's had to be skipped and i think I cut the cool down on a workout or two by a mile). Oddly, during the taper, several hours after my 10 mile run 1 week before the race, I developed quadriceps tedinopathy but thankful PT came through with some exercises that really cleared things up quickly (although left my quads sorer than I would have liked during the taper).

# Pre-race

Took the train from NYC to Philly on Friday afternoon and headed to hotel and expo to pick up bib. I will be honest I've run more races than I can probably count at this point -- some huge, others tiny and everywhere in between. I think I can say with confidence that I have never seen an expo more poorly run. The organizers emailed weeks before the race asking runners to reserve a spot for packet pick-up but upon arriving to the expo on Friday afternoon (at my designated time slot), there was a line that stretched down many many blocks, with 100s of people in front and behind me (even saw someone say they had to skip their race because they showed up at their designated time and after an hour of waiting had to go to work). Once I FINALLY got inside (after an hour outside), there was another line to get to the bib collection area, and then a third to actually go up and retrieve the bib. Once I finally got my bib a volunteer asked me about picking up my race shirt and then pointed me to the back of ANOTHER line. I bailed immediately and left without the shirt. After that saga, I had a meal that centered heavily around rice and was asleep around 10pm.

Morning of I forced down a dry cinnamon raisin bagel (as is customary), some coffee and water. It was raining around 6am when I headed through security and started to warm up and I promptly stepped in what I thought was mud but was actually a poop soup puddle up to my ankles (guess we're running with wet socks and shoes today girlie!). Took a Maurten gel about 20 mins before the start and got into my corral.

# Race

**MILES 1–2:**  
Honestly, I was nervous (for kind of the whole race tbf). I've run a couple races over the past couple years but mostly for fun and they've all been undertrained. This was the first time in a long time I was putting myself to the test and I didn't really have a great sense for what my training would translate to fitness-wise. The first mile I feel like I was just checking in mentally--how's the pace, am I going out too fast, am I getting carried away, how do I want to settle in? The course was flat for the early miles and there was some good crowd support towards the start. I saw my husband  around 1K and tucked in near a group that I heard say were shooting to run 8 flats and saw hugging tangents. My watch read **8:12.** A touch slow, but honestly I was more concerned about getting ahead of myself than going out too slow.  
Mile 2 is kind of a blur. I *think* we were around the historic part of Philly but I have zero real memory—just nerves and constant check-ins. I do remember seeing a sub-8 split and thinking “okay cool.”  
Watch: **7:51**.

**MILES 3–4:**  
Miles 3 and 4 were more intrusive thoughts and blocking out whatever I probably should have been taking (in doing this recap I realize I was more nervous than I even realized, and hope next race I can relax a bit more).  A nice woman told me she was looking to go 1:45 and asked me if she could hang on with me for a bit, saying  I looked ""strong and confident"" (I have no idea why, but I get this somewhat often from strangers at races, and it was especially comical this time considering i was not really feeling strong OR confident).  
Somewhere between 2–3 I slipped at the first water station— a combo of wet roads and a runner stopping short. I've never fallen in a race and I didn't face plant but I did wipe out a little. I recovered quickly but it definitely felt rattled. A nice guy checked on me, and I got back into rhythm.  
Mile 4 had the first tiny hint of incline but it wasn't anything notable. The next few splits were sub-8s which felt decent but again, I wasn't sure about fitness and knew hills were awaiting me.  
Watch readings: **7:52**, **7:56**.

**MILES 5–6:**  
Between 4–5 I tried my ever-loving best to settle. This part of the course had fun energy, which usually I feed off of, but couldn't quite be present during this race. I was still even on pace (or whatever rough idea I had about it at least) but was definitely feeling antsy knowing hills were coming and really wanting to avoid blowing up. Between 5–6 I kind of blacked out again—just hyper-focused on staying controlled and bracing for what was ahead buy also started looking for my friends who were going to be near the 10k-ish mark.  
Watch readings: **7:56**, **8:00**.

**MILE 7:**  
Walnut Street (Miles 6–7) was absolutely LIT. The crowds were wild and it was definitely rockstar treatment. Even though I didn’t physically *feel* the boost (see aforementioned dissociation), clearly I got one because this mile was a tough faster. I saw my friends around 6.5, tossed my gloves to them, and had the fleeting thought of “should I tap out? and just hang with my friends” and reminded myself that no, I was just counting myself out because I was nervous about disappointing myself /falling short of goals.  Onward to the bridge across the Schuylkill which meant Hill City was about to begin.  
Watch: **7:50**.

**MILE 8:**  
Hills have always been a stronger point for me, but specifically I do not like running bridges (incline, exposed to the elements, never any crowd support). This one wasn't bad--definitely noticed it but it wasn't unending and it was a gradual, steady incline. Not awful, but enough to spike vigilance because fatigue was already creeping in earlier than I’d hoped. I reminded myself to use the downhills and trust that I’m decent on hills. Took a gel just before the first (i think?) big climb and accidentally hit a guy with the packet trying to throw it into a trashcan. I apologized, he teased me about it, before pulling ahead…temporarily.  
Watch: **7:57**.

**MILE 9:**  
The first real hill -- 34th Street. Long, steady, with steep sections mixed in. I felt okay-ish, still nervous, but when the gel-packet guy faded behind me I decided to take that as a tiny “yeah, okay, hills *are* your thing” reminder (don't know that I necessarily felt that way through the rest of the race though). We hit Mile 9 entering the park and I braced myself, knowing more hills were coming.  
Watch: **8:03**.

**MILE 10:**  
This is where things went from tough to flat-out gritty (the race photos from this section are something to behold--everyone's faces are twisted up messes of exhaustion and a guy running beside me has his finger pointed to his head miming self-harm in one photo). We entered the park which just meant fewer crowds and more climbing. Passed the 15K mark and told myself I’d see my friends again in 5K…whatever that meant…ugh fine, three miles. The hills here were long and demoralizing. You couldn’t see the end of most of them, and one didn’t even give a downhill because you immediately turned at the top. Saw a sign that said “Forward is a pace” and repeating this over and over is basically what kept me alive and at least somewhat engaged/not fully checked out.  
Watch: **8:09** (whatever, at this point I'd be happy to just finish).

**MILE 11:**  
Probably the physically and mentally roughest stretch. Another brutal hill, a couple people around me, who looked strong for most of race, dropped/stopped/walked, and the thought of joining them was enticing. Debated skipping the last water station but wasn't NOT thirsty, then debated Nuun as some sort of energy boost but remembered it doesn’t have much real sugar and could cramp me, which was the last thing I needed. Grabbed water and at this point really just trying to stay in it.  
Watch: **8:07**.

**MILE 12:**  
Between 11–12 I only remember hanging on. Somewhere in there we finally got a long downhill off Fountain Green onto Kelly Drive. I let the hill carry me, and tried to bank some time--even though I knew it was destroying my legs in a different way. Letting the downhill do the work for me kind of worked, and I briefly convinced myself the last mile+ would be manageable.  
Watch: **7:52**.

**MILE 13(+):**  
Passed the 12 mile marker --one more mile (+0.1…+ the extra .17–.20 of added distance from swerving etc, I had calculated). I knew I’d see my friends again around 20K and fantasized about just running into their embrace and crying instead of doing the last 1000 meters or so.  Another small(er) incline before the 20K marker (very cool guys thanks!). and then the crowds thickened. Finally saw friends and made the universal “yuck, I am suffering” face. Husband yelled “dig deep!” and I tried, but with the state of my legs after hill planet... I *needed* to see the finish to commit to a real kick.  
There were so many flags and banners that I kept thinking “is THAT the finish?” but no one in front of me appeared to be stopping. I did insane desperate watch-math until I finally saw it and dug as deep as I possibly could because I thought maybe I could eek out something that started with 1:45.  
I crossed the line and I *thought* I saw 1:46-- felt proud anyway, official time was actually 1:45:and change, even better.

Watch: **7:58** for Mile 13, **7:01** pace for the final stretch

Post Race

Not in the 1:43-1:44 zone I thought I might be able to clinch but the back half of the race felt brutal and while I always have a ""time to start bargaining with a higher power you don't even really believe in"" portion in my races its usually at about the 80% mark-- this race was closer to the 50% mark. I wish this was a training cycle that lead to shocking improvement that blew my expectations out of the water, but instead I *think* it was probably reflective of a reasonable and realistic amount of progress, and I think I raced to my potential (as evidenced by my bargaining and the state of my quads 2 days later). I'm really proud of myself for hanging tough and leaning in when I wanted to check out, and not letting perfect be the enemy of good or giving up on myself. I'm also proud of my recommitment to training and finding out I still enjoy it even if I'm not in PR territory currently.  I'm excited to keep pushing (United half in March is next) and see if my body --6 years older and probably heavier, more stressed etc-- can get back to fitness levels in my mid-20s (or beyond?). I love running but what I *really* love it training, and diving back into the color-coded training plans and discipline just reignited my love for the grind.

Outside of my personal feelings about the day, the race itself was really wonderful (minus the expo disaster). Was concerned about security but it was a breeze, the weather for the actual race was great (stopped raining RIGHT before the start of the race), the crowds were TOP TIER (especially considering that I imagine the marathon has more people running and is probably the main event). I'm of the mind that all race medals and swag are cringy and tacky, but as far as cringy and tacky goes, this one was on the cooler side and unique to Philly.  The volunteers were friendly and helpful, and the start and finish areas were well run and felt legit, and it was really easy to navigate to/from if staying in a hotel in Center City. It was also awesome that Dakota Popein, Jared Ward and Lauren Fleshman were all there running too!

Overall, despite the fact that the hills are still very much haunting my dreams a few days later and the expo debacle had me real-time rage texting just about anyone who was available, I'd definitely recommend the race.",0,1764026997.0,AdvancedRunning,4,0.5,False

1p5wqjw,https://i.redd.it/2im8fe2bha3g1.jpeg,Amy’s Diary — Monday: Who on Earth Is D. B. Cooper?!,"Dear Diary,
Today my brain got stuck on one name the whole day:

> D. B. Cooper.



It sounds like a movie character… but he’s actually a real mystery. 😳


---

It started in History class.
Miss Clarice was talking about famous events from the 20th century, and one of the boys at the back raised his hand and said,
“Teacher, is it true there was a guy who hijacked a plane and just… disappeared with the money?”

The whole class went, “HUH?!”

Miss Clarice nodded and said,
“Yes, that’s the case people often call the D. B. Cooper mystery. It happened many years ago. It’s also still unsolved.”

Unsolved.
Plane.
Parachute.
Missing money.

My curiosity went from 0 to 100 immediately.


---

At recess, everyone was talking about it.

Kira said, “Maybe he secretly became a barista at Coffee Day.”
Penny argued, “No way, he probably changed his name and lives in a cabin with ten cats.”
Carmen from the other class added, “I saw a documentary clip about him once. It was kinda scary but cool.”

I didn’t say much, but my brain kept replaying what I imagined:
A mysterious man, stormy night, airplane, suitcase, parachute, poof, gone.

By the time the last bell rang, I was dying to know more.
And when I want answers, there’s only one person to go to.


---

🧠 Ask-Gillian Mode: ON

At home, Gillian was at the dining table with her laptop and three thick books (typical).
I dropped my schoolbag and asked,
“Gillian, who is D. B. Cooper?”

She pushed her glasses up and looked at me like a professor.
“Ah. That case.”

Then she closed her laptop a bit — which means story time.

She explained it in her “genius but still nice to younger siblings” way:

Many years ago, a man bought a ticket under the name Dan Cooper.

He hijacked a plane, said he had a bomb, and demanded money.

The plane landed, he got the ransom, then made the pilots take off again.

Somewhere in the sky, he parachuted out… and after that, no one could find him.

The FBI searched for years, but the full truth was never found.


“People still don’t know who he really was or what exactly happened after he jumped,” Gillian said.
“It’s one of those mysteries that stays in history because it’s unsolved.”

My eyes were huge.
“That sounds like a movie!”

Gillian nodded. “Yes, but remember, it was also a crime and really dangerous. Nobody should romanticize hijacking.”
She looked at me seriously.
“Cool mystery to study, terrible idea to copy. Understand?”

I saluted. “Yes, ma’am. I like living too much.”


---

Later, Melissa passed by and heard us.
She said, “If I ever made a garden mystery book, D. B. Cooper would just be a guy who disappeared into a sunflower field.”
Nina laughed. “Or he parachuted into Coffee Day and never left.”

Even Mom joined in at dinner.
She said, “Some mysteries stay mysteries forever. That’s what keeps the historians and storytellers busy.”

I kinda like that idea.
Scary, but… fascinating.
It made me realize history isn’t just boring dates and dusty pages — it’s like a giant puzzle full of weird stories, solved and unsolved.

Maybe next time I go to the library, I’ll ask Dr. Wren if there’s a book about famous mysteries like that.
I bet she knows a whole shelf of them.

1p5wono,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1p5wono/anyone_on_the_outside_reading_this/,Anyone on the outside reading this?,"I would give an account of how long I’ve been here except I have no idea. Time isn’t right here, nor is anything else.



The large office space with dozens of cubicles. There’s always someone typing, someone on the phone. The clicking of keyboards occasionally mixed with the sound of hushed conversation.



I know I haven’t always been here. I can remember the outside world, and so can everyone else. But we never leave. There is no time in this place, no end of shift, no clock out.



That’s not to say there are no clocks; there are. They are just meaningless. The ones mounted on the far wall don't even have numbers; the hands just tick around empty spaces.



The computers aren’t any better. The numbers displayed are utterly meaningless and random. Sometimes, never changing, other times changing too fast to process.



We do get breaks, though. I couldn’t tell you how we know when it’s time except that it stops being work time. Then we get to do something else. We don’t have many options. A bathroom break is always a good option. Sometimes, if you go to the breakroom, you can find something to eat in a container with your name on it in the fridge. There are, of course, the vending machines. Someone always has spare change, and sometimes I do.



Most people just stand there awkwardly, making small talk until it’s time to go back to work. Stretching out their stiff legs and trying to be a living animal for a little while.



We don’t have to work. We have the whole internet available to us. The old folk often sneakily play solitaire when they think no one is looking. Some watch TV. One younger man even figured out how to download video games. Though no one besides him is ever online at all. We all have our distractions.



Eventually, though, you do find yourself working. Crossing I’s and dotting T’s, sometimes you get to draw a little line and make an L. Some people work with numbers instead. Adding up random numbers into totals only to have to do it all over again, but backwards.



Things aren’t by any means terrible. We never get sleepy, and when we start getting tired, we get a break. But it’s just… never-ending. There’s nothing to truly do, no way for us to leave. I don’t even know if there are people out there to read this post. Anyone else in the office reading this, do say “Hello.”



All the other doors just lead to more office space with more cubicles. There’s no way to tell the time. There are no windows anywhere. No stairs or elevators. Just more of this place. Every cubicle is a little different, a hint of humanity in this bland, liminal, unending space. Some are perfectly normal, others are unfashionably bizarre. Some are simply horrifying.



I haven’t dared to venture too far. I don't want to get lost and lose my cubicle. It’s the only personalized thing I have here. A photo of my family, a pack of gum that always seems to be full, and a stress ball that always comes back no matter how far I throw it.



I’ve tried doing everything else to pass the time. One can only stare at a computer for so long. But there just isn’t anything to do. Time only stays still as long as you observe it.



I spent an eternity drawing a large mural with pens. Then I blinked, and it was gone. We tried playing office games once, but everyone had to blink eventually, and then everything just went back to how it was. It’s like every piece of this space is its own time, all jumbled together inside a blender. We can only hold spaces together for so long before they fly apart. Except there doesn’t seem to be an end.



There are a few phone chargers we pass around. But no one outside of the office ever responds to texts or calls. I hope my family is well. It’s either been lifetimes since I’ve seen them or maybe simply moments. None of it means anything here.



Then there are the managers. Those pulsing masses of incandescent flesh are best avoided. No one is really sure what they want. But they always ensure we get some work done.



Really, we are left to our own regard. There’s always something to do, but never something to be done. There’s no meaning or purpose to what we do. No matter how much we invent, experiment with or theorize, we still just end up doing the same unimportant thing for eternity. There are always more forums to sign, more coffee to refill, and more typos to correct.



At least until the next break.

1p5wjki,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1p5wjki/im_lonely/,I'm lonely.,"Sigh... even just the title make me thinking ""damn am I depressed?"". Maybe a little but it's not something serious, just the lack of vitamin-D and coffee.

So I'm 25F and has been somewhat in my solitude introverted life since 2019. I just couldn't bring myself to get close to someone and be able to call them as friends. I'm in a healthy relationship with my boyfriend though but he's the only person that I hangout with. Still that doesn't make me clingy or anything, I'm still the same sadly... asking for solitude, space and some me time(most of the time).

I wish I understand why I am the way I am. It's making me very lonely as a person even without realising it sometimes. I hate being around people, there's many people that consider me as friends while I consider them as someone I just happen to know. Being pretty doesn't guaranteed social life, I go outside and people would always come talk to me for a small talk because I look friendly and approachable. I get compliments everyday by women and get my pictures taken at events from time to time. 

On the outside, I feel like people think I have friends and good life with how well I represent myself altogether. But sadly, I'm just a loner, I literally have no one and the only place I talk to is Reddit. Why...? Because I'm anonymous and so are redditors, I don't feel seen or feel the need to make friends with them. I'm just here and they're just there.

I used to think nothing wrong with enjoying my solitude but loneliness hit me sometimes. I miss having a girls talk and gaming with friends, talking about anything and laughing at little things. But it's getting hard to do so IRL and online. So much dramas from people IRL that I just rather not get involved. I just wanna have a drink, a talk and a good time. Whenever I've tried to make friends online, I have to meet with many walls of men being creeps wanting to take advantage of me, can't be friends with certain gender(s) because their partner doesn't like since I'm a *woman*, or just simply meeting people who want friends but put absolutely zero effort. So that's why I couldn't make any, I got burnout and tired from trying.

I look at my boyfriend and he has people who comes talk to him so easily while I have to deal with the fact that people saying the word ""you're a woman"" or ""you're pretty"" and that's why they can't be friends. I want to be my boyfriend. I want to be a man or just slash my face so at least someone can just overlook the outside me and get to know me as a person instead because god... I'm lonely.

Right now, I'm lonely. Hopefully tomorrow I wakeup and feel less lonely. Just want this off my chest because I have no to talk to or cry to.

1p5wjjs,https://www.reddit.com/r/rs_x/comments/1p5wjjs/heartbreak_is_stupid_and_so_am_i/,Heartbreak is Stupid and So Am I,"Back in 2017 I was in an online community and met a guy (I am a girl) and we really hit it off, talked all the time, etc. he had seen what I looked like and knew a ton about my personal life but he was always super cagey and didn’t reciprocate on either of those fronts. After a year and a half I told him I was developing romantic feelings for him and would really like to try and make something work AKA actually get to know him. He rejected me. It felt bad but I obviously had no choice but to keep moving forward with my life. We would talk here and there but not with the same fervor. I eventually met someone locally, got married, and over time lost touch with the original guy. I travel a lot for work and in Spring 2025 was going to be in the city he had alluded to living in. I reached out and asked if he would be open to meeting in person and he surprisingly said yes. We met up at a coffee shop and he was very normal, smart, hot, funny, had a good job, etc. all things that I didn’t expect with how private he was. We spent the next few days catching up, talking a ton, kinda working through things. He admitted that he regretted shutting me down all those years ago and hadn’t done it because he wasn’t interested but because at the time just had no self confidence and was scared it was too good to be true, wouldn’t work, etc. so he wouldn’t let himself risk it. It was a huge catharsis to finally meet but it seems like both of us walked away kind of feeling like shit over this “one that got away” scenario. 

for months now I’ve been experiencing this terrible heartbreak but it seems like I should be able to let it go. I’m the one who made an attempt and tried to give it a go. I ended up finding someone else so it’s not like I’m alone. He is still single as far as I know and has the weight of being the rejector and regretting it. But it seems like I’m equally broken up if not more. I think I’ve always been a big believer in soul mates and I think it’s possible that I missed mine in this situation and I have to just accept it. I know it sounds cliche, but I had never felt the way I felt about him with anyone and I still haven’t, but my life has moved onward without him in it, but the feelings still intact. 

I know it was stupid of me to even open up the door in the first place. I wasn’t over it so it’s not like I opened an old wound (it never closed) but I am aware I shouldn’t have set myself up to re-engage. Now I’m seeking general advice on how to find acceptance and ways to move forward. Has anyone ever lost out on the love of their life and found ways to heal? ",11,1764026296.0,rs_x,4,0.93,False

I was diagnosed with terminal ileitis a few years ago after a CT scan in the ER. They mentioned that Crohn’s was a possibility, but I never got a definitive diagnosis. Since then I’ve had a couple mild episodes but nothing consistent.

Today, something weird happened and I’m not sure what to make of it:
- I had one episode of diarrhea at 7 am
- Later had small formed stool mixed with mucus
- Then a very small amount of straight mucus (yellow/light brown and slimy)
- (I’m a nursing student) I have had hyperactive bowel sounds, especially in the RLQ
- Mild cramping that comes in waves (3–4/10 at worst)
- Lower back pain that radiates slightly
- No fever, nausea, chills, or vomiting
- Stomach feels relatively calm otherwise
- Still have an appetite 
- Only ate cheez-its, an apple, and half a cup of coffee today. Also just ate a bowl of ramen. 
- Had some joint/wrist pain earlier, which I read can sometimes accompany Crohn’s flares (though I’m hypermobile, so that could be unrelated)

History that might be relevant:
- Prior episode of terminal ileitis on CT
- Very inconsistent bowel habits (I tend to get constipated)
- Past C. diff infections, but this current episode doesn’t seem typical for that and I have no major risk factors right now
- This all happened during a period of very high stress (nursing clinicals starting, hospitalized family member, finishing up classes, working full time, finances, etc). 
- No increased stool frequency so far — just the mucus issue and cramping
- Stool isn’t watery except for the first early morning episode

I’m not asking for a diagnosis — just wondering if anyone with Crohn’s has had more low-volume stools with RLQ hyperactive bowel sounds and cramping like this during a flare, especially when I still have an appetite. Although this lower back pain and cramping is not feeling good at all. 

Any thoughts or shared experiences would really help. Thank you",1,1764026208.0,CrohnsDisease,2,1.0,False

1p5whei,https://www.reddit.com/r/floorplan/comments/1p5whei/furniture_layout_suggestions/,Furniture Layout Suggestions,"Hi everyone,

I’m hoping to get some layout advice for my living room. I’ve attached the blueprint of the space (the living room is outlined in blue). The room is a bit tricky because of the proportions and how it connects to the rest of the floorplan (entryway, dining room, and kitchen). There is a large picture window on the 216"" wall as well as windows on either side of the fireplace. I'm hoping to fit a sofa and two chairs with a large rectangular coffee table. I’m struggling to decide on:

* Where the main sofa should go
* Where chairs should float vs. be against a wall

My style leans modern/warm/Scandi, but I’m open to anything that makes the room feel cohesive and well-planned. I'm also debating if the 102"" wall should be extended to make the living room feel like its own space and so a chair or sofa won't float beyond the wall

Service centre says they replaced the boiler and a gasket. The chemical taste is still there. Tried 3 different beans through my grinder and also got some preground supermarket espresso. All of them have an overpowering chemical taste that isn't the normal sour or bitter coffee taste.  
  
Things I've tried before the service:

\- bottomless portafilter from BrewedCo (usual) vs stock portafilter (that has plastic insert so tastes like plastic)

\- changing dose - 18g up to the 23g I was using and getting great coffee from

\- changing time - everything from 20s to a minute :D

\- changing temperature - 3 temp settings on the machine, plus a blank shot or no blank shot

\- changing ratio - 1:1 (ew), 1:1.5, 1:2, 1:2.25, 1:2.5, 1:3  (1:3 was the usual recipe prior)

\- each change was one at a time .. changed only dose OR time OR temperature OR ratio and compared to the last

\- different beans - decaf (usual), medium roast, ethiopian, dark roast (usual), and same roasts from different roasters (all beans at least 10 days old and less than a month)  I did try some newly roasted beans too just for science .. 

\- pre ground coffee from the supermarket

\- filtered water from the fridge (usual) vs tap water

  
I've used 4+ kg of beans trying to work this out.  If anyone has any suggestions other than throw the machine off the balcony .. please share :)

He had no collar, so I brought him to my vet so they could  scan him to see if he had a chip but he didn't.

I work at a hotel in the front office department and the girl F24 who Im referring to is a barista at the coffee shop downstairs in the lower lobby. My co worker and I have been visiting the coffee shop downstairs weekly when I come in to 1. Get free coffee but 2. Also to interact with the girl who I find very kind, pretty and just interested in general. We have made more and more small talk over time as she makes our coffee. We all share a mutual friend who works with me and my other co worker in the front office. Yesterday after 2 months of weekly visits to the coffee shop I decided to ask for her number and say we should all hang out sometime as a group. She didnt hesitate at all and gave me her number. I texted her later that evening with no expectations really but we ended up texting all night very playfully and lots of banter. I was not expecting that so fast at least so my intial plan was to hang out with my co workers in a group setting but now im curious if I should proceed differently? Please help thanks!

At 2 am like clockwork my whole bedroom stinks like a dead skunk or rotting garlic but it’s weed just the low quality kind. I live in a side by side duplex. The lady I share a wall with doesn’t leave the house but I know it’s not her or I’d be smelling it all day and it wouldn’t be a huge blast of it coming outside. It eventually airs out with the windows open but can take up to an hour so I’m up until 3am smelling it and can’t sleep. I think it’s coming down the hvac because there’s no insulation. I have 2 fans running and an air purifier and I’ve sprayed perfume but the weed smell gets into the fabric. If anyone knows what to do to get the smell out so I can sleep I was thinking of trying to use baking soda and coffee grinds. 
Just wish people could vape or do edibles. I’m in a big city and weed is normal but usually people do it discreetly or it doesn’t smell like whatever shot this person is smoking. ",4,1764025632.0,neighborsfromhell,16,0.59,False

Long story short, we stopped being friends because she was very possessive and jealous of everything and everyone in my life so I decided to cut ties with her.

1p5w51r,https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonSleep/comments/1p5w51r/analysis_of_minimal_builds_for_ingredient/,Analysis of minimal Builds for Ingredient Specialists,"##Introduction: 
I’ve gathered this data in Excel and hope I can convey it in a comprehensible manner through text, which became a 16 page Word document- it’s gonna be a long read.

Often times in RMM topics on Ingredient Specialists, or topics in which general advice or specific guidelines are asked on these type of Pokémon, I find we often fall back and saying “a gatherer needs at least x and y before it’s worth the investment”. But recently I’ve been wondering how the minimal build would actually look like per Pokémon, per Ingredient. And as it is we have a wonderful tool in Raenox to help us calculate how much a Pokémon can gather with specific mixes of Subskills and Natures.

First of all on the boosts, I found that from strongest to weakest the following holds true:
IFM > Nature+ > IFS > HSM > HSS
It’s worth noting that IFS&HSM and IFS&HSS fall inbetween IFM and Nature+, however I figured when talking about minimum builds, in particular since we’re at the mercy of RNG for the most part, trying to go for a combination of two Subs is going to be less likely to obtain than just one. In this case this might be important due to how I looked at the data- I noted the amounts of a specific Ingredient needed for a Dish, looked up how many of those a specific Pokémon would gather with Neutral stats, than started to change the metrics of the Subs or Nature from lowest to highest until it showed to be able to obtain the needed amount. However, if Nature+ was not enough, I would skip to IFM and not take either of the two combinations in account. Another thing of note on the subject of boosts, while Ingredient Finder directly boosts the chance of a Pokémon proccing an Ingredient instead of a Berry, Helping Speed makes them faster thus increasing the amount of times they might proc an Ingredient over a given amount of time. As such, if you find that your Pokémon have their Inventory filled every time you open the game, Helping Speed will actually be detrimental because proccing more often also means the Inventory fills faster, and as such you would actually have less Ingredients in that case. Your mileage may vary depending on your playstyle.

Another important note is that I looked at each Pokémon in a vacuum and did not take Healers and Helping Bonus members into account. Both of those would make each individual Pokémon more effective but until we can freely assign Subs and Natures there’s no real guarantee what you’re going to have in your party at any given time, in particular for HB. At the same time, since we’re looking at a minimal build, that can only mean that in the presence of such Supporting Pokémon, the Ingredient Specialists in question will only function better and perhaps you’ll even have more opportunity to switch them out for something else at an earlier point.

Last thing of notice, at times IFM alone won’t be enough. In that case again I will have made combinations from weakest to strongest again until the quota was hit. However, that means that a stronger combination would obviously be better. For example: If I  note that IFM&HSM is the minimum, that will mean that IFM&IFS and IFM&Nature+ will be even better, but IFM&HSS will not suffice.

Keep in mind that this goes of averages, so it’s still not always guaranteed that the minimum will at all times be enough. If your ‘Mon decided to proc only its A slot for an entire period of time, you’ll end up with significantly less produce than if it would only gather from its C slot. Again, having more boosters than the minimum is never a bad thing.

As for the Pokémon I looked at, since comparing every single one would be way too time consuming, I typically only looked at the top 2 producers for each Ingredient. Unless otherwise noted assume that they are at level 60 with 0 hours of sleep time. On that, keep in mind that the Ribbons from sleeping hours will increase their effectiveness.

On to the next part- the Dishes we can make, followed by who we need for what and with what.

Obviously there are three different categories- Curry, Salad, Dessert. But these can also be split into two different group: A) Those that can be made without any boosts other than increasing the Pot Size (we currently don’t need more than 78 spaces), and; 
B) Those that need a bigger pot by some means (Sunday, Cooking Power-Up and/or GCT). For the latter, each category has three Dishes which I looked at and for the former, I had a look at the four strongest Dishes.

That leads us to a breakdown per Dish, per category, per group, per Ingredient, per Pokémon. Here we go! I’ll start with an analysis per Dish, than below that per Ingredient. And even further down I’ll make an ‘just tell me what I need’ TL;DR.

##Dishes:
**Curry A #1: Pumpkaboo Stew**
One of the newest recipies at the moment of writing, ‘only’ needs 69 pot space so could be made without investing in the most recent pot expension. However it needs a massive amount of Mushrooms and it should be rare for anyone to have a Pumpkin gatherer at level 60 at the moment, so likely not an easy one to make three times a day regardless:
-30xPumpkin: The only Ingredient Specialists we have for this for now is Gourgeist, it comes in four different sizes which have a very slight variation in their production rate, but as it is even a neutral one of the Small Size, which has the lowest production, should give you 33 a day which is enough to keep up.
-48xSausage: Both a neutral Aggron and Charizard at 80 and 76 respectively will give you more than enough. Interesting enough, a level 32 AA Neutral Aggron also yields 60 Sausages a day, which is effectively just as good for a lot lower investment in Candies and Shards!
-54xPotato: Neutral Meowscarade with 60, or Golem with 55 would suffice, or a level 30 Meowscarade with IFM, also at 60.
-75xMushroom: Both Quagsire and Vikavolt need some serious RNG as they need IFM, Nature+ & HSS to be able to keep at with 78.

**Curry A #2: Keema Curry**
With a total of 77 Ingredients needed something that only recently was made possible to make on a daily basis without further boosts, and the only reason why you’d possibly want to expend the Pot to 78 (and not higher). The requirements of the gatherers are actually very low, but finding Dratini and Stuffull is in my experience on the rarer side of the spectrum in their Sleep Style, let alone find good ones- but otherwise this might be the best Curry to make currently (Curryrently?):
-81xHerb: This seems very high but a Neutral Dragonite can actually already give this with 86. At level 41 it would need IFM for 85.
-72xSausages: Neutral Aggron and Charizard again can provide for this at 80 and 76 respectively. Level 32 Aggron with IFM is also sufficient at 79 daily.
-42xCorn: Even a Neutral level 30 Bewear gathers 49 -36xGinger: Neutral Tyranitar gathers 83, even at level 41 it still brings 63

**Curry A #3: Ninja Curry**
With 50 needed Ingredients total this one is pretty easy to make with the biggest potential problem being Leeks, though also a fair amount weaker than the above two.
-72xSoybean: Neutral Golem with 74 and Neutral ABB Tyranitar with 77 can keep up. Level 30 Golem with IFM also finds 73. -27xSausage: Even a Neutral level 32 Aggron can provide twice the amount needed, level 60 Neutral Aggron or Charizard are overkill.
-36xLeek: Farfetch’d Neutral easily obtains this, Quaquaval needs HSS to just reach it. A Farfetch'd at level 30 needs IFS to gain this exact amount.
-15xMushroom: Neutral Quagsire gains 48, at level 30 that’s 35 which is still more than enough. Even a level 30 Neutral Charjabug AB could obtain this amount.

**Curry A #4: Butter Curry**
At 55 needed Ingredients with a relatively low spread amongst all four this is likely the easiest Curry to make, while not too far of in strength from Ninja.
-54xPotato: Neutral Meowscarade with 60, or Golem with 55 would suffice, or a level 30 Meowscarade with IFM, also at 60. -45xTomato: Victreebel, Luxray and Abomasnow can all be used at level 30 and Neutral for this.
-36xCacoa: Neutral Clodsire, also at level 30, can bring plenty. ABB Blastoise is also good for this (though won’t bring in enough Milk on it’s own) -30xMilk: Even neutral level 30 Blastoise can easily gather this.

**Curry B #1: Avocado Gratin**
Probably one of the toughest to make right now because Avocado was only just introduced in the game, and a high amount of Oil to boot.
-66xAvocado: Flygon already needs IFM for this but will gather 71 with it. At level 34 it needs IFM, Nature+ & HSS to gather this amount.
-60xPotato: Neutral Meowscarade just breaks even, Golem needs at least HSM for 62, level 30 Meowscarade needs at least IFM also for 60
-123xMilk: No other Dish needs as much of a single Ingredient o_O Blastoise needs IFM & Nature+ for 125. Level 30 can’t keep up, even with IFM, IFS, Nature+ & HSM it can only gather 102. -96xOil: Luxray ABB needs IFM, IFS & Nature+ for this amount, Toxicroak needs all that AND HSS for 101.

**Curry B #2: Sukiyaki Curry**
The amount of Leeks needed makes this pretty much impossible to make a on three times a day basis without heavily stockpiling them.
-81xLeek: Even the greatest Quaquaval can’t produce this much in a vacuum. Farfetch’d also needs to supreme build of IFM, IFS, Nature + & HSM (lol good luck with that)
-78xSausage: Neutral Aggron is again enough, Charizard needs at least HSS, with both providing 80 a day as such. Level 32 Aggron needs IFM for 79 but is still a significant less investment.
-78xHoney: Neutral Venusaur gathers exactly this, Pinsir needs HSM for 81, level 30 Venusaur needs IFM & HSS for 81.
-68xEgg: Neutral Blissey gathers this, at level 30 she needs IFM for the same amount.

**Curry B #3: Perk Up Stew**
Probably the easiest out of the three B Curries to make, with Mushrooms being the potential problem.
-84xSoybean: ABB Tyranitar needs HSM for 87, Golem needs IFS for 86, at level 30 it needs IFM & Nature+ for 87.
-75xTomato: Victreebel needs HSS for 75, Luxray and Abomasnow HSM for 78. At level 30 they need IFM & HSM for 78 ,77 and 77 respectively.
-69xMushroom: Both Quagsire and Vikavolt would need both IFM & HSM for 71 and 70 respectively.
-48xCoffee: Neutral Vikavolt easily makes this, at level 30 it needs HSM for 49.

**Salad A #1: Layered Salad**
Needs 69 total Ingredients, so the previous max pot size was sufficient for this. In fact, no other A Salad needs more space than this. Not too bad to make either.
-75xEggs: Blissey needs HSM for 77, at level 30 she needs IFM & HSM for 76.
-45xOil: Neutral Toxicroak and ABB Luxray obtain plenty, level 30 Toxicroak needs IFS for 47.
-45xPotato: Meowscarade and Golem Neutral for 60 and 55 respectively, Neutral level 30 Meowscarade just breaks even. -36xSausage: Neutral level 32 Aggron is more than enough, providing 60 a day, everything more is overkill.

**Salad A #2: Ninja Salad**
Also relatively easy to make and not too far off in strength from Layered, which one you make will depend on your available Pokémon.
-45xLeek: Farfetch’d needs HSS to gather this amount, Quaquaval already needs IFM for the same amount. A level 30 Farfetch’d needs IFM & HSM for 47.
-57xSoybean: Neutral Golem en ABB Tyranitar at 74 and 77 respectively is plenty. At level 30 Golem will need HSS for 59.
-36xMushroom: Neutral Quagsire and Vikavolt can take care of this.
-33xGinger: Neutral Tyranitar gathers 83, even at level 41 it still brings 63

**Salad A #3: Greengrass Salad**
The three above Dishes are really close in strength to the point where the preferred one is honestly the one you have the easiest time in making it.
-66xOil: ABB Luxray needs Nature+ for this exact amount, Toxicroak needs IFM for 71, level 30 Toxicroak needs hefty RNG with IFM, IFS, HSM & Nature+ for 70.
-51xCorn: Neutral Bewear and ABB Dragonite make this amount easily, level 30 Bewear needs at least HSS
-42xTomato: Victreebel, Luxray and Abomasnow can all be used at level 30 and Neutral for this.
-27xPotato: Even a Neutral level 30 Meowscarade can easily manage this with 45, it on level 60 and Golem are overkill.

**Salad A #4: Cross Chop Salad**
A fair bit weaker then the previous four, but not particularly easier to make due to the demand of Eggs combined with Corn. Least preferable Salad in my opinion unless you have to make due with it, but at least the requirements for the Pokémon are lower overall.
-60xEgg: Level 30 Blissey needs Nature+ for this exactly, level 60 makes this easily.
-45xSausage: Again a Neutral level 32 Aggron is more than enough.
-33xCorn: Even a Neutral level 30 Bewear gathers 49 -30xTomato: Even at level 30 Neutral Victreebell, Luxray or Abomasnow easily gather this.

**Salad B #1: Bulldoze**
Not gonna be realistic for three times a day right now due to the amount of Avacodoes needed.
-84xAvocado: Flygon needs some heavy RNG with IFM, Nature+ and HSS. At level 34 it can’t gather enough, making just 71 with the best possible build of IFM, IFS, Nature+ & HSM.
-75xCorn: ABB Dragonite and Bewear need at least HSM for 76 and 75 respectively, level 30 Bewear needs IFM & Nature+ for 77.
-90xHerb: Dragonite only needs HSS luckily, which makes it produce 100. At level 41 it needs IFM & HSS to make exactly this amount.
-66xSoybean: Neutral Golem and ABB Tyranitar provide enough at 74 and 77 respectively. A Golem at level 30 will want Nature+

**Salad B #2: Defiant Salad**
Coffee is a pretty harsh requirement considering it’s line only appears on OGPP and it such somewhat difficult to hunt for, otherwise it’s not too bad I think.
-84xCoffee: Vikavolt needs IFM & HSM for 88, at level 30 it won’t be able to keep up.
-84xSausage: Aggron needs HSS for 85, Charizard a bit more with Nature+ for 90. Level 32 Aggron needs at least IFM&HSS for 84.
-66xOil: ABB Luxray needs Nature+ for this exact amount, Toxicroak needs IFM for 71, level 30 Toxicroak needs hefty RNG with IFM, IFS, HSM & Nature+ for 70.
-66xPotato: HSM Meowscarade, IFM Golem or IFM & HSM level 30 Meowscarade should suffice.

**Salad B #3: Apple Acid**
Eggs is rough, otherwise this might be the easiest of the three B Salads to make.
-105xEgg: Blissey needs IFM & Nature+ to make exactly this amount. Level 30 has no chance for this.
-84xApple: Skeledirge need a small boost in HSS for 88, at level 30 it needs IFM & HSS for 87
-69xTomato: Neutral Victreebel, Luxray and Abomasnow can just reach this amount. At level 30 they will need IFM for this amount and Abomasnow on top of that needs HSS for 72. -54xMilk: Even level 30 Neutral Blastoise will gather enough for this.

**Dessert A #1: Macarons**
Cacao is tough to get, otherwise this one isn’t too bad to make.
-75xCacoa: Clodsire needs IFM & HSM, Blastoise ABB needs IFM, Nature+ & HSS.
-75xEgg: Blissey needs HSM for 77, at level 30 she needs IFM & HSM for 76.
-51xHoney: Even a level 30 Neutral Venusaur should gather this easily.
-30xMilk: Even a level 30 Neutral Blastoise van easily gather this.

**Dessert A #2: Scones**
Not taking the below Dessert into account, this one might be the best to make with not too much investment needed. -75xApple: Neutral Skeledirge still easily makes this with 83, at level 30 it needs IFM for 82.
]-75xGinger: Neutral Tyranitar brings in enough with 83. At level 41 it will want IFM to find that same amount.
-54xCorn: Neutral Bewear and ABB Dragonite can handle this with 67, level 30 Bewear needs at least HSM for 55.
-27xMilk: Even a level 30 Neutral Blastoise van easily gather this.

**Dessert A #3: Smoothie**
Pretty strong for using only three Ingredients! Fear the Avocadoes! Might even be the easiest Dessert to make if you’ve lucked into a good Flygon early.
-54xAvocado: Neutral Flygon gets exactly this. At level 34 it needs IFM and HSS though.
-48xTomato: Victreebel, Luxray and Abomasnow can all be used at level 30 and Neutral for this.
-42xMilk: Even a level 30 Neutral Blastoise van easily gather this.

**Dessert A #4: Flan**
Far and away the easiest Dessert, maybe even the easiest A Dish period, but also the weakest out of all of them. -60xHoney: Level 30 Venusaur needs just a tiny boost from HSS to gather 61
-45xEgg: Level 30 Neutral Blissey brings in enough for this. -30xMilk: Even a level 30 Neutral Blastoise van easily gather this.
-30xApple: Even at level 30 a Neutral Skeledirge makes double this amount.

**Dessert B #1: Pancakes**
The other of two recipies with Pumpkin. Though the strongest also the easiest to make out of the three B Desserts, though Pumpkin being new having a good Gourgeist for it will be the most difficult requirement.
-54xPumpkin: Gourgeist (Jumbo/Large) needs IFM & Nature+ to gather 56/55 Pumpkins, Gourgeist (Medium/Small) needs more RNG with IFM, Nature+ & HSS for 56 a day.
-72xEgg: Blissey needs HSS for this amount, at level 30 she needs IFM, at level 30 she needs IFM & HSM.
-96xHoney: This seems like a large amount but surprisingly a level 30 Venusaur with ‘just’ IFM, Nature+ & HSM makes 100. It’s even easier at level 60 needing only IFM for 102 though Pinsir needs IFM & HSS for 100.
-87xTomato: Victreebel, Luxray and Abomasnow need IFM. At level 30, they need IFM, HSM & Nature+

**Dessert B #2: Éclair**
Needs a ridiculous amount of Cacao that with one Ingredient Specialist isn’t realistic to gather three times a day, unless seriously blessed by RNGsus in it’s build.
-90xCacao: This was quite shocking! In order to keep up, Clodsire needs IFM, Nature+ & IFS. ABB Blastoise needs that AND HSM... good luck with that (and it won’t even be close to making enough Milk on it’s own either).
-78xMilk: Neutral Blastoise should just be able to bring in enough of this at 80. At level 30 it needs IFM to bring in exactly this amount.
-72xCoffee: Vikavolt needs IFM for 78, at level 30 it needs IFM, HSS & Nature+ for 73.
-66xHoney: Venusaur and Pinsir supply plenty, Level 30 Venusaur needs IFS to make 67

**Dessert B #3: Cola**
Likely not possible to make this on a three times a day basis due to Leeks without stockpiling beforehand.
-105xApple: Skeledirge only needs IFM for 110, at level 30 it needs more investment with IFM, Nature + & HSM for 108. -60xGinger: Even a Neutral level 41 Tyranitar brings in enough with 63
-60xLeek: Even a level 60 Farfetch’d already needs a combination of IFM & HSS to get 61. Quaquaval needs the insane combination of IFM, IFS, Nature+ & HSS for that same amount. A level 30 Farfetch’d can’t keep up.
-36xCoffee: Neutral level 30 Vikavolt brings enough for this.

##Ingredients:
**Pumpkins**: Only used in two Dishes, an A Curry and B Dessert, the most needed being 54 a day in the latter. Gourgeist is currently the only Ingredient Specialist for this, it comes in different sizes with Jumbo having the highest production, and Small the lowest, though they are rather close. -Gourgeist (Jumbo/Large) minimum requirement: IFM & Nature+ (56/55) -Gourgeist (Medium/Small) minimum requirement: IFM, Nature+ & HSS (56) For the A Curry, a Neutral one is enough.

**Sausages**: A much used Ingredient in three A Curries, one B Curry, two A Salads and one B Salad. No Desserts though (thankfully?). The most needed is 84 per day in a Salad. Interesting, not a huge investment is needed for this. An Aggron only needs HSS, or a Charizard with Nature+ could suffice as well. But maybe even better, a level 32 Aggron with ‘just’ IFM and HSS could also provide that exact amount, which would be a much lower investment in terms of Shards and Candies. For all A Dishes except Keema Curry, even a Neutral level 32 Aggron supplies enough, though for the latter it would need at least IFM. In fact, if you’re making A during the week and B on Sunday, unless you’re making Butter Curry which doesn’t use Sausage, a level 32 IFM Aggron would provide enough throughout the week including overflow that you likely don’t even need to run it all the time to build up a stock to last the entire week.

**Potatoes**: Found in two A Curries and Salads and one B Curry and Salad, one Dish less than Sausages. Meowscarade is the undisputed best farmer as the only AAA one, followed by Golem and Blissey who with their ABB don’t differ too much. Blissey however should in my opinion be saved as an AAA Egg farmer with how rare and expensive it is. Geodude is more easily found but there is no overlap with it’s A Ingredient of Soybeans at the moment, so those somewhat go to waste unless you store them for Perk Up Stew or Bulldoze Salad during their respective weeks. Plus there’s the typical risk of running mixed farmers of it only proccing Soy leaving you with 0 Potatoes... Neutral Meowscarade and Golem are more than sufficient for all A Dishes, but so is a level 30 Neutral Meowscarade for Salads, though it would need IFM to just break even for Curries. For Curry B Neutral Meowscarade is still just enough though Golem would already need at least HSM, and level 30 Meowscarade would need IFM. Salad B is the most demanding, Meowscarade would need at least HSM, Golem would need IFM, and a level 30 Meowscarade would need a combination of at least IFM & HSM. I would advice hunting a IFM cat which should suffice both at lower levels at first and eventually higher levels later on.

**Mushrooms**: Quagsire and Vikavolt are the best Mushroom farmers, but only the first is AAA. They’re not too far apart actually but Vikavolt is the only AAA Coffee farmer (and by far the best at it for that) and is more rare as it only spawns on OGPP AND needs an Evolution Stone, as such it is my humble opinion that only Quagsire should be considered for this role. It’s downside is that is shares Candies with Clodsire though. Gengar is another option but not nearly as efficient so I didn’t take it into account. It’s also an Ingredient that’s often used in Dishes, two A Curries, one B Curry, and one A Salad, and in half those cases in quite high quantities. To keep up with the highest amount, which is actually in an A Curry (Pumpkaboo Stew), they would need IFM, Nature+ & HSS to keep up.

**Herbs**: Dragonite and Gengar are the two best farmers but they are so far apart in efficiency that I didn’t even bother with the latter, with 86 vs 60. There’s only two Dishes that need Herb but they need it in high quantities as well. As it turns out Dragonite only needs HSS to produce 100 Herbs a day which is plenty, so an even stronger one should be very future proof. Keep in account that as a Pseudo it’s also a huge investment to raise in Candies and Shards, so if you want to keep the investment in those resources lower, a level 41 Dragonite with IFM+HSS could provide just enough for both of those Dishes at 90, which is what the B Salad (Avocado) needs.

**Corn**: Dragonite and Bewear perform very similarly even though the former is ABB. However as Dragonite is the only worthwhile Herb farmer and raising two is a very steep investment, I would advice to hunt for a Bewear for Corn. It’s used in one A Curry, two A Salads, one B Salad and one A Dessert. Bewear really only needs HSM for the A Salad (Bulldoze), otherwise a Neutral one is sufficient for everything. If you don’t want to invests that much Shards and Candy in leveling it, a IFM & Nature+ level 30 Bewear performs just as well.

**Ginger**: Again an Ingredient where the number one, Tyranitar, and number 2, Kangaskhan, are so far apart from each other, 83 vs 66, that it didn’t make much sense even comparing the two. Not only that, the latter as far more rare and Biscuit hungry that it’s not even worth the hunt. They even have Favorite Berries on the same Island making Kangaskhan even more redundant... It’s used in one A Curry, one A Salad, one A Dessert, and one B Dessert, and interestingly a Neutral Tyranitar is all you need for all of them. If you don’t want to invest that much, an IFM level 41 Tyranitar is needed for Dessert B (Scones), otherwise for all A Dishes Neutral is more than enough as well.

**Soybeans**: Again an Ingredient used in one A Curry, one B Curry, one A Salad and one B Salad. Technically speaking ABB Tyranitar is the best gatherer by a small margin, Golem and Quaquaval have near identical rates. However as stated above Tyranitar is best used for Ginger, and as we’ll see below Quaquaval will typically be your Leek farmer... which really only leaves Golem. A Neutral one is all you need, but if you wish to invest less in leveling it up to 60, it can be left at 30 as long as it has IFM & Nature+ to be able to gather enough for the 84 needed beans for Perk Up Stew.

**Leeks**: And back to the aforementioned Leek... the top two Pokémon here are Farfetch’d with 43, followed by Quaquaval at 34. It doesn’t take a genius to see Farfetch’d is significantly better, but it’s also that much harder to find, catch and raise to the point where you’re mostly better of trying for Quaquaval anyway, unless RNGesus is on your side to bless you. Also, you wouldn’t think it, but Farfetch’d is a much less annoying name to write and pronounce than Quaquaval, or at least in my opinion. The greatest thing that could happen is finding a great Quaquaval, than finding a great Farfetch’d, and than items being released in the game to change Quaquaval from ABB to AAA. One can hope... Leeks are in four Dishes, one A Curry, one B Curry, one A Salad, and one B Dessert. A level 30 Quaquaval finds so few Leeks that it’s not really worth looking into one that isn’t level 60, and even there it needs significantly better stats to keep up with Farfetch’d at the same level, though a level 30 Ferfetch’d needs even greater Subs and won’t be able to manage the B Dishes. Even Quaquaval will have a hard time with B Dessert (Cola) and also won’t be able keep up for B Curry (Sukiyaki). Overall, this is an Ingredient that when planned on being used for the B Dishes, needs to be stockpiled beforehand.

**Tomatoes**: Interestingly used in every Category, and twice in A Salads at that, making this the most used Ingredient. The top three farmers, Victreebel, Luxray and Abomasnow, are so close in production rates that their builds are pretty much the same as well, though the former is the easiest to obtain and raise as it appears on the most Islands (though on the other hand it also needs an Evolution Stone). For all the A Dishes they can be used Neutral at level 30. For the B Dishes they’ll need IFM, HSM & Nature+ to keep up with the highest demand, though at level 60 IFM is sufficient.

**Cacoa**: Clodsire is the best gatherer, after Absol who is closely followed by ABB Blastoise. However, since Absol is so incredibly rare, it felt redundant to take it in to account as the other two are much easier to find, catch and raise. There is another interesting thing here- both recipes listed here A Curry (Butter) and B Dessert (Éclair) use both Cacao use Milk- as such I also looked into the option of running two Blastoise, both level 30 and AB. It was an interesting thought but something to be aware of is that many more Dishes use Milk without Cacoa and running two level 30 Blastoise wouldn’t be efficient for those recipies so even if doing this you’d still need to raise a third AAA Blastoise, even moreso two Blastoise are not only going to bring in a lot of Cacoa you’re not going to be able to use, but also even more random junk through both of their Ingredient Magnet. Regardless, it would work for the Curry but not for the Éclair. Regardless this is a pretty demanding Ingredient where it’s Specialists aren’t actually really great at finding it either. For the biggest demanding Dish (Éclair), Clodsire already needs IFM, Nature+ and IFS, ABB Blastoise would need HSM on top of that.

**Milk**: I was very surprise to find that Milk is used in eight Dishes in total, most of which are in the Dessert group. Another thing is that Blastoise in the number one spot is so far ahead of ABB Meowscarade in the second spot, with 80 vs 63, that I didn’t even bother comparing them. The fact that Wartortle takes third place with 62 Milk a day says enough (and with 2000+ Sleeping hours is even better than the cat- lmao!). For most recipies a Neutral Blastoise level 30 is more than sufficient except for but for a B Dessert (Éclair) where it needs IFM and for a B Curry (Gratin) it can’t keep up and even at level 60 needs IFM & Nature+.

**Avocadoes**: Another easy one, since we currently have only one Ingredient Specialist for it in Flygon (finally a Pokémon game that makes this Pokémon great!). Good luck having it at level 60 already though hahah. Neutral is good enough for A Dessert (Smoothie), but it needs fairly good RNG for IFM, HSS & Nature+ for B Salad (Bulldoze). Just IFM is enough for B Curry (Avocado Gratin).

**Oil**: ABB Luxray is actually a bit better than Toxicroak, but the latter is much easier to find and Candies should be more abundant as well... pick your Poison (yes, I am trying to steer you towards Toxicroak as I think it’s much cooler. If my opinion doesn’t sway you, it’s also one of my youngest daughters’ favorites <3 ). Without personal opinions, a level 30 Toxicroak already falls off fast and can only keep up with making a one A Salad (Layered) which needs the lowest amount of Oil out of the four Dishes that use it, with only IFM before needing way too much RNG for the other Dishes. For the other A Salad (Greengrass) and B Salad (Defiant) Luxray needs Nature+ and Toxicroak needs IFM. For the B Curry (Avocado Gratin) that needs the most, Luxray needs IFM, IFS & Nature+, while Toxicroak needs all that AND IFS to keep up.

**Honey**: Venusaur is number one, with Pinsir at number two, but again this is one of those cases where the number two is much MUCH more rare, thus more difficult (and requiring more Biscuits) to catch and raise to the point where hunting it isn’t even worth it over a Bulbasaur. Regardless I compared them both again. Neutral Venusaur can carry for all recipies except for a B Dessert (Pancakes) for which it needs IFM. Pinsir needs that plus HSS, but even a level 30 Venusaur can be serviceable with IFM, Nature+ & HSM.

**Eggs**: Blissey is queen here, finding 10 more per day with everything neutral than Delibird and Chansey who both find the same amount - which means that 2000 sleeping hours, Chansey is actually better than Delibird, so I didn’t even bother throwing anything other than Blissey into Reanox. Many of the top Dishes actually use Egg so Blissey is quite important- one B Curry, two A Salads, one B Salad, two A Desserts and one B Dessert. With the exception of Apple Acid a level 30 Blissey could just suffice with just IFM & HSM, but for that B Salad you’ll want it at level 60 with IFM & Nature+.

**Coffee**: Again an Ingredient where the number one, Vikavolt, makes so much more a day that looking at the number 2, ABB Aggron, in my opinion wasn’t even worth it, with 59 vs 48. As it turns out, this Ingredient only used in B Dishes. It needs IFM & HSM to be able to make the largest amount of Coffee needed which is used in a B Salad (Defiant), which at level 30 it won’t be able to meet. It can, at that level with no boosts still make enough for B Dessert Cola but will need a hefty investment with IFM, Nature+ & HSS for the other in that category (Éclair). For the B Curry (Perk-Up Stew) it needs HSM.

**Apples**: Last Ingredient we’ll be looking at, and the above trend of the numero uno being so much better than the second place Pokémon, Skeledirge with 83 VS ABB Absol with 67, being upheld to the point where again I’m only looking at the first one. The highest amount of Apples are used in a B Dessert (Cola) for which Skeledirge only needs IFM to manage, but at level 30 it will need rather hefty RNG with IFM, Nature+ and HSM.

**Slowpoke Tails?**: Eh, not really used to be honest (I personally don’t even have it unlocked hahah). It’s THE most powerful Ingredient and as such great to use as filler, it’s actually used in the fifth strongest Curry and Salad (so after the Dishes listed here) with the Curry being a fair bit weaker but the Salad actually being almost equal to Cross Chop AND it uses WAY less Ingredients overall, but not used in any Desserts. But even if you wanted to use it on Salad week, the top producers, Ditto and Slowbro, can’t even find enough to produce them twice a day.... lol. Not to mention neither are really great otherwise (I guess an AAC Ditto could be used for the Oil the Salad needs as well, and Slowbro might have uses on a Suicune team...).

##TL;DR:
Alright, even I found that a lot to read through, so the bottom line:
-Dishes are separated into three categories (Curry, Salad, Dessert), and those I split into two groups; 
**Group A**: Those that can be made without further boosts to the Pot other than expensions. The strongest four here are
•Pumpkaboo Stew, Keema, Ninja and Butter for Curries
•Layered, Ninja, Greengrass and Cross Chop for Salads
•Macarons, Scones, Smoothie and Flan for Desserts
**Group B**: Those that cannot be made with further boosts to the Pot Size (with GCT and or a Pot Expending Skill). The three Dishes in each category for this are;
•Avocado Gratin, Sakiyaki and Perk Up Stew for Curries
•Bulldoze, Defaint and Apple Acid for Salads •	Pancakes, Éclair and Cola for Desserts

For both Groups, here I will only take into account the highest amount that a single Ingredient will need within the 12 Dishes in Group A, and the 9 Dishes within Group B, so that you’ll know what to aim for depending on your playstyle. Within those parameters I will list the minimal requirements the best or two best Ingredient Specialists need to be able to make that amount on a three times a day basis, that way if the Dish you’re going to be cooking needs less, you’ll always have your gatherer find enough. Unless otherwise noted, assume AAA Ingredient Spread and level 60.

**Pumpkin; Group A**
•Gourgeist (all size); Neutral
**Pumpkin; Group B**
•Gourgeist (Jumbo/Large); IFM & Nature+
•Gourgeist (Medium/Small); IFM, Nature+ & HSS

**Sausage; Group A**:
•Aggron; Neutral
•Charizard; Neutral
•Aggron (level 32); IFM
**Sausage; Group B**:
•Aggron; HSS
•Charizard; Nature+
•Aggron (level 32); IFM & HSS
(Note1: The highest requirements for Aggron are still low enough at level 32 that it might be worth considering to conserve on Shards and Candy)
(Note2: Keep in mind Charizard has Ingredient Magnet and will bring potentially bring in a lot of filler Ingredients as well, filling your bag quicker. A level 30 Charizard with decent Subs might also suffice but I honestly did not check due to it’s Skill in my opinion being a drawback)

**Potato; Group A**:
•Meowscarade; Neutral
•ABB Golem; Neutral
•Meowscarade (level 30); IFM
**Potato; Group B**:
•Meowscarade; HSM
•ABB Golem; IFM
•Meowscarade (level 30); IFM & HSM
(Note: The highest requirements for Meowscarade are still low enough at level 30 that it might be worth considering to conserve on Shards and Candy)

**Mushroom; Group A**:
•Quagsire; IFM, Nature+ & HSS
•ABB Vikavolt; IFM, Nature+ & HSS
(Note: Pumpkaboo Stew needs an obscene amount for an A Dish, for the other Dishes in this Group both Pokémon suffice being Neutral)
**Mushroom; Group B**:
•Quagsire; IFM & HSS
•ABB Vikavolt; IFM & HSS
(Note: Yes, the highest demand in a B Dish is lower than that of the highest demand in an A Dish)

**Herb; Group A**;
•Dragonite; Neutral
•Dragonite (level 41); Neutral
**Herb; Group B**;
•Dragonite; HSS
•Dragonite (level 41); IFM & HSS
(Note: The highest requirements for Dragonite are still low enough at level 41 that it might be worth considering to conserve on Shards and Candy since as a Pseudo it uses even more of those than the average Pokémon)

**Corn: Group A**;
•Bewear; Neutral
•Bewear (level 30); HSM
•ABB Dragonite; Neutral
**Corn: Group B**;
•Bewear; HSM
•Bewear (level 30); IFM & Nature+
•ABB Dragonite; HSM
(Note1: The highest requirements for Bewear are still low enough at level 30 that it might be worth considering to conserve on Shards and Candy)
(Note2: Keep in mind that Dragonite is by far the best Herb farmer AND that as a Pseudo Legendary is takes more Shards and Candies to raise than the average Pokémon. While it’s a little better than Bewear at Corn, raising one for this Ingredient and one for Ginger is a huge investment that is probably better of not being made).

**Ginger: Group A**;
•Tyranitar; Neutral
•Tyranitar (level 41); IFM
**Ginger: Group B**;
•Tyranitar; Neutral
•Tyranitar (level 41); Neutral
(Note1: Yes, the highest demand in a B Dish is lower than that of the highest demand in an A Dish)
(Note2: The highest requirement for Tyranitar is low enough at level 41 that it might be worth considering to conserve on Shards and Candy since as a Pseudo it uses even more of those than the average Pokémon)

**Soybean: Group A**;
•Golem; Neutral
•ABB Tyranitar; Neutral
•Golem (level 30); IFM
**Soybean: Group B**;
•Golem; IFS
•ABB Tyranitar; HSM
•Golem (level 30); IFM & Nature+
(Note1: The highest requirements for Golemr are still low enough at level 30 that it might be worth considering to conserve on Shards and Candy)
(Note2: Keep in mind that Tyranitar is by far the best Ginger farmer AND that as a Pseudo Legendary is takes more Shards and Candies to raise than the average Pokémon. While it’s a little better than Golem at Soybeans, raising one for this Ingredient and one for Ginger is a huge investment that is probably better of not being made).

**Leek: Group A**;
•Farfetch’d; HSS
•ABB Quaquaval; IFM
•Farfetch’d (level 30); IFM & HSM
**Leek: Group B**;
•Farfetch’d; IFM; IFS, Nature+ & HSS
(Note: Quaquaval can’t keep up for the highest demand in B Dishes, at the same time, good luck with finding a Farfetch’d that can).

**Tomato: Group A**;
•Victreebel (level 30); Neutral
•Luxray (level 30); Neutral
•Abomasnow (level 30); Neutral
**Tomato: Group B**;
•Victreebel; IFM
•Luxray; IFM
•Abomasnow; IFM
(Note: Neutral level 30 is enough for these Pokémon for all A Dishes. Technically you could still use them at level 30 for the B Dishes at well but the requirements become so high that you’re better off raising an IFM one to level 60, which will be significantly easier)

**Cacao: Group A**;
•Clodsire; IFM & HSM
•ABB Blastoise; IFM, Nature+ & HSS
**Cacao: Group B**;
•Clodsire; IFM, Nature+ & IFS
•ABB Blastoise; IFM, Nature+, IFS & HSM
(Note1: Another highly demanding Ingredient for the builds. Clodsire is in my opinion the better option but it also competes with its Candy with Quagsire which is typically used for Mushrooms)
(Note2: Keep in mind Blastoise has Ingredient Magnet and will bring potentially bring in a lot of filler Ingredients as well, filling your bag quicker.)

**Milk: Group A**;
•Blastoise (level 30); Neutral
**Milk: Group B**;
•Blastoise; IFM & Nature+
(Note: for the other two B Dishes a Neutral Blastoise actually suffices)

**Egg: Group A**;
•Blissey; HSM
•Blissey (level 30); IFM & HSM
**Egg: Group B**;
•Blissey; IFM & Nature+

**Oil: Group A**;
•ABB Luxray; Nature+
•Toxicroak; IFM
**Oil: Group B**;
•ABB Luxray; IFM, IFS & Nature+
•Toxicroak; IFM, IFS, HSS & Nature+
(Another demanding Ingredient. Shinx is more difficult to find appear only on OGPP as opposed to Groagunk which is on GG, CB, TH and ST, but the latter also needs a near perfect build to keep functioning as opposed to the former which requires just a little less RNG).

**Honey: Group A**;
•Venusaur; Neutral
•Pinsir; Neutral
•Venusaur (level 30); HSS
**Honey: Group B**;
•Venusaur; IFM
•Pinsir; IFM & HSS
•Venusaur (level 30); IFM, Nature+ & HSM
(Note: Keep in mind Venusaur has Ingredient Magnet and will bring potentially bring in a lot of filler Ingredients as well, filling your bag quicker. Regretfully Pinsir isn’t really a viable alternative due to it’s rarity).

**Apple: Group A**;
•Skeledirge; Neutral
•Skeledirge (level 30); IFM
**Apple: Group B**;
•Skeledirge; IFM
•Skeledirge (level 30); IFM, Nature+ & HSS

**Avocado: Group A**;
•Flygon; Neutral
•Flygon (level 34); IFM & HSS
