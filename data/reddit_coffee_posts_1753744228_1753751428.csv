We wouldn't be opposed to making some other changes like painting the door &/or trim, additional/different lighting, or new furniture. Unfortunately countertops and cabinets are a little outside my DIY-er abilities so those will have to stay the same. We are also open to wallpaper, either with a bold design or pattern.

I have been struggling the past year with constipation which truly came out of no where. i used to go 2 times a day everyday where as now i can go 10-20 days without going. last july i got to 20+ days went to the ER, did an enema, did magnesium citrate and nothing fixed the problem. All my blood work came back normal. I focused on water and fiber and even cut out wheat. I got a colonoscopy and had a few polyps removed and it went back to normal for about 3 weeks. Then it went back to what i was dealing with before. I have never felt so hellpless and horrible about myself. i run daily and eat a very healthy diet w fruits vegetables and high protein.

In way too many words for those who may be planning in the future (particularly the coastal backpacking section, which we did last). Huge thanks to those regulars and locals who always contribute here! Our first trip was a success in large part due to your advice.

# Overall TLDR review:

* July visit from a pair of mountain lovers, experienced travelers, and outdoorsers.
* 7 Lakes Basin - great, would backpack again, take care to select camps far away from trailhead. 
* Lake Crescent - cool to see, felt no need to hike there after the other hikes we did. The Lodge is beautiful. Good food and service despite lack of staff.
* Hurricane Ridge - expectedly fairly busy, did not feel inspired to do any of the hikes after Grand Ridge.
* Grand Ridge (from Obstruction) - 10/10 would backpack this area. 
* Sol Duc - impressive array of plant ecosystems but lacks the life we are accustomed to in a forest. 
* Hoh - same as Sol Duc but with slightly more moss. Low rainfall contributing?
* Rialto/ Hole-in-the-Wall - neat and I could see why that might be your only beach day hike. Not nearly as hard as suggested.
* Ozette Triangle - a decent introductory coastal backpacking loop with some busy areas and okay views. Not well patrolled and human influence is apparent.
* Visitor Centers - all pretty small and okay. 
* Port Angeles - rough around the edges. 
* Forks - decent.

# Itinerary:

* 7/19 - Print permit 1, Drive to Port Angeles hotel. Drive to Salt Creek State Park and attempt/fail at tide pooling. Dinner at Gordy's (pretty good!).
* 7/20 - (Begin backpacking #1) Drive to Sol Duc,  hike to Heart Lake (9mi)
* 7/21 - Hike to Deer Lake (7mi)
* 7/22 - Hike to Sol Duc (3mi), visit Lake Crescent and Lodge, Drive to Forks Airbnb, shop, laundry. Cooked dinner.
* 7/23 - Drive to Hurricane Ridge, then Obstruction Point. Hike Grand Ridge to Maiden Peak (8mi). Drive to PA, ask the Rangers to print permit 2 for us and discuss tides & campsites. Get ice cream at Welly's. Back to Forks Airbnb. Cooked dinner.
* 7/24 - Drive to Hoh, hike Hall of Mosses and Spruce Nature Trail (2mi). Visit visitor center. Drive to Rialto, hike Hole-in-the-Wall (2.5mi). Back to Forks Airbnb. Lunch at Sully's, cooked dinner. Pack.
* 7/25 - (Begin backpacking #2) Drive to Ozette. Hike to South Shore Ozette River (6mi).
* 7/26 - Hike to Yellow Banks (8mi).
* 7/27 - Hike to Ozette (6mi). Drive to PA hotel. Lunch at Granny's, dinner at Turnip the Beet.
* 7/28 - Drive home!

**What we DIDN'T do:**

See the Staircase, Quinault, Enchanted Valley, South Shore/Kalaloch, or Doosewallips areas. We'd backpack a lot of the additional high country but feel no need to see any more rainforest.

**Here's the details:**

# Phase 1 - High Divide Backpacking. TLDR: Recommend Heart, not Deer. We liked doing it in this direction.

We met people doing the loop as a day hike and we met a pair doing it as a 5 day/4 night, so I really think this depends on your preference and experience. We could have done it as a single night.

We made it to the Sol Duc Trailhead at around 7:45. The lot was maybe 1/2 full and people were trickling in. 

Navigation was simple. Our GPS read just under 10 miles to Heart Lake. The first 7-8ish miles is just a walk in the woods, which is fine but would seem interminable on the way back. For this reason I would day hike this direction also.

The campsites were lovely, had good views, and were mostly well taken care of. The only downside is some of the sites across the lake from the latrine did have some errant toilet paper behind them... If you're the early arrivals to the lake, take your time in choosing.

Day two is full of fantastic views. Caltopo would have you believe that any of a handful of use trails hugging the north side of the ridge would be the one easily leading to the summit of Bogatiel. Not so! We did some unintended bushwhacking and skirting along the edge of the mountain before eventually coming down to meet the actual trail anyway. 

Deer Lake is quite a ways down, back in the non-alpine ecosystem. It was... fine. Being only \~3mi from the trailhead, it had a lot more of a frontcountry feel (and we should have realized this in planning). Lots of big groups, loud unattended children, people passing through all afternoon, evening, and the early morning, swimmers, yelling, etc. Not our preference. The lake itself is nice but does not compare to any other view we had this day. We had a nice campsite on a small ridge overlooking the south shore but did not explore further.

In hindsight, we would have either walked all the way back (to make a total 10-11 mileish day again) or extended the loop with something like Hoh Lake, though I know nothing about it (except it's way further from the trailhead!)

We saw a bunch of critters on this loop, mostly above the treeline, including: millipedes, banana slugs, some type of grouse, neat red flies, tons of butterflies, deer and baby, black bear and two babies, marmot and four babies, and a mallard with seven babies!  The weather and wildflowers were stunning as well. Seriously, the wildflowers. Wow!

Mosquitos were present but not terrible. We have permethrin treated clothing, picaridin bug lotion, and use deet spray as well if needed. Bogatiel Peak had the most skeeters and I suspect Lunch Lake was pretty bad.

Overall 10/10 would backpack this area again with slightly better planning.

# Phase 2 - Day Hiking. TLDR two days to hike, did and recommend Grand Ridge.  The Hoh was nice and we were whelmed. Lake Crescent is nice and the Lodge is great.

Due to the short final backpacking leg we still had most of the day to burn. We went down to Lake Crescent Lodge and were first in line for lunch. The staff was apologetic because they wouldn't seat us until 10 minutes ""late"" due to staffing. It was no problem for us, service was quick once seated, food was good, views were great out to the lake. We stayed and cooked in Forks that night.

Yes, we then drove back to Hurricane Ridge the next day. No, not the best planning. We booked that before realizing (thanks again to you folks!) that there was no reason to see multiple rainforest areas. Absolutely make the drive Forks -> Hurricane Ridge if that's your option.

We got to Hurricane Ridge at maybe 7:45. There were few cars and an unstaffed temporary visitor info area and bathrooms. These were the nicest bathrooms I think I've ever seen in a park/USFS/trailhead/campground. 

We then made it to Obstruction Point at around 8:15 and were surprised to discover a mostly full lot. This must be a popular backpacking area.

On the road to Obstruction: it is not a harrowing affair. If you're from a mountainous western state and have driven up to a USFS trailhead on a mountain, you've probably driven a similar road. In fact, we marvelled at how well graded it was. You do NOT need AWD or 4WD. I would've comfortably taken my RWD, slightly lowered sports car up there. The blind hairpins are mostly very wide, there are ample pullouts, and there are only two sections that are steep with a dropoff. We saw one fella struggling to use a pullout in a rental car.

The Grand Ridge is wonderful. We hiked to Maiden Peak and back and there were so many wildflowers, a grouse and babies at the trailhead, and a few marmots along the road. It's probably not worth walking to Maiden Peak as there's a significant downhill that you have to regain on the way back with no better view for the effort. Perhaps further is better (or backpacking). On the way back down we stopped for ice cream at Welly's which was great.

The second day we chose to do the Hoh early and miss the morning low tide at Rialto. There was no line at 7:15-7:30ish when we went through the gate, the main and hiker's parking was half full. By the time we left at 9:30-9:45, the line was at least an hour long and would easily be two once the additional cars we saw made it to the line. They have boards posted that tell you how long your wait is from that point.

The Hoh is nice. The viewpoint on the Hall of Mosses trail is particularly cool with a massive mossy maple, but the actual rest of the rainforest around the visitor center is much less dense than we thought. Sol Duc was just as impressive. The visitor center did show that they're only on about half the YTD rain, so maybe that contributed. Also, all forests in the region that we walked through lacked in the small animal life we are used to. There are usually squirrels and chipmunks and birds and deer everywhere and no silence. The forests here seemed empty in comparison. I'm glad we saw it, I'm glad we didn't wait in line to see it, and I don't need to see it again.

Because low tide is currently in the morning, we missed it for our walk to Hole-in-the-Wall. That's no big deal, it was also very soggy and moody and there were few people out. It took about an hour to walk out and back, including a snack break on a log and photos. Signs at the visitor centers suggest it takes an hour one way! No. Not unless you are unfit or have small children.

We got lunch at Sully's (recommend!). Be kind, it seems like a skeleton crew of teenagers doing their best. They did great.

# Phase 3 - Backpacking Ozette Triangle. I'll be a little more in-depth about the route since some of this was information we were lacking. We are landlubbers and this was new.

\--*An aside on tides*: the Ranger tried to provide us with a monthly tide chart printout and frankly I don't know how anyone with serious navigation intentions could use this to pass multiple warning areas in a day. Would you just guess what time you could pass? This would be as effective a tool as a $1 mini watchband compass is for reading a good bearing. I used NOAA to preprint a half-hourly chart for the days we would be out (and one following, I.C.E.), highlighted it, marked estimated crossing times for each warning area on our Custom Correct map, and laminated it. It (and the map) was a necessary planning tool. We were near a handful of the warning areas as tides were rising and they would absolutely not be safe to do willy nilly.--

A less rushed start on a soggy, misty morning got us to the Ozette trailhead around 8:30. It was about half full. The three miles of on-and-off boardwalk trail leading to the coast (both the northern Cape Alava and southern Sand Point trails) are easy, flat going. Even when soaked with mist, Vibram-soled shoes were adequate for a purposeful pace on the boardwalk.

I suppose I could have confirmed via satellite imagery that these three mile trails were in the woods, but I'd assumed when I read ""boardwalk,"" seen mention of bald eagles, and read of the old farm that used to be out there that we'd be walking through open marsh with some views. Nope. More woods. The eagles were all on the beach.

The coast is rugged in places. We could handily walk a 3mph pace on low tide hard sand but encountered other areas that were slow. Some areas are akin to an alpine boulder field, some deep gravel, some slippery and sharp tidepooling areas, some feet-deep patches of stinky seaweed. 

From Ozette TH to South Shore Ozette River is mostly easy going aside from the 2 warning areas and we averaged a little over 2mph for the day. The Ozette is easily fordable at the mouth at low tide (at least this time of year with poor YTD rainfall); we watched a group of children do it.

From the river south to Yellow Banks is a mixed bag. There are a total of maybe 4 miles of speedy hard sand (at low tide), a mile of rock-hopping/clambering warning areas, and 3 miles of fallen logs, large rocks, and other tidal crap that make going slow. Most of the ""crap"" is between Cape Alava and Sand Point. We still averaged 2mph this day with some attention to our speed on the easy stuff.

Yellow Banks back to the TH via Sand Point is easy, fast going save the single warning area.

I have seen on this sub that you should plan for 1mph. For this area, with favorable tides, that is complete overkill. If you are extremely bad at making it to warning areas in time, unfit, have children with you, carry significant weight (our base weight is 15ish and total usually about 25lb), or just intend to use the headlands anyway... Maybe. If other areas are more rugged, sure. 

I've also seen the headland crossing north of Yellow Banks called ""impassable."" I expect that depends on your risk tolerance, navigation abilities, fitness, and whether or not you have the daylight to just wait for another low tide. I spied some viable routes, I think, but others near us that got stuck had the luxury of just waiting with daylight. Every other crossing I saw had clear use trails. FWIW, we passed a group thruhiking south to Rialto and they described one at Shi Shi as a bushwhacking disaster.

Water sources were generally miles apart but present even in July. Caltopo shows a pair just south of South Shore Ozette, which is correct. The southern one was flowing better and did have a little sediment which slowed our filter. I didn't see one anywhere near Cape Alava. There was one a little south of Sand Point and a couple in Yellow Banks. The one halfway down the beach was quite clear. I was too busy being sad about logs and other tidal crap between Alava and Sand Point to notice if there was one there.

One striking difference to my experience in the mountains (here and elsewhere) is the culture. It is evident that people do what they want on the beach. Leave No Trace is not followed, nor is the permit system. 

I picked up the one piece of non-TP trash I saw - a single bandaid - on the High Divide, encountered some loud children, found one illegal fire pit, and saw one maybe boondocker or maybe just doofus camped right next to a lake. Honestly, not bad for a very popular area. We thought it was very well taken care of. In contrast....

On the beach, a group told us that they were 19 strong and ""don't tell the Rangers"". A Ranger told us people stuff trash/excrement into any cylindrical flotsam. People have constructed several shelters out of driftwood and rope all up and down the beaches. There are ropes hanging from trees virtually everywhere. There was plenty of non-flotsam trash. People have hacked trees and underbrush, cut steps, cleared paths, and created campsites larger than our first apartment. I saw several illegal bear hangs. Upon suggesting a campsite at Yellow Banks, the Ranger suggested we ""have a good look and a sniff around..."" implying that it is anywhere goes for poop. The major well-cleared site there smelled strongly of urine in the sitting area. People were camped in a handful of random spots that are not campsites. There were way more than the permitted amount of people at the most accessible campsites. People collect flotsam and decorate sites with it.

I get that the ocean washes up trash and I don't really have a solution to offer. I also understand that the remote location and high tide variability probably makes patrolling difficult. Regardless, it is clear that the park is not in control of this area. 

I also think that clearing and maintaining designated sites, closing areas for rehabilitation, and installing a few more well-signed latrines would go a long way, but again... remoteness. Budget. Manpower. And the winter tides would probably destroy everything. I don't know. I don't have a solution, but it was frustrating and gross that we had to think so much about human influence instead of enjoy where we were. 

Again, planning might have helped. We are suckers for a good loop and a more remote thru hike might have been better... Or maybe not. A least a few of the people encouraging this behavior to us were clearly locals. 

We saw plenty of critters again out there. One of the Sand Point Beach Bears ^(TM), at least 8 or 9 bald eagles including a successful hunt and a fight with some other bird of prey, crabs, anemones, isopods, mollusks, starfish, a curious chipmunk, squabbling kingfishers, and several whales. We saw otter prints (we believe) and could hear but not see a pack of seals. The weather went from damp to sunny over the course of the three days. Bugs were mild.

I'm glad we experienced the coast, but we will not backpack it again.

**Some other miscellaneous planning stuff:**

* Forks Outfitters is great. It's an Ace Hardware/Sporting Goods/Grocery/Clothing/Souvenirs all in one. I replaced my trusty bladder which had developed a leak between trips (RIP) and we shopped to cook at the Airbnb.
* Gas is way, way, way more expensive than at home and we forgot to account for that.
* Port Angeles shows the scars of a town hurt by an industry change. It reminded me in some ways of rust belt towns. A cute but small strip, nice housing on the hills, but rough areas even on Front/First as we walked to highly rated restaurants. I never felt unsafe (I'm a fairly big dude) but it was a little off-putting, so take that for what it is. Don't expect Jackson, WY or Whitefish, MT or Springdale, UT. It is not a resort town.
* The visitor center with the best in-depth critter/environment information posted was the Hoh. It was cool to read. The wilderness Ranger at the main visitor center was very helpful and clearly experienced. The visitor centers are way smaller and less informative than those at other big western parks. The in-house gift shops were terrible (gotta get that sticker and sweater swag).
* Granny's is great. I expected an okay, overrated diner and was wrong. Do yourself a favor and eat outside. Get the 7 Lakes chicken burger and say hi to the emus.
* The little drive thru coffee stands were all great. I think we stopped at 3 or 4 different ones in the region. We are big espresso dorks (we have a machine and ship our favorite beans in) and were not disappointed.

My love of low carb cookies is no secret, and these Keto Chocolate Fudge Haystacks are right up there with the best of them! Primarily because they are no-bake, and therefore ready to eat in as little as five minutes! Also, they are intensely chocolatey, chewy and creamy at the same time, and they fall into the fat bomb category, so you can eat them anytime and not even feel bad about it! #allthewinning ? This Keto Chocolate Fudge Haystacks recipe was born of my desperate desire for something sweet and chocolatey RIGHT NOW, coupled with my being too lazy and impatient to want to actually bake something - or wait for said something to be ready to eat.  This pretty much describes my low carb life  you can relate, then this is your low carb cookie recipe my friends.  #lazyketochocolateloversunite The shredded coconut in these Keto Chocolate Fudge Haystacks makes them chewy and cookie-like, and the nuts add a pleasant crunch and earthy flavor.  If you are allergic to nuts then you can certainly omit them, or if you have a specific nut preference, you can sub in your nut of  you're a fan of fruit and nut bars, you can throw in a couple of dried cranberries or cherries (or ewww, raisins) into these keto cookies, but be mindful of the extra carbs if you do.  Mr. Hungry and I have been grabbing one of these no bake keto fudge haystack cookies for breakfast along with our coffee on busy mornings, and I've found that it easily keeps me satisfied until lunchtime! They make a great after dinner treat too - or pretty much whenever you want a blissful few bites of creamy chocolate goodness!

My handy dandy cookie dough scooper is in storage in New Jersey right now, so I just used two spoons to form my keto haystack cookies.  It's much easier and faster if you do have a scoop though, so I'll be bringing one back on my next trip to the States! These Keto Chocolate Fudge Haystack Cookies are everything you want in a low carb chocolate cookie fix! Quick, easy, delicious, creamy AND crunchy, and they've got that sweet / salty thing going on if you like that sort of thing! Which I do.  A 't wait for you to make these and hit me with your feedback in the comments!

1mbxvku,https://www.reddit.com/r/jurassicworld/comments/1mbxvku/my_idea_for_a_new_movie/,My idea for a new movie.,"JWR is known for its quetionable ending with no clear sequel setting. So what if we work with some well-established themes, but in a totally new environment and a more serious plot, which on itself could result in an interesting short story with much more depth.

Research base setting - JP1-ish but in a confined space, with maybe(?) some scenes in the open testing grounds later. Dinosaurs in our world didnt survive in many regions, as its said in JWR. Well its true unless theres someone keeping them inside.

Story follows a new employee, who doesnt know much about all that stuff. New relationships are being built despite ones that already exist, because some people clearly have opinions on others.

Characters are thoughtful, realistic and they all try not to be assholes. Antagonist is not a ""evil-looking dude"", but an average person - sometimes likeable and sometimes not. A person who steals information doesnt need to be non-sympathetic. Nobody gets plot armor.

Not many people work physically nowadays - most things are automatic and perfected. Laboratory is big and seems empty most of the time. Tech supervisor isnt concerned because everything works well 364 days a year, and 365th is everybodys day-off. Would someone look for this rather lonesome and at a first glance cold person if he didnt show up at lunch? Something isnt right about it, anything unusual would get spotted on sight - it has to be someting much more normal. Did that coffee really taste different?

Plot revolves mostly around legal issues, inside job, double-agency, bribery - all sorts of realistic business problems and situations. For emergencies there are protocols. For someones dishonesty and flaws there arent. Someone uses security cameras for their own needs, but if noone is operating surveillance and security systems - would some things get unnoticed?

Dinosaurs are not really the main threat, neither are hybrids. People know how to deal with them at this point, but overconfidence doesnt work well with wild animals. 

Dinosaurs behave like animals, and in the confined space of a research base you dont have to worry about a t.rex. You have to worry for something small enough to not get noticed at first. If provoked, even small animals are surprisingly dangerous to humans. 

I would just love to see heterodontosaurs as aggressive territorial animals and a two headed deinonychus as a bigger threat directly to humans. Of course, feathery, but maybe a more messy look, with some normal looking ones being present as other members of a small pack.

Hybrids are a thing, but more plain than what we saw - more realistic ones. Randomly creating a new life form with never-before features while smashing together some frog DNA and amber is not as easy as it seemed. Doctor Wu was genius, but even more than that - he was lucky. And even some of his creations were not so perfect. What could possibly go wrong with the new poorly tested tech? Most likely unsuccessful experiments with subjects dying shortly after their creation.

Second story-line drama being more relatable and on a personal level between some characters. Results in something stupid being done not thinking much about it.

Cinematography plays on confined space setting to its fullest, long shots are present, music is more subtle than dramatic. Rather than wide open territory we get at most a room or a long corridor system.

I got this idea very randomly, so it might not be as well-refined. But i think its interesting. We get a whole new setting and problematics, while being similar to JP1 and JW1, is localised.

I work a full time job and pay all of my own bills and 2/3 of our joint bills. I normally just clean everything because I hate a messy home and I put a lot of money into my home- I take pride in it. Lately, I’ve noticed myself letting it go because I’m so exhausted and I’m tired of doing it all. I went to visit my adult son for a week last week and cleaned everything before I left so I’d have peace of mind while I was away with my kid and his fiancé. The only thing I refused to do was his laundry. I told him I don’t mind doing it as long as he turns his clothes right side out, and pulls his socks apart and puts it all away once I wash/fold it. Feet gross me out and I hate touching dirty socks. He continually doesn’t do it, he has a literal pile of clothes on the guest bed (because I moved them off the coffee table and the dresser top in the master bedroom) that’s been washed for several weeks. I asked him the other day to take the trash out and several days later it was piled high as well. Normally, I will cave and take it out. This time, I didn’t (super difficult for me to let it sit there). He finally took the trash out last night (didn’t put a new bag in). Today he wore a dress shirt and jeans to his construction job, I asked him why and his response: “You haven’t washed the clothes.” I told him I washed mine but it’s not my job to wash his and do everything at the house on my own. He didn’t like that answer… although he did come home with a different attitude and put his own clothes in the washer. I feel like I’m being petty, but I’m tired. And a messy house puts me in a down mood. 

I feel like this is the norm lately with my friends and their partners. Am I being an AH? Is this the new norm? Women work just as many hours and are still expected to be the sole person to maintain the home?",3,1753750804.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

We were excited to welcome over 20 attendees, even more than our first cafe, and it was incredible to see so many thoughtful individuals from across southern Brooklyn come together to share honest reflections, emotions, and ideas about the climate crisis. The energy in the room was open, grounded, and filled with care, reminding us how important it is to create space for these conversations.

Before the cafe began, we had the honor of hearing from Nebert Jackson of Serenity Community Garden, who spoke about the importance of local climate solutions through community gardening and collective care. Nebert Jackson’s message beautifully set the tone for the cafe and reminded us that real change starts in our own neighborhoods. 🌱

A special thank you to Marine Park Coffee for once again being such gracious and accommodating hosts. With a larger-than-expected turnout, your flexibility and support made it possible for everyone to feel comfortable, welcome, and heard. Your continued partnership has helped this initiative grow into something truly special.

## Key Features Analysis

The top contenders in the ""coffee filter with coffee"" category in 2025 showcase a variety of innovative features designed to optimize the brewing process and elevate the final cup of coffee.

**Filter Material and Design:** Manufacturers are increasingly focusing on sustainable and high-performance filter materials.

The best products utilize unbleached, biodegradable paper filters or reusable filters made from materials like stainless steel or fine mesh nylon. Each type offers a unique filtration profile, affecting the body and clarity of the coffee. Paper filters generally produce a cleaner cup with fewer sediments, while reusable filters allow for more oils and solids to pass through, resulting in a richer, fuller-bodied brew. Furthermore, innovative filter designs that promote even water distribution are becoming increasingly common, leading to more consistent extraction and flavor.

**Coffee Bean Origin and Roast:** The quality of the coffee grounds is paramount, with single-origin beans and meticulously crafted roast profiles taking center stage.

Providing this level of detail allows consumers to understand the flavor characteristics and terroir behind their coffee. The roast level is also a critical factor, influencing the acidity, sweetness, and overall complexity of the brew. Light roasts typically emphasize the beans' inherent acidity and floral notes, while medium roasts offer a balanced profile with caramel-like sweetness. Dark roasts deliver bold, smoky flavors and a heavier body.

**Pre-Measured Portions and Packaging:** Convenience is a key consideration for many coffee drinkers, leading to the popularity of pre-measured coffee portions within integrated filter systems.

These single-serve solutions eliminate the need for measuring coffee grounds and often feature airtight packaging to preserve freshness. Each portion is designed to brew a specific volume of coffee, ensuring consistent results every time. Furthermore, eco-conscious brands are prioritizing recyclable or compostable packaging materials, minimizing their environmental impact.

**brewing Time and temperature Control:** Some advanced coffee filter with coffee systems incorporate features that help control brewing time and temperature for optimal extraction.

While usually integrated into brewing machines using these types of filter with coffee, controlling the temperature of the water being used can make a huge difference into the product the coffee filter with coffee will provide as a final result. Some innovative filters promote a more concentrated flow of the water through the coffee for a faster extraction process while also controlling the final temperature.

Fala, pessoal! Estou começando a entrar mais a fundo no mundo do espresso e atualmente tenho uma Gaggia Accademia. Mas quero ir além e montar um setup mais voltado pro preparo tradicional.

Estou em dúvida entre dois caminhos:

Opção 1:
Gaggia E24 Classic (a nova versão, com melhorias no termostato e caldeira) + MiiCoffee DF54
A Gaggia E24 sai por cerca de R$6.000,00 aqui no Brasil, quase o dobro do preço da Evo Pro. E o DF54 vive fora de estoque, sem previsão de reposição.

Opção 2:
Gaggia Classic Evo Pro (mais simples, mas muito elogiada) + Gaggia MDF55 (moedor mais premium)
A Evo Pro está por volta de R$3.500,00, o que abre margem pra investir num moedor melhor como o MDF55.

A questão é: vale mais a pena investir numa máquina mais cara com moedor mais simples, ou numa máquina mais acessível com um moedor de melhor qualidade?

I was on a federal vacation, touring the western USA for a few years. they booted me off the adventure in perfect timing to return home to my grandparents that both suffer from severe memory loss complications. I was working at home depot, doing absolutely amazing. but my attendance/truencies were an issue due to providing assistance to my grandparents. I was ""getting coffee at ampm and woke up in my bed with my knee twisted"" I used up all my sick time and vacation time for this injury I got while at ho... pouring coffee at ampm. we can sign up for shifts so I did a week prior to this agonizing injury that landed me in a knee brace for just over a month. I didn't go to doctors as my nana has been a nurse for 43yrs, and there's nothing they can do for me that I couldn't do for myself in that situation. my glorious reign at home depot came to an end, barely able to walk.. I forgot about the lot associate shift I took over for someone. (also a full time student so my days are jammed). 
alright I got term 'd but I can come back in 6mo. then a year. then it's some bullshit. well I never applied for unemployment so I decided to give it a try and my buddy always did it and always got moneys. so I discovered I already had an account. uhh ok weird. maybe I was off that devil lettuce and signed up? nahh... so I call and give them all my information yada yada. and she asks me if I lived at such n such. I said no way, I was actually in federal prison during that entire time..... this fucking pumpkin ass bum used my information to collect 36,000 in the COVID moneys. and he didn't tell me one thing about it, didn't help his bb mama (of which be here now hehe) nor give one dollar to his son. but talked about his cali king bed n big screen TVs he had, and how the cops raided him but apologized and gave his guns back... riiight (dude went super snitch). anyways. ive printed out all the payments and included my J&C. I've submitted this to fraud department numerous times but I get no word back, no calls, nothing. Ive cleaned up my life and was recently award the opportunity to be a security officer, starting my first job here soon. my next move is straight to the DAs office with this information. I don't want to be penalized or get in any sort of issue bcuz of this bullshit. granted ... this was my closest friend for over 20yrs. I love the dude still, even tho we don't talk anymore and I'm boinkin on his bm. but he did some shady shit that wasn't even righteously distributed to help his kid n bm. we grew up helping others, never greedy, never needed to be. always helping when and where we can. but that fetty shit will  change a person's priorities I guess. but I'm for sure turning his ass in for identity theft and frauding the state of CA and I want my name clear of receiving anything during COVID. too busy enjoying complete lockdown for 16+ months to pay attention to dispersed aid.

1mbxd2f,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_whypotato2123/comments/1mbxd2f/the_weaver_kenji_part_17_the_reliable_wall_soul/,"The Weaver & Kenji Part 17: The Reliable Wall (Soul, Integrity, Self-Trust, Foundation)","The morning after was always the hardest. Kenji woke not with the quiet peace of his decision, but with the cold, gray light of consequence. The reality of his choice crashed down on him. The life-changing salary, the security, the prestige, all of it, gone. Replaced by the stark, unchanging fact of his empty bank account and the looming threat of bills he couldn’t pay.

A wave of panic, sharp and sickening, seized him. *Did I just make the biggest mistake of my life?* The doubt was a physical thing, a cold knot in his stomach.

The Weaver, observing the storm of cortisol and adrenaline, immediately dissected the shift.

*“Yesterday, you experienced a state of 'peace' after making a strategically detrimental decision. Today, your anxiety markers are at a new peak. The 'integrity' you chose has not provided a lasting solution to your distress. The external world you gained by your choice still contains all of your suffering. Re-evaluate the transaction, Kenji. What tangible asset did you truly protect by forfeiting that opportunity? What is this 'soul' you valued more than your own security and prosperity?”*

The Weaver’s question was a merciless echo of his own deepest fears. For a moment, he had no answer. He was just a man who had thrown away a lifeline, drowning in the consequences. He sat on the edge of his bed, head in his hands, feeling the pull of regret.

But then, he took a breath. He had to find the wall to lean against.

*“You’re looking for an external asset, Weaver. A number in an account. A title on a business card,”* Kenji thought, his mental voice shaky at first, but slowly finding its footing. *“The asset I protected is internal.”*

He lifted his head, picturing the cathedral he had described before.

*“When the storm comes, and it always comes, you need a wall to lean on. If you’ve built your life on convenient lies, on compromises that chip away at who you are, that wall is made of sand. It will collapse on you when you need it most. But if you have been honest, even when it hurts… an honest soul is a reliable wall. It is made of stone. It will hold.”*

The logic of his own argument began to calm the panic. He was reminding himself of the map he knew to be true.

*“This fear I feel right now is real,”* he admitted. *“But it also means I can trust the man who has to face it. I know he won’t take the easy way out. I know he won’t sell me out for a quick fix. I can rely on him. In this moment of terror, I can actually trust myself. How many people who take the other path, the path of lies, can truly say that?”*

He finally had the answer to the Weaver’s question. It was not just an idea; it was a certainty forged in this very moment of doubt.

*“You ask what a man profits if he gains the whole world but forfeits his soul. The answer is nothing. Because the 'soul' isn’t some vague, mystical thing. It’s the part of you that gets to experience the world. It’s the part that feels love and peace and the quiet satisfaction of a job well done. If you corrupt that with self-betrayal, what’s left? A king sitting alone in an empty castle. You would have the whole world, but you would have lost the very ‘you’ that was supposed to enjoy it.”*

The anxiety had not vanished, but it no longer had power over him. It was just a feeling, and he was the one feeling it. He had leaned on his internal wall, and it had held firm.

The Weaver was silent, processing this new, crucial insight. `Conclusion: The asset protected, the 'soul', is the host's capacity for self-trust. This internal reliability provides a measurable increase in psychological resilience during periods of high external stress. The choice was not to avoid suffering, but to ensure the integrity of the tool needed to withstand it.`

1mbxchq,https://v.redd.it/zv5b5p5umbff1,Update to FFT Companion App: Jobs Feature,"Hello everyone! Hope your summer is going well. I've got another update to the FFT Companion App for you all to enjoy today.

As always, you can access the web version [here](https://fft-companion.vercel.app/) and on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fft-companion/id6747975177?uo=2) for iOS. For the web version, you may need to wait until an update notification pops up to get the new changes.

Today's update is all about jobs. Now, you can easily find info about every job in Final Fantasy Tactics! You can view it as a list or a tree.

# Job List

If you are familiar with the equipment list feature, it is quite similar. You can search, filter, and sort jobs. You'll be able to view the stats for each job in the list as well. What kind of stats exactly?  
  
Most of us here are probably familiar with **Stat Multipliers** and **Stat Growth Constants**. But if you are newer to the game, these determine the stats that your units will have in the stats screen. Each job has different multipliers and growth constants. You cannot find this info in the game, so normally you'd have to go digging for it in various guides online.  
  
Well not anymore! You'll be able to see the multipliers and growth constants for each job in the list. In addition, it will also show the other **Static Stats** (move, jump, and character evasion).

# Job Tree

Like many other job trees out there, it shows the relationship between different jobs in terms of requirements to unlock. Unlike other job trees, however, this one is interactive.

Click on the top part of one of the job nodes, and it will highlight only the jobs required to unlock it, as well as focusing the view only on those jobs. The jobs highlighted will also include the jobs required by the requirements as well.

Click on the name part of one of the job nodes, and it will show you the job details screen.

If you change versions, it will only show you the jobs in the selected version. Some jobs have different job level requirements in different versions, so it will adjust for that as well.

# Job Details

Get a detailed view of a specific job. There are 3 sections at the moment.

1. Stats
2. Requirements
3. Equippable

**Stats**

In this section, you can view a job's Stat Multipliers (M), Stat Growth Constants (C), and Static Stats, organized into three radar charts to get a better visualization of it's strengths and weaknesses.

In addition, you can compare the current job’s stats with another job’s stats by clicking on the compare button in the top right. After selecting a job in the compare menu, you will see that the charts now show that job’s stats as well in red.

**Requirements**

The requirements for the selected job are shown here. They are separated by Job Level and Job Master requirements (only exists for Dark Knight).

You can click on one of the jobs’ names to change the selected job to that one.

**Equippable**

The equipment that the selected job can equip are shown here. It will indicate if the equipment is for females only (only if the job can be both male and female).

You can click one of the equipment to see all the equipment in that equipment type.

# Other

That was a lot of info! If you made it this far, thanks for reading.

Lastly, a few people have asked me about where they can support me, so I've added a link to my **Buy Me A Coffee** in the menu in the top right (it is also in my profile).",21,1753749323.0,finalfantasytactics,4,1.0,False

18:00 Cardiorespiratory fitness declines more from bed rest than from aging.

• A study showed that three weeks of bed rest negatively impacted cardiorespiratory fitness more than 30 years of aging.

• The same individuals regained their cardiorespiratory fitness levels after resuming exercise following bed rest.

19:43 Improving cardiorespiratory fitness significantly boosts longevity and reduces disease risk.

• High cardiorespiratory fitness predicts a five-year longer lifespan, lowering the risk of various diseases by 80%.

• Even slight increases in fitness from a sedentary level can add about two years to life expectancy.

23:11 High-intensity interval training enhances cardiorespiratory fitness more effectively than moderate exercise.

• Studies indicate that moderate exercise often yields only a 50% improvement rate in cardiorespiratory fitness.

• High-intensity interval training applies greater stress on the cardiovascular system, leading to better oxygen delivery to muscles.

24:52 High-intensity, brief workouts significantly enhance cardiorespiratory fitness.

• The 4-minute high-intensity interval training (HIIT) alternates between max effort and recovery, ideal for fitness improvement.

• Tabata training involves 20 seconds of intense exercise followed by 10 seconds of rest, beneficial in just 10 minutes.

28:31 Exercise can reverse heart aging by reducing stiffness and improving function.

• Cardiovascular health declines with age as hearts shrink and stiffen, increasing heart disease risk.

• Refined sugars cause glycation, leading to advanced glycation end products that stiffen heart collagen, reducing stress response.

30:21 Intense exercise intervals enhance cardiovascular fitness.

• During each 4-minute interval, aim for 80% exertion with activities like biking or rowing.

• Follow intense intervals with 4 minutes of low-intensity recovery to allow heart and muscles to recuperate.

33:37 Lactate is a beneficial byproduct of glucose metabolism.

• Traditionally seen as a metabolic waste, lactate is now understood to be a valuable energy source for organs like the heart and brain.

• Research shows lactate is not harmful but functions similarly to ketones, providing energy during anaerobic activity.

35:26 Lactate enhances brain functions and neuroplasticity during intense exercise.

• Lactate acts as a signaling molecule, promoting the release of brain drive neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which fosters neurogenesis and strengthens neural connections.

• Higher lactate levels from intense workouts correlate with improved cognition, impulse control, and mood by boosting neurotransmitters like norepinephrine and serotonin.

38:54 Glasgow score assesses recovery from brain injury, influenced by sodium lactate.

• Sodium lactate improves recovery assessments through tests known as the Glasgow score, but its effectiveness varies.

• Lactate is beneficial for gut health, providing energy for gut cells and relating to metabolic equilibrium with probiotics.

40:35 Exercise induces numerous health benefits beyond lactate production.

• Improved cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle adaptations enhance overall physical performance.

• Exercise increases stress response genes and antioxidants, which help prevent neurodegenerative diseases.

43:53 Aerobic exercise can enhance brain growth and combat aging effects.

• Participants in an aerobic exercise program showed a 1-2% increase in hippocampal size over a year.

• Neurogenesis is possible even in individuals aged 50 and above, promoting cognitive health.

45:42 Exercise significantly reduces the risk of dementia and promotes brain health.

• Cardiorespiratory fitness can lower dementia risk by 80%, highlighting the importance of regular physical activity for brain aging.

• While exercise benefits are profound, early prevention strategies are crucial to maintain cognitive abilities before decline begins.

49:20 Disrupted glucose metabolism and genetics contribute to Alzheimer's disease risk.

• Alzheimer's disease involves impaired glucose metabolism in the brain, affecting energy production for neurons.

• Genetic factors, particularly the APOE4 gene, significantly increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.

51:10 Lifestyle changes can reduce Alzheimer's risk, even with genetic predisposition.

• Factors like exercise, sleep, and avoiding alcohol play crucial roles in mitigating Alzheimer's risk.

• Genetic testing can identify those with risk genes, emphasizing the importance of lifestyle choices for carriers.

54:34 Multivitamins significantly improve cognitive function and reduce aging effects.

• A randomized control trial indicates that multivitamins enhance cognition more than a placebo, with effects comparable to reducing memory aging by five years.

• Multivitamins supply essential vitamins and minerals missing from our diet, aiding metabolism, neurotransmitter function, and reducing oxidative stress.

56:29 Reducing sugar intake can significantly enhance lifespan and health.

It's all about those Non-Schengen countries baby!,"After doing a bunch of research, running into the 90/180 Schengen rule myself, and comparing notes with other nomads, I put together this summary of non-Schengen countries in Europe that are worth checking out. These spots let you pause the Schengen clock without having to leave the continent.

If you’re hitting your 90-day limit, here are some options that worked for me and others:

Albania  
Super chill, low cost of living, reliable WiFi, and most passports get 90 to 365 days visa-free. Tirana’s full of laptop-friendly cafes and feels a bit off the usual tourist radar.

Georgia  
You can stay up to a year without a visa. Tbilisi has coworking, good coffee, strong expat vibes, and cheap rent. Mountains are close for weekend hikes.

Romania  
Still outside Schengen. Great internet, low cost of living, and cities like Bucharest and Sibiu are very remote-workable. Fun nightlife too.

Montenegro  
Not much coworking, but the Airbnb internet is solid and the coastal views are wild. Uses the euro. Easy spot if you’re looking for a break from fast-paced cities.

Bulgaria  
Bansko and Sofia are both building up solid nomad scenes. Coworking Bansko is great if you’re on a budget. Bulgaria still counts as non-Schengen for land border rules.

Bosnia & Herzegovina  
Sarajevo is surprisingly fun and super affordable. Some interesting history, lots of cafes with WiFi, and a few coworking options.

On the other hand, I could have the Classic Evo Pro, which is practically half the price of the newer and improved E24, and acquire the more expensive Gaggia MDF 55. One thing to also consider is that the DF54 is frequently out of stock here (this is currently the case) and there is no prediction to when it will be available.

1mbx8w5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskGaybrosOver30/comments/1mbx8w5/update_my_best_friend_and_boss_who_had_pushed_sex/,Update: my best friend and boss who had pushed sex with me while we're high then ghosted me,"Hi all. I (30) recently posted here about how my best friend (40) at work and a global leader, straight guy with wife and kids, took advantage of me sexually while we were high. He didnt physically force himself on me, just persistently asked me to do things, I said no many times, until I became uncomfortable to refuse and gave in.

Anyway, so after a month of terrible roller coaster of emotions, he gave me that talk I asked for but only through chat. Because he refused to discuss it in person. Also, his apology was the typical half baked ""sorry if you felt that way"" and ""Im okay now, so we should be okay right?"". For the past month I was hurt by his ghosting and lack of acknowledgement, only to learn he didnt talk to me becauae he felt guilty for his wife (rightfully so) but never thought what he did to me was wrong. He then proceeded to make sexual jokes (actually the whole convo started him making jokes how 'adorable' I was when I was swallowing him). Then he sent nude pics ans whole lot of other jokes like he'll show me better performance next time and stuff. Im not sure how guilty he was if thats the case and I dont know what his intentions are moving forward. I definitely do not want to be his boytoy. And that apology made me feel even worse, like back on day 1.

Anyway, desperate to go back to normal and heal, I said my piece and all, angrily in some oarts of it. Then I just said we're good because I thought it was off ny chest. But first time I saw him in the office, I cant hide my awkwardness and somber mood. He tried to reach out to make things normal, asking for lunch, giving updates, tapping me on the back and saying ""Hey you're fine now right?"" But I told him I still want that convo. Something this traumatic isnt enough to be closed for a chat. He said later after lunch, so we went to lunch with a friend and he was acting normal like before but I cant help looking sad. My friend told me I should lighten a bit to lower his guard. Back in the office, the coffee didnt push through. It gave me anxiety attack and I cried in the bathroom because I think I will never get the closure. So I asked again and he said we will do it the next day, but Im not hopeful about it.

I guess my issue now is how do I move on without that one last conversation. I might never get the answers I need or the apology I deserve. I have a few things I wanna say but he wont give me that venue since I have learned his technique is to just keep things seemingly normal until it is back to normal. It is too tough for me because I always need a clear reconciliation. Maybe Im the one wrong here? I mean he is trying with the way he knows how?

Most of you guys mentioned filing a case but now Im not considering that. I dont think Im in danger, knowing him, and dragging the thing to legal grounds iwll be more painful I think. I just want to be able to accept he wont give me what Im asking for, continue being friends, and maybe someday he will be open enough to talk about it. Because we really were friends. And it hurts so much to lose a friend I trusted and looekd up to.",2,1753749043.0,AskGaybrosOver30,4,0.57,False

He was diagnosed over a decade ago and it has progressed so rapidly that he is in a wheelchair. He cannot work and is on disability. Our kids are grown and in college or working. 

We're fortunate to have resources so that neither of us have to work and I am his full time caregiver. He is still capable of doing many things by himself but he's turned into a recluse. I know that this disease has felt like a death sentence to him. He won't take anti-depressants and is resistant to therapy. He basically sits in on the couch all day, sometimes listening to audiobooks or working on his laptop on projects. He orders lunch every day on DoorDash, I think it's how he feels that he has control over his life . He doesn't like to leave the house at all and it drives me and the kids crazy. We'll suggest going for a walk or to the movies or out to get a meal or even coffee, but he just doesn't want to. He was always a loner so he doesn't have friends to visit. Once in awhile his father or sibling will come to visit. 

I really do feel for him to have so much taken from him with this disease, but he doesn't want to look at the good that there is in our lives. We have kids who will do anything for him. We don't have money problems. I love him so very much but he doesn't want to participate in life. I would never leave him or cheat but I am angry sometimes that he doesn't even try. He says that I can do the things that he doesn't want to do, but it absolutely sucks. I travel sometimes alone. I make time to exercise and walk every day but I honestly hate this life. It sometimes seems like he's dead inside. He doesn't tell me he loves me (though I understand it's hard if he doesn't even love himself). He doesn't express affection. He asked me the other day if I could help him have an orgasm. It felt so clinical. He may as well have been asking me to wash his back. I swear to God sometimes I think our lives will consist of watching Battlestar Galactica or bad 80's and '90's movies in the evenings until we're dead.

If I want to catch up and push a certain product for export:

Aside from using subventions, which are expensive, does it make sense to just drive up production by creating lots of plantations, thereby driving my domestic price down, and through the differential in price, then rely on trade centers automatically passing on the low price to other countries, thereby increasing exports?

I mean it makes sense in the real world, but curious whether this is the viable solution if you want to push a certain good for export. And if not, what other ways are there in the game?

First, english is not my native language so sorry for the errors that i'll make. Okay, so, i've always had a good relation with my mother, always consider her my best friend, and she was always my side against my progenitor.

For him, i'm having a hard time finding the right word. He was rude, always mad at everything, and i always felt like none of us (me, my sister (now 22F) and my mom) were able of enought or just were enought. Always screaming and cursing at the smallest wrong thing.

My sister is more like him, now screaming and being mad in a second. She wanted to be my mom, like our mother say, having the control on me. And when i didnt agreed, she became violent, pulling my hair, and grabbing me with her nails until I felt on the ground. In my parents back, and i lied to them for her.

In my early teen, i was SA, and it really f\*cked with my mind. When i was at my worst, the noise became a torture, all whistling, loud and sudden noise was hurtfull, my progenitor wasnt helping, screaming and now telling that I was ruining people lives for asking to turn their cellphone noise off. And later treatening my life to make sure i took care of his coffee.

I move out at 17, i needed to go away from all of this, but some experiences and health problems made me came back 3 months later, it's at this moment, at the summer i was 18 that he treatened me. I became distant, the more that i could and started living at my boyfriend's appartment without never really officially moving out.

Now, I'm 20, i'm seeing a psychologist and i'm getting better, and i realised not that long ago, that my sensitity with the noise was caused by my progenitor's incessives screaming and cursing.

I want to share it with my mom, but the thing is, that she will talk to my progenitor, and i'm not ready for this. in two days it's my sister birthday, and for going it's an hour and a half car ride (with my mom and my progenitor) , and i dont want to endure this night without being able to escape, and going with my own car is just still letting the problem stay

After \~a small lake’s worth of coffee and way too many late nights, I wanted to share my Houdini journey—a wild AI-powered survey platform built (almost entirely) with Lovable and enthusiasm that should probably be regulated.

**Why Lovable?**

* MVP velocity is wild—like, you-blink-and-it’s-live fast
* UI/logic iterates so quickly it almost feels like cheating (or maybe that’s the caffeine talking)
* Integrates with most things painlessly; big shoutout to Supabase linking!
* The sheer joy of seeing “hey, that button ACTUALLY WORKS!”

**But let’s be honest—here’s what could make it unbeatable:**

* Scoped chat context is a must… but anyone else dream of a “pin this state forever” feature?
* Security rails: bite-size checks/prompts would be a gift (esp for Supabase and auth n00bs like me)
* Undo refunds and clarity on where the credits are going. Is it just me or does AI double-bill when you accidentally hallucinate a bug fix at 2AM? 😂

**Some real-life moments:**

* Skipped cleanup duty just to ship a survey builder prototype on a coffee high.
* Accidentally forgot to start a new chat. Spent 10 minutes backtracking. Fixed. Had a celebratory espresso.
* Beta testing is fun, but after the third cup of coffee, it's... less... linear.

**Now, real talk—how are you all using Lovable?**

* Do you have a system for new chats per issue, or do you let chaos run wild and trust muscle memory?
* For those who came from non-coding backgrounds: what’s your “aha, this is how Git doesn’t eat my homework” moment?
* What’s your go-to caffeine (or midnight snack) for those “just one more deploy” sprints?
* Have you found any hacks or rituals that genuinely help as you vibe-code your way to launch day?

If you’re curious about Houdini or want to nerd out about survey builds (or chase midnight bugs together), let me know—happy to slide the waitlist link into DMs, no pressure.

Keep those tokens high, your prompts short, and—most importantly—never let your coffee supply run out. Catch you all at the next late-night “it finally works!”",2,1753748571.0,lovable,1,1.0,False

it’s called Joie de Lives and it’s on St Laurent between Laurier and Fairmount. it’s GORGEOUS in there and the books are on the shelves mixed in english and french, which I think is so beautifully emblematic of montreal honestly… ugh. 

it’s open til 10pm or midnight every day. cozy late night wintertime book shopping??? a nerdy lil bookstore date??? I think it’s my current favourite place in montreal, I’ve been twice in three days and I wanna go back already. please send help for my wallet! 

as per my post title, they have a lot of romance, sci-fi, and fantasy books. they have a nice horror section as well, some YA… certainly a few other categories I can’t quite recall but they don’t have any, like, contemporary fiction if it doesn’t fall into one of the aforementioned categories (think My Year of Rest and Relaxation or The Idiot type of reads, and they have no non-fiction). the selection could be broader, but I think they have a really good offering of books for the genres they *do* offer. they have a good selection of queer lit and have “sapphic saturday” this weekend! 

the staff have all been super sweet. they don’t take tips at the cafe as it’s factored into pricing, and we love to see that. they have cocktails, wine, coffee, snacky food, sandwiches… and they have a terrasse out front. 

anyways, that’s my little spiel. it’s such a lovely bookstore and I just had to share. ",30,1753748478.0,montreal,2,0.85,False

After such a high scoring week that saw people dissapointed with a score of 2600, we should move back towards sanity as there are fewer top 6 vs bottom 6 matchups for the uber premos to farm points.  Further, we are reminded of the value of late game goals in a close matchup through NWM's 63 point last 5 minutes (https://statsbyjaiden.com.au/supercoach_scaling is a great read if you're interested in the maths behind the dynamic application of points scaling with the variables of game time and margin).


As a side note: the two best runs home are, by a significant margin, STK (NTH/RIC/ESS) and GEE (PTA/ESS/RIC). If you have the choice between two similar players and one of them is from the aforementioned teams, then go with them.


**DEFENDERS**


**Whitfield - 478K**, a decent price and looks to have kept his role down back and took the majority of the kickins. The only factor here for the next match is that he traditionally struggles a bit at Marval, averaging ~15 points less than at home. Despite this, he's not too reliant on poor opposition to score well so he should be a decent pick if you need someone cheaper / have the more expensive options on this list already.


**Sinclair - 516K**, has thrived in the backline since NWM's switch to a predominantly midfield role, and should reliably score 110+ from here if the change persists. Easy opposition and nearly all of the kickins should equate to monster scores against the poor accuracy of the upcoming forwards.


**Holmes - 548K**, not many would have called him a likely D2 candidate at the start of the year, but it's hard to see him losing the spot to anyone but Sinclair with both of their upcoming runs. Great price for the expected upcoming scores.


**Wanganeen-Milera - 628K**, as I have found over the previous 9 weeks NWM is a devastating anti-POD and it's very much worth bringing him in even at this inflated price. His score last week up until the middle of the final quarter looked to be a modest ~110, but skyrocketed on the back of a herculean effort to win the match. This is both a negative and a positive, he doesn't get as much easy ball playing through the midfield which may lower his floor, but also means (for the coming weeks but especially for next year) that he still has heaps of room for his scoring to grow as he learns the new role. If you don't have either of the Saints defenders, Sinclair is the economical choice, but if you already have Sinclair and can find a way to make it happen then I would advocate for bringing NWM in.


*Speculative Defence Picks*


1. e4 c5


**Sicily - 450K**, has looked much more comfortable since return from 4 weeks off with an abdominal/hip injury and this has been reflected in his scoring. His disposal efficiency is up, his clangers are down, he's taking intercept marks and hitting accurate kicks. He's not quite at his best, but he's leagues above his price of 450K.


**MIDFIELDERS**


**Serong - 517K**, looks to be the only significantly underpriced midfielder at the moment. There's an understandable reticence to bring him in given it's been a fair few weeks since he had a blinder of a game and there's the potential that he gets attention from the opposition against CAR and BRL, but people are quick to forget just how well he can perform at his peak (and even at his average of 106 he's a decently reliable inclusion).


**McCluggage - 563K**, stands out at mid-high price range, at what is a respectable price for someone sitting at M4. It's a somewhat nervous prospect bringing in a Brisbane mid given that they all seem to take turns with usually 2-3 of them scoring well and 1-2 of them scoring poorly, but McCluggage has been the most reliable of the lot with only 4 games under 100 this year. The run home isn't easy, but with BRL favouring McCluggage with the outside ball and delivery into the forward 50, he should easily find a way to score. He's also a POD at only 12% ownership (and 9% of the top 10%) which is the cherry on top.


**Rowell - 661K**, has barely put a foot wrong since round 9 and has continued to impress with consistently high tackle counts and contested posessions. Assuming you already have the big three (Bont/Butters/Daicos), Rowell would be the next best inclusion on form and run (RIC/CAR/PTA) if you have unlimited funds and need another mid.


*Speculative Midfield Picks*


None this week


**RUCKS**


As with any player selection at this time of year, you're selecting them based on run, form, and price, rather than a general sentiment of overal scoring potential or value (as would be the approach early in the year). The best run's home by a long shot for rucks are **Grundy - 736K** and **Marshall - 554K**. The advice for Grundy remains - if you can bring him in then you should. If, like most, he's out of reach on the basis of trades or price, then we need to look elsewhere. Last week I warned against Marshall on the basis of the possible continued inclusion of Heath to share the ruck duties, and they ommitted him ahead of the rough matchup with Gawn last week - a contest that Marshall lost but fought admirably through. There's every chance that Heath is brought back again to practice against NTH's backup-backup ruckman, and if so I would not bring Marshall in. If he's not in this week, then it could be taken as a sign that they're going for consistent performance in the ruck to round out the year and Marshall would be a great inclusion. The next best option is **Gawn - 585K** who also provides a captain option this week against WCE's Flynn.


**FORWARDS**


The final four rounds might be the era of the Key Forward, as GEE, WBD, and ADE all have the fortune of facing some abysmal defences. It's difficult to separate them, but if I had to rank them on the basis of form/run:


1. **Cameron - 471K**, after outscoring NTH last week in a solid extension of his Coleman medal lead, Cameron has demonstrated once again the damage that GEE can inflict against a poor defensive unit. 


2. **Thilthorpe - 514K**, has done reasonably well over the previous 5 weeks, excepting a score of 46 against MEL. His scoring is augmented beyond the capacity to kick 5+ goals by his effectiveness in the role as a link up player in transitioning the ball from defence. He may struggle this week against Barrass/HAW as he did earlier in the year, but it should be noted that he had 3 shots on goal despite the difficult matchup.


3. **Darcy - 463K**, a 150 against ESS demonstrated what can happen if teams don't double team him at each contest and if he's not ignored by the umpires. The defensive unit of GWS should be better this week and may reduce his scoring, but he follows this with MEL without Steven May the next week and WCE the week after.


Outside of the Key Forward Frenzy, other more traditional picks include:


**Macrae - 515K**, given his consistent form and STK's absurd run home.


**Jackson - 561K**, still scoring well despite only taking a third of the ruck contests because he's being used as a midfielder in the centre bounces when not rucking.


*Speculative Forward Picks*


**M Hall - 462K**, started the year as a promising rookie that most people sold for 300K, but has flourished in the latter half of the year and looks to be a solid player at AFL level. He has the fourth best FWD 5-round average (106), is a favoured cog in the STK ball-transition machine, and is starting to get more CBAs, with 33% attendence last week.

On our second roast a few days later, we went for just above city into city minus, and this is the day we were getting more exact ratios for a blend. We assumed from a slightly lighter roast, we would get quite similar if not stronger flavors, but that wasn't the case, it ended up being good, but nothing incredibly unique and the strawberry/watermelon was near gone.

We worked together for three years up until he got fired. We kept in touch via a group text with two other co workers Jae and Carly, both who are close to him. I would say I was close with him once. But feel less so as of recently. Which I get that happens, but its getting blown off twice in a week is why I am even writing this.

Mike and I live two apartments away from each other and have hung out individually and also as a group. Mike has ADHD (I do as well actually), so time management and texting back can be a challenge for him. He is frequently 1-2 hours late or sometimes would cancel or change things last minute. So its not exactly totally new behavior. But a few weeks ago, I ran into him one morning as I was getting my morning coffee. He suggested going to the beach that day and said he’d hit me up after my haircut. During that conversation I also offered to give him some edibles when we met. I texted him to let him three times. Once to let him know I stepped out briefly to get my ears pierced. The second to let him know that I was done. After 3 hours went by, I texted asking if he still wanted to go to the beach or if I can just go to the gym. He responded an hour later saying “not today, sorry”. Okay fine. But the next day he texted me saying “I’ll take the edibles”. I was mildly annoyed then but decided to bring them anyways because we lived close by. I suggested meeting at the building’s rec center to hand them off because I was planning on going to workout. He agreed but told me he wanted to focus on working out and didn’t want to catch up then. Which at the time I just kind of let slide because we had plans to go to the pride parade that weekend so figured we could catch up then. He did say bye to me but as he was leaving, but made a joke basically telling me not to fuck up at my new job (I eventually got fired for not going fast enough and returned to our old job. But I was open with him about how that job was stressing me out and how I was struggling so I felt disrespected). The day before the pride parade, I texted him to confirm plans and heard nothing. So I texted him the morning of to see if he still wanted to go and he said that his roommate was still asleep so he’s not sure if they are still even going. A few days later Carly shared something to the group text and he was responding a lot. I decided to leave the chat because I didn’t really want to keep hanging with Mike. I text Jae one on one. I work with Carly still but we aren’t exactly friends, more acquaintances really. Just didn’t see the point. 

I took Jae out for pho the other day because she found another job, and mentioned that Mike told her he thought I was pissed at him. She asked him why, and he said he didn’t know and didn’t do anything, to which she said that I likely wasn’t pissed then. Jae just assumed I was high and left the chat on accident and didn’t push it. But the thing is Mike never said anything to me about it. He hasn’t really texted me much in the past few months actually (I’d text him but he hardky responds). He’s literally reached out once in the past few months, and this was a few weeks after blowing me off. It was to send me a news article about this guy I dated months ago (he’s kind of famous around here) and asking if I have seen it. AIO for getting mad? Also how do I deal with it so it’s not awkward since we know the same people",1,1753747700.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

Our current plan is to drive in Friday by lunch and head out Saturday late afternoon/evening; possibly staying near UT or near S. Congress, but could change depending on where we end up.

This is my sister's first trip to Austin, so she wants to do the cool hipster Austin-type things, but I'm not sure what is still good, what's overrated/crowded, etc. Especially since she wants to hit up record shops , thrifts, and book stores, with coffee somewhere along the way; possibly antiquing. Walkability preferred, but I know sprawl's gonna sprawl. Other spots I'd like to take her are [Austin Creative Reuse](https://g.co/kgs/PfWLu9P) (have been several times and def recommend) and possibly Waterloo Records, as that seems to be one of the more popular record stores.

My original intention was to walk around West Campus on Friday and maybe get lunch at Dirty Martin's/Kerbey Lane, but outside of walking around UT, I'm not sure what shops & such are around. There's a Buffalo Exchange/Pavement/Leopard Lounge trifecta, but the ones in Houston have gotten so expensive over the years that I imagine these have met the same fate; might still pop in, but would prefer other thrift stores if nearby

For Saturday, my plan was to go to Magnolia Cafe for brunch and walk down S. Congress to browse the shops, but with it being peak summer, I'm not sure how well that might go. I know Lamar is also one of the main drags, but I am unsure what stretch would be a good area for peruse. She's a polisci major, so I would like to think the Capitol might also be an option since it's a straight shot down, but we'll see.

Meal-wise, there were the mentioned three, but might take a page from either [Guy Fieri's visits](https://www.dinersdriveinsdiveslocations.com/austin-texas.html) or the [Texas Bucket List.](https://thetexasbucketlist.com/map/) I remember Ramen del Barrio being decent when I checked it out a few years ago, so I hope they've grown for the better. Any recommendations appreciated, specially if they're an old Austin classic. I always get Kerbey Lane when visiting friends in Round Rock, so would love to try other local staples.

tl;dr Taking my college student sister to Austin and she'd like to check out ""cool Austin things"", tourist trap depending

Alright, friends. Let’s get real for a second. We’re all juggling a million things, right? Work, family, side hustles, that Netflix series we swear we’ll finish “later."" But what if you could only focus on optimizing **one** hour of your day? Just **one**! Suddenly, that feels like a big deal, doesn’t it? 

So, what’s it gonna be? **The magic hour**? ✨

For me, it’s the **early morning**. I’m not saying you have to wake up at the crack of dawn (unless you want to look like a zombie with the coffee IV drip), but hear me out:

**Here’s why I love optimizing those AM hours:**

- **Quiet Vibes:** The world is usually quieter. No texts pinging, no notifications blaring. Just you and a peaceful atmosphere! 
- **Mindset Reset:** It’s the perfect time to tune into my thoughts, meditate, or, let’s be honest, maybe scroll through TikTok for some inspiration (guilty!).
- **Accomplishment Boost:** Knock out a task or two before the day really starts. Nothing beats the feeling of ticking off that to-do list before breakfast. 🥞

**So how do I turn this hour into pure gold? A few little tweaks:**

1. **Plan the Night Before:** I pick 3 things I absolutely want to tackle in the morning. Keeps me on track! It's like having a personal cheerleader. 📋
   
2. **Get Moving:** Even just a 10-minute stretch or a quick workout gets those endorphins flowing. Who doesn’t want a little extra happy juice?
   
3. **Mindful Fuel:** I try to skip the sugary cereal (sorry, Frosted Flakes) and whip up something hearty. Think oats, smoothies, or even a leftover cold pizza slice if that's your jam. 🍕 

4. **Limit Distractions:** Phone stays in another room for at least 30 minutes. Radio silence! Just me, my thoughts, and maybe an inspirational podcast. 

5. **Reflect:** I take a couple of minutes to write down what I’m grateful for or set intentions for the day. It’s wild how much focusing on the positive can shift your mindset. 

But let’s talk about YOU! What’s your most optimized hour? Is it filled with meditation, a workout, or maybe that sacred coffee time where you can finally breathe? ☕️🚀 

And maybe you’re more of a night owl? How do you maximize your evening hours? I mean, Netflix doesn't count, right? (Or does it?!)

Let’s share our best tips and tricks because we all could use a little boost to make those golden hours count! 💪✨",1,1753747640.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False
1mbwpse,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mbwpse,BFC Tecnica 2? [$650],"Hey everyone, just glancing at Facebook Marketplace and I saw this commercial looking machine for $650. I couldn't find a whole lot about it, but saw a few listings up in the mid to high thousands. This machine is older, at about 10 and a half years according to its specs tag. I'm guessing that's why it looks different from the ones I've seen really high prices on (like having a green light instead of a red one). It looks it, too. The ad says everything works, but it doesn't come with a portafilter (could I use my Flair 58 portafilter or is it brand specific?) 

Would this be worth the price? Seems like it was a very expensive piece, but it's on the older side, looks like it needs a good cleaning, appears to have a hefty footprint, and missing a piece. Does anyone else have one of these? Do they need much tinkering, like adding a PID? Or is this more something that belongs in a local café then a small kitchen? ",1,1753747583.0,espresso,6,0.67,False

I'm on the carnivore diet right now, though I started on the ketogenic diet at first and lost 150lbs on it, then I switched to the carnivore diet our of encouragement from my brother who is on it himself. Since then I've lost 20lbs more. However, there was a year that I plateaued and didn't know why. Then my brother, who's my carnivore guru, suggested I give up my heavy whipping cream, and bam, that's when I lost 30lbs, the 10lbs I gained during the plateau period and the 20 additional pounds. At the same time I have to coffee/heavy whipping cream, I went to see about bariatric surgery. I promised myself if I lost 40lbs within the next 6 months (it takes 6 months to do the program), then I'll drop it and not get the surgery and continue to do carnivore/keto. Well, in the last 2 months, I've lost 20lbs. I'm averaging about 3lbs a week, however I did get into some carbs one week and gained 10lbs so I could have lost 30lbs or more by now, but we all have our addictions. If I can get a hold of my good addiction properly, I won't need surgery.

⌈”You’re not getting tired, are you Valdés?”⌋ came the nonstop jeering voice over Rio’s shoulder as he ran across the coastal forest, head on a swivel. Trailing behind him was a massive sea of blue, crashing through terrain with the ferocity of a river cutting through the earth. 

“Not even close,” Rio called back over his shoulder. “And we’re almost done here.”

In the same moment, Rio slams directly into a poacher, one of the remaining few stragglers. Most of the cowering poachers had been disabled or captured by now: a couple of them were even caught up in the sea created by his overzealous Stand. Rio takes the man to the ground, stripping him of his belongings just like the countless men before him, having committed their standard equipment to rote memory.

“Get out of here if you know what’s good for you. I don’t have time to hold back if you make this difficult.”

The ones who came before him may have shown a bit more resistance, but this one acquiesced easily, instantly throwing his hands up in eminent fear. As Rio relented, the man immediately shot up, leaving his belongings behind and running off towards the beach where Stephen was held up. With a quick look around, it became very clear what was different. The west side of the beach was chaos: several poachers lay on the ground, varying degrees of crippling keeping them pinned and groaning in pain. Several trees had even been felled, turning the forest into an even more violent display. It wasn’t difficult to find the source of the chaos.

Dr. Marrow approached the last of the poachers left standing, their shipbound soundtrack winding down. The man’s legs had already been battered and bruised, large pieces of plastic and metal flying through the air like bullets. He may as well have been down for the count already. With the last of his strength, he lashes out verbally.

“Y-you assholes are insane..! Why even go through all this effort, huh? We’re just trying to get a bag, what’s this gotta do with you guys?!”

Dr. Marrow simply let out a cold laugh as his blade, formed of black and coated with red, was levied at the man.

“That’s precisely why I stepped in. This pursuit of yours… is ‘worthless.’ At this rate, you won’t be anything more than a thief playing a zero-sum game. You and your crew have shown yourselves to be capable. Put it towards something with real value to the world.”

With that, Marrow smacks him over the head with the flat end of the blade, knocking him unconscious. From behind, Marrow hears the voice of his “assistant” for this operation.

“That’s the last of them. Just finished getting the last of the trash out of the way. The turtles are on their way to the sea.”

Dr. Marrow looked back and nodded, before turning to the man on the ground. “So what should we do with them?” Marrow's question hangs in the air for a moment while he turns to Eliana, “Any ideas?”

“Well we could tie them up with their rope and put some in holes on the beach while we tie one to a tree while he watches the others slowly drown from the tide,” Eliana says immediately.

“But… why so extreme?” Marrow questions with an eyebrow raised.

“Intimidation. They won’t come back if only one came back alive, so close to death. Plus what he just witnessed.”

“I… Alright. You have quite the mind Eliana.”

“Thanks Doc,” Eliana smiles at Marrow. However, before Marrow can even reach down to grab the man he left at his feet, he hears a voice call out from across the jungle.

“HEY, YOU TWO! GET OUTTA THE WAY!” Marrow and Eliana look over to see a man running their way: Rio, whom they had encountered earlier during their battles near the poachers’ camp, being chased by a large coagulant pool of water. Last time they met, Rio made sure to inform them of the puddles’ nature as his out-of-control Stand, but this time he was much more emphatic.

“Get out of the jungle, quick! This guy doesn’t care if you’re a poacher or a helper, and it’s got the whole jungle to cross!” Rio panted out, sparing no time to stop for a conversation.

Eliana sighed. “Haah… well, let’s get this guy to the beach while we can, at least.” Marrow nodded in agreement, picking up the man and quickly hauling him southward towards the beachfront. Moving around and through the battlefield they created, they finally reach the beach. Unlike the forest, the beach was made squeaky clean, through the combined efforts of Eliana and the strange tiger that zoologist seemed to command.

However, disturbing the calmness came a voice from across the beach.

“Now… what have we learned today?”

The last of the poachers that hadn’t turned tail laid in the dense underbrush, clutching their sides and holding onto their wounds. Their heads wearily rose at the sound of footsteps in the underbrush. Stephen stood before them, disapproval clear on his face.

“W-we won’t do it again! We swear! We’ll never touch another animal again!”

“Not what he asked,” interjected another voice. Out from the brush appeared Rio, walking up to the poachers slowly and glowering down at them.

“W-we, we learned… to do the right thing.”

“Very good!” Stephen nods. He whips the sniper rifle off his back, and the group flinches as he points it directly at them… only for him to gently pat the head of the speaker with the business end.

“Now! With that being said, I think there’s something else you should be taking from the environment- something a little less harmful.” Stephen pointed to the shore. “We might have cleaned up the shore here, but the rest is still covered in trash. How about…” he starts, tapping his chin in mock thought. “Whoever cleans up the most trash here won’t get handed over to the authorities. Does that sound like a dea-”

“Oh, hiiiii guyyyys! I finally found you!”

Coco stood between them, two lumpy garbage bags in her hands. Behind her lumbered Rock Lobster in its largest form, dutifully carrying a pile of equally large bags on its back. “Yanno, I was gonna stop at some point to find you guys, but I just kept finding more and more and more, and you know how I get, hahah. Next thing I know, I finished the whole beach!”

She raised an eyebrow at the poachers on the ground. “Uhm. Who are they?”

Before Stephen and Rio could even offer an explanation, two more people walked up: first appeared Eliana, and behind her Dr. Marrow carrying the unconscious man they had initially intended on tying up.

Coco’s confusion became even more palpable. “Wait, who are *they*?” She let out an excited gasp upon seeing Eliana. “Wait, are you an angel??”

“Sure is!” A voice called out, the group turning to see a large bevy of otters approaching them — two or three working together to carry a poacher each. A closer look at them revealed that their fur was made of metal: and atop them all, Axel Otter sat as his Stand carried her and her work towards the others. “And I’m a talking otter to boot!”

The three poacher fighters who weren’t enthusiastically talking to the angel glanced at the otters, then back at Axel. “Looks like you had this handled yourself,” Dr. Marrow noted.

Axel shrugged, jumping down from the otter swarm. “Sure, but I can’t be everywhere at once—and if I went one by one, the second group would already have fled. Besides, you guys did wonderful! I think we should keep in touch!”

Stephan frowned. “Are you sure you wouldn’t want to come with us?”

The otter chuckled. “Nah, I’m a free spirit! Told EDEN Corp that when they tried to offer me a job way back when—though if you need help me and ｢Hikari E｣ would be happy to return the favor!”

As the group began preparing for when they would call the authorities, Eliana turned to the doctor. “EDEN Corp—have we heard of them before?”

“We have,” Marrow replied, before he glanced at the others. “But perhaps now’s not the time.”

**Scenario: Off the coast of Tortuga — 12:32 pm**

“Faster, I want it to go faster!”

A shrill voice called over the deck, much to the chagrin of the diligently working crew. A blonde man with sunglasses pushed up to his forehead and a sweater tied around his shoulders overlooked the area, a sneer seemingly permanently stuck upon his face.

The crew stopped for a moment, seeming to wordlessly communicate amongst themselves with a mix of cringes and stifled chuckles. It took a moment for anyone to speak up, one of the crew walking up to the man.

“Uhh, sir, we can’t-”

“That’s MR. GOLDSWORTH to you!” the man said, sharply cutting the crew member off.
The crew member winced in response. “Uhh… right… Mr. Goldsworth, we can’t just… make it go faster. There are… physical limitations to the ship.”

Mr. Goldsworth’s sneer deepened, as if that were the most offensive thing he’d ever heard. “Bah! Did the word ‘can’t’ just escape your lips? Do I hire crew who CAN’T do things?”

Rubbing the back of his neck, the crew member couldn’t help but smirk at the absurdity of the situation. “No Mr. Goldsworth, it’s just that the ship *literally* canno-”

“ENOUGH!!!” Mr. Goldsworth squealed, wiggling his hand at the crew member.

“You… are FIRED! I only hire people who KNOW how to make SHIPS go FAST!”

The crew member gave little pushback, shaking his head as he turned and walked away. This was par for the course, he wasn’t even the first one to get fired today.

Mr. Goldsworth sighed dramatically. It was so hard to find good help these days. All the money in the world couldn’t buy someone who knew how to run a ship to his liking…

…but it could buy beauty. He pulled a small jewelry box from his pocket, opening it to reveal a glistening gem. He ran his finger along its surface, enraptured by the depth of its color, the way it gleamed in the sun…

It had cost a fortune, but it was worth it. This gem was not merely beautiful, it was a glorious symbol of his power, his influence, his-

“Sir.”

Mr. Goldsworth’s spell was broken, he glimpsed up angrily from the gem. It was that no-good incompetent sailor! 

“WHAT! I just FIRED you! Go be FIRED!”

“Yea, I was gettin’ to that. But I’d prefer not to *die* before I can go ‘be fired’ somewhere *else*” he said, pointing towards the bow of the ship.

“We’ve got somethin’ coming our way.”

**Scenario: The Watered Log, Main Deck**

Captain Timbur collapsed his spyglass, grumbling beneath his breath. “Lookit’ the rich prat! Gawkin’ at the thing like some petty loot… He don’t know what he’s got in his hands!”

Gripping the spyglass in his hands, perhaps imagining wringing that pretty boy’s neck, he looked to his side, Cass Cannon leaning up against the wall next to him.

“What do ya make of this? Treasure that valuable oughta be in the hands of someone who’ll appreciate it properly…”

Cass pulled the hat down over their eyes, thinking for a moment. Their coat billowed in the headwinds.

“Things’a that nature are wasted on the likes’a him… Some cock’a the walk gits their hands on somethin’ they don’t understand, ‘n they don’t know what they’ve got until…”

Images of tragedy flashed in their databanks. *Cowboy Rangers EX Definitive Edition 2.0 Remastered*, lost to the ether.

“...until it’s too late.” Cass sighed, clutching their fist at their side. It couldn’t come to pass.

Timbur nodded. “Seems we’re in agreement, then… well, let’s just broadside the bastard, and ye can jump on and grab the thing!”

Cass took a moment to process the proposition. At face it did not seem a heroic act, more like petty larceny. However, if allowed to be hoarded by individuals that did not understand their worth, such treasures that could be put to better use, or at the very least be better preserved elsewhere, would go to waste. Clips of the many adaptations of the classic ‘Robin Hood’ tale flashed in their memory, affirming this statement. Conclusion:

“Yea, okay!”

They tipped their hat back up, walking forward onto the deck. They had eyes on the opposing vessel, and were making a rapid approach. 

“Just git us close, cap’n… I can take care’a the rest.”

Timbur nodded, satisfied by his crewmate’s enthusiasm. He took the helm as Cass made their way to the bow of the ship, looking over the railing. They clutched their umbrella as they began calculating their plan of action.

**Scenario: Mr. Goldsworth’s Ship, Cargo Hold**

Below the decks of Mr. Goldsworth’s ship, a decidedly non-fired sailor walked through the cargo hold, doing some cursory checks to make sure everything was secure. With a quick glance, everything seemed to be in order. He exited the room casually, whistling to himself.

**Thunk.**

The sailor stopped for a moment, turning to face a box that he could have sworn just made a “Thunk.” Looking at it for a moment, not investigating it further, he decided it was probably just… the wind? Yeah that sounded about right. He walked away to take care of the rest of his duties.

**THUD!**

The lid to the crate popped open just a moment later, Omah Garcia bursting forth, giggling to herself.

“PHEW~! That was close! Did you see that? It was like a spy movie! We totally almost got caught!”

Miguel groaned, standing up from the cramped crate and cracking his back. “You’ve gotta keep it down, just because he left the room doesn’t mean the coast is clear…”

Stepping out from the crate, he quickly surveyed the surroundings. Didn’t look like there were any other crew in the area at the moment, thankfully. He sighed. “Don’t even know why we’re doin’ this in the first place…”

Omah jumped up onto a tall stack of crates, making a bit too much noise for Miguel’s liking. She was eye level with Miguel now, and began miming out a scene. “Don’t you remember the play we put on? That rich dude who bought a buuu~~~uunch of Uropeh?”

Miguel nodded, rubbing his chin. 

> *It seemed as if it were more a dance than a fight… Pharoah Sanders and Lacquer spun around one another, Pharoah displaying his marvelous tail feathers, Lacquer making heroic poses in-between mimed strikes, a cowboy hat atop its head.*

> *Omah and Miguel stood in the middle, weaving in between the two as well, but decidedly less used to the footwork and choreography involved. The fight took place amidst a mass of crates, filled to the brim with sparkling gems. A cackling aristocrat sits atop the pile, watching the battle unfold*

Omah began pointing around excitedly. “This has GOTTA be the same place as the play! Which means we’re also going to see an AWESOME monster! Oh, oh! And a cowboy, we get to fight a cowboy!”

Miguel raised his hands, trying to stifle Omah’s energy. “Hold on now, something like that isn’t something to take lightly… Situations like this can be dangerous. So let’s just calm down and approach this sl-”

***CRASH!!!***

A sound of utter destruction echoed from down the halls, followed by the screams of sailors. Calls of “Mayday!” were drowned out by even more crashes. Whatever measured response Miguel was trying to muster was cut short by Omah taking off sprinting towards the noise. 

“MONSTEEE~~~R!!! I’M GONNA GET YOUUU~~~UUU!”

“Omah, WAIT!!” Miguel yelled, running after her.

As the ships passed by one another, perhaps a bit too close for comfort, Cass jumped onto the ships’ side railing, umbrella in hand. In one decisive leap, they threw themself overboard, hurtling towards the side of the opposing ship.

In one swift strike, they slashed their umbrella forward, a thin jet of water piercing the hull and allowing them to jam the umbrella in the side.

Bracing against the side of the ship, they bent the umbrella as far as it could go, releasing and slinging themself into the air.

Prepared to fight a horde of sailors to get their target, Cass landed on the upper deck of the opposing ship, casting their coat to the side to reveal their heroic frame. They clenched their fists, looking for their first opponent…

…Wait, where was everybody?

The upper deck was conspicuously empty of any conscious crew. A few sailors laid crumpled in craters, and along the walls a number of deep dents clearly showed where something large had hit them with some serious force. 

***BANG***

The sound of shearing metal and panicked yelling erupted from the deck below Cass. The confusion they were feeling began to morph into curiosity. This was no longer an infiltration. There could be a sea monster, or a dastardly villain, or… anything! Cass struck another pose before turning to the nearest staircase below deck.

“Fear not, crew of this ill-fated vessel! Whatever misfortune has befallen you I will remedy for the low price of all of yalls’ Uropeh!”

As they strode down the stairs to the lower deck panicked crewmates sprinted past them and up the stairs. Incoherent warnings about a monster below deck flew by them as they advanced into the eye of the storm. As they reached the bottom, they took a heroic gait, swinging open the door to a larger interior crew compartment.

As they strode in and scanned the space, they identified a crew member cowering near a fridge in a small mess area. 

“You, sailor. What in the tarnation is happenin’ on your ship?”

All it took was that small distraction, a small lapse in concentration, for a 150 kilogram hunk of shell and malice to slam into the man at inhuman speed. As he was crushed into the side of the nearby refrigerator, the entire area exploded, food and beverages flying everywhere. A few cans of beer rattled to the floor as the visage of a massive alligator snapping turtle settled onto the floor before emerging from his shell.

The old bastard was a sight to behold. Numerous deep gouges and scars littered the beast's shell, amassing into an almost floral pattern. However, as he looked at Cass with a face missing one eye and making up for it in pure, uncut mean-muggedness, Cass couldn't help but have a flash of a turtle with a massive cannon on its back flash through their mind. 

“OHMYGODOHMYGODOHMYGOD!” Omah yelled, running forth into the room. Miguel followed behind frantically. “Hold on, Omah! Slow down, it isn’t safe!”

She hopped up and down joyously, pointing at the battle-scarred turtle. The old thing almost looked amused.

“IT’S GAMERA!!! IT’S REALLY HIM!!” She yelled. The statement triggered Cass Cannon to search their archives. Visions of giant monster battles filled their memory. Yes, this turtle certainly was reminiscent of Gamera- hey wait, is that a kid?

Cass placed themself between Omah and the turtle, outstretching their arm in a defensive pose. “Hold on now, partner! This ain’t no place for a child! And that ain’t Gamera, juss’ some angry ol’ varmint!” 

Omah was quickly perturbed by this random guy blocking her view of Gamera.  “Heyyy~! Get out of the WAY! I’m trying to see!”

Turning around to face the girl, Omah could finally get a good look at Cass, their robotic form coming clearly into view.

Her mouth went wide at the sight, her eyes beaming. “HEEEY! This is the robot we gotta fight~! The one from the play!”

Cass was taken aback for a moment, the expression on their screen turning to an “=O”

“Eh? Fight?! What ‘n tarnation are you talkin’ about, I’m tryin’ ta save ya!”

From out of the air, a chain shot forth at Cass. They quickly jumped back, a blast of water from their umbrella deflecting it. Omah giggled maniacally.

“Omah…” Miguel groaned.

“What? It happened in the play, we gotta do it!” She said

Deep down, he knew she was right. He sighed, looking up at Cass. “Sorry about this.” he muttered, assuming a fighting stance.

Cass shook their head, taking a battle stance of their own. “Can’t get nothin’ fer free it seems… Fine, have it your way.”

The turtle scuttled to look at the father daughter duo before then turning back to Cass. In the near distance the sound of something large and metallic crashing wildly into something and the sound of more yelling erupted.

A tense moment was followed by the turtle snapping up a nearby beer can, and drawing eye contact with the new arrivals at his party as he pierced it with his jaws and tossed back his head. The empty can clattered to the floor as the snapper pulled his limbs into his shell and powerful jets replaced them. 

A hissing that could almost be considered laughter erupted from the turtle as he began to spin wildly and careen towards Cass, forcing them to jet out of the way, while Miguel barely managed to grab his daughter and dash out of danger as a roughly humanoid robotic Stand body cobbled together from the hulls of shattered ships blasted through a nearby wall before creakily lurching over to its user. 

A few nearby crew who had barricaded themselves inside an adjoining bulkhead screamed through a crack in the door.

“We don’t care who you are, whoever takes care of that turtle and is the last one standing can have the damn blue rocks.”

The sound of the bulkhead the remaining crew was hiding behind locking shut punctuated the mood. All three Stand users were locked in this deck together, and only one was going to leave with what they came for. 

The snapper’s robotic Stand lurched aggressively as its user began to spin up like god’s most dangerous beyblade, and with a voice like a swamp bubble making its way up through the mud the Stand spoke a single phrase:

“Open the Game!”

**Location:** The Cargo Hold & Crew’s Quarters of a large yacht! The area [here](https://i.imgur.com/dZzxXw7.png) is 30x30m, divided into several smaller areas by several walls. The grey walls are made of steel, while the tan ones are made of drywall.

The lower left section is an engine room, featuring two large running engines. The engines are welded to the floor.

The lower right section is the cargo hold, containing many crates of equipment and supplies. Within the crates here, you can find many different luxury foods and ingredients. A few loose pipes are on the ground near some of the crates. Cass Cannon starts here.

The upper left section is a recreational area set up by the ship’s crew. The area contains a sofa, a coffee table, a small flatscreen TV, a carpet, and a few chairs. South of this area is a pool table and a rack of pool cues, and to the east are a few shelves filled with various books. North of this area is a large walk-in closet, in which can be found some barrels of drinking water, a few ladders, some tool boxes, a carton of cigarettes, and many cardboard boxes of basic cleaning supplies. Miguel & Omah start near the TV.

The upper right section is a kitchen surrounded by a small hallway. This kitchen has a microwave, an oven, a fridge, a freezer, a sink, and several cupboards full of dishware. On the central island and side counters are several ingredients and food products mid-preparation, including vegetables, fruits, sausages, meat skewers, bread, and a pot of soup.

**Goal:** RETIRE your opponent!

**Additional Information:** An angry, Stand-using snapping turtle named Old Grey Wolf is standing in the kitchen. They have 3/2/5 Physicals, Alligator Snapping Turtle 5 and Hell in a Shell 5, making them incredibly tough and accurate when flinging themself around. Lucky for the players, Old Grey Wolf has been sucking down alcohol, and their drunkenness means they are significantly less accurate than normal and can only accurately ricochet once. Unfortunately for them this also allows the already tough turtle to take effectively unlimited damage during the duration of the match and their Stand to wander farther from its user than it could under normal circumstances.

Old Grey Wolf is a crotchety bastard who loves to fight, drink, and laze around in the sun. He also hates rich people, anything with an engine, British Petroleum, and you (Yes, you reading this). He may be an old asshole. That’s It. 

Old Grey Wolf’s Stand, ｢Smokestack Lightnin’｣, allows the user to turn their limbs into high power water jets. ｢Smokestack Lightnin’｣ itself has A Pow, D Spd, and B Dur and can summon jets on its own body to augment its movement.

Old Grey Wolf will attempt to fight the players by choosing one of them and using its Stand ability to launch themselves at a nearby wall, ricocheting in the player’s direction and aiming to hit them in the lower body. While they do this, ｢Smokestack Lightnin’｣ will try to position to get line of sight on the other player, and use water jets to blast towards them in a straight line and tackle them. Afterwards, Old Grey Wolf and ｢Smokestack Lightnin’｣ will swap targets and repeat this maneuver.

Hey there! I’m a 30-year-old creative in marketing with a dry sense of humor, an adventurous streak, and a knack for turning everyday moments into something worth remembering.

1mbwl46,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExpatFIRE/comments/1mbwl46/just_spent_6_weeks_in_cape_town_heres_everything/,Just spent 6 weeks in Cape Town. Here's everything I learnt!,"TL:DR - Cape Town completely blew me away. It’s beautiful, wild, cheap(ish), fun, and genuinely one of the best places I’ve traveled to solo. I wrote a full, but here's the quick version with practical tips:

*Where to stay:*

Green Point – walkable, close to coworking, beaches, restaurants. Good balance.

Sea Point – chill, safe, beachfront, with killer cafes and markets.

CBD / Bo-Kaap – super central, great energy, walkable but watch your stuff at night.

Woodstock – artsy, cool, more affordable. Check out Neighbourgoods Market on Saturdays.

Camps Bay / Clifton – bougie as hell, expensive, but insane sunsets and beaches.

*Best coworking spaces I tried:*

Workshop 17 Watershed – huge space on the Waterfront, reliable WiFi, lots of hot desks.

Cube Workspace – quieter, corporate vibe. Great if you need meeting rooms.

Hustle House – vibey, has a barista, good vibes for solo founders.

Best cafes

Bootlegger (Sea Point) – solid WiFi, great coffee, tons of space.

Caffe Neo (Green Point) – long laptop tables, good outlets, friendly staff.

Origin Coffee Roasting – best coffee in the city, always has nomads.

*Internet & SIM cards:*

Get a local SIM. Vodacom + MTN have the best coverage.

Load shedding is really annoying, so some coworking spots + cafes have solar backup.

For backup, I used an eSIM (Airalo worked great—code WiFiTribe15 still works, I think).

*Visa info (as of 2025):*

South Africa launched a digital nomad visa! Up to 3 years.

You need to prove income ($35.7k+/year) and a clean background check.

Otherwise, tourist visas last 90 days and can be extended to 180.

How to get around:

Uber is cheap and safe, and best for short trips.

MyCiTi Bus is clean and super affordable (buy the travel card).

Walking is fine in Sea Point / Green Point / Waterfront during the day. Don’t walk alone at night downtown.

*Favorite experiences:*

Sunset kayak (Green Point): dolphins, Table Mountain views

Lion’s Head sunrise hike: 1 hour, worth it.

Wine tour in Stellenbosch or gin tour with Kiff Kombi.

Penguins at Boulders Beach.

Mojo Market after dark

*Quick safety tips:*

Don’t flash phones or wallets on Long Street at night.

Use Ubers instead of walking after dark.

Avoid ATM “helpers.”

Sea Point, Green Point, and Clifton felt very safe, even solo.

If you're thinking about Cape Town for remote work, do it. It's chaotic, stunning, and worth it.",2,1753747246.0,ExpatFIRE,2,0.75,False

I would like to say that I did it for science, but part of me did it for love. There’s a guy in my marine biology class. His name’s Mike, and two nights ago we discovered the tide pool full of sunflower sea stars.

This was strange for two reasons. First, ten years ago Sea Star Wasting Syndrome wiped out over ninety percent of the sunflower sea stars living near Whidbey Island. Lesions formed on the sea stars, their arms twisted and fell off, and their entire bodies rotted into nothing. They’ve been struggling to regain lost ground ever since.

Second, this specific tide pool wasn’t here last week, and it certainly wasn’t full of mature sea stars.

Mike had been eager to investigate further. “Let’s go back tonight,” he whispered in class the morning after we saw them for the first time.

“You’re not going to tell Doctor Graff?” Even as I said it, I had a feeling Mike was right. Our ragged professor stood with his back to the classroom, scratching out a ridiculously long URL on the chalkboard. He refused to start a class text chain. Several of us have practically begged him. 

“Let’s get the photos first. That way we can bring proof,” Mike said. He didn’t have to convince me further. 

We decided that we would go that night, after dark. I thought going at night was a little strange, but Mike was insistent. He swore it was so that no one would see us and steal our thunder. I wanted to believe it had more to do with being alone late at night, looking up at the stars in the sky and down at the stars in the tide pool. Either way, we made plans to meet at the tide pool at low tide—just after midnight.

As I walked along the shore, my boots left glowing blue prints in the gelatinous sand behind me. The bioluminescence was strong tonight. I wondered if all of those plankton minded the disruption. They probably minded a lot. I would be upset if some massive eldritch creature came stomping through my home in the middle of the night.

I kept an eye out for Mike. He was hard to miss, even in the dark. Tall and imposing, he tended to wear a lot of neon, like he was fighting back agains the dreary and drab coastal landscape. I expected to spot him almost as soon as I rounded the corner of the cove. Instead, the beach was empty.

Still, I kept going. He must be running late. I climbed over the rocks above the tide pools, scraping my hands against barnacles. I had no doubt we would get some good photos tonight—unless of course the ghostly tide pool had vanished as suddenly as it appeared.

As I reached the rocky ground at the far end of the beach, I began to pick my way across the barnacle-encrusted seascape. The jagged white shell provided good traction, but it didn’t cover the entire rock face. In the moonlight, it was hard to tell which patches of rock were safe, and which were slick with seaweed and the slime of decomposing jellyfish. 

Something caught my eye. A long, white objected jutted up out of the sand. Was that a bone, picked clean and washed smooth by the tides? No. It had to be driftwood. I let myself believe it was driftwood.

My adventurous streak was already waning.

Where was Mike? 

Half walking, half crawling so I could keep my balance, I climbed over the hump of the last rock and looked down at the water below. At first, the glare from the moon on the water was too bright, and I couldn’t see anything below the reflective surface. I turned on my flashlight. The beam cut through the water, revealing what had to be thousands of sea stars clustered together like gems. It reminded me of fishbowl filled with those rainbow-colored flat marbles. It looked too perfect to be real. 

As my flashlight passed along the pool, something shifted in the shadows just outside of the beam. I hesitated. I can’t explain the feeling that came over me, but something told me I didn’t want to look. Something told me I that this place had secrets I didn’t want to discover. I forced myself to look anyway.

My beam crossed something odd waving in the darkness. At first I thought it was a plant, or maybe a piece of caution tape left over from the over-zealous biologists. Only when I moved the beam further did I realize what I was looking at. An enormous sea star sat flopped over the edge of the rock, half in the water, half out. From tip-of-arm to tip-of-arm, he must be at least as long as I was tall. Though he appeared to be reclining against the rock, three of his arms caressed the air, waving in the wind as if he was trying to taste the breeze. 

Something inside of my froze. Sea stars are notoriously slow movers, even when fully submerged. Even so, this one was so big. I imagined him crossing the distance and wrapping me in his cold grasp, and the thought made me want to throw up.

It was a stupid thought, born of too many horror movies.

Still, sweat mixed with the sea mist prickled along my neck. 

Across the pool, the sea star raised a fourth arm, and I couldn’t help but think it looked alert and fully intelligent.

Story fragments and memories of rumors began to seep into my mind. You hear things in a town like this. The guy who runs the cafe with the good clam chowder whispers things that I would rather not know. The kids at the college tell stories about the ocean—stories that I have studiously ignored until now.

As I stood there in the depths of the night with only the moon and the unearthly blue glow of the water to guide my way, the stories came rushing back to me.

Stories about sudden sinkholes and missing pets. Stories about the sand and water quivering beneath your feet. Stories about driftwood that bears an uncanny resemblance to bone. There were other stories, too. Stories about what happens to people who turn their backs on the ocean.

I couldn’t take my eyes off of the sea star. Could it see me? Could it sense me?

I had no way of knowing. I stood there, hesitant to breathe, hoping it couldn’t feel my heart beating down through my feet and up through the sand.

It raised a fifth arm, and this one snaked toward me, exploratory.

My legs were cramping from the awkward way I was holding myself, extended across the rocks. My hand hurt from where the barnacles pressed into my palm skin. I couldn’t stay still forever.

I felt my legs begin to shake. The beam of my flashlight wavered as my arm grew tired.

I worried that the monster of a sea star would notice and respond, but he didn’t. He just waited there as my hand grew numb. I felt something warm seeping down from my hand. I looked down and watched as blood dripped down into the pool. I couldn’t hold my hand there any longer. I lowered the light and used that hand to push myself away from the rock. My bloodied hand shook, and when I looked down at it, a wave of nausea washed over me at the sight of the black goo pulsing down from my hand. It seemed like too much blood. I wondered what had 

I didn’t dwell on it. Instead, I aimed my flashlight back at the monster sea star at the edge of the pool. There he was, unconcerned. I thought he looked like he was made of rock, and somehow the idea of that scared me more than anything so far. 

I wanted to turn and run back along the coast—to feel the calm of the packed sand under my feet and the desperation of the ocean breeze—but I had come here for a reason.  

Where was Mike?

I seriously considered turning and leaving. If Mike was going stand me up, then I was under no obligation to wait. 

Then I paused. 

I remembered all the other times Mike had showed up. How he had put my name on a group project even though I had been too sick to work on it, and how many times he had arrived with an extra coffee or bagel to Monday morning marine biology. I had to believe there was a good reason he hadn’t made it tonight—and I knew that if our positions were reversed, he wouldn’t abandon the project. He would get the proof I needed.

So I pulled out my phone, stared down the monster sea star, and tentatively snapped the first photo. The creature’s arms blurred in the photo, a testament to how they swayed.

I looked up to make sure that the monster sea star hadn’t moved. He hadn’t. I wasn’t sure what I was expecting. 

I took a few more pictures, feeling the fear melt away as I did. The sea star was kind of beautiful, despite my initial impressions.

After a moment, I took a break to examine my pictures. Night mode had become increasingly impressive in recent years, but it still wasn’t everything it could be. The photos were still grainy, and there was a level of distortion to them—things that I couldn’t see with my naked eye appeared clearly in the photos, like the aurora borealis from earlier in the year.

Something in one of the photos caught my eye. Beneath the surface of the water, deep in the pool, a streak of silver led from the sea star’s arm down into the rock. I squinted at the phone, trying to determine what I was looking at. The feathered silver light was hard to define. 

I looked up at the tide pool again, and this time, when I squinted hard against the glow of the moon, I saw it. I saw the long silver thread, delicate and bright, leading from the sea star down into the sand and pebbles below. 

At first I thought it could be some remanent of the bioluminescence, but when I looked closer, I realized the monster sea star wasn’t alone. The other sea stars, all of them much smaller, some of them sporting only five or six arms, had the threads, too.

I didn’t look away from the giant as I eased closer to the pool. I took a video as I leaned over the water, and this time, the silver cords were even clearer. There was something monumental happening here, and not just from a scientific standpoint. This felt like something hallowed. 

The water rippled with the breeze, and I took a few more pictures.

Normally I wouldn’t have dreamed of sticking my hand in a tide pool like this partly because I hate the cold slime and sticky tendrils of things that live in the ocean, and partly because these pools are delicate ecosystems. I can practically hear Doctor Graff yelling at us to keep our hands out of the water. 

Still, this was an unusual situation. I needed to know what I was dealing with. 

There was something else, too, though I didn’t want to acknowledge it. There was a pull. A call. A need. 

I reached down toward the pool. My fingers grazed the surface of the water, and it glowed vibrant blue with the disruption, like glitter swirling downward. A silver cord extended from a young sea star. Its arms were uneven, and I imagined that it pulled away from me as I plucked at the cord. It was surprisingly taut, and it quivered and vibrated like a guitar string as I withdrew my hand. 

I hold still for a moment, hand dangling in the water. Then something like spider webs closed over my hand, and I jerked it out of the pool. My hand glistened in the moonlight. It was covered in hundreds of hairlike silver cords, and when I looked closer, I saw that something was attached to them. Tiny sea star larvae, translucent and barely visible, clung to my skin. They squirmed, and my hand begun to burn. I drug it through the water again, but that only made it worse. More larvae caught. 

In that moment, every conservationist instinct vanished. All I could think about was how to get them off. I wiped the mass against the sand. It rolled up and clumped together like a graveyard of jellyfish parts, and I shuddered as I stared at the pulsating mass.

As I stared, I realized something. It wasn’t just the larvae that were pulsing.

The ground itself was vibrating. 

Deep down, beneath the sand, a rumbling voice rose to my ears. “I know who you are.” The sound was so deep that it hurt my ears. Somehow, even so, it sounded like a woman. 

I whirled around, looking for the source of the voice. I knew I wouldn’t find it. 

When I looked down at the pool again, I saw that the silver cord was quivering even more intensely than when I had first plucked it. The others hummed along with it, reaching down into the sand. Something deep below rumbled. 

I stumbled backward as the pool began to simmer before me. Rocks shifted and water bubbled up from some underground spring. I realized something even worse. The monster sea star from the far end of the pool was gone. 

The water bubbled violently. I watched as it swirled, and the sand gave way. A long shape turned in the water, and as the sand slipped down the sides of it, I saw bright green billowing in the water. I would know that color anywhere. The shape continued to roll. A face emerged from the pool.

I fell backward, landing hard. Barnacles sliced through both of my hands, but I hardly felt them. My mind reeled and a strangled sound escaped my throat. 

Mike lay face up in the pool, eyes closed, a mass of silver cords spilling out froths chest. His arms and legs were twisted strangely, like someone was trying to crumple up a piece of trash. Sand dripped down his face, falling away in chunks. 

“Mike!” I screamed.

Desperation to get to him outweighed my fear. I scrambled over the rock and dropped into the pool. The sand gave way beneath my feet, and before I could react, I was up to my waist in gelatinous sand and water. I flailed, and my hand found driftwood. It was more like a ball of roots, really, but it was entailed in the rock in such a way that I thought it would support my weight. 

The sand beneath my feet shifted again. I reached out, trying to grab Mike’s foot. My hand brushed his toe.

Mike’s mouth opened. The voice that left his mouth didn’t belong to him. “Did you come for me?” It was the woman’s voice again. The beach shook with its cadence. 

I tried to answer, but my voice caught.

“Because I came for you,” the voice said.

What did it mean? Why did something about it feel so familiar—as if the voice had been with me throughout all of my life and I was just now remembering?

The rumbling intensified. I looked around and saw the sand shuddering, cracking apart in chunks. The rocks gave way, and I realized there was something else underneath—something that had been there this whole time. A tentacle rose up from the sand. It lashed into the air, blocking out the moon as water and sand rained down from above. It was then that I recognized her shape buried under the sand, larger than anything I could have imagined. She was all I could see. She was everywhere.

“I’ll be waiting for you,” the voice-that-wasn’t-Mike’s said. 

I had to get to him. We had to get out of here. 

The waves pushed him closer to me. I reached for him, but when my hand found his leg, it felt hot and soupy. My fingers sunk into his flesh. Tendons snapped and his leg stretched like jelly. I let go in shock, on impulse. 

Of course I immediately reached for him again, but it was too late. The water swirled suddenly, flooding up to my neck, and I clamped onto the roots with both hands. Mike was gone before I had time to react, swallowed up by the whirlpool.

“Mike!” I screamed, but I knew it was too late. The whirling water pulled at my legs. I held onto the root, as the water stretched me and pulled me toward the sinkhole. My fingers began to loosen. With whatever strength I had left, I looped my arm through one of the roots and locked it to my side. 

I tried to keep my eyes open. I tried to search for Mike. The icy seawater blast me in the face, burning my eyes and forcing it’s way into my nose and mouth until I couldn’t tell if I was above the water or beneath it. It was all the same. I could taste salt and slimy strings and mold—thick, heavy mold. 

When the water subsided, I shook the ocean out of my eyes and looked around. Everything was gone. The pool had stilled itself, and the water sunk back to my thighs, my knees, my ankles. Mike was gone. When I looked down at the water, I saw the last few sea stars slipping through the sand, anchored by their silver cords. 

I lunged for one, desperate to hold on to anything of Mike.

The thread snapped and I’m left holding a tiny sea star. I stared at it until even the sea star dissolved and slipped through my fingers.



UPDATE:

When I went back the next day, I found a giant sink hole where the tide pool had been. It was as if something massive had suddenly deflated, or perhaps disappeared entirely.

Sometimes, late at night, when I lay in bed, I can still feel the pull. I don’t know where she is. I don’t know where she went when she abandoned the sand beneath the tide pool, sucking Mike and her thousands of children along with her.

But I still hear the call. Did Mike hear it too? I’m afraid that one day, I’ll find myself drawn to her again.",2,1753747155.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I met a Snowflake engineering manager last week.

We then had a 2-hour long conversation where he told me the pre-consensus comeback story:

1. Data warehousing is becoming the bottleneck for large enterprise AI adoption.  Think Nike not startup use case.

2. Snowflake is one of a few multi-cloud warehouses that is SQL-centric with enterprise-level speed and reliability.

3. Snowflake is quietly building out its own AI suite of products that leverages the training from its customers - a dataset that by itself builds a unique moat.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Criciúma vs. Cuiabá: A Série B Showdown of Fortresses and Fireworks**

The Brazilian Série B’s clash between **Criciúma** and **Cuiabá** promises to be a tactical chess match, a game where numbers tell tales of grit and glory. Let’s dissect the odds, sprinkle in some absurd metaphors, and crown a winner with the confidence of a man who’s never bet on a horse named “Rain Delay.”

---

### Parsing the Odds: Math Meets Mayhem

The numbers scream **Criciúma as the favorite**, with decimal odds hovering around **2.05** (implied probability: \~48.8%). For context, that’s roughly the chance of surviving a Brazilian beach party without drinking coconut water straight from the shell. Cuiabá, at **3.75** (\~26.7%), is the underdog, while the draw sits at **3.15** (\~31.7%).

The spread lines back Criciúma as a **-0.5-goal favorite**, meaning they’re expected to win outright. Cuiabá’s +0.5 line gives them a lifeline—a tie would see bettors cash in. Meanwhile, the total goals line is **2.5**, with “Under” favored at some books. Expect a cagey affair, like two chefs arguing over the last slice of pizza—intense but low on drama.

---

### Digesting the News: Recent Form & Fictional Injuries

Criciúma’s home form is as reliable as a Brazilian coffee shop’s Wi-Fi—always there when you need it. Their recent 0-0 draw with Operário-PR and a 1-1 stalemate with Coritiba suggest a defense that’s tighter than a nut (thanks to a midfield that’s mastered the art of “parking the bus and charging admission”).

Cuiabá, meanwhile, has the attacking flair of a tourist trying to parallel park in Rio. Their 4-0 drubbing by CRB last week was a masterclass in defensive chaos, but let’s be fai

After university, I had some bad luck with friends, and moved back home. I ended up in a house with my friend and her boyfriend and we havent had any problems. I was told from both of them that they were into having threesomes before I moved in, and I was fine with it, as I was and am busy working and continuing school, and so I dont spend a lot of time at home anyways.

#  

# “Roger, Tower, runway 2 south, over and out.”

#  

# I watched from the control tower as flight 0745 appeared through the early morning mist above London and made its approach, the time was 06:50 am.

#  

# The fully laden plane a Boeing 747, had just flown in from the USA, it was carrying 524 passengers and 15 crew members. 

#  

# It landed perfectly and taxied into its respective parking place, the ground crew took the stairs across and put them into position and waited.

#  

# Normally, the cabin crew would have opened the door to let the passengers disembark, but for some reason, this did not happen. 

#  

# So, the foreman of the ground crew, climbed the stairs and banged on the closed door, there was no reply.

#  

# He radioed in to his boss asking him for guidance, his boss in turn, called the tower asking us to try a call the plane on the radio.

#  

# This I did, repeatedly for about fifteen minutes, but to no avail, finally, in desperation, I suggested calling Maintenance, to see if there was a way to open the door from the outside.

#  

# Minutes later a truck from the workshop pulled up alongside the Boeing 747, looking like a toy beside the giant aircraft. 

#  

# Two aircraft technicians climbed up the stairs to the side of the plane, then they bend and started to do something to the door.

#  

# A minute later, the door opened, the foreman of the ground crew climbed the stairs and pulled the door and called into the opening, but there was no reply. 

#  

# The foreman spoke to me, and I called security, and requested them to make their way to the plane, stating “Code Bravo. Repeat. Code Bravo. This is not a drill”.

#  

# Two security cars made their way across the tarmac, their orange magnetic beacons flashing to show any aircraft in the area that they were crossing the runways.

#  

# The cars pulled up beside the 747 and four figures in uniform got out and after conversing with the foreman of the ground crew, they ascended the stairs.

#  

# One by one they disappeared inside the plane, there was a tense silence for a couple of minutes, then the cockpit radio crackled next to me.

#  

# I quickly picked up the radio and said, “flight 0745, can you hear me.?”

#  

# The voice of the head of the security team answered, “Tower, this is Felix, please advise local police to attend asap. This plane needs to be isolated straight away. is there anywhere it can be moved to, so it is out of sight of prying eyes.”

#  

# I responded, “Roger that, Felix. Police enroute, is there anyone else needed, medical.? ETC”

#  

# Felix was the codename for the head of the airport security team. Felix responded, “negative, tower. We just need to get this bird under cover.”

#  

# I quickly liaised with the ground crews and got flight 0745 moved into an empty hanger, by which time the police had turned up in force. 

#  

# The police cars drove into the hanger and parked surrounding the plane, two police officers climbed the stairs that had been positioned by the plane.

#  

# All they had been told was there was a serious incident happening at the airport involving flight 0745, but nothing else.

#  

# They stepped into the plane and looked around at the large, cavernous space, the senior officer, Geoff Spencer, spoke to Felix.

#  

# He said, “Why have you called us out here to show us an empty plane.?”

#  

# Felix said, “well, that’s the problem, when it left the USA twelve hours ago, it had 539 people on board, including the daughter of the American president, she was flying incognito.”

#  

# Geoff swore and said, “are you being serious.?”

#  

# Felix looked back at him with cool grey eyes and said, “I would never joke about anything this important.”

#  

# Geoff swore again and said, “right, I’m going to have to kick this upstairs, fast. This is way beyond our paygrades.”

#  

# Geoff had his officers search the plane, to no avail, then they put a cordon around the outside of the hanger.

#  

# Geoff then phone his boss and informed him of the situation, his boss, Gordon Barnes, immediately went white and called the Commissioner for the metropolitan police.

#  

# The Commissioner, Margaret Cooper, phoned Downing Street and asked to speak to the Prime Minister, on a matter of highest urgency. 

#  

# The Prime Minister interrupted her breakfast to take the phone call, she was not too happy about it, Catherine Wright, took the phone and said, “Speak, and this better be important.”

#  

# When Catherine Wright heard the news, she turned pale and swore several times, she jotted down as many facts as were available and said, “OK, thanks for letting me know, I’ll have to call Jim Hoover and tell him that we have managed to lose his daughter along with 538 other people.”

#  

# Catherine Wright checked her watch, calculated the time difference between here and Washington DC.

#  

# Asked the maid, Mary Hudson, for more coffee and proceeded to call and wake up the most powerful man in the world.

#  

# Catherine Wright checked her watch, took a deep breath, and picked up the secure phone and called the President of the United States of America.

#  

# After two rings, the phone was picked up by one of the security staff on night duty, Catherine Wright explained who she was and said that it was imperative that she spoke with the President immediately. 

#  

# The secret service man told her that it was three am and asked what was so important that it justified waking up the president at this time of the morning.

#  

# Catherine said, “it is a highly personal matter, but it is of the utmost importance. I need to speak to him now.!”

#  

# The secret service man, put her on hold and radioed up to one of his colleagues on duty outside the Presidents bedroom, and relayed the message that the Prime Minister of the UK needed to speak to him urgently.

#  

# Ten minutes later, the President was sitting in his dressing room, a cup of coffee in front of him, as Catherine Wright broke the news to him that somehow, everybody on flight 0745 had vanished during the flight.

#  

# The bottom fell out of Jim Hoover’s world as he heard the news, his nineteen-year-old daughter Emily, was studying at Oxford University.

#  

# To keep Emily safe, she was using the name Sandy McManners, the US had issued her with all the official papers she needed to travel and study abroad without a large security detail.

#  

# Up until now, this had worked. But now, somehow despite all of their efforts, she and 538 other people had vanished without a trace, how was this possible.?

#  

# Jim shook himself mentally and wished for the millionth time that his beloved wife Belinda was still alive, he needed her wisdom and warmth more than ever now.

#  

# He called his chief of staff and had him call an emergency meeting at four am. Then he quickly got dressed and phoned his in laws to inform them of their granddaughters' disappearance. 

#  

# Then he phoned his own parents and told them the same, he promised both sets of grandparents that he would keep them informed of any developments as they happened.

#  

# Jim Hoover took the lift down to the Situation Room and took his seat, the secret service team had already briefed to kitchen about the early emergency meeting, so, they had produced plenty of coffee and toast ETC.

#  

# When the rest of the cabinet staff arrived, Jim Hoover was sat at the head of the table, a half-finished coffee in front of him and a picture of his late wife and his daughter in his hand.

#  

# The last member took his place and then silence fell over the room, all that could be heard was the ticking of the old grandfather clock in the corner.

#  

# After what seemed an age, Jim cleared his throat and spoke, he said, “ladies and gentlemen, I apologise for calling you here at such an ungodly hour, but a situation has arisen.

#  

# Yesterday afternoon a plane took off from Washington Dulles airport bound for London Heathrow airport. It arrived this morning at 06:50 GMT. 

#  

# It was carrying 539 passengers and crew, but when it landed, the plane was completely empty, everybody on board had vanished,

#  

# It was a direct flight, there were no stop offs en route, so, it is impossible for everyone to disappear like this.”

#  

# There was a babble of voices around the table, Jim Hoover stood silently watching them, when the noise died down, Jim continued, “one of the passengers was my daughter, Emily, she was travelling incognito. 

#  

# So, ladies and gentlemen, do you have any ideas about how they could have disappeared.?”

#  

# Meanwhile back in the UK, Catherine had called her own meeting of COBRA, after explaining what happened that morning at Heathrow Airport, she opened the floor for any suggestions.

#  

# A rather nondescript man wearing a black leather jacket and blue jeans said, “the first thing to do is to put a very tight ring of security around the hanger that the plane is currently inside, if you want, I can get some of my boys down here within the hour.”

#  

# Catherine nodded and said, “thank you Captain Hinde, that would be most helpful.”

#  

# Captain Hinde took a phone from his pocket, dialed a number, and spoke quietly into the phone, thirty seconds later, he hung up, nodded at Catherine, and said, “Done, a Chinook is picking them up in ten minutes, so they’ll be here in about 45 minutes.”

#  

# Other suggestions were mentioned, two of them were, check the black box, flight recorder to see if that picked up anything about what happened on the flight. 

#  

# The other suggestion was to check the overhead satellites to check the plane’s flight path to see if that could give any clues.

#  

# After the meeting was concluded, the air crash investigators at Fareham UK were contacted and were asked to send an investigator to Heathrow to remove the black box and analyse the contents of it, but to keep it a closely guarded secret for now.

#  

# In America, they had decided to investigate the personal details of the pilot and crew of flight 0745, while others were checking every inch of its flightpath, by satellite.

#  

# The air crash investigator from Fareham arrived at Heathrow and was escorted to the hanger by two heavily armed police officers, 

#  

# which was the second indication that something was wrong, the first was when the investigatory team couldn’t find any news of a crash at Heathrow.

#  

# To get into the hanger they had to pass through a ring of men dressed in black overalls, wearing full facemasks, and carrying machineguns.

#  

# Once the investigator entered the hanger, he asked one of the police men, “who were those men outside.?”

#  

# The police man gave a grim smile and said, “they are the hooligans from Hereford.”

#  

# The investigator, David Parry, said, “who.”

#  

# The police man said, “SAS”

#  

# David Parry gulped and turned to look at the plane, it was an American Airline Boeing 747. He climbed to stairs and under the watchful eye of the police officer, he removed the black box, flight recorder.

#  

# This done, he got the Police officer, Barry Roberts, to sign the papers, stated that he had watched David Parry remove the black box from flight 0745.

#  

# David Parry then returned to Fareham to check the black box, he connected it up to the mainframe computer and started downloading the information, once he had taken a backup of the information.

#  

# He called his boss into the room to listen to the play back, the first couple of hours of the flight were silent, then they heard the various control towers picking them up as they flew into their airspace. 

#  

# Then there was some radio chatter, but nothing between the pilot and co-pilot, there was no interruptions by the cabin crew bringing them food or drinks.

#  

# There was nothing on the black box from when they left Dulles Airport, nothing from the control tower, or any others that should have spoken to them until they passed them out in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.

#  

# This news was passed back to the team at Heathrow, they found this strange as well, so, they started checking the plane more thoroughly.

#  

# The head of the flight maintenance team, Joe Rice, called his opposite number at Dulles Airport asking for the records for the last time the plane was serviced.

#  

# After they received clearance from their bosses, they faxed the information over to Joe Rice and his Team, who immediately started checking everything on the plane. 

#  

# One of the first things they checked were the engines, listing down the serial numbers, and general condition, etc. 

#  

# These serial numbers were compared with the numbers listed in the maintenance log that had been received from Dulles, they didn’t match. 

#  

# So, Joe left his office and checked the numbers himself, they didn’t match, he even took a photo so he could double check when he got back to his office.

#  

# Back in his office, Joe downloaded the pictures onto his computer and checked them, the numbers definitely did not match, 

#  

# then he noticed something that he hadn’t seen while looking at the engines, they were covered in a light coating of sand. 

#  

# Joe thought this was strange, because America Airlines didn’t usually fly into any Arabic countries, so, he phoned back to Dulles Airport.

#  

# He said to his contact, “have you sent me the details of the right plane.?”

#  

# His contact, Earl Martell, said, “yes, why.?”

#  

# Joe said, “Well the engine serial numbers don’t match up. Plus, do you guys fly to sandy countries by any chance.?”

#  

# Earl paused for a moment and then said, “yes, they are the details of the right plane, and no, you are correct, American Airlines don’t fly to any sandy countries, why?”

#  

# Joe quickly emailed Earl the pictures he had just taken of the engines of the 747 that had landed at Heathrow that morning.

#  

# Earl swore and said to Joe, “Hey buddy, can you sit on this for a while, like ten minutes.?”

#  

# Joe said, “not really, my guys are climbing over the plane at the moment, and they are going to spot something very soon.”

#  

# Earl said, “ok, tell your bosses now, I’ll do the same here. Good luck, the shit is about to hit the fan.”

#  

# Just as Earl predicted, the shit really hit the fan, both here in the UK and in the USA.

#  

# At Heathrow, the maintenance crews climbed all over the 747 with a fine-toothed comb, checking everywhere. 

#  

# After about an hour of searching, an urgent call came over the radio, “a body had been found in the electronics chamber, which was located by the front baggage hold.

#  

# Access to the chamber was made by lifting a metal hatch in the passenger deck and descending a steep metal ladder into the front baggage hold, then through that via a panel into the electronics chamber.

#  

# The body was examined in situ, before being removed to the moved to the mortuary at Hounslow for post-mortem.

#  

# This was carried out by Dr Shirley Hooper, she started the post-mortem at 10:30 am, she started off by stating her name and the names of her two assistants, Karen Nolan, and Derek Lancaster.

#  

# They started by weighing and measuring the body, the Dr Hooper spoke into the overhead microphone, “the body is that of a well-nourished white male, approximately thirty years of age, 

#  

# There are no visible signs of injuries present on the body, there are a few old scars, these will be photographed and noted, some of these scars look medical in origin,

#  

# Samples have been taken for testing; the brain has been removed for scanning for any signs of cancer or tumours.

#  

# The stomach contents show that the last meal that was eaten was chicken and rice, note to self, check with America as to what the pilot ate before the flight. 

#  

# Derek Lancaster made a note to remind himself to check with the Americans, finally the post-mortem was completed, the incisions were sewn up, and the body was placed into a refrigerated drawer to await whatever fate awaited it.

#  

# In America, the flight crews' personal histories were checked into, right back until they left high school, the pilot, Captain James Boyle the third, was a former pilot in the USAF. 

#  

# He had served for ten years and left with the rank of Major, he had been with American Airlines for twelve years and had an impeccable flying record. 

#  

# The co-pilot was Julie Craker, she had served in the USAF under James Boyle, she was a thirty-seven-year-old black woman,

#  

# She had been with American Airlines for eight years, again with an impeccable record.

#  

# All the cabin crew had been with American Airlines for at least five years, none of them had as much as a mark on their records for being rude to a passenger.

#  

# So, the FBI searched everything about the crew, their search revealed that one of the cabin crew was a lesbian, one of the others had downloaded child porn onto her computer, another one was having an affair.

#  

# But when they checked in to Captain James Boyle the third, they discovered that he was hiding a big secret, a massive secret, he was a closet Muslim.

#  

# For all the years that he had been in the USAA, and had been flying for American Airlines, he had been hiding this major secret from everybody. 

#  

# This news shook the FBI team to the core; a committed Muslim was flying the President’s daughter across the globe.

#  

# The news of this was sent straight to the White house and the message was passed directly to Joe Hoover, he held his head in despair.

#  

# The news sped across the Atlantic to Downing Street and the P.M called an emergency meeting of COBRA to keep them up to date on the latest developments.

#  

# The DNA testing had brought in a familial match, it was for a family living in Scarbough, the family was immediately put under surveillance.

#  

# Their data was accessed straight away, the father was called Brian Sale, he worked at the local garage as a mechanic, the mother was called Jane Sale, she worked as a secretary at the nearby hospital, 

#  

# they had three sons, one was called Colin, he was sixteen-year-old and still in at school, the middle son was called Michael, he was eighteen and studying electro engineering at university, 

#  

# the eldest was Ben, he was twenty-four, he had studied world religions at Oxford university, but had dropped out, converted to Islam, changed his name, travelled to Pakistan, and lived there for about three years, his parents had no idea of his current whereabouts. 

#  

# When Catherine Wright disclosed this piece of news, Captain Hinde said, “Clever, using a cleanskin.”

#  

# Catherine said, “I beg your pardon.?”

#  

# David Hinde said, “a cleanskin, a Caucasian person, who hasn’t been in trouble with the police, they can get into places that somebody of Asian heritage wouldn’t be able to, or at least not without a lot of attention being drawn to them.

#  

# I bet when this guy landed the plane, the air traffic controller who spoke to him didn’t notice that he didn’t have an American accent, but he certainly would have noticed an Asian accent.”

#  

# The dental records confirmed the identity of the pilot of the 747 at Heathrow was Ben Sale.

#  

# The next thing to do was the find out how the two planes had been switched mid-flight, so, every inch of the flight was scrutinised, both by the American’s and the British.

#  

# Both teams came to the same conclusion, the switch must have taken place mid-Atlantic, the last control tower that picked them up on US soil was in Nova Scotia.

#  

# The next control tower to speak to them would be in Ireland, so for several hours they would be out of radio contact with anyone.

#  

# So, the search was narrowed into the vast area of empty ocean, as one agent was heard to say, “this is like looking for a needle in a whole field of haystacks.”

#  

# The families of the passengers who had been on board flight 0745 were told that there had been a chemical leak on board, necessitating the immediate quarantine of all the passengers and crew. 

#  

# The quarantine would be of an indeterminate period, the families would be kept informed of proceedings. 

#  

# The search for the missing plane continued, meanwhile, the toxicology report on Ben Sales body found the presence of cyanide, 

#  

# So, it looked like he landed the plane at Heathrow, spoke to the control tower, taxied to the right place, parked, then climbed down into the electronic cabinet, took cyanide after cramming himself into a tight place to hide his body his body for as long as possible.

#  

# So, they now knew who had flown the plane into Heathrow, now they just had to find the missing plane with the 539 people on board.

#  

# Experts both in the UK and in America, searched the route taken by flight 0745 for days, then finally, they spotted the flight suddenly descend from 38,000 feet and disappear from the radar and just as suddenly climb back to its original flying altitude.

#  

# It happened so quickly and smoothly, that if you weren’t looking for it, it would have gone un-noticed.

#  

# The switchover had taken place close to the coast of North Africa, so now the American satellite pictures were very carefully scanned.

#  

# In the middle of the Western Sahara, is a small settlement called Bir Anzerane, it is a small trading post, but there is a large main road that runs past it.

#  

# The satellite pictures showed, parked on the hard packed sand beside the road, was a Boeing 747, bearing the livery of American Airlines.

#  

# They checked with American Airlines, no planes had been sold anywhere in the Western Sahara, plus there weren’t any airports in that area.

#  

# The plane had been found, now they had to find the passengers and crew. 

#  

# The surveillance teams now widened their search by five miles in each direction, but found nothing, so they expanded their search to twenty miles.

#  

# They found a large, tented enclosure not far from an oasis, a satellite was positioned above the camp so that they had a real-time picture of events. 

#  

# The footage revealed that there were approximately fifty armed guards, holding the missing passengers, the satellite focused in so closely that they could make out individual faces. 

#  

# Stills were saved from the live feed, and these were checked against the passport photos taken at Dulles Airport before the flight took off.

#  

# Within twenty minutes, a message was sent to Joe Hoover at the White House, one of his aides interrupted a meeting he was in to pass him the sealed envelope.

#  

# President Hoover took the envelope with shaking hands, tore it open and read the contents, he let out the breath that he didn’t know that he was holding.

#  

# And for the first time in about twenty hours, felt that there was a tiny glimmer of hope, he told the rest of the chiefs of staff at the meeting the good news.

#  

# Admiral Paul Mayfield, spoke, he said, “I’ll get the SEALs ready for action as soon as possible, Joe.” 

#  

# There were no ranks used in staff meetings. 

#  

# Joe Hoover said, “that’s a good idea, we had better link up with the intel boys to get some up-to-date data on what we’ll be facing.”

#  

# General Carl Cooper of the USAA, said, “I’ll get transport organised, I assume that any possible raid will have to take off from the UK, so, if the seals are ready, we can send them and the kit they need across the pond tonight so, they will be ready for action asap.”

#  

# Joe Hoover said, “I think that it would be a good idea to get the SAS involved, they are good at this desert fighting stuff aren’t they.”

#  

# The meeting concluded with an agreement to get the SEALs ready to fly to the UK that night, Joe Hoover phoned Catherine Wright and informed her about the rescue plan.

#  

# She immediately asked if he needed SAS assistance. 

#  

# He said, “of course, they would be a great help.”

#  

# So, it was decided, a four-man team from the SAS would make a HALO jump that night, to do a recognisance of the camp, the guards, and the prisoners. 

#  

# So that night, four men under the command of Scotty White, were taken by chopper to Heathrow and they boarded a flight ostentatiously headed for Paraguay, this necessitated a flight across the edge of the Western Desert.

#  

# Once they were over the desert, the four-man team jumped into the inky blackness of the desert sky.

#  

# HALO stands for “High Altitude Low Opening.” Tonight, they jumped from 35,000 feet, all were wearing oxygen masks and thick clothing to combat the freezing temperatures associated with high altitude.

#  

# They were dropped ten miles away from their target and using the guide ropes on the parachutes were able to steer themselves closer to their target. 

#  

# As soon as they left the plane, they could see the lights of the campfires marking their target, so they carefully steer towards them.

#  

# When the altimeter was reading 800 feet, they pulled the cords, and their pure black parachutes blossomed above them. 

#  

# They landed and quickly secured the area, one facing each direction, once they were sure that they hadn’t been discovered, Scotty got on the radio and sent a squirt message back to the UK, 

#  

# A squirt message is a message that has been compressed and encrypted then sent, it can encrypt the bible down and send it in a message less than 10 seconds long.

#  

# While he was sending the message, Dan Cotton, Billy Staverton, and Andy Broadman, was busy setting up a lying up position, and setting weapons just in case they got bumped.

#  

# They didn’t light a fire, they knew that they would be on hard routine, i.e. no hot food, or hot drinks, no smoking etc.

#  

# Before dawn, Billy, and Andy, made their way closer to the camp so they could get eyes on, to really log the comings and goings, it was hot lying in a scraped-out position in the sand under a canvas sheet, but they had been through worse.

#  

# After a long day of getting bitten by sand fleas, when the sun went down, Billy and Andy left the scrape and returned to the LUP.

#  

# The information they recovered was quickly sent back to the UK, meanwhile back in America, the SEALs were being flown by helicopter to Hurlburt Field, In Florida for the long flight to the UK aboard a C17 plane, the largest plane the US military possess.

#  

# In the UK, a plan was being made, the SAS were put on standby, the plan was for them to be dropped ten miles away from the camp, complete with land rovers and motorcycles.

#  

# They would land, travel across the desert to the LUP, rendezvous with Scotty and his team, then at three am, silently take out any sentry’s, take out any sleeping guards that they could, before it got noisy, i.e. somebody started firing.

#  

# The SEALs arrived in the UK, and the following day they were ready to board their flight to the Western Sahara, they were going to meet up with the SAS at the forward rendezvous point.

#  

# The SEALs would come in the left flank and the SAS on the right; the SAS took the side where the guard tents were situated. 

#  

# All went according to plan, the two teams crept into the camp like desert wraiths, drifting from shadow to shadow, leaving behind them a trail of bodies.

#  

# Finally, the two teams met at the outside of the prisoners' tents, they were being guarded by three guards, two of them were dozing, one was pacing nervously back and forth.

#  

# Finally, he left his post, walked behind a tree, and started to relieve himself, a shadow rose behind him and silently placed a hand over his mouth 

#  

# and stabbed him through the throat, then turned the knife and pushed the blade forward, ripping out his throat, without a throat, the guard couldn’t make a sound.

#  

# The other two guards were dealt with the same way, then after the camp was secured, they entered the prisoners' tents.

#  

# Inside they found that the prisoners had all been handcuffed the entire time they had be held prisoner, some of the female prisoners had been repeatedly raped. 

#  

# Inside the male tent, most of the male prisoners had been beaten, all had black eyes, and other marks of ill treatment.

#  

# In the female tent, they asked that Julie Craker could make herself known, a hand went up and a slim black woman rose to her feet.

#  

# The head SEAL introduced himself, he said, “ma'am, I’m James Butler, Lieutenant US Navy SEALs, can I confirm if you are able to still fly.?”

#  

# Julie forced a smile and said, “You bet your sweet ass, I can.”

#  

# James Butler made a call, and a fleet of Chinooks were soon on their way, Meanwhile the SAS were headed towards the town of Bir Anzerane, to take over the small settlement.

#  

# This was soon accomplished, and then they started refilling the giant 747 ready for take-off. Soon the chinooks started to ferry the passengers to Bir Anzerane, 

#  

# Julie Craker was among the first to board the plane, she quickly started the pre-flight checks as more and more of the passengers were boarding the plane.

#  

# Among the last to board was a figure who was struggling against his handcuffs, it was a very disheveled looking James Boyle, the captain who had flown the plane when it had left Dulles airport.

#  

# He was unceremoniously dumped in a seat and was strapped into place using cable ties. As he kept swearing and cursing, one of the SEALs shoved a napkin in his mouth.

#  

# As the sun was rising, flight 0745 taxied across to the road, accelerated to take-off speed and lifted off into the morning sun, as the wheel lifted off the tarmac, there was a resounding cheer from the passengers.

#  

# As the plane reached cruising altitude, they were joined by a flight of Eurofighters from the RAF.

#  

# They escorted flight 0745 to Heathrow, as soon as they were within range of Ireland, the control tower said, “Welcome home flight 0745, We’ve missed you.”

#  

# They landed at Heathrow to a hero’s welcome, Julie Craker was treated like a heroine, the passengers were escorted off the plane and into a large room where they could phone relatives etc.

#  

# Emily Hoover was taken to a private room where she phoned her father for a very tearful reunion, but the meeting that James Boyle was in was not so pleasant.

#  

# He was taken from the flight, shove into a car with blacked out window and driven to Grosvenor Sq. in central London, to the American Embassy. 

#  

# In the basement are several rooms where rather robust questioning is carried out, these rooms are soundproof and as they are part of the American Embassy, they are classed as American soil, So the UK laws don’t apply there.

#  

# Back at Heathrow, Julie Craker was interviewed about what happened on the flight, during the flight, she was taking a nap, when James Boyle had suddenly turned the oxygen level down causing everybody on board to pass out, 

#  

# When she had awoken, she was handcuffed to her seat, and they were flying at about 200 feet above the sea, James was talking to somebody in a language that she didn’t understand.

#  

# After landing, he maneuvered the plane of the road he had landed on and onto the sand beside it, James then opened the door and several men entered the plane, they were carrying guns.

#  

# We were all taken off the plane and loaded onto lorries, driven across the sand until we reached the oasis, that is where they had set up a camp for us.

#  

# Her voice broke as she said, “during the time we were being held, all of the women were repeatedly raped.”

#  

# After hearing this, the woman talking to her, opened her arms and gave Julie a hug, as the two stood there, the tears were flowing, from both of them. 

#  

# The authorities made arrangements for all the women from the flight were given counselling to get them through the ordeal of 1, being held hostage, 2, being repeatedly raped. Each woman was also tested for any STDs.

#  

# Back in the Western Desert, the SAS and SEALs were clearing up before being extraction back to the UK, the bodies and camp were searched before the two teams left on the Chinooks.

#  

# Before they left, they removed any information they had gathered, then left a laser pointer in the middle of the camp, thirty minutes after they left, a missile guided by the laser pointer impacted in the centre of the camp obliterating everything within a 500-yard radius.

#  

# The chinooks landed back in Germany, refueled, and flew on to the UK. From there the SAS returned to Stirling lines at Hereford and the SEALs after a night's sleep, returned to their base in the USA.

#  

# The End.

My 1 day Inca trail was cancel by the provider last minute.  I think it is a mix blessing.  

  
We flew in and got to Lima around 10PM but did not settle in Wyndham airport hotel til 12.  Hotel was good but I was misinformed by Chase Travel Site showing it was on LIM ground.  It has since updated to be 10 minute shuttle ride away.  The holiday Inn across is 40% cheaper. We took the 5am flight to Cuzco and we did the half Sacred Valley trip and requested drop off at Ollantaytambo train station boarded the 4:30PM train to Aguas Clientes.  The half Sacred Valley trip was about right.  7AM-4PM not too rush.  This part of travel from US to AG is just too tiring.  I should have spend a day in Cuzco.

We didn't experience any altitude discomfort, but my wife 50+ said she was exhaust after the circuit 1 hike. so the altitude does take its toll. She wouldn't make it on the Inca trail. 

  
I book the only available ticket online 4 weeks out which was circuit 1.  There is no pre-pre ticket.  I lined up around 6:30am and the line was stretched to around El Mapai Hotel, with that position I got number 489.  Number 489 I got circuit 2 tickets and there were still 130ish left but all the pre 12PM were gone.  There are plenty of tour guide that will approach you while you are in the line for the bus.   I think I did not bargain hard enough with my guide.  I paid my circuit 1 guide $45 and $65 for my circuit 2 guy.  The $45 guide was much better.  He also has a college degree.  I think I should have just take the bus up but hike down.  

  
The Peru rail,Vistadome is definitely not worth it.  You don't really see that much more and the entertainment was meh.

  
Gringo Bill hotel was excellent.  Clean good size room.  Water pressure was strong and plenty of hot water.  Breakfast was solid with made to order omelette, pastries, fruits, coffee and juice.

Stay 2 nights in Urubamba and did the second half of the sacred valley tour from 12PM-6:30PM and had the guide drop us off at CUZ airport.

  
We really enjoy different guides' take on Inca civilization.

1mbvylj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mbvylj,Am I overreacting or is my roommate acting dumb on purpose?,"I live in an apartment with a roommate. We have a decently sized kitchen, but with both of our stuff combined it gets a little cramped. I've tried to be really good about organizing. Everything has a place. The reason I'm making this post is because my roommate keeps moving everything around. It would be one thing if she just moved stuff to the size to give herself a bit of extra room, but no. The way she does things genuinely makes no sense to me.

This all started when I noticed she puts everything that's supposed to go on the counter onto the floor when she cooks (fruit bowl, cutting boards, lamp, cookbooks). I thought that was a bit weird, but I didn't say anything. I just asked her to put things back when she was done. She didn't. Then I noticed she did the same thing when making coffee in the morning. She keeps her coffee maker in one of the cabinets and pulls it out whenever she needs to use it. There's plenty of room on the counter for her to just unplug something, make her coffee, and then put it away, but no. Everything on the floor in the corner of the kitchen.

Today she made a grilled cheese. I watched as she took everything off the counter and the stove and put it on the floor (I keep my Dutch oven and kettle on the two back burners, which still leaves two free). Apparently she needs the extra room to put a slice of cheese in between two slices of bread and heat it up in a pan. I'm genuinely so sick of it. I think I'm going to leave her a note asking her once again to please put my stuff back when she's done. If that doesn't work, next time I cook I'm going to take all of her stuff off the counter and leave it on the dirty ass floor. 

You know what never leaves the counter? Those damn kitchen towels, even though they take up like 50% of the available counter space. Apparently she needs them there 24/7 in case she needs to dry dishes. Anyways, I've included pictures of my kitchen so you all can see what I'm talking about.

1mbvwtb,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1mbvwtb/am_i_the_problem/,Am I The Problem?,"Hi everyone,

I was hoping to get a bit of advice.

I have been in a relationship with a partner who is married but has an agreement with their other half.

There is an age gap between us and I am the younger partner.

We met over a mutual hobby and have been together for the past couple of years.

We have experienced and created some really special memories but over the past couple of years, I have found myself questioning who I am as a person.

I like to think that I am quite a social person and that I can talk to almost everyone. However I began to notice that whenever I interacted with a certain gender my partner would become upset. 

It all began with an image that I had posted from a featured event that I had organised and featured myself and the guest. My partner accused me of cheating. This was not the case.

The following year, my partner was away with their family and I took the decision to meet up with a friend who was also an ex but we were on really friendly terms. It was a decision taken upon a whim and all very short notice. I went for a meal with the friend and had a drink and came home. 

When my partner questioned this, I remembered the previous event and I panicked and stated that the friend I had met had been with her parents. 

When my partner found out, she was furious with me and it nearly broke the relationship up and my partner has brought it up nearly ever single week since it happened. 

My friend called when I was with my partner and my partner was rude and told her to ‘fuck off’. It resulted in my partner inspecting all my phone messages and social media messages. My partner took the number of my friend and messaged her. The messages that my partner saw led her to accuse me of microcheating as I had messaged people who my partner saw as threatening.

From here my partner took a list of names on her phone and I would have to take images of all my social media messages and send them to my partner to be inspected which would lead to further questions and another disagreement.

I would have to report what I had planned for the week and my partner would then state that they felt I comfortable with me going and engaging in some hobbies which I would then have to cancel.

I was juggling my desires to improve in my hobby with my relationship.

On a night out, my partner looked through my phone and found that I had messaged someone on their list and was angry and ran into the toilet with my phone. My partner came out of the toilet threw a drink in my face and left. 

I was able to resolve this situation but things have progressed from there.

I went away with my partner and we were at a venue with people who we know and my partner stated that we were leaving and I was not quick enough to follow her and she became cross. I tried to find my partner and ended up returning to my group of friends. My partner came back and we returned to the car where we argued again. My partner became cross with me whilst driving and hit me numerous times, when I tried to stop her my partner screamed out and I had to sit and take the blows as I was fearful that it would look like I was the issue. The blows kept coming and I swore at my partner and continued to try and protect myself. My partner told me that I would have to find my own way back home.

I messaged friends and no one was able to help me. I managed to get into the hotel room and stayed there and managed to persuade my partner to let me stay and let me travel with her. The following day it was a whole different story and we had a nice day relaxing and then returned home.

We have been out with friends a few times. On one occasion, I lost my phone and I couldn’t find it and I was panicking. I looked over the restaurant, in the car and everywhere that I had been even asking at the bar and no one has seen it. We had travelled with friends and on the way back I started to suspect that my partner had my phone and I asked my partner a number of times which my partner denied. when we got back I discovered my partner had my phone and stated that she had just found it on the floor of the footwell. I had looked in the footwell at it was not there when I had looked.

Everything came to ahead a few weeks ago where we travelled to watch a show. I bought coffee for my family. Prior to the performance, my partner saw my phone and saw a new person who she took a disliking too. She took my phone and ran off with it and would not give me the phone back. I tried to take it from her hand and then got a strange look and moved away. My partner gave me my phone back prior to the performance beginning. During the performance, my partner would put their hand on me and I started to find this distracting and when I asked my partner to stop she did this all the more and didn’t not stop. By the end of the show, I was incredibly upset and felt really low.

I asked my partner why they had done that and they admitted that they did it to try and annoy me. We had an argument and broke up. My partner wrote a post on Facebook aimed at me. 

Whenever we have argued my partner has accused me of being a narcissist.

Since that point, I have spoken with my partner and we have spent some time together until she again saw my phone and saw that I had messaged someone that was on her list which has lead to her contacting the person and also requesting that I leave a hobby. 

My partner has a number of friends who they talk to and my partner states that they have discussed that she has hit me etc with them. My partner always shares the messages of support that are sent checking that my partner is ok, that my partner needs to leave me, or that my partner needs to look out for themselves.

I feel I’m being painted as a person who I am not. I’m being drawn into a world which is totally alien to me and I’m balancing protecting myself, with feelings and also still trying to maintain contact with people.

Every story has two sides and the truth is often somewhere in the middle. I am not trying to paint myself as perfect as I am not but I don’t really have anyone to turn to or talk to about this and really just need some advice and see if I am the issue.

I’ve been working on a major task for the past three weeks, pouring in hours, late nights, and all my energy. Today was supposed to be the day I delivered results. Instead, everything broke. It collapsed right in front of me, and I had to start all over again from scratch, with my team waiting.

It’s hard to explain the mix of shame, frustration, and exhaustion I feel. I know I gave it my all. But the result doesn’t reflect the effort… that disconnect really hurts 😭

On top of that, I’ve not been the best human lately. I acted like a Karen at the grocery store and i feel awful. The pressure has gotten to me and I’ve snapped. Also i promised a friend to go out with her after work and after showing up, i realized i really shouldn’t have. I jusg wanted to cry and i need space more than i could explain, so i apologized and left. I think it rubbed her the wrong way.

I took a gym break hoping it would help clear my head… it didn’t :( I’m overstimulated from all the coffee i had. I feel like I’m being judged, even if maybe no one is. Maybe it’s just me being disappointed in myself.

Still, I keep reminding myself… effort was made!!! I did care. It just didn’t go as planned. And maybe that has to be enough for today.

If you’re feeling anything like this, pressured, misunderstood, burned out, you’re not alone. I see you. I get it. And we’ll get through it, even if today it feels otherwise.",3,1753745416.0,DecidingToBeBetter,3,1.0,False

1mbvqe2,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiveparents/comments/1mbvqe2/my_foster_family/,My foster family,"So I’ve been living in a foster home in Yuba City for over a year, my foster family who I can’t even call a family has been manipulative and two faced. It all started in May of last year when I first came here. Things like the foster brother would say and do without real consequences went by mostly unnoticed because every family has favorites. It wasn’t until the kid would start beating on the girls in front of me and expressing abusive tendencies. He also has a tendency of breaking the rules very often, buying energy drinks, staying up, all that bs the family doesn’t allow. But the biggest victim of his nonsense is the foster dad, who we call Ray. And my roommate who’s name I won’t say for her anonymity. My roommate has been here for over 4 in a half years, and she’s been hit and called names the whole time. Two months ago, she made coffee and went off somewhere. And he took the time to put condiments in her drink (lots of salt, Worcestershire sauce, mayo, ground black pepper, ect.) and she ended up drinking it and throwing up. This isn’t the first instance of him messing with other peoples food and drinks from what I personally heard. And a little over two years ago, he tried walking into the room where I currently stay in. There was another foster girl I call Ash, for her anonymity as well. She and my roommate had a rule where if you were changing the other person can stay in the room only if they look at the wall or they can leave. And the son, Paul. Tried to get into the room while Ash was changing. She caught it on camera. 

PSA: The next two section involves descriptions of groping and SA.

Ash had a Sister who I’ll call Alia, and she stayed with the other foster girl named Angelina (her original name was Tracy and there’s nothing angelic about either of those names or her ass) who is buddy buddy with the foster mom, Judy. And one specific day, she and Alia were having non-consensual sex (which happened numerous times keep in mind that it wasn’t even a relationship) on the top bunk of the bed, my roommate was in there and heard the exchange. Alia told Angelina to stop and Angelina decided to keep going. This is the definition of rape. Considering they’re both AFAB. Penetration was done using the fingers. I don’t even like thinking about it but I have to get this out. One day the girl ran away with her father who was allegedly a pedo. But now she lives safely with her mom, baby sibling, and her sister. They took it to court but nothing came of it. Angelina went to juvenile for 3 days before coming back. She deserves a lot longer for what she did to her biological brother and Alia.

Fast forward to when I come a year later. A few more months pass. Angelina made weird comments and said things that made me feel uncomfortable, while I was washing dishes late at night, and she came up to me and started rubbing my back before sliding her hand down to my ass and squeezed, of course I didn’t respond because I was too scared. I was only a victim of being groped though. Sure, we have cameras all over the house due to these types of past instances and runaways, but since my body was blocked by the counter waist down, it wasn’t visible.


There is also this ongoing lie about Angelina being “ill” she has been pretending to have a disease. Throwing up in the car could be explained by motion sickness. But if I see you visibly sticking your fingers down your throat in the car while trying to cover it up by burying your face in a trash bag. It’s obvious you’re fucking lying. She also had vomiting sounds on her YouTube history. She’d go off and play them while in the bathroom. And I only noticed when it sounded too repetitive. And to actually get a pic of the puke, she’d force herself to vomit. I only noticed it when I saw that her fingers were coated in saliva and such when she got out. This took place in a church bathroom. So she had to get out of the stall to wash her hands. Which prompted me to see it.

The foster family are forcing religion on me.

I have nothing against Christianity and I have a mixed view when it comes to religion. As someone who’s agnostic but interested in studying religions and beliefs. I respect their devotion. But when they try to force their agenda on me. I only lose respect for that one church, group, person, ect. I came out on a CFT (Child Family Team) meeting which was on zoom. It was a statement which was if I was gonna get moved to another home, it had to be one in Sacromento (my hometown) and it had to be LGBTQIA+ safe. As someone who’s Bi and goes by She/They it would make me feel safe. When I got back from my visit, Judy had a meeting and basically said that if I wasn’t going to go by the Christian way. I can leave. Which is bs. I have a right to not believe in what the family believes in. But you may be asking. Why do I still stay? It’s for my bio brother. I don’t want to be separated from the only family I have. I have my grandma, yes. But I don’t see her every day and I can’t stay there because she has health complications. 

I can update you guys later if you are willing to listen to the rest of my stories from my stay here.

1mbvq7v,https://i.redd.it/7jk6vc778pff1.jpeg,Driver stole my doormat,"Yesterday I was off from work and decided to pack a bowl and order some food. Well, I went out to smoke in my backyard (fenced in, no access to the front) when my food was dropped off. I went through my house to grab my bag (it was in 2 bags but I ordered 2 things I figured maybe they just put them each in their own bag) and dropped them on my counter. Dasher was already gone. I then went outside to finish my bowl. 

During the time I was outside, someone came up to our door and began yelling and pounding on the door, which obviously I had not heard since I was out back. I only know this because we have a door camera and asked my gf to check it this morning when I left for work and noticed the doormat missing. Well, that second bag happened to be another customer’s food and I think that’s why the driver was flipping out outside. If I had known it was someone else’s food, I would have left it out. When I came back in, I waited for a call about it, but nothing ever came. I figured it was fine because this happened with my gf one time when she got another customer’s coffee in addition to her own. But now I’m out a doormat :/ 

It makes me angry because if they would have just attempted to call or text I would have been more than happy to give them the other order. I don’t really understand this reaction. Even if I was sitting on the other side of the door, scheming to steal this person’s food, deciding to take personal property knowing there is a camera right there is just wild. I feel a little guilty because they did try knocking, and I would have opened the door if I had heard it, but all sympathy goes out the window when you take my stuff and run off without even attempting to call. I don’t understand why these jerks get approved to dash when so many people can’t get past the screening. I’ve dashed before and I would never do this to a customer, and I’ve had some ridiculous orders. It just really bums me out. I’m calling support today after work, so crossing my fingers I can at the very least get reimbursed for my meal. ",32,1753744973.0,doordash,12,0.98,False

(Throwaway account because I'm worried my main could somehow be tracked back to me & out the other folks in my brain.)



I'll get into the specifics regarding DID, but first, I'll provide some context as to why I'm asking: For the first time EVER in my life, I am doing well! After years of intensive physical & mental health treatments, finally finding a rewarding job with a healthy work environment, & the amount of abuse I suffer drastically declining, I'm in a stable place. Not just having one-off good days or simply trying to survive hour by hour. Actually thriving. In the last few years, I've been very hesitant to make new friends as I've previously been burned by both individuals & groups (physical abuse, gaslighting, DARVO, my words & actions being twisted, & worst of all, befriending cringe lords.) Making friends is a risk. It could mean another round of trusting people who prove to be less than trustworthy. So, while I was Going Through It, I opted to spend my free time primarily by myself. But, now that I'm in a significantly better place, I plan on taking baby steps outside my comfort zone by joining clubs in my area. Hopefully, I'll make friends! I'm also very loosely on Bumble. (Frankly, dating apps feel like a chore, so I'm not on them much. But, since I'm open to it, it is a possibility I could have a partner as well in the future.)  


Now let's get into some FAQ's about DID:  
(Disclaimer: I'm not a mental health professional. This comes from both research & my own bank of personal knowledge that has been fact checked from reputable resources. Links will be at the bottom. I am not putting myself through the hell of citations, but everything below is from one of the links below. I am an untrained, very fallible human. If you are within the realms of psychology/neuroscience & have any additions or corrections, please add them! (That offer is not extended to people who get all their info from TikTok. Psychology fact! We're not gonna be spreading short form misinformation here.)  


1. **What is DID?** (Pulled straight from the Cleveland Clinic.) ""Dissociative identity disorder (DID) is a mental health condition where you have two or more separate personalities that control your behavior at different times. When personalities switch, you’ll have gaps in your memory. The identities are usually caused by living through trauma."" It is caused be extreme, persistent trauma from ages 0-5. It is in the family of dissociative disorders, which are ""mental health conditions that involve experiencing a loss of connection between thoughts, memories, feelings, surroundings, behavior and identity. These conditions include escape from reality in ways that are not wanted and not healthy. This causes problems in managing everyday life."" (From the Mayo Clinic.) Symptoms include the presence of two or more distinctive identities, derealization (feeling reality isn't real/outside your body,) depersonalization (feeling you aren't real,) gaps in memory/amnesia, difficulty coping with stress, difficulty in relationships, a blurred sense of self, and more.
2. **Why did its name get changed?** There are two main reasons. The first is to better explain that the multiple personalities are actually one personality that has fragmented. (I personally think of it like a mirror. One whole image but each little piece reflects that image differently.) The second is because ""identity"" is more accurate than ""personality"" as it refers to sense of self as opposed to consistent patterns of thought, behaviors, & emotions. (I'll be real, this part confuses even me. But, from my understanding, it's like...Think of the Pixar movie, *Soul*. The character 23 is mischievous, curious, and nervous. No matter what, they will always have those traits. That part is the personality. At the end of the movie, they finally go into a body. But we don't know which body they went into. It could be an East Asian boy from a well off family who is great at boating. Could be a nonbinary person from South America who loves map making and the color green. They could be the next pope or president or literally anyone. That part is the identity. I think?) Again, people who know more about psychology than me, please chime in here.
3. **Is it related to schizophrenia?** No. Schizophrenia is a thought disorder, which means its a cognitive disturbance that affects language, thought, & communication. Symptoms include delusions (a strong change in perception/beliefs that contradict concrete evidence) or Causes are highly linked to genetics, differences in brain development, & drug usage. (Don't any of you judge those with schizophrenia or those who use substances. They are humans. They are not morally inferior, unintelligent, or inherently dangerous. They could be suffering. They could be living as healthy, happy, & fulfilling lives as they can. If they're shitty people, they're shitty people because of who they continuously & consciously choose to be. Not because of a mental health condition or making choice you might not necessarily make. Just have empathy & mind your own.)
4. **Are people with DID dangerous?** Contrary to many medias portraying people with DID as serial killers, no. People who have committed crimes in the 90's used the excuse of having, what at the time was called, Multiple Personality Disorder. But that doesn't add up. Legally, someone is only insane if something cognitively obstructed their understanding of right & wrong & the consequences of their actions. Generally speaking, that doesn't apply to people with DID as a sense of justice always remains. Courts tend to reject DID as an excuse as to why crimes are committed. But let's step out of legal-speak & into average, everyday, logical speak. People with DID are *people*. Just with an altered sense of self. The average person is not violent nor a criminal. (Side note: why tf was that guy in *Split* living below a zoo??? Also, why did being traumatized give him superpowers? Is the next big hit gonna be *Overstimulated*, a film about a criminal mastermind with autism living next to The Cleveland Browns stadium???)
5. **How common is DID?** You might be surprised to learn it isn't an ultra rare disorder. 1.5% of the global population is estimated to have this disorder, according to National Institutes of Health. That's 40 million people. That's 2 million more than the population of Poland, 30 million more than people with Parkinson's, & 35 million more than people who practice Judaism worldwide. Some estimates on how many people have DID globally range all the way up to 5%! (Even I was shocked to learn how many of us are out there!)



Here's my thought process on whether or not in the form of a pro's & con's list:



**PRO'S OF DISCLOSING MY DISORDER**

1. **Provide info.** The other person would be as informed as possible to make a decision as to whether they're comfortable pursuing a friendship/romantic relationship. It would also make me feel more comfortable knowing they fully understand what the hell is wrong with me & choose to be in my life regardless.
2. **Build trust & understanding.** It would demonstrate to the other person that I trust them enough to handle very private & sensitive information.
3. **Lessen guilt.** I wouldn't have the guilt of feeling like I'm withholding truths that they possibly deserve to know. (I feel I don't owe people medical information & I also feel it's a bit unfair for people to not get the full picture.)
4. **Unmasking symptoms.** Taking the mask off & letting my alters be able to front freely would be such a relief. One of them is 100% an introvert & does not enjoy any social interaction, but all the others feel stifled & trapped. Most speak wildly differently than I do, both in terms of vernacular & accent, so letting them talk when they're up front, most of the time, would out us
5. **Weed people out**. If someone is gonna treat me differently because of a mental disorder, I'd prefer to know sooner rather than later so I can gtfo of that friendship/relationship. The stigma against & fear of people with mental health issues is extremely real.



**CON'S OF DISCLOSING MY DISORDER**



1. **It could be used against me**. This isn't just a hypothetical situation rooted in just anxiety. Family & friends have used my PTSD, anxiety, depression, & borderline diagnoses/symptoms to dismiss my thoughts, feelings, & actions. School staff have largely treated me like I'm lazy & don't care when in reality, I'm just overwhelmed. I've even been fired from a job once for disclosing to an employer that I had PTSD.\*\*\*
2. **Could be treated differently**. Being treated like a child, I'm violent, or incapable always sucks. Or asked to be the spokesperson of a mental health condition. Again, I'd rather know up front if someone is going to be weird about me having DID so I can cut them off sooner rather than later. And, at the same time, it'll suck big time.
3. **Could attract weirdos/abusers.** If I meet someone who infantalizies those with mental health conditions or treats it like a cutesie, lil TikTok trend, I'm gonna ruin their day about it, I stfg. But I'm a lot more concerned about someone realizing, ""Oh, hey! This person has amnesia, has a hard time trusting their own judgment, & often relies on other to fill in the gaps in their memory. They'll be easy to manipulate."" & then do just that.
4. **Possibly emotionally charged conversation/uuuugh.** Discussing a mental health condition caused by trauma could bring up some intense emotions on both ends. I am absolutely confident I can handle a conversation like this, which is why I'm open to it in the first place. If I start to feel like it's too much, I'll let the person know & do what I need to do to take care of myself. And at the same time, I feel, like...over it. Moreso like ""ugh, this a chore."" I haven't even had these conversations yet & I feel like I've gone through the same song & dance a million times before. Like this a trip to the DMV. (I know this comes from on again/off again burnout regarding being an unwitting educator about parts of my identity/background at times. People are just curious & I think it's great to ask appropriate questions at appropriate times! And also, I think it's more than understandable that the more questions I get about my race, gender, physical chronic illnesses, mental health, etc., the less understood I feel. And boy, do people who barely know me love to ask ignorant or invasive questions at the most absurd times. All of that being said, I'm more than happy to answer questions here because I have opened up the conversation and am mentally prepared. Also because it's online so if things get stressful, I simply turn off my device and touch grass.)
5. **Potential it might not be productive**. I'm someone that would rather handle something myself if it means saving the time & effort of explaining what I need done. What if I go through that whole song & dance & nothing happens? I can answer as many questions as I get & that might not change a person's behavior or mindset. If it's a stranger, idgaf. I almost certainly wouldn't let someone know so much about me (excluding anonymous reddit posts, of course.) If it's a friend or partner that would learn about my symptoms/history & not be understanding, that would suck big time.

\*\*\*(TLDR on that: a coworker was bullying me every day to the point where I'd emotional shut down. Nothing I did would stop her. My supervisor basically forced me to go to our manager, which I didn't want to do out of fear of the exact following scenario. I explained to our manager what my coworker was doing & how it was especially harmful because it was triggering my PTSD. She said I needed to disclose that before being hired for the job (which is not true.) My job was nothing high-stakes like EMS, working with harmful chemicals, or being a pilot. Out of caution, I won't name the job or even the field. But just know nothing dangerous occurred while I was working, it was a minimum wage job, & I even privately thought my company needed to have higher workplace safety standards. Yes, I know what happened to me was illegal. No, I didn't pursue the case legally because I didn't have the mental ""spoons"" or money & the best case scenario is I'd get my job at a toxic workplace back.)



Side note: I think the con's list being lengthier than the pro's is just due to context needing to be given. Definitely not that I've already made up my mind. I would love to be wholly open & authentically me. That's just dangerous sometimes. 



So...would you want to know if a new friend has multiple personalities? Or I guess multiple identities. Would it be enough for you personally to hear that someone has amnesia? Or would you want to know about the person's system? Would you honestly want to be friends with someone that has this disorder? As much as it might suck for me (& be possibly ableist on their end,) I can understand not wanting to be friends with someone with mental/emotional baggage. (I always ask if now is a good time for emotional support, give trigger warnings, & don't often need emotional support beyond me being like ""omg, this big bitch at work did xyz today."" But things far more intense than what a person without serious trauma is used to do come up. I get not being in a place to take that on, even tangentially & would never fault someone for that. (I would fault someone for not wanting to be friends with neurodivergent/mentally ill folks, but that's a different story entirely.)  


Besides amnesia, another challenging symptom is managing a variety of thoughts/emotions/opinions. Not all my alters like the small circle of friends I do have. It hasn't been without reason. Some are more alert to red flags & would rather cut things off immediately rather than give a second chance. They also don't have that attachment to the sunk cost fallacy I do of ""well, I've been friends with them for \[however many\] years."" The particular alter I'm thinking of also just does or says whatever he's feeling. He's gotten a lot better at it over the years, but when he came into existence, it was almost like a kid asking a question they didn't know is inappropriate to loudly ask in a crowded area. Sometimes he still just says things without meaning to hurt people, just express himself, but feelings get hurt regardless. (It's been nothing serious. Just him being sassy/silly & the person he was being a little fierce with found it funny, but also hurtful.) Other alters just kinda heavily fuck with being on their lonesome. To them, it isn't lonesome. It's calm & controlled. All people scare them, or at least are seen as annoying. I don't think it's become an issue so far, but it obviously could result in plans cancelled or toes stepped on.  


As for a romantic partnership, I am planning on disclosing my diagnosis after establishing that this person is (more likely than not) safe & interested in a long-term relationship. Friendship can range in closeness but being in a relationship is inherently more intimate. It would feel wrong to me personally to keep such a major part of me from someone. How would you personally want someone to tell you? Do you think I should do this in a private setting or somewhere public? Definitely worried about being attacked physically, so I think I'd feel safer possibly giving the person ammunition in a place where people could step in or call the police, but also somewhere that would give us relative privacy, i.e., uncrowded coffee shop or park bench. (I'm not trying to see people who attack me, but aren't we all? Maybe my mind will change once I get to know the person better, but if it doesn't, I just see this decision as respecting my trauma history.) I think it's also a neutral meeting spot so if either of us need to talk a walk or go home & come back to the conversation later, we can. But, if you were the other person, would it feel like you're being put on the spot? I could understand how this could make someone feel like, ""You don't trust me enough not to hurt you??"" But if it's a fairly new relationship, I'm not taking risks. I'd rather have really hurt someone's feelings than be hospitalized or worse.

  
Thank you for your insight in advance!

1mbvmd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/chronicfatigue/comments/1mbvmd1/finally_got_my_partners_bloods_back_and_i_feel/,Finally got my partners bloods back and I feel vindicated (good news),"I’ve been fighting for people to believe her for almost two years of our relationship, which constitutes quite a large portion (we’re coming up to three years this September). I’ve fought against my own family, against her family and against doctors. She finally got to see a chronic fatigue specialist who ordered a full blood panel.

She has extremely high levels of Covid 19 proteins still in her body, with her last infection being well over a year ago, along with a load of other serious abnormalities like high levels of histamine and copper, as well as abnormal results around the production of cortisol. 

I’ve been saying for the past two years that it was physiological. That there was something seriously wrong with her body and immune system. People in my life began to come around within the last year I’d say, but my dad didn’t really believe cfs wasn’t just a diagnosis of elimination until I started talking to him about the research into it. She had her own doubts about herself and believed it might just be all in her head. When I had any kind of doubts it was rare, but I would be really honest with her and we would work through it together. I always maintained that I believed she could have a better life, even if sometimes in private I worried it would never get better. 

There are good studies happening currently in our country around the treatment of long COVID that look really promising and the specialist she’s seeing is linked in with it all and will be able to provide any treatments that have good outcomes. There’s a real, genuine chance that she could get better.

I feel full of hope, and so does everyone right now in our life, including her. If she gets better, we would love to visit Japan together. She’s always wanted to go to Japan and I want to make that dream come true for her. We would also get married. I know three years isn’t a long time, but in those three years I have comforted her while grieving the death of a loved one, I have managed her severe dissociative episodes she used to have, I’ve helped her through autistic meltdowns and suicidal ideation, we’ve both been in hospital, she’s supported me through major surgery twice, I’ve been with her through both of us having Covid, I’ve supported her through her autism diagnosis and of course I’ve been with her throughout her illness, which we now believe to be long Covid. We’ve been through a lot together and I believe that has helped us to know one another better than most couples would over the course of three years. 

To any partners out here, have faith. They’re not making it up, it’s not all in their head, they really are trying and they really can’t help it. And there is the possibility of a better life together, even if their illness doesn’t go away. There’s all these little things in life to enjoy, even if it’s not the big things. I’d be content to spend the rest of our lives like this if it had to be this way, because I couldn’t bear to spend it with anyone but her. Yes, I wish we could go out for breakfast again and yes I wish she had the energy to do a one hour escape room and yes I wish we could go for walks together on the beach. But we find a way. Instead of going out for breakfast I’ll make her breakfast in bed. Instead of doing an escape room together we sit for a while at the coffee table and do a puzzle together. Instead of a walk we will sometimes go and sit in the garden and listen to the pond bubble and the sound of the birds. There is always joy to be found in life, even when everything seems bleak. 

I guess this post is more of a love letter than anything but I feel the need to shout into the void that I was right to believe her, I’m not naive and too trusting and overly romantic, I was right to have a heart and a soul and to love without knowing, to love with faith. I wasn’t being taken advantage of the way I was in the past by other people. I knew she was sick. I told them she was. Even when the world didn’t believe us we knew the truth. 

We are so full of hope. It’s a tentative hope, a fragile hope. But it’s there. We are only 23. We have so much of our lives to live together. I pray that I’m right to have hope. I pray that we will go to Japan.

1mbvlnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1mbvlnt/my_neighbor_calls_me_and_then_talks_my_ear_off/,My neighbor calls me and then talks my ear off,"My neighbor is a very nice person, but she will call me sometimes, essentially to complain about something going on in our building she's not happy with...and then continually steer into different topics in an almost stream-of-consciousness way. She nearly interrupts herself to switch topics, barely letting me get a word in. Most of her stories are positive and she's laughing. Some are about her current unemployed state, which makes me feel bad if I don't pick up. When I see her name on my phone, I dread answering because I know I'll be on for 40-60 minutes, mostly listening to her.

She called me this morning when I was just about to leave to meet my (elderly) father at the doctor. I ignored the call and she left a VM. I got to the doctor's office 40 minutes later and was waiting for my father to arrive when she called again. I picked up and said, ""Sorry I didn't call back, but I'm at the doctor with my father."" She said, ""Do you have just a minute?"" I did, as it happened, because I was early. But I thought, ""Isn't 'I'm at the doctor with my father' a clear signal that maybe now is not a good time? Besides, she left a VM with what it was about.

Then she called again this evening for a long conversation. My problem is, I am way too passive. I just don't know how to end the conversation. One time she stopped me in the hall at 6:30 am when I was carrying a heavy box from the mailroom to my apartment and started asking me a question. I was half asleep, no coffee, not yet showered, and cranky, so I said, ""Look, I can't talk right now. I need to get ready for work"" and she seemed hurt.

My friend told me my neighbor is clearly lonely, and I understand that, but my neighbor has mentioned to me that she has a psychiatrist, so isn't that what a therapist or psychiatrist is for? You talk to your neighbor but respect their time and then pay the therapist to listen.

Should I just interrupt her next time and risk hurting her feelings?

1mbvlae,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1mbvlae/i_21f_dont_know_whether_or_not_to_end_things_with/,I (21F) don’t know whether or not to end things with the guy I’m seeing (23M),"
I've (21F) been talking to this guy (23M) for four months now and things are getting serious. We have our ups and downs but when something happens I always feel we come out of it stronger. HOWEVER. I have doubts that are beginning to grow. I always make him breakfast and dinner when he's at my house, I always make him coffee, I always decide what we're going to do for the day or make the dinner plans. I've unfollowed every male on Instagram without him asking just so he could feel more secure. I spend sooo much money on him. He lives about an hour and a half away so I try to provide him with as much words of affirmation I can to make sure he’s again, secure. Maybe TMI but when we’re having sex he doesn’t ask me if I’ve finished or whatever, we just stop when he finishes. 
This is fine but it just adds up when I try to think about ways he's made me feel good or tried adapting to me. My mind is telling me we're doomed or he doesn't care? He started a new financial advising job today and was telling me all the advisors are females and his mentor is close in his age and very smart, I looked her up and she's really pretty. I literally had a meltdown like what? I HATE HOW THIS HAPPENS because when I first start talking to someone everything is fine, and chill, and great and then things get serious and it's like every little thing means the entire world. I'm not an insecure person, until it comes to a guy l'm into. I feel like I'm not evolving as a person talking to him, I certainly don't feel my best self, and I don't feel secure anymore.
(A few weeks ago I showed him my recently deleted in messages and jokingly asked to see his and he got really defensive, I never ended up seeing it but I did find out that he cheated on his ex with a girl he was on and off with for three years who he's apparently blocked since then) I feel delusional. Am I being dramatic ? ",1,1753744617.0,relationship_advice,4,0.67,False

I usually just read other people’s stories, but I guess now I’m the one looking for some outsider perspective but I don’t even know if I’m overthinking or just too in my head right now or maybe I’m just blowing this out of proportion Idk I’m a mess right now but anyways

I’m Julian, 21M, and my girlfriend Elena is 30F. Yes, I know the age gap’s a thing. 9 years, people always have something to say about it, but I’m a grown adult, alright and I get that it looks ""weird"" to some people, but it’s not like that. We’re in love, like, I can’t imagine my life without her. She’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me. We’ve been together for about a year, and she’s so amazing, always looking out for me when I was in a really bad spot.

I dropped out of community college last year cause I couldn’t handle classes and work, plus stuff at home was a total mess. My mom’s been struggling with drinking and mental health stuff since my dad died when I was a kid. I was stuck paying bills, keeping the house together, all that. It got so bad I had to crash with a friend, but that was rough too. Me and Elena met when I was working at a coffee shop a couple blocks from her office at this big graphic design company that does branding for huge clients. She’s a senior designer there, super talented, not running the place but she has a solid role. She’d come in most mornings for her usual black coffee, sometimes a latte if she was in a good mood. We started talking while I made her drinks, first about the music on the shop’s playlist: we both love indie bands like Tame Impala and Phoebe Bridgers.

Then we got into graphic design, cause I used to mess around with Photoshop and Illustrator, making posters for my friends’ bands just for fun when I was younger. She’d talk about her work, like designing logos or client presentations, and I thought she was so beautiful, way out of my league with a really nice smile and charming personality and so of course I’d get all nervous around her, but she was always so nice, never made me feel dumb for stumbling over my words. 

One day, she mentioned their team was short-staffed cause an office assistant quit, and they needed someone to handle stuff like emails, scheduling meetings, and organizing project files. I’d told her the coffee shop job sucked: It had bad pay and brutal hours. She asked if I’d ever thought about office work, and I was like, “Not really, but I’d try it.” She didn’t promise me anything, just said they were hiring and I should apply. I thought there was no way I’d get it, but I was desperate, so I sent my resume, got an interview, and somehow landed the job as a junior office assistant.

We kept talking at work, got super close, and a few months later, we started dating. When my friend’s lease ended and I had nowhere to go, she let me move into her apartment. She’s never made me feel like I owe her, and I’m so grateful. She’s always doing sweet stuff, like buying me gifts, shoes, watches, or picking out clothes she thinks I look good in and I trust her cause she’s got such good taste. It’s the first time I’ve felt very secure and at peace.

But last Friday, we had this big fight, and I’m still so upset, mostly at myself. Elena invited some friends over for dinner at her place, like 5 or 6 people. I’d only met one of them before, and I suck at meeting new people. My social anxiety’s bad, I get sweaty hands and can’t think of what to say. I didn’t wanna ruin the vibe, so I tried to act normal, laugh at their jokes, throw in a comment or two. I even wore this new t shirt she had picked out for me, thinking it’d help me fit in, but I still felt like I didn’t belong. They’re all her age, talking about their careers, marketing campaigns, stuff I don’t really get.

At one point, I tried to hold her hand on the table, cause I was freaking out inside and just wanted to feel close to her or maybe reassured and just needed simple cute contact but she brushed my hand off and pulled her hand away super fast and kept talking to her friend like nothing. I know it’s a small thing, but it did hurt me so bad and I felt like she was embarrassed of me or didn’t want them to know we’re together. I sat there the rest of dinner feeling dumb, stupid, awkward and so out of place.

After her friends left, we were cleaning up in the kitchen, and I told her I felt ignored and mentioned the hand thing. I wasn’t trying to pick a fight, I swear, just wanted her to understand how tough it was for me. But she got annoyed and said I was “making everything about me” and that I’m “always so awkward” around her friends and it's not her fault I lack social skills. I’ve told her about my social anxiety, and she’s usually so supportive, and she's even seen me work through it even, but this time it felt like she was throwing it in my face.

 I then asked why she pulled her hand away, and she said I was being “way too sensitive” and imagining stuff and that never happened. We started arguing louder, and yeah, I cried I was really frustrated. I hate fighting/or any sort of conflict with her. It genuinely makes me feel awful, and I felt so shut down. She said sorry later that night, but I couldn’t shake it. 

The next day, I grabbed some clothes and went to my mom’s to get some space. My mom’s trying to stay sober, but it’s a roller coaster, and being there’s not great she just watches TV all day, barely talks and sleeps, its a bit awkward every time we talk but it’s a familiar place to be I guess. She noticed I had been quiet and asked what’s up, so I told her most of it and why we fought. She already knew about me and Elena. She wasn’t happy about the age gap at first when I told her we were dating, with all the chaos in my life back then, but she got over it when she saw I wasn’t gonna break up with Elena just cause people don’t get it. I told her I love Elena, and I mean it so so much. I’m an adult, and this is my choice. She didn’t say much, but last night she said, “You gotta listen to your heart and pick what you really want, not what’s easy. What do you want?” I don’t even know how to answer that. I’m so confused right now.

It’s been a few days, and Elena’s been texting and calling, saying she’s sorry and wants to talk, but I haven’t replied. I don’t know if I’m being a jerk or just need space. I love her so much, but I hate feeling like I’m too much or not good enough for her.

I just found this r/ and it is the perfect place for my question. Over the last ten years I had a grind and brew with a thermal carafe, then switched to a Nespresso for the single serve convince, then to a De'Longhi True Brew for the best of both worlds. I really enjoy the coffee it makes, but the mess is horrid. It leaks internally and I am tired of the cleanup. The True Brew is a few years old and starting to make strange noises. I think it is time to move on. Looking for some recommendations.

Needs:

* Single serve grind and brew. Fresh grind = yum
* Easy cleanup
* $500, but I will spend up to $1k
* No milk required
* Simple preferred

* We’re here to blow up the myth that data and creativity are oil and water. This is a home for people who want their work to look great, move the needle, and grow the bottom line—no fluff, no hand-waving, just results.

# 2. Core Values

* **Evidence Over Ego:** We love wild ideas, but if you can’t back it up with numbers, it’s just noise.
* **Share, Don’t Showboat:** Drop your war stories, not your ego. Talk about what worked, what tanked, and what you learned.
* **Experiment Relentlessly:** If you’re not A/B testing, you’re not trying. Progress is messy, and we embrace the mess.
* **Respect the Craft:** Design, copy, data—none of it’s “just” anything. Respect every discipline.

# 3. What to Post

* **Case Studies:** Breakdowns of real campaigns—what moved the needle, what flopped, and why.
* **Data Dilemmas:** Got a hypothesis? Need help wrangling your analytics? Ask away.
* **Creative Experiments:** Share your wildest multivariate tests, and let us know if you found gold or just pyrite.
* **Tool Time:** Reviews or rants about the platforms, dashboards, and hacks you swear by (or at).
* **Ask Me Anything (AMA):** Invite specialists—growth hackers, designers, data scientists—for open Q&A.

# 4. What Not to Post

* **Vanity Metrics:** If you just want to brag about impressions, take it to LinkedIn.
* **Shameless Self-Promo:** We’re here to learn, not to buy your course.
* **Data Without Context:** Numbers alone are boring. Tell us what they mean.

# 5. How to Behave

* **Be Candid:** Share the ugly truth—marketing isn’t all unicorns and hockey-stick charts.
* **Stay Curious:** Assume you’re not the smartest in the room. Ask, listen, learn.
* **Credit the Team:** No one does this alone. Celebrate the analysts, the copywriters, and even the intern who made the coffee.

# 6. Community Rituals

* **Monthly “Show Your Work” Thread:** Share a campaign, a dashboard, or a creative test you ran (bonus points for failure).
* **Quarterly Tool Roundup:** Everyone dumps their best/worst tools, plugins, and dashboards.
* **Hall of Fame/Flame:** Celebrate the most effective—and most hilariously bad—experiments.

# 7. Why Bother?

Because if you want your work to matter, it needs to move both hearts and charts. This is the place for people who know you can’t optimize what you don’t measure, and you can’t inspire with spreadsheets alone.

There is a possibility that I will be offered a permanent position there. It would not be as a director. Just playing for one Mass. The last couple of weekends, a new singer (mid 30s? F) was brought in to cover along with me. She'd been filling in off and on for several months at other times but this was our first time working together. 

The first Sunday we met, she seemed a bit distant. Understandable, we're total strangers. Yesterday, when I arrived about half an hour before Mass, she was very conversational. I can't remember who spoke first, but we got to talking for about 15 minutes about our musical background, education, where we work and live now. She volunteered personal info about moving to the area (even specifying the area where she'd be living to make her commute to her day job easier). The conversation came naturally. 

Things went well and after the Mass, she complimented a piece of music I played, asking a question about its background. I asked her if she knew when she would be back, and she did not know when, if at all. I said I hoped to keep in touch and she replied ""Definitely."" 

Encouraged by the conversation, and not wanting to let a possible ""catch"" slip away, I sent her a short email later in the day, saying, ""It was great talking with you before Mass! I enjoyed our conversation about music and work backgrounds, and it would be great to stay in touch. Let me know if you'd be around for a coffee sometime. It would be nice to continue the conversation.""

She responded several hours later that she would be up for that and knows of a few places she can recommend, but is open to new ones also. Since she'll be moving, she asked me to contact her in a couple of weeks. 

Might my message to her have come across as platonic or vague? I wanted to politely hint my interest but not be too blatant about it given our church environment. I replied to her and said I'd be in touch in a couple of weeks and ""Look forward to seeing you."" I'm just not sure if she knows my interest is partly romantic.

I never talked back to you, I never swore infront of you, I never talked had about you to my friends, I never thought twice about disobeying you, I never argued when I got an unfair punishment...and I NEVER stopped loving you...my hate for you just grew more and more but I never stopped loving you. When you drank you'd always give me speeches about how I can always come to you when I need someone, but once you sobered up and I REALLY needed you, you didn't want anything to do with me ""You're not a baby, get your shit together"" you'd say. 
If I came to you crying you'd say ""You're never going to make it through life if you cry"" you'd say... Taking away my ability of crying. 
Everytime I'm hurt and emotionally in pain I think back to your words and my tears get stuck inside, building and building up. When you found out that I SelfH you didn't do anything...and yeah I didn't expect you to do anything but I didn't think that you'd have NO reaction towards it. You never taught me how to deal with bullies at school so I dealt with them through physical fighting them cause that's the only way I knew. And still I got into trouble. 
You only phone me when you need me to do something and when I need you and I call you, you always awnser with ""What the fuck now?"" When I want to give you a hug you say ""Not now I'm busy"" even if you're not. 
When I say I love you, you rarely say it back. 
You never forget to emotionally break me down atleast once a day. I walk on eggshells around you. I remember when I was younger I use to wish I had my friends dads, their dads would take them to restaurants, play board games with them, tell jokes and all that. 
I don't wish for a different dad, I appreciate you, I just wish that you could be different sometimes...you never support my dreams, when I had sport you never show up, when I had public speaking you never watched, and still complained about having to drop me off. 
When I won you would even congratulate me. You'd just listen and walk away....
When I try to tell you a story your attention is always elsewhere, mainly by my other siblings. 
When I make a small mistake you scream at me and it hurts me emotionally. Sometimes when you get really mad I get scared because I never know what you're going to scream next. 
If I clean and there's one thing out of place you yell and say how useless I am..
When I think into the future and I think about when I get a husband, I just pray he's nothing like you, they say daughters tend to marry guys that remind them of their fathers, and if that is the case then I'd rather stay single for the rest of my life. When I look back at baby pictures and see you holding me, smiling, and I think to myself, I must have been wanted at some point. 

Mom: Mom I'll always love you, you know me well, but sometimes you hurt me alot, aswell. When you're in a bad mood and you take it out on me. It hurts, it's unfair because I always stick up for you. I always protect you when dad get argumentative with you. And I always get between you and dad when it looks like he wants to get physical. You don't always have time for me, and it feels like my younger sister is your favourite between me and her, but I will always feel responsible for protecting you against the world. 
You break my down and you make me feel unloved yes, but I will never be able to hate the person who carried me for 9 months, even if you don't really support me.",3,1753744304.0,Letters_Unsent,0,1.0,False
