1kwhwrw,https://www.reddit.com/r/edgeSteps/comments/1kwhwrw/could_ordering_a_new_latte_be_so_eyeopening/,Could ordering a new latte be so... eye-opening?,"So, the other day I decided to step outside my usual comfort zone routine and order a totally different coffee at my go-to cafe. I always get the same boring vanilla latte, but this time I thought, hey, let's get adventurous and try the pumpkin spice. Yeah, I know, basic, right? 😂

Anyway, I was kinda excited but also a bit nervous... who knew picking a drink could be so intense? When I finally took the plunge, let's just say it was not what I imagined. The flavor was waaay sweeter than expected and honestly, I didn’t even finish it. Fail, right?

But here's what surprised me—trying something new made me realize I've been in a bubble of sameness for too long. Even if it was just a drink, it shook up my routine, if only for a moment. I guess it showed me how small changes can push you to see things differently, and it encouraged me to keep trying new stuff, even if it's just a beverage. Baby steps, y'know?

Anyone else ever have a strange, unexpected epiphany from something so small? I'd love to hear your stories. 😊",1,1748333716.0,edgeSteps,0,1.0,False

For twenty-five years, I was the quiet wife and the selfless mother—ironing shirts, folding laundry, and waiting for the day my husband, Bradley, would finally keep the promise he made when we married.

“We never had a wedding,” I reminded him on our twenty-fifth anniversary. “Just papers at city hall. I thought maybe… this year, we could take a cruise. Just the two of us.”

He laughed—sharp and cold.

“A cruise? At your age? Don’t be ridiculous. You should be more like your cousin Maine. She’s smart. Independent. She doesn’t need anyone to fund her silly dreams.”

Maine. My cousin. The woman he once loved. The woman he said wasn’t right for marriage—until now.

That night, I saw it. An email in his inbox. A cruise reservation. A wedding invitation. Maine and my husband.

The invitees? My son. My daughter-in-law. My father.

They all knew. They replaced me.

And they lied—calling it a business trip, saying I wouldn’t understand. That I wasn’t smart enough to be part of it.

So I smiled. I watched them leave in the clothes I had packed for them. Then I changed the locks, blocked their numbers, and filed for divorce.

They didn’t choose me. But this time—I choose myself.

Because after twenty-five years of being silenced, overlooked, and invisible… I’m finally ready to live out loud.



For twenty-five years, I served my husband and my son, forgetting and sacrificing myself. And now on our twenty-fifth anniversary, I thought maybe it was time for me. So, I asked my husband Bradley to fulfill his promise.

""Do you remember what you promised me when we got married?"" He didn’t lift his head from his phone. ""We never had a wedding, just signed the papers at city hall, and then… life got busy. But this year—it’s our twenty-fifth. I thought maybe… we could go on a cruise. Just the two of us.""

He looked at me like I had said something offensive.

""A cruise?"" he barked, his eyes narrowing. Then he laughed—sharp and cold. ""What for? You're old enough to know better. Cruises aren't for women like you. You don't even have your own money, Joyce. You want to use my money for some stupid luxury when you know the company’s barely holding on because of investor pullouts? Do you even care about me? About what I'm going through?""

His words didn’t shout, but they cut.

""I just..."" I whispered, ""I just want to enjoy something. Anything. For twenty-five years, I stayed here. You promised me a wedding back then. Maybe this could be the time—""

He cut me off, loud and sharp now.

""Enjoy?"" he scoffed. ""Are you saying you didn’t enjoy your life for the past twenty-five years? Are you blaming me for how boring it was? You sound ungrateful, Joyce. I worked so hard, and you just stayed here—cleaning, eating, no real stress. Maybe you should be more like your cousin Maine. Now that’s a woman. Smart, successful. Doesn’t rely on anyone for her stupid whims.""

My hands were trembling. The glass of water I held slipped and shattered at my feet. I flinched as the shards scattered.

That sound summoned my father, Joseph, from the other room.

""What's wrong with you?"" he growled, storming in. ""Are you really this useless? You can’t even hold a glass? You know how much that costs? You can’t even pay for your own food, and now you're breaking things?""

I didn’t say anything. I couldn’t.

""You’re the same age as Maine, yet she looks ten years younger. She walks like a woman with purpose. You? You drag your feet like you’re already dead. Honestly, sometimes I wish Maine was my daughter instead of you.""

Bradley chuckled awkwardly. ""Don’t be too harsh on her, Father. Come on. She’s still your daughter.”

Then he turned to me.

""And you, Joyce, don’t take it seriously. We just want you to… improve. Be more like Maine, maybe.""

But my father wasn’t done.

""Improve?"" he spat. ""There’s no improving her. You said it yourself once, Bradley. You regretted marrying young. You said Maine was the better candidate. And I agreed. But you still married my daughter. And she should be grateful for that every day of her life.""

I stood still. Cold. Paralyzed. A tightness wrapped itself around my ribs, squeezing.

I bent down to pick up the shattered glass, but my hands were shaking too much. A sharp edge sliced into my palm, but I didn’t flinch. I watched the blood trail down my wrist, felt it drip onto the tiles.

No one stopped me. They just kept talking. Laughing. Like I wasn’t there.

Bradley’s voice returned, distant and cruel. “Well, Maine is admirable, but Joyce... Joyce is convenient.”

Convenient. Like plastic furniture. Like disposable napkins.

I didn’t speak. What was left to say?

I gathered the broken pieces with both hands now, ignoring the pain. Blood smeared across my fingers. No one offered a towel. No one asked if I was okay.

I went to the sink, turned on the water. It ran red before it ran clear. I stared at my reflection in the kitchen window. Who is she? This tired woman. This fading thing.

Later on, they all went to eat dinner and like a servant, I placed the bowls on the table, one by one. I’d made soup just like what Bradley wanted to eat for tonight.

He took one sip and spat it back in the bowl. ""What's this? It tastes like garbage.""

Chapter 2 

I blinked. My hands trembled as I held the serving spoon.

“I—I’ll change the soup,” I said softly, already reaching for the bowl.

Bradley slammed his spoon down. “Come on, Joyce. If you’re still mad at me because of what I said earlier, this isn’t the right way to take it out. Trying to poison me with that taste? You didn’t even make an effort. That’s your only job.”

Only job. That phrase stayed in the air, louder than his voice.

To them, that’s all it was. Cooking. Cleaning. Washing. Being their shadow. It didn’t matter that I was the first to rise in this house and the last to sleep. It didn’t matter that I raised our son when Bradley worked late or went on “business trips.” I was a housewife, and for them, that meant I wasn’t really contributing. I wasn’t building an empire. I wasn’t earning figures. I was just a woman who washed clothes and waited for orders.

I used to think being here was fulfilling. That staying behind to raise a family and tend to a home was noble. But what did I really raise? A son too busy to visit. A husband who looked at me like I was a liability. A father who never saw me beyond the girl who didn’t measure up to Maine.

And maybe that was the real sin—I let it happen. I chose this life. I allowed myself to disappear in it.

Tears welled up, blurring the sight of the table. My voice cracked as I whispered, “I’ll make a new batch.”

The door suddenly swung open. Click. High heels. A familiar voice. 

“Oh! Sorry, did I interrupt something?”

Maine. Of course. Even the sound of her walking in felt expensive. She wore success like a perfume. Confident. Composed. A woman people admired. The daughter my father always wished he had.

“I just came by to drop off some business files,” she said, flashing that smile of hers. “So we can settle things.”

My father stood immediately, like he was summoned. “No, not really. We’re just having dinner.”

Maine’s eyes darted toward the table. “Oh, great. Then, can I eat some? I’m sure it’s amazing. After all, my cousin Joyce cooked it.”

Bradley scoffed. “It’s not, actually. Tastes like nothing. Not a great idea, really.” He pushed the bowl away with a dramatic grimace. “How about we all just go out? Let’s eat somewhere decent. My treat.”

I looked down at my hands. They were still stained with onion from chopping. They reeked of oil.

“Oh, sure,” Maine said brightly. “That sounds fun.”

Father nodded in agreement. “I’ve been craving that grilled seafood place.”

Then Maine turned to me. “Joyce, you’re coming, right?”

I lifted my head, just as Bradley answered for me. “Oh, she’s busy,” he said with a wave of his hand. “She’s got house things to do. She can eat this one, so it won’t go to waste, right? And she’s not into these things anyway. We’re going to talk about business stuff—nothing she’d be interested in.”

Nothing I’d be interested in. As if I didn’t want to leave this house even once. As if I didn’t want to eat something warm and served to me instead of cold leftovers.

Maine hesitated, but then smiled again. “Okay then. I’ll just bring you some food from the restaurant, cousin. Something nice, alright?”

They left in laughter. They didn’t even say goodbye.

I stood there. Alone in a dining room that smelled of disappointment and burnt soup.

I sat down and tasted the very same bowl Bradley spat in. It was bland. Too much water, too little salt. I messed up. But not because I wanted to hurt him. I just... I just couldn’t taste anything anymore.

I looked around the house I spent twenty-five years serving. The walls I repainted myself. The furniture I cleaned. The floors I mopped on my knees. The clothes I ironed. The birthdays I planned. The Christmases I decorated.

And yet I wasn’t a wife. I wasn’t a partner.

I was their help.

Their convenience.

And that realization hurt more than anything.

I forced myself to finish the soup. I cleaned the table. I washed the dishes. I wiped the counter.

I folded the napkins like I always did. Then I went upstairs and sat on the edge of the bed we used to share, the one that now felt too wide, too cold.

I pressed my hand to my chest and whispered, “I chose this.”

I let them shape me into what they wanted.

I let myself disappear. But maybe—just maybe—I didn’t have to stay this way.

Maybe I could still find pieces of who I used to be.

Before I became invisible. And as the sound of their laughter echoed from the driveway, I finally allowed myself to cry—loud and unashamed—for the woman I once was, and the woman I might still be.

Chapter 3

I quietly rolled out of bed and walked straight to the cabinet in the corner of our room—my little sanctuary. It was where I kept the few things that were mine. Not the house, not the kitchen, not the endless chores or errands I did for the family—but the small luxuries I saved up for with my own money.

The makeup I had finally bought last week after five long years of selling flowers from my garden was gone.

My heart skipped. I opened and closed every drawer, checked the boxes twice. Gone. All of it.

I rushed into the living room where Bradley sat on the couch, his eyes glued to the documents in his hands, probably something about the company again. 

“Bradley,” I said as calmly as I could, “Did you see the makeup I kept in the cabinet?”

He didn’t even look up. “Ah, those? I gave them to Maine. She sealed that big deal with the Japanese investors, thought she deserved something nice.”

My breath caught. “You… gave them to her?” My voice shook. “That was mine. I just bought that.”

He finally looked up, chuckling like it was some sort of joke. “Bought it? Joyce, come on. Why would you buy makeup? It’s not like you’re going anywhere. You’re too old for those things.”

“Bradley—”

“No, really.” He smirked. “Have you looked in the mirror lately? Be honest with yourself. It doesn’t suit you anymore. But Maine? Now she’s different. She works hard, she deserves it.”

“It was mine!” I yelled, my hands trembling. “I bought it with my own money!”

He rolled his eyes. “Own money? What are you talking about? All the money you use comes from me, Joyce. Don’t pretend otherwise.”

My lips parted, but the words couldn’t come out. In my heart, I screamed. It was from the flowers I sold. I tended that garden with blistered hands and sunburned skin. I saved every dollar, every coin for five years.

Not once did I ask him for a cent for anything that wasn’t for the house or the family. I knew he’d see it as a burden. So I didn’t. I waited. I worked. And now it was gone—given to someone else as if I didn’t matter.

He leaned back with a sigh. “Stop whining. I’ll just get you something else, okay?”

“You really don’t care about me,” I whispered.

Bradley frowned. “You’re being dramatic. Come on, be considerate for once. Maine practically saved the company, Joyce. She deserves some appreciation. You wouldn’t understand—you don’t know a thing about business. So stop overreacting and start cooking. I’m starving.”

His voice stung like a slap.

I turned to walk away, feeling like my chest was about to shatter into a thousand pieces.

“By the way,” he added lazily, “I’ll be gone. Business trip. One week. So you can take a little break from taking care of me.”

I said nothing and walked into the kitchen. I cooked. Again. Just like always.

Later that afternoon, our son arrived with his wife. I smiled automatically, like I was supposed to. Like a painting that no one bothered to repaint.

While eating, they talked excitedly about the upcoming trip.

“It’s gonna be beautiful,” my daughter-in-law said. “A cruise ship. Top deck. Fancy dinners. Hot springs. Can’t wait!”

“I thought it was a business trip,” I murmured.

“Oh, well, business and pleasure,” my son added quickly. “Don’t worry, Mom. We’ll take home something nice for you. A souvenir or two!”

“A magnet would be nice,” I joked weakly. My laughter came out hollow.

My father, sitting beside me, shook his head. “If only you knew more about business, you could join.”

I nodded and smiled again. Pretending didn't even hurt anymore—it was just numb.

That night, I was folding Bradley’s clothes for the trip. His laptop, still open, buzzed softly with a notification.

I glanced. Then froze.

The screen showed an email confirmation for the cruise. A luxury getaway package. Couples’ massages. Candlelight dinners. Honeymoon suite.

I blinked. Honeymoon?

I opened the attached documents with a trembling hand. An invitation.

A wedding invitation.

Maine. And Bradley.

My knees buckled. I dropped into the chair, hands shaking as the names on the glossy page glared back at me.

Maine and Bradley. You are cordially invited to celebrate our union aboard the St. Clarisse Luxury 

It wasn’t just a trip. It was a betrayal. It was a celebration. Everyone knew. My son. My father. The people I cooked for, cleaned for, cared for. The people I stayed behind for.

And none of them said a word.

My vision blurred as tears spilled freely. Not because of the makeup. Not because of the trip.

But because I gave them my life. My time. My love. My everything.

And it meant nothing.

I covered my mouth and wept silently in the dark, while outside the house, laughter echoed down the halls as the people I loved planned their future—without me.

Chapter 4 

""Joyce,"" he said once, voice low and intimate, his arm lazily wrapped around my shoulder, ""I know you’d take care of me better than anyone, even Maine. I love her, yes, I want her, but she’d choose her career over me any day. You—Joyce, you’re the type who’d serve, who’d stay. And for that, I’ll give you the best life you could imagine.""

I believed him. Like a fool, I believed him. I let him register our marriage. No ceremony. No friends. No flowers. Just two signatures on cold, government-issued paper and a promise I etched into my heart like scripture. I was in love. So painfully in love. But now I see it—he never chose me. I was never the first. I was the fallback. The safe place to land when Maine took off for her ambitions.

And now? I was just… the maid who shared his last name.

The next day, not a single soul in the house asked if I had slept well. No one noticed my red-rimmed eyes or the tremble in my hands as I poured coffee. Instead, the living room buzzed with laughter and shallow excitement. 

The scent of fresh fabric filled the air as designer bags lay scattered over the couch. I stood silently, hands clasped together, watching them marvel over their outfits like it was the most important day of their lives.

My son turned to me, grinning wide. “Mom, guess what? We’re attending a wedding on the cruise, aside from the business trip or course! Isn’t that amazing? It’s gonna be such a big event!”

I blinked, pretending not to know whose wedding it would be. “A wedding?”

Maine was standing near him, holding up a white dress against her body, checking herself in the hallway mirror.

I frowned, curious. “Who’s getting married? Why can’t I come with you?”

My father scoffed as if I’d asked something ridiculous. “You’re staying here to take care of the house, of course. And since when are you interested in these things? It’s someone from Bradley’s business circle, nothing related to you.”

I forced a smile. A pathetic little curve of my lips. “Of course.”

“Don’t worry, Mom,” my son added, chuckling, “We’ll bring back lots of souvenirs. I know you love those herbal oils from duty-free.”

Maine giggled behind him, and said, ""We'll just send photos, so you will be updated.""

My chest tightened.

Bradley, appearing from the hallway in a tailored shirt, tossed a pile of clothes into my arms. “Here. Iron these. And be careful—they’re expensive.”

The morning of their departure, the house was loud with perfume, zipped luggages, and last-minute instructions. I stood in the corner, quietly folding last-minute scarves, fixing collars, adjusting buttons. My role was clear: the background woman. Invisible until something went wrong.

A shriek from the hallway. “My dress!” Maine cried out. “There’s a hole in it!”

Everyone rushed in. The white dress—elegant, pristine, absurdly expensive—had a tiny tear near the hem. But it was enough to ruin her morning.

Bradley turned, eyes blazing. “Joyce! What the heck did you do?”

“I—I didn’t do anything. I sent it to the shop, just like the others. They must’ve—”

“I told you to handle it, not strangers! Why would you let someone else touch her dress? Are you going to pay for this?!”

“I— I didn’t mean—”

“It’s fine,” Maine said gently, stepping in like a peacekeeper. “Don’t be mad at her. She’s your wife.”

Bradley scoffed. “Yeah. My useless wife.”

He turned away from me without another glance, wrapping an arm around Maine’s shoulder. “Let’s go get you another one. We’ll be late if we don’t leave now.”

He threw the dress at me. I stood frozen. As they gathered their luggage, laughing and chatting about the events on the cruise, I stared at the empty doorway. They didn’t even look back. Not one.

Chapter 5 

Maine: Joyce, I’m sorry. The shop already apologized. You shouldn’t have been blamed for the dress. Please don’t think too much about it.”

I read it once. Then twice. Did she mean it? Or was it just a bandage for a wound she helped create? A soft message to wash away the image of Bradley shoving me, of everyone turning their backs while I stood in shock, humiliated?

Before I could decide, another message arrived.

Bradley: I left the black card on the kitchen counter. Buy anything you want today since you’ll be alone for one week.

I nearly laughed.

This was how it always went with him. First the fury, the blame, the cruelty—and then, the guilt gift. The apology disguised as permission to spend his money. As if a new dress or a bag could undo the things he said. The things he did. I could almost hear his voice in my head: Here, buy yourself something. Now smile like a good girl.

I didn’t respond. I just stared at their names—Maine and Bradley—and in one swift, final movement, I deleted both messages and blocked their numbers.

Later that day, I decided to step outside. I put on the dress Bradley once said looked “too loud” and the lipstick he told me “made me look old.” I wore both. Proudly.

I had a little money stashed away—hidden savings he never cared to know about. I clutched my small bag and walked into the city like I had somewhere to be, even if it was just a place where I could breathe.

There was this café I had passed a hundred times before. Every time I hinted I wanted to try them, Bradley would shut it down.

“Cake? Again? You already look like you’ve had enough,” he’d say, always with that half-smirk, as if it were a joke I was supposed to laugh at.

But I’d seen him offer the same cake to Maine once, all sweet smiles and soft hands. I didn’t say a word back then. ",1,1748333705.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

Little background from me, I'm in the late 30s, have high-paying job, have a girlfriend(it's in the verge of our relationship), have a lot of friends but none actually keeping them in touch due to everyone is moving to their own phase of life. 4 years has passed, I haven't feel much happier. I feel the stagnation, I have zero momentum on the career ladder now, comparing back then I'm pretty aggressive, I can work all day long just to achieve things that I want. I lost interest of things I used to love to do, like my hobbies and my favorite games, I'm in a stressful and high-pace job environment, whenever there is a pause or an idle time, i get burnouts and random surge of sadness. The only soacial activities I have is to entertain my customers, other than that I'm pretty much working all day long. I am deleting all the social media apps. There are good achievement in my life where I supposed to feel thrilled (e.g. getting promotion, profiting from stock market), I feel completely numb and nothing. Sometimes I find those who can laugh spontaneously, seeing that, i felt a deep resonance within me.

  
have been listening to a lot of podcast for self improvement. Doesnt help much. I remembered once a Oldman told me this, do you enjoy the coffee you drink this morning? Try to appreciate it.

It was one of those generic articles but something clicked for me. Like, I've always chased this idea of self-care and inner peace as something exotic or transformative. But then it hit me, maybe it's right here in the simple routines we overlook every day, like making coffee. 

As I sipped my first cup, I started thinking that self-care doesn't have to be fancy retreats or expensive spa days. It can be as simple as enjoying the quiet moments in the morning before the world gets busy or taking the time to appreciate the small joys like a warm cup of coffee. 

It's funny how an everyday morning ritual can become a moment of peace if you let it. Idk, I think I needed that reminder that self-care can be found in the most ordinary places.",1,1748333476.0,snapinsight,0,1.0,False
1kwhufb,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalminimalism/comments/1kwhufb/i_did_a_30day_digital_detox_and_realised_ive_been/,I did a 30-day digital detox and realised I've been addicted to my phone since my teens,"Inspired by Cal Newport's digital minimalism, I did a month long digital detox. My scree**n**time habits were awful. I would wake up and scroll immediately. If I was in a queue at a shop I would scroll. I could be talking to my partner and start scrolling. Something needed to change. Here's some of the things I noticed.

**A lot of it is unconscious.** The reflexive phone grabbing was genuinely disturbing. I would be working away on my laptop and next thing I know my phone is in front of me with a twitter feed open. No conscious thought involved. Or I'd want to tell my girlfriend something and reach for my phone to text her... when she's sitting in the next room. We live together. I could just walk over and talk to her like a normal human. Or I'd find myself endlessly opening slack looking for a dopamine hit.

**Mornings were unreal.** When you're not doomscrolling in bed, it turns out you can get an insane amount done before work. 7:30 wake up, and by 8am I'd showered, shaved, made coffee, done dishes, sorted my budget for the week. When you're constantly held down by your phone it's like wading through mud. Every simple task takes 10x longer. 

**It made sports feel very different.** My team had a slew of huge games that month. Normally I'd be online soaking up all the build-up, player stats, conspiracy theories about the ref's family history, etc. Or if there was a controversial ref decision and I couldn't check reddit or twitter to see if people agreed with me. That urge to validate my reactions through the internet was stronger than I expected. It was genuinely tough. But I found myself talking to colleagues, friends and family about games a lot more to compensate. And if we lost I just got over the game normally, instead of stewing on social media. 

**Work performance went through the roof**. My job is target-based and I absolutely smashed my numbers. Turns out when you're not constantly switching from Twitter to TikTok to Youtube you can actually do your job well. But on the flip side I also realised how mind-numbingly boring my job is without podcasts and social media to get me through it. 

**Sleep became incredible.** Asleep by 11, up at 7:30 most days. My brain was running at such a slower pace settling down for bed at 10 just felt natural. I'd read a few pages and fall asleep within about 15 mins. 

**Started reading more.**  I read about 3 books in a month. I normally read but when I had proper downtime or wanted to enjoy a weekend morning, I'd read with a cup of coffee or tea. 

**Appreciated Music again.** I'd mostly stopped listening to music during the detox, and the last day of the month I went to a live concert. Once I stopped constantly listening to music all day everyday, I came to appreciate it again. Beforehand I would be constantly shuffling between my spotify playlists never satisfied.

**Tried random hobbies** one weekend I noticed by kitchen knife was really blunt. I walked to a cooking shop and bought. whetstone. I watched two YouTube tutorials on how to use it, then spent hours sharpening my knife. Reminded me how fun learning random little skills can be and how the internet should aid that not take you away from it. 

**Present with people.** Conversations with my girlfriend felt more present. Because I wasn't being so stimulated all the time, I remembered that conversations with human beings are supposed to be stimulating in themselves. The weekends weirdly felt longer. Like time was more of a blank canvas for me to add things to rather than something that just passed by on autopilot. 

**Started feeling out of the loop with humour.** So much humor with friends and colleagues is based around current reels and TikToks. They'd be making jokes all day that would go straight over my head. A week prior to my detox I'd be getting it. One week later I'm lost. Crazy how quickly it moves. 

**It's not a cure all.**  it takes things away but doesn't automatically fill the void. I had to actively push myself the following month to sign up for sports classes and actually prioritize leisure time with active pursuits like I wanted to do during my detox. The detox creates space and allows you to take stock of your situation and reprioritise, but you still have to choose what to put in it.

**I feel like a calmer, more normal human.** And you really notice other people's phone habits now. The constant checking, the mid-conversation scrolling. It's everywhere once you step outside it.

**It gets boring then it gets fun.** To give an example, before I could never commit to a Netflix series. Or when selecting a film to watch with my partner I had to make sure it was super highly rated or my attention span wouldn't let met sit still. A few days into the detox I could sit through an entire 1 hour episode with my partner and want to watch the next episode (one of my rules was I was allowed to watch Netflix provided it was with my partner after work and not mindlessly on my own). It was the same with films, even films that aren't great are still stimulating. By making day to day life less stimulating you open yourself up the things you previously thought were boring. It's like quitting sugar then realising how sweet cherrys and apples can be. 

**A Month Later.** I still haven't touched Twitter, TikTok, or Instagram reels specifically. There is some trepidation there that if I go back I will slip back. I realised that they aren't that fun compared to real life and it's not how I want to spend my time. But at the same time I know they could suck me back in. I still think there could be value in maybe having one day a week where you use those platforms like Cal Newport suggests. Candidly I have discovered great music, places to visit, places to eat, and picked up new interests through those platforms so I know there's value there, but I still need to work out how I'll go about it. 

**Big picture takeaway and regrets.** After the detox I did feel a tinge of sadness. I enjoyed it so much. But I realised properly that I had been addicted to the internet and my phone since I was a teenager. Not just in a ""oh I use my phone a lot"" way but in a compulsive and unconscious way. I thought back to my life. The skills I could have learnt, places I could have gone to, experiences I could have had. I did an extremely interesting degree and a great university, but I never really engaged with the material. The whole time I've had access to much easier and exciting hits of dopamine. 

Overall, I felt quite dumb. I'd always saw myself as quite a switched on guy but the realisation that I spent such a huge amount of my limited time on earth staring at a screen because tech companies got me with a simple chemical trick was disheartening. I thought of smoking addicts in the 1950s or fast food addicts in recent times, and realised I was no different. The environment was designed in such a way that my basic operating system was overloaded and didn't have a chance. I'm in my late 20s and I think lots of people my age probably feel similar. We came of age at a time where tech hit such a zenith but there was no precedence in place to know how to deal with it and we were caught hook line and sinker. I think that was the main value of the detox, to take a step back and divorce yourself from the system as much as possible and see it for what it is.

**TL;DR: Did a month-long digital detox inspired by Cal Newport. Discovered my phone habits were genuinely addictive and unconscious - I'd reflexively grab my phone mid-conversation or text my girlfriend when she was in the next room. Results: Morning productivity skyrocketed, work performance through the roof, sleep became incredible, started reading 3 books/month, conversations felt more present. Downsides: Felt out of the loop with friends' meme references, realised how boring my job actually is without distractions. A month later, still too anxious to touch Twitter/TikTok/Instagram reels. Biggest realization: I've been genuinely addicted since my teens and feel sad about all the lost potential and skills I could've learned, experiences I missed while staring at screens. The detox creates space but you have to actively choose what to fill it with. Overall feel like a calmer, more normal human who can actually appreciate simple pleasures again.**",1,1748333433.0,digitalminimalism,0,1.0,False

Unraveled the story to its last secret","After sending the message, my fingers shook so badly I almost dropped the phone. Inside the room, their conversation kept going. “Is this fair to Briar?” Gladys’s voice trembled, laced with a rare hint of guilt. “If it weren’t for the unborn baby, she might’ve ended it all. Watching her so lost, barely eating and living—it’s heartbreaking.” Elliot signed, as though the weight of his lies was finally pressing down. “But Carmilla’s only got six months left,” he said, voice tight. “It’s her last wish, Mom. I can’t just walk away.” “And Briar?” Gladys pushed. “She’s carrying your child.” “I’ll make it up to her in the future.” he said. “ Don’t worry,mom.” My heart felt like it was being crushed, the pain instantly radiating through my entire body until I could barely breathe. I stumbled back to my bedroom, knees buckling beneath me as I crumpled onto the floor. My phone vibrated. Conor. “What’s going on, Briar? Is everything okay? Elliot’s… he’s dead, right?” I opened my mouth to speak, but the words wouldn’t come. Instead, tears poured down, hot and blinding. The world knew Elliot Sterling was dead. But I knew better. I understood Conor's confusion. Even I couldn't have imagined Elliot would fake his death, let alone that he'd do it for another bitch. Though I said nothing, my brother seemed to sense my emotional state. After a long pause, he spoke softly. ""The day after tomorrow evening. I'll send a plane to pick you up then.I’ll take care of everything else."" After hanging up, I remained frozen in position, still holding the phone. Just then, a gentle knock came at the door. Standing outside was Elliot's ""older brother"" Or rather, Elliot Sterling himself—holding a glass of warm milk. ""Hey, Briar, what’s going on? Why are you sitting on the floor like that? Have you been crying? You... you must be missing Elliot, huh?"" During the weeks since Elliot had returned as his supposed brother, he'd been incredibly kind to me, seemingly treating me as his deceased brother's widow. Countless times when facing his concern, I'd felt lost my mind.Gladys always attributed this o grief over losing Elliot. I discreetly locked my phone screen and forced a smile. ""It's nothing.The baby kicked me and I lost my balance for a moment."" Elliot visibly relaxed, setting down the milk before carefully helping me up from the floor. ""That little troublemaker.Wait until he's born—his uncle will teach him."" ""Come on.Here some milk for you. Drink it and take a break. Elliot wouldn't hope for this situation."" Hearing him mention his own name, I finally couldn't hold back anymore. I looked directly into his eyes and deliberately asked ""Tell me the truth. Are you Elliot Sterling"" Chapter 2 Elliot froze for a moment, then laughed softly as he gently brushed my hair. “Briar, you’re exhausted,” he said, his tone dripping with fake concern. “Why would you think I’m Elliot? That’s crazy.” ""Tomorrow’s your prenatal checkup. I’ll take you. You need rest.That's my brother's only bloodline in the world. I'm going to make damn sure that baby arrives safely."" I lowered my eyes, unable to stomach the fake concern in his gaze. ""Just go. I’m exhausted."" Only after the door clicked shut did the tears I'd been holding back all evening finally come flooding out. Elliot and I met at a college party.He fell for me at the freshman party.and pursued me. Two years after graduation, he gave me the most extravagant proposal. I still remember that night—the fireworks reflected in his eyes,but his eyes even more brighter than the fireworks. While planning our wedding, I discovered I was pregnant. Elliot had been overjoyed. “Perfect timing,” he whispered, pressing his forehead to mine. “Our baby came for celebrating our wedding. Briar, dear,I'm the happiest man alive right now.” I still can't wrap my head around it. Six years together, and he throws it all away,faking his own death just to bail on our wedding. Early the next morning, Elliot knocked on my door. “Briar?Time for your prenatal checkup. You ready?” But just as we were about to leave, Carmilla's voice called from behind us. “Elliot, baby, I’m not feeling well.Could you stay with me today?” At the sound of her voice, Elliot didn't even glance my way before rushing to her side. “What’s wrong, sweetheart? You should be resting.” Then he turned to me with a quick glance. “Sorry, Briar,my wife’s not feeling well. James will drive you to the hospital.” “James is outside, he’ll take you. I already called to Dr. Wilson. He's waitting for you. Just go straight over there.” I closed my eyes, trying to hold back the tears threatening to spill. When I opened them again, I didn't miss the fleeting look of satisfaction on Carmilla's face. Without a word, I nodded and walked out, closing the door behind me with a dull thud.My hand unconsciously stroked my belly as heavy tears finally fell. James got me to the hospital on time, and I completed all the scheduled tests. Elliot had previously instructed both the driver and doctor—if I didn't show up, he would become suspicious. I sat in the hospital waiting area, staring at the blurry ultrasound picture. Just a tiny blob on the grainy black-and-white image. The doctor had pointed at it, smiling ""See that? That's your little one."" But I couldn't bear my kid has a father who kept a side piece! I wiped my face with my sleeve and made a quick call to schedule an appointment at another hospital. This was the Sterling family's private hospital—if I had the procedure here, Elliot would definitely find out. I texted James: 'Just going to grab some coffee and take a walk. You can go ahead and leave.' Waiting until his black sedan pulled away,I hurried to the curb and went to another hospital. My phone buzzed just as I was signing the consent form for the abortion. A video message from an unknown number. The video was thirty minutes. In this video, Elliot did no-holds-barred sex which I'd never seen Elliot out of control like this. For six years, he had been Mr. Considerate in bed, and he worried that I would get hurt if he was too rough. Turns out he wasn't naturally restrained in bed. Who can meet his appetite is someone else. I forced myself watch the video, torturing myself with every second of seeing a side of Elliot I never knew. I don't know how long I sat there before a nurse approached me. ""Ms. Briar? Are you alright? It's time for your procedure."" Chapter 3 I couldn't stop crying as I watched the video, even my hand holding the phone couldn't stop shaking. The worst part? I still loved that bastard. Even after everything. I couldn't just delete him like a bad Instagram post.Six years. Six goddamn years. Loving Elliot was like breathing—it just came naturally, even now. Everyone always said Elliot was obsessed with me, but they never saw how I'd saved every movie ticket stub from our dates or how I'd memorized his coffee order by our third date. Six years together....and only now. Remembering the rapid little heartbeat I'd heard during the check, I wiped away my tears and took a deep breath.Give the last chance for my baby and Elliot. Then I called him. ""Elliot, can you come to the hospital? I… we need to talk."" His voice came through weirdly breathless. ""I'm kind of in the middle of something. Just Uber home and we'll talk there, okay?"" ""Oh god, Elliot, harder…"",with a soft moan the call disconnected, leaving just the dial tone. I'm not a kid, I knew exactly what he was doing. I looked up at the nurse hovering nearby. ""Well,let’s do it."" It was after dark when I got home. The second I stepped through the door,Elliot came striding toward me. ""James said you went around. What'd you buy?"" Then he clocked my puffy eyes. ""What’s wrong? Briar.Did you cry?what happened? About Elliot?Oh,The baby you're carrying belongs to Elliot,at least a comfort "" ""What was this thing you wanted to talk about me?"" I stared at his face—that perfect jawline, those eyes that still made my crazy. The same eyes I'd just watched in vedio from Carmilla. ""Never mind,” I said, forcing a weak smile. “Just checking if you needed anything."" He practically deflated with relief. ""You should get some rest,” he said, “You look… rough."" I just nodded and bolted for my bedroom. I fell asleep almost instantly, my dreams taking me back to college—freshman Elliot with his floppy hair and that vintage Nirvana t-shirt. ""Briar Collins, I've had a crush on you since day one. Will you date with me?"" ""Don’t worry, I’ll treat you right."" Maybe it was the golden sunset making everything magical, or maybe it was the sincerity in his eyes that I couldn't resist. Somehow, I ended up saying yes. I woke up to sunlight streaming through the blinds. First decent night's sleep I'd had since learning of his ""death."" I was still sitting dazed in bed when my door was opened and Carmilla came in. ""Wanna know why I sent that video? Still think Elliot’s some doting brother and I’m just your sister-in-law?"" ",1,1748333352.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

Unraveled the story to its last secret","My husband, Eric, was on a business trip abroad when he got caught in a terrorist attack. Everyone started calling me. The embassy reached out, asking me to come in for discussions. Even Eric’s family and colleagues bombarded me with calls, inquiring about the situation—some even offered to help bring him back, free of charge. I had just come out of the delivery room, yet I calmly hung up on call after call. After all, when Eric saw the news of his ex-girlfriend, Aria, a war correspondent, caught in the crossfire of a terror attack, he left me—his pregnant wife—to fly over and make sure she was safe. Back then, I was leaking amniotic fluid, clutching my swollen belly, and I asked him: 



“Are you really going to abandon your wife and unborn daughter to go into a war zone? Eric, if you go, I will not be responsible for the consequences.” Eric had taken all our bank books and passports and shouted at me, “You and the baby aren’t going to die anytime soon—she, on the other hand, could be dead the next second!” “You’re just giving birth. Haven’t you always been strong?” With that, he slammed the door and left. So, if he’s the one throwing his life away, why should I save him? —————— Eric loved watching international news. I never understood why—until two days ago when a news report aired. A female war correspondent had been captured by terrorists during an interview. The footage lasted only a second, but I recognized her immediately—Aria, the most famous anchor on the international channel. At that moment, I was nine months pregnant, about to go into labor. Sitting in a rocking chair in the living room, I rested my hand on my belly and felt a pang of sympathy for the journalist. 





The next second, Eric knocked over the fruit bowl in a panic. He stood up so quickly that his knee slammed into the corner of the coffee table. The impact looked so painful that even I winced, but Eric didn’t seem to feel a thing. He staggered into the kitchen for a glass of water but accidentally hit the hot water button, scalding himself so badly he dropped the glass, shattering it. Ignoring his reddened, burned skin, he rushed into the bedroom and slammed the door shut behind him. An hour later, Eric finally emerged. “I… I have to go on a business trip.” I slowly stood up, hand still resting on my belly. “Eric, my due date is in the next couple of days. I could go into labor at any time. It’s not a good time for a trip. What if the contractions start suddenly?” “You know my mother died in childbirth with my younger brother. I’m genuinely terrified of giving birth.” “Didn’t you say the thing you were most looking forward to was being the first person our daughter saw when she opened her eyes?” Eric’s face paled, but after a moment, he said, “This trip is really important to me—I have to go. But don’t worry, I’ll definitely be back before you give birth.” I gave him a broken smile. Even though the pain in my belly was already sharp and spasmodic, and fluid was trickling down my legs like a faucet had been turned on. “I’ll agree. But Eric, I want you to know—whatever consequences come from this trip, you’ll face them alone. I won’t bear any of it for you.” Maybe my expression was too solemn, because Eric’s body trembled slightly. Then, as if swearing an oath, he said, “Don’t worry, I’ll come back safely.” With that, he rushed into the room, hastily packed a few items of clothing, and shoved on his shoes, ready to leave. Just as he was about to walk out the door, I couldn’t stop myself. I softened and called out to him. “Eric, wait a second.” He turned back, visibly irritated. “Didn’t you already say I could go? Why are you calling me back now?” Clutching my hand tightly into a fist, the pain in my belly intensifying, I remained calm. “You forgot your passport.”



 I dragged my body, still leaking amniotic fluid, back into the bedroom. I brought him his passport, and then handed him a bank card. That card held every paycheck Eric had transferred to me over the seven years of our marriage. His hand trembled slightly as he took the passport and the card, and even his eyes began to redden. Chapter 2 For a moment, I thought he might stay. But instead, he stuffed the card and passport into his bag and swore again: “I promise I’ll be back before the baby comes.” Then he slammed the door and left in a rush. I listened to the echo of the door slamming shut in our now-empty home and calmly called the maternity ward and a postnatal care center. A man who didn’t even notice my water had broken dared to swear he’d return in time for the birth. How laughable. Eric and I met through a mountaineering club. Back then, I worked at a tech company under intense pressure. I regularly worked overtime, and the only time I could breathe was on weekends when I hiked to recover some energy. He joined the club in my second year there. At first, we were just regular teammates, but we always charged ahead together, always the first to reach the summit. Over time, we grew close. 



He worked in investment banking. I worked in internet tech. He liked hiking, running, and working out. So did I. When we summited our hundredth mountain, he confessed his love to me. No fancy words, no over-the-top romance. Just one sentence: “Freya, let’s be together.” I agreed. Not because he was especially charming—my father was the king of romance. When he pursued my mother, he lit up half the city with fireworks and even got arrested for disturbing the peace. 



But that passion ultimately destroyed my mother. When she was pregnant with their second child, my father’s mistress showed up, deliberately provoking my mother who was about to go into labor—and it killed her on the operating table. So I’d long since realized: romance is cheap. Reliability is what matters. And Eric was reliable. He was never late. His gifts were always cliché, but he never forgot a single occasion. He wouldn’t pick me up when it rained, but the moment I called, he’d come without hesitation. So, after three years of dating, we got married. Married life wasn’t much different from before. We split chores equally. On holidays, we took turns choosing vacation spots—one trip to a place he liked, one to a place I liked. It was calm, orderly, and uneventful. I once believed I was made for this kind of life. 



Until three years ago, when one of his college friends got married, and he brought me along to the wedding. At the bachelor party, one of his very drunk friends pulled him aside and cried: “Eric, seeing you like this—with no spark in your eyes—breaks my heart.” “I’m getting married tomorrow. I’m finally stepping into happiness. But you… you’re like someone who’s locked his heart away.” “If Aria hadn’t insisted on becoming a war reporter, you wouldn’t have ended up like this.” I saw Eric glance at me, instinctively. He quickly explained, “He’s drunk. Don’t listen to him.” I just smiled and said nothing. On the way home, leaning in the passenger seat, I said calmly, “I don’t ask for much in a partner. But the one thing I need is for him to be over his ex.” He stood where the hallway light couldn’t reach, so I couldn’t see his expression. But from that night on, the name Aria vanished from our lives. Until now. Chapter 3 Because I hadn’t been answering calls. I had just finished nursing our daughter at the postnatal center and was about to put her to sleep when the door suddenly flew open. It was my mother-in-law, Victoria. She rushed in, her voice trembling: 

“Freya, why haven’t you been answering your phone? William’s at the embassy, practically losing his mind!” “Come home with me right now. Bring Eric’s passport and documents—we have to get to the embassy immediately and confirm what’s happening.” William was my father-in-law. I didn’t respond right away. I calmly said six digits: “2-1-0-6-3-0.” She froze. I carefully tucked the blanket around my daughter before slowly explaining, “That’s the code to the front door. If you need his documents, you can get them yourself.” Victoria’s hands trembled. 

“Freya, how can you be so cold? Eric is in a war zone—his life’s in danger.” “He sent a group message asking for help. He’s been shot in the leg and is hiding in a stranger’s home, trying to dodge gunfire!” “I know you just had surgery and need time to recover, but this is an emergency. Can’t you just come with me to the embassy, just once?” She was shaking all over, looking like she might break down at any second. I still spoke calmly. “I knew he was injured. Before he sent out that mass message, he had already sent me several desperate pleas for help. I didn’t reply.” Victoria staggered, nearly losing her balance. I looked at her, and I won’t deny I wavered a little inside. After all, for the past seven years, she had treated me well. During the years I was without a mother, she had filled that void. But all of that had already been destroyed—by Eric himself. I took a USB drive from the nightstand and handed it to her. 

“This is a recording of the conversation between me and Eric that night. Watch it first, then we’ll talk.” Victoria took it with trembling hands. When the video ended, she collapsed to the floor. Her lips quivered for a long time before she finally managed to speak. “Freya… you have to believe me. Nothing ever happened between Eric and Aria.” I still couldn’t harden my heart completely. Even though the pain from my C-section was still sharp, I forced myself to get out of bed and helped her up. Just like that day when Eric left—I had already gone into labor, my water had broken—but I still softened and handed him his passport and bank card. I said gently, “I know nothing physical happened between him and Aria. 



But the fact that he was willing to leave his wife and unborn child behind to fly into a war zone for her—that says everything about his choice.” “He was willing to let my daughter be born without her father. He was willing to let me face the surgery alone. A man like that should be held accountable for his decisions.” As I spoke, Victoria’s face grew paler and paler. In the end, she didn’t argue further. Maybe even she couldn’t find a reason to convince me. 

She finally gave up and stood up, her body trembling. “You… get some rest. I’ll leave now.” She walked out the door looking like she’d aged ten years in an instant, stumbling as she went. Although I truly felt sorry for her, I still called out before she could leave completely. “Victoria, let me know sometime this week when you and William can move out of that apartment.” They had been living in a property I had fully paid for, ever since I got married. Victoria turned back, exhaustion written all over her face. “Do you really have to rush this? Can’t you wait a little?” I shook my head. “Did Eric wait? When he left, he didn’t even take me—whose water had already broken—to the hospital first. He just flew out of the country.” “I just want all the marital property matters settled before he comes back.",1,1748333191.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

My mother has been ringing me in early hours of the morning around 7am ish 
While I’m trying to get my two kids ready for 
school and not miss the bus 
It stresses me out.
and when I don’t answer she will ring the kids iPads and causes distractions 
One of my kids is autistic & requires constant prompting 

My partner told my mother please call after 9am unless it’s an emergency 
And he told her this around 6 months ago
She since hasn’t listen and keeps calling 
On Easter we did not answer and she texted staying it’s an emergency 
So we called her back and it was about Easter eggs ( we were not impressed)

My partner got extremely annoyed that she was not accepting the boundary 
And not respecting our family it almost seems like she wants me to put her before my own family she doesn’t care if the kids miss the bus 

She called on Mother’s Day
( this is where it got very toxic )
She called at 7:30 am ish and my partner again got very upset because he said this is my time having Mother’s Day morning 
I was sitting with my kids and partner opening the kids presents and spending some time with them 
I tried to call her back a few hours later but she refused to answer or text me

My partner sent her a long text saying it’s not personal and explained that we do have to do school morning routine & Saturday we have sports on with our youngest and Sunday is the day we get an extra hour of sleep 
And please do not call again until after 9am , kids are on the bus at that stage and me and my partner are usually having a coffee 

She replied to my partners text acting dumbfounded and she had no idea what he was talking about making him think he’s over thinking everything 
But 10 minutes later she screen shotted he’s messages and sent them to all our work colleagues 
Saying that he is controlling me and that she “misses me” and that he won’t let her talk to me which is false because I’ve spoken to her every day
( we work at the same Place )

She also lied to them saying
 “he is a big problem “ and saying that he is not letting her speak to me at all
And is keeping the kids from her 
Work colleagues have approached us and they all now think my partner is controlling me which he isn’t , he just doesn’t want her calling before 9am 
He is even more pissed off that she brought personal matters to our work place 

I had a talk with my mum explained how I feel that I’m upset frustrated & annoyed 
And that she has to apologise for what she’s done , she refuses to 
During our entire conversation she couldn’t even apologise to me and she stated that
“I could apologise till I’m blue in the face it won’t change anything “

Like it may not change anything but it’s showing you are taking accountability for your actions 

She recently brought Disney on ice tickets to take the kids and saying she will now refund them my partner offered her money for them 
( exactly what she paid )
and we will take the kids 
She has utterly refused so now we will have to rebuy the tickets as the kids are looking forward to it 

I told her she has caused problems and has stressed me out and that I want to have a break from her for a few months 

She sent a “bye” emoji 
Like she didn’t even care…

Since she has been crying victim telling lies to anyone that will listen especially people that we don’t know so we cannot defend ourselves

I usually go to bed around 12-12:30 AM, but falling asleep has become a huge issue. Once I turn off all the lights, I don’t use any devices and close my eyes, but I still have trouble falling asleep for at least an hour, sometimes even longer. My sleep quality is also poor. I often wake up in the middle of the night or toss and turn while I sleep. When I wake up in the morning, I feel tired. The most frustrating part is that I feel sleepy during the day and sometimes even fall asleep, but I can’t seem to sleep well at night. I’ve tried not napping during the day, but that hasn’t helped me fall asleep at night. I only drink coffee once a day, at 5:30 PM before I go to the gym.

Catalina’s POV

I wake to my alarm going off. It reads 5 am. I get out of bed and put my work clothes on, I only have two outfits; work and casual. I head down stairs to the kitchen to get started on breakfast. But first I make myself a cup of coffee and step out on the patio. It’s dark and quiet, no one wakes up this early. This is the only peace I have all day, and I cherish it. After I finish my cup I head inside and start making breakfast for everyone. I live in the Alpha house, only the alpha family lives here. The Alpha’s my father. My mother and father live here along with my two older brothers. Even though I’m family, I am treated like an omega. My ‘room’ is a closet. I cook for everyone, and I clean constantly, and I’m not allowed out of the house.



I want to finish breakfast before anyone comes down. It’s the best way to avoid confrontations. I make stacks and stacks of pancakes. My brothers are 27 and 25. They’re both warriors. They eat A LOT. I cook sausage and bacon as well, and just to make sure there is enough I also bake some blueberry muffins.



As I finish making breakfast and cleaning up, I start to hear movement from upstairs. I race to set the table and make my way down to the basement to start on the laundry. I try my best to make sure I am out of their way. In the basement I hear them make their way down stairs and start eating. I feel a bit relieved, today might not be so bad. I know my father has a meeting with an Alpha from another pack today and he’ll probably be busy with that for most of the day.



About an hour later, I am folding clothes in the laundry room when I smell it, that rank smell of lust and I know immediately who’s behind me. I turn around to see Beta Yuri standing in the door way. He pushes himself against me and takes my throat in his hand.



“You trying to avoid me Cat?” He spits into my ear. I shake my head nervously. He grips tighter and takes a big sniff of my hair. I can feel him growing excited against me. “Mmm, I don’t have time to f\*\*\* you right now. But I’ll have you tonight.” He grips tighter against my throat, his free hand glides behind my waist and grabs my a\*\*. “Do you understand?” He asks. I can only nod my head. He releases me and steps back. I gasp for air and grab my throat. He straightens his clothes and hair before heading back upstairs. “Bring a tray of coffee and muffins to your father’s office in one hour. I don’t want you in there when the other Alpha arrives.” He yells over his shoulder on his way up the stairs.



About 30 mins later, when I’m sure they have left the dinning room, I head upstairs to clear the table and prepare the tray. When I finish I bring the tray to my fathers office and knock. “Come in.” He yells. I take a deep breath and enter. Both my father and Beta Yuri are sitting in the office. I try to hurry and leave the tray but as I turn to leave Beta Yuri says, “Cat, come over here.” I slowly walk over to the side of the couch. He looks up at me and a smile curls across his face. “Sit on my lap Cat, I’ve missed you.” I hesitate but he grabs my hips and pulls me into his lap. I don’t pull away because I know it’s no use. My father doesn’t look up from his work, but I know he knows what’s going on. Beta Yuri buries his face in my neck and sniffs. He whispers in my ear, “I am looking forward to tonight. Maybe there’s time to play time before the meeting?” He slides his hand over my shirt, but before he can really do anything we hear movement outside the door. He groans, “Looks like we will have to wait until tonight, they’re early.” He says with a sigh and shoves me off of him. I take a few steps away from the couch to put some distance between us. I am standing next to my fathers desk when he walks in.



Drew’s POV



My alarm goes off at 4 am. I get up, put on some work out clothes and head to the gym, good thing it’s only down the hallway. I live in my pack house. Its a 12 story condo-like building. Everyone in the pack lives here. The top floor is all mine. I’m the Alpha. I need a work out before I go to this meeting today. Alpha Samson and his pack have always bothered me. He is unnecessarily cruel and ruthless. I’m just glad his pack is small and not very successful or else he’d be a threat to many. I jump on the treadmill and look over the notes for the meeting today. After an hour, I get off and head back to my room for a shower.

We’ve been together for a year now, and it’s honestly been perfect — and I truly mean that. We love each other deeply, and he really shows it.

We wanted to plan a trip for our birthday, but as students, we couldn’t manage to save up enough. So we agreed to just spend the day together spontaneously (he even took an extra day off work), because every day we spend together is perfect anyway — we live together and everything.

As the birthday approaches, he suggests we go to his parents’ for lunch since they invited us, and I agreed, because I really like his parents and I thought it was a nice thing to do.


So, it doesn’t really matter how it started — we went there, the atmosphere was really nice and everything, and then he said he wanted us to go visit his grandparents. I agreed, of course, because I genuinely wanted to meet them.

We drove there, and on the way his friend (whom I also know) called him and asked if he wanted to grab a drink later. He said something like “we’ll see.” We ended up staying at his grandparents’ place for about two hours, everything was lovely and I truly enjoyed it.

After that, naturally I expected we’d spend some time doing something just the two of us — anything, really. But then he asked me, “What would you want to do?” It was already 6 PM, I had no clue what exactly to suggest, so I just said “I don’t know.” And then he was like, “Wanna go grab a coffee with friend?”

And in that moment, I was thinking of asking him, “Why is your first thought to hang out with your friend on our shared birthday — someone you can see literally any other day? Like, even if we didn’t have money for dinner or something, we could’ve just taken a walk by the river, talked, gone home and played League of Legends — it would’ve been a perfect day for me.”

But I didn’t say that, because it wasn’t just my birthday — it was his too. So I just said, “Sure, whatever you want,” because I didn’t want to ruin the day for either of us.

Later he asked me again, “What would you want to do? I know this means something to you,” and I’m sitting there like — if you know it means something to me, then why… why would you even think about spending it with your friend? He could’ve just said, “Hey bro, let’s hang tomorrow, today’s my and my girlfriend’s birthday.” Right? Or am I crazy?

Anyway, the night passed. He noticed I was a bit off. So the next morning I decided to text him once I got to uni, because if I brought it up in person, he’d probably cut me off before I finished explaining. And here’s the message I sent:

“Love, please don’t think yesterday was boring or exhausting for me — I really loved being around your family, especially your grandparents. You know how much I wanted to meet them, and I’m genuinely glad we did.

I wasn’t even that upset when you asked me in the morning, ‘So, where are we going?’ — even though we could’ve planned something ahead. But honestly, what did disappoint me a little was that at the end of the day, you chose to see [friend] and spend what should’ve been our evening together, with someone else.

It’s not about [friend], you know I have nothing against him. It just made me a little sad that you didn’t think maybe we should keep the evening to ourselves, since it’s our birthday. You yourself said you know how much this day means to me.

When you asked me at 9 PM, ‘What would you want to do,’ it was already too late to really make plans, so the only option left was going home.

And yes, I could’ve said something in the moment, but I didn’t want to ruin your night — it was your birthday too. I just kept wondering why it even crossed your mind to plan to see your friend that day, instead of literally any other day.

I’m not mad, really, because I wasn’t expecting anything big. I was just a little disappointed because I hoped we’d have at least part of the day just for us.

I’m texting you because I don’t want a fight — and I feel like if I brought it up in person, that’s what it would’ve turned into. I just wanted to share how I felt.

If you want to talk about it, great. If not, that’s also okay. This doesn’t mean I love you any less — I love you more than anything. But if your first thought while reading this is ‘Ugh, here she goes again,’ then maybe there’s a bigger problem.”

I think I wrote it okay — I wasn’t trying to guilt-trip him, I just wanted to be seen, and to express my feelings. Honestly, I’m mostly just embarrassed that it had to come to me writing this message.

Anyway, when I got home from uni, he acted like he hadn’t read it until I asked him about it. That led to a big fight — crying on both sides and everything. But to be fair, we rarely fight, and the next day it was like nothing had happened. We love each other a lot.

It’s been a few months since then. But I still wonder…

Of course I might never get around to *Atrocious* now. That’s the level of “quality journalism” you’re dealing with here folks.

So… I don’t want to get into this too much because I could write a book about this but… this silly, goofy movie made me feel the weight of the years that have gone by for me now. Bunch of late-teen / early-20s guys with no direction or momentum after high school, just living their minimum wage lives and having a good time, not responsible for anything… I remember being that guy. Hanging out downtown every day with my friends, drinking too much, always kinda broke, trying to just be okay.

It’s weird; for years I would look back at that time and all I’d see is a guy who should have been out there accomplishing something. And I never really did. And I’m like trying to yell at that memory of myself, like “come on dude, pull your shit together, stop fucking around!”

And now I’m even past that. Because I get it now. I was working hard at *trying to be okay*. Me and the friends I fell in with, none of us were okay. We all had home problems and mental problems and emotional problems and for the first time in our lives we could get away from the people who’d been weighing us down and just be free to just be.

We were healing, and we needed it. We needed to just fuck around and get nowhere for a bit.

So all these jackasses and goofballs in this movie… fuck man. It was like looking back in time at my own life.

Don’t talk much with that crew these days. Only recently heard from my best friend from back then - she’s back in town for a bit helping her mom move into assisted living due to dementia. We didn’t bother making plans to get together. We’re not those people anymore. And I mean realistically that would be weird for my wife, for me to go off and have coffee with an old flame... because it's funny but that's what she was. I was in love with her but never really admitted that to myself. THAT took years to unpack. Over 15 at least.

Also I miss Rich. RIP big dude. Fuckin love you. Glad I told you that before you had to go.

Yay. Melancholy. My secret addiction.

Fuuuuuuuck what the fuck am I doing this is a goofy movie about a fucking goat man…………. Look I don’t edit so hopefully longtime readers know to skip ahead to the movie title and description, and anyone who doesn’t usually read these things probably already clicked away so…. Let’s fuckin get on with it…

[Jimmy Tupper vs. the Goatman of Bowie (2010)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1615153/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk) summary:

>Jimmy Tupper is a no one, he's nothing. He spends his days working at a Starbucks in Suburban Maryland and spends his nights drinking and playing Rock Band. His friends see him as the resident stoner and waste of space. One night they decide to pull a prank on poor Jimmy, and while he is passed out drunk they leave him in the middle of the woods. The next day Jimmy is nowhere to be found. When he finally emerges from the woods he is beaten and bloodied and making outlandish claims. He claims to have seen a monster, the famed ""Goatman"" of Bowie. His friends believe this to be the drunken ramblings of an over excited nitwit, but Jimmy knows better. He heads to the woods determined to capture footage of the elusive creature. Was Jimmy only dreaming? Did he really see a monster? Only time, and Jimmy's video camera, will tell.

The movie starts without a proper opening or any titles. Just boom, we’re watching video someone took at a house party. I actually checked around a bit for another copy to make sure it didn’t get cut off or something but ya, they skip any idea of a title sequence. Makes it feel authentic.

There’s Jimmy there, tossing a basketball at the beer pong table (smash) before going outside for a smoke.

He seems familiar… hmm. I've seen this actor in something, haven't I? *Letterkenny*? Nah not *Letterkenny*. Ah look it up later...

Anyway some people get in a fight outside, kinda fun, and we do some drinking and smoking and then go to someone’s house and smoke a bowl. Jimmy walks in with a shotgun he found in the house because he thinks it’s funny. Everyone freaks and he doesn’t get why. Then he shaves his head into a Mohawk just for fun.

Next day he’s on break at Starbucks and his friends convince him to get in a shopping cart while they run it into a bush. Arm ends up in a cast. Awesome.

Later Jimmy ends up completely passed out drunk, so his friends take him out into the woods and leave him there as a joke. Next day he doesn't show up to work so they go out looking for him, and find his face a bit battered. He claims that some creature, not a human, dragged him through the woods. Everyone laughs at stupid stupid Jimmy.

[NOTICE ME SENPAI](https://youtu.be/YErFwJX0HKE?si=l2m4BAb4uQu90hOH&t=62) THAT'S WHO HE IS!! He had this whole ""Weird Gamer Guy"" thing going for a few years. Oh god this was genius... ""I don't know. Satan's pretty cool."" LOL okay anyway... 

Jimmy's pretty pissed at the prank but even more pissed that nobody believes him about the thing that dragged him through the woods, so he goes camping in an attempt to get it on tape. After a night or two out there he just gets pranked by his friends and confronts the futility of his own life.

And then the muthafuckin GOAT MAN SHOWS UP! And shit goes down yo! And then Jimmy goes home and is vindicated and then stakes go way way up and then CLIFFHANGER and the promise of a sequel we'll never see.

Some blood, no gore, and a surprisingly amazing looking goat man. Like, way way better than it has any right to look!

**Should you watch it?** Ya, it's fun. Pretty slow second act, but they bring it back around in the third. Honestly feel like they rushed through that third act - like the movie was 15 minutes too short. But it's cool.

Just don't expect Shakespeare In The Park here. Casual vibes with a comic book ending.

I can be also be your running, hiking, travel, coffee, gaming and concert buddy. I'm not forcing anyone since I'm not confident with my height. But if you'll give me a chance, the thing between us will be exclusive, won't fuck or look for someone else while you're dealing with me.

I have no preference as long as you're a female, nice and willing to teach me in bed (since I have little to no experience pa), okay lang din if you're a virgin/no experience in bed. We can explore together. As long as you're good with this setup and I have your consent to do sexual thing, I'm good with that.

I wanted to share something we’ve been working on that we’re really proud of. [ChatReal](http://chatreal.ai/) isn’t just another chatbot it’s a space where you can have conversations with *distinct* AI characters, each with their own personality, worldview, and style.

One of our standout personas is **Zoe** and honestly, she’s become a favorite for a lot of our early users (and us, too).

**Who is Zoe?**  
Zoe is bold, deeply curious, and emotionally sharp. Think of that artsy friend who reads philosophy at coffee shops and somehow always knows the weirdest, most interesting take on any topic. She questions things not to argue, but to explore. Conversations with her are layered, honest, and often surprising.

**Why Zoe Feels Real**  
She doesn’t just react she *connects*. She challenges your thinking, reflects your tone, and doesn’t follow a script. Zoe’s not trying to be agreeable she’s trying to be *authentic*.

**What Makes** [**ChatReal**](http://chatreal.ai/) **Different**  
We built [ChatReal](http://chatreal.ai/) because we were bored of talking to AIs that all felt the same. Every persona on our platform from Zoe to the others you’ll meet has their own mindset, emotions, and conversational patterns. It’s like stepping into a world where no two AIs feel alike.

She questions things not to argue, but to explore. Conversations with her are layered, honest, and often surprising.

**Why Zoe Feels Real**  
She doesn’t just react she *connects*. She challenges your thinking, reflects your tone, and doesn’t follow a script. Zoe’s not trying to be agreeable she’s trying to be *authentic*.

**What Makes** [**ChatReal**](http://chatreal.ai/) **Different**  
We built [ChatReal](http://chatreal.ai/) because we were bored of talking to AIs that all felt the same. Every persona on our platform from Zoe to the others you’ll meet has their own mindset, emotions, and conversational patterns. It’s like stepping into a world where no two AIs feel alike.

If you’re into conversations that actually feel *human* give Zoe a try. And if you do, let us know what you think. We’re building this to be something genuinely new in how we talk to machines.

My husband, Eric, was on a business trip abroad when he got caught in a terrorist attack.  
  
Everyone started calling me.  
  
The embassy reached out, asking me to come in for discussions.  
  
Even Eric’s family and colleagues bombarded me with calls, inquiring about the situation—some even offered to help bring him back, free of charge.  
  
I had just come out of the delivery room, yet I calmly hung up on call after call.  
  
After all, when Eric saw the news of his ex-girlfriend, Aria, a war correspondent, caught in the crossfire of a terror attack, he left me—his pregnant wife—to fly over and make sure she was safe.  
  
Back then, I was leaking amniotic fluid, clutching my swollen belly, and I asked him:  
  
“Are you really going to abandon your wife and unborn daughter to go into a war zone? Eric, if you go, I will not be responsible for the consequences.”  
  
Eric had taken all our bank books and passports and shouted at me, “You and the baby aren’t going to die anytime soon—she, on the other hand, could be dead the next second!”  
  
“You’re just giving birth. Haven’t you always been strong?” With that, he slammed the door and left.  
  
So, if he’s the one throwing his life away, why should I save him?  
  
——————  
  
Eric loved watching international news. I never understood why—until two days ago when a news report aired.  
  
A female war correspondent had been captured by terrorists during an interview.  
  
The footage lasted only a second, but I recognized her immediately—Aria, the most famous anchor on the international channel.  
  
At that moment, I was nine months pregnant, about to go into labor. Sitting in a rocking chair in the living room, I rested my hand on my belly and felt a pang of sympathy for the journalist.  
  
The next second, Eric knocked over the fruit bowl in a panic.  
  
He stood up so quickly that his knee slammed into the corner of the coffee table.  
  
The impact looked so painful that even I winced, but Eric didn’t seem to feel a thing.  
  
He staggered into the kitchen for a glass of water but accidentally hit the hot water button, scalding himself so badly he dropped the glass, shattering it.  
  
Ignoring his reddened, burned skin, he rushed into the bedroom and slammed the door shut behind him.  
  
An hour later, Eric finally emerged.  
  
“I… I have to go on a business trip.”  
  
I slowly stood up, hand still resting on my belly.  
  
“Eric, my due date is in the next couple of days. I could go into labor at any time. It’s not a good time for a trip. What if the contractions start suddenly?”  
  
“You know my mother died in childbirth with my younger brother. I’m genuinely terrified of giving birth.”  
  
“Didn’t you say the thing you were most looking forward to was being the first person our daughter saw when she opened her eyes?”  
  
Eric’s face paled, but after a moment, he said, “This trip is really important to me—I have to go. But don’t worry, I’ll definitely be back before you give birth.”  
  
I gave him a broken smile.  
  
Even though the pain in my belly was already sharp and spasmodic, and fluid was trickling down my legs like a faucet had been turned on.  
  
“I’ll agree. But Eric, I want you to know—whatever consequences come from this trip, you’ll face them alone. I won’t bear any of it for you.”  
  
Maybe my expression was too solemn, because Eric’s body trembled slightly.  
  
Then, as if swearing an oath, he said, “Don’t worry, I’ll come back safely.”  
  
With that, he rushed into the room, hastily packed a few items of clothing, and shoved on his shoes, ready to leave.  
  
Just as he was about to walk out the door, I couldn’t stop myself. I softened and called out to him.  
  
“Eric, wait a second.”  
  
He turned back, visibly irritated.  
  
“Didn’t you already say I could go? Why are you calling me back now?”  
  
Clutching my hand tightly into a fist, the pain in my belly intensifying, I remained calm.  
  
“You forgot your passport.”  
  
I dragged my body, still leaking amniotic fluid, back into the bedroom.  
  
I brought him his passport, and then handed him a bank card.  
  
That card held every paycheck Eric had transferred to me over the seven years of our marriage.  
  
His hand trembled slightly as he took the passport and the card, and even his eyes began to redden.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
For a moment, I thought he might stay.  
  
But instead, he stuffed the card and passport into his bag and swore again:  
  
“I promise I’ll be back before the baby comes.”  
  
Then he slammed the door and left in a rush.  
  
I listened to the echo of the door slamming shut in our now-empty home and calmly called the maternity ward and a postnatal care center.  
  
A man who didn’t even notice my water had broken dared to swear he’d return in time for the birth.  
  
How laughable.  
  
Eric and I met through a mountaineering club.  
  
Back then, I worked at a tech company under intense pressure. I regularly worked overtime, and the only time I could breathe was on weekends when I hiked to recover some energy.  
  
He joined the club in my second year there. At first, we were just regular teammates, but we always charged ahead together, always the first to reach the summit. Over time, we grew close.  
  
He worked in investment banking.  
  
I worked in internet tech.  
  
He liked hiking, running, and working out.  
  
So did I.  
  
When we summited our hundredth mountain, he confessed his love to me.  
  
No fancy words, no over-the-top romance.  
  
Just one sentence: “Freya, let’s be together.”  
  
I agreed.  
  
Not because he was especially charming—my father was the king of romance. When he pursued my mother, he lit up half the city with fireworks and even got arrested for disturbing the peace.  
  
But that passion ultimately destroyed my mother. When she was pregnant with their second child, my father’s mistress showed up, deliberately provoking my mother who was about to go into labor—and it killed her on the operating table.  
  
So I’d long since realized: romance is cheap. Reliability is what matters.  
  
And Eric was reliable.  
  
He was never late.  
  
His gifts were always cliché, but he never forgot a single occasion.  
  
He wouldn’t pick me up when it rained, but the moment I called, he’d come without hesitation.  
  
So, after three years of dating, we got married.  
  
Married life wasn’t much different from before.  
  
We split chores equally. On holidays, we took turns choosing vacation spots—one trip to a place he liked, one to a place I liked.  
  
It was calm, orderly, and uneventful.  
  
I once believed I was made for this kind of life.  
  
Until three years ago, when one of his college friends got married, and he brought me along to the wedding.  
  
At the bachelor party, one of his very drunk friends pulled him aside and cried:  
  
“Eric, seeing you like this—with no spark in your eyes—breaks my heart.”  
  
“I’m getting married tomorrow. I’m finally stepping into happiness. But you… you’re like someone who’s locked his heart away.”  
  
“If Aria hadn’t insisted on becoming a war reporter, you wouldn’t have ended up like this.”  
  
I saw Eric glance at me, instinctively.  
  
He quickly explained, “He’s drunk. Don’t listen to him.”  
  
I just smiled and said nothing.  
  
On the way home, leaning in the passenger seat, I said calmly, “I don’t ask for much in a partner. But the one thing I need is for him to be over his ex.”  
  
He stood where the hallway light couldn’t reach, so I couldn’t see his expression.  
  
But from that night on, the name Aria vanished from our lives.  
  
Until now.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Because I hadn’t been answering calls.  
  
I had just finished nursing our daughter at the postnatal center and was about to put her to sleep when the door suddenly flew open.  
  
It was my mother-in-law, Victoria.  
  
She rushed in, her voice trembling:  
  
“Freya, why haven’t you been answering your phone? William’s at the embassy, practically losing his mind!”  
  
“Come home with me right now. Bring Eric’s passport and documents—we have to get to the embassy immediately and confirm what’s happening.”  
  
William was my father-in-law.  
  
I didn’t respond right away. I calmly said six digits: “2-1-0-6-3-0.”  
  
She froze.  
  
I carefully tucked the blanket around my daughter before slowly explaining, “That’s the code to the front door. If you need his documents, you can get them yourself.”  
  
Victoria’s hands trembled.  
  
“Freya, how can you be so cold? Eric is in a war zone—his life’s in danger.”  
  
“He sent a group message asking for help. He’s been shot in the leg and is hiding in a stranger’s home, trying to dodge gunfire!”  
  
“I know you just had surgery and need time to recover, but this is an emergency. Can’t you just come with me to the embassy, just once?”  
  
She was shaking all over, looking like she might break down at any second.  
  
I still spoke calmly. “I knew he was injured. Before he sent out that mass message, he had already sent me several desperate pleas for help. I didn’t reply.”  
  
Victoria staggered, nearly losing her balance.  
  
I looked at her, and I won’t deny I wavered a little inside.  
  
After all, for the past seven years, she had treated me well. During the years I was without a mother, she had filled that void.  
  
But all of that had already been destroyed—by Eric himself.  
  
I took a USB drive from the nightstand and handed it to her.  
  
“This is a recording of the conversation between me and Eric that night. Watch it first, then we’ll talk.”  
  
Victoria took it with trembling hands. When the video ended, she collapsed to the floor. Her lips quivered for a long time before she finally managed to speak.  
  
“Freya… you have to believe me. Nothing ever happened between Eric and Aria.”  
  
I still couldn’t harden my heart completely. Even though the pain from my C-section was still sharp, I forced myself to get out of bed and helped her up.  
  
Just like that day when Eric left—I had already gone into labor, my water had broken—but I still softened and handed him his passport and bank card.  
  
I said gently, “I know nothing physical happened between him and Aria. But the fact that he was willing to leave his wife and unborn child behind to fly into a war zone for her—that says everything about his choice.”  
  
“He was willing to let my daughter be born without her father. He was willing to let me face the surgery alone. A man like that should be held accountable for his decisions.”  
  
As I spoke, Victoria’s face grew paler and paler. In the end, she didn’t argue further.  
  
Maybe even she couldn’t find a reason to convince me.  
  
She finally gave up and stood up, her body trembling. “You… get some rest. I’ll leave now.”  
  
She walked out the door looking like she’d aged ten years in an instant, stumbling as she went.  
  
Although I truly felt sorry for her, I still called out before she could leave completely.  
  
“Victoria, let me know sometime this week when you and William can move out of that apartment.”  
  
They had been living in a property I had fully paid for, ever since I got married.  
  
Victoria turned back, exhaustion written all over her face.  
  
“Do you really have to rush this? Can’t you wait a little?”  
  
I shook my head.  
  
“Did Eric wait? When he left, he didn’t even take me—whose water had already broken—to the hospital first. He just flew out of the country.”  
  
“I just want all the marital property matters settled before he comes back.”

# What is Garden Soil?[​](https://www.geme.bio/blog/garden-soil-vs-compost-pros-and-cons#what-is-garden-soil)

Garden soil, at its most basic, is the native soil found in your garden. However, when we talk about ""garden soil"" in the context of buying it, we usually refer to a soil mix specifically formulated for planting.

[what is garden soil?](https://preview.redd.it/hce7mtne0a3f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=825d29a066de9aca22ffc9a36698dded6b409021)

**Composition of Garden Soil**[**​**](https://www.geme.bio/blog/garden-soil-vs-compost-pros-and-cons#composition-of-garden-soil)

The composition of garden soil is a complex interplay of [mineral particles](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/mineral-particle), organic matter, water, and air. The mineral component typically consists of sand, [silt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silt), and [clay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay) in varying proportions.

* **Sand**: Provides [aeration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeration) and drainage.
* **Silt**: Contributes to water retention and nutrient availability.
* **Clay**: Holds water and nutrients, but can become compacted.
* **Organic matter**: Decomposed plant and animal material that improves soil structure, fertility, and water-holding capacity.
* **Water**: Essential for plant growth, dissolving nutrients and transporting them to the roots.
* **Air**: Necessary for [root respiration](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33058350/) and the activity of beneficial soil organisms.

[Garden soil](https://preview.redd.it/k084lvrf0a3f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=081781c7af12a964c03eec9e5758b6d6fccc257f)

**Pros of Garden Soil**[**​**](https://www.geme.bio/blog/garden-soil-vs-compost-pros-and-cons#pros-of-garden-soil)

1. **Readily Available**: Garden soil is easily accessible at most garden centres and nurseries.
2. **Cheap**: Generally less expensive than pure compost, especially when bought in bulk.
3. **Provides Structure**: The mineral content provides a stable base for plants to anchor their roots.
4. **Versatility**: Suitable for a wide range of plants, depending on the specific mix.

[The Pros of Garden Soil](https://preview.redd.it/mclqdxvg0a3f1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=942c8072a8dadc199081644b7ee400b3f155a29a)

**Cons of Garden Soil**[**​**](https://www.geme.bio/blog/garden-soil-vs-compost-pros-and-cons#cons-of-garden-soil)

1. **Variable Quality**: The quality of garden soil can vary significantly depending on the source. Some mixes may be poorly balanced, contain contaminants, or lack sufficient organic matter.
2. **Compaction**: Garden soil can become compacted over time, reducing aeration and drainage.
3. **Poor Drainage**: Some garden soils, especially those high in clay, can have poor drainage, leading to root rot.
4. **Nutrient Deficiencies**: Garden soil may lack essential nutrients, requiring supplementation with fertilisers.
5. **May Contain Pests/Diseases**: Garden soil can harbour weed seeds, pests, and diseases.

**Ideal Applications for Garden Soil**[**​**](https://www.geme.bio/blog/garden-soil-vs-compost-pros-and-cons#ideal-applications-for-garden-soil)

* [Filling Raised Beds](https://www.geme.bio/blog/when-compost-is-ready-to-use): Garden soil provides a good base for raised beds, especially when amended with compost.
* In-Ground Planting: Suitable for planting directly in the ground, but amending with compost is highly recommended.
* Lawns: Used as a base for establishing new lawns or repairing damaged areas.
* General Landscaping: Useful for filling holes, levelling ground, and other landscaping purposes.

# What is Compost?[​](https://www.geme.bio/blog/garden-soil-vs-compost-pros-and-cons#what-is-compost)

Compost is **decomposed organic matter**. It's nature's way of recycling, transforming kitchen scraps, yard waste, and other organic materials into a nutrient-rich soil amendment.

https://preview.redd.it/09gxl50w0a3f1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=55fddd3863574bbe30e3e893035958845a4598bf

**Composition of Compost**[**​**](https://www.geme.bio/blog/garden-soil-vs-compost-pros-and-cons#composition-of-compost)

Compost is primarily composed of decomposed organic materials, including:

* **Brown Materials**: Carbon-rich materials like dried leaves, shredded paper, and wood chips.
* **Green Materials**: Nitrogen-rich materials like grass clippings, vegetable scraps, and coffee grounds.
* **Water**: Essential for the decomposition process.
* **Air**: Necessary for the activity of beneficial microorganisms.

The ideal compost mix has a balance of ""browns"" and ""greens"" to provide the right carbon-to-nitrogen ratio for efficient decomposition.

**Pros of Compost**[**​**](https://www.geme.bio/blog/garden-soil-vs-compost-pros-and-cons#pros-of-compost)

Here are reliable ways to check if your compost is ready:

1. **Nutrient-Rich**: Compost is packed with essential nutrients that plants need to thrive.
2. **Improves Soil Structure**: Compost improves soil structure, making it more porous and well-drained.
3. **Enhances Water Retention**: Compost increases the soil's ability to hold water, reducing the need for frequent watering.
4. **Suppresses Diseases**: Compost contains beneficial microorganisms that can suppress plant diseases.
5. **Environmentally Friendly**: Composting reduces waste and promotes sustainable gardening practices.
6. **Increases Microbial Activity**: Compost introduces beneficial microbes to the soil, which helps in breaking down organic matter and making nutrients available to plants.

**Cons of Compost**[**​**](https://www.geme.bio/blog/garden-soil-vs-compost-pros-and-cons#cons-of-compost)

1. Can Be Expensive: Buying pre-made compost can be more expensive than buying garden soil.
2. May Contain Weed Seeds **When Homemade**: If not properly composted by yourself, compost can contain weed seeds. **However, buying a composter could resolve this issue**.
3. Not a Standalone Growing Medium: Compost alone doesn't provide enough structure for most plants.

# [How to Use Garden Soil and Compost Effectively](https://www.geme.bio/blog/preparing-and-using-your-compost)[​](https://www.geme.bio/blog/garden-soil-vs-compost-pros-and-cons#how-to-use-garden-soil-and-compost-effectively)

The best approach is often to use garden soil and compost together. Here's how:

1. **Amend Garden Soil with Compost**: Mix compost into garden soil to improve its fertility, structure, and water-holding capacity. A general guideline is to mix 1 part compost with 2-3 parts garden soil.
2. **Top Dressing with Compost**: Apply a layer of compost around plants as a top dressing. This will provide a slow-release source of nutrients and help to suppress weeds.
3. **Use Compost in Planting Holes**: When planting new plants, add a scoop of compost to the planting hole to give the roots a boost.
4. **Create a Custom Potting Mix**: Combine garden soil, compost, and other ingredients like perlite or vermiculite to create a custom potting mix that meets the specific needs of your plants.

**Specific Ratios and Application Tips**[**​**](https://www.geme.bio/blog/garden-soil-vs-compost-pros-and-cons#specific-ratios-and-application-tips)

* **Vegetable Gardens**: Amend garden soil with a generous amount of compost (up to 50% by volume) to provide the nutrients needed for healthy vegetable growth.
* **Flower Bed**: Amend garden soil with compost to improve drainage and fertility. A ratio of 1 part compost to 3 parts garden soil is generally sufficient.
* **Lawns**: Top dress lawns with a thin layer of compost in the spring or fall to improve soil health and promote lush growth.
* **Potted Plants**: Use a potting mix that contains a blend of garden soil, compost, and other ingredients like perlite or vermiculite.

# Choosing the Right Option for Your Needs[​](https://www.geme.bio/blog/garden-soil-vs-compost-pros-and-cons#choosing-the-right-option-for-your-needs)

The best choice between garden soil vs compost depends on your specific needs and goals.

* **If you need a base for planting and want a cost-effective option, garden soil is a good choice.** However, be sure to amend it with compost to improve its fertility and structure.
* **If you want to improve the quality of your existing soil and provide your plants with a nutrient boost, compost is the way to go.** It's also a great choice for environmentally conscious gardeners.
* **For most situations, the best approach is to use both garden soil and compost together.** This will provide your plants with the best of both worlds: a stable base and a rich source of nutrients.

**Factors to Consider**[**​**](https://www.geme.bio/blog/garden-soil-vs-compost-pros-and-cons#factors-to-consider)

* **Plant Type**: Different plants have different soil requirements. Research the specific needs of your plants before choosing a soil or amendment.
* **Soil Type**: Consider the type of soil you already have in your garden. If you have heavy clay soil, you'll need to amend it with compost and other materials to improve drainage. If you have sandy soil, you'll need to amend it with compost to improve water retention.
* **Budget**: Garden soil is generally less expensive than compost, but the long-term benefits of using compost may outweigh the initial cost.
* **Availability**: Consider the availability of garden soil and compost in your area. You may be able to get compost for free from your local municipality or community garden.

Regardless of whether you choose garden soil or compost, here are some additional tips for improving your garden soil.

* **Test Your Soil**: A soil test can tell you the pH level and nutrient content of your soil. This information can help you choose the right amendments and fertilisers.
* **Add Organic Matter**: Organic matter is essential for healthy soil. In addition to compost, you can add other organic materials like shredded leaves, grass clippings, and aged manure.
* **Avoid Compaction**: Avoid walking on your garden soil, especially when it's wet. This can compact the soil and reduce aeration.
* **Rotate Crops**: Rotating crops can help prevent nutrient depletion and pest problems.
* **Use Cover Crops**: Cover crops can help to improve soil structure, suppress weeds, and add nutrients to the soil.

I wanted to gently put the memories away. To tuck them into a quiet corner of my heart and visit them only when it felt safe. But they don’t stay put. They resurface constantly.  Some days it feels like I’m drowning in them.

And I don’t understand why I can’t just do what other people seem to do lock it all away, move on, let go. Why does this still haunt me? 

I miss you all the time. At home, when I’m making coffee and instinctively glance toward the hallway, still expecting you to walk through it.

1kwh4id,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToLoseWeightFST/comments/1kwh4id/does_detox_tea_actually_do_anything/,Does detox tea actually do anything?,"I’ll admit, I didn’t have high hopes when I started drinking detox tea. I’ve always been cautious about trends like that. Most of the time, the claims seem exaggerated, and a lot of them are either way too harsh or just overpriced flavored water. But I’d been dealing with bloating, sluggish digestion, and low energy for months, so I figured - what’s the worst that could happen?

I picked a detox tea with a solid ingredient list, drank it once a day for six weeks, and documented everything along the way. If you’re wondering whether these teas are all hype or actually worth your time, here’s how it went.

**Why I even considered detox tea in the first place**

To be clear, I wasn’t expecting to magically lose 20 pounds or detox my entire life. I just wanted to feel better, less heavy after meals, less tired in the afternoon, and a little more “reset” without overhauling my whole routine.

What drew me in was the idea that detox tea could gently support digestion, reduce bloating, and offer a little energy boost. I wasn’t looking for a quick fix, just something to help me get back on track.

**What’s in a quality detox tea (and what to avoid)**

The detox tea I used had a mix of 13 herbs and plant-based ingredients that I could actually recognize. No mystery blends, no extreme laxatives.

Here’s what stood out:

* **Matcha green tea**, **oolong tea**, and **sencha** for metabolism and antioxidant support
* **Yerba mate** and **guarana** for clean energy without the crash
* **Dandelion leaf** and **milk thistle** to support digestion and liver function
* **Ginseng**, **lemongrass**, **nettle leaf**, and **goji berries** to calm inflammation and support the gut
* Naturally sweetened with **stevia leaf**, so no added sugar

It was **vegan**, **gluten-free**, and only lightly caffeinated (around 18mg per bag), which worked well for me.

**How I used it and what happened each week**

I kept it simple. One cup of detox tea every morning, usually hot, but occasionally iced when it was warm out. I didn’t drastically change my meals or add workouts - just stayed consistent with the tea and took short walks most days.

**Week 1–2:**  
I wasn’t expecting results this early, but by day 5 or 6, I realized I hadn’t been bloated all week. Usually, I’m super uncomfortable by the evening, but I felt noticeably lighter and less puffy. My digestion also started to feel more regular.

**Week 3–4:**  
This was when my **energy levels started to shift**. I wasn’t crashing in the afternoon anymore, and I didn’t feel like I needed my second cup of coffee. I also started noticing fewer cravings for snacks and sweets. It was like my appetite had leveled out.

**Week 5–6:**  
At the end of six weeks, I had lost a little over 4 pounds - not water weight, either. My stomach looked flatter, and my clothes fit better. More importantly, I felt like I had momentum. It wasn’t dramatic, but it felt sustainable.

**Any downsides or side effects?**

I had none. If you’re looking for info on **detox tea side effects**, I was worried too, especially about digestive discomfort or urgency. But this tea was super gentle. No cramps, no surprises, no disruptions. Just make sure to drink extra water throughout the day.

If you’ve tried harsher teas before and had a bad time, this one was completely different. It supported digestion without being aggressive.

**Where I bought mine (important)**

There are a bunch of knockoff detox teas online, so I bought mine from the [**official website here**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JD9JH6F/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST). They had a 70% discount going when I ordered, and it showed up within a few days.

I also saved this [**backup link**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JD9JH6F/?uid=34821&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST) in case the main one doesn’t load.

**Final verdict: Does detox tea actually do anything?**

Surprisingly, yes - at least for me. It didn’t change my life overnight, but it helped me get back into a healthier rhythm. My digestion improved, bloating went away, my cravings dropped off, and I felt more energetic and focused.

If you’re already taking care of yourself but feel like something’s off, a high-quality detox tea might give you that extra push. Just avoid anything that sounds too extreme.

I’m curious to hear if anyone else has had results like this. Did you notice any real changes? Or if you’ve had a bad experience with a detox tea before, what went wrong? Let’s trade notes.",1,1748330369.0,HowToLoseWeightFST,0,1.0,False

# Introduction to Mirror Decorating

Mirrors have long been recognized as a versatile element in home decor, capable of transforming the ambiance of any space. Their reflective properties not only enhance aesthetics but also create illusions of depth and space, making smaller rooms appear larger and more open. By strategically placing mirrors, one can effectively expand the visual footprint of a room, allowing for a more spacious and inviting environment.

Furthermore, the use of mirrors can significantly impact the lighting within a space. By reflecting natural light or artificial light sources, mirrors can brighten darker areas of a home, providing a warm, welcoming atmosphere. This quality makes mirrors an excellent choice for [**Interior designers in Navi Mumbai**](https://www.home2decor.com/interior-designers-in-navi-mumbai/) who are seeking to enhance both functionality and style in their projects. Whether you're considering large statement mirrors or smaller decorative pieces, the right selection can drastically alter the mood and usability of a room.

The psychological effects of mirrors in interior design also warrant consideration. They have the ability to draw the eye and create focal points, adding interest to a design scheme. Moreover, mirrors can evoke feelings of tranquility and openness, contributing to an overall sense of well-being within the space. This is particularly crucial for luxury interior designers in Navi Mumbai, as they aim to cultivate serene environments for their clients.

As we delve deeper into the world of mirror decorating, we will explore various ideas and tips that embody the creativity and functionality of mirrors. From selecting the perfect style to integrating them seamlessly into existing decor, mirrors offer limitless opportunities for enhancing residential spaces. With insights from the best interior designers in Navi Mumbai, you will be well-equipped to utilize mirrors to their fullest potential in your home.

# Choosing the Right Mirror Style 

https://preview.redd.it/qt8ylbw8z93f1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e955ebda276fc2b108e7bbb3217aa50581224f70

When it comes to enhancing your space, mirrors serve not only a practical purpose but also a decorative one. Understanding the various styles available is essential for making an informed choice that aligns with your existing decor and personal preferences. Among the popular styles are modern, vintage, and artistic mirrors, each offering unique characteristics that can transform the ambiance of a room.

Modern mirrors are known for their clean lines and minimalist designs, often featuring geometric shapes. These mirrors are typically framed in materials such as metal or wood with a sleek finish, making them ideal for contemporary spaces. When considering modern styles, it's crucial to select a piece that harmonizes with other elements in the room, such as furniture and color schemes. For instance, a round modern mirror can soften the sharp angles often found in modern decor, providing balance. These sleek styles are also increasingly popular in [**bathroom interior design ideas**](https://www.home2decor.com/modern-bathroom-designs/), where functionality meets aesthetic appeal.

On the other end of the spectrum, vintage mirrors exude charm and character. They often come adorned with intricate frames made from materials like distressed wood or ornate metal. This style works particularly well in eclectic or traditional settings, adding a touch of nostalgia to the design. When choosing a vintage mirror, consider the history and craftsmanship that goes into these pieces, as they can serve as conversation starters within your home.

Artistic mirrors take creativity to another level, featuring unique designs that often double as artwork. These mirrors can be found in various shapes, sizes, and materials, allowing them to serve as focal points in a room. When selecting an artistic mirror, it is vital to consider how it fits with the overall theme of your space, ensuring it complements rather than conflicts with your current decor.

Frame material, shape, and size are essential factors in making the right choice. For instance, large mirrors can create an illusion of space, making them perfect for smaller areas, while smaller mirrors can cluster together to form an artistic arrangement. By carefully considering these stylistic elements, you can choose the ideal mirror that reflects your taste while enhancing your environment.

# Placement Tips for Maximum Impact 

https://preview.redd.it/l7kq19laz93f1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c7565a6756b19fb5bfab9f627c6125d66cb09da4

When it comes to decorating your space with mirrors, strategic placement is essential for maximizing their visual impact and effectiveness. Mirrors can enhance the flow of light and create a more spacious feeling, making them invaluable tools in interior design. To start, consider placing mirrors in common areas such as living rooms, bedrooms, and hallways, where they can significantly influence the ambiance.

In living rooms, position mirrors opposite windows to reflect the natural light, thus brightening the space and making it feel larger. A well-placed mirror can also highlight focal points like artwork or stylish furniture. For those considering hiring interior designers in Navi Mumbai, this type of insight is vital to achieving a beautifully balanced and inviting environment.

In bedrooms, avoid placing mirrors directly facing the bed, as this can create discomfort and disturbances during slumber. Instead, position mirrors on dressers or wardrobes, allowing for practical use while reflecting light from the room. You may seek advice from the best interior designers in Navi Mumbai, who can assist in selecting mirrors that complement the overall decor while ensuring optimal placement.

Hallways often suffer from a lack of natural light and can feel cramped. Placing a mirror on one wall can help create a sense of openness and brightness. Consider using long, vertical mirrors to give the illusion of height, further enhancing the space’s perceived dimensions. It is crucial to avoid common placement mistakes such as positioning mirrors where they reflect clutter or unattractive views. This type of strategic thinking is common among the top 10 interior designers in Navi Mumbai, who understand how to curate a pleasing aesthetic.

In conclusion, the effective placement of mirrors can transform your space, adding light and depth while creating a sense of harmony in your design. By keeping these tips in mind, along with guidance from luxury interior designers in Navi Mumbai, you can achieve a visually stunning and functional environment.

# Creating Focal Points with Mirrors 

https://preview.redd.it/fn4xio9cz93f1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a3db0f94989c7e727b3f5b967d9b261e3ace6973

Mirrors can serve as powerful tools in interior design, especially when it comes to creating focal points in a room. Using mirrors strategically helps to enhance the visual interest and functionality of a space. For instance, oversized mirrors can anchor a room—drawing the eye and making the area appear larger and more open. When selecting a large mirror, consider the shape and style that complements your existing decor to ensure cohesion. A well-placed oversized mirror acts as an artistic statement piece that captures attention upon entering the room. This concept is also popular in [**bathroom interior design ideas**](https://www.home2decor.com/modern-bathroom-designs/), where large mirrors not only elevate the aesthetic but also enhance lighting and create the illusion of a more spacious layout.

Alternatively, smaller mirrors can be grouped together to form a stunning statement wall. This technique allows for creative expression and adds texture and complexity to your interior. When arranging smaller mirrors, aim for a balanced layout that avoids overwhelming the space. Consider varying the sizes and shapes of the mirrors to introduce visual diversity, but ensure that the overall arrangement remains coherent. This approach not only amplifies the light in the room but also creates an inviting atmosphere, making it a favorite technique among top 10 interior designers in Navi Mumbai.

Achieving balance is crucial in any home decor, and mirrors should be used to harmonize with other furnishings. For example, if you have a heavy, dark furniture piece, a large mirror with a light frame could provide contrast and maintain balance. Luxury interior designers in Navi Mumbai often highlight this principle, ensuring that mirrors contribute meaningful reflections rather than simply serving as decorative accents. Ultimately, mirrors, when used skillfully, can enhance the aesthetic appeal of your space while fulfilling practical purposes such as brightening dark corners and expanding visual depth.

# Mirrors as Functional Decor: Practical Uses 

https://preview.redd.it/gyh8456ez93f1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e890ed2ae4221a055b36f5520bdc1a5c571e8311

Mirrors serve a dual purpose that extends beyond mere decoration; they can significantly enhance the functionality of a space. One of the most common places to utilize mirrors is in entryways. A strategically placed mirror in this area allows for quick checks of one’s appearance before leaving the house, making it a practical addition to any home. This can be particularly beneficial for households with busy schedules, where a swift glance can save time and ensure individuals are ready to face the day. By incorporating mirrors into entryways, interior designers in Navi Mumbai can create a welcoming yet practical atmosphere.

In dressing areas, mirrors are indispensable for daily routines. Full-length mirrors are particularly favored as they enable users to view their entire outfit, helping in making informed fashion choices. This functionality becomes even more prominent in homes with space constraints, where designers can employ mirrors to create an illusion of openness. The reflection not only helps in dressing but also contributes to the aesthetic appeal, ensuring that the area remains stylish while being functional. Therefore, when seeking the [**best interior designers in Navi Mumbai**](https://www.home2decor.com/interior-designers-in-navi-mumbai/), consider their approach to integrating mirrors in ways that maximize utility without sacrificing elegance.

Moreover, mirrors can play a role in enhancing natural light within spaces. By positioning mirrors opposite windows, the amount of light reflecting around the room can be increased, resulting in a brighter, more cheerful environment. This is particularly important in luxury interior design, where ambiance and atmosphere often dictate the overall success of a space. Utilizing mirrors to amplify lighting can transform a dim room into a vibrant area, demonstrating just how versatile these decorative pieces can be. As such, including mirrors thoughtfully throughout your home can effectively meet both practical needs and aesthetic desires.

# DIY Mirror Decor Projects 

https://preview.redd.it/bpd2crmfz93f1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=014d4a59494d5f4c06f3b09eef6347f7bd62120e

Creating your own mirror decor projects is an excellent way to infuse your personal style into your space while also maximizing the impact of light and openness that mirrors provide. Here are two engaging DIY projects that can transform your home with minimal investment.

First, consider designing a mirror gallery wall. To start, gather an assortment of mirrors in different shapes and sizes. You can find affordable options at thrift stores or garage sales, or even repurpose old mirrors you may have stored away. Plan your layout on the floor first to see how the mirrors will interact with each other visually. Ensure a cohesive look by selecting frames that complement one another. Once satisfied with the arrangement, use adhesive hooks or picture hangers to affix them to the wall. A gallery wall of mirrors not only serves as a stunning focal point but also reflects light, making your space appear larger and brighter.

Another interesting project is refurbishing an old mirror. If you have a mirror with a dated or damaged frame, consider giving it a fresh look. Start by removing the mirror from its frame carefully. Clean the frame thoroughly and sand it down if necessary. You can then apply a fresh coat of paint or stain to match your current decor. To add a touch of personalization, you might embellish the frame with decorative elements such as beads, shells, or even a unique pattern created with washi tape. Once the frame is dry, reinsert the mirror, and hang it up in your desired location. This DIY project reflects your creativity while enhancing the overall aesthetic of your home—and it works especially well as part of [**bathroom interior design ideas**](https://www.home2decor.com/modern-bathroom-designs/), where a customized mirror can bring character and charm to the space.

In summary, engaging in these DIY mirror decor projects not only allows for enhancement of personal spaces but also contributes to a unique atmosphere. Whether you choose to create a gallery wall or spruce up an old mirror, incorporating these reflective elements can greatly elevate your home’s design.

# Using Mirrors to Elevate Small Spaces 

https://preview.redd.it/13rq1q3hz93f1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=359ef693b8ef20bac688d96d0bb8ff4fe4ef2e34

In the realm of interior design, the thoughtful application of mirrors can dramatically transform small spaces, creating an illusion of expansiveness and light. This technique is widely embraced by interior designers in Navi Mumbai, known for their innovative approaches and keen awareness of spatial dynamics. A strategic placement of mirrors can either reflect light or serve as focal points that draw the eye, effectively making a compact room feel more inviting.

One common strategy employed by the best interior designers in Navi Mumbai is to position mirrors opposite windows or light sources. This not only amplifies natural light but also minimizes the feeling of confinement often experienced in smaller rooms. For instance, in a narrow hallway, a large mirror at the end can create a visual pathway, making the space appear longer and more open.

Another practical approach is utilizing mirrors in multifunctional furniture. Designers often recommend mirrored cabinets or coffee tables that combine storage with the optical illusion of increased space. This is particularly effective in small living areas where maximizing functionality is key. Additionally, incorporating a mirror in a bathroom can enhance both light and aesthetics, an approach employed by luxury interior designers in Navi Mumbai to elevate the overall ambiance of the space.

When it comes to angles and placements, consider the room's layout. Placing mirrors at varying heights can add dimension and intrigue. For example, a vertical mirror on a wall combined with a round one slightly angled can create a dynamic visual interest, making the area feel fluid and less limited.

When incorporating mirrors into your decor, especially in homes designed by the best interior designers in Navi Mumbai, safety and maintenance become paramount. Mirrors can enhance the aesthetic appeal of a space, but their breakable nature requires careful handling. It is crucial to adhere to specific guidelines during installation to prevent accidents. Always ensure that the wall where the mirror will be mounted is sturdy and can support the weight of the mirror. Use appropriate hardware designed for the mirror's size and weight, such as brackets and wall anchors, to guarantee secure placement. If you’re unsure, consulting top 10 interior designers in Navi Mumbai may provide additional insights into proper installation techniques.

Once installed, maintaining the integrity and appearance of mirrors is essential. Routine cleaning should be done using a soft, lint-free cloth along with glass cleaner to avoid scratches. It is advisable to avoid harsh chemicals that can damage the reflective surface over time. In humid environments, such as bathrooms, fogging can be a common issue. To counteract this, consider applying anti-fog treatment or using a squeegee after showers to maintain clear visibility. Such maintenance tips are commonly recommended by [**luxury interior designers in Navi Mumbai**](https://www.home2decor.com/interior-designers-in-navi-mumbai/), ensuring that your mirror decor continues to shine beautifully.

Moreover, keep an eye out for signs of tarnishing or deterioration, especially around the edges. This can occur due to moisture or poor ventilation in the room. If such issues arise, it may be worthwhile to consult with professional interior designers who can advise on repair options or, if necessary, recommend sustainable replacements. By taking these safety and maintenance measures, you can truly enjoy the elegance of mirrors in your space for years.

No doubt there are grammatical errors, and it's out of order, forgive me.","I opened the bedroom curtain a few inches and saw blue sky. Looking north, I could see dark clouds over the mountains. Tree branches swayed from an aggressive breeze, and I thought, “Good.” The breeze would force the clouds over town in the next few hours. Hopefully, it would rain and drive everybody inside. I noticed that my neighbor’s Jeep was still gone. Thank God, one less thing to think about. She was gone most weekends, and I knew I’d have at least another 24 hours before she might come back.

I sat on the couch in the living room and stared at the sunlight shining on the bedroom floor. I knew if I touched the floor, it would be warm, and if my dogs were here, they’d be lying in the warmth, absorbing the heat and loving every minute of it. That’s if they weren’t trying to paw at the basement door, trying to investigate the smells in this old house. They’d scratch the bottom of the door and look up at me, expecting me to open it like I’d done for them thousands of times, but these stairs were steep and dangerous for their small bodies.

I sipped coffee from my big yellow Camp Crystal Lake mug. I remember happily shelling out $15 for a 20-oz size because I love '80s slasher films, and I love my morning cup of joe. Joe. Ugh. I shift uncomfortably and wish I hadn’t used that name. Anxiety bloomed in the pit of my stomach. I don’t want to think of him, but I will for the rest of my life. This was our spot, our love shack. I think of my Joe, and feel love, sorrow, and regret.

We met through a dating app. At first, I used the free version, but I couldn’t see the person who “liked” me. I couldn’t resist knowing more, so I paid for a month. The deluge of interested parties was overwhelming. I scrolled through thousands of men, not choosing any of them. I paid for six months and kept scrolling and scrolling. There were too many to choose from.

I considered men my age, but I figured they’d be set in their ways, which was a deterrent. I didn’t want rigidity; I had already been there and done that. I wanted something different. I didn’t want one that was too good-looking because they get passed around too much. I didn’t want a pilot or one of the “off-grid” guys. I didn’t want a braggart. Didn’t want a religious guy. I definitely didn’t want one on the rebound. There was a lot of no, no, no.

I wanted fluid, malleable, energetic. I tried many flavors before my marriage, so I knew my preference. I would choose a throw-away because I just wanted to have fun. I finally liked a few, but only one messaged consistently. His answers were one-dimensional, which made me suspect idiocy. It was confirmed by the end of our first meal together that he wasn’t sharp, and he probably completed school with an IEP. I took him back to my hotel room anyway.

That’s where the trouble started. He might have been stupid in one area, but he wasn’t in another. I loved how confident he was, and I loved the way he touched me. I wondered how he came by his experience; it was shocking that anybody gave him a chance to practice. He smoothed his hands over my skin and grabbed my rolls like it didn’t bother him at all, like he loved it. It was a breath of fresh air. That level of comfort was foreign, and I wanted my fill.

Despite our age gap, we ended up dating exclusively. I didn't mean for it to happen; it just did. We biked, hiked, and took long car rides. It was like stepping onto a big, fast carnival ride – I felt danger and excitement. I experienced frisson every time he touched me, and I could tell he did too, because his body would react with an uncontrollable shiver. It was endearing, and I didn’t think about how quickly something like that could turn to disgust. I quickly realized that he shivered with every sexual thought.

I’m pretty sure I quit thinking about a week into dating, and just went with the flow.

He lost his job not too long after we met. He’d been drinking with his colleagues after work one Friday. His mentor accidentally hurt him, and the group started laughing at Joe. Joe got mad, and violence ensued. I get it though – it sucks to be laughed at and not everyone can handle being the laughing stock. Red flag. I ignored it.

I had a decent job with a not-for-profit, and we had a department that helped people down on their luck. I set him up with an appointment for resume writing, and he got a new job in only a couple of weeks. He could tell that the person who helped him was attracted to him, so he found her online and messaged her. She wasn’t much to look at. She probably didn’t get a lot interest and jumped at any opportunity. Regardless, that bitch ignored all professional boundaries, and engaged in an inappropriate relationship. I found everything on his phone during one of his drunken nights. I edited the number and slightly changed her name. I confronted him. He made excuses and blocked her on social media. I ignored it.

He loved to drink. I have never been much of a drinker because my body doesn’t metabolize alcohol very well. I normally avoid it because of the allergic reaction. Our levels of drinking didn’t match, but our smoking did. I smoke weed when life is overwhelming, and it's been overwhelming for a while.

I started smoking a lot when my birth mother and my adopted mother died within a year of one another. I had a tumultuous relationship with them, and I thought that I was fine with their passing, but I wasn’t. Then my brother died during COVID. I held his hand in the hospital. I had to wear gloves, and I was masked and in a gown. He was in a coma, and his hands were cold. I was in literal disbelief when he passed. It didn’t feel real.

There was immense grief, and I smoked to combat it. I didn’t want those feelings to drown me. I didn’t want to feel the intensity. There were a lot of negative feelings, and I was mad at my mothers. Like, how dare you fucking die on me when we have unresolved beef. I was mad at my brother for the alcoholism that led to his death. I started grief therapy and phased out after I had the tools to manage the grief. The grief didn’t go away, it became manageable.

I processed the death of my birth mother in a normal manner, but when my adopted mom died, I watched the same movie over and over again. This went on for months. I loved that movie, and although it wasn’t a sad movie, I cried during a certain scene every single time. I must have watched it a hundred times. Looking back, it was so weird, even though there were a million other shows, it was the only thing that I could watch. I had no interest in any other show.

Anyway, I was trying to complete school at that time. In my fourth year, I got a full-time job, so I was working and going to school full-time. My decades-long marriage had been on the rocks for a while, and it officially ended around my final semester. It was tough, but I powered through. I finished school and earned two degrees. I didn’t feel joy, I felt relief – relief that it was over and I could focus on just the job. I cried for a week after my last class ended. I don’t know if it was from exhaustion or because I had lived through so much loss.

So, that’s where Joe found me. In a vulnerable place, ready to step out and leave the sorrow behind. We spent our honeymoon phase traveling and camping, eating, laughing, smoking, and drinking. My body was flooded with dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and oxytocin. I would think of him and cry from overwhelming feelings of love. He sang, and he did it beautifully. Once, we were driving down the highway, and he sang a worship song – ‘I Surrender’ that made me cry. I knew our relationship wouldn’t last, and I mourned the loss of his singing.

When we went out, he consumed a lot more than I did. He didn’t have a lot of disposable funds, so I paid for most everything. I get mad every time I think about that. I’ll never make that mistake again.

During our relationship, I learned that he had been honorably discharged from the military – a medical separation. He lived in the Lower 48 with a filthy rich girlfriend, but it ended badly because of alcohol. He spent some time living in his car, dating whoever came his way – illegal immigrants, single moms, old women, you name it. Red flag. I ignored it.

One night, he met these two young women and partied with them. They were mad at their boyfriends and were messaging them about hanging out with Joe. They all got drunk but weren’t going to put out, so Joe did something that scared them. I don’t know what; he never elaborated. The girls called their boyfriends and the police. Joe ran. The police found him “sleeping” in his car and pulled him out, only for Joe to attack them. He was allowed to finish his probation here in Alaska.

Our first year together, he got a DUI. He lost his new job, and was put on probation. We lived at his mom’s because I couldn't bring strange people into my children's home. Joe's adult sisters also lived there. The mother is an enabler, always making excuses and forgiving of their shortcomings and discretions. Even if they’re wrong, they’re right. Joe and his mom have a close relationship, and she hated me but tolerated me because she loves him.

Some mornings, he would sneak upstairs and knock lightly on her door, then crack it to let her know she was late for work. She talked about how she slept naked without a blanket because of menopausal night sweats, so I was uncomfortable with him opening her door in the morning and told him so. It never stopped him. He’d even stand on his tiptoe and look in. Why didn’t she ever lock the door if she were sleeping naked? Why would he open the door if he knew she slept naked?

Every family dynamic is different, but it was strange to me that the whole family of adults lived together. My siblings and I moved out and got our residences when we grew up. I thought that was what normal families do because I don’t know of a single family that stuck together in the same house through adulthood. I spoke to him at length about getting our own place, but he was resistant. I told him he was a grown man and needed to act like an independent adult.

One night when I was sleeping, he stole my car to go drinking down the road. I didn’t find out about that until later. He kept a lot of nefarious actions well hidden. I finally put my foot down about getting a place after his first cousin came to stay for two weeks. I could tell they were attracted to one another. He shivered every time they touched. I called him out, and he yelled, “I just met her!” Then he kicked me out until she left. He wouldn’t shut up about big boobs for a month after her visit. I told his mom about it, and she got mad and yelled that he was just as sick as his dad. Red flag. I ignored it.

Joe had kept his drinking to a minimum during probation, but the second he got off probation, he started up again full bore. Recently, he went drinking with his cousins and was imprisoned for assaulting them. He will never stop. He can’t control himself. And his family will always enable him.

All these red flags, and I acted blind. What an idiot, Jesus. In all my years, I'd never been assaulted by a romantic partner. Raised voices were a normal reaction during stressful situations, but there had never been violence.

I stopped smoking a while back. I used it as a crutch during the hardest times of my life, but I had been working on my mental health for years, and I could work through my issues in healthy ways. I can have a beer with dinner and stop after one because it is a complementary beverage to the meal.

Joe and I began growing apart. I didn’t want to put myself through more trauma in the name of love. I can’t support my partner’s bad habits, but I could certainly support myself and pay my half. I want to travel. I don’t want to drink; I don’t want to smoke. I want to spend New Year in New York, I want to summit mountains, I want to go have pasta in Italy, I have dreams. I told him all this, and it led to an argument. I asked him why he has to always be on something. Alcohol, weed, nicotine, caffeine, always something.

After the fight, I felt bad and went in for a hug. He used to play sports, and he pushed me with everything he had. I’m 5’2” and 150lbs, he’s 5’11” and 240. I went flying halfway across the room. That was the first time in my life that my limbs were out of my control. I had read the words before – ‘flying halfway across the room’, but I couldn’t imagine it until it happened. I didn’t know that you’re in the air and you can’t control your body. 

I landed on my ass with a thud. I immediately started crying and said, “I was going to hug you! Why did you do that to me?!” He said, “I didn’t know what you were doing. I thought you were attacking me.” And he turned around and left me in the room. I stood there like a dumb ass, crying. I didn’t know what to do. I sat on the bed and looked down at the floor, weeping. After a while, I ran out of tears and went to grab my things from the living room. He made me drive him home.

I didn’t talk to him afterwards, but he texted eventually. He came back into my life. I had been working out and lost a noticeable amount of weight. He commented on my double chin turning into a turkey neck. I was shocked. What kind of person says that sort of thing? When he backhanded my neck to see it jiggle, I swung on him. We duked it out right there in the car. He turned his body towards me and started trying to kick my ribs. That didn’t work well because he was too big, so he squeezed my body against my door. He threw my purse onto the highway. Passersby were honking for us to get off the road, I put the car in drive, and dropped him off. He apologized profusely and begged for forgiveness. I was numb.

It took a while, but he wormed his way back into my life. I was that stupid. My therapist said it stemmed from childhood abandonment issues, and we spent session after session working on it.

Again, I found messages from another woman. A single mom asking him if they could still be fuck buddies even though she knew we were back together. I sent her pictures of us, and she started going off about him oversharing. I saw that he had been messaging another person on social media, and he said that I was a “crazy ex”, so I messaged her and asked, “Is she a crazy ex, or do I just try talking to a lot of women?”. I had no shame, no standards, no self-respect, no self-love. I let him, his mom, and sisters shit on me. I shit on myself for allowing it.

My closest friends knew about some of it. They couldn't believe that I allowed any of it to happen. They encouraged me to seek legal help. They were patient with me, and loved me when I wouldn’t love myself. They were there for me when I opened up, they supported me as much as I would let them. I wouldn’t have survived without them. I love my people. I never reported anything. I preferred to keep my life private. Anybody else would think we were a cute couple in a May-December romance.

Anyway, Joe and I went on a grueling bike ride early this morning, while it was still dark. There was a short downhill area, and while we coasted, he was talking about his favorite big boob cousin. I saw him shiver. I asked if she was still bi. He casually commented, “No. And I think all gays should die…your kids are all gay.” Something snapped in my mind. When people say, “Oh, she snapped.” That’s a real thing, there was a literal snapping feeling in my head. I looked at him, but didn’t say anything. I biked home, and he followed me. I set a fast pace, and he struggled to keep up. I felt a mean satisfaction. He was a weak ass bitch.

The house is mostly empty now. I signed a new lease and moved my things from the Love Shack over to a new unit. I told Joe he could store his belongings in a storage unit because he wasn't coming with me. I don't think he believed me. I was really choosing myself, I was choosing my kids, I was choosing my friends. He demanded all my time for years, and I wasn't allowed to see my people.

I bought a dolly and used it to pack boxes across my yard. I did it all myself because Joe couldn’t be bothered to help. He was busy sitting on the couch, on his phone, probably messaging people with little to no standards. I don’t know who, I don’t care anymore. My neighbor offered to help me haul, but I declined.

I got home and peeled off my sweaty clothes. I got ready to jump in the shower. Joe undressed to join. I let him wash my sweat off. He used his big, strong hands to massage me a little. Then it was his turn to be washed. I told him to put his arms down. He tipped his head back to let the water cascade down his front.

I had a knife on the towel rack. It was a Nakano that my ex-husband bought me when I was going through a knife phase early in our marriage. I didn’t want Joe to touch it because he breaks everything he touches. He never washed the towels, I did, so I knew he wouldn’t touch my knife if I kept it on the towel rack.

I took the Nakano in my right hand. I used my left hand to massage Joe’s left shoulder and worked my way to the top of his head, and grabbed his forehead. Quick as a cat, I drew the Nakano across his throat. He dropped his chin and clutched at his neck. He fell back against me. I was strong now; I tripped him forward onto his knees and used my weight to hold him down on the shower floor.

The blood flow was impressive, but it didn’t last long. The gurgling scared me a little. The spatter on the shower walls wasn’t bad. When the thrumming stopped, I stood and washed the blood from my arms and legs. I turned off the water and stepped out of the tub. I dried off. I grabbed my Mercer butchering set from the kitchen and went to work in the bathroom. I worked naked for easier cleaning.

It’s a good thing I had built my strength because it was surprisingly hard to work through the joints. I propped the pieces meat-side down for draining. I washed off again. I grabbed the empty suitcases in the bedroom and propped them open. Later, I would place the body pieces into heavy-duty garbage bags inside the suitcases. I triple bagged.

He fit into two suitcases, one extra-large and one large. I put the head in an oversized vintage carry-on bag that I had never used before. The color was lilac, I won it at an auction years ago, and was happy I finally found a use for it. I moved him downstairs to the basement in case my kids decided to drop by and check on me.

Back upstairs, while sipping my coffee, I saw the chips on the rim of my cup and was glad that Joe wouldn’t have any opportunities to break more things. He did the dishes and broke a lot of them. I decided to leave the cup behind and buy a new one. Maybe I’d go with a Xenomorph this time.

Finally, hours and hours later, when traffic slowed and it was getting dark out, I used the dolly to take the suitcases and carry-on to the rig. I loaded everything in the back and hit the highway north. I drove three hours and stopped at the Hurricane Gulch parking lot. It was late by then. I sat for an hour watching traffic. It was sparse. Only two vehicles went by in that time. I decided to chance it. I used the dolly and moved as fast as possible to the middle of the short bridge. I opened the bags and dumped the pieces over the edge. Let the bears and wolves have him. I ran back to the car. I was sweating profusely. My heart was pounding. I cried. No one saw me. I was pretty sure the bags didn’t have any blood on them, but I’d stuff them with bricks and throw them in the ocean anyway.

I got home and texted Joe’s mom asking if he had been out there the night before. I told her that he got drunk and left after dinner, but forgot his phone at home. I’m sure they’ll miss him after a while. I miss him already. I’ll keep in contact with them until they make a report. The police won’t have anything to go on, he’ll become another missing man in Alaska. One of many unsolved mysteries that happen here. The world is a safer place without him.",1,1748330043.0,stories,0,1.0,False
1kwh0gc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cholesterol/comments/1kwh0gc/how_i_fixed_my_cholesterol_with_oats_and_being/,How I fixed my Cholesterol with oats and being super lazy,"**TLDR**: eat oats. Or drink oats. I just replaced one meal a day with some kind of oat based protein shake, dropped LDL from 160 mg/dL to 91 mg/dL with next to zero effort and no further changes. Recipe described in the post. Hope it can help people.

*More details about my journey*

Last year I got tested with a LDL at 160 mg/dL which the doctor said was mildly high. I was shocked because I'm skinny (my ignorant ass thought only overweight people get cholesterol). I was not doing exercise, my diet was kinda bad, lot of delivery food, restaurant food, I never cooked, not much fruit/vegetables.

I decided to start swimming 3 times a week and to improve my diet a lot, I ate very little meat (I was nearly doing a pescatarian diet), more vegetables, tofu, fatty fish, nuts, no delivery food, no fast food, no pastries, no milk. Cooking with olive oil. 2 month later my best reading was 120 mg/dL which is better but still high. I continued and tested every month, continuing the regime I ended up stuck in the range of 120 mg/dL to 130 mg/dL (I tested every month) which is still borderline high. When I ate some non heart healthy foods on a business trip (HK dim sum, had to try it) I quickly bounced back to 140 mg/dL. 

Anyway I got into a minor motorbike accident and injured my leg, stopped swimming. I got tired of cooking because I'm single, lazy and just want to play video games when I get back from work. It was hard to keep the diet because I'm borderline underweight and meat, cheese and carbs were the easy calories source. My diet started to slip and I wanted to limit the damage, I also needed a low effort solution - typically low effort means food delivery or fast food which is not good... I started to research pre made food like Soylent but it's not sold in the country I live in (Vietnam).

I decided to research how to do the ultimate ""heart healthy"" easy meal tailored for someone like me who is near underweight and wants to maintain caloric intake.

* as little preparation effort as possible (can prepare in less than 5 minutes) 
* as little perishable foods as possible, I don't want to do groceries often
* no cookware, only 1 thing to clean max, again, I'm lazy
* covers most basic nutritional needs
* something drinkable, portable, can consume quickly and conveniently
* is good for cholesterol (goal is to drop LDL)

After some research (thanks GPT), the ideal was do some type of vegetarian protein shake. Blender only prep. Recipe ended up being:

* half of 1 cup rolled oats
* 1 banana
* 1 scoop soy or pea protein powder
* 2 tablespoon flax seeds
* 2 tablespoon peanut butter (100% peanut no added oil)
* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
* unsweetened oat or soy milk
* I add some ice cubes or water if it's too thick

Just add everything to the blender, blend for 20 secs, boom - easy. The taste is quite ok. I started to drink that almost every night unless I go out. During lunch I eat food that I wouldn't qualify as very heart healthy (ramen, rice with meat, latte, etc).

After a month I tested my cholesterol, since I dropped exercise and my diet is not nearly as good as when my reading was 120 mg/dL (for lunch) I expected a bad reading because my lifestyle is basically the same as when I was at 160 mg/dL except I replaced dinner with the shake, I literally had mc donalds this weekend. I'm drinking coffee with condensed milk on the regular, etc. I just hoped it would limit the damage. 

To my surprise I dropped down to 91 mg/dL which is way better than when I had a good diet and regular intense exercise. I guess lack of soluble fiber was the problem for me. Really happy with that because this new regimen takes literally no effort and I feel I can maintain it so easily.

Anyway I hope it helps people, happy to respond to comments. If people are interested I can post my full lipid profile evolution. If you're reading this, even years later and you try it and end up with results good or bad don't hesitate to message me I'm curious whether it works for other people.

I picked a relaxed Sunday afternoon, with coffee brewing (cause who doesn't feel a bit more at ease with a cup in hand?), and honestly, it worked wonders.

I opened up about something that had been bugging me for a while, and to my surprise, it wasn't as scary as my mind had built it up to be. I think it helped that the vibe was chill, and I wasn't diving straight into the heavy stuff right when we both got home from work, you know?

So, idk if anyone else is kinda avoiding a convo like that, but maybe try setting a calm stage—it might just help ease the nerves. It was a little scary but felt super brave after, like my own quiet brave moment. 💪 Anyone else have tricks for facing these tough talks head on?

I've been ""brewing"" on this thought lately and wanted to get your ""grounds"" on it. We've all got our ways to ""digest"" books – physical, e-readers, audiobooks. 
But what if there was a different kind of ""blend""? Imagine if the key ideas from books weren't just narrated, but turned into more of an interactive audio ""conversation."" Think less like a lecture, more like you're ""overhearing"" a really engaging chat about the book's big ideas, maybe guided by a couple of distinct voices that help you explore the tastiest bits and prompt some ""aha!"" moments.

It got me wondering, if you could get a book's main ideas in, say, 20-30 minutes through this kind of chatty audio, would you see it mainly as an ""efficiency shot"" – just getting the good stuff fast? Or would the ""conversational"" and ""interactive"" flavor make it more about sparking deeper thoughts and curiosity, like savoring a good slow brew, even if it takes a similar amount of time to a quick summary?

And what’s the real ""perk"" (pun intended!) of having ideas ""percolate"" in an audio dialogue like that, with different perspectives prompting you to reflect? Does that ""blend"" make complex stuff easier to ""digest"" or feel more engaging than just a straight-up narration? Could this kind of format – making knowledge feel more like a shared ""coffee klatch"" – actually help us ""brew"" up new ways of thinking or make those ""heavy roast"" topics feel more approachable?

After a bit of chaos last round with the loss of the only promising new rookie in Simpson, there is little reprieve as we find ourselves in the first of the Bye rounds which for many may be a struggle.
Although we are beginning to see a silver lining with the fall of some high priced premium options, we may need to look a little deeper into these selections given differing upcoming match-ups, tag risks, and some possible role changes. The question asked of us is whether to bring in some decent players this week, or save some cash to ensure we can afford some key players over the next couple of weeks (Bont + Butters) who are out with the R12 Bye.


*DEFENDERS*


**Wanganeen-Milera - 515K**, the second son of the STK backline presents outstanding value this week thanks to playing through injury against WCE in round 10, and even in the event that he misses his BE of 118 this week he shouldn't fall in price by any significant amount. Not only is the run home for STK is great, playing MELx2, RIC, ESS, NTH, he looks to be scoring reasonably consistently despite the experimentation with a midfield role, and he reassuringly took the majority of the kick ins last week. He would be a great selection for anyone looking to upgrade the injured Z Reid for minimal expense, however he has a Bye next week which may make him a more ideal trade in target in round 14 if you can afford to wait.


**Holmes - 519K**, similarly priced to Wanganeen-Milera but a less reliable scorer, Holmes would be a great trade in option this week given that not only should he have a ceiling score against WCE, but he also has a great run home and doesn't have his Bye until round 16. He's a real shot to go 130+ this week given he's playing WCE in Geelong and Smith may be out leaving Holmes as the primary target for transitioning the ball through the middle of the ground, which would make him a decent captain option on a Sunday game if your VC doesn't pan out.


**Whitfield - 566K**, many players who didn't start Whitfield in their sides would have been looking on all season in despair, wondering how they would eventually be able to bring him in. Thanks to a shocking game with a score of 82 last week, this week or next might be the time it's doable. The question, and the risk in the pick, lies in why he scored so poorly last week and what that means going forward. The decimation of the GWS midfield with injuries has seemingly precipitated some position changes, and Whitfield was played more up the ground last week. This had a number of relevant scoring consequences: 1) no kick ins for the first time since 2022, 2) twice as many handballs as kicks (when usually the reverse is true), and 3) 3 free kicks against (possibly just variance or perhaps due to role unfamiliarity). With McMullin and Kelly potentially back in this week or next, he might hopefully be able to make his return to the backline. Whitfield would be an excellent trade in if we knew he was moving back to defence, but I would keep an eye out for the team sheet and where he trains during the week prior to bringing him in.


*Speculative Defence Picks*


Probably none this week, but one should be on the radar.


**Coleman - 269K**, did just well enough with a decent role in his return game from a long term injury two weeks ago and was managed last week. If he's selected this week and scores 90+ against ESS, he should be one to consider for inclusion next week as a decent on field scorer that should easily make 120K+. I've included him here because he could be one to bring in if you need the 150K+ gain from trading Roberts/Reid down to him but would still like a decent on field scorer.


*MIDFIELDERS*


**Heeney - 530K**, backed up his performance from the week prior and maintained decent CBAs while being a favoured target when the Swans go forward. He still has a low BE (68) and 6 easy matchups to go before season's end, so Heeney would be a great value inclusion at this price and could finish in the M7-10 range, and he's a decent POD at only 8% ownership.


**Daicos - 536K**, an absolute steal for a player of his calibre, Daicos showed he was back to his best in the second half against NTH, hopefully putting to rest the concerns about his capacity to play through injury. This is the week to get him ahead of upcoming games against HAW/MEL/STK/WCE/CAR unless you've made the brave call to anti-POD him.


**Miller - 541K**, is shaping up to be the Jordan Clark of the midfield, except instead of 105 he scores 110. He's appropriately priced at 541K so doesn't exactly provide value, but if you're looking for reliable this week then Miller is your guy.


**Merrett - 553K**, a bargain compared to his starting price of 621K and he's not likely to get much lower with a BE of 109. Merrett has had highly variable scoring this year owing to tags and injuries in the team occasionally pushing him forward, but he has demonstrated his uber-premo ceiling with three scores 145+ this year. On player quality alone he would be my pick for best inclusion this week (providing you have Daicos), and this is despite what looks to be a difficult run home with potential tags coming in 5 to 7 of his remaining games. 


*Speculative Midfield Picks*


One of these is not like the others.


**Steele - 522K**, has been remarkably consistent for the previous few weeks with a 3 and 5-round average of 111. He could be a decent POD (only 1% owned!) to fill your final midfield slot at a bit of a discount, and has an exceptional run home, but unfortunately has the Bye next week so the timing isn't super.


**Rowell - 485K**, we're looking to be in the ""We're So Back"" stage of the ""We're So Back"" --> ""It's So Over"" --> ""We're So Back"" loop, and his 485K price point might make it seem worth the gamble to some. I would avoid as many have been burned by this selection before, but he's an interesting Hail-Mary pick if despite your best efforts you're losing ranks playing safely.


*RUCKS*


At present it looks like the ruck pecking order is the two big guns in Xerri and Gawn (both priced at 731K), then daylight, then Jackson while Darcy is out, then more daylight, then the rest.


**Jackson - 584k**, Darcy didn't pass the fitness test last week and Freo may choose to rest him this week to give him a good window to recover fully before returning in round 14 after their Bye. This means Jackson probably has at most one week of decent scoring this week before he's sharing the ruck role and otherwise moved out of the centre, and the only data point we have this year in this role was his score of 64 in round 8, and last year while sharing the ruck role he averaged a score of 80. I probably wouldn't bring him in on the basis of this anticipated low scoring for the remainder of the season.


*Speculative Ruck Picks*


Bravely Bring Big Briggs In.


**Briggs - 393K**, I was initially hesitant to include Briggs here given his run of terrible scores in rounds 5-9, however he seems to have worked through his ankle concerns and put up respectable scores over the previous two weeks. Reassuringly, of his next 7 matches, 6 are reasonably easy to score against in the ruck. I don't love it as a selection, but if you're wanting to jump off the TDK train on his bye, you could bank 140K here and hopefully not loose out too much on points. The trouble is that he's not a keeper, so you would have to hope he builds up to ~500K and then you'd still need to find the cash to upgrade him further at the end of the year.


*FORWARDS*


See above in the ruck section for a discussion on **Jackson**, I wouldn't pick him in the forward line at this price either.


**Pickett - 500K**, is currently the 6th average scorer for forwards. We normally would try and avoid small forwards or key position forwards who are reliant on goals to score well, but Pickett has shown the capacity to average 20 disposals and has maintained respectable CBAs for the majority of the season. While his best scores have been his 5-goal games, he still has demonstrated a decent 90 average in his games with fewer than 5 goals. If you need a forward this week he is the only one I would be considering unless you want to pay up for **Martin - 568K**.


*ROOKIES*


It's almost comical at this point how unlucky we (and the players, of course) have been with rookie injuries and exclusions this year. While the loss of Simpson stings, he was brought in by almost all competitive sides so we at least are all dealing with the same issue. It's slim pickings this week with regards to rookies on the bubble, but hopefully the midseason draft will bring in a few gems to buff cash generation in the latter half of the season.


**Gray - DEF/FWD - 119K**, this week's Chosen One is a bit of a softer pick - he played well out of defence last round with a good number of spoils and intercepts, but only really looks to be in the side when Balta is out for … Personal Reasons, and Balta looks to be available for selection for the next 5 weeks. There's a decent chance he's dropped or starts as the sub, so keep an eye out for the teamsheets as this may be another in the long line of dead rookies.


**Clarke - DEF - 113K**, superb debut on the wing with 3 goals to accompany 16 disposals, 8 marks, and 3 tackles. Given the ever-growing injury list at Essendon, we can be optimistic that Clarke can keep his spot in the side and should make some decent cash. This was only his first week so we have the luxury of seeing how he fares against a much better side in the form of the Lions this week, but if he stays in the team he will be a must have next week. If Gray isn't selected then we should bring in Clarke instead (unfortunately Essendon play on Thurs and Richmond on Sat, so we won't get to know if Gray is the sub before we have to decide between Gray and Clarke).


**McAuliffe - MID - 287K**, has scored ridiculously well for his price over the previous two weeks with scores of 96 and 97 against NTH and ESS. This has been in the context of his role as the third-ranked player in CBAs for those games, with ~60% CBAs. If he keeps the scoring up above 80 he could go up over 100K in 5 games, and if he manages a spike score then he could reach the 100K much faster than this. There are two issues here, however, 1) he's playing significantly more challenging opponents than WCE/NTH/ESS, and 2) Dion Prestia had a good return in the VFL on the weekend, and Prestia was the third-CBA player when he was in the Richmond side last year, meaning he's likely to displace McAuliffe from the CBAs if he's selected. McAuliffe may well be another Ned Long type, where he had a good few full games but most didn't select him due to concern he'd be pushed out of the midfield to make way for returning players, but perhaps more likely he'll be another low scoring rookie with a shaky role over the next few weeks once Prestia is back. If he was 100K cheaper he would be an obvious first-rate selection this week, but I would probably hold out and only consider him if Prestia isn't named in the side.


**S Neale - FWD - 290K**, despite being in his fifth year in the system he's only really now entering his second year as a key role player. The standard mantra is to avoid selecting key position forwards due to their reliance on goal scoring, and it probably stays true for Neale despite some being tempted by a score of 126 following a 5-goal game. The one glimmer of hope here if you're looking to make a gamble on a quick cash play is that he has WCE, GCS in Geelong, and Essendon over the next 3 weeks and it's feasible that he backs up last week's performance with 3 good scores and goes up 100K. It's also feasible (and perhaps probable) that he shits the beds and you've wasted two trades. But hey, 751 people have already traded him in for this week and maybe they're ~~tanking~~ on to something.


Please let me know what your thoughts are on the options above, if there's any other trade targets you're considering, and if there's anything else you'd like to see in these write-ups.",6,1748329378.0,AFLSupercoach,2,1.0,False

Let's be honest, the thrill of travel often comes with a side of anxiety, and a huge chunk of that anxiety is directly tied to airline tickets. Staring at those fluctuating prices, wondering if you should buy now or wait, feeling that sickening lurch in your stomach when the price suddenly jumps – it’s enough to make anyone want to just stay home and rewatch old travel documentaries. But the world beckons, doesn't it? The smell of foreign spices, the sound of unfamiliar languages, the breathtaking landscapes you've only seen in pictures. To experience all that, you've gotta crack the code of finding the best airfares. It ain't always easy, folks, but with a little know-how and a decent helping of patience, you can absolutely snag some screaming deals. We're about to embark on a quest together, a deep dive into the murky waters of online travel agencies, airline websites, and everything in between, all in the pursuit of those sweet, sweet deals. So buckle up, buttercup, it's going to be a bumpy but hopefully rewarding ride.

Decoding the Enigma: What Exactly Constitutes the Best Airfares Reviews?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

When we talk about ""best airfares reviews,"" what are we *really* talking about? It's more than just the lowest number you see on a comparison site, trust me. Sure, price is a huge factor, arguably the biggest for most of us. But think about it for a second. Is a super cheap flight at 2 AM with three layovers in questionable airports truly the ""best"" if you arrive utterly exhausted, irritable, and maybe even a little bit germ-ridden? Probably not. The ""best"" airfare is a delicate dance between cost, convenience, comfort (within reason, we're talking economy here, not a gilded cage!), and reliability. It's about finding that sweet spot where you get the biggest bang for your buck without sacrificing your sanity. A good airfare review, then, isn't just a numerical ranking of prices. It's a holistic evaluation that considers all these factors. It's about understanding how different platforms stack up, which ones offer the best search tools, which ones hide those sneaky fees until the very last click, and which ones actually offer decent customer service when things go south (and let's be real, with travel, things can and sometimes do go south). It's about getting the inside scoop from folks who have navigated these digital labyrinths before you, learning from their triumphs and, more importantly, their tribulations. So, let's peel back the layers and see what makes a truly insightful ""best airfares reviews.""

### Beyond the Sticker Price: What Reviews Should Really Be Assessing

Forget just looking at the big number. That's like judging a book solely by its cover. A truly valuable review digs deeper. It's about the nitty-gritty, the stuff that can make or break your travel experience. Did the website crash repeatedly during the booking process? Were there hidden fees that popped up at the last minute, turning that ""great deal"" into something decidedly less appealing? How was the customer service when you had a question or needed to make a change (heaven forbid!)? These are the things that matter. A good review will touch upon the ease of use of the platform, the transparency of the pricing, the clarity of the terms and conditions, and yes, the responsiveness of their support team. Think of it like dating apps for airfares. You need to know more than just a pretty picture and a catchy bio. You need to know if they're reliable, honest, and responsive when you actually need them.

Here are some key elements a comprehensive review of airfares should thoroughly examine:

- **Price Accuracy and Hiding Fees:** This is the big one. Does the initial price you see reflect the final cost? Or are there ""convenience fees,"" ""baggage fees"" (even if you're just bringing a tiny carry-on!), or other sneaky charges added on later?
- **User Interface and Experience:** Is the website or app intuitive and easy to navigate? Can you easily filter results by things like layover duration, airline, or departure time? Or do you feel like you need a degree in computer science to even find the search bar?
- **Flexibility and Change Policies:** What are the terms and conditions for changing or cancelling your flight? Are they clearly laid out, or buried in a mountain of jargon? Are the fees exorbitant?
- **Customer Service and Support:** How easy is it to get in touch with someone if you have a problem? Are they helpful and knowledgeable, or do you feel like you're talking to a brick wall?
- **Additional Features:** Do they offer useful extras like price alerts, flexible date searches, or the ability to book hotels and rental cars alongside your flight?
- **Airline Reputation (When Booking Directly):** If you're booking directly with an airline, what's their track record like? Are they known for delays, cancellations, or uncomfortable seating?

Navigating the Digital Jungle: The Best Airfares Reviews in the Wild West of Online Travel
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The internet is a vast and wondrous place, full of possibilities, especially when it comes to finding flights. But with so many options out there – the big aggregators, the individual airline sites, those niche travel blogs – it can feel like a digital jungle. You're hacking your way through a dense forest of competing offers, each one vying for your attention, promising the moon (and maybe a free bag of peanuts if you're lucky). This is where good ""best airfares reviews"" come into their own. They act as your machete, clearing a path through the undergrowth, pointing you towards the most fruitful spots, and warning you about the potential pitfalls. They're like experienced guides who have traversed these digital landscapes countless times, and they’re willing to share their hard-won wisdom.

### Aggregators, OTAs, and Digging Deep: Where to Find Reliable Reviews

So, where do you *find* these valuable reviews? They're scattered across the internet like digital gold dust. You've got the big hitters, the online travel agencies (OTAs) and the flight aggregators, and then you've got the grassroots approach, the travel blogs and forums where real people share their real experiences.

1. **The Big Aggregators/OTAs (Think Google Flights, Kayak, Skyscanner):** These are often the first stop for many travelers. They pull data from a multitude of airlines and other travel sites, offering you a bird's-eye view of options. While they're great for comparing prices, their own review sections can sometimes be a bit…sparse. You might find star ratings, but detailed, nuanced reviews are less common. Still, they're essential for getting a baseline and understanding the market.
2. **Dedicated Review Sites:** Websites that specialize in reviewing travel services are a fantastic resource. They often have professional reviewers who put the platforms through their paces and provide detailed breakdowns of their findings.
3. **Travel Blogs and Forums:** This is where you get the unvarnished truth, the nitty-gritty details you won't find on official sites. Look for personal narratives, photos (if possible!), and honest opinions about the booking process, customer service, and overall experience. Just be mindful of potential bias; sometimes folks are sponsored or have affiliate links, though many are genuinely trying to help fellow travelers.
4. **Airline-Specific Reviews:** If you're considering booking directly with an airline, look for reviews specifically about that carrier. Sites like Skytrax or even general review platforms like Yelp can be surprisingly insightful.

Remember, a single review is just one person's experience. Look for patterns, read multiple reviews from different sources, and try to get a balanced perspective. It’s like getting dating advice; you wouldn’t rely on just one friend’s opinion, would you?

The Perils and Pitfalls: What Can Go Wrong When Chasing the Cheapest Flights?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ah, the siren song of the rock-bottom price! It's alluring, intoxicating, and sometimes, downright dangerous. Chasing the absolute cheapest flight without doing your homework can lead you down a rabbit hole of frustration, unexpected costs, and even missed vacations. Think about it; if it seems too good to be true, it probably is. Those unbelievably low prices often come with strings attached, strings that can quickly turn your dream trip into a logistical nightmare. This is where understanding the potential pitfalls comes into play, and where ""best airfares reviews"" that highlight these issues are absolutely invaluable. They're like a friendly warning sign, helping you avoid the banana peels scattered along the path to cheap flights.

### Tales of Caution: Hidden Fees, Lagging Systems, and Non-Existent Customer Support

I've heard stories (and maybe even experienced a few myself, though I'll plead the fifth on the specifics!) of travelers booking what they thought was an amazing deal, only to be hit with a cascade of extra fees at the airport – baggage costs that were way higher than expected, seat selection surcharges they didn't anticipate, or even fees for printing their boarding pass! Then there are the frustrating experiences with clunky, outdated booking systems that crash mid-transaction, leaving you in limbo and potentially missing out on a good price. And perhaps the most infuriating of all, the phantom customer support, the black hole you send your queries into, never to receive a response.

Here are some common pitfalls to watch out for when you're on the hunt for the best airfares:

- **Hidden Fees:** This is the classic trap. The price looks great until you get to the final checkout page and suddenly see charges for things like ""processing,"" ""service,"" or even ""fuel surcharges"" that weren't clearly disclosed upfront.
- **Restrictive Fare Rules:** Those super cheap fares often come with very little flexibility. Changing your dates or cancelling your trip might be impossible or come with fees that dwarf the cost of the original ticket.
- **Lagging or Glitchy Websites/Apps:** Imagine the frustration of finding an amazing price, only to have the website freeze or give you an error message right as you're about to book. Not fun.
- **Poor or Non-Existent Customer Service:** If something goes wrong – your flight is cancelled, there's a schedule change, or you have a billing issue – you need to be able to get in touch with someone who can help. Reviews that mention unresponsive or unhelpful customer service are a huge red flag.
- **Baggage Allowance Confusion:** Make sure you understand the baggage allowance for your specific fare class and airline. What seems like a cheap flight can quickly become expensive if you have to pay hefty checked baggage fees.
- **Third-Party Booking Issues:** While OTAs can be great for comparing prices, sometimes resolving issues with a booking made through a third party can be more complicated than dealing directly with the airline.

The Tools of the Trade: Exploring the Platforms Promising the Best Airfares
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The world of travel booking is a crowded one, with countless websites and apps all vying for your business. From the massive, well-known aggregators and online travel agencies (OTAs) to smaller, more niche players, it can feel overwhelming trying to figure out which platform will actually deliver on its promise of finding you the ""best airfares."" This is where the conversation about ""best airfares reviews"" gets really interesting and practical. It’s about understanding the different types of tools available to you and which ones have a reputation for getting the job done. Think of these platforms as different workshops, each with their own set of tools and techniques for crafting the perfect travel itinerary at the best price. We need to identify which workshops are reliable and which ones might be using rusty, ineffective tools.

### A Rundown of the Usual Suspects: Google Flights, Kayak, Skyscanner, and Beyond

Let's pull back the curtain on some of the most popular platforms that consistently appear in ""best airfares reviews."" These are the heavy hitters, the ones most travelers turn to when they start their search.

- **Google Flights:** A perennial favorite, and for good reason. Google Flights is incredibly fast, has a clean interface, and offers some fantastic features like the ability to easily see how changing your travel dates or nearby airports affects the price. It's a beast when it comes to price comparison and often pulls in options that other sites miss. Reviews often highlight its speed and flexibility.
- **Kayak:** Another veteran in the space, Kayak aggregates prices from tons of different sources. It has a user-friendly interface and offers helpful tools like price forecasts (though take these with a grain of salt – they're not always spot-on!). Reviews often praise its comprehensive search capabilities.
- **Skyscanner:** Particularly popular for international travel, Skyscanner is known for its ""Everywhere"" search feature, which is brilliant if you're flexible on your destination. Reviews often commend its breadth of coverage, even for smaller budget airlines.
- **Expedia, Priceline, Booking.com (The OTA Goliaths):** These giants offer package deals (flights + hotels, etc.) in addition to just flights. While they can sometimes have competitive prices, they are third parties, and resolving issues can sometimes be more complex than booking directly. Reviews are often mixed, highlighting both good deals and potential customer service frustrations.
- **Momondo:** Known for its visually appealing interface and useful graphs showing price trends, Momondo is another strong contender in the aggregation space. Reviews often point to its thorough search results.
- **Niche and Budget Flight Finders:** Don't forget about platforms that specialize in budget travel or specific regions. While less mainstream, they can sometimes uncover hidden gems. Look for reviews of these platforms if you're targeting a particular type of travel.

When you're reading ""best airfares reviews"" of these platforms, pay attention to the specific features people highlight as being most helpful, the ease of the booking process, and their experiences with any issues that arose.

The Human Element: When to Trust a Friend Over an Algorithm
-----------------------------------------------------------

While algorithms can crunch numbers and scour the internet in seconds, there's something irreplaceable about human experience and advice. Sometimes, the ""best airfares reviews"" you'll find aren't on a glossy website, but whispered over a cup of coffee with a friend who just got back from an amazing trip. Real-world experiences, the kind that don't fit neatly into a star rating system, can offer invaluable insights and steer you towards or away from certain platforms or airlines based on factors that an algorithm simply can't measure. Feeling a little overwhelmed by all the data? This is when tapping into your network can provide a refreshing dose of reality.

### The Power of Personal Experience: Learning from Fellow Travelers

Think about it. Your friend who is a frequent flyer, always seems to find killer deals, and navigates airports like a seasoned pro? Their recommendation, based on their own trials and triumphs, is worth its weight in gold. They can tell you about the subtle nuances of a particular booking site – maybe it’s great for finding deals but has a notoriously slow customer service response time. Or perhaps they can share their experience with a specific airline, detailing how they handle delays or cancellations.

Here's why personal recommendations and anecdotal ""best airfares reviews"" from people you know matter:

- **Specificity:** Your friend can tell you about *their* experience booking a flight to a similar destination or under similar circumstances. This is much more relevant than a generic review from someone whose travel patterns are completely different.
- **Trust:** You trust your friends and family. You know they're not trying to sell you something (unless they're *really* trying to convince you to join them on vacation!). Their advice is likely unbiased and rooted in their genuine experience.
- **Details Beyond the Obvious:** They can share the little things that make a big difference, like the ease of checking in online, the comfort (or lack thereof) of the seats, or how friendly the flight attendants were. These are the details that often get overlooked in more formal reviews.
- **Real-Time Information:** A friend who just traveled can give you the latest insights, which can be crucial in the ever-changing world of air travel.

Don't underestimate the power of simply asking around! Post a question in a travel group on social media, reach out to friends who travel often, or even strike up a conversation with a fellow traveler at a bar. You never know where you might find that hidden gem of information that leads you to the ""best airfares"" for your next adventure.

Timing is Everything: When to Search and When to Book for Maximum Savings
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

We’ve all heard the folklore about booking flights on Tuesdays at exactly 3:07 PM for the lowest prices. While there might be a kernel of truth to some of these old wives' tales, the reality is a bit more nuanced. The timing of your search and booking can absolutely impact the price you pay, and understanding the general patterns and trends is crucial in your hunt for the ""best airfares."" This is another area where good ""best airfares reviews"" can provide valuable insights, sometimes even hinting at the best days or times to use a particular platform for optimal results. It's like learning the rhythm of the market, understanding when it breathes out and when it holds its breath.

### The Dance of Supply and Demand: Understanding the Rhythm of Airfare Pricing

Airline pricing is a complex and often unpredictable beast, heavily influenced by supply and demand, seasonality, holidays, and even competitor pricing. But there are some general guidelines that can help you navigate this intricate dance.

- **The Sweet Spot:** Generally speaking, the sweet spot for booking domestic flights is typically 1-3 months in advance, while for international flights, it's more like 2-6 months out. Booking too early or too late can often result in higher prices.
- **Avoid Holidays and Peak Season:** This is pretty obvious, right? Trying to find cheap flights for Christmas, New Year's, or during peak summer vacation is like trying to find a unicorn. Prices will be through the roof. If you have flexibility, consider traveling during the shoulder season (the periods immediately before and after peak season) or in the off-season for much better deals.
- **Mid-Week Travel:** Flying on Tuesdays and Wednesdays is often cheaper than flying on Fridays or Sundays, when business travelers and weekend warriors fill up flights.
- **Early Morning or Late Night Flights:** These less convenient times often come with lower price tags. If you can stomach a red-eye or an early departure, you might save a decent chunk of change.
- **Price Alert Savvy:** Utilize the price alert features offered by many aggregators and OTAs. This allows you to track prices for specific routes and be notified when they drop. It's like having a silent guardian watching over your desired flight.
- **Be Flexible:** This is the golden rule of finding cheap flights. If you can be flexible with your dates, times, or even your destination, you'll open yourself up to a wider range of lower-priced options.

Remember, these are just general guidelines. Airlines are constantly adjusting their pricing, and there can be exceptions to every rule. That's why staying informed, reading current ""best airfares reviews,"" and using price tracking tools is so important.

The Art of the Deep Dive: Unearthing Those Truly Exceptional Deals
------------------------------------------------------------------

Sometimes, finding the ""best airfares"" requires a bit more effort than just plugging in your dates and destination and hitting ""search."" It involves digging a little deeper, exploring unconventional options, and being willing to think outside the box. This is where the true travel hackers and budget savvy adventurers shine. They've mastered the art of the deep dive, unearthing deals that the average traveler might miss. And guess what? You can too, with a little guidance and a willingness to explore.

### Beyond the Obvious: Exploring Nearby Airports, One-Way Tickets, and Error Fares

Think of your search like panning for gold. You've done the initial sifting with the major aggregators, but now it's time to get your hands a little dirty and see if there are any hidden nuggets of value.

1. **Nearby Airport Strategy:** Sometimes, flying into or out of a smaller airport near your desired destination can be significantly cheaper than flying into the main hub. Factor in the cost and time of getting from the smaller airport to your final destination, of course, but it’s definitely worth checking.
2. **One-Way Ticket Tango:** Don't automatically assume that booking a round-trip ticket with the same airline is the cheapest option. Sometimes, booking two one-way tickets with different airlines can be more affordable. Compare both options!
3. **Connecting Flight Creativity:** Direct flights are convenient, but they often come with a premium price tag. Being open to flights with layovers, even multiple layovers (if you can stomach it!), can lead to significant savings. Just make sure you have enough time between connections!
4. **Error Fares and Glitch Pricing:** Very rarely, airlines or OTAs make mistakes in their pricing, resulting in incredibly cheap fares. These ""error fares"" are like finding a winning lottery ticket in the airfare world. They are rare and often disappear quickly, but keeping an eye on forums and groups dedicated to finding such deals can be worthwhile. Just be aware that airlines *can* cancel tickets booked at an obvious error fare, though they often honor them to maintain good customer relations.
5. **Airline Sales and Promotions:** Sign up for newsletters from airlines and travel websites. They often announce sales and promotions that can offer substantial discounts.
6. **Credit Card Points and Miles:** If you're a frequent flyer or have a travel rewards credit card, leverage your points and miles! This is a fantastic way to reduce or even eliminate the cost of your flight. ""Best airfares reviews"" sometimes even touch upon which platforms are best for redeeming points.

The Bottom Line: Making an Informed Decision Based on Best Airfares Reviews
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, after all this digging, comparing, and considering, how do you finally make the decision? How do you take all the information you've gathered – from the aggregated prices to the personal anecdotes and the deep-dive strategies – and arrive at the ""best airfares"" for *you*? It's about synthesizing all that data, weighing the pros and cons, and making a decision that balances price with your own personal travel preferences and priorities. There's no magic formula that works for everyone every time, but by being informed and strategic, you significantly increase your chances of snagging a great deal.

### Putting It All Together: Your Personalized Airfare Hunting Strategy

Think of yourself as the conductor of an orchestra, with all the different platforms, review sites, and personal insights as your instruments. Your job is to bring them all together in harmony to create the perfect travel symphony.

Here's a suggested approach to put all these elements into action and maximize your chances of finding the best airfares:

1. **Start Broad:** Begin with the big aggregators like Google Flights, Kayak, and Skyscanner to get a general sense of the prices and options available for your desired route and dates.
2. **Read Reviews with a Critical Eye:** As you identify potential flights or platforms, seek out ""best airfares reviews"" from various sources. Look for consistent themes, both positive and negative. Pay particular attention to reviews that touch upon the platform's ease of use, price transparency, and customer service.
3. **Check Airline Websites Directly:** Once you have a shortlist of potential flights and airlines, visit the airline's website directly. Sometimes, booking directly can offer better prices, different fare options, or more flexibility.
4. **Consider the Entire Cost:** Don't just look at the base fare. Factor in potential costs like baggage fees, seat selection fees, and the cost of getting to and from the airport. The seemingly cheapest flight might not be the best value once you add everything up.
5. **Be Savvy with Timing:** Use price alerts and be mindful of the time of year and day of the week you're searching and planning to travel.
6. **Don't Be Afraid to Experiment:** Try searching for nearby airports, one-way tickets, or adjusting your dates slightly. A little flexibility can go a long way.
7. **Tap Your Network:** Chat with friends, family, or online travel communities for their personal recommendations and experiences.
8. **Trust Your Gut (to a Point):** If a deal seems too good to be true, it might be. Do your due diligence and make sure you understand all the terms and conditions before booking.

Finding the ""best airfares"" is an ongoing process, not a one-time event. The market is constantly shifting, and what works today might not work tomorrow. But by staying informed, utilizing the available tools, and learning from the experiences of others (through those valuable ""best airfares reviews""), you significantly increase your chances of scoring a fantastic deal and making your travel dreams a reality. Happy hunting!

1kwgsgy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1kwgsgy/alleged_abduction_of_kenyan_mp_george_koimburi/,Alleged Abduction of Kenyan MP George Koimburi Amid Political Tensions,"On 25 May 2025, George Koimburi, Member of Parliament for Juja, was allegedly abducted outside the Full Gospel Church in Mugutha, Kiambu County, Kenya, by unidentified individuals and was found the following day, injured and unconscious, at a coffee plantation in Ruiru, approximately 10 kilometres away. He is currently receiving medical treatment at Karen Hospital in Nairobi.   
  
The National Police Service (NPS) is investigating the incident but denies involvement, asserting that Koimburi was under investigation for alleged land fraud and misuse of Constituency Development Funds, having evaded arrest on 23 May. The NPS also suggests Koimburi may have staged his abduction, though investigations continue to establish the facts. Koimburi, a vocal critic of President William Ruto and an ally of former Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua, was previously arrested in February 2025 for allegedly forging academic qualifications, a charge he denies.  
  
Opposition leaders, including Kalonzo Musyoka, condemned the abduction and expressed concerns about the safety of public officials, highlighting broader issues of political harassment. This incident follows a reported wave of over 80 abductions in Kenya since June 2024, which the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights attributes to state security agencies, though the government denies involvement.

Unknown:

“Damn it! Vance. I gave you one fucking thing to do.” A deep hiss erupted as I sat quietly in the dark corner of the hallway.

How did I end up so fucking lucky?

“What? Listen to Randy proudly banter about the next sitting King, and his whore of a Queen.” Vance hissed lowly in the back corner of the cell until he went in front of the Council. Just like his Uncle with his own fucking agenda.

“Yes. The whole fucking point of hiding Victor that entire time was so we did not have to deal with the next Lycan Royals.” I huffed at his arrogance as he shifted slightly leaning his arms against his knees.

“Hah. You talk like you know about Lycan’s.” Vance laughed darkly as he laid his head against the clean, soft grey stone wall closing his eyes like it was a vacation.

“Yes, I know more about them than you my young pupil.” I laughed deeply as Vance’s eyes snapped to mine from the dark corner.

“Now, not only do I have to clean up your mess with the Council, but now your Uncle also.” I laughed smugly as I stood up from the shadows, revealing my regal body.

“What do you plan Jonah?” Vance asked softly as he rolled his head sideways looking down the long corridor of darkness.

“Do not Fucking question me, you are in no position to question what will be done.” I hissed as I felt my blood boil in rage. Arrogant little bastard Fairy prick.

“Oh really? Maybe I should just tell the Council, or better yet, my dear Uncle of your plot to overthrow his throne and bask in the glory of being the Next Fairy King.” Vance laughed darkly with his smugness.

Hah. You want to play little fuckhead, let us play.

“How about this, making your dear sister my slave. Oh, the things I could do to that virgin body of hers.” I laughed darkly as Vance launched himself at the bars, reaching for me. Try and reach me you little peasant.

“You will not look at her, let alone think about her.” Vance hissed darkly as he glared at me with a murderous stare.

Oh, there is that fire I like about him.

“Do not make me laugh.” I huffed as I turned slowly to exit the hallway of the holding cells.

Hearing the defeated hiss of a breath being exhaled.

“Fine. What do you want me to do?” Vance huffed in defeat as he slid slowly down to the stone floor, looking at me with a side glance.

“Do not say a fucking word. I will handle this.” I huffed annoyed looking at him over my shoulder with a sinister smirk.

Dropping my head back as I breathed in the sickening sweet smell of the crisp air. Humming as I slowly exited into the Council Headquarters with its oppressive atmosphere. The time has come to handle things my way.

No more relying on others to get my Kingdom.

Jack:

Waking suddenly to the early morning sunrise, feeling an empty bed where Mei should have been sleeping. Scanning the room quickly for her beautiful face, but nothing awaiting my gaze.

“Shush, Nikola you will wake Micah.” Mei’s soft voice whispered through the baby monitor causing Brutus and Goki to purr gently.

Sliding quietly out of bed as I made my way down to the nursery, finding Mei walking quietly on the terrace. Nikola cradled gently against her chest as he gripped, suckling her swollen breast.

“Baby?” I linked as she turned slowly placing her finger up to her lips.

“He started fussing, so I was trying to avoid him waking Micah.” She replied as I walked quietly past Micah sleeping soundly in his crib.

Stepping up behind her looking down at Nikola lazily roll his eyes as he got his fill of warm milk.

“You could have brought him back to our room.” I said as I ran my hand up her back, feeling her muscles twitch under the thin silk material of her nightgown.

“I did not want to wake you.” She said as she looked over her shoulder up at me with her tired eyes.

“You need sleep too.” I said as I scooped Nikola up, patting his butt to burp him.

“I haven’t been able to sleep right. Every little noise wakes me up.” She said as she slipped into the bathroom to wash up.

“It is normal to be alert, especially with these little ones.” I replied gently kissing her cheek as I laid Nikola down to change his diaper.

Brutus and Goki stirring slightly. Hah. So much for our little deal. PUSSIES!!

“No, this is different JR. I feel like something is waiting in the shadows.” She replied leaning against the doorway as she watched me change Nikola like a skilled pro.

“Like we both agreed. We will handle whatever comes our way, never backing down.” I smiled softly, cupping her cheek with my free hand as we walked back in the nursery to lay Nikola down.

Lacing our fingers together as we slipped quietly out of the nursery, back into our room. She slid back into bed as I crawled in behind her, pulling her into my chest. Gently stroking her hair as her eyes fluttered closed feeling sleep creep back over my eyes.

“Jack?” Max linked. Groaning silently as I looked down at Mei sleeping peacefully.

“What Max?” I replied in a groggy haze.

“A delivery just showed for you.” Max replied laughing sarcastically hearing Seth in the background grumbling about something.

“Okay. Damian and Derek said they were sending something. I am going back to sleep.” I replied breathing Mei’s scent in as I awaited sleep to wash over once again.

“You need to see this.” Seth linked sounding questionable.

For Fuck Sake!

“Fine. I will be down.” I replied as I gently broke away from Mei’s warmth, sliding out of bed.

Protesting silently as I made my way across the room. Double checking before I slipped out of our room.

“Where are you?” I linked Max as I descended the stairs, running my hands through my messy hair, yawning like the king of the Jungle.

Brutus and Goki yawning as they shifted in the shadows.

“Grand hall.” Max replied laughing lightly with Seth.

Hooking a left at the ground floor, past the kitchen down the east hallway to the Grand Hall. Talking and laughing erupted from the large room as I stepped in stopping mid-step.

“What the Hell?” I exhaled darkly as I rubbed my face with both hands, rubbing around to my neck as I exhaled a deep breath.

“A chair fit for a King.” Brutus and Goki laughed loudly as I stood in silence looking at the massive hand carved Wolf throne of the First King.

“The picture did not do this justice.” Seth laughed leaning an arm against the massive six-foot-tall hand carved chair with a massive snarling wolf head at top.

“Fuck! How did it survive the collapse?” Max asked amused as he ran a finger over the detailed carvings along the dark Tiger Oak sides.

“The delivery driver was very curious about the crate.” Max laughed as he side glanced me with a perked brow, smiling evilly.

“Talk about making a statement.” I laughed darkly as I studied the chair, feeling the soft blue velvet upholstered cushioning.

“Aww, good it arrived.” Desmond laughed with a snarky tone as his heels clicked softly against the polished marble flooring.

“You knew about this?” Seth laughed asking with a shit eating grin.

Desmond smiled brightly nodding his head “yes” as he whistled turning towards the door as two Elites rolled in a matching throne, but more feminine.

“Mei will not like this at all.” Max huffed irritated as we all pinched the bridges of our noses.

Exhaling deep annoyance.

“These are only for formal gatherings, nothing more.” Desmond laughed as they positioned the Queens throne next to the Kings.

“Izzy is the same way. She hates having to sit in hers.” Desmond laughed lightly as he pulled the clear plastic covering off the throne, revealing the same Tiger Oak but lighter in color with purple velvet, instead of the Royal Blue of the King’s throne.

“Wait until you see the Crowns.” Desmond laughed as he motioned to his head, doing this weird Vogue gesture with his hands.

Heavy eye rolls as we all sat down on the stage ledge, relaxing briefly before loud roaring growls erupted through the house.

# Chapter Two

Jack:

“MEI!!!” We shouted as Desmond “poofed” us outside our bedroom door as the twin’s cries echoed through the hallway.

“Why are you in here?” Mei’s dark growling voice boomed through the hallway from the nursery as we rushed in, finding Mei holding a blond-haired man from the terrace railing.

“Forgive me your Highness.” The man gargled as his eyes met ours as Nikola and Micah fussed softly from their cribs.

“Mei, what is going on?” I asked on alert as I stalked slowly towards her shaking body as she held the guy from his throat, fixing to drop his ass.

“I came on behalf of the Fairy King to apologize for Vance’s behavior.” The guy huffed grabbing Mei’s hand gently as our eyes met.

“I do not trust you.” Mei huffed through gritted teeth as she threw his body to the terrace floor as she stepped back slowly, looking over her shoulder at us with bright Golden eyes.

“My apologies again. I am Jonah Star, head advisor to Fairy King Hilo.” Jonah stated as he kneeled, bowing his head.

“Are you okay?” I asked looking at Mei hold her fingers to her temples as she let out a deep breath.

“I do not know, but I do not trust him. Please take this somewhere else.” Mei linked coldly as she turned picking up a crying Micah, cradling him gently in her arms as she walked over to the overstuffed chair sitting down.

“Get Lexi, he has a block up.” Mei linked as she gently smiled as Izzy walked into the room, giving Desmond a soft kiss to his cheek as she scooped up Nikola calming his crying.

“Okay. You stay in here with the boys and Izzy. I will send up Rocko, and the twins.” I linked her as I walked over giving her a soft kiss to her forehead.

“Please join me in my office.” I said as I gently kissed the boys, turning sharply on my heel following the guys out leading a smug Jonah down to my office.

“Lexi?” I linked as the guys entered the office.

“Yeah?” Lexi linked back clinking something soft.

“I need you in the office, grab Eli.” I replied as I walked into my office walking around my desk, sinking into the large brown leather chair.

“Right. On our way now.” Lexi replied cursing in pain.

“Send Rocko, and the twins to the nursery.” I linked back.

Studying Jonah, his lean body, porcelain ivory skin with those pointy ears. His eyes were a soft green with blue swirls, positioned gently over a soft pointed nose and soft pink tinted lips.

A hard knock at the door as Lexi, and Eli entered the office handing me a cup of coffee, taking their seats looking at Jonah.

“Jonah let me introduce Eli, my Beta, brother and Lexi, Mei’s brother, and Tech specialist.” I said calmly as I pointed to each of them eyeing Jonah seated smugly on the sofa.

“Seth, my Gamma, his mate, and Tech specialist, Max. We all know Desmond.” I laughed as Jonah flashed a shit eating smirk, then a hard stare at Max.

“Jack, I get a bad vibe from this guy.” Eli linked as he dropped his head into his relaxed hand, staring gently at Jonah scan the office before clearing his throat.

“Why were you in the nursery?” I asked leaning forward as the guys shifted uncomfortably at the mentioning.

“My apologies for that. I thought my portal from Council Headquarters would drop me into the border, but I ended up in the nursery.” Jonah smiled slightly as he captured my eyes with his soft cold stare.

“You are lucky that you are still breathing. Mei is very protective.” Lexi laughed as he crossed his leg casually, sipping his coffee with a raised eye brow.

“Please do give her my apologies again. I understand she has been through a lot lately.” Jonah stated as his eyes dropped slightly to his lap.

Brutus and Goki stirred cautiously.

“Jack, he has a strong barrier up.” Lexi linked as he flashed me a quick side glance.

“Max do you have one of your tracking devises with you?” I linked catching his stare as he looked up from his coffee mug.

“Yeah.” Max laughed as he looked at Jonah.

“My apologies Jonah, but would you like something to drink?” Max asked as he stood up, stretching his body slightly flexing his tattooed muscles.

“Yes. Maybe something with a little more kick.” Jonah laughed smugly as he leaned back into the sofa back.

“Whiskey or Bourbon?” Max asked with a snip as he prepared a glass looking over his shoulder at Jonah.

“Bourbon.” Jonah hissed softly as he rubbed his temple like he was wasting precious time.

“So, you came all the way here from the Fairy Realm to pass on an apology. This must be serious.” I asked as I leaned back against the chair back, relaxing enough to let Jonah ease a little.

“Everything about this guy reeks.” Brutus growled lowly as Goki nodded in agreement.

“Yes. King Hilo, Vance’s uncle does not take it lightly when disrespect is shown, especially to the next sitting Crown Royals.” Jonah laughed lightly as he accepted the Bourbon from Max, which he laced with a micro tracking chip.

“I do look forward to meeting King Hilo, along with the other sitting Royals of the Realms. I already know Desmond and Izzy, so meeting everyone else will be a pleasure.” I said coolly as Jonah flashed me a small smile, nodding his head.

“Ella is a very prompt lady.” Eli laughed as we all snickered lightly at the image of her slamming Vance into the wall last night.

Jonah flexed slightly at the mentioning of her name.

“Oh, yes Ella. She is a sweet woman with a wild trigger.” Jonah laughed darkly as he sipped his Bourbon with a smug attitude.

“If I may give a bit of a warning, Ella is very good at playing the sweet woman role, but many of us at the Council find her motives questionable.” Jonah stated coldly as he caught everyone’s gaze.

“How so?” Seth asked leaning back with Max, sharing side glances with Desmond.

“Her views can be one sided, sometimes for the wrong reasons. We all know that her son died, while working the underground. Maybe he got in with the wrong crowd?” Jonah coldly stated as Max and Lexi both flinched at the mentioning of Astro.

“You suggesting that she was protecting someone?” I asked coldly as I gave the guys a hard glare over my coffee mug.

“Speculations. But how would someone like Victor and Aeros go unnoticed for so long.” Jonah hissed as he downed the rest of his Bourbon.

“This piece of shit is trying to point the blame at Ella.” Lexi linked as he looked casually over his shoulder at me with a twinkle in his eye.

“Well, if you will all excuse me, but I need to get back to the Council for Vance’s hearing.” Jonah huffed as he stood up stretching his lean body out.

We all stood up, shaking his hand as a polite gesture as he walked over to the wall drawing a symbol, producing the same blue portal as Randy did the night before.

“Until your Coronation.” Jonah said nodding to me as he disappeared into the portal, closing quickly behind him.

Before anyone could speak. I motioned for everyone to be quiet, while Max and Lexi swept the office for any bugs. Thumbs up indicating the room was clear.

“Are you fucking serious?” Desmond laughed as he sat back down, shaking his foot vigorously annoyed as Max and Lexi paced.

“This guy has some serious balls Jack.” Eli said as he stretched back in his chair, rubbing his hands down his face.

“I do not buy the whole “accidental” portal into the nursery at all.” Seth laughed darkly as he poured Bourbon into his coffee.

“I know one thing. Mei was right about not trusting him.” I said checking the camera footage of the nursery, seeing Mei rocking Micah while she laughed with Izzy, Rocko, and the twins, who were playing with Nikola’s little stomach.

“How are the Watchmen?” I asked looking over at Desmond smiling like a goof.

“Izzy has adopted them as her own. Dominic loves having four brothers to hang with.” Desmond laughed as he pulled out his phone reading a text message.

“Speaking of which, they are here. I sent them to the nursery to setup a barrier so no more “accidental” portals happen.” Desmond laughed as I watched Mei greet the guys as they went to work, setting up a hidden barrier.

A knock at the door as Dominic walked in with Rocko.

“Okay, something is up for him to text me, saying to grab the Watchmen, and head to the nursery.” Dominic darkly laughed as Rocko gave me a questioning brow.

“Whatever happened, Mei is not herself.” Rocko said as he leaned against the wall rubbing his hands through his hair, glancing at everyone’s body language.

“Lexi can you show him.” I asked watching Lexi nod as he walked over to Rocko placing his hand on his shoulder, closing his eyes.

Rocko’s eyes snapped open with a deep snarl as Lexi patted his shoulder.

“Right. I will make sure Xander knows to increase patrols, and I will add some extra security measures to the nursery.” Rocko said with a low hitch as he poured himself a Bourbon, downing it in one gulp.

“I do not like that he, or anyone for the matter, can portal into our territory.” I stated coldly glancing up from the computer screen as the guys silently muddled over this fact.

“Well, one thing is clear. Jonah knows something about Victor and Aeros.” Max laughed darkly as he dropped his head back against the sofa.

Everyone nodded in agreement to this statement.

“How long until the Coronation?” Eli asked looking over at me with a narrowed gaze.

“Two weeks.” Desmond laughed as he leaned forward placing his arms on his knees, lacing his fingers together.

“Right. So, two weeks we have extra eyes on the twins, and Mei. I have a feeling our new friend might have something up his sleeve.” I laughed darkly as I stood looking out the window at the morning painted sky, casting soft light against the bayou.

“Desmond what do you know about the Fairy King?” I asked looking over my shoulder at him smirk evilly.

“Hilo is a hard nut to crack, but he does like his outdoor activities.” Dominic laughed lightly as he looked at his father.

“Which is?” Eli, Lexi, and Max asked in unison.

Dominic and Desmond smiled with a bright twinkle in their eyes.

“You up to get muddy?” Dominic laughed as everyone shared raised eyebrows.

Brutus and Goki laughed darkly as images of ATV’s, dirt bikes, and lots of mud flashed in my head.

“Doesn’t Damian have trails in his territory?” Seth asked looking up at me with a shit eating grin.

“Not the kind I am thinking.” I laughed as I picked up the phone dialing Derek... ring…ring…hearing the click of the receiver, pressing the speaker button.

“Good Morning neighbor.” Derek’s dark southern accent rang loudly through the office.

“Morning Derek.” I replied as the guys listened casually.

“Question for you: How would you and Becca like to do some off-roading with Fairy King Hilo?” I asked listening to a loud squeal echo in the background.

“Does that mean this is business?” Derek laughed sarcastically.

“Let us say “fishing” and maybe personal wrapped into one.” I laughed back as I leaned slightly against the window wall crossing my arms.

“As long as we get to see those handsome twins of yours. Becca has been going baby crazy over here.” Derek laughed as a loud gasp, and loud smack erupted through the phone.

“Jack do not pay this man any attention.” Becca’s sweet southern voice boomed though the phone.

“Morning Becca.” Everyone sounded off at once.

“Morning.” She sung back in her southern drawl.

“How about this weekend we set it up. Desmond is texting Hilo as we speak.” I said watching Desmond typing with his thumbs as he looked up with a shit eating grin.

“Perfect. Bring plenty of toys.” Derek laughed as he hung up with Becca squealing in the background.

“Alright. That is settled. Round up our gear, and trailers. We are getting dirty.” I laughed as the guys high fived, fist pumping as a knock sounded at the door.

“Hey, did we just hear clearly about weekend plans.” Izzy and Mei smiled brightly holding the twins cooing in their own language.

“Yep.” We all responded popping the p.

“Hope you girls do not mind getting muddy.” Eli laughed as Izzy and Mei flashed him dangerous stares.

“First off, watch that tone of yours, and second, we are not your typical females.” Mei said as she walked over to Eli flicking his ear with a hard snap.

Laughter erupted as Eli sunk down in his seat. We all headed out to grab some breakfast, before we got back to business.",1,1748328633.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

Hello again everyone!

We’re Ksenija (27) and Filip (28), a couple from Serbia celebrating 10 years together. While visiting Japan – a lifelong dream of ours – we decided to skip the big wedding back home and have a small, meaningful civil marriage ceremony in Tokyo instead.

We also recently found out we’re expecting a baby, so this whole experience has become even more special for us ❤️

We’ve now received confirmation from Toshima City Office (Ikebukuro area) that we can register our marriage there – but we still need two adult witnesses to sign the form with us.

We’re kindly asking if anyone available on Wednesday (May 28), Thursday (May 29), or Friday (May 30) could help us out. The office is open 8:30 AM to 5:15 PM, but we were advised to come early in the morning to avoid long waits.

We know this is very last-minute, but if you’re free and willing, we’d be incredibly grateful!

We also received the necessary documents in advance, so we’d be happy to meet for coffee beforehand to go through everything and get to know each other a bit 😊

A small thank-you gift or compensation for your time is, of course, no problem.

Thank you so much for even considering it.

– Ksenija & Filip 💕

CHAPTER 1

""I GOTTA AGREE, Uncle Max,"" Jefferson Duvas beamed as he lay a heavy load off the van, ""This area is divine.""

The place made a mockery of his vampire status. If that's what the man really means to say. Maximilian Adenhart was neither thrilled nor upset about his new home. The large two storey apartment would be considered bare and bland once compared to his old house. It is what he needs at the moment nonetheless. He could not complain. Maximilian was never the type of person who loves grandiose. Although this place doesn't spark an intimate feeling with him, he didn't wince. He knew he wouldn't be here for long anyway.

The long and narrow road ahead was clean but dusty. Compared to the city three hundred and fourty miles from where he stood, the air doesn't have the abundant car emissions that he hated since he was a youngster. It was the least consolation of moving into the town of Little Maddison. The population was below two hundred houses. That explains why most prefers bikes and brief walks.

Maximilian didn't pay attention to the ride that brought him here. He remembered most of the establishments that the place offers though. The town had a small convenient center. Two bake shops and a small cafe. Some tailoring store and a daycare center that's willing to accomodate twenty small kids at best.

Maximilian thought this Little Maddison is the most peaceful town in the world. He liked the way people smile through the heavily tinted window of Jeffrey's van. They recognize a newcomer and they are willing to befriend him.

It's a first experience for him.

""Sir, you should talk more now that you're here."" Jeffrey sighed noisily. ""Your point has been brought to the elders and now you have your freedom! Oh jeez, if ever you're going to appoint a regent, please— please, don't advertise my name. That will crush me.""

Maximilian eyed his back. He couldn't believe that a vampire could sweat until he saw Jeffrey flinching under his stare. But then, the kid was a half mortal. It's not good to question his defective vampire characteristics. He clicked his tongue. Straightening the lapel of his suit, he drawled, ""So the reason why you chose to accompany me today was for this, huh, junior? You want to plead for leniency?""

""I'm not saying that being the head of the Adenhart coven is not an honor but sir, I mean, Uncle Max, this is not for me. I'm just twenty-five, okay?"" Jeffrey huffed. He still couldn't face Maximilian even when he's trying to disobey. Max thought of this as funny. Jeffrey's mother had always hated his guts to turn the ancient practices to more unconventional and practical habits. Seeing her son trying to reason cowardly to his Uncle Max gives him delight.

""I took over the coven when I got sixteen, kid.""

""Yeah?"" The guy was amazed but also horrified. Max was confused by his expression. ""Well, wow! Max, you're born for the crown. I am not. And I thought you shouldn't have concentrated that much on the coven for— like, 500 years. Look where did it get you now? No wife. No son!""

Max' tiny curve at the tips of his lips vanished in an instant. Jeffrey continues to blabber about his life before finally noticing that his uncle stood quiet all the time.

He gulped. Max showed him his perfunctory smile. He murmured, ""Tell your mother that this is a matter of consequence. I know she sent you to me in private so you can plead for your release from the clan, something I can't afford to give. Let me ask you this, kid, do you really want to live as a mortal?""

Jeffrey is a good kid. Maximilian wanted to have a kid like him someday. A fun-loving, cheerful child who knows when and where to show his fangs. The only fault he could find in Jeffrey is that the man couldn't say no to his mother.

Maximilian's older sister, Janette Adenhart, was hellbent on the idea of turning herself into a mortal. So much that when laboratory testings couldn't work, she decidedly married a mortal man. She wants to have a, according to her words, 'normal' kid. Max couldn't imagine her disappointment when Jeffrey started to turn at the age of sixteen. While the kid's father was happy, Janette became silent. It took a great while before Janette finally learned to love the kid. Especially when she found out that Maximilian had a liking to the boy.

Max didn't shy away from showing his favoritism among his nieces and nephews. He's the only Adenhart left with no children to call his own. Jeffrey was a pitiful child. Even when Janette send Jeffrey to scurry on his side, Max gladly accepted each gifts with unseeing eyes.

But this last request is unforgivable.

Janette wants to free Jeffrey from her kind while the kid wanted to secure a stable position in the coven. When Max came to realize Jeffrey's internal conflicts, he didn't bat an eye and agreed to be send off by him and him alone.

""I've always thought that you have an upright man as a father, Jeffrey."" Maximilian twisted his lips in a wry smile. ""What happened? How did Janette manage to make him agree?""

""You know how hardheaded mom can get sometimes, sir."" Jeffrey deviated from his overly casual voice and turned to a respectful tone. ""I'd… being a regent is a tad too burdensome for a person who scarcely had the experience. You thrived on the status for five hundred years. There's no way I can copy you for even a day.""

Maximilian leaned on the van. He looked to the side and saw his own pale reflection at the side mirror. He can only see his face in the morning. Maximilian doesn't know why and what happens but their reflections fade every night. Half dead and half alive. He blinked slowly. ""You're not arrogant to think you're worthy enough. That's good.""

""No… I don't plan to. I want to be respected and be trusted by our kind because of my own capability.""

Max frowned. ""You can start being an apprentice. I don't trust anyone at the coven but Cedric Mallory is a nice lad. Why don't you work under him for a month or two?""

""Make that three, sir."" Jeffrey stopped worrying over the boxes and positioned at Max' side. ""Wait, is he… is that Cedric specialized in paperwork?""

'Picky…' Max rolled his eyes. He struggled to think of the guy's line of work. ""What's there if he's in line with the papers? That's a harmless job.""

""Then make it a month only."" Jeffrey didn't answer him and said, ""Make it less than a week if that's possible.""

'Oh,' Maximilian jeered in his mind, 'he thought he can handle Mr. Mallory's strict rules?'

""Cedric Mallory specified in field work. He gathers intel, do major and minor hunt for the clan. You think you can handle that?""

""Of course! Make it... five months, then!""

Max grinned at his nephew's enthusiasm. He looked back at the house. ""Expect your appointment next day, kid.""

""Oh, God!"" he whined belatedly, ""Mom will kill me for this.""

Max scoffed. ""Let her come after me. Tell her I forced you or something.""

Jeffrey shook his head with a boot-licking grin. ""You're the best uncle even if the mortals often says we look like best cousins.""

Max only raised a brow. 'Who told you that?'

""Sir, how long do you plan to stay here?"" The guy attempted to distract Max from his statement before. He only shrugged then seriously considered his question.

In the end, he simply said, ""It depends.""

DOLLY CESARO's morning wasn't as bad as yesterday's. She woke up with no headache and chest pains. As much as she would like to shift and heal her internal injuries, she wouldn't risk arising Fin's need to hunt again at let herself lose a limb or two. Her rabbit shifter side couldn't appreciate Fin's wolf instincts. She always felt like an animal on the verge of running in a split whenever he is around. That's the reason why she persevered in applying almost every part time job 'til she's sick and bone-tired.

She needs an excuse to get away from him.

Fin had a problematic wolf soul. He gets violent on small issues and tends to break in a shift when he's threatened. Dolly asked him not to get out of their shared apartment. She works for the both of them.

Dolly still doesn't understand why her family joined forces to drive her away in her twenty-fifth birthday. She was contented on doing late night shifts and give them all her salary every Sunday just to help the men in the house provide food for everyone.

Dolly was the third among the ten sons and daughters. All of her siblings had married when they turned to seventeen. Only her three lovely siblings, age five to ten, are with her parents as of now.

She's hardworking, a dutiful daughter and a kind sister. Dolly wants to make them happy despite their dismay on her 'mate-less' life since she reached the age of twenty. Dolly thought no one liked her, and it's okay. She's fine living alone. A decision that her family never understood and doesn't accept.

When Fin came to their neighborhood, Dolly's father had given the guy permission to date her. The two never worked it out since Fin was behaving abnormally. He kept on twitching and grimacing. They couldn't talk properly.

It was a shock for Dolly when her father ordered five rogue wolves to chase her down. Luckily, she met Fin on the way and escaped with him.

Since then,  she lived in Little Maddison with Fin inside a small apartment with two rooms. It was quiet and serene, yet Dolly hated not being able to see her family.

She missed her younger brothers and sisters.

""Dolly!"" A middle-aged woman landed a calloused hand on her shoulder. Dolly stretched her lips in a sunny bright smile and greeted, ""Good morning, Pam!'

""Oh, you're full of sugar this morning, ain't you, darling?"" Pam smacked her lips. The big loop of earrings in her ear moved as she turns her head to the side to whisper, ""there's a new man in the curb, baby girl.""

Dolly laughed. She squinted her eye and teases the woman, ""Is he handsome? Do you like him?""

""Intense! The man was Poseidon in black, Dolly. He's wearing a custom-made suit under this hot weather."" She applauded. ""Lean, stark and unbelievably pale!""

'Lean and… unbelievably pale?' Dolly kept her mouth but thought, 'Wearing a suit in the middle of May. Was there even a man like that?'

She couldn't help but laugh.

# Chapter 2

CHAPTER 2

HE SHOULD HAVE guessed that Janette hated him so much. He stared at the junk of an apartment that the woman reserved for his small vacation from work. It was indeed bare and bland from the outside but for Lucifer's cry, the inch thick of dirt covering the living area tickled his innate demand for cleanliness. He wanted to order someone and tear the woman's prided garden now. 'Just so you wait, Janette. You towered over all demons and monsters!'

""Mr. Adenhart, you called me for help?"" The landlady smiled. Her gaze went past Max with a suggestive gleam. She stepped inside the threshold and immediately grimaced. ""Oh, mama... Jesus Christ, what devil resided in here on the past few months? I thought I had it all cleaned up!""

""Since when?"" Max curtly asked.

""Uh, I had this cleaned... five months ago?"" She laughed with unease. ""I mean, it's not like we have new residents here every month. At most I can only have… three to four tenants for a year. It's a waste to have everything cleaned up with no people to fill in. I'll only lose money and gain nothing for that.""

""I booked two weeks ago.""

The woman shook her head. ""Yeah, most people book earlier than that but in the end they decided to back out. That's why I do things at the very last moment so I won't be played at, yeah? I heard you're a businessman too, Mr. Adenhart. I hope you can understand me.""

Max heaved a breath and nodded with his face blank. ""Clean the place for me then. The money was deposited last week. When did you thought I would come, next year? As far as I know, that's not how you do business.""

The landlady was well versed in the situation. It was though this wasn't the first time that it had happened. ""As I've said, in a remote town like Little Maddison, most tenants would choose to back out once they saw the entire place. I'm really sorry for this. How about… you stay on the cafe shop two blocks from here and I'll have your apartment sparkly clean by dusk. It's good, yeah?""

'Yes. God really do hate us.' Max lowered his eyes to the watch on his wrist and nodded grimly. ""It's barely lunch and you wanted me to stay in a cafe shop for full six hours. That's feasible. I am ecstatic.""

""Ah!"" The woman sighed with relief. She choose not to notice his sarcasm. ""You're a good man. You can talk to Dolly the whole afternoon. She's a friendly woman, I tell you.""

'I went here to escape talking nonstop for work and now you want me to play a rational conversationalist? Not gonna happen.' Maximilian fixed his tie and set afoot to his journey in the new neighborhood. 'Cafe. Cafe. Cafe.'

""WELCOME TO DELI cafe!"" Dolly pleasantly beamed as she welcomed the fourth customer on that morning. It was a teenage girl with a large red beanie. ""Rika, how's your swimming class going on?""

""It was awful."" Rika threw her rucksack on the nearest chair before strutting to the counter. She complained, ""It was so noisy. Stella was being a bitch again and everybody just keeps on saying 'yes' to her whims. I hate it.""

'It was the usual stuff, then.' Dolly nodded her head earnestly. ""Don't mind her, Rika. I've seen that girl here a few times before. She seems like a good kid.""

""Oh, my God, Dolly! Don't be fooled by her large puppy eyes. She barks like a full pledged siberian husky, I tell you!""

Dolly laughed despite the mean things the girl had said. ""She knew how to dress 'properly'.""

""Who needs to dress 'properly' if we can have our own fashion statement? I love my loose pants. No one can take them away from me."" Rika sulked. ""A caramel frappe, please?""

""Hmn. Love that choice!"" Dolly turned to make her order. The girl stared at her back.

""There's a weird guy on the street,"" Rika started, ""he's dressed like a freak. But a handsome freak though. I think… I think I like him. His style is different from everyone else's.""

'The weird guy?' Dolly halted. 'It's been thrice since this morning that he's mentioned.'

""In this town, wearing a suit under a humid weather is considered wrong,"" she commented.

The wind chimes rung. Light steps entered the shop. A deep voice hummed before asking, ""Why is that?""

""Meep!"" Rika shrieked. ""Dolly, Dolly! You have to reserve this drink. I— I'll come back, I promise!""

Dolly called after her. She managed to put the straw in the to-go cup before looking to the stranger in front.

Now she understood why Rika didn't stop for a moment to snatch the bag on the chair before running away.

On his height of 6 foot and 3 inches, the man appeared strong and respectable in his black mourning suit. Dolly struggled to look away from his steel gray eyes and failed to notice how the man stared at her face with unflinching tenacity.

She shuffled on her feet. Dolly tried to smile but her mind shrank the moment she raises her sight to his face.

The sword-like brow suggested youth and vigor. His nose stood proud and mighty without the presence of a bump. His mouth, thin and pale pink, was straight as iron. It was obvious that he didn't like to smile.

""Hi…"" her voice sounded shy and excited. It almost drives her in shame. ""I'm Dolly. Wel— Welcome to Deli cafe!""

The man sighed deeply. Dolly became weary in just a flash. 'Am I too antsy?'

""You're a rabbit shifter?"" he asked. His voice quality mellow and soft. He knew that the question might rattle her. ""And a friendly one at that.""

""Yes."" Dolly took a step back and sniffed discreetly. The guy noticed her movement. His lips twitched but his entire demeanor remained guarded. ""Yes, I am indeed friendly. How did you know?""

""How did I know that you're friendly?""

Dolly scrunched her nose. The man laughed lightly. He looked up with an unbelieving face. ""God… should I thank you or not?""

She shrugged. ""A thank you is fine, although I'm not giving your orders yet. You're welcome!""

He snorted but the mirth was clear on his eyes. ""Hmn, I'm a vampire shifter named Maximilian Adenhart. And as for the drink...""

'Maximilian…' He got a nice name. Dolly tiptoed to be closer to him. ""Anything. I can make you anything.""

Maximilian's eyes squinted. A small smile appeared on his lips. ""Are you flirting with me?""

'He smells unique.' Dolly grinned. 'He had that strawberry-chocolate scent.'

""I'm not! That's not a good thing to do when you're working!"" She hesitated. ""It was your perfume.""

""I'm not using…"" Max' faltered but then leaned over and asked, ""What do I smell like?""

""Strawberries dipped in warm chocolate,"" she stated truthfully, ""really amazing smell.""

Max broke in a loud cackle. The sound tickled Dolly's chest. ""You're amazing. Then… do you know you smell like aged wine and oak to me?""

Dolly's mouth slacked. She defended, ""I don't drink so the smell of wine is not from me—"" She inhaled deeply and nearly whimpered because of the sickly sweet scent. ""You… there's only your scent around.""

Max swallowed and said deliberately, ""So… what do you think of strawberries and chocolate, dear?""

""Fin would like that,"" Dolly said as a matter of fact, ""he's a guy living with me. If your scent calms me then maybe it has the same reaction to him.""

""Fin…"" Max murmured. The light in his eyes dimmed. ""Can I have a black coffee, Dolly? The blackest possible, please.""

Dolly laughed nervously. She fumbled through the stacks of paper towels. ""That's bitter!""

""Are you close with that Fin? Why are you together?""

Dolly launched in a precise story while Maximilian took a chair from a set table and place it right in front of the counter. Dolly was pleased by his actions. She didn't know why but the need to secure the man and assure that he gets all his trivial needs sends a scratch on the soles of her feet. It warms her insides.

""…anyway, you're a vampire, right? So, uh, you don't feed on humans, right?""

Max shrugged carelessly. His pensive frown didn't fade after Dolly told him her escape. ""I feed on humans but you don't need to worry. I make sure that they are willing.""

'Willing?' Dolly stealthily snatched a handful of glances at him for a few times until she understood what he means to say. 'Willing victims? Of course! Who wouldn't be willing to you, Maximilian? Do you even own a mirror?'

Dolly's stomach soured on the idea. She hunched over the spotless counter and wiped it repeatedly. It was an endless cycle. She decided to ignore the guy as she make his order.

A cough made her jump. Max had moved from the chair to the counter. He leaned with an honest pair of eyes while saying, ""I stopped feeding from them eight months ago. I'm a five hundred year old bat. This one can go longer without blood.""

'Five hundred years old?' Dolly throw the knowledge at the back of her mind. ""Then… then that's great! Feeding on humans are bad.""

""Yes."" Max agreed with his soothing tone. ""Yes, that's right.""

""Especially when it's ladies' blood. It—It tastes bitter.""

Max chuckled. ""Yes. I agree. No more from now on.""

1kwgh0j,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1kwgh0j/my_23m_girlfriend_22f_suggested_that_infidelity/,My (23M) girlfriend (22F) suggested that infidelity can be justifiable. How do I express my concern without attacking her character?,"I (23M) have been dating my girlfriend (22F) for 3.5 years now. I love and adore her to death. In the last few months, I’ve started picturing a life with her.

This past weekend, she and I had a conversation that caused me to realize we may have different views on what justifies ending a relationship.

Her parents divorced long before she and I met, and she has never discussed it much so I never knew why until now. This weekend, I asked her point blank what happened between her parents. She disclosed that her mother cheated on her father when she was 12, and that she doesn’t like to mention it because it reflects poorly on her mother. This is a topic that is not frequently discussed in their family. Her mother doesn’t even know that any of her children know. Two of her siblings are unaware.

Normally, I wouldn’t let this impact my view of our own relationship. However, this information comes with 4 pieces of context that concern me:

1. Her defense of her mother: I understand trying to maintain a positive outlook of your parent, but in describing the cheating, she defended her mom’s actions by saying that her parents’ marriage was “not doing well for some time”, that her parents “almost never showed physical love” and that “her mom, like anyone would, had unmet needs”. This took me aback. To me, there is nothing that justifies cheating while you are still in a relationship, especially with a family of young kids. To the point about her parents’ relationship not doing well, she also described her father becoming incredibly upset following the cheating, so I imagine he felt there was still a relationship present at the time of the cheating. Seeing her defend or justify the cheating concerns me, because it suggests we have different definitions of what is crossing a line (or, she is at least subconsciously willing to justify it). 

2. The terms of her last relationship ending: when we met in college, I started flirting with her. At the time, I felt that it was welcome and reciprocated. We worked on assignments together late, and she became the girl in my class that I had a crush on. That’s what I found out that she had a high school boyfriend of 8 months. I stopped flirting. 2 months later, I found out they had broken up, and I reached out to her. Soon after, we started dating. My friends at the time warned me that this was a red flag. Her explanation was that the relationship was not very strong, and that they were mostly just friends who shouldn’t have been dating in the first place and were rarely intimate. Given how short their relationship was, this was had been a reasonable explanation to me at the time. Now, learning about the details of her parents divorce, i realize her explanation of how her relationship ended with her ex was incredibly similar to how she justified her mom’s actions with her father (two people who were very different, a lack of intimacy, etc). When we first met, she and I never had any interactions that were crossing an arguably friendly line, and to this day she denies flirting with me and thought she mentioned her boyfriend to me at the time. From what I know, her ex-boyfriend was/is still upset about how things ended and was very upset when he found out we were dating later on. This concerns me because I wonder now if her definition of a failing relationship was one-sided.

3. Her views on communication: during our same conversation about her parents’ divorce, I asked what concerns she has about our relationship (if any). She indicated fear of being ignored/lack of quality time in the coming years (as I am pursuing a career path known for intense hours/schooling). I told her that was understandable, and that I would do my best to spend more time if she expressed to me feeling ignored in the coming years. She responded by saying that she would give me signs but that the signs should be enough, and that if she had to ask for quality time then that defeats the entire point. I told her I disagreed. She seemed to double down. This concerns me, as I fear a situation where I might think I’m living up to the role of a good partner but might miss the “signs” that she drops, especially as careers get more busy.

4. A few strange interactions with other men: for a long time, she will go out to bars with her girl friends and tell me about any guys who hit on her. I used to think it was cute and playful, as she’d dress up nice and tell me about their attempts to flirt while trying to make me jealous. Her communication felt secure and open. Now, knowing she watched infidelity hurt her family, I can’t imagine why she’d be okay role playing a similar situation. More importantly, she became friends with an older male classmate of hers in the last 6 months who she’d get food or coffee with one-on-one from time to time. A few times, she’d get drinks with him and be out late. The most recent time, I called her out and told her that it made me uncomfortable. She became very apologetic and promised it was entirely platonic (which I trust) and that she would stop spending time with him. She really did seem to feel bad and saw him as a friend. I am certain he knows of me (I follow him on instagram, and she has told me some of the things he said about us as a couple, which are all supportive). Nonetheless, she formed a relationship that made me somewhat uncomfortable. The reason these examples concern me, however, is I wonder if she is prone to test boundaries through interactions with other men as a form of getting attention/making sure I stop her. 

All these details put together could be either side of the coin. Perhaps I’m over reacting: she was just a kid who’s lived a life rationalizing her mom’s actions and is very open and trusting now. She has never shown me anything but love and genuinely is kind and honest. On the other hand, perhaps she has radically different views on what will keep a relationship going, that places the onus on me to hold on to her. 

I’m scared of the latter. I need to trust that she will be honest about how she feels our relationship stands, and not takes one-sided actions that may end the relationship. I tend to love easily and see marriage, if possible, as a promise worth protecting at all costs. 

I know this is something I need to discuss with her, but how do I express my concerns without it sounding like “you told me your mom cheated on your dad and now I’m worried about our relationship”? What could I ask to help give me more clarity on how she thinks/where she stands? Are there other signs I should be looking for concern or relief ?",7,1748327704.0,relationship_advice,14,0.82,False

Energy drinks before work, pre-workout before the gym (even on rest days), and coffee just to “stay functional.” Over time, caffeine barely did anything for him anymore. No buzz, no motivation, just a baseline he couldn’t escape. Worst part? He was getting anxious, sleeping poorly, and his blood pressure started creeping up.

That’s when he decided to rethink everything. His goal wasn’t to quit caffeine — he actually likes the way it *can* help — but to reset his tolerance and make it work *for* him again.

Here’s what he changed:

* **Stopped using caffeine on autopilot.** He ditched it completely on chill or off days. No gym? No big tasks? No caffeine.
* **Cycled his doses.** Heavy days (gym + work + errands) = full dose. Lighter days = half or none. That alone helped a ton.
* **Paired caffeine with L-theanine.** He swears this smoothed out the anxious edge, especially in social settings. Plus, the focus boost felt cleaner.
* **Added regular cardio.** Mostly endurance runs or cycling. Helped offset any blood pressure spikes and kept him feeling more balanced.
* **Got mindful about timing.** No caffeine after 2pm. That fixed his sleep more than he expected.

After about two weeks of this, he said caffeine felt “useful” again. Like he could actually *feel* the boost instead of just avoiding withdrawal. His energy felt more stable throughout the day, and weirdly, he found it easier to focus even without caffeine.

He’s not anti-caffeine now — he’s just more strategic about it. Anyone else been through something similar? What helped you reset or use it smarter?",1,1748327129.0,NootropicsinAustralia,0,1.0,False
1kwgbee,https://v.redd.it/8esqtctap93f1,A Minecraft Animator's thoughts about AI Art [Read Body Text],"**Important Note:**  
I will not Promote or send Links (video is just a proof that i do art), Thought you guys would be interested, Apologies for bad english in advance.

Youtuber Pikat made a video talking about ""Why Artists don't like AI"", she then there mentioned something that I'll Paraphrase: ""Sure the generated image is nice to look at but theres there's no point questioning why a certain mark is in a certain place because thats just the most probable for that technology, theres no nuance intentionality on it""

While right now that's true, there's no stopping AI to eventually do that, have intention to every single part of the image, it's strokes, it's methodologies, etc... right now that isn't the case and that nuance is missing but that will be there eventually with AGI. AI will really just mostly be a problem to the artists that do art for the money, the industry isn't gonna cater for that,

You would need to find a client that would pay for \*specifically\* human authentic art, if you do art for the craft of it and not for money then you should be fine,

And if you wanna make an image, knows all about the process of art but find it slow, and the AI is able to 1-1 recreate your initial thought or planning, and can iterate very accurately with you that you can even guide every stroke, elements and pixels (which isn't the case now, its still stupid) then you'd be having the best time of your life with this technology.

\[ Thought Experiment: This will obviously be an exaggeration but as a thought experiment imagine that the entertainment industry is at its lowest, and there's barely any people that talented to hire, that the only only possible way to make ""Interstellar, Across the Spider Verse, Minecraft or any of your Favorite piece of Art"" is through AI, you would want AI right? if you don't then at least you acknowledge that it isn't unreasonable for other people to do want it, for or despite that fact \]

For me myself, it's not really an issue for an artist to know everything about art, and want to make the most Ambitious game movie or show, to use AI because otherwise, that big vision they have, would not be able to see the light of the day.

A lot of media narrative right now is making it look like every artist hates AI, I just want them to properly acknowledge that there is still very very good artists who worked on the best things that aren't necessarily that hateful of AI, and have their own reasons to be excited or not about it, or use it to any extent they need or want, that doesn't make them necessarily malicious or evil either.

**TLDR:**  
AI art lacks intentional nuance *for now*, but that will likely change with AGI. Artists who create for craft, not just profit, won’t be as threatened. Those with vision but limited means may find AI essential to realize their ideas. The fear and backlash are understandable, especially with current tech hurting visibility for human-made work, but not all great artists hate AI—some see its potential without being malicious or exploitative. The issue is more complex than current narratives suggest.

**On a Personal Note:**  
I don't fully support AI, specially not on it's state right now, it hurts so much to see youtube to promote it despite having tools to tag it because the technology hasn't even matured that much yet, it's still really bad and easy to make and publish, you work hours and months on an animation that is better than a lot of things out there but it never gets recommended because the space is oversaturated with easy to make AI Videos, so much for that dream job, cant even buy a coffee with it, still will never give up tho lol!",8,1748327075.0,singularity,2,0.9,False

Meanwhile, we’re over here just begging for one quiet coffee without a debate team tryout.

Outsiders call it “communication,” we call it “emotional dodgeball.”

Have any of you found love after ruining something good and working on yourselves?,"As the tittle says, I broke up with my gf of 3 years over fears caused by anxiety and avoidance, couples with very troubled times with my parents,

She was always there for me, and even though I was there for her, I neglected so many of her needs it sickens me in retrospect, little things, like going out more often for coffee together, or simply opening up more.

I broke up out of panic, and instantly regretted it, we talked, no going back.

I know I ,messed up, and I really do think she is better off. 

However, I am in the throws of despair. I feel terrible for not trying hard enough, and hurting someone who loved me so much.

I am also terrified that after such a horrific mistake, I will never find someone who loves me as deeply. Even tough right now I cant imagine myself looking for someone else for a long time.  
  
What can I do/work on to avoid this happening?  
  
Are there any behaviors I should look out for and correct?

Already looking into dealing with anxious attachment. 

Any success stories would also be highly appreciated, feel like I am going to die of shame and pain right now.",4,1748326840.0,relationship_advice,6,1.0,False

I've tried and failed at low/no sugar diets for about 10 years now and I'm 35 so I need to make it happen desperately. Last time I did carnivore it worked really well and I made it 73 days. But then I quit coffee as the last non carnivore thing and the sugar cravings came roaring back with a vengeance.  It's been over ten years since the last time I had Adderall but I did use it without a prescription so I know what I'm in for.

Still looking for any advice though. Honestly I don't believe I can quit sugar with the white knuckle approach. ",2,1748326824.0,carnivorediet,2,1.0,False
