1man69k,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicalscripts/comments/1man69k/submission_godspell_schwartztebelak_script/,[SUBMISSION] Godspell (Schwartz/Tebelak) - Script Collection,"# Introduction

There are many ways to describe *Godspell*; small wonder, as it’s undergone many manifestations since it first appeared on the scene in 1971. Savvy theater types would not be remiss in describing the original production as “the musical theatre’s equivalent of *Schoolhouse Rock*.” The uninitiated sometimes refer to it as “that other Seventies rock musical about Jesus,” with more of a folk edge to its score – mostly a new setting of lyrics from the Episcopal hymnal, psalms, and other religious sources by Oscar-winning composer Stephen Schwartz – than the shade of bombast associated with its equally famous cousin, *Jesus Christ Superstar*.

In either event, the show is playful and centered on a series of parables primarily from the Gospel of Matthew, interspersed with a variety of modern music (ranging from pop to folk rock, to gospel, to vaudeville), with the Passion of Christ treated briefly near the end of the performance. Though often dismissed as its genre’s equivalent of “empty calories,” it has a lot going on under the hood (or bonnet, for UK readers), much like Schwartz’s other early Seventies success, *Pippin*. And that, combined with a tuneful score, was enough to propel it from a college student’s eccentric master’s thesis project into a mega-hit coffee house, Off-Broadway, and then a Broadway show (and movie) that won a Grammy, spawned companies that toured worldwide and evolved into a perennial favorite for high schools and colleges with shoestring budgets and great talent.

This is a collection of all the licensed scripts for the show, in response to a flurry of recent requests in this subreddit. Enjoy!

# Original Off-Broadway Version (1971)

* [**Original script (circa 1971)**](https://app.degoo.com/share/UwcCpw5FeGn0nSj8377CfQ) – This is the original script as licensed by Theatre Maximus. It is formatted à la Samuel French, who used to license *Godspell* in the UK before another major agency took over all worldwide licensing in 2021, in an era when Samuel French was a separate entity from the conglomerate that now owns it. *(Bonus: This is a* [***production book***](https://app.degoo.com/share/wwg4STlOqrmSTdOWDM0eYQ) *that usually came with the license until it became more of a piecemeal kind of deal at some point, and detailed how to stage and do upkeep on a replica of the greasepaint-and-clown-costume original. Of particular note is Stephen Schwartz’s “signposts” page, which indicates that he had some idea even then that the show wasn’t immediately accessible to later directors from the script you see here. When the show was more prevalent and fresher in everyone’s memories, it was easier to reconstruct, much like any other classic. Later, however, it was necessary to be more specific.)*
* [**Revised “director’s notes” script (circa 1999)**](https://app.degoo.com/share/z5CQQ56ncf1JWcc-7AlFmw) – This edition, presently licensed worldwide by another major agency, included, for the first time, detailed director’s notes by Stephen Schwartz interspersed throughout. “Signposts” had become a guidebook. As many found the existing black-bar format on the trading scene “unreadable,” I have substituted the Samuel French UK edition in hopes that they may find it more palatable. *(Bonus: Still not quite getting how this show works yet? Struggling to infuse Bible passages with humor? Experienced performer/director John McTavish, a veteran of several amateur productions from its earliest days of licensing, will give you some clues in the indispensable* [***Spotlight on “Godspell”: A Guidebook for Directors***](https://app.degoo.com/share/lSn8ljh4GZ34L-fdxDfzgQ)*, designed as a script supplement, which records detailed suggestions for ad-libs and staging parables based in large part on the original John-Michael Tebelak staging.)*

# Revised Version (2012)

Where do I begin? The 2012 *(2011, actually, but 2012 is the label they stuck on it for licensing)* revival version of *Godspell* has a long and unglorious history. It was a flop, but the producer, Ken Davenport, had to make his money back somehow, and licensing this was the way, I guess. If you’re looking to stage a replica of the 2011 version exactly as it was done at Circle in the Square, find a bootleg, because the material by itself does not reflect the whole picture, but if you’re looking to do a *Godspell* with some of their flavor rather than their overall scheme, this is the one for you.

* [**Script**](https://app.degoo.com/share/TCwvHrUDcyMnfmKBy-lYAw) – As licensed; a lightly revised version of the standard edition, reflecting the lyrics (and score) changes to the Broadway revival. The characters’ names (barring Jesus and John the Baptist/Judas, of course) are now those of the revival’s cast members (although one can occasionally spot a typo where a name didn’t get swapped out in the body of the script); sometimes the director’s notes and foreword also reflect a choice made in the revival in addition to (or in place of) the original.",1,1753625223.0,musicalscripts,0,1.0,False

Mission details are below. Good luck agent :)","I have few Pics in my profile, also feel free to snoop around! I want you to feel like you know me before I know you haha, also I'm good with people in india and outside of india as well!(not in a desperate way but in a ""I'd love to hear more about you"" way)

P. S I'm open to LDR as long as we feel we vibe :)

Heyy everyone, Regardless of whoever is looking this I hope that you are going through a good day! As for me I did have a pretty good day!, I went to gym and read some books, went out with my friends for a really good cup of coffee with dark chocolate. I coded something that I really thought was genius haha(check my post on indianfinancialmarkets if you want to see it!) . finally I'm gonna wrap my day up with a good movie I'm gonna watch(please suggest me some movies!)

I feel like I have to address a few red flags because of the people who have reached out to me until now, Whereas I met a lot of wonderful people, I also met a few of the people that are making me add these **red flags**.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\-Please don't reach out to me if you want **Situationship** or don't want to do LDR if we are far away, LDR here means getting to know each other before we meetup, like just a week or so, people have reached out wanting a LDR but backed off once I asked them to make it official. (after repeatedly telling me that they like me..? I want someone to be like the same way I'm being with them.)

\-I'm not a second/third wheel in a relationship nor I am a garbage truck to dump your emotional load onto me. Now sorry for being harsh but emotional load here means that information on your EX or how your EX treated you better than everyone else and how you can't go back to him, I'm not just a guy whom you can be emotional with and cut me off once you feel better.

\-Third thing, the pics I keep in my profile are my average one's I keep the really good one's in my phone because while I believe that looks matter, one should check for emotional compatibility as well. Hence the reason why I keep average photos for my profile and keep the really good one's in my phone.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Imagine this usual scenario......you ever see posts/reels in Instagram/TikTok and wonder when do I get someone who's sweet, caring, possibly confident(definitely haha) and a guy who will be honest if the situation comes up?

just like I have told you in the post, I'm a big fan of life, I love adventures, spontaneous trips or just cuddling in the bed while watching Netflix, I'm mature enough to give you your personal space and support you at times where you need me the most and immature enough to do fight water gun battles with you lol(I will win haha).

I have lot planned in life, financial wise, I pretty much figured out my life and intellectually I feel like I'm smart enough to overcome situations, whereas both of them are good for me, I also want some unpredictability, some fun and someone whom I can call whenever I want, play any kind of game I want(planning to buy PS5, a laptop guy now) and honestly....wake up but still pretend to fall asleep for a few mins so that I can snuggle with you.

I like to watch sports, anime and Hollywood moves and K-dramas so that I can practice my rizz on you hehe(so dumb!)

**Some of my hobbies:** I play badminton, piano, music, games, I love tinkering with projects and stuff, currently working as a citizen scientist part time, I love to explore new places/long drives, vacations. I like hiking and When I am tired I mostly do Netflix and chill. Cook something new or just learn something new. I like brainy stuff such as stargazing and physical ones such as paragliding, surfing and many more!

I don't really mind the ages or anything like that and if in the off chance that I do get lucky, maybe we can start from LDR and end at ""I do""? hahaha

If you made it until the end thank you :) I'll let you on a little secret before you go!

You know, it's like I put my brain on autopillt and, boom, I'm there before I even realize it. One day, I caught myself wonderring if there are better options out there but kept dismissing the thought... until now 🌍.

I decided to try somethnig new: actively choosing different paths to get to work every day. I mean, what's life without a little spontaneity, rihgt? I'm not gonna lie, it was really out of my comfort zone at first—old habits die hard. But I read about this thing called ""habit stacking"" and fgured it couuld work for breaking habits too. Anyway, I stacked the ""new route"" idea with my morning coffee, turning it into a game of, ""Where to today?""

The results have been kjnda cool! I've started to notice parts of my neighborhood I didn't even know existted and I'm feeling less like a zombie each morning. Plus, it's helpping me with thinking outside of the box in other areas too. I'm actually excited about my mornings now (who knew that was poasible?!). 

I guess my point is, shaking up somethhing as simple as your daily commute can add a bit of excitement and also subtly train your brain to be more adaptable. Anyone else out there try changing their daily habitual routes? If so, did it stick? Any fun discoveries? 🍀",3,1753624993.0,PsychologyOfHabits,0,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

• Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

• The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

• Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. 

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. 

5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. 

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. Nicotine is what’s called a vasoconstrictor, while nicotine itself is not a carcinogen, it can temporarily narrow your blood vessels, veins, and make them smaller while the nicotine is in your system. The nicotine can also raise your heart's pulse rate. 

7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. 

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. 

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. There will also be what’s called an anticoagulant liquid that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. 

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

• Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.

• It's recommended to use Castor Oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead.

• Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

• Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. 

• Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. 

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. 

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.

1mamw3m,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mamw3m,"10.3kg of Summer Haul Review 🌞 | (Stussy, Dior, Hellstar, CH, Acne, RL, Sp5der)","So, I’m around 174cm and sit at about 72kg. I usually go for a medium in most tops unless I want that little extra breathing room, then I’ll size up to an L. I like my tees to have a relaxed fit, not too oversized, just that nice laid-back drape. When it comes to bottoms, I’m a true 32, but I’ll sometimes size up if the cut looks tight or the waist seems a bit unforgiving.
This haul was mostly summer-friendly stuff, things I can just grab and wear without overthinking. It took exactly 17 days to reach me here in the EU. Box weighed just under 10.3kg. Here’s how everything held up outta the box ,

• Casablanca coords - Honestly, this one feels like a soft flex. The print is clean, quality is there, and the fabric’s got that light, breathable feel to it. Fits like a comfy M with just enough length, been reaching for this one a lot already.

• ESSENTIALS T-Shirt - Staple piece, no doubt. It has that signature boxy fit and solid weight to it. Branding’s lowkey and tasteful. True to size but still gives that relaxed streetwear vibe. Wore it to the grocery store and felt like I styled my life.

• Margiela T-Shirt - This one's for when I'm feeling a little artsy but don’t wanna try too hard. Stitching detail is on point, fabric’s thick but not hot. The fit is structured, not too oversized, just neat and intentional. Very clean look.

• Ami T-Shirt - Honestly, the quality on this surprised me. That little heart logo hits in person, and the whole just feels elevated. Easy to throw on when I want to look like I tried without actually trying.

• Rhude Shirt - The graphic slaps and it itself has that vintage wash that feels already worn-in (in a good way). Slightly oversized fit, pairs well with cargos or denim. Feels like a full outfit on its own.

• Chrome Hearts T-Shirt - Can’t go wrong with this. The logo is crisp, the print feels solid, and the cotton has some weight. Great piece for layering or just wearing solo. No loose threads or bad ink, looks and feels solid.

• Loewe T-Shirt - Definitely a sleeper hit. The embroidery looks super neat and detailed, and the fit gives quiet luxury. Not flashy, just polished. Can easily dress it up with a jacket or wear it chill with cargos.

• Balenciaga T-Shirt - Has that intentional oversized look, for sure. The washed black color and subtle print give it that cool, worn-in energy. But I like that grunge aesthetic sometimes, and this actually nails it for me.

• Hellstar shorts (1st) - Slightly softer vibe than the 2nd one but still graphic-heavy. Material feels a bit stretchier on this one. Looks really good with a light flannel, easily statement piece.

• Hellstar shorts (2nd) - This one’s bold af. Print is clean and eye-catching for me, and the fit sits well. Not too thick, not too light, ideal for pairing with open shirts or jackets.

• Ralph Lauren polo - You already know what this is. Clean, simple, reliable. Lightweight cotton, true fit. Been tossing it on for quick coffee runs.

• Stussy Shirt - This one’s got personality. Classic but not childish, and the quality is honestly better than I expected. Fit leans more streetwear but still super wearable day to day.

• Dior T-Shirt - The print on this is tasteful and not overbranded, which I love. The cotton has a premium weight and the fit has a nice drop shoulder feel. Definitely feels like something I’d wear on a night out with cargos and clean sneakers.

• Denim Tears shorts - Really impressed with this one. The print pops, cotton’s thick without being sweaty, and the overall structure feels quality. Sized TTS and it fits roomy but wearable.

• Acne Studios denim shorts - Aesthetic as hell. It’s minimal, structured. Material feels luxe and breathable. Wore it to brunch and instantly felt like a gallery person lol.

• Sp5der T-Shirt - Loud, fun, unapologetic. Colors are vibrant and the print is actually well done, no cheap cracking or weird ink issues. It’s definitely a weekend tee but in the best way.",0,1753624500.0,FashionReps,2,0.04,False

1mamqtk,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1mamqtk/does_the_keurig_kslim_coffee_maker_truly_deliver/,Does the Keurig K-Slim Coffee Maker Truly Deliver on Convenience?,"The Keurig 062151516724 caught my eye immediately because of its sleek, modern design and space-saving build. As someone with a relatively cramped kitchen countertop, I was drawn to the promise of a coffee maker that's less than 12 cm wide. It’s always challenging finding appliances that don't overcrowd the limited space, and this one seemed like a perfect fit. Naturally, I had to see if it lived up to the hype.

**Compact Design and Space Efficiency**  
The slim profile truly lives up to its promise. Sitting at just 12 cm wide, it barely takes up any space, leaving plenty of room for other kitchen essentials. I placed it between my toaster and a jar of utensils, and it fits like a puzzle piece. The Twilight Blue color adds a unique flair; it’s a pleasant change from the typical stainless steel look. You’d think a smaller coffee maker might compromise functionality, but surprisingly, it retains what you need. 

[Time to see Keurig 062151516724 cost on Amazon.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b0bdt6htjj/)  

**Ease of Use**  
Operating this machine couldn’t be simpler. With fully automatic functionality, just pop in your favorite pod, choose your cup size—237, 296, or 355 ml—and press a button. I’ve handed over brewing duties to my teenager, and they’ve yet to mess it up! The button interface is intuitive, and the lack of overly complex menus is definitely a highlight. If you’re juggling multiple morning tasks (aren’t we all?), this lets you multitask without worrying about needing a barista’s manual.

**Brewing Performance and MultiStream Technology**  
The coffee? Excellent. Full-bodied, consistent aroma every time. This is largely due to the MultiStream Technology, which ensures every K-Cup pod is thoroughly saturated. It’s noticeably better at capturing flavors compared to my older coffee machine. When I brewed medium roast, the taste was significantly richer, and every sip felt more aromatic. I tested it with various K-Cup pods, and it nailed the strength and flavor across the board.  

**Reservoir Convenience**  
The 1.36 L water reservoir is detachable, making it simple to refill. What’s more, it allows you to brew up to four cups before needing a refill—a feature I underestimated at first. It wasn’t until I hosted book club (read: a coffee appreciation session disguised as literary discussion) that I appreciated not having to refill constantly. Sliding the reservoir in and out is smooth and hassle-free, a small but important detail.

**Pluses**  
- Compact size fits snugly even in the tightest spaces.  
- MultiStream Technology provides consistent, aromatic brews.  
- Offers three brew sizes for flexible serving needs.  

**Replacement Filter and Limited Compatibility**  
Moving on to some flaws, the device uses reusable filters, which is sustainable but also a bit tricky to clean. My mornings don’t always allow time for rinsing out the filter thoroughly, so it’s a minor inconvenience. Additionally, the Keurig 062151516724 is compatible only with K-Cup pods. This means if you want to experiment with off-brand pods or your own ground coffee, you need an additional adapter or workaround.

**Negatives**  
- Reusable filters can be cumbersome to clean.  
- Limited pod compatibility restricts coffee variety without additional purchases.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
While the product impresses with its slim profile and rich brews, it faces some stiff competition. For instance, the Nespresso Essenza Mini offers a similarly compact design and caters to those who prefer espresso-based drinks. However, its capsule system feels pricier over time. On the other hand, the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew provides multiple brewing options, including ground coffee and pods. The trade-off is that it’s bulkier, taking up significantly more countertop space. Compared to these, the Keurig stands out as a well-balanced option for size and coffee variety, although the lack of espresso capability might sway some users elsewhere.

**Affordable Quality**  
Is it worth it? For its size and brewing consistency, I think it brings a lot of utility for an average household or even small office. Sure, you’re investing in a specific pod system, but the reward is in convenience and flavor. Other coffee makers might boast more features or fancier settings, but this one represents a sweet spot between price, simplicity, and effectiveness. If you appreciate straightforward operation over bells and whistles, this model might just tick all your boxes.

**Parse the Odds: The Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)**  
The Phoenix Mercury (-316) are the clear favorites here, with an implied probability of **76%** to win—meaning the books think Washington’s chances are about as likely as a vegan opening a steakhouse. The Mercury’s defense, ranked 6th in the WNBA (allowing just 80.0 PPG), is like a locked vault guarded by Satou Sabally’s 18.2 PPG and Alyssa Thomas’ rebounding prowess. Meanwhile, the Mystics (11th in scoring at 82.9 PPG) rely on Brittney Sykes’ 16.8 PPG, but their 7th-ranked offense will need to break through Phoenix’s defensive iron curtain.

The spread? Phoenix is favored by 7 points, a cushion that feels about as generous as a free sample at a grocery store. The total is set at 164.5 points, and with the Mercury’s stingy defense vs. Washington’s mid-tier attack, “Under” smells like the safer bet—unless Sykes decides to shoot 15 threes and hit 14 of them (we’ve all seen that movie; it ends poorly).

**Digest the News: Streaks, Rebounds, and Revenge**  
Phoenix is coming off a three-game losing streak, but don’t count them out. Alyssa Thomas is staying positive, saying, “It’s a long season,” which is WNBA code for “We’re not panicking… yet.” The Mercury’s recent losses aren’t due to incompetence—just a run of bad luck that’s felt like watching your favorite coffee shop run out of oat milk every single day.

Washington, meanwhile, is motivated to avenge their May 25 loss to Phoenix (68-62). The Mystics are 8-4 at home this season, but their “revenge tour” has been spottier than a used car’s paint job. Brittney Sykes is their engine (17.1 PPG), but even she can’t single-handedly outscore a team with Phoenix’s defensive discipline. Oh, an

1mamohc,https://www.reddit.com/r/dui/comments/1mamohc/48_hour_stay_for_dui_in_lycoming_county_prison/,48 hour stay for DUI in Lycoming County Prison,"I am only posting this because when I went to look up what my experience might have been like, there was nothing out there, so hopefully this will help prepare somebody out there when they search for what their short stay at their local prison is for their DUI.

 I deferred my sentence to Friday so that I could work the rest of my week since I was sentenced on Tuesday. I showed up to the jail Friday morning just before 8 a.m., I buzzed in at the front door and told them my name and why I was there, and they sent someone out to get me. One of the CO's met me at the door, I went into a garage bay type area where I had my pockets emptied, all I had brought with me was my cell phone, my wallet, and a book. The officer proceeded to pat me down and took me further into the jail. Then I was instructed to sit down at a chair and take my shoes off, which I did, then instructed to go into a small bathroom area where I was strip searched, I had to take off all my clothes, put my hands above my head, and spin around, lift my sack, and spread my cheeks lol, pretty dehumanizing. Following the strip search, I received my prison clothes, an orange jumpsuit, some old green underwear, a pair of gray socks, and put them on. I then was instructed to go into one of the holding cells in the intake area, I sat in that holding cell for about an hour and a half, it was just a bunk with a pad and a toilet sink combo. After my wait in the holding cell, I was called out and did my medical screening where a nurse went through a typical medical screening questionnaire and took my vitals. 

After the medical screening, I did a few admin questionnaires with a CO, following that they pointed to a bedroll that had my blanket and a pillowcase filled with 2 days’ worth of socks, underwear, and jumpsuits, a toothbrush and toothpaste, and a bar of soap. They then took me to an elevator and instructed me to go up to the second floor and walk out when the door opens and go right. So I did that and walked until I saw the next CO who pointed me out to my cell. I was in L block cell 4 at my home for the next 48 hours. At this point, I was about 2 hours in, and thankfully, my timer started when I walked through the door at 8 a.m. I walked into my cell, and the bars closed behind me. I laid out my bedroll sheet on the bottom bunk, took the uncomfortable jumpsuits out of the pillowcase, and put them on a shelf. I left the rest of the spare clothes in my pillowcase to be used as my pillow. 

Basically, from here on out, it was about passing time. They did not let me keep the book I brought with me to pass time, so I started out by reading the 8-page inmate handbook that seemed a little outdated. The block I was in seemed to be a lockdown block. The people above me in the cells I found out were in protective custody, so they literally never left their cells except to shower. There was one dude on the block that didn't appear to be in the same situation as everyone else. He was able to go out of his cell as he pleased. He also went and got food for the rest of the block when it was ready. He cleaned the block at the end of the day. He appeared to be a long-term resident of the block, but the only one. From my cell, I could see 2, probably 32"" TVs on the wall in the main block area that the long-term dude had control of. When the prison wasn't on lockdown, he would go out and turn the TVs on. The only thing was you had to have a radio to hear the TVs, and I was not afforded that luxury. So for the entire time I was there, I was straining to see the TVs through the bars and couldn't hear anything anyway. 7:20 was breakfast, 11:20 was lunch, and 4:20 was dinner. 

Typically, the doors would open for the lower cells at those times shortly after the trays would come by, and the long-term guy would hand out the trays of food. You got like 10-15 minutes to eat, then back to the cell you went. The dudes on protective custody upstairs got their trays handed through the bars. When I got there, I was in the cell by myself. 

At about 2:30pm I got a cellmate that had come back from a short furlough because his son died. He was in the cell with me for about 1 hour. He left me with some books and offered me coffee or tea, which I didn't want to take. He seemed like a genuine guy. He told me he was there for felony burglary. He said we were on meth for like a week straight and was hallucinating on the last day and thought he walked into his house but instead walked into someone else's house. So that was interesting. The books he left behind were a Quran (I’m Christian), The Mark of Athena, and a Scrabble players’ dictionary that was pretty much ripped to shreds, lmao. I didn't read any of them. I did brush through the Quran a little to see what it was about. I read the first story, ""The Hiefer,"" and that was enough for me. 

The second day was about the same. I woke up, ate breakfast, went back into my cell, sat there until lunch in a half-awake state doing push-ups every now and then, brushing up on the inmate handbook for entertainment, and listening to the protective custody dudes bitch and whine and talk to people on their tablets or phones and watched the TV without sound. I just did that all day, and it was extremely boring. Basically, there is no way to get comfortable. 

At about 7 or 8 at night, I received another cellmate. This guy was coming in for a longer stay, for his first time, so he was going to be in that cell until Monday when he can get classified and moved into general population. He was a younger kid in for criminal mischief. This was basically when I learned that the block I was in was where they send people before they get classified for general population, or the short stay DUI guys like myself. It was more interaction with other inmates than I expected, if I am being honest. I probably would have preferred to just not have had cellmates, but I guess you don't really get that choice. 

After basically laying around not doing anything all day besides push-ups every few hours, I had a terrible time sleeping. My last night I barely slept because I was not tired, and I was not tired because I literally had not done anything besides lay around for the previous 36 hours. So my last 12 hours were the worst. I barely slept the night before I got out. Plus, I was anxiously checking the clock and counting down my hours. I wouldn't suggest doing this, but when you’re in the moment, you literally have nothing else to do, so you do it. 

Finally, on the last day, I got up, had breakfast, and shortly after breakfast, they called my name over the loudspeaker to pack my stuff up. I basically gave away my soap and toothpaste to the dudes that were going to be there longer than I was, rolled my bed up like it was when I got it, and grabbed my paperwork and walked myself out. It was a little confusing since they didn't give me much direction, but I found myself back in the intake area from two days ago. They gave me my clothes back and had me change and told me they had to wait until 8 o'clock exactly. So I put my normal clothes and sat in the holding cell from day one for about 10 minutes, but this time they didn't close the door on me. 

Then, after my time was up, they walked me out the door and said good luck, and that was that. Must say I would not recommend the experience. It was not fun. It is not meant to be fun, obviously. They do it this way as a way to deter people from coming back. Plus, there is no reason to put short timers in general population. The food, for the most part, was terrible, but it wasn't third world by any means. It was edible, it just wasn't great. Like I said in the beginning, I am writing this to hopefully help ease the mind of someone who is about to go through this because the day before I went, I tried to look up something similar, and there was nothing.",1,1753623943.0,dui,1,1.0,False

I usually go for a medium in most tops unless I want that little extra breathing room, then I’ll size up to an L. I like my tees to have a relaxed fit, not too oversized, just that nice laid-back drape. When it comes to bottoms, I’m a true 32, but I’ll sometimes size up if the cut looks tight or the waist seems a bit unforgiving.
This haul was mostly summer-friendly stuff, things I can just grab and wear without overthinking. It took exactly 17 days to reach me here in the EU. Box weighed just under 10.3kg. Here’s how everything held up outta the box ,

• Casablanca coords - Honestly, this one feels like a soft flex. The print is clean, quality is there, and the fabric’s got that light, breathable feel to it. Fits like a comfy M with just enough length, been reaching for this one a lot already.

• ESSENTIALS T-Shirt - Staple piece, no doubt. It has that signature boxy fit and solid weight to it. Branding’s lowkey and tasteful. True to size but still gives that relaxed streetwear vibe. Wore it to the grocery store and felt like I styled my life.

• Margiela T-Shirt - This one's for when I'm feeling a little artsy but don’t wanna try too hard. Stitching detail is on point, fabric’s thick but not hot. The fit is structured, not too oversized, just neat and intentional. Very clean look.

• Ami T-Shirt - Honestly, the quality on this surprised me. That little heart logo hits in person, and the whole just feels elevated. Easy to throw on when I want to look like I tried without actually trying.

• Rhude Shirt - The graphic slaps and it itself has that vintage wash that feels already worn-in (in a good way). Slightly oversized fit, pairs well with cargos or denim. Feels like a full outfit on its own.

• Chrome Hearts T-Shirt - Can’t go wrong with this. The logo is crisp, the print feels solid, and the cotton has some weight. Great piece for layering or just wearing solo. No loose threads or bad ink, looks and feels solid.

• Loewe T-Shirt - Definitely a sleeper hit. The embroidery looks super neat and detailed, and the fit gives quiet luxury. Not flashy, just polished. Can easily dress it up with a jacket or wear it chill with cargos.

• Balenciaga T-Shirt - Has that intentional oversized look, for sure. The washed black color and subtle print give it that cool, worn-in energy. But I like that grunge aesthetic sometimes, and this actually nails it for me.

• Hellstar shorts (1st) - Slightly softer vibe than the 2nd one but still graphic-heavy. Material feels a bit stretchier on this one. Looks really good with a light flannel, easily statement piece.

• Hellstar shorts (2nd) - This one’s bold af. Print is clean and eye-catching for me, and the fit sits well. Not too thick, not too light, ideal for pairing with open shirts or jackets.

• Ralph Lauren polo - You already know what this is. Clean, simple, reliable. Lightweight cotton, true fit. Been tossing it on for quick coffee runs.

• Stussy Shirt - This one’s got personality. Classic but not childish, and the quality is honestly better than I expected. Fit leans more streetwear but still super wearable day to day.

• Dior T-Shirt - The print on this is tasteful and not overbranded, which I love. The cotton has a premium weight and the fit has a nice drop shoulder feel. Definitely feels like something I’d wear on a night out with cargos and clean sneakers.

• Denim Tears shorts - Really impressed with this one. The print pops, cotton’s thick without being sweaty, and the overall structure feels quality. Sized TTS and it fits roomy but wearable.

• Acne Studios denim shorts - Aesthetic as hell. It’s minimal, structured. Material feels luxe and breathable. Wore it to brunch and instantly felt like a gallery person lol.

• Sp5der T-Shirt - Loud, fun, unapologetic. Colors are vibrant and the print is actually well done, no cheap cracking or weird ink issues. It’s definitely a weekend tee but in the best way.",3,1753623780.0,Flexicas,1,1.0,False

And who is stupid/smart enough to survive and explore, to expand FTL lanes? Humans. 

Now I could use this as an excuse to tell you a story about why a certain FTL Lane tells people to close their windows facing a certain direction when in transit, said by the Human as to ""Not catch their gaze"" but let's go a bit smaller and funnier. 

Cause I'd rather not relive something I would rather forget, let's talk about my friend's Grandfather. 

He is a Frontiersman, aka he explores the unknown areas but settled down at a planet where I am planning to set up a laboratory. 

My friend told me his grandpa is very accomodating to me and my crew so I expected great hospitality, which I did, but also a lot of issues I refuse to bring up with him. 

One of which is his lookout...now normally it would be a drone but he got a local from the planet to be his lookout. 

No it's not another sentient he can directly communicate with, at least I assume so, he keeps petting it. 

I wake up on my first morning, he gives me coffee I water down with milk and enjoy, he then begins digging a new plot since he will be feeding me and my crew, of course we pitch in to help. 

However as he relaxes, resting his body on his shovel, a large creature flies down. 

We grab our blasters but he looks confused. 

He does not see the GIANT Eagle with horns on his shovel that is casually picking up his hat and letting it drop back on his head. 

""What's gotten into you two, there are no threats here"" He says as if he barely notices the giant bird I assume is trying to break his skull to eat his brain. 

He then looks at the bird and just smacks it as it squawks away in fear. 

""That bastard has been trying to steal my hat for 2 years, hence why I suggest you two keep your helmets strapped lest it steal it"" he tells us nonchalantly. 

We decide to just wear armored helmets outside. 

He takes us fishing by the riverside, his constant driving made a dirt road for his car, we assume he needs fishing rods or a net, instead he tells us to just throw some fish food. 

We do as he instructs, and suddenly rumbling of giant fish that appear like Koi except in extravagant colored scales appear to jump out of the water as if seeking more food flap onto the ground. 

As we duck for cover the old man takes an axe and basically decapitates all the fish that land out of the water. 

""Throw the heads back in, we'll bleed the fish here then take them back"" with a triumphant smile and licking his lips. 

We are flabbergasted but we convince him to let us take one of the fish whole back to the lab, piercing it's spinal cord with a metal wire. 

While we did enjoy the delicious fish feast for lunch and packs more into the car for dinner and meals going forward, he takes us to the mountans in the afternoon. 

There we are taught how this planet's ecology allowed poisonous and edible plants be differentiated. 

My particular favorite is something akin to Earth's Fiddlehead Fern that goes great with bread crumbs batter deep fried with a glass of beer. 

But the most terrifying is when we went into the forest. 

He kept shouting, making noise, rustling leaves, smacking marks into trees. after wiping the blade on his sweaty back from the humidity. 

I asked him if it's a human war chant, he looked at me like I'm crazy and said ""The creatures of the woods don't wanna mess with me, I don't want to mess with them, so I'm loud so they can get out of my way and I leave the sweaty axe marks to leave a scent so they leave my trail alone to my secret stash"" 

I blink, cause his logic makes sense, large animals never attack certain species unless forced to or out of fear. 

We enter a clearing as he looks at the ground ""Ah, here we are"" as he digs into the ground and pulls out what I can surmise is this planet's form of ""Ginseng"" a popular root crop known for it's medicinal effects, particularly Humans, who also sell Ginseng tea, a popular tea known for it's health effects. 

He tells us to get only half on one side and that in half a year they can come back for the second half. 

We collect and scan it, it's very high quality Ginseng, and all natural. 

However our visit is cut short when the old man spots a cub in a tree, and screams at us ""FUCKING RUN BACK TO THE TRUCK!!!"" 

Trusting him we run back. I ask him why. He looks at me and says ""Name a species that leaves it's cubs alone in the forest that requires me to be loud as to not disturb them"" 

Safe to say we all took the note and understood that the Cub's parents or worse, their mother alone was nearby. 

We lost some samples and the old man sighs ""That mother must know I collect ginseng at this time of the year, must be too lazy to dig the ""seng"" out so it had US do all the work....smart girl AHAHAHAHAHHA"" He says with a smile that while was in defeat, as if he took pride in being outsmarted by another predator. 

As we headed back we continued our scanning of the resources on the planet. 

Luckily we still had a good haul of Ginseng that we had some used for tea, and wild ginseng tea just tastes better somehow than the kind I get in the market. 

four years of this routine pass. 

Fish, Forage, and Scanning. 

Sadly the old man got weak and finally broke, forced to move back with his grandson due to his ailing health. 

He looked so sad as we brought him back with us to ""civilized space"" 

Personally speaking I'd never want to be a Frontiersman, even I knew that the old man's ""golden hoard"" was still a relaxed experience where he had to go through that firsthand with no guidebook. 

But I greatly respect Humanity's curiousity to explore the unknown. 

Now if you'll excuse me, I need to name a horned eagle's species after him, but so many Humans are named John",5,1753623732.0,humansarespaceorcs,2,1.0,False

1mamlai,https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatelygranolamoms/comments/1mamlai/grocery_week_160_1_adult_1_toddler/,"Grocery week- $160 1 adult, 1 toddler","I posted this on the money diary’s subreddit, and I know we don’t allow cross posts. I love reading these to get a sense what’s typical for a moderately granola family grocery haul so I thought I’d post here as well. 


My husband is away for 8 days and I’m alone with a 2.5 year old. We live in Canada in a medium sized city, shopped at a large chain grocery store, and I eat 100g protein/day.

Produce: $17 (kiwis (6), blueberries, lettuce, bananas)

Protein: $59 (8 oz steak, chicken thighs (6), salmon (8 oz), eggs (12), egg white carton)

Dairy: $12 (cheese sticks, milk (3L)

Processed/frozen: $45 (stir fry sauce (2), chia pouch (4/$10), organic sweet potato fries (Costco), Made Good cookies

Beverages: $17 (12xbubly, strawberry banana premade smoothie (1L))

Other: $20 decaf coffee beans

I’m trying to wean my toddler off these expensive ($2.50/pouch) Mama chia pouches and make an alternative myself which is why I bought the smoothie drink. I mix it with Greek yogurt and chia seeds in a reusable pouch.

Not included: My husband makes our bread and I have produce from my parents garden (onions, peppers, garlic, zucchini, cucumbers) and some frozen veggies on hand we ate. I have some frozen shrimp in the freezer and rice in the pantry I plan to use to make a stir fry 1 night. I usually have a protein shake or protein bar/day to hit my protein goal. We have some toddler snacks on hand I’m sure will be consumed.

I didn’t buy anything “excess” this week that I think will be left for next week or go into the pantry. I think $220/week would be our spend if it was just the two of us regularly and I had to average out my protein supplements and miscellaneous pantry buys.

1mamkdv,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mamkdv/should_i_follow_my_heart/,Should I follow my heart?,"For some back story, I’ve been an entry level personal banker for nearly 4 years. I’ve pretty much accomplished as much as I can in this position and was interested in getting into lending but I haven’t had any success getting there. I’ve been passed up for promotion opportunities, receive no recognition for being the hardest working teller and at this point I’m so burnt out and unhappy at the bank I’m at that it’s affecting my work. I picked up a part time job at a coffee shop in town on the side for fun and I’ve been loving it. I was instantly recognized for my hard work and talent and offered a leadership position and I could see myself moving up into a management position eventually. I make about the same amount of money at this job to work less hours and have a better work/life balance, I have health insurance lined up for when I transfer to full time and I’m recognized and appreciated. 

Here’s the thing, I’m terrified. I’m feeling a strong pull to pursue this opportunity and leave banking, but I’m scared that I’ll fail and won’t be able to find another job this high paying in my small town. Failure has never been an option for me and my heart says I will wish I had done it sooner but the logical side of me says it’s unrealistic and won’t get me anywhere long term. I won’t have my set 9-5 schedule, full weekends & holidays off, a set salary or a variety of promotional options. Here I can work into management and that’s about it. 

Is it worth it for my mental health? 
Am I making a huge mistake? 
Do you really have to work for a big corporation for years and years to be successful? 
Would management experience be useful for me in the future? 

Please give me some hope 🥺🩷

1mamk60,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInReviews/comments/1mamk60/does_the_haden_heritage_toaster_truly_deliver/,Does the Haden Heritage Toaster Truly Deliver Style and Performance?,"The Haden Heritage 406751 has been sitting on my countertop for a few weeks now, and I'll admit, it catches my eye every single morning. As someone who loves the mix of function and aesthetics in kitchen appliances, this toaster and kettle bundle has filled both needs quite well. The steel and copper finish gives it a chic, retro vibe that instantly upgrades the look of my small kitchen. Though I'll get into the nitty-gritty details below, let me just say, if you’re a fan of blending style with utility, this might be worth considering.

**A Design to Flaunt**  
The first thing you'll notice is how this bundle blends old-world charm with modern engineering. Ensuring that it fits right in with my kitchen's aesthetic, the toaster's sleek steel and copper detailing feels timeless without being overly flashy. The kettle is just as classy, its 1.7-liter capacity making it perfect for boiling enough water for my tea-addicted family. Both products are part of Haden's Heritage line, so they focus on bridging the gap between visual charm and functionality, which has been appreciated by my daily coffee-and-tea routine.  

**Modern Engineering for Convenience**  
The toaster's features truly aim to simplify breakfast chaos, especially on busy mornings. Its two wide slots are heaven-sent for those extra-thick slices of artisanal bread my partner insists on buying. It includes a self-centering rack, which was a pleasant surprise. This ensures even toasting on all sides, a significant upgrade from my patchy toast-making days. It also has customizable modes, like defrost and bagel settings, and the adjustable timer is perfect for experimenting with various bread types. Meanwhile, the kettle heats up quickly and boasts solid insulation, so I don’t have to reheat it every 15 minutes when life inevitably distracts me.

[See Haden 406751 deals on Amazon now.](https://appliancedirectory.com/p/b0d7x5vzst/)  

**Highlights**  
- Elegant steel and copper finish matches various kitchen styles.  
- Wide slots in the toaster comfortably fit thick-sliced bread and bagels.  
- Adjustable controls and self-centering ensure perfectly toasted bread.  
- Kettle’s 1.7-liter capacity is more than adequate for families or small gatherings.  

**Negatives**  
The set isn’t without its quirks, though most aren't deal-breakers for me.  

- I found the toaster's lever to be a bit stiff at first, making it slightly frustrating to use.  
- The kettle’s spout doesn’t pour as smoothly as I’d hoped, leading to a minor splash here and there.  
- Despite the wide slots, the toaster isn't ideal for extremely oversized slices—it may require some trimming.

**Competing Brands**  
Compared to other stainless steel toaster and kettle combos, this bundle has its unique selling points. One competitor that comes to mind is the Breville stainless steel toaster and kettle set. While the Breville option offers more precision in its toasting features (like more slot size flexibility), the Haden 406751 delivers better aesthetic appeal. My mom owns a less expensive Black+Decker toaster, which is functional but lacks the design sophistication and evenness of Haden's toasting. If countertop beauty ranks high in your checklist, Breville might feel a tad bland. Another contender, KitchenAid, offers durability but at a slightly higher cost and with fewer design perks.

**Affordable Quality**  
When it comes to balancing quality with cost, I think this toaster and kettle combo offers solid value to the user. It’s not the cheapest on the market, but the array of features and the sleek finish bring it a step above regular models. It fulfills its promise as a “British Breakfast Brand,” not only charming my mornings but also functioning reliably for consistent use. You could likely find less expensive combos, but they may lack the consistent toasting quality and elegant design of this one.

I usually go for a medium in most tops unless I want that little extra breathing room, then I’ll size up to an L. I like my tees to have a relaxed fit, not too oversized, just that nice laid-back drape. When it comes to bottoms, I’m a true 32, but I’ll sometimes size up if the cut looks tight or the waist seems a bit unforgiving.
This haul was mostly summer-friendly stuff, things I can just grab and wear without overthinking. It took exactly 17 days to reach me here in the EU. Box weighed just under 10.3kg. Here’s how everything held up outta the box ,

• Casablanca coords - Honestly, this one feels like a soft flex. The print is clean, quality is there, and the fabric’s got that light, breathable feel to it. Fits like a comfy M with just enough length, been reaching for this one a lot already.

• ESSENTIALS T-Shirt - Staple piece, no doubt. It has that signature boxy fit and solid weight to it. Branding’s lowkey and tasteful. True to size but still gives that relaxed streetwear vibe. Wore it to the grocery store and felt like I styled my life.

• Margiela T-Shirt - This one's for when I'm feeling a little artsy but don’t wanna try too hard. Stitching detail is on point, fabric’s thick but not hot. The fit is structured, not too oversized, just neat and intentional. Very clean look.

• Ami T-Shirt - Honestly, the quality on this surprised me. That little heart logo hits in person, and the whole just feels elevated. Easy to throw on when I want to look like I tried without actually trying.

• Rhude Shirt - The graphic slaps and it itself has that vintage wash that feels already worn-in (in a good way). Slightly oversized fit, pairs well with cargos or denim. Feels like a full outfit on its own.

• Chrome Hearts T-Shirt - Can’t go wrong with this. The logo is crisp, the print feels solid, and the cotton has some weight. Great piece for layering or just wearing solo. No loose threads or bad ink, looks and feels solid.

• Loewe T-Shirt - Definitely a sleeper hit. The embroidery looks super neat and detailed, and the fit gives quiet luxury. Not flashy, just polished. Can easily dress it up with a jacket or wear it chill with cargos.

• Balenciaga T-Shirt - Has that intentional oversized look, for sure. The washed black color and subtle print give it that cool, worn-in energy. But I like that grunge aesthetic sometimes, and this actually nails it for me.

• Hellstar shorts (1st) - Slightly softer vibe than the 2nd one but still graphic-heavy. Material feels a bit stretchier on this one. Looks really good with a light flannel, easily statement piece.

• Hellstar shorts (2nd) - This one’s bold af. Print is clean and eye-catching for me, and the fit sits well. Not too thick, not too light, ideal for pairing with open shirts or jackets.

• Ralph Lauren polo - You already know what this is. Clean, simple, reliable. Lightweight cotton, true fit. Been tossing it on for quick coffee runs.

• Stussy Shirt - This one’s got personality. Classic but not childish, and the quality is honestly better than I expected. Fit leans more streetwear but still super wearable day to day.

• Dior T-Shirt - The print on this is tasteful and not overbranded, which I love. The cotton has a premium weight and the fit has a nice drop shoulder feel. Definitely feels like something I’d wear on a night out with cargos and clean sneakers.

• Denim Tears shorts - Really impressed with this one. The print pops, cotton’s thick without being sweaty, and the overall structure feels quality. Sized TTS and it fits roomy but wearable.

• Acne Studios denim shorts - Aesthetic as hell. It’s minimal, structured. Material feels luxe and breathable. Wore it to brunch and instantly felt like a gallery person lol.

• Sp5der T-Shirt - Loud, fun, unapologetic. Colors are vibrant and the print is actually well done, no cheap cracking or weird ink issues. It’s definitely a weekend tee but in the best way.",1,1753623439.0,Reps,2,1.0,False

1mamgy1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Home_Support/comments/1mamgy1/how_to_choose_the_best_electric_kettle_for_your/,How to Choose the Best Electric Kettle for Your Needs,"One of the most practical items in a contemporary kitchen is an electric kettle. Whether you’re boiling water for tea, making instant noodles, or preparing a quick cup of coffee, an electric kettle can save both time and effort. But with so many models and features available, choosing the right one can be confusing.

[Best Electric Kettle for Your Needs](https://preview.redd.it/c8cqh02f6fff1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5f26f98bf2b7f8f5898d7aff064b8cf08923912)

Here are the key factors to consider when selecting the best electric kettle for your needs:

# 1. Capacity

Start by identifying how much water you typically need to boil at once. There are several sizes of electric kettles, ranging from 0.5 to 2 liters.

* For single users or small households, a **1-liter kettle** is usually enough.  
* For larger families or frequent use, go for a **1.5 to 2-liter model**.

# 2. Wattage and Boiling Speed

The **higher the wattage**, the faster the kettle boils water.

* A **1500W to 2000W** [**electric kettle**](https://sujataappliances.com/kitchen-appliances/electric-kettle/) usually boils water in 3 to 5 minutes.  
* Select a kettle with a higher wattage if speed is important to you. Just make sure your kitchen socket supports the power requirements.

# 3. Build Material

Electric kettles can be made of glass, stainless steel, plastic, or a mix of these materials.

* **Stainless steel** is durable and retains heat longer.  
* **Glass kettles** look stylish and allow you to see the water level, but they are fragile.  
* **Plastic kettles** are lightweight but can retain odors and may not last as long. Choose based on your preference for durability, weight, and appearance.

# 4. Safety Features

Good electric kettles include safety features like:

* **Automatic shut-off** (turns off when water boils)
* **Boil-dry protection** (prevents operation without water)
* **Cool-touch body** (to avoid burns) These features are essential for daily use and prevent accidents.

# 5. Ease of Cleaning

Look for kettles with **wide mouths** and **removable lids or filters**, making them easier to clean. If you live in an area with hard water, cleaning becomes important due to scaling.

# 6. Corded vs. Cordless Design

A **cordless electric kettle** sits on a base and can be lifted freely, which is more convenient than fixed-cord models. Make sure the base has a **360-degree swivel**, especially if multiple people use it.

# 7. Temperature Control (Optional)

Some electric kettles offer **adjustable temperature settings**, which are useful for different drinks (green tea, coffee, etc.). If you need precision, this is worth considering.

# Conclusion

Choosing the [**best electric kettle in India**](https://sujataappliances.com/kitchen-appliances/electric-kettle/) depends on your daily needs, budget, and usage pattern. Focus on **capacity**, **wattage**, **build quality**, and **safety features**. Avoid getting distracted by unnecessary features you won’t use. A good-quality electric kettle should be fast, safe, and easy to maintain — and should make your kitchen tasks simpler every day.

It's not the end of the world (yes, yes it is) and depending on where I dropped it it's very likely been trampled to smithereens but on the off chance I put it down somewhere it would be so great if it showed at lost and found tomorrow but I don't have high hopes but I'm still putting it out there.

This isn’t even everything, but here’s a rundown of stuff that happened in my relationship/marriage:

* He was secretly engaged to another woman while we were building a relationship
* He was doing IVF with her and didn’t tell me
* He was having sex with at least one other woman while we were dating

* He called a Tinder hookup after we got married “because he needed someone to talk to”

* He got caught watching porn on his phone in front of me as I got ready for my first day of grad school. Then it accidentally unmuted, and when confronted insisted it was YouTube
* He blamed me for our car breaking down, made me cry, and left me alone on the side of the road
* He locked me out of our hotel room and told me to call the cops if I wanted back in. So I eventually did and he got arrested.

* He was taking unknown pills daily “from a friend” during our first few months married
* He requested work days that meant we’d never have time off together
* He spit in my face multiple times and said “I can do whatever I want”
* He screamed “help me” out the window when he'd get mad and then threaten to call the cops and have me arrested

* He smashed my laptop days before my dissertation was due
* He told me I’m not a model and “that’s just a fact” ""nobody's paying you for your looks""

* He smashed my new West Elm media console
* He smashed a fan, record player, and some of my art
* He put a hole in the wall in our apartment
* He had a second mystery box of condoms missing some after starting another job

* He repeatedly called the cops on me saying I “wouldn’t leave him alone” and trying to get me arrested so he could live in our apartment without me
* He never paid rent or bills in 4 years, and used my money for weed and beer
* He’s 42, working a minimum-wage job, refusing to improve his life in any way, still convinced he’ll “make it big” as a screenwriter with no portfolio, social media, or credits

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a green candle involves considering several meaningful factors that determine its quality, longevity, and overall experience.

**wax Type:** The type of wax used significantly impacts the candle's performance and environmental impact. Paraffin wax is a common and affordable option, known for its strong scent throw. Soy wax, derived from soybeans, is a natural and renewable option that burns cleaner and longer. Beeswax, produced by bees, is another natural option that emits a subtle honey-like scent and purifies the air.Coconut wax, often blended with other natural waxes, offers excellent scent throw and a clean burn.

The choice between these waxes depends on your priorities. If scent intensity is paramount, paraffin might be preferable. For those seeking an eco-friendly and long-lasting option, soy, beeswax, or coconut wax are excellent choices. Consider the source and processing methods to ensure the wax aligns with your values.

**Scent Profile:** Green candles come in a wide range of scents, each invoking different emotions and experiences. Earthy scents, such as moss, forest, and vetiver, create a grounding and calming atmosphere.Fresh scents, including green tea, cucumber, and eucalyptus, offer an invigorating and revitalizing experience. Floral scents, such as jasmine, green rose, and lily of the valley, add a touch of elegance and romance. Herbal scents, like basil, mint, and rosemary, provide a refreshing and stimulating effect.

The ideal scent profile is subjective and depends on your personal preferences and the desired atmosphere. Consider the strength of the scent and how it will interact with your existing decor and personal space. Sample scents, if possible, to ensure they align with your expectations.

**Burn Time:** The burn time indicates how long the candle will last before it's entirely consumed. This is affected by the wax type,size of the candle,and the type of wick used. Larger candles with natural waxes typically have longer burn times than smaller candles with paraffin wax. A well-maintained wick is also essential for maximizing burn time and preventing tunneling, which is the phenomenon where the candle burns down the center, leaving wax around the edges.

Consider your typical candle usage when evaluating burn time. If you light candles frequently, a longer burn time will be more экономичным. Choose candles with a burn time that aligns with your needs and preferences.**Wick Material:** The wick material plays a crucial role in the candle's burn quality and scent throw. Cotton wicks are a common choice, providing a consistent and reliable burn. Wood wicks, made from natural wood, offer a crackling sound that adds to the ambiance and often result in an intriguing scent throw. The wick should be appropriately sized for the candle diameter to ensure it burns evenly and prevents excessive smoking or sooting.

Different wick materials enhance different scent features. Cotton wicks facilitate even wax and heat distribution, whilst wood wicks release a distinct crackling noise providing additional ambiance. Choose your preference carefully.

**Container Material & Design:** The container material and design contribute to the candle's aesthetic appeal and also affect its safety. Glass containers are a popular choice, offering openness and a variety of styles. Metal containers provide a modern and sleek look. Ceramic containers add a touch of elegance and can be repurposed after the candle is burned.the container should be heat-resistant and stable to prevent accidents.

Consider the overall aesthetic of your space and choose a container that complements your existing decor. Ensure the container is durable and safe to handle when the candle is lit.

## FAQs Section

**Are green candles toxic?**
The toxicity of a green candle depends on its composition. Candles made with paraffin wax can release small amounts of toxins when burned, but these are generally considered safe for most people in well-ventilated areas. Candles made with natural waxes, such as soy, beeswax, and coconut wax, are considered less toxic and burn cleaner.

**How do I prevent tunneling in green candles?**
To prevent tunneling, allow the candle to burn long enough for the entire surface to melt each time you light it. This typically takes 1-2 hours for smaller candles and longer for larger ones. Avoid burning the candle for shorter periods, as this will cause it to tunnel and reduce its lifespan.

**What is the best way to store green candles?**
Store green candles in a cool,dry place away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures. This will prevent the wax from melting or fading and preserve the scent. Keep the candle covered or in its original packaging to protect it from dust and debris.

I have a new emotion, pure hatred and anger. I think I really hate how you mistreated me. I feel disgusted, like the thought of you touching me makes me cringe today! Thank the heavens! For how you pretended to love me for years, for years! I get staying for months or a year, but years of my life gone to a coward who couldn’t treat a woman with human decency and respect, who didn’t love me at all. A man who took from my soul, you literally took from my soul! You went silent for 8 months and walked back in, sat down with me and I shared my apology for holding on, for trying to make things better, but you didn’t say you were sorry for ripping my heart out the way you did. You said you loved me. You said the words “I love you too”. You hugged me for what felt like a half hour. You kissed me with love, then you took from me. You told me you thought we could stay in each others lives. You snake! You lied to me again! Then, you disappear, no words for several days, You didn’t call me or text even because you were at the beach, first for a weekend, then for a week. You email me and said you had to think about this. I reached my limit for disrespect. You couldn’t give me a 5 minute phone call in 10,000 mins within a week just to check in and be a decent man after having my body and heart for 8 years! Wth! You disrespectful little manchild, almost 50 years old.  If you don’t know after eight months, if you want to be with somebody or have them in your life, then you shouldn’t have done what you did. 

You hurt people you hurt people and I’ve seen you feel bad about yourself for it. Stop hurting women! Go spend time with your mother! You pretend to be this really good guy, all your friends think you’re this really great guy.  But you really are not. You keep friends for self image. You let people on only of they have something to give, to level you up! You think you are too cool for school! You boo hoo about this and that and you have never faced real struggle, never had it hard! NEVER! Your woe is me and never happy with what yuppy have when you have a good life! You’re selfish and think you deserve things you actually don’t deserve and people you don’t deserve because all you care about is yourself! You’re really cruel and mean and you know it.  I don’t know how you live with yourself with your lack of true care of humans while lying theough your tweth about being this caring good person. 

I see you now. I fully see you. You literally have turned into the biggest coward to mistreat someone who has loved with such awfulness. I bet you bitch about me to your little friend group. I want you to know I am so angry with you. So angry!!!! I really am so fricking mad that you, my ex best friend and lover for 8 years, mistreated me the way you did, with such cruelty. I am so mad at myself for trusting you, believing in you and us, for letting you into my heart all these years. I’ll never forgive myself for loving you. Before you, I was never going to let anyone in, and you had to turn it into overnights, talking until 3 am, laughter, tequila and irish whiskey, coffees in the morning and breakfast in the morning, and cuddling, adoration, trips to cabin and concerts and good times, and talking about your life, your friends. I know details of their lives I should not know, I also know how you feel about all of them (the good, the bad, all of it) and I don’t know them, your job, your parents, you, your past, your pain, your childhood! What am I supposed to do with all of this shit I don’t want in my brain. All the things I’ve done for you Throughout all of these years. I helped you and your father was sick to find a care coordinator, I helped you so much when he was sick. I offered you support and love when I found out he passed even after what you did! I was always there supporting you, being your biggest cheerleader, cheering you on in your accomplishments. Talking through everything with you!!!! Everything!!! 

The fact that you called us nothing more than friends makes me want to vomit in my mouth because we were never just friends. We never even met as friends. We were in a relationship that you refused to put a label on it because you’re a coward who thinks you would lose your fucking freedom or “space”. I even let that be the case because I was ok to be casual for awhile. You think there’s some perfect “one” out there. Well, I hope you find her. because I think you’re going to regret losing somebody that you got along with really well, who you made a great team with any time we went out of town and faced with obstacles, who could laugh and have fun and not bitch at you for anything. You know sometimes in a relationship you get just as much space as you do when your casual. You need help! You need some intensive therapy! I beg you to take care of yourself and get some therapy before you hurt another woman. And I think you know. You were so emotionally intimate with me. I know you better than anyone, you need to get some therapy for these issues. For how you mistreat women. I was so fucking good to you!  I was so patient, so caring, so kind, so giving! You are a complete mind fuck! Then you have the nerve to email me and tell me that you’re going to be dating soon. Like why????? Why tell me that? I’m pretty sure you were already dating people the last 8-9 months come on now.  Why bother to send that to me? I swear to goodness, if I ever see you again, I will straight look you in the face and never speak to you again, you will never deserve my words ever again. If I could hold onto this anger, I might just get the fuck over you. All the nights I cried, all the emotional breakdowns because you let me know you lied to me all this time. 

I almost completely lost myself after your words telling me I wasn’t worth it, you did not love me and then you gave me silence. You are not a good person, you really are not. I really think you could be a covert narcissist, I have been thinking about this for some time and talked to a Dr. about this. You have every trait and it’s crazy because I would’ve never figured that out had I not gotten to know you, had I not seen the way you look at women, treated me like an object and laughed about objectifying me. I’ll never forget that one. I did at least speak up about that. You were secretly horrible to me all behind lies and fake adoration and fake love.  The trips we went on together. Your passive aggressiveness dismissal of me, your way of making me feel not important at all and then love bombing me. Telling me you love me deeply. That you want me forever! Pretending to care, doing things to make it seem like you cared but actually would not show up when I was stuck on the side of the road  The closeness, the fun things we did together.  You really fucked my head up. I truly can’t wait to find a better man to love one day.  I can’t wait to give a better man my heart like I gave you. I really can’t wait to give this love to a man who deserves it. I really hope this anger makes me never ever think of you again. I hope this anger stays. I doubt it. But today at least for today, I hate you and what you did to me and that I trusted you to be good to me.",4,1753622874.0,Unsent_Unread_Unheard,2,1.0,False

I'm an amateur writer and have been slowly improving these past few months and am pretty happy with this piece. Hope you enjoy!

**I get paid to answer phone calls all day...but I am only allowed to listen**

We've all heard of odd jobs before. Quirky social media gigs. Requests from strangers on the internet. Sometimes legit, mostly illegal.

I want to warn you about my latest venture. The premise is simple, but confusing: You are paid to answer calls, but you can only listen. If you talk back, if you say anything at all, you're done.

Curious? So was I. But before I jump in, I want to set the scene for you. There's a lot of ground to cover, but I promise it'll be worth the wait. Let's start with the call center.

There’s a certain uneasiness in the building.

It’s not the lights, or the computers, or the AC rumbling through the white paneled ceiling. It’s deeper than that. A quiet, unnerving buzz. The longer you are here, the easier it gets. But the feeling never quite goes away. It just gets buried. Deeper and deeper into that steel case you call your mind.

You’d be surprised how many people there are in this office. It’s quiet. But it isn’t silent. Never silent. If you sit still long enough, if you really listen, you can hear them. The **voices**. The steady rhythm of desperation. Cries, pleas, whispers, screams. They’re not loud. Not loud enough to disturb anyone. Just soft enough to make your skin crawl. Like a bad feeling you can’t place.

They’re not coming from the workers. They’re pouring out of the phones. The never-ending sea of desperate callers ringing in day-after-day. Every call is different. Every voice is different. But the words? The stories? Always the same.

“Please,” they say. “I don’t know where I am. Something is outside the door. I need help.”

But no one responds. No one ever does.

Two cubes down, Martha—that’s what I call her—is filling out a crossword. She taps her acrylic nails against her desk like she’s typing away at an invisible keyboard. Then there is Debbie—again, not her name. But she seems like a Debbie. She is tall, brunette, and eating the same cheap parfait she brings in everyday. I think it’s strawberry flavored.

Nobody talks here. Not out loud. Not unless they still want to work here.

We don’t wear name tags. We don’t introduce ourselves. We don’t even wear our own faces. Everyone’s assigned a mask. Not the sanitary kind. Not the Halloween kind either. They’re...corporate. Sleek, smooth, almost artistic. I would describe it as a masquerade-style mask—without the usual glitter and tassels. They start just below the forehead and stop just above the mouth. 

They say it’s part of the experiment.

What experiment? Nobody really knows. That’s kind of the whole point. We’re not here to understand. We’re here to follow instructions.

Answer the call. Don’t say anything. Let them speak. Let them scream. Let them beg. Just sit there with the phone pressed to your ear and listen until the line goes dead. That’s it. That’s the job.

It seems cheap—gimmicky almost. Like we’re apart of the latest reality tv series where camera men are hiding in bushes with ulterior motives.

I thought the same at first. But if there is something that doesn’t lie, it’s money. And lots of it.

That’s why I’m here.

I’m Ariana. Nineteen years old. College dropout. A few semesters in, then I quit. *Way* too much debt, too little hope. Credit cards stacked like a tower ready to fall. I spent weeks scouring every corner of the internet for something—anything—that could get me back on my feet, even if just for a while.

That’s when Mabel introduced me to her profession.

Mabel was unique. Always dressed sharp—nice car, good career, Chanel bag casually tossed over her shoulder. A very independent woman. She lived in the city, paid her own bills, and did whatever the hell she wanted to. She was fun, serious, and motivating all at once.

We have been friends for a while now, but she always kept me at arms length. Sure we would go out and have a nice time together. Bond over past relationships and mutual interests. But there was something mysterious about her. She never really talked about her work. I assumed it was drugs or some kind of shady side hustle. It wasn’t like her to keep secrets.

But when she saw how down on my luck I was, she took pity.

Handed me a business card. And then, just as quickly, told me she never gave me that card. “If anyone asks you, I didn’t give you that card. You don’t know Mabel and Mabel don’t know you,” she said sharply. Apparently that was against the company’s rules. Nobody can know anyone else who works there.

I was confused. But curious.

I called the number. A voice answered. Cold. Mysterious. They asked me two questions.

“Do you break under pressure?”

“Do you know anyone else who works here?”

I said no and no.

That was it. No background check, no references. Didn’t even ask to see the resume I carefully prepared for the occasion.

They gave me an address and a time. Simple as that.

The onboarding was just as strange as everything else. You’d think I was signing up for some military program or a secret government project. Everyone was tight-lipped. No smiling. No small talk.

The rules were simple. And unsettling.

1. Arrive at the building exactly when your shift starts. Not a minute early, not a minute late.
2. Keep your mask on the entire time. No exceptions.
3. Don’t identify yourself. Don’t try to identify anyone else.
4. Do not respond or speak to the caller on the other end of the line.

It felt odd to say the least.

But I kept telling myself it was just one big experiment. They’re paying for data, not for us to help anyone. We’re not really answering calls. We’re the product. Being fed to someone or something higher up the chain.

That is what the assessors say at least. Assessors are basically glorified managers. People with a flashy degree and people skills that tell you the voices aren’t real. That the people on the other end aren’t people at all. They're artificial, synthetic. Part of the test and nothing more.

“Simulations,” they say. “You’re not hurting anyone. It’s about resilience. Exposure therapy. Mental strength.”

Sure buddy.

I don’t know what they are. I refuse to believe they are people. It wouldn’t make sense. But they don’t act like simulations either. They don’t sound fake. They sob. They stutter. They beg for their kids. They talk about the thing outside the closet, or the eyes under the bed, or monster outside their window.

You sit there. You listen. You grip your pen tighter and tighter until the call drops out or the screaming stops or there’s that awful, sudden silence like something just grabbed the person out of existence.

Then you breathe. You clear your throat. And the phone rings again.

You pick up.

I’ve been here eight months now. Not long. But long enough to know the rhythm. This job isn’t about smarts or motivation—it’s about routine. Muscle memory. You have to build your own little rhythm. Listening to terror all day eats at you—breaks you down slowly. I’ve seen it happen. New masks come in wide-eyed and curious, and by month two they’re breaking rules or just gone.

My routine is pretty straightforward at this point. I get in at 6:45 a.m. sharp. Same elevator. Same gray carpet. Same cubicle by the fire exit.

I don’t speak to anyone.

It’s safer that way—chatter is dangerous for me and for whoever’s already picking up calls.

At 7:00 a.m., my phone activates. The light goes on. Not a ring, never a ring.

Just the light.

Blue means wait. Red means answer. And when it’s red, you answer.

You don’t greet them. You don’t ask questions. You just listen.

And what you hear…

Well.

They’re always running.

Always hiding.

Always being chased by something they can’t quite describe.

A little boy whispering, saying something is scratching at his door. His mom won’t wake up.

A woman panting, saying she’s in the stairwell. Something is coming up behind her fast and the police aren’t answering her calls anymore.

A man with a crushed voice, locked in a closet. He mutters that he hears footsteps pacing back and forth, right outside, stopping every time he breathes.

Different voices. Same panic.

Some of them say they’re in a hallway. Or a small bedroom. Or under a sink.

Sometimes they describe this building.

The call center.

They’ll mention glass double doors. Or the color of the carpet. Or the smell of coffee from a nearby break room.

Sometimes they describe the workers.

“You have a mask,” they’ll say.

“Black gloves—I know you. You can help me.”

Then they scream.

We’re not supposed to react. Not even a twitch. I’ve gotten pretty good at it—neutral face, steady hands. A woman once asked me to sing to her while something chewed its way through her front door. I didn’t. But I wanted to.

It sticks to you. Even after the call ends. Especially then.

We all handle it differently. Food, puzzles, fidgeting—anything to let out the tension. 

To cope, I sketch what they describe. Not out of interest or enjoyment—just release. Macabre, maybe, but it makes the images leave my head a little faster.

Dark figures. Tall shadows. Doorways broken and bloody.

A lot of staircases.

And then, just when I start to forget—

The light turns red again.

The first few days were the hardest. But then my first check came in.

After just one month on the job, I paid off my student loans. That crushing weight finally lifted. I felt like I could breathe again.

A month later, I bought my first car—used, but reliable. Then I paid off my credit card debt. For the first time in years, the numbers in my bank account weren’t a burden I needed to figure out.

Now? I live in a multi-bedroom loft right in the city. The kind of place with exposed brick walls and big windows that let in way too much sunlight. I’m driving the car I used to drool over in magazines—the one I thought I’d never afford.

The money washes away the guilt at this point. Synthetic, manufactured guilt. Like a fresh coat of paint covering the grime beneath. Except the grime is just as processed as the paint at this point.

Maybe that was the point all along. Just an expensive, extravagant experiment. A cold, corporate bet that people will do almost anything for the right amount of cash—even if it means listening to fake snuff calls for hours on end.

That’s what I told myself. The calls were just noise. Background static to the paycheck.

Until I heard something I never expected.

It was a Tuesday afternoon. I was halfway through my shift—eyes drifting between the crossword puzzle I’d started yesterday and the dull glow of my screen. I was a little hungover, my head still fuzzy from last night’s bad decisions. Maybe that’s why I was so caught off guard. Maybe that is why I made this horrible mistake.

The phone turned red, I picked up instinctively—my eyes still fixed on the crossword puzzle.

“Hello? Is anyone there? I—I need help.”

The voice was faint but unmistakable.

It was her.

Mabel.

For a split second, I forgot where I was. Thought maybe I’d picked up my personal phone by mistake. My heart started to hammer.

“Mabel?” I whispered before I could stop myself.

The room was quiet. Not just the usual quiet of the call center, but something heavier, thicker. Like the room was holding its breath. I felt eyes on me—dozens of masked faces turned in my direction, watching. Waiting. I felt my face go red as hot embarrassment washed over me. I ducked my head below my cubicle wall—phone still pressed to my ear.

Shit. I was done.

Then Mabel spoke again.

“Wait… Ariana?”

I wanted to hang up, but something stopped me. I just didn’t understand—why was Mabel on the line? I’ve heard hundreds of simulated voices plead and beg for a response. I never imagined it could sound like someone you know. I was already reaching to hang up, but she said something strange.

Something…unexpected.

“Oh no… no, no, no,” she stammered, voice trembling with confusion.

A cold shiver crawled down my spine. This wasn’t the Mabel I knew.

Then she started laughing.

Not the light, friendly laugh I remembered.

A manic, broken laugh.

It didn’t stop.

I slammed the phone down.

I spun around, heart racing—and there she was.

A member of HR. Standing just at the edge of my cubicle. Black mask, notepad in hand. Expression unreadable.

She motioned for me to follow.

No words.

Just a slow, deliberate walk toward her office.

I sat down in the stiff plastic chair across from her desk, my mind still reeling. The call played on a loop in my head. The voice. The laugh. The way it sounded exactly like Mabel. I couldn’t stop shaking.

“You broke the rules. Yes?” she asked flatly, scribbling in her notepad without looking up.

“Yes, but—”

“You understand this means you are terminated from the call center, correct?”

She cut me off with such finality, like it was scripted. Like she was reciting lines from a procedure manual.

“I recognized her,” I said. “The voice. I thought I picked up my own phone by accident. I thought maybe it wasn’t even—”

That made her pause. She looked up for the first time. Her eyes were sharp behind the mask, almost disappointed. Or was it fear?

“You thought what?”

“It sounded like someone I knew. A friend of mine.”

She didn’t write anything down now. Just stared at me.

“When you first applied to this job, you answered two questions. Do you remember them?”

I hesitated. My stomach turned.

“They asked if I was good under pressure. And if I knew anyone who worked here.”

“And how did you answer?”

“No. I said no to both.”

She stared a moment longer, then slowly ripped a sheet of paper from her pad and slid it across the desk.

“You are hereby terminated from this experiment. You can collect your final check at the location printed on this slip. You’ve also been granted a severance equivalent to one month’s salary.”

I blinked at her. “Wait—that’s all?”

She didn’t respond. Just went back to typing. Like I wasn’t there anymore.

No explanation. No follow-up about the call. No mention of what I heard. Just a polite termination and a severance bonus.

I grabbed the paper without reading it and stormed out—past the rows of silent, masked employees, past the flickering overhead lights, and out into the daylight. I was halfway to my car when I realized I hadn’t even removed my mask.

I didn’t look back.

I felt everything over the next few days. Sadness, anger, confusion. Like my body kept going through the motions but my mind was stuck on a loop. That voice on the other end of the call. The thing that sounded like Mabel. I didn’t know what I was supposed to believe anymore.

On the second day, I caved and called her. Straight to voicemail.

That was weird. We were supposed to hang out next weekend—maybe grab drinks and vent about the call center. Mabel never ghosted me. Not even when she was sick or pissed or going through it. Something was off.

By the third day, I decided I needed to get out of the house. Clear my head. The address they gave me for my severance package wasn’t far, so I drove out.

It led me to a hotel. One of those upscale downtown places with giant flower arrangements and staff that wore gloves. I didn’t even see a front desk—just a wall of private mailboxes near the back. The code they gave me worked. The lock clicked open, and inside was a check. Neatly folded, like it had just been printed.

I left and crossed the street to the parking garage where I’d left my car. As I reached the elevator, I paused. There was someone standing on the sidewalk a little ways down, right outside the garage entrance.

Big blonde hair. Fur coat. Tall boots.

Mabel?

I stepped forward without thinking. Just a few feet—enough to get a better look. And that’s when I saw it wasn’t her.

Not really.

The thing looked like Mabel if she’d been made from melting wax. Too tall. Limping slightly. Her skin hung off her face in folds, sagging like old leather. Her mouth was slack. Her eyes—

God, her eyes.

Two hollow pits ringed with tiny, sharp, teeth. Her hands were worse. Loose skin, twisted fingers bent at angles that didn’t make sense. And yet people kept walking past her like she wasn’t there. They moved around her, avoided bumping into her, like she had a presence. She took up space, but no one looked. Not directly.

They didn’t see her. Not really. If they did, they would have been as terrified as I was.

The elevator behind me dinged and the doors opened. I ran inside, slammed the “close door” button with shaking fingers. As the doors slid shut, I heard footsteps on the concrete. Slow. Deliberate. Getting closer.

Too close.

I didn’t look. I didn’t want to see her again.

The elevator dropped me off a few floors up. I got in my car and drove. Fast. Too fast. Every red light felt like a trap. Every time I glanced out my window, I expected to see her there on the sidewalk. Moving along in slow, rhythmic motion like a snail wearing human skin.

I called a few friends on the way home. Just to hear voices. I didn’t tell them what I saw. Didn’t want to sound insane.

But I felt insane.

All those desperate calls I’ve been ignoring—month after month of people screaming and crying and begging—and now it’s like the floodgates have opened. Everything’s pouring in at once.

Maybe I was having a breakdown. That’s what I kept telling myself. Listening to pain and anguish everyday will do that to you.

I just needed rest. Some air. Maybe a little trip. I had money now. Enough to disappear for a few days. Clear my head.

And if I still didn’t feel right afterward, I’d find a therapist.

God knows I probably needed one anyway.

I took a detour from my apartment elevator to stroll through the lobby. I wanted to grab a few snacks from the shop beside the front desk before settling in for the night. I needed a bottle or two of something strong to drown out the sadness from my termination from the call center. I was crossing the front desk when I caught sight of something in the corner of my eye.

I turned, and there it was again.

Mabel. Walking toward me from the lobby entrance.

The sight gave me chills, but that feeling passed quickly.

I felt steadier after the drive. More level headed. I wasn’t afraid.

I was annoyed. This wasn’t real. It had to be some elaborate prank. Or a figment of my imagination. Either way, it couldn’t hurt me. I just needed to prove it to myself.

I looked around. Everyone else was just walking past. I held my hands out, desperate.

“Really? Nobody else is seeing this?”

I took a few deep breaths and started toward it.

“Hey sir—why are you following me?” I called out.

The thing didn’t say anything. Just kept lurching forward.

I stopped a few feet in front of it. The smell hit me first—sour, rotten. I winced at the sight of the bloated figure writhing and convulsing under its cheap Mabel disguise.

“Did you hear me? This isn’t funny, creep. I’m going to get security—”

*Chomp*.

A mouth. It tore open from the thing’s stomach and bit off the finger I was waving at its chest. Just like that. Gone.

I staggered back, screaming, clutching the bloody stump where my finger used to be. It kept limping forward. I screamed louder. Begging for help.

No one looked. No one even paused.

I turned and bolted toward the stairs, blood dripping behind me. I was halfway up when I heard the stairway entrance slam open.

It was coming.

I reached my floor and sprinted down the hall. Fumbled my key out of my purse with trembling, bloody hands. Got the door open. Locked it behind me. I backed away until my spine hit the wall at the other end of the apartment.

I pulled my phone out and started dialing 911 with my good hand.

Ring tone. Then silence.

No connection?

I checked my service. Full bars.

This didn’t make any sense.

I called friends. Family. My hairstylist. Nothing. No ring tone. Just silence.

I cursed and rushed to the peephole.

Nothing out there. Not yet. Just a wide, empty hallway.

Blood was getting everywhere. I could feel my heartbeat in my hand from all the pain and swelling. I stumbled into my bedroom, wrapped my finger to stop the bleeding, and popped a few painkillers. Once that was taken care of, I sat at my desk and opened my laptop. Tried to get online. Email. Social media. Anything.

Blank screen. No connection.

I sat down and cried. I didn’t understand what was happening.

Something was wrong. Not just with that thing in the hallway. Not just with me.

Reality itself was broken.

No one could hear me. No one could reach me. No one cared.

I was isolated. Trapped.

Food for something that wore my friend’s skin.

Maybe that was all that was left of her.

Then, it was here.

I heard a few limping footsteps outside the door. The light underneath the front door was stifled by something large standing outside it. I held my breath. Waiting. But nothing happened. It just sat there. Doing nothing.

I grabbed a knife and waited. It was bound to come in at some point. But it didn’t.

Hours passed. It was well into the night and the shadow was still there. It didn’t make sense.

I fumbled with my phone. I needed to get in contact with someone. I knew it was futile but I had to try again.

But then, I heard something.

Not from the phone—from the door.

It was Mabel.

“Hey…Ariana? I’m here. I need your help.”

I didn’t move. I didn’t speak. It was her voice. But it sounded wet. Guttural. Like it was her whispering through the mouth of a corpse.

“Don’t ignore me. Say something. Anything? I need to know you’re okay.”

It was monotone. No concern in its voice.

I carefully walked to my bedroom.

Then, a loud bang.

“Don’t walk away from me, Ariana. Talk. To. Me.”

The voice was deeper now. Less Mabel. More... something else.

I pushed my door closed with a soft click and covered my ears as a barrage of loud bangs broke out across the apartment. I heard them everywhere. My door. The ceiling above. The windows facing the city below.

The sound passed after an hour.

My body was so tired at this point. Partly exhaustion, partly the blood loss from my missing finger. I barricaded my door, clutched my phone, and rested my eyes in the empty bed.

I slept maybe an hour or two before something woke me.

I sprang up and looked toward the bedroom door. The shadow was under my bedroom door now. It had somehow gotten into my apartment.

It was standing there the same way it had outside.

But now it was here.

I realized I couldn’t escape this thing. Whatever it was, it was going to get me. Slowly but surely. It had no issue entering my apartment. It would have no problem breaking into my room. Maybe it was toying with me. Maybe it enjoyed the chase. I felt panic wash over me. 

“Leave me alone!” I screamed.

I heard a soft laugh break out just outside the door.

I returned to my phone. Started calling everyone in my contact list again.

Silence every time. Like the world outside my apartment building just vanished.

Then I realized something.

I realized the silence didn’t mean the calls were failing.

They were going through.

Every time.

No ringing, no static—just quiet. Someone on the other end was always there. Always listening.

It was the call center.

Every call I made…was routed straight back to the center.

I only figured it out because of a tiny, almost imperceptible sound—one you’d miss if you weren’t desperate enough to listen for it.

A spoon, scraping the bottom of a plastic parfait cup.

Debbie.

From work.

“Debbie?” I said into the phone.

No response.

Of course not. Debbie wasn’t her name. Just the one I gave her. None of us knew each other’s names. That’s how they designed it. Masks. Code numbers. Shift schedules that barely overlapped.

“Hey—I know you. Well… not know you, but we work together. Please. Just say something. I think you can help me.”

Still nothing.

And that’s when it hit me.

They wouldn’t answer.

Not ever.

They couldn’t.

We don’t speak. Not to them.

It didn’t matter what I said. How much I begged and cried. And could I really blame her? I ignored hundreds of calls just like this.

That is when I broke.

I started laughing.

Loud, cracked, borderline hysterical. The same kind of laugh I heard from Mabel, that day she realized the truth. That she was calling the same people she sat next to every day. That none of us said a word. Not when it mattered.

It was real.

All of it.

Real people.

Real demons.

God, those poor people. Men, women, and children. The poor children. 

The creature outside went quiet during my breakdown. Maybe it enjoyed my pain. Maybe it was hoping I’d walk out, still broken, right into its jaws.

Once the laughter died and I steadied my breathing, I felt a strange mental clarity. Could’ve been the painkillers. Or sleep deprivation. Either way, I had an idea.

If they respond, the creature moves on.

That was my theory. I never got confirmation from Mabel, but she had tried it. She screamed into the phone until someone broke the rules. And the thing left her alone—at least that was the hope. 

I needed to get someone to answer. To break the rules. Like Mabel did. Like I did.

I wracked my brain for anything I knew about the people I worked with. Something—anything—that could crack their armor.

Then it hit me—Martha.

She was always working during my shift. The one with the crossword puzzles and clacking acrylics. The only reason she came to mind was because I knew something about her I shouldn’t. We do our best to hide our identities—but every now and then something slips out. A phrase, the flash of a text on your personal phone, the hint of a tattoo.

Her mistake was much more telling—and easy to forget. One day I saw a brochure sticking out of her purse. Assisted living facility. I recognized the name. My mom had looked into it for my grandfather once. Nice place. Private rooms. Big windows. Expensive. Probably why Martha took the job.

I grabbed the phone.

Started dialing. Random numbers. Cold calling the call center. Over and over. Same silent line. Same hollow weight.

I listened for her.

I waited for the familiar tap of nails on the cheap plastic desk. Fast, plasticky little clicks.

Call. Hang up. Call. Hang up.

Nothing.

Was Martha even on rotation today?

I started to feel hopeless.

Outside the room, the door handle started to twitch. A soft rattle, like someone trying to figure out the lock.

It would be in here soon.

Then—I heard it. The clacking of nails.

I prepped the script in my mind.

I had one chance.

“Hello?” I said in the calmest voice I could manage.

No answer.

I take another shaky breath before continuing.

“I’m calling because your family member at Woodbrook’s is in the middle of a situation here.”

I hoped this was the right angle. During my time working there, every call was frantic—desperate. Just like me. But I couldn’t show it. Not if I expected this to work. Nobody at the call center would expect something so calm and collected.

The clacking stopped. I had her attention. 

Now I needed to drive it home.

“Sorry to call this line. Someone at the call center said it was your work line? I just need to confirm some information. Let’s start with your last name.”

I bit my tongue as the door began to unlock. It creaked open slowly. The barricade of furniture slid across the floor like it was a pile of empty boxes.

I put my hand over my mouth to stifle a scream.

What stood there wasn’t wearing Mabel’s skin anymore. That was gone—sloughed off like wet clothing. What remained was something raw. A bundle of dark flesh. Tentacles and mouths writhing in slow, deliberate motion. Snapping. Smacking. Clicking wetly against each other. They turned toward me slowly. The bundle of wiry flesh writhed towards me in unison.

I closed my eyes and tried to keep my voice level.

“Ma’am, this is an emergency. If I don’t get a directive right now I will need to call 911—”

I felt warmth descending upon my face. A hundred little mouths breathing on my skin in anticipation.

Then—she spoke.

“Is my mom okay?” she asked.

The sound of her voice felt like a lifeline being caught in the middle of the ocean.

I opened my eyes. To my surprise, the thing was gone. I caught just the tip of a black tendril vanishing around the corner toward my front door.

I grabbed the phone again. “Listen—this isn’t Woodbrook. I used to work with you. Something’s coming for you. The call center, it intercepts your calls, you need to get someone to respond—”

The line went dead.

I stood there, useless. I didn’t even know her name. Didn’t know what she looked like. And yet, I may have just sentenced her to a fate worse than what happened to me. Or Mabel.

I felt sick.

I didn’t leave my apartment for weeks.

I needed time to process everything.

I’m in a better headspace now. You can thank a lot of expensive therapy for that.

I got into this job for the money. I didn’t care about the calls. I told myself they were fake. But that was a lie.

The truth is—I was desperate.

I don’t know if I would’ve taken the job if I’d known what was really going on. Honestly, I probably still would’ve. That’s what scares me.

But now? I have a new purpose. A better one.

I’m going to end the call center.

I don’t know how yet. But I’m working on it. I owed it to Mabel. And Martha.

I don’t care if I go broke. If I lose everything. There are more important things than money in this life.

And this place is going to learn that the hard way.

Until then, you’ve been warned. Don’t accept a job from the call center that ignores desperate people.

Real people.

Scared people being chased by a real threat. I managed to make it out. But most people won’t be so lucky. Most people will be hiding in their homes. Crying. Pleading. Begging a bunch of corporate morons in masks to save them from something truly evil. 

But if you already work in a place like the call center, it isn’t too late. If you can help, help. Don’t sit idly by and listen to injustice. Don’t let the corporations tell you it’s all synthetic garbage. Use your own judgement. Be kind. Be curious. You may just save someone’s life.",4,1753622827.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

1mam8ft,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mam8ft,"10.3kg of Summer Haul Review 🌞 | (Stussy, Dior, Hellstar, CH, Acne, RL, Sp5der)","So, I’m around 174cm and sit at about 72kg. I usually go for a medium in most tops unless I want that little extra breathing room, then I’ll size up to an L. I like my tees to have a relaxed fit, not too oversized, just that nice laid-back drape. When it comes to bottoms, I’m a true 32, but I’ll sometimes size up if the cut looks tight or the waist seems a bit unforgiving.
This haul was mostly summer-friendly stuff, things I can just grab and wear without overthinking. It took exactly 17 days to reach me here in the EU. Box weighed just under 10.3kg. Here’s how everything held up outta the box ,

• Casablanca coords - Honestly, this one feels like a soft flex. The print is clean, quality is there, and the fabric’s got that light, breathable feel to it. Fits like a comfy M with just enough length, been reaching for this one a lot already.

• ESSENTIALS T-Shirt - Staple piece, no doubt. It has that signature boxy fit and solid weight to it. Branding’s lowkey and tasteful. True to size but still gives that relaxed streetwear vibe. Wore it to the grocery store and felt like I styled my life.

• Margiela T-Shirt - This one's for when I'm feeling a little artsy but don’t wanna try too hard. Stitching detail is on point, fabric’s thick but not hot. The fit is structured, not too oversized, just neat and intentional. Very clean look.

• Ami T-Shirt - Honestly, the quality on this surprised me. That little heart logo hits in person, and the whole just feels elevated. Easy to throw on when I want to look like I tried without actually trying.

• Rhude Shirt - The graphic slaps and it itself has that vintage wash that feels already worn-in (in a good way). Slightly oversized fit, pairs well with cargos or denim. Feels like a full outfit on its own.

• Chrome Hearts T-Shirt - Can’t go wrong with this. The logo is crisp, the print feels solid, and the cotton has some weight. Great piece for layering or just wearing solo. No loose threads or bad ink, looks and feels solid.

• Loewe T-Shirt - Definitely a sleeper hit. The embroidery looks super neat and detailed, and the fit gives quiet luxury. Not flashy, just polished. Can easily dress it up with a jacket or wear it chill with cargos.

• Balenciaga T-Shirt - Has that intentional oversized look, for sure. The washed black color and subtle print give it that cool, worn-in energy. But I like that grunge aesthetic sometimes, and this actually nails it for me.

• Hellstar shorts (1st) - Slightly softer vibe than the 2nd one but still graphic-heavy. Material feels a bit stretchier on this one. Looks really good with a light flannel, easily statement piece.

• Hellstar shorts (2nd) - This one’s bold af. Print is clean and eye-catching for me, and the fit sits well. Not too thick, not too light, ideal for pairing with open shirts or jackets.

• Ralph Lauren polo - You already know what this is. Clean, simple, reliable. Lightweight cotton, true fit. Been tossing it on for quick coffee runs.

• Stussy Shirt - This one’s got personality. Classic but not childish, and the quality is honestly better than I expected. Fit leans more streetwear but still super wearable day to day.

• Dior T-Shirt - The print on this is tasteful and not overbranded, which I love. The cotton has a premium weight and the fit has a nice drop shoulder feel. Definitely feels like something I’d wear on a night out with cargos and clean sneakers.

• Denim Tears shorts - Really impressed with this one. The print pops, cotton’s thick without being sweaty, and the overall structure feels quality. Sized TTS and it fits roomy but wearable.

• Acne Studios denim shorts - Aesthetic as hell. It’s minimal, structured. Material feels luxe and breathable. Wore it to brunch and instantly felt like a gallery person lol.

• Sp5der T-Shirt - Loud, fun, unapologetic. Colors are vibrant and the print is actually well done, no cheap cracking or weird ink issues. It’s definitely a weekend tee but in the best way.",1,1753622732.0,CoutureReps,1,1.0,False

I work partially remote, partially in the office. I don't really have anyone in my team that I would like to build a connection with, plus, anyway I wouldn't want it as it is mixing work and personal stuff too much. Outside of my team, it's a different story, but I almost never have a chance to interact with those people. I never have any work related topics with them, so no starting point there. The integration event is maybe once a year, sometimes not at all, this is historically where I had the most chances to talk to people outside of my team in an informal way, the other being trainings, which are also very rare and I have no influence over who will be there. Every time I walk past, people just seem so busy. They never seem to go for a coffee/tea break at the same time as I do, or even at all, so I have trouble catching them for a chat. All and all we are still at work, I have things to do, they have things to do. I even had an incredibly stupid idea to hang out with the people smoking, even though I do not, as they seem like the ones with most opportunities to socialize...

  
After work I just go home and do my hobbies/interests that I already have, and since most of them are solitary that's kind of the end of the story. I could start some social ones, but the thing is I know I will like them less than my current ones. I already have my hobbies. 

I am no longer in school or university.

Events are usually a one time thing, and to build some sort of rapport/familiarity you need repeated contact with the same people, which the above things actually do provide, they just suck in other ways

Through friends would be the best option, and I do have some friends, but there is rarely any ""new joiners"" and it is hard to get them to do something anyway. Nobody does house parties anymore, maybe aside from birthdays. The often cited behavior of setting up people is not really a thing.

Basically everything in my thinking part of the brain tells me that it's not worth it, yet the feeling part of myself would like to find someone. How do you reconcile those 2 things? Is this advice just meant for a different kind of person or what?",1,1753622616.0,dating,1,1.0,False

**Topics Covered**

• Order of taking NBMEs

• Mistake patterns

• Mimicking the exam experience

• How to deal with progress fatigue

• What to do in between NBMEs (how to review)

• Question-solving techniques

• Extra points

⸻

*First of all:*

Create a daily routine and follow it until your test day so your mind and body are trained and ready by the time you face the beast.
I know some of you night owls might not like this, but try to fix your sleep pattern. Sleep early and wake up early every day if possible.
 
Now let’s dive in.

⸻

**Order of Taking NBMEs (25 to 31)**

*Take NBMEs 25 through 31 in order, and try not to skip any if possible.*

-NBME 25 is for baseline. It tells you where you’re standing and exactly what you missed and need to go back and focus on.

-NBMEs 26 and 27 should be used as diagnostic tests for your weak systems and exam-taking skills. Try to figure out your mistake patterns (more on that below) and what systems you should work on.
Use Mehlman PDFs for weak systems, starting with the weakest. Try to study as many PDFs as possible if time allows.

-NBME 28 should be used after you’ve refined your weak systems and topics and worked on your exam-taking skills. You will also be familiar with NBME concepts and wording at this point, so you’ll hopefully see improvement.

-NBMEs 29, 30, and 31 are the most predictive. Keep them for last, after you’ve become familiar with NBMEs, sharpened your stamina, and gotten comfortable with the NBME question style. Keep up the good work and keep refining. There is always room for improvement.

⸻

**Mistake Patterns (very different from knowledge gaps)**

Ask yourself while reviewing your answers:

Why did I mess it up?

Did I misinterpret the question?

Did I not recognize the answer from choices?

Did I miss important clues?

Did I rush to answer?

Did I doubt myself and change the answer?

Was I tired and just started losing focus at this point?

❗️Focus on why you answered incorrectly, not just what the correct answer is.❗️

Be honest with yourself. Why aren’t you improving? Is it because your exam-taking skills are poor? You lack confidence? Or is it just because you truly need to study more? Are you doing your best? Again, be honest with yourself. 

⸻

**Mimic the Real Exam Experience**

Take every NBME as if it is the real thing.
Start at 9 AM.
Always mimic exam conditions.
Plan breaks. Sit at a desk with good lighting, not on the couch or in bed with dim lights.
Good posture is important. It is scientifically proven to improve cognitive performance and stress regulation.
Get rid of all distractions. Turn off your phone.

⸻

**How to Deal with Progress Fatigue, Sleepiness, and Headaches**

-Always sleep very well the night before and wake up early.

-It is better if you skip breakfast. It slows you down. (Personal opinion, do not come for me.)
Try to avoid the sugar crash. I usually skip breakfast, but I thought I needed a good breakfast before starting an NBME. Every time I ate, I crashed by the second block. If you are hungry, maybe eat between the last two blocks, but keep it light.

-Have your coffee without sugar and stay hydrated throughout.

-Keep breaks as short as possible. Fifteen minutes max.

-During breaks, walk around, stretch, and listen to music.

-If you tend to get headaches, take an analgesic with your morning coffee (how healthy lol).

-Reduce screen brightness slightly to avoid eye strain.

⸻

**What to Do Between NBMEs**

-STUDY (not just quickly review) your incorrect and guessed answers from First Aid. Review the concept itself, not just the correct answer.

-Always review your NBME very well before moving on to the next one.
❗️Do not move on to the next unless you have learned and improved from the previous one.❗️

-Do chapters 1–3 from Pathoma if you haven’t before, and revisit if possible.

-Do Mehlman’s HY Arrows PDF (at least twice during dedicated) and review the Risk Factors PDF. And check his free audio Qbank on YouTube (I listened every chance I got). 

-Work on your pacing, question-reading techniques, and stamina by doing daily random timed UWorld blocks.

*I recommend stopping UWorld and focusing only on NBMEs and Mehlman PDFs after hitting 65% on an NBME because they’re more “real deal” oriented and would train you to think like how the test writers want you to, unlike UWorld which wants to trick you in order to teach you. Unless you have time and want to continue.*

-Take breaks, reward yourself, and rest as much as you can, especially toward your last days.
Do not be hard on yourself or study 24/7. You will burn out and it will be nasty.
I started watching a new show 3 weeks before my exam, and it did not waste my time. It actually motivated me more.
*Show recommendation: Scrubs*

⸻

**Question-Solving Techniques**

*Do not ignore the solving hacks we hear about all the time. They actually work.*

-Read the last line first and then read answer choices before going back to skim over the question. 

-Try to eliminate wrong answers first.

-If it is taking more than 30 seconds, flag it and move on.

⸻

**Extra Points** (again, these are just my personal preferences, but give them a shot)

-For lab value questions, look at the values first. It makes it easier to exclude answers before even reading the question.

-For acid-base questions, quickly calculate the anion gap. You can often exclude two or three answers before even reading the stem.

-If it is a question you know will take time for you to solve (like remembering a mnemonic, a doodle, or a calculation), flag it and come back to it later.

-Before starting any NBME, get a piece of paper and write down the equations you might need, mnemonics you use, and a 2x2 table. It does not have to be from memory at first.
Do this every time you take an NBME.
By your fourth time, you will know them by heart and be able to do them from memory.

⸻

Let me say it again.
**Do the HY Arrows PDF**. It is not just for arrow questions. It reinforces physiology and covers all the important content in every system. I did it 3 times and would just skip to the arrows for my weak systems.

⸻

If this helped you, please leave a comment. 

Feel free to ask anything.

Thank you for reading and good luck 💕

\
WASHINGTON, D.C. (Worthy Satire) - In a bold move to save the American economy a full $0.008 per citizen, the U.S. Mint announced it is moving forward with plans to assassinate the penny -- the coin that costs more to make than it's worth and has spent the last 30 years hiding under couch cushions and gas station floors.\
\
""We've tried everything -- public shaming, rounding laws, even letting Canada shame us -- but the penny just won't die,"" said Mint spokesperson Paula Zinc. ""Now we're pulling the plug. It's over. We're melting Lincoln.""\
\
However, not all elements of the one-cent piece will perish. Officials confirmed that ""In God We Trust"" -- the national motto, spiritual lifeline, and fallback answer on every high school history test -- will be spared and reassigned to other currency like a divine game of musical chairs.\
\
""You can kill the penny,"" said Treasury Secretary spokesman, ""but you can't kill trust in God. That's been grandfathered in since about 1956.""\
\
Critics warned that removing the penny could disrupt the sacred tradition of grumpy men paying in exact change at the DMV, but proponents noted it might also spare countless Americans the embarrassment of scraping the checkout tray for 4¢ in public.\
\
Meanwhile, millions of pennies are reportedly hoarding together in coffee cans, preparing for what they call The Copper Rebellion.\
\
Stay tuned. Or better yet, just round up.\

1mam54y,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1mam54y/should_this_best_coffee_maker_technivorm/,Should this best coffee maker Technivorm Moccamaster be your pick,"Brewing coffee every morning has become one of my favorite rituals since I started using the Technivorm Moccamaster 53933. Straight out of the box, it felt like I was unpacking something truly premium. This coffee maker doesn't just brew a cup of coffee—it crafts an experience. With its sleek off-white finish and well-thought-out design, it immediately added a touch of elegance to my kitchen counter. But what really matters is how it performs—here’s my take on it.

**Design and Build Quality**  
From the moment I set eyes on it, this coffee maker stood out. It's clear the design team behind it paid attention to every detail. The off-white exterior gives it a minimalist yet sophisticated appearance, blending beautifully with any kitchen décor. It's surprisingly compact, measuring 6.5 inches deep, 12.75 inches wide, and 14 inches high, which means it doesn’t hog counter space—perfect for smaller kitchens or those who want an uncluttered look. The unit feels robust, weighing in at 6.25 pounds, and I couldn't help but notice its durable build. It's also handmade in the Netherlands, which gives a sense of craftsmanship and reliability. Fun fact: it uses a frustration-free packaging concept, so the unboxing process was refreshingly easy.  

**Ease of Use**  
This coffee maker screams simplicity in the best possible way. There's no overwhelming array of buttons or confusing settings to sift through. It functions with a straightforward, fully automatic mode, which even my technologically challenged relative could handle without issue. Once you set the selector switch, it brews either a half or full carafe, allowing for flexibility depending on your caffeine needs. Brewing a full 40-ounce pot takes just 4–6 minutes, and the process is smoother and quieter than any coffee maker I’ve used before. Oh, and if you’re in a rush and need to pour a cup mid-brew, the automatic drip-stop function saves the day by preventing spills. It’s the little touches like this that elevate it from a basic coffee machine.

**Key Benefits**  
- Consistently heats water to the ideal temperature for coffee extraction.  
- Brew selector switch gives control over half or full-carafe brewing.  
- Operates quietly and shuts off automatically after 100 minutes.

**Coffee Quality**  
When it comes to what truly matters—coffee quality—this machine doesn't disappoint. The pump-free design heats water to the precise temperature required for optimal extraction, creating rich, flavorful coffee every single time. I tested it with multiple coffee bean blends, from light roasts to darker options, and I can confidently say that this machine brings out the best flavor profiles in every batch. The glass carafe keeps the coffee warm without burning it, thanks to the unique hot plate system. That heating element ensures the coffee stays at just the right temperature, whether you're planning to sip your coffee slowly or serve a group. It’s also worth mentioning that I noticed no bitterness—a problem I’ve encountered with other machines when the water temperature fluctuates.

**Energy Efficiency and Safety Features**  
This coffee maker won me over with its thoughtful design in the energy-efficiency department. The automatic shut-off feature kicks in after 100 minutes, which is both a safety and energy-saving win. As someone who has occasionally forgotten appliances running, this feature provides peace of mind. Despite its power, this unit runs quietly, so the brewing process won’t disrupt your morning Zen or wake up sleepy roommates. The 120-volt operation ensures compatibility without requiring additional devices or converters.  

**Disadvantages**  
- At 6.25 pounds, it's not the most portable machine if you'd like to move it often.  
- Requires paper filters, which aren't everyone’s favorite since they add ongoing costs.  

**Competing Products**  
One of the most common rivals in this category would be the Breville Precision Brewer. While it offers a ton of customization options and a similar level of coffee quality, it can be overwhelming for someone who prefers simplicity. The Moccamaster, in contrast, focuses on ease of use while still delivering exceptional performance. On the other hand, brands like Keurig provide convenience through single-serve pods, but they can’t match the depth of flavor or sustainability offered here. For my needs, where coffee quality and streamlined operation matter most, the Technivorm model sits in its own league.  

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
When comparing the expense to its features and build, this machine offers impressive long-term value. The five-year warranty alone shows their confidence in the product's durability. When I factored in the consistent coffee quality, ease of use, and efficiency, this coffee maker became a worthwhile investment in my morning routine. Sure, it's an upfront commitment, but better coffee at home means fewer trips to overpriced cafes.

1mam40l,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mam40l/why_choose_west_bend_54159_electric_coffee/,Why Choose West Bend 54159 Electric Coffee Percolator? Honest Review for Coffee Lovers!,"The **West Bend 54159 Classic Stainless Steel Electric Coffee Percolator** quickly found its way into my morning coffee ritual. As a dedicated coffee enthusiast, I was curious to see if this classic-style percolator could hold its own amongst the more modern drip machines and pod systems. Let me break down the experience of brewing with this piece of kitchen equipment, both the positives and the areas where it could use a little extra shot of espresso—figuratively speaking.

**Classic Design and Aesthetic Appeal**  
I must admit, the sleek stainless steel body with its chrome mirror finish immediately caught my attention. It feels almost nostalgic, but with a polished touch that looks great on any countertop. The heat-resistant handle and base are fantastic features for clumsy folks like me who have a knack for spilling hot beverages. Measuring 7"" by 9.5"" by 12.5"", the size is generous yet compact enough not to clutter your kitchen space. To my delight, this coffee percolator brought a retro charm to my modern kitchen, and I received quite a few compliments during brunch gatherings. 

**Ease of Use and Setup**  
The first thing that stood out was how intuitive this percolator is to use, thanks to its manual operation mode. All you really need is ground coffee—no pods, no complicated buttons, and no learning curve. The percolator's ready-to-serve light is a simple yet genius inclusion, letting me know when my coffee is ready without second-guessing. And the detachable cord? A real game-changer. It makes table-side service so much easier, avoiding awkward wire tangles during your coffee-pouring ceremony.

**Perks**  
- Durable stainless steel construction, including reusable components like the stem and basket.  
- Ready-to-serve indicator light simplifies the process.  
- Keeps coffee warm automatically after brewing is complete.  
- Dishwasher-friendly parts make clean-up an absolute breeze.  

[Check West Bend 54159 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0036ws1fa/)  

**Performance and Brewing Quality**  
The percolator claims to serve between 2 to 12 cups, and it delivers well on that promise. I’ve tested it for a single cup on a rushed weekday and a full 12 cups during a family brunch, and it worked flawlessly on both occasions. The brewing process is faster than I expected for a percolator. I was pleasantly surprised by how smooth and warm the coffee remained, thanks to its “keep warm” feature. That said, the coffee’s taste leans heavily on the grind size and amount used, so a little experimentation might be needed to discover what works best for your palate. 

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
- Does not support fine espresso ground coffee very well.  
- The chrome mirror finish, while beautiful, is prone to fingerprints and smudges.  
- Slightly heavy at 2.74 pounds, which might be a consideration for those with limited upper body strength.

**Challengers**  
Coffee-makers today come in every shape and size, so it’s natural to wonder how this one stacks up against competitors. Compared to drip machines like the Technivorm Moccamaster, this percolator wins points for its simplicity and retro charm, but the Moccamaster may edge ahead in terms of precise temperature control. If pod machines like the Keurig are more your speed, you’ll miss out on the sustainable, long-term benefit of avoiding single-use pods—a big win for the West Bend percolator. While French presses like the Bodum Chambord offer a more hands-on brewing process, they lack the convenience of the percolator’s automatic keep-warm feature.

**Affordable Quality**  
Considering its stainless steel construction, reusable filter system, and old-school charm, this product offers a solid balance between price and performance. While it might not come with the intricate features of high-end models, it certainly justifies the price tag with its versatility and durability. It’s not every day you find a coffee maker that can handle both large family gatherings and quiet mornings with equal ease.

Then ayun nga, a few days after ng libing ni tita may padasal sa bahay, yung bahay namin is an old wooden Filipino ancestral house so alam nyo na creepy talaga and madami dami na din akong weird experience dito Pero dito talaga ako pinaka natakot ng sobra.

Di ako naka attend ng padasal, college student pa ko noon at kakauwi ko lang, naabutan ko patapos na kaya naghintay lang ako na matapos yung padasal tsaka ako nakikain haha.

Siguro mga around 1am na Yun habang naglalaro ako ng PC games, kami lang ng lola ko nasa bahay at maaga Yun natutulog tapos mga 3am gising na, naisipan ko magtimpla ng kape, bumaba ako sa hagdan para kumuha ng mainit na tubig sa lumang thermos ng lola namin, nasa hagdan pa lang ako wala na ako makita sa baba as in totally black at medyo iba na pakiramdam ko parang nakakakilabot na dilim yung nasa harapan ko tapos yung switch ng ilaw nandoon pa sa dulo ng kusina mga 15 steps pa pagbaba ng hagdan.

Syempre ayoko bumalik sa kwarto ng walang dalang kape kaya lakasan na lang ng loob at sanay naman ako sa usual na dilim dito sa bahay Pero this time medyo mabigat pakiramdam ko na parang may something lurking dito sa kusina.

Pagbaba ko ng hagdanan mga 2 to 3 seconds medyo nakapag adjust yung mata ko at may mga nakikita na akong silhouette ng hallways, ref, tables, chairs, etc. and besides kabisado ko naman na. Napaka unusual dahil hindi naman talaga ganito kadilim dito. Nung nasa gitna na ko ng kitchen, may naamoy akong bulaklak na kaamoy nung lamay ni tita, basta amoy bulaklak na halo halo pakshit, napahinto ako kasi nagtatayuan na yung mga balahibo ko sa Batok, tapos sa may bandang Cr malapit sa dirty kitchen sa sulok, may naaninag ako na shadow na parang nakatungo like hunched forward tapos narinig ko umiiyak, yung iyak nya is parang hagulgol na mahina. Alam Nyo yung taong iyak ng iyak tapos pinipigil nya? Parang ganun yung naririnig ko, tapos palakas ng palakas yung iyak at palapit ng palapit yung shadow figure, alam ko kasi nag step forward pa ko para aninagin kung lumalapit nga. 

Langya yun na pala huling galaw ko dahil sobrang nanigas yung mga paa ko hindi ko maigalaw sa  sobrang takot, freeze malala, yung hawak ko lang na mug yung nararamdman ko na nagagalaw ko dahil nanginginig na ko, gusto ko mag step back di ko magawa, nung pinilit ko ialis yung tingin ko dun sa shadow figure naipihit ko yung leeg ko patalikod dun ko na naigalaw yung mga paa ko, dun ko nalaman na pwede pala akong maging runner sobrang bilis ko tinakbo yung bahay namin palabas hanggang dun sa street sa labas ng gate feeling ko 5 seconds ko lang tinakbo sobrang adrenaline yung naramdaman ko palabas ng bahay.

Tapos dun sa labas habang hinihingal pinipilit ko unawain kung ano ba talagang nangyari di ako makapaniwala, pag sobrang takot pala di mo na magagawang sumigaw, talagang you'll be frozen like shit. Not my first time na may nakita Pero it's the first time na parang close encounter kumbaga. Nakasalubong ko yung pinsan ko sa gate na pauwi na sa bahay at kinuwento ko sa kanya yung nangyari, kaya ang ending pareho kaming tumambay hanggang magising na yung lola ko at mag bukas ng ilaw sa kusina. 

At dala ko pa din yung coffee mug.

(Cozy farm rp),"Marrow Hills was a 20 arce family farm, primarily focused on season crop: apples, sunflowers, pumpkins. Orginally self-sufficient farm now turned into agriculture tourism. Come by during july for a sunflower dinner below the fireworks for Independence day. Or swing by in September and October for a cup of apple cider and a pumpkin for carving. ""We also have classes throughout the year for you and your friends. Have a happy day and a good Marrow from us, at Marrow hills."" It was a good sales pitch and business was exploding this year. 
Forrest had mixed feeling on the farms growth. He remembered when his dad inherited the farm from his dad. Forrest's father Eric was ad savey and had a dream for the run down farm. 
Forrested liked the farm. Rusty tractor and all. With 8 chickens and cow, both needing attention morning anf evening. Forrest related more with the animals than the swarm of fall mommies that sold out the pumpkin coffee as soon as Eric press released: dont be latte for the halloween season. 
Currently, Forrest was loading up the pumpkins from the field, checking for blemishes and rot before toting them up to the front.

1mam2t4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1mam2t4/explore_the_best_coffee_maker_keurig_kduo_special/,Explore the Best Coffee Maker Keurig K-Duo Special Edition Worth It,"I have been using this versatile coffee maker for a few months now, and as someone who thrives on caffeine to jumpstart mornings, the Keurig K-Duo Special Edition has been a real game changer. With its clever combination of single-cup brewing and a carafe option, this coffee machine offers the flexibility I need, whether I’m rushing out the door or hosting brunch at home. Before diving into the specifics, I’ll admit I was intrigued by its sleek design and promise of brewing both K-Cup pods and ground coffee. Spoiler alert: it did not disappoint.

**Design and Aesthetic Appeal**  
The Keurig K-Duo Special Edition truly stands out as one stylish piece of kitchen equipment. Its silver finish is sleek enough to add a touch of sophistication to the countertop while blending effortlessly with other kitchen appliances. It doesn’t take up an excessive amount of space at 12.76 x 10.94 x 12.92 inches, though I’d recommend a bit of clearance if you plan to store mugs or pods nearby. The build feels sturdy despite it not being the lightest coffee maker around at 12.51 pounds. It’s not just a pretty face either—it’s designed to be highly functional.

**Ease of Use**  
Brewing coffee shouldn’t be complicated, especially before I’ve had my first cup, and this machine keeps it simple. The “Smart Start” feature is a lifesaver. With a single process, it heats and brews, so there’s no awkward waiting period between selecting your brew size and actually enjoying your coffee. If you’ve got guests waiting for coffee during a gathering, the “Pause & Pour” feature lets you pour a cup mid-brew in under 20 seconds. I’ve tested it more times than I can count, and it works seamlessly every time.

**Good Points**  
- Flexibility to use both ground coffee and K-Cups.  
- The shared 60 oz. water reservoir efficiently reduces the need for constant refilling.  
- Programmable Carafe Auto-Brew allows for a fresh pot of coffee in the morning without any extra effort.  
- Multiple size options for both single cups and carafes, fitting a variety of needs.  

[Check Keurig K-Duo Special Edition price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b095xdqpzc/)  

**Performance and Brewing Quality**  
The Keurig K-Duo performs exceptionally well in terms of brewing quality. The “Strong Brew” button is a standout; I often prefer a bold and intense flavor, and this feature delivers just that. Whether I’m brewing a single 8 oz. cup or a full 12-cup carafe, the coffee is consistently rich and smooth. Having hosted numerous gatherings, the heating plate has been a lifesaver in keeping coffee hot without altering its taste. I also love that the brewing sizes can be tailored, which is as convenient for a solo coffee lover like me as it is for a brunch crowd.

**Functionality and Features**  
The coffee maker offers flexibility that’s hard to beat. The compatibility with both K-Cups and ground coffee means I’m not locked into one kind of brewing method. The 12-cup glass carafe with its metallic handle feels premium and practical. Setting the programmable auto-brew feels like cheating at mornings; I set it up before bed, and voila, hot coffee greets me without fail. On lazy weekends, I’ve brewed a small, single cup just for myself and then switched to the larger carafe when friends came over. The large water reservoir, shared across both single-serve and carafe options, is a highly practical touch, drastically cutting down the hassle of constant refills.

**Shortcomings**  
- Occasionally, the carafe lid feels a bit flimsy when pouring.  
- Cleaning the unit can be tedious due to its multi-functionality.  
- Not the most compact option for those with tiny kitchens.  

**Market Rivals**  
Comparing the Keurig K-Duo Special Edition to other dual coffee makers reveals that it fares well overall. The Hamilton Beach FlexBrew is another strong contender with similar functionalities, but in my experience, its build feels slightly less premium, and it lacks the sleek aesthetic of the Keurig machine. The FlexBrew wins in affordability but doesn’t quite deliver the same level of smooth, bold coffee, particularly in single cups. On the other hand, the Cuisinart Coffee Center has a larger water reservoir but seems overly cumbersome to clean compared to this model. If single-cup brewing or design are priorities, the Keurig edges out.

**Quality for Price**  
Considering all the features packed into this coffee machine, I’d say it offers excellent value for its price point. The versatility alone, with options to brew everything from a single 6 oz. cup to a full 12-cup carafe, makes it feel like you’re getting more than one coffee maker in a single machine. While it’s not the cheapest option on the market, its build quality, consistent performance, and feature set make it a worthy investment for serious coffee lovers.

I found myself with too many pieces of paper and complicated Excel sheets with my coffee notes. It was getting chaotic  - and my partner was getting angry...  So I created an app that allows you to track and rate your coffee.

The idea is simple: you log your shots (parameters like grind size, dose, extraction time, etc.) to gradually improve your shots over time. I found this especially challenging when I had multiple coffees at home that I used in parallel.

I know there are already apps out there that can do this, so honestly, I’m not sure if there’s even a need for yet another one. But I wanted to put this out there to anyone who might want a lightweight, free option that works on any device (Desktop, iOS, Android).

If you’re interested, here’s the link to check it out: [Perfect Cup](https://coffee-nine-omega.vercel.app) -- you can even check it out with a test account under ""login"" ;)

I’d love to hear what you think—good, bad, or brutal—and if there’s anything you wish it had or could improve on. This is very much a side project, but I’d love for it to genuinely help others in the espresso community if possible!

What the hell was wrong with “bedroom kids”? I keep seeing stuff about this and can’t stand the idea.

We don’t have a dining room/table due to space so we eat at the coffee table.

DH made no effort despite making eye contact with me as I stood in the door way assessing where to sit, to tell SS to move over or to go upstairs etc.

Ideally she wouldn’t be allowed to play PS in the living room, she has one in her room! They have all the toys in the world, a TV with every subscriptions service available and a PS4 but yet she takes over the living room ALL day.

Am I wrong to think they should use their bedroom for things like PlayStation time, movies/cartoons rather than subject the whole house to it. Obviously I don’t mean they can’t be in the living room but I don’t think it should be for their entertainment and our tolerating.

1mam01u,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountertopConfessions/comments/1mam01u/find_out_if_the_ninja_cm300_coffee_maker_delivers/,Find Out If the Ninja CM300 Coffee Maker Delivers Perfect Brews,"If coffee-making were an Olympic sport, the Ninja CM300 would definitely have a shot at bringing home a gold medal. I recently got my hands on this coffee machine, and after weeks of putting it through its paces, I feel like I’ve found a solid contender in the world of drip coffee makers. The Ninja CM300, with its promise of versatility and convenience, seems designed for the modern coffee enthusiast who doesn’t want to rely on pods, loves variety, and appreciates a sleek, sturdy kitchen companion.

**Design and Build Quality**  
At first glance, this coffee maker feels robust and well-built. The black exterior with stainless steel accents gives it an elegant and modern touch, making it blend into any kitchen decor effortlessly. It’s neither too bulky nor overly compact, fitting comfortably on my limited counter space without crowding it. The 12""x8.75""x15"" dimensions were surprisingly space-efficient, given all its features. The removable water tank is a genius touch. I’ll admit, my clumsiness has resulted in a few spills with other coffee makers, but the pull-away design made refilling a sink-side affair, mess-free and hassle-free.

**Features I Can’t Stop Talking About**  
What stands out about this machine is its versatility. It offers three brewing styles: Classic, Rich, and Over Ice. I tested all three, and each brewed consistently satisfying results. On hot summer days, Over Ice became my go-to, perfectly extracting flavor while keeping the coffee vibrant and never watered down. The six brew sizes are another massive plus. I enjoy flexibility in brewing a solo mug in the mornings and a full carafe when hosting friends for brunch. The 10-cup glass carafe even comes with an adjustable warming plate to keep coffee hot and fresh for up to four hours, which was a lifesaver during my never-ending Zoom meetings.

**Benefits**  
Here are the upsides to owning this coffee machine:  

- Three brewing styles ensure every type of coffee craving is covered.  
- The pull-away water tank simplifies refilling significantly.  
- Six size options cater to solo or group coffee-drinking scenarios.  
- Quality glass carafe with a warming plate maintains fresh and hot brews.  

[Check Ninja CM300 price on Amazon.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b09xy4h285/)  

**Performance in Everyday Use**  
Each day with the Ninja CM300 felt like a small win. Programming the machine for a delayed brew (it comes with a 24-hour delay function) became a part of my evening routine, setting it up to greet me with fresh coffee the next morning. The fully automatic operation is intuitive, even for someone like me who usually fumbles with too many buttons and settings. Each cup was brewed consistently to the selected strength and size, never missing the mark. I appreciated the reusable filter—no more running out of paper filters at the last minute!

However, I wished it included the double-sided scoop mentioned in the specs, as mine didn’t come with it. I had to dig out an old one from my kitchen drawer, and while that didn’t interfere with functionality, it was a small letdown.

**Flaws**  
Some less favorable aspects I noticed during weeks of testing:  

- The coffee maker didn’t include all accessories listed, such as the scoop.  
- The glass carafe, although sleek, is more fragile and requires extra careful handling.  
- It could take up slightly more vertical space under low cabinets due to its height.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this to other models I’ve tried or seen, the Ninja CM300 holds its ground firmly. Machines like the Keurig K-Elite tend to shine with pod-based brewing and similar iced coffee functions. However, the environmentally-friendly reusable filter of the Ninja CM300 sits better with me. The Keurig might win on pod variety, but the Ninja outshines it with the larger brew sizes and customization. Versus a standard drip coffee machine, this coffee maker's iced coffee option and customizable brew strengths give it an edge. Does it sweep the competition in every category? No, but it holds a distinct appeal for a settings-loving coffee fan like me.

**Worth Every Penny**  
I find the Ninja CM300 very reasonably priced for what it offers. The fact that it brews full-sized carafes and single cups alike adds enormous value—it’s like having two machines in one! Comparable alternatives like Breville or Keurig models may require spending extra to get similar flexibility. Though there’s no denying some other brands include more premium features, they often lean on the bells and whistles rather than core performance. Here, I feel you’re paying for real functionality rather than overpriced frills.

Soooo I just wrapped up 3 months on Mounjaro and thought I’d share how it’s been going, mostly for fun, partly because this subreddit has helped me quite a bit!

I started at 102 kg on April 25th, and today I’m at 81.5 kg. My goal weight for now is 68 kgs! I shall reassess once I reach that weight! That’s wild to think about. It’s been a whirlwind of a journey! Honestly, the appetite suppression alone helped me change my habits so drastically that I sometimes shock myself when I say no to certain foods or drinks. Who is she??

My brain is still playing catch-up with what I see in the mirror. I don’t always feel like I look different, until I do photo comparisons or try on old clothes that now hang loose.

I have always been the fat one my entire life - maybe from around grade 3! I didn’t have a particularly traumatic time being fat, apart from the usual “*patli ho ja apni health ke liye*” comments. I wasn’t bullied or put down for my weight (or maybe it's repressed, idk). But I definitely did get a wake-up call when I saw my HbA1c at 7.0 (diabetic range) in April. Today? It’s 5.4. NORMAL! I could cry tears of joy!

**Dose:**

I started with 2.5 mg weekly for the first 4 weeks, then moved up to 5 mg — initially taking it weekly, but the appetite suppression was *so* strong that my doctor suggested spacing it out to every 10 days. That worked for a bit, but eventually I noticed hunger creeping back in around day 6 or 7, so I’m now back to a weekly schedule. I plan to stick with the 5 mg dose until the 7.5 mg KwikPen becomes available!

**Side effects:**

Just some constipation here and there (fibre gummies + water help). A few random anxiety episodes + heart racing turned out to be low blood sugar—sorted it out with a little coffee + sugar

  
**Food & Tracking:**

 I have been super consistent with tracking my food! I was initially tracking daily, but that was not working for me, so I started cycling weekly after reading some helpful posts on other subreddits. It works the best for me. My 1st priority is to hit the protein goal and then fibre

I have just reintroduced chawal into my diet but I was completely off roti, chawal and sugar before this. I only eat raagi roti and, once in a while, multigrain bread. I have substituted my sugar with monk sugar and completely stopped anything with processed or added sugar

I am on a few supplements as well - Vitamin B12, Inositol, Magnesium, Collagen powder, albeit not as consistently as I would like

**Exercise:**

Not as much as I’d like to, but that’s mostly because I’ve joined the gym one too many times in my life only to drop off later. This time I’m focusing on building sustainable habits instead of going all in and burning out. I walk 6000 to 10000 steps a day, depending on how hectic my day is. For strength training, I try to stick to two times a week max, following YouTube videos with my adorable little 2 kg dumbbells — baby steps, but consistent ones!

**NSVs:**

The biggest one for me is that I now *know* when I need food, rest, electrolytes, or a supplement boost — something I never tuned into before. I’d run on coffee and fumes for *days*. This is the first time I’ve felt like I’m taking care of myself like a grown-up (finally?).

Hang in there — it’s a wild but deeply worth-it ride 💛

1malx30,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1malx30/explore_the_brita_ob08_water_filter_review_does/,Explore the Brita OB08 Water Filter Review Does It Truly Reduce 2x Contaminants?,"The Brita OB08 Plus Water Filter, a BPA-free high-density replacement filter, has quickly become a staple in my household, and its performance has been genuinely impressive. It’s marketed as reducing twice the contaminants compared to standard filters, and I wanted to see if it lived up to those claims. With a family of four, we go through water like there’s no tomorrow, so I figured this would be the perfect test environment. 

**Design That Matches Functionality**  
Right out of the box, the compact and lightweight design of this filter stood out. Measuring 7.25”D x 2.41”W x 5.5”H, it fits seamlessly into all compatible pitchers and dispensers. The packaging mentions compatibility with all Brita systems except Stream, and true to its word, it slid effortlessly into our Brita pitcher without any hassle. Also, the high-density plastic construction feels sturdy and well-made. While it isn't anything overly flashy, the simplicity of the design serves its purpose well.

**How It Performs Under Daily Use**  
After replacing the standard filter in my pitcher with this, I noticed an immediate difference in water taste. The BritaPlus filter dramatically improved the flavor by reducing the chlorine content, leaving a fresh and clean taste. This filter is also great at cutting down on impurities like copper and cadmium thanks to its built-in ion exchange resin and activated carbon. It's perfect for someone like me who tends to be picky about water quality. Even after multiple uses during the day, from morning coffee-making to dinner prep, the crisp quality of water remained consistent.  

[Check Brita OB08 Plus Water Filter price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b0ckv2tclj/)  

**Advantages of This Filter**  
One of the most notable upsides is its longevity. Rotating through one filter every two months for 40 gallons of water is a real game-changer, especially with how much our family drinks. That’s roughly the equivalent of replacing 300 single-use plastic bottles per filter, which matches the product's eco-friendly promise. And let’s not overlook the built-in mesh screens that prevent annoying black flecks (we’ve all been there with cheaper filters). Here are a few more highlights:  
- Enhances water taste and reduces odor from chlorine.  
- Fits most Brita pitchers and dispensers easily.  
- Environmentally friendly by reducing plastic bottle waste.  

**Areas Needing Progress**  
While the Brita OB08 Plus filter has made significant strides in offering quality filtration, it’s not perfect. One minor downside is the initial setup, as it requires flushing to remove carbon dust, a process I find mildly tedious. Additionally, the filter doesn’t support Brita Stream systems, which might be a dealbreaker for users of that line. Lastly, the two-month lifespan, though decent, can feel a bit short if you're in a household with heavy water consumption.  
- Initial filter flushing takes effort.  
- Not compatible with Brita Stream models.  
- Filter lifespan could be longer for large families.  

**Eco-Friendly Mission Achieved**  
One of the perks of switching to this filter is its substantial reduction of single-use plastics. I’ve always been cautious about plastic waste, so knowing that each filter offsets about 300 plastic bottles is a genuine win for both my household and the environment. For families aiming to go greener, this aspect alone makes the upgrade worth it. Plus, the sustainability factor doesn’t compromise the quality of filtration.  

**Alternative Products to Consider**  
When it comes to water filtration, there are plenty of contenders in the market. Zerowater pitchers, for example, promise advanced 5-stage filtration, and while their filters do remove more solids than Brita, they tend to be bulkier and pricier. PUR replacement filters offer comparable contaminant removal, but in my experience, they often lack the consistent clean taste that Brita provides. So while the competition is fierce, this particular option finds the right balance between quality, taste, and affordability.

**Smart Spending Choice**  
Without dropping exact figures, the Brita filter strikes a practical balance between premium performance and budget-friendliness. Compared to higher-end, over-complicated systems, it makes for an easy, affordable upgrade without overspending. Given its focus on reducing plastic waste and providing cleaner water, the bang for the buck here is undeniable.

A self-proclaimed pour-over enthusiast, I decided to put this gadget to the test and see if it could deliver café-quality coffee from the comfort of home.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The compact and clean design immediately stood out. Its minimalistic white finish fits effortlessly into any kitchen—a subtle addition rather than an eyesore clashing with existing appliances. The build feels sturdy enough for daily use, and weighing only 7.8 ounces, it’s surprisingly light. The dimensions—5.25"" x 5.25"" x 5.25""—make it easy to store, so even those with tiny kitchen counters won't need to worry about space. I especially appreciated the dishwasher-safe feature since cleanup after a morning coffee can be a hassle. Attention to detail, like the measurement markings on the 12-ounce water tank, ensures that brewing remains both straightforward and precise.  

**Effortless Brewing Experience**  
As someone who's always fiddling with kettles and timers during my morning routine, the auto-drip tank included with this coffee maker felt like a game changer. Its controlled water flow and precise hole pattern ensured even saturation of the coffee grounds, delivering a balanced cup. The brewing process couldn't have been simpler; I loaded my coffee grounds, poured hot water into the tank up to my desired measurement, and let the coffee maker work its magic. Even on groggy mornings, this device took the guesswork out of the process without compromising flavor.  

[Check OXO 11180100 Brew Single Serve Pour-Over Coffee Maker price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b01enk41q6/)  

**Flavor Profile**  
What truly impressed me was the consistently rich and flavorful coffee it produced. The pour-over method has a reputation for bringing out nuanced flavors, and this coffee maker delivers on that front. From light floral notes in Ethiopian beans to the robust cocoa flavors of darker roasts, each cup felt like a carefully brewed masterpiece. In a blind side-by-side test, it held its own against pricier pour-over setups, which surprised both me and my discerning coffee-loving friend.  

**Benefits**  
- The inclusion of 10 unbleached all-natural cone coffee filters was a pleasant surprise.  
- Dishwasher-safe components simplify cleanup significantly.  
- Compact size makes it a travel-friendly option.  
- Auto-drip tank perfectly controls water distribution for even brewing.  

**Critiques**  
While there’s much to love, a few areas fell short of perfection:  
- The manual operation means you need a separate method to heat water, which could be inconvenient.  
- Filters, though provided initially, are a size-specific necessity that might not be available in every store.  
- Its plastic body may not satisfy users seeking a premium-feel product.

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this product to other single-serve pour-over makers like the Melitta Ready Set and the Kalita Wave, I found it surpasses the Melitta in ease of use. The OXO’s auto-drip system simplifies the brewing experience significantly compared to the manual approach required with the Melitta. Kalita Wave fans might point to its stainless steel build as an advantage, whereas the OXO comes out ahead thanks to its heat-retaining lid that also doubles as a drip tray. It’s a solid contender for those who value both quality coffee and user-friendly design.

**Smart Spending Decision**  
Is this coffee maker worth the investment? For the features provided—control over coffee quality, convenience of use, and compact form—it offers incredible value for money compared to pricier alternatives on the market. Although it’s not the cheapest on the market, its performance rivals some of the higher-end alternatives, making this a smart middle-ground choice for anyone willing to invest a little extra for ease and quality.

I have a little Airbnb with a kitchenette about to go live.
It doesn’t have a stove and just has a mini fridge and microwave.  There is a sink. 
Small space, only sleeps up to two.  No dishwasher.  No hot plate.
Living room, kitchenette space, full bathroom and bedroom.  Outdoor sitting area.  

Eta: I have a coffee maker, electric kettle and toaster as well.

All that being said, besides plates, cups, mugs, silverware, what necessities should I stock?

I have a wine bottle opener, can opener, some knives and silicone spatula/spoons.

What do you recommend?

Also, is kitchenette the right word for a kitchen without a stove?

1malvk6,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerStationHub/comments/1malvk6/does_the_sony_wh1000xm4_redefine_premium_noise/,Does the Sony WH-1000XM4 Redefine Premium Noise Cancelling Headphones?,"Sony WH1000XM4/SMUC headphones have been my daily companion for the last month, and I have plenty of thoughts to share about them. These over-ear, wireless headphones are loaded with features like active noise cancellation, touch controls, 30 hours of battery life, and seamless integration with Alexa and Google Assistant. Being someone who spends a lot of time on calls, traveling, or simply trying to escape city buzz with some peace-inducing tunes, the product seemed like it was built for users like me. After a couple of weeks of use, I can confidently say these headphones are on another level, but they're not flawless.

**Comfort and Build Quality**  
One of the first things I noticed when I unboxed these headphones was their lightweight feel. At just 9 ounces, they don’t weigh down on your head like some other premium headphones. The faux leather ear cups are plush and don’t press too hard against the sides of my head. During a five-hour flight, I barely felt the need to take them off, which speaks volumes about the comfort design. On the downside, the plastic used doesn’t feel as premium as I was hoping for the price tag. It hasn't shown any wear and tear, but it lacks the luxury vibe some rivals manage to deliver.

**Noise Cancellation Performance**  
The active noise cancellation is, hands down, the standout feature of these headphones. Even in noisy environments like the subway or the airport, the outside world melts away almost entirely. With the HD Noise Cancelling Processor QN1 at work, it's like entering a private sanctuary. It doesn't completely block out high-pitched sounds, like a crying baby, but it's good enough to let you focus. What’s more, it adapts to your surroundings using Sony’s Adaptive Sound Control technology. It automatically adjusts the level of noise cancellation based on ambient noise levels—a feature I found surprisingly practical. 

[Check Sony WH1000XM4/SMUC price on Amazon.](https://cavenyc.com/p/b0cfslnt3l/)

**Audio Quality**  
If you're an audiophile like me, this product doesn’t disappoint. The WH1000XM4 headphones deliver rich, detailed sound across all frequencies. They support high-resolution audio, and the DSEE Extreme technology works wonders for upscaling compressed files. I tested various genres—pop, rock, hip-hop, and even podcasts—and everything sounded balanced. The bass is deep but not overpowering, and the mids and highs are crisp. However, one thing to take into account is that these headphones won't satisfy someone searching for overly punchy bass. The sound profile leans more toward precision than sheer force.

**Battery Life and Charging**  
Battery life is exceptional. I used these daily for over a week of commuting and occasional calls, and I only needed to charge them once. The 30-hour battery life feels accurate, and I love that a quick 10-minute charge gives you an additional five hours of playtime. I have to say, it’s annoying that Sony stuck with their proprietary USB Type-C cable—it’s just another cable I need to carry around.

**Features and Usability Perks**  
The speak-to-chat feature is one of those things I didn’t think I needed but now can’t live without. The headphones pause the playback automatically when they detect that I’m speaking, which has been super handy during coffee runs. Likewise, the wearing detection feature powers off the headphones when I take them off—great for saving battery life. Pairing with multiple devices was seamless, thanks to multipoint Bluetooth support. I’ve transitioned between my phone and laptop without even thinking about it. But, if you’re juggling more than two devices, you’re out of luck, as it maxes out at two connections.

**Drawbacks**  
- The touch controls feel unreliable at times, especially when I’m wearing gloves during colder days.  
- Plastic construction doesn’t scream premium-quality build.  
- Noise cancellation, while fantastic, could struggle slightly with sharp or sudden high-pitched sounds.  

**Comparison to Industry Competitors**  
The first competitors that come to mind are the Bose QuietComfort 45 and Apple AirPods Max. Bose headphones are neck-and-neck in terms of noise cancellation, though they feel slightly more durable and lightweight. However, Sony pulls ahead in terms of sound quality and features like speak-to-chat and wearing detection. As for Apple, the AirPods Max shine with their jaw-dropping premium build and flawless integration with the Apple ecosystem. Still, they’re bulkier and significantly more expensive, leaving the Sony product as the more reasonably priced option with wider device compatibility.

**Affordable Quality**  
Considering the competition, I genuinely believe these headphones strike an excellent balance between quality and cost. They're priced competitively for a product with such rich features and superior sound quality. If you're someone who values high battery life, adaptive noise cancellation, and top-notch audio performance without breaking the bank, this product is a solid choice. Sure, it doesn’t offer the absolute best when it comes to materials, but the sound and features wholly justify the investment.

We used to live in Arlington back in our early 20s, moved to Philly and loved it, but job stuff is taking us back to the region. I always knew this area was more expensive and we’ve accepted that we’ll pay at least $1000 more a month in rent compared to Philly. But wow it’s even more expensive than I thought. And the second I find something that might work, I see negative reviews that are deal breakers, ie thin walls, barking dogs, cigarette/weed smells wafting through vents. 

We expanded our search to Dunn Loring because Arlington is wildly inflated. I work from home and need a private office space (unfortunately coworking spaces don’t work bc I’m in healthcare) so we need a two bedroom, ideally under $3300.

It was 2 weeks after this when her interest suddenly dropped, and she didn’t even want to remain friends.

From engaging dates and being enthusiastic, spending time with each other’s families everyday, her parents even knew i was into her, to replying 2-3 days late in a matter of weeks. And then a soft rejection when i asked her out again.

I asked her “when are we going for a coffee” and she replied 3 days later “sorry i was busy with a wedding, idk we will arrange it though”. I took the rejection gracefully and told her to hit me up if she ever wants to, which she never did.


I feel like it’s all my fault, multiple times i had sent her mixed signals, that must have been exhausting.

33 y/o guy with a cute smile (have been told so) with a career in tech ( but not a tech bro ), a calm presence with a life that has been a wild adventure of extremes, I thrive on intellectual chaos. I like to read, anything everything from systems theory to modern french history, particularly energy and clean (it’s one of my passion). After taking a break from dating, I am giving it a one more shot

**What I’m Looking For:**

A **childfree, progressive partner** who sees life as a playground of possibilities, not a checklist. Someone unapologetically herself—sexually liberated, intellectually fearless, and allergic to societal scripts. Let’s skip the small talk and dissect the big questions: How do we live ethically in a burning world? Can love exist without ownership?

**Why We Might Click:**

* **Staunchly Childfree :** I don’t want kids (ever), both for personal freedom and because bringing new life into an overburdened world feels tragically naive. Let’s channel that energy into activism, art, or adventure instead.
* **You crave depth :** My attachment style is securely rooted. I’m here for mutual growth, not games. Whether we’re debating moral gray zones or testing new boundaries in the bedroom, I value curiosity over judgment.
* **You’re a shapeshifter :** Artist, scientist, activist, hedonist.... you refuse to be boxed in. Bonus if you’ve got stories from living unconventionally or a passion project that keeps you up at night.
* **You laugh easily :** My humor leans dry, my vibe is warm, and I’ll absolutely lean into the absurdity of dating via Reddit posts

\*\*The Vibe:\*\*Imagine slow mornings with coffee and *Sapiens* debates, weekends volunteering at climate marches or getting lost in a neon-lit bar abroad. I’m driven but not ruthless, my version of “Machiavellian” is designing a life that’s sustainable, joyful, and defiantly *ours*.

1malmxs,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1malmxs/one_year_trying_not_to_drink_coffee/,One year trying not to drink coffee,"I stopped drinking coffee a year ago. I was sick of the jitteriness, anxiety and constantly searching for where my next cup could come from. I drank my coffee black, no sugar nor milk and two 300ml mugs a day. I've been working in offices the past 30 years, surrounded by coffee drinkers. I never blamed my mood, anxiety or sleep disturbances on coffee. It was only 2 cups and I was used to it, I kept telling myself.

Now drinking no coffee has become so normal, that I sometimes forget why I've stopped in the first place. Dangerous, because I still like the smell, there are social situations where it would just be easier to join in with the coffee drinking and how bad can it really be?

I keep a short note on my computer that I labeled ""Reasons not to drink coffee"" which I still need to look at once in a while:

* Easier to talk to people
* Easier to fall asleep and better, deeper sleep
* Feel better, even if accidentally having a bad night, still have energy
* Better bowel movements, less toilet visits
* Less irritable, much less anxiety, calmer!
* Not giving a f\_\_k

I guess that's pretty self-explanatory.

I do have bad nights once in a while and I noticed that my brain still associates coffee with ""medicine to feel less sleepy"". So I'm most tempted to have a cup of coffee when I'm sleepy or have really stressful days. Those are the days I still reach for a decaf coffee, which I always regret by the next day. By now I'm so sensitized to caffeine that even decaf makes me feel jittery and the next night is notably worse. So again, I try to stay away from it until my next weak moment. So far, I never fell back to a regular cup of coffee and the decaf days have been maybe 2-3 per month. I need a warm drink when I wake up, so I'm drinking herbal teas (rooibos, peppermint).

The other thing I'm sometimes dealing with is regret that I didn't stop drinking this stuff earlier in my life. I think I could have had an easier time dealing with certain situations, if I would not have been ""jacked up"" on caffeine. Also, I've literally been to doctors several times for symptoms which I would blame caffeine on nowadays. And I had a short fuse with people I care about.

The only issue I have without coffee is sometimes feeling too calm, distanced and prone to putting things off. But maybe that's just my introvert personality. I do miss the ""push"" you get from coffee to do ""something"", whatever it is. But I guess that's where the caffeine-stress comes from, it doesn't let you sit down and relax.",11,1753621064.0,decaf,9,1.0,False

The deck is mostly focused around cloning deadpool or bringing him back from the graveyard while exploiting on death triggers/ETB triggers via the tokens of himself, its kinda a pseudo control style deck that burns health bars over time via deadpool's textbox and pings from stuff like Tremors, Razorkin, Orcish bowmasters.

There currently aren't really any big ""I win the game"" combos in the deck, mostly just little synergies throughout the deck that all help contribute a little bit to trying to win.

It's pretty weak to counterspells, green decks in general, graveyard hate and aggro decks. A lot of my friends like to play blue/white/green so the Deadpool deck doesn't really ever win many games lmao, but I'm usually more focused on trying to do fun little things to piss them off a little bit rather than actually win the game, shockingly the deck does usually have a solid chance at coming in at 2nd place because it usually looks extremely low threat in terms of the board state and I rarely actually swing into people with my creatures, that ends up taking them by surprise a lot though when suddenly all that chip damage starts adding up and they get donked by someone else at the table.

I do want to improve this deck as much as I can though, because its my favorite deck to play and I just love the playstyle even if its not always conducive to winning the game.

Family of four plus hound dog drove 600+ miles from Northern Virginia to Kalamazoo, MI in the Equinox EV. We used the Google Maps installed in the car after ABRP failed to load . 

I had been somewhat apprehensive about how many stops we’d have to make. how long it would take to charge the car at each stop and whether there’d be enough working chargers at each stop. None of those worries mattered - it was a trouble-free trip, knock on wood. The ride was smooth and our teenagers said they liked that the EqEV had more leg room than our old Honda CRV. We kept the AC to about 75 degrees and mainly drove around 75mph.

Google routed us to make four stops along the way, up from the two planned stops we would make with our ICE CRV: 

1. A Sheetz with eight EA 350kwh DC ""hyperchargers""  at Breezewood, Penn., just after getting on the Pennsylvania Turnpike. (20 minutes) 
2. Turnpike service plaza at Mahoning Valley, Ohio. (34 minutes)
3. Turnpike service plaza at Genoa, Ohio. (22 minutes)
4. Turnpike service plaza at West Unity, Ohio. (16 minutes). 

We have a NACS convertor and used it at the three Tesla supercharger banks at the latter three stops. In all, we paid \~$67 in charging to get to K’zoo.

The Sheetz EA had maybe 8 hyperchargers. When we arrived there was only a Ford Lightning charging, but within a few minutes of us starting to charge the place literally filled up with vehicles. It took us only about the time to use the restroom, get the dog to a tree and buy a coffee to charge up to the level we needed to get to, so it worked out. All of the chargers we hooked up to worked fine. 

Same thing happened at the second stop. When we arrived, we were the second car at the Tesla charging bank. By the time we left, the stalls were nearly all full.

The latter two turnpike plazas both had a bank of eight Tesla superchargers and four EA hyperchargers, which was nice. At each stop, by the time everyone had hit the toilet and buy a coffee or snacks we had to wait another five minutes or so for the charge to reach the target point. The one time we had to do a longer charge (nearly 30 minutes) was the stop where we had lunch, so even that worked out. Overall, using the EV added an extra hour to our travel time. 

One thing I’ll observe: The destination SOC estimates Google Maps spit out were very conservative, consistently \~10 percentage points below what the SOC would actually be upon arrival. Google told me the SOC would be 13% when we arrived at Mahoning Valley. It turned out to be 22%. 

When we make the return trip, I might try to make only three charging stops. We could have easily avoided the final stop if we would have charged up an extra \~15 percentage points at Genoa. Google's SOC estimate at West Unity said we'd arrive at our destination with 8% charge, but it ended up being 18%.

Anyway, it was a successful experiment for us. Kids loved the ride, having the maps show us where/when to charge was convenient and the turnpike chargers were all working smoothly. AMA.",7,1753620866.0,EquinoxEv,3,1.0,False

If you're planning a visit, I've put together the perfect itinerary based on what worked really well for me.

First things first - I highly recommend starting your day with the Hop-On Hop-Off bus tour. It's seriously the best way to get oriented and see all the major spots efficiently. After researching different options, I booked through [this link](https://athometouch.com/toronto) and got a great deal. The buses run every 30 minutes, so you can explore at your own pace without feeling rushed.

I started at Yonge-Dundas Square (now called Sankofa Square), which is basically Toronto's Times Square. The energy here is incredible, especially in the morning when everything's coming to life. From there, I hopped off at the Royal Ontario Museum - even if you're not big on museums, the architecture alone is worth seeing.

Casa Loma was my next stop and honestly, it blew me away. This Gothic Revival castle in the middle of Toronto feels like something out of a fairy tale. The gardens are stunning and the city views from the towers are unbeatable.

For lunch, I got off at St. Lawrence Market. The food selection here is insane - try the peameal bacon sandwich, it's a Toronto classic. The market's been around since 1803 and the building itself is pretty historic.

After lunch, I headed to the CN Tower area. Pro tip: if you're doing the tower, go right after lunch when the crowds are usually smaller. The views are absolutely mind-blowing, especially on a clear day.

I spent the late afternoon exploring the Distillery District. The Victorian architecture here is gorgeous, and there are tons of unique shops and cafes. Perfect spot to grab a coffee and just wander around.

One thing I really appreciated about the bus tour was the flexibility. When my feet got tired (and they will), I could just hop back on and rest while still sightseeing. The guides are super knowledgeable and share lots of interesting facts about the city.

Time management is key for a day trip. The full bus loop takes about 2 hours if you don't get off, but I'd recommend planning for 6-8 hours total to actually explore the stops that interest you.

If you're planning to do this tour (which I really recommend), book it through [this link](https://athometouch.com/toronto). They've got good prices and flexible cancellation policies. Plus, you can choose between 24 or 48-hour passes if you end up wanting to explore more.

Don't try to see everything - Toronto's huge and you'll enjoy it more if you pick your must-sees and take your time. The bus tour lets you cover a lot of ground while still having the freedom to dig deeper into the spots that really interest you.

I ended my day in the Entertainment District, which is perfect for dinner and maybe catching a show if you're not too tired. The whole experience gave me a great feel for the city, and I'm already planning my next visit to explore more.

Remember to wear comfortable shoes and bring a water bottle. Also, check the weather - those open-top buses are amazing on nice days, but they've got covered options if it rains.

The city has so much personality and history - it's definitely worth taking the time to explore properly. If you're considering a Toronto day trip, just go for it. You won't regret it.",1,1753620737.0,AskAVoyager,0,1.0,False

My business partner and I got an offer from Compass. I produce about $8-10M per year, my partner does about $17M-20M and we run our brokerage like a law firm. We run our books of business independently and collaborate here and there when tackling builder accounts. We only kick up to the brokerage on expenses, I don’t pay him anything. It’s an awesome dynamic. We also just started a construction company building luxury homes.

The Compass offer is essentially the same splits as where we currently are with Side Real Estate, so the financials are a comfortable lateral move for us since we have great splits already. The biggest difference I am seeing is that we will be paying $50 more per month for the platform fee and we gain access to any Compass office we want to use (we currently office at home or coffee shops)

We don’t care about most of the tech packages since we do things our way anyway.

I just want to know if any of you experienced agents have any opinion or experience with Compass. Is it good? Does it suck? Both of us have higher price point clientele, so it seems like a decent move. Thoughts?",0,1753620707.0,realtors,6,0.4,False

He’s always there for me & I feel safe with him. He goes out of his way to do things, brings me to work, makes me coffee, brings me to shops to get personal items. 

I am hesitant to say hey, I like you why don’t we try again but I feel like he might just not want the commitment. I feel if he really wanted me he could say it but this man has trouble expressing himself.

1malf4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_jungiannotjung/comments/1malf4x/the_sacred_works_of_heartbreak/,The Sacred Works of Heartbreak,"When the relationship that had defined my twenties ended on a Tuesday morning in March, I thought I was dying. Not metaphorically—literally. My chest felt cracked open, my breath came in shallow gasps, and I couldn't understand how my heart could break this completely and still keep beating. I sat on my kitchen floor, surrounded by the remnants of a shared life—his coffee mug still in the sink, our photo still on the refrigerator—and felt like I was drowning in my own home.



The well-meaning advice came quickly: ***""You're young, you'll find someone better."" ""At least you weren't married.""*** ***""He wasn't right for you anyway.""*** ***""Just focus on yourself now.""*** Each phrase felt like a small violence, dismissing the depth of what I was experiencing, reducing three years of profound love and intimacy to something that could be solved with a haircut and a dating app.



But this wasn't depression, though it felt darker than any sadness I'd known. This wasn't a problem to be fixed, though everyone seemed to have solutions. This was grief—raw, wild, sacred grief for love that had been real and was now lost. It was sorrow for the future we'd planned, the inside jokes no one else would understand, the particular way he said my name in the morning. It was mourning for the version of myself that had existed in his eyes, for the dreams we'd woven together, for the everyday magic of being deeply known by another soul.



And yet, when I looked for guidance on how to tend this grief, I found mostly advice on how to eliminate it.



We live in a culture that has forgotten how to grieve well, and nowhere is this more apparent than in how we handle the end of romantic relationships. While other losses—death, job loss, illness—receive some measure of social recognition and support, relationship grief often gets dismissed as self-indulgent drama or, worse, personal failure. We're expected to ***""bounce back,****""* to see it as a ***""blessing in disguise,""*** to transform heartbreak into empowerment as quickly as possible.



But what if this expectation is not only unrealistic but spiritually violent? What if the sorrow that follows the end of deep love is not pathology but pilgrimage? What if heartbreak is not something to recover from but something to apprentice with?



Psychotherapist Francis Weller teaches that grief is not a problem to be solved but *""a presence awaiting witnessing.""* He speaks of grief as sacred work, as medicine for both the individual soul and the world's soul. His words found me in my kitchen-floor moments and offered something revolutionary: permission to treat my heartbreak not as weakness but as initiation.



[**This book**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FJYKDK46) is born from that permission and the years of learning that followed. It's written for those who find themselves in the underworld of relationship loss, wondering if they'll ever feel whole again. It's for anyone who has been told they're ***""taking too long""*** to heal, who has felt shame for the depth of their sorrow, who has needed someone to say: your grief is sacred, your heartbreak is holy, and the work of mourning love is among the most courageous acts a human being can undertake.

Teh Wrought iron​ patio table is a ​quintessential piece of outdoor furniture, known for its durability, timeless aesthetic, and ability to withstand the elements. As ⁣we look toward 2025, the market offers a plethora of options, each vying for the title of ""best."" Selecting the right wrought‍ iron patio table involves careful consideration of factors ‍such as construction quality, design, size, and overall value. This review aims⁣ to provide a comprehensive analysis of the top ​contenders, helping you make an‌ informed decision for your outdoor space.

The enduring appeal ⁤of wrought iron lies in its strength and the intricate designs that can be achieved. beyond mere functionality, a wrought iron patio table‍ becomes a focal point in⁤ any ​garden, patio, or⁣ balcony, adding a touch of elegance and sophistication.‍ This review will delve into the specific features, benefits, and drawbacks​ of leading models, ensuring you find the perfect blend of durability and style to complement your outdoor living experience.

## Key Features Analysis

The best wrought iron patio tables stand out due to their robust construction, thoughtful design, and resistance to weathering. Key features contribute significantly to their longevity and overall value.

**Frame Material and Construction:** The frame of a wrought iron patio table is the foundation of its durability.Look‌ for ‌tables constructed from heavy-gauge steel or ⁢genuine wrought iron with welded joints for maximum​ strength. Some manufacturers use ‌powder-coated finishes for added protection against rust and corrosion.

A Heavier gauge of metal typically indicates ⁤higher quality and greater resistance to bending or breaking under stress. Welded joints are preferable to bolted connections, as they provide a more seamless and structurally sound connection‌ point. Powder coating is an ⁢vital feature that ⁢adds ⁢a layer of protection‍ against the ⁣elements,‌ extending the lifespan of the table.

**Tabletop Material and Design:** The tabletop material can vary ‍significantly,⁣ ranging from tempered glass to slatted​ wrought iron and stone. Tempered glass is a⁤ popular choice for its sleek appearance and ease of cleaning, while slatted wrought iron allows for water drainage and provides a more traditional aesthetic. Stone tabletops, such as granite or marble, offer unmatched elegance and durability.Tempered glass is designed to shatter into small, relatively harmless pieces if broken, making it a safer option ​than regular glass. Slatted wrought iron designs are excellent for preventing water from pooling on the tabletop, avoiding water damage and maintaining a cleaner ⁣surface. Stone tabletops are the heaviest and most durable, but⁣ they also⁢ require more care and can‌ be more expensive.

**Size ‍and ⁣Shape:** ⁣ wrought iron patio tables are available in various sizes and shapes, ranging from⁢ small ‌bistro tables for intimate settings to large rectangular tables for accommodating larger groups. Consider the dimensions of your outdoor space and the number of​ people you typically entertain ⁣when selecting the appropriate size. Shape also plays a role, with round tables often ​fostering more casual conversation and rectangular tables‌ providing more ⁤surface area for dining.

Careful⁣ measurement of your available space is essential to ensure the table fits comfortably without overcrowding the area.⁢ For small balconies or patios, a bistro table​ or small round⁢ table might potentially be the most suitable option. ⁣For larger gatherings, a rectangular table ⁢or a large round table with ample seating can be ⁢more appropriate.

**Weight Capacity:** ⁣The weight capacity of a wrought iron ⁤patio table is an important consideration,​ especially if you plan on placing heavy items on the tabletop, such as ⁢large serving dishes or decorative accessories. Ensure the table is ‌rated to support⁣ the intended weight to‍ prevent bending or structural damage over time.

A Higher weight⁣ capacity generally indicates a stronger and more durable table. Always check the manufacturer's specifications to ensure⁤ the table can safely support the weight of the items you⁤ plan to place on it.Exceeding the weight capacity can lead to structural problems and possibly perilous situations.

**Finish and ⁢Weather Resistance:** The⁤ finish of a wrought iron patio table is crucial for its longevity and resistance to weathering. Powder-coated finishes are highly recommended for their durability and resistance to rust,corrosion,and fading. Some manufacturers also⁢ offer UV-resistant coatings to protect against​ sun damage.

A⁣ Powder-coated finish provides a durable and‍ long-lasting⁤ barrier against the elements, preventing rust and corrosion from forming on the metal surface. UV-resistant coatings prevent the finish from fading or becoming brittle when exposed to sunlight,preserving the table's appearance over time. Look for⁤ tables specifically designed for outdoor use with ‌weather-resistant features.

## Core Benefits

wrought iron patio tables deliver several core benefits that make them a desirable addition to ‍any outdoor space. These benefits include durability, aesthetic appeal, and ease of ‍maintenance.

**Extraordinary Durability:** Wrought iron's inherent strength makes these tables exceptionally durable, capable of⁢ withstanding harsh weather conditions and heavy use. Unlike plastic ⁣or wood furniture, wrought⁣ iron resists cracking, warping, and fading, ensuring years of reliable service.

They can withstand heavy wind or rain. The solid construction ensures they are less likely to be damaged. This translates to long-term cost savings, as you won't need ⁣to replace‌ them ​as frequently as other types of patio ⁢furniture.

**timeless Aesthetic Appeal:** Wrought iron's classic design adds ‌a touch of elegance‍ and sophistication to any⁢ outdoor setting. The intricate details and flowing lines of wrought iron furniture create a charming and inviting atmosphere,enhancing the ⁤overall beauty of ‍your patio or garden.

It blends seamlessly with various architectural styles, from traditional to contemporary. The visual‌ appeal makes it a centerpiece of your outdoor decor. This enhances the ambiance⁤ of ‌your outdoor living space.**Low maintenance Requirements:** Wrought iron patio tables require minimal maintenance to keep them looking their‌ best. A simple wipe-down with a damp cloth is typically ⁢sufficient⁣ to remove dirt and debris.Periodic request of a rust-inhibiting coating can further extend their lifespan.They don't require staining, sealing, or painting like wood furniture. The low maintenance frees ‌up your time. This allows you to enjoy your outdoor space without worrying.

**Stability and‌ Wind Resistance:** The weight of​ wrought iron provides excellent stability,preventing the table​ from tipping‌ over ​in‌ windy conditions. This is particularly beneficial for those ‌who live ‍in areas prone to strong winds or storms.The ⁤heavy weight ⁣keeps the table securely in place, even in gusts of wind. They provide a safe and ‍stable surface for dining and ⁣entertaining. This offers peace of mind in windy weather.

**Enhanced Safety:** The sturdy construction and weight of wrought iron patio tables make them less susceptible to theft or vandalism.This⁣ can provide added security for your outdoor furniture, especially in areas with high foot traffic.

The difficulty‌ of moving it deters potential theft. It provides security, knowing your outdoor furniture is safe.

## FAQs Section

**How often⁣ should I clean my wrought iron ⁤patio ‌table?**
Regular cleaning, ideally once a month or as⁣ needed, is recommended to ⁣remove‌ dirt, dust, and debris.​ For areas with heavy pollen or debris, cleaning more frequently may be required.

**can I‌ leave my wrought ‍iron patio table outdoors year-round?**

""If you continuously belittle, guilt, and dismiss an entire group based on their immutable characteristics, don’t be surprised when they walk away and don’t return.""

I won't pretend that belief in God is numbered among ""immutable characteristics"", but I know for a fact that many God believing people, including very liberal Christians, have been belittled, ""guilted"", dismissed, and worse. . . by many intolerant atheist Unitarian Universalists. I speak from direct personal experience and over three decades worth of observation. Many other people have been made to feel FAR from welcome in Unitarian Universalist ""Welcoming Congregations"" for this, that, or the other reason. I have long said that Unitarian Universalists need to ask themselves the following question:

Why is it that less than 200,000 adult North Americans choose to join Unitarian Universalist ""Welcoming Congregations""?

But these days, it's more like less that 150,000 adults. . .

In 2008, in his ""stump speech"" announcing his candidacy for UUA President, Rev. Peter Morales proclaimed that Unitarian Universalism is not called to be ""a tiny, declining, fringe religion"", but that's exactly what UUism was in 2008, and UUism is a tinier, still declining, fringe religion in 2025. . .

But I have a unique spin on this questions based on some life experiences. I want to highlight 2 experiences in my life that has made me very confused/jaded that men and women can be friends. Before I start, I am not blaming nor acting like it is impossible for men and women to be friends. In my stories, I will take responsible for my parts and I understand that this isnt all women. Kinda want some women to tell me how their opposite sex friendships have been because I am so confused why this happen to me.

Story 1:

I knew a girl in my college classes. She was nice but she had some mental issues due to stress of the course work. I decided to be a friend just to get to know her. She was nice and I also was taking the same class. Well overtime, she started to share very serious things about her mental health. It became so great that she needed counseling. I couldnt handle it at all because it worried me. So i encourage her to get a therapist. After getting the proper help, she randomly blocked me and we stop talking.

Story 3

I met a girl in med school and she seem nice. She was known as a flirt and she was extremely pretty. I knew eventually I would fall for her due to her great personality. She started off as classmates and I hope we could be more. She wasnt into it at all. That was fine as I knew it was a me issue. However, instead of acting like a normal friend, she would just take advantage of me. She would tried to get me to take her home alot and constantly tease me. Also she wouldnt stop flirting with me. Our dynamics was like a younger brother and older sister where she would just constantly make me uncomfortable. I was ok with it until I saw that she wasnt treating all the other guys like that in the class. It hurt me because i was not really a friend more like a punching bag. So i ended it and she still sends me funny memes. If i reply she will just ghost. I decided to block her because I believe that it is a game to her. Our of my relationships this one hurt the most because I really was open and honest about my intentions. I told that I am ok with friendship and she just laugh about it. 

I just dont get it. I hear stories of guys just being really good friends with girls. The idea of just getting coffee with a girl seems like a fantasy. I skipped some stories with other women but they seem very averse from doing things like that unless they have a crush. Even getting them to text back is hard. And I am very confused by the dudes who are friends to try to get the girl to like them. How did they make it so far in the relationship and why are the women still being their friends despite knowing that they want more. I never been this type of guy who tried to be a creepy nice guy.

I have once again found myself stuck with my parents. 

I moved back to England from overseas and wanted to study for a PGCE (teaching degree), so it made sense. But now I’ve completed it and I haven’t been able to secure a job for September: this is mainly from my anxiety of going to interviews, so I only went to 2 and in those 2 I felt like my autism really held me back. 

So I am not yet able to move out and will do supply work come September. 

My mother does not understand me at all. 

She came into my room today to invite me out, which in itself is great! I love hanging out with them (although would prefer more advance notice). 

But she said it in such a condescending way, like talking to a baby. Honestly, the words aren’t bad but if you heard it you would also be irritated.

“You’re always in the house, why don’t you come out with us” 

1. I struggle with last minute invites 
2. I have been on summer break for exactly ONE week. Last week, I was out of the house from 7am until 6pm everyday, Mon to Fri and completing essays and paperwork evenings and weekends. It was the worst year of my life. I am burnt out from teaching full time and submitting intense amounts of paperwork and assignments. I am burnt out, which I have communicated. I am recuperating. 
3. I did in fact leave the house this week. I went out to dinner on the Monday and went swimming Wednesday and Friday for a few hours (as part of my regular routine). I have also been doing some chores at home that I had been neglecting due to my previous stressful job/study.
4. I have always been a homebody and we often joke about that. “I knew you wouldn’t spend the night at your cousins, you’re a homebody!” 
I like swimming and video games. Those are my hobbies. I have been socializing through my video games. 

I know it doesn’t sound like much but my mum has often commented on how little I go out to socialize with friends and how often I do activities alone. This is my preference. I do have friends but none of them share my interests, so it’s more comfortable to do many of my interests alone. My mum is very sociable, has a million friends and is always out for coffee/lunch/dinner/shows. She looks down on how I do things and she feels sorry for me. I don’t want her to!!! 

I can’t wait to move back out so I can receive less judgement on my social calendar. If I haven’t secured a permanent job through supply by Christmas, I will return to my old job overseas.

Chapter 1

Fear started it. Fear laced with arrogance. The first signs were easy to overlook. There was a cough in a Swiss classroom, a rash that refused to fade. Within a week fourteen children lay in hospital beds, half of them in comas, three already gone by the time the story reached New York.

The virus was an old enemy, wearing a new face. Most people had never heard of anyone getting the measles. It sounded old-fashioned and almost quaint. The new variant was horribly worse.

They called it ELM: Encephalitis Likely Measles. The name sounded almost gentle. It wasn’t.

Traditional measles was extremely contagious and carried a 1-in-1,000 chance of encephalitis. ELM was just as contagious as the old strain but it increased the odds to 1 in 2. In half the people who contracted ELM, it would progress into encephalitis. And of those with encephalitis, only 1 in 10 survived. Most succumbed within hours of brain swelling due to seizures, coma, death. A few survived.

But because this variation was so unfamiliar, recovery didn’t always look like recovery. Some patients who survived the initial illness began to show strange symptoms weeks or months later. There were neurological effects that didn’t match any known post-viral profile. Doctors started to suspect ELM might not fully leave the body. Maybe it went dormant. Maybe it flared under stress. Maybe it rewrote something deeper.

Some survivors lost speech or motor control, and some lost memory. One girl forgot how to walk but remembered every line of her favorite book, while another boy woke from coma and screamed whenever anyone touched him. He didn’t know why.

At first, the government mouthpieces tried to rationalize it.  They said it was a fluke, a European problem. They said that it would burn out before it reached them. But it didn’t.

It flew business class, it passed through airports, clung to armrests, caught rides on wedding gowns and hymnals and fast-food bags.

At first, the official denial of the seriousness of ELM clouded the truth, but by the time major cities understood the risk, it was already too late. One in three. That’s what they said, eventually, that if ELM wasn’t stopped, one in three would die.

People remembered how to panic.

They lined up for vaccines that offered 40% protection, if that. Pharmacists were bribed and threatened, rumors spread of “pure air” bunkers in the Rockies, and grocery stores ran out of canned goods and soap in a day.

Schools closed. Churches livestreamed. Someone fired a gun at a FedEx driver for knocking on the wrong door. Public transit emptied. Gas prices doubled, then halved, then gas stations went unattended.

You couldn’t find Tylenol or thermometers or sympathy.

Hospitals filled. Then they stopped letting people in and hung hand-lettered signs on locked doors that said, ""No Beds. No Staff. Go Home.""

People died quickly, and badly. A family of five was found slumped at their kitchen table, the toddler still wearing a party hat. The mother’s head was bowed in a posture that looked like prayer, her hand resting near an untouched birthday cake.

A middle school orchestra was performing virtually, and during the final note, the conductor stopped conducting. She slid from view while her students watched, confused and alone in their bedrooms.

There were gaps and emptiness where there should have been people doing things. Bus routes stopped, mailboxes overflowed. A dog barked from the same window for three days before someone noticed.

One girl wandered her apartment hallway barefoot saying her parents wouldn’t wake up. She was chewing cold toast and watching cartoons when a neighbor found her.

Everyone knew. This wasn’t like last time. Before, illness had spared the visible world. ELM consumed it.

It didn’t just target the old and it didn’t hide in hospitals. It took the runners, the yoga instructors, the people with meal plans and backup generators.

As people locked themselves indoors, online communities flourished, giving each other tips and tricks for staying safe, making food last, and reporting dead neighbors. There were still TikToks, still YouTube and still headlines. But under it all, a whisper grew louder, what if this doesn’t stop? 

While the public spiraled, biotech firms pivoted. Most scrambled to adapt existing vaccines, but one company, a small outfit in Eastern Virginia in the USA, quietly submitted a fast-tracked clinical trial proposal to the FDA.

The company was called Tygress Biotech.

The therapy they were working on wasn’t a vaccine, it was a replacement.

Tygress had four scientists, each handpicked for brilliance.

Charles Devoste was the undeniable front man. He was the lead microbiologist, original investor, and unapologetic authoritarian. At forty‑three he still wore bespoke suits beneath his lab coat and kept a stock‑ticker flickering beside every genome browser. Hierarchy, he liked to say, was simply biology writ large, and he placed himself decisively at the top.

Meredith Bates, an American physician seasoned by a decade of cholera camps and field hospitals, counter‑balanced him with quiet pragmatism. She restocked the lab fridge after midnight, logged every reagent twice, and could triage a moral dilemma as fast as she could suture a wound.

Wei Li moved through the corridors like cool water. A neurobiologist by training, he listened more than he spoke, mapping conversations the way other scientists mapped genomes. Where Devoste barked orders, Wei asked questions that cut just as deep.

Helena Langston, a physician and statistician, trusted numbers the way sailors trust stars. She color‑coded datasets, quoted CDC guidelines from memory, and believed that if you plotted events with enough care the world would reveal its pattern.

Most days, the lab was dim and humming. Half their staff had gone remote. Phones rang with bad news, and deliveries were delayed. The cafeteria downstairs had closed weeks ago. Bates kept forgetting and opening the fridge expecting food that wasn’t there.

Privately, Bates and Wei had spoken about Devoste’s behavior more than once, often during the long early-morning hours when even the servers took longer to blink.

“How can you stand him?” Bates asked one night, hands wrapped around a mug that hadn’t held hot coffee for hours. Devoste had dismissed Wei’s input in that morning’s briefing, then recycled the idea as his own by lunch.

Wei gave her a slow shrug. “It’s not about standing him. It’s about understanding what drives him.”

“Arrogance,” Bates muttered.

“Fear,” Wei said. “But not just any fear. It's neurological fear. You’ve seen the scans. Authoritarian-leaning brains show consistent structures. Larger amygdalae. A hypersensitive insula.  A thickened anterior cingulate cortex. Their wiring isn’t built for flexibility. They respond to threat, whether real or imagined, by controlling what they can. That’s why he talks the way he does. Why he dismisses anything unfamiliar.”

“So he’s wired to be a jerk.”

“He’s wired to survive through dominance to hide his fear. There’s a difference.”

Bates narrowed her eyes. “That sounds like letting him off the hook for being an ass.”

Wei shook his head gently. “Think of it like baldness. You can wear a wig, or get implants, but the follicles are still dormant underneath. You can train someone like Devoste not to say certain things and be more socially acceptable. But rewiring the root patterns? You’d need a new nervous system.”

Bates tapped her fingers against the cup. “So you can’t rewire a circuit that was built for fear,” she said meditatively.

Wei nodded. “Exactly.”

“Then what’s the point of science,” she said softly, “if not to change what seems unchangeable?”

They sat in silence. A television screen on the wall updated with another cluster of red dots, another flare-up of ELM, another city with more deaths.

“They say it’s just to limit crowding,” Bates said quietly the next morning, setting down her tablet. “But I saw footage of a protest last night. They tear gassed them for chanting and calling for food and government help.”

No one responded.

The Tygress approach was simple to describe, maddening to engineer. First they snipped the fusion‑protein gene from ELM, disabling its lethality while keeping the tell‑tale shape that B‑cells would remember. Into this shell they stitched P. falciparum‑ΔDOR, a malaria strain famous for slipping into years‑long dormancy inside liver cells. It was perfect for periodic, harmless flare‑ups that would keep immune memory fresh. Their final layer was Inbusatia, a spider‑monkey retrovirus whose only virtue was its stealth: it dampened interferon alarms just enough to let the hybrid drift from host to host like a mild head cold.

Stacked together, the trio behaved like a parking lot suddenly filled with neon scooters, small, harmless, and occupying every space the ELM monster‑truck needed to park. The construct earned its name: MIMs: Measles, Inbusatia, Malaria sequence.

In theory, a MIMs carrier would experience what Wei called “micro‑colds”. Those infected with MIMs would have day of sniffles every few months, usually after stress, followed by complete recovery. In return, the body would maintain antibodies and memory T‑cells primed against ELM forever. No room, no entry, no outbreak. It was, as Wei liked to say, like trading a tiger for a kitten. A scrappy little infection that curled up harmlessly in the body while keeping the real predator at bay.

In animal trials, it was near miraculous. In the animal trials there had been no deaths no seizures,  and no comas. It was almost too good to be true.

The team petitioned for human trials. Normally the process for human trials would take years, but with the projections of mass death within months, the government was practically rubber-stamping any project that offered hope, and people were lining up to be test subjects.  While they waited, they rested. They would hear from the CDC in a few days, maybe a week, so the lab shut down for a well-deserved rest before the grueling human trials would begin.

But Devoste didn’t just rest. He rested in the most Devoste way possible.

He took his family to a high-end isolation resort. What had been, before ELM, a five-star, world-class hotel had been transformed into an almost unimaginably expensive haven. Each guest had access to a private spa on thier own private floor as well as a private chef.

“A luxury quarantine,” he bragged. As the lab crew locked up, his gloating was almost insufferable.

One week later, he broke into the Tygress lab and administered the experimental MIMs protocol to himself.

1mal65s,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1mal65s/find_out_if_the_oxo_good_grips_cold_brew_coffee/,Find Out if the OXO Good Grips Cold Brew Coffee Maker is Worth It,"Testing out the OXO 1272880 Cold Brew Coffee Maker felt like stepping into a world where cold brew is no longer a luxury reserved for trendy cafés but something I could produce effortlessly at home. This compact coffee maker combines sleek design with practical functionality, making it a pleasant addition to my kitchen. The promise of brewing smooth, low-acid coffee concentrate overnight was definitely intriguing, and I put it to the test with great excitement. However, as much as I appreciated many of its features, I found a few areas that could be improved to make it even better.

**Ease of Use Made Simple**  
Handling this cold brew device was straightforward. Its manual operation felt intuitive, especially with the Rainmaker feature. The cleverly designed top allowed water to distribute evenly over the coffee grounds—a detail I noticed made a significant difference in delivering a balanced flavor. Steeping the coffee overnight required no babysitting; it legit felt effortless. Once done, I enjoyed flipping the conveniently placed switch that started the filtration process, creating a concentrate that could be stored or mixed for the perfect brew. Even for someone like me, who doesn’t always have the patience for more complicated machines, this one felt refreshingly easy.

**Rainmaker Innovation That Delivers**  
Including the Rainmaker feature was a smart move by OXO. Traditionally, evenly soaking grounds can be hit or miss depending on your water flow. But here, the precision and engineering designed into that tiny piece at the top provided a consistent soak every single time, which was something I truly appreciated. The end result produced a richer flavor with no “weaker” or unbalanced areas when drinking the coffee. It also made me wonder why every coffee maker didn’t have this.  

[Looking for OXO 1272880 discounts? Check Amazon here.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b00jvsvm36/)

**Designed for Minimal Kitchen Hassle**  
The design is both functional and attractive. Measuring in at 9.53 inches wide and tall gives it a compact nature that’s ideal for countertops. Space in my kitchen is always valuable real estate, and this coffee maker didn’t feel like it dominated any area. While it may not pass as a showpiece, it’s got a sleek and modern black color that easily pairs with most kitchen setups. My other favorite discovery was just how easy it was to clean—the whole thing nests together after use, which makes storage ridiculously simple.  

**Boons**  
- The Rainmaker feature guarantees even water distribution for an optimal brew.  
- Comes apart easily for quick cleaning and nesting storage.  
- Reusable mesh filter saves money on buying replacement filters.  
- Stopper includes a silicone seal for longer-lasting freshness when storing concentrate.  
- Compact design fits neatly on small or crowded countertops.  

**Adverse Aspects**  
- If you hate hand washing, the hand-wash-only requirement can feel inconvenient.  
- Some might find assembly slightly fussy on the first attempt.  
- The glass carafe is sturdy but doesn’t feel shatterproof; a careless nudge could cause trouble.  

**Competitive Products**  
When comparing this coffee maker to similar options, like the Takeya Cold Brew Maker, there are some noticeable differences. The Takeya feels lighter and is more portable, but its lack of advanced features, like OXO’s Rainmaker, leaves its brewing process feeling a little less sophisticated. On the other hand, the Hario Mizudashi coffee pot is more affordable, though it doesn’t provide the same level of convenience in cleaning and storage as OXO’s nested design. What sets this product apart most is its perfect balance of function and innovation—it wins in areas like smooth brewing and thoughtful design.  

**Smart Spending**  
While this isn’t the cheapest option on the market, it’s far from overpriced for what it delivers. The build quality is sturdy, the coffee quality is top-notch, and the convenience of use makes it feel like a long-term investment. If you’re someone who loves cold brew and is tired of paying café prices but still values high-quality preparation, this gadget offers excellent cost efficiency. Its durability and reusable parts justify the slightly higher price point compared to plastic-heavy or single-function alternatives.

After much research and questions on this sub, SUPER thanks to the beginners post for coffee, I went ahead and ordered the Blue Tokai Easy Pour mixed package as a litmus test. Sharing my experience and would appreciate responses from the experts here!

I've had black instant coffee couple of times before, this was nothing like that. A little more bitter and a little smoky/nutty (as per what they claim)

I had to add a little bit of sugar and eventually even went on to add a little milk to suit my tastebuds.

Few observations/questions:
1. The first scent of the grounded coffee was good but as I tried to sniff it more, it was kinda burnt/smoky? Is this normal?
2. The packaging says it has a chocolatey taste but I couldn't feel that, are my tastebuds not evolved enough?
3. What is the right way to drink it? I see people only even making iced coffees from this easy pour bag
4. What should be my next step after I complete this mixed bag of coffees?

I’d love to make a cute two-tiered cake for them with carrot on the bottom and coffee on top. I’ve heard that cream cheese frosting can be tricky to use on the outside of a cake, and I think i’d like the exterior frosting on both tiers to match for a cleaner look.

Would it be okay to use cream cheese frosting between the layers of the carrot cake and coffee buttercream between the layers of the coffee and walnut cake, but then cover the entire cake in either vanilla American buttercream or Swiss meringue buttercream?

The bride who wants cream cheese frosting absolutely loves it, so would it be enough to have it just as the inside frosting?

Thanks in advance. 

I have been interested in the X since it came out, but never had one. I have put many many many miles on 7.3s, and 6.0s and done a great deal of maintenance on them for work, never personally. 

I have convinced my wife that we need a full sized truck frame SUV for the way we travel, which is to pile up the kids and all our luggage, water filter coffee pot, etc into the MDX (19mpg, premium only), literally floor to ceiling, and drive 3-700 miles in a stretch and stay for 6-10 days. 

We have always WANTED a camper, and now I travel for work, 2-3 months at a time 2-3 times a year and a secondhand truck and camper would pay for themselves and then we could use them as a family for vacations. So this would be pulling 2-400 milles and then daily driver for for 2-3 months and pulling back. 

I would LIKE to have one vehicle as the family weekend and travel truck for the next 20+ years and the X seems like the most capable and available candidate when pulling such distances is going to be something it does part time. I intend to upgrade the interior and whatever breaks as I go along, but the body, frame, and drive train, the big expenses need to last as long as possible.

Obviously I could get any newer pickup but then I lose the third row seat (which we never use, but my wife sees it as a ""mom status symbol"") and I'd put a camper shell in it for luggage anywya, so I am back to full sized SUV and the X is the newest thing I know of with a solid rear axel, and the beefiest one at that.

I can find acceptable prices, 15-20k on the V10, 6.0, and the 7.3, what varies is the mileage. The V10 with 100k is about the same price as the 6.0 with about 180k and the 7.3 with 230k. For something that's only going to drive one day a week for long stretches diesel seems like an advantage, but maintenance cost, lower mileage on the whole truck, etc really has me focused on the V10, the 7.3 with lower mileage seem to be RIGHT OUT and the 6.0 seems to be the compromise.

People tell me ""if everything is maintained the same (and the 6.0 is bullet proofed) they all last forever."" Which is to say 400k+ before rebuild or replacement. If that is true, it seems like gasser seems like the best buy over all, but you guys tell me, how does the math work out? Am I going to be disgusted pulling a 9klb loaded camper through the mountains with the V10? What's really up?

Walter Sobchak:
Well, sometimes, it's a cathartic -

The Dude:
No, I'm saying, if he knows I'm a f***-up, why does he leave me in charge of getting his wife back? Because he doesn't f***ing want her back!

Maybe this was obvious, but I just realized Walter misunderstands The Dude here because The Dude’s wording makes him defensive about his own verbal outbursts. He’s now thinking about his confrontation with Smokey, with the censoring coffee shop lady, etc as “yelling a lot but not really doing anything,” and his gut reaction is to defend his non-action by touting the cathartic benefits of verbalizing what upsets us.

Heretofore, the only time Walter has an opportunity to go past words is with Little Larry, which he has to do because that little prick stone walls him, denying him the sought-after catharsis that to him should have come with a successful verbal altercation, and which was unsuccessful because of his error in directing the physical manifestation of his anger towards an object instead of the person himself.

This is a mistake which, once Walter learns what he learns by misinterpreting The Dude during the reveal, he doesn’t make again; his next actions are to escalate the verbal confrontation with The Big Lebowski to a physical one and then do the same with the nihilists. The escalation of his behavior and the tragic results are all due to feeling like he’s been perceived as something other than a man of action, that his heroic efforts at non-violent resolution were letting aggression stand, and to rectify the issue he is on the hunt to find a worthy fuckin adversary.

I’m looking for a few people to regularly exchange cards with – ideally, people with shared interests/hobbies/ideas. There’s no set schedule; you can send a card every month, every other month, or as often as you want. Each card can be independent and doesn’t have to be a response or anything. But ideally, it should be an ongoing exchange.

A little bit about me: I love language learning, reading, journaling, gaming, arts and crafts, coffee, etc. I love going on solo dates (cafes, bookstores, libraries, parks, museums, cozy events!). I have more info on my profile. I have a lot of stationery and I enjoy decorating my cards with stickers and washi tape.

Here are a few things you can write about in the cards:

* your latest hobbies, hyperfixations, or favorites (can be a book, anime, game, or your favorite coffee!)
* a recent fun adventure
* something you’re looking forward to
* simple pleasures/joys or simple wins
* a book you just read 
* language learning progress/wins
* recent reflections
* …and so on!

Let’s keep it chill and cozy! I don’t want to talk about anything too heavy, personal, controversial, political, etc. I don’t like talking about work/career as well.

I also speak Spanish, so it would be nice to exchange cards in Spanish!

Please send me a chat if you’re interested – plus a bit about you and why this post resonated with you.

1maksux,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1maksux,"I just did a water cupping - same coffee but brewed with tap water, filtered tap water and Volvic","When I started my coffee journey I used tap water, later switched to Volvic and then bought a Brita filter to save costs.

Lately I was curious to compare the three side by side. I used an affordable Gesha from a local roaster (56€/kg). It's not extraordinary but has some complexity which I thought would be nice to compare the different brewing waters. 

To not be biased I put numbers below the cups and shuffled them.

When cupping them (A, B, C from left to right, shuffled, not knowing which is which) I observed the following:

Unsurprisingly, they all tasted similar, but B had a bit more aroma and more acidity. A and C were harder to distinguish, while I had the feeling that A was a little thinner and mellow with the least acidity. B was slightly more flavorful and had a bit silkier texture than A. 

C being in the middle I assumed it is the filtered water, which is also somewhere between the unfiltered tap water and the soft Volvic. For A and B I wasn't so sure. The higher mineral content of tap water could lead to higher extraction, which might be an augment for B having the most aroma. However, with B being the best of all thee I was worried that this might be true, because I don't like the scale build up in my kettle. On the other hand, B having the highest acidity was a good indicator that it actually is the Volvic. 

When I checked, I was happy that my observations also aligned with the theory:

A: tap  
B: Volvic  
C: filtered

Since Brita filters don't reduce the mineral contents a lot (at least for magnesium and calcium) it makes sense the A and C were rather similar. Volvic standing out among the three also fits to it being recommended often for having a good mineral composition.

Maybe water chemistry is my next rabbit hole. I don't really like spending a lot of money on Volvic but I might ask my local roasters if they are willing to give away their brewing water in some 5L canisters.

I used a fast charger while going to pop into the shops, but it broke my heart. ESB one, just wouldn’t charge the car at all. I had the card and the app, but I would get a message just saying to connect the car, then I would also get a Coffee cup picture (wtf does this imply?) so I gave up and drove away. I was then charged €14! I think (is it possible) I paid for someone else who drove into where I was and i paid for them? Help line were no help.

I then went to another one local to me, this one I needed to use my own cable, but similar in that it would charge for 1 second then disconnect. 

So what am I doing wrong as it’s clearly me. Car charges fine at home . Id4 ",1,1753618297.0,evs_ireland,8,1.0,False
