I am the founder of Coastal Coffee Company in WA state. I've got a long background in coffee & management, and I've known for many years that I wanted my own coffee company one day-- but I didn't feel overly passionate about the idea until I realized that what I want is to give back to my community and help those in need. 

My city is drowning with victims of homelessness and seemingly also classist monsters who treat them like garbage. I could go on forever about this issue,  but to keep it somewhat short, I will share that my coffee business now puts a focus on re-humanizing the unhoused community, helping individuals and shelters directly, and connecting them with local resources, as well as employment down the line. The problem is-- I have the plans, but I don't have funding for any of this. I have a legal business, a website and socials, but I need a minimum of $25k to get this off the ground and grow it to be able to continue funding itself. I've applied for grants, which I am still waiting to hear back about, but putting myself out there on here as well. Would love to chat with anyone willing to support a great cause!

I just got a df54 after having a manual grinder for almost two years with my fp2.  I was happy with the results, lately I was really having a hard time motivating myself to grind so I decided to go electric.  

My question is; what is a good setting to start at to get me close to what you guys with a fp2 are using.  I know every bean is different and I might need to calibrate and align.  I just to be in the ballpark to not waste a lot of coffee. 

I usually only have Ethiopian beans and on the light/medium range.  My doses have been 15g most of the time.  

With my manual I was doing good and dialing in pretty quick, I just need a starting ballpark number.

I'm reflecting on the relationship and need some help determining if this break-up was in fact a blessing in disguise.,"It‚Äôs my first time posting here and I would really appreciate everyone's input.

¬†

Jane (pseudonym) and I started dating in June 2023 after meeting on a dating app. About 5-6 dates in, she had a change of heart and wanted to break things off. I responded saying that I understood and wished her all the best. Surprisingly, within 24 hours, she reached out again to talk, and after meeting in person, she decided she wanted to give it another try (much time later, she would admit that she was ‚Äúlooking for a reason to stay‚Äù).

¬†

Fast forward to October 2023, when I asked her if she‚Äôd consider exclusivity. She declined and I accepted, and we continued to date as usual.

¬†

Come December 2023, she informs me that she bought a one-way ticket to Mexico for February 2024. Although I knew for a while that she had plans to go to Mexico to work remotely and escape our harsh winters (we‚Äôre in Canada), I still felt insecure about her leaving for a long time without us discussing what exactly we were. So, over breakfast one morning, I asked her what she was looking for and what she wanted from our relationship. I again suggest exclusivity, to which she responded, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the difference between dating and exclusivity?‚Äù After some further talk, she agreed to being exclusive and got a little emotional from the conversation (she would later ‚Äòjoke‚Äô to her friends and family by referring to this conversation was the ‚Äúultimatum‚Äù).

¬†

The relationship lasted a year (until December 2024), during which time the following happened (some highlights):

¬†

* I went to visit her in Mexico twice (she was gone for a month), during which time she got pregnant. I had to find her a pregnancy test because she couldn‚Äôt be bothered to purchase one and find out herself (in her words, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the point of knowing now? We‚Äôre in Mexico. We can't do anything about it.‚Äù). After returning home, she wanted to terminate the pregnancy, and I supported her the whole way through. Afterwards though she refused to talk about what happened.
* She was initially still friends with her ex-boyfriend (she still had a photo of the two of them on her fridge, which she took down when she noticed it bothered me). After telling her ex that she was seeing him, he started acting up (demanding more attention, etc.) and she was forced to end that friendship.
* On multiple occasions, she said to me things like, ‚ÄúAre our personalities compatible?‚Äù, or she would admit that she had doubts about us, only to take them back immediately afterwards.
* She was extremely emotional on her period (which she admitted) and would tell me that I had to ""put up"" with it every month (she once had a public emotional breakdown while on vacation because she couldn't find a restaurant that was open).
* She once grabbed coffee with a male friend who she once had a crush on (and slept with). She told me beforehand, but it wasn't her idea to tell me (one of her girlfriends told her that it might be appropriate to let me know).
* She grabbed lunch with a guy at work, assuming it was a recruitment or business lunch. That same guy asked her out for dinner, and she asked me how she should respond to his invitation (rather than just decline it).
* When we started dating, she wasn't in therapy, but decided to go back into it because she was impressed by how dedicated I was to my therapy journey (I've been in it for 10+ years). However, some time later, she told me that she spent every therapy session she had talking about how different her and I were and asking her therapist at what point does she ""keep going"" with the relationship.



Now in all honesty, I had my flaws as well. I have anxiety, sometimes I'm grumpy, I can be overly sensitive, etc. But I'd like to think that I did the best with what I had. I do love her a lot, and when she ended things, I was a bit blindsided.

¬†

About 1.5 months after the break-up, I reached out for closure. During that conversation, she said that the reason why she broke up with me was because she was ""unsure of the relationship from the beginning, but that she ignored her concerns, hoping that they would go away on their own."" But after one year, her unsureness was still there, which made her pull the plug. She also divulged that she did love me at one point, but then later didn't anymore, hence why she ""stopped saying it or said it less frequently"".



I guess I'm just looking for some validation from this sub that this breakup is in fact a blessing in disguise for me. Thank you so much for reading!

Tom Campbell is a physicist who has been acting as head experimentor at the Monroe Institute. He wrote the book \`My Big Toe\`. Toe standing for Theory of Everything. It is HIS Theory of Everything which implies that everybody else can have or develop a deviating Theory of Everything. That would be fine with him. According to Tom Campbell, reality is virtual, not \`real¬¥ in the sense we understand it. To us this does not matter. If we have a cup of coffee, the taste does not change if we understand that the coffee, i.e. the liquid is composed of smaller parts, like little \`balls¬¥, the molecules and the atoms. In the same way the taste of the coffee would not change if we are now introduced to the Virtual Reality Theory. According to him reality is reproduced at the rate of Planck time (10 to the power of 43 times per second). Thus, what we perceive as so-called outer reality is constantly reproduced. It vanishes before it is then reproduced again. And again and again and again. Similar to a picture on a computer screen. And this is basically what Bashar is describing as well. Everything collapses to a zero point. Constantly. And it is reproduced one unit of Planck time later. Just to collapse again and to be again reproduced. And you are constantly in a new universe/multiverse. And all the others as well. There is an excellent video on youtube (Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge). The book \`My Big ToE¬¥ is downloadable as well. I recommend starting with the video. Each universe is static, but when you move across some of them in a specific order (e.g. nos 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.) you get the impression of movement and experience. Similar to a movie screen. If you change (the vibration of) your belief systems, you have access to frames nos 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 etc. You would then be another person in another universe, having different experiences. And there would be still \`a version of you¬¥ having experiences in a reality that is composed of frames nos. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. But you are not the other you, and the other you is not you. You are in a different reality and by changing your belief systems consciously you can navigate across realities less randomly and in a more targeted way. That is basically everything the Bashar teachings are about. Plus open contact.

I assume an appropriate approach is a combination of:

Plato (cave metaphor)

Leibniz (monads/units of consciousness)

Spinoza (substance monism)

Bohm (holographic universe)

Pribram (holographic brain)

Koestler (holons)

Tom Campbell (virtual reality/units of consciousness)

The holons (Koestler) may provide the link between physics and personality/identity. They may be what Seth coined as \`gestalts¬¥.

I (21F) met a guy (25) on a dating app. I have been on four dates with him. So far, the dates have been like this:

-We've done coffee date, lunch date, park date and movie date.

-I'm shy and I sometimes can't keep convo going. But the other times, he tells jokes, and I play along with him, and we laugh at each other.

-He said he wants to keep seeing me and likes me a lot on the third date

-After the third date, he texts more slowly and his responses feel a bit colder than before (he sometimes texts back with only stickers now)

-We haven't kissed yet. He doesn't really initiate physical touch. We once touched each other playfully on the fourth date while joking.

I am in an open relationship. I have occasional nsf fun and nothing else. However I recently met a very attractive Brazilian guy at a rave. We really hit it off that night, we made out, talked and exchanged numbers. A few weeks later we meet again, he invited me over to his apartment. We got drunk off tequila, and yea things went there. However due to my anxiety medication I was unable to properly top him. We are both vers so we ended up just Jo. This happened again a week later. A this point I was embarrassed and thought I would never see him again. He texted me and was very kind and understanding. We agreed we‚Äôd just be friends. He left to Amsterdam for a few weeks during the holidays. He came back in January and we hung out again but just as ‚Äúfriends‚Äù. We went to a gay club and after a few drinks we were all over each other, making out and flirting the entire night. We did this again a weekend later. I think we both realized we weren‚Äôt necessarily just ‚Äúfriends‚Äù but were ok with whatever was happening. I then realized this guy and I have lots of chemistry. It‚Äôs like the world stops when I‚Äôm around him. Just last weekend we went out again, and had an amazing night. He is from Brazil, and speaks Portuguese, Spanish and English. Same with me except my Portuguese is not very good. The whole night he was calling me ‚Äúgato‚Äù which a Brazilian expression for handsome. That same night we went to his apartment and had sex. I spent the night, and the morning after we had coffee. We spent all day together talking about us. About the future. About anything. This was timeless. We then had lunch, and got to know even more about him then. We ended the day at his hot tub, until I realized I probably should head home. I now can‚Äôt stop thinking about him. I don‚Äôt think he feels the same, but I just don‚Äôt know. Of course now I have bigger things in mind and are considering divorcing soon. I came to a realization that I no longer love my husband. This guy is healing me. I‚Äôve gone through a lot in this marriage and while I wouldn‚Äôt ever consider marriage again, it feels good to have this feelings again.

I get on v well with her parents and have visited them multiple times on holiday and hosted them here.  I obviously saw my cousin during these trips but tbh we are quite different people.  I never felt close-nothing terrible just didn‚Äôt overly vibe.  Perfectly nice person.

Cousin decided to move to my country with her child.  Now live quite close to me and other extended family.  I am single no kids.  There are other cousins who have kids.

I have tried to make an effort as I can see what a huge move this is starting a new job and living in new culture but I am struggling.  

I can get past the lack of things to talk about at times (due to not a lot in common) but it‚Äôs actually the lack of parenting.  Her much wanted and loved only child is possibly the most spoilt unparented child I have ever met.  Tbh she is just normal child, but the lack of her ability to say no and mean it means every interaction I have leaves me on edge. 

Obviously you can‚Äôt tell someone else how to parent but this child Gets everything he wants.  Out for coffee?  Orders whatever she fancies and takes one bite.  No follow up, never ever suggested next time she shouldn‚Äôt get x/y/z cos he doesn‚Äôt actually eat/drink it. 

If she wants to go somewhere else other than the planned outing, she gets to go and we all just follow.  

Clincher was recently when we were crossing busy city streets and she kept telling her to hold her hand.  Didn‚Äôt want to and absolutely no attempt to enforce it.  We went to step into the road to cross when a car came around the corner so we stopped.  Child dashed across four lanes of traffic and if car hadn‚Äôt seen them and slammed on the brakes I have no doubt would have been seriously injured or killed.

Tried to explain why they shouldn‚Äôt have don‚Äôt this and met with tantrum about how they didn‚Äôt do anything wrong.  Result of this was a trip to get ice cream on way back to the car.

At this point I honestly just had enough.  Maybe I should be more confrontational, but currently my way of dealing with it I think is just not to deal.  I feel really guilty but I can‚Äôt see me saying something going well, so just think I should step right back and stop making any effort.

Would any of you confront and explain why don‚Äôt any to bother??

Here‚Äôs my issue: I like him, but he‚Äôs quite a bit older than me (second dilemma). More importantly, I‚Äôm still figuring out who I am and don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm ready for a relationship (third dilemma). I don‚Äôt want him to wait around for me because this isn‚Äôt some romantic movie, but at the same time, I can see myself dating him‚Äîjust not right now.

Should I keep texting him, or is it better to set boundaries now?",2,1739406313.0,Crushes,2,1.0,False
1io6amr,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1io6amr/changes_youve_made_for_very_stubborn_weight/,Changes you've made for very stubborn weight,"What are some  favorite foods/or foods that you considered healthy that you've had to give up in your weight loss journey? What I mean by healthy is foods you thought were healthy but turned out to be hindering your weight loss. I'm curious to know.  I've been eating healthy for years, but I find that some foods don't work for me anymore or have changed with how they affect my weight/body. 

A little background I've overcome an ED and I've  changed my diet throughout my life several times vegan,vegetarian,pescotarian , now I just eat Whole foods (organic non gmo) no diet labels,but I've always tried to eat healthy,no matter what diet I was on. Firstly and mostly for holistic healing and allergy symtoms. My body has healed naturally very well. I'm pretty healthy overall,but my weight for the past few years has been at a stand still.  And it's been difficult to pinpoint where my weight is coming from or why it's so stubborn and taking so long to lose. I will add that I  have been under extreme stress the past few years and I'm well into my 30's now.

However,since I only shop at Whole Foods and health food stores and eat clean it's hard to figure out what I need to eliminate. Recently I've eliminated for now :gluten,processed snacks/food and cane/brown sugar. We'll see how it works I mainly eat veggies,clean meats,fruit,occasional cheese,eggs,water,very dark chocolate,decaf coffee,and occasional homemade gf desserts(sugar free sweetness with honey,dates or maple syrup) twice a week. I plan to stick with this for the next 5 months.

I've been in pretty good shape most of my life, not overweight, not stick thin just small (except when I was struggling with an ED I was underweight) but for the past few years I've been really  stuck in the in between with extra +30 pounds.To a point I I tried just to except it because I didn't want to be vain,there's more to life than weight,but it's been prolonged. And it's hard to shop or feel my best with extra weight. I'm trying to lose a least +30-40 pounds min  and keep it off.
 I don't want to be stick thin,just smaller and more fit.I'm open to any recommendations you may have and what you've learned on your journey. This may not seem like alot to lose,but when I'm bloated it feels like I'm even bigger. Honestly,I'm tired of thinking about weight and I just want to stay at a happy weight and eat healthy foods that I love. Because there is so much more to life,but it does bother me.",2,1739406277.0,loseit,0,1.0,False

Please understand that he doesn't tell me all the names of the foods. I write down the foods that he names, I have tried to figure out some he doesn't name but I am having a hard time figuring them out. If I make a mistake or miss a food name please put the name for the dish down in the comments and which episode. I am more than happy to fix my problems. I will also update this list when I get through more seasons and episodes. If anyone wants to help with the list by add names from other seasons or episode please do. I hope this helps people try new foods. **I am doing a part 2 because I can't add season 6 and 7 to my other post. I am mad I have to do a part 2!**

1io695n,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaximizeMe/comments/1io695n/how_practicing_gratitude_can_transform_your/,How Practicing Gratitude Can Transform Your Perspective,"Hey MaximizeMe fam! üåü

Ever have one of those days where you're just like, ""Can anything else go wrong?"" üò© You spill your morning coffee, miss the bus, somehow manage to step on that one rogue LEGO piece... and it's not even noon yet. Yeah, we‚Äôve all been there. But what if I told you there's a way to flip the script on those tough days? Enter **gratitude**. ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I know, I know‚Äîsounds cheesy, right? But hear me out!

**Here's how gratitude can totally transform your perspective:**

1. **Instant Mood Booster**: Think of gratitude like life‚Äôs reset button. üåü When you focus on what‚Äôs good, those stormy clouds in your mind start to clear a bit. It's like magic‚Äîminus the wand and top hat.

2. **Brings You Back to the Present**: Instead of dwelling on what went wrong (looking at you, LEGO), gratitude helps you focus on right now. By recognizing the little things, like a friend‚Äôs text just when you needed it or that perfect cup of tea, you anchor yourself in the moment.

3. **Creates a Ripple Effect**: Ever notice how positivity spreads? Your mood can affect everyone around you. By practicing gratitude, not only do you lift yourself up, but you also brighten someone else‚Äôs day. It‚Äôs contagious! 

4. **Turns Problems into Opportunities**: Real talk‚Äîthings won't always go our way. But, gratitude helps us see challenges as lessons. That missed bus? Maybe it's a chance to enjoy a podcast or call a friend you haven't chatted with in a while. 

5. **Builds Resilience**: Each time you flip something negative into a positive with gratitude, you're building your ""resilience muscle."" And with consistent reps, watch out world‚Äîhere comes the stronger, kickass version of you! üí™

**Quick Tips to Cultivate Gratitude:**
- **Gratitude Journal**: Jot down three things you‚Äôre grateful for every night. Even if it‚Äôs just that fresh-out-of-the-oven cupcake you enjoyed.
- **Gratitude Walks**: While out on a walk, mentally list things you appreciate. Maybe it‚Äôs the sun on your face or a stranger‚Äôs smile.
- **Thank You Notes**: A simple thank you note (or text) can go a long way. Plus, spreading gratitude feels just as good as receiving it.

*Have you ever tried these? How did they change your day?* ü§î

Remember, folks‚Äîlife isn‚Äôt about waiting for the storm to pass but learning to dance in the rain. So, next time life throws a curveball, try catching it with a glove full of gratitude. üòâ

1io692q,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1io692q/i_lied_about_something_so_silly_and_it_still/,I lied about something so silly and it still haunts me 4 years later.,"21f. I came from a dysfunctional household, I've kinda been a child/early teenager with no personality and a people pleaser. I changed and matured now but I still feel shame and guilt when I think about situations I've let myself tolerate. When I made girl friends (I rarely had male friends) I would make everything just to keep that friendship and I would cry and feel my world fading away when the girl would leave me. I would tolerate disrespect and insults and everything because I was attached and these friendships meant everything to me. I changed schools a little too much so it was on average 1 friend during every school phase, and I had quality friends expect for 2, the disrespect I mentioned concerns these exceptions only)

At some point in my life I had to study somewhere and you need to live with someone in the dorm. So I shared the space with that one girl, let's call her M. At first we were just roommates but eventually started chatting etc, and I was happy as for me it meant having a friend I'd share both my personal and academic life with. 

M always made comments, bullied me for my outfit or my hairstyle (there was nothing wrong with it and other girls would compliment it, even) and was passive-aggressive towards me. I on the other hand was always trying to be a good friend to her, keep her secrets, give her money when needed (she was financially more stable than me) grab food and beverages for as well when I'd bring snacks and homecooked stuff, drive her home when my dad would come grab me... a lot of things and in a nutshell, my exaggerated kindness (I am not saying that kindness is bad but as I told you before, I was... say... vulnerable? Weak? Stupid? I was that person that others would tend to walk over.) made her cross my boundaries (buying the most expensive meal and telling me to give her money because she doesn't have the full amount, barging into my dad's car without being invited not even saying hi or thank you, making a mess in my closet without my consent to look for a cloth of hers that wasn't even there,...)

Examples: We were in a coffee shop one time and I met my cousin, she made a comment about how much weight I ve lost and that I am glowing, and when my cousin left I told her that I m happy my cousin noticed my weightloss, she looked bitter and said: ""whatever, I don't think you lost weight"" mind you, both my cousin and that girl knew me when I was overweight. And everyone has noticed the glow up i've made during covid. She actively tried to convince me to cut my long hair, all while using a hair growth oil for hers. She often tried to take pictures of me in unflattering positions or situations... Yes I know that these things are so stupid but she was crazy.

Overall, that girl had a lot of red flags and when I think about it, it was obvious that she wasn't going to be a good friend for me but back in the time, I was dumb. So I gave her a lot of access to me. 

Okay so in that school I received a lot of attention from guys. I didn't pay a lot of attention to it but she seemed to be turning it into a competition as when a guy would try to approach me even in friendly ways she'd try to talk to him too etc... So one day she asked me if I am interested in someone and my dumb ass said the name of a guy just because he was popular and many girls had a crush on him, I just seeked validation and had absolutely no interest in that guy (he was athletic and good looking, and if anything, my taste in guys back in the time was the complete opposite), when I asked her back she changed the conversation. 

Eventually, she confessed being having a crush on that same guy, showed him interest and made the first step. In the mean time i was approached by his close friend which was more my type. She was trying to shame me about it every single day, like look I am now dating the guy you have a crush on. I was happy for her and wasn't bothered or anything, just felt stupid because I made myself look dumb. I didn't have the courage to tell her that it was a lie. She started inviting 2 other friends of her and the 3 would bully me for that. I felt so bad and couldn't even defend myself so I just remained silent.

The thing is that boy, let's call him J, started trying to get closer to me. I didn't engage in the conversation, I wasn't even interested in him and not willing to betray my friend so I remained friendly to him based on that principale. When I was there and she would notice him she would tell me to leave before he arrives (and I would leave, I told you, I was such a weak people pleasing dumbass), she would also try and make me look bad in front of him and make up stories, she even told him I woke her up at 5am when she didn't have class one morning, which was false because I had a class at 9 am, didn't wake up until there was 20 min left for class and she woke up before me, and I don't even make noise when getting ready if she's asleep, again I didn't defend myself and just swallowed it.

For information: J was popular as I said, ans also a bit playful, she was obsessed with him to the point that when a new girl would follow him on social media she'd say that she was ugly and stupid and that she would kill her.

Okay so one day she was seeing something on my phone and she noticed J's conversation. She said to herself in a low voice ""what is that doing here?"". Since then, she would close doors and windows violently in the room, ignore me constantly, make a lot of noise with her friends despites the fact that we have made an agreement not to let anyone into our living space (many people did that there because the atmosphere would quickly become noisy and not adapted for focusing on school, and i did stick to that comittment), use my personal space when I am not there and give me the silent treatment. She haven't spoke to me for the rest of the year, and everyone wished me happy birthday, liked my pics etc, except for her.

I was heartbroken and often tried to talk to her, but she kept mistreating me. I cried a lot about it and spent the rest of the year lonely as in that time of the year, friend groups have already been formed and she was the friend I had in the beginning so when I lost her I had no one left for me. That made living in the dorm a living hell for me so I ended up going back to live at home, only going to school to attend my classes.

This story might seem so stupid and dumb but it remained like an unsolved problem in my mind. It's been 4 yeas and I regret tolerating that poor treatment. I had such a low self esteem and no standards. It was a crucial year in my life and experiencing bullying and loneliness did wreak havoc on my performance. So yeah, I had to let it out. It's one of these ""when I was young and dumb"" kind of stories, but I am not proud of it. I do not blame that girl for what she has done to me as much as I blame myself because I did enable her behavior and put myself in uncomfortable situations. She's obviously no longer a part of my life but I deeply regret giving her access to my life and letting her hurt me.

My share will be around $156/month, unless the CP is counter-offered. 

I made several mistakes to get here, most notably relying on my husband for financial advice (a LOT of the debt on my cc was to bail out/pay for parts for his father's Mack truck) and generally adopting an attitude of ""I'll look after the house, he'll handle the money"". 

I'm working two jobs.... one though is cash-only (babysitting) and one above board. I hand my income over to him. Technically, it's voluntary, and he hands me over the household cash (we do a cash-only system for household and pet goods), but there's nothing for personal allowance or anything. If I want to replace my undies, I have to research a plan and present it for his approval FIRST. 

I'm just about done with that, so I'm planning to use this CP as a springboard to save myself money & get independence back so if I wanted to buy something stupid, like a coffee or a book, I can do so without any flak.

Tom Campbell is a physicist who has been acting as head experimentor at the Monroe Institute. He wrote the book \`My Big Toe\`. Toe standing for Theory of Everything. It is HIS Theory of Everything which implies that everybody else can have or develop a deviating Theory of Everything. That would be fine with him. According to Tom Campbell, reality is virtual, not \`real¬¥ in the sense we understand it. To us this does not matter. If we have a cup of coffee, the taste does not change if we understand that the coffee, i.e. the liquid is composed of smaller parts, like little \`balls¬¥, the molecules and the atoms. In the same way the taste of the coffee would not change if we are now introduced to the Virtual Reality Theory. According to him reality is reproduced at the rate of Planck time (10 to the power of 43 times per second). Thus, what we perceive as so-called outer reality is constantly reproduced. It vanishes before it is then reproduced again. And again and again and again. Similar to a picture on a computer screen. And this is basically what Bashar is describing as well. Everything collapses to a zero point. Constantly. And it is reproduced one unit of Planck time later. Just to collapse again and to be again reproduced. And you are constantly in a new universe/multiverse. And all the others as well. There is an excellent video on youtube (Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge). The book \`My Big ToE¬¥ is downloadable as well. I recommend starting with the video. Each universe is static, but when you move across some of them in a specific order (e.g. nos 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.) you get the impression of movement and experience. Similar to a movie screen. If you change (the vibration of) your belief systems, you have access to frames nos 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 etc. You would then be another person in another universe, having different experiences. And there would be still \`a version of you¬¥ having experiences in a reality that is composed of frames nos. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. But you are not the other you, and the other you is not you. You are in a different reality and by changing your belief systems consciously you can navigate across realities less randomly and in a more targeted way. That is basically everything the Bashar teachings are about. Plus open contact.

I assume an appropriate approach is a combination of:

Plato (cave metaphor)

Leibniz (monads/units of consciousness)

Spinoza (substance monism)

Bohm (holographic universe)

Pribram (holographic brain)

Koestler (holons)

Tom Campbell (virtual reality/units of consciousness)

The holons (Koestler) may provide the link between physics and personality/identity. They may be what Seth coined as \`gestalts¬¥.",1,1739405830.0,Metaphysics,0,1.0,False

Mass Human Initiated Contact Event this Saturday February 15th 2025 at 6 PM PST / 9 PM EST.



[Our first official human initiated contact event](https://preview.redd.it/zk4r6f1rtsie1.jpg?width=1419&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=252680b69036f19c4ec5c3ad7147c96ef27f233c)

This is the announcement of the first official Interdimensional NHI subreddit's human initiated contact event, to take place this Saturday **February 15th, 2025, at 6:00PM Pacific Time / 9:00 PM Eastern Standard Time.**¬†

For our UK and European friends we suggest doing it earlier in the night, about a half hour to an hour after sundown. It won‚Äôt be the same time but it will be within the same day, at least!¬†

We don‚Äôt think the entities will mind.

The goal is for us all to collectively gather in our separate places and reach out to the Interdimensional/potentially extraterrestrial entities interacting with humankind.¬†

We, the mods, wanted to encourage everyone to try reaching out to NHI at this time. We think with everything happening in the world today, it can‚Äôt hurt to get some benevolent NHI reaching back out to us with hopes of contact and assisting mankind towards disclosure and better times.¬†

The general message we‚Äôd like everybody to focus on is: 

**‚ÄúWe seek to connect in loving fellowship with those benevolent beings who wish to assist and guide us. We wish to raise the consciousness of humanity in the name of unity, love, compassion, positivity and growth, and we desire evolution towards our greatest potential. We desire disclosure. We desire contact.‚Äù**

Feel free to reframe the wording to fit you best, but try to keep the general idea the same. We want multiple consciousnesses reaching out across the globe simultaneously. We‚Äôve set this on a Saturday so those in Tasmania and Australia etc. can still potentially participate at the same time.¬†

We encourage starting a meditative practice now, if you don‚Äôt already have one leading up to the event. We are including a contact modality guide created in tandem by your mods, with some basic information and techniques.¬†Find somewhere in nature that would be a good spot for contact to be made (not near an airport or busy airspace, maybe a little more rural or open skies, maybe a higher elevation or a field, etc.)

Human-Initiated Contact Experiences (HICE) are not new; we‚Äôre not reinventing the wheel here - these are all just helpful suggestions for you to get started, until you find what works for you. The guide we are working on won‚Äôt be ready for this first pilot event but we‚Äôve included some basics¬† below just to get you started. This guide, when complete, will be stickied on the Reddit for future reference.

Let‚Äôs gather together, tune in and reach out on the 15th, and let‚Äôs see who communes with us! Be prepared to document your encounters here in the Contact Event megathread which will be posted the morning of the event!¬†

Please note this is just the beginning. We may try to do this once a month and would love to team up with other likeminded subs who want to do the same.¬†

**‚Äî‚Äî-  EXCERPTS FROM THE CONTACT MODALITY GUIDE IN PROGRESS: \_\_\_\_\_\_**

  
**SIMPLEST/QUICK METHOD:**

Find a good place to make contact. Gather friends, if you can, and create a light and happy atmosphere. Be in a positive place, well rested, fed and hydrated. If you believe in protective methods spiritually, religiously, esoterically, energetically - utilize them before you begin. Set positive intentions using our suggestion above. Go outside. Meditate, reach out, and, when you feel ready, open your eyes and look up.

**Initial Protocols**¬†

A meditative practice to start is helpful. If you haven‚Äôt started already here are some recommendations:

[The Initial Gateway Tapes Protocols](https://ia803400.us.archive.org/16/items/the-gateway-experience-manual/The%20Gateway%20Experience%20Manual.pdf)

[A basic primer guide to starting a meditative practice](https://liveanddare.com/meditation-for-beginners/)

We recommend drinking a lot of water, and avoiding alcohol, caffeine, processed or sugary foods or nicotine for 24 hours or more before you attempt contact. Be well rested - try to get eight hours of sleep if you can.¬†



**From a post by mod Pixel:** 

Dr. Diana Pasulka mentioned in her excellent book American Cosmic that Tim would receive ""downloads"" with extremely important information. They're basically ""inspirations"" that come upon demand.

He practices a monastic lifestyle in order to continue to receive the downloads. The downloads were the original source of the many medical patents that he owns. Additionally he uses those insights in his other duties such as when launching NASA's rockets.

He has a protocol which he follows to ensure this happens. The protocol is mostly common-sense things, but taken almost to an extreme.

‚Ä¢ Stay very hydrated, constantly

‚Ä¢ Stay very rested, 8 hours of sleep a night, awake and meditate for an hour, then back to sleep for another hour

‚Ä¢ No coffee, no drugs, no alcohol, eat healthy

‚Ä¢ Meditation: 1-3 hours of meditation daily. The downloads would come while he was in a meditative state.

**Another of our mods advises:**

A calm body is the root of a calm mind - not a mind without noise, perhaps; that can be worked past, and for some it will naturally be more difficult. But to get into the state that underpins all efforts of meditation, once any spiritual, nutritional and activity-based preparations one might believe in or choose to try out have been performed, simply breathe: take in a draw of air through your nose, not harshly but as much as you can pull in comfortably, hold it for a few seconds, and then exhale what you drew in out of your mouth, slowly and steadily. Repeat this process as many times as you need, in order for any feelings of stress, anxiety or burden to begin to be eased, and your mind to clear. (If you‚Äôre asthmatic, like me, simply adapt the amount of time you feel you can safely draw in, hold and exhale each breath of serenity).

Distractions are the next challenge you‚Äôll face, and it‚Äôs ideal if you can put yourself not only in a position you can comfortably be in - lying down, or sitting up; even standing, or in a pose of focus - for at least a few minutes, if not a far more extended period of time, being well-supported, but also if you can have a way of blocking out external interferences. If you have a place you can go and have privacy, where nobody is likely to bother you, all the better. If you don‚Äôt, and you‚Äôre not in the company of people who‚Äôd berate you for using such items while around them, try a combination of a sleeping mask and earbuds to block out light and sound, or headphones through which you can play assistive audio: perhaps brown or pink noise, or binaural tones, or meditation music. Different things work for different people. For my own part, I like to use a combination of natural sounds: the surge and spray of waves and seagulls, the whooshing of wind blowing through trees, and the pattering of soft rain without thunder. The key is to be relaxed, without falling asleep!

Then, once you‚Äôve got yourself into the position and place of calm you need to be‚Ä¶ close your eyes and simply breathe for a bit, as you get used to being in that state of sensory block-out. Perhaps recite a mantra, poem or some song lyrics in your head, if they help you to focus - though most don‚Äôt need to do this. What does tend to help is to practice observing any racing of thoughts you have, any bombardment, any flashes and noise, as though simply watching something on TV, not as the broadcaster; and ultimately to focus past even caring about observing it all, if you can, until it‚Äôs merely dull background muffle or haze. Shift your attention instead to the quiet beyond, and to the inside of your forehead behind your eyes, if that helps. Sometimes you‚Äôll find it easier; sometimes harder. Some days it may feel like a struggle to accomplish even a simple thing you did previously. But practice makes perfect, and everything you manage to do is a step forward toward meditative success.



**Positive Attitude¬†by Persephone**

I know we all hate it when somebody tells us to just smile, and everything will get better. Some days are harder than others - even awfully so. If one wished to reach out and meet somebody new, they probably shouldn‚Äôt do it on a day that they‚Äôre feeling particularly angry, grumpy, tired or otherwise in a bad place. If they must, they‚Äôll have to reach somewhere down deep and find that positive light - and then, maybe halfway through the conversation, they may come to realize that today hasn‚Äôt been so bad after all.

Human-initiated contact is like this too. It‚Äôs best to come from a place of peaceful, loving, relaxed meditation. So here‚Äôs a method, based on a combination of remote viewing prep, Gateway method and others for getting into the right mindset for these things on a day when maybe you‚Äôre not at your best:

‚ÄúFirstly, acknowledge everything you‚Äôre feeling today. It‚Äôs okay to feel that way. You can even write them all down on the right side of a sheet of paper, if it helps.¬† But for every thing you write, then tell yourself out loud: ‚ÄúI see you, but we aren‚Äôt going to think about that right now. We are going to set it aside for now.‚Äù¬†

Then mentally take that thought and lock it inside a box. Do this for each thing bugging you until they‚Äôre all gone. Then turn away from the box in your mind.¬†

Now. Stretch. Gently roll your shoulders to release all tension.¬†

Sit in a comfortable position. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath in for a count of four, then release for seven. Repeat this. If you cannot hold it the whole time that is fine. Do this three more times.

Now breathe normally.¬†

Feel the weight of your body in the chair or on the bed or wherever you are. Relax your jaw. Feel your cheeks relax. Your eyelids. Your neck, your shoulders. Feel every finger on your hand. Every toe on your foot. How each muscle slowly relaxes and sinks down. Feel your body getting heavier.¬†

Imagine all the negative energy inside of you from days of problems as a big ball of black smoke near your solar plexus. Now, imagine somewhere high above you a light, like the heat of a warm summer day. A bright white light. Feel the energy of this light for a moment. Feel its loving, compassionate energy. Dwell on it and its nature. You can think of this as Source, or God, or Buddha, or whatever you are most comfortable with in your personal framework. Just so long as it is peace and love and calm. Calm as a lake.

Imagine that light descending down to you as you take another slow, deep breath in, like a thread of light. See it entering your body through your nose. See it curling around the dark smoke within you. Now breathe out through your mouth, long and slow. Imagine it pulling that dark smoke from you, releasing it to the air and away like ash.¬†

You might release the breath as a sound, as a tone, if you wish. If that‚Äôs comfortable. If it helps. You may feel tingly or like you‚Äôre vibrating slightly. This is normal.¬†

Imagine this light filling your head up. Then your whole body.

Repeat this until you feel you are full of light. Until you are light. As light as a cloud. Until your mind feels full of nothing but this feeling.¬†

Sit with it, and relax. Now you‚Äôre ready to begin.‚Äù

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-



**The Contact Itself**¬†

Set your scene to be comfy and happy. Whatever that is for you. Alone or even better, with others. Release all negative energy and meditate on the positive using the earlier techniques or other similar techniques. Use binaural or audio cues to assist. Light blocking eye masks also work wonders for disassociation.¬†

Visualize yourself and where you are sitting. Then zoom out far far away above your neighborhood or wherever you are, above the clouds, the state, the country, the whole earth. Zoom out to the stars themselves and then come all the way back. Demonstrate what you‚Äôre wearing, what you and your group look like outside of themselves to someone looking on at you.¬†

Repeat your intentions for contact today:¬†

*‚ÄúWe seek to connect in loving fellowship with those benevolent beings who wish to assist and guide us. We wish to raise the consciousness of humanity in the name of unity, love, compassion, positivity and growth, and we desire evolution towards our greatest potential. We desire disclosure. We desire contact.‚Äù*

Focus on that happy loving positive feeling. Take your visualization back and forth a few more times to demonstrate exactly where you are.¬†

Reach out with your consciousness and senses and feel all around you. Feel for another conscious being reaching back with that same positive energy and vibration, looking for you. Connect with that energy, that being.¬†

Then, when you‚Äôre ready, stretch your body and wiggle your fingers and toes and come back to your present. Slowly open your eyes and start looking up.¬†

And drink lots of water!

Good luck.¬†

1io619q,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1io619q/best_coffee_maker_blackdecker_cm1160b1_review_is/,Best coffee maker BLACK+DECKER CM1160B-1 review: is this the ultimate choice?,"I‚Äôve been using the BLACK+DECKER CM1160B-1 coffee maker daily for a few weeks now, and I must say, it has become an integral part of my mornings. My experience with it has been largely positive, though there are some quirks worth mentioning. It‚Äôs a programmable, 12-cup drip coffee maker with a sleek black and stainless-steel design, and its features are both practical and user-friendly.

The QuickTouch Programming feature has been a lifesaver for my chaotic mornings. I set it up the night before, and the machine ensures a fresh pot of coffee is ready by the time I stumble into the kitchen. The Sneak-A-Cup option is another notable feature; it lets me pour myself a cup mid-brew without causing a mess. While convenient, I noticed minor drips occasionally, but nothing too bothersome.

The carafe is sturdy and marked with clear measurement lines, which makes filling it easy. Its ergonomic handle ensures comfortable pouring, even when the pot is full. However, the Duralife glass carafe, though durable, doesn‚Äôt feel as premium as some high-end competitors. The Easy-View Water Window is another thoughtful addition. It‚Äôs a small detail, but being able to see the exact water level at a glance saves time.

[Find the best price for BLACK+DECKER CM1160B-1 on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/product-reviews/best-coffee-maker-blackdecker-cm1160b-1-review-b01gjomwva/)

The coffee this machine brews is consistently hot and flavorful, which is a huge plus. The nonstick Keep Hot Plate does a great job of maintaining the temperature for two hours before shutting off automatically. While the auto-shutoff adds a layer of safety, I found the two-hour limit slightly restrictive. There have been instances where I wished for a longer warming period, especially during leisurely weekend mornings.

Programming this device is refreshingly simple. The large, rubberized buttons feel satisfying to press, and the digital display is easy to read. Even my tech-averse mother found it straightforward when she visited and used it. However, the machine‚Äôs semi-automatic operation means it doesn‚Äôt quite match the convenience of fully automatic models.

**Pros**

1. The programmable brewing feature ensures coffee is ready when you need it.
2. Sneak-A-Cup technology allows for mess-free mid-brew pours.
3. Digital controls and rubberized buttons make programming intuitive.
4. Coffee stays hot for a decent two-hour window.
5. Easy-to-read water window and clearly marked carafe simplify usage.

**Cons**

1. The two-hour auto-shutoff might feel limiting for some users.
2. Occasional drips when using the Sneak-A-Cup feature.
3. The carafe‚Äôs glass, while sturdy, doesn‚Äôt have a premium feel.
4. Semi-automatic operation lacks the hands-free convenience of some competitors.

**Comparison to Competitors** Compared to competitors like the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew and the Cuisinart DCC-3200, this BLACK+DECKER model holds its ground well for its price range. The FlexBrew offers a single-serve option, making it more versatile but also pricier. On the other hand, the Cuisinart DCC-3200 features a longer warming time and a slightly more premium build, but again, it comes at a higher cost. The BLACK+DECKER CM1160B-1 is a great option for budget-conscious coffee lovers who value simplicity and reliability over added features.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money** This coffee maker is a solid choice for anyone seeking an affordable, reliable machine without unnecessary bells and whistles. While it may lack the sophistication of pricier models, I found its performance more than satisfactory for the cost. The reusable filter is an eco-friendly feature that reduces recurring expenses on paper filters, adding to its overall value.

In terms of design and functionality, the BLACK+DECKER CM1160B-1 delivers what you‚Äôd expect from a mid-range coffee maker. Its timeless style, coupled with practical features like QuickTouch Programming and Sneak-A-Cup, makes it a worthy addition to most kitchens. While it‚Äôs not perfect, the cons are relatively minor and don‚Äôt overshadow the positives.

You probably know me from the absolutely delusional copypasta going around. Writing like an edgy nine-year-old is what happens when I get too stressed, apparently? Honestly, not even slightly upset seeing it posted everywhere and made fun of. I‚Äôm laughing at the memes too (in a sort of embarrassed at myself way, but still).



So, do I regret banning them? Yes. Will you believe me? Probably not, and I wouldn‚Äôt even blame you. The message was insane, the product of 2 days of stress, entirely too many cups of coffee, and external stressors that have nothing to do with Reddit. If I was acting with any degree of restraint, I would have at least asked another moderator first and they‚Äôd likely have been reasonable enough to rein me in.



Still, assuming you do somewhat believe I might genuinely regret this, here‚Äôs my apology to u/Comfortable-Gate-448. I‚Äôm sorry for taking out my frustration on you. I‚Äôm sorry for treating you like some sort of malicious actor when you were just one of many people expressing discontent with the rash actions of the moderators. I‚Äôm sorry for believing in the moment that I was making a good decision when, in reality, I was dumping gasoline on a blazing bonfire.



As for why it took me a full day to come forward, I was conflicted. A part of me hoped things would blow over and people would lose interest. Another part of me thought I could do more good for the community if I committed a ‚Äúwhite lie‚Äù and let this breach of trust go undiscovered while silently resolving to do better in the future. But another part of me has been aware that would make me a massive hypocrite and a scoundrel far worse than I already was. It feels good to write it out and confess, honestly.¬†



Anyways, that‚Äôs about it. I fucked up, and I realize that coming clean about it is a necessary step for the subreddit to heal after everything that just went down. I won‚Äôt sugarcoat it and defend what I did, the ban was undeserved. That being said, what happens next isn‚Äôt set in stone. Feel free to share your thoughts.



Personally, I want to keep moderating for the sub despite my lapse in judgment. One way I‚Äôd change if I stayed on the team to prevent this from occurring again would be to always double-check with other mods before taking an action as extreme as a ban. I could also be less active in general, to prevent my stress from rising to this degree again. I‚Äôd understand if people aren‚Äôt comfortable with that, though.¬†



If u/Comfortable-Gate-448, the victim of my actions, would like to comment on this I‚Äôd be happy to pin it as I believe their opinion should hold significant weight on what happens to me next.



Thanks for your feedback, and I hope you won‚Äôt hold this specific action against anyone else on the team.



Sincerely,

Tom Campbell is a physicist who has been acting as head experimentor at the Monroe Institute. He wrote the book \`My Big Toe\`. Toe standing for Theory of Everything. It is HIS Theory of Everything which implies that everybody else can have or develop a deviating Theory of Everything. That would be fine with him. According to Tom Campbell, reality is virtual, not \`real¬¥ in the sense we understand it. To us this does not matter. If we have a cup of coffee, the taste does not change if we understand that the coffee, i.e. the liquid is composed of smaller parts, like little \`balls¬¥, the molecules and the atoms. In the same way the taste of the coffee would not change if we are now introduced to the Virtual Reality Theory. According to him reality is reproduced at the rate of Planck time (10 to the power of 43 times per second). Thus, what we perceive as so-called outer reality is constantly reproduced. It vanishes before it is then reproduced again. And again and again and again. Similar to a picture on a computer screen. And this is basically what Bashar is describing as well. Everything collapses to a zero point. Constantly. And it is reproduced one unit of Planck time later. Just to collapse again and to be again reproduced. And you are constantly in a new universe/multiverse. And all the others as well. There is an excellent video on youtube (Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge). The book \`My Big ToE¬¥ is downloadable as well. I recommend starting with the video. Each universe is static, but when you move across some of them in a specific order (e.g. nos 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.) you get the impression of movement and experience. Similar to a movie screen. If you change (the vibration of) your belief systems, you have access to frames nos 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 etc. You would then be another person in another universe, having different experiences. And there would be still \`a version of you¬¥ having experiences in a reality that is composed of frames nos. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. But you are not the other you, and the other you is not you. You are in a different reality and by changing your belief systems consciously you can navigate across realities less randomly and in a more targeted way. That is basically everything the Bashar teachings are about. Plus open contact.

I assume an appropriate approach is a combination of:

Plato (cave metaphor)

Leibniz (monads/units of consciousness)

Spinoza (substance monism)

Bohm (holographic universe)

Pribram (holographic brain)

Koestler (holons)

Tom Campbell (virtual reality/units of consciousness)

The holons (Koestler) may provide the link between physics and personality/identity. They may be what Seth coined as \`gestalts¬¥.",0,1739405182.0,pantheism,0,0.5,False

The included coffee variety pack was a thoughtful touch, letting me experiment with different flavors and intensities from the get-go.

The Centrifusion technology is something special. Each capsule contains a barcode, and the machine reads it to adjust brewing settings automatically. It feels like having a barista right in your home, minus the awkward small talk. I tested espressos, regular coffee, and even iced versions‚Äîall brewed to perfection with a rich crema on top. My mornings became a little less dreadful with a silky espresso shot to kickstart the day.

[Check Nespresso ENV135GYAE-Parent price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/product-reviews/best-single-serve-brewer-nespresso-env135gyae-parent-review-b07dd5v1pg/)

The operation is so simple it feels like cheating. Insert the capsule, press the button, and voil√†‚Äîcoffee is served. It heats up in about 15 seconds, which is impressive for those of us who are perpetually running late. However, I quickly learned that preheating your cup is essential; otherwise, the coffee tends to cool faster than you'd like. A quick zap in the microwave for my mug solved this issue.

Another feature worth mentioning is its reusable filter option. While I mostly used the Nespresso pods, I appreciated having the choice to brew my own ground coffee. It's a small but significant nod to sustainability, along with the recyclable aluminum capsules.

That said, there are some downsides. The water tank, while easy to detach and fill, feels a tad small if you're brewing multiple cups or larger sizes. On one occasion, I noticed a minor leak from the tank base, which was unsettling. A quick check online revealed this isn't an isolated issue. It's not a dealbreaker, but something to keep in mind.

**Pros**

* Easy to use, with intuitive operation and quick heat-up time.
* Produces consistently high-quality coffee with rich crema.
* Sleek, space-saving design fits well in most kitchens.
* Offers a reusable filter option alongside capsule brewing.
* Capsules are recyclable, making it an eco-friendly choice.

**Cons**

* Water tank size could be larger for heavy use.
* Coffee temperature may require preheated cups.
* Occasional issues with water leaks.
* Capsules aren't easily available in local stores; online ordering is necessary.
* Initial machine cost can feel steep for budget-conscious buyers.

**Comparison to Competitors**

Stacked against popular competitors like Keurig and Breville, the Nespresso ENV135GYAE-Parent holds its own. Keurig machines are often cheaper and more widely available, but they lack the refined brewing capabilities of Nespresso's Centrifusion technology. Keurig pods also don't deliver the same luxurious crema, which is a major selling point for coffee enthusiasts like me.

Breville, on the other hand, offers some high-end espresso machines that rival Nespresso in quality. However, they tend to be bulkier and more complicated to use, making them less appealing for people who value convenience. Nespresso strikes a balance by offering barista-quality coffee with minimal effort.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

This machine isn't cheap, but when you consider the cost of daily coffee shop visits, it starts to look like an investment. The initial expense is offset by the quality and convenience it brings to your mornings. However, the pods can add up, especially if you're a heavy coffee drinker. Ordering in bulk helps cut costs, but it's something to budget for.

Despite its quirks, the Nespresso ENV135GYAE-Parent is an excellent choice for those who want great coffee at home without the hassle of traditional espresso machines. It's not perfect, but it delivers where it counts‚Äîquality, convenience, and a touch of luxury.

**Back Story** (because why not? If I‚Äôm going to do it, I gotta do it big!): 

I am a current program manager, and genuinely enjoy the project management aspects of my job. I looked into the PMP and decided to go for it. I purchased PMI's Exam Prep Course. 2 out of 10 - DO NOT RECOMMEND. I took away very little except the 35 training hours needed to apply in February of 2024. ARs Udemy course had been popping up pretty regularly on my LinkedIn, so I purchased it. And...  I personally didn't learn much from AR's Udemy course and just could not finish it. Between PMI's Prep Course and this course, obtaining my PMP Certification became less of a priority for me. But I know the benefit of obtaining a PMP certification, so a month before my application expired on February 8, 2025, on January 5th, I scheduled am at home exam . I researched alternative study sources, many recommendations of which came from this group, and here's what really really helped me pass the exam with less than a month of intentional studying.

1. Watched Max Mao videos on How to Study the PMBOX 6th and 7th editions - 8 OUT OF 10
   * The 6th edition video does a great job of re-enforcing the traditional processes, while the 7th edition video breakdowns the principles to use as guides when shifting your way of thinking. I approached the exam thinking that more often than not, selecting the answer that aligns with these principles in order of priority (as presented in the video) was the safest bet.
2. Watch about 1/2 of each of David McLachlan's drag and drop, agile questions, and waterfall questions videos.
   * He does a GREAT job of breaking down the question and the answer choices. He takes you through his through process explaining why a selection may be right and why others are wrong. 
3. PMI Study Hall 10 OUT OF 10 - If you don't get anything else, GET THIS! Questions are a lot more challenging, but the format and question structure align with PMP Exam. If you do well here, YOU WILL PASS!
   * Average Exam Score: 70%
   * Average Practice Questions Score: 67% 

**Exam Day (January 30, 2025)**

Leading up to the exam, you receive relevant information, so that you are ready come exam day. Review Pearson's and PMI's online/at-home testing policies and requirements! Run the systems test early. **Make the necessary adjustments to ensure you are meeting the standards, even the one's that seem a little flexible!** 

On the day of the exam, I knew I had 30 minutes to check-in. The check in includes going through the systems check again, taking pictures of your surrounding area, acknowledgements, and the green light from your proctor. I didn't have any issues getting through check-in. I did think there would be time between check-in and starting the test since I read that although you can check-n early, you can't start the test early. BUT NOPE! - I had hoped to grab a cup of coffee, but there's a certain point during check-in where you can no longer move around. Saying all this to say, I didn't have a pause between completing check-in and starting my exam even though it was about 5-10 minutes before my scheduled exam time. 

I didn't have any issues during the exam. A good majority of the questions were scenario based. The test is LONG, but the breaks help to make it manageable. I used both to just move around and stretch my legs. I was able to take sips of my drink, cough, twirl my hair while thinking through a question with no interruption or issue from the proctor. In the end, when I submitted, I was surprised to see a message that I would get my results in 48 hours (or 5 days - I can't remember) instead of the tentative pass/fail. Shoutout to you guys for helping calm my nerves by sharing this is normal for at-home exams! I know it's not much, but I have seen some horror stories around the at home exam experience, so I wanted to share my mundane experience for those that are like me and want to be stressed in the comfort of your home!

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced that GPT-5 will soon be available with unlimited free access, signaling a major shift in AI accessibility and usability.

OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, announced a significant shift in their AI strategy.¬†¬†**GPT-5**, the next iteration of their language model, will offer¬†**unlimited free access**¬†on a standard intelligence level, with higher intelligence tiers available through subscriptions. This simplifies their product offerings,¬†**consolidating various models and tools**‚Äîincluding the o-series and GPT-series‚Äîinto a unified system. The change aims to¬†**improve accessibility and usability**¬†for individuals, businesses, and developers, making advanced AI capabilities more readily available. This move has the potential to¬†**revolutionise the AI industry**¬†by significantly broadening access to sophisticated language models.

¬†This will (mercifully) end the era of multiple model offerings. Sam Altman just announced they're consolidating their entire AI stack - voice, canvas, search, deep research - into one unified system. GPT-4.5 (Orion) will be their final separate model release before integration. Here‚Äôs what you need to know: Check out this tweet from Sam Altman from a few minutes ago! Some Key Highlights: Free tier users get unlimited GPT-5 access at standard intelligence Plus and Pro subscribers access higher intelligence capabilities All tools unified into one system - no more model picking Integration of voice, visual, and research features across the platform

\++++++++++++++++++++

This shift - thankfully!! - addresses the complexity that's been building in AI deployment. OpenAI is finally, and essentially, dismantling the barriers between their various technologies - the o-series models (reasoning!), GPT series, and specialized tools - to create a single, cohesive intelligence system.

\++++++++++++++++++++

A few implications: For business: ¬†This translates at last to more straightforward decision-making process about AI implementation. It‚Äôs been a bit of a mess.For individual users:¬†It means access to amazing AI capabilities without the current technical overhead. For developers:¬†This means simpler integration and deployment.

\++++++++++++++++++++

While the free tier gets standard intelligence GPT-5 access, Plus and Pro subscribers will be able to get higher and even higher levels of intelligence. Watch this space, people!

Check it out at the [Apple App store](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/master-ai-machine-learning-pro/id1610947211) or shoot me a DM.¬†\*\*From Sal Altman twitter account today:\*\*OPENAI ROADMAP UPDATE FOR GPT-4.5 and GPT-5: We want to do a better job of sharing our intended roadmap, and a much better job simplifying our product offerings. We want AI to ‚Äújust work‚Äù for you; we realize how complicated our model and product offerings have gotten. We hate the model picker as much as you do and want to return to magic unified intelligence. We will next ship GPT-4.5, the model we called Orion internally, as our last non-chain-of-thought model. After that, a top goal for us is to unify o-series models and GPT-series models by creating systems that can use all our tools, know when to think for a long time or not, and generally be useful for a very wide range of tasks. In both ChatGPT and our API, we will release GPT-5 as a system that integrates a lot of our technology, including o3. We will no longer ship o3 as a standalone model. The free tier of ChatGPT will get unlimited chat access to GPT-5 at the standard intelligence setting (!!), subject to abuse thresholds. Plus subscribers will be able to run GPT-5 at a higher level of intelligence, and Pro subscribers will be able to run GPT-5 at an even higher level of intelligence. These models will incorporate voice, canvas, search, deep research, and more.¬†¬†

**What this means:**¬†This move could disrupt the AI industry by democratizing advanced language models, making them widely available to users without subscription fees.

In my opinion I dont think it makes a major difference. I think it may make a bigger difference if you are aiming for the smaller no name firms but most BB IBs and MBB consulting hiring is done through central programs anyways.

Most of the people I know getting hired from uni are bright students anyways that seem to be hard wroking so I'm not sure its that important in Australia ? But I always see stupid linkedin posts of people handing out coffee chat guides.

Any recruiters or recent grads/analysts that can comment on if networking helped them land a role and what type of firm eg BB, EB , Midmarket.

My thoughts below.

Pros

* More niche things to talk about / mention on superdays/ during interviews
* Better understanding of a firm if you know someone and have talked to them about it ? (links back to more talking points)

Cons

* Most graduate roles programs hiring is done centrally and I don't think networking alone can get you a grad role

I'm currently wrapping up the final Alliance Fran√ßaise A1 course. I'm not finding it as helpful as other things I'm doing, so I'm considering dropping that or switching that time to private tutoring. 

To date, I've been studying with Anki flashcards that I make myself based on vocabulary from the class and course book. A couple weeks ago I came across Kwiziq, and have added that to my routine as well. That and studying flashcards I made based on Kwiziq have become \~75% of my study time lately. I try to listen to a Coffee Break French podcast every morning, but I'm also curious if folks have other recommendations for someone at my level. Finally, I have a weekly iTalki 30 minute session.

I'm committed to spending at least 1.5 hours each day (not counting podcasts, tutoring, iTalki, flashcard preparation, etc.) studying before my trip. Do you think that is enough time to progress to A2 in 3 months? Any suggestions for me?

This is a long rant. Don't need to read it all. I am 28F. My APs are uneducated and I went to an ivy league which they're happy with but it adds another funny layer of pressure. I don't have a respectable career and am not a hard worker, which bothers me a lot, and I consider myself a loser. (So do they, but they would hate to admit it.)

Trying not to be hard on myself but I do blame my parents for so much. I just want to get this energy and anger out. These thoughts are very new and I only realized them these past few months.

My parents weren't intentionally awful, but they were neglectful in ways that mattered to me and did not want to do the difficult parts of parenting. 

They told me, straight up, ""Why are we supposed to teach you how to live? Nobody taught us that. You're just supposed to learn it from watching us, or from school."" I learned no life lessons, principles, or values.

I slept late, after 10pm, from age 6 onward. No routine. Never heard of such a thing until I saw a therapist. Finally trying to work on one now as an adult.

I got 4-6 hours of sleep in my teens. I lived almost 2 hours from my school, the best in the area. I cried because I was so tired everyday and wanted to transfer to the local high school. My mom started giving me coffee in a tumbler at 14 yrs old.

From age 6, I was addicted to reading books, video games, electronics, etc. and they never did anything about it. One time my parents said I had tantrums so they didn't take it away, but usually they deny that I had an addiction. They said, if you did, then sorry, but it was your fault for being addicted as a child.

My mom has gross personal hygiene and cooking cleanliness standards, and generally has no manners. Chews with mouth open, etc. Tells me to act like a lady but she is so unladylike and does not embrace being a woman-- where was i to learn this from? I'm learning this all from scratch now at 28.

She's also a bit of a hoarder, which I also do, but I am working on it. My dad abuses nicotine, alcohol, and caffeine. I abused those as well and dabbled in hard drugs for about 7 years and told them about it (to help my dad quit), but they just deny that I had these issues.

I grew up feeling so awkward and uncomfortable. I am still holding on to that discomfort. My mother has a terrible sense of style and pushed me to dress the same.

My home is bland now, and I struggle with feeling stylish or comfortable in my clothes. I have an addiction to buying things I don't need. My therapist helped me realize that I grew up with no values, no sense of direction, no identity. I don't love myself and it's been a terrible struggle to learn how to do it.

I also found out i have adhd 2 years ago, which was both a wonderful and awful revelation. I have always been called a slacker/underachiever. Smart but lazy. I am trying to learn how to control impulses, be more responsible, etc with my therapist, but I still suck at it. It's been an ordeal.

My parents actually say ""I love you"" to me regularly and I can't stand it anymore because i can only think about how i hate how i was raised. 
I have asked them to apologize for how they raised me, but they never do it sincerely. Always deny my perspective.

My long term partner, same ethnicity, knows them well and we have stayed with them for a month before. I rant to him about these things but it is understandably tiring for him. He tells me I'm an adult and I just need to change what I learned as a kid. Our relationship is ok and I'm ok with that.

I know, I have no one to blame but myself anymore. I have bad habits and behaviors that only I can change with hard work, discipline, and lack of ego. But why couldn't I have learned these things earlier? Why did I realize how imperfect they were only now? Why did I care about what they think about me? I like blaming them for everything wrong with me. It's bad. I hope I can stop. Time to stop being a bum now. Tomorrow is a new day. Make a plan to solve these problems and work on it day by day.

Even if i don't know you, love you all dearly by virtue of being here. It's a struggle. I hope you find peace within yourself and that you have a great week.",2,1739404503.0,AsianParentStories,2,0.75,False

Here is the original post, which describes the background process for how this proposal was formulated: [https://www.reddit.com/r/somethingiswrong2024/comments/1i5o10p/amnesty\_enforcement\_bill\_proposal\_for\_the\_14th/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/somethingiswrong2024/comments/1i5o10p/amnesty_enforcement_bill_proposal_for_the_14th/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)



Below is the updated version (preamble removed.)  I saw another post on here about ""What can be done regarding the 14th Amendment)?""  That's why I shared this status update.   There are obvious impediments to getting things to work in today's political arena.  (Like my buddy says, I'm only interested in solutions.)

¬†

A BILL PROPOSAL

¬†

To Remove the Amendment XIV Sec. 3 Disability of Donald J. Trump or Otherwise Enforce the Amendment XIV Sec. 3 Disability.

¬†

Section 1: Be it enacted, that any person who shall hereafter knowingly accept or hold any office under the United States, including the office of President and Vice President, or office of any State to which they are ineligible under the third section of the fourteenth amendment of the Constitution of the United States, or who shall attempt to hold or exercise the duties of any such office, shall be deemed guilty of a felony against the United States, and, upon conviction thereof before the circuit or district court of the United States, shall be imprisoned not less than one year, the length to be determined at the discretion of the court.

Section 2: Be it further enacted that Congress will hold a vote in both Houses three (3) days after passage in order to determine whether the impediment of insurrection will be lifted from Donald J. Trump in accordance to the prescribed methodology of Amendment 14 Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution (2/3rds majority in support in both House and Senate).¬†

Section 3: Be it further enacted that if the 2/3rds majority is not achieved in both Houses, then Donald J. Trump remains constitutionally disqualified from the presidency and may not lawfully serve in that office, or any other office and position in the federal and state governments of these United States of America.

Section 4:¬† Be it enacted that Congress rejects any electoral votes for candidates who were constitutionally ineligible to hold office in the 2024 election due to Amendment XIV Sec. 3 Disability.¬† Votes that were cast for a constitutionally ineligible candidate are hereby null and void.

Section 5: The creation of a bipartisan committee¬† to review and investigate the unusual ballot activity from the 2024 Presidential Election in the swing states of North Carolina, Nevada, Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania‚Äîand how it may relate to foreign interference and stolen election software from the 2021 Coffee County break-in.¬† The objective is a free and fair election; to ensure that votes were tabulated accurately; and to ensure that the results accurately reflect the actual votes (acknowledging the clear and present danger of Foreign Interference‚Äîespecially Russian Interference).

¬†¬† This same bipartisan committee would also investigate any active measures of election interference via mass disenfranchisement of registered voters during last minute voter roll purges and any bad faith lawsuits that relate to the election where lawsuits were used as a tool for election interference.¬†

Section 6: Anyone who knowingly disenfranchises voters on the basis of race accomplished through gerrymandering or attempting to do so‚Äîcommits a crime.

Section 7:¬† And be it further enacted, that whenever any person shall be defeated or deprived of their election as President or Vice-President as the constitutional disqualification is carried out, a special election should be held in order to determine the holder for the office of President and Vice President of the United States.¬† This act is necessitated by the Amendment XIV Sec. 3 Disability being in place during the entire process of the 2024 election and enforces the disability for electoral votes cast for ineligible candidates.¬†

¬†

This special election will be scheduled one month after passage unless the amnesty vote determines otherwise.

¬†

Section 8: This bill shall go into effect immediately.",10,1739404297.0,somethingiswrong2024,1,0.92,False

1io5i78,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1io5i78/my_toxic_elderly_drunk_roommate_is_a_mess/,My toxic elderly drunk roommate is a mess.,"So I have 2 roommates- one is 57M and the other is 86F.  The 86F used to be great- she is retired and has no vehicle anymore and she loves cleaning the house and she always pays her rent on time.  She occasionally would have a drink of whiskey in her coffee but her daughter got married recently and she feels left out and her drinking has drastically increased and she's been falling a lot and breaking things. Recently she got very drunk and broke her ankle in a compound fracture and there was blood everywhere.  So she's in the hospital for awhile getting rehab. The toxic part really comes in by how she constantly talks about people.  She literally has nothing good to say about anyone, period. I started telling her about a friend of mine who has been texting me a lot because he's going through a divorce and needs someone to talk to.  She kept saying what a horrible person he is and that it's all about him.  I told her about a guy I was interested in a few months ago and she kept saying that I wasn't good enough to get a man and that the guy was a horrible person.  I have a neighbor who is wonderful and helps me out a lot and she talks about her like a dog behind her back.  So recently my 57M roommate told me that he can't take it anymore because she has been coming to him complaining about me, saying what a horrible person I am and that all I care about is myself, etc.  I own my house and my name is the only one on the mortgage and she has been coming to me drunk, grabbing on me and talking trash about 57M roommates behind his back. So she literally is a toxic drunk who gets wasted and falls and breaks things and hurts herself and talks very negatively about everyone.  I badly need the money she pays towards mortgage and bills, but both me and 57M have been staying in our own bedrooms because it's so hard to be around her toxic negativity.  But at the same time, someone needs to keep an eye on her because she's always falling and hurting herself and breaking things.  I have tried confronting her about her drinking but she denies that she drinks at all, even though she has several bottles of liquor in her closet.  Since I am worried about coming home and finding her dead, I contacted her daughter and told her how much she's drinking and falling and told her it might be a good idea to take the alcohol in her closet.  But she didn't do it.  She did say that she was putting her in rehab, but not sure if it is an alcohol rehab or rehab for her foot.  Someone is getting the alcohol for her and it's certainly not me and not my other roommate and we think she's been paying someone like an uber driver to get her alcohol and bring it to her, but no way to find out who is doing it.   If this was your situation, what would you do? Note- kicking her out is not an option, I need the rent money and she has nowhere to go. ",4,1739404083.0,badroommates,15,1.0,False

My dad, after his mother left, became the one primarily responsible for household chores. Not because he wanted to, mind you. He would tell you 'someone had to do it,' and act like he chose it, but I know what gets me doing chores is either when nobody else is doing them, or I'm too anxious to sit still.

I sort of figured that 'wanting to do chores' and being too anxious to sit still were the same thing, so I figured we must just be the same kind of self-martyring person. I styled myself after that. I'm probably only on T because it feels better to do chores as a man than a woman, haha.

He always soaked the dishes for hours. Until the soapy water turned green, or worse, brown. It'd start smelling if he was really down in the dumps.

Now, I've just started drinking coffee with the cups we have at work. They're all custom mugs, it's a craft place. I always wash them after I use them, hang them back up, and sometimes I'll wash them before I use them if they've been left to soak.

But I've never soaked them. And nobody's ever said anything. Why are we soaking dishes if we can scrub them off quicker?",2,1739404048.0,offmychest,2,1.0,False
1io5hg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scorpio/comments/1io5hg6/how_to_finish_unfinished_business_with_a_scorpio/,How to finish unfinished business with a Scorpio,"So over on r/capricorns I realised that I have unfinished business with more than one Scorpio. I really want to know why and there is one guy in particular that I would like to understand. 

I have known him 15 years, we seemed to have electric chemistry, he had some stuff going on - addiction type stuff/self image and esteem stuff but he's transformational like y'all so I think this stuff is subsiding for him now. I asked him out back at the start and didn't know if he liked me. He seemed amazed I remember and then turned me down savagely - like it offended him but I would never have asked if I didn't think there was a good chance. Since then he has seemingly tried to tell me to date every good guy he knows over time.  

I asked him again 7 years later because we hung out by chance and he begged me to - he sabotaged that time pretty hard by making a bunch of shitty jokes and having a scathing attitude and I wasn't in the space to get above it at the time. It was the day of the date and I guess I wanted to celebrate some good stuff that happened to me and felt stoked to be seeing him but perhaps he wasn't, looking back. He really rained on the parade. I thought maybe he just loved attention and didnt want anything else at all but he also just doesn't seem lightweight like that. He acted like I asked for some big thing too not just a date.

So another 7 years on he's still out there somewhere around. He's in a long relationship now and moving ahead in his own way in life but he still messages - rarely - like he's checking I'm still there? Why is that? 

We met for coffee a twice in the pandemic but we were both in serious committed things at the time. I'm not a cheat and I don't think he cheats anymore. He's also pretty closed so I had to work hard to get much from him those times. He did say hed never been on a date. I fought the eyeroll. We were both were more adult that before somehow. I didn't/couldn't ask to meet him again then because I thought it would blow up my life and hurt others irrevocably and honestly the first two times I pursued him out burned me. Also the pandemic made it weird. 

What should I make of this guy? 
I am capricorn sun/pisces moon/leo rising/venus aquarius/virgo mars. 
He is scorpio sun/cancer moon/cap rising/scorp venus/scorp mars (i think)

I am a pretty pragmatic person but it's like I can almost feel him out there and always have been able to and it feels unresolved still. I think we probably love each other in a weird way although we don't actually know each other - some of his friends have joked that we love each other and others actively discouraged me from knowing him. We are very different in our interests and backgrounds. 

Can you advise!? Can I complete this level of scorpio to somehow end the game?! Might it have ended for him already? I guess I want it out of my head at last. ",1,1739404024.0,Scorpio,1,1.0,False

Tom Campbell is a physicist who has been acting as head experimentor at the Monroe Institute. He wrote the book \`My Big Toe\`. Toe standing for Theory of Everything. It is HIS Theory of Everything which implies that everybody else can have or develop a deviating Theory of Everything. That would be fine with him. According to Tom Campbell, reality is virtual, not \`real¬¥ in the sense we understand it. To us this does not matter. If we have a cup of coffee, the taste does not change if we understand that the coffee, i.e. the liquid is composed of smaller parts, like little \`balls¬¥, the molecules and the atoms. In the same way the taste of the coffee would not change if we are now introduced to the Virtual Reality Theory. According to him reality is reproduced at the rate of Planck time (10 to the power of 43 times per second). Thus, what we perceive as so-called outer reality is constantly reproduced. It vanishes before it is then reproduced again. And again and again and again. Similar to a picture on a computer screen. And this is basically what Bashar is describing as well. Everything collapses to a zero point. Constantly. And it is reproduced one unit of Planck time later. Just to collapse again and to be again reproduced. And you are constantly in a new universe/multiverse. And all the others as well. There is an excellent video on youtube (Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge). The book \`My Big ToE¬¥ is downloadable as well. I recommend starting with the video. Each universe is static, but when you move across some of them in a specific order (e.g. nos 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.) you get the impression of movement and experience. Similar to a movie screen. If you change (the vibration of) your belief systems, you have access to frames nos 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 etc. You would then be another person in another universe, having different experiences. And there would be still \`a version of you¬¥ having experiences in a reality that is composed of frames nos. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. But you are not the other you, and the other you is not you. You are in a different reality and by changing your belief systems consciously you can navigate across realities less randomly and in a more targeted way. That is basically everything the Bashar teachings are about. Plus open contact.

I assume an appropriate approach is a combination of:

Plato (cave metaphor)

Leibniz (monads/units of consciousness)

Spinoza (substance monism)

Bohm (holographic universe)

Pribram (holographic brain)

Koestler (holons)

Tom Campbell (virtual reality/units of consciousness)

The holons (Koestler) may provide the link between physics and personality/identity. They may be what Seth coined as \`gestalts¬¥.",1,1739403211.0,afterlife,0,1.0,False

1io51xw,https://www.reddit.com/r/FedUpNews/comments/1io51xw/federal_employees_reluctantly_return_to_office/,Federal Employees Reluctantly Return to Office After Trump‚Äôs Executive Order: Chaos and Unfinished Paperwork Ensue,"Washington, D.C. ‚Äî February 12, 2025

In what can only be described as a spectacular return to the glory days of paper-pushing, office banter, and awkward water cooler interactions, federal employees across the nation shuffled back into their cubicles this week after President Donald Trump signed an executive order demanding the federal workforce return to the office, ‚Äúwhere the real magic happens.‚Äù

In a bold move that defied the global trend of working from home, Trump reportedly told aides that he was ‚Äúsick and tired‚Äù of employees lounging in their pajamas, only to be told that many federal workers hadn‚Äôt actually been wearing pajamas, but rather‚Äîgasp‚Äîreal clothes while working remotely. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna love it, folks,‚Äù he reportedly said at a meeting, adding, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to get back to the office and make America great again, or at least make sure the printer isn‚Äôt out of toner for once.‚Äù

The results of the executive order? Nothing short of an administrative catastrophe. The air conditioning in government buildings, notoriously sluggish even during a pandemic, has now officially stopped working, leaving employees sweating in the same uncomfortable polyester pantsuits they were forced to dust off in preparation for their grand return. Meanwhile, the fax machines, once thought to be relics of a bygone era, are now being hailed as the most reliable piece of office equipment, standing proudly amidst piles of unfinished paperwork.

‚ÄúI thought the idea was to streamline our work processes,‚Äù said Linda Matthews, an employee at the Department of Energy, who was last seen staring hopelessly at a half-finished spreadsheet from 2017. ‚ÄúInstead, I‚Äôve spent three hours trying to connect to the building‚Äôs Wi-Fi, and now my computer's crashed. This is why I worked from home in the first place. I can't be productive in the middle of a desert of fluorescent lights and fax paper.‚Äù

The situation worsened when Trump‚Äôs executive order demanded that all federal employees, including those from the most essential departments, be physically present in the office to ensure accountability. Employees quickly realized that this ""accountability"" was less about making meaningful progress on pressing national issues and more about having to show up for their morning conference calls and pretend they were actually getting work done.

‚ÄúNothing says accountability like having a full mug of cold coffee at your desk by 8 a.m. while clicking through 400 tabs in an unorganized browser,‚Äù said Gerald Collins, a middle manager at the Environmental Protection Agency. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never written more ‚ÄòI‚Äôll get back to you‚Äô emails in my life. But hey, at least the president is on the job, right?‚Äù

Amidst the chaos, Trump made a rare visit to one of the federal office buildings to see the fruits of his labor. Sporting his signature ""Make America Great Again"" cap, Trump was greeted with a row of desks laden with sticky notes, coffee stains, and unmarked folders. After walking around for approximately 10 minutes, Trump commented on the state of productivity: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see any problems here. I love what you‚Äôve done with all this paperwork. This is some tremendous stuff, folks. You‚Äôve got it all together. Look at those printers, so many printers! Maybe I‚Äôll get one for Mar-a-Lago.‚Äù

The visit ended abruptly after Trump insisted on holding an impromptu meeting with the office‚Äôs receptionist, who was apparently under the mistaken impression that the president was interested in reviewing the upcoming office renovation plans. ‚ÄúHe asked me to make some ‚Äògreat, beautiful‚Äô changes to the building,‚Äù said the receptionist, who wished to remain anonymous. ‚ÄúThen he left me with his personal Twitter handle and told me to ‚Äòget it trending.‚Äô‚Äù

Despite Trump‚Äôs optimism, the return to office has sparked widespread confusion among federal employees, many of whom are now questioning their very existence as they sort through outdated budget proposals and cross out tasks that no longer seem relevant.

‚ÄúI thought it would be fun,‚Äù said one employee from the Department of Homeland Security, who requested anonymity out of fear of being flagged for not being excited enough. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôve been stuck in this cubicle for eight hours, wondering if it‚Äôs too early to start planning my retirement. I can‚Äôt even hear myself think over the endless sound of fax machines and printers. Someone‚Äôs trying to print a form, but we don‚Äôt have paper. And we haven't had paper since the 90s.‚Äù

As the dust settles from this historic return to in-person work, many are asking whether Trump‚Äôs executive order will lead to real, meaningful change in federal productivity or if it‚Äôs simply an elaborate scheme to bring back the glory of office chaos that he once knew and loved. Only time‚Äîand several broken office chairs‚Äîwill tell.

For now, employees continue to wade through mountains of paperwork and failed attempts at connecting to their shared drive, all while secretly yearning for the sweet, silent days of remote work. But as Trump said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve made a great decision here, folks. You‚Äôre going to love it.‚Äù

Stay tuned for next week‚Äôs edition, where we dive into Trump‚Äôs new proposal to replace all federal emails with handwritten notes.",1,1739402839.0,FedUpNews,0,1.0,False

1io4y9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/ambientmusic/comments/1io4y9w/sediments_ep/,Sediments (EP),"A little over a week ago, we released our debut EP,¬†*Sediments*, through TimbreWorks Records. This project comes from a new collaboration, and I‚Äôd love to share the story behind the album, as well as our writing and production process.

*Sediments*¬†captures improvised piano and electronic sessions, blending elements of ambient, neo-classical, and experimental live electronics. We debuted the album at¬†*Heart of Noise*, an ambient and experimental event series sponsored by¬†*Sound on Sound*, held at Cambridge Junction. It was an incredible experience to share the stage with Peter Chilvers (Brian Eno, Tim Bowness) and Michael Bearpark (Darkroom, No-Man).

I‚Äôm a pianist, keyboardist, and composer based in East London, while my collaborator, Elif Yalva√ß, is an electronic artist and a professor at Guildhall School of Music. We share similar backgrounds‚Äîboth originally from Turkey and now crafting music in the UK. 

https://preview.redd.it/fi4cbfd1ksie1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=71fb79d9a97127882a66d956def5cab2d2f1b33a

Before the pandemic, I spent a decade writing, playing, and touring with progressive rock acts. However, for this project, I wanted to create something more intimate and direct‚Äîsomething that could easily translate to a live setting when the opportunity arose. We started our first session in my studio without a grand agenda. Fun fact: during that session, my piano bench was missing, which caused a lot of hassle in post-production. Here‚Äôs a short video from that session‚Äîthe track actually made it to our socials back then, and we had no idea it would later become the opening track of the album,¬†*Drƒìamcr√¶ft*.   [Video from first session (IG)](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Csi5hPVIGRE/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==)

# 

Our process is simple: after a lot of music discussions, coffee, and maybe some wine, we settle into a comfortable zone in the studio and play long, free-flowing sessions‚Äîsometimes up to two or three hours. My studio is primarily set up for writing and production, and I prefer having plenty of natural light to keep the creative energy flowing. However, it‚Äôs not soundproofed, and since it's located under a flight path, short recording takes usually work best. But for this project, our long sessions made some of these external sounds unavoidable.

To record my upright Kemble piano (which I bought from Gumtree for a grand when I first moved my studio), I opted for Shure SM57s. The piano has a lovely, warm tone that fit well with the project. The mic feeds were routed through my session before going into Elif‚Äôs audio interface. There, she added her touch using Ableton, incorporating her own creation Max-based instruments and bending the piano sound with her custom tools. Her output was also routed back into the main session.

We also recorded an ambient room source. For the first session, we used a Zoom H4n placed outside the window, but unfortunately, it failed. For the later sessions, we switched to a Sontronics Aria placed in the room, which was very useful during the final production stages.

# 

There were moments during the sessions when everything clicked, and we felt completely in sync. But there were also times when we struggled to find a way forward. Later, I went through the recordings and cut out the moments that truly captured something special. Since we only had three tracks, this was a much easier process than what I‚Äôm usually used to. Some further edits required to remove long pauses, but overall, the EP is very much a live recording. These cuts shaped the four tracks on *Sediments*:

1. **Drƒìamcr√¶ft**
2. **Ap√°theia**
3. **Hwƒìoƒ°**
4. **Hyphae**

During post-production, I cleaned up some of the unwanted piano noises (and the missing bench creaks from the first session!) using iZotope RX, which is a common spectral cleaning tool. The mix itself was  very straightforward ‚Äîsome added reverb, tape saturation, and lots of volume automation.

The EP was mastered by James Edward Armstrong, an artist and academic with a strong presence in experimental and ambient music.

# 

As I mentioned earlier, we debuted the project live on the day of the EP release. Each track has recognizable phrases and moods, so our goal was to use those as a foundation for live improvisation. The show was sold out, held in an intimate venue, and the feedback was very  positive. We also got some really nice photos from the night which always helps to a good start.

Moving forward, we plan to perform more shows in the UK this year, with hopes of taking the project to Europe and the Nordic countries later in the year. If you have any event or venue recommendations, we‚Äôd love to hear them!

So that‚Äôs the story of¬†*Sediments*‚Äîthe debut EP from¬†**Philamelian & Elif Yalva√ß**. Hope you enjoyed this behind-the-scenes look at our workflow, and we hope our music resonates with you. I am here to answer if you have any questions and would love to hear your thoughts and comments.

Around Christmas time last year I accidentally bumped it off a coffee table and it had a fall which cracked the crystal. The movement appears to be running fine however and the calendars and chronograph functions all still worked. Other than the crystal all other aspects of the watch appear to be in good cosmetic condition and I have taken good care of it over the years.

I took the watch to an independent watchmaker in my area but I was told that they couldn't service it because they would not have access to that exact crystal component. I brought the watch my city's Zenith AD who sent it on to Zenith US in NJ for a repair estimate. AD told me that Zenith US said that the crystal replacement would be \~$600, but that Zenith also wanted to replace the hands and crown, as well as perform another movement overhaul, with the overall bill being $1900. They said that these other repairs were ""mandatory"", and that I would not be able to just do the crystal replacement - I either had to pay 1900 for the whole package, or the watch would just get shipped back to me as is.

  
As the watch was running completely fine I am surprised at the need for these extra repairs, and I am concerned about Zenith replacing the original hands and crown with non-matching components. Any others here who have dealt with this sort of scenario with Zenith? Any way I can escalate this or insist on just the crystal replacement?

So, here is my list of what are MY FAVORITE albums from the Chili's (not what I think are the BEST, but what are my FAVORITE). Anyway, you may disagree with my list but yeah it f@cking rocks.

1. Californication (Deluxe Edition)
2. Stadium Arcadium
3. By the Way (Deluxe Edition)
4. Blood Sugar Sex Magik (Deluxe Edition)
5. Unlimited Love

7. Return Of The Dream Canteen
8. I'm With You

10. The Uplift Mofo Party Plan
11. Mother's Milk
12. Red Hot Chili Peppers Debut
13. One Hot Minute

P.S. You guys might be like WHY THE FU@K are u hating on One Hot Minute? Here's the answer, One Hot Minute may have a few good songs on it like ""Aeroplane"", ""My Friends"", ""Walkabout"" and ""Coffee Shop"" but overall, it was a really dark album during the darkest time of their career, around that time (1994), John Frusciante who left the band at the time almost died from heroin, the Chili's were absolutely destroyed by Heroin while recording that album, and it's just too much, too dark and some people may say it had some of Chad's best drums on it or Flea slapped the bass on that album like crazy but it's just too dark to listen to, I feel depressed when listening to the entire album and you don't feel too much of the joy, effort and love they put into the album comparing to CALIFORNICATATION or especially Stadium Arcadium. Like if you listen to the Californication Teatro Sessions from 1998, you can feel the true feeling of WHO the Chili's really are. But that's just my opinion. After all, the question is not what u think the best albums are but what u think ur favorite albums are.",13,1739402382.0,RedHotChiliPeppers,16,0.85,False

I'll be traveling with a group of NYC folks to the Nosara area in June. We're all used to walking a lot, but obviously on mostly flat city streets. I expect more hilly/steep ""streets"" here than we are used to, which will be tougher if distances are far. It will also be rainy season, so, mud!

But, even still, we do not prefer to rent a car, as there will be a large group of us (we'd need at least 2 vehicles), and it's just one more expense and headache we don't really want.

That in mind, we are determining whether to stay in/around Playa Pelada or Playa Guiones. What is important to us is the following: being able to walk to a selection of coffee spots/food spots/and markets (for groceries so we can do some home cooking) and the beach itself within 15 minutes or so.

We are not partiers and do not care about bars. It's more about getting to share a good snack or meal together and get around fairly easily by foot. We'll have a mix of vegetarian and meat eaters.  
  
Right now we are considering a place in Guiones that is by Bodhi Tree Yoga, or a place in Pelada that isn't far from Il Pepperoni (if you happen to know either of these). The first place claims to be a 15-min walk to the beach, the second spot claims to be only 5 min. 

But, which will gives us more variety for walkable food and coffee and at least one decent market? We will be staying for 4 nights, 3 full days, so will need a few options so we're not returning to the same place over & over (preferably).  
  
And btw, we will probably actually go and visit both areas, using taxis to do so, but the question is which is better as our home base, where we'll spend most of our time?

Recently started a grief support/education group that runs at a hospice. It came up that at times we may need to inform others what is/isn't helpful to us and what we need from them to feel supported. Otherwise they will often not know how to support us.

**This prompted me to write up a ""How to Support Me"" list. Some of the things on my list include:**

* simply caring and showing a sincere desire to know how I am doing
* being sparing with advice and not giving optimistic or pat answers
* please ask what would be helpful for me instead of assuming that what you think I should do is correct
* if you have advice or offers, please ask me if I would find that helpful (I have done crisis and support line work, and we are trained to ask if it's wanted before offering resources, information, or any kind of suggestion)
* please don't assume that I'm fine or that you know how I'm doing at all (a couple people told me, ""You seem to be doing well!"" within the first few weeks of him passing)
* please ask me if there's anything I'm struggling with that you can help with
* helpful responses include just expressing care and concern, validating, saying things like ""I'm sorry"" and acknowledging that it's really hard
* please keep checking in or tell me periodically that you're here if I need help with something or want to go for coffee, or just send texts that I don't even have to respond to

I believe a first step is having a better understanding of our own needs. That makes it easier to let others know. I'm sharing the exercise as others might enjoy considering these prompts in their heads or in a journal or commenting here.

**Prompts:**

* What have people said or done that helped you? What did not help you? What could they have said or done instead?
* Looking at your list, are there any themes as far as what is helpful and what is not? Can you name any needs you have?
* Using the above, make your list of ""How to Support Me"" - this may be a list of dos and don'ts.",3,1739402261.0,widowers,4,0.81,False

# Kraft Heinz Faces Headwinds: Q4 Revenue Miss and Weak 2025 Outlook Spark Investor Concerns

Kraft Heinz, the packaged food giant, reported mixed results for its fourth quarter of 2024, beating earnings expectations but falling short on revenue. The company's adjusted earnings per share came in at $0.84, surpassing estimates of $0.78, while revenue of $6.6 billion missed the projected $6.67 billion. Organic revenue declined by 3.1%, reflecting sluggish demand for higher-priced products like Lunchables and packaged meat following recent price hikes. The challenging year was capped off with a disappointing forecast for fiscal 2025, projecting adjusted earnings per share between $2.63 and $2.74, well below analysts' expectations of $3.04. This outlook, coupled with concerns about worsening tariff risks, led to a significant drop in Kraft Heinz's stock price, pushing it near its 52-week low. In response to these challenges, the company plans to implement strategic price cuts on key items, improve product quality, and boost marketing efforts to compete for inflation-weary customers. Despite the setbacks, Kraft Heinz emphasized its focus on strategic brand growth and emerging markets, having returned $2.7 billion to shareholders in 2024. The company's management acknowledged the difficult market conditions and outlined plans to drive innovation and growth in emerging markets to improve performance in the coming years.

# Reddit's Q4 Earnings Beat Expectations, But Stock Plunges on Disappointing User Growth

Reddit's Q4 2024 earnings report revealed mixed results, causing its stock to tumble in after-hours trading. The company beat revenue and earnings expectations, with revenue reaching $427.7 million (vs. $405.3 million estimate) and EPS of $0.36 (vs. $0.25 estimate). Reddit also reported its second quarterly profit since going public, with net income of $71 million and free cash flow of $89.2 million. However, the social media platform fell short on user growth, a key metric for investors. Daily active unique users increased 39% year-over-year to 101.7 million, missing Wall Street's expectations. This shortfall was partly attributed to changes in Google's search algorithm. Despite the user miss, Reddit's Q1 2024 outlook forecasts revenue between $360-370 million, slightly above analyst estimates. The company's performance was bolstered by strong ad revenue growth and AI-driven initiatives, including a partnership with Intercontinental Exchange to develop financial analytics products.

# Gilead Sciences Stock Soars on Stellar Q4 Results and Bullish 2025 Outlook, Fueled by HIV Drug Success

Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) has seen a significant surge in its stock price following the release of its Q4 2024 earnings report. The company exceeded expectations with strong financial results, driven by a 16% increase in HIV drug sales and lower costs. Gilead reported adjusted EPS of $1.90 and revenue of $7.6 billion, with net income reaching $1.78 billion. The pharmaceutical giant's success in HIV and oncology sectors offset declining Veklury revenue. Gilead also provided an optimistic outlook for 2025, including the anticipated launch of lenacapavir for HIV prevention. This positive news has led to multiple analysts raising their price targets for GILD stock, with some setting targets as high as $123. The company's shares hit a 52-week high of $101.5, reflecting investor confidence in Gilead's performance and future prospects.

I (26F) figured this would be a great place to ask my question. So basically at my job I deal with vendors and one of those vendors had came by our office in person a few months back and it was my first time meeting him and his colleague, it seemed a little bit flirty the way he was making strong eye contact but then we chatted about food and I even recommended some food in the area for them to try, he sent a follow up email and said thanks for seeing them and they loved the food and then ever since then he has been trying to come back to meet me or my boss, I have declined multiple times and he has even offered to bring coffee and treats. I got an email this week how he would be in the area ON VALENTINES DAY and how he would love to bring me a coffee in the morning before their meeting. He left me a voicemail too and I called him back and  I agreed to this and it would only be a 5 minute meet and NOT with my boss. Do you think he is trying to flirt with me or is this just friendly professionalism!? ",1,1739402046.0,Advice,5,1.0,False

No prior heart issues, though I did have an EKG after passing out in the shower a few years ago that came back normal, and I've had no other episodes since.

For the last three or four days I've been having a strange feeling periodically in my chest, where it feels like my heart is skipping a beat and then beating harder once or twice to catch up after. It almost feels like a cramp where my heart is, but only for a second and not painful. I haven't had pain or dizziness with it.

Google says these are heart palpitations, that many people experience them, and that I should go to the doctor if they are ""frequent."" But the best definition I can find for ""frequent"" is three or more per minute. I'm having them about a dozen or so times per day, so definitely nowhere near three times per minute, but I have had it once where two happened back to back within a minute.

I don't want to be a hypochondriac and waste a doctor visit for nothing, but I also don't want to take any chances with heart health. My questions are:

* When should I see a doctor about it?

1io4l0j,https://www.reddit.com/r/goodwill/comments/1io4l0j/can_i_have_a_receipt/,‚ÄúCan I have a receipt?‚Äù,"I worked at a GW that isn‚Äôt there anymore. I was the guy who came in the early morning and opened the ADC or Attended Donation Center, for the people who never worked there. 

One glitch/feature of this place, is that there was usually enough donations being dropped off, to justify having me there to at least keep them organized and accounted for. In fact, it was early enough that I was always retroactively clocked in every morning, once the rest of the store opened. I was literally there to babysit the lot and just keep it organized, so it wasn‚Äôt a train wreck for the ADC day shift. This was literally a shameless grab at extra hours on my part. I made lots of extra money, just doing this. And proving what time I was there, was as simple as being seen on the security camera and beginning work at my scheduled time. 

The one caveat to all of this, was that everything was still locked up in the store. Everything. Even pens and paper and clip boards. There weren‚Äôt even business cards or pamphlets. Nothing. So I had no way to give anyone a receipt. 

Most people didn‚Äôt mind. They were just glad they had someone looking after stuff they‚Äôd rather donate than trash. A lot of it was people who were moving and just wanted to drop off packed boxes that were vetoed from the moving truck. Those were the ones who donated good stuff that sold. 

Most of the people who were there, were smart, cheerful people, who‚Äôd probably started their day with delicious coffee. But there are also different sorts of people. People who aren‚Äôt very smart and are probably only functioning on minimal whatever. This was before energy drinks were popular‚Ä¶ 

As if it was scripted, I would have the same identical conversation, with a different glassy-eyed person. They always had the same expression and almost the same mannerisms. I always knew this one was coming. 

Someone will unload stuff. They‚Äôll put it where I asked, sometimes fully committing to the donation by dumping it into bins or tossing it into pallet sized boxes. Then they‚Äôd hover there, amidst the organized chaos and grumble ‚ÄúCan I get a receipt?‚Äù 

‚ÄúSorry, I don‚Äôt have any. Everything is still locked up til 10:00 AM.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh, well can you ask the people inside for one?‚Äù 

‚ÄúSorry, nobody else is here. If you can come back when the store is open and find me, I‚Äôll remember you. I‚Äôll write you one then!‚Äù Most people were satisfied with this and it rarely caused any problems. 

But some people aren‚Äôt that patient. Some people move onto the next part of this seemingly scripted conversation. 

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ can I just get a quick one to go?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI am very sorry, but I don‚Äôt have any ability to give you a receipt. The company doesn‚Äôt want to leave blank tax documents in a box in the parking lot, for me to give out‚Ä¶.‚Äù And I would repeat the invitation to come back later that day. 

‚ÄúWell, that doesn‚Äôt work for me. I really need one right now.‚Äù I‚Äôd look around, point out the lack of anything on the counter and simply repeat my apology. 

‚ÄúHow about a quick to-go one? Just‚Ä¶ whip one up.‚Äù

I‚Äôd have to explain it to them five different ways. Mostly, the question was a jumble of cliche questions; mostly a pedantic rehash of the previous question. 

At that point, I was really into meditation and I had no problem keeping my cool. So I‚Äôd just go in circles with them. Most of retail is all about constantly repeating everything. But the experience reminds me of why certain songs are banned from music instrument shops. 

The variations that stand out best in my mind, were people who asked if I could whip one up on paper they provided. More than one person asked if they could go to a different goodwill and get a receipt, but leave the item here. I never agreed to this, even though I think one person actually tried it. My boss backed me up when I said no. 

Some people asked if they could be mailed or faxed a receipt. My boss said no. 

The worst offenders were ones who just didn‚Äôt listen. Whenever a loaded up vehicle came this early and wanted to unload and go, I‚Äôd tell them before they even started, that I didn‚Äôt have any receipts. During their unloading process, I‚Äôd continue to remind them of this. Then they‚Äôd be completely done and have aforementioned conversations. Sometimes they‚Äôd even try to demand I repack their entire vehicle, which was a polite refusal on my part. 

Some people would say they thought I was kidding around. Some would assume I meant I only had a few, so I was saving them for people who really needed them. Some acted like they thought I was holding back or maybe I had just one laying around. Or they‚Äôd point to random small boxes and ask ‚Äúare those receipts?‚Äù like I had some but just forgot. Or that I was lazy and just didn‚Äôt want to give them out that day. 

There were no hiding places. No storage lockers. No anywhere to keep a stack of sensitive documents safe, other than locking them in the store or ADC. But since the store wasn‚Äôt ‚ÄúOpen‚Äù, the building couldn‚Äôt be open. I wasn‚Äôt a manager, so I didn‚Äôt have keys or an alarm code. 

The district manager eventually allowed us to stash a few in the ADC. If a truck was there, sometimes they could write one. Or give me some to give out. I‚Äôd do it if I had some. But I‚Äôd still run out. In fact, the drama would be worse if I was giving them out and ran out just before them. ",8,1739401559.0,goodwill,0,0.91,False

1io4iqm,https://www.reddit.com/r/VacuumCleaners/comments/1io4iqm/questions_regarding_this_version_of_miele_c3/,Questions regarding this version of Miele C3 Complete,"TL;DR: First vacuum cleaner purchase. I've only been sweeping the floor and sometimes mopping but today I got tired of the constant dust and cat fur everywhere. Researched a lot, read the wiki, found that some Miele vacuums are sold in Chile and I got a few questions. You can skip the context, check the links and go straight to the questions.

**Context:**

After googling a lot of brands names, most are unfortunately NOT sold in Chile, such as the SEBO vacuums. But I found that Miele does sell theirs in this country.

They only sell 2 models for canister vacuums: the ""Classic C1 PowerLine - SBAD3"" and the ""Complete C3 Celebration Parquet PowerLine"". I'm more interested in the latter because I wanna buy one and forget about it for a long time, and also because I read that the ""Parquet Twister XL"" floorhead is much better than the one on the C1 Classic.

Also, their other models for upright cordless are way above my budget, and same for the ""bag-less"" options. They're are about 1000-1500 usd. [Link with all the models they sell for those curious.](https://shop.miele.cl/t/limpieza)

I read in the wiki that the ""Miele Complete C3 Homecare"" is recommended as a ""buy it for life"", that it's sold as local dealer only models, and that the expected price range is 1000-1600 USD.

However, in this country, it's being sold for around 500 USD, which is half to 1/3 the price compared to the 1000-1600 range. This obviously makes me wary. It makes me wonder if it's regional pricing (which is VERY unusual here. Import taxes and the cut stores get should make these be sold for 1300-2000 USD, not 500 USD), cheaper materials, worse motors, or skimping on the accessories included with it.

I did notice that they only offer [2 year warranty only for all models according to their webpage.](https://www.miele.cl/domestico/extension-de-garantia-479.htm) So maybe that's one reason for the lower prices.

[Also found on their official website that this is a subsidiary, not an importer](https://www.miele.com/en/com/subsidiaries-2156.htm#item-1-1)

Their google maps page [got lots of negative reviews about poor customer service. As in months for repairs or not fixing the issue. Most recent complaints are about other electronics such as washing machines, coffee makers, fridges, etc, and not vacuums though. There are a few negative reviews involving vacuums but they're like 2 years old](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Miele+Experience+Center+Chile+Vitacura/@-33.4264646,-70.530403,12.92z/data=!4m8!3m7!1s0x9662cf3564f4a413:0xce5462ec87d58c3f!8m2!3d-33.3959029!4d-70.5970718!9m1!1b1!16s%2Fg%2F12hl_q3r8?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDIxMC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)

**Links:**

[Link to the C3 product page](https://www.miele.cl/domestico/aspiradores-1784.htm?mat=10798210&name=Complete_C3_Celebration_Parquet_PowerLine)

[Link to C3 web store](https://shop.miele.cl/products/aspiradora-con-bolsa-c3-parquet)

**Questions:**

1) Is the C3 I linked overkill for a house with tile floors and laminated wood flooring? NO carpets anywhere. We have cats and yes they shed lots.

2) Do you think this is the same C3 vacuum sold in the US/EU but with a very good regional pricing? I mean same motor, quality, accessories, etc. for much cheaper.

3) Are there any important accessories missing in the model I linked vs the most common models sold in US/UK? All I noticed is that it includes an ""Active Air Clean"" filter instead of the HEPA one. But that can be purchased separately on their store for about 47 USD.

**Alternatives:**

If anyone else has more data on good vacuum cleaners in Chile, it'd be appreciated.

I tried to look for other options but most brands you recommend are not available here. I did find some karcher vacuums but I couldn't find replacement bags for one of the models I was interested in (vc1). [If you're curious, here's the link. They sell mostly shop/garage vacuum cleaners.](https://www.karcherstore.cl/aspiradoras/hogar-y-jardin/suelos-duros?initialMap=c,c&initialQuery=aspiradoras/hogar-y-jardin&map=category-1,category-2,aplicaciones-de-productos)

Also [this price aggregator website doesn't have that many options for canister vacuums with bagged options, which I've read are the best for hard floors](https://www.solotodo.cl/vacuum_cleaners?offer_price_usd_start=113.16)

Purchased at BM and sat in 65rh humidor for approx 1 month.

I forgot to try the dry draw.

Right off the bat, I had a couple runaway burns down veins in the wrapper. Possibly my fault, but pretty sure I did a decent job toasting the foot. 

Draw was super tight. Good thing I remembered to bring my perfecdraw tool. Look at that stem I pulled out!
Draw was much better afterwards.

First notes were spice and pepper. I noted it as red pepper.
Retrohale was a little spicy.
Wood also joined the party.

Second third brought in leather, with occasional notes of cocoa and coffee. Faint.
Halfway into the second third brings slight earth and mineral with a little bread hiding in the background.

My favorite part by far was the final third.
It got pretty full with stronger notes of cacao and espresso, with earth, spice and pepper hanging around.

I did have uneven burn throughout the whole time and had to do a few touchups. I was outdoors and there were occasional gusts. 

This was a solid smoke and I enjoyed it, but did not find it  groundbreaking.
Worth having a few in the humidor, but I would not go out of my way to buy a box.
I will reevaluate after the others sit for a few months.

Now here I am at 35, diagnosed with Type 2 at 277 lbs, 13.4% A1C, after years of smoking weed daily and indulging in nonstop munchies. I barely exercised‚Äîmaybe once a week, if that. Most of my time was spent sitting on my ass, stuffing my face with junk food.

You name it, I ate it.

At my peak munchies phase, I was dipping McDonald's fries into a Wendy's Frosty while waiting for a Taco Bell order‚Äîwith a half-finished Papa John‚Äôs pizza riding shotgun.

Then, basic tasks started feeling harder:

* Going places, talking to people, even visiting my parents.
* The back-of-the-head sweats never went away for months.
* Something felt off, but I couldn‚Äôt quite pinpoint it.

Then came the real warning signs:

üî¥ **Waking up 3-6 times a night to pee**  
üî¥ **Numbness & tingling in fingertips**  
üî¥ **Brain fog**  
üî¥ **Hands hurting when opening bottles**

At that point, I finally saw a doctor for the first time in over 10 years.

# üî¥ The Diagnosis: 13.4% A1C & 2600 Triglycerides

A few days later, the doctor sat me down:

ü©∏ **A1C:** 13.4% (*Full-blown diabetes*)  
ü©∏ **Triglycerides:** 2600 (*Disaster*)  
ü©∏ **Blood Pressure:** 139/91

She basically told me:  
**""You need meds or you‚Äôre screwed.""**

Then came the Dietitian:

>*""You should eat more fruits! Apples, bananas! More rice! Lentils! Only have a tasty snack every few days! Oh, and don‚Äôt drink alcohol more than once per week!""*

I just sat there thinking:  
*""Lady, I‚Äôve been drinking liquid sugar and inhaling burgers for years. You think a banana is gonna fix this?""*

I told the doc I wanted to do this without medication.  
She insisted on **Metformin & Fenofibrate for 3 months.**

At this point, I had already started researching **diabetes reversal**, and I wasn‚Äôt about to let some outdated boomer meal plan dictate my recovery.

# üéØ The Bottom Line

Most doctors will tell you that **Type 2 diabetes is progressive and irreversible.**

üö® **That‚Äôs bullshit.** üö®

I‚Äôm not special. **I was a junk food addict, high-stress, sedentary lifestyle kind of guy.**  
But I decided to do a **full system reset.**

üí• **ONE MONTH.** That‚Äôs all it took to go from **300+ blood sugar to 118 post meal.**  
üí• **ONE MONTH.** That‚Äôs all it took to start reversing symptoms I thought I was stuck with for life.

# If you‚Äôre reading this and you feel like your health is spiraling out of control, there‚Äôs a way out.

üëâ **Start NOW.** It‚Äôs worth it.

# üë®‚Äçüíª Am I Special? No!

I do **digital marketing & software development for OnlyFans.**

But most importantly, **I‚Äôm just a guy who thought he was fine until his body said otherwise.**

# üî• TL;DR ‚Äì Type 2 Diagnosis to 1 Month Later

* **Diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes (A1C 13.4%) at 35 years old.**
* **Blood sugar: 300+ ‚Üí 118 mg/dL (post-meal) in 30 days.**
* **BP: 139/91 ‚Üí 109/69 (relaxed), 128/80 (stressful).**
* **Lost 10 lbs (277 ‚Üí 267).**
* **Symptoms (brain fog, numbness, back sweats, fatigue) 95% gone.**

I‚Äôm locking in my **no-bullshit carb-free reset for the next 3-6 months.**  
After that, I‚Äôll experiment with **small amounts of healthy carbs**‚Äîalways testing my blood to make sure I pass with flying colors.

Meanwhile, I‚Äôll keep pushing my fitness levels higher for even better results.

# But this isn‚Äôt just about me.

If you‚Äôve read this far, something in you already knows it‚Äôs time.

It‚Äôs incredibly refreshing being able to bring up concerns in a conversational way, allowing for communication to flow in a health way, not feeling like I, as a nanny, need to walk on eggshells with the family.

A family whom genuinely shows that they care about the well being of their house staff, and a MB who is a big time believer of mental health and its importance for everyone.

It all started when we moved because of my job. We move out of his home state, and his 2 jobs to make sure our relationship worked (both didn't like long distance, but I said I would do what I could if he didn't want to leave everything he knew). He just said he would go with me so we went. After about 6 months we have had a few fights, and arguments normally fueled by alcohol which had him stating he should have never come down here, he wishes he stayed, but we press on because we both feel like we are each other's people. We get married and nothing really changes same song and dance. He is staying up till 3 or 4am playing games with friends from Europe, while I'm trying to sleep and ask him to keep it down and ends up not ""keeping it down"" so I go to work with 2-4 hours of sleep (interrupted not steaight). 

Hasn't held a job longer than 6 months since 2020 even though I have begged him while crying that the financial stress is too much for me to handle. He just says ""stop paying my bills let it go to collections I don't care."" 

Currently moved to another state, trying to leave the past behind us. Gets a job as a host the first day we move and we think everything is looking up. I transfer my Military benefits to him so he can go to school for cyber security,  has completed 2 classes since October (self paced with all class items giving on the first day you enroll so you can go as fast or slow as you want). Ends up getting fired in 3 months because he is ""too difficult to train."" Since then has applied to a few jobs here and there and no one is responding back to his resume. He currently sits on his ass in the same spot on the couch playing this war game on his phone, hardly does house work, hardly does school work, and can't work on anything when I'm home because there are too many distractions. But when I say, go to a coffee shop and get out of the house, he says not today maybe another day because he is really exhausted. In getting tired and it is really pushing me toward getting my 2nd divorce and I really don't want to because he is amazing. And when things are good, they are great! We just have really bad lows... I guess I just need help.

1io4agq,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1io4agq/county_fence_biannual_magazine_part_2_the/,"[County Fence Bi-Annual Magazine] - Part 2 - The Original Fence - by Rachael Boardman, Travel Editor","I attended what I thought was my last bush party a decade and a half ago. Back then I was home for the summer after my first year of university, which is also the last I spent any time here I wouldn‚Äôt call a visit.

This time I‚Äôve got my own place, if you call living in a van having your own place (#VanLife), and some money in my pocket. Also this one was hosted by our fearless editor-in-chief, Jules Octavian, rather than some asshole Brownloafian kid. It might have been the best party I‚Äôve ever attended.

Writing a travel piece about a private party you weren‚Äôt invited to might not seem fair but it‚Äôs the key to contextualizing Brownlow: we are, paradoxically, believers in private ownership.

Between these two parties I‚Äôve seen a good chunk of the world. Working in tech has allowed me to live in several different cities across multiple continents. I hit the road as soon as remote work became an option, that way I didn‚Äôt have to depend on anyone or tie myself to any place. When I left Brownlow I was in search of‚Ä¶well maybe I wasn‚Äôt sure what I was in search of, just that I was in search of more. Despite having seen more of the world than most people all I know is how little I know. And now I know that Brownlow isn‚Äôt lacking things to do, it‚Äôs that the things worth doing are invite-only.

That‚Äôs because the supply of property in Brownlow has traditionally outweighed the demand and those who have stuck it out prefer it that way. It‚Äôs shaped the culture: with no obvious need for density we could put distance between ourselves and our neighbour. More than a few of us tend to live outside city limits and the houses tend to ramble, even the cheap ones. Perhaps especially the cheap ones. Why take your folding chair to the park and hide your beer in a travel mug when you can drink from the bottle in your back yard? Why go to the public pool when you‚Äôve probably got a friend with an above ground? Why go to a cafe when you can make a better cup at home and linger as long as you want in your coziest corner? This isn‚Äôt true for everyone but it‚Äôs true for enough to lower demand for third spaces ‚Äî ie ‚Äòthings going on.‚Äô

Currently I‚Äôm parked in a clearing at the back of Greg and Laurel‚Äôs new property. He snagged one of those rambling acreages they used to just give away before the housing crisis could bestow them¬† with value. It‚Äôs funky and on the ‚Äòneeds work‚Äô side of rustic, but it‚Äôs all very lovely. I began my day with yoga beside the pond and, given the privacy, indulged in a swim au natural afterwards. When I finished I popped around to see what Greg was up to and was offered a world-class cup of coffee. We drank it in the sunlight and wood tones of his bright dining room while listening to an old surf record crackle and pop on his home-brew stereo. As far as I know the only cafe that could compete with my morning are the ones at Japanese hot spring resorts and they require a plane ticket. It‚Äôs not that things don‚Äôt happen in Brownlow, it‚Äôs that they happen at home. It‚Äôs about who you know.

Fortunately, thanks to Greg, I now know Jules Octavian. I‚Äôm not fully clear on the history of this illustrious publication, the first I‚Äôd heard of it was when Greg coerced me into visiting home, but apparently the magazine hasn‚Äôt had multiple writers since Jules‚Äô intern in the eighties. Naturally a party was in order so Greg and I jumped into his beat up Impreza and headed to what Jules likes to call ‚ÄòCounty Fence HQ.‚Äô There we‚Äôd meet Walter, an old university friend of ours, and Brenda Hogg whom Jules brought on as Napanee correspondent just prior to Greg.

From the road HQ looks like any of the other ex-farms the crown once gave away for a dollar. The old farmhouse sits tidily by the road, the perfect distance for foot traffic though a little too close for car traffic.¬† It‚Äôs where Jules grew up but these days is more of a retreat for friends and a film set for the odd period drama. Hidden behind the house is a sun-dappled farm track that looks like it disappears nowhere important just beyond the mature hardwoods that nearly obscure the sky. If you follow it, though, after a surprisingly long time you will emerge into a beautiful clearing with a solar-panelled three-car garage and a chic mid-century modern cabin hanging its screened porch over a bend in the river. There‚Äôs no way anyone who hasn‚Äôt already been here would know it existed and doesn‚Äôt even look like much on satellite maps. The house itself is beautifully appointed with a variety of oiled wood tones and stone. A wall of windows overlooks the river where he enjoys drinking scotch from his extensive collection while keeping tabs on the rotation of the world. Frankly, it‚Äôs glorious.

After dinner was when things got interesting. We were relaxing on the deck with full bellies, a bit of a buzz, and the smell of good cigars mingling with limestone river-water and toasty cedar when Brenda asked: why fences? Jules Octavian is not one to answer a question immediately, he thinks carefully before he speaks. So after a pause he gave us the same preamble you can find on the website (story found here) but ultimately said it was better to show than tell. Did we mind getting wet?

I often like to rock a swimsuit under my fabulous jumpsuits but that meant I was the only one who had come prepared. Brenda used the excuse of deer lurking on the roadside to make an exit and when it was just friends left Greg suggested that he wasn‚Äôt modest and the boys agreed with a nod from yours truly. Of course I joined them because you don‚Äôt have to tell me to skinny dip twice in one day. I guess that‚Äôs the Brownlow I never got to see during my misguided youth.

Jules put together some supplies in a picnic box he‚Äôd built himself out of oiled and waxed teak with hand-cut dovetails. The supplies consisted of the scotch we were working through, four crystal tumblers that fit into a little felt-lined tray on one side, a few ripe oranges, some marshmallows, bug spray, a lighter, a couple joints, and four beach towels. From behind the door he pulled two driftwood walking sticks with turks-head grips covered in carvings and handed one to me, informing us that the trail was easy but after a fall last year he wasn‚Äôt taking chances.

Outside a little rowboat was overturned on the sand that built up on the outside bend of the river. Walter and Greg righted it and Jules fit the box into a couple of brackets installed specifically for this purpose. Then we all undressed, tossed our clothes into the boat, and hit the refreshing water. The trailhead was just downriver on the opposite shore so we floated lazily and let the current do the work. As I stared up at the swirling pink sky, feeling the cool water on five sides and the muggy Ontario summer night on the sixth, I realized that the night did not need to get any better. It could end here and already be a great success.

We landed maybe two-hundred yards away on what could charitably be called a beach. Jules passed around towels and bug spray and after hastily dressing we headed up the small trail. Nothing was marked, just an uphill path trampled time and again over eight decades. A clearing at the top of a hill awaited us with small stone fire pit, a pine-log porch swing, two matching Muskoka chairs, and a coffee table made¬† by nailing rough boards to two stumps. The whole thing overlooked a valley to the west where the sun set over rolling hills of forest and farm. Separating us from all of it was a mossy ancient stone fence.

Jules put Walter and Greg on building a fire from a neat wood pile while he approached the fence and leaned on his walking stick, gazing at the dusky sky and the darkening landscape. Pink above and the beginnings of mist in the oversaturated-green valleys. He crouched and put his hand on the cold moss-covered granite boulders and I thought I could hear him quietly talking. After a moment I approached and he greeted me with one of the joints. We puffed quietly for a few minutes before Walter and Greg joined us, the smell of pine and cedar smoke earnestly mixing with the damp night air.

‚ÄúSo this is the original fence?‚Äù Walter asked.

‚ÄúThis is it,‚Äù Jules replied.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs on the other side?‚Äù

‚ÄúEverything.‚Äù

Jules has never crossed that fence, it belongs to the neighbours. There are no fences on the Octavian farm and Jules says he respects boundaries. That‚Äôs how he‚Äôs kept on good terms with the neighbours all these years. There was no reason to put up the boundary in the first place, aside from needing somewhere to deposit the rocks and debris from clearing the fields, and he intended to keep it that way. He uses the driveway when he wants to visit, preferring not to sneak up on people who tend to own guns. Though that doesn‚Äôt stop him from speculating. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs more fun not to know,‚Äù he said.

There are better places to see the stars, but not many. The oddly extravagant light pollution from Brownlow somehow makes it out this far and the haze of the Great-Lakes summer humidity doesn‚Äôt help, though it is integral to the experience. We thought we could see the glow of the Golden Horseshoe on the horizon, nonetheless countless stars revealed themselves in an almost dizzying three dimensions. A light patch bisected the blue-black sky made by the density of stars in our spinning plate of a solar system. Maybe it‚Äôs not the best view, but it‚Äôs pretty damn good ‚Äî and we had it all to ourselves.

¬†The world as we understand it began with the invention of writing five-thousand years ago, which in cosmological time is the blink of an eye. We‚Äôre looking more or less at the same stars as the Sumerians: the people who made their famous cuneiform tablet and earliest recorded written language separating history from pre-history. As we shared stories around that fire and stared at the endless sky humanity didn‚Äôt feel so old. Computers and pyramids were contemporaries and entire human lives just little flashes of attempted meaning along the way. Some, like the stars above, shining on well after they‚Äôd been extinguished.

When the stories became sufficiently outlandish that they were difficult to follow, we headed back. This time Greg ferried each of us in the dinghy. Jules settled us in his two guest rooms after a midnight snack of smoked meat and seedy sour-dough from a uncharacteristically good local bakery. In the morning he made eggs Florentine and we did a few crosswords together before heading home. I‚Äôm sure this is not everyone‚Äôs experience of Brownlow but I think I can safely say I‚Äôve finally experienced its best side.
