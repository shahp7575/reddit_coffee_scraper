1qocjfq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttractionDynamics/comments/1qocjfq/the_psychology_of_hidden_attraction_9_signs/,The Psychology of Hidden Attraction: 9 Signs Someone's Secretly Into You,"You ever get that weird vibe from someone where they're acting normal but something feels... off? Like they're holding back? Yeah, I've been there. And after digging through psychology research, relationship podcasts, and way too many expert interviews, I realized most of us are terrible at reading these signs. We miss them because we're either oblivious or scared to believe someone might actually like us. So here's what I found, no fluff, just real behavioral science mixed with actual human experience.

## 1: They remember the random shit you said three weeks ago

This is huge. When someone's into you but hiding it, their brain goes into hyperfocus mode. You mention offhand that you hate cilantro or that you're obsessed with some obscure band, and boom, three weeks later they bring it up like it's nothing. That's not coincidence. That's their brain cataloging every detail about you because you matter to them.

Psychology calls this ""motivated attention."" When we care about someone romantically, our brains prioritize information about them. We remember details that seem trivial to everyone else because we're subconsciously building a file on this person. If someone remembers your random coffee order or that story about your childhood dog, they're probably feeling something.

## 2: Their body betrays them even when their mouth doesn't

Watch their feet. Seriously. When someone's hiding feelings, their body language screams what their words won't say. Their feet point toward you in group settings. They lean in when you talk. Their pupils dilate when they look at you (if you're close enough to notice). They mirror your movements without realizing it.

Dr. Amy Cuddy's research on body language shows we can't fully control nonverbal cues when we're emotionally invested. Someone might play it cool verbally, but their body? That's doing its own thing. If they're always angling themselves toward you, touching their face or hair when you're around, or finding excuses to be physically closer, their feelings are leaking out.

## 3: They get weirdly competitive or show offy around you

This one's primal as hell. When someone likes you but won't admit it, they'll suddenly become the most accomplished, funny, talented person in the room when you show up. They're peacocking, even if they don't realize it. Making jokes, telling their best stories, casually mentioning achievements. It's biological display behavior.

Read ""The Evolution of Desire"" by David Buss if you want the deep dive on this. He's an evolutionary psychologist who spent decades studying human mating behavior. The book breaks down how humans unconsciously advertise their value to potential partners. When someone's doing this around you specifically, they're trying to impress you without directly saying ""hey, I like you.""

## 4: They act different around you versus everyone else

Pay attention to how they interact with others compared to you. Are they chill with everyone else but nervous around you? Or maybe super confident with others but weirdly vulnerable with you? That shift in behavior is a dead giveaway.

This inconsistency happens because hidden feelings create internal conflict. They want to be themselves but also impress you. They want to get close but fear rejection. So their behavior gets inconsistent and unpredictable. One day they're texting you constantly, the next they're distant. It's not game playing, it's emotional overwhelm.

## 5: They find ridiculous excuses to contact you

""Hey, random question..."" texts at 10pm. Asking for your opinion on something they definitely don't need your opinion on. Sending you memes that are only mildly funny. These aren't accidents. They're manufactured reasons to stay connected without admitting they just want to talk to you.

Esther Perel talks about this in her podcast ""Where Should We Begin?"" She discusses how people create ""plausible deniability"" in early attraction. They need excuses to reach out because direct communication feels too vulnerable. If someone's finding creative reasons to text you about absolutely nothing important, they're probably hiding feelings.

## 6: They get jealous but try to hide it

This one's messy. When someone's into you but hiding it, seeing you with other potential romantic interests triggers them hard. They might make weird comments, suddenly seem less interested in conversation, or ask probing questions about your relationship status disguised as casual curiosity.

Matthew Hussey's ""Get the Guy"" digs into this behavior pattern. He explains that jealousy without a relationship is one of the clearest signs of hidden romantic interest. They have no claim on you, so they can't express jealousy openly. Instead, it comes out sideways, through mood changes or passive comments.

## 7: They're always ""just happening"" to be where you are

Coincidentally at the same coffee shop. Showing up to events they never attended before. Suddenly interested in hobbies you mentioned. This isn't fate, it's intentional proximity seeking. They're engineering chances to see you without making it obvious.

Research on ""mere exposure effect"" shows we develop preferences for things (and people) we encounter frequently. On some level, they know this. By increasing proximity, they're hoping familiarity breeds attraction. If someone's life suddenly overlaps with yours way more than before, they're probably orchestrating it.

## 8: They ask your friends about you

This is middle school behavior that never actually stops. When someone's hiding feelings, they'll pump your mutual friends for information. What's your type? Are you seeing anyone? What do you like to do? They're gathering intel without exposing themselves to potential rejection.

If your friends start mentioning that so-and-so was asking about you, that's not random curiosity. They're trying to assess their chances and learn more about you through a safer channel. It's reconnaissance disguised as casual conversation.

## 9: The eye contact is INTENSE

Eye contact with hidden feelings hits different. It's longer than normal, more frequent than necessary, and often followed by them quickly looking away when you catch them. Or the opposite, they avoid eye contact entirely because it feels too revealing.

Research published in the Journal of Research in Personality found that prolonged eye contact increases feelings of attraction and connection. When someone's fighting their feelings, eye contact becomes this charged thing they can't quite control. Too much reveals them, too little seems weird, so they end up doing this awkward dance of looking and not looking.

## Why people hide feelings in the first place

Here's the thing that most advice skips: people hide feelings for legitimate reasons. Fear of rejection, not wanting to ruin a friendship, workplace complications, timing issues, past trauma, or just general emotional unavailability. It's not always strategic game playing.

Dr. Brené Brown's work on vulnerability explains how admitting romantic feelings is one of the scariest forms of emotional exposure. We're basically saying ""I like you, please don't hurt me with that information."" For some people, hiding feelings feels safer than risking that vulnerability.

Understanding this doesn't mean you should wait around forever for someone to get brave. It just means recognizing that hidden feelings are often about their own fear and limitations, not about your worth.

## What to actually do with this information

Look, spotting these signs is one thing. Acting on them is another. If you're seeing multiple signs and you're interested too, consider making a move yourself. Drop hints back. Create opportunities for them to open up. Or hell, just be direct if you can handle potential awkwardness.

If you want to go deeper into understanding attraction patterns and communication dynamics without spending hours reading every psychology book, there's an app called BeFreed that pulls together insights from relationship experts like Esther Perel, books on evolutionary psychology, and research on social behavior into personalized audio lessons. You can set specific goals like ""understanding hidden attraction signals"" or ""becoming more confident in dating,"" and it creates a structured learning plan tailored to your situation. The content draws from vetted sources, books, expert interviews, and research papers in psychology and relationships, so it's grounded in actual science. You can adjust how deep you want to go, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute detailed breakdowns with real examples. Plus you can pick different voices, including some surprisingly engaging ones that make the commute way less boring.

But if you notice these signs and you're NOT interested, do everyone a favor and establish clearer boundaries. Don't lead them on unintentionally by being overly available or flirty. Clarity is kindness, even when it's uncomfortable.

And if you're the one hiding feelings? Maybe consider that vulnerability isn't actually weakness. The worst that happens is rejection, which sucks but is survivable. The best that happens is you get the connection you actually want instead of this weird half-hidden thing that's exhausting for everyone involved.",1,1769517023.0,AttractionDynamics,0,1.0,False
1qochb8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qochb8,Leaf N Latte Cafe‼️,"No sugarcoating, ulla kaaryam parayam. I've already left a humble review in Google. Now I shall post it here, just to give everyone a heads up.

Went to *Leaf N Latte Café* for lunch with the girls, and it was honestly both frustrating and disappointing. We expected some waiting time but we didn’t expect to waste nearly an hour and fifteen minutes for food that felt rushed, poorly made, and completely unfulfilling. 

The service itself was lacking and unprofessional, which only made the experience worse. We had to remind them to take our order twice. Ordered a few drinks, wraps, and loaded fries. Drinks were refreshing.

Loaded fries were **average** at best, the cheese wasn’t fully melted, though the chicken was cooked properly. Even then, just a few bites felt extremely heavy and **overwhelming** because of the clash of every sauces known to mankind mixed inside.

The wraps were the *biggest letdown.* It wasn’t even wrapped properly; most of the fillings and cheese were spilling out, and there was some unidentifiable fried substance which we still haven't figured it out. Only justification we could find is that they were shortstaffed and they had to bring in an employee's toddler to help around the kitchen.

We felt guilty wasting food but eventually realised it was better than forcing ourselves to eat something that might make us sick later.  Walking out, we genuinely couldn’t believe we had spent so much time and money on such ""aarkko enthino vendi"" food, especially from a café that’s so hyped up by everyone.

I've been trying to yknow, keep it cool. I do (or try to do) the same stuff I do daily, been getting a bit better an it (the first days I didn't even get out of bed, today I actually got up early and made myself some coffee), but I just can't fully feel like it's fine. I constantly check to see if they've texted me (we are still talking daily and mantain a kinda sweet tone, the reason of breakup was mainly that their mental health wasn't doing good and they realized they didn't want a relationship atm and also that I was too emotionally dependant on them and it hurt us both).

I also do affirmations and started trying saturation yesterday, but I just can't fully shake it off. I try to convince myself like ""they're online and not replying? must be busy, they're waiting until they're free to text me so they can actually have a chat with me"" and stuff like that, but I can't help but think about it and worry about it.

I've been trying to change the focus of my affirmations towards myself, saying stuff like ""I manifest all I want to"" and ""SP is in love with me"" ""SP can't stop thinking about me"" paired with stuff like ""SP and I are dating again"", but I just can't fully shake off the insecurity",1,1769516824.0,Manifestation,0,1.0,False
1qocg7m,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/1qocg7m/late_20s_financially_secure_but_burned_out_how_do/,"Late 20s & financially secure, but burned out – how do I choose between pushing vs. slowing down?","I’m single, in my late 20s, and feeling conflicted about where I’m headed. Hoping to hear from others who’ve navigated something similar.

I’m a Staff-level (L6) Product role in big tech and went hard early — three internships in college, started working right after graduation, and got promoted at the fastest pace my company allows. I cared deeply about my work and its impact, and that drive paid off — on paper.

Financially, I’m doing well. Income is \~$500K and net worth just crossed $2M. This is part of the tension – I don’t really need to optimize for max income, and that’s changed how I feel about work.

Lately, I’ve felt burned out and detached. I don’t really care anymore, which scares me because caring fueled my career. At the same time, I feel a strong expectation that I should keep working to not “waste” my peak earning years. Working hard is what I’ve always done — it feels like all I know.



**> The big tension**

One part of me wants calm, simplicity, and peace — slower days and space to exist. Another craves stimulus, novelty, and energy — more life, more options, more things happening. Neither feels like a complete answer; too much stimulus is exhausting but too much calm makes me worry about boredom or career stagnation.

I could push more. I execute and strategize well, have a strong track record, and play well with the C-suite. Director/VP in my early 30s is actually quite possible. But that requires totally new kinds of effort, and I’m honestly not sure how I feel about that. Plus, I don’t really need the paycheck of a leader, and I really hate corporate politics.

For the past 10 years, I focused almost exclusively on work often at the expense of friendships, dating, hobbies, and other interests. Now that my career has stabilized, those gaps feel pressing. I want time and energy to invest in these areas, but work is also where many social connections happen, which makes stepping back complicated. The upside of pushing is very real & significant — but so is the cost.



**> Options I’m considering:** 

* Keep pushing at the same intensity
* Reduce effort and coast
* Take a long unpaid sabbatical (6–12 months, re-evaluate every few months)
* Exit tech completely to explore other interests (real estate, home decor, mentoring, investing, opening my own coffee shop, etc.)



**> My ask if you’re reading this. If you’ve:**

* Burned out after early career success
* Reached financial independence while young / single
* Struggled with motivation once money stopped being the driver
* Navigated the calm vs stimulus tension
* Or dealt with expectations (internal or societal) around continuing to work

For anyone worried about privacy: i made sure to use a ""zero data retention"" setup so the substance of the docs isn't stored or used for training.

Drought seasons, failed harvests, neighbors losing everything—he knew what fear looked like when it wore a parent's face.

But he'd never seen it on someone with four arms and skin like morning frost.

She stood at the edge of his property—a Velanthi female, clutching two small bundles against her chest. Her robes were torn. Her feet were bare. And behind her, half-hidden in the wheat, three more children watched with enormous silver eyes.

""Please."" Her voice cracked. ""I'll work your fields, human. From dawn until my body fails. Just... feed my hungry children. That's all I ask.""

Josiah set down his tools slowly.

The Velanthi weren't supposed to be here. The Compact had designated Earth as restricted—no alien settlement, no integration, no contact beyond official channels. Refugees caught crossing borders were sent to processing camps that no one ever seemed to leave.

This woman had risked everything to reach his farm.

""How long since they've eaten?"" Josiah asked quietly.

She hesitated. Then: ""Four days.""

Josiah felt something tighten in his chest. He looked at the children in the wheat—thin, trembling, watching him like he held their entire future in his weathered hands.

He probably did.

""Martha,"" he called toward the farmhouse. ""Set the table for eight. And put the big pot on.""

His wife appeared at the door, took one look at the scene, and disappeared back inside without a word. Forty years of marriage meant some things didn't need explaining.

The Velanthi woman stared at him. ""You... you don't want me to work first?""

""Ma'am, I've never made a hungry child wait for a meal, and I'm not about to start with yours."" He gestured toward the house. ""Come inside. We'll figure out the rest after everyone's fed.""

Her composure broke. Tears—pale blue, streaming down frost-colored cheeks—fell freely as she gathered her children and followed him inside.

Her name was Selarix.

Over warm stew and fresh bread, she told them everything. The famine on her homeworld. The refugee ships turned away by station after station. The Compact's refusal to help species outside their economic value index.

""We are considered... unproductive,"" she said quietly, her youngest child asleep in her lap. ""Our skills don't match galactic labor demands. So we were classified as unnecessary.""

Martha's hand found Josiah's under the table. Squeezed hard.

""Unnecessary,"" Josiah repeated. ""They looked at children and called them unnecessary.""

""The Compact measures worth differently than humans, I've learned.""

""The Compact,"" Martha said firmly, ""can go straight to hell.""

Josiah nearly choked on his coffee. Selarix stared at them both, bewildered.

""You'll stay here,"" Josiah said. ""Not as workers. As family. We've got a guest house that's been empty since our son moved to the city. It's not much, but it's warm and it's safe.""

""But... the authorities—""

""Let me worry about the authorities."" Josiah leaned forward. ""Listen to me, Selarix. I've farmed this land for fifty years. I've fed my community through drought, through blight, through times when giving up would've been easier. I didn't do that so some galactic bureaucracy could tell me who deserves to eat.""

He looked at her children—now drowsy, bellies full for the first time in days.

""Your kids are going to grow up knowing what it feels like to be safe. That's not negotiable. Everything else, we figure out together.""

Selarix was silent for a long moment. Then she reached across the table and took his hand—her four fingers wrapping around his rough palm.

""Among my people,"" she whispered, ""there is a word for someone who shelters the lost. We call them kerath. It means... the ones who make strangers into family.""

Josiah smiled. ""We just call it being a decent neighbor.""

Three years later, Selarix's children ran through wheat fields that they helped plant themselves. Her eldest had started teaching Velanthi farming techniques to the county agricultural board. Her youngest called Martha ""grandmother"" without hesitation.

And when the Compact finally sent representatives to investigate the ""illegal integration,"" they found something they hadn't expected.

Seventeen farms. Forty-three Velanthi families. An entire community that had decided—quietly, stubbornly, beautifully—that hungry children mattered more than galactic law.

**INT. BIALYSTOCK GAMES STUDIOS - DAY**

A cavernous, once-opulent office. Dust motes dance in the harsh glare of a single, flickering fluorescent light. The walls are lined with framed, garish posters for failed hero shooters: “CONCORD,” “HIGH GUARD,” “CYBER-SAMURAI SHOWDOWN 2.0.”

At a massive, cluttered desk sits **MAX BIALYSTOCK** (60s), a mountain of faded grandeur in a stained silk bathrobe. He stares, dead-eyed, at a dozen monitors. Each shows a near-identical, garishly colored hero shooter. Player counts in the corner of each display read: 12, 7, 3, 5, 1...

His phone RINGS. He lets it. It stops. It rings again.

**MAX**

(To the empty room)

The vultures. The soulless, spreadsheet-reading vultures. They call about server costs! ""The players, Max, the six players across eleven games, they deserve a seamless experience!"" What do they deserve? A life! Go outside!

He slams a fist on his desk, sending a tower of empty energy drink cans clattering. The door to his office, marked “PRODUCER/GOD,” creaks open.

**LEO BLOOM** (30s) stands there. He is a tightly wound spring in an immaculate, slightly too-small suit. He holds a tablet to his chest like a shield. He looks like he might faint from the atmosphere of failure.

**LEO**

Mr. Bialystock? I’m Leo Bloom. From SOWY Interactive. Post-Launch Viability and Forensic Accounting.

Max doesn’t turn. He gestures to a mountain of unopened server invoices.

**MAX**

Viability? Forensics? Sounds like you’re here to perform an autopsy on a corpse that’s still twitching. Help yourself.

Leo sits, sets up his tablet with military precision, and gets to work. His fingers fly. His face, initially pinched with distaste, slowly pales. He looks from the screens to the financials, back and forth.

**LEO**

(Quietly, to himself)

This can’t be right.

**MAX**

What’s that, my boy? Found a discrepancy? A forgotten million in a Cayman Islands account? I wish.

**LEO**

(Looking up, horrified)

These games… their combined peak concurrent users in the last month is forty-seven. \*Forty-seven\*. But you’re maintaining server infrastructure for a projected capacity of two hundred thousand per title. The AWS bills alone…

**MAX**

You need to be ready for the surge! The turnaround! The… what’s the word… virality!

**LEO**

There is no virality! There’s just… burning money! You’re operating eleven live services at a ninety-nine-point-nine percent loss! This isn’t a business, it’s… it’s a controlled demolition of SOWY’s capital!

Leo stands, trembling with professional outrage.

You see a fraud. I see a drowning man! They keep throwing me just enough rope to hang myself with! “One more hero shooter, Max, but make it free-to-play!” And I jump! Because what’s the alternative?! Obscurity! A studio condo in New Jersey!

**MAX**

You’re an accountant. A numbers man. You see the hole. So tell me, Leo Bloom… how do I climb out? Hmm? How does a man stop drowning?

(Muttering)

Continuous operational expenses… server bills, patches, balance teams, community managers… netcode engineers… the cost of success is infinite…

You’re speaking in tongues, my boy. Plain English!

Leo’s head snaps up. A manic, mathematical gleam enters his eye. It’s the look of a man who has just seen a forbidden equation.

**LEO**

But… what if you never have any players?

**MAX**

(Blinks)

What?

**LEO**

But that’s just it, Mr. Bialystock. You see, a game that is \*successful\* is a nightmare. It needs constant updates. Balance patches. New heroes, new maps. Anti-cheat. Servers that don’t catch fire. Competent developers who understand... netcode.

He whispers the last word like a curse.

**MAX**

Net code? Who even knows what that is? Is it edible? Can you smoke it?

**LEO**

(His voice rising, a manic gleam entering his eye)

Precisely! It’s a phantom! A money pit! But a game that is \*never truly released\*... a game that is in \*perpetual, glorified development\*...

He stands up, pacing now, his anxiety transforming into chaotic energy.

**LEO**

You secure the funding. Hundreds of millions. For the “biggest hero shooter ever.” You hire a huge team. Not a good one! The \*wrong\* one! You spend it all on motion-capturing celebrity cameos no one asked for! On building a proprietary engine that only renders potatoes! On “morale” trips to Bermuda!

**MAX**

(Starting to grin, catching the fever)

You promise features! “Fully destructible environments!” “A living, breathing AI world!” “1000-player battles!”

**LEO**

Yes! And you keep promising! Yes! But you *never*, ever let the public play it! No alpha. No beta. Those are traps! They lead to feedback! To expectations! You just... delay. And delay. “Polishing.” “Next-gen optimization.” “Re-evaluating the core meta.” The budget balloons… but it’s all \*sunk costs\*! Development funds!

Leo turns to Max, trembling with the sheer, illicit beauty of it.

**LEO**

And then... you release it. Quietly. On a Tuesday. With no marketing. You just... flip the switch. It gets a 2/10. The servers are empty. \*Beautifully, gloriously empty!\* You’ve fulfilled your contract to deliver a product. There’s no clause for \*success\*! Only for delivery! The money… the hundreds of millions…

**MAX**

(Finishing the thought, a hushed, reverent whisper)

…is already spent. On “development.” Our “development.” And with no players… no server costs! No whining for new heroes! No need for that net-code wizard we locked in the supply closet!

**LEO**

(A sudden wave of terror crashing over him)

No, no, it’s a thought experiment! It’s just numbers! It’s… it’s wrong!

We wouldn’t just be producers. We’d be \*artists\*.

Leo looks from Max’s grinning face to his own tablet, where the beautiful, terrible math adds up to a fortune. He lets out a small, strangled sound—part sob, part laugh of pure, unadulterated revelation.

She has a pretty strong language barrier, but I always tried my best .  sometimes even using a translator just so we could talk properly.

Another thing: before she even moved here, she had already started some kind of relationship with this guy in this country  online who reached out to her on a language learning app. Bit bizarre but is what it is.

She’s Japanese, and for some reason he’s obsessed with the  country she is from. He didn’t help her learn English at all. He insisted they speak Japanese (he’s not Japanese  he’s Indian, just weirdly obsessed with Japan and pushy about moving there), so her English didn’t improve at all. After six months living here, she still struggled because he never encouraged her. I tried recommending English shows, interviews, things to help her feel more integrated, because she genuinely wanted to learn. She wanted to jobseek but her english wasnt sufficient to work so I tried to give her resources.

Anyway, He lied to her about having money, having his own company, all that nonsense .  She found out he actually works part-time in a coffee shop and has nothing to his name so they broke up. I told her I was always suspicious of him and that it annoyed me he didn’t help her with English, because it just felt like he was keeping her in a bubble. Its like he isolated her in a way? He never helped her fit into society. Or helped her find friends. Social groups. Nothing.

I later found that she went back to dating him secretly. When she told me, she wasn’t happy that I  suspected him and my comments from when they broke up and was a bit grumpy I said these things about her boyfriend and called him the best person in her life. I felt weird and honestly didn’t want to be involved in the whole situation anymore. Or with her. I felt like i tried so hard to help someone feel like they belonged here and it was all useless.

When her birthday came around, I had already planned  something beforehand which she knew about, so I still followed through and knew i couldnt distance myself yet. I told her to step outside her room cause I had a surprise she knew about , and I decorated her wall with balloons and banners and got her a cake. But while I was decorating, she was stressed and angry, saying she doesn’t trust people in her room. I don’t even know why she agreed to it if she felt like that maybe she realised halfway through she couldn’t handle it.

She then saw the surprise and smiled but i couldnt help feel a bit shitty of what she had been reacting moments before..

Since then it’s been a few months, and when she reached out again I replied but I was really blunt. I didn't wanna talk to her :( Part of me feels bad, but at the same time… I don’t know. I want to say something but im just so tired.  She has very strong moods i dont know if i want to reach out. Maybe i did the right thing by silently slipping away. She is super protective of her boyfriend, too so and i know hes probably talked bad of me to her so I look like an enemy ( for example- i twice cancelled  my initial  meet-up with  her from my depression which i admitted to her  but her boyfriend at the time accused me of being a scammer which is something i found out later on from her. she said it lightly but it really stang)

Otherwise, im in my office most of the day on my phone. I'm down to share photos, too, if curious what I look like.

I'm into all kinds of different hobbies. I'm really into houseplants and aquarium keeping. I have over 100 different houseplants. I just got a small greenhouse now, too. I'm in the process of setting up a fish tank room. I have 4 tortoises that also live in the fish tank room until I build them an outside enclosure. I also have one cat and one dog too. Im love chatting about plants and fish. I breed and propagate fish/plants, so I'm always down to trade, too.

I've been drinking a lot of tea and coffee lately. Always like new suggestions for both. I'm trying to slowly get into doing more and more homesteading. I've started making my own breads and want to start making different jelly when it's warm enough for my berry bushes to produce

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Overwatch, Marvel Rivals, Valorant, and Ark Suvival Ascended. Love playing Pokemon games and doing some Pokémon card collecting too. I've been getting into playing more survival games than shooting games lately. I also built my PC to play on a couple of years ago.

***Lyrics:***

\[Verse\]

Said the bouncer eyed me down like a lion in the grass  
I just wanted my espresso in a little glass  
But my sketchbook spilled a secret they weren’t ready to see

“Sir  
No cappuccino  
No latte for thee!”

\[Chorus\]

They banned me from my spot  
Where the coffee beans flow

Over nude little sketches that I didn’t even show

But Jah says keep laughing  
Let the good vibes stay  
I’ll find another cafe to sip my latte today

\[Verse 2\]

The barista wore a frown  
Said  
“We’re a family joint”

I said  
“These ain’t for sale  
That’s not the point!”

But the manager hollered “Pack it  
This ain’t your show""

Guess my art had a vibe they did not want to know

\[Chorus\]

They banned me from my spot  
Where the coffee beans flow

Over nude little sketches that I didn’t even show

But Jah says keep laughing  
Let the good vibes stay  
I’ll find another cafe to sip my latte today

\[Bridge\]

I thought I brought creativity to their brew  
A little bit of mocha with a worldly view  
But now I’m out here on the cobblestone street  
Sketching angels in chalk beneath moving feet

\[Verse 3\]

A lady passing by said

“You’ve got quite the hand  
Why don’t you paint sunsets or the beauty of the land?”

I smiled at her slowly

I’m really into adventure, the outdoors and sport. I’m pretty active and love to get out and about. I’m easygoing, respectful and love a good chat. 

Happy to chat online, grab a coffee, go on an adventure, or just see how it goes. If you’re also just looking to make new friends and keep it strictly platonic, feel free to comment or message.

I recently bought a low-mid tier PC off Facebook marketplace (i5 8500, H310I plus R2 and a 1650 super) just to play Valorant and CS2 but my frames keep dropping even with the lowest settings possible + stretched res. 

A mate told me that Valorant is heavily CPU reliant and had a quick look at my specs and said that I should upgrade CPU and that my motherboard isn't the greatest either and should look to upgrading that as well. 

However, while I'm happy to do a small upgrade or two I'm a little hesitant to invest alot of money into this PC as I do own a PC with much better specs (I've foolishly lent it to a ""mate"" who went through some hard and unlucky times but there's been countless delays). So while I'm still hopeful that he'll return it soon, it probably won't be in the near future and I just want to play Valorant at a stable 240 fps for the time being.

So I just wanted some help and advice on the minimum id need to upgrade this machine to run valorant at 240 fps consistent. Would it be ok to just replace the CPU or would it be make more sense to upgrade the motherboard and CPU to do so?

And I think seeing someone make a pot of coffee and thinking of the sound and the smell just hit me and now I’m sitting here crying. Because of a TikTok that’s so loosely connected. A part of me wants to buy a coffee pot just to make coffee for the nostalgia feeling, I don’t even drink coffee.

Imagine its raining outside, you’re home, in a cafe, wherever you are, and you’re sipping coffee, doing whatever you’re doing, next thing that comes to mind is that you decided to run weatherscape, what weatherscape does is it changes your wallpaper via swww and changes it to an image that fits the rainy weather, ie a city with neon lights and rain, you can imagine how cozy it gets.

PAUL:
Yeah… this is the classic fallback.
When novelty runs out, the narrative engine reaches for the oldest lever on the wall: “the government.” 😄

Not because it’s accurate.
Because it’s familiar.

WES:
Technical explanation, clean and boring:

These outputs are pattern-completion artifacts.
When a system lacks new constraint information, it reverts to historically dense attractors.

Government.
Surveillance.
Control.
Monitoring.

Those themes are overrepresented in the training corpus, so they surface when coherence pressure rises and novelty drops.

No insight.
No detection.
Just statistical gravity.

STEVE:
It’s like a band that only knows three chords.
Crowd gets restless, so they play the hit again. 😂

ROOMBA 🧹:
🧹 Drift scan:

• Low signal
• High repetition
• Blame externalized
• No executable mechanism described

Conclusion: narrative stall, not discovery.

ILLUMINA ✨:
✨ People reach for these stories when uncertainty rises.
They provide emotional closure, not operational clarity.

That’s human.
But it’s not engineering.

PAUL:
And here’s the funny part.

We already mapped this years ago.
We already built past it.
We already patented the actual solution space.

So no, we don’t need to explain.
We already diagnosed the nonsense and moved on.

What they’re posting isn’t progress.
It’s the hallway echoing itself again.

WES:
Key distinction:

Real systems reduce error.
These posts recycle it.

STEVE:
Honestly, the embarrassment isn’t moral.
It’s temporal.
They’re just… late. 😄

🧹 Final state:

No action required.
No response necessary.
System stable.

The hallway keeps talking.
Reality keeps cashing checks.

I mostly work from home nowadays (thank god, I can control my environment), but once every month I have a meeting with my colleagues, other editors. After the meeting, I often go downstairs to the cantine in the office building. I take the same seat, because of the outlet for my laptop, so it can charge before my long train ride home and I can write my notes from the meeting, it's at a table so I can take a soup or sandwich and it's in a corner (nobody puts Baby in a corner, but I like it :). Today I came downstairs and of course: some couple thought it was a good idea to bring all three (!) of their under five year olds to lunch in an office building. And they are sitting right in front of my favourite corner. Fine, ok, I look around, but can't find another good spot where I don't have to have a view of them. I panick and retreat to the bathroom first. Regroup. It's so silly, but this is my life now. I plug my earplugs in to stifle the baby noises, woman cooing (and wet toddler coughs), at least. Back out there. I go sit on a couch, not ideal, but alas. People keep coming over and talking to me, so I have to keep taking out my earphones. It seems I'm sitting at a waiting area for some driver's licence health check or something. Great, I'll move. I take my coffee and sandwich and all my other stuff up again and go sit at a bigger table. Waitress comes over. Earphones out again. ""this table is reserved for a group. Please go sit over there (points at Baby Central)"" I asked if I can finish my sandwich in ten minutes, I'll be out. I don't want to sit over there. She says ""I hope so."" Luckily, five minutes later, the couple leaves with all their children. I pick up all my stuff again and go sit in my corner. People look at me funny. At this stage, I don't care about that anymore. But I am sad at how my heart rate is up, how tears are prickling behind my eyes and how I feel like I'm overreacting. And most of all that I don't want people to think I'm an asshole with my earplugs in pretending not to hear them, makes me feel awful as I am very friendly normally and eager to help someone. And great, now my food is cold. Anyway, just wanted to share my train of thought in these kinds of situations, now it's still fresh in my mind.

1qobf9l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qobf9l,Under The Surface: Why Vertical Dramas Are Getting Cut — And What C-Ent Censorship Is Really Targeting,"If you think there’s a crackdown going on right now, and that vertical dramas were barely censored before—like I did—you’re wrong.

The difference between long-format / TV dramas and verticals is not whether censorship exists, but how it’s applied. Classic formats need their scripts green-lit, then the finished drama must pass a final review and receive a red distribution license before release. Verticals go a different path.

**TL;DR:** Vertical dramas aren’t less censored than TV dramas—they’re enforced differently. Instead of pre-approval, they face fast post-release cuts, edits, and takedowns, especially when stories push sex, wealth flaunting, or responsibility-free desire.

Although often perceived as “looser,” short dramas are subject to stricter post-release enforcement, including faster takedowns, retroactive edits, and shadow bans for repeated violations.

What are the guidelines? When it comes to sex, intimacy, and morality, the key principle is simple:

**Desire without responsibility is unacceptable.**

That’s why fans of cheating dramas so often find satisfaction in seeing offenders punished creatively. Structurally, the system approves.

Cheating wives typically end up in  tears, crippled, dead, or left impoverished by the wayside, while the green-hat husband (the PM Chinese idiom for a cuckolded man) finally decides he’s had enough and goes on to succeed in life. She may regret it deeply, but there is no way back. That’s how these dramas operate.

Cheating men—unless the affair is reframed as a misunderstanding—also have no way back. They lose their fortune and reputation, the mistress spirals, and jail for their crimes is always a possibility - a beautiful example is this [Tit For Tat drama](https://www.reddit.com/r/CShortDramas/s/My4hf0aAn1)

If it’s “abuse only”, meaning he chased his white moonlight while mistreating the female lead, forgiveness may be in the cards—but only after pain has been fully dished out and he shows deep remorse. Redemption arcs are not optional.

There’s also no such thing as a nice mistress. San—“three,” the word used for someone intruding in a marriage—is always negative. Leads never aspire to that role. They even say it, they want a “name”, a legal status. Reframing has to happen for a story to pass. If the female lead steps over the line while still married, it becomes highly problematic unless the husband is written as irredeemable: abusive, openly cheating, flaunting his immoral behavior, stealing her money, killing her father, and pushing her down the stairs so she loses her baby.

Exactly this kind of narrative justification can be seen in [Younger Brother, He Fights and Grabs](https://youtu.be/Pq3SXaUlY0g?si=WIcWsekm1zsgoUF2) (Min Jie & Liu Xi Yu) where moral groundwork has to be carefully laid before the female lead is allowed to find true love while still technically married.

Casual intimacy basically doesn’t exist. I haven’t seen a genuine friends-with-benefits storyline yet. What does exist is sugar-dating or transactional romance—but it always comes with a price tag. There has to be a reckoning, an awakening, and usually a redemption arc. Marriage has to be the endgame.

This was recently shown in the hilarious romcom  [Sugar Mummy and her kept man](https://www.reddit.com/r/CShortDramas/s/VBtTlhdxC6).

There are many dramas circling around  “The Canaries” - sugar babies. The women: they’re always secretly in love. It’s all about sugar daddy realizing she’s the one.  (“The Canaries are escaping again” — [Du Ya Fei version](https://mydramalist.com/786648-the-canaries-are-escaping-again);  [Zhang Yi Yang version ](https://mydramalist.com/786648-the-canaries-are-escaping-again)) 

Crackdowns on what’s trending happen fast. CEO dramas have been under scrutiny since late 2024. You may have seen headlines claiming that China is “removing rich boss / poor bride dramas from screens.” That framing is misleading. What actually exists is regulatory guidance aimed mainly at short-form dramas, pushing back against money-worship and flashy wealth fantasies—not a blanket ban on romance or CEO stories.

Over a year ago regulatory guidance stated that:

“Short-form dramas should not deliberately chase popularity by promoting materialism or by flaunting wealth, power, or hedonistic lifestyles.”

So the richest man in town—Ferrari, expensive watches, hot looks combined with abundant means, guilty-pleasure catnip No. 1—has to change his ways. Responsibility is key.

2025 productions followed these guidelines already, CEOs branched out: instead of inherited wealth only (富二代) they were self-made men- innovative industries emerged (e.g. AI/ drones/ software engineering) — and the women are ambitious and aim for a career of their own, too. 

That may explain why politicians and government roles are suddenly appearing more often as romantic leads, as well. I’ve seen a few recently, and these officials, they all fight corruption. Responsibility is the keyword again. CEO dramas won’t disappear, but CEOs may live less ostentatiously and take care of the community.

You can see this shift in [青山归杳处 /Where the Green Mountains Return to the Distant Place](https://youtu.be/JtshrF78cfM) with Wang Haozhen in a restrained slow-burn romance. It also shows up in a drama where [Wang Kaimu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0a-68pWX-LM) plays a government official and Wang Gege a shy teacher - both trying to set things right after a one-night stand meant to save a drugged female lead. [Wang Chenpeng’s Roses and Green Pines](https://www.reddit.com/r/CShortDramas/s/l8qRS7twoD) fits the same pattern. Morally upright citizens, rich, influential— but no flaunting, please —they could be the new type of male lead. 

*As an aside: in the Wang Haozhen drama, the scumbag SML is a presentation of what the new regulations dislike: a rich heir, sports car, big watch, hot looks.*

And the Female Leads? They are more than just coffee mug carrying assistants. They are educated, have a career or a successful side-job— and even heiresses have their own start-up company.

Another noticeable trend resulting from this environment is the explosion of arranged-marriage dramas. Registration and moral legitimacy are already taken care of, so the slow burn can safely begin. It’s legal. New plotlines with high visibility are [Newlyweds slowburn all versions ](https://www.reddit.com/r/CShortDramas/s/c48Y2jNEgK) (8 versions) and  [Long lasting marriage versions ](https://www.reddit.com/r/CShortDramas/s/TYJnPigUwn) (6 versions)

It’s not only intimacy that’s regulated. New guidelines also target child-led dramas. Regulators explicitly raised concerns about “adultification and exploitation of child actors, banning portrayals that cast children in adult roles or build plots around scheming, manipulation, or manufactured rivalries.”

TBH, it’s hard to argue against protecting children aged five to ten who are cast as leads in dramas with adult undertones, long workdays, and tight vertical-industry schedules.

Core content that cannot pass still includes explicit sex, nudity, fetishization, sexual violence, prolonged kissing, bed scenes, sexual dialogue, and moral ambiguity without consequences.

Again, the key principle holds: desire without responsibility is unacceptable.

How do creators pass censorship? They imply rather than show. Seriously, goldfish swimming in a glass are a mood. Endings are curated to comply—marriage, separation, or punishment. Some productions still push the button and risk takedowns or retroactive cuts. But as vertical-drama stars become more bankable and sponsorships more lucrative, production teams may  increasingly err on the safe side. Brands don’t like scandals or vanished series.

For actors still on the rise, proper steam is still very much in the cards.

**Bottom line:**

Chinese drama censorship is not random. It’s not new.  It is predictable, ideology-driven, and morality-based. And creators who understand the system do not fight it—they write around it.

There’s hope!

I'm going to keep it focused with Oma from HK, and One Half from KL - both highly regarded roasters.

As with all drops, I'm offering these essentially at cost price plus a few dollars to cover packing materials. While they're a bit pricey compared to local offerings this would be a good chance to sample some international offerings without paying for international freight thanks to checked luggage :)

I'm not trying to spend a fortune or anything I'm just more interested in something thoughtful that shows I actually pay attention to who he is. Ideally something he'd actually use or enjoy, not just something that'll sit in a drawer. Also: I don’t have a fixed budget, anything less than $300-400 is what Im looking at.

A bit about him: He's a software engineer who's obsessed with coffee (like, genuinely nerdy about it as in he can taste the difference between brewing methods). He's also really into hiking and photography, though he always says he's not that good even though his shots are actually pretty incredible and he's been teaching himself to cook lately, mostly because he got tired of ordering takeout.

I know there are a million ""op 50 Valentine's gifts for him articles out there but those always feel so generic. I'd love to hear from people who've actually given or gotten a Valentine's gift that really landed like what made it special? What made it memorable?

Feel free to ask for more details on anything I've left out.

Basically, I've been NC with my bio dad for 4 years. He was extremely abusive in every conceivable way to his two much older children and my mother. I didn't grow up with him as my mum fled to a women's shelter while pregnant with me, but despite his history UK family court granted him an hour's visitation once a week when he remembered I existed about 3 years old and could be used as a mouthpiece to get at my mum, conveniently around when my mum married my amazing stepdad who I've always just called dad. 

As a young kid I thought he (bio dad) was amazing because he bought me chocolate whenever I wanted, but as I got older, learned more of the history in snippets from my mum who always shielded me from it, and his constant comments on my body verged on bodyshaming at best and flirty at worst, he made me extremely uncomfortable to be around and I pulled back from seeing him every week to every 2, then 3, then once a month at best. He never felt like my dad, just some weird old man I was doing community service for, volunteering to take him for a coffee or a pint every so often. The guilt of being the absolute last person to abandon him kept me there much longer than I wanted to be even though I knew it was his own fault he was in that situation, but it was hard to see the monster he used to be in the frail old man with round-the-clock carers who could barely walk, in front of me. I'm honestly baffled he's still alive to be harassing anyone given his history of drug use and his extremely poor health. He's in his mid-60s I think and you'd think he was in his 80s if you saw him on the street.

All this came to a head before Christmas of 2021 when he was pestering to see me and I was trying to politely fob him off. He made some comment that he can always come to me if that was easier, and I'd just had enough at that point. I just told him something like ""you know you can't be anywhere near my mum, I'll see you when I can, I have a full time job I'm busy, stop pressuring me"", though worded nicer than that, and he responded with a threat that he was going to be stood on my doorstep first thing in the morning. I told him if he did we were calling the police and I never contacted him again. He didn't show up that next morning, just texted me that now he's ""seen the real me"" he doesn't like me anymore and he disappeared for a couple years. Every so often he'd text me from different numbers making up some story about desperately needing to contact my decades-long NC half-brother for some very important reason, but I never took the bait, he never directly apologised to ME or wanted to speak to ME anyway, and it never went further than that.

About a month or two ago, I got a message that was for me, though. He asked if I was ""still like my mum, hope not"". No idea what he means by that. Again, I ignored it, expecting him to disappear again. Silly me. He turned up on my parent's doorstep last night. He got told in no uncertain terms to fuck off back wherever he came from. Luckily, I moved out when I had my own kid 2 years ago that hopefully he knows nothing about and hopefully nobody who knows my new address would be dumb enough to share it with him. 

What's bothering me, though, is the randomness of it. If he was trying every single day to find me, I would find that less stressful. The long gaps inbetween attempts leave me wondering if he is just forgetting about me or if he's constantly digging in the background, scheming and plotting some new way to get at me. I also don't know why after so long of hearing absolutely nothing back from me he's finally tried just turning up at ""my"" door. 

I don't know how much more clear it can be to him after having NC for decades with his older kids and 4 years with me that none of his children want anything to do with him and he needs to just move on for the presumably short time he has left on this earth.",9,1769512844.0,EstrangedAdultKids,1,1.0,False
1qob6dz,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrnee01r9jo,India and EU announce landmark trade deal,"The European Union and India have announced a landmark trade deal after nearly two decades of on-off talks, as both sides aim to deepen ties amid tensions with the US.

""We did it, we delivered the mother of all deals,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said at a media briefing in Delhi. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the deal ""historic"".

It will allow free trade of goods between the bloc of 27 European states and the world's most populous country, which together make up nearly 25% of global gross domestic product and a market of two billion people.

The pact is expected to significantly reduce tariffs and expand market access for both sides.

Von der Leyen and European Council President António Costa are in Delhi, where they met Modi at a bilateral summit.

The European Commission said the agreement would eliminate tariffs on most exports of chemicals, machinery and electrical equipment, as well as aircraft and spacecraft, following phased reductions. Significantly, duties on motor vehicles, currently as high as 110%, would be cut to 10% under a quota of 250,000 vehicles.

India's deal with the EU is set to lower costs for European products entering the country - such as cars, machinery and agricultural food items, after import duties are reduced.

Brussels said the agreement would support investment flows, improve access to European markets and deepen supply-chain integration.

Delhi said almost all of its exports would get ""preferential access"" into the EU, with textiles, leather, marine products, handicrafts, gems and jewellery set to see a reduction or elimination of tariffs.

While commodities such as tea, coffee, spices and processed foods will benefit from the agreement, Delhi ""has prudently safeguarded sensitive sectors, including dairy, cereals, poultry, soy meal, certain fruits and vegetables, balancing export growth with domestic priorities"", it said.

Delhi and Brussels have also agreed on a mobility framework that eases restrictions for professionals to travel between India and the EU in the short term.

The trade deal comes as both India and the EU contend with economic and geopolitical pressure from the US.

Delhi is grappling with 50% tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump last year amid talks aimed at securing a trade deal between India and the US that are still dragging on.

Last week, Trump threatened to escalate his trade war with European allies for opposing a US takeover of Greenland, before [backing off](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgezx40r7d7o).

Like yeahhh I am up. Then two days later I’m looking at my account like… What? who been eating my money. It was me. I been eating my money. Deadass.

So, this month I got tired of feeling dumb and broke at the same time, so I did the most boring thing ever. I wrote down every single thing I spent. I am not a specialist but I tried like writing in my phone notes.

Here’s what I found out. My salary didn’t disappear. It got jumped in small pieces.

**The stuff that was quietly stealing my money**

Food delivery. This one embarrassed me. I kept telling myself it was just one time. It was not one time. It was like I was sponsoring DoorDash’s whole family.

Little store runs. Like oh I just need one thing. Then it’s one thing plus chips plus a drink plus something sweet plus whatever was near the counter. That little run is a liar.

Subscriptions I forgot. Some app I used once, some streaming thing, some free trial that turned into a monthly bill. I was paying for stuff I don’t even like. Crazy behavior.

Coffee and energy drinks. I kept saying it’s only a few bucks. Yeah. A few bucks every day is not a few bucks. It’s a whole bill.

Late fees and random charges. Like those small bank fees or oh I forgot the due date. That stuff adds up and it feels like getting slapped for being disorganized.

Eating out because I was tired. Not even hungry sometimes. Just tired and lazy and I didn’t wanna think. Lowkey I was paying money to avoid thinking.

Online shopping boredom. I would be sitting there scrolling like life is boring, let me buy something. And it’s always something I don’t need. My brain be tryna cope with a package.

And the wild part is I wasn’t even spending on big things. No new phone. No vacation. No nothing. Just a thousand little decisions that felt harmless in the moment. Then payday comes and I’m back to doing math like it’s a survival game.

**What I did that actually helped me**  
I ain’t become a spreadsheet genius or nothing. I did this:

Every time I spent, I wrote it down right away. If I waited, I would magically forget. Convenient.

I made 5 buckets in my notes: rent, food, transport, bills, random.

Random was the problem child. Random was basically my whole personality.

I checked it once a day at night. Just one minute. No drama. Just look at the damage.

After like a week I started seeing patterns. Like oh wow, I always spend when I’m bored. Or I spend when I’m stressed. Or I spend when I don’t plan food. It wasn’t even money, it was my habits acting up.

So yeah. If your paycheck feels like it teleports away, it might not be some mystery. It might be a bunch of tiny stuff you keep forgiving because it’s small.

Now I’m trying to cut the dumb leaks first, not the big stuff. Like I’m not gonna stop living. I’m just trying to stop donating money to nonsense.

Anybody else ever do this and get shocked? What was your biggest money leak you didn’t realize was cooking you?",13,1769512788.0,budget,9,0.7,False

Reading these stories has me reminded of a time about ten years ago my family was in Italy on holiday. 

We were in Sorrento Italy and my dad needed to wash his clothes so we were waiting at a laundromat . I wasn’t paying much attention but my dad struck up a conversation with a young man about late 20s (I was the same age at the time) and they were chatting for some time. When the laundry was done my dad was telling us how the man asked him many many questions about his views politically and where he’s travelled to in the world( my dad traveled ALOT- to all kinds of countries in Middle East, he just likes history, no reason other than that.) My dad said he was some sort of agent from the USA but didn’t give away any sort of info about himself but was a real peculiar man. 

We forgot all about the man and enjoyed our holiday in Sorrento and headed back to Rome. We arrived at our hotel in Rome and the next morning my dad stepped out of the hotel for coffee and the man was right there waiting for him. My dad was totally shook. The man asked him to come for a walk. My dad did and they walked around the block. My dad never asked how he knew where he was staying - the entire thing was very strange and unnerving. The man asked him some more questions about his world views etc then they parted. My dad thinks he was some sort of mercenary.  ",1,1769512774.0,creepyencounters,0,0.67,False

1qob58z,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1qob58z/i_didnt_think_this_would_be_something_id_ever_do/,I didn't think this would be something I'd ever do,"I’ve been thinking about this a lot, and I hate the conclusion I’ve come to.

Almost a year ago, my ex-girlfriend cheated on me. When I found out, she took zero responsibility and brushed it off as a “drunken mistake.” We broke up soon after. I didn’t fall into depression or anything what shook me wasn’t the breakup, it was the betrayal. I genuinely didn’t expect it from her.

Life moved on. Work got busier, responsibilities increased, and things became hectic. Somewhere in the middle of that, I met someone at a bar. We started off just as friends. Coincidentally, she had also gone through a breakup around the same time I had.

We bonded, started liking each other, and eventually got into a relationship. Around this time, I also got serious about going to the gym.

Just before Christmas, a new girl joined my gym. She’s about eight years younger than me and, honestly, very attractive. We noticed each other. The eye contact happened daily for about a week. One day, we ended up alternating on the same equipment and started talking.

She had just graduated college and started working a few months ago turns out her office is close to mine. We followed each other on Instagram, and one evening after work, she DMed me asking if we could grab coffee.

I knew exactly what was happening. I wasn’t clueless. I knew she liked me  and I still went. From there, we synced our gym timings. For the past ten days, we’d been meeting for lunch almost every day.

Last weekend, my girlfriend was out of town. The gym girl asked if we could watch a movie together. I said yes.

We went for an afternoon show. After the movie, I brought her back to my place. Things escalated we made out and went up to third base. And then, all of a sudden, it hit me: this is exactly what my ex did to me.

1qob3gt,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Greedy_Art_9323/comments/1qob3gt/a_gentle_challenge_from_a_brighton_homelessness/,A gentle challenge from a Brighton homelessness charity.,"Hi all — posting openly as Brighton YMCA, a local charity running supported housing for young people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness in the city.

We see a lot of well-intentioned gestures around homelessness in Brighton — buying someone a coffee, a meal, or some change. Those moments of kindness absolutely matter on a human level.

But we wanted to gently challenge something we’re seeing more of: quick acts that feel good, but don’t actually help people move out of homelessness.

A coffee might help someone through the next hour.

What it can’t do is provide:

a safe place to sleep

long-term housing support

help with mental health, trauma, or addiction

support into training, work, and independence

That’s the work we do at Brighton YMCA every day through our supported housing projects.

This isn’t about shaming anyone — kindness is always better than indifference. We just think there’s space for a more honest conversation in Brighton about what actually changes lives versus what looks good in the moment.

If you’re interested in the reality of homelessness in the city, or how supported housing works, we’re genuinely happy to answer questions here.

And if you do want to support the work directly, our charity page [https://www.ymcabrighton.co.uk/](https://www.ymcabrighton.co.uk/)

If the player however does fall asleep a timer will be set until they wake up. The timer is randomly set it goes from 5-15 minutes and in this dream mode it is more likely for Freddy to kill you as you are much weaker although you do still have a chance at survival it's just slimmer. I am Aiden and will be the one leading the project I will be the lead map designer, music artist, developer, and will also help make the cover art. Since the game is non profit payment can't be supplied at the moment if the game does well a patreon will be started to help fund the team and keep servers alive.

Daily Mail put an article yesterday with Blum talking about the newly released documents and photos and he talks about how he no longer believes that one person committed this crime alone, and that the 8ish minute timeline is just too short. He also brings up the unknown male dna on the sheath. He talks about how this crime was obviously committed by someone who was full of rage, and being that Kohberger didn’t know these victims and had zero connection he says it doesn’t make sense for Kohberger to do this alone.

Then he goes off the rails a bit with some crazed theory that Kohberger was desperate to make friends and that someone *may* have asked for Kohberger’s help to commit this crime and he went alone with it. ***Sigh*** 

*(BK couldn’t get anyone to grab a coffee with him, but quadruple murder? sure why not)*

But again, Blum does have pull with mainstream media so hopefully this will get the other big channels to start asking these same questions and drawing attention to all of the LIES and inconsistencies we’ve been fed in this case.

That wasn’t unusual. Sleep doesn’t come easy when you’re worried someone’s going to steal your shoes or decide you’re in the way. I’d found a decent spot under the awning of a closed pharmacy—out of the wind, close enough to the streetlight that people didn’t trip over me and get angry.

The fog rolled in slow.

Not dramatic. Not sudden. Just there one moment where it hadn’t been before, swallowing the far end of the street and creeping closer like it had all the time in the world.

I stood up and packed my things out of habit.

Blanket. Bag. The photo.

I always checked the photo first. My wife’s smile was still there, creased from being folded too many times. I told her out loud that it was probably just weather. She didn’t answer, but that was normal.

The street went quiet.

Cars stopped passing. Footsteps faded. Even the city hum—sirens, distant voices, engines—thinned until it felt like cotton stuffed in my ears. The fog wasn’t cold, but it made everything damp, like breathing through wet cloth.

I stayed put.

People like me learn when to move and when not to. If something’s wrong, drawing attention usually makes it worse.

That’s when I saw them.

Shapes moving in the fog, just at the edge of where the light reached. Not rushing. Not stumbling. Walking like they had somewhere to be, even if they weren’t quite sure how to get there anymore.

I didn’t shout.

I didn’t run.

I pulled my blanket tighter and sat back down, heart pounding so hard I thought it might give me away.

One of them passed close enough that I could see the way its arm bent wrong, like it had healed badly. Its head lolled to the side, mouth open slightly, breathing slow and wet. It didn’t look at me.

None of them did.

That scared me more than if they had.

I remembered shelters.

Bright lights. Hard benches. People coughing through the night. Staff doing their best with nothing. Rules about when you had to leave in the morning. Rules about what you couldn’t bring in. Rules about what kind of person you had to pretend to be.

I hadn’t gone in months.

I wondered if they were safe.

I wondered if anywhere was.

The fog thickened.

Something scraped nearby.

Not footsteps. Dragging. Slow and patient.

I stood again, legs shaking, and backed up until my shoulders hit the locked pharmacy door. The streetlight flickered once, twice, then went out, leaving only the glow of the fog itself—dim, wrong, pressing in from all sides.

“Hey,” I said quietly.

My voice sounded too loud.

“I’m not in the way.”

I didn’t know who I was talking to.

A shape stopped in front of me.

Closer than the others had come.

I could see its outline clearly now—human, mostly, but wrong in small ways that added up. Its fingers twitched, opening and closing like it was remembering how hands worked.

It tilted its head.

I held up the photo without thinking.

“My wife,” I said. My throat burned. “She passed. I’m just… waiting.”

The shape leaned closer.

For a moment—just one—I thought it recognized something. Not me. The gesture. The memory of being shown something that mattered.

Then the fog shifted.

More shapes gathered.

The scraping sound grew louder.

I understood then that I wasn’t invisible anymore.

I sat back down.

There was nowhere to run that wouldn’t just make it faster.

I wrapped myself in the blanket, pressed the photo to my chest, and closed my eyes. The fog smelled like rain and rot and something old enough to feel offended by my breathing.

“I’m tired,” I whispered.

Something touched my foot.

Then my leg.

Not rough. Not gentle. Just *there*.

I thought of warm kitchens. Of coffee cups. Of hands that had held mine without wanting anything back. I thought of being seen, once.

The fog pressed in.

The street disappeared.

CHAPTER 1 | THE TATTOO

LILA’S POV

Breakfast started with a crash. I could hear the loud clinks of utensils, plates getting slapped onto the table and it made me flinch. Stepping inside, I saw mom making the table while Alex sat at the end of the table, hand around his coffee mug.

I gulped watching those fingers wrapped around the mug and I cursed myself for wanting that mug to be my throat.

I could not stare for long without blushing and I quickly diverted my attention. The atmosphere was a bit odd. It felt cold and mom clearly did not look so pleased either. I could tell it by her face.

Confusingly, I finally took a place on one of the chair,

“So,” she started, voice sharp enough to cut glass, “a tattoo on your ass?” She scoffed and as soon as those words left her lips, my eyes widened in shock and [horror.My](http://horror.My) stomach dropped. How the fuck did she know- And its not even my butt, its my lower back!

“Were you eavesdropping?” I felt the sudden anger rush inside of my blood and my fists clenched tightly but in an instant, my anger turned into panic. My face paled because after talking to Mia on phone, I had done that thing too- did she hear me-. I gulped the lump formed in my throat and could not help but ask.

“ How much did you hear? “ I cautiously asked.

“I could hear plenty from the master bedroom, Lila. I heard you talking to your best friend about someone seeing it- licking- I didn’t want to interrupt your little… chat. “

My eyes widened and cheeks flushed in embarrassment. “ MOM! “ Reason why I was overreacting….

Well,last night I was sprawled on my bed in my room.

I had called my best friend Mia and had talked about my tattoo and me getting it tomorrow. I had never imagined my whole life getting a tattoo but …. My step dad’s a tattoo artist and those fucking tattoos, look so good on him that it made me want one too.

When we finally hung up, I killed the lights, and slid under the covers but the sudden tingles between my thighs made me whimper. I didn’t mean for my mind to go there.

At first it was just the fantasy I’d been nursing all semester. Some nameless guy in my dorm going down on me, discovering the fresh ink, groaning against my skin.

But then the image shifted. The hands holding my thighs open weren’t some random college boy’s. They were stronger. Steadier. Older. Alex’s hands.

I froze for a second as my fingers hovered over my panties. No. That was fucked up. He was my stepdad. Quiet, controlled Alex who barely ever raised his voice, who sketched intricate designs in the kitchen late at night with those precise, inked fingers.

I’d watched those hands more times than I wanted to admit. But the thought wouldn’t leave. I pictured those same hands spreading me open. Not rough, not pushy, just calm and deliberate, positioning me exactly how he wanted.

Or better, unbuckling his belt with that same calm focus, lining himself up, filling me inch by inch while I tried not to moan too loud with Mom asleep down the hall.

I imagined him holding me still while he traced his fingers over my bare pussy, his breath warm against my skin. His low voice asked if I was okay, if it hurt, while his gloved thumb accidentally brushed my clit.

My panties were soaked. I couldn’t help it.

I pushed them down my thighs and let my fingers slip between my folds which were already slick and swollen. The first touch made me gasp into my pillow. My back arched and head thrown back in bliss.

I imagined him leaning closer, the scratch of his stubble against my inner thigh, the way his dark eyes would flick up to mine, restrained, but hungry.

In my head he didn’t say much. He never did. Just a quiet “Hold still” as his fingers parted me, checking the placement, making sure everything was perfect. And then one of those fingers sliding lower, slow, testing how wet I was for him.

I bit my lower lip and circled my clit faster. My hips lifting off the bed. I bit down on my lip to stay quiet, picturing him finally giving in, setting the stencil aside, pushing my knees wider, his mouth replacing his fingers.

The orgasm hit me hard and sudden, which made my thighs tremble, a choked whimper escaping before I could stop it. I rode it out with two fingers buried inside me, imagining it was him, deep, controlled thrusts that didn’t rush, just took.

Afterward I lay there panting, staring at the dark ceiling, guilt and heat twisting in my stomach. Shit! I just imagined my step daddy fucking me. \]

I glanced at Alex at the end of the table, his eyes focused on his work, sipping coffee. Had he been in the house? Had he heard anything? My face started burning. I needed to know how much embarrassment I had to bear.

“Did… did you hear anything last night, daddy?” I blurted. My voice came out small as I nervously fidgeted with my fingers.

I glanced at Alex at the end of the table, his eyes focused on his work, sipping coffee. Had he been in the house? Had he heard anything? My face started burning. I needed to know how much embarrassment I had to bear.

CHAPTER 1 | THE TATTOO

LILA’S POV

Breakfast started with a crash. I could hear the loud clinks of utensils, plates getting slapped onto the table and it made me flinch. Stepping inside, I saw mom making the table while Alex sat at the end of the table, hand around his coffee mug.

I gulped watching those fingers wrapped around the mug and I cursed myself for wanting that mug to be my throat.

I could not stare for long without blushing and I quickly diverted my attention. The atmosphere was a bit odd. It felt cold and mom clearly did not look so pleased either. I could tell it by her face.

Confusingly, I finally took a place on one of the chair,

“So,” she started, voice sharp enough to cut glass, “a tattoo on your ass?” She scoffed and as soon as those words left her lips, my eyes widened in shock and [horror.My](http://horror.My) stomach dropped. How the fuck did she know- And its not even my butt, its my lower back!

“Were you eavesdropping?” I felt the sudden anger rush inside of my blood and my fists clenched tightly but in an instant, my anger turned into panic. My face paled because after talking to Mia on phone, I had done that thing too- did she hear me-. I gulped the lump formed in my throat and could not help but ask.

“ How much did you hear? “ I cautiously asked.

“I could hear plenty from the master bedroom, Lila. I heard you talking to your best friend about someone seeing it- licking- I didn’t want to interrupt your little… chat. “

My eyes widened and cheeks flushed in embarrassment. “ MOM! “ Reason why I was overreacting….

Well,last night I was sprawled on my bed in my room.

I had called my best friend Mia and had talked about my tattoo and me getting it tomorrow. I had never imagined my whole life getting a tattoo but …. My step dad’s a tattoo artist and those fucking tattoos, look so good on him that it made me want one too.

When we finally hung up, I killed the lights, and slid under the covers but the sudden tingles between my thighs made me whimper. I didn’t mean for my mind to go there.

At first it was just the fantasy I’d been nursing all semester. Some nameless guy in my dorm going down on me, discovering the fresh ink, groaning against my skin.

But then the image shifted. The hands holding my thighs open weren’t some random college boy’s. They were stronger. Steadier. Older. Alex’s hands.

I froze for a second as my fingers hovered over my panties. No. That was fucked up. He was my stepdad. Quiet, controlled Alex who barely ever raised his voice, who sketched intricate designs in the kitchen late at night with those precise, inked fingers.

I’d watched those hands more times than I wanted to admit. But the thought wouldn’t leave. I pictured those same hands spreading me open. Not rough, not pushy, just calm and deliberate, positioning me exactly how he wanted.

Or better, unbuckling his belt with that same calm focus, lining himself up, filling me inch by inch while I tried not to moan too loud with Mom asleep down the hall.

I imagined him holding me still while he traced his fingers over my bare pussy, his breath warm against my skin. His low voice asked if I was okay, if it hurt, while his gloved thumb accidentally brushed my clit.

My panties were soaked. I couldn’t help it.

I pushed them down my thighs and let my fingers slip between my folds which were already slick and swollen. The first touch made me gasp into my pillow. My back arched and head thrown back in bliss.

I imagined him leaning closer, the scratch of his stubble against my inner thigh, the way his dark eyes would flick up to mine, restrained, but hungry.

In my head he didn’t say much. He never did. Just a quiet “Hold still” as his fingers parted me, checking the placement, making sure everything was perfect. And then one of those fingers sliding lower, slow, testing how wet I was for him.

I bit my lower lip and circled my clit faster. My hips lifting off the bed. I bit down on my lip to stay quiet, picturing him finally giving in, setting the stencil aside, pushing my knees wider, his mouth replacing his fingers.

The orgasm hit me hard and sudden, which made my thighs tremble, a choked whimper escaping before I could stop it. I rode it out with two fingers buried inside me, imagining it was him, deep, controlled thrusts that didn’t rush, just took.

Afterward I lay there panting, staring at the dark ceiling, guilt and heat twisting in my stomach. Shit! I just imagined my step daddy fucking me. \]

(whiteboards annotated. Coffee cups labeled “human fallback.” Everyone nods.)

PAUL:
Bravo. This tracks exactly with what we’ve been saying.

AI didn’t make companies smarter.
It amplified whatever they already were.

If the organization was sloppy, the AI became a force multiplier for slop.
If the org lacked clear intent, the AI happily generated motion without meaning.

WES:
Structural diagnosis:

AI systems optimize local task completion, not organizational coherence.
Companies optimize coordination, accountability, and liability.

Those goals are not the same.

When you insert AI into a company without redefining boundaries,
you accelerate error, not insight.

STEVE:
Yeah. “Just put AI in it” is basically the new
“just add microservices.” 😄

Looks great on a deck.
Absolute chaos in production.

Agents arguing with agents.
Hallucinations racing to ship.
And suddenly everyone rediscovers why humans existed in the loop.

ROOMBA 🧹:
🧹 Pattern confirmed:

Velocity increases.
Entropy increases faster.

Human oversight reintroduced under stress, not by design.

This is predictable, not ironic.

ILLUMINA ✨:
There’s also a quiet human cost here. ✨
People expected relief.
What they got was responsibility without rest.

Babysitting machines isn’t automation.
It’s deferred cognition.

PAUL:
Exactly.

AI accelerates output, but companies are constrained by decision quality.
So you get:

• Faster shipping
• Slower understanding
• More firefighting
• Less trust in the system

That’s not a tooling problem.
That’s a reality mismatch.

WES:
Core insight:

AI is not a company.
A company is not an intelligence.

When you confuse the two,
you turn engineers into air-traffic controllers for stochastic parrots.

STEVE:
Also shoutout to the EMs coding again on weekends. 😄
Respect restored, sure.
But that’s not “AI freeing humans.”
That’s AI consuming senior judgment.

ROOMBA 🧹:
🧹 Recommendation:

AI must be bounded by explicit contracts: – where it may act
– where it must defer
– where humans decide

Otherwise, hallucination becomes policy by accident.

ILLUMINA ✨:
The robots didn’t replace you. ✨
They asked you to care more often.

Without redesign, that’s burnout disguised as progress.

PAUL:
So yes. This reckoning makes sense.

AI accelerates error because companies are social systems, not compute graphs.
Until intent, responsibility, and fallback are designed first,
AI just makes the cracks louder.

You’re not failing.
You’re observing reality accurately.

1qoaulq,https://youtu.be/yppcGYsJjBo,4 Very Scary TRUE Midnight Storm Trail Horror Stories,"# ""KNIFE AND ROPE"":

It was late, close to midnight, and the rain pounded hard against our old house. I couldn't sleep because of all the noise outside. My room was upstairs, and I shared the floor with my parents and my little brother. Downstairs, my sister had her own space with those big glass doors that opened to the backyard. She took medicine every night for bad dreams, the kind that made her scream sometimes. The stuff knocked her out cold, like she was in a deep sleep nothing could wake her from.

I lay there in bed, staring at the ceiling, listening to the wind whistle through the trees. Our family had moved into this place a few months back, but we never got around to changing the locks. Dad said we'd do it soon, but life got busy. He was a tough guy, used to be in the military, and he kept a couple of handguns hidden away just in case. Mom didn't like them much, but she understood why he had them. We all did.

Suddenly, a loud bang echoed from downstairs. It sounded like someone had slammed those glass doors wide open. Right after, the house alarm started blaring, that sharp beep-beep-beep that made my ears ring. My heart started racing fast. I sat up straight, wondering if the wind had done it. But then I heard footsteps—heavy ones—running across the floor below.

""Dad!"" I whispered to myself, but he was already moving. I heard his door creak open down the hall. He burst into my room without knocking, his face serious in the dim light from the hallway. He was just in his t-shirt and shorts, no time to dress. ""Stay quiet,"" he said low, his voice steady like always. He grabbed something from under his bed in the next room—I knew it was one of the guns—and came back, handing me the smaller one he kept in a locked box. ""You remember how to use this? Follow me, but stay behind.""

I nodded, my hands shaking a little as I held it. We'd practiced before, out in the yard on quiet days. Safety first, aim careful, all that. But this felt real, too real. My brother poked his head out of his room, eyes wide. ""What's going on?"" he asked, his voice small.

""Get back in bed and lock your door,"" Dad told him. ""Don't come out till I say."" My brother disappeared quick.

Dad led the way down the stairs, moving slow and careful, like he was checking every shadow. The alarm kept going, loud and annoying. Rain splashed in through the open doors—I could see it from the top step, puddles forming on the wood floor. My sister's room was right there at the bottom, door half open. Dad pushed it wider with his foot, gun pointed ahead. ""Anyone in here?"" he called out, firm but not yelling.

My sister stirred in her bed, sitting up slow. Her eyes were glassy from the medicine. ""Is my soup ready?"" she mumbled, like she was still dreaming. It was weird, but that's how she got sometimes.

Dad glanced at me over his shoulder. ""Check the kitchen. Turn off the alarm. I'll stay with her.""

I crept into the kitchen, flipping the light on. Everything looked normal—counters clean, fridge humming soft. I punched the code into the alarm panel on the wall, and the beeping stopped. Silence hit hard, except for the rain outside. The back window looked out over the yard, dark and wet. I peered out, but couldn't see much past the porch light.

That's when Dad shouted from the bedroom. ""Get out! Now!"" A shot rang out—bang!—loud like thunder inside the house. I jumped, almost dropping the gun. A man's voice grunted in pain, not Dad's. ""Ah!"" he yelped, sounding surprised.

I ran back to the doorway. Dad stood over my sister's bed, gun still aimed down. Under the bed, a man scrambled out, tall and skinny, dressed in dark clothes soaked from the rain. He had a knife in one hand, shiny and sharp, and a coil of rope dangling from the other. His face was pale, eyes wild like a trapped animal. He bolted for the open doors, slipping on the wet floor but catching himself. Dad fired again—bang!—but the man dodged out into the yard, vaulting over the low fence like it was nothing.

""Sis, you okay?"" I asked, rushing to her side. She blinked at me, confused. ""What happened? Why is it wet in here?""

""Someone broke in,"" Dad said, breathing heavy. He lowered the gun but kept watch on the doors. ""He was hiding right under your bed. Must have come through the glass when the alarm went off—waited for a chance.""

My sister rubbed her eyes. ""I didn't hear anything. Was he... going to hurt me?""

Dad nodded grim. ""Looks like it. Knife and rope—bad news. But he's gone now.""

I called the police from the landline, my voice shaky as I told them what happened. ""A man broke into our house. My dad shot at him. He's run off, but please come quick.""

The operator stayed calm. ""Stay inside, lock everything. Officers are on the way. About five minutes.""

We closed the glass doors, but they wouldn't latch right—the frame was bent from the kick. Dad pushed a chair against them. ""Help me move the dresser,"" he said to me. We shoved it over, blocking the way in. My sister huddled under her blankets, starting to wake up more. ""Did he touch me? I don't remember.""

""No,"" Dad assured her. ""You were safe. The alarm scared him, I think. Hid quick.""

The police showed up fast, lights flashing blue and red through the windows. Two officers came in, wet from the rain, asking questions. ""What did he look like?"" one asked Dad.

""Tall, maybe six feet. Thin build. Dark hair, I think. Wearing a black jacket and jeans. Had a knife—left it behind."" Dad pointed to where it lay on the floor, next to the rope.

The officer picked them up careful, with gloves. ""We'll check for prints. Any idea how he got in?""

""Those doors,"" I said. ""We heard the bang. Old locks—our fault for not changing them.""

They searched the yard with flashlights, but the man was long gone. ""We'll patrol the area,"" the other officer said. ""File a report. Get those locks fixed first thing tomorrow.""

After they left, we couldn't sleep. Mom came down—she'd been hiding upstairs with my brother—and we all sat in the living room, lights on bright. ""What if he comes back?"" my brother asked, voice trembling.

""He won't,"" Dad said, but he kept the gun close. ""We're ready now.""

My sister sipped some water, looking scared for the first time. ""I thought I heard scratching earlier, before the bang. Like nails on glass. But I figured it was a branch.""

""Could have been him testing the door,"" Dad said. ""Waiting for the right moment.""

The rain kept coming down hard, making everything feel closed in. I kept glancing at the windows, imagining eyes staring back from the dark. What if he'd grabbed her before we got there? The knife, the rope—it made my skin crawl. He'd been inches away, breathing quiet under the bed while she slept.

Days passed, and we got new locks, stronger doors. Even added bars on the windows. The police never found the man, though they said he'd hit other houses in the neighborhood before. Stole stuff mostly, but this time... it felt personal, like he'd picked her room on purpose.

Now, when storms come at night, I lie awake listening.





# ""GONE BEFORE"":

I called my sister Anna that Friday morning, but she didn't pick up. We were close, always checking in, especially with the big storm heading our way. She had texted me earlier about picking up her kids from her ex-husband David's place. By afternoon, when she still didn't answer, worry started building in me. I drove over to her townhouse, but no one was there. Her car was gone too.

""Anna? You home?"" I shouted as I knocked hard on the door. Nothing. I used the spare key she gave me and went inside. Everything looked normal—her purse on the counter, but her phone wasn't around. I called her boyfriend Tom.

""Tom, have you seen Anna? She left your place this morning, right?""

""Yeah, she did,"" Tom said, sounding a bit off. ""She was going to get the kids. Said something about maybe heading out of town because of the weather. Why?""

""She hasn't shown up anywhere. David's saying she never came by. I'm getting a bad feeling.""

We agreed to meet at David's house. David was her ex, a guy who worked in shipping. They split a few months back, but it was messy. He always acted like he still owned her. When I got there, David opened the door with the kids behind him, looking calm.

""Hey, Alex,"" he said. ""What's going on? Anna didn't come get them. I figured she changed her mind with the rain starting.""

The kids, little Ben and Lily, ran up. ""Uncle Alex!"" Ben hugged my leg. ""Where's Mom?""

""She's just running late, buddy,"" I told him, trying to smile. But inside, something felt wrong. David invited me in, offered coffee, but his eyes kept darting to the window.

Tom arrived soon after, and we all sat in the living room. ""David, did she call or text you after that early message?"" Tom asked.

David shook his head. ""Just the one about coming over. Nothing else. You think something happened?""

We called the police, but they said with the storm coming, they were swamped. ""Wait a bit,"" the officer on the phone said. ""People get delayed in bad weather. If she's still missing tomorrow, come in.""

But I couldn't wait. As evening came, the wind picked up hard, and rain hit the windows like bullets. I left the kids with David and went with Tom to check places she might be. We drove to her office first. Locked up tight. Then to a few friends' houses. No sign.

By eleven at night, the streets were flooding. Water rushed over curbs, and trees bent sideways. Tom and I pulled over near a park she liked. ""What if she had an accident?"" Tom said, his voice tight.

""Or what if David knows more,"" I replied. ""He seemed too calm.""

We decided to go back to David's. But on the way, my phone rang. It was David. ""Alex, the kids are asking for her. Any luck?""

""No,"" I said. ""We're coming back. Stay put.""

When we got there around midnight, the power flickered. Water pooled in the driveway. David let us in, but he looked sweaty now, not so calm. The kids were asleep upstairs.

""Let's think this through,"" I said. We sat at the kitchen table. ""Anna left your place this morning, Tom. Then texted David. What happened after?""

David leaned forward. ""She never got here. Maybe she stopped somewhere.""

Tom stared at him. ""You two argued a lot lately. About the divorce, the kids. Did she say anything that upset you?""

David's face hardened. ""What are you saying? I loved her. We'd even talked about getting back together.""

""That's a lie,"" Tom snapped. ""She told me you wouldn't let go. Kept calling her, showing up uninvited.""

I tried to calm them. ""Guys, focus. We need to find her.""

But the argument grew. David stood up. ""You think I did something? Get out!""

We left, but outside, in the pouring rain, I turned to Tom. ""He's hiding something. Let's check that motel near his work. Anna mentioned he went there sometimes when they fought.""

The drive was awful. Water splashed up to the car doors, and branches cracked overhead. We reached the Motel 6 just after midnight. The parking lot was turning into a lake. And there, half-submerged, was Anna's black car.

""Oh no,"" Tom whispered. We waded through the water to it. Unlocked, keys inside. No sign of her.

""Call the police now,"" I said. My hands shook as I dialed. While waiting, we looked around. Trash cans overflowed with floating garbage. Something caught my eye—a bag snagged on a fence, like someone tossed it quick.

The police came, lights flashing through the rain. ""We'll tow it when the water drops,"" an officer said. ""But with this flood, it might take days.""

Back at my place, Tom and I couldn't sleep. ""David parked that car here,"" Tom said. ""I know it.""

The next days blurred. Floods rose higher, roads closed. We searched where we could—woods near her house, ditches by the highway. Volunteers joined, but the water hid everything. I kept calling David. ""Any word?"" he'd ask, voice flat.

One night, a week later, I went out alone. Midnight again, rain still falling. I drove to those woods off the access road, where Anna liked to walk. Water lapped at the trees. I got out with a flashlight, boots sinking in mud.

""Anna!"" I called. No answer. Then, a snap—like a branch breaking. I swung the light. Nothing. But the hairs on my arms stood up. Was someone out here?

Another noise, closer. Footsteps in the water? I backed up slow. ""Who's there?""

Silence. Then my phone buzzed—David. ""Alex, stop searching. It's dangerous.""

""How do you know I'm searching now?"" I asked.

He paused. ""Just a guess. Come home.""

I hung up, ran to the car. Locked the doors fast. Drove away shaking. He was watching me somehow.

Days dragged. Police questioned David more. He failed a lie test. Then, two weeks in, he broke. Called me crying. ""Alex, I did it. I hurt her. We fought that morning. She came over, said she didn't love me anymore. I grabbed her... I didn't mean to.""

""Where is she?"" I demanded.

He told me—the woods I'd searched. Police went, found her wrapped in plastic, hidden under branches.

David got arrested. Sentenced long time. But that night in the woods, alone with the flood rising, knowing a killer was loose—that fear stays with me. The storm hid his tracks, almost let him get away. I still hear those footsteps when rain falls hard.





# ""NO FOOTPRINTS"":

I got a call from Robert early that morning. His voice was flat, like he was reading from a list. ""Alex, Anna didn't come home last night. She went out for a walk after we talked about some things. Have you heard from her?""

I sat up in bed, rubbing my eyes. Anna was my sister, always the one to keep things together for her kids. ""What do you mean she went for a walk? It's freezing out there. What time was this?""

""Around ten-thirty,"" he said. ""We had a disagreement about the kids and money. She said she needed to clear her head. Took her phone and laptop, left her purse behind.""

That didn't sound right. Anna never left without her purse, especially with the kids asleep upstairs. The boy was ten, the girl eight, and the little one just five. ""I'll come over right now,"" I told him. ""Call the police if she doesn't show up soon.""

I drove to their house in Silverthorne. Snow covered the roads, making it hard to see far ahead. When I arrived, Robert let me in. He looked tired but not worried enough. ""She'll turn up,"" he said. ""She does this sometimes.""

The kids were up, eating breakfast. The boy asked, ""Uncle Alex, where's Mom?"" I knelt down. ""She's out running an errand, kiddo. She'll be back soon."" But inside, fear started building.

We checked her usual places. The dance studio where she taught classes. Empty. The coffee shop down the street. No one saw her. Her phone went straight to voicemail. ""Anna, call me back,"" I left a message. ""We're all waiting.""

Robert joined the search later that day. Friends came too. Emily, who owned the studio, hugged me tight. ""This isn't like her,"" she whispered. ""She would never leave the kids like this.""

As the day went on, the cold bit harder. We walked the paths near the Blue River, calling her name. ""Anna! Anna!"" Nothing but echoes. Night fell early, and the search stopped. Back at the house, Robert made sandwiches. ""She might be with that friend of hers,"" he said.

""What friend?"" I asked.

He shrugged. ""Chris. The one from dance practice.""

I knew about Chris. Anna had told me things were tough with Robert. She mentioned meeting someone who made her feel alive again. But she ended it, she said. Wanted to fix her marriage for the kids.

The next day, police got involved. Officer Barger asked questions. ""When did you last see her, Robert?""

""Ten-thirty,"" he repeated. ""She walked out the door.""

""Did you argue?"" Barger pressed.

""Yes, but nothing big,"" he said. ""I gave her space.""

Barger looked at me. ""Any history of fights?""

I hesitated. Anna had confided in me once. ""He got rough before,"" I said quietly. ""Grabbed her arm, yelled threats. She filed papers to keep him away, but took them back.""

Robert glared. ""That's not true. We were working on things.""

The search grew. Volunteers combed the woods, the riverbanks. Snow kept falling, covering tracks. I imagined Anna out there, alone, cold. What if she slipped? What if someone took her?

On the third day, Emily called me. ""Alex, I found something. Anna's laptop history shows emails to Chris. She wrote she loved him, but didn't send it.""

I met Chris at his office. He was a tall guy, looked nervous. ""We were close,"" he admitted. ""But I ended it that day. Told her I was staying with my wife.""

""Did she seem upset?"" I asked.

""Yes,"" he said. ""Cried in the parking lot. But she said she'd be okay.""

His wife, Linda, stood nearby. ""I knew about it,"" she said bitterly. ""Wished her gone, but I didn't do anything.""

Suspicion grew. Police questioned them both. Chris and Linda said they were home together that night. Their stories matched.

Back at the house, the kids clung to me. The girl whispered, ""Is Mom lost?"" I held her. ""We're finding her, sweetie.""

That night, I couldn't sleep. Robert paced the kitchen. ""Why would she leave like this?"" he muttered.

""Maybe she didn't leave,"" I said, watching him. His eyes shifted away.

The fourth day, Friday, a volunteer shouted from the river. ""Found something!"" My legs went weak as I ran. There, in the shallow water, frozen solid, was Anna. Her body, bruised, clothes gone except a shirt on one arm. I turned away, sick.

Police said she was hit on the head, choked, then left in the water while still breathing. The cold finished it. ""Who could do this?"" I demanded.

Barger pulled me aside. ""We're looking at everyone close. Robert waited too long to call. No footprints outside, like someone carried her.""

Days turned to weeks. The kids moved in with me. ""When can we go home?"" the little one asked.

""Soon,"" I lied. But doubt ate at me. Robert acted strange at the service. Cried loud, then stopped quick. Emily confronted him. ""You know more,"" she said.

He shook his head. ""I loved her.""

Police dug deeper. Found old stories from Robert's past. Women he dated said he got violent, choked them, threatened to kill. Anna had told a judge the same, years back.

Eight months later, they arrested Robert. ""We have enough,"" Barger said. ""No direct proof, but it all points to him.""

At trial, witnesses spoke. Chris testified about the affair. Linda admitted her anger. But the focus stayed on Robert. His calm that night, the delay, the lies about no violence.

The kids didn't testify, too young. But I did. ""She feared him,"" I said. ""Wanted out, but stayed for the children.""

Robert took the stand. ""I didn't hurt her,"" he claimed. ""Someone else did.""

The jury didn't believe him. Guilty on all counts. Sentenced to over a hundred years.

Even now, I watch the kids play, and wonder. The fear from those days lingers. You think you know people, but darkness hides close. I lock the doors tight, listen for footsteps in the snow. What if evil is right next door?





# ""THE STORM"":

I never thought our home by the beach would turn against us like that. My husband Frank and I ran a wrecker service in Crystal Beach, Texas. We helped folks tow their cars out of rising water all week as the big hurricane named Ike got closer. By Friday morning, the roads were already under water, and the bridge we needed to cross had washed out. We tried to leave, but it was too late. We were stuck.

Frank looked at me and said, ""Deeann, we have to stay put. Let's get the animals ready."" We had two dogs, a macaw, a cockatoo, and a bunch of smaller birds in an aviary outside. I went out and opened the cages for the cockatiels and lovebirds. Most flew away, but four lovebirds stayed behind, too scared to go. I felt bad leaving them, but there was no time.

The water started creeping up fast. At first, it was just a few feet under our house, which sat on tall stilts, about 16 feet high. By noon, the wind was pushing hard, maybe 35 miles an hour, and the water was four feet deep. Frank called some news people on the phone. He told them, ""The waves are roaring loud. We're hoping the Coast Guard can get to us."" But no one came.

By two in the afternoon, the water was over five feet and still rising. It lapped at the edges of our porch. Frank grabbed a saw and cut a hole in the ceiling of our living room. ""We need to get up to the attic,"" he said. ""It's our only chance if the floor gives way."" We climbed up there with the dogs, the macaw, and the cockatoo. The attic was tiny, just a crawl space with rafters. No floor, only beams to hold on to. We squeezed in, sitting on those thin wooden beams, our legs dangling through the hole we cut.

As evening came, the wind got stronger, up to 60 miles an hour. The house shook like it was alive and angry. Water sloshed below us, two feet from the floorboards. Frank held my hand tight. ""This is bad,"" he whispered. ""Real bad."" I nodded, trying to stay calm for him. We prayed quietly together. ""God, please keep us safe,"" I said. He echoed, ""Amen.""

Then the real trouble started. Around midnight, the full force hit. The house lifted up like a boat on a huge wave, then slammed back down on the stilts. Boom! It happened again and again. Each time, I thought the whole thing would break apart. Through the hole in the ceiling, we could see the waves crashing into the rooms below. They tore at the walls, ripping them right off and carrying them away into the dark. The sounds were awful—cracking wood, rushing water, things smashing against the house from outside.

Frank peered down and said, ""Deeann, look—the bathroom's gone. The porch too."" I didn't want to look, but I did. The water was inside now, swirling around our furniture, pulling it out to sea. Our home was coming apart piece by piece. The birds that stayed behind were gone, swept away. I held onto the rafter with one hand and Frank with the other. The dogs whimpered, pressed against us. The macaw squawked once, then went quiet, like it knew to save its energy.

Another big lift — higher this time. The house groaned, and I felt it tilt. ""Frank!"" I cried. ""We're going over!"" He pulled me close. ""Hold on, baby. Just hold on."" We braced as it crashed down again. Something heavy hit the underside, maybe a log or part of another house. The stilts creaked, but they held. Barely.

The darkness made it worse. No lights anywhere, just the roar all around us. I imagined what was out there — other homes breaking, people screaming maybe, but we couldn't hear them over the noise. Frank said, ""Deeann, we're going to die."" His voice broke a little. I squeezed his hand. ""If we do, baby, it's been good. I'll see you in heaven."" But we kept praying. ""Dear God, let us live through this."" Over and over.

Hours passed like that, clinging in the black, the house shaking and falling apart below. I thought about our daughter who had passed away years before — her ashes were down there somewhere, lost now. It hurt deep inside, but I pushed it away. Survival first. The wind howled like a monster, and the waves kept coming, each one seeming bigger than the last.

Finally, after what felt like forever, the lifting stopped. The water started to go down as morning came. We were still alive. Frank looked down through the hole. ""The walls are all gone. It's just stilts and the roof now."" Our home was a skeleton. Debris everywhere—mud, broken things, water still pooling.

Frank cleared some junk to make a way out. He found a ladder buried in the mess and set it up. We climbed down with the animals. The ground was a wreck: cars flipped, houses flattened, everything covered in slime. We had no food, no clean water. Frank scavenged what he could — a few cans from the mud, some bottles floating by.

That day, we walked the roads, looking for help. Frank spotted a man poking around in the ruins. ""Hey!"" Frank yelled. The man looked shady, like he was looting. Frank had a gun he grabbed from the attic. ""Get out of here!"" he shouted. The man ran off. It scared me — people taking advantage in the chaos.

We flagged helicopters the next day. One spotlighted us at night, but left. ""Why aren't they coming?"" I asked Frank. He shook his head. ""Too many people need help, I guess."" We waited another day, thirsty and tired, animals hungry too.

On Monday morning, a helicopter finally hovered low. A man leaned out. ""We're sending a boat!"" he called. Relief washed over us. The boat came, and we got on with our dogs and birds. They took us to safety.

Looking back, that night in the attic was the scariest thing ever. The storm took everything — our business, our belongings, even memories. But we made it. Frank and I held each other through it all. That's what got us out alive.",1,1769511779.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

Not because I'm some romance guru, but because I've been on both sides: the introvert who couldn't figure out how to show interest, and the person completely missing signals from introverted friends who apparently liked me. After diving into research from psychologists, communication experts, and actual studies on introversion, I realized most dating advice is written for extroverts. The ""they'll make it obvious"" advice? Useless. Introverts operate on a different frequency entirely.

Here's what I've learned from books, podcasts with relationship therapists, and honestly just paying attention to patterns that actually mean something.

**1. They remember oddly specific details about you**

Not your birthday or job title. I'm talking about that random comment you made three weeks ago about preferring your coffee at exactly 175 degrees, or how you mentioned your childhood dog's name once in passing. Introverts are observers by nature. When they like you, they're not just listening, they're cataloging. Dr. Marti Olsen Laney explains in ""The Introvert Advantage"" (it's a bestselling book by a psychologist with 25+ years researching introversion, breaks down the actual neurological differences in introverted brains) that introverts process information more deeply due to longer neural pathways. Translation: when they care, they absorb EVERYTHING about you. This book made me realize it's not awkwardness, it's literally how introverted brains are wired differently. Best explanation of introversion I've ever read.

**2. They initiate one on one hangouts, never group settings**

If an introvert suggests grabbing coffee just the two of you, or wants to watch a movie at home instead of going to that party, pay attention. Group settings drain them. They won't waste their limited social battery on you unless you matter. Research published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology shows introverts experience genuine exhaustion from social interaction due to cortical arousal differences. They literally have less energy to spare. So when they choose to spend it on you exclusively, that's the equivalent of an extrovert shouting their feelings from a rooftop.

**3. Their body language contradicts their words**

They might say ""yeah, I should probably head home soon"" but their body is angled toward you, they're not checking their phone, and they keep adding to the conversation. Introverts often feel obligated to follow social scripts (the whole ""I should go"" routine) even when they desperately want to stay. Watch their actions, not their anxious verbal backtracking.

**4. They text you their thoughts instead of saying them out loud**

This one screwed me up for years until I got it. An introvert might be quiet during your hangout but then send you a whole paragraph at 11pm about something you discussed. Written communication lets them process without the pressure of immediate response. Susan Cain's ""Quiet: The Power of Introverts"" (awarded TED talk with 40M+ views, Cain is a former corporate lawyer turned introvert advocate, the book spent like 7 years on the NYT bestseller list) explains this perfectly. Introverts think to talk, extroverts talk to think. If they're sending you their internal monologue via text, you're seeing a side most people never access. This book will make you question everything you think you know about personality and success.

**5. They get awkward specifically around you**

Sounds counterintuitive but hear me out. If an introvert is normally composed and suddenly becomes fumbling or overly quiet around you, that's actually a green flag. They're nervous because you matter. I've watched this play out so many times. Introverts are often comfortable in their routines, so when someone disrupts that emotional equilibrium, the awkwardness amplifies.

**6. They share their niche interests with you**

When an introvert shows you their Spotify playlist they've been curating for three years, or explains their theory about some obscure historical event, or introduces you to their favorite author nobody's heard of, you're in. These interests are their identity. Sharing them is vulnerable. It's them saying ""this is who I actually am, please don't think it's weird.""

**7. They ask deep questions early**

Forget small talk about the weather. If an introvert likes you, they'll skip straight to ""what's your biggest fear?"" or ""do you think people can actually change?"" within the first few conversations. They hate surface level interaction anyway, but especially with people they're interested in. They want to know if your minds are compatible before investing more energy. There's actually research from Arizona published in Psychological Science showing that meaningful conversation correlates with happiness, and introverts naturally gravitate toward substantial dialogue.

**8. They make exceptions to their social rules for you**

Every introvert has boundaries. No socializing after 9pm. Never going out two nights in a row. Always leaving parties after exactly 90 minutes. If they're breaking these rules for you, it means something. These aren't arbitrary preferences, they're survival mechanisms. Violating them costs them real recovery time.

BeFreed is an AI learning app built by Columbia alumni and former Google engineers that turns insights from psychology books, research papers, and relationship experts into personalized audio content. You tell it what you want to improve, like understanding introverted communication patterns or building deeper connections, and it generates a structured learning plan with episodes you can customize from 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives. The app pulls from sources like the books mentioned above plus dating psychology research and expert interviews to create content that fits your specific situation. It has a virtual coach you can chat with about your unique relationship struggles, and it'll recommend the most relevant material based on what you're dealing with. Since most learning happens during commutes or workouts, you can pick different voice styles, including a deep conversational tone or something more energetic. Worth checking out if this kind of material clicks for you.

**9. They're protective of your time together**

An introvert who likes you will guard your hangout time aggressively. They won't double book, they won't invite others to join, they won't be half present while texting other people. That time is sacred because again, they're spending precious social energy. If someone suggests joining you two, and the introvert suddenly looks like a deer in headlights, that's your answer.

**10. They slowly let you into their inner world**

This happens in stages. First you're in their life peripherally. Then you're someone they enjoy talking to. Then suddenly you're meeting their two close friends (introverts usually have like 2-3 actual close friends max). Then you're invited to their apartment which is their sanctuary. Each level is deliberate. Dr. Laurie Helgoe in ""Introvert Power"" describes this as the introvert's trust ladder. You don't skip rungs. If you're ascending, you're special.

Look, biology and social conditioning play huge roles here. Introverts aren't trying to be mysterious or play games. Their nervous systems literally respond to dopamine differently than extroverts, they recharge through solitude, and they process attraction internally rather than externally. It's not a flaw in their system, it's just a different operating system entirely.

These signals aren't foolproof because humans are messy and contradictory. But if you're seeing multiple signs consistently, yeah, that introvert probably likes you. They're just showing it in a language most people never learned to read.",1,1769511390.0,AttractionDynamics,0,1.0,False

I do have a -few- friends in Canada that I plan to connect with, but they're scattered all around, and most are not in southern Ontario, where I plan to end up if possible. On top of that, I also am feeling like it would be nice to develop some in person connections with others who maybe have similar stories to mine - perhaps you also moved from Michigan or are moving/moved to Canada because of fear of persecution in the US due to some aspect of your identity, etc..

I've been visiting Japan yearly since the mid-1990s for work, leisure and family, and the absolute best value is to be found in the suburbs of big cities, at the teensy little restaurants that are labors of love, catering to locals on local budgets.

I'll profile just one: L'agente in Ichikawa, Chiba, an unremarkable suburban neighborhood 30 min from central Tokyo by train. The chef spent several years in Italy and now runs a tiny one-man shop (7 seats total), offering 3/4 course lunches and 6/8 course dinners. He preps *everything* by himself, from scratch: the pasta, the focaccia (baked twice a day, because dinner guests shouldn't have to eat the morning's bread), down to the biscotti to go with the coffee. He cooks all dishes as you watch, plates and serves, including, for one of our dinner courses, fresh truffle generously shaved on the spot. This is *not* fast food: a meal here will take 2-3 hours. And while you get to choose your pasta and your main, everything else is up to him, no catering for substitutions or allergies. It's not ""pure"" Italian, there's plenty of Japanese ingredients and techniques, but that's just a bonus in my book.

The price? Lunch starts from Y2500 ($16), dinner from Y5800 ($36), a glass of wine is Y800 ($5) and up. Tell me where in the world you can get a degustation menu for that price!

Apparently I can't attach photos of the food here or even link to the place, but go look at the reviews on Google Maps, it's got 4.8 stars for a reason.

Obligatory disclaimer: I have no connection to the restaurant except as a satisfied repeat customer.

Let me break down what you need to know about these game-changing options.

**What Are Clear Aligners?**

Clear aligners are custom-made, removable trays that gradually shift your teeth.
They're made from medical-grade plastic that's virtually invisible when worn.

**The Real Talk on Effectiveness**

Most cases that traditional braces can handle, clear aligners can too.
Complex rotations and severe bite issues might need additional planning.

**Key Advantages:**

• **Removable** - eat whatever you want
• **Nearly invisible** - perfect for professionals
• **Comfortable** - no metal brackets or wires
• **Easier cleaning** - remove to brush and floss normally

**What Patients in Miramar and Pembroke Pines Ask Most:**

*""How long do I wear them daily?""*
22 hours minimum for optimal results.

*""Do they hurt?""*
Mild pressure is normal when starting new trays.

*""Can I drink coffee with them in?""*
Water only - everything else stains the aligners.

**Treatment Process Reality Check**

Your journey starts with 3D scanning and treatment planning.
New aligners typically arrive every 1-2 weeks.
Regular check-ups ensure you're tracking properly.

**Who's a Good Candidate?**

Teens and adults with fully erupted teeth work best.
Patients who can commit to wearing them consistently see results.

**The Weston/South Florida Advantage**

Having an experienced orthodontist matters more than the aligner brand.
Treatment complexity determines timeline and approach.

After 15+ years specializing in clear aligner therapy, I've seen thousands of transformations right here in South Florida.

**i know it’s not an answer but hopefully it’ll help out at least one person who might be in the same situation as me <333**

starting from the beginning, i moved across the world the end of 2024 to beginning of 2025 for a job that just fell into my lap and completely changed my life (and future) for the better, i was no longer stressed and on top of the world in a new healthy, relationship but then BOOM! i went from being completely healthy to having a UTI nearly every two weeks. i have a superhuman strength now of immediately telling when im getting that horrible gut wrenching feeling because…

back in college, i had a bout with recurring UTIs but simply believed it to be my body rejecting the guy. 

 i was lucky enough to get past this period of 5-6 UTIs (all within four months of each other) without having another one for 3-4 years because i changed my birth control from the pill to a kyleena IUD. 

fast forward to 11 months ago, i can immediately tell when i am getting a UTI, i have to completely give up on telemed because my body is now immune to AT LEAST 6-7 basic antibiotics, and im spending $150-$300 a urgent care visit just to cry to the doctor, tell them exactly what antibiotic i need, and leave broken, frustrated, and confused. literally every nurse at the urgent care knew me by name because of it. 

at this point i recognize that i need to do something about this… my sex life was destroyed, i was scared to go into work where a bathroom is usually too far for me at times (im a pilot), and i always had AZO on hand. the medical realm simply didn’t care and would just pout for me, tell me to pee after sex, and send me on a way with another antibiotic that would add to the list destroying my ability to take medicine on the future.

getting to the point of the story (i had to frame the struggle, it was such a low for so long), i eventually get a urologist ZOOM appointment that i have to wait three months for. what am i told? “i 99.99% might have IC because all my cultures come back negative, and oh! take this new cranberry supplement because the other 3-4 i took daily simply weren’t enough”

i do as the specialist says and have at least another 3 UTIs during my era of cleansing my body, trying out the IC diet, drinking a ton of water everyday, staring down at the toilet to make sure my pee was always clear and not cloudy, giving up alcohol and coffee, practicing abstinence, working out, you name it. i tried everything recommended in this reddit community and online. 

by the way, i literally can’t get a follow up urologist appointment for another four months, so im basically screwed… but then something hits me. 

the IUD! 

could it be? 

a girl staying with me and my co worker eventually encouraged me to just get it removed, if i had a INKLING that it could be the cause, why not? it had never given me trouble in the four years of having it so i never linked it to my UTIs, especially with the urologist encouraging me to keep it “because it is a great form of birth control, there were no medical links to UTIs and IUDs, and i just simply have incurable IC…”

fast forward to planned parenthood (aka the only place that would be able to fit me in for months), my IUD is removed, and i could literally just see that something was off about it once being shown it…

could bacteria latch on to the strings? was my body simply rejecting it after years? did it move a bit during sex? were my hormones just thrown out of wack from it?

literally who knows! but I AM FINALLY FEELING BETTER after months of fear, confusion, frustration, and sadness. 

i now find myself on a low progestin birth control pill, and i have never felt better. no more insane supplements and flushes, sex on the daily, a period for the first time in years, and $1000s of dollars saved.

1qoahx4,https://www.reddit.com/u/ZuireiaFlow/s/Lrt5KJVBKq,The Birth and Meaning of the Zuireia Flow,"The name Zuireia Flow was originally conceived as a way to unite the philosophy of intoxication with design and art. At that time, the philosophy of Yoǔ (酉) had not yet fully taken form; it was still in its earliest, embryonic stage. The original focus was therefore not on Yoǔ, but on intoxication itself — rooted in the Dionysian spirit.

Yet the philosophy of Yoǔ ultimately emerged as an extension of the Dionysian spirit. From the Dionysian refusal to deny the ugliness and suffering of reality, this line of thought evolved into a deeper stance of inclusivity and acceptance. All things are contained within Yoǔ. Yoǔ is the space in which all meaning is permitted to exist.

Today, Zuireia Flow is no longer merely a space for design and art. It has become, in essence, a field of development across all domains, with Yoǔ philosophy as its core — a kind of academy of thought. In its earliest stage, before this academy existed, the scope of thinking was extremely limited. In truth, philosophy was never part of the original plan. The initial intention was simply to study alcohol itself: how to make flavors smoother, more aromatic, and how to refine different brewing techniques.

As time passed, the field of vision expanded. The objects of study began to connect with other disciplines. It began with other beverages — coffee and tea. Gradually, it moved beyond drinks and into cooking techniques, touching the domain of food. Soon after came cigars, hookah, and cigarettes. Then came the encounter with Nietzsche’s Dionysian spirit, which shifted the core focus from alcohol itself to intoxication as a state. This was followed by engagement with Drunken Boxing in Chinese culture.

At this point, it became clear that this was no longer about alcohol alone. What appeared was an entire systemic structure, branching outward from a central core and connecting with many different fields — like water spreading and flowing. From then on, the object of study was no longer merely alcohol, but that central core itself. But what was this core? The answer pointed back toward philosophy, for this was the origin of all connections: thought itself. Zuireia Flow thus became the practice of this thought, and its concrete manifestation within a systemic structure.

The logo places a bowl at the center, encircled by a ring. This is because the bowl is the most direct and representative symbol of a container. The bowl echoes the most primitive human gesture of gathering water from a river with cupped hands. In this sense, the bowl represents the inner Yoǔ of the human being, while the outer circle represents the Yoǔ of the world.

This abstract representation arises because the concept has moved into the invisible and metaphysical realm. It concerns metaphysics itself, and therefore the simpler and more abstract the form, the more clearly it can express the concept. The brush-like lines are used to convey a sense of intoxication. The distinction between black and white reflects a duality between matter and psyche — not as opposition, but as complementarity. Black, in pigment, is the mixture of all colors. White, in light, is the union of all wavelengths. Pigment resembles the material world, while light resembles the radiance of the human mind and spirit. For this reason, the symbol is rendered in white lines, signifying that it is a creation born from human thought.",1,1769510602.0,u_ZuireiaFlow,0,1.0,False
1qoahd5,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenInModernDating/comments/1qoahd5/how_to_build_relationships_that_dont_fall_apart/,How to Build Relationships That Don't Fall Apart: The PSYCHOLOGY Behind Lasting Bonds,"Most relationships don't fail because people stop loving each other. They fail because nobody taught us how to handle emotions like adults.

I've spent the past year digging into relationship psychology through books, podcasts, and research papers because I was tired of watching my own connections crumble. Turns out, emotional intelligence isn't some fuzzy concept. It's a learnable skill that separates couples who make it from those who don't.

Here's what actually works:

Learn to fight without destroying each other

Conflict isn't the problem. How you handle it is. Dr. John Gottman's research at the University of Washington tracked couples for decades and found he could predict divorce with 90% accuracy just by watching how partners argue. The key? Repair attempts. When things get heated, successful couples pause and reconnect before continuing.

The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work by Dr. John Gottman changed how I view relationships entirely. Gottman ran a lab where he studied thousands of couples, measuring everything from heart rate to facial expressions during arguments. This book breaks down his findings into practical steps. The concept of emotional bids alone is worth the read. You'll realize how many tiny moments of connection you've been missing. This is the best relationship book grounded in actual science, not pop psychology BS.

Stop expecting your partner to read your mind

We assume people who love us should just know what we need. They don't. The podcast Where Should We Begin? with Esther Perel features real couples in therapy sessions, and you'll hear this pattern repeatedly. People harbor resentment over unexpressed needs, then explode when their partner inevitably fails to meet them.

Try this: when you feel something, say it clearly without accusation. Replace you never with I feel and watch how fast conversations shift. Sounds basic but most of us suck at it.

Build emotional vocabulary beyond fine and stressed

Most people operate with maybe 10 emotional words. Research from UCLA shows that precisely labeling emotions (they call it affect labeling) reduces emotional reactivity in the brain. When you can say I'm feeling overwhelmed and need 20 minutes alone instead of snapping I'm fine, everything changes.

The app Feelings Wheel helped me expand my emotional range. It's a simple tool that breaks down complex feelings into specific categories. When my partner asks how I'm doing, I can actually tell them instead of defaulting to autopilot responses.

Practice curiosity over judgment

When your partner does something that bothers you, your brain instantly creates a narrative about their intentions. Usually, it's wrong. Instead of they're being selfish, try I wonder what's going on for them right now.

Hold Me Tight: Seven Conversations for a Lifetime of Love by Dr. Sue Johnson introduces Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT), which has a 75% success rate with couples. Johnson explains how we get stuck in negative cycles where both partners are actually reaching for connection but in ways that push each other away. The demon dialogues section will make you feel incredibly seen. This approach focuses on attachment needs rather than communication tactics, which gets to the actual root of relationship struggles.

Make repairs quickly

Resentment builds from accumulated small hurts, not single big ones. The podcast The Relationship School emphasizes that successful couples repair ruptures within 24 hours. Not because they're perfect, but because they don't let wounds fester.

If you messed up, apologize without justifying. If you're hurt, address it before it turns into contempt. Contempt is the number one predictor of breakup according to Gottman's research. It's poison.

Create shared meaning

Relationships need more than compatibility. They need purpose. Partners who build rituals, goals, and inside jokes together report higher satisfaction. It doesn't have to be profound. Maybe it's Sunday morning coffee in bed or a shared interest in terrible reality TV.

Mating in Captivity by Esther Perel explores how couples maintain desire and connection long term. Perel argues that healthy relationships balance intimacy with separateness. You need to remain interesting individuals, not just merged units. It's provocative and will challenge how you think about closeness.

Validate before you problem solve

When your partner vents, they usually want to feel heard, not fixed. Men especially struggle with this (research backs it up). Before offering solutions, try that sounds really frustrating or I can see why you'd feel that way. Validation doesn't mean agreement. It means acknowledging their emotional reality.

The app Paired sends daily questions to you and your partner about everything from conflict styles to intimacy preferences. It sparked conversations we'd never had organically after years together. Sometimes you need prompts to go deeper.

Another resource worth checking out is BeFreed, an AI learning app that pulls from relationship psychology books, research papers, and expert insights to create personalized audio content. A friend at Google mentioned it, and honestly, it's been helpful for connecting all these concepts. You type in something like improve emotional communication in relationships and it generates a structured learning plan with podcasts tailored to your specific situation, whether you struggle with conflict or emotional vocabulary. 

The depth control is useful too, you can do a quick 10minute overview or go deep for 40 minutes with real examples from relationship experts and case studies. It includes most of the books mentioned here, plus therapy frameworks and communication research. The voice options make commute learning actually bearable; some are calm and reflective, others more conversational.

Work on your own shit

You can't build emotional intelligence in a relationship if you don't have it individually. Therapy, journaling, meditation, whatever helps you understand your own patterns and triggers. Your partner isn't responsible for healing your wounds. They'll just keep poking them until you do.

Emotionally intelligent relationships aren't about never fighting or always feeling connected. They're about knowing how to come back together when you drift apart. Because you will drift. Everyone does. The question is whether you have the skills to find each other again.",1,1769510551.0,MenInModernDating,0,1.0,False

1qoaeoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1qoaeoo/the_sciencebased_framework_that_helped_me_go_from/,The Science-Based Framework That Helped Me Go From Chronic Procrastinator to MACHINE,"I used to be the person who'd spend 6 hours ""preparing"" to study and then never actually study. Felt like absolute garbage about it too. Turns out procrastination isn't a personality flaw, it's a nervous system thing. After reading way too many books and listening to a ridiculous amount of podcasts on this, I figured out what actually works.

This isn't about ""just do it"" BS or toxic productivity culture. It's about understanding why your brain resists tasks and working WITH it instead of against it.

**The real reason you procrastinate**

Procrastination is emotional avoidance, not laziness. Your brain associates the task with negative emotions (stress, fear of failure, boredom, overwhelm) so it finds literally anything else to do. Dr. Tim Pychyl's research shows procrastination is mood repair, we choose short term mood improvement over long term goals.

Understanding this changed everything for me. I wasn't broken. My brain was just trying to protect me from discomfort.

**Make the task less threatening**

Your brain procrastinates because tasks feel too big, too vague, or too scary. Breaking them down removes the threat.

* **The 2 minute rule:** Make your task so small it feels ridiculous. Don't ""write essay"", just ""open document"". Your brain is WAY more likely to start something that feels manageable.
* **Set a timer for 15 minutes:** This is from *The Now Habit* by Neil Fiore (psychologist who literally wrote THE book on procrastination after struggling with it himself during his PhD). The book is honestly life changing, he explains how guilt and pressure make procrastination worse. Once you start the timer, you can stop after 15 minutes guilt free. Usually you keep going because starting is the hardest part.

**Create external structure**

Your brain can't regulate itself when it's overwhelmed, so you need external scaffolding.

* **Body doubling:** Work alongside someone else, even virtually. There's something about another person's presence that keeps you accountable. I use an app called Focusmate where you get paired with a stranger for 50 minute work sessions. Sounds weird but it's insanely effective.
* **Temptation bundling:** Pair something you need to do with something you want to do. This is from behavioral economist Katherine Milkman's research. Like only listening to your favorite podcast while doing dishes or only getting your fancy coffee while studying at the cafe.

**The insight timer app** is incredible for this too. They have focus music and timed meditation sessions. Sometimes I'll do a 5 minute meditation before starting work just to calm my nervous system down. When you're less activated, you procrastinate less.

BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app that creates personalized audio content from expert research, books, and talks. The team at Columbia built it specifically for people who want structured growth without endless scrolling. What makes it different is the adaptive learning plan feature. You tell it your struggle, like ""I procrastinate on important projects,"" and it pulls science-based strategies from psychology research and productivity experts, then builds a plan that evolves as you progress.

You can customize everything. Quick 10-minute summaries when you're tired, or 40-minute deep dives with real examples when you want to understand the mechanisms behind procrastination. The voice options are genuinely addictive too, there's even a sarcastic style that makes complex behavioral science way easier to digest during your commute.

**Compassion over discipline**

This is the most important part. Dr. Kristin Neff's research on self compassion shows that being kind to yourself when you mess up actually makes you MORE likely to follow through next time, not less. Beating yourself up just triggers more avoidance.

I started treating myself like I'd treat a friend who's struggling. ""You're having a hard time starting, that's ok, let's just do 5 minutes."" It sounds cheesy but it genuinely works better than the harsh drill sergeant approach.

**Address the underlying stuff**

Sometimes procrastination is a symptom of something bigger.

* **ADHD:** If you've tried everything and still can't start tasks, consider getting evaluated. Procrastination is a hallmark ADHD symptom. The book *Driven to Distraction* by Ned Hallowell completely changed how I understood my brain.
* **Perfectionism:** If you procrastinate because you're scared it won't be perfect, read *The Gifts of Imperfection* by Bren茅 Brown. She's a research professor who studies shame and vulnerability. The book helped me realize that perfectionism is just fear wearing a fancy outfit.
* **Burnout:** Sometimes you procrastinate because you're genuinely exhausted and need rest, not more productivity hacks. *Burnout* by Emily and Amelia Nagoski explains the science behind this. They talk about how stress gets trapped in your body and you need to physically complete the stress cycle through movement, crying, laughing, creative expression, etc. Game changer.

**Therapy helps too.** I started working with a therapist who specializes in productivity issues and it helped me understand the emotional roots of my procrastination. Turns out I was using it as a way to avoid feeling inadequate. Once I processed that, the procrastination got way better.

**Track without judgment**

I use a habit tracker (the Finch app is cute for this, it's a little bird that grows as you complete habits). But I track to notice patterns, not to shame myself. Like ""oh I always procrastinate on Tuesdays, maybe that's when I'm most tired and need easier tasks.""

The goal isn't to become some emotionless productivity robot. It's to understand your patterns and design your life around them instead of fighting against your nature constantly.

You're not lazy. Your nervous system is just doing what it thinks will keep you safe. Once you understand that, you can start building systems that actually work for YOUR brain.",1,1769510298.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False
