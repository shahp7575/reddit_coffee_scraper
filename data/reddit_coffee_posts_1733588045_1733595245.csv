1h8yc7s,https://i.redd.it/5tq5qa2svg5e1.jpeg,What’s your favorite tea and why?,"I personally always said Earl grey is my favorite, even I do drinked mainly with milk, I will use like two fingers of water to make my tea (loose leaves), let it sit a bit longer than a regular tea and add hot milk. At work we have tea bags so I will choose for latte macchiato in our coffee machine and stop it before the shot of espresso comes, and then add honey. I learn this of Earl grey with milk and honey from a Japanese girl I follow on YouTube, sometimes she will melt chocolate too, a fantasy. 
Lately I am a lot into Oolong tea, is very earthy, that’s the reason why most people may dislike it if they are more into fruity teas but I think that’s the part that I enjoy, same reason why I like matcha, if I buy matcha in a café I will drink it with milk so it is creamy, but I go for no sugar because I don’t like it when is sweetened.

1h8yb0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan_travel/comments/1h8yb0k/guide_to_eating_vegan_in_bogota_colombia/,Guide to eating vegan in Bogota Colombia,"I love exploring vegan cuisines and I've come to realize that people aren't aware of how awesome Colombian vegan food is, especially Bogota vegan food. Much like New York city, it is known for being open minded and cosmopolitan, and because of this it is the most vegan city in Colombia.

Vegan Colombian food is some of the most underrated vegan food there is, the country has an insane amount of exotic fruits, nuts, vegetables, grains & legumes, I'm so impressed with how Colombian vegans find creative ways to use local produce. I'm talking about savory salsas made from [tomate de arbol](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solanum_betaceum), smoothie bowls with[ inchi sacha](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plukenetia_volubilis) nut and [maqui](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotelia_chilensis) berry, [arepa boyacense](https://www.colombia.com/gastronomia/recetas-colombianas/arepa-boyacense-r1148) stuffed with tofu instead of cheese, Colombian vegan food has flavors you won't find outside the region.

This list is fully vegan places, but there are also places that serve just 1 or 2 good vegan options worth trying, so don't hesitate to try other places, also this list is just some vegan places I like, there are tons more in the city.

**Restaurants:**

[Pura Vida -](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pura+Vida+veggie+and+vegan/@4.7187069,-74.0738357,14z/data=!4m10!1m2!2m1!1spura+vida!3m6!1s0x8e3f9ba53a9049c1:0x39d4deeccbb31dde!8m2!3d4.7187069!4d-74.0357269!15sCglwdXJhIHZpZGFaCyIJcHVyYSB2aWRhkgEKcmVzdGF1cmFudOABAA!16s%2Fg%2F11mgv1ptww?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTIwNC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) Recently relocated to Calle 140, Pura Vida an Australian/Colombian fusion place that does great vegan burgers and great brunch. Vibe is that of a trendy brunch spot, does a really nice scramble tofu with arepa and have smoothies made with all kinds of exotic fruit like [lulo](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solanum_quitoense) and [gulupa](https://procolombia.co/colombiatrade/exportador/articulos/gulupa-la-fruta-exotica-con-la-que-colombia-se-destaca-en-el-mercado-global). They have a similarly great sister location called Puro Zumo just up the road a bit further heading west.

[La Madriguera, Alimentación Consciente ](https://www.google.com/maps/place/La+Madriguera,+Alimentaci%C3%B3n+Consciente/@4.6320753,-74.0727363,18.49z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x8e3f9baa8d3affaf:0x5b148c071d62d1bc!8m2!3d4.6319281!4d-74.0723118!16s%2Fg%2F11g8b2wm01?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTIwNC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)\- Moving down to the student centric neighborhood of Parkway is a very local punk type of place that serves vegan burgers and a set menu of the day. If the last place is to expensive for you then you'll like this place because it's much cheaper. Bonus points, they're around the corner from the amazing coffee spot, [Bogota Coffee Roasters](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bogota+Coffee+Roasters/@4.631511,-74.0752312,16.62z/data=!4m8!3m7!1s0x8e3f9a2c0a96d215:0x7a4d6afbf1aab9e9!8m2!3d4.631837!4d-74.0725483!9m1!1b1!16s%2Fg%2F11gdfg2sw9?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTIwNC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D), which offers vegan cakes and excellent coffee options.

[Restaurante Vegetariano El Champiñón](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Vegetarian+restaurant+El+Champi%C3%B1%C3%B3n/@4.6035345,-74.0754408,17.51z/data=!4m10!1m2!2m1!1svegan!3m6!1s0x8e3f99a109fc14c7:0x935d1f3c1df18314!8m2!3d4.604347!4d-74.0732122!15sCgV2ZWdhbloHIgV2ZWdhbpIBFXZlZ2V0YXJpYW5fcmVzdGF1cmFudOABAA!16s%2Fg%2F1tfjxb7y?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTIwNC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) \- If you're visiting Bogota as a tourist then you are probably going to visit the gold museum, just 2 blocks away is Restaurante Vegetariano El Champiñón. Don't be fooled by the name, this place is vegan, Colombians often use the word vegan and vegetarian interchangeably. This a what Colombians call a ""corrientazo"", meaning a cheap lunch spot. If you want to try food that strongly resembles what a typical Colombian eats for lunch (only vegan) this is that kind of place. The bandeja paisa, (a typical Medellin dish) is great.

[SOY VIDA GALERÍAS -](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Galer%C3%ADas+Mall/@4.6426764,-74.0739605,17.51z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x8e3f9a34f3b56e65:0xe74f83a9e8a9721f!8m2!3d4.6427765!4d-74.0751015!16s%2Fg%2F1ptwm90cj?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTIwNC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) Located near the large shopping mall of Galerías, this is another corrientazo place. Very affordable with large portions, expect to find typical Colombian food here but made vegan, such as ajiaco as a starter, with seasoned seitan with patacón and salad as a main, they only serve a couple set menus of the day. They also sell vegan products such as nutritional yeast.

[Restaurante Vegano Cardamomo -](https://www.google.com/maps/@4.7253699,-74.0663275,14.72z?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTIwNC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) My favorite vegan place in Bogota, located up north near the neighborhood Colina, they are very creative with their use of ingredients. Each day for lunch they have rotating set menus, all of which are great, they also have vegan breakfast and a few permanent lunch menu items. I would describe their food as very fresh, healthy, and heavily based in local exotic produce that you won't likely find outside the country, for this reason I find Cardamomo to be the most unique place on this list.

[De Raíz Cocina Café](https://www.google.com/maps/place/De+Ra%C3%ADz+Cocina+Caf%C3%A9/@4.6930616,-74.050683,16z/data=!4m15!1m8!3m7!1s0x8e3f909e88bf0583:0xcee402e0b005bc73!2sChapinero,+Bogot%C3%A1,+Bogota!3b1!8m2!3d4.6548153!4d-74.0552684!16zL20vMGYzZzZq!3m5!1s0x8e3f9bf52e445b75:0x9f1bbac08193c1b8!8m2!3d4.6930616!4d-74.050683!16s%2Fg%2F11fk535_sk?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTIwNC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) \- One of the oldest vegan places in the city, so it must be mentioned in a vegan Bogota list, they offer a wide variety of menu options ranging from pizzas to croquettes to soups to burgers, all vegan. But in my opinion their best food items are their baked goods and desserts. They also have a small store up front at the entrance of the restaurant.

**Food Stores:**

[Sabyi](https://sabyi.com/) \- Wonderful local vegan food store that's been around since the 90s, they have a physical location but they deliver all over Bogota, good place to buy tofu and other vegan protein, their vegan bacon is delicious.

[El Manjar Vegano](https://www.elmanjar.com.co/?v=ab6c04006660) \- Another great vegan food store, fully online, I highly recommend the vegan quinoa empanadas.

Carulla - Carulla is a higher end grocery store chain and these days most of them carry a small vegan section as well as vegan milks in the milk section. You can find this chain all over eastern Bogota. The prices here are higher than the other 2 store but it works if you need to grab groceries quickly.

Other - black beans, kidney beans, black eyed peas, and quinoa are staples in Colombia and can be found in most grocery stores. Nuts can be bought from nut specialty stalls, often found in outdoor shopping malls, fruterías sell basically any produce you could want. If you have a stove you can cook fully vegan meals just from common staple ingredients.

**Honorable mention:**

Cali - The city of Cali also has a wonderful vegan scene particularly around the San Antonio neighborhood.

Over coffee recently at work, a co-worker (female) and I started discussing the men’s rights movement after a rather heated date that she had with a man who expressed himself as a ""men's rights advocate."" We discussed the “Manosphere,” particularly MGTOW (Men Going Their Own Way). While she isn’t a reader of Critical Theory, she made an interesting observation about how these movements often frame relationships as purely transactional—a kind of economic exchange devoid of deeper emotional or social ties.

It got me thinking about the broader effects of capitalism on modern relationships, especially in the context of these “male rights” phenomena. Are there any works or articles that critically examine this intersection? I’d love to explore more on how capitalism shapes or even distorts our intimate and sexual lives, particularly when viewed through the lens of these movements.

I live in a small one-bedroom apartment, and while I didn’t have a lot of space, I figured it would be fine since we’re family. Before he arrived, I told him he could sleep on the couch and to make sure he cleaned up after himself because I can’t stand clutter. He agreed.

The first few days were okay, but after that, I started noticing little things. He’d leave his shoes by the door, his bag near the couch, and sometimes a few dishes in the sink if he didn’t wash them right away. I reminded him to clean up a few times, but he would apologize and say he’d get to it, which he usually did within a couple of hours. Still, it annoyed me.

After about a week, I snapped. He left a half-full water glass on the coffee table while he was in the shower, and I’d had enough. When he got out, I told him he was being disrespectful, that he clearly didn’t appreciate my hospitality, and that maybe he should find somewhere else to stay. He looked stunned and said he didn’t realize it was such a big deal. He left that evening and went to stay with a friend.

Now my parents are upset with me, saying I overreacted and that he didn’t deserve to be kicked out over something so minor. I still feel like he wasn’t respecting my space.

AITA for kicking my brother out over small messes?

I jointed and planed the boards to clean them up before they made their way into the oven, well above what I needed their final dimensions to be. At this point they are all about 1x5x24 and pretty flat. After a few hours in the oven to raise the internal temp to 130, many of the boards came out with a slight warp to them, enough that I’ll need to run them through the jointer and planer again before use. That’s all fine, I left them big for a reason! 

My question is, do I need to let the boards reacclimate to my (dry, but currently pretty frigid) shop before re-dimensioning? Or are boards out of the “kiln” good to dimension and glue up right away?

Following the instructions from the Bull, she blindfolds him and quickly ties his ankles securely to the foot of the bed before unlocking the chastity cage. 

“Big day today, maid. All those changes my sister is going to help us achieve are going to happen,” she says sweetly.

As the chastity cage is slid from his dick, he feels his wife thoroughly clean his dick and balls with a warm cloth. The groggy maid’s mind, not the brightest at the best of times because of his continuous feelings of arousal, suddenly wakes.

Today! Miss Nicole! The lawyer. Oh my God. No, he has to stop it.

“Mistress,” he starts.

She is already sliding onto his member the cruel spiked chastity cage. “Yes, Honey?”

“I thought we were going to talk about these things?”

With the unique key, she turns the complex tumblers of the lock so it tightens around the maid’s scrotum with the spikes immediately touching the retreating dick.

He pulls helplessly on the steel cuffs as, in the darkness of the blindfold, he feels his wife release the ties on his legs.

Placing the key in her kimono pocket she undoes the blindfold.

“Oh my God, do you look gorgeous in that little ice blue set? We need to get you more like that. You look so adorable in them.”

“But Mistress, I thought we were going to discuss it all and …”

She kisses his cute nose to shut her maid up.

“Now don’t you worry your little head. Your Master and I have explored all this. And we have chatted with your Miss Nicole on the phone. Obviously, we discussed it with the children. It is important that they are part of decision making in Sir’s household. He wants his children to become confident in the ways of the world.”

What? She has discussed it with his Master, his children and her sister in law, but not with him!

“Mistress, I can’t help feeling that …”

Suddenly he is in the room.

Big, grizzled, not yet shaven, wearing a thick blue bathrobe over his hairy body.

“Hey you two. What a day ahead eh?”

Avery puts her arms around his neck and gives him a big kiss. 

“It’s so exciting, Sir. Maid and I were just chatting about it.”

Now is William’s opportunity to let the Bull know they should talk this through before making legally binding changes to the household.

“Erm, Master,” William speaks tentatively, his arse still burning because of his Master’s whipping from the previous evening.

Taking hold of the cuck’s wife, in a firm proprietorial grip, the Bull says, “What is it, Honey?” Then his bushy eyebrows meet as he stares at the sissy’s groin with displeasure.

Oh no, William wonders if the chastity cage isn’t properly secured. It is horrible for the maid when his Master’s manner becomes impatient.

“Slut,” he says softly to Avery. “Your maid’s pubes. I asked for them to be in a neat Brazilian above her little dick.”

Avery is worried, “Sorry, Sir. I hadn’t noticed. The hairs are growing back so quickly.”

“I told you I wanted her pussy trim and neat like yours!”

“Yes, Sir, sorry sir. I think we need to wax it like mine. Make it sweet and smooth. You like that, Sir.”

“Then do it!” orders Marvin.

“Yes, Sir,”

Avery flees from the room while the bull continues to grimace at the sorry state of the pubic hairs of his maid.

“Maid don’t let me have to tell your Mistress or you again about that! I want my maid to look the part, even under her skirt.”

“Yes, Master, of course. Please Master, about today. I was sort of thinking …”

He waves a dismissive hand. “It’s all taken care of. You just don’t embarrass me in front of Avery’s snooty sister.

William giggles at his Master calling Nicole snooty.

“Yes, Master. But it is so much to change. I mean changing my name like that …”

A busy Avery returns with a box from which she takes two wax strips.

“This is going to hurt, Honey,” she says, wincing in sympathy. “It’s the sort of things we girls have to put up with to look nice.”

William’s dick expands in the tube at the thought that he is doing things that girls do. But the spikes quickly put him into his place.

“But Mistress, I think …”

The cold gluey strips are pressed either side of what will be the landing strip on his groin.

Watching with interest a scene he has never before witnessed, Marvin says, “Maid, it is all sorted. You just stand there looking pretty and vacant. You’re good at that.”

Avery and William giggle.

“But my name, Master. You can’t really change it …”

Avery presses the wax strips hard, saying, “I’ve been thinking of her name, Sir.”

William closes his eyes with relief. He most certainly doesn’t want his name legally changed!

“What about it?” Martin asks still fixed on the strips above the ice blue frilly panties.

“Well,” Avery says carefully, not wishing to enrage her Bull. “Honey is a sort of nick name, isn’t it?”

The Bull shrugs, apparently unconcerned. He is looking forward to seeing the results of the strips being removed.

Avery continues. “I like Willa though. How about Willa, Emily Thane. I think that is really pretty. We can still call her Honey.”

William is shocked. Willa? Emily? And then his Master’s surname?

“Mistress, I …”

Avery says, “Hush, maid. Your Master has to make a decision.”

With all eyes on him, Marvin shrugs. What does he care. “Yeh sure. If it were up to me, it would be Emily Birdbrain.”

Avery laughs and gives her lover a peck on his cheek.

“Thank you, Sir.” She grips the ends of the wax strips, “Deep breath Willa.”

William’s scream wakes the children … it can also be heard in the street.

But the result is worth it!

Two slightly inflamed, but beautifully smooth strips line either side of his landing strip.

William smiles, it looks so good.

Avery has a pair of scissors and is trimming the narrow strip of pubes. 

“What do you think, Sir.”

The Bull’s grunt is one of approval. 

“Yeh, love it.”

\*

Breakfast is a flurry of activity, as Avery and Marvin need the kids to be off to school so that Nicole can arrive and run through the changes for the household.

Amy and Heather chatter brightly away at the breakfast table while, as usual, Marvin and Avery are encamped at their usual table near the patio doors.

Avery picks up her phone and the recipient answers quickly.

Avery says, “Oh Nicole. Hi. Listen, about this morning.”

The mere mention of Nicole, Avery’s aggressive, kick arse sister is enough to throw William’s mind into turmoil. Fear nibbles at his tummy as he listens carefully to every word of the call while feeding Amos. Nicole never lost a moment to bully William even before he became the maid.

Avery is saying, “It’s her name. I don’t like it. Honey. Well, I do like it. But what I want is her name to be Willa, Emily Thane. Oh, don’t give me that. You can change it … Well, yes Honey is a lovely name but …”

At that moment, little Heather says, “Maid! Pour me more juice.”

A shocked William sees that the jug of juice is right next to his six year old daughter. This is outrageous. First, she should be saying please and second, why doesn’t she just pour her own damn juice? Can’t she see that William is busy feeding the baby?

The sissy cuck presses down his maid’s uniform with his palms and turns on the little madam, to make a point, the way a parent does.

“Heather,” William starts, with a fixed sweet smile.

Heather taps her glass with her cereal spoon, “Quickly maid!”

Nibbling his lip in anger, William does as commanded, ensuring that he doesn’t spill any and further anger his child.

It is only then that he realises that Avery has hung up and is rolling her eyes at her lover, who shakes his head in sympathy but is too engrossed in a business text to say anything.

Damn. Now, William doesn’t know what was said about his name in the call.

William is getting used to the fact that, yes, maid’s outfits are sexy to wear and swanning around looking cute is arousing, but the downside is a maid can never do as she wishes. In this case trying to listen in on her Mistress’ conversation proved useless.

Suddenly, Marvin is on his feet, pulling on his suit jacket. The signal to everyone in the family to stir into action.

Within a minute the kids are pulling on their coats and collecting their school bags in the hall. The juice that Heather so insisted William pour is still filling her glass on the table. 

As soon as Avery ushers the children through the front door to the car, William hurriedly fetches the paddle with the drilled holes from the drawer in the kitchen.

As he hands it to the Master of the house and bends over, he says:

“Master, before Miss Nicole arrives should we go over some points?”

The grinning Bull loves seeing the sissy cuck automatically fetching the paddle and submitting to the spanking. For a dominant to see a sub learn her new position in life so that it becomes unconsciously second nature, is an erotic joy. He flips up the back of the maid’s dress, seeing a pair of cream frilly panties with light blue edging. Through the panties can be seen the angry red wheals from his whipping.

It is a sight to behold.

Marvin is looking forward to making this all permanent. Him Master of the house, father of the children, husband to his slut and proud owner of this sexy, dumb sissy maid.

He taps the paddle gently against the sore bum before him, loving how the maid winces already, before any major blows have landed.

After four spanks, William jumps from the pain, rubbing his arse through his panties. He immediately sees he has done wrong and falls back into the bending over position.

“Maid,” Marvin announces, “I am in such a good mood I am not going to give you additional spanks for being so naughty. How about that?”

“Oh, thank you, Master.” William is genuinely grateful for his Master’s kindness. “I didn’t mean to stand. It was just that after last night’s beating …”

Two quick whacks and the maid stops prattling.

Silent and cute, just as Marvin likes his maid.

“Stand up maid,” Marvin commands watching the maid spring to attention, her eyes blurry from tears. “I want you to make sure that downstairs is neat and tidy when Nicky comes round.”

“Yes, Master of course, Master.”

“I want Amos neatly turned out. You got it?”

“Yes, Master. I promise.”

Marvin hands the paddle to the maid, who urgently follows him, clip clopping on her heels, the bells of her collar jingling.

“Master, sorry to trouble you, but I can’t help thinking that, with all these changes you’ve proposed, and I do understand why, and with all that you want to achieve that ...”

Marvin closes the front door on the maid, inflated with elation at his new power. He sees the delightful kids in the car smiling and waving to him. Those children who will soon be his. Avery is standing next to the open car door, ready to give the keys to her Alpha male to drive his family to the school.

Could life get any better for a dominant male?











40.	



The doorbell is insistent.

William has only just got Amos relaxed in his chair with his toys and is hoping for a coffee break. Besides, no way is he going to answer the door dressed as maid!

Yet the bell chimes again and again. Seeming to the troubled maid that it is somehow becoming louder. 

He carefully raises the slats and can just about see the impatient figure on the front door.

Nicole! Already. She is early. Her ginger, almost orange hair glowing like a warning beacon above her stern features.

Suddenly his pulse is thumping inside his head. The sight of the  kick arse sister of Avery is always terrifying. But with her standing impatiently at his front door, in a neat tight blue trouser suit carrying a laptop and some folders, he knows that her arrival has consequences for him and his family.

Oh God!

No way can William face the tyrannical sister without Avery around to protect him. He skips down so he is out of sight below the windowsill.

The bell has fallen silent, and William holds his breath. He jumps when his phone sounds.

He takes it from his apron pocket and answers hoping it is Avery coming to rescue him.

He says, “Hi.”

The voice on the other hand is prickly, mad, and undeniably that of Nicole. “Don’t hi me, idiot. Get your lazy arse to the front door. Right now.”

Oh no.

William crouches on his heels, feeling his suspenders stretch over his thighs.

“Sorry, Miss Nicky, I mean, Miss Nicole. Mistress and Master are out right now …”

“If you don’t open this fucking door then I’m gonna ring your Master. You want that?”

No! He dashes over the freshly polished wood of the hallway, slipping on his heels before snatching open the door.

Catching his breath he says, “Sorry, Miss Nicole I thought …”

She forces her way in, effortlessly brushing him back against the wall.

“Dumb arsed maid.”

“Yes, Miss Nicole. Sorry Miss Nicole.”

“Where we holding this meeting? I need to get set up.”

“Erm, I don’t know. Sitting room maybe?”

“Well take my papers!”

She forces into his hands a pile of folders, and sets off to the sitting room, her heels clipping like gunshots across the polished wood.

Only when she settles on the sofa and opens her laptop does the frenzy stops. She takes a long look up and down at the fetching maid, from her heels, up her legs, over her hips, across her small boobs to her cute face and hair.

“And don’t you look a sight! Like, wow!”

She laughs unpleasantly shaking William. It is so humiliating to be attired as a domestic maid before a woman who never regarded him very highly, and never lost an opportunity to bully him.

“Thank you, Miss Nicole,” William says through his dry mouth.

“You know, Honey or what ever they are going to name you, I can’t wait for my maid to look like you. This sissy your Master found me has a lot going for her, but fuck, she is hard work to train. And looks nowhere as good as you.”

Should he thank her again? He decides to keep silent, which is always wise for a maid when in doubt.

Nicole removes her jacket and lays it over the back of the sofa.

William’s instinct is to pick it up, tidy it and hang it on the coat cupboard, but he feels as if he is no maid’s land with Nicole. It is best just to leave it there. But oh my it disturbs his maid senses. He so much wants to tidy it away.

“Put down my folders and give me a twirl, maid.”

“Yes, Miss Nicole.”

He relaxes when given an instruction. At least William knows where he is when obeying a command. Having placed the folders neatly before Nicole, he turns around slowly for the aggressive lawyer to study him.

“See!” Nicole says, “Why can’t my maid be as elegant as that?”

Is the question rhetorical? Should he be answering? He fiddles with the hem of his apron.

“And look at you nervously fidgeting like a naughty child caught out by its parents. Fuck me. I could bend you over one of the chairs and peg the sense out of your arse right now.”

Peg him? William gasps.

She laughs. “Don’t worry. I’m not going to upset Avery or that big ape she’s found herself.”

He needs to change the subject.

“Would Miss Nicole like a coffee?”

She grins. “Oh you are wonderful. Yes, Miss Nicole would like a coffee! Fetch!”

“Yes, Miss Nicole.”

He walks back to the hallway and Nicole gives him a wolf whistle.

“Look at the fucking arse swaying on that!”

It is only when he reaches the kitchen that William is able to catch his breath. It is dreadful enough having Nicole lord it over him at family events, let alone now, when he is a subservient maid. Made worse by being terrified of her reporting him to Avery or Marvin for any shortcomings.

Fortunately, just as Williams starts the coffee machine, Avery and Marvin arrive home with a pile of packages. Suddenly William is relieved. He feels safe with his master and Mistress.

He presents himself in the hallway with his hands neatly on his apron.

“Master, Mistress. Miss Nicole awaits you in the sitting room. Would you like a coffee?”

Marvin turns his back on the maid, and it is a moment before the foolish maid realises what she is supposed to do. She remembers and pulls off his coat, before hanging it in the coat cupboard.

Avery grins and turns her back on the maid, for William to carry out the same procedure of removing his Mistress coat and hanging it neatly in the cupboard.

“Good, girl,” Avery says. “Two coffees, maid.” She leans in close. “I hope Nicky hasn’t been too cruel to you.”

“Erm, no, not at all, Mistress,” he lies.

It is as if his wife can read his mind like he has an instruction label stuck to him.

“Aw,” she kisses his cheek. “You are safe now I am here.”

William feels his heart melting. “Oh Mistress!” he kisses her cheek.

Moments later William carries the tray of coffees into the sitting room where Avery and Nicole appear to be talking at the same time with the same excited tones.

Nicole is talking about her sissy maid, “I mean he is slow at obeying. He sort of just stands there as if I what I’ve said is wrong. And he moves like a lorry driver not in a girly way like your Honey.”

William settles the tray on the coffee table aware that his Mistress has shared a secret smile with him, obviously proud of her maid.

Marvin says, “You got to tell ‘em. Nail ‘em down. This fairy,” he jabs his thumb at William, “Has always walked like a fairy.”

Avery laughs, “I guess that’s right.”

Nicole says, “But that arse wiggle of hers. I mean it is so divine.”

Avery says, “The heels help, and the outfit. She has a corset which pulls in the waist. So the hips look bigger, that helps too. The bow on the back bounces around on her arse. It all contributes.”

“My maid can barely walk,” Nicole grimaces. “She has got these crazy heels. Six inch. It is so cumbersome.”

Marvin pulls back his hefty shoulders. “Right. I don’t want to hear any more about your maid. Right? I know some women who can train them. And if you want a Bull to get you this sort of set up like your sister, then I know some guys.” Then as men, do, he starts the mansplaining, “You can’t start sissies off on very high heels. That’s crazy. They’ve got no idea. But, hey, let’s do the meeting. We’ve got loads to get through.”

Nicole nods, tapping on her keyboard.

“Let’s sort out the names business first.”

“We’d be better off in the dining room. Around the table,” Marvin declares as if it is obvious.

Nicole says, “The maid said the meeting would be in here.”

William takes a deep intake of breath and studies Marvin to see how he will react. Is he in trouble?

Fortunately, Marvin just laughs as he stands. “Well, if you’re going to listen to advice from the dumbest maid that’s ever lived then that’s your problem. Maids are good at looking cute and being obedient. Anything more than that and they are hopeless.” He lifts up his chin to look down on William. “Isn’t that right, maid?”

William nods enthusiastically, “Oh yes, Master. Totally right.”

Nicole and Avery laugh and even William smiles at the thought that his Master thinks he looks cute.

The Bull doesn’t even look at William when he says, “Maid, get all this stuff onto the dining room table.”

“Yes Master.”

William gathers the folders and makes off to the hallway.

“Oh!” Nicole says. “My sissy maid doesn’t obey me like that. She sort of pauses before she obeys.”

Even from the dining room, William hears Marvin say, “You have to educate them. Dumb as bunny rabbits, the lot of them.”

The two women giggle and William smiles at the Bull’s joke, as he lays out the folders on the table.

Nicole enters first carrying her laptop, quickly followed by Avery and Marvin.

Nicole says, “And you should see her maid’s outfit! It’s like something from a sex store. Totally stupid. I mean it’s sexy enough,” she laughs, “but I love your maid’s outfits. It is so real.”

Another compliment! William loves hearing the stern Nicole praise his maid’s uniform and steps back allowing them all to seat themselves around the table, with Marvin at the head of the table – obviously.

Avery says, “I’m not telling you where we got it. You have to find your own shop. Just get a genuine uniform not a sex shop one.”

Marvin puts up his hands, “Right, ladies, stop the gassing. We’ve got a lot to get through.”

Avery, Nicole and William have a discreet smile at the Bull taking charge of them.

“Okay, Nicole,” Marvin says, “where do we start?”

“Names!” Nicole proclaims. “So we can do the signatures on the main documents.” She looks to Avery, “so you want Willa – Emily - Thane? Not Honey?”

Avery smiles at her troubled maid, “Honey will be a nickname for her. I like Willa, it is almost short for his old name, William. And Emily is so girly. Suits him.”

William feels his tummy turning over. They are changing his name!

He knows he shouldn’t interrupt, but he has to say something. 

“Erm, Mistress …”

Suddenly, Avery has that tight impatient expression he has come to fear. “Hush, Honey! We’re busy.”

Nicole grins wickedly at the blushing maid, loving the fact that William can be shut up so easily.

“So,” the lawyer says, “you are changing all surnames in the house to that of Marvin’s here. Thane?”

Looking uncertainly at her dominant Bull, Avery says, “Yes. That’s what we’ve decided.”

Nicole nods and starts typing on her laptop. “Okay. All name changes must be held for at least a month. So no big deal if you want to change them after four weeks. But not before.”

William closes his eyes with relief. He would only have to put up with the indignity of his girly names for a few weeks. Then once all this was over, he could change them back. He almost says, ‘phew’ out loud. But obviously dares not.

Nicole pauses typing to stare at Marvin, “So, do you want Avery to know the password?”

Marvin says, “What password?”

Nicole says, “Names are registered via the Government’s website for deed poll changes. Obviously, you won’t want your maid to have access to that. But do you want your woman to be able to do it?”

William chews his lip. Marvin’s woman? Avery is William’s wife, not that of this bully! 

Marvin draws in a breath with a long thought. “Well I sort of like the fact that Avery has my surname, and my kids. It makes her mine. So, only I’ll have the password. Don’t like the idea of Avery changing it in the heat of some irrational rage. You know what you women are like when you get annoyed.”

William takes in his wife’s reaction. Obviously, she’ll object. She couldn’t possibly leave all control to this overbearing thug.

Licking her lips, Avery’s eyes half close, as if in sexual ecstasy.

“I agree,” she says at last. “Sir is man of the house. It is for him to decide on these matters.”

What?

William is shocked. Doesn’t she realise this will put all their names into the hands of the egomaniac who is controlling them all? 

With a laugh, Nicole starts typing. “Brilliant. Love it. I’m going to do the same with my maid!”

The flame haired, badass lawyer twists the laptop so that only Marvin can see it. “That’s your password there.”

He nods and she turns it back out of sight of the Mistress of the House and her maid.

Avery feels herself grow uncomfortably damp between her legs as the powerful male at the head of the table brings onto himself more control over her and her household.

“Just hold your horses, girls,” Marvin says, with that quiet authority of his.

The maid and the two women hang eagerly onto his next words.

He thumbs back at the maid standing behind him. “You want to change her name to Willa, Emily Thane, yeh?”

Avery looks uncertain. “Well, I think so.”

Marvin grimaces his displeasure. “Your maiden name is Bailey, isn’t it?”

“Yes,” Avery says, unsure where her Bull is running with this idea.

“So why not scrub Emily and use Bailey. That’s a nice feminine name and it makes her more yours. Like her new surname makes her mine.”

William’s eyes widen in shock. They are discussing the changing of his name, and he isn’t even allowed any input.

With eyebrows raised in surprise, it is a moment before Avery smiles. “Oh my God. That is brilliant Sir. Nicky, make her new name Willa, Bailey Thane!”

Nicole’s laugh is ugly and twists poor William’s gut.

He needs to say something, but a gleeful Nicole is already hammering her keyboard.

“Okay. So William, Arnold Fallow no longer exists,” Nicole says, grinning at a disturbed William. “She is now Willa, Bailey Thane. Such a pretty name.”

William, now Willa, Bailey Thane, feels a cold hand grip his tummy. A huge, humbling change has been forced up on him. And there is nothing he can do about it! 

Nicole’s eyes shine as she says to the alarmed maid, “And Willa, you need to know that should you try and use your old name, for any reason, then you will be brought before the courts for fraud.”

Now William feels sick, his lips hang open.

The bruising businesswoman continues to grin, “And guess which lawyer will be delighted to prosecute you!”

An angry Avery says, “You stop terrifying my maid, right now! Willa won’t be doing anything naughty like pretending to be someone else, will you maid?”

He swallows, “Erm, no Mistress. But I wonder if …”

“Quiet maid,” Marvin says. Men never want to hear from girly girls when they are concentrating on important matters. “So now move onto my woman’s surname and that of my kids.”

Nodding, Nicole busies herself on the keyboard.

William is aghast. His wife and his three children are about to have their surnames changed from his to that of his wife’s lover!

His breathing intensifies. He needs to say something. To stop all this, but clearly, he, as the house maid, cannot interrupt.

A final theatrical push of the enter button, and Nicole announces, “Done!”

“Oh my God,” Avery says. “That is just, like, so hot!” She smiles at her lover, with her cheeks glowing pink. “I feel so owned.”

Marvin says, “Great. That was nice and easy! Now, Nicky, if you’ll excuse us, me and my woman are going to the bedroom for a while!”

As he makes to stand up, Nicole says, “Whoa stud! That’s just the start. We have a load of changes and paperwork to get through.”

William’s heart sinks. Never has he felt so powerless, being locked in a world over which he has no say.

Hi all,

I’ve been getting more into filter coffee recently and I’m looking to upgrade my grinder setup. I’d love some advice from the community here since I’m trying to find a grinder that matches my brewing style and flavor preferences. Here’s my situation:



My Coffee Journey and Brewing Setup



I started out enjoying flat whites and lattes but have shifted toward filter coffee. Currently, I’m using a Kalita Wave and a Deep 27 dripper. When I try coffee at shops, I’ve noticed I prefer Chemex brews for their sweet, smooth flavor over the sharper taste I’ve sometimes gotten with V60. For example, a washed Ethiopian on Chemex was rounder and more to my liking than on V60.



One of my most memorable coffee experiences was with my Lelit Bianca espresso machine. I pulled a long pre-infusion shot using San Jose Gesha Natural beans and made a latte that tasted like boozy cherry liquor, dark chocolate, and sweet almond. It was the most vivid coffee I’ve ever had and set a benchmark for clarity and sweetness I’d love to recreate in filter brews.



Current Grinders and Limitations



I’ve been using these grinders:



Niche Zero: Great for espresso, but it produces too many fines for filter coffee, clogging the drawdown and muddying the flavors.



Wilfa Uniform: I’ve revisited this grinder, but the grind consistency doesn’t feel good enough for excellent filter brews.



Aergrind: I’ve never liked it. It feels inconsistent, and the grind adjustment often shifts during use.



What I’m Looking For



I’m searching for a grinder that:



Provides clear flavor separation and sweetness, avoiding overly sour or sharp cups.



Works well across a variety of beans, from washed African coffees (sweet, fruity) to South American naturals (chocolatey, nutty, caramel).



Grinders I’m Considering



Pietro Grinder:



Known for outstanding clarity and uniformity.



My concern: Will it produce brews that are too clean or bright for my preferences? Can brewing adjustments (e.g., finer grind) bring back body and sweetness?



1Zpresso K-Ultra:



Offers clarity, sweetness, and versatility.



My question: Is it a big enough improvement over my Wilfa Uniform to justify buying?



1Zpresso KP6:



A more affordable option with impressive clarity, achieving about 85-90% of the Pietro’s performance.



KP6 + K-Ultra Combo:



This combo could offer flexibility, with the KP6 for super-clean cups and the K-Ultra for more rounded ones. Together, they cost about the same as the Pietro.



Experimenting with Fines



One idea I’m curious about: blending a small percentage of ultra-fine grounds (e.g., Turkish grind from the Niche) with super-clean grounds from a grinder like the Pietro. I wonder if this would add body and complexity while maintaining clarity. Has anyone tried this?



Questions for the Community



Does the Pietro allow enough flexibility to brew coffee with body and sweetness, or is it too clean and bright?



Is the K-Ultra different enough from the Wilfa Uniform to be worth buying?



Would getting both the KP6 and K-Ultra make sense for variety and cost-effectiveness?



Has anyone experimented with adding controlled fines to a clean grind? What were your results?



I’d love to hear your thoughts and experiences! Thanks so much for your help!

1h8xz5v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/1h8xz5v/small_ghost_boy/,Small Ghost Boy,"I'm 40 years old now, and this story happened to me when I was a child. I was in 5th grade at the time so it was about 30 years ago but I remember it like yesterday. Very vividly. I had never before seen a ghost, and thankfully have never seen one again, and do not wish to. 

I had maternal grandparents that lived about 7 hours away from us, we would drive and visit a couple times a year. My grandfather was an early riser, up well before the sun. When we would stay there, my siblings and I would use sleeping bags on the living room floor, and our mom would sleep in the same room on the old green couch. This would mean that when my grandpa awoke I would typically hear him tooling around in the kitchen, that was just off the living room. He would always start coffee, leave the house, drive to the grocery store and come home with fresh donuts for us grandkids. I would wake up early and eat chocolate donuts and he would let me drink coffee. 

When I was in fifth grade he passed from cancer. We went up for the funeral service. It was your typical funeral experience. Everyone was terribly sad. The vibes were gloomy and low. There was a gathering in my grandparents house afterwards with food and relatives well into the night. After it ended we got to bed in our usual apots. 

I woke up to some loud noises coming from the kitchen in the middle of the night. I was disoriented and had no idea what time it was. Out of habit, and being tired, at first I assumed it was just grandpa waking up for the day, making coffee etc. Except normally when he did this he was quiet, and he would have the stovetop light glowing, sending some soft light into the living room. This time all the flourescent kitchen lights were on and the banging was loud like cupboards being slammed, dishes moving around. I looked to my mom and siblings, all still asleep, clearly not bothered at all by the noises. At this point I was really wide awake and realized it was not grandpa. He was not here anymore. The noises suddenly stopped. The light went out. I called out ""Grandma?"" Wondering if she was awake and having a hard time. Nothing. I kept my eye on the doorway into the kitchen. It was pitch black. I told myself I was just dreaming. Laid there for what seemed to be forever and tried to calm my racing heart. A feeling of terror just flooding me. Like a panic so severe I was paralyzed. I didn't want to move an inch. 

As I kept my focus on the doorway a shape began to materialize in the darkness there. It was a white shape hovering about three inches off the floor, and I couldn't tell what it was. I blinked and rubbed my eyes, trying to clear it away. I felt terrified. And frozen. I layed absolutely still, willing myself not to even breathe. The form slowly moved, floating etherally and slowly towards me. I have no idea how long this lasted. I hid my eyes and entire head inside my sleeping bag. I could hear my brothers and mom breathing peaceful sleeping breaths near me. Enough time passed and I told myself I would look out and see nothing. It was quiet and calm again. So I braved a look. At the end of my sleeping bag, stood, or actually hovered, a small boy who looked to be about 6 years old. He was wearing a white nightgown with long sleeves. He was hovering. He had no feet. In his hand was a metal candle holder, with a candle stick in it, that had a flame. The flame was not casting any light. It was blue. He had messy touseles of brown hair all around his pale face, and dark circles under his eyes. He looked very sick and very cold. He just hovered there. Staring at me. I once again covered my head, waited and looked back out. He remained there. No real expression on his face. I was scared out of my mind but I got a weird feeling that he was safe and not going to hurt me. It was odd. Like he was sending me into a trance. I started to stare into the blue flame on the candlestick. As my gaze got lost there, I suddenly had a feeling of fear and horror was over me again. I heard more loud banging from the kitchen. 

My mother was about 5 feet away on the couch. I mustered all my internal courage, as this thing hovered above me, it was like he could sense and anticipate that I wanted to get away from him and his features began to change. His eyes grew very very dark black, the circles under them became more pronounced and severe. I sprang from my sleeping bag looking over my shoulder at him, he began to come forward very quickly towards me and cried loudly 'MOM!"". I scrambled across the floor, crawling as fast as I could and reached my mother, shaking her and crying, waking her up in a panic. I couldn't even get more words out to tell her what was happening. As she woke up, I turned around to gesture towards my now empty sleeping bag, and the ghost boy was gone. I never saw him again. 

She assured me her childhood home had always been safe and fine. She had never seen anything like that. I snuggled up with her on the couch and went back to sleep. 

Fast forward years, I was a young adult and recounted this story to her. That house has been sold with my Grandmother passing too, and we don't go there anymore. She told me at the time she didn't want to scare me when I was little, but when she was a child she always felt a presence in her room at night, and once woke up there to the feeling of being pulled from her bed by her ankles. 

We don't know what it was or why it was there. I've never had another experience like it. And I hope I never do. ",3,1733593985.0,Ghoststories,0,1.0,False

First they stopped offering the ability to have their 5lb bags ground for espresso machines. The only option for espresso grinds now is the 12oz bags… which feels like a move to force people without an at home grinder into having 12oz subscriptions and spend more. Not very cool to hustle regular customers like that by having them pay more in smaller doses! 

Secondly I’ve had 2 instances where on their website I select grind 12oz box for espresso and the coffee arrives either ground for a drip machine or they just send me the whole beans. The second time this happened I’m 100% certain I selected having the beans ground for an espresso machine because they messed it up the first time but then when I checked my account and the email their website had specified whole bean. To me this is very strange And seems like there might be something wrong with their order fulfillment department.

Is anyone else out there also having these issues.. it’s enough to make me want to change where I get my coffee from. ",2,1733593834.0,espresso,0,1.0,False
1h8xwxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1h8xwxy/why_do_bad_things_happen_to_me/,Why do bad things happen to me?,"A week ago or so my friend who stopped talking to me much didnt want to be friends with me because apparently I broke her ""established"" boundaries, the only boundary I think I broke is touching on her. (shoulders was about it, I'd be like hey!) Nothing else. She never told me about boundaries, and We never talked about it. I forget alot so she'd tell me ""hey, dont touch me please"" and I would be like okay sorry, then move onto our conversation.

On friday- yesterday, In first period this guy sat a seat away from me. The teacher caught it and said that he was behind me, and that he wasn't in the right seat. The guy then complained that I stunk, (I took a shower, put on some deodorant and lightly sprayed some axe deodorant so I have no idea how that makes me stink) and He kept complaining behind me in my ear the whole period. We had a test and he kept whining in my ear about that too, then got caught passing notes.

 (Not to mention, I'm failing all of my core classes. I do my work in math, I have about 7 Missing assignments in science, and I'm failing history too and is on the Failure list which is failing core classes the first 9 weeks.)

The same day, these boys kept poking holes in their water bottle lids (they did the same thing on wednesday too, we didn't have any school thursday due to snow/too cold) and I kept looking at the mess. One boy had kept looking at me and wouldn't stop staring, which I find weird. I think he has a staring problem. But anyways, My friend then got up from her seat and went to the teacher. The two boys then proceeded to point the bottle at me. (I have heat damaged hair, And my hair is flattened. I use hot brushes and stuff so I'm very aware of water.) I then got scared but jokingly said 'helpp helpp' out to the teacher. She wasn't paying attention so I gestured to the teacher to the boys. I was very chill and feeling myself this day. I gestured to the teacher like a ""Look at this dude""-Shes not even looking up. (She was talking to my friend, so I can't blame her.) As soon As I turn back to the guys and blink, They quirt water onto me, and my $349 leather kühl jacket, which made me pissed. But I remembered that it was water. What really got me worked up was my hair, and I naturally have really curly and kinky hair, but since its damaged its 4a and 4b kind of. The teacher was beside of me (The classroom is this storage room, It's career class and there's wood and has pipes on the walls and ceiling- It's pretty big with a view of outside while classmates go out for gym.) She was working on this wooden thing and I asked her if I could go to the bathroom. She said I could, so I made a Smartpass and left. I originally went to the bathroom to beat up myself, and just everything around me, but I banged on the bathroom wall with one hand and my bracelet had broke, which was really pretty to me. It was beady and Teal and dark blue, the colors I plan to dye my hair one day. In first period I wanted to scream at the guy, but that was earlier. A teacher caught me and asked ""why are you beating up the bathroom, the bathroom didnt do anything to you."" My eyes was red because I was crying, not out of sadness but frustration. I was mad about everything. She kept asking me questions, I tried to let go of it and just let it be but she kept going. I had to tell her their names, what class I was in and what they did to me. They got in trouble I think and I stayed in the bathroom until class ended, I just wanted to go home. (6th was our last period) The Gym teacher came back to me and said ""You're in the same trouble they are."" Because I tried throwing  water back at them too. Mind you, I missed. Three. Fucking. Times. Every splash, every drip of water- Right on the floor. They got me drenched and my clothes wet, but I'm in the same trouble they are? Oh, Okay. I was so pissed that I started crying in her face again, But tried to cover it up and asked her if I could stay in the bathroom longer. She said yes, and I went until class ended, as I stated.

Now, today. To-fucking-day was probably the worst embarrassing day to me. I never wanted to kill myself more in the most brutalist way possible. I hate myself so much.

Okay, so, We had a christmas band parade today, and I came late. When I arrived, I asked my friend where was the stuff, and they said back there. Mind you, My friend is friends with my ex friend (The one i mentioned earlier, I was too touchy for her I guess, but thats how I express myself.) It was really cold. I didn't have anything on but a short sleeve adidas shirt and jeans. I went to the mini trailer and got my shit, but someone took my drumstick (ONE OF THEM, NOT EVEN THE OTHER. I swear, they're so fucking slow.) and I couldn't find my bag with my number on it that had my uniform in it. I was distraught. The parade was about to begin and I kept texting my mom, I was scared and frozen. Like, to the point where my skin turned light purple, my arms were ashy and felt as if the cold was piercing my skin. I was so scared, bro. I was like ""What if the band came back and saw me like this, thatd be so corny."" And as soon as I thought of that, about 10 seconds they did. The band came back from marching and one of them said ""I think your a bit late, Cory."" And clowned on me. I hid behind the trailer after that and Another member of the band came to me. He said ""Did you come late?"" I said yeah, and he replied with ""That's sad. We sounded okay. You better hide before Mrs. ____ gets mad at you."" I started walking and My mom found a parking place and yada yada yada, She yelled at me because her car isn't legal yet and that I needed to hurry up, but I had to wait until the band had passed. Some nice lady while I was waiting had came up to me and asked if I needed a jacket or something, and I said yeah. Another Nice old lady came up to me and gave me some candy that I couldn't get myself, not only was my hands unmoveable but I was just tired. Of everything. I couldn't stop thinking of ways how to kill myself after this.  I felt so bad for those two nice ladies, and I'm so sorry that I left her looking for a coat or something for me. I don't believe in god, but God bless her, and That woman who helped give me candy. I then went my way past the people from the parade and saw my friends mom (My friend from earlier, whos best friends with my ex friend) She confronted me and told me that I could wait in her car, she was cold anyway. I saw my moms car as soon as I started walking with her. I was so relieved and opened the car door, and Yelled ""Bye! Thank you"" two times, but she didnt reply. I went in my moms car and she kept yelling in my ear. She complained of how she didn't even get to make her coffee, feed herself or my little sister. Im glad she had picked me up, Because If I stayed there any longer, I would've killed myself. When we got home, she said ""Say thank you or something."" And I did.

SIDE NOTE: before I went to the parade I convinced myself it wasn't that cold. I was doing my hair and the thing crackled and the lights went out, and before that happened I clogged the toliet and had to unclog it. Last night I ruined my slime due to shaving cream and that bubble washing thing, and we have no glue.

I don't know what I did to deserve something like this. My hands are still defrosting now. Just a week ago, everything was nice and chill and now it's not. I've never wanted to kill myself more. I've tried going back to cutting but I don't think that'll do anything. I just want to get out of this mindset and go back to positive things again. Please help me.",0,1733593819.0,Advice,0,0.5,False

Anyway, my friend asked me if I wanted to go out bar hopping for my birthday. I thought about it all week and finally told her no. I am proud of myself for that. Instead, we are getting dinner and going to a pinball machine bar. I know, it’s a bar, but this was my idea and I couldn’t think of anything else I wanted to do. I know I’m going to have the urge to say fuck it and grab a drink or someone’s going to want to buy me one for my birthday. My plan is to ask them in the car not to buy me any and if they really want to they can get me one of the non-alcoholic options or send me money for coffee tomorrow, which might seem weird because I haven’t told anyone that I’m done drinking. The goal is to just get SUPER into the pinball machines. 
I don’t know why I’m even posting this. Maybe because I feel like I’m going to slip up. As I’m writing this I never thought my birthday last year would’ve been the last one I’d drink on. It’s kind of nostalgic to me I guess. ",2,1733593817.0,stopdrinking,1,1.0,False

In the anime, they made him into some sort of mad doctor guy who colludes with Melon for his shit coffee, improving the drugs and all.

1h8xuj1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_betterdazeoneday/comments/1h8xuj1/viewing_love_as_a_drug/,Viewing love as a drug ,"I know that when addicts get off of drugs they have withdrawals. There are a lot of parallels between getting out of a toxic relationship and getting off of a substance.
X
When someone misses alcohol or misses their drug of choice, their mind starts to rationalize relapsing again. 
X
To everyone on the outside, this sounds crazy and it’s so obviously bad for them, but the emotions that substance gives them is something that their brain is lacking without it.
X
People lose their personality Due to drugs, and they lose their sense of self. They stop having that light in their eyes. Unless maybe they just used the drug.
X
It’s hard for them to sleep at night without it, and when they wake up the day feels overwhelming. 
X
Everyone on the outside can see that the drug is a quick high and there’s nothing of substance to it, but that this person is brainwashed. 
X
It’s merely a chemical dependency and a trick of your mind . A drug could get you hurt or get you in trouble yet the addict would still crave it and have trouble not going back.
X
I understand addiction really well and when someone offers you love, I think it’s safe to view it as being offered drugs . Ask yourself if you want to trust what this person is giving you and potentially let it alter your brain chemistry.
X
If I think of my last relationship as a drug addiction rather than an addiction to a person, then it really helps me . I would never take a drug no matter how good it would make me feel. I’ve had friends die from taking drugs. And here I am realizing that I’ve been basically getting the same dopamine hit with something that was hurting me too.
X
It helps to depersonalize it and see it as what it is, which is technically an addiction and a toxic substance . Some people can only offer really big highs and really big lows. 
X
As human beings, we need someone that can hang out in the middle of those highs and lows with us and do mundane activities like drink coffee in the morning and run errands .
Drugs will leave you lonely in the mundane activities . So will narcissists or people that are unable to care for you consistently, and for the right reasons.
X 
And whoever my drug moves on is not going to get much more than what I received, which was a lot of highs . After the first few months followed by many lows.
X The better the love bombing stage feels the worst your addiction will be, and the worse the lows will feel.
X
Sending love to myself and anyone else that has ever experienced this .

XX.
It’s funny how our minds are so fickle that words and images can trick them into thinking something is holy . Like a mirage. Our brains just want a dopamine hit and sometimes we are really sad and it becomes easier to trick it.
X
In other news, I have quit smoking weed and almost quit vaping . I am less sick than I was before and I no longer have to rely on someone that will hurt me while they help me.
XX
I believe that just like an addict getting off a strong substance my mind will heal over time and I will no longer feel sad. I will break habits in my thinking and develop a healthier life that is more well-rounded.

but man with this coffee anything is possible and i feel like i can take on the world i can do anything i want, i just go and do it and i don't forget or waste a million minutes in between being distracted. i know a lot of people on this sub have mentioned how coffee actually has the opposite effect or just no effect at all, so i was wondering if anyone some sort of explanation for this difference or experienced something similar. i should also say that i suffer from a lot of fatigue during the day, even if i get a good sleep for a full 8 hours, i usually fall completely asleep at any given time within 2 minutes, but with the coffee obviously that fatigue is gone too

One of Anno developers mentioned recently about 16 player faction multiplayer feature giving hope that Anno multiplayer can be viable.

Currently the biggest hindrance is that people are reluctant to commit for a long time it takes to achieve anything of significance and for that reason it is extremely hard to find more than 2 people available at the same time.

Another elephant in the room is privacy. Not everyone is comfortable associating their Reddit or other identity with a game tag. Polytopia is the only game I know that has successfully solved this problem and I think this is the future of gaming. It’s also my favorite game besides Anno 1800 which I wish had this problem solved too. Maybe players or modders will come up with solutions. Please share if you have any ideas.

Multiplayer mechanics. Let's say someone has started 16 player session. You've played for 2 hours and decided to have a coffee break. After 4 cups of coffee you decided to play again for another hour or so. All you have to do is to ask one of your friends who is still playing to DM you the most recent save file or share it on [filebin.net](http://filebin.net/) which is registration free, truly anonymous and easy to use.

From there you can choose which faction to join or be a new host.

If you are the last man/woman standing, which shouldn't be the case when the multiplayer community is large enough, you should upload the most recent save file to [filebin.net](http://filebin.net/) and post a share link here so others can carry on if they want.

Now I am a huge coffee lover (like brewed coffee, not instant coffee) and I work night shift, so coffee is not helpful. I have also heard a little bit about lion's mane before. 

But on the other hand I feel they are quite expensive. Because I take Omega 3 myself and I do research a lot before buying anything. And the one I take right now has 1500mg EPA/DHA and has very less mercury (sardine fish) and it costs 575 for 60 tablets. And same thing for Ace Blend costs 1400rs.

I have educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out and earn extra money:

• Plasma is 92% water and the rest is mostly protein elements.

• The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

• Your body regenerates plasma fast from staying hydrated and eating protein.

• Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait inbetween those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hyrdrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. 

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. 

5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. 

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. 

7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. 

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. 

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. 

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. 

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. 

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. 

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. 



• Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.

• It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.

• Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

• Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. 

• Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement. I also drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

1h8xob9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1h8xob9/i_got_my_boss_fired_because_i_was_bored/,I got my boss fired because I was bored,"Look, I’m not going to sugarcoat this. I’m not the hero of this story. I’m the storm that blew through an annoyingly happy little office and flipped the whole thing upside down. And I’d do it again.

My office was like a Hallmark movie—everyone smiling, high-fiving, and talking about their kids and weekend plans like anyone actually cares. Leading the charge was Dave, our boss. The guy everyone adored. He was like a golden retriever in human form: always cheerful, always helpful, and way too into team-building exercises. People ate it up. Me? I wanted to puke.

I don’t do wholesome. I do chaos. I do drama. And frankly, the lack of it in this office was suffocating me. So I decided to create some. Why? Because I could.

The first step was planting doubt. I started telling people Dave “seemed different lately.” I’d roll my eyes during meetings and whisper to coworkers about how he’d “totally overlooked” my contributions. He didn’t, obviously. I just liked watching people’s faces when I acted like a victim. Then I dropped hints that Dave might be... too friendly. You know the type. A hand on someone’s shoulder that lingers a second too long, a laugh that’s a little too personal. Did Dave ever actually do that? Not once. But I knew how to make people look.

Then came the email. I typed out this beautifully crafted complaint to HR about “inappropriate workplace behavior.” I was vague enough to avoid specifics but damning enough to get the ball rolling. Signed it anonymously, of course. I even included a line about how the office felt “unsafe” for women lately. The kicker? I’m the least “unsafe” person here—I’m the one you should be worried about.

HR called Dave in, and he came out looking rattled. It was delicious. That’s when I really turned up the heat. I started a rumor that he’d had a blowup with the CFO behind closed doors. No one saw it, but I “overheard” it. You’d be amazed how gullible people are when they want something to be true.

At the same time, I fed Karen, the resident office gossip, a little story about how Dave once “accidentally” booked a business trip for just him and Ashley from accounting. Did that trip even happen? Of course not. But Karen ran with it, and within days, people were side-eyeing Ashley like she was some homewrecker.

The final nail in Dave’s coffin was pure theater. I spilled coffee on my own desk one morning and acted like I’d been crying. When someone asked what was wrong, I gave this Oscar-worthy performance about how Dave had “crossed a line” in our last one-on-one meeting. “I don’t want to talk about it,” I said, voice trembling, while making sure everyone could hear.

By the end of the week, HR was swarming. Dave got pulled into another meeting, and when he came out, his face was pale. “I’ll be stepping down,” he told us, voice cracking like a Lifetime movie dad. Some people gasped. Others looked devastated. I? I went to the breakroom and popped open a Diet Coke like I’d just hit the game-winning shot.

Dave’s gone now, and the office is a mess. The new boss is a hardass, morale is in the toilet, and people keep whispering about what “really” happened. I couldn’t care less. The drama was worth every second.

Do I feel bad? Please. Dave was too perfect for his own good. People like him don’t survive long in the real world. And me? I’ll be just fine. I always land on my feet—usually on someone else’s neck.",0,1733593144.0,stories,13,0.13,False

One of Anno developers mentioned recently about 16 player faction multiplayer feature giving hope that Anno multiplayer can be viable.

Currently the biggest hindrance is that people are reluctant to commit for a long time it takes to achieve anything of significance and for that reason it is extremely hard to find more than 2 people available at the same time.

Another elephant in the room is privacy. Not everyone is comfortable associating their Reddit or other identity with a game tag. Polytopia is the only game I know that has successfully solved this problem and I think this is the future of gaming. It’s also my favorite game besides Anno 1800 which I wish had this problem solved too. Maybe players or modders will come up with solutions. Please share if you have any ideas.

I have educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out and earn extra money:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is mostly protein elements.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Your body regenerates plasma fast from staying hydrated and eating protein.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait inbetween those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hyrdrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement. I also drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

Their branding looks pretty cool, but I’m curious if the taste and quality live up to the hype.

For context, I typically enjoy medium to dark roasts with a rich, smooth flavor profile (not too bitter). Has anyone here tried Grey Soul Coffee? Would you recommend it, or are there better options in a similar or lower price range?

Also, if you’ve got brewing tips or favorite blends from them ( i have a french press and Moka pot), I’d love to hear about those too! 🙌

Idk if it’s been confirmed yet since I haven’t played for very long (Winter Year 1), but I think Juniper isn’t the only witch in Mistria. I think >!Valen!< is some sort of mage too because of that one heart event

I think Landen might unretire

Balen will have a whole “Mistria is my home” event and come to terms with settling down

March’s insolence is a product of jealousy from both the farmer and his brother, being that he always wants to be the best

Juniper’s skin is yellow from all her failed potions

Adeline lives in a manor ffs. Why does she come to the poor new farmer for community funding :’)

Are Valen and Juniper exes?

Does Darcy put drugs in her coffee? Everyone talks about >!Dell’s incident!< like she was coked up. Will we ever find out what happened?

What the fuck is going on with Terithia, Errol, and Landen?

Will Hayden ever stop neighbor-zoning the farmer?

Why was >!Louis!< banned from the capitol?

Why did Adeline and Eiland’s parents not come to their aid after the earthquake?

That one building with a bell is a school I suppose? If it is, who will teach at it?

1h8xhve,https://www.reddit.com/r/Life/comments/1h8xhve/what_do_i_do_about_this_problem_thats_festered/,What do I do about this problem that’s festered for over a year now b/t my gf and I?,"My girlfriend (28) and I (M31) have been together for over 2 years. We met in my country and later moved to her country where I speak the language fluently and have lived in this region for the better part of a decade, so despite being from two different countries/ cultures, we immediately meshed quite well even initially (we moved in together on the first date).

I've never been the jealous type and have only had 3 serious relationships up to this point: my first girlfriend, my ex-wife, and my now girlfriend, who is pregnant with our child. Apart from those I have had dozens of casual encounters that we just hooking up during my college and early professional years, with the occasional FWB here and there. I've always been more laid back about this and if someone is not interested or wanting to fully commit, it's their choice and I'm not going to be jealous about their own wants/ desires. What gets me is when in the past more regular FWBs or serious relationships would lie or deliberately obscure the truth, whether due to apprehension about my potential reaction or because they were in-fact lying/ unfaithful.

I have never cheated on any of my serious relationships emotionally or otherwise as this does not meld with my fundamental value system of integrity and respect. I have also been completely open with all of my serious relationships/ FWBs/ hookups letting them know how the cards stand and what I am interested in. I have never been broken up with before, not saying it as a badge of honor, just that I have always been the one that ended things for one reason or another, so I don't know what it feels like to be broken up with. 

As mentioned, I've spent the past few years living in her country, have gotten to know her parents (wonderful people), her friend and professional group, etc. From the first date really we just kind of meshed and found each other's company quite complementary on many different levels: physical, intellectually, same value structures, etc.

I've never asked about her past or exes and she has not asked about mine, as we just never really cared and didn't present any issues or come up much if at all in conversation. I'd say in all other facets of our relationship things are excellent including communication, sex life, finances, complementary careers, etc.

About a year ago, a mutual acquaintance we later found out was attempting to suck me into a ponzy scheme, and when I let them know that my girlfriend and I had discussed and that it would not be a viable investment option for OUR family, they went off about her and dropped the names of two of her exes, both of which are semi-prominent public figures and also happen to be brothers. Their infantile manipulation tactic was to isolate me from my girlfriend in a foreign country, become my confidant, and trying to steal as much of my money as they could, which directly makes me mistrust any claims they made about anything (she was meeting him in secret, cheating on me, ""run-through,"" etc.).

All that my girlfriend had really revealed up to this point about her past was that she never had a public facing relationship (her friend groups had independently confirmed to me she had never ""dated"" anyone before). Additionally, she had not ever given off a promiscuous vibe and was more of a ""good girl"" type that early on stated she ""did not date people,"" and if we were together seriously or public facing she would want to marry and have children. She had only had FWBs up to this point, all of which had been her bosses.

At the beginning of our relationship we had a condom break, and she proceeded to reveal to me in bed that she had miscarried one of her exes' child, and what a terrible person they had been when she revealed the pregnancy, told her to f**k off and abort it. She ended up miscarrying in the office where he was her boss.

She had invited him to a barbecue earlier on when I first arrived in the country at her parents' house under the auspice that she needed the guy to help her father with a legal concern, but failed to mention that he was one of her former bosses with whom she had a relationship, and whose child she miscarried. By the way, I want to reinforce the fact that I have truly not ever been the jealous type, she has had male friends, and we have never once had this issue arise. When I think back to this day I realize she was standoffish with physical affection with me around him and had spent a lot of time that morning getting ready and doing her makeup. Yes, it makes me feel like a fool in retrospect.

It was this ex during the whole time and right before we got together that she had also actively been commenting and liking posts on social media, texting, and quite blatantly even on public facing social media trying to win the attention from by offering to go for a walk with our dog, assist with a request he had posted online. She posted a selfie with the dog just revealing her lips and the dog face, I'm not blind and have had plenty of FWB's who likewise would communicate with me in this playful flirtatious way. His public request she was also standoffish about and really I feel had been trying to do herself, again as a means by which to interact with him and gain his attention since, to him it was clear she was nothing more than his annual rotation of young 20-something interns.

When I asked her about this the same day the acquaintance revealed the identity, we were sitting in bed and she kind of had an ""oh s**t"" moment when I just told her exactly what had happened and how the acquaintance had said she was cheating on me with him. Of course, I don't think this was the case based on his known intentions, however, it has left me rubbed the wrong way even a year later. It's not that she had this relationship or that anything happened, but how she actively hid it from me and continued the communciation with him the way she did during our entire relationship.

The topic is unable to be broached, despite our otherwise stellar communication including never really even getting into arguments. She basically says to me, ""I chose you. This is not going to work for me if you keep brining this up.""

She denies that she had anything other than the intention of having him help her father, but the way she went about this is quite painful and devastating to me because she omitted the truth on purpose, and it's still not blatantly clear to me why because I would not have cared. I feel in my gut that there is more to it than she has let on, especially due to the fact that now she does not interact with him on social media anymore at all, nor do I ever see any more messages pop up from him in passing. I'm not reading her phone, never have violated her privacy in any way, but I'm talking about when you sit in bed scrolling you will show people your phone and notifications pop up for example. I'd seen his name before but never since then has it appeared.

Why would she cut off any social media activity with him after this happened, if in fact there was nothing to it? Why will she refuse to discuss it further and immediately become defensive when I calmly broach the subject, flipping immediately to something out of left field to accuse me of doing wrong? I'm not ignorant to this form of emotional manipulation and it saddens me to see her employing it as I get the feeling it means she doesn't want to really discuss the issue honestly with me.

I feel like I've been played like a complete fool, and that for a large portion of our relationship she's kept me with this guy as an option on deck, whom she likely was texting the entire time and god only knows what. On top of that, they live in our city as semi-prominent public figures and I have to run into them infrequently.

Additionally, all of her friends who knew about it the whole time I can't bear to even see or be around now, as I am certain they look at me as a complete fool as well who was to be the stupid idiot ignorant of what was happening. One of her girlfriends I know was laughing all day long with her husband about the stupid foreigner not knowing the truth. As you can see, yes this brings out feelings of jealousy and insecurity in me that I really do not like to feel, as I've never had this occur in my life really before like this, and I am not sure what to do anymore.

I have his phone number and want to invite him for a cup of coffee to ask what the hell had been going on since I understand I will never hear the full truth from her, but I am worried I will not like what I hear from him. I've pictured even meeting him, and getting him to write her a note to ask to meet and see if she does it and doesn't say anything to me about it.

How do I resolve this other than asking her directly, again, for the third time, which I certainly do not want to do during her pregnancy to add any unnecessary stress. I think about it pretty much daily and get in a very bad space mentally when I do. I've also played out the scenario in my head of asking her to show me her texts with him. If they're deleted if/when I ask her to show them, what is/ has been really going on?",1,1733592648.0,Life,0,1.0,False

One of Anno developers mentioned recently about 16 player faction multiplayer feature giving hope that Anno multiplayer can be viable.

Currently the biggest hindrance is that people are reluctant to commit for a long time it takes to achieve anything of significance and for that reason it is extremely hard to find more than 2 people available at the same time.

Another elephant in the room is privacy. Not everyone is comfortable associating their Reddit or other identity with a game tag. Polytopia is the only game I know that has successfully solved this problem and I think this is the future of gaming. It’s also my favorite game besides Anno 1800 which I wish had this problem solved too. Maybe players or modders will come up with solutions. Please share if you have any ideas.

Multiplayer mechanics. Let's say someone has started 16 player session. You've played for 2 hours and decided to have a coffee break. After 4 cups of coffee you decided to play again for another hour or so. All you have to do is to ask one of your friends who is still playing to DM you the most recent save file or share it on [filebin.net](http://filebin.net) which is registration free, truly anonymous and easy to use.

From there you can choose which faction to join or be a new host.

If you are the last man/woman standing, which shouldn't be the case when the multiplayer community is large enough, you should upload the most recent save file to [filebin.net](http://filebin.net) and post a share link on the dedicated Anno 1800 multiplayer subreddit [https://www.reddit.com/r/Anno1800multiplayer/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anno1800multiplayer/) so others can carry on if they want.

16 players game empires grow a lot faster since 4 people manage a single faction.

If this doesn't look too overwhelming or technical to you and you like to experiment, feel free to join newly created [https://www.reddit.com/r/Anno1800multiplayer/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anno1800multiplayer/) where you can: 

1. Start a new multiplayer game or contribute to the growth of an existing empire

1h8xeg7,https://i.redd.it/pqx2iux7og5e1.jpeg,A wonderful night with friends,"Had a wine tasting the other night and wanted to share my thoughts as someone still figuring out this whole wine thing. Here’s the lineup, how they paired with the food, and what I thought:
	1.	Emidio Pepe (Trebbiano d’Abruzzo)
This was the first wine, paired with an artichoke salad. It was fresh and crisp, with green apple and lemon vibes and this creamy, nutty thing going on. I liked it, but artichokes are tricky with wine and made it taste a bit off. Still, a nice way to kick things off.
	2.	Kurni (Oasi degli Angeli)
Served with meat tartar, and honestly, this was a powerhouse. Super ripe plums, blackberries, and a bit of chocolate—it was bold and rich. The only wine that felt ready to go right after opening. That said, I think it came out too early. This is a wine that would’ve killed it later in the lineup with something hearty like roasted lamb or a slow-cooked dish. Amazing, but it felt like it got wasted early.
	3.	Testamatta
This one was elegant and kind of artsy. Fresh flowers and berries on the nose, and the taste was smooth, silky, and a little spicy. It felt lighter compared to the others, but in a good way—like a breather in between the bigger wines. Definitely classy and balanced.
	4.	Massetino
Paired with a tomahawk steak, and wow, what a combo. This wine had dark chocolate, coffee, and ripe blackberry vibes. It was rich, velvety, and luxurious—just what you’d want with a big, juicy steak. Probably my favorite pairing of the night, though I do think it needed more time to open up to fully show off.
	5.	Tignanello
This one felt too young for me. It had cherries, tobacco, and leather going on, which I liked, but it just didn’t feel like it had fully come together yet. Definitely has potential, but it needed more time (both in the bottle and in the decanter).
	6.	Château Pontet-Canet
Smoky, woody, and full of blackcurrants. This one had a nice structure and was smooth, but I think it needed more air to really open up. By the time I got into it, it just felt a little muted compared to the others.
	7.	Casanova di Neri (Brunello di Montalcino)
This was the last wine of the night, and by then, my palate was kind of shot. It had that classic Brunello cherry and earthy thing going on, with a nice warm spice, but it definitely needed more time to breathe. It felt like it wasn’t getting the love it deserved being served so late.

Overall Thoughts:
	•	The Kurni was my favorite, and it was spot on right after opening—ready to impress!
	•	The Massetino with the tomahawk steak was killer, but it needed more time in the decanter to really show off.
	•	Honestly, all the wines (except the Kurni) needed more air to fully develop. The Tignanello especially felt too young, and even the Casanova di Neri at the end could’ve used more time.

Recently, I was away with someone, and felt... agitated. We were having a great time - cooking, frolicking, sharing, snuggling - amazing stuff! What was going on?! After, I checked with myself, and it hit me: I wasn't happy!

**Getting to the point**: I was putting the responsibility of my personal happiness on to those women I was dating. I thought, ""If I fill this void, I will be happy!"" And, duh, that's doomed to fail. The TL;DR is that I told her, and after a lot of context sharing, we're still together - just without my unrealistic expectations. The emotional void can be filled, we can feel joy in our connection, **and** I can continue to work on my happiness.

# Personal Experience

Using the [JBL Tune Buds](https://amzn.to/3Zsz0wY) was a pleasant experience. Pairing them with my smartphone was quick, and the Bluetooth 5.3 connection remained stable during workouts and commutes. The bass-heavy sound profile is a standout, especially for genres like EDM and hip-hop. The 4-mic setup worked exceptionally well for calls, even in noisy environments. However, the ANC could struggle in extremely loud settings like busy coffee shops. The earbuds were comfortable for extended wear, and their durability gave me confidence while exercising outdoors.

1h8x6be,https://www.reddit.com/r/naturalbodybuilding/comments/1h8x6be/suplements_1_year_testing_my_opinions/,Suplements - 1 year testing / my opinions,"I've been training on and off for 18 years (natural) and this year I had the time and money to work out and test a few supplements.

I'm 36 now and here are my observations. I'll start with the obvious ones.

Protein - Must have - Personally for me there were small differences in the result whether I used whey, isolate or hydroisolate. Towards the end of the year, however, I increased my dose to 3 \* 30 whey and casein before bed which helped me quite a bit to better correct my physique. Overall, I recommend the first dose in the morning, the second one after exercise/at lunch, and the third one (casein) before bed. However, 2 hours before bedtime have another one.

PS: some proteins were harder to stomach than others but it depended on the manufacturer rather than the type of protein.

Creatine - Unflavored creatine every day. If you skip a day nothing serious happens. In the first half of the year I took 2 week breaks after 2 months. In the second half of the year I've been taking it every day, I haven't noticed much of a difference though. However, sometimes I felt a difference (when exercising) when I tried multi-ingredient creatine or microlized creatine. However, in terms of leaps there are no significant differences. I have tried putting it on at different times, in the morning, before and after exercise. I had better results and exercise when I took creatine after exercise.

Citrulline - For me personally disappointing. I know that it should have kicked me up a notch before the workout unfortunately it didn't happen that way. I tried it for 3 months and in that period I didn't feel that it helped much.

Arginine - Paradoxically very good effects. For the first three weeks I took it before exercising and exercised significantly better. For me it was then necessary to stop it because it seemed to stop working after 3 weeks (maybe psyche). However, it helped significantly with potency :)

Omega-3 fatty acids - Great, although not tasty stuff. Especially with stomach problems, they always helped within 4 days. I only took it for digestive problems.

Pre-workout - I've also tried a few types after I was done with arginine and citrulline. Some worked, others I didn't feel anything from I probably felt the most for the workout from Optimum Nutrition. For a while I was working out so as a pre-workout I was just having coffee but it wasn't much.

BCAA - nothing much in terms of results but they have always been good for my muscles. I don't use them all the time but after a long time without them, my muscles are pretty strong and when they're preventing me from exercising I buy them. The bcaa 4:1:1 help me the best.

Ashwaganda - Certainly an interesting thing. The workout was a bit better and I was more alert all day, I always took it in the morning. It gave me a boost and some relaxation as well. The downside was more frequent urination at night.

Multivitamins - I personally take a multivitamin every day (At least I'm trying.) I don't know if they help or not, even if I don't take them I feel the same way.

Joint nutrition, collagen- a big fail. I've tried several kinds and not one has helped my joint pain. What finally helped the joints was less ego lifting and modifying the exercises.

Nut butters - The perfect thing to chase away hungry thoughts when one is craving something nice. Peanut/almond or cashew important to have a good ingredients and taste. I've also had some really disgusting ones that I'll never buy again.

This is my experience. Most supplements can also be replaced with a proper food intake. Personally though, I think the combination of protein + creatine is a basic. Arginine occasionally before a workout when I'm not motivated enough and BCAAs when I have strong muscles.",11,1733591791.0,naturalbodybuilding,4,1.0,False

Every Christmas Eve, my brother Kevin brings his family over to my apartment, and we feast on my Gingerbread. They sleep over and we eat even more gingerbread in the morning.

However, this year is different. Kevin’s wife Martha died. She got ran over while skiing in the forest on December first. Or at least, that’s what Police assume. They never found her body, only a small patch of snow with her blood. 

The children were upset, but Kevin was destroyed. From what his kids told me, he has barely moved from his bed for weeks. 

They came to my house earlier than usual, and had been living here for a few weeks now. Kevin needed to get back on his feet. His children have taken a few weeks off school to mourn.

I love his children so much. They’re so young and cute. I can never have kids, no matter how much I wish and pray. So I try my best to be the worlds greatest aunt. Baking gingerbread. Helping with the tree. Buying the best toys.

When I brought over a fresh tray of Gingerbread, each beautifully decorated, Kevin emerged from my spare room. He had clearly been crying again. The dark shadows under his eyes had gotten darker. He wiped a tear away with his sleeve. But when he ate a small bite of gingerbread, a tiny smile emerged.

“Thanks Samantha.” He said, lying on the couch with his kids. They all grabbed the cookies and gobbled them down.

“No problem!” I replied. I set the tray on the coffee table, and began to brew hot chocolate with whipped cream and marshmallows. Only the best for his kids.

They sat and watched the movie, and I waited patiently for the call I knew was coming. A few hours passed, and eventually Kevin’s phone rang. My husband Mike was calling.

“Hello?… What? WHAT? They caught him? I’ll be there in 20.”

He sprinted out the door, and I put his kids to bed. 

I knew Kevin wouldn’t return.

Mike was waiting for in the same place Martha died. The same place he ran her over.

I will get Kevin’s children, the best gift of all. 

I hope the children won’t notice the slight difference in taste in this year’s gingerbread. 

The flour was much more powdery and grey than usual. No need for it to go to waste. I’m getting more soon.

Eventually, the kids will forget that I’m their aunt. That Mike is their uncle.

It portrays ex-employees of big corporations and how they are destroying the world in a few little steps:
1. Sell more
2. Waste more
3. Lie more
4. Hide more
5. Control more

Although interesting, this documentary is very depressing and frustrating to watch. Corporations control governements with lobbying, they also control our individual minds and action through ads and marketing strategy. Consequently, they control money so basically the world. I might be conspirationist or crazy, but that's what I understand from what I see. The world is coming to an end at an increasingly scary rate and we can't even do anything, because they are so powerful and unattainable. I feel at loss.

However, we can make changes. We MUST make changes. But how can we do that? They propose ideas at the last 5 mins of the documentary (lol), to name a few:
-Don't use/encourage single use items
-Don't use fast-fashion
-Asking if you really want that purchase by leaving it in the wishlist for a month then asking again if you actually want it
-Hold on to your electronics longer and fix them if possible by yourself, or with a friend or go to a specialized store
-Talk to politicians and take action
-Prioritize companies that offer plant-based alternatives
-BUY LESS

I'd also add:
-Be conscious of your purchases and their impact before, during, and after use
-Research companies with whom you plan on doing impactful transactions
-Try to sensibilize close ones, family, and friends and take action whenever possible

Do these actually help? Not buying your coffee at Starbucks won't save the world.

I don't know what I want from this post. Maybe I just want to scream and be heard. Maybe just feel understood. I feel like all of this is just too obvious and that we are knowingly crashing into a wall and we can't stop it. We're heading there faster and faster. And the more we go forward, the harder it is to stop and reduce the consequences. Corporations and governments make it harder to avoid and we just suffer. Silently.

Kelsey just made me the happiest gal who ever hated her father by runnin’ down the jewelry store for me and makin’ up for it all by buying the China pony I had always yearned for and something pretty, with lots and lots of diamonds.

I tapped, twice (and only twice), with two fingers the picture of my boys, set in sepiatone colors by my former Megan, her kind offering of what she knew about me that you do, too.

I hope that the Prodigal Father is forgiven by his sons before- well, no need to go there, is there?

This is a good post.

I open an email.

My day gets better, immediately.

Kelsey says I should maybe go ahead and post a small portion of “The Dogs and the Dead”, the story of some guy what got in too deep into drugs and PTSD and went and robbed himself a bank. Good lookin’ guy. Very polite. “Above average” in the ol’, well, let’s just say that no one has ever complained ‘bout nothin’ betwixt their orgasms experienced in the multiple format, okay?

Obviously, they aren’t going to have me do this across platforms or anything like that because what the eff do I know about this, right? She just said she knew I was feelin’ down and that maybe bein’ a part of the process on my thing here would make me feel good. 3,000 people might read this so who gives an eff if I'm a goof, right?

It’s an odd thing to finish a book, just so you all know. I’d been working on “Without” since 2006. It was literally a lifetime of work. Like, I could fuck a girl who hated her father who was born the day I started writing that and not go to jail, even in a good state. I feel serene, yet depressed. That story is now done. The boardwalk dance ends in murder, as it always did and always will. I can never change that ending.

Go ahead and find a way to be depressed about success and there, too, you shall find me.

Silver lining?

Sitting for an interview today.

I get to talk true crime genre issues, “above average” writing, and pretty much anything about the process, nothing much about the crime itself. You wouldn’t understand, okay? It’s serious people stuff. This is what serious authors do, myah.

“Myah” is a word that we successful and intellectual sorts use.

“Well, myah, there really was more than a hint of the dialectic, myah, narratives of the oppressed classes that spoke to the Trotsky-ites, myah, wouldn’t you say, myah?”

Seriously? I use that around other successful and serious people and they fucking hate it, because, myah, I’m not one of them, you see?

I’m just some fuck-up like you, a tourist in their successful and intellectual people world. Don’t you worry, they all think if not say to my face, I’ll be back on the convenience store bathroom toilet getting my dick sucked by your mothers and shootin’ dope three weeks after I realize my books can’t buy class.

Myah.

But you know me. If the interviewer is a hot girl, it’ll go very well, probably need some editing.

If the interviewer is any lady other than a hot girl, it’ll just go well.

If the interviewer is male? Eff that, eat a bag of dicks, clown, then come back once you’ve done something that put some fucking balls under that micropenis your poor girl has to pretend to feel, okay?

Here she is, a bit of my intro. I had to chop some stuff out but it doesn’t jump around too “muchly”.

**THE DOGS AND THE DEAD**

Shit. I’m awake. Again.

I look around, half expecting to hear Adalberto’s gentle snoring, see my state or commonwealth issued wall locker, and squint from the glare of the ever present lights from the block’s dayroom and from the tower lights over the yards outside. That little light that comes on at count time, maybe. But all I see, both surrounding me and suffocating me, is darkness. Too much darkness.

For the first month, each time of the many I would awaken, with a violent and electric start, so many times, I would panic. I’m over that little PTSD-inspired quirk now, my dad does it too time and again and I suppose that to say that it’s entirely over might be a premature judgment of sorts, but I just can’t get used to the darkness. There’s just too much of it out here for some Jew kid from the inner city.

Lights. I’m the sort of guy who’s used to lights. My whole life.

There’s been lights everywhere I’ve lived in life.

I first traded the lights of the inner city, the one, that one damned streetlight in the city no one had put a bullet into or chucked a rock at that lit my room from across Lake, yeah, I traded that for the semi constant lights of military life, main-side anyway. There’s always lights main-side on a military base. In the field, well that, of course is a different story.

After my tours were up, I traded those lights, the ones on the parade decks and supply points and ancient Quonset Huts, the very same Quonset Huts my grandfather helped put up in his day and my father and uncle probably kept their shit in the same way I did, yeah, well I traded those for the lights of some struggling shithole city much like the one I grew up in.

Post industrial is the term the liberals use to make themselves feel better for not fulfilling their empty promises. Post industrial? Post jobs, maybe. Those are long gone. Been leaving since the mid 30s when you look at the numbers. Even in this supposed red-hot post COVID economy I can’t get a job there. Same with a lot of people I know who aren’t bearing the Scarlet Letters of ex-con. Post stores, that’d be true, too. Most of them are boarded up or burned out. The ones that are left are the stores you’d expect to find in a place like that. Lots of smoke shops. Convenience stores that sell lottery tickets and will cash in your SNAP benefits just so long as no one is watching. If you’re from a place like that you know the ones I’m talking about. Not the chains. No, they won’t go for that. Those little places run by the people with the accents who are always really nice and worlk really hard but everyone hates. Post growth. Every census, what is that every ten years, the numbers get more and more depressing. Young people, not the ones who want to make anything of themselves anyway, don’t stick around here. Post hope. Yeah, that’s probably the most accurate assessment. Hope? Hell, no one’s hoped around here since ‘58. It’s the kind of place that the Russians probably still have a nuke targeted on but only because they have so many they figure, why not?

Finally, I traded those shithole city lights, but only after looking down the muzzle of a half dozen assault rifles armed by angry men with itchy trigger fingers, for the lights of prison. I liked prison. That first year wasn’t so hot. A lot of sex offenders and one bank robber in an open shower with an absent CO who started a rumor that I was a tranny because he was a prick. I pray for that man. That’s the truth. I do. Haven’t really processed that little “incident”, that’s what the prison called it, yet. My therapist says it’s either because I’m resilient or because I’m strong. Maybe she’s right. Maybe I just don’t care because I deserved it in my mind. I don’t know. It got a lot better after that first year,. I really knew who I was in prison. Everyone liked me. I was the guy on the block everyone went to for a free favor. You might say, like those beers that Andy Dufresne got for the guys on the roof in that movie, that I did things for free just so people would have my back in a fight. No, Stephen King was right about that line he wrote. I did it just to feel normal.

Post industrial They didn’t have terms like that when I was young. Just a way to feel better about knowing some people live in slums.

I hate it out here. Nobody likes me and it’s just too damned dark.

No, darkness doesn’t suit me at all. Darkness, in my world, means there’s something wrong. A blackout, a raid, perhaps. I suppose, at least, the darkness and its eerie, associated stillness means I can hear anyone coming, not always the way it is when they come for you in the cities. There’s always the police or ambulance siren, screaming into the night and echoing off the walls, confusing you as to its source and from where the heat is coming. I grew up with those sirens. They’re as common to me as that little sound your I Phone or Roku makes. Now and again there’s a piercing scream, though you can normally tell the good ones from the bad ones, not that anyone really cares all that much about either. I was used to them, too. Or then there’s the staccato shot, the much-preferred Glock making a unique sound I can identify readily. Three blocks south on Lake was one of the hottest corners in the city I grew up in. Multiple bus lines to Child and Family Services up the line and a quick transfer to Social Security and Welfare down the steps to the subway. All the dealers wanted that corner. A lot of money and suffering on that corner. Perfect place for them, I suppose. So yeah, I’m used to gunshots at night, too. I wasn’t supposed to walk down there when I was a kid, but I did. Never got caught. A passing bus or train. The line of jets overhead, circling for landing at the airport on the edge of the city. So much, so many different noises, all the better to hide the footsteps of the twenty dollar assassin or the idling motor of the young-head crew, looking to prove their worth.

Out here, way out here, were it light enough I’d be in view of the lake where I normally type, sitting atop an earthen dam, occasionally acknowledging the ducks or wondering what caused the random ripples, there’s no noise whatsoever. That’s not natural. Shouldn’t there be an owl or something? A scurrying squirrel? A raccoon? But there’s nothing. Now and again, maybe, the wind, but it’s not blowing right now. No, it’s eerie, it’s still, it’s silent, and it’s a suffocating, bleak, and oppressively black dark at night.

I cry a lot now. I cry the sort of tears that men with deep and lasting regrets cry. I cry until tears no longer fall. Sinatra once posited that he had regrets, but, then again, too few to mention. Trade places, Frank? Please?

I reach in the dark for the electric light on my nightstand, one of those touch lamps that works as often as it doesn’t, choose “doesn’t for the first few taps and I grow just a little too frustrated and slam my fingers into it again and again until it, of course, cycles through its four settings over and over again.

I’m not supposed to smoke in here, my parent’s hate smoke, but I reach for my pipe anyway. The window’s open and either they don’t notice the smell or they do and just pretend, for my sake, that they don’t. Addicts don’t give up addictions. They just trade one for another. Some trade the needle for NA, others the stem for the bottle. Me, I chose Virginia tobacco, the cheap kind in the blue bag from the smoke shop, is addiction number one that I traded for. I have a few of them. I’d guess that everyone does, in their own ways.

Blue bags. Funny the things you remember. The first few months I was doing heroin it was always in little, blue bags. Just like my tobacco is now. Odd coincidence.

The room is a mess. My cell, and of course my old squad bay in the Corps, were immaculate. Even when I was a junky I kept an immaculate room. I don’t know why I don’t care as much for this room as I did for those other places, but I don’t. Maybe it’s because it isn’t, in any meaningful way, truly mine.

Sure, the pictures are of my kids, my platoons, and my fireteams, but it isn’t mine. Those are just the few meager decorations my parents could find in the stuff Marie didn’t throw away in her petty, righteous anger. Maybe it’s because my parents had almost half a year to move their endless boxes of shit they don’t even want out of here, telling me each video visit that they were getting my room ready for me, only to have me do it all the day I came home. Maybe it’s a symptom of something else. I don’t know. Either way, it doesn’t matter. It’s a mess. A perfect reflection of my life. Or is it a metaphor? I don’t know.

G-d, I miss those guys from Fort Leonard Wood, Parris Island MCRD, and a thousand other places, the ones with names familiar to military vets and their families, who stare at me from the walls I know a few of them were dead before I went upstate. I’d imagine more by now. Veterans have this way of killing themselves these days. G-d knows, I’ve tried.

But, I miss the two other guys who did the exact same thing I did most of all. I don’t think either of them were liars, though. By trade they had to be, but I just get the feeling they weren’t like me, born into it, you know? They were good guys. Like, really good guys. The type who’d die or kill for you. Jackson and DeBenedetto. The only two men whose stories are the exact same as mine until discharge.

We were so young and so idealistic. I know I was. We went through Hell and back together. G-d, I hate cliches like that, but there really is no better way to put it. We, the misfits of a muscle obsessed force of killers and warfighters, probably killed more men by typing on a keyboard and saved more men than all the bomb sniffing robots and dogs combined. I can’t tell you that story. It’s a good one. There’s girls, there’s booze, there’s drugs, there’s guns and explosions and combat, there’s a lot of travel, some really hot and really cold places, there’s even a rooster from Mexico that got raped. That’s why Jackson’s nickname, nom de guerre if you will, was “Rooster”. It stopped being funny when everyone started thinking they were in on the joke. See? It’s a much better story than this one, but some stories must remain untold.

I looked up Jackson once. He’s still married to that kinda pretty stripper he married, even though she was fucking an NCO in our chain-of-command. He had a son then. I think he’s still in. Apart from my brother and another guy with the last name Jackson I met in prison, “Rooster” Jackson was the only guy I ever met who was smarter than me. And not by a few points like prison Jackson. No, “Rooster”: had me by a good 20 IQ points. Homeschooled. It showed. Awkward both socially and physically. We played chess together a lot at The Stumps. I actually got better at it than him. Reached that point where I could think four moves ahead. I can’t do that anymore. I tried in prison. Whatever it was I had back then with “Rooster” is gone. I don’t remember his wife’s name. “Rooster’s” girl was pretty, but in a weird way. For some reason I never thought about what it would be like to be with her. Wasn’t out of honor, you know, because she’s my friend’s girl or anything. She just wasn’t my type. Pretty enough, just not my sort of pretty. I went to their wedding up in Connecticut.

I don’t know about DeBenedetto. He was the only guy I ever met who was as proud of his home town as I was. Same encyclopedic knowledge of the same shithole of a place in the northern part of a shithole state. He didn’t die in the service. No, I’m sure of that. I know that much because I can’t find his name on any of the lists of the dead. They have lists of the men and women who die in the service. Neither can I find any trace of him whatsoever. Who knows? Maybe he fell off the grid, bedeviled and accursed in his brilliant mind by the things we did, the things we bore witness to, living in some Unabomber shack in Montana somewhere connecting newspaper stories with strings and pushpins. I’ve been down that road before. He was smart. Too smart, too. I could see that happening to him. Maybe he’s deep undercover for CIA now, keeping us all safe from the boogeymen who never make the news. The one’s the three of us knew existed but you had no clue about. Maybe he killed himself like so many veterans do these days. Like I’ve tried a few times since coming back. There’d be a news story, a link, a reference on the web somewhere if that was the case, so I don’t think he did.

I hope they’re both happier than I am. They’re the truest sort of heroes. The ones whose stories never get told. Don’t include me in that whole “hero” thing. No, I lost the right to refer to myself in that manner, not that I ever did, long ago.

Thank you for your service. I learned, in prison, from one of the psych ladies, the pretty one that prisoner Jackson (no relation) had a thing for because she looked like his -ex, that I wasn’t the only veteran who hated those words. Those of us who served before it was trendy to say that, the days before the attack, a lot of us resent it. We served before it was a thing. When people made fun of us in airports. I’m not old enough to remember getting spat upon, but my uncle and father are. The only ones I like hearing it from are the kids who are too young to remember having done anything else and the old people, the only ones who ever said it before that September morning. You’re not saying it for me, you liar, you fraud, you’re saying it for you. So you can hashtag it, upvote it, cc it, link it. The ways you people express your support for things these days.

Skinner Box Manipulation. A meaningless reward to stimulate the pleasure centers of the mind...first in mice, now in you. Maybe I shouldn’t be so angry about it. You’re just an addict, too. An addict of that pleasure center’s neurons’ firings. Not your fault. Same thing that happened when I used to shoot up. Only difference is, it was some market researcher and some kid, probably a billionaire now, the former got paid by the latter to hook you. So far, there’s no cure for your thing. You’re a junky, like me. Like me, you don’t want my pity. You’ve got it. But you’re so hooked you don’t even realize deserve it.

Maybe, one day, they’ll make a Netflix or Hulu special about it. Jackson, DeBenedetto, and me. I hope they find someone who really sums me up to play me. With my luck, it’ll be someone as wooden as Tom Hanks. Don’t get angry at that. I love Tom Hanks and appreciate the attention he brings to veteran’s causes. He’s always in really good movies since his career took off. For some reason, I just always see Tom Hanks instead of the character he’s supposed to be playing. Everyone loves him, though, and he is a genuinely good human being, so I’ll just stop typing. The way the world is going, I’ll probably be portrayed as transgender or something like that because Netflix or Hulu will need the ever-present character to represent that community. Whatever. I’m an open-minded guy. Just so long as it’s not Tom Hanks.

I don’t know how those generals and politicians back in Civil War times made pipes last as long as they show on the movies. I pack mine tightly, but I’m always done smoking it in a minute. Maybe it’s one of those things Hollywood always gets wrong about military life. I hate movies about the military. The only one I liked wasn’t really a movie, by definition, but a miniseries based on an article by an embedded reporter. Everyone hated it. Not me. It got every detail right. I used to argue with people online about that series, but people who never wore the uniform just don’t get it. Tedium and monotony, adding atop one another and then multiplying again and again. Maybe that’s why I did so well in prison.

Damn it. “She” crosses my mind. Why the fuck did “she” have to do that? “She” didn’t like Tom Hanks. “She” only met Jackson twice and DeBenedetto once and they never really spoke more than a few words to one another. Not that I know of, anyway. Why the fuck is “she” here? “She” is here every night, beside me as I walk the dogs, when I type. “She” is with me during my three-minute showers, washing over me, enveloping me. All the time. Shouldn’t surprise me that “she” is here now. I’m just wondering why.

Idiot. It was that whole Skinner Box thing. “She” taught me that. “She” was a psychologist. “She” couldn’t fix me.

“She”. “She” is such a cliché, isn’t “she”? I mean, isn’t there’s always a “she” in every story? There is in every good story, I know that much. Yeah, well, “she” comes to mind, that “she” that every divorced man knows. “She’s” probably sleeping right now, with “him”. There’s always a “him”, too. There’s always some shitbag, asshole, lying “him”.

I know how “she” sleeps, because “she” was a ten (on a bad day) from Jersey. No, no flannel pajamas or old t-shirts. Designer panties and a tight baby tee, sometimes even bespoke lingerie, even though it’s uncomfortable. Beauty was a privilege “she” said. It has to be maintained. “She” never had to try, but “she” always did. “She” and “him”.

Stop. You fucking idiot. You’re doing it again. Just fucking stop before you push. You can overdose on a “she”. Easily, too. “She” was that beautiful. “She” was that perfect.

“She”, her toes curled as tight as if they were cramped when “she” reaches finality. “She”, her French manicured nails clutching desperately at the sheets as “she” allows her breath to come in gasps. “She”, with her brown eyes rolling further and further back into her head as “she” feels “him” within her again and again. “She”, with “him”. Fucking “him” I fucking hate “him”, not only because “him” is fucking “she” right now, at least in my mind. I fucking hate him because “him” is better than “me”. And “me” was the one who lost...not in a fair fight. No, “him”? He never fought fair. He might be the only guy who lies better than I do.

Fuck. Yeah, “she”? This “she”? My “she”? “She”, oh G-d, “she” like no other is an addiction I am in recovery from. That’s a lie. If “she” were here, well, everything would be fine and I wouldn’t be writing this. I’d be thanking G-d for giving me a second chance with her. But second chances are rare in life and I don’t deserve one anyway. Maybe I’ll win a Pulitzer and “she” will come back. I know that won’t happen, but I’m an addict of that one “she”, a “she” abuser. No, I’m not in recovery in any meaningful sense of the word. I’m in my second decade of violent withdrawal.

The place my parents chose, this little place by the serene little lake, this place that gets too dark and eerily still and silent at night, is one of those places around here with thin walls and floors. Even those huge houses, incongruously, jarringly, located on a plot between a trailer and an abandoned church, the ones I’ve been in anyway, suffer the same fault. Above me I hear one of my parents make their way to the bathroom. It’s probably not my father. He sleeps well.

No, it’s my mother. I can tell because I can hear her labored breathing. She’s a chronic pain sufferer. Every breath sets me off because Marie used to sigh at me all the time and my mother’s breathing sounds just like Marie’s sighs. She’s a hypochondriac. My mother. My dear, dear mother. To tell the truth, she’s pretty abusive. I’d say that if she were a young, hot girl from Jersey, I wouldn’t even like her, but I married Marie, didn’t I? Marie was basically my mother’s clone, just in a young and beautiful body with a face that looked like that actress from “Miller’s Crossing.” What was her name? Damn it I know this. I’ll look it up because it’s bugging me now. Yeah, Marie was pretty, but we men marry our mothers don’t we?

Marie and my mother hated each other. That figures. We hate those who remind us of ourselves, don’t we? I know I hate liars. Especially the ones who are no good at it. No, hate is too strong of a word. I’m amused by bad liars. They can be fun to fuck with. I guess I hate the liars, like Marie, who were no good at it but still managed to get the better of me. I can understand why people trust the shit I say. I’m good at it. I’ve had training. But it drives me insane when someone falls for a bad liar’s obvious lies. They didn’t earn their win. They didn’t have the years of practice and erudition at it as I have. I’ve earned the right to lie. I’ve done it to save you and those you love from being the victims of some dealer’s profit-loss equation. You think an American insurance company would let you die to save a hundred bucks? I used to work for people who’d overdose your kid to save half a dollar. Fentanyl sales prove that statement to be true.

Marcia Gay Harden. The name comes to me suddenly. That’s who Marie looks like. Marcia Gay Harden, when she was young. Damn, she was pretty. Marie, that is.

I hate losing to Marie. It would be as if the New England Patriots, with Tom Brady, lost time and again to my beloved New York Jets with Geno Smith under center. I call them a retirement plan for Green Bay’s has-beens these days. It’s like when “she” used to take me to Devils games to see them play the New York Rangers. Everyone out there from Jersey remembers those few, consecutive years when we didn’t lose a single game to the Rangers. It’s like that. Marie sucks at every little, ill conceived, ill thought out, poorly acted lie she tells, but she is, in every imaginable way, simply owning me at my own game. And everyone knows she’s doing it. Her family, my family, my sons, the courts...everyone. But, damned if she doesn’t keep winning.

I get it now. I get how frustrated you people must feel when dealing with liars like me. Especially those of you who are onto us but keep losing. It’s frustrating. So damned frustrating. G-d, I should really apologize to some people. Would they believe me? Probably. But the damned thing is, I suppose I’d never really know. Maybe they’d just assume I’d gotten even better at what I do, what I was paid and trained to do to bad people, to them and was being insincere. G-d, a man could go crazy thinking about this. Maybe if I apologized for things I knew people had never figured out was a lie, maybe that would do it. I’ll have to think on it. I apologized to “she” the other day, admitting to wrongs ""she"" couldn’t have possibly known about in poetic terms, but maybe “she” just thought I was trying to earn my way back into her heart’s affections. “She”. I had to lie to “she”. Requirement of the job. But I told so many lies I didn’t have to to “she”. The biggest one was the one I honestly wanted to mean the most. How could I not forgive her without lying about it? “She”. “She”.

Shit. I realize, suddenly, in this oppressive dark with my addictions and my frustrations at losing a game I’m a literal professional at, that I knew I would be here. I’m in Hell. A very real and predictable Hell. Maybe that last time, when I cost the taxpayer a few hundred thousand dollars in medivac bills, I was successful in my sincere attempt to die and did just that. I must have died.

Once, after “she” had left, the door slamming behind her still ringing in my ears again and again, I thought of suicide. More than once. What kept me from doing it was my idea of what G-d would make my personal Hell for my sins against “she”. He, my G-d and yours, was going to put me in a lonely place, secure on one side of unbreakable and very clear glass and put “she” and “him” on the other. I would have to watch and listen, for an eternity of days and nights, with no respite or rests, their passions, their little inside jokes, their joys, maybe their wedding when they swore oaths and gave promises they both truly meant. They’d snuggle on the couch and watch the sorts of movies “she” and I used to. They’d smile at one another, truly in love. They’d share a life and grow old. ""She""’d do that little up and down bounce she did when she was happy. ""She""’d beam when she saw her first child. They’d make love while I screamed, while I scratched at that damned glass, while I clawed at my eyes, hoping to rip them from their sockets.

G-d damn it all. It all checks out. I can see it all now. Every throe, every arch of her back, every curl of her toes, every grasp of those French manicured nails at her sheets. And I could hear. Those gasps, those moans, that laugh. G-d damn it. I’m in Hell. And I deserve to be here.

G-d, how I wish I could fall back to sleep. Five years ago, almost six now, I guess, I wouldn’t have minded waking up, because it would mean another opportunity to wander to my bathroom, immaculate because I was, ostensibly, a stay-at-home dad, and find my pin, spoon, bag, and lighter.

Once I was done, five, almost six, years ago, I would walk quietly and check on Marie, who hadn’t shared a bed with me since the second year of our ten-year marriage, choosing instead to sleep alone or with someone who didn’t reflect, when she looked into my eyes, all the things she hated about herself. Technically, we had an open marriage, but I never partook. My lover was something else. Marie? Well, Marie was a lonely girl. She indulged, reveled in her freedom.

Truth be told, I loved the girl. Not the way I loved “she”, but there was love there, even as there is now. Marie never believed me, but I did. No, Marie never believed me, but why would she? Like her, I was a liar. That was the reflection in my eyes she hated seeing. I didn’t care. I was comfortable being a liar. Too comfortable.

After assuring myself Marie was fine, perhaps even forcing an unconscious smile from her by brushing her straight, long, brunette hair from her face, perhaps by gently caressing the soft skin of her flawless face and perfect skin, free of any mark or blemish, after I’d done that, just to prove she wasn’t carved from a block of ice, I would, perhaps stumbling a little now as each beat of my heart circulated the drugs through me, climb in between the beds of my sons, Robert and Adlai, and catch my nod on the floor, listening to the sounds of their breathing and pleasant murmurs of their dreams.

The nod. I used to live for the nod. Each sleepless and fitful night, when I envy the dogs and the dead their slumber, I recall the realizations that moralities would decay, priorities would fall by the wayside and be placed out of order, and as I pressed the plunger, slowly at first but then more and more quickly down, and further down still, realizing in that instant that I would have no control over this beautiful, brown and yellow, little liquid death.

This, “The Dogs and the Dead”, is meant to be the confession of a professional liar. For seven years now, men, those who know how and are ready and equipped, quite well, to do so, have been trying to kill me. I say well equipped but all they’d need is a twenty dollar bill or a rock of crack. That’s the way it comes these days.

They’re trying to kill me because I lied to them. They’re trying to kill me because I cost them millions in treasure and years in freedom. They’re trying to kill me so no one else makes the same mistakes I did by lying to them. They’re trying to kill me because, in a way, in their own particular and abusive way, they loved me. I was their chosen one. I was a dutiful son, a beloved and trusted little brother, a trusted teacher, a facilitator, even, at times, their confessor.

Because men are trying to kill me, and because men are trying to kill pretty much every character in this book, each one of them a professional liar by trade, a certain portion, a certain percentage of this book has to be made of written, bald-faced lies. Of course the names and places have been changed. Every fish gets bigger each time the story is told by sportsmen and the same is true of the stories of drug busts and undercover operations each time we meet, clandestinely or on-line, and retell the story to one another. The danger gets more imminent, more bullets fly, more bodies stack up, the girl who knew what I was doing and tried to tell her employers the truth gets a little closer to outing me. That’s just the way it goes. But, some things, some actions, even some of the lies, I have to lie about. There’s too much at stake. But the lies I tell, I will craft in such a way as to allow them a revelatory quality worth as much to you as the truth.

I’ve set a baseline of 89% truth. That’s what you’re getting, the 89% truth of the story behind one of the largest drug busts in a state or commonwealth’s history.

I watched a movie once that said you can tell the true war stories from the fake ones because there’s always an element of shame involved in the true ones. Well, there’s plenty of shame in this story. But I was trained to lie and had figured out that fact for myself long before my government recruited me and trained me to do so for a small paycheck, so it would be very easy for me to simply make things up and feign the grave sorts of shame one might feel for these supposed truths. Well, no one would admit to some of the things I’ve done, not in public anyway. No, reader, you’ll know my shame, see each stain on the dirty laundry of my deeds hung out for all to see, and perhaps, be revolted by who I am. You’ll just have to trust me, a liar by trade and by craft, to tell you 89% of the truth.

You lie. I lie. Judges lie. Politicians lie. Cops lie...a lot. Marie sucks at it but does it. Every working girl on the streets lies, if you’ve used them, you know that. And every junky in the alleys, if you’ve ever met one or been one, you know that, too. You’ll hear their lies, their professional and self-serving lies, some of which you may have told yourself, in “Dogs and the Dead”.

Every lie is self-serving, even the ones we delude ourselves into believing are for someone else’s benefit. If ever a person told a lie that wasn’t, it was “she”. “She” was genuine and kind. But, perhaps there was some benefit to “she” that I simply didn’t figure out. In the end, I, a professional and paid liar, was taken down by a liar who wasn’t even particularly good at what she did. Don’t say that’s irony. My friends in prison know I simply detest it when people use that word the wrong way. Irony is when your action had an outcome the opposite of what your intent. Most people confuse irony with coincidence. Newsmen confuse irony with tragedy, for some reason. Honestly, what happened to me, what Marie did to me, was nothing but simple, pure, undiluted justice.

It was justice because I deserved every bit of it. All of the feelings of betrayal and frustration. Perhaps it’s my absolution, this suffering. Perhaps, this is how I avoid Hell if I’m not already, as I posit, there. She found her mark. Something worse than the known and bad liar Marie is to all around her. Marie found a junky ex-con. People prefer to believe a “good” person to someone who must be, by definition, the epitome of bad.

It would be both to hyperbolize, spellcheck doesn’t recognize that word but I’m sure it exists, and to lie to say that I had done some, in depth, cost-benefit analysis of what I might lose when I committed my life to crime and its various forms. I mean, of course, I’m a smart guy, really smart the tests say, too smart my mother says, so of course I thought about the consequences. Relatively thoroughly, too. But, damn it all, if I don’t sit here kicking myself for not figuring out that Marie might, just might get the better of me if I got caught. I’m too smart for that. I should have thought of that. Damn it all.

I usually type out there, by the serene lake, atop the earthen dam, acknowledging the ducks and wondering about those ripples, awaiting the final verdict. One which may well come today, or never arrive at all.

I know my parent’s neighbors, some of them anyway, are addicts. Hell, I used to sell to some of them. Not directly. I don’t think I ever sold more than an individual bag one time and that was when I needed gas money. No, I’m up the food chain. Not too far up, but far enough to make some serious money and far enough to not be expendable. I’m too smart to be a dealer. But still. They’re here. They wave to me as they pass and offer knowing smiles, thanking me for not exposing their little secrets. So it could be today. It could be before I finish typing this sentence. They’re all hunters and they all own many, many guns. Hell, the four pounds of rearward pressure might even now be setting an iron trigger’s journey, a trip of just one or two millimeters rearward, in motion.

But, the streets have a short memory. Anyone who’s lived on them or grew up running them knows that. Nah, these old, white, conservative folks probably don’t care now or never, in fact, actually did. But, who knows, right? A junky is a junky. Their morals, like mine, have long since been eroded by the slow drip of heroin addiction’s grip. Maybe one of them needs a few bucks and is watching me every day, when I walk my parent’s dogs, biding their time until it can look like a “hunting accident”, “stray bullet”, or “loss of vehicular control”. Maybe they just don’t like me because of what I did and the few bucks would be nothing more than a bonus for getting even with me. Maybe there’s a set of cross-hairs on me now. I doubt it. If it comes for me it’s gonna be the twenty dollar method. But even that probably won’t happen.

The streets have a short memory.

New betrayals have been committed on the streets. New, many new, lies have been told, though every lie has been both told and heard before, especially on the streets. New lairs have come and gone, telling their own twist of those lies. New Judases, junkies and working girls looking for a way out of their stay in County or Upstate, have both arisen and been seen to fall or have met their end in the presence of no known witnesses aside from the cold and uncaring eyes of their professional executioners. Professional. Funny word for a crack head with a rock and a twenty. But, in the most technical sense, it’s true. He’s being paid. He’s a professional killer.

Some, more than a few, of them, those new Judases who sought to claim the throne I abdicated, have “accidentally overdosed”, not really the chosen method of vengeance these days, the twenty dollar method is easier. Others have been found , the ubiquitous .22 caliber hole in the back of their head, but those are the ones they need to do like that. Sending a message to others, and all. And many, more than you’d ever imagine, simply disappear, unmourned, unloved, unremarked.

Undoubtedly, men like me, the paid, the professional, the trained liars are still fighting that good fight. It’s been seven years since they’ve started hunting me and it’s not exactly like I’m hiding. Or maybe it’s just that old truism that hiding in plain sight is the last thing they’d expect. Or maybe, as I suspect, I’m just not all that important to anyone anymore. That’s probably it.

1h8woxt,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1h8woxt/private_estate_weekend_wedding_in_northern_ca_for/,Private Estate Weekend Wedding in Northern CA for 130 people - 61K,"We got married mid October at the my family's property outside of Auburn, CA. We do not live in CA, but many of the my (bride) family and friends are based in CA or NV. The rest of our guests (\~40%) live along the east coast. We invited \~165 people, and had 135 attendees - we had NO no-shows, and a few folks who RSVP'd no showed up unexpectedly! Here is the budget breakdown for our luxury, rustic wedding. I broke down the budget for each event and have the overall below. 

**Venue set-up & event planning for all events ($15,550)**

We knew these category would the the most expensive line items going into planning, but I was surprised how much more expensive it ended up being than going with an established venue. There were numerous reasons why we wanted to have it at the family property, and my family doesn't regret it, but doing so substantially increased the cost of the wedding, and it was a TON of work. We had the rest of the weekend events here, in part to justify the cost.

* Full-Service Wedding Planner ($8,000) - WORTH EVERY PENNY. We worked with her for over a year, she handled all direct communication with vendors, and included event coordination for set up, the welcome party, and the entire wedding day. 
* Private event insurance ($300) - We wanted to have wine on the tables, which voided our bartenders insurance. So, at their suggestion, got our own. Relatively low cost for peace of mind.
* Dumpster ($150) - DO NOT forget about the waste that will be generated. Our catering vendors were not able to take trash with them, so we rented a dumpster from the county. The property owners needed to request: I couldn't do it on behalf of my parents. 
* Bathroom trailers ($1,500) - A necessary for private estate events, IMO. 
* Sail tent rental & install ($9,000) - This was our biggest splurge, but it made the entire aesthetic.  
* Dance floor ($700) - There was a whole hullabaloo here. We were originally going to rent with the sailcloth tent for \~$900, but the vendor changed their policy and wouldn't let us place the floor on DG substrate. We would have needed to move the dancefloor out from the tent onto concrete, or spend an additional $500 on turf to place between the floor and the DG. So instead, my mom bought thick stall mats from Tractor Supply and we laid them out as the dance floor. Not competition worthy, but fine for jumping around to ABBA. And now she can reuse those mats in the barn or horse trailers.
* Rentals ($4,500) - included farm tables, chairs, plates, utensils, glasses, coffee makers, and cake stands.
* Decor & Misc ($400) - string lights, trash cans and bags, water pitchers, water dispensers

**Lodging ($6,000)**

* Guest Lodging ($6,000) - This was our second biggest splurge, and most impulsive decision. We reserved a complex of tiny houses in town to but all our our young, partying (and often broke) friends.  To maximize the number of guests (\~40) we could host, we wanted to assign cabins. It was complicated and was going to be messy - some friends would have ended up paying more just because we didn't want to have them sharing rooms with folks they hadn't met yet (or friends they had complicated history with). To avoid it all, we just gifted everyone the lodging! It was worth it - friends from different parts of our lives were having fun and getting to know each other. It felt like summer camp and it was where had our afterparty as well.

**Welcome Party ($2,800)**

This was a casual dinner for folks to come as they got into town. We estimate that \~80 people attended over the course of 3 hours.

* Catering ($2,000) - We had a beloved local Mexican food truck. They were so much fun and did a great job,  We met the minimum, which was $1500.  
* Beer & Wine ($700) - we had two pony kegs of local craft beer (\~$400). I was hoping there would be left overs for the after party but they were shot! I think we also probably went through a case or two of wine.
* Compostable glassware ($100).

**Wedding Day ($36,515)**

* Catering ($4,000) - We went with a BBQ caterer. They brought and set up everything and I was super pleased with the quality (we didn't taste beforehand). We got 2 mains (pork and chicken) and three sides (mac & cheese, vegetarian baked beans, and pickle slaw), plus bread and butter. Our vegetarians got smoked pesto portabella mushrooms and everyone I spoke to who ate them RAVED about it. we got to keep the leftovers, of which there was probably 30 lbs.
* Grazing table ($1,600) - I genuinely never saw this, and I don't think there's a picture in the gallery. So, I have NO IDEA if it was good or not, but we needed to give folks something to eat during the 90 min cocktail hour and was wanted something lighter before BBQ. We only got a table for \~100 people and my mom said that she only saw it basically empty.
* Bartending ($2,200) - It was really important for me to have a professional handling the alcohol, in case anyone needed to be cut off. We did 2 signature cocktails (boulevardier with cynar & a mezcal paloma), simple mixed drinks, pre-ceremony champagne service, table wine, and various non-alcoholic options guests could just grab. I wish we had taken advantage of their expertise to have more fun with the signature cocktails. 
* Liquor ($1,300) - We followed our bartenders recommendation for liquor amounts, and purchased the liquor for cocktails through them so they could batch in advance (saved us from having to pay them for extra labor on the day-of, and we got a distributor's discount). The amounts felt super skewed towards the cocktail (they recommended 3 cocktail servings per person, and 2 servings of beer and wine combined per person). We ultimately went with their recommendation, but I wish we had trusted my gut because we had \~1 gal of batched boulevardier and half a case of mezcal left over. 
* Beer & Wine ($1,000) - $600 for assorted beers;  $400 for 5 cases of champagne and 2 case of white wine; the red wine was donated by my family.
* Florals ($6,000) - This got us a CRAZY amount of flowers. We were totally unprepared for how many flowers there were, and how stunning the arrangements were. We bought all of the vases and shipped them to the florist so there wasn't s strike fee.  My biggest regret was not arranging to donate them the day after. We send as many home with local folks as we could.
* Photography ($6,000) - We got 8 hours of coverage with a second shooter, a professional album, and full gallery in 7 weeks. The package originally included an engagement shoot, but since we couldn't fly out to CA, she added flim photography, which we LOVE! I do wish that we had got photography coverage for the welcome dinner (or really just the entire weekend), but the photos we have are SPETACULAR.
* DJ ($2,200) - Included sound for ceremony and some dance floor lighting. He did a great job setting up for sound in 3 different locations, and brought his own power since we were a bit worried about overdrawing the system at the barn. 
* Transportation ($2,300) - we rented a school bus to take people to and from the wedding. It was super fun and we took it with everyone at the end of the night to the afterparty spot! Bonus points, it was inexplicably playing ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" on the TVs which is a detail by husband I and still laugh about. 
* Decor & Misc ($600) - this included table runners, oil lamps, candles, candlesticks, cake stands, pie servers, and disposables for cake.
* Favors & Guestbooks ($600) - everyone got mini honey bears. I'm not sure how many were left, but they were very cute on the table settings. We used a lab notebook as a guestbook, thrifted a vintage polaroid, and have everyone take photos with it. FYI most of this cost is the honey and film.
* Wedding party gifts ($400) - we got everyone bolo ties, and a thank you gift for our officiant.
* Dessert ($400) - We had a small two tiered cake, and an assortment of other cakes and pies. There were leftovers, which we ate at the send off the next day.
* Coffee & Tea ($200) - nice instant coffee and teas for the hot water dispense. We purchased two insulated carafes for creamers and compostable coffee cups and utensils.
* Wait staff ($400) - We poached from the wedding venue next door and paid under the table.
* Bride’s Apparel ($3,720) - $550 ceremony dress + tailoring; $330 reception dress plus tailoring; $2000 rings (antique engagement and custom band); $50 shapewear, $60 jewelry; $120 shoes; $80 matching tracksuit for after party; $40 welcome party dress; $40 cashmere sweater 
* Groom’s Apparel ($2,250) - $1200 suit from Suit Supply; $150 custom made shirt; $60 bolo tie; $60 cologne; $700 vintage wedding band; $80 tracksuit. 
* Stationary & Website ($545) - We used all Zola products. It was nice to have it all in one place, and they have frequent sales. I did not feel limited by the designs. All our stationary was purchased with 40-50% coupons. $90 Save-the-dates, $280 invitations, $115 thank you cards; $60 postage.
* HAMU ($600) - I did my hair and make-up myself, so the cost is just for products. I recommend ULTA instead of Sephora exclusively because of their 90 day return policy. It was fun to learn, and I love the way I look in my photos - incandescently happy and like myself. I will be shouting from the rooftops that folks who don't wear makeup do not need to wear a ton on their wedding days.  
* Gratuity ($300) - We tipped the wait staff and our planner and her assistant. I have complicated feelings about this and think we probably should have tipped more, but we were feeling very cash poor. We intend to send our wedding planner an additional gratuity on our 1-year anniversary.

**Send-off Brunch ($200)**

This was a super casual, nurse your hangover event. We had leftover cake, pie, BBQ, and bagels alongside mimosas and LiquidIV. I think \~50 people dropped by on their way out of town, and we piled them with leftovers and flowers. If I were to do this again, I would also buy to-go containers for guests.

* bagels & smear ($150)
* disposable buffet chafing dishes ($50)

**Total: $61,065 (\~$452/person)**

My parents generously paid for everything except for our wardrobes, rings, beauty, gifts, stationary, and gratuity.",5,1733590494.0,weddingplanning,0,1.0,False

1h8wo99,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h8wo99/sorrows/,Sorrows,"She looked just like my mother.

That's what I thought when I saw her crouching in the gutter, vomiting God-knows-what into the road. The streetlights illuminated a gaunt figure with stringy blonde hair, pale skin and a huge patchwork cardigan. My mother had been a kindergarten teacher before cancer took her. She always wore bright, soft clothing like that, even on her days off.

I don’t usually approach homeless people. Maybe that makes me a bad person, but you hear all these scams about people begging then getting into a brand-new Mercedes when the night falls. Or wasting their money on booze and drugs. My mother would never have done any of those things. I think that’s why I approached her.

“Excuse me… are you okay?” was the most stupid question I could’ve asked, but I went with it anyway. Up close, she looked a bit less like my mother. Her green eyes were darker, and she had a thin, pale scar stretching from the top of her eyebrow to the beginnings of her hairline.

“Do I look okay to you?” is something my mother would definitely have said back. My face reddened. The woman - *not my mother*, I tried to remember - wiped her mouth on her sleeve, as though I wasn’t there.

“Well, should I take you to see a doctor…?” Up close, she looked about as exhausted and miserable as any person I have ever seen. The bags under her eyes were heavy and dark. When she belched, I saw a couple of teeth were missing.

“I’d rather have a roof over my head. These nights are cold, you know.” She stopped and gave me a long once-over. I was wearing a thick fleece jacket, gloves, and a scarf knitted by my best friend. My arms were laden with gifts bought for the festive season. My face turned even redder. I felt like a glutton under the gaze of this woman who I’d only just met.

The woman stood up and stepped closer. This close, she reeked of unwashedness and a stale something I couldn’t place. But there was something else underneath. Lavender. Beneath the dirt, she had the exact same scent as my mother’s old lavender perfume.

“Poppy Poppet, have you got a place for me to stay?” Her whisper was hoarse but kind.

Poppy Poppet. I hadn’t heard that nickname since the day my mother died.



\*\*\*



I set her up in the guest room, making sure the nicest sheets were on the bed. It’s a small room, but cosy enough with room for the odd bits and bobs the woman had brought with her. Somehow, I hadn’t noticed her bag at first. It was huge, more like Santa’s sack than anything. It contained blankets, small bags of snacks, tobacco, and some strange things, too. Like a crumpled picture of a woman and her child, too blurry to make out any strong details. But the child had bobbed blonde hair and a pink dress I remembered throwing a fit about wearing when I was seven years old. Inside a small Ziploc bag, she kept a small cluster of baby teeth. I tried not to stare at them too much, but of course she noticed.

“From a little girl who looks just like you,” she said, cackling. “I reckon if I plant them some day, something might grow.”

The other things were equally bizarre. There was a clay figure of a fox, missing an ear, wrapped in newspaper. My mother had loved watching the foxes in our garden at dawn, running back towards the woods. Had I made a clay fox for her, once?

Finally, she had a small coin purse. Inside were… coins, of course. But also some other things. A tiny square of paper folded many times. I was too polite to ask to see, but again, she saw me looking.

“This?” she asked. “This, now, is my most prized possession. Since you’re so nice and gave me a room, I’ll show it to you.”

When she unfolded the picture, my heart leapt into my throat. It was a child’s drawing of a woman with bright yellow hair and green eyes. She wore a rainbow jumper, baby blue jeans and had bright orange circles for feet. In one hand, she held an ice cream cone dripping onto the floor. In the other, she held the hand of a familiar little girl.

MUMMY I LOVE YOU FOREVER FROM POPPY.

I didn’t need to see the wax scribbles to remember that day in art class. I had been upset because Danny Keenan had broken the best green crayon, so I had to use a different shade for my mothers eyes. I also remembered taking it home to share with my mother. I was bursting with pride when she pinned it to the refrigerator.

LOVE YOU FOREVER. The woman didn’t say anything. She just smiled.



\*\*\*



She stayed in my house for six days. During that time, she was a model guest. That first day, I woke up thinking she must’ve robbed me in my sleep, or would be waiting around the door with a kitchen knife and my wallet in hand. Neither of those things happened. Instead, I woke up to the smell of freshly-cooked bacon. She raided the fridge, and put together an almost-passable English breakfast. Just like my mother - never too good at cooking.

We settled into a routine quite quickly. She left the house when I went to work. I never dared ask where she went, but she always came back with her coin purse a little heavier. Some days, she came back with stranger things. One was another small photograph in black and white, of a little boy and his white-haired grandmother. “Cried when giving me that,” she announced proudly through a mouthful of cottage pie. Another was a child’s plastic charm bracelet, with pink and purple beads spelling out the name JENNIFER. She didn’t want to talk about that one at all, and buried it at the bottom of her sack.

But every night, the woman vomited - around midnight, some perverse Cinderella’s curse. Before I fell asleep, I would hear her run to the bathroom to throw up whatever she had eaten. It reminded me of my mother’s long days of chemotherapy. A few times, I called out to see if she was okay, but never received a response. Perhaps she was sick and too embarrassed to tell me? I considered calling a doctor, but really, she seemed perfectly well at all other times. Maybe she had an anxious stomach? I tried to bury it in the back of my mind.

Those six days seem like a blur now. It felt like I had my mother back. The first day, I was at the village shop right as it opened and bought lavender-scented everything - soap, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, the works. After she showered, my house reeked of my mother’s scent. I also gave her a few things to keep her busy - a romantic novel my mother had read a hundred times while waiting for chemotherapy, and a pair of slippers she’d worn around the house for as long as I could remember without them ever getting faded or dirty. The woman accepted these gifts like treasures, but she never asked what they meant. Sometimes, I thought I saw tears in her eyes.

I never thought to ask for her name. The answer seemed so clear in my head.

On the sixth day, I took the day off work and cooked my mother’s favourite meal - roast beef, potatoes, vegetables, Yorkshire puddings and thick gravy. For dessert, I spent hours carefully re-reading her old recipe book to make the cake she’d always prepared on my birthday. It was chocolate, filled with jam and cream, and covered in small red and white piped flowers. Instead of an age, however, I just piped the word MOTHER.

That’s the only time I ever saw the woman look angry - but just for a second. It flashed into her eyes so quickly, I thought I had mistaken it. But her mouth hardened into a line and her eyes seemed to tear up again. Quickly, I realised she wasn’t angry with me. Somehow, she seemed angry at herself.

“Mothe– I mean, sorry, is everything okay?”

“Yes, Poppy Poppet,” she said, thought the smile on her face seemed to tremble. “You have done me good - ever so well. Any mother would be proud to have a daughter like you.”

I couldn’t hide the happiness in my face. I only wished that hers didn’t look so tired. I almost asked the question - almost. But something was still stopping me.

It didn’t matter. On the seventh day, the woman told me everything.



\*\*\*



“I’m not your mother, Poppy.”

The woman spoke while buttering some lightly-burned toast the next morning. I was halfway through a mouthful of baked beans. Trying not to choke, I struggled to answer.

“W-What?”

“Look. I know I look just like her. We have the same habits and clothes. Hell, I even smell like her now, thanks to you. But I am not your mother.” Her smile was the kindest and most painful I have ever seen. “I am so grateful to you, and so, so sorry. But I can’t be her forever.”

My mind was racing. I remembered a hundred little things. When she read the romance novel, she folded the corners of the pages just like my mother used to do (to my deep annoyance). Neither of them could cook anything without it coming out a little bit wrong. Her cardigan was identical to one my mother wore in a school photo - secretly, I had scoured through photo albums and found the match. They both had a slightly nasal laugh, brushed their hair behind their ears with the same gesture, belched like pigs after a good meal and didn’t care for anything cooked too spicy. They wore the same size clothes and shoes - before my mother’s chemotherapy, I mean. Blonde hair and green eyes. The baby teeth. The drawing. POPPY POPPET.

“But the drawing?”

“It shows you whatever you want to see, darling. Take another look.” She took out the same piece of paper and held it in front of my face.

“Think of your happiest memory. Something that always brings joy to your face. Go on.”

As I thought, the crayon scribbles seemed to rearrange themselves. I saw myself, my mother and my father on a trip to the zoo. My parents had bought me a stuffed lemur almost as big as myself. I had wrapped the striped tail around my neck like a scarf. My father was doing impressions of the animals to make us laugh. My mother wore the same cardigan as her kindergarten days, and held ice cream cones for all of us.

“H-How is this possible–”

“Now think of your worst memory. The one that still breaks your heart, again and again. You know it.”

I didn’t want to, but it flooded back so fast I could barely keep up with the flowing crayon scribbles. First I saw my father, lying in a hospital bed after the accident. He’d been crushed by a forklift at work. His lower half was covered by many thick blankets to stop me seeing the gore, but a little blood seeped through. He’d wanted to see me one last time, knowing he was too hurt to survive.

Next, of course, was my mother. The sight of so many tubes and wires attached to her, like Medusa’s snakes, turned me to stone. I couldn’t look away from the beeping of the machines, or the paleness of her face, or the baldness of her head that looked so vulnerable beneath the fluorescent hospital lights. I wish someone had given her a cap to cover it.

Tears ran down my face into my breakfast. The woman was crying too, but her sadness was strange. I was a mess of tears and snot, but her tears ran down her face perfectly straight. Her nose didn’t run, nor did her eyes look red. It was as though she had a computer animation running on her face.

“We call ourselves the Sorrows. We come from nowhere, and we have nobody and nothing. We don’t know what we are. We live as humans, and change to meet how humans wish to perceive us. For some, it’s their parents, others, even their children or ex-lovers. It’s the only way we can receive any kindness in this cold, cold world.”

I thought of every poor street beggar I had ever turned my nose up to. I thought of Not-My-Mother, vomiting into the gutter like a round of chemo gone bad.

“Why do this? Why pretend to be my mother? *How* can you do this?”

“It’s how we survive. It’s remarkably easy to get any information from your brains. I know all of your likes and dislikes. I could describe any life story in great detail. For example, your sixteenth birthday. Your mother had baked a cake, just like the one you made yesterday for me. But you were angry because of an argument with your best friend, and wanted to cancel the party altogether. Your mother tried to be patient, but in the end, both of you were yelling at each other. When the first guests arrived, you were still arguing, but half an hour later with the party in full swing, you had forgiven each other completely.”

I sniffled. “And then?”

“And then your best friend arrived an hour late. Amy was never on time, but she had brought you a present. Two, actually. One was a kids friendship necklace - two hearts that fit together, as an ironic kind of apology. The other was a CD you’d been wanting for months. You gave her the biggest slice of birthday cake, and turned your living room into a nightclub filled with dancing and the smallest glasses of wine.”

I could feel the gift paper pressed into my hands. The pounding of that year’s most popular song echoed in my ears. Amy, always smelling of vanilla perfume, had her hands on my shoulders as we slow-danced, giggling and pretending to be madly in love. Only I wasn’t quite pretending.

“People like you are kind, but you’d never let any old stranger into your home. I understand that. Humans can be dangerous. But you also turn your eyes from us on the streets. If I were an old man, would you stop to see me vomit in the road? If I were a runaway, would you offer me money or a hotel room to stay in?”

I didn’t need to answer. My shame spoke for me.

“You are kind to me because you want your mother back. That doesn’t mean you are a cruel or ungenerous person. It simply makes you human. But I can’t bring her back. Your mother will always be dead. And I really am just a Sorrow. I can’t stay here forever.”

My head snapped up. “What? Why not?” I gestured to the kitchen scene around us. We looked as comfortably domestic as any mother and daughter. “We could pretend. You’d have a roof over your head, and maybe I’d have… have a family…”

The shaking of her head broke my heart again. “You’d start to notice the cracks. The parts of me that aren’t quite like her. You still don’t like to see my scar, do you?” I blushed. It was true. I always averted my eyes from the thin line striping her face. “And darling, my eyes will never, ever be green enough. These are all little things. But I promise. Those would increase in time.”

She smiled sadly. Her face showed more compassion than I deserved.

My grief was a physical thing, just like it had been when my mother really died. It felt like hands were gripping my heart, and squeezing out all the good and bad memories of my mother with it. The strength of it made it hard to breathe as I fell back into my chair, willing the memories to either stop or take me away for good.

“So what will you do now?” I was surprised I could even manage the words.

The woman finished eating her toast. “Today, I will go walking again. Tonight, I will pack my things and leave in the morning. It is time for me to move on. But it has been lovely knowing you, Poppy Poppet.”

She rose from the table and began to wash the dishes - the best china, I’d set out especially for her. I stayed put, my mouth now shut tight, thick tears still leaking from swollen eyes. I was only vaguely aware of the woman moving around the kitchen - drying dishes, scraping away the abandoned food from my plate, and finally fishing out some tissues to dry my eyes.

I blew my nose and looked up at her face. Her scar seemed more severe than before. Would that make it easier, if I focused on all of the wrongness and none of the right?

I still had a hundred questions to ask the woman. At this time, I chose only one.

“Why do you go walking?”

The woman stood still. Emotions played over her face like a child flicking through a flipbook.

“Sorrows like us need to eat, and not your ordinary kind of food. It’s best if you don’t ask too much.”

A few minutes later, the woman was ready to go walking. I stood by the gate and waved her goodbye. She was wearing my mother’s cardigan, and clutching an empty sack.



\*\*\*



Before the woman left that night, I crept into her room. I knew she was awake and could see me. I didn’t care. I tiptoed over and opened the sack she had filled with belongings again.

I saw some of the same things. Blankets, baby teeth, the drawing that showed my mother again. Also some new things. A man’s watch, old but still ticking. A thin wad of cash. A generic greetings card that looked like it had been written in a hurry, with a fifty-pound note folded inside.

And then, some scraps of clothing. They looked like t-shirts and jeans, all covered with blood and bits of gore. Someone - or something - had been torn into bits, from the looks of things. I considered asking. I didn’t.

Holding back tears, I added my own bundle to the sack. A bottle of lavender perfume. A box of the biscuits my mother had always bought whenever they went on sale. A bottle of red wine, gifted to us one Christmas and still untouched. A bundle of her t-shirts and long, flowing skirts. And of course, the patchwork cardigan.

When I left the next morning, it was as though the room had never been touched at all.



\*\*\*



I’ve met other Sorrows since then. I try to give a little money or food to any homeless person I see. Sometimes, it’s clear they’re drunk or on drugs. I don’t let it bother me. We all have our demons, but we still deserve care.

I met some familiar faces there, too. One looked like Amy. She also stayed for six days. We talked about the argument we’d had that birthday - how I’d had a huge crush on her, but she was as straight as a ruler. I found the matching friendship necklace she’d bought and wore it under my shirt. We made mooncakes together and talked about how much she’d missed me as a child when she went back to Taiwan every summer. She even taught me a little Mandarin. After the Sorrow left, I called the real Amy for the first time in years. She’s married now, with twin sons and a wonderful husband who volunteers at a homeless shelter. I still haven’t found the nerve to ask him about the Sorrows.

Another Sorrow I met looked like my grandfather. I only knew him for the first few years of my life. When I think of him, I remember the smell of peppermint sweets and the endless carpentry he’d do in his garage. We spent a lot of time together doing things we never had a chance to do - him “teaching” me how to drive, hearing his own father’s stories about the war, and me learning a hundred little stories from discovering his love of carpentry to discovering his love for my grandmother. After his six days, he left me an immaculately carved wooden poppy on my kitchen table.

I never tried to look through their things. Sometimes they came home with blood on their clothes. Each Sorrow apologised profusely, and I never saw so much as a speck when it was time to do the laundry. It took a lot of effort not to wonder where it came from.



\*\*\*



When the last Sorrow left, I followed him.

He looked like my uncle. The oldest child of his generation, he’d passed away in my teens after a life of excitement. I remembered him as short, dark-skinned, pot-bellied and with thick, bleached-blonde hair that never seemed to thin or turn grey. He always wore the same jacket to family reunions - purple suede; we always jokingly compared him to Prince. We had parties every night for the six days we spent together. He drank enough wine to drown a man, and showed me drinking games even my university days hadn’t taught me. Even with his stature, he danced effortlessly with the grace of a rockstar too cool to acknowledge the audience cheering at his feet. He always called my Pops, never Poppy, and made jokes about the heavy-lidded eyes and strong jaw I’d inherited from my father.

I didn’t plan to follow him. I just did. After I heard the door close that seventh morning, I put on my warm winter jacket and packed a bag full of warm blankets and snacks, just in case I met any homeless people on the way. The thick snow falling from the sky made it easy to follow his footsteps from a distance. The air was so chill, I shivered in my winter coat. I doubted the Sorrow’s purple suede was enough to keep him warm.

But as he walked, he seemed to *blur*. It happened like my glasses were steaming up after entering a hot room. He grew taller and thinner, and the purple suede jacket faded into a thin, navy shirt. His hair was grey and straggly. I couldn’t see his face, but I knew it had to be creased with wrinkles.

Was this the Sorrow’s true form? Even from a blurred distance, the pity I felt for him was overwhelming. He looked just like any elderly man with nowhere to go, bumbling about the streets of the city. Eventually he stopped outside a coffee shop and put down his sack beside a nearby bench. It had bars built in, so he couldn’t lie down. Instead, he took out a blanket and wrapped it around his shoulders. Entering the coffee shop, he had a short conversation with the barista. I could see the sympathy on her face. She gave him two cups - one steaming with coffee, and the other empty. When he settled on the bench outside, he left the empty cup perched in the snow before him. He didn’t need to write a message.

I walked over to him and unzipped my backpack. Silently, I gave him another blanket, a packet of crisps and a handful of coins. He nodded slowly and said nothing. I went into the café and chose a window seat.

Lots of the people walking by paid the Sorrow no interest, even as the snow gathered upon his shoulders. Still, some were kind. One carefully dumped the snow out of his coffee cup and wiped the coins inside dry with her scarf. Another helped him shake his blanket free of snow. Some gave him loose change, and twice he was given drinks from the coffee shop. But a few of the passers-by seemed to recognise him.



The first one looked like she’d been hit by a truck. She was an older woman, with thick black hair and dark eyes. The moment she saw him, she stopped dead. People complained as they moved around her. The Sorrow himself had changed so fast, it took me a moment to notice his own thick black hair and olive skin.



The woman babbled something excitedly in Spanish and the Sorrow replied, laughing as though he weren’t sitting upon a freezing street. Though I understood little, it was clear she was offering to help. Strangely though, he seemed reluctant to follow her down the street. Eventually, the woman opened her purse and emptied the contents into his cup as the Sorrow thanked her profusely. Then, she took the scarf from her neck and wound it around his.

I made eye contact with the Sorrow as the woman left. He showed nothing on his face.

The other was a man who looked to be in his late sixties. He was a tall Asian man who walked with a cane, and held a bundle of shopping bags in his other hand. I saw the exact moment he spotted the Sorrow - now a girl with long braided hair, dark eyes and a school uniform that looked foreign. He didn't quite stop dead. But he moved towards her, slowly and carefully, until they stood watching each other closely. Neither of them exchanged words.

Cautiously, the man opened one of his shopping bags and pulled out a gift. Handing it to the Sorrow, he muttered just one sentence that I was able to lip read.

“You look just like she did. Please, take care.”

The Sorrow unwrapped the gift after the man struggled away. It was a stuffed toy of a popular children’s character. Attached to it was a note I could just read from the window.

*My daughter, I remember and miss you every day. I hope you have a wonderful, heavenly Christmas. With love, from your doting father.*



\*\*\*



Hours passed. The snow continued to fall.

It was late afternoon when the Sorrow began to change again. The streets were packed with people returning home from work. Clutching my third hot chocolate of the day, I held the book half-heartedly in front of me as I pressed my nose to the window. The blurring was easier to see at this angle. This time I saw a woman in her twenties, with long, curly hair and beautiful dark skin. As she blurred, the Sorrow’s clothing changed to a stained woollen dress with matching red mittens. A hole in one of them meant her fingers poked through. She wore battered brown boots with the laces missing and drooping knee socks patterned with hearts. More than anything, she looked like a student fallen on hard times.

As soon as she began to move, I discarded my book and followed her. She moved slowly, as though walking caused her pain, and I noticed one of her legs was slightly shorter than the other. Without thinking, I followed her through the increasing snow, across streets, down alleys, until we were in a completely different part of the city. Still, no one but me seemed to have noticed her.

We reached a park. The Sorrow sat on one bench. I sat on the opposite. We simply sat and observed each other. For a brief moment, I saw my father’s eyes in her face. The moment passed. The Sorrow toyed with a thread from the damaged mitten.

The man appeared as the sun set.

Tall, tanned, blonde and muscular. He wore a suit that looked like it cost more than my monthly rent. His shoes were polished leather, and his scarf had to be cashmere. All that he needed was a briefcase to complete the look.

He had barely turned the corner before he saw the Sorrow. He stopped dead.

His voice was weaker than I had expected. “J-Julia? Is that you?”

The Sorrow said nothing. She only looked at him with cold, emotionless eyes. A bruise started to form, just below her left cheekbone.

The man looked on the edge of panic, but he seemed unable to move. “Julia, this can’t be you. Say you’re not her. How can you be here? How did you find me?”

With every word, something new happened to the Sorrow. Her nose, struck by an invisible punch. Her clothes looked more and more tattered. One of her eyes filled red with blood. One arm hung loosely, clearly broken at the wrist.

“Answer me! What is happening? How are you here?”

As the Sorrow stood, her jaw unhinged like that of a snake. Her teeth were pointed.

“You thought you had killed me and gotten away with it, Brian.”

The man clamped his mouth shut. He still seemed unable to move.

“You beat me, day and night. You said it was because you loved me so much, you couldn’t bear other men looking at me. Or my male friends texting me. Or my parents disliking you. Or a hundred more petty, little things. Sometimes, you’d just had a bad day. So you beat me. But I loved you, so I stayed.”

I wasn’t sure if the man would ever speak again.

“But one day, you came home from work drunk. You’d had a fight with your boss over a missed promotion, then stopped at a bar on the way home. You were very drunk, and *very* angry. I tried to embrace you. You pushed me into a wall.”

A horrific injury was forming on the back of the Sorrow’s head. It was like someone had caved in her skull with a bat, or maybe a bottle. Old, blackened blood matted her hair.

“I tried to apologise, but every “sorry” seemed to make it worse. You hit me, again and again, and I begged you to stop. The more I begged, the worse it got. So I became quiet. I wanted you to leave me alone, but my silence seemed to give you a different idea. You left me, broken and sobbing on the kitchen floor, and came back with a rolling pin from the kitchen.”

The only other sound was the snow falling gently around us. The Sorrow moved closer.

“That was a real dick move, Brian. I’d been using that rolling pin to make biscuits for my grandmother’s birthday. But instead, you used it to cave in my skull. You beat me so many times, it stopped feeling like a wound and more like the pounding of my poor, broken heart. When I died, I wasn’t even mad at you. I only wondered what I had done to make you so angry.”

Have you ever seen a rabbit, knowing it’s about to be caught by a fox? That’s how this man looked when the Sorrow finally stopped before him.

“Julia wasn’t mad at you, Brian. But I am.”

Her jaw shot out and those sharp teeth seemed to extend as they punctured his face. Screaming, the man sunk to his knees, the Sorrow descending on him like a monster desperate to feed. All I could do was watch as she devoured him without mercy - blood, guts, bones and all. I expected the snow to turn red, but his blood seemed to fly towards the Sorrow with a magnetic force. His wailing only ended after she clawed the heart from his chest and stripped it into pieces with her new, talon-like claws. With every piece swallowed, her injuries seemed to heal a little, until the only sign of the man was the shredded, expensive suit on the ground.

Finally, when it was over, the Sorrow looked over to me. Panic seized me. Would she let me live, knowing what I’d seen? But I too felt too paralyzed by fear to run. I didn’t want to become another bundle of fabric on the ground, but my knees refused to let me stand up.

The Sorrow came and sat beside me. As she moved, she blurred and morphed and changed again. Finally, she became an image of my father.

“You have helped many Sorrows in this city. Providing you live a good and kind life, we will never harm you. The man you saw was a killer who ruined the life of a wonderful young woman. You know how poor the justice system is when the killer is white and the victim is not.” I nodded - this was a familiar conversation with my mixed-race father. “He got away with everything. I decided he needed to pay. Do you think I made the right decision?”

I stared at the mass of ruined clothing across the park.

“Brian Redfern was the oldest of three children. He has two living parents, both of whom doted on their children. He grew up upper-class and became a leading professor in neuroscience. His research saved many lives. He has a family who loves him, a close group of friends, and a new girlfriend who he has never so much as struck in anger. Do you think I made the right decision?”

The Sorrow put his hand on my knee. It felt warm and familiar, the same gesture my father used to make.

“After he killed Julia, he hid her body in a reservoir. It was found, and he was a suspect, but the evidence wasn’t enough. He had too many loyal supporters. Eventually, he was cleared of all charges. Julia’s killer was never named and her family misses her every day.”

“She deserved better,” was all I could think to say.

“She did,” the Sorrow nodded. “Brian felt remorse. Not enough to confess, but some. He quit drinking the day after he murdered Julia. He donated a great deal of money to help Julia’s family - they were much poorer than his. He still keeps in touch with her sister and listens to her grief. Is that kindness?”

“It’s grotesque.”

“Brian thought he could redeem himself. I have to feed, Poppy. All Sorrows must feed. We eat humans, and we try to eat the ones who we think deserve it. The murderers. The rapists. The child abusers. But it’s horrible work, even though we’re genetically meant to kill. It causes us great sorrow. Maybe Brian could have been redeemed if he’d turned himself in one day, and faced the consequences of his actions. Do you think I made the right decision?”

“Yes.” My answer was instantaneous. “You killed a monster to stay alive. That’s what heroes do in books and films.”

The Sorrow smiled sadly. “I’m no hero. I just want to live. No Sorrow understands where we came from, why we have to feed, and even how long we will live. I have lived a very long life, Poppy. I have fed upon many people, and been treated kindly by many more. Indeed, it’s the kindness people like you give us that sustains us as much as the people we consume.”

Tears stung my eyes. “But we’re not good people. We only help you because you remind us of people we love.”

“Humans are complicated beings. That much, we understand. It’s good to help people for any reason. But it’s also good to help people for selfish reasons. The most important thing is just to do good. Goodness will keep us all alive, until the end.”

I still had a hundred questions, but my head was buzzing. The Sorrow stood up and walked over to the shredded clothes. Whistling a tune from my childhood, he swept them into his sack.

I chose one question. The one that mattered the most.

“Don’t go. Will you stay with me? I have a room waiting for you.”

1h8wn5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1h8wn5g/aeropress_general_qs/,AeroPress General Qs,"Hey everyone, I just got an AeroPress and have been reading through this community. I made two brews this morning and need some help. I followed the basic how-to guide and it worked but not as well as I thought it would. From what I understand, I have the V6 model original size. I’ve also got the stainless steel filter. 

I was using some random coffee that I was gifted recently and it’s pre-ground. I plan on using my coffee grinder or at least getting fresh beans and then getting it ground at my local coffee shop. 

For my first brew, I followed all the instructions using the stainless steel filter and nearly all the water just flowed right through it. When I put the plunger through, it barely had to go through any of the product. Led to a really dark coffee that had plenty of grittiness and grounds at the bottom of the cup. 

For my second brew, same thing as the first, but with the paper filter. I wet the filter and did everything else the same. Same thing happened but about 75% of the water went through as opposed to like 90% from the first batch. Wasn’t gritty but didn’t taste too great, a bit better than the first as I expected. 

So, what should I do here? What’s the general breakdown for newbies like me and if there’s a thread for this already, please direct me to it!

Am I doing something wrong? Is the stainless steel filter not that great and I should just suck it up and buy more paper filters? Is my coffee grind too small or large? Should I go the inverted route even though all signs are pointing towards no after seeing all the mess ups?

1h8wjou,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeHive/comments/1h8wjou/where_to_buy_breville_espresso_machine_filter/,Where to buy Breville espresso machine filter?,"Hey coffee enthusiasts!

I've been on a wild journey trying to find the perfect replacement filter for my Breville espresso machine, and I thought I'd share my experience to save you all some time and hassle.

After my old filter started showing signs of wear (weird-tasting coffee is always a red flag), I went on a mission to find a genuine replacement. Let me tell you, there are tons of knock-offs out there that can actually damage your machine. Trust me, I learned this the hard way with a cheap alternative that almost ruined my precious coffee maker.

The thing about Breville espresso machines is that they're pretty sophisticated pieces of equipment. They're designed to work with specific filters that maintain the perfect pressure and water flow for that ideal espresso shot. Using the wrong filter is like putting regular gas in a premium-only car – it just doesn't work right.

I spent hours researching and found that buying directly through authorized sellers is the way to go. The filters might cost a bit more, but they're worth every penny when you consider the investment you've made in your machine. Plus, genuine filters typically last longer and perform better than generic ones.

After trying various options, I found a reliable source where I get all my Breville accessories now. They have the whole range of filters, from the basic water filters to the more specialized ones for different models. You can check them out here: https://athometouch.com/breville

Some quick tips I've learned about Breville filters:
- Replace them every 2-3 months for optimal performance
- Always rinse new filters before first use
- Store spare filters in a cool, dry place
- Watch out for suspicious deals that seem too good to be true

The best part about getting the right filter is the difference you'll taste in your coffee. No more metallic aftertaste, no more inconsistent shots, just pure, barista-quality espresso every single time.

I also recommend keeping track of when you install new filters. I use my phone's calendar to set reminders, so I never forget to change them. It's a small habit that makes a huge difference in maintaining your machine's performance.

Hope this helps fellow coffee lovers maintain their machines properly! Let me know if you have any questions about filters or Breville machines in general.

How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb,"Y’all I’ve been in constipation hell for a month now. I'm about to get nitty gritty with my story, so you've been warned if you don’t want to read.

For context, I am a 28-year-old “overweight” man. I started ozempic after plateauing on my weight loss journey of 1.5 years for two months. I flattened out at a weight that isn’t bad for me but one I’ve never been able to get under. I exercise a good bit. I go for walks, do the elliptical, and lift weights. My exercise plan is based on the NFL’s “Play 60” ad campaign. I get moving for an hour a day. Since grocery prices increased, I eat lots of vegetables and cook almost everything from scratch using Whole Foods. My love of cooking got me overweight, and it has helped me lose weight, too. I drink tons of water, take Miralax daily, and track my fiber intake. 

This all started after I went to my Alma Mater’s homecoming game with a bunch of old friends. I was on .25 and delayed my dose so I could have fun. Sunday after many beers and lots of bad food I put my throne to great use. So I took my next .25 that night.

Then everything began to slow down much more than usual. Before that week I’d be a lil constipated on the first few days of the dose but pretty regular by shot day. During this week and the next I wasn’t going every day and what was coming out did not match what was going in. I talked with my doctor and we decided to hold off on going up to .5. After two weeks of this I completely stopped being able to go.

I started gaining weight. I weigh myself daily—sometimes twice a day—and have been doing this for over a year. I became concerned because I was putting on more weight than I’d expect to gain as water weight. I track my calories and was in a deficit this entire time. My appetite decreased significantly and my stomach became extremely puffy. I began using fleet glycerin enemas every few days to clear things out hoping that I would have a BM later. That situation persisted for almost two weeks. At this point I decided not to take my next shot.

So it’s mid this week. I’m looking at myself in the mirror and every bit of my loose skin from 70 lbs of weight loss is stretched out. I’m bloated and I feel like shit. And I cave. I bought an enema kit. Found a subreddit where gaybros share lots of experience using enemas and just went for it. I gave myself the charge order “enema until clear.” Which is up to three 2-liter enemas or until clear. I never got clear, but fuck did I feel better after 3 big enemas.

Yesterday, I got Thai food and the spice sent my stomach into knots. Thai food has never done that to me. This morning my coffee did the same and I went. Seriously what a freaking relief. I haven’t started up my meds again and am going to talk with my doc first. For now I’m gunna just enjoy being regular. I was a very regular person before this medicine. I am also pretty certain I’m going to see if I can switch to monjouro.

When I eat, I can't easily swallow. It progressively got worse over time. I now regurgitate food before it reaches my stomach (thrice per week or so)

The original source of the deterioration was stress and anxiety which caused gerd. I don't have as much gerd anymore. 

I struggle to swallow food while upright and if I lie down food goes in the reverse direction. I'm able to vomit food much more easily than swallow it. I wish I could flip my esophagus around!

When I'm in a noisy environment or with people (even slight noises like my dog's feet tapping on the ground), I'm unable to swallow. Being in a dimly lit, quiet space where I'm alone, can help, but I drink almost 1L of water per meal to help it go down. Water has slowly been less effective over time.

I can't seem to have access to a quiet place in most places and work isn't able to accommodate. I'm 31F and I have a hard time coming to terms with living this way.

Hey Jess, I’m a little odd, but you know that. Sometimes when I’m feeling a lot about something or someone I like to write it out so I’m kinda doing that here. Today’s Saturday which means you leave for your trip today. You just asked me to call you cause you wanted to hear my voice, I thought that was really cute. Your voice sounded sleepy and your laughs were adorable. Just makes me feel all sorts of ways about you. We talked about it already and we both fall hard and fast for people. Things like that make me fall even harder and faster. 

We matched on hinge on November 15th. We talked for a little while and then you had the gull to essentially ghost me for like a week 🙄 (I can’t believe you). Then I hit you back up and a few days later we picked up right where we left off. The chemistry and vibes between us were just immaculate (at least from my POV). There were so many times I would just be carrying out with my day and then see your name pop up on my screen and instant smile. I think I suggested we go out on a date like 2 or 3 times but you were super busy with work. Eventually we decided on a day. We kept talking and things just felt natural and eventually you asked for my number (which is hot 🥵). The chemistry followed from the hinge chat. You are just so sweet when you message me. It always feels like you want to talk to me which is refreshing as anything. 

Come the day of our date we both were saying we were excited as anything. I kept thinking about it all day. Felt like I didn’t want to be at work because I just wanted to do whatever I needed to prep for it. I got there quite a bit early and probably stressed you out a bit because it made you feel late. I’m not going to lie, I kind of like when I make you feel frazzled by doing stuff like that so don’t expect me to stop, it keeps you on your toes.  I was nervous as hell. Before you even got there I took a sip of water and nearly spilled it on myself because my hands were shaking. When you got there I was kind of spaced out and didn’t realize you walked up but I got up and gave you a big hug. I couldn’t believe we were finally meeting each other. Felt like meeting up with someone I’ve known forever but haven’t seen in a while. You looked so beautiful. Your hair, your makeup, your outfit. Everything about you was captivating. The soft lighting of the restaurant enveloped you in a way that seemed to drown out everything else in the room, casting a warm glow that illuminated your face. I was enamored! It was also the first time I heard your voice, which was like the first sip of a soothing, warm tea on a cold day. Your voice sounded so relaxed, sweet, and happy. As the night unfolded, our conversation simply refused to stop. People talk about finding a spark, I think ours was a lightning strike. Your laugh too! Your laugh, it just melted me. Fortunately, I was funny enough to hear it quite a few times. The food was good but couldn’t care less about it because I was there for you. Although,the table next to use was definitely more interested in what we were eating. The dinner was slowly but surely coming to an end, and I didn’t want it to. I desperately needed it to continue. As we left I asked if you wanted to stop at the bar next door, that way we could continue things. Instead you suggested your place was right around the corner. A surprise for sure, but a welcome one. We return to your place, and you’re frantically checking things, getting things in their places, and changing into something more comfortable. Eventually, we both sit on the couch, just talking again. I feel the moment is right and wrap my arm around you, pulling you closer. Your warm response makes my heart flutter and feel at peace simultaneously. It’s been the longest time since I’ve felt this way about someone. We keep talking and sharing stories and I’m just realizing how fond I’ve grown for you. I eventually ask if I could kiss you, in all honestly my question probably felt forced and a bit out of nowhere but completely expected at the same time. You respond yes. We kiss. Earth shattering explosion for me. I can taste your lips, feel your skin, smell your perfume. The sensation lingers for a moment before we kiss again. I get the feel from you that this is exactly what you wanted as well. There’s a romantic innocence with our intentions. The night continues as we does the conversation, me holding you close, and the occasional kiss. Next thing I know it’s super late! It’s cold outside. Maybe because it’s December I think of the song Baby It’s Cold Outside. I decide to ask if maybe I could stay. Your enthusiasm is refreshing and it seemed like that’s exactly what you wanted me to say while also thinking that this is a little crazy. You’re very accommodating, even giving me a toothbrush to use. I find it all very endearing. We spent the night in your bed, engrossed in deep, soulful conversations about our individual identities and our aspirations for the future. A lot of what we shared resonated deeply with each other, and we both found immense joy in each other’s company. I primarily wanted to stay because I simply wanted to hold you close. We texted over the past few days, expressing how we like to just be cozy with the winter weather outside. I desired to be enveloped in that warmth with you. Everything about the night, the moment, and my feelings for you has been nothing short of perfect. I simply wanted to cuddle up with you and let my heart overflow. Unfortunately, we didn’t get much sleep due to our deep conversations. We only managed about 3 hours. In the morning, we hit the snooze button on the alarm, simply wanting to linger in bed, face to face, holding each other close for a little while longer. In those moments, nothing else in the world seemed to matter to either of us. We eventually did have to start our day and you started it by making us both a cup of coffee. While you were standing there in the kitchen I just gazed upon you noticing all the subtleties of your beauty. You eventually noticed me staring and came over and gave me a kiss. We continued our talk from the night before over our cups of coffee until we finished and I said I should probably go. Instead of letting me walk the block and a half back to my place you insisted on driving me. I was hesitant at first because of how welcoming you were to me the entire time, I didn’t want to ask more of you. We eventually made the way to your car and honestly, I’m glad I decided to give in because it let me spend a couple more minutes with you. You dropped me off, we shared a goodbye kiss, and I practically skipped my way into my building. I got home and just fell back face up into my bed feeling all the butterflies. You’ve got me hooked. 

Fast forward to today. You’re on your way to the airport right now. Am I crazy to think or say that I’ll miss you. There’s a fiery passion between us, and I know it’ll lead to something good. I want—no, need—that to happen. I’ve fallen completely for you Jess. ",1,1733589252.0,UnsentLetters,2,0.67,False

I started working in the toddler room in August and it was chaos. The kids had no boundaries, were getting too old for the room, and all they did was freeplay all day. There had not been a good lead in about 6 months and the assistant didn’t really seem to have a good handle on how to control the kids. Come September we get a completely new class of 12 toddlers. I had been working hard to teach the assistant the rules I wanted implemented and how I wanted them taught to the students. We had got in a few fights over this and she has even thrown a students stuffie in frustration when I corrected her once. After months of working together and trying to get to know each other we finally started to bond and she finally started to follow my lead. It wasn’t perfect but I finally wasn’t doing everything myself. In November they fully enrolled our class so we now have 14 toddlers. Things got crazier and we now have two biters who are on behavior plans. I noticed my coteacher started struggling coming in late, getting back from lunch late, and overall just being quiet and keeping to herself at work. I had previously met with the office ONCE and ONLY once to discuss my relationship with her and I actually made them put two subs in our room and send us on a coffee date because I did want to get to know her and I did want us to run a well behaved fun classroom. One day they randomly called her into the office and fired her. I have no idea what happened or why she was fired. I love my admin so much and the owner is fine. All I got from my director is that my coteacher and the owner ended up getting in a fight and she couldn’t calm them down. When my coteacher came to get her things she tried to tell me what happened and the owner physically pulled me out of the room by my arm and told her that “she wouldn’t be telling me anything and she can get her things and go”. I’ve been struggling to stay present the past two days at work because all I can think about it my partner in the classroom and what happened to her. I can’t lie part of my was relieved because she wasn’t very helpful and was taking so long to learn but I overall feel guilty. When she left I was sitting in the office and we made silent eye contact as she left. Would it be a bad idea to reach out to her? Would you want your coteacher to reach out to you or would it just make you more upset? I’m not even sure what to say):

Living in Reno’s downtown, we encounter unhoused neighbors often, and as winter approaches the conditions for them get brutal.

According to the Washoe County Coroner’s Office, nine people died of hypothermia in 2023. Environmental exposure continues to be one of the main challenges for the unhoused, but many of their ordeals go unnoticed.

With us, we brought some gift cards for pizza and hand warmers to share with people, regardless of if they wanted to be interviewed. With many unhoused camping along the Truckee, we started down the Riverwalk path, where we would find our first interviewee Joe.

Wrapped in a large coat and beanie, Joe stood on the corner with a cane and had asked us for change. We gave him what we had, and asked if he wanted to be interviewed and emphasized there was no pressure. He agreed, though in a soft voice.

Joe told us he’s had a very rough month. He said he’s been waiting for his trust fund to come through, and in the meanwhile has found out his “wife and kids are fake”. He also said he was an army veteran. Though the cold was bothering him, he said his biggest need at the moment was more cash. He seemed reluctant to go into greater details, so we didn’t press him on his statements. We thanked Joe for sharing, and for his service, and carried on.

Next, we met a woman sitting on the grass wrapped in blankets in the middle of Wingfield Park. Looking clearly distraught, Niki asked if she was okay.

The woman shared that she’s not usually on the streets, but was a victim of domestic violence and had run away from her husband. She broke down in tears and asked us for something warm.

We gave her the hand warmers, but she asked if we could get her something else like coffee or tea. We went to a nearby café and brought her a coffee. In our absence, a Reno downtown ambassador had walked over to her, and was walking away by the time we arrived. She shared with us the ambassador told her that she can get temporary housing by calling a hotline, and had given her the number.

We then walked to the Believe sign in the heart of downtown Reno. There, we found another woman who was also bundled in blankets. We asked if she’d like to share her story. At first she said yes and started to speak normally. She then began talking about a number of random topics, saying she was speaking to angels and warning us of demons. It was clear she was not in a state to be interviewed, so we gave her what we still had to give out, thanked her, and moved on.

At the Believe plaza, we had hoped to encounter the larger group that typically congregates there. However, it was barren.

After having a few more people on the river tell us they didn’t want to be recorded or interviewed, we called it a day. This type of reporting is very heavy, and you only want to interview people who are in the right mindset, condition, can give you meaningful, sober consent, and of course are willing to share their story.

Everyone’s story is important, and those of unhoused neighbors often go unheard, creating a missing link for a community which needs dire help.

In that time, I went from good Mormon girl that read the BoM, went to YW and went to seminary to graduating high school and getting tattoos and piercings, drinking coffee, smoking weed, and coming out as pansexual. 

I’ve never felt like I truly belong or even believe in the church. Ever since I was a kid in primary, I didn’t feel close to Heavenly Father or the Spirit. I realized I was attracted to other girls and I knew I had to keep it to myself and I did for such a long time. I was assaulted twice by men in the YM (once when I was 16 then again at 17) and when I went to the bishop about it, he blamed me for putting myself in that situation. I tried telling him that I didn’t want it, and he said that it doesn’t matter if I didn’t want it because I willingly put my spirit at risk by being around a young man. I told my mother about it, but my aunt still doesn’t know. My shelf broke when I was 20 around when the pandemic happened. I stopped praying because I realized no loving and benevolent Heavenly Father would allow thousands to die and millions more to suffer from a sickness, and I’ve been distancing myself from the church ever since.

My mom and aunt are still very active meme bees of the church and while my mom respects my decision and still loves me unconditionally, my aunt can’t seem to understand I don’t believe anymore.  She knows I’m pansexual and that I have tattoos and piercings and smoke weed and have premarital sex, and she hates me for it. I’m getting ready to move in with my boyfriend, but I just want her to leave me alone in the meantime. 

She recently said “you grew up in the church, you know better than do all this shit, you look disgusting” when she saw my new tattoos. I had to hold back saying “You know what else is disgusting? Your bishop telling me it was my fault I was raped.” 

I still want to respect her and treat her with kindness. She allowed my mother and I to live with her while my mom was getting cancer treatments and has continued to let us live with her after my parents got a divorce, but she treats me like garbage. I had to stay to take care of my mother and because I was in a financially and emotionally abusive relationship for about 4 years and couldn’t move out or leave until the relationship ended. I’m now with my currently boyfriend and we’re getting ready to move in together and this will be the first time I’ve lived out on my own. 

I want to sit down with my aunt and explain to her in full detail why I left the church and my current feelings towards to the church. I can’t do it until I’m 100% out of the house because I don’t want her to kick me out. I want to tell her about how I’ve never felt Heavenly Father or the Spirit, how every leader I’ve had in the church has talked down to me because of my autism/ADHD, how the men in YM assaulted me, how my bishop blamed me for it happening, and why I don’t believe in a god that would allow his planet to suffer and die from a pandemic.

My wife is from Berlin but hasn’t been home in many years (we have previously lived in the UK and now the US where I’m from).

I know she misses home a lot, I didn’t know if anyone can give me ideas as to some things/ brands she might miss? 

She doesn’t really drink alcohol as we have kids who take all our time and she really only drinks instant coffee at home so coffee roasters are out the window too unfortunately.

I was hoping to buy directly from a store in Berlin who might ship to the US as I feel like that is more meaningful, so any links to stores would be appreciated.

I have a few ideas, maybe a cookie cutter with the amplemann (although it seems to be sold out everywhere) a scarf with something from
Berlin (maybe Berlin near?), maybe there is some food item that Germans really enjoy that she can’t get here?

I am willing to pay for the shipping and I understand it wouldn’t get here for Christmas, that’s not a massive issue. I’ve had this idea in my head for a while but I waited to long to execute it unfortunately, as I have cancer and haven’t been feeling well.

Anyway, any advice would be very much appreciated.",3,1733588809.0,berlin,30,0.72,False

One such product that continues to capture the attention of customers across different age groups is the slushie. With its refreshing texture and vibrant flavors, slushies can be the perfect addition to your menu. Whether you run a café, a convenience store, or a mobile food truck, investing in a **commercial slush puppie machine** can drastically improve your offerings and enhance your business's profitability.

But how do you know which commercial slush machine is right for your business? In this blog, we'll explore the features, benefits, and practical considerations of adding a slush puppie machine to your operations. From the financial gains to the operational benefits, you’ll discover why this investment is more than worth it.

**Why Choose a Commercial Slush Puppie Machine?**

Slushies are loved by people of all ages. From kids craving something sweet and icy to adults enjoying a nostalgic treat, a **commercial slush puppie machine** offers a versatile solution to appeal to a broad customer base. The demand for refreshing beverages is always high, especially during the hot months, and a slushie machine allows you to meet that demand efficiently.

Moreover, slushies are affordable to produce and have impressive profit margins, making them a highly lucrative product. While many businesses sell pre-packaged drinks or rely on other beverage options like sodas or iced coffee, slushies stand out because they offer something that customers can’t easily replicate at home.

By incorporating a slush machine into your business, you can increase foot traffic, provide a fun and exciting product for your customers, and boost your revenue with minimal additional overhead.

**The Benefits of Adding a Slush Puppie Machine to Your Business**

A **commercial slush puppie machine** brings several notable benefits to any establishment. Below are some of the most significant advantages that come with investing in a high-quality slush machine.

**1. High Profit Margins**

One of the most appealing aspects of offering slushies in your business is the profit margin. Slushies require relatively inexpensive ingredients—primarily water, sugar, and flavoring. The equipment needed to make slushies is an initial investment, but the actual costs of running the machine are low. As a result, slushies offer one of the highest profit margins of any beverage on the market.

**2. Year-Round Appeal**

While slushies are often associated with summer and hot weather, they are a treat that can be enjoyed year-round. Whether it’s a warm day or a chilly winter evening, people crave sweet, icy refreshments at any time of the year. A **commercial slush puppie machine** can allow you to offer seasonal flavors and cater to different customer tastes, ensuring there’s always a reason to enjoy slushies no matter the season.

**3. Easy to Operate**

A high-quality commercial slush machine is designed to be user-friendly, allowing even staff with limited experience to operate it without difficulty. These machines typically have straightforward controls and often include features that make the process of making and serving slushies simple and quick.

For busy establishments, such as cafes or food trucks, this ease of operation helps minimize wait times for customers and ensures a smooth and efficient workflow.

**4. Customer Satisfaction and Increased Foot Traffic**

A **commercial slush puppie machine** can create a visually appealing product that attracts people to your business. The colorful slushies are often displayed in clear, see-through tanks, creating a tempting and eye-catching sight that draws customers in. Additionally, slushies are fun! People love the idea of customizing their flavors or choosing from a variety of vibrant options, making it a highly satisfying product for anyone who enjoys sweet, icy drinks.

When customers are satisfied, they are more likely to return and recommend your business to others, which can help you increase foot traffic and customer loyalty.

**What to Look for in a Commercial Slush Puppie Machine**

When selecting a **commercial slush puppie machine**, there are several features and specifications to keep in mind to ensure you get the best machine for your needs. Below are key factors to consider before making your purchase.

**1. Capacity and Volume**

The capacity of your slush machine will depend on the size of your establishment and the number of customers you expect to serve daily. Machines come in various sizes, with different tank capacities. For high-volume businesses, such as amusement parks or large cafes, a machine with a large tank capacity or multiple tanks may be necessary.

* **Single Tank Machines:** These machines are typically smaller and are ideal for smaller establishments that don't have the demand for multiple slushie flavors. A single tank machine is also often easier to maintain and clean.
* **Dual-Tank Machines:** If you want to offer multiple flavors of slushies at the same time, a dual-tank machine is the way to go. These machines allow you to serve different flavor options simultaneously, increasing your ability to meet customer preferences and increasing sales.

**2. Quality of Freezing and Consistency**

One of the most important features of a **commercial slush puppie machine** is its freezing mechanism. You need a machine that can consistently churn and freeze the slush mixture, creating a smooth, slushy texture that customers will love.

Some machines feature continuous freezing cycles, which ensure that the slush mix remains at the perfect consistency without any ice chunks or melting. On the other hand, cyclical freezing models may be less consistent, causing some slushies to be too watery or too icy, depending on the cycle.

Look for machines that allow you to adjust the freezing settings to achieve the right texture for different flavors or to meet customer preferences.

**3. Ease of Cleaning and Maintenance**

A **commercial slush puppie machine** that’s easy to clean will save you time and ensure a sanitary environment. Slush machines can accumulate sugar and ice residue, and cleaning them thoroughly is essential for both the machine’s longevity and the quality of the slushies you serve.

Many machines feature removable parts, such as the tanks, drip trays, and nozzles, which can be washed separately. Additionally, some advanced machines have self-cleaning features that help reduce the amount of manual cleaning required.

Regular maintenance and cleaning will not only extend the life of your machine but also ensure the slushies you serve are consistently fresh and hygienic.

**4. Durability and Build Quality**

The durability of a **commercial slush puppie machine** is critical, especially in a high-traffic environment. Choose a machine made from high-quality materials, such as stainless steel, to ensure it’s able to withstand the wear and tear of regular use. A durable machine will also be less prone to breakdowns and will require fewer repairs.

A solid warranty and customer support are also crucial when choosing a slush machine. Make sure that the manufacturer offers a comprehensive warranty and is responsive to maintenance or repair issues.

**5. User-Friendly Controls and Settings**

For businesses that rely on a fast-paced environment, a **commercial slush puppie machine** with easy-to-use controls is essential. Machines should have an intuitive interface, whether it’s a simple set of buttons or a touchscreen display, making it easy for staff to operate the machine quickly.

Additional features like portion control can be beneficial, as they help regulate how much slush is dispensed with each serving, ensuring consistency in your product while reducing waste.

**6. Energy Efficiency**

Energy efficiency is another important factor to consider when selecting a slush machine. The machine will likely be running throughout the day, and the more energy-efficient it is, the more you’ll save on electricity bills.

Look for machines that are energy-star rated or have features that reduce energy consumption when the machine is not in use. Some machines have an “eco-mode” that automatically lowers energy use during periods of inactivity.

**7. Customer Support and Warranty**

Before making your purchase, ensure that the manufacturer or distributor provides excellent customer support and a solid warranty. In case of issues, having access to responsive customer service can prevent costly downtime. Additionally, a comprehensive warranty will protect you in case of malfunctions or defects.

**Conclusion: Maximizing Business Potential with a Slush Puppie Machine**

Incorporating a **commercial slush puppie machine** into your business can be a strategic move that not only enhances your product offerings but also boosts your bottom line. With the ability to serve high-demand, refreshing beverages that are easy to make and incredibly profitable, a slush machine can be a valuable addition to your operation.

By considering factors such as capacity, freezing quality, ease of cleaning, and energy efficiency, you can make an informed decision that ensures your business will thrive with this fun and lucrative product. Slushies are a treat that’s always in demand, and with the right equipment, you can serve them in the most efficient and appealing way possible.

Enhancing your business with the perfect **commercial slush puppie machine** will ultimately lead to happier customers, increased sales, and greater operational efficiency. So, take the plunge and add this versatile machine to your lineup—it’s a decision you won’t regret!",1,1733588733.0,u_erepresent,0,1.0,False

","An Ode to Fairbanks’ Weird Charm

Oh Fairbanks, land of frosted breath and burning midnight skies,
Where the rivers sleep beneath a quilt of ice,
And houses huddle close, like secrets whispered in the snow.
You are a contradiction wrapped in Carhartts,
Where the cold burns and the dark dazzles.

In your streets, potholes yawn wider than a moose’s stride,
Yet hearts are warmer than the coffee always brewing.
The Northern Lights dance above like they’ve been paid to perform,
And we crane our necks, forgiving you your frozen moods.

Summer comes like a wild-eyed visitor,
Throwing open the door at midnight, yelling, “Let’s party!”
And we oblige, swatting mosquitoes like tiny vampires
While growing cabbages the size of toddlers.

Your people are your pulse—stubborn, scrappy, and strange,
Who wear their frostbitten scars like badges of pride.
They talk of bears and outhouses with the same reverence
Others reserve for cathedrals.

Fairbanks, you’re no postcard town;
You’re raw edges and DIY spirit,
A place where “making it work” is a philosophy,
And “warm” is any temperature above zero.

You’re weird, wonderful,
And maybe just a little unhinged.
But for those who’ve felt your midnight sun on their faces
Or your winter silence in their bones,
You are unforgettable.",11,1733588723.0,Fairbanks,21,0.67,False
