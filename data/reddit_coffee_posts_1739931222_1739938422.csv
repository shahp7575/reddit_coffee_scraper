1iswnjo,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_EstrogenCookie/comments/1iswnjo/a_diary_of_sorts_21/,A diary of sorts [21],"Hi cuties!!

So I took the kids to school today and then went to the coffee shop to work when a couple people beside me met and started talking. One of them gave a good place for getting bloodworks done and also mentioned just starting t, so that was pretty cool.

I asked the girl what the name of the place was after the other one left to catch a bus and we had a nice conversation where I kind of maybe said I was about to get estrogen and then talked a bit about like what my family thinks and stuff DJFJWJJDNDBDBDD THIS HAPPENED IRL. I'm used to it online but *in person* and I didn't even feel that bad or dysphoric!! 

A few hours later when she went to leave I asked if she wanted a cat sticker(I always slept a couple.... hundred on me) and she picked two and then asked what my name was and I SAID JEANNE. Ksdjjshdhe so I got jeanne'd irl >w< 

Also I figured out why my voice goes lower it's because whenever I'm nervous the lower I go the more reliable my voice is. 

Sooo I'm super happy and also when talking to the bi friend I made a couple weeks ago about how on the region group chat she was a 'bi girl pretending to be a straight girl pretending to be a gay girl pretending to be a straight girl' I said in relation to people thinking things are always a bit ""I could eat estrogen in front of someone and they'd be like 'crazy lmao'"" so yeaaaaa 

I also got a lot of progress with my school, so that's really great :3 

You guys, remember to hydrate, and remember to enjoy the good days when you have them <3

Goodnight!

1iswn9a,https://i.redd.it/klu8upirt0ke1.png,Mine,"Yunli closed up shop after a long, hard day of work. The scent of food lingered in the air as she wiped the counters clean, her movements meticulous. The clatter of chairs being stacked echoed through the now-quiet restaurant. After bidding farewell to her employees, she grabbed the broom and swept the floor. 

Graduating had been a milestone, but she hadn’t expected the next step to come so quickly. Her grandfather, ever enthusiastic and confident in her abilities, had eagerly handed her the family restaurant. At the time, she’d been unsure of what she wanted in life, so without another choice—she obliged.

It wasn’t what she’d imagined for herself, but it had its own joys. Seeing customers’ faces light up after tasting their food was a reward in itself, a daily reminder of why the business thrived. Still, as successful as it was, something in her life felt out of line.

Yunli sighed, leaning on the table she had just wiped down. The warm, savory scents of the day still clung to the air, though the restaurant was now eerily quiet. The sound of clattering utensils and lively conversations were gone, replaced by the hum of the air conditioner. Her phone screen glowed faintly in the dim room — no new messages.

She tapped on their last conversation, reading over Yanqing's brief responses from earlier in the week.

""Sorry, still at the seminar. Love you.""
""Thesis draft’s a nightmare, I'll make it up to you, promise.""

Promises that felt more like excuses than commitments.

Yunli bit her lip, pushing down the ache in her chest. She knew his doctorate was important — something he had dreamed of for years. She admired his dedication, truly. But that didn’t fill the growing emptiness left by his absence.

Wiping a stray crumb off the edge of the table, she tried to rationalize her feelings. 

2 weeks of nothing. He loved her. He told her so. But love wasn’t just words, was it? It was presence, shared laughter, stolen moments in between chaos. Lately, it felt like she was dating a ghost — one tethered to late-night seminars and endless cups of coffee at cafes she never got to visit with him.

Her chest tightened. She didn't want to be unfair, but how long could she keep brushing her feelings aside for his goals?

The door jingled softly as her last employee waved goodbye from the entrance. Yunli forced a smile and waved back, the emptiness settling back into her bones the moment the door clicked shut. The world outside was painted in the orange glow of streetlights, couples walking hand in hand, their laughter carried on the breeze.

Yunli exhaled heavily and grabbed her things, flipping the lights off one by one.

───※ ·❆· ※───

She opened the door to her apartment, greeted by the same hollow silence as always. Argh, the quiet made her crave Yanqing’s presence even more. Before he graduated, his schedule had been hectic, but at least he always made time for dates and moments together. Now, it felt like even that had slipped through their grasp.

Sighing, she flicked on the lights and stepped inside, the soft glow barely lifting the heaviness in her chest. She shed her clothes without much thought and headed straight for the bath.

Warm water cascaded over her skin, washing away the grime of the day but doing little to cleanse her wandering thoughts. Her fingers hovered on her lips. How long had it been since they kissed? Since they last shared an intimate moment?

Her mind spiraled through endless possibilities, each more unsettling than the last. What if... Yanqing had found someone else? The thought was absurd — wasn’t it? But her insecurities clung tightly, fueled by memories she’d rather forget.

Like the time he introduced her to one of his co-authors from a research project. The way they had clicked instantly, exchanging complex scientific jargon she couldn't begin to follow. She hated how it felt — like she was the outsider, a mother being humored by a child introducing their first crush.

Jealousy. She didn’t want to admit it, but it gnawed at her.

Yunli shook the thoughts away and focused on finishing her bath. Dwelling on it wouldn’t change anything. She dried herself off, got dressed, and sat down for a quiet dinner.

Later, as she washed the dishes, the clock caught her eye — nearly midnight. At least tomorrow was the weekend, sparing her from the early morning rush of the restaurant.

The door clicked open behind her.

She tensed, glancing briefly over her shoulder. Yanqing.

Her heart thudded against her ribs, but she turned back to the dishes, pretending not to notice. Maybe — just maybe — he’d take the initiative tonight.

The clatter of plates on the drying rack was interrupted by the warmth of his arms wrapping around her waist. His head rested against her hair, and she felt the weight of his exhaustion seep into her skin.

“Hi, Yunli...” His voice was soft, carrying a tired smile.

""Where have you been?"" she asked, keeping her tone neutral.

""I was with Ju Lee at the cafe,"" he admitted. Yunli’s stomach twisted. Ju Lee, that was her name. And she was tired of hearing it from Yanqing.  ""I asked for her help on my thesis.""

Yunli's hands froze for a moment before she forced herself to continue arranging the dishes. The warmth of Yanqing's embrace usually soothed her, but tonight, it only stoked the storm inside her chest.

She clenched her jaw, trying to will away the jealousy clawing at her thoughts. ""I see,"" she said evenly, though her voice wavered just enough for Yanqing to notice.

His arms tightened slightly around her waist as if sensing her unease. ""I’m sorry it got so late again,"" he said softly. ""I didn’t mean to—""

""Stay out until midnight?"" she cut in gently, turning off the tap and shaking her hands dry. ""I figured as much. It’s been the usual these days, hasn’t it?""

Yanqing pulled back slightly, guilt flickering in his eyes. ""I’m really trying to wrap things up with this thesis. I promise, once it's done—""

Yanqing’s phone buzzed sharply, shattering the fragile moment between them. He reluctantly pulled back, fumbling to retrieve it from his pocket.

""S-sorry, I need to take this. Important stuff,"" he stammered, already moving toward the living room, oblivious to the shadow of frustration flickering across Yunli’s face.

She dried her hands, watching him talk into the phone, his voice low and serious. That was it, wasn't it? A rare moment of intimacy cast aside for some call.

“Oh, Ju Lee. What is it?” he began. The woman replied back, she didn't know what she said but what Yanqing said struck something in her. “Oh don't worry, I'll always have time for you.” It was probably just him being nice, but right now Yunli wasn't having it 

Fine. If work was all he could think about, she'd test just how much focus he had left.

Her steps were deliberate, heels clicking softly against the floor as she paced toward him. Yanqing didn’t even notice her approach, too absorbed in the conversation. That would change soon enough.

Without a word, Yunli grabbed his necktie firmly as she pulled Yanqing toward her, pressing hot, insistent kisses along the column of his neck. The heat of her lips against his skin drew a sharp inhale from him, his breath catching despite his attempt to maintain composure.

""I’m still here,"" Yanqing said into the phone, his voice strained, though he tried to steady it. ""Yeah, go on… I’m listening.""

Yunli smirked against his neck, feeling the faint tremor in his body. His hand gripped the phone tightly, knuckles whitening as he struggled to split his focus between the call and her relentless assault on his senses.

Her lips trailed higher, brushing the sensitive skin just below his ear. ""Still working, huh?"" she whispered, her voice low and teasing. ""Even when I’m right here… kissing you… wanting you.""

Yanqing’s fingers flexed around the phone, his jaw clenching. ""N-no, I’m not distracted,"" he forced out to the person on the other end of the call, his words faltering as Yunli’s teeth grazed his neck.

She bared her teeth slightly, nipping at his skin, just hard enough to make him hiss through his teeth. His glare flicked down to her, filled with warning, but Yunli only grinned, taking it as a challenge.

""Focus on me,"" she murmured huskily, her lips brushing his earlobe. ""How can you keep talking to them when I’m kissing you like this?"" Her tongue flicked against the curve of his ear, sending a visible shudder down his spine.

Yanqing swallowed hard, his breath growing uneven. ""I—uh…"" he stammered, his voice cracking slightly, prompting concern from the person on the line.

Yunli giggled softly, the sound sultry and mischievous. ""What's wrong, Yanqing?"" she whispered, her tone dripping with seduction. ""Is talking to them really more important than me begging for your attention?""

“Come on…Yanqing~” She let out a soft, deliberate moan of his name right into his ear, her breath warm and intoxicating. His composure finally wavered, his free hand shooting to her waist, gripping it firmly in an attempt to steady himself.

""Y-Yunli…"" he muttered under his breath, his voice both a plea and a warning.

""That’s right,"" she purred, her lips brushing against his ear. ""Say my name. Forget the call.""

Yanqing's breathing was ragged now, the conversation on the phone becoming increasingly fragmented. His responses were clipped, strained, and barely coherent.

Yunli grinned triumphantly. She had his attention now, whether he wanted to admit it or not. ""Hang up,"" she whispered against his skin. ""Or I’m not stopping.""

Yanqing hesitated, his gaze locking with Yunli’s. Her eyes gleamed with the patient intensity of a predator waiting for her prey to make the next move. There was no escape, only surrender.

Reluctantly, he raised the phone back to his ear. ""It’s a bit late now, Ju Lee,"" he said, his voice tight. ""I’ll call you back in the morning.""

With a sharp beep, the call ended, and he slid the phone into his pocket. Yunli’s eyes tracked his every movement, unrelenting and expectant.

When he finally turned back to her, there was a hint of irritation in his expression. ""What do you want—?""

""You,"" she interrupted without a moment's hesitation, her voice unwavering. ""I want you. I want you to spend more time with me. Stop thinking about your research, doctorate, or anything else for a second and start thinking about me — just right now.""

Her words hung heavy in the air, raw and unapologetic. Yanqing’s brows 3 the weight of her plea cutting through his weariness. For all her usual composure, Yunli was baring her heart now, and it demanded an answer.

Yanqing's irritation flickered into something softer—guilt. He exhaled slowly, rubbing the back of his neck. ""Yunli... I know I’ve been—""

""Absent,"" she finished for him, her tone sharp but not unkind. ""Yeah, I know. I keep telling myself it's fine, that I understand what you're doing is important. But... I miss you, Yanqing.""

Her honesty struck him harder than any insult could have. He took a step closer, his expression conflicted. ""I never wanted to make you feel that way.""

“You do matter,"" he insisted, his voice earnest. ""More than anything.""

""Then show me."" Her gaze remained. ""Right here, right now.""

Yanqing didn't respond. His gaze flickered away, unable to meet Yunli’s. But her eyes—soft yet intense—never wavered, pleading silently for him to say something, to do something.

She looked so damn cute, painfully so. The soft glow of the kitchen lights cast shadows along her collarbone, the damp strands of her hair clinging to her flushed skin. Her lips, parted slightly, trembled just enough to betray how much this moment meant to her. How much it meant to him.

He opened his mouth—say something, idiot—but before he could, Yunli yanked hard on his tie.

He was pulled down with enough force to catch him off guard, breath hitching as their lips collided. The kiss wasn’t gentle. It wasn’t patient or careful. It was a collision, a tangle of teeth and tongues, of frustration and loneliness and everything unspoken that had festered between them for weeks. Her hands fisted into his shirt, pulling him even closer, and Yanqing groaned into her mouth, a sound deep and raw, like something inside him was breaking.

The hand on her thigh was gripping, squeezing, desperate to feel more. Yunli gasped, but it only spurred him on. He kissed her harder, messier, tasting the faint traces of wine on her lips, inhaling the soft, lingering scent of her shampoo. His fingers slipped beneath the hem of her shirt, pressing against the warm skin of her lower back. She shivered, arching into him, her body pressing so tightly against his he could feel the rapid beat of her heart against his chest.

She was everywhere, all at once, and he was drowning in her.

Yunli slowly led Yanqing backwards, inching slowly to the couch. Then, when they were near, she pushed him down, forcing him to sit.

Yunli didn’t give Yanqing a chance to regain control. The moment he stumbled onto the couch, she climbed onto his lap, straddling him with practiced ease. His hands instinctively found her waist, fingers pressing against the fabric of her shirt as if trying to ground himself. But she wasn’t about to let him stay composed.

Her fingers toyed with his tie, tugging it loose with deliberate slowness, her lips brushing against his jawline. “You always have time for her,” she murmured, her voice laced with teasing possession. “So tell me, Yanqing—do you have time for me now?”

Yanqing exhaled sharply, his grip tightening against her hips. “Yunli—”

She cut him off with a playful nip at his earlobe, giggling softly at his sharp inhale. “No excuses this time,” she whispered, her breath warm against his skin. “Just you and me.”

She trailed kisses down the column of his throat, lingering at the sensitive spots she knew drove him crazy. Her lips, soft yet insistent, pressed against his pulse, feeling it quicken beneath her touch. Every kiss was a reminder—a reminder that she was here, and she wasn’t about to be overlooked any longer.

Yanqing’s fingers twitched against her thighs, his breath uneven as he struggled between the urge to focus and the pull of her warmth. “You’re impossible,” he muttered, though his voice lacked any real frustration.

Yunli grinned against his neck, tilting her head to meet his gaze. “You love it,” she teased, pecking the corner of his lips before pulling back just enough to watch him squirm. “Don’t you?”

His jaw clenched, but his silence spoke volumes.

Yunli giggled again, a sweet yet wicked sound, and cradled his face between her hands. She brushed her nose against his, her breath mingling with his as she whispered, “Say it.”

Yanqing swallowed hard, his resolve thinning by the second. “I love it,” he admitted, his voice barely above a breath.

Satisfied, Yunli peppered his cheeks with light, fluttering kisses before trailing them back to his lips. The moment she kissed him again, Yanqing snapped. His hands slid up her back, pulling her flush against him as he deepened the kiss.

“Mine,” she whispered, nipping his lower lip before pressing another lingering kiss against it. “Only mine.”

Yanqing didn’t argue. He simply held her tighter, his hands roaming over the curves of her body as if trying to make up for every second he had neglected her.

───※ ·❆· ※───

Damn, was he really this negligent with her?

Yanqing felt the answer before he could even try to justify himself. The way she kissed him, the way she clung to him, the way her voice wavered ever so slightly between teasing and longing—it was all so painfully clear.

He had pushed her to this, hadn't he?

He’d been drowning in his thesis, in the weight of his ambitions, so much so that he hadn’t realized he was leaving Yunli behind. Every late night, every broken promise, every conversation cut short—he had convinced himself she understood, that she could wait.

But why should she have to?

His grip tightened around her waist as his lips moved feverishly against hers, trying to tell her—through every kiss, every touch—what words couldn’t quite capture.

She wasn’t just a fleeting thought he could return to when it was convenient. She was here, in his arms, real and warm and aching for something more.

And she deserved better.

They had met in their second year of university.

At first, she was just a familiar face in a sea of students, someone he exchanged casual nods with during lectures. Then, somehow, they started hanging out. It began with study groups and library sessions that stretched too late, turning into coffee runs and late-night takeout. She made even the most mundane parts of university feel different—lighter, easier.

Yanqing didn’t know when it happened. Maybe it was the way she listened so intently when he talked about his father’s declining health, her presence unwavering even when he struggled to find the right words. Maybe it was the way she always knew what he needed before he did, slipping an extra snack onto his tray at the cafeteria or reminding him to take breaks when he got too absorbed in his work.

He liked her before he even realized it.

But Yunli had always been braver.

""I like you,"" she had said one evening, her voice steady, her eyes locked onto his as if daring him to reject her.

And he, caught between shock and something dangerously close to relief, had only been able to nod, to swallow down the emotions that had been clawing at him for months and finally—finally—pull her into his arms.

They had been inseparable after that.

But then he decided to pursue a doctorate.

He had to. His father wasn’t going to be around forever. Yanqing would be the only one left, and if he didn’t set himself up now, when would he?

Yunli had supported him, had kissed him and told him she was proud. He had believed that was enough. That she would always be there, waiting, because she understood.

But as the weeks blurred into months, the late nights turned into a habit. The ""I’ll make it up to you"" texts piled up. And somewhere along the way, Yunli stopped asking for his time.

Now, seeing her like this—clinging to him as if trying to remind herself she still had a place in his life—was like a punch to the gut.

I’m sorry.
For missing dinner dates.
For making you feel like second place.
For all the times I said, just a little longer and then never showed up.
I’m sorry. For everything. For—

Her warmth pressed against him, her breath uneven as she pulled back just enough to rest her forehead against his.

""You’re thinking too much,"" she murmured, her tone both teasing and accusing.

Yanqing huffed a breath, forcing a smirk to his lips. ""Can you blame me? My girlfriend just ambushed me on the couch.""

Yunli giggled, nipping at his jaw. ""You love it.""

He did.

But more than that, he loved her. And he hated that she had to push him to remember that.

Before he could say anything else, his phone buzzed in his pocket.

───※ ·❆· ※───

She barely had to think.

Reaching into his pocket, she grabbed his phone and glanced at the screen.

Ju Lee.

Her stomach twisted, but her hand moved quick as she dismissed the call and muted his phone.

Yanqing opened his mouth, probably to protest, but Yunli shot him a sharp look. ""If you say anything, I’ll bite.""

His mouth shut.

She smirked. “Good boy.”

Yanqing exhaled a sharp breath, but there was no real fight in him now.

Not when she leaned in again, claiming his lips with a slow, teasing kiss. Not when her hands wandered, tracing the shape of his shoulders, reminding him of everything he had been neglecting.

""You can’t ignore me forever,"" she whispered between kisses, her fingers toying with the collar of his shirt.

Yanqing groaned softly, his hands sliding up her back. ""I know.""

Her lips curved against his. ""Good""

Yanqing pulled back just enough to look at her, his gaze dark, conflicted—but undeniably hers.

There was no research, no thesis, no unanswered calls in this moment. There was only Yunli.

As Yunli looked back, a possessive thrill came over her—this was her Yanqing. Not his research partner’s. Not his thesis committee’s. Hers.

Meet Luminance—the startup making ""Judge AI"" a reality with $75 million. Yes, you read that right. AI is not only replacing our jobs but also playing judge with our contracts.

**What's the Deal with AI Judges?**

Let me explain. Luminance, a UK-based AI guru, specializes in the legal industry. They've just gathered a cool $75 million to boost their ""Panel of Judges,"" a nifty AI platform that automates and analyzes legal contracts. Picture this: your AI lawyer who not only drafts agreements but squabbles over fine print, leaving human attorneys to sip coffee while pretending to ""oversee.""

**Why Should You Care?**

Here's where it gets juicy. Over 700 organizations in 70 countries—think giants like AMD and LG Chem—are already cozy with Luminance's tech. This isn't some tech utopia fantasy; it's the new normal. Their recent innovation, Lumi Go, even negotiates contracts autonomously. While humans bicker at the water cooler, Lumi's out there slashing legal fees like the hottest Black Friday deal.

**The Bigger Impact**

Luminance's tech expansion isn’t just making waves in the legal pond; it's a full-blown tsunami aiming for procurement and compliance. So, the next time you're lamenting how AI stole your startup, remember that it's also reforming how businesses handle mind-numbing documentation.

**Your Turn to Weigh In**

We're in a brave new world where AI could be the next hotshot in courtrooms and boardrooms. 🍿 How do you see the future of AI in the legal field?

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

We both went to a party last weekend, however, and she was very, very more-than-normally touchy feely with me. And I think we even flirted a little? I had some to drink (she had some too) so my memory isn’t perfect. Anyway, I think there’s a good chance she’d say yes if I asked her out.

What I am not feeling so confident about, however, is what to do for a first date. My idea was to ask her to go see a movie with me and get something to eat before or after. It’s the new Gundam movie. I’ve never seen anything in the franchise before, but I think it looks really cool! Should also add I’m a big fan of anime in general.

She, however, is not as big of a fan. She loves movies, but I don’t think she watching much animation, let alone anime. She will, though, watch anime with me and her roommates whenever I hang out at their place and she always has a good time (she always chooses to, we never force her lol). I guess what I’m trying to say is she’s okay with it but it isn’t something she’d do on her own.

I was thinking it would be a good idea since I like anime, she loves movies, and it’s only an hour and 20 minutes long, so we could get food after. I was also thinking it would be a good idea bc this is something I genuinely want to do for fun and want to have someone join me. But I don’t want to seem like I’m selfish or oblivious either. I guess if I could always ask what she thinks. I’ve written the whole post out at this point however so I’m still asking it.

From an outsider perspective, is this a good idea? Or should I stick to something safe like just going to get coffee/food?",1,1739937557.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

It was decided by a combination of votes from coffee experts (70%) and the general public (30%) on the basis of Quality of Coffee, Barista Expertise, Customer Service, Innovation, Ambience and Atmosphere, Sustainability Practices, Food & Pastry Quality, and Consistency.  The experts included some famous folks, like world barista finalists Jack Simpson & Morgan Eckroth, but also home brewers like Tanty Hartono (from Indonesia).  Did any of you contribute to the public vote? I didn’t.  You can easily find the list on social media (@theworlds100bestcoffeeshops) or via Google.

I’m curious to hear discussion of the list from the /r/pourover community, particularly highlighting which cafes on the list produce truly wonderful and distinctive coffee (and which cafes that aren’t on the list that consistently produce such coffee).  Any such list is bound to miss great coffee shops as well as favour shops that are well-connected in the industry (such is also a feature of the “World’s Best 100 Restaurants”).   It is thus easy to be critical about some of the shops included in the list, so I won’t do that myself.  Instead, I will comment on some of the shops on the list that I have really enjoyed and some I’d like to go to.  

The highest ranked coffee shop on the list I have been to is Coffee Anthology, in Brisbane, Australia (#8).  I was pretty impressed with this shop.  If I recall correctly, when I was there, they had 7 different espresso options, from roasters in three continents (e.g. Cavalier from Australia, Homeground from Singapore, and Sey from the USA).  The space is beautiful and bustling, with delicious food from an open kitchen bakery.  

I was also pretty impressed with the Push x Pull shop in Portland, USA (#34).  The thing that impressed me the most is that when I was there they had a Gesha as their regularly priced batch brew option several days in a row, so that made it hard for me to want to pay more for a pourover.  Cute shop and lovely staff, but much less fancy ambience than Coffee Anthology.  

The very best pourover menu I have seen in the world was at #56, Ome by Spacebar, in Georgetown, Malaysia.  They had the gear and skills to back it up, too, with multiple end-game single-dose grinders (e.g. Weber EG1, Kafatek Monolith).  I still remember the stunning El Triangulo Gesha they brewed for me on pourover (roasted by Apollon’s Gold).  Here’s my reddit review of that cafe (and some others in Penang) - https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1cy5207/the_cafe_with_the_best_pourover_menu_i_have_ever/

Finally, the shops on the list I most want to get to one day are: Tim Wendleboe in Norway (#5), Calere in Australia (#28), and Workshop in the UK (#32).  I was also impressed that coffee shops in a number of coffee growing countries were represented in the list, and I would love to go to those.

1isw87u,https://www.reddit.com/r/LettersAnswered/comments/1isw87u/legacy_gripe_and_moderate_ideas/,Legacy gripe and moderate ideas," As a master. If you revisit the difficulties and the trials of your life upon your apprentices and subordinates for any reason. To toughen them. To show them how hard it can be. To illustrate some kind of a point basically. I have only one question for you. What exactly was the point of you? Your life, your work or your deeds? Doesn't seem there was a need for your existence. Just a place holder. What kind of a legacy is that exactly? They don't exactly need you to show them how much it can suck. People Hardin naturally or can't sometimes. If you want them come up with something newer and better, they are going to need to be free of the same problems you faced so they have the time and energy. Assuming of course the reason you yourself did not come up with something newer and better was because your time and energy were occupied by said problems and trials. Just a gripe I had with some previous supervisors. I'm pondering on it tonight. If I ever see Gil again and lets face it I probably will , I would very much like him to have prepared thoughts on this, as I believe it is a major contention between us.  I see it being done to others. Its funny when it is not me but I still don't approve dude. 

I was never trying to hurt anyone's feelings. So grand plan, kept the possibilities open. Mastermind. It is what it is. I wanted him on that seat. I wanted his old friends attention. I need them both. Always did. They can think its impossible right now. Truth is, because its big they probably aren't enough. Their leadership, their roles, their influence, their networks are.  Both sides of the fence, which is required because between these big two you got both your cowboys and your carpetbaggers and that is the demographics that will give the most kickback. Convince them, I will convince them all, Dominos.  Thats the hardest part. So I need them to gain because its them doing the hardest part. Food and water are relatively simple system changes, whereas infrastructure will need to be built for shelter. They would have a major expansion under me. A rent guaranteed one (in one form or another). City centers. I have thought of this and I am not writing it all down like a clown.  Food and water should be first though. I think big. I have a feeling he respects that. To answer a question somebody keeps trying to harp on out there. Food and water must remain decentralized in nature that is the nature of perishable goods. How ever the money does not. Think decentralized with a head, or a command center I don't care. I like the military industrial complex for almost everything. Can't help it. It is a beautiful beast. Its how I think when it comes to logistics.  Which probably looks authoritarian. Except if you know me, you would know I am the farthest thing from it. I just appreciate a thing that works. Farms will need to adjust their latitudes. That is happening now. If ever so slightly. With coffee and wine first feeling it. Being able to route water for drought is already necessary and many countries have mastered the art of irrigation from very far away. People worry but the problem is just logistics with most of it. It is surplus over here so move it over there. Some places got more water than they need and others have not enough water at all. Its ridiculous that its not already a solved problem. That is where dictators find their footing of course. The quick fix. Not that their isn't a need. I only worry it would be so hard not to give in and overreact to the weapons of peace. Which I hate , so very, very much.  I blame France for the current state of the weapons of peace of course. That is my beef with their culture. However, I acknowledge, spitefully but respectfully, that it is a better way. Kinda like Britain over the centuries. France beat her til she was a passive aggressive bitch. A true master of the art. 

 O is a lucky break, with serendipity dropped in. Everything he has influenced since has been in sync with exactly the pieces I need. I think in regard to his wife he should reverse their dynamic and push her into that seat. I think she could do it.  Probably should.

 I despise that word democracy. I would ask everyone who still says it like it means something to take the following into consideration.

Democracy is a form of government and not a political party or government type.

Democracy would put all of our representatives immediately out of job because there would be no need for representation. This would be a pain in the ass nobody wants. Can you imagine voting on every little thing from town, to county, to state, to federal. When would you work? How much would you need to learn and what would be the bare minimum you need to know?

Democracy requires free formal education to that minimum level

The enemy from within is only a problem in a democracy. It is a cultural dilution problem from outside the original democratic framework. Immigrants basically. They're merchant class set up special interest groups, they sway public opinion drastically changing the political landscape to toxic and boom there goes that country. That is pretty much how democracy died in Plato's republic. Kinda makes you happy our forefathers were smart enough to go with a republic instead. Like most of the world's successful countries. Japan, south Korea, Germany, Russia, yes Russia, Ukraine, Great Britain and Good ol' France too. They are not anymore democratic then the rest of us. They have representation. Thats how that works.

It is possible to fake it till we make it. Yes. This would be so very bad for us though. As it would then open us up to the enemy from within. Which is not a maybe in this country. You need to know that. You need to respect that. We are a nation of immigrants with some seriously powerful special interest groups who would be more than happy for us to become a democracy they can easily control. Grand scheme what you are witnessing right now on your tv. The big guy using oligarchy against this problem. Oligarchy is the nature of a capitalist republic. For the love of God Bernie, the Clintons are oligarchs too. So is Paris and the dems still proudly helped her with a bill. Stop acting like its new and only the republicans. I'm half your age and don't have the education. You get away with it because we are a people who respects and listens to our elders not a fucking patriarchy nor a matriarchy. I know bernie and nancy know this because they exploit it well.  It is the only thing that can keep special interest in check. It makes it so there is a reason to allow special interest groups in our nation and allow oligarch such power and autonomy.  However this democracy bullshit is out of hand and if you didn't realize before you read this then I hope you do now. It is a threat. A weapon of peace. Nothing to go to war over. But after repeatedly saying something my whole life. I have to ask when exactly are you acting maliciously against your own government. Where do you draw the line? Democracy sounds like a great Idea. Doesn't mean it was one. It's own creator died regretting it. I tire of people repeating it as if it were a good thing and it tries my patience thinking the best of intentions when it never ends and it never gets corrected. When is it sedition? When is it international weaponized gaslighting and were we the first to do it or was it another country that infected ours? These are my current questions I cannot find answers to. But why would I be a able to? 

If I could ask any one thing of a friend right now. To help give me peace. Help me make that a bad word. I am so very tired of hearing it and worrying about what the intentions actually are. I will bet this has been up Putin's ass for years. I'm tired of it too. We all should be.

P.S. Jon Stewart said democracy. #sellout I am still in the middle like carlin. I don't think I have heard Oliver make the distinction. If so, someone please point it out. He knows better. They love their Romans. Must be why I feel this itch. I'm left wondering if it is from all the labor.  Which is disturbing. I hate the weapons of peace.

1isw7iq,https://www.reddit.com/r/McDonaldsEmployees/comments/1isw7iq/i_think_im_going_to_quit_not_even_a_month_in_usa/,I Think I'm Going To Quit Not Even A Month In (USA),"Hello Everyone!!  
  
I have worked at McDonalds for not even three weeks and I have already decided to quit. It has been the most emotionally stressful and yet boring thing I have ever had to experience in my life. I never even wanted a job but since I graduated early (In January) my mom said I had to get a job till I start my esthetician program in July. So I got a job to make my mom happy but it didn’t make anyone actually happy. As I am unhappy and so is my mom.  
  
Everything was fine at first except I thought the hours were a little crazy. They’d have me working a morning shift on Monday then a closing shift on Tuesday then a day shift Wednesday. It was super chaotic and hard to start a decent sleep schedule and find people to take me to work. I don’t have my drivers licence yet but that's a whole other thing. And a kid that started only a week before me tried to ask for a schedule adjustment and he straight up got denied so I figured it would be a waste to ask for one myself.  
  
Second week is when I really just wanted to quit but I calmed down half way through the week and everything was fine. Although I did have to practically beg and plead with my general manager and the lady who is like in charge of the whole building (No clue what her actual title is) to get the 19th off so I can go to a dentist appointment that I already had to reschedule for work and couldn’t reschedule again without losing the appointment entirely.  
  
And today was just the worst day imaginable. Our shift lead for the second half of the afternoon comes in and you can already tell she had a bad day at school. Which is fine I get it but everytime she would pass me a bag she would slide it on the little shelf thingy we have. And she did it one too many times in her angry rage that the bag fell on the floor and we had to completely remake this whole order and they had already been waiting for like 10 minutes because we were super busy. Also this girl for the life of her could not bag in a timely manner she just could not do it. Anyways in comes Tammy who I actually have no idea what her official role is at the store. No clue if she is a manager or what all I know is she comes and goes as she pleases multiple times a day and not even in uniform. And she starts yelling at all of us for the long wait times and I get removed from my presenting spot which is fine. But also it was not my fault at all for the slow wait times. As the presenter I physically have no control on how fast the food is placed into my area so I can give it to the customers.  
  
I got my place back and everything was fine even though I felt like crying because I got yelled at and blamed for something that was not my fault at all. Also the lid to a coffee wasn’t put on all the way so I spilled and it burnt my hand so bad I almost burst into tears right there in the window. But more people showed up and the shift lead told me “Can you like..go clean or something?” Which made me feel really awful because it’s not like I’m bad at my job. Literally the day before the building manager told me that I am good and I was a good person to hire so why am I being treated like trash all of a sudden?  
  
So I cleaned and restocked the front of the store because I have no backbone even though I just wanted to walk out. I had about 30 minutes left of my shift so I figured I could just tough it out or whatever. When I was done I was just standing there because I had nothing to do and then Tammy told me just to go home. So I did. And I cried in the car to my mother.  
  
Last week my mom told me if I wanted to quit then I could but only if she never had to clean the house again. And I’m seriously thinking about it. I didn’t even get the job for the money or the experience I got it because my mom told me to and now she doesn’t want me to work there if I’m going to be crying all the time.   
  
The problem is I’m nervous to quit because I feel bad. It’s not like they are understaffed; they just hired a bunch of people the other day. I just don’t know how to go about quitting. Do I just call them up and be like them?   
  
“My name is BLANK and I’m calling to say I quit,”   
  
But I don’t think I can even do two weeks after that. But no call, no showing seems mean. So I just don’t know what to do. If you’ve made it this far thank you for listening to my ranting!",2,1739936909.0,McDonaldsEmployees,0,1.0,False

Missing home and my family, but I’ll have a bit of fun.

Beer was drank from the Chevron on the corner.

Tonight’s Dream Theater album is Awake. How fitting, because I’m not going to bed anytime soon.

This album sounds incredible and has me second-guessing my post I made about Parasomnia last night. Volume all the way up through the Shure SE215’s, my tinnitus be damned.

Well The Mirror comes on and I’m hyped and drunk as shit. So I decide to turn all the lights off other than the laptop screen and jump between the two queen beds like I’m in the worst music video ever. Complete with James hand gestures and all.

Then “look in the mirror, my friend” comes up, and what’s on the wall?

That’s right, a goddamed hexagonal decorative vanity mirror above the desk. I look like such a clown but I’m having too much fun.

Oh wait, didn’t Mike write this song about his struggles with alcohol? 

I’m alright, there’s still a 24oz Miller Lite in the mini fridge. I mean c’mon, it’d be gone by now if I had a problem. The two 24oz Shiner Bocks were all I needed anyway.

Anyway, to spark a discussion other than how lame I am, anyone else like to partake in drinking or other substances while listening to Dream Theater? I love morning coffee and checking emails with DT too.",1,1739936632.0,Dreamtheater,0,1.0,False

Therefore, this story is a tad different from those normally on here, but I hope it raises a few smiles, and writing this has kept me entertained while I deal with some considerable healing pain. 

On one particular day, I was woken up at about 11 am (I am guessing) to be told by the suddenly very wired and intense ward sister that the ward had been closed down and your visitor would appear shortly. Honestly, with all the drugs I was on, she could have told me the moon was on fire. I didn't understand what I was being told and didn't care.

What I do remember was that they insisted I needed to be cleaned up, so I was bathed by two young, attractive nurses in nursing uniforms. This should have been incredibly sexy. All I remember is thinking how much it hurt and why they could not just leave me alone. I must have been really ill. 

At some point later, three vistors do arrive to see me. I welcomed them with the very professional and friendly 'What the f\*\*k are you doing here?"". We must have made small talk for a while but I can't honestly say what we spoke about it.

This is when the food preparation person arrived. Fortunately, this interaction has stayed with me. Possibly as it was lunch, therefore the longest period between medication, or maybe due to the pure comedic value of what happened next. 

The food preparation person was distinctly put out by the visitors being there and said something along the lines of ""What are you doing here? This is protected time? You must get out now"". My visitors were a tad perplexed and went to introduce themselves but were cut off with another ultimatum. After what felt like a long standoff but probably was no more than a handful of seconds, the food preparation person declared he would get the ward sister and call security.

We all rather looked at each other with confusion and a certain amount of amusement, and I can only guess what happened next. What I can be sure of is that the ward sister appeared at the door, looked panicked and started running (or at least moving quickly, as I could only hear this) back down the corridor. In my head, she then rugby tackled the food preparation person who was calling security or some other help but that is purely my head cannon. 

A couple of minutes later, the food preparation person, flanked by the lead ward doctor and ward sister, returned to us.  The food preparation person clearly had an idea something was going on and started into his rant about how important patients' eating schedules were and that just because someone is busy, they can't ignore visiting hours. (Again, I have surmised this, but I did hear it at least 3 other times when on the ward). He got about a sentence and a half in before one of my guests interrupted and said something very close to:

""I apologise for interfering with dinner but this really was my only opportunity to speak to Mr OP before his next surgery"". 

Any basic response from the food preparation person would have been sufficient but he couldn't help but put a little dig in when accepting the apology with the line. ""Thank you but remember who makes the rules here"" (or something along those lines, again my memory fails me here). 

So my guest gets up and says. ""It is true that I do not work here but I am 'name' and the health minister for 'nation' so I guess I am the person who makes up the rules."" 

Food preparation person's jaw drops open far enough that he may have been able to swallow his whole trolley. The ward nurse hit herself in the face with quite some force, and the ward doctor snorted. I got the giggles. They lasted bleeding ages, and it hurt like hell. I had two major chest drains and multiple broken ribs from being resuscitated. Giggling is not a good thing in this scenario. 

Unfortunately, I'm not entirely sure what happened next other than, I imagine, a considerable amount of embarrassment. However, I think this has to be one of the best 'I don't work here but' moments to ever see. A moment that has crystallised in my mind and one of the few moments of levity in a time that has really sucked. 

Just to finish, I would like to answer the obvious question - 'OP, why were you being visited by a health minister? That's weird and sounds like a lie.'. 

The answer to that is easy. Firstly, I am a senior part of the third (charity) sector and work in health/social care etc. so we work together on a regular basis. Secondly, we are of a similar age. When I started off as a low-level person in the sector, they were running around getting coffee for politicians as their support staff. We had drinks then and hopefully will do so in the future. So hopefully that answers this question.

Finally, I would like to thank every surgeon, doctor, nurse, phlebotomist, food preparation person, cleaner, porter and anyone else I have missed for saving my life across the multiple hospitals I had to inhabit to get fixed. I know this is going into the ether, and maybe no one will read it, but I hope the good vibes reach them all and they have a good day.

Then later in the day after I've done a lot of driving, my shifts are not as good. Not terrible, but not buttery. Clutch usually does more work and I'm a bit clunky. 

I'm sure it's normal to some extent. I just wish I could have better endurance and still shift crisp, even if it is the end of the day and I'm exhuasted.

Although I have found, if I do more open country road ripping when I've been driving, my shifts arn't so bad. I think my adrenaline gets pumping and maybe it is just easier to shift when going quicker. What I struggle most with is driving in traffic with a bunch of lights. For some reason I actually find that the toughest part to get smooth shifts. 

I really think a lot is in my head. I think I'm actually a great shifter even if I'm not great all the time. I've gotten into rythems where I feel so smooth. So I know I have that ability. I just need to focus on getting there more often.

I am going to take meditating seriously and think it will make me feel more focused, relaxed, and present while shifting. I find when I overthink shifting it turns out clunky. But when I just let it flow I am usually smooth. So I need to keep focusing on what I want the car to do and feel like versus what timing or movements I'm doing with the inputs.

Any ways to practice for endurance? Maybe Ill drive only in 5 minute intervals and during that 5 mins give it my all. Then rest 5 minutes and repeat. That way I'm fresh and practicing being perfect!",2,1739935671.0,stickshift,2,1.0,False

I have 2 safe foods, yogurt and some cheeses, but most everything else smells rancid. Eggs are ok sometimes.   
My biggest culprits are coffee, bread, and onions. I miss coffee. I used to drink a pot a day. And onions are in everything. 

I work at Walmart picking groceries so I'm all over the store all day smelling all the smells. The break room is probably the worst because I can't get away from the smell of coffee and everyone's food.

1isvgzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/penpalsover30/comments/1isvgzz/34m_usa_longing_for_intense_and_deep_connection/,"34M, USA - Longing for intense and deep connection and elaborate exchange","Salutations!

I've been interested in penpalling ever since I was a kid - back in the days before you could more easily meet someone from half way across the world sooner than a neighbor a few doors down. I've been fortunate enough to have had a few before, mostly focusing on item exchanges, letters, and postcards, and would like to see if I can find that again, being able to live those experiences and to give that to someone else as well.

Ideally, I'd like to have a physical exchange, with my preference being letters and items. Due to the private nature of penpaling, however, I'd like us to actually chat a bit and get to know each other before diving right into those physical aspects of it. Let's become familiar with each other to make sure we're a good fit. All that being said, I'm also interested in having e-mail penpals, which I'd be open to in the immediate now. It's more than possible for one form to transition into the other or for us to have multiple forms of penpalling going on at the same time.

My ideal communication method with someone is in the form of lengthy, detailed, intricate paragraphs and pages that delve into a variety of topics and themes. Even when meeting people in less defined ways we sometimes end up becoming de facto penpals due to how long it takes to properly respond to each other. So, if digital exchange is what you're after, this is the style it should take. I'm less particular when it comes to the physical. I've done pages upon pages in the form of letters and postcards in what looked like 8 point font, as well as exchanges that included almost no words at all or even focused exclusively on items. The form of our penpalling doesn't matter as much as what works for us. Above all, I'm here to meet a person that I want to engage in penpalling with and not someone to fulfill a word count and dollar amount. What I'm after is connection and intrigue and not an extra piece of mail every few weeks.

On that note, who, exactly, may you be connecting with?

I'm 34, male, and from the Eastern US. I'm looking for someone that I first and foremost relate to on a personal and deeper level. My ideal is to actually get to know my penpal - cold exchanges are less interesting to me, but aren't completely rejected. Location doesn't matter as much, as who the person is defines whether I'd like to connect with them or not. That being said, I do have a preference for cultural exchange and differences, so I'm more open to people from parts of the world more distinct from my own. Part of why I like penpaling is to be exposed to things I otherwise wouldn't be and to allow that for someone else as well. But, whether you're in my state or half the world away, it's you, the person, I want to exchange with.

* I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion. I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.
* The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else. Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life. I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata.*' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity. While we're on the topic, since it fits better here than in most spots, I don't do the politics thing. If it's a requirement of yours that someone shares your exact political, cultural, or personal values, we should discuss it bluntly and quickly to see if something is possible between us. No 'side' or 'sphere' is one I relate all that much to and I have contentions with all of them.
* More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction. Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. I haven't consumed media regularly in years, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games.
* I'm INTJ and am Type 5. I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Think we could have a great exchange? Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with. Have any uncertainties or feel unsure? Leave your hesitations and take the chance. If you liked anything you read here, there's a very high likelihood of us both gaining and experiencing something wonderful together. Don't doubt yourself or what's possible. The person themselves matters more than the form of penpalling we take on and any specific details. You never know until you take the plunge, and I've certainly been shocked countless times in life by what does and doesn't work.",1,1739934656.0,penpalsover30,0,1.0,False

Another protein shake base success! This was really delicious, I think from adding the cocoa powder and 2 different kinds of coffee to bump up the flavor. 

Recipe:

* 1 Bolthouse Farms mocha cappuccino
* 1/3 cup 2% milk
* 1/3 cup black coffee
* 2 tbsp. instant coffee
* 1 tbsp. cocoa powder

Dumped everything in the Creami container and hit it with an immersion blender. Froze for 24 hours, spun on Lite Ice Cream, then 1 re-spin with a splash of almond milk (ran out of 2%). 

381 calories for the whole container, 63 calories per serving.

I am glad that the Bolthouse Farms shakes work as well as the Core Fairlife, as I can find a lot more flavor varieties at my local grocery store. I have a mixed berry smoothie that I'm looking forward to trying next, maybe with a chopped white chocolate or vanilla wafer mix-in.",1,1739934643.0,ninjacreami,1,1.0,False

In school it was all about popularity and friends you had would ditch you for bullies if they saw them as popular or wanted to be in a certain crowd. I had a few friends who didn’t talk to me as they didn’t want to be involved with people from high school anymore as it was toxic and my other friends was trouble, which I can’t blame them. One girl moved away and we still FaceTime but it’s kind of dead. The gang I did have, one became a drug addict and had sex with an underage girl and the other two just sided with her because they were scared of her. They stabbed each other in the back and was a gossip friendship group. I had enough and distanced myself. 

Then in sixth form college, I had a lot of acquaintances but not proper close friends. I mean because the friendships was so surface level and we only bonded in class, when they went off to uni, they didn’t really make an effort to stay in contact.

Now at University, I have like one friend who is great but the others are either always busy, will leave you on delivered for weeks and come back like nothing happened or just don’t want to do any plans or anything. Sure it’s fine to chat online but it’s rubbish when they won’t even go for a coffee or something. 

I mean the people who was very social and super keen to befriend me at university was just the toxic people who would befriend anyone so they could have drama and stir stuff. I didn’t want to be involved. 

I see people who have like 2 or 3 good friends from school or college and can trust them and they won’t backstab them or leave them on read until they can be bothered or find them useful for stuff. Why have I never made good friends and always attracted toxic bullies or people who just use you, but won’t be there long term.

I've been interested in penpalling ever since I was a kid - back in the days before you could more easily meet someone from half way across the world sooner than a neighbor a few doors down. I've been fortunate enough to have had a few before, mostly focusing on item exchanges, letters, and postcards, and would like to see if I can find that again, being able to live those experiences and to give that to someone else as well.

Ideally, I'd like to have a physical exchange, with my preference being letters and items. Due to the private nature of penpaling, however, I'd like us to actually chat a bit and get to know each other before diving right into those physical aspects of it. Let's become familiar with each other to make sure we're a good fit. All that being said, I'm also interested in having e-mail penpals, which I'd be open to in the immediate now. It's more than possible for one form to transition into the other or for us to have multiple forms of penpalling going on at the same time.

My ideal communication method with someone is in the form of lengthy, detailed, intricate paragraphs and pages that delve into a variety of topics and themes. Even when meeting people in less defined ways we sometimes end up becoming de facto penpals due to how long it takes to properly respond to each other. So, if digital exchange is what you're after, this is the style it should take. I'm less particular when it comes to the physical. I've done pages upon pages in the form of letters and postcards in what looked like 8 point font, as well as exchanges that included almost no words at all or even focused exclusively on items. The form of our penpalling doesn't matter as much as what works for us. Above all, I'm here to meet a person that I want to engage in penpalling with and not someone to fulfill a word count and dollar amount. What I'm after is connection and intrigue and not an extra piece of mail every few weeks.

On that note, who, exactly, may you be connecting with?

It’s like we blink and suddenly have 20 tabs open, not a single one actually relevant to the task at hand. 😅 We've all been there, swimming in distractions and wondering how on earth we’re supposed to actually get anything done.

But what if I told you *focusing like a pro* is not some mystical secret? Nope, it’s a mindset. Here’s how:

1. **Set Boundaries with Technology**  
   Our phones are basically extensions of our hands, right? But here's the kicker: Try putting your phone on *Do Not Disturb* mode or, if you dare, airplane mode. 🤯 Create tech-free zones during work hours. It’s like giving yourself permission to ignore the noise.

2. **Chunk It, Don’t Funk It**  
   Break tasks into smaller, manageable pieces. Ever hear of the Pomodoro Technique? It’s a game-changer. You do 25 minutes of focused work, then a 5-minute break. Just enough time to make a cup of coffee or stare into space like a zen monk.

3. **Say No and Mean It**  
   FOMO is real, but saying 'no' to that extra hour of scrolling or those last-minute coffee invites (sorry, Karen) helps preserve your energy for the things that matter. Your future self will thank you, I promise.

4. **Make Friends with a Timer**  
   Have you ever tried racing against the clock? Set a timer for tasks and watch how quickly you slip into the zone. It’s like turning your to-do list into a competitive sport.

5. **Create Your Personal Fortress of Focus**  
   Find a spot where you feel in the zone and make it your work sanctuary. Whether it’s a quiet corner or a bustling café that makes you feel like a writer in a romcom, just go with it. Whatever works!

6. **Remember Your Why**  
   Why are you doing what you’re doing? Remembering your purpose can be a beacon in a sea of distractions. Jot down your goals, keep them visible, and remind yourself: “This is my why.”

Anyone else got tricks that help them dodge distraction tornadoes? Life's a wild ride and maybe today, *we work smarter*, not harder. Go on, give these a spin and let me know if you find your focus magic. 😊✨",1,1739934324.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Protecting our time and energy sometimes feels like trying to herd cats—futile and mildly chaotic. But hey, it doesn’t have to be!

So, how do we set boundaries without feeling like a total party pooper? Here’s a little checklist that’s helped me, and maybe it’ll do the trick for you too:

1. **Say ‘No’ Without Guilt**  
   Seriously, *no* isn't a bad word, even if it feels like it sometimes. Ever find yourself overcommitting because you think you're supposed to? 🙋‍♂️ Newsflash: it's okay to turn down that extra project or skip a social event. Your sanity will thank you.

2. **Schedule ‘Nothing’ Time**  
   No, you’re not lazy, you’re a **time management wizard.** Blocking out an hour just for you to do nothing (or whatever makes you happy) is sacred. It gives your brain a breather and recharges your inner battery. Think of it as maintenance for your peace of mind.

3. **Be Honest with Yourself and Others**  
   If you're an introvert, admit it. If Friday nights are sacred Netflix-and-nap nights, own it. The people who matter will get it—and you’ll be way happier being honest about what works for you.

4. **Limit Distractions**  
   Social media black holes, anyone? 🙄 Set some boundaries around tech use. Try not to let your phone dictate your priorities. You could even...wait for it...turn off notifications. Crazy, right?

5. **Guard Your Morning Like a Dragon**  
   Mornings set the tone for your day. Claim them as your own. Whether it's a small yoga sesh, a quiet coffee, or just time staring out the window (visual meditation anyone?), make sure those first moments are yours.

6. **Feedback Loop**  
   Boundaries aren't one-size-fits-all. Sometimes you need to tweak them based on what works and what doesn't. Your life is yours to customize, so don’t be afraid to adjust things as you go.

Now, I’m curious. How do you guys protect your time and energy? Have any of these worked for you, or maybe you’ve got other tips up your sleeve? 🤔 Share if you like, or just think about it as you carve out some sweet, sweet “me time.” Who's up for a little boundary-setting party? 🎉",1,1739934193.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Seeing just how utterly vitriolic some of their detractors are, I have occasionally been vaguely worried ""fuck I hope nobody just throws their coffee on me"" wearing TF out in public. lol

That being said, here's just some raw data for ya. 

I've genuinely had *dozens* of people say ""oh my goodness that is such a cool hoodie / shirt!"" about various pieces that I've worn. I always say ""Thanks, It's from a really cool company called Teddy Fresh."" 

I have only run into one person who specifically recognized my outfit as Teddy Fresh, because she was wearing some too! It was a nice young lady wearing the ""Dump Him"" dumptruck sweater, and we had a brief FAMILY moment. 

Other than that, I have literally never, *EVER* had a single person give me any shit for wearing Teddy Fresh. I have never even seen someone give me a dirty look. 

Additionally I have never had anyone make a negative comment about the actual pattern or appearance of the clothes. 

Based on this data I can only surmise the following: 

-Teddy Fresh looks cool as fuck

-Snarkers / H3 haters represent a much, MUCH smaller proportion of overall discourse than they would like for Ethan, Hila, and us to believe.

-Snarkers are anti-social cowards who wouldn't even dare meet my gaze in real life

So genuinely rest assured, you can wear all your drippiest drip out on the town and nobody is going to say or do shit. Only terminally online radical leftists consider TF part of their ""divestment list.""

Thought I was buying local, came with a sticker ""made in Indonesia""","I bought a pretty expensive hand carved scrimshaw turtle on Etsy, thinking I was supporting a local (Hawaiian) artist. When it came, it had a sticker ""Made in Indonesia""

I checked to see if I overlooked something. The product itself had no such disclaimer. And everything on their main website makes it appear their stuff is made in Hawaii. Phrases like: -> ""guaranteed authenticity"" -->""everything we offer is carefully curated to share the magic of Hawaii with the world.""

In hindsight, it's obvious & quite intentional. They were careful what they wrote to make the buyer ASSUME the product was made in Hawaii, without ever explicitly making that claim.

BUT...one of their FAQs says:

""4. Are your products made in Hawaii? Many of our products are sourced directly from Hawaii, including items like Hawaiian coffee, Molokai salt, and body care items. We also carry products inspired by Hawaiian culture.""

So, friends...

**WHAT SHOULD I DO?**   Make a stink? Return it? Keep it, having learned a lesson? Other?

Thank you! ♥️

1isvaap,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1isvaap/what_should_i_upgrade_to_from_jultra_for_workflow/,What should I upgrade to from J-ultra for workflow enhancement? [J-Ultra >$< Philos],"TLDR: Have J-ultra. Want something faster with better workflow. Details below.

I am new to manual espresso (had a super automatic for many years) and started with a leverpresso pro and 1zpresso j-ultra. I honestly love both of them. I bought the flair power tower to try and enhance workflow, but it needs babysitting. It’s less “work”, but I have to come back and tap it so the beans fall into the grinder periodically.

I assume this means electric. But I am not \*opposed\* to manual, it just needs to fit the workflow. A much faster manual grinder, or one that works well in other ways would be great. HG-2? (above budget, but might work for me).

I am a bit blown away by what this setup can produce. I am not sure I have ever tasted espresso as good as this. I don’t think I have even found coffee that is my style. Just dialed in random store brands and a local coffee shop espresso blend. None of them are my thing, but still quite good. 

I bought the j-ultra as a starter to get my feet wet. I am looking for an upgrade that at least matches j-ultra taste/quality and improves workflow. One option I have come across is the Lagom Casa 65CL that is coming soon. But, obviously, there are a thousand options. I don’t \*want\* to spend 1K+ without really good reason. I also don’t really want a massive grinder. I am low on space as it is.

I don’t have a strong feeling on conical vs flat or size of the burrs. I am more interested in buying every local coffee and exploring what I can make with them. I am planning to move the j-ultra to non-espresso duty (possibly even off the flair power tower, because when grinding for aeropress or filter, it just isn’t that hard).

I have a breville frother that I also like a lot. One button, no attention needed, delicious frothed latte or breve.

I also want to produce larger shots for bigger drinks (or to split a single shot between myself and my wife). I have several different size baskets coming in to accommodate that.

I love my normcore blind shaker and plan to get the sworks one (or another that works well with whatever grinder I select). The flair power tower is too tight under the j-ultra and often releases some grinds if I grind into the shaker. I just grind into the ultra magnetic dosing cup and transfer.

I am looking at everything from the df54 to the philos. The casa 65cl seems to be a pretty good middle ground. But not available for a while.

What decent grinder has great workflow? Something I don’t have to babysit. The casa auto shutoff is particularly appealing.

Multi-purpose is also important. While the j-ultra may take on non espresso needs, I probably still want to be able to grind for aeropress and pour over (or even french press) when I need to make higher volume of coffee.

I am in the US and open to anything I can reasonably obtain here.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1isv5t6,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1isv5t6/i_booked_an_airbnb_for_a_holiday_in_hawaii_there/,I Booked an Airbnb for a Holiday in Hawaii… There Are Strange RULES TO FOLLOW,"I never thought a simple vacation could go so wrong. In fact, when I planned this trip, I imagined nothing but peace—two nights away from the noise of everyday life, a chance to reset. I wasn’t looking for adventure, and I definitely wasn’t looking for trouble. But trouble has a way of finding you, especially when you least expect it.

I booked an Airbnb in Hawaii, a quiet little house nestled deep in the jungle. Nothing fancy, just a simple retreat surrounded by nature. The listing had beautiful photos—warm lighting, wooden interiors, lush greenery outside the windows. It looked perfect. Cozy, secluded, exactly what I needed. The host, a woman named Leilani, seemed friendly in her messages. She had tons of positive reviews, guests praising her hospitality and the house’s charm. It all felt safe, normal. I needed this escape, a break from everything. I had no idea that stepping into that house would be stepping into something I wasn’t prepared for.

The first sign that something was off came before I even arrived. I received an email with the subject line: **""Important: Rules for Your Stay (MUST READ).""**

At first, I barely glanced at it. Every Airbnb has rules—don’t smoke, don’t throw parties, clean up after yourself. I assumed this would be the same. But as I scrolled, my casual attitude faded. The list was long. Strangely long. And some of the rules made no sense.

* **Lock all doors at 9:00 PM sharp. Do not wait a second longer.**
* **If you hear any tapping or knocking between midnight and 3:00 AM, do not answer. Do not open the door. Do not look out the window.**
* **If you wake up to any sensation of being watched, do not move. Wait until you no longer feel it.**
* **Do not turn on the porch light after sunset.**
* **If you find any object in the house that wasn’t there when you arrived, do not touch it. Do not look directly at the carving. Email us immediately.**
* **Before leaving, sprinkle salt at the four corners of the house and never look back when you go.**

I stared at the list, rereading certain lines, trying to make sense of them. At first, I laughed. Maybe it was a joke? A weird local superstition? Some kind of tradition? The house was deep in the jungle, so maybe Leilani had reasons for these rules—something about wildlife, burglars, or just keeping the place in order. It felt strange, sure, but harmless.

I figured I’d follow them, if only out of respect. Besides, what was the worst that could happen?

But then the night began. And everything changed.

I arrived in the late afternoon, and the moment I stepped out of the car, I felt the quiet. Not the peaceful kind, but the kind that makes you hesitate. Still, the house was beautiful, even more so than the pictures had shown. Wooden beams stretched across the ceiling, the open windows let in a warm breeze, and beyond them, the jungle whispered with the rustling of leaves. The air was thick with humidity, carrying the scent of damp earth and blooming flowers. It was the kind of place that should have made me feel at ease. And at first, it did.

I unpacked slowly, placing my bag near the bed, my toiletries in the bathroom, my phone on the nightstand. Every movement felt strangely heavy, as if I were sinking into the house’s stillness. For a while, I just stood in the center of the room, absorbing it. The weight of silence. The weight of being alone. It was different from the usual solitude I craved—it wasn’t peace. It was something else.

Then, as the sun began to dip beyond the trees, the feeling grew stronger. The air inside the house felt... different. Thicker. As if the walls themselves were pressing in, waiting. I glanced at the clock.

**8:45 PM.**

The rule came back to me suddenly, uninvited. **Lock the doors at 9:00 PM sharp. Do not wait a second longer.**

I swallowed hard, shaking my head at my own nerves. It was just a precaution, right? Maybe the host had a reason—wild animals, or maybe just overly cautious house rules. Either way, I wasn’t about to test it. I double-checked the windows, shut the back door, and turned the lock on the front door at exactly 8:59 PM.

Settling onto the couch, I tried to shake the unease. Nothing had happened. Nothing would happen. I scrolled through my phone, let a movie play in the background, told myself I was just overthinking. And for a while, it worked. The night passed without incident.

Until I woke up to a sound that sent a chill straight through me.

**Knock. Knock. Knock.**

Three Knocks on The Front door.

Slow. Deliberate.

My breath caught in my throat. My body locked up. **If you hear any tapping or knocking between midnight and 3:00 AM, do not answer. Do not open the door.** The words from the email slammed into my head like an alarm. I clenched my jaw, forcing myself to stay still.

The knocking continued. Not frantic. Not demanding. Just... patient. **Knock. Knock. Knock.** A steady rhythm, like whoever—or whatever—stood on the other side knew I was awake. Knew I was listening.

I turned my head ever so slightly toward the nightstand. My phone’s screen glowed in the darkness. **12:42 AM.**

I held my breath.

And then—silence.

I waited. Five minutes. Ten. The air in the room felt wrong, like the quiet had thickened. My skin prickled, every nerve in my body screaming at me not to move. I squeezed my eyes shut, pretending to be asleep, pretending I hadn’t heard anything at all.

But I couldn’t sleep after that.

I lay there, stiff as a board, my mind cycling through possibilities. Was it really nothing? Some late-night visitor, lost in the jungle? A sick prank? My fingers itched to reach for my phone, to check the door, to **look**—but the rule stopped me.

So I stayed there. Frozen. Listening to the silence.

I didn’t sleep again until the first light of morning.

The second night, I woke up again—but this time, it wasn’t a sound that pulled me from my sleep. It was a feeling.

a feeling that Something was **there**.

I didn’t know how I knew it, but I did. I could feel it, standing just inches from my bed. Watching me.

My heart pounded in my chest, my breath coming in shallow gasps. I wanted to move, to **run**, but my body wouldn’t listen. I was completely frozen, paralyzed by the sheer wrongness of the moment. The air around me was thick and unmoving, as if the entire room had been drained of life. The walls, the ceiling, the bed—everything felt distant, unreal.

**If you wake up to any sensation of being watched, Do not move until it stops.**

The words from the rules echoed in my mind. I squeezed my eyes shut and forced myself to obey. Seconds stretched into eternity. My fingers twitched, desperate to grab the blanket, to shield myself from whatever was there. But I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe. I just **waited**.

Then, just like that, it was gone.

The air shifted, like a weight lifting from my chest. I sucked in a breath, feeling control return to my limbs. My heart was still hammering, but I could move again.

Shaky, unsteady, I forced myself out of bed. My legs felt weak, but I needed water. I needed to **do something**, anything, to break the tension.

I made my way to the kitchen, gripping the counter for support. The coolness of the tile beneath my feet grounded me, made me feel human again. But as I passed the living room, I saw something that made my stomach drop.

There was **something** on the coffee table.

A small wooden carving.

I stepped closer, my breath hitching. The figure was of a man—his face twisted, hollow eyes staring, mouth stretched unnaturally wide, as if frozen in an eternal, silent scream.

I knew, without a doubt, that it hadn’t been there before.

I had checked the house when I arrived. Every room, every shelf, every table. **This hadn’t been here.**

The rule came rushing back:

**If you find any object in the house that wasn’t there when you arrived, Do not touch it. Email us immediately.**

My hands trembled as I grabbed my phone. My fingers fumbled over the screen as I typed a message to Leilani, my breath uneven.

She replied almost instantly.

**""Do not touch it. Leave the house. Come back after sunrise, and when you return, do not look at the carving. Throw a towel over it, take it outside, bury it deep in the ground after sunset. Don’t ask questions.""**

I didn’t need convincing. The moment I read those words, I was out the door. I didn’t care how ridiculous it felt—I just **ran**.

I stayed away until the sun had fully risen. The jungle was eerily quiet when I returned, and my hands were still shaking as I **pushed** open the door.

The carving was still there.

I forced myself not to look at it directly. I grabbed a towel from the bathroom, draped it over the figure, and lifted it with careful, trembling hands. Even through the fabric, it felt **wrong**—too cold, too heavy for something so small.

I walked deep into the jungle after sunset, my heart hammering with every step. The trees loomed high above me, their shadows stretching through the thick darkness. I dug a hole as fast as I could, shoved the carving into the earth, and covered it with trembling hands.

I didn’t **ask questions**.

I didn’t **look back**.

I sprinted to the house, locking the door behind me. My chest rose and fell rapidly, my skin slick with sweat. I needed to sleep. I needed this night to be over.

But no sooner had I gone to bed, grabbed a blanket, and prepared to sleep than I heard a whisper.

It was so soft, so close, like a breath against my ear.

*""Look at me… You must look at me…"" it said.*

A chill ran down my spine.

I squeezed my eyes shut, gripping the blanket like a lifeline. The whispering continued, curling around me like smoke.

*""Look at me…"" it Continued.*

And then—stupidly, instinctively—

I turned my head toward the sound.

My breath caught in my throat.

The carving was back.

That was the moment I knew—I had to leave.

My entire body was screaming at me to **run**, to get out, to put as much distance between me and this cursed place as possible. My hands trembled as I stuffed my belongings into my bag, my breath coming in short, panicked gasps. I didn’t care about being quiet. I didn’t care about anything except getting out.

But then—the last rule.

**Before leaving, sprinkle salt at the four corners of the house and never look back when you go.**

I hesitated, my mind racing. Did it even matter anymore? Would it make a difference? But I wasn’t about to take chances. My hands were numb as I grabbed the salt from the kitchen counter and rushed to each corner of the house, scattering it with quick, jerky movements. My legs felt weak, my chest tight with fear.

When I reached the front door, I exhaled sharply, gripping the handle. **Just open it. Just step outside.**

I twisted the knob.

Nothing.

I tried again, harder this time. The door didn’t move.

A sharp jolt of panic shot through me. I **yanked** at it, my breath hitching as I threw my weight against the wood. **It wouldn’t budge.**

Then—

I heard A sound behind me.

A soft, almost delicate **rustle**.

The hairs on my neck stood on end. Every part of me screamed **don’t turn around**. But I did.

And there it was.

The wooden carving.

Sitting **in the middle of the floor**, facing me.

My pulse pounded in my ears. I took a slow step backward, my mind trying to make sense of the impossible. I had **buried it**. I had followed the instructions. But now, here it was. **Waiting. Watching.**

Then the room shifted.

The walls seemed to **breathe**, warping and twisting, the corners stretching in ways they shouldn’t. My vision blurred as a heavy pressure settled over me, thick and suffocating. The air **hummed**, like something was waking up.

And then—

**The carving moved.**

At first, just a twitch. A slow, deliberate tilt of its head.

Then—

Its mouth **opened wider**.

Too wide. A gaping, unnatural void.

And then, a voice came from it.

**""You didn’t follow the rule...""** it said.

A cold hand clamped down on my shoulder.

I couldn’t move.

The touch burned like ice, freezing me in place. My breath hitched, my body locked in terror. The door—**the door suddenly burst open**—a rush of wind slamming against me.

I **tried** to run.

I lunged forward, desperate to escape, but something **pulled me backward**.

The walls **spun**. The room twisted around me. My screams echoed, swallowed by the air itself.

And then—

**Darkness.**

I don’t remember hitting the floor. I don’t remember what happened next.

I just woke up.

Morning light poured through the windows, painting the house in soft gold. For a moment, I thought it had all been a dream. But the cold sweat on my skin, the racing of my heart—it was **real**.

I didn’t waste a second.

I grabbed my bags and bolted for the door. This time, it opened with ease. The jungle outside was quiet, the world peaceful again.

But I **didn’t look back**.

Not once.

Leilani never explained the rules. I never asked.

And when I checked the Airbnb listing a few days later, it was gone.

**Like it had never existed.**

I wanted to forget. I **needed** to forget. But this morning—

A new email appeared in my inbox.

**From Leilani.**

1isv4o2,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1isv4o2/ready_to_quit_caffeine/,Ready to quit caffeine,"Hi everyone! I've been using caffeine for about 12 years. I started my habit off with energy drinks and those 5 hours energy shots which were horrible in the long run. They made me go insane and start having peripheral hallucinations and I felt horrible all the time. Nobody would ever validate my feelings or advise me to quit and just thought I was weak. After several years of that I managed to start drinking strictly coffee but in large amounts or high concentrations (150mg cold brew) or teas, which caused less severe problems but still cause problems for me.

For many months or maybe a year I tapered down (which was very challenging because I constantly craved getting high on caffeine). For some reason I feel like caffeine should make me motivated and enhance my performance, but I still know it only slows me down and makes me dull despite the way it feels.

I'm currently at 1 morning coffee at home, 1x 70mg sparkling ice 30 minutes later at work to boost the caffeination, and a 30mg Liquid Death drink to combat the  burnout after work.

Not caffeine, but I am also nearly finished quitting zyn, down to a single 3mg can which I use around noon and empty it in about 2 hours. I used to use two cans of 6mg zyn a day which also makes me very sick. Nicotine and caffeine create this weird game where you use nicotine to calm down the effects of caffeine, but it also causes loss of motivation and energy, so I use more caffeine to counter that effect, then I get jittery and use more nicotine until I'm very sick at the end of the day.

I will try to go cold turkey on both tomorrow, mainly because I use more caffeine to fight the crash/impairment of my morning coffee at this point. And any amount of nicotine seems to make me very tired while I'm quitting caffeine so I have to quit that as well.

I have made multiple attempts to quit both over the years but I feel very close, and I'm looking forward to the benefits!

I'm happy to have found this community, because the effects of caffeine i experienced (and the benefits of quitting) seem to be very common here, and it seems nobody in real life can relate to them? They either laugh when I bring it up or say something like ""coffee is good for you!"" which is frustrating. I feel like a lot of time was wasted in a caffeine + nicotine stupor and I don't want to live like that anymore.",1,1739933662.0,decaf,1,1.0,False
1isv42g,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1isv42g/i_booked_an_airbnb_for_a_holiday_in_hawaii_there/,I Booked an Airbnb for a Holiday in Hawaii… There Are Strange RULES TO FOLLOW,"I never thought a simple vacation could go so wrong. In fact, when I planned this trip, I imagined nothing but peace—two nights away from the noise of everyday life, a chance to reset. I wasn’t looking for adventure, and I definitely wasn’t looking for trouble. But trouble has a way of finding you, especially when you least expect it.

I booked an Airbnb in Hawaii, a quiet little house nestled deep in the jungle. Nothing fancy, just a simple retreat surrounded by nature. The listing had beautiful photos—warm lighting, wooden interiors, lush greenery outside the windows. It looked perfect. Cozy, secluded, exactly what I needed. The host, a woman named Leilani, seemed friendly in her messages. She had tons of positive reviews, guests praising her hospitality and the house’s charm. It all felt safe, normal. I needed this escape, a break from everything. I had no idea that stepping into that house would be stepping into something I wasn’t prepared for.

The first sign that something was off came before I even arrived. I received an email with the subject line: **""Important: Rules for Your Stay (MUST READ).""**

At first, I barely glanced at it. Every Airbnb has rules—don’t smoke, don’t throw parties, clean up after yourself. I assumed this would be the same. But as I scrolled, my casual attitude faded. The list was long. Strangely long. And some of the rules made no sense.

* **Lock all doors at 9:00 PM sharp. Do not wait a second longer.**
* **If you hear any tapping or knocking between midnight and 3:00 AM, do not answer. Do not open the door. Do not look out the window.**
* **If you wake up to any sensation of being watched, do not move. Wait until you no longer feel it.**
* **Do not turn on the porch light after sunset.**
* **If you find any object in the house that wasn’t there when you arrived, do not touch it. Do not look directly at the carving. Email us immediately.**
* **Before leaving, sprinkle salt at the four corners of the house and never look back when you go.**

I stared at the list, rereading certain lines, trying to make sense of them. At first, I laughed. Maybe it was a joke? A weird local superstition? Some kind of tradition? The house was deep in the jungle, so maybe Leilani had reasons for these rules—something about wildlife, burglars, or just keeping the place in order. It felt strange, sure, but harmless.

I figured I’d follow them, if only out of respect. Besides, what was the worst that could happen?

But then the night began. And everything changed.

I arrived in the late afternoon, and the moment I stepped out of the car, I felt the quiet. Not the peaceful kind, but the kind that makes you hesitate. Still, the house was beautiful, even more so than the pictures had shown. Wooden beams stretched across the ceiling, the open windows let in a warm breeze, and beyond them, the jungle whispered with the rustling of leaves. The air was thick with humidity, carrying the scent of damp earth and blooming flowers. It was the kind of place that should have made me feel at ease. And at first, it did.

I unpacked slowly, placing my bag near the bed, my toiletries in the bathroom, my phone on the nightstand. Every movement felt strangely heavy, as if I were sinking into the house’s stillness. For a while, I just stood in the center of the room, absorbing it. The weight of silence. The weight of being alone. It was different from the usual solitude I craved—it wasn’t peace. It was something else.

Then, as the sun began to dip beyond the trees, the feeling grew stronger. The air inside the house felt... different. Thicker. As if the walls themselves were pressing in, waiting. I glanced at the clock.

**8:45 PM.**

The rule came back to me suddenly, uninvited. **Lock the doors at 9:00 PM sharp. Do not wait a second longer.**

I swallowed hard, shaking my head at my own nerves. It was just a precaution, right? Maybe the host had a reason—wild animals, or maybe just overly cautious house rules. Either way, I wasn’t about to test it. I double-checked the windows, shut the back door, and turned the lock on the front door at exactly 8:59 PM.

Settling onto the couch, I tried to shake the unease. Nothing had happened. Nothing would happen. I scrolled through my phone, let a movie play in the background, told myself I was just overthinking. And for a while, it worked. The night passed without incident.

Until I woke up to a sound that sent a chill straight through me.

**Knock. Knock. Knock.**

Three Knocks on The Front door.

Slow. Deliberate.

My breath caught in my throat. My body locked up. **If you hear any tapping or knocking between midnight and 3:00 AM, do not answer. Do not open the door.** The words from the email slammed into my head like an alarm. I clenched my jaw, forcing myself to stay still.

The knocking continued. Not frantic. Not demanding. Just... patient. **Knock. Knock. Knock.** A steady rhythm, like whoever—or whatever—stood on the other side knew I was awake. Knew I was listening.

I turned my head ever so slightly toward the nightstand. My phone’s screen glowed in the darkness. **12:42 AM.**

I held my breath.

And then—silence.

I waited. Five minutes. Ten. The air in the room felt wrong, like the quiet had thickened. My skin prickled, every nerve in my body screaming at me not to move. I squeezed my eyes shut, pretending to be asleep, pretending I hadn’t heard anything at all.

But I couldn’t sleep after that.

I lay there, stiff as a board, my mind cycling through possibilities. Was it really nothing? Some late-night visitor, lost in the jungle? A sick prank? My fingers itched to reach for my phone, to check the door, to **look**—but the rule stopped me.

So I stayed there. Frozen. Listening to the silence.

I didn’t sleep again until the first light of morning.

The second night, I woke up again—but this time, it wasn’t a sound that pulled me from my sleep. It was a feeling.

a feeling that Something was **there**.

I didn’t know how I knew it, but I did. I could feel it, standing just inches from my bed. Watching me.

My heart pounded in my chest, my breath coming in shallow gasps. I wanted to move, to **run**, but my body wouldn’t listen. I was completely frozen, paralyzed by the sheer wrongness of the moment. The air around me was thick and unmoving, as if the entire room had been drained of life. The walls, the ceiling, the bed—everything felt distant, unreal.

**If you wake up to any sensation of being watched, Do not move until it stops.**

The words from the rules echoed in my mind. I squeezed my eyes shut and forced myself to obey. Seconds stretched into eternity. My fingers twitched, desperate to grab the blanket, to shield myself from whatever was there. But I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe. I just **waited**.

Then, just like that, it was gone.

The air shifted, like a weight lifting from my chest. I sucked in a breath, feeling control return to my limbs. My heart was still hammering, but I could move again.

Shaky, unsteady, I forced myself out of bed. My legs felt weak, but I needed water. I needed to **do something**, anything, to break the tension.

I made my way to the kitchen, gripping the counter for support. The coolness of the tile beneath my feet grounded me, made me feel human again. But as I passed the living room, I saw something that made my stomach drop.

There was **something** on the coffee table.

A small wooden carving.

I stepped closer, my breath hitching. The figure was of a man—his face twisted, hollow eyes staring, mouth stretched unnaturally wide, as if frozen in an eternal, silent scream.

I knew, without a doubt, that it hadn’t been there before.

I had checked the house when I arrived. Every room, every shelf, every table. **This hadn’t been here.**

The rule came rushing back:

**If you find any object in the house that wasn’t there when you arrived, Do not touch it. Email us immediately.**

My hands trembled as I grabbed my phone. My fingers fumbled over the screen as I typed a message to Leilani, my breath uneven.

She replied almost instantly.

**""Do not touch it. Leave the house. Come back after sunrise, and when you return, do not look at the carving. Throw a towel over it, take it outside, bury it deep in the ground after sunset. Don’t ask questions.""**

I didn’t need convincing. The moment I read those words, I was out the door. I didn’t care how ridiculous it felt—I just **ran**.

My breath caught in my throat.

The carving was back.

That was the moment I knew—I had to leave.

My entire body was screaming at me to **run**, to get out, to put as much distance between me and this cursed place as possible. My hands trembled as I stuffed my belongings into my bag, my breath coming in short, panicked gasps. I didn’t care about being quiet. I didn’t care about anything except getting out.

But then—the last rule.

**Before leaving, sprinkle salt at the four corners of the house and never look back when you go.**

I hesitated, my mind racing. Did it even matter anymore? Would it make a difference? But I wasn’t about to take chances. My hands were numb as I grabbed the salt from the kitchen counter and rushed to each corner of the house, scattering it with quick, jerky movements. My legs felt weak, my chest tight with fear.

When I reached the front door, I exhaled sharply, gripping the handle. **Just open it. Just step outside.**

I twisted the knob.

Nothing.

I tried again, harder this time. The door didn’t move.

A sharp jolt of panic shot through me. I **yanked** at it, my breath hitching as I threw my weight against the wood. **It wouldn’t budge.**

Then—

I heard A sound behind me.

A soft, almost delicate **rustle**.

The hairs on my neck stood on end. Every part of me screamed **don’t turn around**. But I did.

And there it was.

The wooden carving.

Sitting **in the middle of the floor**, facing me.

My pulse pounded in my ears. I took a slow step backward, my mind trying to make sense of the impossible. I had **buried it**. I had followed the instructions. But now, here it was. **Waiting. Watching.**

Then the room shifted.

The walls seemed to **breathe**, warping and twisting, the corners stretching in ways they shouldn’t. My vision blurred as a heavy pressure settled over me, thick and suffocating. The air **hummed**, like something was waking up.

And then—

**The carving moved.**

At first, just a twitch. A slow, deliberate tilt of its head.

Then—

Its mouth **opened wider**.

Too wide. A gaping, unnatural void.

And then, a voice came from it.

**""You didn’t follow the rule...""** it said.

A cold hand clamped down on my shoulder.

I couldn’t move.

The touch burned like ice, freezing me in place. My breath hitched, my body locked in terror. The door—**the door suddenly burst open**—a rush of wind slamming against me.

I **tried** to run.

I lunged forward, desperate to escape, but something **pulled me backward**.

The walls **spun**. The room twisted around me. My screams echoed, swallowed by the air itself.

And then—

**Darkness.**

I don’t remember hitting the floor. I don’t remember what happened next.

I just woke up.

Morning light poured through the windows, painting the house in soft gold. For a moment, I thought it had all been a dream. But the cold sweat on my skin, the racing of my heart—it was **real**.

I didn’t waste a second.

I grabbed my bags and bolted for the door. This time, it opened with ease. The jungle outside was quiet, the world peaceful again.

But I **didn’t look back**.

Not once.

Leilani never explained the rules. I never asked.

And when I checked the Airbnb listing a few days later, it was gone.

**Like it had never existed.**

I wanted to forget. I **needed** to forget. But this morning—

A new email appeared in my inbox.

**From Leilani.**

1isv2yc,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1isv2yc/i_booked_an_airbnb_for_a_holiday_in_hawaii_there/,I Booked an Airbnb for a Holiday in Hawaii… There Are Strange RULES TO FOLLOW,"I never thought a simple vacation could go so wrong. In fact, when I planned this trip, I imagined nothing but peace—two nights away from the noise of everyday life, a chance to reset. I wasn’t looking for adventure, and I definitely wasn’t looking for trouble. But trouble has a way of finding you, especially when you least expect it.

I booked an Airbnb in Hawaii, a quiet little house nestled deep in the jungle. Nothing fancy, just a simple retreat surrounded by nature. The listing had beautiful photos—warm lighting, wooden interiors, lush greenery outside the windows. It looked perfect. Cozy, secluded, exactly what I needed. The host, a woman named Leilani, seemed friendly in her messages. She had tons of positive reviews, guests praising her hospitality and the house’s charm. It all felt safe, normal. I needed this escape, a break from everything. I had no idea that stepping into that house would be stepping into something I wasn’t prepared for.

The first sign that something was off came before I even arrived. I received an email with the subject line: **""Important: Rules for Your Stay (MUST READ).""**

At first, I barely glanced at it. Every Airbnb has rules—don’t smoke, don’t throw parties, clean up after yourself. I assumed this would be the same. But as I scrolled, my casual attitude faded. The list was long. Strangely long. And some of the rules made no sense.

* **Lock all doors at 9:00 PM sharp. Do not wait a second longer.**
* **If you hear any tapping or knocking between midnight and 3:00 AM, do not answer. Do not open the door. Do not look out the window.**
* **If you wake up to any sensation of being watched, do not move. Wait until you no longer feel it.**
* **Do not turn on the porch light after sunset.**
* **If you find any object in the house that wasn’t there when you arrived, do not touch it. Do not look directly at the carving. Email us immediately.**
* **Before leaving, sprinkle salt at the four corners of the house and never look back when you go.**

I stared at the list, rereading certain lines, trying to make sense of them. At first, I laughed. Maybe it was a joke? A weird local superstition? Some kind of tradition? The house was deep in the jungle, so maybe Leilani had reasons for these rules—something about wildlife, burglars, or just keeping the place in order. It felt strange, sure, but harmless.

I figured I’d follow them, if only out of respect. Besides, what was the worst that could happen?

But then the night began. And everything changed.

I arrived in the late afternoon, and the moment I stepped out of the car, I felt the quiet. Not the peaceful kind, but the kind that makes you hesitate. Still, the house was beautiful, even more so than the pictures had shown. Wooden beams stretched across the ceiling, the open windows let in a warm breeze, and beyond them, the jungle whispered with the rustling of leaves. The air was thick with humidity, carrying the scent of damp earth and blooming flowers. It was the kind of place that should have made me feel at ease. And at first, it did.

I unpacked slowly, placing my bag near the bed, my toiletries in the bathroom, my phone on the nightstand. Every movement felt strangely heavy, as if I were sinking into the house’s stillness. For a while, I just stood in the center of the room, absorbing it. The weight of silence. The weight of being alone. It was different from the usual solitude I craved—it wasn’t peace. It was something else.

Then, as the sun began to dip beyond the trees, the feeling grew stronger. The air inside the house felt... different. Thicker. As if the walls themselves were pressing in, waiting. I glanced at the clock.

**8:45 PM.**

The rule came back to me suddenly, uninvited. **Lock the doors at 9:00 PM sharp. Do not wait a second longer.**

I swallowed hard, shaking my head at my own nerves. It was just a precaution, right? Maybe the host had a reason—wild animals, or maybe just overly cautious house rules. Either way, I wasn’t about to test it. I double-checked the windows, shut the back door, and turned the lock on the front door at exactly 8:59 PM.

Settling onto the couch, I tried to shake the unease. Nothing had happened. Nothing would happen. I scrolled through my phone, let a movie play in the background, told myself I was just overthinking. And for a while, it worked. The night passed without incident.

Until I woke up to a sound that sent a chill straight through me.

**Knock. Knock. Knock.**

Three Knocks on The Front door.

Slow. Deliberate.

My breath caught in my throat. My body locked up. **If you hear any tapping or knocking between midnight and 3:00 AM, do not answer. Do not open the door.** The words from the email slammed into my head like an alarm. I clenched my jaw, forcing myself to stay still.

The knocking continued. Not frantic. Not demanding. Just... patient. **Knock. Knock. Knock.** A steady rhythm, like whoever—or whatever—stood on the other side knew I was awake. Knew I was listening.

I turned my head ever so slightly toward the nightstand. My phone’s screen glowed in the darkness. **12:42 AM.**

I held my breath.

And then—silence.

I waited. Five minutes. Ten. The air in the room felt wrong, like the quiet had thickened. My skin prickled, every nerve in my body screaming at me not to move. I squeezed my eyes shut, pretending to be asleep, pretending I hadn’t heard anything at all.

But I couldn’t sleep after that.

I lay there, stiff as a board, my mind cycling through possibilities. Was it really nothing? Some late-night visitor, lost in the jungle? A sick prank? My fingers itched to reach for my phone, to check the door, to **look**—but the rule stopped me.

So I stayed there. Frozen. Listening to the silence.

I didn’t sleep again until the first light of morning.

The second night, I woke up again—but this time, it wasn’t a sound that pulled me from my sleep. It was a feeling.

a feeling that Something was **there**.

I didn’t know how I knew it, but I did. I could feel it, standing just inches from my bed. Watching me.

My heart pounded in my chest, my breath coming in shallow gasps. I wanted to move, to **run**, but my body wouldn’t listen. I was completely frozen, paralyzed by the sheer wrongness of the moment. The air around me was thick and unmoving, as if the entire room had been drained of life. The walls, the ceiling, the bed—everything felt distant, unreal.

**If you wake up to any sensation of being watched, Do not move until it stops.**

The words from the rules echoed in my mind. I squeezed my eyes shut and forced myself to obey. Seconds stretched into eternity. My fingers twitched, desperate to grab the blanket, to shield myself from whatever was there. But I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe. I just **waited**.

Then, just like that, it was gone.

The air shifted, like a weight lifting from my chest. I sucked in a breath, feeling control return to my limbs. My heart was still hammering, but I could move again.

Shaky, unsteady, I forced myself out of bed. My legs felt weak, but I needed water. I needed to **do something**, anything, to break the tension.

I made my way to the kitchen, gripping the counter for support. The coolness of the tile beneath my feet grounded me, made me feel human again. But as I passed the living room, I saw something that made my stomach drop.

There was **something** on the coffee table.

A small wooden carving.

I stepped closer, my breath hitching. The figure was of a man—his face twisted, hollow eyes staring, mouth stretched unnaturally wide, as if frozen in an eternal, silent scream.

I knew, without a doubt, that it hadn’t been there before.

I had checked the house when I arrived. Every room, every shelf, every table. **This hadn’t been here.**

The rule came rushing back:

**If you find any object in the house that wasn’t there when you arrived, Do not touch it. Email us immediately.**

My hands trembled as I grabbed my phone. My fingers fumbled over the screen as I typed a message to Leilani, my breath uneven.

She replied almost instantly.

**""Do not touch it. Leave the house. Come back after sunrise, and when you return, do not look at the carving. Throw a towel over it, take it outside, bury it deep in the ground after sunset. Don’t ask questions.""**

I didn’t need convincing. The moment I read those words, I was out the door. I didn’t care how ridiculous it felt—I just **ran**.

I stayed away until the sun had fully risen. The jungle was eerily quiet when I returned, and my hands were still shaking as I **pushed** open the door.

The carving was still there.

I forced myself not to look at it directly. I grabbed a towel from the bathroom, draped it over the figure, and lifted it with careful, trembling hands. Even through the fabric, it felt **wrong**—too cold, too heavy for something so small.

I walked deep into the jungle after sunset, my heart hammering with every step. The trees loomed high above me, their shadows stretching through the thick darkness. I dug a hole as fast as I could, shoved the carving into the earth, and covered it with trembling hands.

I didn’t **ask questions**.

I didn’t **look back**.

I sprinted to the house, locking the door behind me. My chest rose and fell rapidly, my skin slick with sweat. I needed to sleep. I needed this night to be over.

But no sooner had I gone to bed, grabbed a blanket, and prepared to sleep than I heard a whisper.

It was so soft, so close, like a breath against my ear.

*""Look at me… You must look at me…"" it said.*

A chill ran down my spine.

I squeezed my eyes shut, gripping the blanket like a lifeline. The whispering continued, curling around me like smoke.

*""Look at me…"" it Continued.*

And then—stupidly, instinctively—

I turned my head toward the sound.

My breath caught in my throat.

The carving was back.

That was the moment I knew—I had to leave.

A cold hand clamped down on my shoulder.

I couldn’t move.

The touch burned like ice, freezing me in place. My breath hitched, my body locked in terror. The door—**the door suddenly burst open**—a rush of wind slamming against me.

I **tried** to run.

I lunged forward, desperate to escape, but something **pulled me backward**.

The walls **spun**. The room twisted around me. My screams echoed, swallowed by the air itself.

And then—

**Darkness.**

I don’t remember hitting the floor. I don’t remember what happened next.

I just woke up.

Morning light poured through the windows, painting the house in soft gold. For a moment, I thought it had all been a dream. But the cold sweat on my skin, the racing of my heart—it was **real**.

I didn’t waste a second.

I grabbed my bags and bolted for the door. This time, it opened with ease. The jungle outside was quiet, the world peaceful again.

But I **didn’t look back**.

Not once.

Leilani never explained the rules. I never asked.

And when I checked the Airbnb listing a few days later, it was gone.

**Like it had never existed.**

I wanted to forget. I **needed** to forget. But this morning—

A new email appeared in my inbox.

**From Leilani.**

We had a very very good conversation that ended up with us both connecting on a common topic she brought up before going to work where she said was this coffee shop. Are conversation continued to thrive in smiles giving our stories while her order was coming up. I couldn't stop thinking about this awesome conversation and the more I realized, the more amazing she came off and looked. After work I get off to go to the coffee shop and I realized wow she's very beautiful. I already go to the coffee shop to do writing but I never noticed her even though I soon discovered she's a manger. 


I wasn't in the intentions to seek someone this season let alone year and I may not have a good shot getting her number with  but how do I express my admiration for her and just want to talk with her? I don't want to get carried away but I just have this fascination with hearing her story and telling her how wonderful her presence is.

1isv13z,https://www.reddit.com/r/eczema/comments/1isv13z/fyi_about_eczema/,FYI about eczema,"
My last post seem to get well received so I figured I’d share some more insights!

1: if you work out or just plain sweat a lot and have eczema in your armpits or under your groin or wherever place on your body stays damp, it is most likely your body having a reaction to the bacteria that grows off your sweat so you should try using antifungal. It worked for me might work for you and showering may not help so don’t hop in every day and scrub until you are squeaky clean cause that will make it worse(I don’t even recommend showering every day I know eww but bite me I like to not scratch my skin off).

2: go see an immunologist because you could be allergic to anything from metal to fabric to coffee and while it might not be the most likely cause of your eczema, if it’s the case that you are allergic to something that you use every day that might just contribute heavily to your eczema.(GET BLOOD TEST NOT SCRATCH IF YOUR DOC DONT TELL U DIS GET A NEW ONE)

3: go see a rheumatologist they can tell you if you have any autoimmune diseases such as lupus that are causing your eczema and while someone would say having an actual autoimmune disease is worse I feel like it’s better know!

4: please keep in mind that you can throw on as much steroid cream or immuno suppressant cream as you want but if you don’t moisturize your eczema will come back 10 times as fast. Moisturize moisturize moisturize.! 

5:F**k ointments! I promise you if it’s oily and disgusting feeling when you put it on your skin it’s probably not good and in my case the steroid ointment they gave me actually made it worse because it just made my skin more irritated only ask for creams. Idk if we can curse on here but I want you see this so I do t wanna take the chance but seriously f**k ointment.

6: if you’re looking for a moisturizer, it’s probably not the best idea to get the one with 1000 different ingredients. I promise you the more is not the merrier. If it takes you a month to find a moisturizer that works for you that’s a month well spent.

1isuz30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ruleshorror/comments/1isuz30/i_booked_an_airbnb_for_a_holiday_in_hawaii_there/,I Booked an Airbnb for a Holiday in Hawaii… There Are Strange RULES TO FOLLOW,"I never thought a simple vacation could go so wrong. In fact, when I planned this trip, I imagined nothing but peace—two nights away from the noise of everyday life, a chance to reset. I wasn’t looking for adventure, and I definitely wasn’t looking for trouble. But trouble has a way of finding you, especially when you least expect it.

I booked an Airbnb in Hawaii, a quiet little house nestled deep in the jungle. Nothing fancy, just a simple retreat surrounded by nature. The listing had beautiful photos—warm lighting, wooden interiors, lush greenery outside the windows. It looked perfect. Cozy, secluded, exactly what I needed. The host, a woman named Leilani, seemed friendly in her messages. She had tons of positive reviews, guests praising her hospitality and the house’s charm. It all felt safe, normal. I needed this escape, a break from everything. I had no idea that stepping into that house would be stepping into something I wasn’t prepared for.

The first sign that something was off came before I even arrived. I received an email with the subject line: **""Important: Rules for Your Stay (MUST READ).""**

At first, I barely glanced at it. Every Airbnb has rules—don’t smoke, don’t throw parties, clean up after yourself. I assumed this would be the same. But as I scrolled, my casual attitude faded. The list was long. Strangely long. And some of the rules made no sense.

* **Lock all doors at 9:00 PM sharp. Do not wait a second longer.**
* **If you hear any tapping or knocking between midnight and 3:00 AM, do not answer. Do not open the door. Do not look out the window.**
* **If you wake up to any sensation of being watched, do not move. Wait until you no longer feel it.**
* **Do not turn on the porch light after sunset.**
* **If you find any object in the house that wasn’t there when you arrived, do not touch it. Do not look directly at the carving. Email us immediately.**
* **Before leaving, sprinkle salt at the four corners of the house and never look back when you go.**

I stared at the list, rereading certain lines, trying to make sense of them. At first, I laughed. Maybe it was a joke? A weird local superstition? Some kind of tradition? The house was deep in the jungle, so maybe Leilani had reasons for these rules—something about wildlife, burglars, or just keeping the place in order. It felt strange, sure, but harmless.

I figured I’d follow them, if only out of respect. Besides, what was the worst that could happen?

But then the night began. And everything changed.

I arrived in the late afternoon, and the moment I stepped out of the car, I felt the quiet. Not the peaceful kind, but the kind that makes you hesitate. Still, the house was beautiful, even more so than the pictures had shown. Wooden beams stretched across the ceiling, the open windows let in a warm breeze, and beyond them, the jungle whispered with the rustling of leaves. The air was thick with humidity, carrying the scent of damp earth and blooming flowers. It was the kind of place that should have made me feel at ease. And at first, it did.

I unpacked slowly, placing my bag near the bed, my toiletries in the bathroom, my phone on the nightstand. Every movement felt strangely heavy, as if I were sinking into the house’s stillness. For a while, I just stood in the center of the room, absorbing it. The weight of silence. The weight of being alone. It was different from the usual solitude I craved—it wasn’t peace. It was something else.

Then, as the sun began to dip beyond the trees, the feeling grew stronger. The air inside the house felt... different. Thicker. As if the walls themselves were pressing in, waiting. I glanced at the clock.

**8:45 PM.**

The rule came back to me suddenly, uninvited. **Lock the doors at 9:00 PM sharp. Do not wait a second longer.**

I swallowed hard, shaking my head at my own nerves. It was just a precaution, right? Maybe the host had a reason—wild animals, or maybe just overly cautious house rules. Either way, I wasn’t about to test it. I double-checked the windows, shut the back door, and turned the lock on the front door at exactly 8:59 PM.

Settling onto the couch, I tried to shake the unease. Nothing had happened. Nothing would happen. I scrolled through my phone, let a movie play in the background, told myself I was just overthinking. And for a while, it worked. The night passed without incident.

Until I woke up to a sound that sent a chill straight through me.

**Knock. Knock. Knock.**

Three Knocks on The Front door.

Slow. Deliberate.

My breath caught in my throat. My body locked up. **If you hear any tapping or knocking between midnight and 3:00 AM, do not answer. Do not open the door.** The words from the email slammed into my head like an alarm. I clenched my jaw, forcing myself to stay still.

The knocking continued. Not frantic. Not demanding. Just... patient. **Knock. Knock. Knock.** A steady rhythm, like whoever—or whatever—stood on the other side knew I was awake. Knew I was listening.

I turned my head ever so slightly toward the nightstand. My phone’s screen glowed in the darkness. **12:42 AM.**

I held my breath.

And then—silence.

I waited. Five minutes. Ten. The air in the room felt wrong, like the quiet had thickened. My skin prickled, every nerve in my body screaming at me not to move. I squeezed my eyes shut, pretending to be asleep, pretending I hadn’t heard anything at all.

But I couldn’t sleep after that.

I lay there, stiff as a board, my mind cycling through possibilities. Was it really nothing? Some late-night visitor, lost in the jungle? A sick prank? My fingers itched to reach for my phone, to check the door, to **look**—but the rule stopped me.

So I stayed there. Frozen. Listening to the silence.

I didn’t sleep again until the first light of morning.

The second night, I woke up again—but this time, it wasn’t a sound that pulled me from my sleep. It was a feeling.

a feeling that Something was **there**.

I didn’t know how I knew it, but I did. I could feel it, standing just inches from my bed. Watching me.

My heart pounded in my chest, my breath coming in shallow gasps. I wanted to move, to **run**, but my body wouldn’t listen. I was completely frozen, paralyzed by the sheer wrongness of the moment. The air around me was thick and unmoving, as if the entire room had been drained of life. The walls, the ceiling, the bed—everything felt distant, unreal.

**If you wake up to any sensation of being watched, Do not move until it stops.**

The words from the rules echoed in my mind. I squeezed my eyes shut and forced myself to obey. Seconds stretched into eternity. My fingers twitched, desperate to grab the blanket, to shield myself from whatever was there. But I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe. I just **waited**.

Then, just like that, it was gone.

The air shifted, like a weight lifting from my chest. I sucked in a breath, feeling control return to my limbs. My heart was still hammering, but I could move again.

Shaky, unsteady, I forced myself out of bed. My legs felt weak, but I needed water. I needed to **do something**, anything, to break the tension.

I made my way to the kitchen, gripping the counter for support. The coolness of the tile beneath my feet grounded me, made me feel human again. But as I passed the living room, I saw something that made my stomach drop.

There was **something** on the coffee table.

A small wooden carving.

I stepped closer, my breath hitching. The figure was of a man—his face twisted, hollow eyes staring, mouth stretched unnaturally wide, as if frozen in an eternal, silent scream.

I knew, without a doubt, that it hadn’t been there before.

I had checked the house when I arrived. Every room, every shelf, every table. **This hadn’t been here.**

The rule came rushing back:

**If you find any object in the house that wasn’t there when you arrived, Do not touch it. Email us immediately.**

My hands trembled as I grabbed my phone. My fingers fumbled over the screen as I typed a message to Leilani, my breath uneven.

She replied almost instantly.

**""Do not touch it. Leave the house. Come back after sunrise, and when you return, do not look at the carving. Throw a towel over it, take it outside, bury it deep in the ground after sunset. Don’t ask questions.""**

I didn’t need convincing. The moment I read those words, I was out the door. I didn’t care how ridiculous it felt—I just **ran**.

I stayed away until the sun had fully risen. The jungle was eerily quiet when I returned, and my hands were still shaking as I **pushed** open the door.

The carving was still there.

I forced myself not to look at it directly. I grabbed a towel from the bathroom, draped it over the figure, and lifted it with careful, trembling hands. Even through the fabric, it felt **wrong**—too cold, too heavy for something so small.

I walked deep into the jungle after sunset, my heart hammering with every step. The trees loomed high above me, their shadows stretching through the thick darkness. I dug a hole as fast as I could, shoved the carving into the earth, and covered it with trembling hands.

I didn’t **ask questions**.

I didn’t **look back**.

I sprinted to the house, locking the door behind me. My chest rose and fell rapidly, my skin slick with sweat. I needed to sleep. I needed this night to be over.

But no sooner had I gone to bed, grabbed a blanket, and prepared to sleep than I heard a whisper.

It was so soft, so close, like a breath against my ear.

*""Look at me… You must look at me…"" it said.*

A chill ran down my spine.

I squeezed my eyes shut, gripping the blanket like a lifeline. The whispering continued, curling around me like smoke.

*""Look at me…"" it Continued.*

And then—stupidly, instinctively—

I turned my head toward the sound.

My breath caught in my throat.

The carving was back.

That was the moment I knew—I had to leave.

My entire body was screaming at me to **run**, to get out, to put as much distance between me and this cursed place as possible. My hands trembled as I stuffed my belongings into my bag, my breath coming in short, panicked gasps. I didn’t care about being quiet. I didn’t care about anything except getting out.

But then—the last rule.

**Before leaving, sprinkle salt at the four corners of the house and never look back when you go.**

I hesitated, my mind racing. Did it even matter anymore? Would it make a difference? But I wasn’t about to take chances. My hands were numb as I grabbed the salt from the kitchen counter and rushed to each corner of the house, scattering it with quick, jerky movements. My legs felt weak, my chest tight with fear.

When I reached the front door, I exhaled sharply, gripping the handle. **Just open it. Just step outside.**

I twisted the knob.

Nothing.

I tried again, harder this time. The door didn’t move.

A sharp jolt of panic shot through me. I **yanked** at it, my breath hitching as I threw my weight against the wood. **It wouldn’t budge.**

Then—

I heard A sound behind me.

A soft, almost delicate **rustle**.

The hairs on my neck stood on end. Every part of me screamed **don’t turn around**. But I did.

And there it was.

The wooden carving.

Sitting **in the middle of the floor**, facing me.

My pulse pounded in my ears. I took a slow step backward, my mind trying to make sense of the impossible. I had **buried it**. I had followed the instructions. But now, here it was. **Waiting. Watching.**

Then the room shifted.

The walls seemed to **breathe**, warping and twisting, the corners stretching in ways they shouldn’t. My vision blurred as a heavy pressure settled over me, thick and suffocating. The air **hummed**, like something was waking up.

And then—

**The carving moved.**

At first, just a twitch. A slow, deliberate tilt of its head.

Then—

Its mouth **opened wider**.

Too wide. A gaping, unnatural void.

And then, a voice came from it.

**""You didn’t follow the rule...""** it said.

A cold hand clamped down on my shoulder.

I couldn’t move.

The touch burned like ice, freezing me in place. My breath hitched, my body locked in terror. The door—**the door suddenly burst open**—a rush of wind slamming against me.

I **tried** to run.

I lunged forward, desperate to escape, but something **pulled me backward**.

The walls **spun**. The room twisted around me. My screams echoed, swallowed by the air itself.

And then—

**Darkness.**

I don’t remember hitting the floor. I don’t remember what happened next.

I didn't know that that was, in modern dating terms, a 'date', and that having coffee or tea counted as a date. One of those people actually stalked me to my coffee hangout and invited me again later, choosing to sit in the same spot- I thought it was just a coincidence that I saw her in the shop, and I'm sitting on the table again. It must be the culture. Nope. 

My workplace also offered Starbucks vouchers as incentives for doing well. There were gift cards for other things like electronics, but seeing as I didn't need anything from those stores, I got Starbucks and enjoyed trying out different drinks- but mostly tea. 

Somehow that became a rumor that I liked to drink coffee like the assistant manager- who was a drug addict. I had a classmate in Year 10 who drank coffee like he did- multiple shots of coffee and it wasn't enough. I did not know that was actually a huge red flag and that coffee acted as a substitute for many addicts. 

I returned to my home country, and people kept inviting me to get coffee with them and talked about coffee as if I'd be interested in joining in. I was bamboozled at first. What part of me looks like I drink coffee? Then they look at me all confused when I turn down their offer- you didn't even bother to get to know me and tried to form a relationship with me based on what you've read or heard from someone else. 

At a share house, one of the roommates were overly protective with their coffee machine- chill, I don't drink coffee, your coffee machine is safe. 

Furthermore, I've never been on a date, but going out for coffee sounds like a terrible date- especially if you don't know the person. How are you going to be able to communicate well while smelling coffee and having coffee breath? I wouldn't even ask my own friends out for coffee to hangout.

It's a bit futile because I have maybe 40g max left of this coffee but I've been quite disappointed that I've not been able to unlock yet another Dak coffee. Don't seem to have much luck with this company but it surely must be something I'm doing.

Below, I've given a breakdown of everything I've tried, thus far.

Pre-rinse paper filter and mug with hot water

Water - tap water

Temp 93-96C

Grind 3-4 (fellow Ode Gen 1 stock burr)

Ratio: 1:15, 1:15.5, 1:16, 1:16.67

Grams of coffee: 18-20g - better luck with 20g

Hoffman recipe - bloom 36-40g, wait 45 secs-1 min, pour 150-170g, final pour brings total water weight to 270-320g

Technique - spiral pour for all 3 pours, spiral pour for bloom only followed by two centre-only pours. Centre-only pours for all 3 pours. Pour height - just a bit above the V60, maybe 1-3 inches above

Quirk -  For 18g, I brew directly into the cup I'm drinking out of. 18g is the max my cup can hold. For 20g, I brew into the default Hario server that came with the set. Sucks for heat retention. 

Typical results: bland, bitter, slightly watery with zero tasting notes. Occasional silkiness at the beginning when doing as centre-only pours, that tapers quickly into bitterness.

Best recipe so far, 96C, Grind size 3, 1:15, centre pour only for all 3 pours.

He was married for about ten years and has been divorced for about a year. He has two kids, and I’m meeting them in two weeks, which I’m super excited about! Overall, we communicate well, get along great, and our relationship has been really positive—except for one thing that’s starting to weigh on me.

I feel like I’m constantly being compared to his ex-wife, both by his friends and especially by him. The comparisons are always meant as compliments, which makes it harder to bring up. For example:
	•	“Ex would never do something like that, it’s amazing to have you.”
	•	“I wanted so badly to feel a certain way about this song with Ex, but I never did. I’m so happy I can feel that with you.”
	•	Today, we were talking about his daughter going to therapy, and he said, “Ex and I went to therapy, and that was the best our relationship ever was. Our communication is so good I couldn’t picture us ever needing that.”
	•	Even his friends do it. One told me, “I always wanted to ask Ex to go out for coffee, and she’d always say yes but never actually go. It’s cool that you actually want to build a relationship with me.”

I get that he was with her for a decade, and she’s his only reference point for a serious relationship. At first, I was really understanding because I know it’s a huge adjustment for him. I also think talking about past relationships in a healthy way is totally fine. But it happens almost daily, and it’s starting to make me feel like I’m not being seen for myself, just as “better than his ex.”

I don’t want to resent her, compare myself to her, or feel like my worth is tied to how I measure up against her. I also want to have a positive and healthy relationship with everyone involved, especially for the sake of his kids and maintaining a healthy co-parenting dynamic between all of us. But at this point, it’s really starting to bother me.

How would you guys handle this? Is this something that will naturally fade with time, or is it worth bringing up now? If I do bring it up, how do I do it in a way that doesn’t make him feel like I’m attacking him? Would love to hear any advice or similar experiences.

TL;DR: My boyfriend (31M) of 5 months constantly compares me to his ex-wife—always as a compliment, but it happens daily. It’s making me feel like I’m being valued in comparison to her rather than for who I am. I want a healthy co-parenting dynamic for the kids, not resentment. Should I bring it up or let it fade?

The biggest blocker is that my wife has become adamant that the TV console and coffee table match exactly. Since there’s no way other to guarantee that, this means we probably have to get a matched set. 

Yes, I know the trend right now is to not get matched furniture. No, shades that are close are not good enough. This has become non-negotiable. I suggested that we get black furniture so we can be sure it matches, and she’s worried they “won’t be the same black.” She also doesn’t like glass or metal. They must both be wood, and the wood must be the exact same color. 

This would be okay, but we have two other (more practical, IMO) must-haves:
- The coffee table must have wheels, or be light enough for one of us to easily move alone. We’ll move it out of the way 3x a week to do yoga.

- The coffee table can’t be bigger than 48” long. Bigger than that, and it’s longer than the couch.

- We eat on the couch most lunches, so practically speaking, a rectangle is the best shape.

He's at table next to me in a crowded coffee house, not much I can do but eavesdrop. Which, red flag, this is this meeting place advisor chose choice to discuss sensitive financial topics with a potential client. 

Then he dives into insurance pitch. Ooooohhhhkaaay.

Then he tells potential guy that he needs to generate more revenue. AND PITCHES TO HIS POTENTIAL CLIENT TO JOIN HIM IN SELLING FINCIAL ADVICE TO ***HIS*** FRIENDS AND FAMILY.

1isuuiu,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1isuuiu/i_love_being_autistic/,I love being autistic,"I really like being autistic. And I don't mean it in the sense of the diagnosis, the paperwork or anything else. I mean it in the way that my brain works.

I am very sensitive to many things, like touch textures, the materials of things, clothing, food textures, smells (lingering or long lasting smells), the way my food is prepared, the exact amount of ingredients and the level to which it's cooked. I'm sensitive to the time of the day when I have to do things, and I am very affected by sudden plans or obligations.

When I used to live in a place where I had no freedom or control over things, all of that would be a source of distress. Being forced to deal with clothes I hated, having to eat food that I didn't like, being always worried about how moldy or dirty things in the fridge would get aroudn my food. They wouldn't buy the correct type of milk, or they would change the brand of cereal without asking.

\----------------------------------------------------------------

But then I moved out and went to live with my now roommate, who is also autistic.

We made sure to create a life and a world according to how **\*we\*** want to live. We have lots of fluffy things, because I like how they feel. We have lots of colorful things, because she likes colors.

We buy the correct type of cereal, and discuss about why we choose each particular brand of cocoa, and compare the taste of all the types we can find until we find the best one for us.

We try to remember each other's preferences in food, and if we forget **\*we ask\*** the other. *Was it a lot of sugar, or a bit of sugar with this particualr flavor? Do you prefer chocolate or coffee with this cake?*

I spend hours researching the best kind of blender we can buy to get the best smoothies. She learns about fabrics and threads and clothes. I pick the oven with alot of excitement. She picks the pots and kettles we will use. We collect and share mugs.

We don't go out of our home unless we want to go out, and we don't accept plans unless we are given several days of avance notice.

\----------------------------------------------------------------

I was thinking all of this because of a post I replied to yesterday, where I said that I love how much I care about things that others would find inconsequential.

""I care and pay a lot of attention to all the details that non-autistics don't notice at all. I know the patterns of the spiders that live with me. I can communicate really well with most mammals. I live with a lot of plushies that are as important as a pet or family member for me. I know the difference between a quarter teaspoon of sugar in my cold choco milk and a half spoon. I notice the vibration of the elevators in my building. I feel the wind and humidity in the air to predict rain. I can tell the difference between cooking bread with butter or lard, and putting the butter early or late in the process.​""



I really feel grateful that I have a brain that can focus, no, that HAS to focus on so many details all the time. Every single thing becomes a really big deal with me. And that is great, when every little thing is good.

There's a lot more I would like to say, but this is probably enough to show what I mean. **Because** I am autistic is that I can enjoy all the details in life that others wouldn't care at all about.

  
\----------------------------------------------------------------

I know that being autistic comes with a lot of disabilities and other difficulties. I have some of those as well. And I know that many have very very bad difficulties, or others don't have the possibility of shaping hteir own world to fit them.

But I also know that there are some who have good families, and don't suffer abuse. Some that have good amounts of support and are able to face life with less difficulties.

I'm not in either of those groups (I'm not gonna get into it today), but let's not forget or invalidate either side. Autism doesn't have to suck, and most of the time it's not even autism's fault. It's either non autistic people making it hard for us with no reason, or it's other comorbidities like depression. Or sometimes, having unhealthy expectations for what 'life', 'success' or 'happiness' have to include. I am open to share my point of view on these things as well!



But autism is the reason I can have a happy life, and for many of us that possibility has always been there, but nobody told us. So let's also share the good side, all the reasons to be proud of being autistic!",15,1739932807.0,autism,5,1.0,False

My name is Jacob! I’m planning to move from Virginia to NYC this autumn to attend school at John Jay school of criminal Justice in Midtown. I have so many questions and really need some help. 

After visiting the city for the past 2 days, I’ve absolutely fallen in love with it and am really eager to move here. My two favorite spots have to be Armore Pizza on the corner of W 58th and 9th and Dark Matter Coffee on the east side. Both the guys there gave me some advice but I’m still looking for a bit more. 

1) How far of a commute is too far of a commute and is it worth living in the outer Burroughs and commuting an hour or more into the city proper once or twice a week for school? 

2) obviously it’s a huge city, but where do I meet people? I’ve always been a loner but moving into this city, I feel like I should always walk with at least one other person. Where would you recommend I go to meet and interact with new friendly faces? 

3) How the hell am I supposed to afford midtown/manhattan housing without dropping ≈10k a semester? Is there more affordable apartments that I’m missing in the $800-1000 a month range? 

4) moving into the city from out of state, what are some of the biggest things I’ll need to adjust to? And what should I be prepared for?

it seems like every program i would have to go down in dose or pay over 400 dollars to start at 7.5. Why? can't I just upload my script and start there? I understand 7.5 costs more. Can anyone give me a recommendation for somewhere I can start at 7.5 and the BUD is extended so I can stock up?

Long story short I also grew up being an athlete and I fear what this crap is doing to me as I age. Plus it’s a waste of money and just generally stupid (sitting around breathing flavoured air lol)

I feel your warmth when I take my first sip of coffee in the morning, so warm and sweet.

You occupy all of my mind, while doing the mundane, when I’m driving to work, or just staring out the window, I’m thinking of you. I taste you every-time I cook my favorite meal and I wonder what it would be like to share it with you. When I take a shower I close my eyes and pretend you’re there with me.

Am I delusional or does this feeling go both ways? Do you also wonder about me? Do you also crave my touch, my voice, my love?
Please tell me because I can’t bear it anymore, I know you said we can’t be more than friends but then why do I get this funny feeling you wanted more too? Am I so stupid? Am I so wrong to want this? Because I’ve never wanted anything more in my entire life.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

They have been looking for a manager because the previous one retired last month, even though Ive been here for 2 years I dont want to become it because Im not that knowledgeable about being lead and didnt have proper training. Plus I do online college. Ever since she left tho Ive been having problems with my team

They’re pretty new, 5 baristas. Second to me got hired 6 months ago and last hire came 2 months ago, all no experience. They’re all certified now, but with my manager gone Im running into a bit of problems sorta like regression. 

It all started last inventory I did, where we had a troublesome sales:purchase ratio. it was low which is concerning. The purchases being high where the sales is low. And those following days I reviewed our customer connection being at 20% score 🙁

So I took an initiative to investigate because this regression is pretty worrisome. I did things like took on more mid shifts so i can work with morning and night people, came in on my off days to spy, called the phone to make sure they were cleaning, telling other dept supervisors to comment if they were doing nothing or the lobby/seating was dirty. 

And now after that, I am honestly so over it.

Before I start, my manager let people get one grande drink for free  (Store policy says we have to pay for items) but we have to pay for food.

I found out recently, some baristas were taking eod food home ( before close).

Closers were seen taking full trays of drinks home, and bags of anything

A barista was under pricing drinks for his friends, giving away free drinks to other store associates even for discounts. Infront of me he charged for an ice water, but gave a venti strawberry acai lemonade to a online shopper. 

Customers were coming back during my shift with complaints of bad service, nonchalantness, old coffee, previous day drinks. 

Supervisors and other managers telling me that the seating area is often dirty with baristas doing nothing. 

I got with another department manager to view cam footage and what the fuck. THEYRE ON THEIR PHONES AT TIMES WHEN TASKS NEED TO BE DONE WTFFF 

And it killed me not to say anything to the store director and my OP because If they got fired I couldnt handle having to work 15 hour shifts everyday to rebuild my team of new hires. Me and my manager went thru it because my store director was being too cheep to hire someone in time. 

Last Sunday I had a meeting, about it. Deadnamed everyone and the issued that followed each of them. I did it in a polite manner to where I wasn’t aggressive. I told them straight up what would happen and how I need them to be better. It seemed like I spooked them. Theyve been a bit better this week. 

I contacted my old manager and she told me tell the Store director. Most likely they be fired over theft along with the other associated who got freebies. And I would have to work 40+ hours, but I would have support from employees from Other stores. Im not sure what thats called.

1isufzp,https://www.reddit.com/r/chinalife/comments/1isufzp/weird_thing_i_saw_in_cq/,Weird thing I saw in CQ,"I was having a coffee in Chongqing central square in one of the malls, where you can see the big clock tower, around 6pm.

A group of people arrived, a man and a woman opened a backpack and took a big flag of China and started waving it and walking in circles around the monument. A couple of minutes after some police started following them (it would have been faster going in the other direction than following them but i digress...). When they reached them they stopped them and obviously told them not to do whatever they were doing. Mind you: they were just walking and waving the Chinese flag.

The woman threw a tantrum and starting waving flag even more aggressively, police tried to follow her but she was walking fast. After half a turn her male friend reached her and talked her out of it. Then she proceeded to show her respects to the monument (kind of bowing to it) and then put the flag back.

Then they rejoined their group, started taking selfies and at some point a woman sellikg touristic trips information came and they casually went away.

I couldn't understand what the heck she was doing, and also why the police had to try to stop her waving the Chinese flag. Any ideas?",3,1739931643.0,chinalife,7,1.0,False
1isufoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1isufoo/left_her_for_her_own_good_or_so_i_think/,Left her for her own good. (Or so I think),"This is a fast paced story, in this side you have me:

>Finally getting over his ex, after years
>Open to try new things
>Scared of new relationships but willing to commit to someone.
>Someone who deeply cares to not make mistakes from the past, trying to be responsable with his new partners.

Then, you have her: 

>Insecure, gets high hopes about me really easy
>She doesn't love herself
>Not an experienced lover (thinks more in her benefit rather than both of us)
>But she loved me like a child, purely, intensely, she tought I was perfect

Total duration of the ""relationship"": 3 weeks 

Since the beginning I was clear to her, ""Don't get too excited about me, I'm not looking to hurt you, but don't expect me to get into a relationship too quickly, I need my time"" 

She agreed, but couldn't control her feelings, by one week she was completely obsessed, and in my attempt to not hurt her and be responsible, I left myself loose, I thought. ""And what's so scary about a relationship anyways?, she's completely into me, maybe I should fall for her too, she deserves it.""

I had my doubts during this 3 long weeks, but I left them aside in the name of love, in the name of giving her what I think she deserved (a true love), because the way she was into me, was really magical, thought it was a gift from God himself.

But then disaster struck, I've been cheated before, and that's a trauma, a weakness of mine, this Saturday she went to a coffee shop with a guy and a friend who was a woman, all day, no messages, no way to contact her until the night. She texts, everything ""fine"", no further explanations, but then she can't stop herself from telling me how much she likes me, how much she missed me, then, the guilt:

""My friend didn't come, I was with the guy the entire time, but don't misunderstand this, I didn't anything with him""

I was upset, heartbroken, and I fell from the clouds, couldn't see her with love eyes anymore. Then realized, dude, it was only 3 weeks!, I don't know who she is, but I'm thinking of her as my girlfriend already, and she does the same thing with me.

So I did the sane thing and got myself apart from her, but then she tried to manipulate me and showed that in her insecurity she was already filling emotional holes with my love. 

""Don't do this, don't leave me, I need you, I'll never meet someone like you again, you are all I have"" 

And man, only 3 weeks but I was willing to take it very far, I confess I'm in love with her, but those red flags I mentioned earlier... As a experienced man I know is not any good to stay there, but... I really want to. Even if it is irrational and stupid 

That's why I think I left her for her own good, because she has demonstrated her love in a very beautiful way, but is not sane, not for me, not for her too, once her illusion broke, and her insecurities kicked in, we would've been in a lot of trouble

But I want to comeback (I know I must stand my ground, is the most sane and responsible thing to do), I want to be there, I feel guilty, and I miss her very much... Too fast, too intense, f*k ",1,1739931619.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

My usual routine is to get up early, take a phentermine and head to the gym. I am assuming I will not need the phentermine while using clen, should I just spray some clen under my tongue before the gym? Can you drink coffee while using clen and are there any medications I should stay away from while using it? I just want to make sure I am doing everything correctly.
