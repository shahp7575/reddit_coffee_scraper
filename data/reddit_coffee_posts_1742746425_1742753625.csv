1ji5n8k,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ji5n8k,What did you think of the fight between Leon and Krauser in the remake?,"In the Remake, not only the relationship between the two was changed but also the weight of their fight.

In the original, Leon only fought against Krauser to defeat his former partner and continue with his mission.

In Remake things are different. Leon fights Krauser because he is his mentor. Your master. He trained him for at least over a year. 
But he became corrupt and fell into disgrace after the Javier operation. And to make matters worse, he killed Luis, Leon's best friend, previously.
Krauser used the plague to transform.

Losing both his arms. This shows how insane Krauser was. So desperate for power that he sacrificed both his arms and his ability to live a normal life. (imagine Krauser trying to drink a coffee with his arms like that. Or trying to clean himself) everything to gain power and stay above everything and everyone. And Leon, seeing this, cannot allow this to continue.

Leon needs to defeat his mentor to avenge Luis and continue his mission. But he also does this to free his mentor from this misfortune and return him to who he was before.

What did you think of this? I found it quite developed and epic.",1,1742753513.0,residentevil4,0,1.0,False

i'm from NYC and i live in Buffalo so i don't really get to see amazing views like this. i've traveled to many different states and one (1) country but i've never seen anything like this. so many palm trees!

i made (and deleted cuz i didnt want my bf to see hehe) a post here about what to see and do there. i went to riverside, valencia gardens, colton heights and more. sadly i caught a nasty cold and a bad headache so i couldn't go to all the places that were suggested by others. i went to carolyn's cafe and had a coffee cake, it was very good! i even went to redlands galleria.

there are many nice people in redlands. i've had plenty of wonderful conversations with strangers there.

i plan to return soon and hopefully redlands can become my home away from home. until then, stay mountainy",1,1742753460.0,Redlands,0,1.0,False
1ji5m8u,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ji5m8u,Reds! ‚ù§Ô∏è + an old b&w outfit // 1940s-inspired challenge,"Clearly, I‚Äôm making up for the lack of red in my fire-inspired challenge entry haha. But seriously though, I‚Äôm weirdly in love with this outfit, and it‚Äôs mostly because of how abundant and bright the reds are. I‚Äôve wanted a sailor-collared piece of clothing for years, but I wasn‚Äôt sure how to incorporate it into my wardrobe‚ÄîI‚Äôm not big on blues, and it‚Äôs the most common color palette in this case (obviously). So when I found this red dress with the pink collar at a vintage store, I grabbed it immediately. Sailor-style clothing became increasingly popular in the 1940s, so I thought it‚Äôd be appropriate. I had to add some ‚Äúedgy‚Äù elements to avoid coming off as too sweet (let‚Äôs pretend my bandaid is part of the look, I didn‚Äôt have a beige one).


Funny enough, this era is not one of my favorites fashion-wise, and yet it‚Äôs the second time I‚Äôve found myself doing a 1940s-inspired look and really enjoying it. The first time was back in 2023 when I went to the Oppenheimer premiere (yes, I took part in the Barbenheimer shenanigans). I liked that outfit too, though not as much as the new one. I included it in the carousel because they‚Äôre very different despite working with the same theme, and it‚Äôs fun to see them next to each other.",3,1742753445.0,RitaFourEssenceSystem,0,1.0,False
1ji5m0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/JetLagTheGame/comments/1ji5m0b/jetlag_the_homegame_nl_fan_edition/,Jetlag the homegame NL fan edition!,"I posted here in December to find a group of fans to play the homegame with. Last weekend was finally the time we got to try it out!

This is a (very) long report out, scroll down all the way to the bottom for our conclusions for making it even better for a next time/tips for other groups playing in NL. 



We were 6people and divided in groups of 2, unfortunately the flu season cursed Mattheas, so Coen had to tackle hiding alone with online support.

We played the medium game, so we had 1h hiding time.

We met at Utrecht Centraal at 8:30 to meet and arrange the final things (NS subscription activation completed at 8:58).

[Meeting for the first time & getting ready at 9am!](https://preview.redd.it/mtjmttqkchqe1.png?width=886&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9c2e95a048de4380c468bfcfbc89ccc35f2df3e)

**Day 1: Alex & Jan**

At 9am it was time to Go Go Go! Alex & Jan ran through the gates and Maki, Coen & Christel grabbed coffee to strategize the first questions. The first question asked: are you in the same Nuts region as us? This comprised Holland and Utrecht and was a hit!

The seekers jumped on a train towards Schiphol and while they went that way asked the second question: the tallest building from the station, to get a vibe of the place. Amsterdam and all its stations were still in play and the picture was quite rural looking so we were able to cross these off.

[Tallest building from the station](https://preview.redd.it/aaz8yrtw1fqe1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=b820118daf177ef3713172cffded0c67028c7aac)

On the train the seekers started a thermometer in the last part of the journey, from the tracks above Nieuwe Meer to Schiphol station. This was hotter and thus divided the map in a way that the seekers knew to take a train up and didn‚Äôt have to continue on towards Leiden/Rotterdam.

At Schiphol the seekers stopped for some research, but before they could ask another question were hit with Curse of the Cairns‚Ä¶ Good play as this is impossible to complete at a transit hub like Schiphol Airport‚Ä¶The seekers did soon after find the exact station the hiders were at due to a picture in google maps from a postbox. Unfortunately the half-hourly train had just left so the seekers went to the snackzone while they waited for the next one.

When the seekers arrived at Weesp station, they first went to confirm the picture and yes, the house, and postbox, were definitely there! Next  the curse was cleared as the endgame area was large so clarifying questions were needed.They asked for a picture of the tallest structure in the hiders sightline, unfortunate for the hiders, their whole neighbourhood had the same windows and the seekers recognised the neighbourhood from when they were clearing the curse. 

[Tallest structure in seekers sightline](https://preview.redd.it/egomy5s32fqe1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=18a2d4b72d4cef1407e15f10928384bb2fd2db60)

The hiders did a last ditch effort playing the Curse of the Mediocre Travel Agent but it was not needed to ask more questions. Within 10minutes the hiders were found hiding in a small soccerfield.

Time 2h10m +9m time bonus for a total of 2h19m!

**Day 1: Coen**

While Coen went to hide the seekers realized they really needed printed maps to draw lines/circles and cross of stations, so they went to a local copy shop to print A3 maps of NL incl rail network (tip: the Prorail map!)

During the strategizing the seekers decided they wanted to cut the map again in the dense Amsterdam area on one end and the more sparse rest of the country. A thermometer was started in Diemen ending at Amsterdam Centraal. This was hotter!

While at Amsterdam they asked if they were in the same province: Noord Holland. This was a hit! The seekers also asked for a picture of the tallest building from the station again, to get the vibe of the place and do some research while on trains. 

[Tallest building from the station](https://preview.redd.it/wqxlcws82fqe1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=19e4aa0aafac4e18dfea82ead0758b7905fb4982)

The hider send a Curse of the Urban Explorer while the seekers were traveling to Amsterdam Sloterdijk as they wanted to ask the same transit line question, but due to the curse could no longer ask any questions while on transit. This lead to the seekers choosing another thermometer while walking 0,5miles south-west instead. This was colder.

Again the picture was the breakthrough with the limited stations left. The Netherlands has Many non-streetview pictures in google maps‚Ä¶

The seekers headed up to Castricum and when they arrived confirmed again the building before proceeding to ask for a selfie! This helped but didn‚Äôt narrow it down exactly. They then also asked to trace the nearest street. This question turns out quite hard to answer logically for the hider üòÇ  The hider was finally found in a little corner of a parking garage entrance!

[Selfie of hider](https://preview.redd.it/jh70loet2fqe1.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fd1f99471ed9c2c683dff1790eda3aaf06228b4)

Time: 2h41m +9m time bonus for total of 2h50m

**Day 1: Maki & Christel**

Next up were Maki & Christel, who had very limited options due to the region being quite sparse and a big chunk of the hiding time being wasted on bad train schedules.

The seekers realized there were pretty much 3 lines the hiders could be on and started off very well with the same transit line question where they took the sprinter at Castricum from Alkmaar towards Amsterdam Centraal, this was a hit!

Next the tallest building question was asked again, this question turned out to be much too overpowered, as again the seekers were able to deduce the station, even when the hiders put a lot of effort in choosing the station around the building question.

[Tallest building from station](https://preview.redd.it/onrfshhd3fqe1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=5600da53f36be027d4785fddc5a08d008f3a9959)

The hiders hit the seekers with the Curse of the Tumble. The seekers cleared this on the platform of Haarlem station, unfortunately not without chipping one of the red dice, 100ft is quite far!

Once the curse was cleared the seekers asked if the nearest museum of the hiders was the same was theirs: museum van de geest, this was not the case. While starting to look around the area away from the museum the seekers asked for a picture of the highest structure in the hiders sight.

[Tallest structure in hider's sightline](https://preview.redd.it/wsq5dxmh3fqe1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0487f52d46d9948ac3e0bfe277e22bcaf9579c7)

The hiders pulled curse of the ransom note and in a last ditch effort to slow the seekers down teared up their printed maps and cookie wrappers. With succes as this lead to the seekers to search for a long time before clearing the curse and asking another question. 

[\\""Ransom Note\\""](https://preview.redd.it/2qxi0hlj3fqe1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=a688a459af7b7b64cfa116fd43ecff958d4fba69)

The seekers literally searched every street, but didn‚Äôt realize they skipped exactly one. After clearing the curse they asked to draw the street shape. By this time the game day was ending, convinced about being in the endgame (but not having confirmed it) the seekers requested a game day extension. After their request they quickly found the hiders, which had been sitting on the (by this time (>7pm) cold) floor behind a car. 

[Ransom Note  \\""can you send street shape?\\""](https://preview.redd.it/lsoegmgl3fqe1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf79647d833571568da4cf556af6f6663810d481)

Hiding time: 2h10m +12m time bonus for a total of 2h22m! 1h20m of this time was spend in the endgame!

**Day 1: Changes for Day 2**

We decided it would logistically make more sense to restart the next day from Utrecht, especially as we had perfectly finished a full round. We also decided that the tallest building from the station question was much to overpowered.

We eventually settled on only allowing to view the first pictures that show up when you click on something, no scrolling, as we think this is more within the spirit of how the game was designed.

**Day 2: Maki & Christel**

The next morning Maki & Christel started before the others at 8:30 right outside Utrecht Centraal. They had been allowed to strategize individually like the first group had in day 1 but not allowed to discuss it.

[It's 8:30 and it's time to Go Go Go!](https://preview.redd.it/2wde4xccchqe1.png?width=1183&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bc95e183702f597b0dbba983e3c8d625fb6b1a3)

An hour later the others regrouped also at Utrecht and started of with a matching question; are you closer or further from the nearest coastline (26.71miles). (Note: we had decided the Ijselmeer & Markermeer counted as coastline beforehand). The seekers proceeded to travel south, as most of the north-west was crossed off now. While on the train towards ‚Äòs ‚Äòs-Hertogenbosch (with several jokes about the JL boys‚Äô pronunciation) they asked if the hiders were in the same Nuts region (comprised of Gelderland, Overijssel & Drenthe). The hiders were not.

While on the same train, but further south the Seekers asked if they were in the same province, Noord Brabant. Again the hiders were not!

Due to the Sunday schedule being a little more sparse than Saturday, there were already not many stations left that could‚Äôve been reached.

1 line near where the seekers were, as well as a few stations in the Rotterdam area. The seekers requested a photo of the widest street in their zone. This was relatively small street.

[Picture of the widest street](https://preview.redd.it/8tw4tsbtahqe1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=aee0ed09e7290bbad2c188fdaa9b638a64c22355)

The seekers traveled to Geldermalsen while researching.

While on the train to Geldermalsen the hiders hit the seekers with the Curse of the Luxury car, with a picture of a Ram 1500 for an initial sales price of 88k.Once off the train in Geldermalsen the seekers got double cursed with also the Curse of the Zoologist, with a picture of a bird.

The latter curse was quickly cleared, looking up they immediately snatched a picture of two flying birds. The car caused more troubles and they were unable to clear it before the hourly train left. They did decide to get on it, with the limited stations left, based on the rural widest street they thought the hiders were in the small town or Arkel, this was not 100% confirmed so taking the hourly train was a risk, but it would take them roughly  into the right direction either way.

At 11:28, when the train was in sight of Arkel station, the hiders hit the almighty Move card! And while the seekers got of the train, the hiders got on that very same train. A small wave and the seekers were stuck waiting for 20minutes of new hiding time.

https://preview.redd.it/044a65a0bhqe1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c6560325fc9f0d608e634fe6cb656ca85890a09

There was some discussion about whether the new 20min hiding time included or excluded 11:48 as there were only three stations and the last had a scheduled arrival time of exactly that. The hiders wanted to include it but texted it ended up not mattering as the train was delayed so they couldn‚Äôt take it all the way there anymore anyway.

Pictures of the hiders‚Äô time in the region were shared and while stuck in Arkel for an hour for the next train the Seekers recreated all the pictures, found the exact car from the curse (and a more expensive Range Rover sport for 140k) and had as good of a time you can have in the 3 streets of the Arkel zone.

The first question asked after the curse was cleared was a 3mile radius from Arkel station. This was a miss, the hiders were not within 3miles of Arkel station.

https://preview.redd.it/rz4zy4l2bhqe1.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=cce3cf1f86d4479c1c1bb38155122f5a25ca92f8

The seekers proceeded to travel to Boven-Hardinxveld, while on the train they realized they may have made a gross mistake and wanted to confirm the hiders were here by asking a half mile radius. This was a miss. The seekers had missed that while Gorinchem station was within 3miles, not the full zone of Gorinchem was within 3miles of Arkel.

Upon arrival at Gorinchem the street shape trace was requested. After getting the picture back they quickly proceeded to find the hiders chilling in the high grass in the sun!

[Traced nearest street shape](https://preview.redd.it/hwowsec4bhqe1.png?width=938&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b0774800365ef33ab8ac3ab230e5ef7db74524d)

Time: 3h53m -20m hiding time + 27m time bonus for a total time of exactly 4h0m!

**Day 2: Alex & Coen**

Alex & Coen were hiding together next. Since the trains from here were so limited we decided their time would start as soon as the first train would leave from the station, there was one at 13:39 and another at 13:41 in opposite direction. Also the seekers could get the matching trains an hour later (but then would to get on before waiting for a question).

The seekers started with a 10mile thermometer from Gorinchem station to Dordrecht Stadspolders. This was hotter and confirmed they guessed the right direction initially!

From Dordrecht station they started another, this time 0.5mile, thermometer, which they ended on the trainbridge from Dordrecht to Zwijndrecht. This was colder!

At Rotterdam Blaak a custom radar of 15.5miles was requested. This was a miss! This left 3 stations: Lage Zwaluwe, Roosendaal and Breda. The seekers requested a picture taken in a park, the first of these stations doesn‚Äôt have a park, the other two had very different style parks. The picture matched the vibe of Breda but it wasn‚Äôt a definite answer. Nevertheless the train to Breda was taken.

[Picture in the park](https://preview.redd.it/yspzryi6bhqe1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1e3ff23cd54e1ae5a7f2e3b7ccb3d859c93fd16)

To confirm the presence of the seekers a picture of restaurant interior was requested, this was not possible which confirmed the endgame had started!

Immediately after a picture upwards was requested, it was clear the hiders were in a small alley between two houses, but the zone was large and had many houses. Unluckily for the seekers they had started on the wrong side of the station. 

[Picture upwards](https://preview.redd.it/3pgzn0qdbhqe1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e7cb08d69b27f20ad0197c2848b54774bc73d7c)

While grid searching one side they requested a trace of the nearest street. This confirmed the wrong side of the station was searched, and narrowed down the other side to 4 streets. It was the last of these 4 streets that was searched where the hiders were found, indeed in a small alley.

[Traced nearest street](https://preview.redd.it/r7uvltagbhqe1.png?width=803&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ce31ddb00ffc765ff4c2555fc81a4c059540ac0)

Time: 2h26m +36m time bonus for total time of 3h2m

We decided to end our game here and grab a drink to end the day with some relaxing in the park in Breda with a well deserved cold drink!.

**Changes we‚Äôd do for a next time & tips for your own games:**

* Hiding time 90min from the first train that leaves from the station, this allows more options and is fairer for the next hiding teams, as there were cases with so little options it was not as fun
* With above end gameplay after 2 games even if finishing on time and do a 3rd round on the second day, giving everyone one solid hiding round. (When playing for 2 days. The games is tiring)
* You cannot scroll in google maps for more pictures, only the first 3 pictures are allowed to be viewed (for any picture question)
* Print maps of NL with map to scale and railway on it beforehand
* ‚Å†Possibly start from a different station than Utrecht, e.g. Amersfoort making all starting locations more fair
* Clarify before if the minute of starting is included or not, eg 9am hiding start, is arrival time of 10:00 in or out?
* Because it is more interesting to see different areas naturally we diverged in strategies to make the locations we visited more fun. We sometimes didn't choose the 'optimum' but that's ok. There definitely is some luck involved anyway (especially in the endzone)
* Pick a hiding zone where there is a toilet and/or some facilities..... ",5,1742753428.0,JetLagTheGame,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm 23, and recently graduated with a B.A. in Psychology & Data Science. I moved to a mountain town in August so that my partner and I no longer had to do long distance (he ski patrols) where I worked as a Forest school teacher for 5 months, then worked as a Child Protection Specialist for 3 months and now work as a house manager/cook and at a coffee shop (coming up on two months soon). I left my teaching job due to poor work environment and my CPS position due to pay and how mentally taxing it was. I have plans to work landscaping starting in May because of the pay, consistent full-time hours so I wouldn‚Äôt have to work multiple jobs and the positive impact being outside all day has on my mental health. I haven‚Äôt worked inside during the summer, even in the fall, the last three years and I‚Äôm not really willing to give that habit up. 

I‚Äôm suddenly in my head about how that will look to employers and individuals around me. Given that I live in a mountain town, it‚Äôs expensive, and a lot of positions don‚Äôt pay well enough to support living here but both the house manager and landscaping job do. I‚Äôm also waiting to get in-state tuition (in the fall or spring) so that I can get a post-bac in pre med. my long term goal is to go to a DO school and become a nutritional psychiatrist and approach mental health struggles from lifestyle habits and then medicate if needed. That being said, I feel like within the last year I‚Äôve been switching jobs and feel like that will look poorly. I‚Äôm a hard worker and super motivated, but very sensitive about my environment and need a lot of mental stimulation which is why I‚Äôm excited to go back to school. Is it silly to landscape this summer when the coffee shop and house manager position support me financially but I‚Äôm not super satisfied? Would love your guys‚Äô advice because I‚Äôm feeling a bit lost! 

I‚Äôd also like to add that during my undergrad I maintained the same position for three years during the summer (mountain bike coach) and was a research assistant and TA for the last two years of my undergrad. ",1,1742753415.0,careeradvice,0,1.0,False

He doesn't have any new teachers or friends at school named Mary, and we don't know anyone by that name either. But the other day, he started to say ""Mary!"" And spell her name using his foam bath letters. He does know how to spell his own name and his brother's name too, so the spelling thing isn't out of the ordinary expect for the fact that Mary is the only other name he knows how to spell. 

Mary hasn't been a bother until today. My older son fell down the stairs today, which has never happened before. He's usually very careful, but he fell and slid down head first, as if he was pushed. Right after that, a coffee cup full of fresh coffee fell off the counter and shattered, despite no one being around, and the coffee cup being away from the edge so that no curipus two year old pulls it down. This was followed by my two year old clapping and giggling and saying ""Mary!"" 

I wasn't alarmed when my two year old started with the Mary stuff until now. I'm kind of worried she's mean... It's mostly speculation that my older son was pushed down the stairs, as it's very possible he just tripped. I don't usually feed into this paranormal stuff, but it's all so weird and  started happening seemingly out of nowhere. We've never had a ghost issue in this house, but when we moved in my husband was saying he felt a really weird feminine energy watching him in the night. I just brushed it off but maybe it's been Mary the whole time. 

I'm not sure what to make of it all. I usually block myself off from spirituality and paranormal activity, but it's getting a little too tangible for comfort. ",1,1742753276.0,Paranormal,1,1.0,False

We ""pass"" as straight in many contexts but are of course outed when we travel as an apparent couple. (I am aware of how problematic the idea of ""passing"" is, but I just want to give you an idea that we do what we can not draw attention to ourselves in places where we might have fewer human rights than the average person based on our sexuality). We are younger than we typically appear, but are not 20s babies. We are both very well educated (MA and PhD). I do research and teach at one of the highest globally ranked universities. I grew up in the most cosmopolitan city in the world (Toronto). I travel quite a bit for work. I have never been to this specific island nation/part of the world, however, and so I don't know if this is what I should have expected or is the norm. I booked this vacation as a much-needed break from intense workloads and mental baggage of 6 months of medical nightmares in which I almost died and/or went blind twice; I don't know if Punta Cana/the Dominican is generally not considered a good place for a significant vacation.

I write to share my experience with Zel/Melia and with the Dominican, which I am not sure how much is entangled or separable.

Last year, I booked a $5k USD 7-day all-inclusive vacation at Zel by Melia in Punta Cana, through my agent and Sunwing. This was supposed to be a high-mid/low-high end hotel, newly renovated/reimagined. It was supposedly inaugurated by the president of the Dominican himself a few weeks before our arrival. As advertised, it appeared to be perfect: relatively high quality for cost as they supposedly want to generate good word-of-mouth; ""boutique"" in the sense that the hotel has relatively few rooms (<150); and was geared to our style of vacation: not party-obsessed and more about relaxation. My partner and I looked forward to this vacation for months; we had not had a vacation since 2017. It has been a difficult past 5 years for us.

Our first day was rather unpleasant; it took 4 hours to get from the airport to the hotel and actually check in (the same length as our flight from Canada). The check-in process was tedious and frustrating. There are staff to assist you, but many do not speak English or apparently know what they are there to do. They told us to ""get on the WiFi"" to complete the online check-in, but this wasn't possible because you can't access the WiFi until you're checked-in. Ergo, we had to use roaming data, which is apparently spotty there. We then had to wait multiple times for a staff person to actually assign us a room and put the resort access bracelets on us. He rushed us through a ""tour"" that he seemed like he was resentful to provide, left us with a bare-bones brochure, gave me his number for WhatsApp, and told us we could contact him with any questions or concerns/for help.

Lunch was decent; we managed to get lunch from the buffet-style central restaurant called ""Parda"". Our dinner was rather disappointing; we booked at the ""Asian fusion"" restaurant but were frequently ignored or were not brought what we ordered. The food there was mid; half of their menu items were not available. Staff seemed to be preferring a different demographic: Spanish-speaking heteronormative Latinx, whether or not they tipped. There was a gay Asian couple seated next to us who seemed to have the same issues we did. We nevertheless managed to have some good food (appetizers, when they finally arrived after dinner) and drinks (took multiple tries to order and some listed options were not available, but the wine was good). We went to bed hopeful that the other restaurants were left to explore and that they might be having an off-night (Saturdays seem to be a high guest turnover/checkout day).  
  
The next two days were quite enjoyable. Breakfasts at the Parda restaurant were pleasant. The food options (excluding baked goods) were numerous and overall satisfying. Service staff were generally much more friendly and attentive, although on the second morning I had to get a service manager's attention because some of the servers (who bring you water/coffee/tea/cocktails/etc) were ignoring us and pretending they didn't see us even when making eye contact. These servers seemed to be missing the following day/morning/etc. Lunches were also quite satisfying for us. We weren't expecting Michelin-star food at an all-inclusive. We understood that the later you arrive for a meal window, the more rubbery or stale some foods might become. I would steer clear of any baked goods except the little flower-shaped chocolate cakes. The waffles and pancakes are terrible, but these are not local cuisine. French toast is good if you get there at 7am. Their mimosas are unpleasant -- flat and watery. You will only ever get two options for wine: simply white or red. The white I believe is a Cabernet Blanc and the red is variously either Cab Sav or Merlot. Both decent Spanish wines and very acceptable to us given that it flows freely.

The steak-house restaurant was decent and the servers were good. The steaks themselves were not high-quality, but the burger was good. We found that the Mexican-Greek fusion restaurant was our favourite because the staff were all excellent/friendly, the atmosphere was relaxing, and the food was the best. The chef was amazing! She even brought us several of her specials -- all delicious. One was a desert that was the best ice cream and chocolate based deserts I've ever had. This would have been easily a $250 CAD meal in our city. I hope the chef goes far and realizes her career dreams.

Our first ""pool day"" and ""beach day"" were quite satisfying. The pool areas in particular are very well-designed and maintained. You can swim up to the central bar and order drinks. Sometimes they will understand what you are asking for, sometimes not, or sometimes they can't make it (e.g. I could not get a Mojito despite it being on the menu until the last day) but most of the bartenders will suggest a great alternative. We tipped USD cash for every drink, so eventually the bartenders pool service staff recognized us and treated us well. There is always somewhere nice to lounge. I never found any of the actual main hotel complex over-crowded. They do tend to needlessly pump music throughout the complex all day and night, and often it doesn't match the vibe -- why is there generic club music pounding in the early afternoon when everyone is lounging? The pools and grounds are beautifully illuminated at night, but the pool closes at 7pm. Makes very little sense, when the music continues to thump. I would have preferred to listen to what few night bugs survive all the spraying. Our suite, which backed onto Paradisu, Melia's premium property, faintly vibrated with music all night. I would bring earplugs if you're noise-sensitive like I am.

Our suite was otherwise very nice. Little to say here, it was mostly as pictured. If you tip housekeeping every day (we did $5 USD), they will leave you more and more snacks and refill your mini fridge. Again, overall, the service people who actually make the hotel function are good and hard-working people. They understand that guests pay their wages.

Beach day was also good, although not what was advertised in some very important ways. Granted, I have never been to Punta Cana, but I found the beach to be very over-developed. It is not a long beach (2.5km? I used to walk 4x that each way to work and home every day), yet many hotels are vying for a very small amount of space. The overall impression is beautiful and satisfactory. But appearances are very deceiving, intentionally it would seem, at Zel/Melia.

Midway through our 6-hour stint on our first beach day, we were at the bar at the ""Beach House"" restaurant on Zel's ""exclusive"" beach (quite tiny and often with inadequate seating for Zel guests). We were approached by a Dominican man who spoke relatively good English, who claimed to be affiliated with Zel/Melia. He offered to sell us ""the best trips in the Dominican."" We asked a Zel/Melia staff person who appeared to be working security if this person was legitimate/trustworthy. The security person vouched for the salesperson. He said we would have a wonderful time. We noticed other salespeople standing around with other Zel/Melia security staff chatting; we figured this was a safe option. I proceeded to book $520 CAD worth of excursions: a full-day snorkeling and beach trip to Isla Catalina and a half-day buggy trip that was supposed to include an hour+ swimming at a sacred cave and an hour+ at the beaches around El Macao. 

Instead, what we got was a nightmare that destroyed the last three days of our vacation. We were railroaded, extorted, threatened, and stranded. When I reached out to my only Zel contact, he refused to help, even when I said that we were trapped on what was essentially a modified fruit truck being driven by a teenager who did not seem to understand where he was going. Imagine being railroaded for 7 hours without anyone responding to you or telling you what was happening -- being threatened repeatedly to pay more and more USD just to progress or be left behind.

When we finally got back to our hotel 14 hours later (no food or drink or having experienced what we paid for), we reported our experience immediately to two individuals who claimed to be the managers of the hotel (two light-skinned Dominicans, one man and one woman). They expressed horror and concern, and that they would come up to our room to ""make a full security report"" and ""make everything right"" after we had had time for a shower. They never showed up. After dinner, I spoke with a man who claimed to be head of security. He promised to meet me in the lobby at 9:30 the next morning to resolve the situation.

At 9:30, he did not show. I waited until 9:45, and then had to make a loud scene with one of the many bewildered and/or apparently reticent/resentful front staff to contact this person. He arrived at 10. His offer was to go to the beach and ""make a deal"" with the people who scammed us, to get ""a discount on another trip."" I refused; I had already spoken with my bank and they had already flagged (before I called) the charges on my partner's card as suspected fraud connected to a known criminal organization. I said I would not negotiate with criminals. I explained that I expected a) an actual security response rather than them acquiescing to known criminals who collude with Zel/Melia staff, and b) 2 extra days stay (costing Melia 0$) and the difference in airfare home (not even a drop in the ocean of Melia's profits). The Zel security head said he could not help me with that. I then asked to speak with the manager of the hotel.

Enter the man who I only know as Shit-Eating Grinner (SEG), as he never identified himself. He and the security head then attempted to talk me in circles for 2 hours. At one point, they laughed at me; I used my professor voice to admonish them for how unprofessional that was of them. They kept ignoring/not acknowledging my request or the key information of how this was indeed a Zel/Melia concern. Eventually, SEG bluffed when I asked for his manager -- he said he was the ""manager of all Melia properties in the Dominican."" I pressed him and he eventually conceded that he was not, and that he had a boss. At first, she was not at the hotel; eventually she was ""in a meeting."" The security head eventually understood and agreed with my complaints and said that if he could help me/make me whole he would (his English was good and he appeared to be educated, while his boss, SEG, pretended to understand but had to have his underling interrupt him to correct his ignorance). Eventually, SEG simply stated that ""this is how it works in the Dominican,"" suggesting that my only option would be to go to a police station and make a report. Because this would take the whole day and that nothing would home of it, he said I would not do it. He said Zel/Melia would not speak on my behalf or intervene at all. He said that when you come to the Dominican, you have to expect that everyone is ""lying but being honest."" What hotel staff say are ""opinions"" and you trust them at your own peril. Eventually I broke through their circular logic (blaming it all on me) and convinced SEG, with the security guard's help, to put me in contact with his manager. He left for 20 minutes and then returned, promising that we could explain the whole situation and that his manager, a woman he would not name, would be calling me in an hour.

This supposed manager-of-the-manager never called. After lunch and some cooling off time at the beach, I returned to the front desk  and once again used my professor voice to get this supposed upper management woman to come out of handing. Surprise: she was the same woman who never showed up after promising to come to our room to make a report. She (and the other man from the other evening) denied having met me before, saying that they didn't know anything about what I was talking about. She denied that she was lying, but caught herself in several more in quick succession. Since I do not back down, ever, against unethical people, I let my voice rise until all staff and guests around me could hear me. When my agent called and I loudly explained the whole situation (this took about 20 minutes) in the middle of the lobby, this supposed manager woman continued to lie to my partner and make insulting offers. Her best? They would charge us $25 USD just to sit in a nicer chair on the beach.

She said she would speak with more people at Melia and that we could go try to relax on the beach. We did have relatively good last day on the beach until the sun began to set. However, neither this woman nor anyone from Melia contacted us or came to speak with us at our room. I reached out to the Melia representative who tried to sell us a $5k CAD membership and claimed that Melia values word-of-mouth above all else and does everything to make sure their clients are treated well. His first reaction was horror and effusively apologetic. He said he would look into it. He followed up.

I will spare you the details of our trip home, which started with the front desk's incompetence, the shuttle services' surly incompetence, and an encounter with SEG in which he loudly threatened me at the threshold of the main lobby.

What I do wonder, then, and leave as an open question: is this normal for Punta Cana, Melia, or the Dominican in general? My agent (friend of the family) has done some investigations and reached out to her network and reports that such accounts are coming in from people across Canada, Asia, and a bit of the United States. She says there seems to be a palpable change in the air -- many people seem to be openly hostile to presence of Canadians and/or non-Latinx visitors. Meanwhile, I observed so much rampant hypercapitalist neoliberal culture. My theory (my academic brain) tells me that this is probably due to a combination of: 1) a corrupt government and business culture that stratifies society based on colour (colourism, if not racism; evident in any advertisement across the island) and inter-generational wealth; 2) a lack of investment in education, leading to only the wealthiest citizens receiving minimal or advanced education outside of the country, meaning that most citizens learn what is ethical through culture/media that pushes a money-first/extractive and exploitative neoliberalism; and 3) a kind of swelling head among those most privileged Dominican citizens and its business culture that they are somehow hot shit now and don't need to respect people because they'll always get more visitors, and don't realize that many of the ones whose money they want the most will slowly pull back and not return. They will end up destroying their nation through their own greed, ignorance of the world beyond their own pockets, corruption and backbiting (I saw members of the airport staff opening fighting for their carriers' interests over others), and some amorphous sense of growing malaise and hatred for difference or anyone who one cannot extract wealth from.

Really, I worry such a beautiful place will be ecologically and socially destroyed. I feel like returning would just support such bare evil. Petty and small evils on most scales, but enough that will support greater evils and injustices to people and the environment. Everyone (specifically in powerful positions, who are likely from wealthy families) seems to view others as object/resource to be exploited, as they do the beautiful island that sustains them.

Thoughts -- is this a normal experience? I have never experienced such horrible treatment before, and I travel a lot vis a vis the average Canadian. Are there better and more respectful/able places in the Dominican to stay in future? How about the southern coast near Catalina, where the water is actually Caribbean?

TL/DR: Canadians traveled to Punta Cana/the Dominican for the first time for a very important, expensive, and anticipated vacation. Fell in love with the place by day 2, but was then betrayed by the corruption and abject inhospitability of Zel by Melia's management. Wondering if this is a Zel/Melia problem specifically or if it's systemic across the island/country. We met some good and honest/genuinely warm Dominicans, but they were in the minority in number encountered and in terms of who were in positions of power vs. service.

PS: I will be making many detailed reports across many channels, but wondered what insights this community might be able to offer and wanted to offer my own experience to those who might be considering Zel/Melia in future. I have only included the main points; there is more I will be raising through official channels.

I helped her and got her comfortable but I nearly imploded for the first 30mins afterwards - full on body shakes and shit.

I was TERRIFIED she actually had a bug and that all other 3 of us would end up catching it and just‚Ä¶ get sick together or close together, essentially ruining the weekend.

The night went fine after I gave her some anti emetic medication. It turns out she had started a new pain medication but didn‚Äôt listen to the pharmacist advice to take some protective medication for her stomach ‚Ä¶ 99% what made her puke in the first place.

The 1% was still fucking with me but I pulled through.

ANYWAY she opened up a bit after a while about it how it SUCKED for her as well - first time meeting us, being sick far from home on the first day of a weekend where 4 ppl would share a space‚Ä¶

She‚Äôs not emetophobic and even if she didn‚Äôt really enjoy the puking she was pretty detached about it. Fianc√© and I were working on Friday but they had a whoooole day planned out exploring London so they had to take off around 10am.

Here are some observations I‚Äôve made about this non-emetophobe being confronted to our worst case scenario: 

- The morning after she was still a bit shaken up and definitely avoided coffee, just in case. I think her stomach was still a bit unsettled 

- She also stayed cautious about eating her lunch but was back to eating pizza on the night after (24hr after the sickness)

- She felt bad about it but still asked if I had another anti-emetic pill to give her ¬´¬†just in case¬†¬ª because she‚Äôd be far from the house for the whole day and I guess?? Even non-emetophobe don‚Äôt really like the prospect of this when they were sick just 12hrs prior

- She confided in me that after her first bout of vomiting (she threw up 2x in 45min) she was already thinking about booking a hotel room for the nights after in case she had a real bug. She told me it was 
> a) because she felt bad about us living through it > b) she wanted to feel comfortable being all-in sick in private.


So. My catch is that, even some non-emetophobes do struggle with the anxiety of it all when they are directly confronted with it! Even they never really think about it normally.

It kind of helped me be kinder on myself for panicking. No one likes being sick, even less when they‚Äôre sleeping away from home and/or are in vacation away from their own comfort.

So let‚Äôs keep our heads up. I felt discouraged by this massive step back but it‚Äôs actually refreshing to see that it‚Äôs nerve wracking even for the chillest individuals.

I‚Äôm a SAHM (AUDHD) to one child (AUDHD), husband (AD*H*D) and we have a puppy.  I‚Äôve been having more meltdowns than I like - especially around mealtime.  Our daughter is almost 10.  I was eating my brunch (ie leftovers) today and drinking coffee.  My husband comes and talks on his mobile, standing over me, trying to sell the dining table.  Our dog is scratching my leg, begging for food, my daughter is asking if she can wear her ‚Äústar suit‚Äù to a playdate.  

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a star suit?  No, you need to wear shoes and clothes.  Yes, you‚Äôll have fun.  Can I please eat quietly?‚Äù 

And I literally cannot take a single bit of food without some creature demanding I inhale air so I can choke out an answer (‚Äúplease put the puppy in the x-pen, please have your conversation elsewhere, please wait until I‚Äôm done eating‚Äù to ask questions about the play date that I‚Äôve already answered 20 times.) I‚Äôve already fed the dog, the kid and the husband but not me.  

I start soft but often end up yelling out, ‚ÄúCan I please just eat a single bite in peace?  Please.  Please stop talking near me, at me, to me.  I just want silence.‚Äù  I frequently come in my room and lock the door for twenty minutes citing a need for a people break.  I end up feeling awful and waking up 2-4 AM wondering why I‚Äôm such a horrible Mom.  I just want to be able to prepare myself food, sit down and eat it without the whole thing taking 90 minutes from interruptions and eating a cold meal with cold coffee.  I have food allergies, so everyone else‚Äôs meals and needs are always first.  I get hungry too!  

The older I get, the less energy I have for people. I don‚Äôt have friends and rarely leave the house except with the family or to run errands. 

I used to hide behind the house next to the air conditioner.  I‚Äôd sit on a folding chair, just to drink a cup of coffee or just to sit.  No one knows my spot or wonders why a folding chair lives next to the air conditioner. I Literally hide.  Thanks for listening to my rant.  

PS: I do love my family very much, I do set boundaries but I am rarely listened to unless I raise my voice, and then I‚Äôm the baddy.  Yes, I have a therapist.  Yes, I take medication.  Yes, I‚Äôm signing up for a parenting with ADHD course online.  No, I don‚Äôt need friends, the culture here doesn‚Äôt suit me but we need to live near family + husband‚Äôs work.  

Thoughts, comments, words of encouragement appreciated.  I‚Äôm *not* a victim but I am overwhelmed by life‚Äôs constant demands/stimulation.  There‚Äôs a reason I wear sunglasses indoors.",1,1742752692.0,aspergers,0,1.0,False
1ji5b8z,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ji5b8z,First project - gold finish repair on a Japanese coffee mug,"First major Kintsugi project here. I bought this lovely ceramic cup in Japan and on returning almost immediately broke it. My friends thought I did it intentionally just to try Kintsugi! 

For repair, I chose traditional Urushi given its food safety. I wanted to restore the cup to functional use. My kit was from the Traditional Kintsugi Shop. 

I‚Äôm not particularly crafty but this was an extremely fun and satisfying project and would definitely recommend the traditional route over epoxy. I loved it. It‚Äôs a marvel to me that the cup is so sturdy now given it‚Äôs held together with lacquer.

Using the kit‚Äôs terminology, I ended up doing
1 round of Kokuso
2 layers of Sabi-urushi
3 layers of Black urushu
2 layers of Red urushu for the finish (due to an error)
No issues with curing, but we are in a relatively humid environment. 

I made many mistakes in this but still very happy how it turned out for a first go. The cup has a lot of texture which is both forgiving and unforgiving (it‚Äôs hard to give the flat gold look).  For other beginners attempting this, here are some mistakes I made which might be of value:

1. When gluing the parts back together, I did not hold together the cup strongly enough and a piece slipped very slightly during curing. This made the rest of the project much more difficult as I had to essentially sand the surface of the cup smooth where there was a slight elevation gap. The misalignment also shows up in the finishing process. 

2. I didn‚Äôt mask off the cup sufficiently before applying the first coat of Sabi-urushi. This resulted in a few days of filing and sanding to get the urushi staining off. Prep is key!! Don‚Äôt be me and rush this beautiful art. 

3. The cup was too small and deep for my hands making painting the inside quite challenging. The lines inside are messier and thicker. I don‚Äôt have a good solution to this other than patience. or recruit a small child. 

4. Not all areas were sanded as flat as they could be. Every non-flat imperfection ended up showing in the finishing.

5. For the finish, I initially used the cotton ball provided in the kit. I made a huge mess, used way too much gold and got red urushi + gold everywhere. I went and redid portions of it using a brush and the results were much better. Expensive mistake but the second attempt at a finish came out much better.

im just frustrated with the way things are being handled at our store. we have 2 shifts (out of 4. that‚Äôs half.) that are functionally unable to run the store effectively. they don‚Äôt know how to support effectively and they almost never get everything that needs to be done done. when i close with them we always get out at least 15 minutes late despite my best effort. it‚Äôs so frustrating, and my SM knows they can‚Äôt do their job but it feels like nothing is happening about it.

another shift is just always excessively rude and doesn‚Äôt follow the rules. anytime he‚Äôs having a bad day it‚Äôs taken out on us (at least me) and it feels like he‚Äôs having a bad day every time we work together. plus he always has airpods in on the floor when the sm is not there like dude you are at work.

i don‚Äôt think my SM likes me, she‚Äôs very nitpicky with me and always has been (i transferred to this store a while ago and it hasn‚Äôt changed) despite the fact i feel like i am the only one actually trying to follow the rules and standards. she also loves to take her bad days out on everybody and it‚Äôs really frustrating and it does not feel like i can go to her with any concerns (as i (and others) have but nothing has happened). 

im a very by the book person and love to share tips and ways that i think that our store could be improved but nobody listens. my other baristas (not all but some) also do little things like not staying planted, ringing orders in incorrectly, not getting coffees/tea, and other things that i am constantly over correcting/remaking drinks/fixing problems and i feel like im doing at least two peoples jobs. plus there is just an overall lack of communication which leads to drinks being made twice, incorrectly, or not at all.

it‚Äôs all very frustrating and idk what to do. i really honestly like doing my job when im just doing my job and everyone‚Äôs working together, but i just feel like im working my ass off for no recognition and actually actively being told i‚Äôm not doing enough, and i don‚Äôt take pride or feel good about anything that happens, and it leaves me feeling defeated after every shift",1,1742752204.0,starbucks,2,1.0,False

Upmarket fiction, Where Willows Take Root, set in 1965, Kat meets a hippie on the highway who comes to work on the farm, and she learns her alcoholic grandfather isn‚Äôt her only ally. An excerpt was published in The Saturday Evening Post's Great American Fiction","\-PROLOGUE ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†Columbia Station, Ohio 1953  
  
Eight months pregnant, her belly moving in a ripple with the baby‚Äôs sweeping foot, Helen sat outside on the cement porch step, pretending to sip yellow dock tea ‚Äî a bitter medicinal herb that Leo dug up this side of the woods. From here she could see Carl in the distant field plowing under the winter rye. She could see Leo bringing the sheep in from the apple orchard. Helen heard the screen door squawk open and snap shut when Millie came outside.  
  
‚ÄúCome sit with me,‚Äù Millie said, cutting off a small wad of chewing tobacco with her pocketknife. ‚ÄúCold cement not good for you. Not good for baby.‚Äù Biting down on the tobacco, holding it between her teeth, she closed her pocketknife and slipped it into her pocket.  
  
Millie was no farmer‚Äôs wife. She didn‚Äôt shuck corn. She didn‚Äôt shell peas. No, Millie made a good living on Harvard Avenue in Cleveland at Harshaw Chemical Company ever since 1934 when she learned to speak English. Helen never asked what her job was there, just knew that she‚Äôd left the cooking up to Leo all these years because he cringed at her borscht and holodets.  
  
Helen stood up, holding her back, holding the rail. Millie plunked down on the porch swing, her legs apart like a sailor, and discreetly spit tobacco juice through a straw into an empty Coca Cola can. Heaven help anyone who mistook it for pop. The minute Helen sat down next to her, Millie set to patting Helen‚Äôs knee, a slow pat, shoulder bumping in affection.  
  
Helen had grown to like how physical her in-laws, Millie and Leo, were, and how her husband Carl was physical, too, always touching. It felt odd at first, hugging hello, kissing goodbye. Quite the opposite of how she‚Äôd been raised. Mornings, Millie knelt before Leo and fed his old-man feet into compression socks. A double pat told him each sock was securely in place. Evenings, Millie sat on Leo‚Äôs lap and he read the newspaper to her, a joint effort. She held one side and he the other with the only hand he had.  
  
The baby must have been stretching, a definite foot pushed hard by the way Helen‚Äôs belly moved. Millie slid her hands over the movement. ‚ÄúIt is good she moves so much.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWhy do you think it‚Äôs a girl?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúShe moves in rhythm to a Prokofiev symphony.‚Äù  
  
¬†‚ÄúMaybe she will be a ballerina.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúYou must not speak of future success. It is better to be silent, even pessimistic, until success comes true. You don‚Äôt want to bring bad luck.‚Äù Millie dry-spit over her left shoulder, three times, as it was said into the face of the Devil who lurks there.  
  
‚ÄúMy mother said not to love my baby too much. That showing affection would only coddle her. She said it will make her strong. What do the women in Russia do? How were you raised?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúIf you do not show love, she will be hard, not strong. Some Russian women are afraid to love their children because so many die. I don‚Äôt remember my mother much. My mother die when I was very young,‚Äù Millie said, matter-of-fact, then spit through the straw into the can again. ‚ÄúThe Czarist regime killed her. We were in a crowd in St. Petersburg. They call it Bloody Sunday. Troops were ordered to open fire ‚Äî was Russian Revolution. 1905. The last thing I remember is holding her hand.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúHow awful.‚Äù Helen stroked her shoulder. ‚ÄúWhat did you do?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI go with my grandfather,‚Äù Millie said. ‚ÄúVery stern. Very proper. Grandfather say I face death many times, and still I come back to him. He say chudo, miracle.‚Äù  
  
¬†‚ÄúWhat did he think about you coming to America?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI think he would like it. America ‚Äì a country for all nations, of all nations. He died. Revolution of 1917. I was thirteen. I was servant girl for food rations.‚Äù ¬† ¬†  
  
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine how hard that must have been for you.‚Äù ¬† ¬†  
  
‚ÄúNo so hard now. America is good. Very good.‚Äù Millie planted her feet and stopped the swaying motion of the porch swing. ‚ÄúI think I lie down. My stomach‚Äôs not so good.‚Äù She‚Äôd kept quiet about feeling sick up to now, as not to worry Helen in her pregnancy. Which must have been hard. Millie was terribly ill.  
  
That would be Helen‚Äôs last good memory with Millie. Her life ended two months later on June 12th, 1952, from acute radiation syndrome‚Äîwhat they called cancer. Harshaw Chemical Company turned out to be one of the largest manufacturers of uranium chemicals in all of the United States.  
  
The day Millie died, throes of sorrow threw Helen into labor, and a newborn girl shifted the household from comforting the dying to nurturing new life. It seemed only fitting to honor Millie‚Äôs memory by naming her granddaughter Katianna Milena Bovinich.  
  
In a crowd of mourners at Millie‚Äôs funeral, Helen watched Leo hold her tiny person for the better part of the day, visibly careful of the metal hook that had taken the place of his hand.  
  
¬†‚ÄúShe is so much like my Millie. Those dark lashes. Those eyes,‚Äù Leo said. He breathed a kiss in the softness of the baby‚Äôs dark hair. ‚ÄúMy Kat-ski,‚Äù he whispered to her, his white wiry brows no longer wrinkled. ‚ÄúI wish Millie could see you.‚Äù  
  
Helen rubbed his back softly. ‚ÄúIf only she could.‚Äù

Columbia Station, Ohio, June 5, 1965  
  
Kat‚Äôs hair rose and fell down the length of her back with the passing of highway traffic as she pulled a rusted red wagon along Route 82, its fill of empty pop bottles rocking and clinking to the trill of countless cicadas. Lydia, her eight-year-old cousin, pushed the wagon from behind, her skinny legs and arms outstretched. It was hot today, maybe ninety degrees and Kat, all but thirteen, had been glad for it earlier‚Äîhaving washed Lydia‚Äôs sheets and drying them on the clothesline before her stepfather, Dean, could shame the little girl for wetting the bed again.  
  
The wagon wheels dipped toward the slope of the gully. She had no choice but to steer it closer to the road, centering it between the sparse bit of gravel and the poison sumac that snaked through the chicory and clover. A semi-truck whooshed past the girls as if they weren't even there. Their blouses and short shorts flapped wildly in the wind surge.  
  
¬†‚ÄúStay on this side of the white line, whatever you do,‚Äù Kat said to Lydia, who had come to live with them a few years ago as the only survivor of a foggy morning car accident in the Smoky Mountains. Prone to nightmares, Lydia found comfort at night by laying her head on Kat‚Äôs heart which Kat couldn‚Äôt help but surrender. She‚Äôd do anything to keep Dean from touching the kid.  
  
A caravan of cars passed the next semi-truck except for the last car; a stretch powder-blue Thunderbird coasted beside them. Boys inside smacked loud and drawn-out kisses, its radio playing, I Want Candy. One of them yelled, ""Hey, farmer's daughter. I‚Äôm a traveling salesman.‚Äù  
  
Wild laughter erupted from inside the convertible. Kat cast her eyes forward, nodding for Lydia to do the same. A wolf whistle curled her fingers into fists. Then the car peeled out, imprinting indelible marks in the asphalt‚Äîits tailfins gleaming in fumes of exhaust.  
  
""Y'all! We can do without the likes of you!"" Lydia blurted out. Her southern drawl set her apart from northerners here. ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you say something?‚Äù Lydia asked, her sunburnt nose peeling, cowlicks standing straight up in her pixie-cut hair.  
  
‚ÄúGrandpa Leo says, ‚ÄòGive them a drop and they‚Äôll take the whole bucket. The Vietnam lottery‚Äôs driving boys crazy.‚Äô He told me to keep my pride when they act like that.‚Äù  
  
Another car drove by‚Äîanother wolf-whistle.  
  
‚ÄúAlright, already,‚Äù Kat huffed, waiting for the car to drive out of sight so she could pull her shorts longer, blouse wider, anything to hide these curves and swells that seemed to have come in the night, the catalyst for inappropriate behavior‚Äîeven from Dean. Kat couldn‚Äôt have hated him more.  
  
A flicker in the parched grasses reminded Kat why they‚Äôd come here. ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs another pop bottle,‚Äù she said, wading through ragweed and thistle, toward the promise of another two-cent refund. Finding a dirt-crusted pop bottle from under a broken one, she loosened it out. A truck blared its horn at Lydia who wasn‚Äôt even on the road. In that instant, spiders spilled out of the bottle onto Kat's thin top. A fire in her throat gave way to a scream. She shook herself fiercely and tried to bat them off which chased them to her neck instead. Lost in the language of screaming, she mindlessly hopped across the white line.  
  
Skidding tires stopped her right there when she saw a dump truck coming straight at her. It swerved to avoid oncoming traffic and crashed in the opposite ditch.  
  
Its diesel smoke settled in the back of Kat's throat, her stomach rising up to meet it. Lydia clung onto Kat's arm and hid her face there.  
  
A colossal man emerged from the wreckage and yelled at her over the traffic, ""What the hell are you doing?"" Glazed in sweat, his heavy beard blended in with long ringlets of hair‚Äîno question, a hippie‚Äîthe first she'd seen in this farming town. The man crossed the highway, the great height and girth of him, like an illusion in waves of heat. ""I could have killed you!"" He tromped right up to her, their eyes fused in a stare-down.  
  
""Spiders were crawling all over me,"" burst out of Kat.  
  
""So, you threw yourself in front of a truck?"" He leaned into her; his hand raised.  
  
She took a step back, taking Lydia with her. ""You touch me and I'll\_\_""  
  
""Be still. You've got something in your hair,"" he said, his baritone softer, his breath as sweet as Orange Crush. He had to be twenty-something.  
  
Kat squeezed her eyes shut, clenching her hands, muffling the scream in her throat to a hum. She felt the warmth of his hand. The whoosh of a passing tractor-trailer and the height of a cicada song seemed to sizzle in her ears. He picked a spider out of her dark hair, swiped her bare shoulder, and then untangled a butterfly wing from the crown of her head. White, almost translucent, something she'd only seen in dreams. ¬†  
  
He paused, his face changing in supposed recognition. ""I know you.""  
  
""I hardly think so,"" she said, taken aback. ""From where?""  
  
""You're the spitting image of your grandmother,"" he said, clearly likening her to an old woman.  
  
Kat snapped, ""The grandmother who hates me? Or the grandmother who died so long ago neither one of us could possibly have known her?"" There was no doubt that Bunica hated her. The other grandmother, who Kat was named after, had died on the day Kat was born.  
  
""I need a tow truck to get out of that ditch, ‚Äúthe man said. ‚ÄúWhere can I get to a pay phone?""  
  
""C&Cs. We're taking pop bottles up there,"" Lydia said softly, then hid her face behind Kat's arm again.  
  
""The gas station across from C&Cs should have a tow truck,‚Äù Kat said, feeling sick about causing an accident. Dean would turn it into a reason to use his belt, his ultimate threat. ‚ÄúThey get pretty busy over there. You might have to hurry to catch the driver,"" Kat added, desperate to get rid of the man, desperate to keep Dean from finding out.  
  
Semi-trucks flew by, one after the other, creating a vortex, so much so, the man scooped Lydia up as if it might pull her in. It was strange how Lydia let him hold her there, even after the traffic died down.  
  
Resting her head on his shoulder, Lydia let out a breath. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hot. I don‚Äôt want to be here anymore.‚Äù  
  
""You shouldn't be out here at all,‚Äù he said softly. ‚ÄúWhere are your parents?"" he asked Kat.  
  
""My stepfather sent us. He gave me a note to trade his pop bottles in for Marlboros,"" Kat said.  
  
The man stared at her blankly. ‚ÄúIs he trying to get you killed?‚Äù  
  
Kat‚Äôs stomach dropped. She suddenly felt sick. Dean couldn't have possibly talked her mom into letting them go. Retrieving his note and seeing it now, the scorching heat felt as though it would melt her entirely, her breaths came shallow and quick.  
  
The paper was blank.  
  
Her mother had warned her about Route 82 since she could eat with a fork. Kat had to get to the store. She had to call Mom the minute she got there. She would say she was sorry. Ask for Mrs. Crocker (a neighbor who used to babysit her) to come pick them up. Say she would never do it again. ¬†  
  
Why had she nodded so stupidly when Dean had come up with this? The newspapers were full of high-speed collisions, drunken drivers, kids hit and killed. Why had she fallen for, ‚Äòit'll be fun?' Dean could lure you in, convincingly so, and act as though you were the most important person on earth, and cut you down just as easily. She knew better than to trust him, not after he‚Äôd caught her alone in the barn. If there was ever a reason to run away, that was it. If it weren‚Äôt for Lydia, she would have made her way to that hippie commune in Drop City, Colorado, the one she'd seen pictures of in Life Magazine. Cher was a famous hippie, only three years older than Kat. Kat idolized Cher. But she would never leave Lydia here to fend on her own.  
  
Still resting in the arms of a stranger, Lydia offered up, ""I'm Lydia. This is Kat. Her real name is Katianna. Isn‚Äôt that pretty?""  
  
""That‚Äôs not English. Is it?"" He squinted against the sun. ""That‚Äôs Russian. I know that much. You‚Äôre a Russian girl.""  
  
Feigning composure, she ached to ask him if insulting her was his intention or if he was just ignorant. ""Just because my name is Russian doesn‚Äôt mean I am. I'm American, like anyone else."" She hated the questions her foreign name begged for.  
  
""Well Kat, I wouldn't count on another eight lives. It's a miracle I didn't run you over back there,"" he said.  
  
Kat held back her disdain for giving a miracle credit. Her mom believed in miracles, the elusive pardon from God. She believed in angels walking among them. If that was true, then why was her mom still sick? Kat had tried so desperately to make things easy for Mom the last two months‚Äîfrom ironing to hanging laundry on the line. She‚Äôd kept the sheep fed and their stalls clean, along with completing day-to-day chores. Watching her mother‚Äôs health diminish terrified Kat as much as it had six months ago, when her mom had stolen away in her locked bedroom, her belly still swollen from the child she‚Äôd lost. Her sorrow was so deep, it bled through the door Kat huddled against, calling on God just to hold her.  
  
The thought of disappointing her mother was unbearable. The only good thing was, Lydia had someone to carry her. Everyone said it was a miracle the girl could walk, for that matter, that she survived when her parents didn‚Äôt. Maybe Lydia was proof of a miracle. The hope, the prayer, the very idea brought up so often it fell in line with a childhood fairy tale.  
  
The man spoke up again. ""If it was anyone else driving that truck, you would be dead right now. Dead is dead, forever and always. Don‚Äôt ever forget that.‚Äù  
  
Dead, forever and always. That had to get to Lydia. It got to Kat. ""You made your point. You can stop now,"" Kat said flat out, red-cheeked, and sticky in road dust and grit.  
  
Edging along in silence, biting on the ragged skin inside her cheek, Dead, forever and always brought back a rush of memories‚Äîthe sweating glass of water she had taken to her dad in the field‚Äîhis overturned tractor‚Äîthe tie they put on him that he never liked.  
  
A cloud of midge flies swirled to a cluster of crabapple trees where the sun shimmered on spiderwebs along the low branches and sparkled on last winter‚Äôs cinders a roadcrew had long-spread.  
  
Lydia broke in, ‚ÄúCan I have a soda when we get there?‚Äù she asked Kat, her face flushed. ‚ÄúDo we have enough empty bottles to trade, and still get Reese's Cups?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Kat answered, eyeing the few bottles they‚Äôd found and had poked in and out of Dean‚Äôs. ‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù  
  
The man thump-swiped Lydia‚Äôs face, the sweat that ran from her temple to her jaw. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to let you go thirsty.‚Äù  
  
¬†  
CHAPTER 2 ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† HELEN  
  
Helen stilled herself on the edge of the bed, sweating horribly, moving on from the last bout of nausea. She made herself get up‚Äîjust as she had the last two months no matter how many times this thing knocked her down. Every morning, she forced herself out of bed and dressed as though she were well, combing her hair into a French twist, sipping a cup of coffee and goat‚Äôs milk with three teaspoons of sugar which made her feel better sometimes, other times like her insides were killing her.  
  
She wasn‚Äôt pregnant and didn‚Äôt have an ulcer or anything else as far as Dr. White could tell. It wasn‚Äôt her nerves, either, as he insisted. Anyone would have grieved the loss of a child. Six months ago, today. Even now, the simplest things drew trance-like memories of her newborn, Paul Lee. She still couldn‚Äôt fathom how the doctor, who diagnosed him with Down syndrome and a heart defect, had done nothing to save him.  
  
She‚Äôd been inconsolable when she let Leo bring her and the girls back to his farm, home from the time she had married Carl until his untimely death three years ago. Straight from Leo‚Äôs car, she locked herself inside the bedroom that had once been hers and Carl‚Äôs, rocked the so-small urn to her milk-engorged breast, crying on and on, wanting to die. Looking for a means to an end, she‚Äôd dug through the closet, gone right to it, and unearthed the gun from Carl‚Äôs fur-lined boots. She‚Äôd opened the cylinder and lined up the bullets. In that instant Leo knocked at the door and called her name. The bedroom door opened as if by itself. Leo must have picked the lock, something he had never done in all the years she and Carl had lived there. She remembered how the bedroom curtains waved with a sudden breeze; sheep bleating in the distance. Herself‚Äîa gun in one hand, bullets in the other. Leo feigned a mellow kind of delight when he said, ‚ÄúLook at that. You found that old thing,‚Äù as if he were coaxing her to dance, that time so long ago, in the butter beans gone to seed.  
  
¬†  
Helen found herself in the kitchen, sipping that morning's cold coffee. The breakfast dishes were still soaking in the sink. The beat-up can of bacon grease drippings that hadn‚Äôt hardened was still out, too. Leo would never have stood for it.  
  
Come Tuesday, Leo was coming home, having served his full six weeks getting sober. Helen had to convince Dean to live somewhere else. Without her. She had to ask for a divorce on no uncertain terms, and she had to do it today.  
  
Through the willows outside, noisy with miserable crows, she saw Dean tuck in his white button-down shirt as he hobbled to the house from the barn. What little she‚Äôd saved for the divorce lawyer‚Äôs fee was wadded in a Kotex box hidden in stockings and garter belts. She would have earned the rest by cutting hair at Higbee‚Äôs Beauty Salon in downtown Cleveland by now, if she hadn‚Äôt been so terribly sick. All that aside, it wasn‚Äôt easy for a woman to file for a divorce in these times, but nothing worth having was easy.  
  
She unstuck the paint-layered door and looked beyond Dean. ""Have you seen the girls?"" She needed to know where they were right now. They couldn‚Äôt be a part of this.  
  
""Kat was dragging that old wagon around the last time I saw them. I don't know where they are now,"" he said. ""I just got back from the docks. Me and the boys had some business to take care of."" Boys‚Äînot hardly. These men were involved in the Cleveland Mafia. She and Leo had been keeping track of up-and coming-criminals in the Cleveland Plain Dealer, Scalish, Burns, men she‚Äôd personally met at a lavish affair.  
  
‚ÄúLydia follows Kat everywhere. Did you see them in the barn?‚Äù She looked for them from the kitchen window over the sink, and stood on her toes to see as far as the woods. Dean pressed his body against hers from behind, his tobacco breath stale on her neck. She leaned away. ‚ÄúI thought you were afraid of catching what I have.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing wrong with you that a little loving can‚Äôt cure,‚Äù he said, working his hands down her body.  
  
She pulled away from him. She came right out and said it, ‚ÄúI want a divorce. Nothing you say will change my mind.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúYou always tense up when I touch you. We don‚Äôt need a divorce. You need to relax.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúYou know it‚Äôs been coming,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThis is Leo‚Äôs house. You never would have come here if you hadn‚Äôt had that surgery on your hip. You never wanted to live here. But I do.‚Äù  
  
""Is this about Kat again? She's got that old man tied around her little finger.""  
  
""I‚Äôve been a good Christian wife to you and you led me to believe you were a good Christian man. But no Christian would have touched a young girl like you did, and twist what you did with such precision that I didn't know what to believe.""  
  
""Not this again,‚Äù Dean said. ‚ÄúWhat did you expect me to do? Kat smart-mouthed me. I spanked her. A couple of swats. Spanking is a normal part of parenting. And so, what‚ÄîI slapped her butt. She better get used to it. That‚Äôs what men do.""  
  
‚ÄúNot any decent man. Not Leo.‚Äù  
  
¬†""What is this love affair you two have going on?""  
  
‚ÄúIf I were a man,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI'd punch you square in the face.‚Äù Leo had been torturing himself ever since she‚Äôd taken the girls away. He knew it wouldn‚Äôt have looked good for her to raise young girls with a drinking man. But he said he‚Äôd cut back when he‚Äôd asked her to stay, if not for him, for the girls. Leo was no kin to her or Dean but would do anything for Kat. And Helen liked to think he would do anything for her. ¬†  
  
""And that's another thing. I've never raised a hand to you. You don't know just how good you have it.""  
  
But he had raised his hand to her when they lived in Parma and he‚Äôd tried to bully her into selling her land, no doubt, to pay for his gambling debts. Although it never came to blows; Kat interrupted his tirade, forcing herself in between.  
  
Helen squeezed her eyes shut, head down, hand in hair. Helen‚Äôs mother, Bunica, had forced the idea of marrying Dean, American-bred and willing to marry the daughter of immigrants, raise her social status, and set her up for life. Helen pushed back, but Bunica threatened to put her out in the street and put the girls to work on the farm if she didn‚Äôt accept his proposal.  
  
¬†‚ÄúI can‚Äôt live like this anymore. Please, Leo‚Äôs coming home. You have to leave.‚Äù  
  
He grabbed her arm, trapped her against the sink. The Mr. Hyde to his Dr. Jekyll. ""Give me one good reason,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd don't bring parenting into it.""  
  
A hundred reasons boiled down into one. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt love you anymore,"" she said. He let go of her, gazed deep in her eyes, then to the floor, looking genuinely hurt‚Äîhe was good at that. But he was good at deceit.  
  
The phone rang. Helen answered it, ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù  
  
""Mom. Can you call Mrs. Crocker to come and get us?"" Kat asked. ""I can explain.""  
  
Without so much as a warning, dizziness, shortness of breath, a stabbing stomach cramp drained every last ounce of strength. It was all she could do to keep herself from doubling over. Whatever this was came in on-and-off waves. Her back to the wall, her body slowly slid to the floor where she sat holding herself. She'd get a lawyer on her own. She'd sell Carl's wedding ring, borrow, anything. Just as soon as she felt better. ¬†""Dean. I don't want to fight. You know I'm not well.‚Äù  
  
He swallowed, his Adam's apple straining. Then he straightened his shoulders; he jutted his chin out. ""Till death us do part,"" he said, which sounded more like a threat than a vow.  
  
""Where are you?"" Helen said to Kat.  
  
""We're at C&C."" Kat's sounded like she could barely breathe.  
  
""Are you alright? How did you get there?"" Helen contained the sickness the best she could.  
  
""We‚Äôre fine. We walked here. Dean said we could.""  
  
¬†""Hold on,"" Helen covered the receiver in her hand. ""Dean, did you tell the girls they could walk to the store?""  
  
""Is that what she's telling you?""  
  
""For once, just be honest with me.""  
  
""You let them wander off to the highway and you want to pin it on me? I've never seen a more neglectful mother. It's a wonder they don't take those children away.""  
  
""Kat. Stay there,"" Helen said. ""I'll call Mrs. Crocker to come and get you.""  
  
Dean took the phone from Helen and hung it up. ‚ÄúWhy do you want to drag an old woman into this? You made them my responsibility. I‚Äôll take care of them, and good.‚Äù He flung the door open, the doorknob hitting the stove where it had already made a dent. ""I'm tired of you taking everyone's side but mine. Things are going to change around here.""  
  
Yes, things would change. Tomorrow. She would feel better tomorrow.  
  
  
CHAPTER 3 ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†KAT  
  
Kat sat with Lydia in the empty wagon under the shade of a willow tree, a Hershey bar and a Reece‚Äôs Cup melting in her pocket while Lydia sipped on her second cherry Yoo-hoo. The noon siren flooded in from miles away, the daily noon test-run for the township‚Äôs volunteer firemen. The only thing louder was a sonic boom.  
  
Watching for Mrs. Crocker‚Äôs car, Kat recognized Dean‚Äôs blue Ford pickup and immediately stood. Watching him barrel into the parking lot, she felt his eyes on her, on her short shorts, on her thin summer top, and folded her arms over herself.  
  
‚ÄúYou girls get in the truck right now.‚Äù The meanness in his voice set Kat to swallow hard. He was mad‚Äîshe saw that coming.  
  
‚ÄúYou and your big mouth.‚Äù He opened the gate of the truck and loaded the wagon, banging it on all sides, a racket that turned every head in the parking lot.  
  
""Why are you making a scene?‚Äù Kat asked.  
  
His face transformed into worry-lines. He tossed a trodden-upon nod to everyone watching. Then told the girls in his Sundy-go-to-church voice, ‚ÄúYou had your mother worried sick. Come on now. Get in the truck.‚Äù  
  
Kat wouldn‚Äôt have it. ‚ÄúWhy did you give me a blank piece of paper and tell me to buy cigarettes?"" she said. ""Buy your own cigarettes,"" and threw his pop bottle money at him. ""Now you can't say I stole it.""  
  
Dean chased a dollar bill and thanked a person who helped him pick up the rest. ‚ÄúNow you know what I have to deal with.‚Äù He turned to Kat and Lydia. ‚ÄúPlease, for your sake, get in the truck. It‚Äôs not safe out on the road like this,‚Äù he said with all the humility of a man pleading with a tyrant. ‚ÄúYour mother is worried sick about you.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúYou should be ashamed of yourself,‚Äù a woman‚Äôs voice piped in.  
  
Kat shrunk. How did Dean always turn his dirty tricks against her? The memory burned, still fresh in her mind, of him catching her alone in the barn. He‚Äôd hurt her, forcedly throwing her over his lap, in the pretense of a spanking‚Äîher nearly a woman. She wished she hadn‚Äôt said anything to anyone, wished so badly that Grandpa Leo (well into his evening whiskey) had never taken to his rifle. As if he had planned it, Dean called the Lorain County Sheriff and charged him with the intent to kill. But when the handcuffs came out, Dean said he would drop the charges if Grandpa committed himself to some unholy place where alcoholics are forced into a delirium of some sort‚Äîthe D Ts.  
  
All eyes on her, she slid in the truck but before Lydia could, only to serve as a buffer between Lydia and Dean‚Äôs unpredictability. The truck idled a blue cloud of exhaust, the cab a hotbed. Dean climbed in next to her.  
  
‚ÄúYou set me up. From the minute I left the house,‚Äù Kat said. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong with you?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get smart with me, girl. You might be too old for a spanking but you‚Äôre not too old for the belt.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúIf you ever touch me again. . .‚Äù The threat hung unfinished.  
  
Dean slipped the car in gear. ‚ÄúWhy do you always make me the bad guy? I‚Äôve been doing you a favor by not calling Children‚Äôs Services on you and that one. It wouldn‚Äôt take much to convince the eyes of the law that your mother is not capable of taking care of you. I‚Äôm no kin, not legally, but I‚Äôm the only thing between you and a foster home right now. And get that hair out of your face. You‚Äôd think you were one of those free-loving hippies.‚Äù He gave her a sideways look. ""You‚Äôve got a hard road ahead of you,"" he said, ""fighting the bloodline you‚Äôve inherited from a mail-order bride."" This was the woman Kat‚Äôs mother adored, even though she had come to America as a Russian mail order bride; it was a subject so sticky, no one dared speak of it.  
  
Lydia butt in, ""Leave her alone.""  
  
Kat tucked her hair behind her ears, looking up long enough to see that man, the hippie truck driver, across the street at the gas station. He must have heard Dean yelling. He was looking right at her, transfer trucks intermittently blocking the image of him, his lifted hand in a wave, trying to draw their attention.  
  
‚ÄúYou know that boy?‚Äù Dean drove onto the highway.  
  
Lydia answered, ‚ÄúYes sir,‚Äù too quickly.  
  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just asking for trouble. There are homes for girls like you.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a grown man. I would never.‚Äù Kat clenched her mouth, heat rising in her ears, and said nothing else. Grandpa Leo would be coming home. Her mother would feel better then. Kat would learn the art of pitchfork defense for the next time Dean caught her alone in the barn. She‚Äôd keep her mouth shut if he touched her again. Grandpa could never know. Dean would have him arrested next time.  
  
  
That night Kat lay in bed, counting the cars she heard on Route 82 as they sped past her house. The sound of the fan wedged in the window disturbed the stillness inside the bedroom she shared with Lydia. Her mind changed channels from this thought to that, tar bubbles that popped under their flip flops, bits and pieces of the accident that flashed on and off. She could still hear the pop bottles clinking; could still smell that bearded man‚Äôs sweet-smelling sweat. Dread came in waves.  
  
She rolled over in bed and punched her pillow, the white cotton sheets sticky against her skin. She longed so badly for her dad to be there, a heart-crushing longing. Her dad had too often come home after she‚Äôd gone to bed. He worked third shift at the steel mill, The Cleveland Works. From what he‚Äôd said, it was a miserable place, casting red-hot molten iron. His work clothes were burned in pinpricks. She held onto the mornings she followed the lure of his percolating coffee, the sun so low you could barely see the edge of morning. He would greet her with, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs my Ski,‚Äù (he called her Ski) cheerful and bright as a shiny penny that spun on end. Kat would cozy herself up to the kitchen table, rest her head on it. He‚Äôd come sit with her, lay a kiss in her hair. The two of them eating toast and rhubarb jam, the steam of his coffee curled as he sipped it. She treasured those memories, just a girl and her dad.  
  
""Kat,"" Lydia whispered. ""Kat, are you awake?"" Lydia padded to the edge of Kat's bed. ""I'm scared. Can I sleep with y'all?"" She crawled in the twin bed and aligned her body with Kat's.  
  
""Did you have another bad dream?""  
  
""It‚Äôs no dream. They's somebody under my bed. I mean it this time.""  
  
""No, there's not. It's just a hitch in the fan.""  
  
""No, it taint. They's a witch under my bed, fixin' to give me warts like hers and drag me to hell,"" Lydia said in one breath.  
  
""Don‚Äôt ever watch Outer Limits again. There are no such things as witches.""  
  
""I wish my mama was here. I wish she would walk through that door right now.‚Äù Kat didn't know how to respond. Lydia's parents were dead, going on three years, like her dad. That's how Lydia had come to live with them. Lydia's other family in Tennessee would have given her a home, but Kat's Mom wouldn't hear of anyone else taking in her sister's child.  
  
"". . . or at least, Mamaw would. If she still wants me. Would that take a miracle?"" Lydia's Mamaw, a Chickasaw Indian, the widow of a southern preacher man, had taken their deaths the hardest and wanted Lydia to live with her, probably still did. ¬†  
  
""Tennessee's a long way. Even miracles have their limits. And of course, she still wants you, but she's got to be eighty by now and she lives with your Aunt Ginny and all those kids.""  
  
It didn't seem right that Lydia's Mamaw could still take her away, but seeing how things were these days, things might be better for Lydia in Tennessee. Lydia would like that. Then Kat could run away, find that hippie commune in Colorado if she could, and join the peace movement against the Vietnam war.  
  
Laying there with Lydia‚Äôs body up against hers, Kat couldn‚Äôt help but go over and over how Dean accused her of lying and coaching Lydia to lie, too. It just about killed her to see her mom pull away from the table, her face all white. It was her fault her mother was sick this time. Dean said so. She couldn‚Äôt argue with that.  
  
‚ÄúKat,‚Äù Lydia said softly. ‚ÄúIs that a Reece‚Äôs Cup I smell?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúJust half. It‚Äôs in my headboard. You want it?‚Äù

Sam has always been very controlling over our relationship. If I say i'm gonna do something, I have to do it. If I cancel or am late, he gets irritated and let's it be known.



If a friend cancels on me, I don't care. I stay home or do something else. If I cancel on him, he's irritated ans angry. I've learned to not cancel on him. I enjoy his company and he enjoys mine, but I've learned to not make plans I can't absolutely keep with him.

I've wondered if it was just part of his diagnosed ocd or something, but more importantly, that's his boundary and having that boundary is his right. It's not like it's usually a hard boundary to respect.

Back in September, we made verbal plans to get tacos on his birthday in November. I have no recollection of making this plan. We never followed it up with a text or at any point. On the day of his birthday, i texted him to wish him a happy birthday. He followed up with, 'does 6:30 pm still work okay?'

I was traveling for work early the next morning and needed to wash my hair. I wasn't able to drive 45 mins across town to get tacos at a specific restaurant in the south valley. 

I said ""for what? Did we have plans today?""

I searched through all of our text messages and  we had never confirmed any plans for today. I still enthusiastically offered to meet him for ice cream by his house, just that I was unable to drive all the way across town to get tacos.

He became angry. 
He then texted me I was flakey. Directly saying ""im not sure I want to be friends anymore.""

He's a grown adult 32 year old man. He forgot my birthday completely. And i'm not holding it against him. I can have things come up and be spacey but im a good person and a pretty good friend. 

I can't deal with friends who are too demanding of me. I'm not very demanding of my friends.

I didn't bother texting back to his aggressive message about not wanting to be friends anymore. Like if you don't want to be friends with me anymore, that's fine with me. I have other friends. I don't need to beg.

A few months later he texted me ""how was christmas?"" 
We started chitchatting.
He asked if I wanted to get coffee.
I said I'd like to get coffee sometime and simply didn't set a location or time. Truthfully, i didn't really want to meet up with him. 

I then posted a picture at a corporate event of me and another guy friend. The year previously, Sam had been my date to that same corporate event
 
I am now blocked on all of Sam's social media accounts. And I think he's blocked me on phone number too (haven't checked but I think so).

I am struggling with the reaction from him because we have been friends for ten years. While I realize we have probably outgrown our dynamic, he has hurt me by blocking me. I don't feel like I did anything wrong.

If I was him, I would have recognized that maybe we're not to be good friends anymore. And maybe just not hit me up as much. 

He's very demanding of his friendships. He's blocked people before for not being adequate friends, or for ignoring him. I think that's what's happened here. I hurt him by not immediately jumping to get coffee with him/reinstate our friendship. And then I may have hurt him further by appearing happy hanging out with other people, particularly another guy friend at an event that I took him to last year.

I wish that I hadn't hurt him as his badly as I clearly have. But selfishly more than anything. I just wish that he could have ignored me back. So we could have maintained on good terms and just let our friendship drift apart more organically. 

Tldr: it's not like we were dating and I don't think I did anything to deserve this level of contempt. 

And, well, i'm just struggling with it. Just seeking another opinion so I can maybe get a little clarity and distance on the situation",1,1742751867.0,relationship_advice,7,0.67,False

I have several wooden pieces like coffee and side tables that I would like to keep. These are finished, sealed on the top, but the bottom(back) is unfinished. I know I can clean the non-porous parts with EC3/Decon30 but I'm wondering what I can do about the unfinished bottoms. 

If I was to use a waterproof sealant like polyurethane to seal the bottoms would that potentially ""encapsulate"" any mold spores or mycotoxins that settled in the wood? Anyone think it would be necessary to sand it first or treat it with some chemical like hydrogen peroxide? Anyone done anything like this before?

1m59, 85kg. 

I am a bit overweight. I wouldn‚Äôt say a lot but too much for what I want to achieve. I‚Äôd say a week and a half ago I finally got the click and have been consistent. And yes I have been doing cheat meals sometimes (more because I live at home and I can‚Äôt decide what to eat for dinner). I do try to eat a small amount of the unhealthy food when we have it for dinner.

My day starts off at around 10/11 am and I eat like 250grams of yogurt and I drink a coffee with milk and one sugar. (I came from 3 sugars). Then I usually don‚Äôt eat for lunch and have my dinner early if I have to work (shifts are until 10pm mostly so I don‚Äôt like to eat after cause I know eating close to going to sleep is not healthy.) I have like a Normal portion of spaghetti Bolognese for dinner. This was an example from yesterday. I can say I might have been eating somewhat like this most days. I would say less than 1000kcal. I also try to get my protein in because I know that helps as well. 

My work is not very active. I sit around and spend a lot of time on my phone and when i‚Äôm not at work I usually sit in bed and watch movies, series and youtube.. I do have a gym membership but I don‚Äôt have motivation to go to the gym (1,5hours to the gym and back). I do try to do some ‚Äúgirls‚Äù push-ups (on my knees) to kinda get some movement in. I might also try to increase my steps a lot. I now have around 5.000 a day.

I know this is a reason why it‚Äôs not going as well as I thought it would. But i‚Äôm going to work on that. 

But the thing that really bugs me is that my weight hasn‚Äôt moved at all. 

What am I doing wrong???

I‚Äôm 23, and recently graduated with a B.A. in Psychology & Data Science. I moved to a mountain town in August so that my partner and I no longer had to do long distance (he ski patrols) where I worked as a Forest school teacher for 5 months, then worked as a Child Protection Specialist for 3 months and now work as a house manager/cook and at a coffee shop (coming up on two months soon). I left my teaching job due to poor work environment and my CPS position due to pay and how mentally taxing it was. I have plans to work landscaping starting in May because of the pay, consistent full-time hours so I wouldn‚Äôt have to work multiple jobs and the positive impact being outside all day has on my mental health. I haven‚Äôt worked inside during the summer, even in the fall, the last three years and I‚Äôm not really willing to give that habit up. 

I‚Äôm suddenly in my head about how that will look to employers and individuals around me. Given that I live in a mountain town, it‚Äôs expensive, and a lot of positions don‚Äôt pay well enough to support living here but both the house manager and landscaping job do. I‚Äôm also waiting to get in-state tuition (in the fall or spring) so that I can get a post-bac in pre med. my long term goal is to go to a DO school and become a nutritional psychiatrist and approach mental health struggles from lifestyle habits and then medicate if needed. That being said, I feel like within the last year I‚Äôve been switching jobs and feel like that will look poorly. I‚Äôm a hard worker and super motivated, but very sensitive about my environment and need a lot of mental stimulation which is why I‚Äôm excited to go back to school. Is it silly to landscape this summer when the coffee shop and house manager position support me financially but I‚Äôm not super satisfied? Would love your guys‚Äô advice because I‚Äôm feeling a bit lost! 

I‚Äôd also like to add that during my undergrad I maintained the same position for three years during the summer (mountain bike coach) and was a research assistant and TA for the last two years of my undergrad. ",3,1742751792.0,careerguidance,4,1.0,False

Based on my experience with [**Plexus Slim Hunger Control**](https://amzn.to/4kyTOg1), it offers moderate appetite suppression (3.5/5) thanks to its polydextrose fiber, but provides minimal metabolism boosting (2/5) and energy enhancement (2/5) effects.

It's notably low in stimulants (1.5/5), making it suitable for those sensitive to caffeine, though this also means limited fat-burning benefits (2/5). The safety profile is solid (4/5) with few side effects beyond occasional digestive discomfort when starting.

My clients have used with mixed results (3/5), with most appreciating the hunger control while finding weight loss results modest, and at its price point, the value for money (2/5) is questionable.

For more effective appetite suppression and better overall results**,** [**I'd recommend HourGlass Fit**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/hourglassfit.php) **with its glucomannan fiber** instead, which provides stronger hunger control and better value for your investment.

I've tried quite a few weight loss supplements, appetite suppresants over the years, and recently gave Plexus Slim Hunger Control a shot for about a month. If you're considering this product, here's my honest take after using it consistently.

## What worked for me

The appetite suppression effect is definitely noticeable. I found that when I took it about 30 minutes before meals (especially lunch), I was less likely to overeat or snack between meals. The polydextrose fiber seems to be the main ingredient responsible for this‚Äîit creates a feeling of fullness that helped me reduce portion sizes.

The chromium might have helped with my sugar cravings as well. Some of my clients typically struggle with wanting something sweet after dinner, but they found this decreased somewhat while using the product.

I appreciate that it doesn't rely heavily on stimulants. Unlike some supplements I've tried that are loaded with caffeine and leave me jittery, this one contains minimal caffeine from the green coffee bean extract.

## Where it falls short

Don't expect dramatic results. This isn't a ""miracle"" product that will melt away pounds without other lifestyle changes.

My clients who used this only noticed modest weight loss (about 3 pounds on average over a month), and that was while also maintaining regular exercise routine and being mindful of diet.

The taste isn't great. It has a somewhat artificial sweetness that I never quite got used to, and mixing it properly takes some effort to avoid clumping.

The price point is higher than I'd like for what you get. If you're on a budget, there are less expensive fiber supplements that might give you similar appetite-controlling benefits.

Some of my clients experienced some mild digestive discomfort during the first week (slight bloating and gas), which is common with fiber supplements. This did improve over time as their body adjusted.

## My current recommendation

After trying various supplements, **I'd actually** [**recommend HourGlass Fit**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/hourglassfit.php) with its glucomannan fiber over Plexus Slim if you're primarily looking for appetite control. In my experience, the glucomannan provides stronger and more consistent hunger suppression throughout the day without the artificial taste issues I had with Plexus.

For even better results, I've found that combining this type of supplement with **a simple whey protein** and **psyllium husk** mixture about 30 minutes before meals works wonders‚Äîthis combination has consistently delivered the best appetite control results for my clients who struggle with portion sizes and between-meal cravings, allowing them to stick to their calorie goals without feeling deprived.

If you are okay with caffeine based appetite suppressant, I also **recommend** [**PhenQ**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/phenq8.php)**.**

## Who might benefit with Plexus Slim Hunger Control

If you struggle with portion control and snacking between meals, this could be helpful as part of a broader weight management strategy. It seems most effective for people who eat out of habit rather than true hunger.

If you're sensitive to caffeine or stimulants, this is gentler than many fat burners on the market.

**Who Should Consider Appetite Suppressants/Weight Loss Supplements like Plexus Hunger Control?**

**1\. If you struggle with Portion Control**

- **If you find yourself unable to stop eating once you've started a meal**, products like Plexus Slim Hunger Control can create a physical feeling of fullness that helps you eat smaller portions
- **If you regularly clean your plate regardless of portion size**, fiber-based supplements taken before meals can help you feel satisfied with less food
- **Alternatives:** Glucomannan supplements like HourGlass Fit, PhenQ or PhenQ Meal Shake, which contains multiple appetite-suppressing ingredients

**2\. The Emotional/Stress Eaters**

- **If you turn to food when feeling stressed, bored, or emotional**, appetite suppressants with mood-stabilizing ingredients might help break the cycle
- **If your eating is triggered by specific emotional states rather than physical hunger**, Plexus Slim's combination of fiber and chromium may help regulate both physical and emotional eating urges
- **Alternatives:** 5-HTP supplements like HourGlass Fit , Genius Diet Pills or L-theanine supplements that address the mood component of emotional eating

**3\. If you‚Äôre seeking Blood Sugar Regulation**

- **If you experience energy crashes that lead to intense hunger and cravings**, the chromium in Plexus Slim may help stabilize your blood sugar levels
- **If you find yourself craving carbs and sweets intensely throughout the day**, the combination of chromium and fiber can help maintain steadier glucose levels
- **Alternatives:** Berberine supplements like [Blood Sugar Optimizer,](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/bloodsugaroptimizer.php) cinnamon extract products, or Alpha Lipoic Acid supplements

**4\. The Occasional Support Seekers**

- **If you only need appetite control for specific situations** (like parties, holidays, or restaurant meals), Plexus Slim's portable packets offer on-demand support
- **If you maintain a healthy diet most of the time but struggle during certain scenarios**, occasional use may be sufficient without daily commitment
- **Alternatives:** Natural Hunger Control by Life Extension or Goli Apple Cider Vinegar gummies for situational appetite control

**5\. The Stimulant-Sensitive Dieters**

- **If you want appetite control but caffeine causes anxiety or sleep issues for you**, Plexus Slim's low-stimulant formula provides benefits without heavy caffeine content
- **If you've had negative reactions to traditional diet pills** that rely on stimulants, this gentler approach may work better for your system
- **Alternatives:** HourGlass Fit is currently my top pick for an appetite suppressant with minimal stimulants.

## Final thoughts

I'd give Plexus Slim Hunger Control a 2.5 out of 5 stars. It does provide some appetite suppression, but it's not dramatically better than other less expensive fiber supplements I've tried. The addition of chromium and the other ingredients in their proprietary blend might offer some metabolic benefits, but the value for money is terrible!

If you're looking for a supplement to complement your weight loss efforts, this could be worth trying, especially if traditional stimulant-heavy products don't work well for you.

Please keep your expectations realistic‚Äîit's a tool that might help with hunger control, not a standalone solution for weight loss.

## My Evaluation of Plexus Slim Hunger Control Across Key Performance Categories

**Appetite Suppression: 3.5/5**

The polydextrose fiber creates a moderate feeling of fullness, but it's not as powerful as glucomannan in HourGlass Fit or other dedicated fiber supplements. Most users report reduced hunger for 2-3 hours after consumption.

**Metabolism Boost: 2/5**

Contains ingredients like green coffee bean extract that may slightly increase metabolism, but the effects are minimal. Don't expect significant metabolic enhancement from this product.

**Energy Enhancement: 2/5**

Provides a very mild energy lift primarily from the small amount of caffeine in the green coffee bean extract. This is definitely not an energy-focused supplement.

**Stimulant-like Effects: 1.5/5**

Minimal stimulant content means very few jitters, racing heart, or anxiety that typically accompany stimulant-heavy products. Good option for those sensitive to stimulants.

**Fat Burning: 2/5**

The combination of chromium and green coffee bean may offer modest fat-burning support, but results are typically subtle. This is primarily a hunger control product, not a direct fat burner.

**Safety Profile: 4/5**

Generally well-tolerated with minimal side effects beyond occasional mild digestive discomfort when first starting. The low stimulant content reduces risks associated with many weight loss supplements.

**User Reviews: 3/5**

Mixed feedback with most users appreciating the appetite control but disappointed in dramatic weight loss results. Long-term users tend to be more satisfied than those expecting quick results.

**Price/Value for Money: 2/5**

On the expensive side for what's essentially a fiber supplement with some additional ingredients. Many users feel the same benefits could be achieved with less expensive alternatives.",1,1742751331.0,HealthTrendz,0,1.0,False

Not just his music‚Äîshe was into the whole red hair and freckles look. But instead of just appreciating it, she decided she had to become one.

Any normal person would just buy hair dye, but she thought that would be too obvious and our parents would catch on. So she started dyeing her hair using tea grounds. She soaked her hair in tea for an hour almost every day, slowly turning it into a natural-looking reddish color. And to top it off, she started dotting freckles on her face with makeup.

It actually worked. Her hair had a reddish tint that looked surprisingly real. The downside was that her scalp started smelling like spoiled black tea. My parents eventually noticed, but she told them it was for dandruff and hair loss, and they completely bought it.

A year later, the redhead craze died down, and suddenly redheads were back to being the butt of jokes. So she started dyeing it with coffee grounds to make it blackish-brunette so no one would call her out.

Then lockdown happened. She did the coffee thing for about a year, but then karma hit (she would waste perfectly good tea and coffee if there were no grounds) her hair started shedding like crazy. Turns out, years of dyeing her hair with kitchen ingredients had completely wrecked her scalp. She went to a dermatologist, got diagnosed with eczema and some other scalp issues, and had to go through treatment.

The funniest part? The treatment completely restored her natural black hair. So after years of tea, coffee, and paranoia, she was right back to square one. Now she‚Äôs suddenly an expert on haircare and skincare, always giving me advice. But let‚Äôs be real‚ÄîI‚Äôm not taking tips from someone who dyed their hair with Starbucks.

Beside‚Äôs a couple of non album tracks, we have finally covered every Tragically Hip song during these weekly discussions! First I would like to thank every single person who took time out of their day to not only read these silly posts but tot those who commented on them as well. It‚Äôs because of you that I even started writing these post in the first place. I wanted to have a place where each song not only had a place to shine but where we could complete proper research into each one. Whether that meant how the song was written, interpreting what the song was written about, finding historical facts or discussing the music itself. My hope was to make certain songs that sometime get overlooked appeal to a new set of eyes. 

But my other reason for creating these posts were so that us fans could get involved. I wanted to see why people loved these songs and to know what these songs meant to different people. Some people played these songs at their weddings. Others used these songs to comfort them after a hard time in their life. And some of these songs were what got them into this amazing band. Its these stories and interpretation that transforms these songs into their own reality and make them live outside of the band. And I can‚Äôt thank everyone enough for adding to the conversation. At the end of the day it‚Äôs about not ranking the songs, it‚Äôs not promoting a podcast or getting Reddit karma. And it‚Äôs not about getting recognition from the band. It‚Äôs about celebrating the music, the band‚Äôs hard work and the fans. And I have loved interacting with all of you, so thanks again.

Now let‚Äôs get down to business! Down below I have gathered the links to every song discussion and have organized them by album and chronically, with the non album tracks at the very end. I will warn that my writing style and researched has changed (hopefully for the better) over the years so some of the earlier song discussions might feature minor grammar mistakes or they may seem less interesting. If you think there‚Äôs a song that needs a revisit or some revision I will be more than happy to edit the original post and write a better discussion. And as I mentioned before, there‚Äôs a couple of obscure non album tracks or tracks on some of the recent box set reissues that weren‚Äôt covered mostly because there is so little is known about them. If there‚Äôs a song I missed that you are dying to talk about, let me know and I‚Äôll get working on it. And finally, if the band releases more unknown songs down the road I will cover them and add them to the list. Feel free to click on any song down below and add the original discussion. Enjoy!

i plan to buy a new MacBook Air M4 for my Studies as well as my private Projekts. I do a masters in Economics and use my current M1 Air as my only Computer. My private projekts are rather low intesity tasks and contain mostly research stuff, self organazing and so on. Basically Office Programms, AI¬¥s and in rare occasions some gaming.

At home i got a 27"" 1440p Screen i could use, but i like the idea of a one machine workstations, i can take everywhere with me without the need for a second screen for some acceptable side-by-side windowing.

After beeing to a Apple Store 2 times now, the 15"" Air seems pretty nice for my usecase with its larger screen realestate and added bonus points like the better speakers. Therefore i lean towards the 15"" model.

My concern is, that while the size is suitable for work on a stationary desk, the 15"" Air could be difficult to use in for example trains or similar places.

Could current 15"" Air owners maybe tell me about their experience with their machines and how well the MacBook is in the portability factor (not just weight in backpack, but actual usage in mentioned scenarios)?

As a alternative i also looked at the M4 14"" MacBook Pro.

Your guys opinion is very much appreciated! :)",1,1742751014.0,macbookair,0,1.0,False

I found it to be very ‚Ä¶.. underwhelming?
I‚Äôm going to attempt to be very fair in my review, so here‚Äôs my experience: 

- dishes were dirty. Not filthy but definitely had leftover food residue from whoever used it last 

- coffee was bland but I get it, we don‚Äôt go there for the coffee. Orange juice was also just a bottle of Tropicana , at least give me a cup. No water unless explicitly asked, and even then I didn‚Äôt get any water 

- the pancakes are ENORMOUS and taste fine, but were runny in the middle 

- the scrambled eggs were ‚Ä¶. A choice. Obviously boxed eggs which , in this economy I get it. But why were they so wet??? Undercooked maybe , idk 

- syrup is the small Kraft packaged syrups. Maple syrup is extra and incredibly cold

- there were TWO pieces of hair on one of the orders. The owner (I think? Maybe manager) came by the table and apologized profusely which I appreciate but she mentioned that the cook is bald so she didn‚Äôt know how that happened. My guess is, dirty dishes again 

There was more but these were the main points that stuck out to me. In all fairness the staff was incredibly nice and helpful (water aside) and I am in no way trying to disparage this establishment because maybe I just came on a bad day. But overall, not worth the 90 minute wait time and 45+ minute commute (if coming from lower westchester)

(V2) Alright, I installed a digital PID read and put the machine on stream mode and brew mode at the coldest heat setting. 

Hopefully this helps for anyone debating between Lelit Mara X (a unique HX that operates like a dual boiler due to dual PID engineering). vs a dual boiler which is known to be more ideal for precise temp controls but  may be overkill for a few drinks a day. 

*Steam Mode:* It actually was oddly colder (~190-192F) on steam mode and brewed a few degrees higher, close to the 197 target setting. Steaming milk did not impact brew temperature in any meaningful way and there was stability on back to back shots/workflows. 

*Brew Mode:* Temps around 194 and brewing a few degrees higher around 199-200. Weirdly slightly higher temps than steam mode without as strong of steam power


*Conclusion*: Lelit Mara X is a very temp stable machine, and you get all the benefits that come with E61 (pre-infusion, robust build quality and aesthetics). 

All this fuss about steam mode ‚Äúburning your coffee‚Äù at least on my machine is not the case.  It‚Äôs actually the opposite, somehow the brew appears to be colder.  *And back to back workflow no impact on temps surprisingly.* 


I‚Äôm just going to keep my machine on steam mode going forward.

1ji4kxb,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1ji4kxb/venting_about_being_raised_in_the_church/,Venting about being raised in the church,"Hey all! First things first, I wanna say this group is amazing! I always feel very seen any time I see posts here. 

Anyway, I've been officially ex mormon for about 3 years now. But I knew the church was bullshit since I was like 12. I kept going to church because my parents made me. 

I grew up in a very traditional town of 1500 people. The vast majority of which were mormons. 

Long story short, I moved out of town at the age of 20. Allowed myself some self discovery, and found out I'm transgender. Now I'm disowned and my family and I want nothing to do with eachother. But that's not really what I want to vent about. 

What I have been struggling with the most is actually functioning in a society that's not a 1500 person cult town. 

My whole life, up until I left my hometown at 20, I was kind of handed this manual on how to live my life. You didn't question it, and as long as you followed it perfectly, you would be fine. 

Well that actually WASNT working for me. Turns out I have a lot mental diagnoses that the church couldn't help me with. Turns out reading scriptures, fasting and praying won't cure your ADHD, weird. 

I kept reaching out to my community (who largely didnt believe in mental health) in the church for help. But I kept getting spiritual answers to my mental health problems and it wasn't working. I finally came to the conclusion that I needed to move out of my hometown because things weren't working for me there.

So, I moved to the city at age 20, and I made it 23 fully believing nothing was wrong with me mentally. 

Now I'm 29. And after several crisises, hospitalizations, and psychiatric/ therapist visits, I'm learning that I am coocoo for cocopuffs! 

I have so many mental health issues! Most of which were made worse by being ignored or by being raised in the church. I'm able to look back now and see a lot of the signs of mental illness, and trauma from being raised in an abusive home, as well as in the church. 

I feel like I'm learning about it all very late in life, and it's making it difficult to live a normal life. It's overwhelming learning about all my mental health diagnoses and learning how to manage it all. 

Don't get me wrong, it's working! I'm glad I have the diagnoses, cause now I at least have tools to manage them. It's just shocking to have to deal with it all blindly for 23 years and then be bombarded with it all at once! 

Another thing that I struggle with is relating to anyone who didnt grow up in the church. 

Yeah I didn't really believe in any of it as soon as I became a deacon, but I stayed to make my parents happy, and all my friends growing up were mormon because, well, no one else lived in my isolated hometown. 

I can't go to a party with my wife and socialize. Because don't really know how. All the socializing I did growing up was centered around the church. 

I don't know ANYTHING about popular culture because the media that was allowed in my house was so strictly monitored. 

And then there's the whole coffee dilemma. Most people drink coffee and know what their drink is and stuff. Same with alcohol. I had no idea about ANY of it, and (at one of my previous jobs especially) got teased to no end for it. 

It makes me wonder how many mormons just stay in the church because it's what they know. 

Anyway, sorry, rant over. I just needed to get that out. ",3,1742750851.0,exmormon,1,1.0,False

on my way home from my boyfriend‚Äôs house (we both live on opposite coasts of the US), Marigold and I landed in Dallas Fort Worth, which is.. the second-largest airport in our country. it isn‚Äôt easy to navigate at all, either!! especially not when you‚Äôre disabled like me, i have PTSD and chronic injuries, so it was horrifying.. üò≠ carrying Marigold on my shoulder, we ran all over the place, but were still going to be late for our flight.. i remember crying and shaking, i was lost and alone in this mid-point far between my two homes, with only Marigold to comfort me.

a lot of tears and physical strain later, we made it to our gate with just a couple of minutes to spare!! but suddenly, the Potomac mid-air collision happened, and then a terrible storm struck DFW airport.. so with our flight cancelled, me and Marigold were effectively stranded. i was so scared!! there wouldn‚Äôt be any flights until the next day, and they were handing out hotel vouchers (to go out in the rain and take a taxi to someplace new, then be back in the morning).. i just couldn‚Äôt do that. i was so scared but we hung out together in the airport, crying some more and then resting until the morning came. with some help from other ladies, we found a safe spot to sleep in the airport, and when morning rolled around, we had a really yummy apple pie strudel!

people in the airport kept staring, pointing at me, whispering and saying that i had a bunny or a puppy.. i thought maybe they couldn‚Äôt have possibly meant me and Marigold, so i largely ignored it. but when i finally got on the plane home, two girls across the aisle excitedly went ‚Äúexcuse me‚Ä¶! is that a real bunny‚Ä¶?‚Äù. i didn‚Äôt think she looked super life-like!! staff would often go ‚Äúi love your bunny!‚Äù and then i‚Äôd get to boast about my darling boyfriend. probably one of the more difficult and terrifying times of my life, but marigold made it so much better 

marigold still smells a bit like an airport to me, of air fresheners and coffee, but it‚Äôs calming now instead of a bad reminder.. she kept me so happy and calm during that whole affair.. i‚Äôm so so grateful she‚Äôs part of my life now üíï

(the second picture is one my bf snuck of me, playing with her and wearing his pajama pants.. i love him) ",6,1742750733.0,plushies,1,1.0,False

1ji4h9k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nanny/comments/1ji4h9k/struggling_with_nf/,Struggling with NF,"At this point I feel like this job is basically all cons 

‚Ä¢I make $15 an hour watching two kids

‚Ä¢Don‚Äôt get paid time and a half after working 40 hours

‚Ä¢ When I watch the kids on weekends the parents say it‚Äôs only a certain amount of time but then without communication they stay out for hours after they said they would be home

‚Ä¢ Younger girl (2 1/2) will scream bloody murder whenever she wants anything at all to the point where she stops breathing from pushing out high pitch screams so hard

‚Ä¢ Older boy (3 1/2) can‚Äôt share anything, screams in everyone‚Äôs face, destroys little everything, will slap and kick me, will spit in his hand and rub it on my face if he doesn‚Äôt get attention when he‚Äôs being bad

‚Ä¢ Parents won‚Äôt let them go outside at all while I‚Äôm here

‚Ä¢ Parents won‚Äôt let them take naps while I‚Äôm here

‚Ä¢ Parents give them coffee in the morning from Starbucks and donuts

‚Ä¢ Parents don‚Äôt place any consequences on kids bad behavior 

‚Ä¢ Kids only get attention when their parents are home when they are screaming so now that‚Äôs what they do constantly

‚Ä¢ They keep their dog locked in a cage all day and the cage isn‚Äôt big enough for him to even stand up in

‚Ä¢ Get an hour out of the entire day (most times less) put together of not screaming and crying loud high pitch crap

‚Ä¢Younger girl if calm for too long, once she‚Äôs happy or mad or sad she will scream bloody murder for absolutely no reason other than she‚Äôs gone without screaming for too long

‚Ä¢I have to clean up after the older boys in the house and I don‚Äôt get paid for that

Problem is that even with all this, any other nanny position that‚Äôs on care or nanny lane is $12-$13 for 2-4 kids. I might just have to go work at McDonald‚Äôs because atleast I would be making more there and not have to deal with all this.

1ji4gxm,https://www.reddit.com/r/stephanieharlowesnark/comments/1ji4gxm/why_i_keep_watching/,Why I keep watching.,"I‚Äôve been asked this question a few times recently on my post. And I‚Äôm gonna be honest. I keep watching Stephanie because I keep hoping that one of these days on one of her videos she‚Äôll have a coming to Jesus moment and realize how fucked up she‚Äôs been about how she talks about her previous relationship. Or that she finally pops off and tells us all the ‚Äútruth‚Äù (her truth) about what happened. Idk why. I keep waiting for her to tell her own true crime story. 
I feel slightly invested in her because I‚Äôve been watching her for years! Since she covered Chris watts and Casey Anthony the first time by herself on her channel. I liked how she told stories. How down to earth it use to feel. Her and her coffee talking to us like we were friends sitting across a table. But the moment I realized a change in her was during 2020 and the BLM movement. She posted a video covering George Floyd. And she added the clips of his final moments. I personally don‚Äôt think she should‚Äôve added that. I feel like it‚Äôs trauma porn . And I didnt agree with how she said that we needed to watch it in order to wake up and care. I don‚Äôt need to see someone being killed in order to give a shit about humanity. I started taking her with a grain of salt. And then she slowly started acting ‚Ä¶ like she was the shit ‚Ä¶ like people were after her cuz she was such a big deal‚Ä¶ that she was perfect‚Ä¶ and then all the drama before As passing‚Ä¶ and the after‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs been a dumpster fire. And I‚Äôve been curious to see how it all plays out and ends. That‚Äôs why I still watch her. 
It‚Äôs not that I like or support her. And I get by clicking on her videos it‚Äôs giving her support ‚Ä¶ but she‚Äôs not Amazon. She‚Äôs not creating mass destruction by me giving her money through a view. The only life she‚Äôs ruining is her own. From what I‚Äôve seen. 
I haven‚Äôt seen anyone say that the families of the cases she covers don‚Äôt want her talking about it. Like with Kendall Rae. But if I‚Äôm wrong please let me know. 
But yeah‚Ä¶ I thought about it and just wanted to put that out here.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) Alright, folks, gather 'round for the clash of the titans‚Äîor at least the clash of the ""we're pretty good"" teams. The Baylor Bears are set to face off against the Ole Miss Rebels in what promises to be a nail-biter, or at least a game that requires a second cup of coffee to get through.

Baylor, the No. 4 seed, is strutting into this matchup with a record that screams, ""We know what we're doing!"" They've been tearing through opponents like a kid through a pi√±ata, boasting a 28-7 record and a scoring differential of +624. With Jada Walker dishing out assists like Oprah gives away cars, and Aaronette Vonleh scoring like she's allergic to single digits, the Bears are looking fierce.

On the other side, we have the Ole Miss Rebels, the No. 5 seed, who are no strangers to the big stage. With a respectable 21-10 record and a scoring differential of +542, they're like that underdog in a sports movie who just might pull off the upset. Starr Jacobs is grabbing offensive rebounds like they're going out of style, and the Rebels are hoping to crash Baylor's party at the Foster Pavilion.

Now, let's talk numbers. Baylor is favored with a moneyline of 1.74 at DraftKings, while Ole Miss is the underdog at 2.14. The spread is set at Baylor -2.5, which means the oddsmakers are expecting a close game, but not too close‚Äîlike when you invite your in-laws over but hide the good snacks.

Given that underdogs win about 25% of the time in basketball, Ole Miss has a fighting chance, but it's a bit like betting on a snowstorm in July. Baylor's shooting prowess and assist game give them the edge, and let's face it, playing at home is like having a cheat code.

So, what's the best bet? Take Baylor on the moneyline at 1.74. It's not the most daring pick, but hey, sometimes the tortoise beats the hare, and sometimes the tortoise just takes a nap and loses. If you're feeling frisky, consider the over on the total points at 136.5, because both teams can light up the scoreboard like it's the Fourth of July.

In conclusion, expect Baylor to advance, but don't be surprised if Ole Miss makes them work for it. And remember, folks, the only sure thing in sports is that nothing is a sure thing‚Äîexcept maybe the nachos at the concession stand. Enjoy the game!

I tried Huano Iced Coffee first, because I‚Äôd never used a linear before, and enjoyed them enough that I put them in my gaming board instead (to replace the Kailh Pro Purples I‚Äôd been using). And then I popped the Durock Mocha Chocolate tactile switches in my QK75N.

I love how sharp the tactile bump is on them, but I noticed an issue very quickly. The spacebar wouldn‚Äôt always return after I pressed it. I disassembled the board and cleaned the PCB beneath the stabilizers, to ensure there was no lube on the PCB ‚Äúgrabbing‚Äù their stems, but the issue remained.

On a hunch, I pulled the spacebar and attached it to a Mocha Chocolate switch outside the board, so the switch would only have to lift the keycap. Even there, it would sometimes get stuck. This was also happening with my left shift, but only when in the board (so it was likely the addition of the stabilizers that caused the issue for that key).

I played around a bit, putting the spring from an MX Purple in a Mocha Chocolate switch, with no luck. And then I tried transplanting the MX Chocolate stem to the MX Purple housing. That was the ticket, as the issue was completely resolved.

So it seems like there‚Äôs some sort of interference in the Mocha Chocolate housing that makes it difficult for the switch to lift somewhat thicker, longer, PBT keycaps. It might be something to do with the design of the leaf, which seems to take more force to clear on the upstroke than the spring can generate while also lifting a heavier keycap (and maybe stabs).

I‚Äôd love to see this tweaked in future iterations of the switch, as it otherwise feels quite nice. I‚Äôm sure it contributes to just how much pop these switches have, but I‚Äôd gladly sacrifice a bit of that to preserve functionality with robust PBT keycaps.",1,1742750471.0,MechanicalKeyboards,1,1.0,False

1ji4et8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/1ji4et8/update_on_post_about_shadow_banned_user_questions/,Update on post about shadow banned user questions via mod mail,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/1jfv56l/frequent_issue_new_users_immediately_shadow/

After your comments here (but sadly none from admins) I have created the below template message to send to users who send us mod mail about not being able to post or comment blaming us when Reddit shows they are shadow banned. 

I am not 100% sure how accurate this is so would love an Admin to let me know if it needs tweaked, but of course if anyone else in here has comments or ways this can be improved please let me know. We get anywhere from 2 to 20 messages per week asking the same question and since they are shadow banned there is no way to evaluate if they are spammers or not and little else we can do (2 already this week).

------ template message follows ------

Unfortunately you are shadow banned by Reddit, there is nothing we can do. You can try posting in /r/WhatIsMyCQS or /r/CQS to check your Contributor Quality Score. 

Reddit shows [discussion about age of account], since we can't see your profile all we know is you were shadow banned at some point between signing up and trying to post or comment recently. 

Reddit often shadow bans new users who use a shared IP (i.e. library, school computer lab, work, coffee house wifi, hotel wifi, internet cafe, etc...) or VPN that another user has used to abuse Reddit in the past, new users who immediately try and post comments after signing up, and new users who immediately try and post links or other could-be spam content. 

If you are using a VPN or other shared internet network you might try and login using a normal internet connection from your home or mobile device. Do this for several days or even weeks voting on content only, do not comment or post anywhere. There is no evidence this will work, but it might be worth the effort for you.

The only known way you can fix your shadow banned account is by appealing to the staff at Reddit Headquarters using this form: https://www.reddit.com/appeals 

You can check a shadow ban by visiting your user URL (https://www.reddit.com/user/example) in any mobile or desktop browser (not the app) while logged out or using an incognito mode.

If your appeal is not approved in ~30-days try this:   

[removed by request]

2. Make a post in /r/NewtoReddit asking why you might have been shadow banned and seeking insights and see if your post goes through, message the mods and ask them to review and approve it if need be. You can check if your post is live by viewing it in incognito mode or while logged out. 

3. Stop posting or commenting for a while, delete anything you have posted that might sound spammy or includes links in it. 

4. Try posting an introduction in https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstPosts/ and see if your post goes through, message the mods and ask them to review and approve it if need be. You can check if your post is live by viewing it in incognito mode or while logged out.

(Note: Do not directly message any Reddit admin staff about this issue).

If your account is still not unbanned in 30-days try this:   

1. Create a new account but do not use a VPN or shared IP / computer network since it might have major issues immediately. It's best if this is a mobile device on a major cellphone network or a desktop computer on a major internet provider network. If you're currently traveling you might consider doing this once back home, as hotel WiFi could trigger security measures and possibly switching cities / regions / countries so quickly as well once you get home.

2. Do not post or comment for 3-days, allow the account to rest. This likely keeps the security system from trigging you as a spammer too fast. 

3. Go to a subreddit you want to be a part of and make one meaningful comment on a recent post. We recommend avoiding subs on more heavily spammed topics (ai, marketing, SEO, dropshipping, affiliates), NSFW subreddits, Political subreddits, Geo-focused subreddits, and private subreddits, and using one of the top tier general topic subreddits (/r/funny, /r/business, /r/videos, /r/askreddit, /r/photos, /r/aww, /r/iama)

4. 24-hours after making your first comment, make your first post in /r/FirstPosts introducing yourself, make sure you talk about why you joined Reddit and what content you will be engaging with / sharing. DO NOT INCLUDE ANY LINKS IN THIS POST, follow the rules of the sub, and do not use language spammers might use (i.e. fire or rocketship emojis, selling something, asking for DMs or other contacts, talking about your social media profiles, offering a course, etc...) 

5. 24 to 48 hours after making your First Post go to /r/NewtoReddit and make a post asking for advice on what subreddits you should join for your topic. 

6. In your first week you should have made one comment and 2 posts. Do not post any more comments or posts for 1 to 2 weeks and instead vote on topics you like and don't like in your feed and manage your subscriptions. 

7. After 1 to 2 weeks, start commenting again, but do not make any more posts yet. 

8. After 1 month has passed you may try making your first post, but text or content only (i.e. uploaded video, GIF, or photo). 

9. After 2 months have passed you can comment at will and can make a post or comment with a link as long as you follow the rules of the sub you are posting in. 

Once all of this is done your new account should have a higher CQS. Post in /r/WhatIsMyCQS or /r/CQS and see if your account is rated medium or higher, if so then try posting and commenting again here in /r/Example. Sorry this is such a difficult process, but Reddit works hard to ensure user accounts represent real humans and to fight things like brigading, vote ringing, and ban evasion and this appears to adversely impact new account signups.",0,1742750423.0,ModSupport,20,0.5,False

Hi, 
I have just found out them at my GF 36F off 18 months has lied to me about her relationship with her personal trainer. I am 38M He is a good friend of her brother. When we started going out she had been training with him for 6 months-ish. He was texting her asking her to go to samba classes and other activities. Weird I thought but glad she told me and I said ‚Äúit is a bit weird but I get he is a friend. I would be uncomfortable but I wouldn‚Äôt deny her doing something like with friend. She denied that there was anything sexual between them. She was very firm that she saw him as a brother and nothing more. She got very defensive at times and said that she still wanted to continue to PT with him as she felt she hadn‚Äôt finished training etc - This PT has a massive reputation for sleeping with his clients and having affairs and freely admits that he doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúdo‚Äù relationships plus even my GF admits he flirts all the time. Weirdly keep hearing him saying that he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt sleep with clients‚Äù. Anyway, GF super keen I meet him on some socials with her brother to show what a great guy he was. Fast forward to the present, she drunkenly admitted to me that she did kiss him (before we met) and meeting up with him to discuss a training plan. She told me that they only kissed and nothing more and he didn‚Äôt want anything more than sex and she said she wanted a husband etc and said it would just be training. Obviously I feel betrayed at the lie - more so because she admitted the next day that she wouldn‚Äôt have told me they had kissed. Apparently, her brother and family were all aware of this kiss and even worse, I was at dinner with them way back at the start of our relationship and I said that I trusted her but I didn‚Äôt trust the personal trainer. They all said I could trust her. 
During the confession she told me that she has had 3 affairs with married men. 2 fairly recently in the past 5 years and has been faithful since our relationship started. She is still friendly with the first married man she had an affair with and still meets up for coffee every few months. The affair ended over 15 years ago (she did tell me at the start of our relationship about him but said he was just a. Friend and it wasn‚Äôt sexual). The other married man was friend of her brothers and her brother knew about it. I‚Äôm not sure on the details on the other affair. Other than she has blocked him as he was very persistent that their affair continued.
This has now made me move all my stuff out because I don‚Äôt feel I can trust her and feel betrayed and a fool for being oblivious to all of this plus I felt quite angry and just felt it better to give us both some space. I did try to keep my calm and hopefully got my point across that it‚Äôs not about the kiss (we weren‚Äôt even together) but that fact that she lied to me and didn‚Äôt seem to have wanted to tell me. I‚Äôm trying not to be judgemental about her past but I just keep seeing all these red flags and I‚Äôm really worried about what our future relationship is going to look like. 
I also worry about her family giving her terrible advice about not telling me. 
I feel I need to get her to break contact with her personal trainer and the married man. I was going to ask her for her view about these affairs (not sure if she was in a relationship at the time either). Was also thinking about couples counselling to provide a safe place to explore these issues. Any thoughts or ideas how I can proceed or should I just end it now. Am I overreacting? I was hoping to marry and have children with this woman‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs making me feel sick thinking through all the options.

Buckle up bc this is a **long** but ***informative*** write-up. 

First things first, I know one of the immediate questions is ""bro, what were your NBME scores?!"" Well, here they are:

**Background:** 

* US IMG (Caribbean) 
* completed a masters in physiology before med school 

**Med School:** 

* Basic Medical Sciences curriculum (pre-clinicals) = 5 semesters
* my med school utilized a combination of flipped classroom style (online learning modules aka OLMs for lectures) and follow up Q&A sessions on said modules which consisted of board-style questions that were written by professors, BRS, Robbins & Cotran, Costanza, AMBOSS, etc.
* I primarily worked ahead as best I could to watch all the OLMs over a weekend and sometimes into Monday if there was a lot of material. Then through the actual week I would attend the school's Q&A sessions & do Boards & Beyond videos related to that topic we were learning and doing questions on that day. 
* My med school would have us take 2 block exams/module (total of 2 modules = 1 semester) and then we would do an NBME customized exam on that organ system at the end of each module.  These are NBME CAS (customized assessment services) exams that are provided to the school based on the type of questions needed by profs.
* My school also made us take NBME progress exams & Customized Assessment Tests to gauge our progress on mastering NBME concepts - which I thought was very helpful. Feel free to DM if you want more info on my experience w/ these exams

**Resources:** 

***UWorld:***

* From my experience, this was one of the best resources that helped me bit only on my Step 1 exam, but also on my school-administered COMP exam (CBSE). On my step form, I feel the questions were either slightly easier or equal to the difficulty of UWorld (from what I saw). Also UWorld‚Äôs explanations are really a textbook of knowledge that prepare you for the step exam‚Äôs love for pathophysiology & mechanisms of disease/drugs/virulence factors, etc.
* Always annotated in First Aid my incorrects from UWorld by adding their educational objectives or making my own tables about the information
* UWorld provided a similar length of your average Step 1 question in my opinion but some questions were even longer than UWorld

***AMBOSS:*** 

* During med school, my friend and I would complete the associated organ system-based AMBOSS questions within 4-5 days before taking our NBME final exams. so by the end of our basic sciences, we had almost completed all of AMBOSS. We would do all our incorrects on the last 2-3 days before the final. 
* I also utilized the AMBOSS Study plans: 200 concepts (did not finish), HY Risk Factors (did not finish), HY Ethics (finished). I only completed the Ethics one, and I ABSOLUTELY recommend doing this study plan as there were **a lot of Ethics on Step 1** (at least 10-15 question /block)
* The AMBOSS medical articles app was also VERY clutch as it acted like my more-detailed First Aid and I used it a lot for knowledge gaps in pathophysiology

***NBME Forms:***

* Best Resource overall, as it gives you an idea of all the concepts tested on Step. 
* Utilized the NBME Insights page a lot to pinpoint my weakest areas (See picture in comments)
* Compared to step exam, NBME does have shorter stems, however Step did have some stems that were comparable in length. Step isnt ALL long stems, but decent amount

***Boards & Beyond:*** 

* Like I said in the ""med school"" section, I mostly used this resource during my basic medical sciences curriculum to bridge the gaps in my knowledge from lecture. I only rewatched a few videos during dedicated on the topics I was really struggling with. 
* Dr. Ryan does a great job in teaching the information, although sometimes it's easy to fall asleep during these long videos. But, I think it gets the job done and was very helpful for pre-dedicated.

***HY Guru Step 1 P/F Course:*** 

* Overall a solid review of the most high-yield material
* Some videos can be a little repetitive, but definitely helps connect concepts in a very integrated fashion
* The course is mapped to NBME/USMLE Content outline
* There are UWorld QIDs mapped to each topic which was nice to test your knowledge after content review
* Vignette-style content-learning & flashcards to help w/ recall 
* Used for my CBSE Comp & Step for topics I struggled with but inly completed about 75% of course (6 month subscription makes it hard to finish imo)

***First Aid:*** 

* I will start by saying I NEVER read the full thing from cover to cover. 
* I only used this as a reference to whatever I was struggling with or to annotate very high yield concepts that appeared on the NBME practice forms
* Every time I reviewed a form, I went to the first aid section and typed ""**NBME**"" next to the section that corresponds to the NBME topic. After reading the NBME explanations on the form, I would also then read the First Aid section on it, as well as the material that was related to it or was another answer option on the form. I also added some information to my log (see below for more info on this). This is what helped me cover a lot of ground w/ content review. 

***Mehlman Medical HY pdfs:*** 

These are the main ones I used for COMP/Step: 

* [https://mehlmanmedical.com/hy-arrows/](https://mehlmanmedical.com/hy-arrows/)
* [https://mehlmanmedical.com/hy-neuroanatomy/](https://mehlmanmedical.com/hy-neuroanatomy/)
* [https://mehlmanmedical.com/hy-obgyn-repro/](https://mehlmanmedical.com/hy-obgyn-repro/)
* but I also referenced HY Immuno, Heme/Onc, & Cardiovascular (also found on his site)
* If you only do 1, do HY Arrows bc it gives you a solid understanding of pathophysiology, which Step loves to test!

***Dirty Medicine on YouTube:*** 

* Another ABSOLUTE must is the Dirty Medicine Ethics YouTube playlist bc he really helps you approach these questions w/ a whole new perspective:
* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JkRncMz9xc&list=PL5rTEahBdxV5szNYtMDCm7YuiG51WUnZV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JkRncMz9xc&list=PL5rTEahBdxV5szNYtMDCm7YuiG51WUnZV)  
* I watched probably 90% of the Dirty Medicine biochem section as
* I also watched the heart murmur video to help my detect heart sounds on exam day. 

***How to Deal w/ the Ethics Questions:***

There are a lot of Ethics on the exam so DO NOT sleep on this!! In fact, here is the recipe for success for crushing the Ethics on the Step 1 exam: 

1. Watch Dirty Medicine Ethics playlist (see link above)
2. Read AMBOSS's *Challenging clinical & ethics scenerios* article: [https://next.amboss.com/us/article/cF0aS3?q=ehtics](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/cF0aS3?q=ehtics)
3. Complete AMBOSS HY Ethics study plan in QBank under ""Study Plans""
4. Complete UWorld's Ethics & Communication questions
5. Read First Aid: Ethics & Communication section to reaffirm concepts

  
***The Use of A Learning Log:***

* During my dedicated studying period (7 weeks-ish), I started a PowerPoint presentation for which I called my learning log. This acted as a document of my incorrects/concepts that consistently reappeared on NBME exams/UWorld, diagrams/tables to remember high-yield but very detailed information. This is one of the best things I did in my prep bc it helped me address my weaknesses fast. 
* Overall, if I got a topic wrong, especially on multiple quizzes and practice exams, I would put it in my PowerPoint & then review this document every weekend to keep very high yield and detail-heavy information fresh in my mind. Iam a huge fan of tables and diagrams so I would either find or try to make my own (See comments for example).
* Once you are at the end of your dedicated prep, this document essentially serves as a very catered Rapid Review section right before you take Step 1. 

***Overall Test Experience:*** 

* Day before, drove to hotel & listened to Divine Interventions Risk Factors  & Screening podcast, which was helpful as a few did come up on my exam: 
* [https://youtu.be/Fa-CEdu6CjA?feature=shared](https://youtu.be/Fa-CEdu6CjA?feature=shared)
* Night before, I tossed and turned and tried to shut my brain off. Stopped studying in the afternoon the day before the exam & ate a nice italian pasta dish the night before to fuel the brain for the next day.
* The question blocks go by pretty fast and does not seem like an 8hr exam until maybe the 5th block, but I feel the dark chocolate covered coffee beans gave me an extra boost of energy to get the job done üòÇ 
* I took about a 5 minute break in between each block, until lunch time where I took 15 min. I liked resetting after each block to keep my mind fresh and to treat each section like its a new exam. 
* Questions-stems were quite long on a decent amount of them so manage your time wisely. Sometimes, I would have 10-15 min extra after a block, sometimes I had maybe 2 minutes. Be realistic on what questions you flag bc you may night have time to go back to them. 
* Overall, a very doable exam if you put in the work.  I can truly say you should trust your NBME exam scores & predicted percentage even though the exam was not really like the NBMEs in terms of style of questions. Free 120s are the MOST similar in question structure, length (although my form had some that were even a little longer), & concepts tested. 

If you made it to the end, I thank you for taking the time! I wish you all the best. Believe in yourself bc **confidence is so key**, not just during your prep but also while taking the exam. Even if you are not sure, make an intuitive guess & MOVE ON! You got this! I hope this helps. Best of luck! ",31,1742750152.0,step1,22,1.0,False

1ji48dp,https://www.reddit.com/r/britisharmy/comments/1ji48dp/glencorse_attendance_2025/,Glencorse attendance 2025,"Afternoon Chaps/Chapettes,

I've recently attended the AC at Glencorse, Edinburgh and thought I'd do a quick up-to-date write up of my experience, which may be helpful for those attending in the near future.

 Joining Instructions & Kit list.

Pretty much as you'd expect. Your recruiter will be in contact regarding travel arrangements. I'd say travelling by train is easiest as you'll be picked up from the train station at 18:00hrs regardless. I wore smart casual clothing - Chinos and a shirt (The same as I wore in the interview) to save space in my bag. Most people were wearing their Sunday best tracksuit which was fine. Nothing really missing off the kit list but don't forget a towel and a powerbank or an extension lead with 4 outlets would be handy as there's like 2 plugs per 18 man room. 

1st night.

Get picked up from the train station at 18:00hrs. Large plain white bus pretty hard to miss. Can mostly spot the lads/lasses also attending the AC so follow them if you're not sure. Staff will be wearing black shirts with Army insignia again pretty hard to miss. Have your photo I.D ready before boarding the bus and call everyone 'Staff'. Its about 30min to the barracks. You'll be given a number, take a pen to write it down, or write it in the notes on your phone etc. They did repeat it for people who forgot (several times) but im sure that'll be noted.
Once there, youll be sat down in a lecture room, chairs numbered - find your number and sit down. 
Paperwork/breifing from there on until the end of the night. In terms of school records - they have access to some national database for UK schools so if you don't have a physical copy they may still be able to find it. Seems like they only care if you've got maths and English, nothing more.
Interestingly there provided a hotbox of sausage rolls. 
Lights out for 22:00 - this is self governed so ensure someone takes charge and turns the lights off. (Think this is the DS giving you a bit of rope to hang yourselves with)

1st day

05:15 wake up - plenty of time albeit there aren't many showers. Down for breakfast, walked by the DS in two ranks to breakfast. Food isn't too bad actually. After this, it's to the medical centre for most of the day. Does take a long time so a powerbank etc is helpful or take a book etc. During this you'll be pulled away to conduct the medicine ball throw / mid thigh pull / cognitive tests. 
Whilst in the med centre we had a Sergeant and Corporal come in and give a talk / take questions etc.
You'll again be walked around to the 'scoff house' for lunch and dinner. After you're medically cleared to continue, you will head back to the lecture room and essentially chill out until everyone's finished. 
Once everyone's done you'll get given overalls and a helmet for the team tasks the following day and a few more breifs / interest lectures after dinner. 

Day 2 

05:15 again, square yourself away before breakfast. After breakfast you'll have 10-15min to get sorted for the bleep test. Bleep test is in the carpark on a slight incline but nothing drastic. Seems like one of the main tests as a good few high ranks (Majors / WO1) were watching. After this you'll have time to get overalls etc on ready for team tasks. 
Team tasks were actually quite fun. Little bit of problem solving and teamwork. Get involved, put some ideas up, encourage teammates and remind them of the rules. 
After the team tasks, be given time for a shower and get changed into your interview clothes. We were told they didn't care what you wear but remember it is a job interview so dress smart. Some had suits, others were literally in shorts. I went smart casual which was fine. Interview was very informal and went over your scores etc. They asked of very basic knowledge regarding phase 1 training, the ethos (CDRILS / PALs) nothing major. Tattoo policy came up but that may have been because I had tattoos. After this your given a score A through D and you're then free to leave. Was a pretty early finish we got away just after lunch - caught a bus from outside the barracks back into the city. 
Whilst waiting for the interview everyone had to get up and introduce themselves to the training team and group. Think the points were name, where you're from, what you're joining and why, interesting fact or joke. Then maybe a few questions.

Overall Observations

The staff were all spot on, even with the thick young lads who couldn't follow simple instructions. If you're an older individual you're in for an experience as majority of the candidates are under 20, and a few blackjacks short of a 10p mix-up. If you've got some life experience behind you, or are even remotely switched on you'll be constantly frustrated with the high percentage of mongs youll be assessed alongside, but its only two days and some of them were pretty amusing. Strangely enough there weren't many issues of lads staying up super late etc but I'd recommend ear plugs. Fortunately at this stage you're still civilians otherwise a good few troop thrashings would've been dished out im sure.
It was a lot more relaxed than I was expecting, but I think this is for them to assess how you conduct yourself naturally. They don't miss a beat - you're constantly being watched so be mindful of your conduct. 
Foods decent and you can buy more if you're worried about portion size, so take a little bit of money or contactless (Pretty much have your phone most of the time)
Can't have energy drinks until after the bleep test, nor coffee until after the medical so prepare for that. 

If you're going for reserves you'll find they may not have all the answers to your questions as it's geared towards regular soldiers. I think I was 1 of 3 going for reserves.

I expected the standards to be much, much higher than they were, both of the candidates (mainly fitness) but also of what the Staff expected. You had to keep your bedspace tidy but that meant put your bag under your bed. There was no cleaning, sweeping or anything of the sort - just simply putting things away after yourself, e.g paper towels into the bin after washing hands which some people still couldn't do. Fitness wise maybe 4 out of 30 odd got 11.3 on the bleep test despite a higher number saying they were going for paras. Some got higher than they needed, others fell short but across the board Fitness wasn't a strong point which I found bizarre.

Overall its not a bad two days, a very relaxed insight into Army life and a chance for the DS to assess your suitability for phase one training, which is essentially all its for. If you've prepared you'll find it an absolute breeze and it's certainly nothing to stress over. ",7,1742749969.0,britisharmy,2,1.0,False

I went as a solo traveler and chose Bibi‚Äôs group based on the group sizes offered. Right off the bat, filling out the form and contacting them through WhatsApp was simple and straightforward. They respond very quickly and provided info I needed. I stayed at Bibi‚Äôs hostel after the ride from Hanoi to Ha Giang. It was a good opportunity to get to know the group I was in and loved the group we were jn. We had 7 in our group and we each had an easy rider. 
Words honestly can‚Äôt express my immense gratitude for Bibi and the experience the easy riders wanted us all to have. Luyen was the leader and he was also my easy rider. I felt safe the entire time, even over some rocky paths that other groups didn‚Äôt go on. It‚Äôs the reason you choose these adventures, right? To experience that rush of adrenaline, excitement, and odd calm at the same time. All while taking in breathtaking views. 
Luyen always seemed to know the right time for stops. We had ample time to take pictures, rest, and have some coffee if we wanted to. I loved how he and several other easy riders were very intentional about taking pictures for their passengers and more than happy to take photos with us too. 
The food we had was AMAZING and it came out almost immediately after we sat down. They have this tour down to the t. Luyen and the other easy riders were always quick to help the restaurant or home stays serve us. The home stays were beautiful and scenery breathtaking. We also had opportunities to connect with the kids or local people. We had time to rest prior to our dinners, had ‚Äúhappy water,‚Äù and sang karaoke. We also joined in with some huge bonfire the town had one of the evenings. 
We went on a waterfall hike, swam, went bamboo rafting, and hiked up to some cave. 
I originally was going to choose another group but am happy I decided to go with Bibi‚Äôs tour group! The easy riders were so attentive. Luyen was really good about pointing locations out to me, some history, and information on the Hmong groups that live in Ha Giang, and always asking how I was doing/enjoying the trip. Ngl, I was a bit sad when our last day came around and wanted to do the loop all over again! ; ) I had a few conversations with Bibi after the tour and he‚Äôs a great guy. I hope he continues to keep the options for the group size we had. I‚Äôll definitely go back again next year. Thank you, Luyen, Bibi, Sing, and the rest of the crew!!

1ji47nv,https://i.redd.it/x1g5afk92hqe1.jpeg,Had this idea for a deck that runs a bunch of ways to buff Star Fruit to hopefully make it actually useful.

Reasoning: this deck runs 3 separate ways to buff Star Fruit to make it harder to remove and overall more impactful; Onion Rings, Pea Patch, and Lily of the Valley (only 3 of‚Äôs for Patch and Lily for less brick). 

Running Pod Father + cheap peas for early game tempo and second win con that works well with Onion Rings and Lily because the buffs stack. Coffee Grounds is more here as an environment remover than your own environment, and Bog of Enlightenment might work better for that but I don‚Äôt have that and it would cost another 2k sparks to run. 

Plant Food acts as a finisher assuming you get your game plan going and Flourish can refill hand prior to Onion Rings OR mid to late game as you start to run out of cards due to a lot of early game. 

Possible changes: Remove Pea Pods for 2x Gatling Pea for extra finisher potential. Could also change Fire Peas to Sweet Peas for more control in the early game without losing too much power in the mid to late game.

John does not control her! if he was controlling you would not have been able to leave in the first place! i find it rather controlling to block females from his phone when he's in the other room, you listen to his phone's calls etc. WHO ARE YOU HIS MOMMY?  

Shes back home to reality now she has to vacuum up two days of dog poop and pee. So she has to pull out the¬†sympathy card. Shes going to need a TikTok sister to send her money since she has no energy after cleaning up after Thor and now has a migraine after john nagging at her.

**Emma**

‚ÄúIlunor?‚Äù I turned towards the Vunerian, my two hands overflowing with thick paper bags stuffed to the brim with useless knick-knacks, a hundred and one cufflinks, and just about as many more gourmet pastries that could give the Paris Intrasolar Baking House a run for its money.

‚ÄúYes, earthrealmer?‚Äù He craned his head back, one hand holding a thousand-layer puff pastry baked right on the stick, drizzled in what was boldly advertised as a syrup containing a hundred unique forms of ‚ÄòCrown-grade‚Äô honey.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre burning daylight here.‚Äù I chided, pointing at the rapidly setting‚Ä¶ ‚Äòsun‚Äô, and the growing darkness around us. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve done nothing for the past thirty minutes but to delay us by going on your silly little sidequests around town.‚Äù I doubled down, only for the Vunerian to narrow his eyes, deploying a privacy screen in the process.

Following which, did he stop to *kick* me on the suit‚Äôs ‚Äòankles‚Äô.

‚ÄúHave you learned *nothing* from our conversations, Cadet Emma Booker?‚Äù He tsked.¬†

I opted not to respond.

‚Äú**THEATRE**, Cadet Emma Booker! *THEATRE!* The princess has made it clear has she not? That these‚Ä¶ *nightly outings*, are more often than not, thinly-veiled excuses made for the sake of attaining a reprieve from the Academy?‚Äù

I cocked my head almost immediately at that response. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre just building up plausible deniability?‚Äù¬†

‚Äú*Correct*, earthrealmer!‚Äù Ilunor beamed. ‚ÄúIt is an open secret that most *‚Äònight pass‚Äô* requests are mere fabricated contrivances. Thus, if anyone wishes to delve even *slightly* beneath the surface of our little outing, these *sidequests* as you call them, will serve as evidence for patterns of behavior in congruence with what is expected of such falsehoods. Otherwise, they will find the *lack* of any petty ulterior motives to be suspicious!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúPrompting skepticism in our activities to grow, hinting to a more *malicious* ulterior motive to our outing. Perhaps even sparking more scrutiny on our actions on this night.‚Äù Thacea reluctantly corroborated, prompting Ilunor to beam bright with self assured victory.

‚ÄúOnly in the Nexus would acting with decency and honesty be met with more scrutiny than the bold-faced acceptance of open lies and deceits.‚Äù Thalmin commented with a growl, capping off our little impromptu shopping trip into town, just as we arrived at our destination.

**Nexus. The Crown Herald Town of Elaseer. Ambassadorial District. Adventurer‚Äôs Guild Hall of Elaseer. Local Time: 1759 Hours.**

**Emma**

I hadn‚Äôt at all expected to see Sym the moment I walked through those double doors.

If anything ‚Äî and if Aunty Ran was to be believed ‚Äî this was perhaps fate in the making.

However no sooner did we exchange our first words did a polite and cordial elf arrive to greet us.¬†

A woman wearing what I could only describe as a fantasy renaissance take on ‚Äòbusiness formal‚Äô. With a long flowy skirt, coupled with a tunic with a puffy collar set beneath a beige-orange open-buttoned coat.¬†

Though only about half of her *receptionist* vibes came through from her attire. The other half was all in the way she carried herself, as she smiled and addressed us in a way only a seasoned front desk receptionist could.

‚ÄúGood evening, my lords and ladies.‚Äù She bowed deeply. ‚ÄúMight I be bold enough to assume that you are here for the Guild Master‚Äôs evening appointment?‚Äù

She kept things vague enough in order to not garner more attention than was necessary.

Yet specific enough that it was clear she was firmly in-the-know.

*We definitely missed this lady on our first pass-through of the guild*. I thought to myself.

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù I nodded.¬†

‚ÄúExcellent.‚Äù The elf responded with that perpetually cordial smile. ‚ÄúI will relay your arrival to Master Piamon and, if you so wish, you may follow me to the upstairs reception area.‚Äù¬†

However, before I gave my response, I quickly glanced over to Sym and the gang, my eyes narrowing at their‚Ä¶ disheveled state.¬†

‚ÄúErm, I don‚Äôt suppose that they also just arrived?‚Äù

This question prompted the elf to raise a brow. ‚ÄúYes, my lady.‚Äù She replied. ‚ÄúThough if it is the matter of their physical well-being that is in question, then I wish to allay those concerns. I can assure you that all present are in sufficient condition to deliver a detailed report on the subject of your inquest.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúOh, erm. Actually I should‚Äôve asked about that first.‚Äù I mumbled out, rubbing the back of my head in the process, before turning to the adventuring party. ‚ÄúAre you guys‚Ä¶ alright?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThings *are*, as The Receptionist has pointed out, my lady.‚Äù Sym replied instantly, raising an arm to prevent the bat-like Thulvahn from responding first.

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôve been through a lot, still.‚Äù I added, my eyes running up and down their disheveled, muddy, soot and ash covered forms. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to you guys taking like half an hour to get ready for the meeting.‚Äù¬†

This offer‚Ä¶ clearly took both Sym and his troupe, along with the receptionist by surprise.¬†

However, all were more than willing to accept this offer, as the man simply gave me a deep bow, before walking off and into some back corridors. Presumably to some in-house dorms.

‚ÄúIn any case, we will be more than happy to accommodate your wait up in the noble‚Äôs reception room, my lady.‚Äù The receptionist continued on seamlessly, as several vintage-looking baggage trolleys were quickly pushed our way.

My eyes, however, quickly locked onto the kids behind those trolleys as two of them were immediately identified by the EVI.

**\[N04 Garna. Trainee Adventurer. Desig: ‚ÄòSatyr‚Äô.\]**

**\[N05 Loris. Trainee Adventurer. Desig: ‚ÄòKobold‚Äô.\]**

The pair looked‚Ä¶ ragged and exhausted, sweat pouring down from the former‚Äôs forehead and onto his stained tunic, while the latter huffed and puffed up a storm. Their exhaustion probably stemmed from having to haul Sym‚Äôs gear and supplies prior to our arrival.

This disheveledness didn‚Äôt stop them from conforming to decorum though, as they both put on their best customer service faces. However, in spite of their best efforts, there was one thing they couldn‚Äôt hide.¬†

*‚Ä¶gurgle‚Ä¶*

Their hunger welling within.¬†

Which prompted me to take action.

No sooner after they finished loading the cart did I grab a few of Ilunor‚Äôs shopping bags, handing two to both the satyr and kobold, respectively.

‚ÄúHere.‚Äù I offered with a smile. ‚ÄúYou look and sound famished.‚Äù¬†

The pair, in shock, turned to one another with wide eyes.¬†

‚ÄúOh, erm. We‚Ä¶‚Äù Both of them stammered out, though it was Garna who finally won out in the end.

‚ÄúOur dinner comes *after* the senior and junior level adventurers, my lady.‚Äù He explained sheepishly, pointing to the west wing‚Äôs dining hall that was beginning to fill up with the adventurers in question.¬†

‚ÄúOh, so it‚Äôs like a seniority type thing?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, my lady. The guild master eats first, then the senior adventures, and then so on and so forth.‚Äù¬†

I cocked my head at that, as a disturbing thought cropped up as a result. ‚ÄúPlease tell me you‚Äôre not given the leftovers from the dining hall‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúNot here, my lady.‚Äù Loris responded this time around. ‚ÄúThough lesser halls have been known to practice that given their limited‚Äî‚Äù¬†

The elf suddenly paused at the behest of the receptionist who‚Äôd silenced her with just one stern look.¬†

‚ÄúB-but you needn‚Äôt worry about our bellies, my lady. We‚Äôre well-fed here.‚Äù The kobold quickly reiterated, though that did nothing to sway my decision.

‚ÄúGotcha. But, hey, just consider this a treat then, alright?‚Äù I countered deftly. ‚ÄúThat is, of course, if it‚Äôs allowed within guild rules?‚Äù I quickly turned to face the receptionist, who maintained a polite smile as she responded.

‚ÄúIt is well within the rules to provide gifts, if it pleases my lady.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúAlright then.‚Äù I hid a barely contained grin. ‚ÄúThen here‚Äî‚Äù I reached over, grabbing yet another one of Ilunor‚Äôs many treat bags. ‚Äú‚Äîtake this as well. Share it amongst your friends and whatnot.‚Äù¬†

A myriad of expressions formed following this.

With an incredulous one from Ilunor, a cordially neutral one from the receptionist, and two bright and beaming faces of the adventurers in training.

‚ÄúThank you, my lady!‚Äù They declared in-sync with radiant grins. The likes of which were infectious enough to make me feel all warm and bubbly inside.

‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt thank me. Thank Lord Rularia here for his charity.‚Äù I gestured towards the Vunerian, who simply turned his snout up at the whole affair. ‚ÄúCredit and gold where it‚Äôs due, after all.‚Äù¬†

=====

**Nexus. The Crown Herald Town of Elaseer. Ambassadorial District. Adventurer‚Äôs Guild Hall of Elaseer. Guild Master‚Äôs Office. Local Time: 1835 Hours.**

**Emma**

The slime‚Äôs room was just as I remembered it, save for the addition of a buffet table nestled haphazardly in one of its formerly empty corners.¬†

It was apparently customary ‚Äî and part of expectant decorum ‚Äî to offer both adventurer and quest-giver alike dining options if a meeting were to take place during mealtime.

And it was clear that *everyone* was taking advantage of this, save for of course, me.

Both parties currently sat opposite of each other on the two couches in front of Piamon‚Äôs desk, with the coffee table in between it used as a sort of ‚Äòmiddle ground‚Äô, stacked high with selections from the buffet table.¬†

Though, much to Ilunor‚Äôs chagrin, there seemed to be a distinct lack of tableside service.

‚ÄúThank you all for your punctuality.‚Äù Piamon began, choosing to remain in his slime form this time around. ‚ÄúThis meeting is to conclude the matter of the quest contract issued by one Cadet Emma Booker, to the adventuring party officially registered as Sym‚Äôs Troubleshooters. Given the quest‚Äôs unique nature, I will act as both arbitrator and primary witness to this conversation. So please, feel free to begin.‚Äù The man spoke politely, and in a surprisingly succinct manner for a Nexian noble.

‚ÄúThank you, Guild Master.‚Äù Sym bowed deeply from his side of the couch, his eyes landing on my visor. ‚ÄúTo begin, I acknowledge that all terms issued within the contract have been fulfilled.‚Äù Sym started, prompting the guild master to form a slime tendril to begin jotting down notes on the contract in question. ‚ÄúMoreover, I would like to note that we managed to fulfil the contract‚Äôs obligations not only within the allotted time, but likewise earlier than demanded. This grants us the bonus of fifty gold per day per person in accordance with the additional terms laid out verbally.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoes the quest issuer wish to comment, argue, or clarify on any of these points before continuing?‚Äù Piamon chimed in.

‚ÄúNo, a deal‚Äôs a deal. The base pay and bonus are still on the table. Provided, of course, full details of the dragon‚Äôs location are shown to us.‚Äù I replied firmly.

‚ÄúUnderstood.‚Äù Piamon nodded, gesturing for Sym to continue.

At which point, did he reach for a satchel, revealing a rolled up piece of paper, and several other artifacts I wasn‚Äôt at all expecting.

Some of which‚Ä¶¬† were caked in both soot and dried-up blood.

The table in front of us was quickly cleared of food, though only after some back and forths with a frustrated Vunerian, who compromised on having just *one* tray of treats on the couch‚Äôs side table.

Following this, the piece of rolled-up parchment was promptly unfurled, taking up much of the table‚Äôs surface area. Though thankfully, this wouldn‚Äôt be a problem, as Piamon casually *extended* its length through a small display of magic.

**ALERT: LOCALIZED SURGE OF MANA-RADIATION DETECTED, 200% ABOVE BACKGROUND RADIATION LEVELS**

What appeared in front of us now was a completely blank, though admittedly large, piece of parchment.¬†

Though all of this was quickly about to change.¬†

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get straight to the point.‚Äù Sym began, taking a knife and casually pricking himself on his pinky finger. After drawing a small splotch of blood, he began smearing it at one of the parchment‚Äôs far ends, causing the whole thing to begin‚Ä¶ *stirring*.

**ALERT: LOCALIZED SURGE OF MANA-RADIATION DETECTED, 300% ABOVE BACKGROUND RADIATION LEVELS**

‚ÄúDo you happen to have the ink I sent you, Cadet Emma Booker?‚Äù Piamon abruptly asked, prompting me to nod as I grabbed one of the vials the slime had sent along with the note.

Following its uncorking, the man simply‚Ä¶ *poured* the vial onto the paper directly.¬†

However, instead of simply spilling everywhere and causing a Bim Bim-level mess, the parchment somehow acted like one of those hyper-absorbent fabrics, guzzling up every last drop of jet-black ink. It was only after the whole bottle had been emptied did we see the true magic at play here, as the formerly blank parchment started *glowing* with life.¬†

Slowly, but surely, lines and map markers were drawn up. Grid coordinates criss-crossed the entirety of the parchment, followed by the sketchmarks of terrain, landmasses, and important natural geographical features such as forests, lakes, rivers, and mountains. The entire map had this‚Ä¶ almost *sketched* aesthetic to it, as if it was actively being drawn by hand. It was only after the roads, towns, and other such important man-made features were filled in that the aesthetics became more refined. Sketchmarks were replaced by clean lines, and splotches of shaded-in greyscale were replaced by a rich sepia tone.

It all felt like we were watching one of those speedpaint montages.

Though it took a solid five minutes before the whole map was finally ‚Äòcomplete‚Äô.

At which point, did it take me barely any time at all to realize what we were looking at.

This‚Ä¶ was a map of the entirety of Transgracia and its surrounding neighbors.¬†

A fact the EVI could corroborate, given Professor Articord‚Äôs timely introduction to the Nexus‚Äô political map just yesterday.¬†

=====

**One Day Prior**

**Professor Articord‚Äôs Class**

‚ÄúTo ensure we finish the class in a timely fashion, I will no longer be taking class participation. So listen *carefully* or you will surely be unable to complete this week‚Äôs homework.‚Äù The fox-like professor continued, as she pointed at both the blackboard and the growing magical ‚Äòhologram‚Äô in front of her.

‚ÄúThis, as all of you should already know, is the Nexus.‚Äù¬†

The Nexus‚Äô signature flat disc was both drawn behind the professor and projected in front of her.¬†

The blackboard displayed the disc as seen from above. Whilst the hologram in front of her displayed it from its ‚Äòside‚Äô, showing the various layers beneath the surface.¬†

‚ÄúOr at least, the *physical* extent of the Nexus. Everything within this mortal coil, everything we can touch, feel, see, hear, taste, and so on and so forth. *Astral projection* and the various *layers* that come with it are a matter for second-years.‚Äù She spoke casually, completely sidestepping that¬† ‚Äòminor‚Äô detail as we moved on.

‚ÄúGiven that this is a history and politics class, I will refrain from making grand sweeping discussions on the *nature* of the Nexus. Rather, I will focus on providing you what you need to know about its political organization in the contemporary era.‚Äù The professor quickly pointed to the blackboard, the hologram quickly disappearing, in lieu of the rapidly moving chalk pieces that now divided the Nexus into four distinct zones; resembling something that would‚Äôve been more fitting in a bar or a rec room.

A dartboard.

With a near-perfect circle at its very center and three concentric rings emanating from it, complete with what appeared to be finer divisions *within* the rings and circles. It was this *latter* detail that saved it from looking completely absurd. Instead, creating a sort of *border gore* that strategy gamers would probably blush at.

Though to be fair‚Ä¶ given no scale was given thus far, it *did* remind me of how ‚Äòsimplified‚Äô station maps and divisions could be.

*Planet-bound minds struggling to comprehend the beauty and simplicity of Spacer Perfection*. Was the meme I was immediately reminded of here‚Ä¶

‚ÄúAt the center of the civilized world, we have the Crownlands.‚Äù The professor quickly swung her scepter at the blackboard, coloring in the nearly perfect circle at the center of the disk. ‚ÄúHome to His Eternal Majesty, the Privy Council, the Royal Palace, the Royal Estates, the Royal Cities, His Eternal Majesty‚Äôs Royal Mandates, and the vast swaths of Royal Domains, Wards, and Provinces. The Crownlands was once the entirety of the known civilized world *prior* to the start of the Eternal Era.‚Äù

Both Ping and Qiv raised their hands at that, but were equally shot down by the professor.¬†

‚ÄúThe topic of the *Eternal Era* and the war which preceded it will be discussed on a *later date*.‚Äù¬†

This prompted both to lower their hands, as the professor moved on.¬†

‚ÄúHere, we have a region now known as the Midlands.‚Äù The professor paused, pulling out her scepter towards the first concentric ring drawn around the Crownlands.¬† ‚ÄúThis region, now home to long-established kingdoms and territories established following its incorporation into His Eternal Regime, was once shrouded under the malevolent influence of spiteful gods and ancient beings. Hence its former name, *the Outerlands*. Nowadays, however? You‚Äôd be hard-pressed to find any signs of this once-wretched past.‚Äù¬†

The first concentric ring was promptly colored in after that explanation, before the professor moved on, her scepter now hovering over the second concentric ring that surrounded the Midlands.¬†

‚ÄúThough as time progressed and as the continued its unending growth, so too did the Midlands grow far beyond its original extent. This forced a reevaluation and a shift in administration, culminating in His Eternal Majesty‚Äôs brilliant *Third Compromise* ‚Äî the establishment of a *new* Outlands.‚Äù¬†

The territory in question was now promptly colored in, though interestingly, a small circle within it was highlighted as if to emphasize her next point.¬†¬†

‚ÄúThis is where you find such places as the Transgracian Academy, and its host kingdom, the eponymous Transgracia.‚Äù

A part of me was both relieved and intrigued to see *exactly* where we were on the Nexus‚Äô ‚Äòworld map‚Äô. However, another part was equally frustrated by the lack of any clear map legends or scale markers.

Much to my chagrin, the trend would continue on unabated, her scepter moving back even further, highlighting an area of undulating borders *beyond* the Outlands.¬†

‚ÄúFinally, we have the unstable and still-forming regions known as the Farlands. There is little to say on this as it remains politically irrelevant. Thus, let us continue with the history of‚Ä¶‚Äù

=====

My eyes were locked onto the map of what I clearly recognized was the ‚Äòmiddle left hand corner‚Äô of the Nexus‚Äô discworld. Right around the ‚Äònine-o-clock‚Äô mark, smack dab in the middle of the ‚ÄòOutlands‚Äô ring.¬†

The location of both Transgracia, and the Academy.

Indeed, the map was much more detailed than Articord‚Äôs generalized depiction of the world, as it showed not just the Academy and the town of Elaseer, but also the entirety of the road networks that connected it to tens and hundreds more towns within this small chunk of an even greater, wider region.

I counted at least two-thousand towns and just under ten cities listed on this map.

A map of *just* the Kingdom of Transgracia. Not even taking into account its neighboring kingdoms, of which there were at least five which bordered it.

And when taking into account the relatively ‚Äòmiddling‚Äô size of the country in comparison to its peers along with Articord‚Äôs vague assertion of there being ‚Äò*tens of thousands more like it*‚Äô just in the western outlands alone‚Ä¶ the scale here was starting to balloon to ridiculous extremes.

However, I didn‚Äôt allow my mind to wander too much this time around, as I honed in on Sym‚Äôs annotations, detailing the path he took to where the dragon was currently holed up at.¬†

With a swift motion from what appeared to be a set of callipers, the man began drawing and annotating similarly magical brush strokes onto the dynamic map.¬†

The whole thing‚Ä¶ looked and felt like e-ink, similar to the ‚Äòmoving text‚Äô the Academy used on its letters and announcements.

‚ÄúThe amethyst dragon‚Äôs lair is here.‚Äù Sym stated plainly, highlighting a forest way, *way* north-east from Elaseer. ‚ÄúThe North Rythian Forests, a relatively young forest with little development near or around it, let alone *through* it.‚Äù The man sighed. ‚ÄúIt took us about a day‚Äôs trekking on enchanted golem steeds and monotreaders to get there. Though it should be noted that we *did* use the transportium network to connect us to the closest town to the forests‚Äî‚Äù The man paused, highlighting a town a good ways away from Elaseer to the far north. ‚Äú‚Äîthe town of Telaseer. Without the transportium? It would‚Äôve taken us a solid three to four days trek, perhaps even a week in rough conditions. However, from Telaseer, it should take you about a full day to get to the forest.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúAren‚Äôt the transportium networks only reserved for like, nobility or those with royal charters and warrants and whatnot?‚Äù I countered, recalling what the late Lord Lartia told me.

‚ÄúAye, though it perhaps is a bit less stringent than you may think. You don‚Äôt always *need* a Crown Warrant. Sometimes, just being a ‚Äòregular old‚Äô Nexian noble is fine and dandy for the odd jaunt or lazy stroll or what-have-you. Typically, most areas of the transportium are free reign for those of the Landed and Entrusted nobility, though there are *certain* areas that require *explicit* warrants from the Crown to access. For the most part however, the Outlands lack any of those sensitive areas.‚Äù The man explained, prompting me to cock my head in response.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm assuming though, since you‚Äôre *not* a Landed or Entrusted noble, that you hold a warrant?‚Äù

‚ÄúAye, of sorts. We‚Äôre *Crown-Registered* adventurers, see?‚Äù Sym spoke, twirling his fingers for the dramatic Thulvahn to pull out what appeared to be a rolled up document with an official looking seal on it. Unfurling it, a picture-perfect portrait of all four adventures were presented front and center, complete with personal details such as age, race, appearance, as well as their adventurer rank and title.¬†

All four of them even did a little dumb grin to match the grins present on their official registration, garnering a little snicker from my end.

‚ÄúI apologize for not clarifying earlier, my lady.‚Äù The man dipped his head down in a show of apologetics. ‚ÄúBut Crown-Registered adventurers hold something of a similar privilege, by virtue of our professions, in the free-rein use of transportiums, *within reason*.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúNo need to apologize, Sym. I was just curious.‚Äù I nodded, as the man promptly continued on from there.¬†

We refocused our attention on the map, now honing in on the local area where the dragon was. ‚ÄúIn any case, the dragon resides here.‚Äù The man pointed his callipers at the center of the forest. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt see it from this official map, but beneath the dense canopy lies a large rocky hill with a cave nestled next to a small stream. There exists no roads or paths that lead towards it, so we charted our own, and got within three hundred or so paces from it.‚Äù More annotations were made on the map, first around the dragon‚Äôs cave, then towards a path highlighting the most navigable route from the closest dirt road. ‚ÄúIt is about a thousand paces from the nearest dirt trail.‚Äù He clarified.¬†

More annotations were drawn, now highlighting the aforementioned dirt trail, and a series of meandering dirt paths that zig-zagged their way through and then finally *out* of the forest in question.¬†

‚ÄúGetting to the forest itself is no issue. But navigating your way *through* the forest becomes a bit tricky.‚Äù¬†

The dwarf took a moment to compose himself, his features shifting to something far less casual, or even professional, framing his next words as more of a warning than anything. ‚ÄúI must be clear about something, my lady. I say this with no judgement nor doubt over your capacity or character, but as a man who wishes to fulfil my duties to the best of my abilities.‚Äù He began, as he gestured towards one of the clauses in the contract. ‚ÄúAs this is a scouting mission, it is within my services to inform you not only of the *location* of this beast, but the dangers *it* and the surrounding environment poses.‚Äù¬†

He took another deep breath. ‚ÄúConsidering your armor, I doubt I need to warn you of the dangers posed by the spores of the forest‚Äôs mushrooms or any other environmental danger besides the threat of quicksand and mud pits. Of which this forest has none, considering its rather temperate climate.‚Äù He gestured towards the map, highlighting some areas annotated with rather toony drawings of mushrooms. ‚ÄúHowever, it is the dragon I wish to warn you of. Because the manner in which we secured the dragon‚Äôs location so quickly was through the unwitting sacrifices of others that came before us.‚Äù

The man finally grabbed hold of the scorched equipment from earlier, laying it out on the table, along with a surprisingly pristine cylindrical tube.¬†

Without wasting time, the dwarf popped the cap open to reveal the contents within.¬†

‚ÄúA royal warrant.‚Äù Ilunor observed in between sips of tea. ‚ÄúOne issued for the capture of the dragon, no doubt?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúAye, my lord.‚Äù The man nodded, bowing deeply towards the deluxe kobold. ‚ÄúWe discovered a literal *trail* of failed missions. Men-at-arms, arriving by the caravan. Yet none of them made it past the threshold of the dirt roads. It was only because we decided to leave our conveyances that we were able to slip past the dragon‚Äôs sight.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd even so, it wasn‚Äôt long before it saw us and chased us outta there.‚Äù Kintor quickly added, a shiver of fear coloring her voice.¬†

‚ÄúHence the scorch marks and such, no doubt?‚Äù I offered, garnering a nod from all four.

‚ÄúWe were only able to make it out of there because of the dragon‚Äôs‚Ä¶ *mercy*.‚Äù Sym postulated. ‚ÄúI assume it is *not* indiscriminate in its hostilities. For it attacked *caravans* and formations of men¬† at arms with great prejudice, but not *us*. I‚Ä¶ may be well into the realm of conjecture here, but I‚Äôm assuming that it chose to spare us, as it saw us as mere intruders rather than those that would do it harm.‚Äù¬†

This answer seemed to garner the raise of several brows, with Ilunor especially turning his nose up at the man.

‚ÄúThis actually begs a really important question.‚Äù I began. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre talking as if the dragon is intelligent and smart, but you still refer to it as an ‚Äòit.‚Äô Now, you‚Äôll have to excuse my ignorance here, but are Nexian dragons actually sapient? Or are they just ‚Äòanimals‚Äô?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre sentient.‚Äù Ilunor answered bluntly. ‚ÄúNot sapient.‚Äù He concluded. ‚ÄúAnimals, not *people*.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf I may, my lord, ancient legends say that a select *few* were, at one point, sapient.‚Äù Piamon offered, the greater slime clearly being the only one from the adventurer‚Äôs side of things that could stand up to him, by virtue of his own noble heritage.

‚ÄúThose were ancient legends.‚Äù Ilunor shot back. ‚ÄúAnd even so, those were, as you said yourself ‚Äî a select *few*. More specifically, the Great Dragons of the Vunerian Mountains who ruled over the kobolds and typical dragons of old.‚Äù The Vunerian sighed, taking a swig of tea in between his words. ‚ÄúEven then, their numbers were mere pittances. Moreover, this rare breed of thinking dragons were the size of entire *strongholds*. This amethyst dragon clearly does not fit *any* of these descriptors.‚Äù The deluxe kobold concluded.

I turned to both Thacea and Thalmin at that answer, the former of which nodded in acknowledgement.

‚ÄúAye‚Ä¶‚Äù Sym quickly added. ‚ÄúThe beast we met was certainly quite an intelligent creature, but not sapient. Not at all.‚Äù The man breathed in deeply, slowly sliding the warrant back into its case. ‚ÄúForgive me for overstepping my bounds once again, my lady, but I must ask‚Ä¶ what exactly do you need the dragon‚Äôs location for?‚Äù His voice darkened.

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúWe need one of its crystals.‚Äù Ilunor answered audaciously. ‚ÄúFor a school class project, and as a goal for our Class Sovereign gambit.‚Äù

That answer‚Ä¶ was actually *decent*.

Though it was clear Thalmin had *some* issue with it, owing to a sharp glance he cast towards Ilunor.

In a rare disconnect in our consensus‚Äô though, I wasn‚Äôt at all annoyed by this particular save.

If anything‚Ä¶ I was *impressed*.

Craning my eyeballs over to Thacea, it was clear she was just as impressed as I was at Ilunor‚Äôs quick thinking.

Because despite it being a bit‚Ä¶ *blunt*, it *was* a logical next step off of Thalmin‚Äôs original cover-story. That being, this whole thing was ‚Äòa personal academic matter‚Äô.¬†

‚ÄúI am, if nothing, a frank and earnest man.‚Äù He quickly added, forcing me to hold in a chuckle.

Nevertheless, as believable as that answer may be, the group in front of us‚Ä¶ was still nothing short of stunned by that answer.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd assumed something of the sort.‚Äù Sym sighed dourly. ‚ÄúAnd is it only one of its crystals that you seek, or the dragon‚Äôs head as a trophy?‚Äù He practically mumbled out.

‚ÄúJust its crystal.‚Äù I answered.

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm *relieved* to hear that, my lady. But at the very least, it takes the danger from near-assured death, down to extremely hazardous and life-threatening.‚Äù The man paused, leveling his eyes towards me with severe intent.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs *possible* then? As in, the *procurement* of a dragon‚Äôs crystals without actually killing it or getting into¬† a full on life or death fight?‚Äù I asked, prompting the man to pinch the bridge of his nose, drawing out a long sigh in the process.

‚ÄúAye, there *are* ways.‚Äù The man began dourly. ‚ÄúBut I must ask *again*, are you *certain* about such a foolish venture?‚Äù¬†

I maintained my gaze ‚Äî fruitless as that might‚Äôve been ‚Äî as I delivered my next few words without a glimmer of hesitation.¬† ‚ÄúYes. Now tell me, what options do I have?‚Äù

1ji3ymk,https://www.reddit.com/r/prediabetes/comments/1ji3ymk/prediabetic_numbers_after_a_year_of_anomalous/,Prediabetic numbers after a year of anomalous eating,"Hi all. First-time poster here. I was diagnosed as prediabetic early last month when routine bloodwork came back with a 5.7 A1C (up from 5.3 a year prior) and estimated blood glucose of 117. All my other numbers (thyroid, cholesterol, cortisol, etc.) were somewhere between average and stellar. I‚Äôm 34F, 5‚Äô8‚Äù and pretty lean, walk about five miles a day, and do two sessions of weight training most weeks. Diabetes runs in my family: All seven of my mother‚Äôs siblings and both of her parents have/had T2. My mother probably does too, but refuses to get tested. I‚Äôve also had PCOS since I was 17.¬†

I realize this is a long post. To save you the reading if you‚Äôre in a hurry, here‚Äôs the crux of my question: **Has anyone else been diagnosed as prediabetic after a prolonged period of unusually high sugar/carb intake and had the situation resolve after going back to a more moderate diet?**¬†

If you have the time and headspace or want more context before answering, here‚Äôs some recent history that may be relevant. I've bolded some of the text for easy skimming.

First: I went into treatment at 29 for an eating disorder I‚Äôd had for most of my 20s. Part of that treatment involved learning to eat foods without obsessing over nutrition labels, and to eat treats without guilt. By last year, **I was eating mostly plant-based/‚Äúmeat on the side‚Äù style with lots of whole foods, but also lots of homemade whole wheat sourdough bread and a big coffee-shop-style cookie, boba tea, or cocktail once a week or so.**

So bear that in mind when I tell you‚Ä¶

Second: I was diagnosed with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) last June, which effectively means I‚Äôm in perimenopause at 34. I was put on HRT and told to increase my protein intake. Here‚Äôs where I think I might have screwed myself: Remember how I wasn‚Äôt looking too closely at nutrition labels? Yeah. So, **I decided the most efficient way of upping my protein without eating more meat was to throw in a protein bar or two‚Ä¶every day.** I don‚Äôt own a scale, but going by how my clothes fit, I definitely started gaining weight. I found that I was constantly hungry and snacking on carbs to compensate. I had to pee even more often than usual (sometimes 4-5 times an hour), and my Raynaud‚Äôs got so bad that it was triggering even in hot weather. I feel like an idiot saying this, but the sugar content of those protein bars didn‚Äôt even occur to me as a possible contributor to the problem.¬†

So fast-forward to February of this year, when I find out my A1C has jumped half a point in a year and I‚Äôm now prediabetic. My GP asks me if anything‚Äôs changed about my diet, and that‚Äôs when I finally run the numbers: **I‚Äôd been eating (on average) an extra 25-75 grams of added sugar** ***a day*** **for about eight months, on top of an already carb-heavy diet.**¬†

And now here we are. I cut the protein bars the day I was diagnosed, and I removed added sugars and refined carbs from my diet almost completely. **I keep** **most meals below 30g of carbs or so and get about 130g of protein a day.** I also hooked myself up to a CGM to start testing which individual sources of carbs seemed to spike my sugars, in hopes of being able to avoid specific foods rather than cutting out entire food groups (which is both impractical and uncomfortably reminiscent of my ED days). I was already working with a nutritionist and trainer who specializes in metabolic issues with menopausal women, and we‚Äôve increased my protein with tofu, fish, and some lean meats, and I supplement with unsweetened pea and rice protein powder and nuts.¬†

I started using the CGM at the start of this week. My **morning glucose levels are in the 70s**. I get a spike alert within half an hour to 45 minutes of most lunches and dinners (including white fish over plain steamed cabbage), but the ‚Äúspike‚Äù has **only gone above 140 once**, up to 142 following 35g of that sourdough bread I mentioned earlier. It always comes back down on its own, usually within 45 minutes and always within 90. If I take a walk about half an hour after I finish eating, I can usually avoid the rapid rise entirely. I‚Äôm peeing way less despite drinking the same amount, my Raynaud‚Äôs is literally gone (even when bare-handed in cold, rainy weather), my clothes fit fine again, and I‚Äôm not hungry between meals.¬†

So if you‚Äôre still with me, here‚Äôs my question: In light of all of the above, **could I reasonably expect my numbers to resolve with a more moderate approach to food than I‚Äôm currently taking?** In other words: Any chance that just cutting out the daily protein bars and sticking to that ‚Äúone sweet treat a week‚Äù mentality could be sufficient to keep me in the clear without needing to continue monitoring every single thing I put in my mouth?

(Also, because it's relevant: Given my body composition and general medical weirdness, my GP is testing me for LADA. I'm GAD-negative, but my c-peptide came back lowish at 0.9...which the keto bros tell me might be due to a month of going low-carb, given that it was taken this past week. Still waiting on a couple of islet tests.)

We‚Äôve been working through our living room design for a while now. Our goal is eclectic mcm. Typically we do have more plants in here but a new kitten is terrorizing them so they are hidden away for now. The gallery wall is also still in progress. The couch is new and staying, so really working around it. The lower coffee table is also a new Facebook marketplace find. 

I‚Äôve added 4 pictures. 

1) our current rug. We‚Äôve been happy with it, but with the cream couch and light walls we thought we‚Äôd veer away from white rug as well. 

2) the rug we just bought and immediately weren‚Äôt happy with it when we laid it out. Planning to return. The coloring and sizing just didn‚Äôt seem to fit here. I also don‚Äôt think tribal pattern is the look. 

3) a runner we just purchased for the kitchen, but posed here for sizing and coloring comparison 

4) empty with no rug


Overall I think we are now leaning toward a smaller rug like photo 3, but really can‚Äôt decide if we should float it entirely or get one big enough to put the legs of the couch under. Color wise, we have a good mix of rust, orange, yellow/mustard, green, and teal.

Full disclaimer- this will be our first time in Paris (early May this year- weekday, from and return to London) but hopefully not our last. So we would just like to get a small taste without feeling bogged down with a tight itinerary or unrealistic expectations.
In addition to feasibility, and opinions on if we‚Äôre aiming too high or too low, I‚Äôm interested in hearing opinions on doing this via city bikes. We‚Äôre regular cyclists, so endurance isn‚Äôt an issue, but what‚Äôs appealing to me about the bikes is you get more of an experience than a bus/train.

The times are estimates based on Google Maps

*9:20- Arrive Gare du Nord
*10:00- Hire a bike nearby (Velib, Lime, etc.)

*10:30- arrive Tour Eiffel and surrounds, find a coffee and boulangerie 

*12:00-1:00- take scenic river cruise

*1:15-1:30- bike to the Louvre

Spend about 2 hours in the courtyard area and Jardin des Tuileries (not going inside Louvre as not enough time to enjoy)

*3:30: leave bikes near Place de la Concorde and walk along Seine meandering way to Champs-√âlys√©es and walk to the Arc de Triomphe.

*6:00: early supper near Arc de Triomphe

*7:30 arrive back Gare du Nord for 9:10pm departure. What is the best option? Bike? Taxi? Public transport?

Is this sane? In the general region we‚Äôre in, are there some good rainy day options? We don‚Äôt mind spotty weather, but these plans aren‚Äôt really conducive to a full day washout.

Captain Lir'Vex of the Cassian Resistance watched in bewilderment as the human mercenaries prepared for the upcoming assault on Governor Kel'Mar's stronghold. After three generations of brutal civil war against the oligarchs who had seized control of their world, the Cassians were exhausted, their tactics predictable, their resources depleted. In desperation, they had spent their last reserves of currency hiring a small battalion of humans‚Äîa species known throughout the galaxy for their strange mixture of primitive technology and inexplicable survival rates.

""Captain, with all due respect,"" said Commander Sarah Chen, the human leader, as she rummaged through a pile of scavenged material that the Cassians had considered trash, ""your tactical approach needs some serious revision.""

""Our approaches have been refined through generations of conflict,"" Lir'Vex replied stiffly, his four arms crossed in defensive posture. ""We've calculated every variable.""

Chen snorted. ""That's exactly your problem. Your enemy has calculated the same variables. You're fighting a mathematical equation that always results in stalemate.""

The human soldiers were doing the strangest things. Some were dismantling the temperature regulators from abandoned buildings. Others were collecting tubes of adhesive normally used for structural repairs. One was even harvesting the membranes from local flora. Lir'Vex couldn't make sense of any of it.

""What is the purpose of this... scavenging?"" he asked, mandibles clicking with concern.

""Improvisation,"" Chen replied with a grin that revealed her flat, herbivore-like teeth. ""The thing about humans is that we don't fight fair, and we don't fight according to the manual. Now, show me your intelligence reports about the stronghold's defenses.""

---

Governor Kel'Mar's fortress was considered impenetrable. Built into the side of Mount Xarian, it had withstood seventeen major assaults over the past fifty years. Its automated defense systems had been programmed with every known Cassian battle tactic. Its shield generators were powered by the geothermal energy of the mountain itself. The only accessible entrance was a heavily fortified checkpoint that scanned for organic signatures and weapon signatures simultaneously.

""We've lost over ten thousand soldiers trying to breach that entrance,"" Lir'Vex explained as they observed the fortress from a distance.

""Then we won't use the entrance,"" Chen replied, studying the mountain through high-powered binoculars. ""Tell me about the ventilation systems.""

""Heavily filtered and protected. They're designed to detect and neutralize any biological agent that doesn't match authorized genetic profiles.""

Chen lowered her binoculars. ""What about non-biological agents? Temperature? Sound? Vibration?""

Lir'Vex blinked all six eyes in confusion. ""I don't understand.""

""You will,"" she said, turning to her squad. ""Torres, what have you got for me?""

A wiry human with dark hair held up what appeared to be a hodgepodge of parts. ""Makeshift resonance amplifiers, Commander. Combined with the native flora membranes, we can create infrasound generators that'll mess with their inner ear equivalents. Won't kill anyone, but it'll make them wish they were dead.""

""Perfect. Jackson, status on the thermal disruptors?""

Another human, broad-shouldered and with a scar across her face, grinned. ""Ready to go, Commander. Once we introduce these into their ventilation, the temperature sensors will go haywire. System will think there's a fire when there isn't, or vice versa.""

""And the adhesive bombs?""

""Just need to add the catalysts,"" said a third human. ""They'll solidify any liquid within a five-meter radius. Water, blood, hydraulic fluid‚Äîyou name it, it becomes gel in seconds.""

Lir'Vex's antennae twitched nervously. ""None of these are conventional weapons. The defense systems will‚Äî""

""Not recognize them,"" Chen finished. ""That's the point. Your enemy has prepared for every conventional attack. We're going unconventional.""

---

The attack began at dusk.

The human called Torres released small, drone-like devices constructed from salvaged parts into the air. They hovered silently, carrying their makeshift resonance amplifiers toward the fortress's ventilation ducts.

""The filters will catch them,"" Lir'Vex warned.

""They're not trying to get through the filters,"" Chen explained. ""They're using the filters as amplifiers.""

Soon, the infrasound generators activated. Though inaudible to most species, the vibrations they produced caused immediate disorientation among the fortress guards. Security footage hacked by the resistance showed guards stumbling, clutching their hearing organs, some collapsing entirely.

Next came the thermal disruptors, carefully calibrated to disrupt rather than destroy. The fortress's environmental systems began responding to phantom temperature spikes, triggering emergency protocols that further disoriented the defenders.

""Now for phase three,"" Chen announced.

Three humans wearing improvised protective gear approached the fortress from different angles, each carrying what looked like modified agricultural sprayers. They targeted external sensor arrays and weapon emplacements, spraying them with the adhesive compound. As the adhesive made contact with the morning dew on the metal surfaces, it expanded rapidly, encasing delicate machinery in impenetrable gel.

""You've disabled their external defenses,"" Lir'Vex observed, astonishment evident in his voice. ""But the internal security forces‚Äî""

""Are currently dealing with what they think is a system-wide malfunction,"" Chen finished. ""No one's thinking 'attack' because none of their attack indicators are triggered. They're running diagnostics instead of battle stations.""

As if on cue, the massive doors of the checkpoint slid open. Security forces emerged, sweating and disoriented, some removing helmets to escape the phantom heat their systems were reporting.

""Perfect,"" Chen murmured. She raised her hand, revealing a simple remote detonator. ""And now for the finale.""

She pressed the button. Nothing seemed to happen for several seconds.

Then, from the scattered piles of refuse that her soldiers had strategically positioned days earlier, erupted clouds of fine, sparkling dust. The particles drifted toward the open checkpoint, carried by the evening breeze.

""What is that?"" Lir'Vex asked.

""Crystallized sweetener from your native fruits, combined with a particular pollen that your intelligence reports mentioned the oligarchs are universally allergic to. Harmless to everyone else, but for them...""

Within minutes, the security forces were incapacitated‚Äînot by lethal force, but by uncontrollable sneezing fits and watery eyes. The defensive formation broke down completely as elite soldiers were reduced to helpless, wheezing heaps.

""Now we move,"" Chen ordered. ""Non-lethal takedown. Remember, these are just people following orders.""

---

Two hours later, Governor Kel'Mar stood in custody of the resistance, his administrative center secured with minimal casualties.

""I don't understand,"" the governor wheezed, still suffering from the effects of the pollen. ""Our systems were designed to counter every known weapon, every possible attack vector.""

""That's your problem,"" Chen said, casually leaning against what had once been his ornate desk. ""You prepared for weapons. We used trash.""

Later, as the resistance fighters secured the fortress and began the process of transitioning power back to the people, Lir'Vex approached Chen.

""Your methods were... unorthodox,"" the Cassian admitted. ""Throughout our history, we've approached warfare as a science, a equation to be solved. You humans treated it as... what? Art?""

Chen considered this as she helped her team pack up their improvised gear. ""Not art. Survival. Humans come from a world where we were rarely the strongest or fastest species. We couldn't outfight our predators, so we had to outthink them. When conventional approaches fail, we improvise. We see possibilities in junk. We turn weaknesses into strengths.""

She handed Lir'Vex one of the makeshift resonance amplifiers. ""Keep this. Not as a weapon, but as a reminder. Sometimes the solution isn't finding a bigger gun‚Äîit's rethinking the problem entirely.""

Lir'Vex accepted the device, turning it over in his four hands with newfound respect. ""The oligarchs have controlled our planet for three generations because they controlled the narrative. They convinced us that liberation was mathematically impossible.""

""And that,"" Chen said with a smile, ""is why you don't send mathematicians to do a scavenger's job.""

---

*Three months later*

The Galactic Mercenary Guild received an unusual report from Commander Sarah Chen's human battalion‚Äîtheir third consecutive successful campaign for the Cassian Resistance. The report included a peculiar addendum:

""Cassian resistance forces now employing human-inspired tactics. Request additional compensation for training services beyond original combat contract. Also request extended supply of Earth coffee, as Cassians have developed a concerning addiction after observing its effects on human improvisational capabilities.""

The Guild administrator, a veteran of seventeen campaigns himself, chuckled as he stamped the request ""APPROVED."" Humans, he reflected as he sipped his own cup of coffee, had a knack for turning even warfare into a teachable moment.

1ji3xob,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1ji3xob/is_this_control_or_concern/,Is this control or concern?,"My husband (38) doesnt drink often and is not a fan of nightlife except on special occasion or when friends are town. I (32) used to be a huge nightlife person, and thats how we met. I did really enjoy drinking and staying out late, but since being married I have drastically (and happily) flipped that around. I'm healthier and more fulfilled overall so it's not something I felt like I sacrificed, but I definitely still enjoy it the few times a year i am out. 

Over the past year or so, I've gone out on my own a handful of times and come home late (which is fine in our marriage, and hes done it himself). The mornings after i go out separately, if I need to sleep in or he senses I'm hungover, he'll get upset and want to know how many drinks I had. There was one day where I couldn't give an exact number because my best friend and I had bought a bottle of wine, and he took it as if it was me being dishonest - leading to a big fight with my friend in town.  

For the day-to-day, I'll have a glass of wine a night and I did recently go through a phase where it was a glass of wine with dinner every single night. He brought it up, I told him he was right, and cut down to a glass of wine 2 or 3 times a week max. Zero acknowledgement on his end about how much I cut down btw, it seems like he's only happy to point things out when they pass his threshold of what's acceptable. It feels like ever since then, he now feels more entitled to comment... that's what I get for being receptive to his feedback üôÉ

Last night, we all went out - husband included, and some friends wanted to stay out. I hadn't seen my cousin in a while, so I stayed out with them - something my husband had zero issues with. He had a couple whiskies there, said bye, we went out separate ways, and I ended up having another drink at a bar then went to my cousins place for a bit longer, had one more half drink then came home. Basically over the course of nearly 10 hours, I had 5 full glasses of wine, an espresso martini, and another half drink that I opted to switch for water. I was completely fine and barely tipsy - as I do have a high tolerance and i know my limits. 

My husband is an early riser (I'm not) and he was up at 8am. He was sweet and making jokes, checking in on me once in a while, but I wanted to sleep in. He came to check in around 11am and asked if I was hungover, to which I said ""a little"". His whole demeanor changed, he was no longer loving or making jokes, he immediately asked me how many drinks I had after he left (to which i said 2), he seemed like he didn't believe me, counted all the drinks I had that night, called me an alcoholic, and suddenly it became an issue that I came home at 4. Now all the sudden he makes it sound like I stumbled home wasted at 4am. That definitely wasn't the case, I came home completely fine, did my evening skin care routine, and i was in the exact same state I left him in if not more sober because i had coffee and water. I felt like he was judging and putting me down for admitting I didn't feel 100%, and I got zero love or affection afterwards which just felt like punishment. Not a great way to mend a hangover.

Thinking back now, every outing I've had where I needed to sleep in or expressed even the tiniest bit of a hangover the next day - I get met with questions, judgement, and being talked down to about staying out late or drinking too much - and punishment through withholding of his normal affectionate self, or just a general harsh attitude. 

So today, I told him that he could no longer ask me how many drinks I've had when I go out, and that I don't ever want to hear about this again because it's now feeling controlling. He obviously didn't react well when I said the word controlling, but I'm honestly sick of being made to feel so much worse by the person who should make me feel better and be a safe space if/when I get hungover (which is literally a handful of times). I feel like i have to lie and pretend that I feel 100% ok and hide it so he doesn't withhold love or affection, which makes me not trust him in a way. Its like I can't trust to feel badly around him if he's going to make me feel worse. 

I grew up in a controlling and very strict household so I can't tell if his response is actually out of concern or if it's control? I don't want to throw out names or accusations if they're not true, but either way I also don't feel like i have to answer to him or be made to feel like shit if I decide to go out. I dont say anything to him when he goes out, and when i bring that up he says he doesn't drink or stay out late so there's nothing for me to ask.

Its my choice and I don't feel like he has the right to treat me differently for it, or in a way kick me when I'm down and not feeling great already. When I did tell him I need extra love on a hangover not harshness in the past, he said something along the lines of ""you chose to drink and feel like shit"" or in a way that it's not his problem, and it's the consequences of my actions.  

I don't need to be coddled or anything, but I just don't want to hear a lecture or get called an alcoholic first thing in the morning. Its super upsetting and I know he's going to think I'm overreacting at how upsetting it is.

Idk what to do or how to get him to understand it's not his business how much I drink, and he can't withhold affection from me just because I feel hungover. I never get wasted, I've never done anything stupid and I'm an adult that knows her limits. I'm so sick of it and I just don't want to feel badly around him. 

When I vocalized all this, I get zero response or remorse - he minimizes his questions and response and makes it sound like he just asked me a question. Wtf do I do to get through to this man. ",2,1742749239.0,Marriage,3,1.0,False

1ji3wlm,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_EmotionalSherbert999/comments/1ji3wlm/study_habits_and_how_to_improve_them/,Study Habits and How to Improve Them,"So I know that everybody feels that studying feels like a drag. But I believe that I have found and can tell you that with the right habits, it actually can be really effective and maybe even a little fun. In this post I'm going to break down some study strategies that can definitely up your game, and I'm even going to tell you about some examples so that it can be relatable to you. 

First off, I'm going to talk about creating a study schedule. Just picture this in your head for a second you've got a major test coming up, but instead of waiting till the night before to study, you decide to set aside some time every single day to study. This will be way less stressful for you. I would start by picking a few days a week where you can have a couple hours to hit the books. For example Monday, Wednesday, and Friday after school. Just grab a planner or even use your phone's calendar app to put that time down. 

Let's say for example, you have a math test on Friday. You could decide to plan to study for an hour on Monday to review the concepts. then another hour Wednesday to practice problems. You should always take short breaks when studying. I came across this technique called the Pomodoro where you study for 25 minutes, then take a 5 minute break. It will help keep your brain fresh. I would even say that you should reward yourself with a snack or a quick scroll through social media. 

Next up, active recall. This is where things can get interesting. Instead of just reading your notes over and over like everyone does, try to test yourself actively. Let's say you are studying for a history exam. After reading each chapter, close your book and try to remember as much as you can. You should even create flashcards with key events. For example on one side right Declaration of Independence and on the other write when it was signed. Then you should quiz yourself or even try to teach the material to a friend or family member. When explaining it out loud you'll be amazed by how much it helps you. 

Another cool trick that I have learned is chunking information. This basically means breaking down big pieces of information into smaller parts that are easier. So, let's say you‚Äôre studying for a biology test and need to memorize the parts of a cell, instead of trying to remember all the parts at once, group them. You could study the organelles one day, then the functions the next. It‚Äôs basically almost like putting together a puzzle way easier to tackle one piece at a time rather than the whole thing all at once.   


Now, now I am going to talk about your study environment. Finding the right spot to study can make a huge difference. Think about where you feel most focused. Is it your room, a cozy coffee shop, or maybe the library? Personally, I find that studying in a quiet corner of my room works best. Just make sure it‚Äôs free from distractions. I mean, it‚Äôs so easy to get sucked into TikTok or YouTube when you‚Äôre supposed to be studying! If you need background noise, maybe put on some chill music or use noise-canceling headphones. You could even create a study playlist with your favorite music tracks to keep you in the zone.

Don‚Äôt forget to take care of your body and mind while you‚Äôre at it! Seriously, sleep is your best friend. Pulling all-nighters might seem like the way to go, but trust me, it‚Äôs not worth it. When you‚Äôre well-rested, you actually absorb information better. Aim for at least 7-8 hours of sleep each night, especially before a big test. 

Also, don‚Äôt underestimate the power of a good snack. Foods like nuts, berries, and dark chocolate can help boost your brainpower. And if you‚Äôre feeling stressed, try some mindfulness exercises. Just a few minutes of deep breathing or meditation can help clear your mind and improve your focus.   
  
Let‚Äôs not forget about the importance of mixing things up! Studying doesn‚Äôt have to be the same boring routine every day. Try different methods to keep it fresh. If you‚Äôre studying literature, for example, read the book and then watch the movie. It‚Äôs a fun way to see how the story translates to film, and it can help you remember key themes and characters better.   
  
You can also join a study group. Sometimes, studying with friends can make things way more enjoyable. You can quiz each other, share notes, and explain concepts that might be tricky. Plus, it‚Äôs a great way to stay motivated. Just make sure you‚Äôre all focused and not just hanging out!  
  
Lastly, be kind to yourself. Studying can be tough, and it‚Äôs okay to have off days. If you find yourself struggling with a subject, don‚Äôt hesitate to ask for help. Talk to your teacher, a tutor, or even a friend who understands the material better.

1. Any customer that texts you about giving you a ""extra"" tip for whatever reason is LYING 99.99%. Only 0.01% might give you that extra tip they promised. So yeah, there's a chance.
2. Deliveries in wealthier neighborhoods do not necessarily mean bigger tips. People in more humble neighborhoods tip better has been my experience.
3. The later the night, the greater chance your delivery will be at an apartment, meaning that people living in these apartments for some reason i cannot fathom, eat later than people in homes.
4. People that live in apartments do not give AF that you have to climb up stairs and therefore do not tip any better than someone on the 1st floor or a home. They simply don't realize or ignore the fact that their deliveries are more arduous than a home. Amazing considering that is probably the MAIN REASON they ordered delivery - so that their lazy asses don't have to go up and down those same stairs to get food.
5. Restaurant workers do not give AF that delivery orders SHOULD have a higher priority when getting made - because those customers are gonna wait longer to get their food delivered vs people eating in the restaurant.
6. Most humans sleep in on weekends - and therefore eat breakfast much later - like 10:00am on Sat and Sun - heck I typically am STILL picking up breakfast at Denny's / IHOP as late at 1pm even which is crazy.
7. It amazes me that there are financially stupid humans that order a Starbucks drink and probably paid $15-$20 for the coffee+fees+tip. I'm guessing the total amount because the UE base pay + tip is frequently $7=$8 alone that I get paid - imagine adding the drink cost too. This is why you are broke. Is the coffee that good? No it isn't a Keurig or Nespresso is just as good.
8. On Fridays, starting with breakfast and lunch, the delivery volume goes up and at places at work. Why is that? Friday makes people feel euphoria that the hard work week is done and they survived ""yay the weekend is here"" - They feel like they ""deserve"" a treat like a $20 Starbucks or similar. Interesting human behavior.
9. People that order delivery ice cream are stupid. Doesn't matter if in the winter or summer. Winter is actually worse as i may have the heat on in my car. Nope, I'm not putting your shit in a cooler. I'm not paid enough to do that. Summer the same even though I have the AC on, there is always some melting involved. And worse when it is the first order out of two I gotta leave it in my car to go get another order.
10. I don't want to start a flame war here, but there are times (not always) where my brain tells me that certain demographic of people do not tip as well (if at all) as everyone else. I'll just leave it at that.

EDIT: You know what - never mind, I will call them out: Young people. Especially college kids. There I said it. I get it that you're broke, then you shouldn't be ordering delivery. Get your lazy ass up and get your own food if you're not gonna tip well. This is why I totally avoid anywhere near the major college campus in my metro area. Nope.

11. Elderly people I have found tip the best in my experience - obviously I came to that conclusion when it was a ""meet at door"" type and not just leave at door. I would also say that most of my deliveries to the elderly meet at the door are grandmas, not grandpas. Wonder why that is?",2,1742748905.0,UberEatsDrivers,14,0.75,False

I am finally at the point where I am making some lifestyle changes. One of those changes is finally quitting coffee. Has anyone moved to Coffee alternatives? My mother sent me a bag of everyday dose, which has much less caffeine and doesn't appear bitter. 

I am working my way down to zero coffee and zero caffeine. However, I have abused coffee for the last twenty years (I usually have a cup of coffee in my hand all day long from 8 am - 9 pm). At this point in my life, it seems more of a ritual than a conscious decision. 

  
Anyway, this week, I started with a single cup of coffee in the morning and a single cup of this coffee replacement. My goal next week is to replace my morning cup of coffee with the daily dose and move to a single cup for the day. After that, I plan to cut out all coffee and caffeine together.

I've been sitting here wanting to post (though not sure why), having issues with a title of all things, and what it would contain within.

As I sip my coffee, I am reflecting on conversations I have had with people in the past year, and how they all just seem to be surface level, and never getting deep enough to really know someone.

Being that this is online, I somewhat expect that, but I remember a time, just a couple years ago, where online interactions were deep, meaningful, and a hell of a lot more fun.

But my issue is not just online, also in person.  I feel like that human element is missing in my life, and I wonder if it's something that is just gone forever.

As they say, it's really not that deep, or serious...I am just a middle aged guy who has been alone for awhile now, and looking for someone to spend time communicating with.  I can't be the only one.

I am fun, light hearted, funny, and also do enjoy the deeper topics.  Life is hard, and doing it alone is difficult in various ways depending on the time of day.

None of this really makes sense, and I am just rambling into the void...but maybe it resonates with someone...if it does, let's share some banter. The weekend is slowly fading, and I have nothing planned. ",1,1742747843.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

Having confirmed where we were staying in New York I came across plenty of online love for Fountain Pen Hospital. Looked it up on the map and literally burst out laughing. It was 5 mins walk from our hotel in Tribeca. My wife is still finding hard to believe it was coincidence but I promise - it's true!

Of course we did the usuals - Central Park, The Met, Staten Island Ferry and the quite incredible 9/11 Memorial - but left a big highlight for our last day and came away with two pens that I'm calling Lady and the Tramp.

Fountain Pen Hospital at Warren Street. Not as overwhelming as the two London Pen Shows I've attended, but still plenty enough goodness to keep an FP person very busy for a very long time. If you have a non-FP partner it may be best to send them off for a coffee with the classic ""I may be a while"" message.

There's old, there's new, there's pens, there's inks, all beautifully lit in glass cabinets winking at you seductively, teasing that card out of your wallet.

No distractions, no muzak. Just the soundtrack of staff and customers engaging in the nerd-speak people like me get to hear in the wild so unfortunately seldom. And then there was the lovely Margaret, patiently and knowledgeably telling me exactly what I needed to know and supplying a long list of potential purchase options for me to dip test with some very nice Lamy Teal ink, which Margaret informed me was a 'new' re-release from Lamy. And this is where the Lady and the Tramp comes in.

The Tramp? Well I'd already decided I wasn't leaving this famous store without something from the pre-loved trays, perhaps a vintage Schaeffer as we're in the USA, or a very reasonably priced Parker 51. But then something caught my eye and I had to give it a try. It was chunky, it was heavy, it felt good in my hand and the Bock nib was a smooth writer.

Neither myself nor Margaret had good enough eyesight to examine the branding on the black and gold metal but for $40 this looked a good buy and I went for it. And just to keep my promise I did the research and it has turned out to be a Colibri Ascari. Yes, THAT Colibri. And nope, it don't light cigars. Some might say it's a shaggy dog of a pen. Me? I'm looking at it now and I love it.

And so to the Lady. Well my attempts at photography were woeful but you all know what the burgundy/ivory Pilot e95 looks like and I'd gazed longingly at the images for a very long time, especially that 14K inlaid nib. But here I was, able to actually hold one in my hand writing a half page of good old 'lazy dog' paragraphs nattering all the while about nibs, shimmer inks and other stuff that left my long-suffering wife with that classic 'WTF are they on about' look.

And the conclusion to the test? Well guns, wild horses and reinforced steel doors would not have stopped me leaving that store without that Pilot pen and I haven't stopped scribbling with it since. Beautiful to look at, even more beautiful to use.

So apologies to the internet but I'm just about done with buying online. For every time I pick up either Lady or the Tramp, I'll smile to myself and think of New York. And you just don't get to have fun like that clicking a button on Ali Express.

Thank you Fountain Pen Hospital.",5,1742747763.0,fountainpens,5,0.73,False

I would like to think that I outgrew that phase. That now, a decade later, I'm rememberable, that I'm interesting or desirable. But apparently I'm still not enough.

I'm good enough for a date, a couple hours of talking and ego boosting over a coffee or cheap meal, maybe a drink. I'm good enough for a fun night in my apartment. But I'm not good enough for a second date or for more conversation. I'm not good enough for them to stay or to try again.

Maybe I'm just easy, maybe I'm just too dull and boring. I don't know.

But I know I'm tired of not being good enough, of hearing ""I would love to take you out again"" or ""We should keep in touch"" or ""I wish I could stay longer"", and then having them vanish from the face of the earth. 

I'm scared that, no matter what, I'll always be that same person, the one that is always enough for a few hours of fun but not for anything else. That all I have to offer are those fleeting moments that leave me feeling hollow once they're gone.

I know there‚Äôs a million posts everywhere of how to lose weight and you pull your hair out trying to compare which is correct. I think this over complicates the matter.

Instead of focusing on people telling you ‚Äúthe best way to do it,‚Äù focus on yourself and your habits. Your mind is self sufficient, if you have any sort of basic education, you don‚Äôt need more than that.

I am very lazy. I would never have been able to accomplish these goals if I was following someone else‚Äôs plan. In order to lose fat, there are some basic things to know, and then you just live your life moving forward with these things in the back of your head:

1. Salads with every meal are the #1 way to keep calories low. If you do a protein source + a salad, you will feel full long term.

2. If you want to be in a calorie deficit everyday, find a way to eat two meals instead of three. I am a glutton. I cannot eat a meal with barely anything on the plate. If you can try, drink a black coffee instead of a meal. Caffeine suppresses appetite and it‚Äôs 0 calories.

3. Foods that are worth the calories don‚Äôt come out of a box. Boxed food is formulated by scientists to give you most bang (calories) for the buck (bites). Don‚Äôt trust packaged food that says it‚Äôs healthy (it‚Äôs not). Healthy and balanced food is grown out of the ground, or eats something grown out of the ground. Food from nature is naturally balanced. For instance, a carb dense food contains a lot of fiber in nature. Not BS boxed food. This topic pisses me off, if you can‚Äôt tell, sorry for the rant.

4. Walk. It is so easy, if you don‚Äôt have a disability of course. You don‚Äôt need to exercise crazy if you are morbidly obese like I was. Walk everyday. Start with 20 mins, then 30 mins, then go an hour. Find any excuse to walk, park far away from the store and walk the extra distance. The thing is, we want simple things we can do and not stress over them. You can walk everyday. It‚Äôs not hard, and it feels good, both physically and mentally. Most of your weight loss will come from food, but going on hour long walks( which can be broken up) will add a little extra boost. Do you watch tv or podcasts at home on the couch? You can do that while walking too, and might as well, for your general health.

And that‚Äôs it: salads, skip meals w/ coffee, natural food, walking. Paired with the knowledge that everyone‚Äôs body will lose fat if you spend more energy just being alive than you eat everyday, you can do it. 

Weight loss is not easy, but it is simple. Especially if you‚Äôre obese, by eating less you‚Äôre conditioning your body to run off stored fat. By walking you‚Äôre boosting this process. 

Get into a routine, then focus on your work or what‚Äôs important; not food. The more you can not focus on food, the easier it will be to lose weight and not think about it.

I‚Äôm not an expert, just a guy that learned basic things and used it to turn his life around. Hope this helps. Good luck!",112,1742747427.0,WeightLossAdvice,47,0.87,False

I asked her if she wanted me to buy her more data and she did not. 

I asked her how much her cell plan is for the month and she said about $3.50 US for the month. She makes about $3,500 US per month salary and an additional $2,000 per month in company stock. Adding data would cost less than her monthly bill.

$3 is nothing to either of us so I do not understand why but this data is a big deal.

It feels like such a trivial amount that it shouldn‚Äôt have even been mentioned as a problem. 

Some background on the relationship. We have met in person more than once in both countries. We have been together in person for very extended periods. A few days ago she asked me when I was going to ask her to marry me.

A little vent and further inquiries‚Ä¶DPO11 without even a squinter. Second IUI and while I know I am not quite out of the game yet‚Ä¶.I just feel pre-devastated. Years of trying without professional assistance and now possibly facing a second negative with the help of the pros. The same pros who advised due to my age of 33 (34 soon), low AMH, endometriosis and wishing for 3 kids we should jump RIGHT into IVF. We can‚Äôt afford that. 

I had reasons to hope IUI wouldn‚Äôt be the worst to try for a few rounds; my partner struggles to finish but has great numbers when he does. So I thought after my incision surgery and clean slate (elite specialists out of Jacksonville Florida!) endometriosis wise that we may fair well with IUI.

Here we are on round two of four (before I guess the chances are nill with further IUIs) and I am sure in my gut this isn‚Äôt the cycle. Cost is adding up too, of course.

I will only feel better if I have a SOLID plan of attack beyond IUI. That may mean leaving my current job as a high school teacher‚Ä¶for multiple reasons. To mitigate stress on my mind, body, and heart (y‚Äôall have read the headlines‚Ä¶this job is wildly demanding and stress inducing‚Ä¶plus many in my state, Florida, are becoming straight up hostile towards us for simply doing this already mental health crushing job..so I am stressed to the max) and to secure coverage for IVF.

I don‚Äôt regret trying IUI first but it is looking like IVF will end up our route. Starbucks is the most recommended employer for this and I LOVE that you can qualify part time! That would allow me to build a tutoring business and still contribute to world of education in some capacity! It feels PERFECT! 

Hoping this post can help me learn and prepare for what THAT process looks like. 

‚Ä¢ Do you work the 20 hour a week minimum and it is like medical insurance (after you qualify for it) in the sense of deductibles and copays through the treatments? 

‚Ä¢ Or do you pay out of pocket for the IVF process and they reimburse you? 

‚Ä¢ I have worked in tourist, crazy fast paced, server jobs, for those that have done both‚Ä¶comparisons? How stressful is being a barista with long lines and drive throughs? I am not tooo worried about the job being stressful for treatments wise‚Ä¶can‚Äôt be any worse than being a teacher right now‚Ä¶hopefully better‚Ä¶just curious here.

‚Ä¢ Random question‚Ä¶are the machines loud? The expresso machine at a breakfast joint I worked at once destroyed my nerves ha-ha but I am sure I could adapt if I need to. Just curious how loud a pure coffee shop is. 

‚Ä¢ Anyone familiar with any national breakfast chains that close in the afternoon and offer IVF coverage? That would pair well with my tutoring plan if so. 

I guess those are all of my questions. 

Thank you in advance to any baristas who can help this discouraged, but hopeful, future momma out with answers, insights, guidance, or any troubleshooting to help me refine my plan B and feel better for the future.

‚ÄòCertainly.‚Äô Irena began, mechanically extending a leaflet before freezing. Her gaze lifted, and those eerie, depthless eyes fixed on his Guardsman‚Äôs collar pin. ‚ÄòAh. Elia‚Äôs brother. Jord, yes?‚Äô Her smile didn‚Äôt touch her eyes.

‚ÄòGuilty,‚Äô he said, forcing a grin. ‚ÄòApologies for last time. Was‚Ä¶ adjusting. Got squeezed dry. You must be Irena, right?‚Äô

‚ÄòIrena Valana.‚Äô She tilted her head. ‚ÄòA handshake‚Äôs traditional, but‚Ä¶‚Äô She lifted the stack in her arms, shrugging. ‚ÄòYou‚Äôve the look of a man circling Avrosi‚Äôs drain.‚Äô

Jord snorted. ‚ÄòMore right than you know.‚Äô

‚ÄòMerely observant.‚Äô She said, the streetlamp catching the wire frames of her spectacles. ‚ÄòTell Elia I‚Äôve those erosion metrics he requested. Matters of‚Ä¶  public infrastructure.‚Äô

A beat. Jord‚Äôs smile stiffened. ‚ÄòWill do.‚Äô

‚ÄòPleasure, Guardsman.‚Äô She turned back to the street.

Jord walked faster than necessary, the pamphlet crumpling in his grip. Three streets later, he glanced down.

Public trust in Southern Thamburg.

He laughed, the sound brittle. The hell are you mixed up in, Elia?

Jord arrived home at precisely 19:23, the evening air still clinging to his skin as he shut the door behind him. The scent of ink and paper thickened the air ‚Äì Elia hunched over his notebook again, utterly absorbed in whatever it was that occupied his restless mind. Jord, curiosity piqued, wandered over and peered over his younger brother‚Äôs shoulder, noting a meticulously structured table filled with names and addresses.

‚ÄòShould I be worried about this?‚Äô Jord asked dryly, his voice laced with playful suspicion.

Elia, startled, snapped the notebook shut with an audible thud, blinking up at Jord as if he'd only just realised he wasn‚Äôt alone. ‚ÄòBloody hell, you scared me! I didn‚Äôt even hear you come in.‚Äô

Jord smirked and tossed the pamphlet onto the table. ‚ÄòYou were too busy scribbling your secret schemes to notice. What‚Äôs this all about, anyway? You planning a grand heist?‚Äô

‚ÄòWhat? No!‚Äô Elia replied, before narrowing his eyes. ‚ÄòWhy are you home so late?‚Äô

Jord rolled his shoulders and let out a weary sigh. ‚ÄòLapo. That devil of a man decided I hadn‚Äôt suffered enough. Had me training and training and training, despite the fact I‚Äôve felt like I‚Äôve been hit by a car all day.‚Äô

Elia shrugged, insufferably smug. ‚ÄòSounds like a you problem.‚Äô

Jord scoffed. ‚ÄòSays the man who‚Äôd faint at five press-ups.‚Äô

Elia simply shrugged, an insufferable smirk on his lips. But then his gaze drifted downwards, taking in Jord‚Äôs attire. ‚ÄòSo you finally received the seal of approval, huh.‚Äô

Jord said nothing but merely nodded in confirmation.

Elia folded his arms. ‚ÄòAnd what about weapons? Do they just hand you a gun and hope for the best?‚Äô

Jord let out a short laugh. ‚ÄòNot quite. I‚Äôll be issued one after six months of tutoring. Can‚Äôt have me brandishing steel around like an idiot, can they?‚Äô

‚ÄòMmh. Suppose not.‚Äô Elia leaned back, stretching his arms over his head. ‚ÄòMum and Dad are home, by the way.‚Äô

‚ÄòGood,‚Äô Jord replied, making his way towards the kitchen. His stomach had begun to protest quite violently, and he wasn‚Äôt in the mood to argue with it. He rummaged through the cabinets, pulling together whatever ingredients he could scrounge up. ‚ÄòYou eaten yet?‚Äô

Elia shook his head. ‚ÄòAte outside earlier. You‚Äôre on your own.‚Äô

Jord frowned as he opened the fridge, noting the lack of essentials. ‚ÄòGreat. My payslip can‚Äôt come soon enough.‚Äô He muttered under his breath.

After throwing together a quick meal, Jord ate in silence, fatigue weighing down on him like a lead blanket. When he was finished, he bid Elia a half-hearted goodnight before moving on to the tedious task of washing his clothes. He tossed them into the washer, then carried them outside, on the small garden his house come by, to hang them on the line, the cool night air biting at his skin.

Morning arrived with no mercy. The aches from the previous day had settled into his bones, a continuous, nagging nuisance. He dragged himself into the shower, hoping the hot water would ease his discomfort ‚Äì only for the boiler to sputter and fail on him once again.

‚ÄòElia!‚Äô he bellowed, voice reverberating through the house. ‚ÄòRestart the bloody boiler, will you?‚Äô

A few moments later, it roared back to life. Jord sighed in relief, muttering a quiet ‚Äòfinally‚Äô before finishing up and heading to the kitchen.

He brewed himself a coffee, only to find their supply worryingly low. Grimacing, he tore a piece of paper from a notepad and scrawled a list of necessities. He‚Äôd stop by the market later ‚Äì no sense in waiting until they were scraping the bottom of the barrel.

With that, he downed his coffee, braced himself for another long day, and stepped out the door.

The walk was, peculiar. Thamburg wore strangeness like a sodden overcoat. Newsagents bolted their grilles too early; pensioners clustered at tram stops with furtive glances. Even the stray dogs seemed hushed, tails tucked as if sensing artillery in the wind.

Mara intercepted Jord at the garrison gates, her blouse straining at the seams. ‚ÄòMorning, Whittaker. Got a whisper from the Ministry,‚Äô she murmured, breath clouding in the damp air. ‚ÄòLavitii‚Äôs reforging their cannon foundries. Velmara is sending instructors to train.‚Äô

Jord‚Äôs gut soured. ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs that to us?‚Äô To me.

‚ÄòYou‚Äôre on reserve now ‚Äì ""mobilisation"", they called it. ""Just in case"".‚Äô Her smile could‚Äôve chiselled ice. ‚ÄòDo yourself a favour and keep a low profile. Because if you slip up, it won‚Äôt be the Guard‚Äôs Bureau you‚Äôll have to fear ‚Äì it‚Äôll be the court-martial.‚Äô

He thanked her, but the words felt ash in his throat.

Lapo materialised at the training field, eyes lit with a zealot‚Äôs fire. His fist closed around Jord‚Äôs shoulder, calluses grating like gravel. ‚ÄòTime to trade calluses for calibre,‚Äô he growled, thrusting a practice sabre into Jord‚Äôs hands. Its grip felt alien, treacherous.

A sword? The man rants about weapons, and he hands me this? Has the sun baked his brain? Jord cast Lapo a wary glance.

Across the yard, Jory drilled recruits in bayonet work. Krane and Jord gazes met ‚Äì Jord braced for venom ‚Äì but the man merely dipped his chin, a curt nod acknowledging shared conscription to folly.

By dusk, Jord‚Äôs palms bloomed with blisters, each parry and thrust a fresh argument against existence. As he limped past Irena‚Äôs pamphlet stall, her gaze hooked into him ‚Äì sharp, appraising. The uniform scrubbed his neck raw, its wool now a convict‚Äôs brand.

Malkiri‚Äôs shop smelled of spice, old wood, and the faint tang of cured meat. Jord placed a few essentials on the counter ‚Äì bread, milk, eggs, a small wedge of cheese, coffee, sugar.

Malkiri, a stout man with greying hair and a nose like a hawk‚Äôs beak, eyed the goods, then eyed Jord. ‚ÄòOn credit, is it?‚Äô he said, his Velmaran accent curling around the words.

Jord exhaled, rubbing the back of his neck. ‚ÄòJust till my payslip comes through.‚Äô

Malkiri chuckled, shaking his head as he began bagging the items. ‚ÄòSome things never change. I remember a scruffy lad who‚Äôd dart in here, pockets empty, promising to pay me back ‚Äúsoon‚Äù.‚Äô

Jord smirked. ‚ÄòAnd I always did.‚Äô

‚ÄòAye, eventually.‚Äô Malkiri slid the goods across the counter. ‚ÄòGo on, then. Just don‚Äôt make me chase you down, Guardsmen or not.‚Äô

Jord grabbed the bag with a nod. ‚ÄòWouldn‚Äôt dream of it.‚Äô

‚ÄòGive your folks my regards. Have a good evening.‚Äô

‚ÄòWill do. You too, Malk,‚Äô Jord said, lifting a hand in farewell before stepping out of the mini-market.

The trudge home grew quieter still. Shuttered windows, hunched crowds ‚Äì Thamburg‚Äôs streets had the air of a city counting coins in the dark. Jord sidestepped a telecoms van, its logo faded but legible: Velmar Networks  ‚Äì  Connecting Futures. A bitter joke. They‚Äôd privatised the infrastructure, then priced its carcass beyond reach. Bandwidth taxed, copper wires left to corrode; only corporate bulletins and union-busting notices now slid through the cracks. For a while, folk had clung to black-market burner phones, but the tariffs strangled even those.

And many still kept their televisions, relics of a more connected time, but the steady decay of infrastructure had made their use prohibitively expensive. Channels lurked behind layers of paywalls, each more demanding than the last. Even the public broadcast service, once the pride of all Meridia, had fallen to private interests, its formerly rich programming replaced by hollow messages and meaningless spectacle. The screens that had once united the nation now served only as dark mirrors in countless homes, reflecting the dimmed hopes of their owners. Now, only national papers held sway over the public opinion, their pages carefully curated to silence dissenting voices while trumpeting the supposed greatness of the National Party of Resistance and its dubious accomplishments.

Jord remembered the day he'd started comparing newspapers, an idle habit that turned poisonous. Five different publications, five identical narratives but differing wording ‚Äì until he found that one aberrant copy. Its pages had dared to question Nasar's grip on Thamburg's power grid, backing claims with engineers' testimonies and maintenance records. The paper made to vanish within days, its publishers buried under an avalanche of defamation suits. Their reputations were methodically dismantled, their families' names dragged through carefully orchestrated mud. He'd watched it all unfold in the 'reputable' press, each headline a fresh nail in truth's coffin.

That's when the pattern revealed itself ‚Äì like noticing a crack in glass, impossible to miss. Every headline since carried the stench of boardroom approval, each story a sculpture of selective facts and patriotic flourishes. The morning papers carefully sent to bars and gazette alike, much like love letters from a liar, people couldn‚Äôt do without, and Jord had learned to read between their pristine lines, tasting the artificial sweetness of each carefully crafted truth.

The sight of his front door snapped Jord back to the present. He fumbled in his pockets for keys, the metal teeth biting into his palm as he turned the lock. Inside, darkness. No clatter of pans, no murmur of Elia‚Äôs late-night theorising ‚Äì just the hum of the fridge. His parents always kept the hallway lamp lit. Always.

‚ÄòElia?‚Äô His voice echoed off the walls.

Nothing.

He paced back and forth in the cramped hallway, shadow warping grotesquely under the lone bulb he‚Äôd flicked on. Their shift ended hours ago. They‚Äôd never work this much overtime. His thumb hovered over his phone ‚Äì useless, with his prepaid credit drained ‚Äì until he remembered: Guard profiles get benefits (Lapo said in passing). The login screen taunted him with a spinning cog. Then, Access Granted.

His father‚Äôs line rang into the void. Elia‚Äôs diverted to a robotic ‚Äòsubscriber unavailable‚Äô. Jord‚Äôs pulse thrummed in his ears as he stabbed his mother‚Äôs contact.

One ring. Two ‚Äì

‚ÄòAh. Hello?‚Äô Her voice frayed at the edges, tinny through the speaker.

‚ÄòMum ‚Äì where are you? The house is‚Äì‚Äô

‚Äò‚ÄìJord.‚Äô A pause. Rustling fabric, like she‚Äôd cupped the mouthpiece. ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre‚Ä¶ out. At the clinic. Your father‚Äôs‚Ä¶ his hip again.‚Äô

He froze. Liar. Dad‚Äôs hip hadn‚Äôt troubled him since the surgery. ‚ÄòWhich clinic? I‚Äôll come‚Äì‚Äô

‚ÄòNo!‚Äô The word cracked. A muffled exhale. ‚ÄòThey‚Äôre ‚Äì they‚Äôre discharging him now. We‚Äôll be home by half-ten.‚Äô

‚ÄòMum ‚Äì‚Äô

‚ÄòJord.‚Äô Her tone hardened, the one she‚Äôd used when he‚Äôd tracked mud through the kitchen as a boy. ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt fuss. It‚Äôs sorted.‚Äô

Static hissed between them. Beneath it, a distant clang ‚Äì metal on stone. Not a clinic. A warehouse echo.

‚ÄòPut Dad on,‚Äô he demanded.

‚ÄòHe‚Äôs‚Ä¶ resting. Can‚Äôt talk.‚Äô

‚ÄòThen Elia. Where‚Äôs Elia?‚Äô

A beat. ‚ÄòWith us.‚Äô

Another fact that expanded the discrepancy. Elia hated clinics.

‚ÄòMum. Where are you really?‚Äô

The line died.

Jord‚Äôs chest tightened ‚Äì his pulse spiked, breath quick and shallow. A wave of vertigo washed over him.

He started pacing in circles, forcing himself to slow his breathing, to think. He needed answers. What could have happened?

His mind raced. Is it because of me? The doubt slithered up his body like a viper coiling from his legs to his throat. Velmaran forces? No ‚Äì I'm just a lowly recruit. The system probably hasn‚Äôt even registered me as of yet. So, probably not that.

The Black Hand? No chance ‚Äì he‚Äôd cut ties with them as a teen. Vliklian? Unlikely. The man was a petty bastard, but would he push things this far over a petty squabble that happened so long ago? Doubtful.

His thoughts hit a wall. No clear answer presented itself. Then what the hell happened? She lying and they are all together.

He exhaled slowly, wrestling his thoughts back into order. ‚ÄòI‚Äôm part of the state apparatus, now,‚Äô he reminded himself, the words steadying him like a hand on his shoulder. ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not alone in this.‚Äô

With trembling fingers, he dialled Lapo's number.

‚ÄòYes, Whittaker?‚Äô Lapo's voice carried the weight of authority.

Jord spilled everything ‚Äì the empty house, his mother's strange response, his churning suspicions.

Lapo, ever the professional, wasted no time. He had the department of investigations track the last call made from Jord‚Äôs phone. The location traced back to a warehouse on Industriante Street, number 3. Officially, it belonged to a company known for manufacturing transmissions for heavy machinery.

Lapo assembled a task force and instructed Jord to meet him at a nearby building.

‚ÄòMove fast,‚Äô Lapo warned.

'On my way,' Jord managed. The night air hit his face as he slipped out, each shadow on Thamburg's streets now a potential watcher. He stuck to the smaller roads, avoiding the main thoroughfares.

The building in question turned out to be a small half-abandoned office block, its windows dark except for a single light on the second floor. Lapo was waiting by the service entrance, accompanied by four other figures Jord didn't recognise. Their body armour was matte black, without the usual military insignia that the guard sported.

‚ÄòYour first lesson in the work, Whittaker,‚Äô Lapo said grimly as Jord approached. ‚ÄòSometimes being in the special forces paints a target on your back.‚Äô He gestured towards the warehouse across the street. ‚ÄòThat building‚Äôs been on our radar for months. Officially, it‚Äôs owned by Zoliar Manufacturing. Unofficially‚Ä¶' He let the sentence hang.

The ‚Äúspecial forces‚Äù The fuck he is talking about? Did I sign the wrong papers? Jord mentally freaked out. Then took a moment to drag his senses to the moment.

‚ÄòFascinating, truly,‚Äô Jord hissed, the words fraying at the edges. He stepped closer, the office‚Äôs damp chill seeping through his uniform. ‚ÄòBut why drag my family into this?‚Äô

Lapo‚Äôs face tightened. ‚ÄòYour father had any dealings with Velmar Networks?‚Äô

‚ÄòNo,‚Äô Jord shook his head, confusion creeping into his voice. ‚ÄòHe and my mother works at a textile mill. Pryor and Sons.‚Äô

Lapo frowned, the lines around his eyes deepening. ‚ÄòSeems our intel was lacking, they had another drop spot.' He pulled out his data-pad, thumbing through reports.

‚ÄòWhat?‚Äô Jord's whisper took on an edge. ‚ÄòYou still didn‚Äôt tell my they had to drag them in a warehouse, are they hostages?‚Äô

Lapo glanced at the warehouse, then back at Jord. ‚ÄòWe‚Äôve been tracking a smuggling operation. Goods, military grade, ammunitions that can pierce our grade of plate with easy, hand bombs, and encrypted devices that held intel of our nation‚Äôs critical infrastructure.‚Äô He paused, weighing his next words. ‚ÄòTonight was supposed to be a major operation. But if your father's not with Velmar‚Ä¶ they must have spotted him browsing through something he wasn‚Äôt supposed to.‚Äô

'And so they took my whole family?‚Äô Jord‚Äôs hands clenched into fists.

Lapo rubbed his chin thoughtfully. ‚ÄòYou don't grab an entire family just to send a message. That‚Äôs too messy, draws too much attention. No...‚Äô He glanced at the warehouse. ‚ÄòThey‚Äôre trying to figure out what your family saw exactly, who they might have told. Bribery only works if you know what you‚Äôre buying silence about.‚Äô

‚ÄòAnd Elia?‚Äô Jord pressed.

‚ÄòSmart kid, your brother, isn‚Äôt he?‚Äô Lapo's expression darkened. ‚ÄòMaybe they're worried he saw something. Technical stuff that would‚Äôve gone over your parents‚Äô heads.‚Äô

'Listen, Whittaker,' Lapo leaned closer, voice barely above a breath. ‚ÄòIn this city, people vanish without a trace. One day they‚Äôre here, next day there‚Äôs just whispers. No bodies, no evidence, not even a trail. Just empty houses and neighbours who suddenly can‚Äôt remember a thing.‚Äô

He checked his watch before continuing. ‚ÄòRight now, your family‚Äôs alive because these people need to know what they saw and who they‚Äôve told. Once they have those answers...' He let the implication hang in the air. ‚ÄòThat call from your mother? That wasn't just your mother talking. They were sending you a message, testing the waters. We wait, we risk them deciding your family knows too much or isn‚Äôt worth the trouble any-more.‚Äô

‚ÄòBut surely they wouldn‚Äôt ‚Äì‚ÄôJord started.

‚ÄòThree months ago,‚Äô Lapo cut in, ‚Äòa dock worker and his wife disappeared. Their crime? Spilling over the wrong crate. When contraband rolled out instead of supplies, they got scared and ran straight to their foreman. Thought they were doing the right thing.‚Äô He paused, jaw tightening. ‚ÄòTwo weeks later they vanished, their teenage son too. Some say the family left town for better opportunities. Others say they received an irresistible offer to relocate ‚Äì the kind you can‚Äôt refuse. And when I mean ‚Äúthey‚Äù ‚Äì‚Äô He accentuate the word. ‚ÄòI mean me, I have been collecting piece by piece little remains that bloat from the docks.‚Äô

Jord took a moment to take it all in, but stubborn hope refused to flee. ‚ÄòWe don‚Äôt even know if it is the same group!‚Äô Jord said.

‚ÄòSo you say, but met a crime syndicate you met them all. Do you really base your belief on such shaky foundation to gamble your family lives?‚Äô Lapo said, stripping Jord‚Äôs soul bare for the world to see.

Jord‚Äôs legs trembled as he slumped against the wall, the night‚Äôs revelations pressing down on him, as if he had been thrust ten thousand leagues under the sea, desperate to gasp for air yet unable to draw a single flimsy breath.

‚ÄòSo what‚Äôs the plan, sir?‚Äô The question came out hollow, fatigued, exhausted.

I‚Äôm not sure whether her equipment was faulty or what, but it hurt and those teeth have been sensitive ever since.

If I were ever to consider myself a premium sound quality enthusiast, Sennheiser would hands down be my top choice. I genuinely believe they offer the best sounding headphones in the entire market. BUT ‚Äî there‚Äôs one big downside, which I‚Äôll explain later. So grab your coffee, sit back, and enjoy the ride.

I‚Äôve been familiar with Sennheiser for a long time. I‚Äôve owned the Momentum 3, recently bought the Momentum 4, and they work just fine. I also own the Sony WH-1000XM3, XM4, and XM5, Technics AZ80, and just yesterday picked up the AZ100. I‚Äôve also tried the Denon PerL Pro. And yes, I have the AirPods Max ‚Äî but they‚Äôre trash, so I won‚Äôt even bother acknowledging them.

After many days of detailed comparisons, I came to one solid conclusion: the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4, especially with its lossless mode, offers the best sound I‚Äôve ever heard in any pair of headphones. Period.

So what‚Äôs the problem?

Reliability.

When I first bought the MTW4, I noticed immediate connection issues. They struggled to connect to any of my devices and by the end of the first week, they stopped connecting altogether. I had purchased them brand new on eBay, not knowing that a receipt is required to make a warranty claim. I assumed the ""2-year warranty"" printed on the box would cover me. I contacted Sennheiser support, and to their credit, they kindly offered me a one-time courtesy replacement. They told me the whole process would take 2‚Äì3 weeks.

In the meantime, I decided to purchase another pair ‚Äî this time in white, because they looked fantastic. When I received them, they sounded great at first. But after a few days, I started noticing strange behavior in the right earbud. The sound felt shifted toward the left ‚Äî vocals and instruments were off-center, about 20% leaning left. Very disappointing.

I tested all my other headphones just to be sure it wasn‚Äôt a hearing issue. But as a musician with perfect hearing, I was already confident the issue wasn‚Äôt on my end. And after double checking, it was confirmed: the white pair was unbalanced.

A few days later, I received the replacement unit from Sennheiser on my first pair. I gave those a listen too, just to be absolutely sure this was a real issue and not just tuning. And again ‚Äî confirmed. Unbalanced sound.

I get it. Sometimes you get lucky, sometimes not. But come on ‚Äî just read the reviews on Amazon and Best Buy. There are hundreds of people complaining about the same issues. I never had anything like this happen with the Technics AZ80 or AZ100 ‚Äî even in the short time I‚Äôve had them.

So, I‚Äôm probably going to have to say goodbye to Sennheiser. As much as I love the sound quality, using headphones and constantly worrying that something might go wrong‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just not for me.

Do I still recommend Sennheiser? Yes ‚Äî but only if you‚Äôre willing to take the risk. You might be lucky and never experience these issues. The white pair I bought was actually a brand-new replacement unit from an eBay seller. He had the same issue with the MTW3, and Sennheiser sent him the MTW4s as a replacement. He didn‚Äôt want to risk it again and went with the Technics AZ100 instead ‚Äî and honestly, I don‚Äôt blame him.",25,1742746865.0,sennheiser,14,0.94,False

Whether you choose professional treatments or at-home solutions, the key is consistency, proper dental care, and realistic expectations. Your journey to a brighter, more confident smile starts with understanding the possibilities of whitening teeth before and after transformations. Take the first step towards a radiant smile that reflects your inner confidence and personality.",1,1742746821.0,Teethgumhealth,0,1.0,False

1ji2yeg,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1ji2yeg/struggling/,Struggling.,"I'm hurting. Deeply. I can't seem to get out of bed. I haven't brushed my hair in a week. I tried to go to the store for groceries and bought grapes and asparagus before I couldn't do it anymore. I have lost 8lbs because I can't eat. I want to go to the park for my usual Sunday afternoon but can't get up enough to get ready and make the drive. 

I took a week off work to be depressed. I'm giving myself a deadline on this (hopefully). I don't have my therapy appointment until Tuesday. 

I have shut myself off from the people in my life. I don't answer the phone. I'm returning texts less. I'm simply sitting here and taking in oxygen in silence. I managed to make a cup of coffee this morning but haven't drank it. 

Not having desires or thoughts of harming myself or anything like that, I'm just hurting and I'm doing far worse than people think I am. This freaking sucks. ",1,1742746705.0,GriefSupport,1,1.0,False

I was going to let it sit for a week or so and then reheat to like 190 and pour it through a coffee filter just to make sure there's no big bits I missed.  It seems like I can keep most of the niter in the carboy. Is 190 hot enough to can it and have it seal properly? And is it cold enough to keep niter from reforming? I also have a 4l wood barrel that has burbon in it right now.  I was going to try filling that,  any one have any suggestions or experiences with that?",1,1742746592.0,maplesyrup,2,1.0,False

But it is kind of telling that Suzy can‚Äôt stand being excluded from a space even if she‚Äôs one of the reasons it exists.  She and her cronies have long refused to engage in adult conversations with people who disagreed with them, liberally blocked people from participating in their chat and instead started the whole mean girls vibe. 

Thoroughly silly people. 

That much stupidity should be painful.

Here's what I have so far:

* 12g of ground coffee. Setting at #20 on the Dose grinder
* Extraction takes about 19 seconds for 42 grams of coffee

Taste is really bitter. 

What would you change for the next step? I was thinking about grinding coarser. But #20 is already on the coarse side.   
  
Should I just put less coffee? Lower the extraction time?
