For some reason at the dinner table she turns into a cross between Mrs Bucket and Queen Elizabeth.

I don't enjoy dinner with her and it actually stresses me out so much. It rarely happens tbh only on occasions. My husband and I both cook dinner everyday and we bring dinner over to her (she lives next door). We see each other all the time and get on really well outside of the dinnertable. I just hate actually dining with her and Christmas is around the corner. I'll either be stuck here having dinner with her or at my in-laws who will insist on inviting her. That will be even worse because it will be very noisy there and she'll keep complaining of the noise in front of them and get into a bad mood because it will affect her ears.

Last week, powering down the Karoo (3) it looks to shut down, but then goes into a boot loop.  (Screen goes off, then lights up and shows logo, then 3 or 4 seconds later it goes off, 3 or 4 secs and it lights up with logo. Carry this on indefinitely.

To combat this, I powered back up,  but left the device for 30 minutes and it auto turned off properly.

{Updated last week with the new update}

Yesterday I tried to turn it on by holding the power button, but it went into the boot loop described above.  When the screen went off, I pressed and held for longer (maybe 4 seconds) and it powered up. NBo further issues, even shut down fine.

This morning, it power up fine, but at a second coffee stop the head unit shut down (while recording ride). I powered up and it let me resume the ride, but when I synced to Strava it said it was 31st December 1989.  I was able to edit the gpx and change just the first two dates to today and re-upload and all was fine.

This evening I have factory reset.

Hopefully the reset will fix the issues, but I wondered if anyone else has suffered these issues?",1,1728238071.0,Karoo,0,1.0,False

**Nexus. The Crown Herald Town of Elaseer. Ambassadorial District. The Adventurer‚Äôs Guild Hall‚Ä¶ name pending. Local Time: 0700 Hours.**

**Emma**

It shouldn‚Äôt have surprised me that our first major interaction in town had resulted in a standoff.

Though what *did* pleasantly surprise me was that unlike most of my confrontations up to this point, the point of contention between us didn‚Äôt involve a ticking time bomb nor an existential threat.

It instead involved‚Ä¶ bread. 

*And* pastries too.

Exactly ten trays of it to be precise.

With each tray somehow being comically larger than the next, managing to impress as equally as it did to impede what few pedestrians there were at this hour.

‚ÄúHavenbrockian hospitality, was it, my lord?‚Äù The hooded figure spoke, his tone practically *oozing* a renewed sense of frustration and skepticism, clearly forming as a result of Ilunor‚Äôs premature bread stunt.

‚ÄúIndeed it is.‚Äù Thalmin replied sternly, without once shifting his posture as he stood there with one arm still on the door. ‚ÄúDo you wish to reject the offer?‚Äù He quickly followed up, doubling down on the bread-ultimatum.

A small pause dominated the air after that point as I held my breath, my eyes gazing up to check my rear-view cameras for any potential crowds that had formed following this sudden buildup in bread-related traffic.

Thankfully, none had formed just *yet*.

Which once again showed that waking up *early* really did have its benefits.

‚ÄúNo, my lord. This was just‚Ä¶ *unexpected* is all. Though you must forgive me, as practicality and tradition now stand in the way of the logistics of your kind and generous act of courtesy.‚Äù The man spoke cryptically, though it was clear that Thalmin‚Äôs refusal to back down, was enough to assuage his skepticisms somewhat. ‚ÄúYou may wish to cover your ears for this.‚Äù He warned, turning around for a moment, before letting out an ear-splitting whistle.

No sooner did that whistle end, did a flurry of footsteps emerge from deep within the building, as a veritable platoon‚Äôs worth of haphazardly dressed elves, satyrs, serpent-people, and kobolds all came barreling out the door, standing at attention on the wide steps of the guild hall.

It was this latter group that reacted the most viscerally to our presence, or more particularly, Ilunor‚Äôs.

However, before the Vunerian could respond or acknowledge them in any way, another amongst their group started to take center stage.

One of them, a particularly scrawny-looking elf, took a few tentative steps up in front of the rank and file group; his head dipping mechanically before speaking. ‚ÄúWhat is your command, guild-commander, sir?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou lot finished training yet?‚Äù The hooded figure replied sternly, his tone of voice, and indeed his accent shifting drastically to something resembling a tired and nonplussed drill sergeant; a stark contrast to the more ‚Äòproper‚Äô voice he was using with us before. 

‚ÄúYes sir!‚Äù The elf responded, gesturing to the rest of his group, all of whom were attempting to shuffle around what seemed to pass for uniforms; panting up a storm all the while. ‚ÄúMorning cleanup and maintenance work, along with preliminary training, complete sir!‚Äù 

‚ÄúVery good.‚Äù The guild commander replied with a single nod, before gesturing towards the line of bakers-turned-delivery men. ‚ÄúBring those *gifts* inside, and set them in the Great Hall.‚Äù He commanded.

‚ÄúYes, sir!‚Äù Came the scrawny elf‚Äôs response, as a concerted, albeit somewhat chaotic effort, soon went underway.

Tray after tray were soon handed over to the ragtag group of‚Ä¶ what I was starting to assume were *trainee adventurers*. Though their ages seemed to range wildly, with the oldest vaguely our age, and the youngest of which seemed *way* too young for a life of adventuring.

With his attention finally shifting away from the would-be adventurers, the hooded man turned to address us once more. ‚ÄúIt is forbidden for any outsiders to enter the adventuring guild without permission. Especially those belonging to another guild or establishment within town.‚Äù The man explained.

‚ÄúA good of a time as any to make use of squires and apprentices, then.‚Äù Thalmin surmised with a gravely huff. 

‚ÄúIndeed it is, your highness.‚Äù The man responded with a small dip of his head. ‚ÄúOnce again, you must excuse our lack of formality. We certainly were not expecting a visitor this early, let alone *royalty* and nobility.‚Äù 

‚ÄúFormality is simply another form of discipline, guild-commander.‚Äù Thalmin responded in kind, stepping up to the plate with a demeanor I hadn‚Äôt seen from him before. His presence, his voice, even his gaze, shifted to a more commanding one. ‚ÄúTo be frank, formality ‚Äî especially of the variety you speak of ‚Äî is much less impressive when compared to the discipline of a warrior. The latter of which, you seem to have no shortage of.‚Äù 

*This* seemed to spark some change in the man, as he let out a gruff chuckle, before placing an arm across his chest and bowing deeply in the process. ‚ÄúYou flatter me, Prince Havenbrock.‚Äù He began, but just as quickly gestured to the chaotic movements of the struggling group. ‚ÄúHowever, I truly cannot accept such a compliment, not with any ounce of earnestness at least. Because as you can see with your own two eyes, this lot of would-be apprentices have yet to have proven themselves in any meaningful capacity.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe all must start somewhere, guild-commander. Formality and decorum, swordsmanship and martial skills, all the hallmarks of a warrior or adventurer are *learned* traits. What cannot be learned or imparted however, is a *willing* steely spirit ‚Äî one that seeks discipline and hierarchy. Your lot seems to have *that* going for them, and for me, that‚Äôs enough to warrant *one* round of flattery.‚Äù 

The hooded man could only nod along as Thalmin spoke, but whilst his features were concealed, his body language more or less gave away much of his opinions on this whole back and forth. 

‚ÄúSpoken like a true mercenary prince, your highness.‚Äù He bowed deeper this time around, a sense of genuine appreciation coming through, just in time for the last of the bread trays to enter through the double-doors. With a cock of his head, momentarily halting the conversation to check up on the gaggle of trainees, he quickly turned to grab his side of the door, preparing to fully open it. ‚ÄúYou, and your compatriots, are all welcome here.‚Äù The man extended his arm as far as it could go, pushing the door wide open in the process, and granting us a full view of the world within. ‚ÄúWelcome to the Adventurer‚Äôs Guild Hall of Elaseer.‚Äù 

Thalmin wasted no time in entering, prompting the rest of us to follow closely in tow into a space that was as grand as it was on the inside, as the outside had led me to believe. 

Grand pillars of geometrically shaped and carved oak dominated much of what looked to be an open-plan floor space, going up as high as to a second and third floor, both of which seemed to ‚Äòwrap‚Äô around the perimeter of the interior. This heavy usage of wood continued through to the simple wood-paneled walls, and was arguably put to exceptionally tasteful use on the floors. As all manner of hardwood planks ranging from pine to oak, to acacia and birch, covered the floor in a myriad of parquet patterns.

Immediately in front of us was a reception area, complete with sofas, lounge chairs, coffee tables, and all manner of tastefully placed decorations. All of which were more in line with a contemporary brand of posh aesthetics; *not* the overindulgent gaudy baroque aesthetics of the Academy or even the Versailles-themed bakery. 

Immediately behind this reception lounge, was the actual reception desk, similar to what you‚Äôd expect to find in hotels and inns, wrapping around a large central pillar. Whilst unstaffed and seemingly empty like most of the room right now, there was no shortage of hints at just how busy this place got at its peak. With inkwells and quills, parchments and documents, all visibly present just behind the counter ‚Äî as if placed there in anticipation of yet another busy day. 

Flanking the reception counter at the entrance to the east and west ‚Äòwings‚Äô of the first floor were several large notice boards, some attached directly to the large support pillars, whilst others remained freestanding, set atop of easels and poster-stands. 

The EVI quickly made short work of the more official looking notices, revealing that most were lists of active adventuring parties, timetables denoting shift rotation and questing availability, as well as public notices for either vacancies, advertisements of hire, and most interestingly of all ‚Äî a call for intermediately-ranked adventuring parties to take on one of the ‚Äòprospective apprentices‚Äô for ‚Äòfield experience‚Äô. 

However, the EVI‚Äôs technical hiccups soon reared its ugly head back around upon setting its sights on the less-than-official notices on the various adjacent noticeboards. A quick analysis revealed that these hiccups could simply be attributed to the occasional misspelling, the use of unconventional abbreviations, or even the excessive presence of technical jargon perhaps belonging to the niche field of adventuring. 

Whatever the case was, my attention was quickly overtaken by the trail of trainees rapidly organizing the spoils of Ilunor‚Äôs spending spree in the west wing, as the doors to the massive hall remained wide open ‚Äî revealing a room packed to the brim with long bench-style dining tables that stretched from wall to wall. 

All manner of linen-lined baskets were set out throughout the tables, the trays of bread emptied into them at an exceptional rate. 

Judging by the what was visible through the large shield-styled door, the west wing was dominated mostly by a communal dining area, complete with tapestries depicting grand battles lining every available wall, and suits of armor along with stereotypically shiny weapons hanging behind glass cases in between whatever spaces remained between the tapestries. 

This room lacked the same warmth and luxury exuded by the reception area, as wood seemed to be used sparingly here, instead replaced by bog-standard cobblestone, brick, mortar, and *harsher* materials. Though, to their credit, most of the less tasteful construction was hidden quite effectively, giving off less of a medieval-utilitarian aesthetic, and more the vibe of a medieval monarch‚Äôs dining hall. 

‚ÄúI will be back shortly, my lords and ladies.‚Äù The hooded man announced, snapping me right out of my reverie. ‚ÄúI must inform the guild master of your arrival, and prepare them for your conference.‚Äù

‚ÄúI hope this doesn‚Äôt take too long, guild-commander.‚Äù Thalmin responded calmly. 

‚ÄúI can assure that this will take no longer than a foam‚Äôs collapse, your highness.‚Äù The man bowed deeply, garnering a nod from Thalmin, before he promptly ran off up the stairs. 

It was then that I started to notice something *off* about his legs, as a flicker of mana radiation coincided with a sudden, but recorded, instance of some disguise magic at play. 

His legs were decidedly *digitigrade*, but then again, I wasn‚Äôt yet ready to openly question it.

What I would question, however, was that indecipherable idiom being used. ‚ÄúThalmin, what exactly is a *foam‚Äôs collapse*?‚Äù I asked bluntly.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a *commoner‚Äôs saying*. The man‚Äôs *clearly* a lowborn.‚Äù Ilunor responded haughtily, lazing against the couch with an increasing display of gross superiority. 

Thalmin, predictably, growled at this, before turning to me. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a saying amongst warriors, Emma. It refers to the time it takes for a frothy mug of ale to go flat, or more specifically, the time it takes for a beer head to dissipate after standing for too long on the counter.‚Äù 

‚ÄúHuh.‚Äù I nodded once, as I quickly turned to the EVI. ‚ÄúAre you logging this, EVI?‚Äù

**‚ÄúAffirmative. New esoteric colloquialism added to the \[Working Language Database\].‚Äù**

‚ÄúWhich I guess implies he won‚Äôt take long?‚Äù I clarified.

‚ÄúPrecisely, Emma.‚Äù Thalmin nodded.

Idle conversation quickly descended among the rest of the gang as I simply took in the sights and sounds, my eyes transfixed on the diligent and well-oiled machine of the trainees. 

I was so enthralled by the *atmosphere* of this place, that I almost didn‚Äôt notice one of the trainees setting up a small tea set in front of us, as a five-tier tray was quickly set up, half of which were filled by the same pastries we brought in. 

‚ÄúUgh.‚Äù Ilunor announced, garnering a quick snap of the trainee‚Äôs head, if only for the satyr to yelp meekly upon temporarily locking eyes with the Vunerian. ‚Äú*Regifting a gift is already an act of poor taste.* To actually serve your guests their own gifts‚Ä¶ is another thing entirely.‚Äù The blue thing spoke to no one in particular. 

Though that little tirade was promptly interrupted by a sharp gurgling sound. 

One that unmistakably came from someone‚Äôs stomach.

And given that none of us were hungry, the culprit of this was obvious enough, as I turned to face the trainee ‚Äî a satyr that looked just about our age. The man was dressed in a simple set of clothes, consisting of a matching brown tunic and pants, which I assume was his PT uniform. Though not disheveled by any means, and clearly not *starving*, I couldn‚Äôt help but to sympathize with him. 

So just as he‚Äôd finished setting up, I quickly called out for him. ‚ÄúHey.‚Äù I began, reaching for one of the plates in the process. ‚ÄúYou hungry?‚Äù 

The trainee‚Äôs reaction‚Ä¶ was something that I should‚Äôve anticipated. As he turned to face me with a look of disbelief, before evolving into one of worry, as if expecting some sort of a reprimand. 

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶  I‚Äôm sorry, my lady?‚Äù He stuttered out, nervousness seeping through each and every syllable.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a simple question, are you hungry or not? You just got out of morning exercises, right? I don‚Äôt imagine you‚Äôve had time to eat.‚Äù 

‚ÄúY-yes, my lady. Y-you‚Äôre correct.‚Äù He responded simply, bowing deeply between those two simple sentences.

‚ÄúThen here.‚Äù I offered, extending the plate full of baked goods towards him. ‚ÄúGo for it.‚Äù I managed out with a smile, or at least, with an intonation that I hoped alluded to the smile beneath my helmet.

It was clear that this action garnered the attention of not only the rest of the gang, but also the other trainees who were watching this scene unfold.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I cannot fathom taking‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúTaking from guests? Well, just look at it this way. I‚Äôm not hungry anyways, so why let good food go to waste?‚Äù I countered, standing up, and more or less shoving the plate into the satyr‚Äôs hands. 

A few moments of quiet contemplation followed as I could just about see the loading screen beach ball of death spinning within his dilated pupils. 

With a gasp, and a deep bow, he relented. ‚ÄúT-thank you, my lady!‚Äù He stuttered out, as he made his way out of the reception area and back into the dining hall.

Chatter quickly erupted amongst the trainees, but before anything could be discerned, the hooded guild-commander quickly arrived back on scene.

‚ÄúMy sincerest apologies for having kept you waiting my lords and ladies.‚Äù He bowed deeply. ‚ÄúPlease, the guild master is ready to receive you.‚Äù

With a wordless nod from Thalmin, and nary an acknowledgement from either Thacea or Ilunor, we left the reception, ascending the grand staircases, until we reached what was undeniably an elevator.

This was life-saving for Ilunor, who had *already* begun to show signs of strain as we‚Äôd ascended that first floor. 

The rest of the trip was made in silence, as after navigating wood-paneled after wood-paneled corridor, passing by even more tapestries and artifacts encased in glass, we‚Äôd finally reached a hallway leading to a single door.

It was there that the guild commander simply stood back, allowing us to enter at our own pace.

Thalmin once more took the lead, knocking *hard* on the door, and prompting whoever was inside to respond muffledly. ‚ÄúEnter!‚Äù

With a single crank of the door handle, we arrived into an office that for once *didn‚Äôt* warp the fabric of space itself. 

Indeed, the office‚Äôs design philosophy seemed to clash *harshly* with that of other Nexian seats of authority I‚Äôd seen thus far. Because as opposed to Mal‚Äôtory and the Dean‚Äôs obsession on monumentality and grandeur, this office seemed to embrace the same sort of subdued luxury as seen below in the reception area. As the warmth of the wood, and the lived-in feel of personal clutter ironically made this space feel more inherently magical than the cold authority of both of the former‚Äôs offices.

Though to be fair, that was probably what they were going for.

Aesthetics aside, it was clear that the ceilings in this space were heightened not merely for the aura of grandeur, but for utility‚Äôs purposes too.

This was because the being that stood before us, clad in plate armor sans their helmet, took up about a good twelve feet worth of height.

However, this would only be the beginning of the‚Ä¶ *peculiarities* of the guild master.

‚ÄúAh! My fellows, please, allow me to make myself more presentable.‚Äù The being spoke with an almost otherworldly voice, something that felt artificial, strained, and *forced*. 

However, instead of putting on his helmet as I‚Äôd expected him to, he began doing the complete opposite.

*CLICK*!

As he unlatched the straps of his chestplate‚Äî

***THUNK*****!**

‚Äîand allowed it to fall to the ground without a care in the world.

‚ÄúErm, we can return in a few moments if you‚Äôd like some time to‚Äî‚Äù

*CLICK!*

The porcelain-skinned humanoid continued unabated, his mechanically-jointed hands now reaching for his armored pants as they too‚Äî

***THUNK*****!**

‚Äîwere removed in a single swift motion.

‚ÄúAGHHHH!‚Äù Ilunor yelped out, shielding his eyes first.

So rapid-paced were the developments that even Thacea was left stunned, and Thalmin was left speechless.

This inexplicable turn of events eventually reached the height of its bizarreness the moment the guild master abruptly turned to face us however, as all of us rapidly went to shield our eyes‚Ä¶ only to be met with what seemed to be a literal mannequin.

An oversized mannequin to be precise, complete with ball and socket joints, where traditional joints should have been; along with a painted-on face that felt more creepy than it did realistic.

‚ÄúWhilst not required by law, I do wish to make it clear who you are speaking to.‚Äù The being continued, their ‚Äòfeatures‚Äô completely motionless, as both of their hands reached up to their head‚Ä¶

***POP!***

‚Ä¶ removing it entirely. 

‚ÄúI am Piamon the Dragon-slayer. Or, if you would prefer a more *noble* title, I am Third-Holder Piamon Pichun of the Pichun family, tenth of my name, and thirtieth in line for the Midland County of Lorlei. Current guild master of the Elaseer Adventuring Guild.‚Äù The‚Ä¶ being‚Ä¶ spoke in rapid succession, bowing deeply in the process, using their ‚Äòhead‚Äô in the same way someone removing their hat would in an official greeting. 

However, no sooner than my confusions had reached their precipice did they clear up, as a stream of iridescent light blue goop started to emerge from the mannequin‚Äôs neck-hole, forming into a ball, before dropping down with a solid *plop* on the desk in front of us.

‚ÄúHow may I be of service?‚Äù The‚Ä¶ slime concluded.

That latent reflexive part of me flinched *hard*, as it took me a great deal of self control to *not* think of it as‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ another similarly slimy and gelatinous creature.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre‚Ä¶ a slime?‚Äù I managed out, attempting to assuage my anxieties, as well as to address my burning curiosities.

‚ÄúA *greater* slime, yes.‚Äù The slime ‚Äònodded‚Äô ‚Äî an act that amounted to its ‚Äòface‚Äô dipping slightly ‚Äòforwards‚Äô. A face that consisted of two thin gray lines for eyes, perpetually locked in an expressionless neutrality. ‚ÄúI assume *you‚Äôre* the newrealmer of the hour?‚Äù 

‚ÄúIndeed I am.‚Äù I replied with a nod of my own. ‚ÄúAs such, I do apologize if that question was somewhat too blunt, or was in any way presumptuous.‚Äù I offered politely.

‚ÄúNo offense was taken, newrealmer. Ignorance is nothing to be sorry for.‚Äù The slime offered tactfully. ‚ÄúIf anything, I would prefer that you ask any and all questions pertaining to my kind  and my culture here, rather than receiving *filtered* and undoubtedly *biased* commentary from others.‚Äù 

‚ÄúRight.‚Äù I nodded, before turning to Thalmin who was clearly waiting for this back and forth to be over with. 

However, once the shock of our introduction, and the relief from having the *null question* had passed, a new feeling quickly came to take its place.

One which was born out of the slime‚Äôs own self-admitted desire to set the record straight.

This was now a chance to interact with a *truly alien being* outside of the Academy‚Äôs walls; first contact without the overbearing flavor of the Academy‚Äôs meddling.

Questions began to flood my brain, as I could feel the second-hand excitement of the entirety of the sociology department‚Äôs staff flowing through my veins.

But while I had an infinite number of questions to ask, I still had a finite amount of time to work with.

And so, I had to choose my questions carefully.

*Addressing the immediate circumstances was always a foolproof start to these sorts of things*. I thought to myself. 

Though questions like ‚Äòwhat‚Äôs the difference between a greater and lesser slime‚Äô, whilst compelling, were probably best left for a trip to an encyclopedia.

Primary evidence was best collected on topics of first-hand accounts on culture after all.

Of which I had the perfect question for.

‚ÄúYou mentioned that revealing yourself is not required by law.‚Äù I began, much to Ilunor‚Äôs annoyance. ‚ÄúAnd you seem to have a very, *very* well crafted mannequin form at your disposal. I‚Äôm assuming that your *primary* slime form is something that isn‚Äôt very well received by socio-cultural norms? Or is your appearance somehow regulated by Nexian law?‚Äù

These questions seemed to elicit some form of a reaction from the slime, as its ‚Äòskin‚Äô jiggled with a level of what I assumed was intrigue.

‚ÄúA *perceptive* newrealmer, I see.‚Äù The guildmaster spoke, before letting out a slight chuckle. ‚ÄúIndeed, I was referencing a few more well known *limitations* placed upon my kind by the likes of Nexian legal conventions.‚Äù They began, before moving off of the table, and ‚Äògrowing‚Äô to meet my height. It took a solid half a minute, but standing before me, was a surprisingly realistic replica of my armor.

This‚Ä¶ *definitely* started throwing me off, alarm bells practically *blaring* now, as the limits of my self-control were once more put to the test.

‚ÄúThe divulgence of my species, and indeed, the declaration of myself as a greater slime is only necessary if I were to publicly use my natural shapeshifting abilities.‚Äù They reasoned, even going so far as to mimic my voice, although they did so very poorly. Indeed, the more I looked, the more certain details of its mimicry were clearly flawed. From the off-blue color of the armor, to the mess of the UN emblem on the chestplate, everything just looked *off* after a few good hard seconds of scrutiny. ‚ÄúThis is understandable, of course. As no one wishes to have their identity stolen. The result of this is the registration act, a means of registering known and unique forms into the crown registry, tying it to a greater slime‚Äôs identity, before making such a thing known to wherever a greater slime may reside. However, my kind have since eschewed frivolous and wanton shapeshifting, instead opting for the creation of *static-forms*, or *mannequins* as most elves call them.‚Äù The slime continued, quickly ‚Äòmelting‚Äô away, before jumping next to the fallen mannequin heap, pointing at it for added effect. 

‚ÄúGreater slimes are in fact quite well known and well-regarded for this particular artform, Emma.‚Äù Thacea quickly added. ‚ÄúIndeed, you will find no other culture so well versed in the art of cosmetics; particularly in the crafting of mannequins.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou flatter us, my lady.‚Äù The slime offered with a deep nod. ‚ÄúMoreover, these mannequins are indeed quite useful for those among my kind that lack magical acumen, for they provide a *static* form that would otherwise be impossible to acquire without the natural gifts of magic.‚Äù 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs your highness, guildmaster.‚Äù Thalmin corrected. ‚ÄúThis is *Princess*, Dilani.‚Äù He quickly added, before turning to the rest of us. ‚ÄúAnd this is Cadet Emma Booker of Earthrealm, along with Lord Ilunor Rularia.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAh, an HRH. Duly noted, mercenary prince.‚Äù The slime noted, taking a deep bow towards Thacea and Ilunor, before turning back towards me. ‚ÄúAre there any further inquiries as to my kind, newrealmer?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ think I might save that for another time then, probably *after* we conclude our business.‚Äù I conceded, moreso to Thalmin than the slime. 

‚ÄúAlways a pleasure to discuss the *truth* of my kind. Though I do hope that my personality has not become as stilted as my porcelain exterior might otherwise lead you to think.‚Äù 

‚ÄúNot at all, Guildmaster Piamon Pichun. I appreciate your candor.‚Äù I dipped my head in acknowledgement.

‚ÄúNow with all that being said‚Äî‚Äù Thalmin quickly chimed in. ‚Äú‚ÄîI would like to discuss our rather‚Ä¶ *atypical* request.‚Äù 

The guildmaster quickly returned to his former posture, ‚Äòhopping‚Äô back onto the table, and leaning forwards towards the lupinor. ‚ÄúYes, mercenary prince?‚Äù

‚ÄúI will be forthright in my request. I wish to issue a closed quest, to Wyvern-class adventurers and above, for the scouting, tracking, and reporting of the whereabouts of the Amethyst dragon.‚Äù 

The guildmaster‚Äôs form jiggled once again in response to that. 

‚ÄúAnd would that be the very same Amethyst dragon that‚Äôs become the talk of the town as of late?‚Äù They inquired back.

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Thalmin nodded. ‚ÄúThough I do stress, this is purely a scouting and reconnaissance mission, with all hazard pay included, along with a bonus for the quick and prompt delivery of said information.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAnd how *much* are you offering for this‚Ä¶ *atypical* quest, mercenary prince?‚Äù 

‚ÄúFive thousand gold.‚Äù Thalmin stated plainly. 

Though at this point, it was difficult to really discern a reaction from the slime given their lack of a face.

‚ÄúWell thank goodness you specified this was merely a *scouting* mission, otherwise I would‚Äôve denied such a request at such a measly price.‚Äù The slime responded, before reaching out a single ‚Äòarm‚Äô to rest its nonexistent ‚Äòchin‚Äô upon. ‚ÄúMay I ask *why* you wish for such a quest?‚Äù

‚ÄúA personal academic matter, guild master.‚Äù Thalmin responded bluntly.

‚ÄúAlright then, shall I send someone to the Academy to verify these claims?‚Äù The slime rebutted.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid this form of academics is under a *different* authority.‚Äù I chimed in, pulling out a familiar card that *immediately* caught the attention of the slime; his whole body jostling uncontrollably in the process. 

‚ÄúAh. I see.‚Äù The slime responded with a sly chuckle. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a long, *long* time since I‚Äôve seen one of those.‚Äù They managed out through an excited breath. ‚ÄúAlright then‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs discuss the terms.‚Äù

(Author‚Äôs Note: We head deep into the guild hall in this one, as Thalmin finally gets to flex his muscles in his element, and demonstrates just how far the prestige, or notoriety, of the current ruling family of Havenbrockrealm truly goes! Meanwhile, Emma offers some form of respite to the hard working adventuring trainees, through some good old fashioned human compassion for compassion's sakes! Finally, we get to finally explore some other species within the Nexus, through both a few of the trainees and most notable of all, the guild master! I've had the worldbuilding for the greater slimes in my docs since I first worldbuilt the Nexus and I'm so excited to be finally sharing some of that to you guys now in this chapter!

They are all F but around my age 26F, 25F, 22F","Hi everyone! 22yrF here and this past week has really made me feel down about friendships. Early this week I had plans with a friend to get dinner at 6pm at a restaurant. We had made this plans a week prior. About an hour before texted them to confirm we were still on. I didn't from them until around 6:30 pm. Past the time we were supposed to meet. They said they were having car trouble this morning and had no way to get there. I feel bad that they are having car trouble but at the same time I was confused why they had not texted me that morning when they knew or just texted me when we were supposed to meet to cancel. The next friend I was supposed to meet several days later in the morning for coffee. We had already made this plan several days prior as well. We chose a coffee shop that was right next to my work as I was getting off night shift. So the day rolls around and I'm at the coffee shop at the time we were supposed to meet. I ordered my drink and food and chose a table and waited. We were supposed to meet at 8:30am. It was now almost 9. I'm super tired and so I just decided to leave as this person has been flakey before. I get a text from them on my drive home and they said something like ""sorry I didn't realize it was friday. This week caught up to me so fast."" And I can understand that but again them texting me after the time I just felt it was slightly inconsiderate. Last friend. We made plans to meet on the weekend in the morning to go to a coffee shop. I'm always the one that has to text this friend to hang out and make the plans so this time I asked them if there was any coffee shop they wanted to try after we had already agreed to get coffee. I got a text from them late the night before we were supposed to meet saying ""I don't care. You pick! And what time?"" I waited until the morning to text but I texted at 7am a coffee shop and suggested we meet at 10 or 10:30. I never heard back from them. I don't know if I'm overeacting but this week has been really disappointing. I'm alreafy the person who always has to reach out to these friends and make the plans but this time none of them showed up even. I'm just tired. I want to find friends that want to make plans to hang out with me. I'm always used to being this person and I've always excused their behavior because I know they're busy. But I'm busy too and I've just been feeling like my friends don't respect me. Am I being too dramatic and what's your advice to my situation?

Despite him not being my boyfriend,"I (26F) met this guy (26M) in July during a quick 30-minute coffee date when he was visiting my city, and we‚Äôve been talking every day since, even though he‚Äôs busy with med school. We discussed him coming back to visit me and his cousin, who lives 10 minutes away. This past weekend, he took Friday off and stayed with me Thursday night. We had a nice time, grabbed pizza, and had an intimate night, but no sex. He left Friday to stay with his cousin and said he'd let me know the weekend plans.

He spent all day Friday with his cousin and texted me at 10 p.m., asking if I wanted to join them at the bars, but I was too tired. On Saturday, I expected to spend time with him based on our previous conversations, so I texted him in the morning, but he said he might do something casual and include his cousin. By the afternoon, I made other plans since I hadn‚Äôt heard back. He texted me last minute, asking if I wanted dinner with his cousin, but I declined because I was with a friend. When I said I was hoping for some one-on-one time, he joked that he thought I was sick of him, which annoyed me. Later, he asked if we could go out just the two of us, but when I agreed, he never followed up and went silent.

I‚Äôm frustrated because he spent two full days with his cousin, who lives close by, and didn‚Äôt make proper plans with me, despite traveling to see me. I feel like I was strung along all weekend, constantly asking about plans, and I‚Äôm unsure if I‚Äôm overreacting since he‚Äôs not my boyfriend. Still, I really like him and feel upset about how he acted. He texted Sunday morning saying he felt unwell and missed his train, leaving me questioning if he visited me or just his cousin. He could‚Äôve easily made time for me but didn‚Äôt, and now I‚Äôm unsure how to handle it.

TL;DR: We‚Äôve been talking daily since our July coffee date, and he recently visited me and his cousin. After staying with me Thursday night, he spent the rest of the weekend with his cousin, making only last-minute plans with me. I feel strung along and upset that he didn‚Äôt prioritize spending time with me. Now I‚Äôm unsure if I‚Äôm overreacting or if I should address how I feel.",1,1728237740.0,AmItheAsshole,6,1.0,False

1fxmk8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1fxmk8p/should_i_have_used_the_word_date/,"Should i have used the word ""date"" ? ","Hey there!

It's been a few months i've been having kind of a crush on a barista at my local cafe. I see her at her work (she's a specialty barista and I'm a hobbyist, we exchange a lot about that which also leads to other conversations where we got to talk about ourselves) and we randomly text once in a while.

She recently went on sick leave for an injury and i stopped seeing her, so i reached out to ask if she was okay. She let me know she was out of town recovering at her moms' place gave me a couple of indications (that i took as hints) she'll have more free time as she'll be back working on a part time schedule and will stop working on week-ends and followed back up on a couple of things we mentioned in the past which is me introducing her to bouldering and going try other specialty coffees in town.

I honestly wasn't sure those were what people call ""hints"". I'm a slow guy when it comes to seduction in general. But decided to propose her a time and place to meet outside for the first time.

Thing is, i haven't been explicit in anyway, and the word ""date"" wasn't used.

We met, it was great, had good fun, deep dived on a lot of topics we never had to the time to elaborate on as our encounters are brief and we're not much of social media persons. I can safely say it was pretty pleasant for both. But I didn't any close-to-potentially-romantic vibe from the encounter, and i think that might be a me-problem, not making my interest or intentions clear enough. And i think i was slightly too confident it was clear because of my friends thinking that there was no way in hell a straight girl would agree to a 1:1 meeting with a straight guy she barely knew unless she was interested

We agreed to meet again soon enthusiastically and both had a lot of suggestions for a next encounter, but didn't mention a time yet

Ultimately, i would get over if it's not reciprocal, i'm unsure how to make it clear to new acquaintances or strangers what my intentions are in a respectful, non-awkward way. I've also thought about what would i do if she wasn't into me and quite frankly we get along well enough, and I'm not that attached for it to be a problem, so i know we'd be good pals otherwise ",1,1728237599.0,dating,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôm new to Reddit so not sure how to use this.

I f18 and m23 have been married for just over 4 months. We have always known each other through the neighbourhood but I never interacted with him much. We moved in straight away, both still studying. I finished my first year of college and he was still doing a placement year. The start of the marriage was amazing. He was very caring and would always surprise me with things. Alhamdulillah I couldn‚Äôt have been happier. He would do his rounds at the wards, either day shifts or night shifts. This is where everything went wrong.

I only went into college 3 days a week and had the rest of the days off for personal studying. I always woke up when he was leaving at 5am to make his breakfast and lunch for work. I happily did it cause he was my husband and I wanted to make him happy. This was at my own detriment. I would start class at 9 and finish 6pm. He would get in earlier than me, but would sleep up until I came back. I don‚Äôt drive and have to commute hours to get home. I would be so exhausted. And the thought of cooking still waiting for me, made me want to off myself honestly. I did this for most days. However recently it got bad. I just had enough. I fell like a maid, chef and a s*x doll . I apologise for the term I had to use. But I just did not expect marriage to be like this at all. Especially for the fact we‚Äôre still young. I expected some form of an emotional connection. Like he never says anything nice or compliments me. Only very degrading comments during intimacy as if I‚Äôm so sort of prostitute. 

I have tired to make sure his days aren‚Äôt stressful, as he works in a busy environment. I even started going back home to see family less cause he acts like I‚Äôm off partying or something. I feel so stupid, maybe this is just what marriage is about. We never go on dates cause on his days off, he wants to spend the entire day with his boys at the gym or playing football. I can‚Äôt get him to even come grocery shopping with me, cause I don‚Äôt wanna go alone . I‚Äôve spoken to my friends, and they say that I should just leave him. And that I‚Äôm overworked and benefiting nothing from this relationship. I try so hard to make breakfast most days, some days I admit I just make a coffee, and that‚Äôs because I feel like I spend my life in that kitchen. He goes off on how I‚Äôm not a good wife. He even goes on to say that so many girls wanted him and he chose me. To which I get upset and say, that no girl will tolerate what I tolerate with him. I tired to make him understand , he couldn‚Äôt. So i just stopped being intimate with him. To the point i have to lie and say it‚Äôs that time of the month so he can just get away from me. That hasn‚Äôt worked cause now he‚Äôs added himself on my app tracker.


I just feel like this marriage isn‚Äôt worth saving. I‚Äôm way more empty and depressed than when I was in my family home. I lost 20 kg in the space of those 4 months. He‚Äôs religiosity was the main reason why I married him. Alhamdulillah he prays, guards his tongue and lowers his gaze. It‚Äôs as if everything is perfect about him but his character. He doesn‚Äôt swear or shout or anything. But I‚Äôm starting to think he has a warped perception of what a marriage is. He thinks the women should just cook, clean, be intimate whenever he asks, and that‚Äôs it. He seems to just go work, gym chill with friends and repeat . This isnt normal at all . Please if there‚Äôs any sister in here around my age. Please be wary someone could be amazing on paper, but in reality, not. I don‚Äôt want to divorce him cause how would I even explain, that he isn‚Äôt oppressing me or mistreating me, but something is off. My parents will think I‚Äôm the problem . Cause  just can‚Äôt word what the issue is. 
He doesn‚Äôt have any sisters, and I think this is the issue. He‚Äôs really detached from women and understanding them generally. He wasn‚Äôt in any previous rships or anything haram. It‚Äôs just I feel like he behaves like a fob when he‚Äôs been raised here years . I‚Äôm not sure if he‚Äôs trying to emulate the marriage his parents have.

1fxmhc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1fxmhc2/balance_of_responsibility/,Balance of Responsibility,"Longtime lurker/reader; first time poster.

I have read countless posts where breadwinners complain about their stay-at-home-partners conplaining about them doing nothing. I have read other posts where people complain that partners complains about them starting things and not finishing them. My stay-at-home spouse complains about both, so I suppose I am here like many before me to complain about complaining.

In reading other posts, I understand that the mental accounting of staying-at-home-and-caring-for-kids is exhausting, especially if done alone. I recognize I was not giving my partner as much credit as is due there.

However, I take kids to school every day, pick up 2-3 days a week. Take to soccer practices 2 of 3 night practices of the week. Other nights I work. I do at least 50% of kid's doctor's appointments. I manage all finances, do over half of the yard work/house maintenance. I clean a couple of bathrooms every week and kitchen once a month.  

With a 50-hour-per-week job, I spend almost all time not working helping with kids and house.

My SAH partner got in the habit of exercising from midnight-2:30AM when they stayed up with our last kid when she was an infant. 5 years later, she still wakes up at midnight, brews coffee, exercises, and deals with wake ups (if any; rarely are these days).

Understandably, some time out of their day is spent napping; on weekends, I watch our kids to facilitate (enable?) this mid-day nap. 

I start yard projects on weekend mornings, have to stop them to watch kids for their nap, don't get back to them in the mid-afternoon (see next paragraph), and I get the ""you never finish anything"" bit later in the day. 

I feel like they deliberately clean the house on weekends when kids are home so that they have free time during weekdays when kids are at school. I get wanting to have and deserving free time, except it feels like it comes at the expense of me accomplishing anything or having any of my own free time.

I understand that I'm not working 100% of the time when I'm at work, but 30 minutes between classes isn't really ""free time.""

When I try to bring up these issues, my partner responds defensively and/or throws out erratic suggestions along the lines of ""I guess I'll just do everything with the yard, so you'll need to take over grocery shopping and devise a system for keeping track of everything in the pantry and fridge and keep track of what days the kids want lunch from home...""

I'm unsure what exactly I'm asking for here. More than anything, I suppose I just wanted a place to vent. 

We are not in couples therapy; previous negative experiences with individual counseling have them resistant to going. I recognize couples therapy is probably a better place to air these grievances.",1,1728237391.0,Marriage,1,1.0,False

Since then, we‚Äôve been talking every day, even though he‚Äôs in med school and super busy, which I really appreciate. We talked about him coming back to visit, and he has a cousin who lives just 10 minutes from me, so it made sense for him to visit both of us.

Fast forward, he came this weekend back to the city to visit me and his cousin. He took Friday off from his hospital work and asked if he could stay with me Thursday night, which I didn‚Äôt think was an issue. So he came Thursday night, the ticket cost him $120 and it was a 3 hour train ride, we grabbed pizza really quick and came back to my apartment and ate here. I genuinely do like him because he‚Äôs sweet, funny, and matches my energy every time. I had work the next day so we got into bed around 11:30 and made out for a bit, did a few other things, but didn‚Äôt have sex and then he left around lunch time Friday because he was going to go stay with his cousin and spend some time with him and I asked him again to let me know what the plans were for the rest of the weekend and he said he‚Äôd let me know. 

He ended up spending all day with his cousin Friday, texted me at 10pm if I wanted to go out to the bars with him and his cousin, which I declined because I was out with a friend and too tired to join. Saturday, I was expecting to spend the day with him based on our previous conversations, so I texted in the morning asking about plans, he said ‚Äúif I wanted to do something in the day it‚Äôd have to be something casual like drinks or food but his cousin might tag along but he‚Äôll ask his cousin when he wakes up‚Äù, so I said to just lmk. It ends up being 3:30pm and I end up going out for coffee with a friend because I didn‚Äôt want to be waiting all day waiting to hear on plans from that guy. He then texts me asking if I want to get dinner with his cousin at 4:15, keep in mind I literally just met up with my friend and we just got coffee, so I wasn‚Äôt going to bail on her because he decided to text me so last minute. I passed the offer up and said ‚ÄúI was hoping to have some 1x1 time w you before you left but if you‚Äôre busy it‚Äôs fine‚Äù and he replied with ‚ÄúHaha aw really? Here I thought u were sick of me‚Äù so I just ended up ignoring him because I was getting slightly angry. 

he texts me around 6pm saying ‚ÄúDo youuu wanna just go out later me and u? maybe we can do that?‚Äù since the original night plans were to go out with his cousin and him and my friend, so I replied back at 6:30pm saying ‚ÄúYes but you pick the time and place for wine & dessert‚Äù and then it was complete radio silence the rest of the night and he never let me know. I think I‚Äôm just really mad that he spent two full days with his cousin who lives 10 mins away from me when he could have spared an hour of the day to take me out on a proper date or anything and then I also felt like I was being strung along the entire weekend because he didn‚Äôt have solid plans on anything and I was constantly asking what the plans were. 

I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm overreacting because this guy is not my boyfriend, but I do really like him so I‚Äôm not sure if I should tell him I‚Äôm upset with the way he acted. He texted me sunday morning (today) saying he felt unwell and he missed his train. Like I can‚Äôt tell if he came here to visit me or his cousin? If he genuinely wanted to see me, he could‚Äôve spared an hour on Saturday or Friday to grab dinner with me or go for a quick walk, but he didn‚Äôt even ask to see me after he left Friday morning because asking if I wanted to go out at 10pm. 

TL;DR: I‚Äôve been talking to this guy every day since our coffee date in July, and he recently came to visit me and his cousin, who lives nearby. He stayed with me Thursday night, and we had a nice time, but after that, he spent most of Friday and Saturday with his cousin. He only texted me last-minute to make plans, and when I asked for some one-on-one time, he either included his cousin or didn‚Äôt follow through. By Saturday night, he completely stopped responding after I agreed to meet up. I‚Äôm frustrated because I feel like I was strung along all weekend, and he didn‚Äôt prioritize spending time with me, even though he traveled to see me. Now I‚Äôm unsure if I‚Äôm overreacting, but I‚Äôm really upset with how things played out.",1,1728237257.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

But, plans change, life happens and things fall through. 

My boss is a man named Charles ‚Äò Chuck‚Äô Rogers. The name fits the man, he‚Äôs never told me his exact age but he‚Äôs well past sixty. 

He stands six foot three, and old man or not, he‚Äôs built like a boxer. 

Me, I‚Äôm half his age, half his size, and rocking a decent amount of body art that can‚Äôt really be hidden by  the red plaid shirt that serves as an informal uniform. 

We share sweet fuck-all in common, but for the past decade or so, he‚Äôs been the best boss I‚Äôve ever had. Gave me a shot when he had every reason not to, forgave a few mistakes he shouldn‚Äôt have, and, all in all, is a great guy. 

‚ÄúDerek, where in the hell is your white wash?‚Äù Eamon Simmons, farmer-at-large says. 

‚ÄúEamon, I have it on good authority that it‚Äôs been in the same place since before I was born. ‚Äú I reply, ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs the kids?‚Äù 

The rotund, red faced man walks over, a grin on his face. 

‚ÄúTrying their best, Steve‚Äôs working at an auction , Jess is in college. Damned if I understand what she‚Äôs taking but she enjoys it. 

Me, just ankle deep in cow shit from dawn to dusk. ‚Äú Eamon complains. 

‚ÄúDirty boots clean money. That‚Äôll be $5.80.‚Äù I say, working the old, barely-electronic register. 

‚ÄúHighway god-damned robbery. ‚Äú Eamon says in a friendly enough tone, producing his cash. 

‚ÄúI see that truck of yours, you can afford it.‚Äù I reply with a smirk. 

And that basic type of interaction, is my nine to five. I‚Äôm originally from Michigan, took me a bit to understand what Texas friendly is, but once I got the hang of it, folks saw past the tattoos, piercings and checkered past. 

Not that I haven‚Äôt ran into some more, archetypal Texans, but by and large, people where I am are easy going. 

When shit hits the fan , the things you remember are random. For some reason it always sticks out to me that all of this started on a Monday. 

Chuck had just gotten back from vacation and entered the store with an approving look. 

‚Äú Looks like you didn‚Äôt manage to burn the joint down, good job kid. ‚Äú He says, short grey hair barely visible under a simple brown baseball cap.

‚ÄúThought about it when Mrs. Olsen ordered two dozen garden gnomes, but managed to fight the urge. 

How was trip south?‚Äù I reply cracking open an energy drink. 

‚ÄúBueno. How many times I have to tell you, that shit is going to kill you?‚Äù Chuck asks, shaking his head. 

‚ÄúThe definition of insanity is trying the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. ‚Äú is my answer. 

I‚Äôll spare you the details of the day but as it wrapped up both of us were worn out as hell. 

‚ÄúFeel like downing a few at Norm‚Äôs? ‚Äú chuck asks as he turns an open/closed sign that looks exactly as one would expect. 

 ‚ÄúMight-could.‚Äù I say, chuckling a bit to myself at some of the dialect that has crept into my speech, ‚Äú As long as my boss doesn‚Äôt call me in tomorrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúSon, I have a sneaking suspicion the water heater is going to blow and we‚Äôre sadly going to have to close up for a couple days. This old-hand needs a little vacation from his vacation. ‚Äú Chuck jokes as we leave the store. 

Norm‚Äôs is an odd kind of place. In reality it‚Äôs your generic small town bar. Decent amount of personality, nothing too exciting going on but it‚Äôs trying to go for a chain restaurant kind of look.  

Chuck and I  sit down, and before we manage to strike up a conversation, a pitcher of bud is sitting on the table in front of us. 

‚ÄúThanks Ken!‚Äù I shout to the combination barhand/bouncer. His forearms are covered in scars from his day job at a scrapyard. 

Behind the bar are two women, Casey, a farm-girl around my age working her way through a second run at college . And Alice, probably the only person in this city I can talk to about body art. 

Late forties, ex-cop, and known to lend Ken a hand during the odd dust-up that happens. 

It was nearing ten, that crucial moment in a night of drinking where one needs to decide whether it‚Äôs an early pass-out or a late night. 

‚ÄúI forgot to tell you, did you hear what happened to Leo‚Äôs kid?‚Äù  I question. 

‚ÄúNo, he okay?‚Äù Chuck asks. 

I‚Äôm no where near drunk, but I swear I‚Äôve never seen Chuck get beyond tipsy. He‚Äôs spent half the night catching up and downing drinks with every other old coot in the city and seems just fine. 

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs alive, but man, it was the damndest thing. 

Kid was out on a deer hunt, long-guns , obviously. 

Blows a hand clean off. Nothing Doc Miller could do for it.  

Still up in a hospital near Dallas. It‚Äôs a shame, kid was only 18. ‚Äú  I don‚Äôt know why I chose such a morbid topic, but booze doesn‚Äôt tend to do positive things for the mind. 

Chuck looks stoic, maybe even a bit pissed off. 

‚ÄúWhich hand?‚Äù he asks, deadpan. 

‚ÄúRight. Listen , if I seemed like I was making fun of the kid, I wasn‚Äôt. ‚Äú I reply, trying to smooth over whatever mistake I made. 

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt say anything wrong. ‚Äú Chuck offers as an explanation, but he still has that worried, miserable tone. 

If there is one thing I‚Äôve learned about Chuck , it‚Äôs that when he wants to stop a conversation, it‚Äôs best to listen. 

As weird as it was, after a couple of weeks, I‚Äôd forgotten all about the cloud that passed over chuck that night. Chalking it up to one too many, and a bad choice of topic. 

But one Wednesday in mid September , Chuck didn‚Äôt show up to open the store. Nothing I couldn‚Äôt handle, of course, but not so much as a call. 

It was 11 am and I was nearly drowning in customers. As much as I owe Chuck, I was about thirty minutes away from a pissed off phone call when he came walking in the door. 

‚ÄúHey boss, need you to‚Ä¶‚Äù I start, trying to get Chuck‚Äôs attention. 

He has his hat pulled low, and walks straight by me, closing the ancient door to his office with a little too much gusto. 

It‚Äôs early afternoon by the time I get a second to go back and talk to Chuck. 

The first smell that hits me is sweat, the kind of vinegar  reek that comes only from fear. The second is booze. 

‚ÄúWhat the hell? You‚Äôre day drinking?‚Äù I say, more confused than angry. 

The laminate desk Chuck sits behind is worn with age, it‚Äôs chrome legs, dull and clouded. 

‚ÄúBig Tim got in a car wreck last night. ‚Äú Chuck says, not turning my way. 

‚ÄúYeah, I heard. Is that what has you walking around with a coffee that smells like paint thinner?

He‚Äôs going to be fine, totaled that Firebird of his, but he‚Äôs back home already. ‚Äú I explain. 

‚ÄúI know, went to go see him.‚Äù Chuck says, taking a long swallow of what I‚Äôm guessing is a cup of ¬º coffee and ¬æ booze. 

‚ÄúAt what point do I get let in on the joke here? You're fucking scaring me with this thousand yard stare shit. ‚Äú  Something about the way this granite statue of a man is acting sets the hairs on the back of my neck on end. 

‚ÄúLock the door kid, we need to talk.‚Äù Chuck says , finally looking at me. 

He hasn‚Äôt slept, and there‚Äôs a look of horror in his eyes, no amount of poker-face can hide. 

I do as he asks, and pull up an old, green office chair to his desk. 

‚ÄúYou ever experienced something you can‚Äôt explain? ‚Äú He asks, point blank, almost, wistfully. 

‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôve ever seen bigfoot or anything, but I‚Äôm sure there is some weird shit out there. ‚Äú is my answer. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not talking about something ,off. 

I‚Äôm talking the kind of thing that has you wondering if it ever really happened. ‚Äú Chuck‚Äôs tone is depressed and hopeful all at the same time. 

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt say that I have, you?‚Äù I lead. 

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve got a reefer in your coat, it‚Äôd probably help my cause for you to smoke it. ‚Äú Chuck begins, with a chuckle, ‚Äú What I‚Äôve got to say isn‚Äôt very high on the believability scale. 

Back in my twenties, I was a different man. Bit of a wanderer, bit of a roughneck, but something kept brining me back here. 

Of course, the town was different then, smaller, closer. It was ‚Äô72 and folks around here were breathing a sigh of relief that the swinging sixties had come to an end. 

The town was doing well, except for one thing. Well, one person really. 

Elroy Kinston. 

A town bully, not something that‚Äôs going to happen nowadays. Even out here, you‚Äôve got cameras on you every second of the day. 

But back then, in a little burg like this, one man could cause a lot of misery. 

He was the kind of ornery, vindictive prick who knows how the law works. 

He was ten years or so older than myself, almost a boogeyman growing up.  

He said he was a biker, but he was just an asshole with a crotch-rocket. Never saw the man with a friend let alone a gang. 

Of course the law would get him for things here and there, a couple months for a fight that got out of hand, weekend jail for pushing drugs, but nothing major. 

When it came to real time, Elroy had the devil‚Äôs luck. 

By ‚Äô70 or so, he‚Äôd beaten a manslaughter wrap, and at that point, folks decided to just give the man his space. Better to be cleaning up broken windows, or nursing a black eye than six feet under. 

One night, I found myself at Norm‚Äôs, by my lonesome and looking for some female companionship. 

The night went on and nothing of the sort came my way. 

The bar was full of mining boys, engineers from the quarry. Good guys, but we‚Äôre talking college boys, not miners. Soft men. 

Elroy walked in, and I could smell the bad intentions on him. 

But it‚Äôs a free country, man can drink where he pleases. So I just watched, and drank.

He's got a conman‚Äôs charm and soon enough, he‚Äôs made a couple of friends who are more than happy to buy a few rounds. 

I‚Äôve seen this before. Soon enough Elroy is going to find something to take offence to, and one of these College boys is going to be missing teeth. 

Good sense told me to stay out of it. But something about his smirking, coyote look, got my dander up. 

He steps backward into one of his new friends, I can‚Äôt hear the conversation, but I can see what‚Äôs going to happen. 

As the engineer apologizes, I down my drink. As Elroy starts to shout, I‚Äôm out of my chair. 

I take out my wallet, as Elroy starts to get into the man‚Äôs face. 

I‚Äôve paid for my beer when the engineer is shoved, it catches the five foot seven man totally off guard. He hits the ground on his ass. 

Elroy, he‚Äôs about my size, greasy curled hair, and plenty of yard-bird muscle. 

Well, I inform him that if he intends on a fight that night, it sure as hell isn‚Äôt going to be with the man pissing himself on the floor. 

The situation got tense, but guys like him aren‚Äôt looking for a square fight. He makes some threats and leaves. 

Came at me from an alley on the walk home though. 

I got my bearings quick enough, and it turned into a typical drunken fight. Nothing I hadn‚Äôt been through a dozen times. 

Never been stabbed before though, it was a real hollow, deep pain in my bicep. 

I don‚Äôt remember much in specific, but that knife found it‚Äôs way into it‚Äôs owner‚Äôs chest. 

Elroy hit the ground, a cheap, pawn shop switchblade deep in his ribs. Still alive, but on his way out. 

I could have called the law, hell , could have called an ambulance, but I didn‚Äôt. I wasn‚Äôt going to roll the dice on the rest of my life because of Elroy fucking Kinston. 

So I finished the job, did the world a favor, and buried that son-of-a-bitch ten feet deep where no one would ever find him. ‚Äú

‚ÄúSo you killed a guy?‚Äù I say, shocked.

‚ÄúThought I did. 

The very next day, Elroy was driving that rat-rod of his, down main street, not a mark on him. ‚Äú Chuck looks to me as he talks, trying to judge if I‚Äôm believing him or not, ‚Äú After that, things started happening. It started with fires, accidents, floods. But eventually, turned to folks talking about the kinds of things that belong in a midnight movie. 

No one knew how, or why, no one but me that is. 

I watched for a year as this place turned from unlucky, to god-damned cursed. ‚Äú Chuck pauses, he‚Äôs actually shaking, ‚Äú You think I‚Äôm full of shit don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

‚Äú Real answer? Undecided. 

What do you mean, cursed?‚Äù

‚ÄúEvery town has stories, a couple of odd-ducks who say they‚Äôve seen ghosts, or some preacher who swears he‚Äôs been face to face with old scratch. 

During that year, damn near everyone in Harrington had a story other folks wouldn‚Äôt believe. It was like we were a magnet for all of the darkest things in the world. 

Something had to be done. 

I got 6 of my closest friends and told them everything I knew. One took off upstate, the other 5 and I decided to try our hand at stopping things. 

We did our best to figure out what happened, but back then there was no internet, the world was a much smaller place. All we could find were rumors, tall tales, and wild speculation. And even then, pickings were thin.‚Äù Chuck stops for a second while he drinks more of his ‚Äòcoffee‚Äô.

‚ÄúSlow down with that. 

What did you guys do?‚Äù I say, whether I believe him or not, I‚Äôm interested.

‚ÄúNathan, the sheriff‚Äôs deputy figured he‚Äôd go at him head on. Ski mask, and scattergun in the middle of the night. 

When they found his body, they figured it was a bear.

We knew this problem needed some kind of, what‚Äôs the word?‚Äù  Chuck asks. 

‚ÄúEsoteric?‚Äù I guess. 

‚ÄúSeems close enough.  Esoteric , solution. But we didn‚Äôt have one, we were 5 young men from the middle of nowhere. We had nothing more than grit and the stupidity of youth on our side. 

Another thing that was different back then was how easy it was to get your hands on explosives.  Folks just trusted each other more I guess. Either that or lunatics hadn‚Äôt started abusing the privilege.

So we figured if we couldn‚Äôt find anything, esoteric, we‚Äôd do the next best thing. 

We went in knowing we might not come out. And that was true for all but two of us.  

I saw things at that lunatic‚Äôs shack that still make me wonder if god  has an eye on his children any more. But Kyle and Quint, then gave themselves to turn that place into a crater. 

The man himself was my job. 

Face to face, there was a power about him, a dark fog that hung around Elroy. It made my blood run cold. 

He chased me through the sickly , dying trees, scattering downed branches and brush like it wasn‚Äôt even there. No man can move like he did. 

I lost him somewhere near the tree-line. But saw him again when I got to my truck, leaning against it with one hand. 

Tim and I, we we‚Äôre plan B, there was no plan C. 

In the dead of night, through  leaves, and branches, Tim made the shot. 

The  first barbed,  steel bolt pierced Elroy‚Äôs hand, sticking to the door of the truck.  The second did much of the same to his thigh. 

Elroy tore at his limbs like a trapped wolf, he ripped his hand clean off in about 6 seconds. 

The bundle of TNT I lobbed at his feet had a seven second fuse. 

There was nothing left of Elroy, his house, or my truck. 

We figured that was the end of things. 

Now, I‚Äôm not so sure. ‚Äú Chuck finishes his story, trying to read my reaction. 

‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm definitely not high enough for this. ‚Äú I say.

‚ÄúSo you think I‚Äôm full of shit?‚Äù Chuck accuses. 

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs say I don‚Äôt, for the sake of argument. What does that have to do with what's going on now?‚Äù I ask. 

‚ÄúTim was ran off the road. ‚Äú Chuck says, ‚Äú The man that did it said he had a message from Elroy. 

He says, he‚Äôll be seeing us soon.‚Äù

‚ÄúChuck, I don‚Äôt know if I believe all the paranormal stuff , but by the fact things have you like this, I know you are involved with some bad people. 

I‚Äôve got a record, man. You know this. 

 I can‚Äôt afford to get mixed up in some old-school blood feud going on so long it‚Äôs developed legends. ‚Äú My tone is a mix of shame and anger, ‚Äú And besides, you know me, I‚Äôm not a fighter. If this guy has some brother or friend trying to screw with you, plenty of folks around here would have your back. ‚Äú

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the problem kid, I‚Äôve seen how people in this town react when things start going sideways in a way they can‚Äôt understand. 

But I respect your decision, any way this hand plays out is going to get messy, and you don‚Äôt need any more of that in your life.

If you‚Äôre fixing to leave, I‚Äôve got 5k in cash to help you get the hell away from this place. No hard feelings. ‚Äú Chuck finishes the offer and his coffee at nearly the same time. 


The fact I didn‚Äôt take the money and run was one in a long list of stupid decisions I‚Äôve made in my life. But something inside me made me feel that I owed the old man. If he needed me to hold a baseball bat and try to look scary,  why not? 

So I found myself at Norm‚Äôs , drinking slowly and alone. Trying to make sense of the growing level of strange in my life. 

The answer I found at the bottom of a bottle was as follows:

My friend chuck, has likely been suffering from PTSD for a long time. He‚Äôs taken the event that caused it, mixed it up with a few memories from his time in the service ( I assume. ) and made it into some kind of paranormal event in his mind. 

That being said, scumbag families hold grudges, that goes double in isolated burgs like this. Decades mean nothing. 

Chuck needs help, and for all the dumb things I‚Äôve caught time for, if worst comes to worst, at least this will be for a good cause. 

Riding a good buzz and a moral high, I found myself walking home under the harsh arc lights of main street. 

It was quiet, a little under an hour before last call, the street was calm. It felt like I had the town to myself. 

As many times as I‚Äôve seen the inside of a jail cell, I‚Äôm not a tough guy. When me and the law come into conflict, violence isn‚Äôt the reason. Hell, even on the inside, I got by minding my own business and keeping the right friends. 

So , as I walk I start to think about how I‚Äôm going to go about convincing some inbred criminal to leave my friend alone. 

I‚Äôm on my third inebriated draft of an absolutely terrible scary speech when I hear it. 

It‚Äôs quiet at first, as if off in the distance. A rattling, grinding noise, an engine barely managing to run. 

I look back to see what piece of shit bike was living out it‚Äôs last seconds. Hoping i catch sight of it‚Äôs owner. 

I see nothing at first, then a couple blocks away, the streetlights on either side of the road burst. 

The roaring, decrepit engine suddenly seems much closer, the sound rising almost instantly. 

The next streetlights burst in a spray of broken glass and molten filament, keeping whatever dying conveyance I‚Äôm hearing out of my sight. 

One part of my brain is screaming at me to run, or hide. The other is telling me that I‚Äôm being an idiot and nearly having a heart attack over some faulty wiring that was likely last replaced well before I was born. 

So, for a moment, I stand, indecisive, transfixed. 

I catch a glimpse, for just a fraction of a second right before the next set of lights explode. 

I don‚Äôt see a bike, but I see a dozen or so silhouettes. People clad in black, walking nearly in unison. 

The sound starts to reach window rattling levels, the lights are destroying themselves quicker. Common sense finally takes hold. 

I bolt in the opposite direction as fast as my booze hindered legs will carry me. 

The engine‚Äôs roar brings to mind the scream of something massive, old, and evil. 

I skid to a stop, losing balance, and a decent amount of flesh from my palms as I scramble to get back to my feet. 

About two blocks away, the lights in front of me begin to burst. On either side, pitch black night begins to encroach.  The engine roar hits me in stereo now.  Loud enough to be painful. 

Panic and fear hit me hard enough to threaten consciousness. 

   I don‚Äôt think, I turn right down an alley, seeing some kind of refuge in the dim light from aging scones in the wall. 

As I do, the noise of the engine suddenly cuts off. My ears are ringing, sweat pours from me, drenching my shirt. I try the rusted handles of disused doors to no avail. 

I scream for help, someone has to hear me. 

But then again, someone has to have heard the earth-shaking sound of the engine. Yet no one seems to be investigating. 

No fire escapes, nothing that could be used as a weapon. I feel trapped, and for some reason, small. 

My back is to the wall, and while I can‚Äôt see a damn thing, I can hear footsteps, slow, purposeful footsteps. 

The last set of lights destroy themselves, plunging me into pure darkness. 

Silence, a ringing lack of volume, pregnant with the potential of violence and evil. 

A hiss,  my eyes burn with a sudden brightness, tearing up. It takes me a few seconds to make sense of what, or rather, who, I‚Äôm seeing.

She‚Äôs  a few inches taller than me, her bald head is covered in overlapping layers of scars. Some look purposeful, others like the reminders of brutal fights. 

She holds a road flare, head cocked, one eye slightly clouded and askew. 

The orange light makes the tattered, rusted biker‚Äôs leathers she wears look like the hide of some hell-spawned creature. 

‚ÄúYou Chuck‚Äôs friend?‚Äù she says, her voice is calm, like we just ran into each other at the coffee shop. 

I think about lying, but I figure she wouldn‚Äôt be asking if she didn‚Äôt already know. 

‚ÄúYeah, I am. ‚Äú I try to sound confident, I could spend a page describing how much I failed. 

‚Äú Good‚Äù The woman says, walking toward me, ‚ÄúMy name‚Äôs River, but you can call me, sir. ‚Äú 

She stands inches from me, I can feel the heat of the flare. 

‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù I ask. 

Before I realize it the woman has me by the throat, nails filed to wicked points dig into my neck hard enough to draw blood. I try to get away, she‚Äôs tall, but rail thin. Somehow though, her grip is immovable. 

She pokes my chest with the flare, just a brief fraction of a second of contact, but the pain is bad enough I drench her arm in vomit. 

Disgusted she easily throws me into the opposite wall. I hear the action of a switchblade and see her holding a wicked, serrated blade as she stalks toward my prone form. 

‚ÄúYou fucking deaf, or stupid?‚Äù she demands, ‚Äú Try that again.‚Äù

I pat out the smoldering fabric of my shirt, river wipes her sleeve on my head, studs and chains tearing out chunks of hair. 

‚ÄúWhat did you want, sir?‚Äù I say, trying to stand, every muscle screaming in pain. 

‚ÄúThere you go. 

What I want, is for you to get a message to Chuck. 

Elroy is giving him 7 days to get his shit in order. Then things get interesting. ‚Äú  River shows disgust when she talks about Chuck. 

Fighter or not, I decide to swing for the fences and run for the hills. My fist isn‚Äôt even half way cocked backward before River casually has the knife a quarter inch from my eye. 

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt. ‚Äú She says, bluntly, ‚Äú See, I‚Äôm a real forgiving type. Being nice, it‚Äôs just in my nature. 

But, the boss? He doesn‚Äôt really, let things go. ‚Äú 

As she talks, she moves the knife upward, drawing my gaze to the night sky. 

As the flare goes out, in the gloom, and scant starlight, I see it. 

It‚Äôs barely visible, an ethereal, suggestion of a massive, twisted human form. A wicked thing, floating above the assembled, leather clad people like an evil miasma. 

I can‚Äôt see eyes, I‚Äôm not even sure I can see the thing itself, but I can feel it looking at me. 

  I can‚Äôt do anything but shut my eyes against the sanity straining horror in front of me. I expect my throat to be cut, or my heart to be pierced at any second. 

But the death blow never comes. When I finally muster the courage to open my eyes, I‚Äôm alone. The street is lit, and if it wasn‚Äôt for the fact I‚Äôve been beaten and burned to hell, I might think it was all just some kind of hallucination. 

But the blistered, weeping wound in my chest isn‚Äôt a hallucination. And I know, neither was that thing that was herding River and her friends. 

I feel like a spec of dust caught up in a tornado. And when I finally make it to Chuck‚Äôs house, body screaming for rest and medical attention, the old man is waiting as if expecting me. 

‚Äú We‚Äôve got a week.‚Äù I say grimly. 

‚ÄúWe drinking ourselves to death, or trying to figure out the mysteries of the universe in a week?‚Äù Chuck asks. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the boss. ‚Äú I say,  figuring both options will amount to the same in the end.

1fxme9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/MrCreepyPasta/comments/1fxme9l/hardware_part_1/,Hardware: Part 1,"If you asked me what I‚Äôd be doing with my life when I was in high school, probably dead last on the list would be working at a hardware store in an overgrown Texas town that decided to vainly call itself a city a few decades back. 

But, plans change, life happens and things fall through. 

My boss is a man named Charles ‚Äò Chuck‚Äô Rogers. The name fits the man, he‚Äôs never told me his exact age but he‚Äôs well past sixty. 

He stands six foot three, and old man or not, he‚Äôs built like a boxer. 

Me, I‚Äôm half his age, half his size, and rocking a decent amount of body art that can‚Äôt really be hidden by  the red plaid shirt that serves as an informal uniform. 

We share sweet fuck-all in common, but for the past decade or so, he‚Äôs been the best boss I‚Äôve ever had. Gave me a shot when he had every reason not to, forgave a few mistakes he shouldn‚Äôt have, and, all in all, is a great guy. 

‚ÄúDerek, where in the hell is your white wash?‚Äù Eamon Simmons, farmer-at-large says. 

‚ÄúEamon, I have it on good authority that it‚Äôs been in the same place since before I was born. ‚Äú I reply, ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs the kids?‚Äù 

The rotund, red faced man walks over, a grin on his face. 

‚ÄúTrying their best, Steve‚Äôs working at an auction , Jess is in college. Damned if I understand what she‚Äôs taking but she enjoys it. 

Me, just ankle deep in cow shit from dawn to dusk. ‚Äú Eamon complains. 

‚ÄúDirty boots clean money. That‚Äôll be $5.80.‚Äù I say, working the old, barely-electronic register. 

‚ÄúHighway god-damned robbery. ‚Äú Eamon says in a friendly enough tone, producing his cash. 

‚ÄúI see that truck of yours, you can afford it.‚Äù I reply with a smirk. 

And that basic type of interaction, is my nine to five. I‚Äôm originally from Michigan, took me a bit to understand what Texas friendly is, but once I got the hang of it, folks saw past the tattoos, piercings and checkered past. 

Not that I haven‚Äôt ran into some more, archetypal Texans, but by and large, people where I am are easy going. 

When shit hits the fan , the things you remember are random. For some reason it always sticks out to me that all of this started on a Monday. 

Chuck had just gotten back from vacation and entered the store with an approving look. 

‚Äú Looks like you didn‚Äôt manage to burn the joint down, good job kid. ‚Äú He says, short grey hair barely visible under a simple brown baseball cap.

‚ÄúThought about it when Mrs. Olsen ordered two dozen garden gnomes, but managed to fight the urge. 

How was trip south?‚Äù I reply cracking open an energy drink. 

‚ÄúBueno. How many times I have to tell you, that shit is going to kill you?‚Äù Chuck asks, shaking his head. 

‚ÄúThe definition of insanity is trying the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. ‚Äú is my answer. 

I‚Äôll spare you the details of the day but as it wrapped up both of us were worn out as hell. 

‚ÄúFeel like downing a few at Norm‚Äôs? ‚Äú chuck asks as he turns an open/closed sign that looks exactly as one would expect. 

 ‚ÄúMight-could.‚Äù I say, chuckling a bit to myself at some of the dialect that has crept into my speech, ‚Äú As long as my boss doesn‚Äôt call me in tomorrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúSon, I have a sneaking suspicion the water heater is going to blow and we‚Äôre sadly going to have to close up for a couple days. This old-hand needs a little vacation from his vacation. ‚Äú Chuck jokes as we leave the store. 

Norm‚Äôs is an odd kind of place. In reality it‚Äôs your generic small town bar. Decent amount of personality, nothing too exciting going on but it‚Äôs trying to go for a chain restaurant kind of look.  

Chuck and I  sit down, and before we manage to strike up a conversation, a pitcher of bud is sitting on the table in front of us. 

‚ÄúThanks Ken!‚Äù I shout to the combination barhand/bouncer. His forearms are covered in scars from his day job at a scrapyard. 

Behind the bar are two women, Casey, a farm-girl around my age working her way through a second run at college . And Alice, probably the only person in this city I can talk to about body art. 

Late forties, ex-cop, and known to lend Ken a hand during the odd dust-up that happens. 

It was nearing ten, that crucial moment in a night of drinking where one needs to decide whether it‚Äôs an early pass-out or a late night. 

‚ÄúI forgot to tell you, did you hear what happened to Leo‚Äôs kid?‚Äù  I question. 

‚ÄúNo, he okay?‚Äù Chuck asks. 

I‚Äôm no where near drunk, but I swear I‚Äôve never seen Chuck get beyond tipsy. He‚Äôs spent half the night catching up and downing drinks with every other old coot in the city and seems just fine. 

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs alive, but man, it was the damndest thing. 

Kid was out on a deer hunt, long-guns , obviously. 

Blows a hand clean off. Nothing Doc Miller could do for it.  

Still up in a hospital near Dallas. It‚Äôs a shame, kid was only 18. ‚Äú  I don‚Äôt know why I chose such a morbid topic, but booze doesn‚Äôt tend to do positive things for the mind. 

Chuck looks stoic, maybe even a bit pissed off. 

‚ÄúWhich hand?‚Äù he asks, deadpan. 

‚ÄúRight. Listen , if I seemed like I was making fun of the kid, I wasn‚Äôt. ‚Äú I reply, trying to smooth over whatever mistake I made. 

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt say anything wrong. ‚Äú Chuck offers as an explanation, but he still has that worried, miserable tone. 

If there is one thing I‚Äôve learned about Chuck , it‚Äôs that when he wants to stop a conversation, it‚Äôs best to listen. 

As weird as it was, after a couple of weeks, I‚Äôd forgotten all about the cloud that passed over chuck that night. Chalking it up to one too many, and a bad choice of topic. 

But one Wednesday in mid September , Chuck didn‚Äôt show up to open the store. Nothing I couldn‚Äôt handle, of course, but not so much as a call. 

It was 11 am and I was nearly drowning in customers. As much as I owe Chuck, I was about thirty minutes away from a pissed off phone call when he came walking in the door. 

‚ÄúHey boss, need you to‚Ä¶‚Äù I start, trying to get Chuck‚Äôs attention. 

He has his hat pulled low, and walks straight by me, closing the ancient door to his office with a little too much gusto. 

It‚Äôs early afternoon by the time I get a second to go back and talk to Chuck. 

The first smell that hits me is sweat, the kind of vinegar  reek that comes only from fear. The second is booze. 

‚ÄúWhat the hell? You‚Äôre day drinking?‚Äù I say, more confused than angry. 

The laminate desk Chuck sits behind is worn with age, it‚Äôs chrome legs, dull and clouded. 

‚ÄúBig Tim got in a car wreck last night. ‚Äú Chuck says, not turning my way. 

‚ÄúYeah, I heard. Is that what has you walking around with a coffee that smells like paint thinner?

He‚Äôs going to be fine, totaled that Firebird of his, but he‚Äôs back home already. ‚Äú I explain. 

‚ÄúI know, went to go see him.‚Äù Chuck says, taking a long swallow of what I‚Äôm guessing is a cup of ¬º coffee and ¬æ booze. 

‚ÄúAt what point do I get let in on the joke here? You're fucking scaring me with this thousand yard stare shit. ‚Äú  Something about the way this granite statue of a man is acting sets the hairs on the back of my neck on end. 

‚ÄúLock the door kid, we need to talk.‚Äù Chuck says , finally looking at me. 

He hasn‚Äôt slept, and there‚Äôs a look of horror in his eyes, no amount of poker-face can hide. 

I do as he asks, and pull up an old, green office chair to his desk. 

‚ÄúYou ever experienced something you can‚Äôt explain? ‚Äú He asks, point blank, almost, wistfully. 

‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôve ever seen bigfoot or anything, but I‚Äôm sure there is some weird shit out there. ‚Äú is my answer. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not talking about something ,off. 

I‚Äôm talking the kind of thing that has you wondering if it ever really happened. ‚Äú Chuck‚Äôs tone is depressed and hopeful all at the same time. 

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt say that I have, you?‚Äù I lead. 

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve got a reefer in your coat, it‚Äôd probably help my cause for you to smoke it. ‚Äú Chuck begins, with a chuckle, ‚Äú What I‚Äôve got to say isn‚Äôt very high on the believability scale. 

Back in my twenties, I was a different man. Bit of a wanderer, bit of a roughneck, but something kept brining me back here. 

Of course, the town was different then, smaller, closer. It was ‚Äô72 and folks around here were breathing a sigh of relief that the swinging sixties had come to an end. 

The town was doing well, except for one thing. Well, one person really. 

Elroy Kinston. 

A town bully, not something that‚Äôs going to happen nowadays. Even out here, you‚Äôve got cameras on you every second of the day. 

But back then, in a little burg like this, one man could cause a lot of misery. 

He was the kind of ornery, vindictive prick who knows how the law works. 

He was ten years or so older than myself, almost a boogeyman growing up.  

He said he was a biker, but he was just an asshole with a crotch-rocket. Never saw the man with a friend let alone a gang. 

Of course the law would get him for things here and there, a couple months for a fight that got out of hand, weekend jail for pushing drugs, but nothing major. 

When it came to real time, Elroy had the devil‚Äôs luck. 

By ‚Äô70 or so, he‚Äôd beaten a manslaughter wrap, and at that point, folks decided to just give the man his space. Better to be cleaning up broken windows, or nursing a black eye than six feet under. 

One night, I found myself at Norm‚Äôs, by my lonesome and looking for some female companionship. 

The night went on and nothing of the sort came my way. 

The bar was full of mining boys, engineers from the quarry. Good guys, but we‚Äôre talking college boys, not miners. Soft men. 

Elroy walked in, and I could smell the bad intentions on him. 

But it‚Äôs a free country, man can drink where he pleases. So I just watched, and drank.

He's got a conman‚Äôs charm and soon enough, he‚Äôs made a couple of friends who are more than happy to buy a few rounds. 

I‚Äôve seen this before. Soon enough Elroy is going to find something to take offence to, and one of these College boys is going to be missing teeth. 

Good sense told me to stay out of it. But something about his smirking, coyote look, got my dander up. 

He steps backward into one of his new friends, I can‚Äôt hear the conversation, but I can see what‚Äôs going to happen. 

As the engineer apologizes, I down my drink. As Elroy starts to shout, I‚Äôm out of my chair. 

I take out my wallet, as Elroy starts to get into the man‚Äôs face. 

I‚Äôve paid for my beer when the engineer is shoved, it catches the five foot seven man totally off guard. He hits the ground on his ass. 

Elroy, he‚Äôs about my size, greasy curled hair, and plenty of yard-bird muscle. 

Well, I inform him that if he intends on a fight that night, it sure as hell isn‚Äôt going to be with the man pissing himself on the floor. 

The situation got tense, but guys like him aren‚Äôt looking for a square fight. He makes some threats and leaves. 

Came at me from an alley on the walk home though. 

I got my bearings quick enough, and it turned into a typical drunken fight. Nothing I hadn‚Äôt been through a dozen times. 

Never been stabbed before though, it was a real hollow, deep pain in my bicep. 

I don‚Äôt remember much in specific, but that knife found it‚Äôs way into it‚Äôs owner‚Äôs chest. 

Elroy hit the ground, a cheap, pawn shop switchblade deep in his ribs. Still alive, but on his way out. 

I could have called the law, hell , could have called an ambulance, but I didn‚Äôt. I wasn‚Äôt going to roll the dice on the rest of my life because of Elroy fucking Kinston. 

So I finished the job, did the world a favor, and buried that son-of-a-bitch ten feet deep where no one would ever find him. ‚Äú

‚ÄúSo you killed a guy?‚Äù I say, shocked.

‚ÄúThought I did. 

The very next day, Elroy was driving that rat-rod of his, down main street, not a mark on him. ‚Äú Chuck looks to me as he talks, trying to judge if I‚Äôm believing him or not, ‚Äú After that, things started happening. It started with fires, accidents, floods. But eventually, turned to folks talking about the kinds of things that belong in a midnight movie. 

No one knew how, or why, no one but me that is. 

I watched for a year as this place turned from unlucky, to god-damned cursed. ‚Äú Chuck pauses, he‚Äôs actually shaking, ‚Äú You think I‚Äôm full of shit don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

‚Äú Real answer? Undecided. 

What do you mean, cursed?‚Äù

‚ÄúEvery town has stories, a couple of odd-ducks who say they‚Äôve seen ghosts, or some preacher who swears he‚Äôs been face to face with old scratch. 

During that year, damn near everyone in Harrington had a story other folks wouldn‚Äôt believe. It was like we were a magnet for all of the darkest things in the world. 

Something had to be done. 

I got 6 of my closest friends and told them everything I knew. One took off upstate, the other 5 and I decided to try our hand at stopping things. 

We did our best to figure out what happened, but back then there was no internet, the world was a much smaller place. All we could find were rumors, tall tales, and wild speculation. And even then, pickings were thin.‚Äù Chuck stops for a second while he drinks more of his ‚Äòcoffee‚Äô.

‚ÄúSlow down with that. 

What did you guys do?‚Äù I say, whether I believe him or not, I‚Äôm interested.

‚ÄúNathan, the sheriff‚Äôs deputy figured he‚Äôd go at him head on. Ski mask, and scattergun in the middle of the night. 

When they found his body, they figured it was a bear.

We knew this problem needed some kind of, what‚Äôs the word?‚Äù  Chuck asks. 

‚ÄúEsoteric?‚Äù I guess. 

‚ÄúSeems close enough.  Esoteric , solution. But we didn‚Äôt have one, we were 5 young men from the middle of nowhere. We had nothing more than grit and the stupidity of youth on our side. 

Another thing that was different back then was how easy it was to get your hands on explosives.  Folks just trusted each other more I guess. Either that or lunatics hadn‚Äôt started abusing the privilege.

So we figured if we couldn‚Äôt find anything, esoteric, we‚Äôd do the next best thing. 

We went in knowing we might not come out. And that was true for all but two of us.  

I saw things at that lunatic‚Äôs shack that still make me wonder if god  has an eye on his children any more. But Kyle and Quint, then gave themselves to turn that place into a crater. 

The man himself was my job. 

Face to face, there was a power about him, a dark fog that hung around Elroy. It made my blood run cold. 

He chased me through the sickly , dying trees, scattering downed branches and brush like it wasn‚Äôt even there. No man can move like he did. 

I lost him somewhere near the tree-line. But saw him again when I got to my truck, leaning against it with one hand. 

Tim and I, we we‚Äôre plan B, there was no plan C. 

In the dead of night, through  leaves, and branches, Tim made the shot. 

The  first barbed,  steel bolt pierced Elroy‚Äôs hand, sticking to the door of the truck.  The second did much of the same to his thigh. 

Elroy tore at his limbs like a trapped wolf, he ripped his hand clean off in about 6 seconds. 

The bundle of TNT I lobbed at his feet had a seven second fuse. 

There was nothing left of Elroy, his house, or my truck. 

We figured that was the end of things. 

Now, I‚Äôm not so sure. ‚Äú Chuck finishes his story, trying to read my reaction. 

‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm definitely not high enough for this. ‚Äú I say.

‚ÄúSo you think I‚Äôm full of shit?‚Äù Chuck accuses. 

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs say I don‚Äôt, for the sake of argument. What does that have to do with what's going on now?‚Äù I ask. 

‚ÄúTim was ran off the road. ‚Äú Chuck says, ‚Äú The man that did it said he had a message from Elroy. 

He says, he‚Äôll be seeing us soon.‚Äù

‚ÄúChuck, I don‚Äôt know if I believe all the paranormal stuff , but by the fact things have you like this, I know you are involved with some bad people. 

I‚Äôve got a record, man. You know this. 

 I can‚Äôt afford to get mixed up in some old-school blood feud going on so long it‚Äôs developed legends. ‚Äú My tone is a mix of shame and anger, ‚Äú And besides, you know me, I‚Äôm not a fighter. If this guy has some brother or friend trying to screw with you, plenty of folks around here would have your back. ‚Äú

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the problem kid, I‚Äôve seen how people in this town react when things start going sideways in a way they can‚Äôt understand. 

But I respect your decision, any way this hand plays out is going to get messy, and you don‚Äôt need any more of that in your life.

If you‚Äôre fixing to leave, I‚Äôve got 5k in cash to help you get the hell away from this place. No hard feelings. ‚Äú Chuck finishes the offer and his coffee at nearly the same time. 


The fact I didn‚Äôt take the money and run was one in a long list of stupid decisions I‚Äôve made in my life. But something inside me made me feel that I owed the old man. If he needed me to hold a baseball bat and try to look scary,  why not? 

So I found myself at Norm‚Äôs , drinking slowly and alone. Trying to make sense of the growing level of strange in my life. 

The answer I found at the bottom of a bottle was as follows:

My friend chuck, has likely been suffering from PTSD for a long time. He‚Äôs taken the event that caused it, mixed it up with a few memories from his time in the service ( I assume. ) and made it into some kind of paranormal event in his mind. 

That being said, scumbag families hold grudges, that goes double in isolated burgs like this. Decades mean nothing. 

Chuck needs help, and for all the dumb things I‚Äôve caught time for, if worst comes to worst, at least this will be for a good cause. 

Riding a good buzz and a moral high, I found myself walking home under the harsh arc lights of main street. 

It was quiet, a little under an hour before last call, the street was calm. It felt like I had the town to myself. 

As many times as I‚Äôve seen the inside of a jail cell, I‚Äôm not a tough guy. When me and the law come into conflict, violence isn‚Äôt the reason. Hell, even on the inside, I got by minding my own business and keeping the right friends. 

So , as I walk I start to think about how I‚Äôm going to go about convincing some inbred criminal to leave my friend alone. 

I‚Äôm on my third inebriated draft of an absolutely terrible scary speech when I hear it. 

It‚Äôs quiet at first, as if off in the distance. A rattling, grinding noise, an engine barely managing to run. 

I look back to see what piece of shit bike was living out it‚Äôs last seconds. Hoping i catch sight of it‚Äôs owner. 

I see nothing at first, then a couple blocks away, the streetlights on either side of the road burst. 

The roaring, decrepit engine suddenly seems much closer, the sound rising almost instantly. 

The next streetlights burst in a spray of broken glass and molten filament, keeping whatever dying conveyance I‚Äôm hearing out of my sight. 

One part of my brain is screaming at me to run, or hide. The other is telling me that I‚Äôm being an idiot and nearly having a heart attack over some faulty wiring that was likely last replaced well before I was born. 

So, for a moment, I stand, indecisive, transfixed. 

I catch a glimpse, for just a fraction of a second right before the next set of lights explode. 

I don‚Äôt see a bike, but I see a dozen or so silhouettes. People clad in black, walking nearly in unison. 

The sound starts to reach window rattling levels, the lights are destroying themselves quicker. Common sense finally takes hold. 

I bolt in the opposite direction as fast as my booze hindered legs will carry me. 

The engine‚Äôs roar brings to mind the scream of something massive, old, and evil. 

I skid to a stop, losing balance, and a decent amount of flesh from my palms as I scramble to get back to my feet. 

About two blocks away, the lights in front of me begin to burst. On either side, pitch black night begins to encroach.  The engine roar hits me in stereo now.  Loud enough to be painful. 

Panic and fear hit me hard enough to threaten consciousness. 

   I don‚Äôt think, I turn right down an alley, seeing some kind of refuge in the dim light from aging scones in the wall. 

As I do, the noise of the engine suddenly cuts off. My ears are ringing, sweat pours from me, drenching my shirt. I try the rusted handles of disused doors to no avail. 

I scream for help, someone has to hear me. 

But then again, someone has to have heard the earth-shaking sound of the engine. Yet no one seems to be investigating. 

No fire escapes, nothing that could be used as a weapon. I feel trapped, and for some reason, small. 

My back is to the wall, and while I can‚Äôt see a damn thing, I can hear footsteps, slow, purposeful footsteps. 

The last set of lights destroy themselves, plunging me into pure darkness. 

Silence, a ringing lack of volume, pregnant with the potential of violence and evil. 

A hiss,  my eyes burn with a sudden brightness, tearing up. It takes me a few seconds to make sense of what, or rather, who, I‚Äôm seeing.

She‚Äôs  a few inches taller than me, her bald head is covered in overlapping layers of scars. Some look purposeful, others like the reminders of brutal fights. 

She holds a road flare, head cocked, one eye slightly clouded and askew. 

The orange light makes the tattered, rusted biker‚Äôs leathers she wears look like the hide of some hell-spawned creature. 

‚ÄúYou Chuck‚Äôs friend?‚Äù she says, her voice is calm, like we just ran into each other at the coffee shop. 

I think about lying, but I figure she wouldn‚Äôt be asking if she didn‚Äôt already know. 

‚ÄúYeah, I am. ‚Äú I try to sound confident, I could spend a page describing how much I failed. 

‚Äú Good‚Äù The woman says, walking toward me, ‚ÄúMy name‚Äôs River, but you can call me, sir. ‚Äú 

She stands inches from me, I can feel the heat of the flare. 

‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù I ask. 

Before I realize it the woman has me by the throat, nails filed to wicked points dig into my neck hard enough to draw blood. I try to get away, she‚Äôs tall, but rail thin. Somehow though, her grip is immovable. 

She pokes my chest with the flare, just a brief fraction of a second of contact, but the pain is bad enough I drench her arm in vomit. 

Disgusted she easily throws me into the opposite wall. I hear the action of a switchblade and see her holding a wicked, serrated blade as she stalks toward my prone form. 

‚ÄúYou fucking deaf, or stupid?‚Äù she demands, ‚Äú Try that again.‚Äù

I pat out the smoldering fabric of my shirt, river wipes her sleeve on my head, studs and chains tearing out chunks of hair. 

‚ÄúWhat did you want, sir?‚Äù I say, trying to stand, every muscle screaming in pain. 

‚ÄúThere you go. 

What I want, is for you to get a message to Chuck. 

Elroy is giving him 7 days to get his shit in order. Then things get interesting. ‚Äú  River shows disgust when she talks about Chuck. 

Fighter or not, I decide to swing for the fences and run for the hills. My fist isn‚Äôt even half way cocked backward before River casually has the knife a quarter inch from my eye. 

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt. ‚Äú She says, bluntly, ‚Äú See, I‚Äôm a real forgiving type. Being nice, it‚Äôs just in my nature. 

But, the boss? He doesn‚Äôt really, let things go. ‚Äú 

As she talks, she moves the knife upward, drawing my gaze to the night sky. 

As the flare goes out, in the gloom, and scant starlight, I see it. 

It‚Äôs barely visible, an ethereal, suggestion of a massive, twisted human form. A wicked thing, floating above the assembled, leather clad people like an evil miasma. 

I can‚Äôt see eyes, I‚Äôm not even sure I can see the thing itself, but I can feel it looking at me. 

  I can‚Äôt do anything but shut my eyes against the sanity straining horror in front of me. I expect my throat to be cut, or my heart to be pierced at any second. 

But the death blow never comes. When I finally muster the courage to open my eyes, I‚Äôm alone. The street is lit, and if it wasn‚Äôt for the fact I‚Äôve been beaten and burned to hell, I might think it was all just some kind of hallucination. 

But the blistered, weeping wound in my chest isn‚Äôt a hallucination. And I know, neither was that thing that was herding River and her friends. 

I feel like a spec of dust caught up in a tornado. And when I finally make it to Chuck‚Äôs house, body screaming for rest and medical attention, the old man is waiting as if expecting me. 

‚Äú We‚Äôve got a week.‚Äù I say grimly. 

‚ÄúWe drinking ourselves to death, or trying to figure out the mysteries of the universe in a week?‚Äù Chuck asks. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the boss. ‚Äú I say,  figuring both options will amount to the same in the end.

1fxmdr1,https://www.reddit.com/r/DrCreepensVault/comments/1fxmdr1/hardware_part_1/,Hardware: Part 1,"If you asked me what I‚Äôd be doing with my life when I was in high school, probably dead last on the list would be working at a hardware store in an overgrown Texas town that decided to vainly call itself a city a few decades back. 

But, plans change, life happens and things fall through. 

My boss is a man named Charles ‚Äò Chuck‚Äô Rogers. The name fits the man, he‚Äôs never told me his exact age but he‚Äôs well past sixty. 

He stands six foot three, and old man or not, he‚Äôs built like a boxer. 

Me, I‚Äôm half his age, half his size, and rocking a decent amount of body art that can‚Äôt really be hidden by  the red plaid shirt that serves as an informal uniform. 

We share sweet fuck-all in common, but for the past decade or so, he‚Äôs been the best boss I‚Äôve ever had. Gave me a shot when he had every reason not to, forgave a few mistakes he shouldn‚Äôt have, and, all in all, is a great guy. 

‚ÄúDerek, where in the hell is your white wash?‚Äù Eamon Simmons, farmer-at-large says. 

‚ÄúEamon, I have it on good authority that it‚Äôs been in the same place since before I was born. ‚Äú I reply, ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs the kids?‚Äù 

The rotund, red faced man walks over, a grin on his face. 

‚ÄúTrying their best, Steve‚Äôs working at an auction , Jess is in college. Damned if I understand what she‚Äôs taking but she enjoys it. 

Me, just ankle deep in cow shit from dawn to dusk. ‚Äú Eamon complains. 

‚ÄúDirty boots clean money. That‚Äôll be $5.80.‚Äù I say, working the old, barely-electronic register. 

‚ÄúHighway god-damned robbery. ‚Äú Eamon says in a friendly enough tone, producing his cash. 

‚ÄúI see that truck of yours, you can afford it.‚Äù I reply with a smirk. 

And that basic type of interaction, is my nine to five. I‚Äôm originally from Michigan, took me a bit to understand what Texas friendly is, but once I got the hang of it, folks saw past the tattoos, piercings and checkered past. 

Not that I haven‚Äôt ran into some more, archetypal Texans, but by and large, people where I am are easy going. 

When shit hits the fan , the things you remember are random. For some reason it always sticks out to me that all of this started on a Monday. 

Chuck had just gotten back from vacation and entered the store with an approving look. 

‚Äú Looks like you didn‚Äôt manage to burn the joint down, good job kid. ‚Äú He says, short grey hair barely visible under a simple brown baseball cap.

‚ÄúThought about it when Mrs. Olsen ordered two dozen garden gnomes, but managed to fight the urge. 

How was trip south?‚Äù I reply cracking open an energy drink. 

‚ÄúBueno. How many times I have to tell you, that shit is going to kill you?‚Äù Chuck asks, shaking his head. 

‚ÄúThe definition of insanity is trying the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. ‚Äú is my answer. 

I‚Äôll spare you the details of the day but as it wrapped up both of us were worn out as hell. 

‚ÄúFeel like downing a few at Norm‚Äôs? ‚Äú chuck asks as he turns an open/closed sign that looks exactly as one would expect. 

 ‚ÄúMight-could.‚Äù I say, chuckling a bit to myself at some of the dialect that has crept into my speech, ‚Äú As long as my boss doesn‚Äôt call me in tomorrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúSon, I have a sneaking suspicion the water heater is going to blow and we‚Äôre sadly going to have to close up for a couple days. This old-hand needs a little vacation from his vacation. ‚Äú Chuck jokes as we leave the store. 

Norm‚Äôs is an odd kind of place. In reality it‚Äôs your generic small town bar. Decent amount of personality, nothing too exciting going on but it‚Äôs trying to go for a chain restaurant kind of look.  

Chuck and I  sit down, and before we manage to strike up a conversation, a pitcher of bud is sitting on the table in front of us. 

‚ÄúThanks Ken!‚Äù I shout to the combination barhand/bouncer. His forearms are covered in scars from his day job at a scrapyard. 

Behind the bar are two women, Casey, a farm-girl around my age working her way through a second run at college . And Alice, probably the only person in this city I can talk to about body art. 

Late forties, ex-cop, and known to lend Ken a hand during the odd dust-up that happens. 

It was nearing ten, that crucial moment in a night of drinking where one needs to decide whether it‚Äôs an early pass-out or a late night. 

‚ÄúI forgot to tell you, did you hear what happened to Leo‚Äôs kid?‚Äù  I question. 

‚ÄúNo, he okay?‚Äù Chuck asks. 

I‚Äôm no where near drunk, but I swear I‚Äôve never seen Chuck get beyond tipsy. He‚Äôs spent half the night catching up and downing drinks with every other old coot in the city and seems just fine. 

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs alive, but man, it was the damndest thing. 

Kid was out on a deer hunt, long-guns , obviously. 

Blows a hand clean off. Nothing Doc Miller could do for it.  

Still up in a hospital near Dallas. It‚Äôs a shame, kid was only 18. ‚Äú  I don‚Äôt know why I chose such a morbid topic, but booze doesn‚Äôt tend to do positive things for the mind. 

Chuck looks stoic, maybe even a bit pissed off. 

‚ÄúWhich hand?‚Äù he asks, deadpan. 

‚ÄúRight. Listen , if I seemed like I was making fun of the kid, I wasn‚Äôt. ‚Äú I reply, trying to smooth over whatever mistake I made. 

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt say anything wrong. ‚Äú Chuck offers as an explanation, but he still has that worried, miserable tone. 

If there is one thing I‚Äôve learned about Chuck , it‚Äôs that when he wants to stop a conversation, it‚Äôs best to listen. 

As weird as it was, after a couple of weeks, I‚Äôd forgotten all about the cloud that passed over chuck that night. Chalking it up to one too many, and a bad choice of topic. 

But one Wednesday in mid September , Chuck didn‚Äôt show up to open the store. Nothing I couldn‚Äôt handle, of course, but not so much as a call. 

It was 11 am and I was nearly drowning in customers. As much as I owe Chuck, I was about thirty minutes away from a pissed off phone call when he came walking in the door. 

‚ÄúHey boss, need you to‚Ä¶‚Äù I start, trying to get Chuck‚Äôs attention. 

He has his hat pulled low, and walks straight by me, closing the ancient door to his office with a little too much gusto. 

It‚Äôs early afternoon by the time I get a second to go back and talk to Chuck. 

The first smell that hits me is sweat, the kind of vinegar  reek that comes only from fear. The second is booze. 

‚ÄúWhat the hell? You‚Äôre day drinking?‚Äù I say, more confused than angry. 

The laminate desk Chuck sits behind is worn with age, it‚Äôs chrome legs, dull and clouded. 

‚ÄúBig Tim got in a car wreck last night. ‚Äú Chuck says, not turning my way. 

‚ÄúYeah, I heard. Is that what has you walking around with a coffee that smells like paint thinner?

He‚Äôs going to be fine, totaled that Firebird of his, but he‚Äôs back home already. ‚Äú I explain. 

‚ÄúI know, went to go see him.‚Äù Chuck says, taking a long swallow of what I‚Äôm guessing is a cup of ¬º coffee and ¬æ booze. 

‚ÄúAt what point do I get let in on the joke here? You're fucking scaring me with this thousand yard stare shit. ‚Äú  Something about the way this granite statue of a man is acting sets the hairs on the back of my neck on end. 

‚ÄúLock the door kid, we need to talk.‚Äù Chuck says , finally looking at me. 

He hasn‚Äôt slept, and there‚Äôs a look of horror in his eyes, no amount of poker-face can hide. 

I do as he asks, and pull up an old, green office chair to his desk. 

‚ÄúYou ever experienced something you can‚Äôt explain? ‚Äú He asks, point blank, almost, wistfully. 

‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôve ever seen bigfoot or anything, but I‚Äôm sure there is some weird shit out there. ‚Äú is my answer. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not talking about something ,off. 

I‚Äôm talking the kind of thing that has you wondering if it ever really happened. ‚Äú Chuck‚Äôs tone is depressed and hopeful all at the same time. 

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt say that I have, you?‚Äù I lead. 

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve got a reefer in your coat, it‚Äôd probably help my cause for you to smoke it. ‚Äú Chuck begins, with a chuckle, ‚Äú What I‚Äôve got to say isn‚Äôt very high on the believability scale. 

Back in my twenties, I was a different man. Bit of a wanderer, bit of a roughneck, but something kept brining me back here. 

Of course, the town was different then, smaller, closer. It was ‚Äô72 and folks around here were breathing a sigh of relief that the swinging sixties had come to an end. 

The town was doing well, except for one thing. Well, one person really. 

Elroy Kinston. 

A town bully, not something that‚Äôs going to happen nowadays. Even out here, you‚Äôve got cameras on you every second of the day. 

But back then, in a little burg like this, one man could cause a lot of misery. 

He was the kind of ornery, vindictive prick who knows how the law works. 

He was ten years or so older than myself, almost a boogeyman growing up.  

He said he was a biker, but he was just an asshole with a crotch-rocket. Never saw the man with a friend let alone a gang. 

Of course the law would get him for things here and there, a couple months for a fight that got out of hand, weekend jail for pushing drugs, but nothing major. 

When it came to real time, Elroy had the devil‚Äôs luck. 

By ‚Äô70 or so, he‚Äôd beaten a manslaughter wrap, and at that point, folks decided to just give the man his space. Better to be cleaning up broken windows, or nursing a black eye than six feet under. 

One night, I found myself at Norm‚Äôs, by my lonesome and looking for some female companionship. 

The night went on and nothing of the sort came my way. 

The bar was full of mining boys, engineers from the quarry. Good guys, but we‚Äôre talking college boys, not miners. Soft men. 

Elroy walked in, and I could smell the bad intentions on him. 

But it‚Äôs a free country, man can drink where he pleases. So I just watched, and drank.

He's got a conman‚Äôs charm and soon enough, he‚Äôs made a couple of friends who are more than happy to buy a few rounds. 

I‚Äôve seen this before. Soon enough Elroy is going to find something to take offence to, and one of these College boys is going to be missing teeth. 

Good sense told me to stay out of it. But something about his smirking, coyote look, got my dander up. 

He steps backward into one of his new friends, I can‚Äôt hear the conversation, but I can see what‚Äôs going to happen. 

As the engineer apologizes, I down my drink. As Elroy starts to shout, I‚Äôm out of my chair. 

I take out my wallet, as Elroy starts to get into the man‚Äôs face. 

I‚Äôve paid for my beer when the engineer is shoved, it catches the five foot seven man totally off guard. He hits the ground on his ass. 

Elroy, he‚Äôs about my size, greasy curled hair, and plenty of yard-bird muscle. 

Well, I inform him that if he intends on a fight that night, it sure as hell isn‚Äôt going to be with the man pissing himself on the floor. 

The situation got tense, but guys like him aren‚Äôt looking for a square fight. He makes some threats and leaves. 

Came at me from an alley on the walk home though. 

I got my bearings quick enough, and it turned into a typical drunken fight. Nothing I hadn‚Äôt been through a dozen times. 

Never been stabbed before though, it was a real hollow, deep pain in my bicep. 

I don‚Äôt remember much in specific, but that knife found it‚Äôs way into it‚Äôs owner‚Äôs chest. 

Elroy hit the ground, a cheap, pawn shop switchblade deep in his ribs. Still alive, but on his way out. 

I could have called the law, hell , could have called an ambulance, but I didn‚Äôt. I wasn‚Äôt going to roll the dice on the rest of my life because of Elroy fucking Kinston. 

So I finished the job, did the world a favor, and buried that son-of-a-bitch ten feet deep where no one would ever find him. ‚Äú

‚ÄúSo you killed a guy?‚Äù I say, shocked.

‚ÄúThought I did. 

The very next day, Elroy was driving that rat-rod of his, down main street, not a mark on him. ‚Äú Chuck looks to me as he talks, trying to judge if I‚Äôm believing him or not, ‚Äú After that, things started happening. It started with fires, accidents, floods. But eventually, turned to folks talking about the kinds of things that belong in a midnight movie. 

No one knew how, or why, no one but me that is. 

I watched for a year as this place turned from unlucky, to god-damned cursed. ‚Äú Chuck pauses, he‚Äôs actually shaking, ‚Äú You think I‚Äôm full of shit don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

‚Äú Real answer? Undecided. 

What do you mean, cursed?‚Äù

‚ÄúEvery town has stories, a couple of odd-ducks who say they‚Äôve seen ghosts, or some preacher who swears he‚Äôs been face to face with old scratch. 

During that year, damn near everyone in Harrington had a story other folks wouldn‚Äôt believe. It was like we were a magnet for all of the darkest things in the world. 

Something had to be done. 

I got 6 of my closest friends and told them everything I knew. One took off upstate, the other 5 and I decided to try our hand at stopping things. 

We did our best to figure out what happened, but back then there was no internet, the world was a much smaller place. All we could find were rumors, tall tales, and wild speculation. And even then, pickings were thin.‚Äù Chuck stops for a second while he drinks more of his ‚Äòcoffee‚Äô.

‚ÄúSlow down with that. 

What did you guys do?‚Äù I say, whether I believe him or not, I‚Äôm interested.

‚ÄúNathan, the sheriff‚Äôs deputy figured he‚Äôd go at him head on. Ski mask, and scattergun in the middle of the night. 

When they found his body, they figured it was a bear.

We knew this problem needed some kind of, what‚Äôs the word?‚Äù  Chuck asks. 

‚ÄúEsoteric?‚Äù I guess. 

‚ÄúSeems close enough.  Esoteric , solution. But we didn‚Äôt have one, we were 5 young men from the middle of nowhere. We had nothing more than grit and the stupidity of youth on our side. 

Another thing that was different back then was how easy it was to get your hands on explosives.  Folks just trusted each other more I guess. Either that or lunatics hadn‚Äôt started abusing the privilege.

So we figured if we couldn‚Äôt find anything, esoteric, we‚Äôd do the next best thing. 

We went in knowing we might not come out. And that was true for all but two of us.  

I saw things at that lunatic‚Äôs shack that still make me wonder if god  has an eye on his children any more. But Kyle and Quint, then gave themselves to turn that place into a crater. 

The man himself was my job. 

Face to face, there was a power about him, a dark fog that hung around Elroy. It made my blood run cold. 

He chased me through the sickly , dying trees, scattering downed branches and brush like it wasn‚Äôt even there. No man can move like he did. 

I lost him somewhere near the tree-line. But saw him again when I got to my truck, leaning against it with one hand. 

Tim and I, we we‚Äôre plan B, there was no plan C. 

In the dead of night, through  leaves, and branches, Tim made the shot. 

The  first barbed,  steel bolt pierced Elroy‚Äôs hand, sticking to the door of the truck.  The second did much of the same to his thigh. 

Elroy tore at his limbs like a trapped wolf, he ripped his hand clean off in about 6 seconds. 

The bundle of TNT I lobbed at his feet had a seven second fuse. 

There was nothing left of Elroy, his house, or my truck. 

We figured that was the end of things. 

Now, I‚Äôm not so sure. ‚Äú Chuck finishes his story, trying to read my reaction. 

‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm definitely not high enough for this. ‚Äú I say.

‚ÄúSo you think I‚Äôm full of shit?‚Äù Chuck accuses. 

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs say I don‚Äôt, for the sake of argument. What does that have to do with what's going on now?‚Äù I ask. 

‚ÄúTim was ran off the road. ‚Äú Chuck says, ‚Äú The man that did it said he had a message from Elroy. 

He says, he‚Äôll be seeing us soon.‚Äù

‚ÄúChuck, I don‚Äôt know if I believe all the paranormal stuff , but by the fact things have you like this, I know you are involved with some bad people. 

I‚Äôve got a record, man. You know this. 

 I can‚Äôt afford to get mixed up in some old-school blood feud going on so long it‚Äôs developed legends. ‚Äú My tone is a mix of shame and anger, ‚Äú And besides, you know me, I‚Äôm not a fighter. If this guy has some brother or friend trying to screw with you, plenty of folks around here would have your back. ‚Äú

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the problem kid, I‚Äôve seen how people in this town react when things start going sideways in a way they can‚Äôt understand. 

But I respect your decision, any way this hand plays out is going to get messy, and you don‚Äôt need any more of that in your life.

If you‚Äôre fixing to leave, I‚Äôve got 5k in cash to help you get the hell away from this place. No hard feelings. ‚Äú Chuck finishes the offer and his coffee at nearly the same time. 


The fact I didn‚Äôt take the money and run was one in a long list of stupid decisions I‚Äôve made in my life. But something inside me made me feel that I owed the old man. If he needed me to hold a baseball bat and try to look scary,  why not? 

So I found myself at Norm‚Äôs , drinking slowly and alone. Trying to make sense of the growing level of strange in my life. 

The answer I found at the bottom of a bottle was as follows:

My friend chuck, has likely been suffering from PTSD for a long time. He‚Äôs taken the event that caused it, mixed it up with a few memories from his time in the service ( I assume. ) and made it into some kind of paranormal event in his mind. 

That being said, scumbag families hold grudges, that goes double in isolated burgs like this. Decades mean nothing. 

Chuck needs help, and for all the dumb things I‚Äôve caught time for, if worst comes to worst, at least this will be for a good cause. 

Riding a good buzz and a moral high, I found myself walking home under the harsh arc lights of main street. 

It was quiet, a little under an hour before last call, the street was calm. It felt like I had the town to myself. 

As many times as I‚Äôve seen the inside of a jail cell, I‚Äôm not a tough guy. When me and the law come into conflict, violence isn‚Äôt the reason. Hell, even on the inside, I got by minding my own business and keeping the right friends. 

So , as I walk I start to think about how I‚Äôm going to go about convincing some inbred criminal to leave my friend alone. 

I‚Äôm on my third inebriated draft of an absolutely terrible scary speech when I hear it. 

It‚Äôs quiet at first, as if off in the distance. A rattling, grinding noise, an engine barely managing to run. 

I look back to see what piece of shit bike was living out it‚Äôs last seconds. Hoping i catch sight of it‚Äôs owner. 

I see nothing at first, then a couple blocks away, the streetlights on either side of the road burst. 

The roaring, decrepit engine suddenly seems much closer, the sound rising almost instantly. 

The next streetlights burst in a spray of broken glass and molten filament, keeping whatever dying conveyance I‚Äôm hearing out of my sight. 

One part of my brain is screaming at me to run, or hide. The other is telling me that I‚Äôm being an idiot and nearly having a heart attack over some faulty wiring that was likely last replaced well before I was born. 

So, for a moment, I stand, indecisive, transfixed. 

I catch a glimpse, for just a fraction of a second right before the next set of lights explode. 

I don‚Äôt see a bike, but I see a dozen or so silhouettes. People clad in black, walking nearly in unison. 

The sound starts to reach window rattling levels, the lights are destroying themselves quicker. Common sense finally takes hold. 

I bolt in the opposite direction as fast as my booze hindered legs will carry me. 

The engine‚Äôs roar brings to mind the scream of something massive, old, and evil. 

I skid to a stop, losing balance, and a decent amount of flesh from my palms as I scramble to get back to my feet. 

About two blocks away, the lights in front of me begin to burst. On either side, pitch black night begins to encroach.  The engine roar hits me in stereo now.  Loud enough to be painful. 

Panic and fear hit me hard enough to threaten consciousness. 

   I don‚Äôt think, I turn right down an alley, seeing some kind of refuge in the dim light from aging scones in the wall. 

As I do, the noise of the engine suddenly cuts off. My ears are ringing, sweat pours from me, drenching my shirt. I try the rusted handles of disused doors to no avail. 

I scream for help, someone has to hear me. 

But then again, someone has to have heard the earth-shaking sound of the engine. Yet no one seems to be investigating. 

No fire escapes, nothing that could be used as a weapon. I feel trapped, and for some reason, small. 

My back is to the wall, and while I can‚Äôt see a damn thing, I can hear footsteps, slow, purposeful footsteps. 

The last set of lights destroy themselves, plunging me into pure darkness. 

Silence, a ringing lack of volume, pregnant with the potential of violence and evil. 

A hiss,  my eyes burn with a sudden brightness, tearing up. It takes me a few seconds to make sense of what, or rather, who, I‚Äôm seeing.

She‚Äôs  a few inches taller than me, her bald head is covered in overlapping layers of scars. Some look purposeful, others like the reminders of brutal fights. 

She holds a road flare, head cocked, one eye slightly clouded and askew. 

The orange light makes the tattered, rusted biker‚Äôs leathers she wears look like the hide of some hell-spawned creature. 

‚ÄúYou Chuck‚Äôs friend?‚Äù she says, her voice is calm, like we just ran into each other at the coffee shop. 

I think about lying, but I figure she wouldn‚Äôt be asking if she didn‚Äôt already know. 

‚ÄúYeah, I am. ‚Äú I try to sound confident, I could spend a page describing how much I failed. 

‚Äú Good‚Äù The woman says, walking toward me, ‚ÄúMy name‚Äôs River, but you can call me, sir. ‚Äú 

She stands inches from me, I can feel the heat of the flare. 

‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù I ask. 

Before I realize it the woman has me by the throat, nails filed to wicked points dig into my neck hard enough to draw blood. I try to get away, she‚Äôs tall, but rail thin. Somehow though, her grip is immovable. 

She pokes my chest with the flare, just a brief fraction of a second of contact, but the pain is bad enough I drench her arm in vomit. 

Disgusted she easily throws me into the opposite wall. I hear the action of a switchblade and see her holding a wicked, serrated blade as she stalks toward my prone form. 

‚ÄúYou fucking deaf, or stupid?‚Äù she demands, ‚Äú Try that again.‚Äù

I pat out the smoldering fabric of my shirt, river wipes her sleeve on my head, studs and chains tearing out chunks of hair. 

‚ÄúWhat did you want, sir?‚Äù I say, trying to stand, every muscle screaming in pain. 

‚ÄúThere you go. 

What I want, is for you to get a message to Chuck. 

Elroy is giving him 7 days to get his shit in order. Then things get interesting. ‚Äú  River shows disgust when she talks about Chuck. 

Fighter or not, I decide to swing for the fences and run for the hills. My fist isn‚Äôt even half way cocked backward before River casually has the knife a quarter inch from my eye. 

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt. ‚Äú She says, bluntly, ‚Äú See, I‚Äôm a real forgiving type. Being nice, it‚Äôs just in my nature. 

But, the boss? He doesn‚Äôt really, let things go. ‚Äú 

As she talks, she moves the knife upward, drawing my gaze to the night sky. 

As the flare goes out, in the gloom, and scant starlight, I see it. 

It‚Äôs barely visible, an ethereal, suggestion of a massive, twisted human form. A wicked thing, floating above the assembled, leather clad people like an evil miasma. 

I can‚Äôt see eyes, I‚Äôm not even sure I can see the thing itself, but I can feel it looking at me. 

  I can‚Äôt do anything but shut my eyes against the sanity straining horror in front of me. I expect my throat to be cut, or my heart to be pierced at any second. 

But the death blow never comes. When I finally muster the courage to open my eyes, I‚Äôm alone. The street is lit, and if it wasn‚Äôt for the fact I‚Äôve been beaten and burned to hell, I might think it was all just some kind of hallucination. 

But the blistered, weeping wound in my chest isn‚Äôt a hallucination. And I know, neither was that thing that was herding River and her friends. 

I feel like a spec of dust caught up in a tornado. And when I finally make it to Chuck‚Äôs house, body screaming for rest and medical attention, the old man is waiting as if expecting me. 

‚Äú We‚Äôve got a week.‚Äù I say grimly. 

‚ÄúWe drinking ourselves to death, or trying to figure out the mysteries of the universe in a week?‚Äù Chuck asks. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the boss. ‚Äú I say,  figuring both options will amount to the same in the end.

1fxmdk9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepsMcPasta/comments/1fxmdk9/hardware_part_1/,Hardware: Part 1,"If you asked me what I‚Äôd be doing with my life when I was in high school, probably dead last on the list would be working at a hardware store in an overgrown Texas town that decided to vainly call itself a city a few decades back. 

But, plans change, life happens and things fall through. 

My boss is a man named Charles ‚Äò Chuck‚Äô Rogers. The name fits the man, he‚Äôs never told me his exact age but he‚Äôs well past sixty. 

He stands six foot three, and old man or not, he‚Äôs built like a boxer. 

Me, I‚Äôm half his age, half his size, and rocking a decent amount of body art that can‚Äôt really be hidden by  the red plaid shirt that serves as an informal uniform. 

We share sweet fuck-all in common, but for the past decade or so, he‚Äôs been the best boss I‚Äôve ever had. Gave me a shot when he had every reason not to, forgave a few mistakes he shouldn‚Äôt have, and, all in all, is a great guy. 

‚ÄúDerek, where in the hell is your white wash?‚Äù Eamon Simmons, farmer-at-large says. 

‚ÄúEamon, I have it on good authority that it‚Äôs been in the same place since before I was born. ‚Äú I reply, ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs the kids?‚Äù 

The rotund, red faced man walks over, a grin on his face. 

‚ÄúTrying their best, Steve‚Äôs working at an auction , Jess is in college. Damned if I understand what she‚Äôs taking but she enjoys it. 

Me, just ankle deep in cow shit from dawn to dusk. ‚Äú Eamon complains. 

‚ÄúDirty boots clean money. That‚Äôll be $5.80.‚Äù I say, working the old, barely-electronic register. 

‚ÄúHighway god-damned robbery. ‚Äú Eamon says in a friendly enough tone, producing his cash. 

‚ÄúI see that truck of yours, you can afford it.‚Äù I reply with a smirk. 

And that basic type of interaction, is my nine to five. I‚Äôm originally from Michigan, took me a bit to understand what Texas friendly is, but once I got the hang of it, folks saw past the tattoos, piercings and checkered past. 

Not that I haven‚Äôt ran into some more, archetypal Texans, but by and large, people where I am are easy going. 

When shit hits the fan , the things you remember are random. For some reason it always sticks out to me that all of this started on a Monday. 

Chuck had just gotten back from vacation and entered the store with an approving look. 

‚Äú Looks like you didn‚Äôt manage to burn the joint down, good job kid. ‚Äú He says, short grey hair barely visible under a simple brown baseball cap.

‚ÄúThought about it when Mrs. Olsen ordered two dozen garden gnomes, but managed to fight the urge. 

How was trip south?‚Äù I reply cracking open an energy drink. 

‚ÄúBueno. How many times I have to tell you, that shit is going to kill you?‚Äù Chuck asks, shaking his head. 

‚ÄúThe definition of insanity is trying the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. ‚Äú is my answer. 

I‚Äôll spare you the details of the day but as it wrapped up both of us were worn out as hell. 

‚ÄúFeel like downing a few at Norm‚Äôs? ‚Äú chuck asks as he turns an open/closed sign that looks exactly as one would expect. 

 ‚ÄúMight-could.‚Äù I say, chuckling a bit to myself at some of the dialect that has crept into my speech, ‚Äú As long as my boss doesn‚Äôt call me in tomorrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúSon, I have a sneaking suspicion the water heater is going to blow and we‚Äôre sadly going to have to close up for a couple days. This old-hand needs a little vacation from his vacation. ‚Äú Chuck jokes as we leave the store. 

Norm‚Äôs is an odd kind of place. In reality it‚Äôs your generic small town bar. Decent amount of personality, nothing too exciting going on but it‚Äôs trying to go for a chain restaurant kind of look.  

Chuck and I  sit down, and before we manage to strike up a conversation, a pitcher of bud is sitting on the table in front of us. 

‚ÄúThanks Ken!‚Äù I shout to the combination barhand/bouncer. His forearms are covered in scars from his day job at a scrapyard. 

Behind the bar are two women, Casey, a farm-girl around my age working her way through a second run at college . And Alice, probably the only person in this city I can talk to about body art. 

Late forties, ex-cop, and known to lend Ken a hand during the odd dust-up that happens. 

It was nearing ten, that crucial moment in a night of drinking where one needs to decide whether it‚Äôs an early pass-out or a late night. 

‚ÄúI forgot to tell you, did you hear what happened to Leo‚Äôs kid?‚Äù  I question. 

‚ÄúNo, he okay?‚Äù Chuck asks. 

I‚Äôm no where near drunk, but I swear I‚Äôve never seen Chuck get beyond tipsy. He‚Äôs spent half the night catching up and downing drinks with every other old coot in the city and seems just fine. 

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs alive, but man, it was the damndest thing. 

Kid was out on a deer hunt, long-guns , obviously. 

Blows a hand clean off. Nothing Doc Miller could do for it.  

Still up in a hospital near Dallas. It‚Äôs a shame, kid was only 18. ‚Äú  I don‚Äôt know why I chose such a morbid topic, but booze doesn‚Äôt tend to do positive things for the mind. 

Chuck looks stoic, maybe even a bit pissed off. 

‚ÄúWhich hand?‚Äù he asks, deadpan. 

‚ÄúRight. Listen , if I seemed like I was making fun of the kid, I wasn‚Äôt. ‚Äú I reply, trying to smooth over whatever mistake I made. 

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt say anything wrong. ‚Äú Chuck offers as an explanation, but he still has that worried, miserable tone. 

If there is one thing I‚Äôve learned about Chuck , it‚Äôs that when he wants to stop a conversation, it‚Äôs best to listen. 

As weird as it was, after a couple of weeks, I‚Äôd forgotten all about the cloud that passed over chuck that night. Chalking it up to one too many, and a bad choice of topic. 

But one Wednesday in mid September , Chuck didn‚Äôt show up to open the store. Nothing I couldn‚Äôt handle, of course, but not so much as a call. 

It was 11 am and I was nearly drowning in customers. As much as I owe Chuck, I was about thirty minutes away from a pissed off phone call when he came walking in the door. 

‚ÄúHey boss, need you to‚Ä¶‚Äù I start, trying to get Chuck‚Äôs attention. 

He has his hat pulled low, and walks straight by me, closing the ancient door to his office with a little too much gusto. 

It‚Äôs early afternoon by the time I get a second to go back and talk to Chuck. 

The first smell that hits me is sweat, the kind of vinegar  reek that comes only from fear. The second is booze. 

‚ÄúWhat the hell? You‚Äôre day drinking?‚Äù I say, more confused than angry. 

The laminate desk Chuck sits behind is worn with age, it‚Äôs chrome legs, dull and clouded. 

‚ÄúBig Tim got in a car wreck last night. ‚Äú Chuck says, not turning my way. 

‚ÄúYeah, I heard. Is that what has you walking around with a coffee that smells like paint thinner?

He‚Äôs going to be fine, totaled that Firebird of his, but he‚Äôs back home already. ‚Äú I explain. 

‚ÄúI know, went to go see him.‚Äù Chuck says, taking a long swallow of what I‚Äôm guessing is a cup of ¬º coffee and ¬æ booze. 

‚ÄúAt what point do I get let in on the joke here? You're fucking scaring me with this thousand yard stare shit. ‚Äú  Something about the way this granite statue of a man is acting sets the hairs on the back of my neck on end. 

‚ÄúLock the door kid, we need to talk.‚Äù Chuck says , finally looking at me. 

He hasn‚Äôt slept, and there‚Äôs a look of horror in his eyes, no amount of poker-face can hide. 

I do as he asks, and pull up an old, green office chair to his desk. 

‚ÄúYou ever experienced something you can‚Äôt explain? ‚Äú He asks, point blank, almost, wistfully. 

‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôve ever seen bigfoot or anything, but I‚Äôm sure there is some weird shit out there. ‚Äú is my answer. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not talking about something ,off. 

I‚Äôm talking the kind of thing that has you wondering if it ever really happened. ‚Äú Chuck‚Äôs tone is depressed and hopeful all at the same time. 

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt say that I have, you?‚Äù I lead. 

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve got a reefer in your coat, it‚Äôd probably help my cause for you to smoke it. ‚Äú Chuck begins, with a chuckle, ‚Äú What I‚Äôve got to say isn‚Äôt very high on the believability scale. 

Back in my twenties, I was a different man. Bit of a wanderer, bit of a roughneck, but something kept brining me back here. 

Of course, the town was different then, smaller, closer. It was ‚Äô72 and folks around here were breathing a sigh of relief that the swinging sixties had come to an end. 

The town was doing well, except for one thing. Well, one person really. 

Elroy Kinston. 

A town bully, not something that‚Äôs going to happen nowadays. Even out here, you‚Äôve got cameras on you every second of the day. 

But back then, in a little burg like this, one man could cause a lot of misery. 

He was the kind of ornery, vindictive prick who knows how the law works. 

He was ten years or so older than myself, almost a boogeyman growing up.  

He said he was a biker, but he was just an asshole with a crotch-rocket. Never saw the man with a friend let alone a gang. 

Of course the law would get him for things here and there, a couple months for a fight that got out of hand, weekend jail for pushing drugs, but nothing major. 

When it came to real time, Elroy had the devil‚Äôs luck. 

By ‚Äô70 or so, he‚Äôd beaten a manslaughter wrap, and at that point, folks decided to just give the man his space. Better to be cleaning up broken windows, or nursing a black eye than six feet under. 

One night, I found myself at Norm‚Äôs, by my lonesome and looking for some female companionship. 

The night went on and nothing of the sort came my way. 

The bar was full of mining boys, engineers from the quarry. Good guys, but we‚Äôre talking college boys, not miners. Soft men. 

Elroy walked in, and I could smell the bad intentions on him. 

But it‚Äôs a free country, man can drink where he pleases. So I just watched, and drank.

He's got a conman‚Äôs charm and soon enough, he‚Äôs made a couple of friends who are more than happy to buy a few rounds. 

I‚Äôve seen this before. Soon enough Elroy is going to find something to take offence to, and one of these College boys is going to be missing teeth. 

Good sense told me to stay out of it. But something about his smirking, coyote look, got my dander up. 

He steps backward into one of his new friends, I can‚Äôt hear the conversation, but I can see what‚Äôs going to happen. 

As the engineer apologizes, I down my drink. As Elroy starts to shout, I‚Äôm out of my chair. 

I take out my wallet, as Elroy starts to get into the man‚Äôs face. 

I‚Äôve paid for my beer when the engineer is shoved, it catches the five foot seven man totally off guard. He hits the ground on his ass. 

Elroy, he‚Äôs about my size, greasy curled hair, and plenty of yard-bird muscle. 

Well, I inform him that if he intends on a fight that night, it sure as hell isn‚Äôt going to be with the man pissing himself on the floor. 

The situation got tense, but guys like him aren‚Äôt looking for a square fight. He makes some threats and leaves. 

Came at me from an alley on the walk home though. 

I got my bearings quick enough, and it turned into a typical drunken fight. Nothing I hadn‚Äôt been through a dozen times. 

Never been stabbed before though, it was a real hollow, deep pain in my bicep. 

I don‚Äôt remember much in specific, but that knife found it‚Äôs way into it‚Äôs owner‚Äôs chest. 

Elroy hit the ground, a cheap, pawn shop switchblade deep in his ribs. Still alive, but on his way out. 

I could have called the law, hell , could have called an ambulance, but I didn‚Äôt. I wasn‚Äôt going to roll the dice on the rest of my life because of Elroy fucking Kinston. 

So I finished the job, did the world a favor, and buried that son-of-a-bitch ten feet deep where no one would ever find him. ‚Äú

‚ÄúSo you killed a guy?‚Äù I say, shocked.

‚ÄúThought I did. 

The very next day, Elroy was driving that rat-rod of his, down main street, not a mark on him. ‚Äú Chuck looks to me as he talks, trying to judge if I‚Äôm believing him or not, ‚Äú After that, things started happening. It started with fires, accidents, floods. But eventually, turned to folks talking about the kinds of things that belong in a midnight movie. 

No one knew how, or why, no one but me that is. 

I watched for a year as this place turned from unlucky, to god-damned cursed. ‚Äú Chuck pauses, he‚Äôs actually shaking, ‚Äú You think I‚Äôm full of shit don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

‚Äú Real answer? Undecided. 

What do you mean, cursed?‚Äù

‚ÄúEvery town has stories, a couple of odd-ducks who say they‚Äôve seen ghosts, or some preacher who swears he‚Äôs been face to face with old scratch. 

During that year, damn near everyone in Harrington had a story other folks wouldn‚Äôt believe. It was like we were a magnet for all of the darkest things in the world. 

Something had to be done. 

I got 6 of my closest friends and told them everything I knew. One took off upstate, the other 5 and I decided to try our hand at stopping things. 

We did our best to figure out what happened, but back then there was no internet, the world was a much smaller place. All we could find were rumors, tall tales, and wild speculation. And even then, pickings were thin.‚Äù Chuck stops for a second while he drinks more of his ‚Äòcoffee‚Äô.

‚ÄúSlow down with that. 

What did you guys do?‚Äù I say, whether I believe him or not, I‚Äôm interested.

‚ÄúNathan, the sheriff‚Äôs deputy figured he‚Äôd go at him head on. Ski mask, and scattergun in the middle of the night. 

When they found his body, they figured it was a bear.

We knew this problem needed some kind of, what‚Äôs the word?‚Äù  Chuck asks. 

‚ÄúEsoteric?‚Äù I guess. 

‚ÄúSeems close enough.  Esoteric , solution. But we didn‚Äôt have one, we were 5 young men from the middle of nowhere. We had nothing more than grit and the stupidity of youth on our side. 

Another thing that was different back then was how easy it was to get your hands on explosives.  Folks just trusted each other more I guess. Either that or lunatics hadn‚Äôt started abusing the privilege.

So we figured if we couldn‚Äôt find anything, esoteric, we‚Äôd do the next best thing. 

We went in knowing we might not come out. And that was true for all but two of us.  

I saw things at that lunatic‚Äôs shack that still make me wonder if god  has an eye on his children any more. But Kyle and Quint, then gave themselves to turn that place into a crater. 

The man himself was my job. 

Face to face, there was a power about him, a dark fog that hung around Elroy. It made my blood run cold. 

He chased me through the sickly , dying trees, scattering downed branches and brush like it wasn‚Äôt even there. No man can move like he did. 

I lost him somewhere near the tree-line. But saw him again when I got to my truck, leaning against it with one hand. 

Tim and I, we we‚Äôre plan B, there was no plan C. 

In the dead of night, through  leaves, and branches, Tim made the shot. 

The  first barbed,  steel bolt pierced Elroy‚Äôs hand, sticking to the door of the truck.  The second did much of the same to his thigh. 

Elroy tore at his limbs like a trapped wolf, he ripped his hand clean off in about 6 seconds. 

The bundle of TNT I lobbed at his feet had a seven second fuse. 

There was nothing left of Elroy, his house, or my truck. 

We figured that was the end of things. 

Now, I‚Äôm not so sure. ‚Äú Chuck finishes his story, trying to read my reaction. 

‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm definitely not high enough for this. ‚Äú I say.

‚ÄúSo you think I‚Äôm full of shit?‚Äù Chuck accuses. 

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs say I don‚Äôt, for the sake of argument. What does that have to do with what's going on now?‚Äù I ask. 

‚ÄúTim was ran off the road. ‚Äú Chuck says, ‚Äú The man that did it said he had a message from Elroy. 

He says, he‚Äôll be seeing us soon.‚Äù

‚ÄúChuck, I don‚Äôt know if I believe all the paranormal stuff , but by the fact things have you like this, I know you are involved with some bad people. 

I‚Äôve got a record, man. You know this. 

 I can‚Äôt afford to get mixed up in some old-school blood feud going on so long it‚Äôs developed legends. ‚Äú My tone is a mix of shame and anger, ‚Äú And besides, you know me, I‚Äôm not a fighter. If this guy has some brother or friend trying to screw with you, plenty of folks around here would have your back. ‚Äú

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the problem kid, I‚Äôve seen how people in this town react when things start going sideways in a way they can‚Äôt understand. 

But I respect your decision, any way this hand plays out is going to get messy, and you don‚Äôt need any more of that in your life.

If you‚Äôre fixing to leave, I‚Äôve got 5k in cash to help you get the hell away from this place. No hard feelings. ‚Äú Chuck finishes the offer and his coffee at nearly the same time. 


The fact I didn‚Äôt take the money and run was one in a long list of stupid decisions I‚Äôve made in my life. But something inside me made me feel that I owed the old man. If he needed me to hold a baseball bat and try to look scary,  why not? 

So I found myself at Norm‚Äôs , drinking slowly and alone. Trying to make sense of the growing level of strange in my life. 

The answer I found at the bottom of a bottle was as follows:

My friend chuck, has likely been suffering from PTSD for a long time. He‚Äôs taken the event that caused it, mixed it up with a few memories from his time in the service ( I assume. ) and made it into some kind of paranormal event in his mind. 

That being said, scumbag families hold grudges, that goes double in isolated burgs like this. Decades mean nothing. 

Chuck needs help, and for all the dumb things I‚Äôve caught time for, if worst comes to worst, at least this will be for a good cause. 

Riding a good buzz and a moral high, I found myself walking home under the harsh arc lights of main street. 

It was quiet, a little under an hour before last call, the street was calm. It felt like I had the town to myself. 

As many times as I‚Äôve seen the inside of a jail cell, I‚Äôm not a tough guy. When me and the law come into conflict, violence isn‚Äôt the reason. Hell, even on the inside, I got by minding my own business and keeping the right friends. 

So , as I walk I start to think about how I‚Äôm going to go about convincing some inbred criminal to leave my friend alone. 

I‚Äôm on my third inebriated draft of an absolutely terrible scary speech when I hear it. 

It‚Äôs quiet at first, as if off in the distance. A rattling, grinding noise, an engine barely managing to run. 

I look back to see what piece of shit bike was living out it‚Äôs last seconds. Hoping i catch sight of it‚Äôs owner. 

I see nothing at first, then a couple blocks away, the streetlights on either side of the road burst. 

The roaring, decrepit engine suddenly seems much closer, the sound rising almost instantly. 

The next streetlights burst in a spray of broken glass and molten filament, keeping whatever dying conveyance I‚Äôm hearing out of my sight. 

One part of my brain is screaming at me to run, or hide. The other is telling me that I‚Äôm being an idiot and nearly having a heart attack over some faulty wiring that was likely last replaced well before I was born. 

So, for a moment, I stand, indecisive, transfixed. 

I catch a glimpse, for just a fraction of a second right before the next set of lights explode. 

I don‚Äôt see a bike, but I see a dozen or so silhouettes. People clad in black, walking nearly in unison. 

The sound starts to reach window rattling levels, the lights are destroying themselves quicker. Common sense finally takes hold. 

I bolt in the opposite direction as fast as my booze hindered legs will carry me. 

The engine‚Äôs roar brings to mind the scream of something massive, old, and evil. 

I skid to a stop, losing balance, and a decent amount of flesh from my palms as I scramble to get back to my feet. 

About two blocks away, the lights in front of me begin to burst. On either side, pitch black night begins to encroach.  The engine roar hits me in stereo now.  Loud enough to be painful. 

Panic and fear hit me hard enough to threaten consciousness. 

   I don‚Äôt think, I turn right down an alley, seeing some kind of refuge in the dim light from aging scones in the wall. 

As I do, the noise of the engine suddenly cuts off. My ears are ringing, sweat pours from me, drenching my shirt. I try the rusted handles of disused doors to no avail. 

I scream for help, someone has to hear me. 

But then again, someone has to have heard the earth-shaking sound of the engine. Yet no one seems to be investigating. 

No fire escapes, nothing that could be used as a weapon. I feel trapped, and for some reason, small. 

My back is to the wall, and while I can‚Äôt see a damn thing, I can hear footsteps, slow, purposeful footsteps. 

The last set of lights destroy themselves, plunging me into pure darkness. 

Silence, a ringing lack of volume, pregnant with the potential of violence and evil. 

A hiss,  my eyes burn with a sudden brightness, tearing up. It takes me a few seconds to make sense of what, or rather, who, I‚Äôm seeing.

She‚Äôs  a few inches taller than me, her bald head is covered in overlapping layers of scars. Some look purposeful, others like the reminders of brutal fights. 

She holds a road flare, head cocked, one eye slightly clouded and askew. 

The orange light makes the tattered, rusted biker‚Äôs leathers she wears look like the hide of some hell-spawned creature. 

‚ÄúYou Chuck‚Äôs friend?‚Äù she says, her voice is calm, like we just ran into each other at the coffee shop. 

I think about lying, but I figure she wouldn‚Äôt be asking if she didn‚Äôt already know. 

‚ÄúYeah, I am. ‚Äú I try to sound confident, I could spend a page describing how much I failed. 

‚Äú Good‚Äù The woman says, walking toward me, ‚ÄúMy name‚Äôs River, but you can call me, sir. ‚Äú 

She stands inches from me, I can feel the heat of the flare. 

‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù I ask. 

Before I realize it the woman has me by the throat, nails filed to wicked points dig into my neck hard enough to draw blood. I try to get away, she‚Äôs tall, but rail thin. Somehow though, her grip is immovable. 

She pokes my chest with the flare, just a brief fraction of a second of contact, but the pain is bad enough I drench her arm in vomit. 

Disgusted she easily throws me into the opposite wall. I hear the action of a switchblade and see her holding a wicked, serrated blade as she stalks toward my prone form. 

‚ÄúYou fucking deaf, or stupid?‚Äù she demands, ‚Äú Try that again.‚Äù

I pat out the smoldering fabric of my shirt, river wipes her sleeve on my head, studs and chains tearing out chunks of hair. 

‚ÄúWhat did you want, sir?‚Äù I say, trying to stand, every muscle screaming in pain. 

‚ÄúThere you go. 

What I want, is for you to get a message to Chuck. 

Elroy is giving him 7 days to get his shit in order. Then things get interesting. ‚Äú  River shows disgust when she talks about Chuck. 

Fighter or not, I decide to swing for the fences and run for the hills. My fist isn‚Äôt even half way cocked backward before River casually has the knife a quarter inch from my eye. 

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt. ‚Äú She says, bluntly, ‚Äú See, I‚Äôm a real forgiving type. Being nice, it‚Äôs just in my nature. 

But, the boss? He doesn‚Äôt really, let things go. ‚Äú 

As she talks, she moves the knife upward, drawing my gaze to the night sky. 

As the flare goes out, in the gloom, and scant starlight, I see it. 

It‚Äôs barely visible, an ethereal, suggestion of a massive, twisted human form. A wicked thing, floating above the assembled, leather clad people like an evil miasma. 

I can‚Äôt see eyes, I‚Äôm not even sure I can see the thing itself, but I can feel it looking at me. 

  I can‚Äôt do anything but shut my eyes against the sanity straining horror in front of me. I expect my throat to be cut, or my heart to be pierced at any second. 

But the death blow never comes. When I finally muster the courage to open my eyes, I‚Äôm alone. The street is lit, and if it wasn‚Äôt for the fact I‚Äôve been beaten and burned to hell, I might think it was all just some kind of hallucination. 

But the blistered, weeping wound in my chest isn‚Äôt a hallucination. And I know, neither was that thing that was herding River and her friends. 

I feel like a spec of dust caught up in a tornado. And when I finally make it to Chuck‚Äôs house, body screaming for rest and medical attention, the old man is waiting as if expecting me. 

‚Äú We‚Äôve got a week.‚Äù I say grimly. 

‚ÄúWe drinking ourselves to death, or trying to figure out the mysteries of the universe in a week?‚Äù Chuck asks. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the boss. ‚Äú I say,  figuring both options will amount to the same in the end.

1fxmdfz,https://www.reddit.com/r/thesims/comments/1fxmdfz/dehydrated_sims/,Dehydrated Sims,"Maybe it‚Äôs just a pet peeve of mine because it ruins the immersion, but I hate how optional drinking is in sims 4. A sim could go their entire adult life without drinking a glass of water. It‚Äôs not even good water, they all want to go drink sink water from their bathrooms. There‚Äôs so many hoops and hurdles to go through just to do something simple like drinking something with your meal. And it‚Äôs just my opinion, but I feel like getting a drink should be its own selection on the fridge as well as making a group drink that can be served.  

 I have nearly all the game packs so I can fizz juice or make wine, but it‚Äôs such a pain to serve them during meals because sims will grab and consume them separately unless I cancel the actions and personally place it by their plate if they‚Äôre sitting down. And I have to do that for every sim that I want to drink with their meal, because there‚Äôs no way to make bigger quantities of drinks outside of a coffee/tea maker which is limited in the options that it gives out (I‚Äôm not trying to have a hot cup of pitch black with every meal in the middle of summer.) Even then, it‚Äôs not even a guarantee they‚Äôll drink with their meal especially if I have guests. If anything, I just wish there were easier ways to make drinks as a group at home that aren‚Äôt ‚Äúalcoholic.‚Äù I love that can make drink platters and pour servings of wine, but I‚Äôm not giving my children the sims equivalent of a cosmopolitan with every meal. 

It‚Äôs even worse if you use Simple Living from the Cottage Living pack because you don‚Äôt get the ‚Äúhave a quick meal‚Äù options. What if you want orange juice? The developers said that we should have thought about that before we began living in the country. Don‚Äôt even get me started on the milk, why even have cows and goats if we can‚Äôt drink milk straight out of the fridge, especially since we can have flavored milk. It‚Äôs not impossible, you just have to manually search through the inventory and place it in world. They don‚Äôt even get a glass, they just chug a gallon of raw milk straight out the container in five seconds then immediately run to the restroom. I‚Äôm just saying, there should at least be an option to make the pre existing drink options with simple living. If anything, we should have more drink option with cottage living.

But it‚Äôs not like I want a separate meter for hydration like mermaids, I just wish it were easier and more common sense for sims to drink something. I‚Äôm sure there are some sort of super cool mods that fixes this but I‚Äôm just a simple console player so I‚Äôll be drinking faucet water until they decide to make a new $40 pack centered making pitchers of lemonade or something.

My wife and I have been sexless (and much worse, pretty much adult intimacy-less, and emotionally disconnected) for our entire marriage of 23 years. It's a whole thing. 

Everything else is fine. Which is impossible to describe except to say we are the family in ""Leave it to Beaver"".  A well oiled machine, basically. Yeah it's a dichotomy.

20 years of therapy.

I tried to walk out once a few years back. She love bombed. I'm an idiot. 

About a month ago I said, I told her I wasn't going to have sex with her anymore. Which is hilarious because we don't anyway. I think it was my way of saying don't try to love bomb me the next time I walk out. Plus I feel played the ultra rare time I push it and she, days or weeks later, will say something like ""Well we should connect/have sex"". Gross. 

I've also told her I want more financial independence. We share 100% of our finances and it's always felt a bit controlling despite the fact I make about 40% more than her (she does well too though). She said ""You realize how that might land for me, right?"" It was her way of saying ""you're prepping to leave"". She's not wrong. 

AND YET.....

Today over coffee she's talking about retirement savings and what WE are going to do in retirement. She also does stuff like look for family vacations, and things we can spend on making our house nicer. 

WTF?

This is one of the things that make it hard for me to leave or even have the conversation.
 The fact that on top of ""I'm leaving for obvious reasons"", I have to deal with the ""WHAT!?!?!? WE ARE SO AWESOME!!!! HIW COJLD YOU DO THIS? YOURE TEAEING OUR FAMILY APART.""

Or should I tell this guy (26m) that I‚Äôm talking to that I‚Äôm upset and mad at him? ,"I (26F) met this guy (26M) back in July when he was visiting my city, and we had a quick 30-minute coffee date before he had to catch a train back to his state. Since then, we‚Äôve been talking every day, even though he‚Äôs in med school and super busy, which I really appreciate. We talked about him coming back to visit, and he has a cousin who lives just 10 minutes from me, so it made sense for him to visit both of us.

Fast forward, he came this weekend back to the city to visit me and his cousin. He took Friday off from his hospital work and asked if he could stay with me Thursday night, which I didn‚Äôt think was an issue. So he came Thursday night, the ticket cost him $120 and it was a 3 hour train ride, we grabbed pizza really quick and came back to my apartment and ate here. I genuinely do like him because he‚Äôs sweet, funny, and matches my energy every time. I had work the next day so we got into bed around 11:30 and made out for a bit, did a few other things, but didn‚Äôt have sex and then he left around lunch time Friday because he was going to go stay with his cousin and spend some time with him and I asked him again to let me know what the plans were for the rest of the weekend and he said he‚Äôd let me know. 

He ended up spending all day with his cousin Friday, texted me at 10pm if I wanted to go out to the bars with him and his cousin, which I declined because I was out with a friend and too tired to join. Saturday, I was expecting to spend the day with him based on our previous conversations, so I texted in the morning asking about plans, he said ‚Äúif I wanted to do something in the day it‚Äôd have to be something casual like drinks or food but his cousin might tag along but he‚Äôll ask his cousin when he wakes up‚Äù, so I said to just lmk. It ends up being 3:30pm and I end up going out for coffee with a friend because I didn‚Äôt want to be waiting all day waiting to hear on plans from that guy. He then texts me asking if I want to get dinner with his cousin at 4:15, keep in mind I literally just met up with my friend and we just got coffee, so I wasn‚Äôt going to bail on her because he decided to text me so last minute. I passed the offer up and said ‚ÄúI was hoping to have some 1x1 time w you before you left but if you‚Äôre busy it‚Äôs fine‚Äù and he replied with ‚ÄúHaha aw really? Here I thought u were sick of me‚Äù so I just ended up ignoring him because I was getting slightly angry. 

he texts me around 6pm saying ‚ÄúDo youuu wanna just go out later me and u? maybe we can do that?‚Äù since the original night plans were to go out with his cousin and him and my friend, so I replied back at 6:30pm saying ‚ÄúYes but you pick the time and place for wine & dessert‚Äù and then it was complete radio silence the rest of the night and he never let me know. I think I‚Äôm just really mad that he spent two full days with his cousin who lives 10 mins away from me when he could have spared an hour of the day to take me out on a proper date or anything and then I also felt like I was being strung along the entire weekend because he didn‚Äôt have solid plans on anything and I was constantly asking what the plans were. 

I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm overreacting because this guy is not my boyfriend, but I do really like him so I‚Äôm not sure if I should tell him I‚Äôm upset with the way he acted. He texted me sunday morning (today) saying he felt unwell and he missed his train. Like I can‚Äôt tell if he came here to visit me or his cousin? If he genuinely wanted to see me, he could‚Äôve spared an hour on Saturday or Friday to grab dinner with me or go for a quick walk, but he didn‚Äôt even ask to see me after he left Friday morning because asking if I wanted to go out at 10pm. 

TL;DR: I‚Äôve been talking to this guy every day since our coffee date in July, and he recently came to visit me and his cousin, who lives nearby. He stayed with me Thursday night, and we had a nice time, but after that, he spent most of Friday and Saturday with his cousin. He only texted me last-minute to make plans, and when I asked for some one-on-one time, he either included his cousin or didn‚Äôt follow through. By Saturday night, he completely stopped responding after I agreed to meet up. I‚Äôm frustrated because I feel like I was strung along all weekend, and he didn‚Äôt prioritize spending time with me, even though he traveled to see me.

Quite new to making my own espresso so please be gentle. Can someone explain how to dial in a nice dark roast because I just can not figure it out. Here is what I know:

Dark roasts are easier to expect flavor from so we go coarser. However, dark roasts are also more porous(?). At least they take up more space in the portafilter for the same amount of coffee (I dial in always 18g usually). So if they are more porous and I need to use a coarser grind because it's easier to extract flavour from them, the flow rate is very very high. In 20-25 seconds there is already so much coffee extracted that it is already a 1:3 ratio or something of the sort. Ideally for dark roasts we want to aim for a 1:1 ratio, right?

Now if I go finer to slow it down to get 1:1 in about 25ish seconds, the coffee tastes real bad. What am I doing wrong? What don't I get about dark roasts.

In comparison, I am reasonably adept now at dialing in a decent light roast and getting a 1:2 or 1:2.5 ratio in 25-30 seconds and it tastes super nice. ",1,1728236901.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

Along with risk mitigation strategies, capital raising and marketing services, we try to anticipate everything that could go wrong and how to handle it. 
How many people in this reddit have considered, ""What if it goes right?""
I started an internet business back in 1994 (I'm old) which was the first in what is now a multi billion $ industry. 
At that time, few even knew about the Internet, there was only a couple search engines and we were just trying to figure it out. 
I owned a small restaurant and noticed a couple things. The biggest was the fact that I really never knew how many people were going to dine and because of that there was significant waste. The other was my labor cost due to not knowing when customers were going to visit. 
I thought, wouldn't it be great to know the exact number of customers and what they were going to order?
That's how the first, to my knowledge, ""virtual restaurant"" was born. My limited knowledge of programming still allowed me to create (with help) a website which I sold and delivered food ordered over the net.
I was working with another individual who was like Microsoft's 6th, or something like that, employee and she was wonderful! So wonderful that if someone typed ""food"" into Yahoo's search engine, I would come up first.
Although I had not done any marketing, we went live and I had anticipated maybe a couple of orders.
Here's the point, that first night I went home with a real sense of accomplishment. The next morning I came into my office and switched the computer on to find that over $100K in orders were in que (spit the coffee all over). Two challenges emerged. One, the orders were from all over the world. Two, even if they were local, there was no way I was able to fill those orders. Additionally , everyone had obviously payed by credit card but they don't refund the fees when you refund the customer... Woops.
In retrospect, the other thing that I didn't recognize was that I had developed a ""shopping cart"" where there was none previously. It didn't even occur to me that the value may have been the shopping cart?
So two things to take away...
One is plan on things going right along with your other contingencies and realize that the value may not be where you think it is.
I am very hopeful that my and your new venture will take this experience into account.",1,1728236556.0,EntrepreneurRideAlong,0,1.0,False

Sorry but like, it is simply the easiest decision to accept a version of Jesus that is righteous, just, and merciful to ALL, instead of one with ‚Äúuncomfortable teachings‚Äù like that gay people live in sin and that a cup of coffee is grounds to separate you from your family for eternity. 

Like, they really spent our whole childhoods teaching us about Jesus whose love extends to all, for us to grow up and find that the Mormon rendition of Jesus doesn‚Äôt line up with that at all lmao",9,1728236429.0,exmormon,0,1.0,False

Coffee table, maybe a standard brown one?

1fxlyso,https://www.reddit.com/r/ASHWAGANDHA/comments/1fxlyso/recovery_story/,Recovery story,"I will try to keep it short...So last year in may 2023, someone adviced me to take ashvagandha for health benefits ...i was completely normal functioning being ...after taking ashvagandha first for few days i felt great but after a course of 2weeks my symptoms stqrting to develop first fatigue and body tired,then brain fog and ed and after that a strange pulsating type tingling sensation...i lost my muscle mass almost 40lbs within a month....

So now recovery journey...many things given me temporary respites like taking vitamin e(400mg)with vitamin c ...maginisium glycinate,creatine,vitamin d, L-tetramethyfolate,....but these all given me temporary respites....

at that time i was trying to cure symptoms by targeting my brain ...my sole focus was brain....but after 14months of no success ...i switched my technique to treat my gut...and i can say i am feeling no symptoms 1.5months straight ...but the problem is i am still dependent on this protocol... approx only within 2months i am having no symptoms of brain fog,ed at all...it looks success to me but lets see how long it stays like this....i will repost after 2 or 3months looks kind detoxification process in gut and neurotransmitter generation have a direct relationship...

So i went to doctor and tested for sibo...and result came back positive...after that he gave me a prescription for medicines.. so in mid of this august i started my antibiotics and  probiotics...i used to take 1pill after 3hours of antibiotics... after 15days my brain fog cleared up completely...i knew sibo is difficult to target and can return ....so after completion of antibiotics ,i start taking ayurvedic antimicrobials with vitamin E(400mg) and probiotic(1 hour after)[2times a day]....there are many antimicrobials anything that is acidic in nature  work great....some antimicrobial like Acv(apple cider vinegar too)...some ayurvedic antimicrobial which you can take ,Sarvakalp kawath,berberine,oil of oregano
....i adjusted my diet too, i noted down foods which were making me more foggy and i started avoiding them from my regimen....

also 2km running each day very necessary it work as a catalyst...

things which need to avoid during this Drugs,Alcohol,stress building endurance type heavyweight workouts,Sex,Masturbation,coffee,nicotine...etc

Today, I brewed a [5Sento TRIBUTO](https://5sentocoffee.com/producto/tributo-coffee/) coffee from producer Viviana Mart√≠nez. This honey-processed coffee, with 200 hours of cherry fermentation and 170 hours in mucilage, hails from Calarc√°, Quindio‚Äîa beautiful town in Colombia‚Äôs coffee region.

Using a V60, I aimed for the perfect balance in the cup: 13 grams of coffee to 200 milliliters of water at 93¬∞C, with a 40-second pre-infusion to ensure a homogeneous and clean extraction. The magic started immediately‚Äîthe fragrance of the freshly ground coffee alone was mesmerizing. Adding the water made the aromatics bloom into a symphony of lychee, lime, rose petals, and chocolate. The entire brew process took nearly 5 minutes, with each moment revealing new surprises, each better than the last.

However, the real magic came when I tasted it: notes of lychee, hops, rose apple, and grapefruit danced on my palate, creating a truly wonderful experience. The velvety mouthfeel and lingering aftertaste are clear indicators of why this coffee scores over 90 points.

1fxlmbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1fxlmbh/i_have_turned_down_2_nice_guys/,I have turned down 2 nice guys,"
I have turned down 2 nice guys and I don't know if it's trauma or I'm just overreacting.

The first guy and I met at a school event where I was invited as the speaker. Usually I won't accept friend reqs from people I don't know sa fb pero I remember seeing this guy sa school - he's actually a prof. We eventually started chatting and as I'm a fresh board passer, he would ask me for some help in creating different approach of solutions sa prob sets na cinocompile nya for his class. Our conversation is professional and mainly focused sa academics. Then, one day, he asked me out kasi gusto nya raw ako itreat for all the favors he asked pero I declined many times kasi bukal naman sa loob ko yung tulong ko and a genuine thank you is already enough for me plus mahiyain talaga ako e. Pero at the end, dahil ilang beses na nga nya akong niyayaya, pinagbigyan ko na. We had dinner, coffee, then more talk but this time it's more personal.

The last relationship I've been to is from 5 and half years (Apr 2019) ago pa. 18 na ako nun and I was given the permission to date na. I don't want to admit it pero I was so naive back then. I have nothing to compare since first time ko, pero I was plain stupid (and I won't make excuses) not to notice when he didn't ask me to be his gf and yet we were acting as if kami na. We do things like couple do - we date, we kiss and yes, we have sex too. He's my first in everything and it all happened so fast but I can still remember na I didn't really want the sex pero nadadala ako sa ""if you love me, you'll do this for me"", dammit! Then, I had this gay friend from 11th grade, tinanong nya ako if jowa ko ba itong si guy and I said yes, to my surprise kapag pala nagpapaalam sya sakin na matutulog na sya turns out na nasa bar sya nakikipaghook up sa iba at sa kaibigan pa ng gay friend ko. Also, his friends na kasama nya sa apartment told me everything na yun nga, marami syang nakakahook up sa bar, minsan di raw sya umuuwi ng weekends at naabutan pa nila na may kasama sya sa bunkbed, naked. So, I immediately ended everything and that's when I realized na ito yung reason bakit ayaw nyang pinagsasabi ko sa iba na sya yung jowa ko at ang totoo wala talaga kaming label. Pero bwiset, 2 weeks nya akong ginugulo at binibisita sa bahay, I couldn't tell my parents kasi he has a good relationship with them and I didn't want them to learn I broke their trust by giving myself to a wrong guy. 1 month syang tumatambay samin and humihingi ng sorry. This time, he asked me for another chance and told me that he'll change. Yep, we became exclusive! Pero during college he met someone else, hindi sya nagpaparamdam sakin so direct to the point ko syang tinanong thru text ""Sino sya?"" and that awful guy actually replied and ended things without proper closure.

Fast forward, I was sitting with this prof guy, he seems nice pero nung tinanong nya ako if pwede ba syang manligaw, I got scared and randomly felt the same pain from 5 and half years ago. I immediately turned him down.

Then, this second guy, we met at my cousin's wedding. I was a bridesmaid and he happened to be my escort. He also sent me a friend req after the wedding and he would casually ask about my day, what I'm up to, etc. Pero ako yung klase ng tao na hindi kaagad magrereply unless very urgent o super close kami ng tao. We met the second time nung fiesta sa brgy nila pinsan, we're able to talk and I find him very humorous. I'd say napapalapit ako sa kanya at nagrereply na ako at the same pace kapag nagchachat mga BFFs ko. Minsan nadaanan nya ako nung pareho kaming papasok ng work, so hinatid nya ako sa office pero hindi na nasundan since nakakaramdam nako sa kanya. I respond less sa chat and would avoid the route kung saan sya usually dumadaan. Then, a time came when he asked to talk in person, of course, I declined, reason busy ako sa new project namin. Hindi ko ineexpect na maghihintay sya sa labas ng office para makausap ako. We talked inside his car, and I was right, he said he likes me at gusto nyang manligaw. I got scared again and turned the guy down.

It was a hard time for me after the break up. Pero kasalanan ko din naman, masyado akong nagtiwala at nagmahal ng sobra. During college, I would steer away from straight guys and end up befriending gays. At isa sa kanila ang nakapagsabi sakin na time heals pero ilang panahon na yung lumipas, nandito pa rin yung sugat, nasasaktan pa rin ako. Madalas na o-OA-yan nako sa sarili ko, parang tangang inuunahan ang lahat - naiisip ko agad na masasaktan ako sa huli kaya bago pa man magsimula, tinatapos ko na.

1fxlm7n,https://www.reddit.com/r/PanicAttack/comments/1fxlm7n/my_first_panic_attack/,My first panic attack ,"
Today, I experienced my first panic attack, and it was really terrifying. It started with dizziness, and at first, I thought my blood pressure was low as usual. I decided to make myself a coffee to help. While I was waiting, my knees started to feel weak, and my vision became blurry. Then, I began to have trouble breathing, and it felt like I was being choked. That‚Äôs when I started thinking that I might be having a panic attack, even though I had never experienced one before.

I called my boyfriend, who was at his mom‚Äôs place nearby, because I felt I couldn‚Äôt stay at home‚ÄîI needed air. I went outside, hoping that walking around would help. When my boyfriend arrived, my hands, face, and feet went numb, and my eyes started twitching. I panicked even more because I didn‚Äôt know if this was normal. I was scared that it could be a heart attack or stroke, so we called a taxi and went to the ER.

At the hospital, the doctor confirmed that I had a severe panic attack. They gave me something to calm me down, and soon after, I felt better. That day, I had eaten a lot of cacao and dark chocolate, and I‚Äôm wondering if those foods could have triggered such intense anxiety.

Jess felt tense, for all her life, she had only one parental figure, and, even if she did have some curiosity about who it was, she never really cared about it enough to outright try to find it, that was until her best friends mom, who she had become far more intimate with in recent times, took it upon herself to try to discover, and dragged her to this front door.

The tension was too much for her to bear, and, really, why should she go after her? She never cared to reach out, this ‚ÄúCarmilla‚Äù woman probably didn‚Äôt care about her. So, as she started descending the stairs to go somewhere else, her girlfriend rang the doorbell.

She quickly hid underneath the porch, as the sounds of footsteps slowly got louder, until the door opened and she heard her girlfriend, Mary, ask a woman

‚ÄúHello! Good morning, does a woman called Carmilla live here?‚Äù

With clear tiredness in her voice, characteristic of someone who had just stopped sleeping, the woman answered:  
‚ÄúShe does, but she‚Äôs not here.‚Äù

With some resolution derived from the fact that she wasn‚Äôt in, she popped her head up like a mole from her hiding spot, slightly scaring the woman, who quite resembled like a softer version of Mary, but with white and blue hair rather then purple

And thus, with some remaining tension in her voice, she could only say:

‚ÄúH-hello‚Äù

‚ÄúHi, why are you after Carmilla?‚Äù ‚Äì The white haired woman asked.

‚ÄúBecause we believe she‚Äôs her mother‚Äù ‚Äì Mary answered, they were invading this woman‚Äôs privacy, after all, to know why they were there was the least they could do to the woman.

‚ÄúOh!‚Äù ‚Äì The woman expressed, shock being fairly visible on her face ‚Äì ‚ÄúShe never told me she had a daughter! Come in, I‚Äôll help you see her‚Äù

The woman got out of the middle of the door, allowing for Jess and Mary to enter, inside there was a fairly unimpressive, if comfortable, home, what really got Jess‚Äô attention were the pictures of a boy roughly her age, whom she assumed was her brother.

‚ÄúDo you have kids?‚Äù ‚Äì Jess asked, wanting to see if the woman who abandoned her was a proper mother to someone else.

‚ÄúYes, one with Carmilla and one with my ex‚Äù - She, helpfully answered.

‚ÄúTwo? I don‚Äôt see many pictures of the other‚Äù ‚Äì Jess noted.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because we haven‚Äôt had much time to take that many pictures, she was born only a few weeks ago.‚Äù ‚Äì The woman noted, with the happiness of motherhood in her voice.

‚ÄúOh, where are my manners, whats your name?‚Äù ‚Äì Mary said, having just noticing that she barged into a strangers home.

‚ÄúMy name is Laura, I‚Äôm Carmilla‚Äôs wife.‚Äù ‚Äì Laura revealed, not really minding the guests.

‚ÄúYou know, I‚Äôm a mother too, your daughter seems weirdly quiet for such a small kid‚Äù ‚Äì Mary stated, pulling from her own experience.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs with my darling, otherwise you wouldn‚Äôt be able to hear me!‚Äù ‚Äì Laura stated ‚Äì ‚ÄúPlease, sit down and have some coffee, it'll be a while until she arrives.""

I feel bad, but I‚Äôm only working part-time and I don‚Äôt want to dip into savings at all. Would I be a bad friend if I just paid for dinner?

For reference there is a shed outside of my window she must‚Äôve climbed to get up. I asked my brother for help and he opened the window and she just climbed in and hid in the corner.

1fxlim3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1fxlim3/hardware_part_1/,Hardware: Part 1,"If you asked me what I‚Äôd be doing with my life when I was in high school, probably dead last on the list would be working at a hardware store in an overgrown Texas town that decided to vainly call itself a city a few decades back. 

But, plans change, life happens and things fall through. 

My boss is a man named Charles ‚Äò Chuck‚Äô Rogers. The name fits the man, he‚Äôs never told me his exact age but he‚Äôs well past sixty. 

He stands six foot three, and old man or not, he‚Äôs built like a boxer. 

Me, I‚Äôm half his age, half his size, and rocking a decent amount of body art that can‚Äôt really be hidden by  the red plaid shirt that serves as an informal uniform. 

We share sweet fuck-all in common, but for the past decade or so, he‚Äôs been the best boss I‚Äôve ever had. Gave me a shot when he had every reason not to, forgave a few mistakes he shouldn‚Äôt have, and, all in all, is a great guy. 

‚ÄúDerek, where in the hell is your white wash?‚Äù Eamon Simmons, farmer-at-large says. 

‚ÄúEamon, I have it on good authority that it‚Äôs been in the same place since before I was born. ‚Äú I reply, ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs the kids?‚Äù 

The rotund, red faced man walks over, a grin on his face. 

‚ÄúTrying their best, Steve‚Äôs working at an auction , Jess is in college. Damned if I understand what she‚Äôs taking but she enjoys it. 

Me, just ankle deep in cow shit from dawn to dusk. ‚Äú Eamon complains. 

‚ÄúDirty boots clean money. That‚Äôll be $5.80.‚Äù I say, working the old, barely-electronic register. 

‚ÄúHighway god-damned robbery. ‚Äú Eamon says in a friendly enough tone, producing his cash. 

‚ÄúI see that truck of yours, you can afford it.‚Äù I reply with a smirk. 

And that basic type of interaction, is my nine to five. I‚Äôm originally from Michigan, took me a bit to understand what Texas friendly is, but once I got the hang of it, folks saw past the tattoos, piercings and checkered past. 

Not that I haven‚Äôt ran into some more, archetypal Texans, but by and large, people where I am are easy going. 

When shit hits the fan , the things you remember are random. For some reason it always sticks out to me that all of this started on a Monday. 

Chuck had just gotten back from vacation and entered the store with an approving look. 

‚Äú Looks like you didn‚Äôt manage to burn the joint down, good job kid. ‚Äú He says, short grey hair barely visible under a simple brown baseball cap.

‚ÄúThought about it when Mrs. Olsen ordered two dozen garden gnomes, but managed to fight the urge. 

How was trip south?‚Äù I reply cracking open an energy drink. 

‚ÄúBueno. How many times I have to tell you, that shit is going to kill you?‚Äù Chuck asks, shaking his head. 

‚ÄúThe definition of insanity is trying the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. ‚Äú is my answer. 

I‚Äôll spare you the details of the day but as it wrapped up both of us were worn out as hell. 

‚ÄúFeel like downing a few at Norm‚Äôs? ‚Äú chuck asks as he turns an open/closed sign that looks exactly as one would expect. 

 ‚ÄúMight-could.‚Äù I say, chuckling a bit to myself at some of the dialect that has crept into my speech, ‚Äú As long as my boss doesn‚Äôt call me in tomorrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúSon, I have a sneaking suspicion the water heater is going to blow and we‚Äôre sadly going to have to close up for a couple days. This old-hand needs a little vacation from his vacation. ‚Äú Chuck jokes as we leave the store. 

Norm‚Äôs is an odd kind of place. In reality it‚Äôs your generic small town bar. Decent amount of personality, nothing too exciting going on but it‚Äôs trying to go for a chain restaurant kind of look.  

Chuck and I  sit down, and before we manage to strike up a conversation, a pitcher of bud is sitting on the table in front of us. 

‚ÄúThanks Ken!‚Äù I shout to the combination barhand/bouncer. His forearms are covered in scars from his day job at a scrapyard. 

Behind the bar are two women, Casey, a farm-girl around my age working her way through a second run at college . And Alice, probably the only person in this city I can talk to about body art. 

Late forties, ex-cop, and known to lend Ken a hand during the odd dust-up that happens. 

It was nearing ten, that crucial moment in a night of drinking where one needs to decide whether it‚Äôs an early pass-out or a late night. 

‚ÄúI forgot to tell you, did you hear what happened to Leo‚Äôs kid?‚Äù  I question. 

‚ÄúNo, he okay?‚Äù Chuck asks. 

I‚Äôm no where near drunk, but I swear I‚Äôve never seen Chuck get beyond tipsy. He‚Äôs spent half the night catching up and downing drinks with every other old coot in the city and seems just fine. 

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs alive, but man, it was the damndest thing. 

Kid was out on a deer hunt, long-guns , obviously. 

Blows a hand clean off. Nothing Doc Miller could do for it.  

Still up in a hospital near Dallas. It‚Äôs a shame, kid was only 18. ‚Äú  I don‚Äôt know why I chose such a morbid topic, but booze doesn‚Äôt tend to do positive things for the mind. 

Chuck looks stoic, maybe even a bit pissed off. 

‚ÄúWhich hand?‚Äù he asks, deadpan. 

‚ÄúRight. Listen , if I seemed like I was making fun of the kid, I wasn‚Äôt. ‚Äú I reply, trying to smooth over whatever mistake I made. 

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt say anything wrong. ‚Äú Chuck offers as an explanation, but he still has that worried, miserable tone. 

If there is one thing I‚Äôve learned about Chuck , it‚Äôs that when he wants to stop a conversation, it‚Äôs best to listen. 

As weird as it was, after a couple of weeks, I‚Äôd forgotten all about the cloud that passed over chuck that night. Chalking it up to one too many, and a bad choice of topic. 

But one Wednesday in mid September , Chuck didn‚Äôt show up to open the store. Nothing I couldn‚Äôt handle, of course, but not so much as a call. 

It was 11 am and I was nearly drowning in customers. As much as I owe Chuck, I was about thirty minutes away from a pissed off phone call when he came walking in the door. 

‚ÄúHey boss, need you to‚Ä¶‚Äù I start, trying to get Chuck‚Äôs attention. 

He has his hat pulled low, and walks straight by me, closing the ancient door to his office with a little too much gusto. 

It‚Äôs early afternoon by the time I get a second to go back and talk to Chuck. 

The first smell that hits me is sweat, the kind of vinegar  reek that comes only from fear. The second is booze. 

‚ÄúWhat the hell? You‚Äôre day drinking?‚Äù I say, more confused than angry. 

The laminate desk Chuck sits behind is worn with age, it‚Äôs chrome legs, dull and clouded. 

‚ÄúBig Tim got in a car wreck last night. ‚Äú Chuck says, not turning my way. 

‚ÄúYeah, I heard. Is that what has you walking around with a coffee that smells like paint thinner?

He‚Äôs going to be fine, totaled that Firebird of his, but he‚Äôs back home already. ‚Äú I explain. 

‚ÄúI know, went to go see him.‚Äù Chuck says, taking a long swallow of what I‚Äôm guessing is a cup of ¬º coffee and ¬æ booze. 

‚ÄúAt what point do I get let in on the joke here? You're fucking scaring me with this thousand yard stare shit. ‚Äú  Something about the way this granite statue of a man is acting sets the hairs on the back of my neck on end. 

‚ÄúLock the door kid, we need to talk.‚Äù Chuck says , finally looking at me. 

He hasn‚Äôt slept, and there‚Äôs a look of horror in his eyes, no amount of poker-face can hide. 

I do as he asks, and pull up an old, green office chair to his desk. 

‚ÄúYou ever experienced something you can‚Äôt explain? ‚Äú He asks, point blank, almost, wistfully. 

‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôve ever seen bigfoot or anything, but I‚Äôm sure there is some weird shit out there. ‚Äú is my answer. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not talking about something ,off. 

I‚Äôm talking the kind of thing that has you wondering if it ever really happened. ‚Äú Chuck‚Äôs tone is depressed and hopeful all at the same time. 

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt say that I have, you?‚Äù I lead. 

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve got a reefer in your coat, it‚Äôd probably help my cause for you to smoke it. ‚Äú Chuck begins, with a chuckle, ‚Äú What I‚Äôve got to say isn‚Äôt very high on the believability scale. 

Back in my twenties, I was a different man. Bit of a wanderer, bit of a roughneck, but something kept brining me back here. 

Of course, the town was different then, smaller, closer. It was ‚Äô72 and folks around here were breathing a sigh of relief that the swinging sixties had come to an end. 

The town was doing well, except for one thing. Well, one person really. 

Elroy Kinston. 

A town bully, not something that‚Äôs going to happen nowadays. Even out here, you‚Äôve got cameras on you every second of the day. 

But back then, in a little burg like this, one man could cause a lot of misery. 

He was the kind of ornery, vindictive prick who knows how the law works. 

He was ten years or so older than myself, almost a boogeyman growing up.  

He said he was a biker, but he was just an asshole with a crotch-rocket. Never saw the man with a friend let alone a gang. 

Of course the law would get him for things here and there, a couple months for a fight that got out of hand, weekend jail for pushing drugs, but nothing major. 

When it came to real time, Elroy had the devil‚Äôs luck. 

By ‚Äô70 or so, he‚Äôd beaten a manslaughter wrap, and at that point, folks decided to just give the man his space. Better to be cleaning up broken windows, or nursing a black eye than six feet under. 

One night, I found myself at Norm‚Äôs, by my lonesome and looking for some female companionship. 

The night went on and nothing of the sort came my way. 

The bar was full of mining boys, engineers from the quarry. Good guys, but we‚Äôre talking college boys, not miners. Soft men. 

Elroy walked in, and I could smell the bad intentions on him. 

But it‚Äôs a free country, man can drink where he pleases. So I just watched, and drank.

He's got a conman‚Äôs charm and soon enough, he‚Äôs made a couple of friends who are more than happy to buy a few rounds. 

I‚Äôve seen this before. Soon enough Elroy is going to find something to take offence to, and one of these College boys is going to be missing teeth. 

Good sense told me to stay out of it. But something about his smirking, coyote look, got my dander up. 

He steps backward into one of his new friends, I can‚Äôt hear the conversation, but I can see what‚Äôs going to happen. 

As the engineer apologizes, I down my drink. As Elroy starts to shout, I‚Äôm out of my chair. 

I take out my wallet, as Elroy starts to get into the man‚Äôs face. 

I‚Äôve paid for my beer when the engineer is shoved, it catches the five foot seven man totally off guard. He hits the ground on his ass. 

Elroy, he‚Äôs about my size, greasy curled hair, and plenty of yard-bird muscle. 

Well, I inform him that if he intends on a fight that night, it sure as hell isn‚Äôt going to be with the man pissing himself on the floor. 

The situation got tense, but guys like him aren‚Äôt looking for a square fight. He makes some threats and leaves. 

Came at me from an alley on the walk home though. 

I got my bearings quick enough, and it turned into a typical drunken fight. Nothing I hadn‚Äôt been through a dozen times. 

Never been stabbed before though, it was a real hollow, deep pain in my bicep. 

I don‚Äôt remember much in specific, but that knife found it‚Äôs way into it‚Äôs owner‚Äôs chest. 

Elroy hit the ground, a cheap, pawn shop switchblade deep in his ribs. Still alive, but on his way out. 

I could have called the law, hell , could have called an ambulance, but I didn‚Äôt. I wasn‚Äôt going to roll the dice on the rest of my life because of Elroy fucking Kinston. 

So I finished the job, did the world a favor, and buried that son-of-a-bitch ten feet deep where no one would ever find him. ‚Äú

‚ÄúSo you killed a guy?‚Äù I say, shocked.

‚ÄúThought I did. 

The very next day, Elroy was driving that rat-rod of his, down main street, not a mark on him. ‚Äú Chuck looks to me as he talks, trying to judge if I‚Äôm believing him or not, ‚Äú After that, things started happening. It started with fires, accidents, floods. But eventually, turned to folks talking about the kinds of things that belong in a midnight movie. 

No one knew how, or why, no one but me that is. 

I watched for a year as this place turned from unlucky, to god-damned cursed. ‚Äú Chuck pauses, he‚Äôs actually shaking, ‚Äú You think I‚Äôm full of shit don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

‚Äú Real answer? Undecided. 

What do you mean, cursed?‚Äù

‚ÄúEvery town has stories, a couple of odd-ducks who say they‚Äôve seen ghosts, or some preacher who swears he‚Äôs been face to face with old scratch. 

During that year, damn near everyone in Harrington had a story other folks wouldn‚Äôt believe. It was like we were a magnet for all of the darkest things in the world. 

Something had to be done. 

I got 6 of my closest friends and told them everything I knew. One took off upstate, the other 5 and I decided to try our hand at stopping things. 

We did our best to figure out what happened, but back then there was no internet, the world was a much smaller place. All we could find were rumors, tall tales, and wild speculation. And even then, pickings were thin.‚Äù Chuck stops for a second while he drinks more of his ‚Äòcoffee‚Äô.

‚ÄúSlow down with that. 

What did you guys do?‚Äù I say, whether I believe him or not, I‚Äôm interested.

‚ÄúNathan, the sheriff‚Äôs deputy figured he‚Äôd go at him head on. Ski mask, and scattergun in the middle of the night. 

When they found his body, they figured it was a bear.

We knew this problem needed some kind of, what‚Äôs the word?‚Äù  Chuck asks. 

‚ÄúEsoteric?‚Äù I guess. 

‚ÄúSeems close enough.  Esoteric , solution. But we didn‚Äôt have one, we were 5 young men from the middle of nowhere. We had nothing more than grit and the stupidity of youth on our side. 

Another thing that was different back then was how easy it was to get your hands on explosives.  Folks just trusted each other more I guess. Either that or lunatics hadn‚Äôt started abusing the privilege.

So we figured if we couldn‚Äôt find anything, esoteric, we‚Äôd do the next best thing. 

We went in knowing we might not come out. And that was true for all but two of us.  

I saw things at that lunatic‚Äôs shack that still make me wonder if god  has an eye on his children any more. But Kyle and Quint, then gave themselves to turn that place into a crater. 

The man himself was my job. 

Face to face, there was a power about him, a dark fog that hung around Elroy. It made my blood run cold. 

He chased me through the sickly , dying trees, scattering downed branches and brush like it wasn‚Äôt even there. No man can move like he did. 

I lost him somewhere near the tree-line. But saw him again when I got to my truck, leaning against it with one hand. 

Tim and I, we we‚Äôre plan B, there was no plan C. 

In the dead of night, through  leaves, and branches, Tim made the shot. 

The  first barbed,  steel bolt pierced Elroy‚Äôs hand, sticking to the door of the truck.  The second did much of the same to his thigh. 

Elroy tore at his limbs like a trapped wolf, he ripped his hand clean off in about 6 seconds. 

The bundle of TNT I lobbed at his feet had a seven second fuse. 

There was nothing left of Elroy, his house, or my truck. 

We figured that was the end of things. 

Now, I‚Äôm not so sure. ‚Äú Chuck finishes his story, trying to read my reaction. 

‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm definitely not high enough for this. ‚Äú I say.

‚ÄúSo you think I‚Äôm full of shit?‚Äù Chuck accuses. 

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs say I don‚Äôt, for the sake of argument. What does that have to do with what's going on now?‚Äù I ask. 

‚ÄúTim was ran off the road. ‚Äú Chuck says, ‚Äú The man that did it said he had a message from Elroy. 

He says, he‚Äôll be seeing us soon.‚Äù

‚ÄúChuck, I don‚Äôt know if I believe all the paranormal stuff , but by the fact things have you like this, I know you are involved with some bad people. 

I‚Äôve got a record, man. You know this. 

 I can‚Äôt afford to get mixed up in some old-school blood feud going on so long it‚Äôs developed legends. ‚Äú My tone is a mix of shame and anger, ‚Äú And besides, you know me, I‚Äôm not a fighter. If this guy has some brother or friend trying to screw with you, plenty of folks around here would have your back. ‚Äú

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the problem kid, I‚Äôve seen how people in this town react when things start going sideways in a way they can‚Äôt understand. 

But I respect your decision, any way this hand plays out is going to get messy, and you don‚Äôt need any more of that in your life.

If you‚Äôre fixing to leave, I‚Äôve got 5k in cash to help you get the hell away from this place. No hard feelings. ‚Äú Chuck finishes the offer and his coffee at nearly the same time. 


The fact I didn‚Äôt take the money and run was one in a long list of stupid decisions I‚Äôve made in my life. But something inside me made me feel that I owed the old man. If he needed me to hold a baseball bat and try to look scary,  why not? 

So I found myself at Norm‚Äôs , drinking slowly and alone. Trying to make sense of the growing level of strange in my life. 

The answer I found at the bottom of a bottle was as follows:

My friend chuck, has likely been suffering from PTSD for a long time. He‚Äôs taken the event that caused it, mixed it up with a few memories from his time in the service ( I assume. ) and made it into some kind of paranormal event in his mind. 

That being said, scumbag families hold grudges, that goes double in isolated burgs like this. Decades mean nothing. 

Chuck needs help, and for all the dumb things I‚Äôve caught time for, if worst comes to worst, at least this will be for a good cause. 

Riding a good buzz and a moral high, I found myself walking home under the harsh arc lights of main street. 

It was quiet, a little under an hour before last call, the street was calm. It felt like I had the town to myself. 

As many times as I‚Äôve seen the inside of a jail cell, I‚Äôm not a tough guy. When me and the law come into conflict, violence isn‚Äôt the reason. Hell, even on the inside, I got by minding my own business and keeping the right friends. 

So , as I walk I start to think about how I‚Äôm going to go about convincing some inbred criminal to leave my friend alone. 

I‚Äôm on my third inebriated draft of an absolutely terrible scary speech when I hear it. 

It‚Äôs quiet at first, as if off in the distance. A rattling, grinding noise, an engine barely managing to run. 

I look back to see what piece of shit bike was living out it‚Äôs last seconds. Hoping i catch sight of it‚Äôs owner. 

I see nothing at first, then a couple blocks away, the streetlights on either side of the road burst. 

The roaring, decrepit engine suddenly seems much closer, the sound rising almost instantly. 

The next streetlights burst in a spray of broken glass and molten filament, keeping whatever dying conveyance I‚Äôm hearing out of my sight. 

One part of my brain is screaming at me to run, or hide. The other is telling me that I‚Äôm being an idiot and nearly having a heart attack over some faulty wiring that was likely last replaced well before I was born. 

So, for a moment, I stand, indecisive, transfixed. 

I catch a glimpse, for just a fraction of a second right before the next set of lights explode. 

I don‚Äôt see a bike, but I see a dozen or so silhouettes. People clad in black, walking nearly in unison. 

The sound starts to reach window rattling levels, the lights are destroying themselves quicker. Common sense finally takes hold. 

I bolt in the opposite direction as fast as my booze hindered legs will carry me. 

The engine‚Äôs roar brings to mind the scream of something massive, old, and evil. 

I skid to a stop, losing balance, and a decent amount of flesh from my palms as I scramble to get back to my feet. 

About two blocks away, the lights in front of me begin to burst. On either side, pitch black night begins to encroach.  The engine roar hits me in stereo now.  Loud enough to be painful. 

Panic and fear hit me hard enough to threaten consciousness. 

   I don‚Äôt think, I turn right down an alley, seeing some kind of refuge in the dim light from aging scones in the wall. 

As I do, the noise of the engine suddenly cuts off. My ears are ringing, sweat pours from me, drenching my shirt. I try the rusted handles of disused doors to no avail. 

I scream for help, someone has to hear me. 

But then again, someone has to have heard the earth-shaking sound of the engine. Yet no one seems to be investigating. 

No fire escapes, nothing that could be used as a weapon. I feel trapped, and for some reason, small. 

My back is to the wall, and while I can‚Äôt see a damn thing, I can hear footsteps, slow, purposeful footsteps. 

The last set of lights destroy themselves, plunging me into pure darkness. 

Silence, a ringing lack of volume, pregnant with the potential of violence and evil. 

A hiss,  my eyes burn with a sudden brightness, tearing up. It takes me a few seconds to make sense of what, or rather, who, I‚Äôm seeing.

She‚Äôs  a few inches taller than me, her bald head is covered in overlapping layers of scars. Some look purposeful, others like the reminders of brutal fights. 

She holds a road flare, head cocked, one eye slightly clouded and askew. 

The orange light makes the tattered, rusted biker‚Äôs leathers she wears look like the hide of some hell-spawned creature. 

‚ÄúYou Chuck‚Äôs friend?‚Äù she says, her voice is calm, like we just ran into each other at the coffee shop. 

I think about lying, but I figure she wouldn‚Äôt be asking if she didn‚Äôt already know. 

‚ÄúYeah, I am. ‚Äú I try to sound confident, I could spend a page describing how much I failed. 

‚Äú Good‚Äù The woman says, walking toward me, ‚ÄúMy name‚Äôs River, but you can call me, sir. ‚Äú 

She stands inches from me, I can feel the heat of the flare. 

‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù I ask. 

Before I realize it the woman has me by the throat, nails filed to wicked points dig into my neck hard enough to draw blood. I try to get away, she‚Äôs tall, but rail thin. Somehow though, her grip is immovable. 

She pokes my chest with the flare, just a brief fraction of a second of contact, but the pain is bad enough I drench her arm in vomit. 

Disgusted she easily throws me into the opposite wall. I hear the action of a switchblade and see her holding a wicked, serrated blade as she stalks toward my prone form. 

‚ÄúYou fucking deaf, or stupid?‚Äù she demands, ‚Äú Try that again.‚Äù

I pat out the smoldering fabric of my shirt, river wipes her sleeve on my head, studs and chains tearing out chunks of hair. 

‚ÄúWhat did you want, sir?‚Äù I say, trying to stand, every muscle screaming in pain. 

‚ÄúThere you go. 

What I want, is for you to get a message to Chuck. 

Elroy is giving him 7 days to get his shit in order. Then things get interesting. ‚Äú  River shows disgust when she talks about Chuck. 

Fighter or not, I decide to swing for the fences and run for the hills. My fist isn‚Äôt even half way cocked backward before River casually has the knife a quarter inch from my eye. 

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt. ‚Äú She says, bluntly, ‚Äú See, I‚Äôm a real forgiving type. Being nice, it‚Äôs just in my nature. 

But, the boss? He doesn‚Äôt really, let things go. ‚Äú 

As she talks, she moves the knife upward, drawing my gaze to the night sky. 

As the flare goes out, in the gloom, and scant starlight, I see it. 

It‚Äôs barely visible, an ethereal, suggestion of a massive, twisted human form. A wicked thing, floating above the assembled, leather clad people like an evil miasma. 

I can‚Äôt see eyes, I‚Äôm not even sure I can see the thing itself, but I can feel it looking at me. 

  I can‚Äôt do anything but shut my eyes against the sanity straining horror in front of me. I expect my throat to be cut, or my heart to be pierced at any second. 

But the death blow never comes. When I finally muster the courage to open my eyes, I‚Äôm alone. The street is lit, and if it wasn‚Äôt for the fact I‚Äôve been beaten and burned to hell, I might think it was all just some kind of hallucination. 

But the blistered, weeping wound in my chest isn‚Äôt a hallucination. And I know, neither was that thing that was herding River and her friends. 

I feel like a spec of dust caught up in a tornado. And when I finally make it to Chuck‚Äôs house, body screaming for rest and medical attention, the old man is waiting as if expecting me. 

‚Äú We‚Äôve got a week.‚Äù I say grimly. 

‚ÄúWe drinking ourselves to death, or trying to figure out the mysteries of the universe in a week?‚Äù Chuck asks. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the boss. ‚Äú I say,  figuring both options will amount to the same in the end.

Maybe join my friends and I for Dungeons & Dragons? Go to a Ren Fair with a knight in shining armor? If so, I'd¬† be excited to hear from you! ü§ì

I‚Äôm here looking to go on dates, searching for a relationship that could become serious. I‚Äôm at a point where I‚Äôm trying to get my career stabilized, but at the same time I don‚Äôt want to keep my life on hold waiting for it.¬†

My dream is to be an entrepreneur and run a video game studio, and I‚Äôm doing that! I created a game studio with my brother and we‚Äôre building a VR game that is getting close to release! But we‚Äôve been funding it out of pocket, so I‚Äôm not in a position where I can move out and start a family. üôÉ I guess I‚Äôm hoping to find a partner who‚Äôs excited to go on this journey with me. üòè

I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm unusually and refreshingly open and honest. Which is most likely because I‚Äôm maybe probably autistic, and definitely ADHD. üòÑ It can manifest as a need to explain my thoughts and feelings in detail. Cool right? üòÑ You‚Äôll never have to guess what I‚Äôm feeling or why, since I will pretty much always blurt it out AND explain it. üòÑ

It‚Äôs also why gaming is a major montropic focus for me. Hence why I built a career around it. I can easily spend 6-8 hours a day working on games, only to turn around and play for another 6-8 hours with friends, so I need a partner who‚Äôs excited to share that with me. üòè

Communication is also extremely important to me. I like messaging back and forth with a romantic interest at least once a day, and I try to reply within 24 hours at most. I‚Äôm aware that can be a bit much for some, and if so feel free to set my expectations, but conversely messaging once a week is definitely not frequent enough for me. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I also think having compatible values is critical in a relationship so I try to cover them as early as possible. I don‚Äôt cleanly conform to either major political party. I‚Äôd just blurt out my individual stances here but I don‚Äôt have room to cover them with the detail and nuance they deserve. üòÖ¬†

I tend to be very open and direct by nature, and I \_am\_ looking for romance here, however I don‚Äôt want to give the impression that I expect to jump right into being boyfriend and girlfriend. Nor do I think one or two dates means we‚Äôre ‚Äúin a relationship.‚Äù Dating is a two player game, and I‚Äôm looking for a partner who's as head over heels for me as I am for her. üòè

Typically I like to start with messaging or calls to see if we match on interest, values, and chemistry before planning an in person date. My go-to first date is a coffee house or mall date so we can get to know each other in person while, you know‚Ä¶ still being in public so we can easily bail if either of us turns out to be an axe murderer. üò≥ And my usual second dates are similarly public activity dates like laser tag, rock climbing gyms, or ironically, axe throwing. üòÖ

I don‚Äôt buy into the third date sex stereotype, and in fact I‚Äôm a virgin. üòÑ I think sex is great, but it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm saving for ‚ÄúThe One.‚Äù üòè Plus in spite of my bluntness here, I‚Äôm shy as heck about it. üôÉ Physical affection, however, is very important to me, so I‚Äôm seeking a partner who similarly wants to hold hands, sit together with our arms around each other, and eventually cuddle closely as the relationship develops.üòè

Finally, and I may have buried the lead a bit here, but I do have other interests and qualities outside gaming. üòÑ I work out frequently and teach martial arts. üòÉ I play electric guitar and drums. üòé I enjoy hikes, obstacle races, and parkour. üèÉ I like fixing things; from computers, to appliances, to plumbing, and I‚Äôm a half decent cook. üòÉ I‚Äôm obviously a proud nerd, and I can, and frequently do, imitate a modest array of accents. ü§ì And I‚Äôm a college graduate, own a car, and paid off all my debt! üòé¬†

So yeah! üòÉ If you think I‚Äôm an attractive match I‚Äôd love to hear from you!

We met in a coffee shop. She came in, dropped my things, and wanted to leave immediately. The way she handled my stuff caused my coffee to spill. It was really embarrassing because it seemed like she did it intentionally. Then she walked out the door. 

As I tried to clean up and go through my things, I noticed my passport was missing‚Äîthe main reason I wanted my stuff back. I called her, but she didn't pick up. When I stepped outside the coffee shop, I saw her waiting. The first thing she did was ask me to buy her weed. I said no. I told her to go ask the guy she cheated on me with or the older guy who gives her money for kissing him. She said, ‚ÄúI deleted and blocked their numbers.‚Äù 

I asked her why she‚Äôd do that when it doesn't matter anymore, and she said she didn‚Äôt care about them enough to keep them in her life. That pissed me off so much. I told her, ‚ÄúYou cared enough to jeopardize our entire relationship. You didn‚Äôt even think about the hard time I was going through, and how your actions were like nails in the coffin. You cared enough to let them answer my calls on your phone. When you came back, you said he was just your friend, but when he called you drunk, you flipped out like you cared for him. You even wrote in your journal after you went out with him, fantasizing about him, and the guy isn‚Äôt even good-looking. (I'm not trying to be petty, but it would‚Äôve been easier for me if he was good-looking because now it feels like anyone could have had you.) And when you came back, you said you couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about him because he was falling in love with you. Bitch, what about me? Every damn day, I got drunk and high, then cried myself to sleep. You abandoned me, knowing full well I don‚Äôt have anyone in this country, while you have your whole family, who still didn‚Äôt care enough to support you when you ended up in the psych ward.‚Äù

I yelled, ‚ÄúI never abandoned you!‚Äù then she started accusing me of cheating and saying I‚Äôm not a saint, or that I used her for her body because she was convenient. Like, what the hell? She literally took no accountability and said I abused her. Then I showed her pictures of all the times she made me bleed or burned my face with a cigarette. She gave a fake apology, acting like she didn‚Äôt even know she‚Äôd done those things.

By the end of it, she acted like I was the problem for bringing up all her awful actions. If you don‚Äôt want someone to bring up your terrible behavior, then don‚Äôt do those things in the first place and act like everything is normal afterward. Now I feel like this is why all her friendships fall apart, or maybe other people weren‚Äôt as bad as she makes them out to be. I think the reason her parents view her as an eyesore is because she‚Äôs probably hurt them so many times that they can‚Äôt look past her actions, even when she tries to be good. 

I wanna know does she not realize the impact of her actions or the value of relationships. I have always noticed this thing with her where if she makes a new friend or something like she adopts their mindset and start valuing them more in her life. Is this because of her bpd or it's just her? ",1,1728234540.0,BPD,0,1.0,False

**Why You‚Äôll Love Chocolate Peanut Butter Muffins**

Chocolate and peanut butter are a match made in heaven, and these muffins deliver that combination in a way that‚Äôs both indulgent and satisfying. With a tender crumb, bursts of rich chocolate, and creamy peanut butter swirled throughout, these muffins are the perfect treat for any time of day. They‚Äôre not overly sweet, making them a great snack or even a grab-and-go breakfast. Best of all, the recipe is simple and quick, so you can whip up a batch whenever you‚Äôre craving something delicious.

**Ingredients for Chocolate Peanut Butter Muffins**

To make these rich and flavorful muffins, you‚Äôll need:

* **1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour**
* **1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder**
* **1 teaspoon baking powder**
* **1/2 teaspoon baking soda**
* **1/4 teaspoon salt**
* **3/4 cup sugar**
* **2 large eggs**
* **1/2 cup vegetable oil**¬†(or melted butter)
* **1/2 cup milk**¬†(or any dairy-free alternative)
* **1 teaspoon vanilla extract**
* **1/2 cup creamy peanut butter**
* **1/2 cup chocolate chips**¬†(optional)

**Step-by-Step Recipe for Chocolate Peanut Butter Muffins**

**Step 1: Preheat the Oven**

Preheat your oven to 350¬∞F (175¬∞C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners or lightly grease each muffin cup.

**Step 2: Combine the Dry Ingredients**

In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt until well combined. Set the bowl aside.

**Step 3: Mix the Wet Ingredients**

In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the vegetable oil (or melted butter), milk, and vanilla extract, and mix until smooth.

**Step 4: Combine the Wet and Dry Ingredients**

Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense muffins. Fold in the chocolate chips, if using.

**Step 5: Swirl in the Peanut Butter**

In a small microwave-safe bowl, warm the peanut butter for about 15‚Äì20 seconds, just until softened and easier to swirl. Spoon the muffin batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about 2/3 full. Drop a small spoonful of the warmed peanut butter onto the center of each muffin, then use a toothpick or knife to gently swirl the peanut butter into the batter.

**Step 6: Bake the Muffins**

Bake the muffins for 18‚Äì20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. The tops should be set, and the muffins should have a slight spring when touched.

**Step 7: Cool and Serve**

Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature, and enjoy the rich, chocolatey goodness with a swirl of creamy peanut butter in every bite.

**Tips for Making the Best Chocolate Peanut Butter Muffins**

1. **Don‚Äôt overmix the batter:**¬†Overmixing can lead to tough, dense muffins. Stir just until the wet and dry ingredients are combined to keep the muffins light and fluffy.
2. **Use creamy peanut butter:**¬†For the best texture and swirl, use smooth, creamy peanut butter. If you prefer chunky peanut butter, you‚Äôll get little bits of peanuts in each bite, which adds a fun texture.
3. **Add chocolate chips for extra indulgence:**¬†Mixing in chocolate chips gives the muffins an extra burst of chocolatey goodness. You can also sprinkle some on top before baking for a visually appealing touch.
4. **Make it healthier:**¬†To make these muffins a little lighter, substitute some of the oil with applesauce or Greek yogurt. You can also use whole wheat flour for added fiber.
5. **Freeze for later:**Ôæ†These muffins freeze well, making them perfect for meal prep. Just cool them completely, wrap individually, and freeze for up to three months. Thaw at room temperature or microwave for a quick snack.

**Why This Recipe Works**

The combination of cocoa and peanut butter gives these muffins their signature flavor profile, while the balance of wet and dry ingredients ensures they stay moist and tender. The peanut butter swirl not only adds flavor but also creates a beautiful visual effect. By using simple, pantry-staple ingredients, this recipe is easy to whip up whenever you‚Äôre in the mood for a treat, and it can be adapted to fit your preferences.

**Serving Suggestions for Chocolate Peanut Butter Muffins**

* **For breakfast:**Ôæ†Pair these muffins with a cup of coffee or tea for a sweet start to your morning.
* **As a snack:**Ôæ†These muffins are great as an afternoon pick-me-up or a snack for the kids after school.
* **For dessert:**¬†Serve warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for an indulgent dessert that‚Äôs sure to impress.

**Conclusion**

**Chocolate Peanut Butter Muffins**¬†are the perfect way to indulge in the classic flavor combination of chocolate and peanut butter. Easy to make and loaded with rich flavor, these muffins are perfect for any occasion, from breakfast to dessert. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned baker or just starting out, this recipe is simple enough to follow and guaranteed to satisfy your chocolate and peanut butter cravings.",1,1728234341.0,u_Zdigitalkeys,0,1.0,False

How are Sweetgum Kriyul people different from other Creole groups like Louisiana Creole and Cape Verdean Creole?,"We all have family traditions, passed down from generation to generation. Languages, recipes, and even the holidays we celebrate. But what happens when people of different cultures with different traditions meet? 

The descendants of two different cultural groups might try to combine them to create a new fusion culture. This happens time and time again through history. The results are very interesting. That is exactly what happened when Europeans, enslaved Africans, and Indigenous peoples all lived together on the Virginia Peninsula and other parts of Eastern North America during the period of colonization in the 1500s and 1600s. They swapped more than just recipes and languages.

 Colonizers from Europe came from across the Atlantic and just settled in North America, dead set on profiting off the abudant natural resources of the continent, like silver, gold, coffee, and sugar cane, with little mind to the indigenous peoples already living there. These colonizers had their own cultures and ideas, and toted them along to a land that was already rich with indigenous ones. The European settlement of North America led to a blend of these cultures and societies that would ultimately create distinctly new ones. Today, we call them Creole cultures - and the story of how they came to be is anything but straightforward.

When you hear the word Creole, you probably imagine Louisiana swamplands with Bald Cypress trees draped in Spanish Moss and with shrimp boats on the waters nearby. Buts it's important to note that there is no single unified Creole culture or people. The word is used to reference to many different cultures that developed during the age of European colonization. While many Creole cultures evolved in the Americas, some can be found on islands off the coast of Africa and in the Indian Ocean - far from the places that most people think of as ""Creole.""

But they all have some important stuff in common. All Creole cultures are hybrid cultures, created through Creolization (the culture-swap between Europeans, Africans, and other Indigenous Peoples). When these people were put together in close proximity, their traditions and backgrounds blended and fused, creating new cultures.

Take the Virginia Peninsula, for example. It was originally home to the Powhatan tribe and other Native American/Indigenous people groups. Then, in the 1500s, the Europeans decided to built Jamestown into a settlement that attracted settlers and merchants and traders, and eventually they were joined by enslaved Africans, all to live among the Indigenous Americans. Sometimes residents of the city intermarried across different races and had children. They were from parents of different races. They were not British, nor African, neither were they Indigenous Americans nor Spanish or French. They were something new, a mix of all the parent cultures that swirled about in their lives on the Virginia peninsula growing up all those hundreds of years ago. They were Creole. Much later, they would be given names like Sweetgum Kriyul and Ethnic Qarsherskiyan and other terms so they wouldn't be confused with Louisiana Creoles and other distinct Creole cultures. For the time being, they usually would be labeled as just one race, whichever they appeared to look the most like in resemblance, and that became their identity that was placed onto them. 

This process was happening all over the world to make new Creole cultures. In 1532, a group of Spanish conquistadors invades what is now Lima, Peru, home to the Inca Empire. The conquistadors, led by a guy named Pizarro, mounted a violent campaign to take power from the Inca. Pizarro succeeded, and the Spanish officially established the city of Lima in 1535. However, the Indigenous People and their culture didn't just disappear. Lima was still filled with Incas and other Indigenous Peruvians, their traditions, and their languages. 
    But what does one call the new people born under the Spanish control of Lima? They were not Spaniards, exactly, but they weren't Inca either. So they were called Creole, which translated to ""someone who is native to here."" 
But even more variations of this story exist across the globe. Because the details of each Creole culture are so specific to their place and parent cultures, there are a lot of ways to be Creole. 

Take the Spanish-speaking Creoles. These people come from the Viceroyalty of New Spain, a colony centered around Mexico that extended as far North as California and, as far South as Panama, and included all of the Spanish-claimed islands like Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines. 
In these places, the Spanish government created a sort of racial hierarchy known as the ""Casta"" System. In the Casta system, the word Creole was used to refer specifically to White people whose ancestors were European, but who were born in the Americas - and so they weren't fully European themselves (culturally atleast). These Spanish Creoles were banned from certain positions in the government, the military, and the church because of their mixed culture. 

Meanwhile, in other parts of the world, the word Creole very clearly meant people of mixed racial heritage. In North America, mid-Atlantic states grew cotton and tobacco, profiting off of the labor of enslaved Africans as well as indentured servants from Europe. And as they labored together, the intermingling of these groups led to the creation of various Creoles like the Sweetgum Kriyul people which includes Ethnic Qarsherskiyans as well as the Gullah Geechee Creoles of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and the Back Bay area of Virginia. 
Halfway around the world in the Indian Ocean, the Seychellois Creoles evolved in the hundred-and-fifteen island nation known as the Seychelles. These islands were under the control of many different European nations at different times, and were populated not only by European colonizers but also by East Africans, Indigenous Islanders, and migrants from India, China, and Malaysia. 

But despite their differences, all of these versions of Creolization have some important things in common. In all of these cases, European colonizers disrupted the traditions of Indigenous through the introduction of their own languages, heritage, and traditions. In all these cases, these Europeans brought laborers - by force - to work on plantations, introducing yet more diverse cultures into the mix. And in all of these cases, rather than fading out, these different cultures grew into one another, creating new generations of multicultural people, specific to their place and diverse cultural heritage. 

However, Creole is not simply an ethnic identity, but also an important form of cultural resistance to European colonization. In all of these interactions, it's important to pay attention to the power dynamics involved. All of this came about because wealthy Europeans invaded and conquered Indigenous Americans, forcibly displaced and enslaved Africans, and profited off the unpaid, involuntary labor of both of these other groups. These Europeans also established themselves as the leaders of the new governments they created, along with a legal framework to enforce not only their political supremacy, but also their cultural supremacy, as they saw it, as well. 

However, while it's easy enough to create laws, it's much harder to change cultures. While Europeans tried to impose their values, cultures, and even religious festivals on these peoples, African, Asian, and Indigenous peoples reshaped them, combining their own culture with the European traditions. 
This process of blending and combining separate cultures into one new culture is called transculturation, which is another word for Creolization in these cases, essentially. 
Take religion. Both the Spanish and the French were majority Catholic, and most of them were determined to impose those beliefs onto their territories in the Americas, even going so far as to outlaw other traditional religions. However, despite this legal pressure, many Indigenous Americans and enslaved Africans would not abandon their cultures, and instead incorporated aspects of Christianity into their own religions, thereby creating new systems and traditions - and celebrations!

Maybe you've heard of Carnival, a season of public celebrations that includes parades, performances, and parties. There are Carnival celebrations all over the world, but some of the most famous come from the Creole cultures in Brazil and other South American and Caribbean countries like Trinidad and Tobago. The story of Carnival all started with European Catholics in the Late Medieval Era. For these Catholics, Lent was a holiday of self-denial. It began as a holiday of fasting, in which one could only eat one meal per day. This evolved into the more familiar holiday of abstention, in which people are expected to give up vices for a full forty days. So the day before Lent was a celebration of those things: a day of drinking, singing, dancing, eating, and other things. 
When the Spanish and French brought this tradition over to the Americas, the Indigenous and African peoples incorporated their own dances and music into the festivities. Dances like the Kalinda drew elements from traditional dances in Central Africa. Samba music likewise drew from ritual African drumming. And in the Pernambuco region of Brazil, groups who performed Maracatu, an Afro-Brazilian performance style, would also participate in Carnival. 

Similarly, the Mexican holiday known as the Day of the Dead is a fusion of Christian and Indigenous American cultures. While the Day of the Dead began as a traditional Aztec and Mexican celebration, Catholic priests hoped to ease the process of religious conversion by just - doubling up the holiday with the Christian All Saints' Day going along with it. By aligning traditional Indigenous American celebrations and beliefs with Christian holidays and saints, perhaps it would be easier to convert people to Catholicism, right? But the Indigenous People held fast to their own traditions and the result was a new celebration with its own unique traditions. Skulls, known as tzomplantli, were a common motif in Mesoamerican cultures. After the arrival of the Spanish, these were swapped with sugar skulls - one of the most recognizable aspects of Day of the Dead celebrations today, along with ofrendas, the shrines people build in their homes as offerings to family members who passed away. 

However, transculturation was not always a melting pot of music, dance, and parties, and this tension was apparent in the way European Catholicism often clashed with the belief systems of the various peoples they colonized. When enslaved Africans were brought to the French and Spanish colonies, many were forced to convert to Catholicism. But instead of abandoning their heritage, these Africans combined elements of Catholicism with elements of their traditional faiths, leading to the creation of things like Santeria in Cuba and Vodou in Haiti and Louisiana. These two religions are similar in many ways. Both evolved from polytheistic African traditions and religions, with Vodou evolving from Vodun, a West African religion built around the spirits of the Earth, nature, and human society. And while Santeria's origins are murkier, it's thought to have it's roots in the Yoruba religion of West Africa, and, like Vodun, revolves around the worship of multiple deities, called Orishas. The multiple deities worshipped in these traditional religions then blended with the worship of multiple Catholic saints, and so, Vodou and Santeria were born. 

In both of these Creole religions, people believed that you could ask the deities for favours by performing rituals, or by giving gifts to the deities, like animal sacrifices. And both developed in secrecy - for two important reasons. 
First, while the Catholic Church was willing to accept sweat sugar skulls and ofrendas, the polytheism and animal sacrifices practiced in Vodou and Santeria were just too different for these traditional Catholics, and were seen as heresy. The second reason is less about these religions themselves, and much more about who practiced them. Most of the adherents were enslaved Africans and the idea of large meetings of enslaved people calling upon deities to protect them kind of freaked out the European enslavers. As a means to prevent any potential revolts and to maintain control over the enslaved Africans, these Europeans forbade any large gatherings of enslaved people. 

As these religions and traditions exist today, they can be seen as a time capsule of specific moments in colonial history as well as a testament to the determination and staying power of long-held beliefs and traditions. 

All of these specific aspects of some of the various Creole cultures, from Carnival to Vodou, from samba to sugar skulls, were shaped by the unique circumstances of place and time, the merging of certain cultures in that exact location and at that exact moment. That is why each Creole culture is distinct from one another. 

There is no single definition for the word Creole, that is in many ways by design. After all, Creole - or Criollo - is Spanish for people who are native to Here. And every ""here"" is unique. 

Ethnic Qarsherskiyan people are a type of Sweetgum Kriyul people. Sweetgum Kriyul people are a Creole ethnicity created by the intermarrying of people of different races who were oppressed in the USA throughout a 500 year history dating back to colonial Jamestown. The Irish and other Celtic people, Germanic people, Native Americans, and West Africans make up much of the ancestry of Ethnic Qarsherskiyans and other Sweetgum Kriyul people. Ethnic Qarsherskiyan people are distinct in their identity because of a shared culture most ethnic Qarsherskiyan people have that is influenced by Islam, Zoroastrianism, Orthodox Christianity, the faith created in Morocco by Salih Ibn Tarif, Berber and North African culture, Korean culture, and Native American mythology and culture and religions.

I have fallen in love with two women in the 7 years I‚Äôve been with him. My partner may have given me a way out. ,"
I‚Äôm so sorry this is post is going to be a mess, because I‚Äôm a mess. I‚Äôm 31F and have always known I‚Äôm attracted to women and to a lesser extent, men. I come from a religious background and that religion has provided me with most of the infrastructure of my life. My community, my friends, my service, etc. While folks in my community wouldn‚Äôt be hateful towards wlw, I reasoned it would be easier to only date men and eventually married one so I could start a family. 

He is a very nice and kind man. He‚Äôs been good to me and supported me through my PhD. Nonetheless, I have always felt like there was something missing or that I have settled. I have been increasingly jaded by how careless he could be and how I haven‚Äôt really been sexually satisfied by him. But i stuck it out because I know he‚Äôs a good man and would be a good father. 

During this time however, I developed feelings for a female friend while we were engaged. I loved her a lot but pushed it down and transitioned my feelings back to just friendship. And now, 4 years into the marriage, I developed mutual feelings for another female friend who is also a wlw. I felt like I had met a soulmate. She is everything I would have wanted in a partner. Still, I am married so I set boundaries. But I ask myself, is this just going to keep happening? Am I just going to keep feeling things for people outside of my partnership because my partner does not meet my needs?

This is all happening in the background of dealing with my own infertility, starting couples therapy, and my husband‚Äôs recent small-scale infidelity. While I was recovering from endometriosis surgery to improve my fertility, my husband went out to coffee with another woman and they ended up cuddling on the couch in the coffee shop. He initially did not understand why I was so upset and told me that he got caught up in feeling wanted. I felt bad because maybe, because of who I am, I did not make him feel wanted and I am failing him. 

So now we are reevaluating our relationship. I want to make it work because I still feel this yearning for a family. I also do not want to make him sad and I don‚Äôt want to lose the infrastructure that being married has given me. I love my in-laws and the community I‚Äôve become a part of. And mostly, I‚Äôm just scared as I‚Äôm turning 32 soon and I don‚Äôt know what it would mean to start over. But part of me thinks, was this incident a way out? Is this a way eventually be with my dream partner? ",8,1728233896.0,latebloomerlesbians,4,0.9,False

1fxl2pt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sweetgum_Kriyul/comments/1fxl2pt/the_history_of_how_ethnuc_qarsherskiyan_people/,The history of how ethnuc Qarsherskiyan people and other Sweetgum Kriyul people and various other Creole cultures around the world came to be,"We all have family traditions, passed down from generation to generation. Languages, recipes, and even the holidays we celebrate. But what happens when people of different cultures with different traditions meet? 

The descendants of two different cultural groups might try to combine them to create a new fusion culture. This happens time and time again through history. The results are very interesting. That is exactly what happened when Europeans, enslaved Africans, and Indigenous peoples all lived together on the Virginia Peninsula and other parts of Eastern North America during the period of colonization in the 1500s and 1600s. They swapped more than just recipes and languages.

 Colonizers from Europe came from across the Atlantic and just settled in North America, dead set on profiting off the abudant natural resources of the continent, like silver, gold, coffee, and sugar cane, with little mind to the indigenous peoples already living there. These colonizers had their own cultures and ideas, and toted them along to a land that was already rich with indigenous ones. The European settlement of North America led to a blend of these cultures and societies that would ultimately create distinctly new ones. Today, we call them Creole cultures - and the story of how they came to be is anything but straightforward.

When you hear the word Creole, you probably imagine Louisiana swamplands with Bald Cypress trees draped in Spanish Moss and with shrimp boats on the waters nearby. Buts it's important to note that there is no single unified Creole culture or people. The word is used to reference to many different cultures that developed during the age of European colonization. While many Creole cultures evolved in the Americas, some can be found on islands off the coast of Africa and in the Indian Ocean - far from the places that most people think of as ""Creole.""

But they all have some important stuff in common. All Creole cultures are hybrid cultures, created through Creolization (the culture-swap between Europeans, Africans, and other Indigenous Peoples). When these people were put together in close proximity, their traditions and backgrounds blended and fused, creating new cultures.

Take the Virginia Peninsula, for example. It was originally home to the Powhatan tribe and other Native American/Indigenous people groups. Then, in the 1500s, the Europeans decided to built Jamestown into a settlement that attracted settlers and merchants and traders, and eventually they were joined by enslaved Africans, all to live among the Indigenous Americans. Sometimes residents of the city intermarried across different races and had children. They were from parents of different races. They were not British, nor African, neither were they Indigenous Americans nor Spanish or French. They were something new, a mix of all the parent cultures that swirled about in their lives on the Virginia peninsula growing up all those hundreds of years ago. They were Creole. Much later, they would be given names like Sweetgum Kriyul and Ethnic Qarsherskiyan and other terms so they wouldn't be confused with Louisiana Creoles and other distinct Creole cultures. For the time being, they usually would be labeled as just one race, whichever they appeared to look the most like in resemblance, and that became their identity that was placed onto them. 

This process was happening all over the world to make new Creole cultures. In 1532, a group of Spanish conquistadors invades what is now Lima, Peru, home to the Inca Empire. The conquistadors, led by a guy named Pizarro, mounted a violent campaign to take power from the Inca. Pizarro succeeded, and the Spanish officially established the city of Lima in 1535. However, the Indigenous People and their culture didn't just disappear. Lima was still filled with Incas and other Indigenous Peruvians, their traditions, and their languages. 
    But what does one call the new people born under the Spanish control of Lima? They were not Spaniards, exactly, but they weren't Inca either. So they were called Creole, which translated to ""someone who is native to here."" 
But even more variations of this story exist across the globe. Because the details of each Creole culture are so specific to their place and parent cultures, there are a lot of ways to be Creole. 

Take the Spanish-speaking Creoles. These people come from the Viceroyalty of New Spain, a colony centered around Mexico that extended as far North as California and, as far South as Panama, and included all of the Spanish-claimed islands like Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines. 
In these places, the Spanish government created a sort of racial hierarchy known as the ""Casta"" System. In the Casta system, the word Creole was used to refer specifically to White people whose ancestors were European, but who were born in the Americas - and so they weren't fully European themselves (culturally atleast). These Spanish Creoles were banned from certain positions in the government, the military, and the church because of their mixed culture. 

Meanwhile, in other parts of the world, the word Creole very clearly meant people of mixed racial heritage. In North America, mid-Atlantic states grew cotton and tobacco, profiting off of the labor of enslaved Africans as well as indentured servants from Europe. And as they labored together, the intermingling of these groups led to the creation of various Creoles like the Sweetgum Kriyul people which includes Ethnic Qarsherskiyans as well as the Gullah Geechee Creoles of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and the Back Bay area of Virginia. 
Halfway around the world in the Indian Ocean, the Seychellois Creoles evolved in the hundred-and-fifteen island nation known as the Seychelles. These islands were under the control of many different European nations at different times, and were populated not only by European colonizers but also by East Africans, Indigenous Islanders, and migrants from India, China, and Malaysia. 

But despite their differences, all of these versions of Creolization have some important things in common. In all of these cases, European colonizers disrupted the traditions of Indigenous through the introduction of their own languages, heritage, and traditions. In all these cases, these Europeans brought laborers - by force - to work on plantations, introducing yet more diverse cultures into the mix. And in all of these cases, rather than fading out, these different cultures grew into one another, creating new generations of multicultural people, specific to their place and diverse cultural heritage. 

However, Creole is not simply an ethnic identity, but also an important form of cultural resistance to European colonization. In all of these interactions, it's important to pay attention to the power dynamics involved. All of this came about because wealthy Europeans invaded and conquered Indigenous Americans, forcibly displaced and enslaved Africans, and profited off the unpaid, involuntary labor of both of these other groups. These Europeans also established themselves as the leaders of the new governments they created, along with a legal framework to enforce not only their political supremacy, but also their cultural supremacy, as they saw it, as well. 

However, while it's easy enough to create laws, it's much harder to change cultures. While Europeans tried to impose their values, cultures, and even religious festivals on these peoples, African, Asian, and Indigenous peoples reshaped them, combining their own culture with the European traditions. 
This process of blending and combining separate cultures into one new culture is called transculturation, which is another word for Creolization in these cases, essentially. 
Take religion. Both the Spanish and the French were majority Catholic, and most of them were determined to impose those beliefs onto their territories in the Americas, even going so far as to outlaw other traditional religions. However, despite this legal pressure, many Indigenous Americans and enslaved Africans would not abandon their cultures, and instead incorporated aspects of Christianity into their own religions, thereby creating new systems and traditions - and celebrations!

Maybe you've heard of Carnival, a season of public celebrations that includes parades, performances, and parties. There are Carnival celebrations all over the world, but some of the most famous come from the Creole cultures in Brazil and other South American and Caribbean countries like Trinidad and Tobago. The story of Carnival all started with European Catholics in the Late Medieval Era. For these Catholics, Lent was a holiday of self-denial. It began as a holiday of fasting, in which one could only eat one meal per day. This evolved into the more familiar holiday of abstention, in which people are expected to give up vices for a full forty days. So the day before Lent was a celebration of those things: a day of drinking, singing, dancing, eating, and other things. 
When the Spanish and French brought this tradition over to the Americas, the Indigenous and African peoples incorporated their own dances and music into the festivities. Dances like the Kalinda drew elements from traditional dances in Central Africa. Samba music likewise drew from ritual African drumming. And in the Pernambuco region of Brazil, groups who performed Maracatu, an Afro-Brazilian performance style, would also participate in Carnival. 

Similarly, the Mexican holiday known as the Day of the Dead is a fusion of Christian and Indigenous American cultures. While the Day of the Dead began as a traditional Aztec and Mexican celebration, Catholic priests hoped to ease the process of religious conversion by just - doubling up the holiday with the Christian All Saints' Day going along with it. By aligning traditional Indigenous American celebrations and beliefs with Christian holidays and saints, perhaps it would be easier to convert people to Catholicism, right? But the Indigenous People held fast to their own traditions and the result was a new celebration with its own unique traditions. Skulls, known as tzomplantli, were a common motif in Mesoamerican cultures. After the arrival of the Spanish, these were swapped with sugar skulls - one of the most recognizable aspects of Day of the Dead celebrations today, along with ofrendas, the shrines people build in their homes as offerings to family members who passed away. 

However, transculturation was not always a melting pot of music, dance, and parties, and this tension was apparent in the way European Catholicism often clashed with the belief systems of the various peoples they colonized. When enslaved Africans were brought to the French and Spanish colonies, many were forced to convert to Catholicism. But instead of abandoning their heritage, these Africans combined elements of Catholicism with elements of their traditional faiths, leading to the creation of things like Santeria in Cuba and Vodou in Haiti and Louisiana. These two religions are similar in many ways. Both evolved from polytheistic African traditions and religions, with Vodou evolving from Vodun, a West African religion built around the spirits of the Earth, nature, and human society. And while Santeria's origins are murkier, it's thought to have it's roots in the Yoruba religion of West Africa, and, like Vodun, revolves around the worship of multiple deities, called Orishas. The multiple deities worshipped in these traditional religions then blended with the worship of multiple Catholic saints, and so, Vodou and Santeria were born. 

In both of these Creole religions, people believed that you could ask the deities for favours by performing rituals, or by giving gifts to the deities, like animal sacrifices. And both developed in secrecy - for two important reasons. 
First, while the Catholic Church was willing to accept sweat sugar skulls and ofrendas, the polytheism and animal sacrifices practiced in Vodou and Santeria were just too different for these traditional Catholics, and were seen as heresy. The second reason is less about these religions themselves, and much more about who practiced them. Most of the adherents were enslaved Africans and the idea of large meetings of enslaved people calling upon deities to protect them kind of freaked out the European enslavers. As a means to prevent any potential revolts and to maintain control over the enslaved Africans, these Europeans forbade any large gatherings of enslaved people. 

As these religions and traditions exist today, they can be seen as a time capsule of specific moments in colonial history as well as a testament to the determination and staying power of long-held beliefs and traditions. 

All of these specific aspects of some of the various Creole cultures, from Carnival to Vodou, from samba to sugar skulls, were shaped by the unique circumstances of place and time, the merging of certain cultures in that exact location and at that exact moment. That is why each Creole culture is distinct from one another. 

There is no single definition for the word Creole, that is in many ways by design. After all, Creole - or Criollo - is Spanish for people who are native to Here. And every ""here"" is unique. ",1,1728233755.0,Sweetgum_Kriyul,0,1.0,False

I was there as a VFX Supervisor for an ad film shoot, working with an international teamn that included Americans, British, Argentine, Lebanese, and Egyptian colleagues. I was the only Asian on the team.
As is common on set, coffees are delivered based on our preferences, and always go for an iced latte. One day, the coffee arrived while was busy, so asked them to set mine aside. Aftera while, I went to grab it, and standing by the counter was a Kuwaiti guy who was introduced as someone in charge of the studio.
When I reached for my coffee, he stopped me and said, ""This is for the Americans."" The coffee literally had my name on it. tried to explain it was mine, but he refused to let me take it. just said, ""Alright, cool,"" and went back to work with a heavy heart.

The guy wasn't even that old, which made it all the more surprising. I didn't tell anyone about it at the time, but it still bothers me. Isn't it a bit sad that despite our progress as civilized humans, we sometimes still hold on to delusions and prejudices? I'm not here to frame Kuwait as a racist place at all. I've met a lot of great, kind-hearted Kuwaitis during my time there, but this incident left a mark. I'm just wondering, is this how Asians are generally treated in Kuwait, or was it just an isolated case?

1fxl1xb,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1fxl1xb/ifwhat_to_say_next/,If/What to say next?,"A few (6-7) years ago when I (25m) had a valued friend (24f) when we both still went to the same classes/the same school.

We were always really different people, I'm quite introverted and stayed home most of the time. She'd be very outgoing, working alongside school, hanging out with lots of people.
We'd talk a lot via instant messenger often about things going on in her life or something I'd be helping her with school stuff or just really random things.
At some point, she had to leave the school, the reasons for I won't share here and we'd still be fine for a while.
At the time her boyfriend disapproved of any contact of her's with any males.
Since she didn't want to lose me I essentially became a pretend female classmate of hers such that we could still be in touch.
At some point she even wrote that we'd be friends for life.

But even few months earlier, essentially since we didn't go to the same classes anymore which was like for a year or so earlier, I was scared of losing our connection, our friendship.
I don't remember the exact details but at some point she'd just reach out less and less with me via text. I was always kind of lonely, still am, typically I had had like one person I'd really call a friend at the time. So I reached out, acting out of fear of losing her, bringing that up. Which made her uncomfortable, every time I did. I realize now how stupid it was of me to not stop at the time. I shouldn't have let my anxiety get the best of me.

We would have less and less contact and at the end of 2018, I kind of exploded sending her a video of me crying and saying some things I shouldn't have said. To say the least, she was very uncomfortable after that, understanably so, of course I immediately apologized but the damage was done.
After some weeks I stopped reaching out because we kind of agreed there was nothing left for me to say or do to make things right. This was now almost six years ago.

A few months ago, I reached out to her via Instagram as she had reached out to me asking what I was doing in 2022. 
She replied and asked if we could grab a coffee sometime.
Well the first attempt fell through and the second attempt like a month later fell through as well as she would rather clean her place.
Which the first time didn't hurt as she told me so in advance. 
The second time, well we didn't make a time or place to meet but said we could meet on day X. After I reached out if she'd still want to get together that day she said that she was cleaning her place. We kind of miscommunicated here. I thought our meeting was more planned as she thought but no big deal.

Well, I have acted idiotically in hindsight over the last few weeks/months.
I should mention that I have been dealing with anxiety since I was a young kid and still do. Anyways, I reached out way too much and way too often over the course of August and September.
I'd ask how she was doing, how her vacation was, sent her memes or pictures from my day. Often times I'd get no response which I shouldn't have ignored but I did...
I will admit I became way to obsessed because I had basically way too much free time between my uni exams in August and September.

One and a half weeks ago, she blocked me on Instagram. Three days later I contacted her via another messenger since she had given me her number after my asking for it in July.
I asked if everything was alright between us and if she needed space.

And yes she said needed space. I deleted the texts but she told me I needed way too much attention which I agree is how it must have seemed to her. She also said that my too quickly liking of every of there Insta stories and me removing basically all my follows except my mom, her friend, her and non-people accounts made her very uncomfortable. And I can totally see that. It was stupid and I feel sorry. I can even see that I self sabotaged myself.
I would even go a step further than she did and would say some of the things I wrote her were meant nicely but were giving way too much unwanted attention. I'm really sorry for how I acted.

I feel like I messed up my attempts
 to try to connect a little totally by simply trying too much and too hard.
I guess back then I already kind of knew that I wouldn't want to lose that connection we had back then, even though I have years ago.

I haven't sent her any message since she wrote me the reasons for her blocking me to respect her wish for distance.

I have been thinking of apologizing beyond my initial apologetic question why she blocked me in like a month from now.

One thing, beyond responding distant or not responding at all, she never said anything that I was annoying her or that I bothered her. If so I would have, of course, immediately stopped.
Probably my loneliness got the best of me and I overshared and was too clingy/annoying.

I could use some advice, tell me if I shouldn't reach out. Do something else. Or simply try to let go without writing another word. Or anything else.

TLDR: I (25m) reached out to an old former friend (24f) after years of practically no contact. She wanted to grab a coffee sometime but we didn't really find the time. I acted like a moron and reached out way too much and annoyed her to the point where she blocked me on Instagram but I could still reach her otherwise.",1,1728233700.0,lostafriend,0,1.0,False

In videos, desi mixer/grinders seem more powerful and handle a wider range of textures.

**TLDR**: What are US-based NRI's minimal (not-too-many-appliances) solutions for: 
* non-gritty coconut-based curries 
* grinding spices finely, especially when the masale have dry and fried components.

**Details/Context**:

I am not Indian but my friends are. They don't cook extensively. So I have plenty of people who can tell me a dish tastes wrong, but not many with ideas for improvement.

I currently have 4(! D:) appliances: 

* Blender: Vitamix S30, 790W. Works for pur√©eing wet things but can't handle coconut or too little liquid.
* Mini Cuisinart food processor: works ok for chutney but struggles with coconut or hard/whole spices.
* Spice grinder: a glorified coffee grinder. Can't use for wet things (eg fried spices), and has trouble grind hard spices like cinnamon into a true power. Small, and a pain to clean (can't get it wet).
* Immersion blender

It seems like Indian mixies have a one-size-fits-all approach and can handle mixtures of dry spices, spices fried in oil, and hard things like coconut.

Here are some options I've considered:

1. Upgrade my vitamix: other mixers have 2x more horsepower and some have dry mixer containers. These are very expensive, and reviews for the dry mixer part are mixed.

2. Import mixie from India and use step-up transformer to convert voltages: Won't work. Current at 220V will be half of what it expects and so motor's torque will be halved. 

3. Get Indian mixie rated for 110V, like: https://a.co/d/bolDw8u Reviews are mixed; some say it doesn't work as well as in-India version. 

4. Spice grinder with removable containers: I was going to get this https://a.co/d/jbo4bIt, but tried my parent's and it works worse than mine.

5. Manual labor: Get a big mortar/pestle or grinding stone and get to work. 

6. Change coconut strategies. I currently use

* bags of ground frozen ""fresh"" coconut from the local Indian store 
* pre-chopped hunks of coconut from Whole Foods.

Some things I've wondered:
* Are, e.g., konkani curry recipes using a softer form of coconut that blend easier than the very thick and hard fleshed kind I can buy?
* Would scraping fresh coconut by hand change the consistency into something that will blend better?

Ever thought about how boring life would be if we knew exactly what was coming next? I mean, imagine waking up every morning knowing precisely how your day would unfold. Sounds pretty dull, right? That's exactly what Eleanor Roosevelt was getting at when she said that predictable life would lose its flavor.

Think about it. Those unexpected twists and turns in our daily lives are what keep things interesting. It's like adding spices to a dish ‚Äì sure, you could have plain chicken every day, but throw in some paprika or cumin, and suddenly you're on a culinary adventure. Life works the same way. Those surprise phone calls from old friends, stumbling upon a new favorite coffee shop, or even getting caught in an impromptu rainstorm ‚Äì they all add a dash of excitement to our routines.

But it's not just about the fun surprises. Sometimes life throws us curveballs that seem tough at first. Maybe it's a job loss or a relationship ending. In the moment, these can feel devastating. But you know what? Often, these unexpected changes push us to grow, to discover strengths we didn't know we had. They force us to adapt and evolve, making our lives richer and more complex ‚Äì like a fine wine aging over time.

Consider how predictability might affect our relationships. If we always knew what our partners, friends, or family members were going to say or do, where's the spark? The joy of getting to know someone, of being surprised by their thoughts and actions, would vanish. It's the unpredictable nature of human interaction that keeps our connections fresh and exciting.

Now, I'm not saying we should throw caution to the wind and live recklessly. Having some stability and routine is important for our mental health and productivity. But within that framework, leaving room for the unexpected allows us to experience life in full color. It's about finding that sweet spot between structure and spontaneity.

So next time you're feeling stuck in a rut or wishing you could see into the future, remember Eleanor's words. Embrace the unknown. Say yes to new experiences. Take that leap of faith. Because in the end, it's those unpredictable moments that will make your life story worth telling. They're the secret ingredients that give your life its unique and unforgettable flavor.

## Eleanor Roosevelt 

born on October 11, 1884, in New York City, was the niece of President Theodore Roosevelt and became one of the most influential First Ladies of the United States during her husband Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency from 1933 to 1945. Orphaned by age ten, she overcame a challenging childhood to become a prominent advocate for human rights and social justice. After Franklin's death in 1945, she served as a U.S. delegate to the United Nations, where she played a crucial role in drafting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Eleanor continued her activism until her death on November 7, 1962.

My theories:

-recipe calls for buttermilk, but I use heavy cream because I would only use buttermilk for this recipe so it seems like a waste to buy it (I bought it the first two times I made it)

-batter may not be even? It says to pour half of the batter in, then sprinkle cinnamon sugar on, followed by the other half.

As soon as I did it, I felt bad. I was thinking, what if he came back and got angry? But the line was not moving, and I did not want to lose my chance for coffee.

Then he came back a few minutes later, looking confused. He saw me in his spot and raised an eyebrow. I was like this is my spot you left.. but in the same time if he asked me nicely I would just let him. But he started yelling at me how could you take my place bla bla.. I was gone because I wanted to save me a spot at the table.. I really didnt know what to do..

Now I (f) live with my girlfriend in our own 1 bedroom. Life is so much better now that I got away from the 2 roommates I was living with for 2 and a half years.

Piss on the toilet seat every day, multiple times a day, food left out on the counter, coffee left out for days and then reheated like no problem, ants, so many ants... This guy would order a pizza, eat a few slices, then leave the pizza in the box room temp in the kitchen for DAYS... he would go back and eat slices out of it for days after being room temp.

We ran into some landlord issues and were forced out through a no fault eviction. That was a very stressful time for me but now I view it as a blessing in disguise.

 ‚ÄúMight-could.‚Äù I say, chuckling a bit to myself at some of the dialect that has crept into my speech, ‚Äú As long as my boss doesn‚Äôt call me in tomorrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúSon, I have a sneaking suspicion the water heater is going to blow and we‚Äôre sadly going to have to close up for a couple days. This old-hand needs a little vacation from his vacation. ‚Äú Chuck jokes as we leave the store. 

Norm‚Äôs is an odd kind of place. In reality it‚Äôs your generic small town bar. Decent amount of personality, nothing too exciting going on but it‚Äôs trying to go for a chain restaurant kind of look.  

Chuck and I  sit down, and before we manage to strike up a conversation, a pitcher of bud is sitting on the table in front of us. 

‚ÄúThanks Ken!‚Äù I shout to the combination barhand/bouncer. His forearms are covered in scars from his day job at a scrapyard. 

Behind the bar are two women, Casey, a farm-girl around my age working her way through a second run at college . And Alice, probably the only person in this city I can talk to about body art. 

Late forties, ex-cop, and known to lend Ken a hand during the odd dust-up that happens. 

It was nearing ten, that crucial moment in a night of drinking where one needs to decide whether it‚Äôs an early pass-out or a late night. 

‚ÄúI forgot to tell you, did you hear what happened to Leo‚Äôs kid?‚Äù  I question. 

‚ÄúNo, he okay?‚Äù Chuck asks. 

I‚Äôm no where near drunk, but I swear I‚Äôve never seen Chuck get beyond tipsy. He‚Äôs spent half the night catching up and downing drinks with every other old coot in the city and seems just fine. 

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs alive, but man, it was the damndest thing. 

Kid was out on a deer hunt, long-guns , obviously. 

Blows a hand clean off. Nothing Doc Miller could do for it.  

Still up in a hospital near Dallas. It‚Äôs a shame, kid was only 18. ‚Äú  I don‚Äôt know why I chose such a morbid topic, but booze doesn‚Äôt tend to do positive things for the mind. 

Chuck looks stoic, maybe even a bit pissed off. 

‚ÄúWhich hand?‚Äù he asks, deadpan. 

‚ÄúRight. Listen , if I seemed like I was making fun of the kid, I wasn‚Äôt. ‚Äú I reply, trying to smooth over whatever mistake I made. 

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt say anything wrong. ‚Äú Chuck offers as an explanation, but he still has that worried, miserable tone. 

If there is one thing I‚Äôve learned about Chuck , it‚Äôs that when he wants to stop a conversation, it‚Äôs best to listen. 

As weird as it was, after a couple of weeks, I‚Äôd forgotten all about the cloud that passed over chuck that night. Chalking it up to one too many, and a bad choice of topic. 

But one Wednesday in mid September , Chuck didn‚Äôt show up to open the store. Nothing I couldn‚Äôt handle, of course, but not so much as a call. 

It was 11 am and I was nearly drowning in customers. As much as I owe Chuck, I was about thirty minutes away from a pissed off phone call when he came walking in the door. 

‚ÄúHey boss, need you to‚Ä¶‚Äù I start, trying to get Chuck‚Äôs attention. 

He has his hat pulled low, and walks straight by me, closing the ancient door to his office with a little too much gusto. 

It‚Äôs early afternoon by the time I get a second to go back and talk to Chuck. 

The first smell that hits me is sweat, the kind of vinegar  reek that comes only from fear. The second is booze. 

‚ÄúWhat the hell? You‚Äôre day drinking?‚Äù I say, more confused than angry. 

The laminate desk Chuck sits behind is worn with age, it‚Äôs chrome legs, dull and clouded. 

‚ÄúBig Tim got in a car wreck last night. ‚Äú Chuck says, not turning my way. 

‚ÄúYeah, I heard. Is that what has you walking around with a coffee that smells like paint thinner?

He‚Äôs going to be fine, totaled that Firebird of his, but he‚Äôs back home already. ‚Äú I explain. 

‚ÄúI know, went to go see him.‚Äù Chuck says, taking a long swallow of what I‚Äôm guessing is a cup of ¬º coffee and ¬æ booze. 

‚ÄúAt what point do I get let in on the joke here? You're fucking scaring me with this thousand yard stare shit. ‚Äú  Something about the way this granite statue of a man is acting sets the hairs on the back of my neck on end. 

‚ÄúLock the door kid, we need to talk.‚Äù Chuck says , finally looking at me. 

He hasn‚Äôt slept, and there‚Äôs a look of horror in his eyes, no amount of poker-face can hide. 

I do as he asks, and pull up an old, green office chair to his desk. 

‚ÄúYou ever experienced something you can‚Äôt explain? ‚Äú He asks, point blank, almost, wistfully. 

‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôve ever seen bigfoot or anything, but I‚Äôm sure there is some weird shit out there. ‚Äú is my answer. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not talking about something ,off. 

I‚Äôm talking the kind of thing that has you wondering if it ever really happened. ‚Äú Chuck‚Äôs tone is depressed and hopeful all at the same time. 

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt say that I have, you?‚Äù I lead. 

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve got a reefer in your coat, it‚Äôd probably help my cause for you to smoke it. ‚Äú Chuck begins, with a chuckle, ‚Äú What I‚Äôve got to say isn‚Äôt very high on the believability scale. 

Back in my twenties, I was a different man. Bit of a wanderer, bit of a roughneck, but something kept brining me back here. 

Of course, the town was different then, smaller, closer. It was ‚Äô72 and folks around here were breathing a sigh of relief that the swinging sixties had come to an end. 

The town was doing well, except for one thing. Well, one person really. 

Elroy Kinston. 

A town bully, not something that‚Äôs going to happen nowadays. Even out here, you‚Äôve got cameras on you every second of the day. 

But back then, in a little burg like this, one man could cause a lot of misery. 

He was the kind of ornery, vindictive prick who knows how the law works. 

He was ten years or so older than myself, almost a boogeyman growing up.  

He said he was a biker, but he was just an asshole with a crotch-rocket. Never saw the man with a friend let alone a gang. 

Of course the law would get him for things here and there, a couple months for a fight that got out of hand, weekend jail for pushing drugs, but nothing major. 

When it came to real time, Elroy had the devil‚Äôs luck. 

By ‚Äô70 or so, he‚Äôd beaten a manslaughter wrap, and at that point, folks decided to just give the man his space. Better to be cleaning up broken windows, or nursing a black eye than six feet under. 

One night, I found myself at Norm‚Äôs, by my lonesome and looking for some female companionship. 

The night went on and nothing of the sort came my way. 

The bar was full of mining boys, engineers from the quarry. Good guys, but we‚Äôre talking college boys, not miners. Soft men. 

Elroy walked in, and I could smell the bad intentions on him. 

But it‚Äôs a free country, man can drink where he pleases. So I just watched, and drank.

He's got a conman‚Äôs charm and soon enough, he‚Äôs made a couple of friends who are more than happy to buy a few rounds. 

I‚Äôve seen this before. Soon enough Elroy is going to find something to take offence to, and one of these College boys is going to be missing teeth. 

Good sense told me to stay out of it. But something about his smirking, coyote look, got my dander up. 

He steps backward into one of his new friends, I can‚Äôt hear the conversation, but I can see what‚Äôs going to happen. 

As the engineer apologizes, I down my drink. As Elroy starts to shout, I‚Äôm out of my chair. 

I take out my wallet, as Elroy starts to get into the man‚Äôs face. 

I‚Äôve paid for my beer when the engineer is shoved, it catches the five foot seven man totally off guard. He hits the ground on his ass. 

Elroy, he‚Äôs about my size, greasy curled hair, and plenty of yard-bird muscle. 

Well, I inform him that if he intends on a fight that night, it sure as hell isn‚Äôt going to be with the man pissing himself on the floor. 

The situation got tense, but guys like him aren‚Äôt looking for a square fight. He makes some threats and leaves. 

Came at me from an alley on the walk home though. 

I got my bearings quick enough, and it turned into a typical drunken fight. Nothing I hadn‚Äôt been through a dozen times. 

Never been stabbed before though, it was a real hollow, deep pain in my bicep. 

I don‚Äôt remember much in specific, but that knife found it‚Äôs way into it‚Äôs owner‚Äôs chest. 

Elroy hit the ground, a cheap, pawn shop switchblade deep in his ribs. Still alive, but on his way out. 

I could have called the law, hell , could have called an ambulance, but I didn‚Äôt. I wasn‚Äôt going to roll the dice on the rest of my life because of Elroy fucking Kinston. 

So I finished the job, did the world a favor, and buried that son-of-a-bitch ten feet deep where no one would ever find him. ‚Äú

‚ÄúSo you killed a guy?‚Äù I say, shocked.

‚ÄúThought I did. 

The very next day, Elroy was driving that rat-rod of his, down main street, not a mark on him. ‚Äú Chuck looks to me as he talks, trying to judge if I‚Äôm believing him or not, ‚Äú After that, things started happening. It started with fires, accidents, floods. But eventually, turned to folks talking about the kinds of things that belong in a midnight movie. 

No one knew how, or why, no one but me that is. 

I watched for a year as this place turned from unlucky, to god-damned cursed. ‚Äú Chuck pauses, he‚Äôs actually shaking, ‚Äú You think I‚Äôm full of shit don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

‚Äú Real answer? Undecided. 

What do you mean, cursed?‚Äù

‚ÄúEvery town has stories, a couple of odd-ducks who say they‚Äôve seen ghosts, or some preacher who swears he‚Äôs been face to face with old scratch. 

During that year, damn near everyone in Harrington had a story other folks wouldn‚Äôt believe. It was like we were a magnet for all of the darkest things in the world. 

Something had to be done. 

I got 6 of my closest friends and told them everything I knew. One took off upstate, the other 5 and I decided to try our hand at stopping things. 

We did our best to figure out what happened, but back then there was no internet, the world was a much smaller place. All we could find were rumors, tall tales, and wild speculation. And even then, pickings were thin.‚Äù Chuck stops for a second while he drinks more of his ‚Äòcoffee‚Äô.

‚ÄúSlow down with that. 

What did you guys do?‚Äù I say, whether I believe him or not, I‚Äôm interested.

‚ÄúNathan, the sheriff‚Äôs deputy figured he‚Äôd go at him head on. Ski mask, and scattergun in the middle of the night. 

When they found his body, they figured it was a bear.

We knew this problem needed some kind of, what‚Äôs the word?‚Äù  Chuck asks. 

‚ÄúEsoteric?‚Äù I guess. 

‚ÄúSeems close enough.  Esoteric , solution. But we didn‚Äôt have one, we were 5 young men from the middle of nowhere. We had nothing more than grit and the stupidity of youth on our side. 

Another thing that was different back then was how easy it was to get your hands on explosives.  Folks just trusted each other more I guess. Either that or lunatics hadn‚Äôt started abusing the privilege.

So we figured if we couldn‚Äôt find anything, esoteric, we‚Äôd do the next best thing. 

We went in knowing we might not come out. And that was true for all but two of us.  

I saw things at that lunatic‚Äôs shack that still make me wonder if god  has an eye on his children any more. But Kyle and Quint, then gave themselves to turn that place into a crater. 

The man himself was my job. 

Face to face, there was a power about him, a dark fog that hung around Elroy. It made my blood run cold. 

He chased me through the sickly , dying trees, scattering downed branches and brush like it wasn‚Äôt even there. No man can move like he did. 

I lost him somewhere near the tree-line. But saw him again when I got to my truck, leaning against it with one hand. 

Tim and I, we we‚Äôre plan B, there was no plan C. 

In the dead of night, through  leaves, and branches, Tim made the shot. 

The  first barbed,  steel bolt pierced Elroy‚Äôs hand, sticking to the door of the truck.  The second did much of the same to his thigh. 

Elroy tore at his limbs like a trapped wolf, he ripped his hand clean off in about 6 seconds. 

The bundle of TNT I lobbed at his feet had a seven second fuse. 

There was nothing left of Elroy, his house, or my truck. 

We figured that was the end of things. 

Now, I‚Äôm not so sure. ‚Äú Chuck finishes his story, trying to read my reaction. 

‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm definitely not high enough for this. ‚Äú I say.

‚ÄúSo you think I‚Äôm full of shit?‚Äù Chuck accuses. 

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs say I don‚Äôt, for the sake of argument. What does that have to do with what's going on now?‚Äù I ask. 

‚ÄúTim was ran off the road. ‚Äú Chuck says, ‚Äú The man that did it said he had a message from Elroy. 

He says, he‚Äôll be seeing us soon.‚Äù

‚ÄúChuck, I don‚Äôt know if I believe all the paranormal stuff , but by the fact things have you like this, I know you are involved with some bad people. 

I‚Äôve got a record, man. You know this. 

 I can‚Äôt afford to get mixed up in some old-school blood feud going on so long it‚Äôs developed legends. ‚Äú My tone is a mix of shame and anger, ‚Äú And besides, you know me, I‚Äôm not a fighter. If this guy has some brother or friend trying to screw with you, plenty of folks around here would have your back. ‚Äú

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the problem kid, I‚Äôve seen how people in this town react when things start going sideways in a way they can‚Äôt understand. 

But I respect your decision, any way this hand plays out is going to get messy, and you don‚Äôt need any more of that in your life.

If you‚Äôre fixing to leave, I‚Äôve got 5k in cash to help you get the hell away from this place. No hard feelings. ‚Äú Chuck finishes the offer and his coffee at nearly the same time. 


The fact I didn‚Äôt take the money and run was one in a long list of stupid decisions I‚Äôve made in my life. But something inside me made me feel that I owed the old man. If he needed me to hold a baseball bat and try to look scary,  why not? 

So I found myself at Norm‚Äôs , drinking slowly and alone. Trying to make sense of the growing level of strange in my life. 

The answer I found at the bottom of a bottle was as follows:

My friend chuck, has likely been suffering from PTSD for a long time. He‚Äôs taken the event that caused it, mixed it up with a few memories from his time in the service ( I assume. ) and made it into some kind of paranormal event in his mind. 

That being said, scumbag families hold grudges, that goes double in isolated burgs like this. Decades mean nothing. 

Chuck needs help, and for all the dumb things I‚Äôve caught time for, if worst comes to worst, at least this will be for a good cause. 

Riding a good buzz and a moral high, I found myself walking home under the harsh arc lights of main street. 

It was quiet, a little under an hour before last call, the street was calm. It felt like I had the town to myself. 

As many times as I‚Äôve seen the inside of a jail cell, I‚Äôm not a tough guy. When me and the law come into conflict, violence isn‚Äôt the reason. Hell, even on the inside, I got by minding my own business and keeping the right friends. 

So , as I walk I start to think about how I‚Äôm going to go about convincing some inbred criminal to leave my friend alone. 

I‚Äôm on my third inebriated draft of an absolutely terrible scary speech when I hear it. 

It‚Äôs quiet at first, as if off in the distance. A rattling, grinding noise, an engine barely managing to run. 

I look back to see what piece of shit bike was living out it‚Äôs last seconds. Hoping i catch sight of it‚Äôs owner. 

I see nothing at first, then a couple blocks away, the streetlights on either side of the road burst. 

The roaring, decrepit engine suddenly seems much closer, the sound rising almost instantly. 

The next streetlights burst in a spray of broken glass and molten filament, keeping whatever dying conveyance I‚Äôm hearing out of my sight. 

One part of my brain is screaming at me to run, or hide. The other is telling me that I‚Äôm being an idiot and nearly having a heart attack over some faulty wiring that was likely last replaced well before I was born. 

So, for a moment, I stand, indecisive, transfixed. 

I catch a glimpse, for just a fraction of a second right before the next set of lights explode. 

I don‚Äôt see a bike, but I see a dozen or so silhouettes. People clad in black, walking nearly in unison. 

The sound starts to reach window rattling levels, the lights are destroying themselves quicker. Common sense finally takes hold. 

I bolt in the opposite direction as fast as my booze hindered legs will carry me. 

The engine‚Äôs roar brings to mind the scream of something massive, old, and evil. 

I skid to a stop, losing balance, and a decent amount of flesh from my palms as I scramble to get back to my feet. 

About two blocks away, the lights in front of me begin to burst. On either side, pitch black night begins to encroach.  The engine roar hits me in stereo now.  Loud enough to be painful. 

Panic and fear hit me hard enough to threaten consciousness. 

   I don‚Äôt think, I turn right down an alley, seeing some kind of refuge in the dim light from aging scones in the wall. 

As I do, the noise of the engine suddenly cuts off. My ears are ringing, sweat pours from me, drenching my shirt. I try the rusted handles of disused doors to no avail. 

I scream for help, someone has to hear me. 

But then again, someone has to have heard the earth-shaking sound of the engine. Yet no one seems to be investigating. 

No fire escapes, nothing that could be used as a weapon. I feel trapped, and for some reason, small. 

My back is to the wall, and while I can‚Äôt see a damn thing, I can hear footsteps, slow, purposeful footsteps. 

The last set of lights destroy themselves, plunging me into pure darkness. 

Silence, a ringing lack of volume, pregnant with the potential of violence and evil. 

A hiss,  my eyes burn with a sudden brightness, tearing up. It takes me a few seconds to make sense of what, or rather, who, I‚Äôm seeing.

She‚Äôs  a few inches taller than me, her bald head is covered in overlapping layers of scars. Some look purposeful, others like the reminders of brutal fights. 

She holds a road flare, head cocked, one eye slightly clouded and askew. 

The orange light makes the tattered, rusted biker‚Äôs leathers she wears look like the hide of some hell-spawned creature. 

‚ÄúYou Chuck‚Äôs friend?‚Äù she says, her voice is calm, like we just ran into each other at the coffee shop. 

I think about lying, but I figure she wouldn‚Äôt be asking if she didn‚Äôt already know. 

‚ÄúYeah, I am. ‚Äú I try to sound confident, I could spend a page describing how much I failed. 

‚Äú Good‚Äù The woman says, walking toward me, ‚ÄúMy name‚Äôs River, but you can call me, sir. ‚Äú 

She stands inches from me, I can feel the heat of the flare. 

‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù I ask. 

Before I realize it the woman has me by the throat, nails filed to wicked points dig into my neck hard enough to draw blood. I try to get away, she‚Äôs tall, but rail thin. Somehow though, her grip is immovable. 

She pokes my chest with the flare, just a brief fraction of a second of contact, but the pain is bad enough I drench her arm in vomit. 

Disgusted she easily throws me into the opposite wall. I hear the action of a switchblade and see her holding a wicked, serrated blade as she stalks toward my prone form. 

‚ÄúYou fucking deaf, or stupid?‚Äù she demands, ‚Äú Try that again.‚Äù

I pat out the smoldering fabric of my shirt, river wipes her sleeve on my head, studs and chains tearing out chunks of hair. 

‚ÄúWhat did you want, sir?‚Äù I say, trying to stand, every muscle screaming in pain. 

‚ÄúThere you go. 

What I want, is for you to get a message to Chuck. 

Elroy is giving him 7 days to get his shit in order. Then things get interesting. ‚Äú  River shows disgust when she talks about Chuck. 

Fighter or not, I decide to swing for the fences and run for the hills. My fist isn‚Äôt even half way cocked backward before River casually has the knife a quarter inch from my eye. 

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt. ‚Äú She says, bluntly, ‚Äú See, I‚Äôm a real forgiving type. Being nice, it‚Äôs just in my nature. 

But, the boss? He doesn‚Äôt really, let things go. ‚Äú 

As she talks, she moves the knife upward, drawing my gaze to the night sky. 

As the flare goes out, in the gloom, and scant starlight, I see it. 

It‚Äôs barely visible, an ethereal, suggestion of a massive, twisted human form. A wicked thing, floating above the assembled, leather clad people like an evil miasma. 

I can‚Äôt see eyes, I‚Äôm not even sure I can see the thing itself, but I can feel it looking at me. 

  I can‚Äôt do anything but shut my eyes against the sanity straining horror in front of me. I expect my throat to be cut, or my heart to be pierced at any second. 

But the death blow never comes. When I finally muster the courage to open my eyes, I‚Äôm alone. The street is lit, and if it wasn‚Äôt for the fact I‚Äôve been beaten and burned to hell, I might think it was all just some kind of hallucination. 

But the blistered, weeping wound in my chest isn‚Äôt a hallucination. And I know, neither was that thing that was herding River and her friends. 

I feel like a spec of dust caught up in a tornado. And when I finally make it to Chuck‚Äôs house, body screaming for rest and medical attention, the old man is waiting as if expecting me. 

‚Äú We‚Äôve got a week.‚Äù I say grimly. 

‚ÄúWe drinking ourselves to death, or trying to figure out the mysteries of the universe in a week?‚Äù Chuck asks. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the boss. ‚Äú I say,  figuring both options will amount to the same in the end.

1fxkr36,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1fxkr36/ssv_wont_leave_me_alone/,SSV won‚Äôt leave me alone,"(Three trenta pink drinks with no ice sized rant and format will be terrible since I‚Äôm on mobile) 
So, I‚Äôm a barista trainer, still fairly new to the training world as I‚Äôve only been training since mid June but I‚Äôve already had 5 trainees. I did the training with my SM and did the little tests and such and got the green light so my SM started scheduling me to train. It‚Äôs been going great! It‚Äôs exhausting but I really like training because I like being a new partner‚Äôs first comfort zone and watching them get better even after a few days. 

But there‚Äôs one catch. There‚Äôs this one SSV who is extremely controlling and thinks she‚Äôs incredibly standard and right all the time (even though she constantly breaks standard and it‚Äôs okay when she does it) who will not leave me alone to train. When my trainee has done the modules for the day and we‚Äôre getting ready to come on the floor she‚Äôs barking ‚Äúwhat are you doing today?? But like what‚Äôs going on how long is it going to take???‚Äù Like she wants me to give her a plan by the minute of what I‚Äôm going to be doing exactly. None of my other SSV‚Äôs are like that and when I let them know ‚Äúhey we‚Äôre doing custy support today so leave a couple whips and sweet creams for us to make‚Äù they just say ‚Äúsounds good let me know if you need anything!‚Äù And I do if I need something. I‚Äôm not sure if all my other SSV‚Äôs are just way out of standard but it‚Äôs really jarring when she‚Äôs crawling in my skin for a training plan down to the hour. 

The reason for this post happened last week. My current trainee was on his second day so we were doing the ‚Äúfoundations‚Äù block of the training schedule. It includes deployment positions, a safety basics activity, a customer support activity, and customer support practice. The only module on the iPad is for deployment positions. So my barista duckling (because trainee‚Äôs follow so close behind üòÇ) finished his module and was ready to start his day. We talked about the module, I explained what we were gonna be doing today and what the position means, I showed him the cycle card and gave it to him so he could look at it throughout our day, and decided that we were ready to go on the floor. 

So we walk out and my SSV starts with her usual what are you doing what are you doing so I say ‚Äúwe‚Äôre training on customer support today so we‚Äôre going to start with a lobby slide then a really long customer support cycle and just see what all of that entails‚Äù and she goes ‚Äú‚Ä¶(SM) say that you were doing an activity‚Äù so I said ‚Äúyes, this is the activity. It‚Äôs all hands on stuff showing the ropes and doing a customer support cycle before we do it to a timer.‚Äù And she gets mad and breathes in a huge breath and like, slaps her thighs. She‚Äôs always complaining about how ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no communication‚Äù but I think she just hadn‚Äôt trained in so long that she didn‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like now. They just recently changed all the training, like within the past month and I know it changed in the years since she‚Äôs been a trainer. So she turns to my duckling and she starts interrogating him and is like ‚Äúdid you do the modules?? What did you learn?‚Äù And he‚Äôs put on the spot so he kind of stutters through his answer about staying in your deployed positions and what positions there are. Then she turns back to me and says ‚Äúsee, this is why we need to be really thorough in the training before coming on the floor because we don‚Äôt want to be stuttering we want to be confident‚Äù now I‚Äôm a very non confrontational person and I was SHOCKED. That she would be saying this in front of someone let alone an extremely new person who is barely starting their training. Next she rips the iPad out of my hands and starts telling me how to do the activity and gets about as far as ‚ÄúI‚Äôd start with the brewer and then go into a lobby slide‚Äù when I interrupt ‚Äúyes that‚Äôs what I was going to do except in the activity it says if you have a clover vertica to skip the brewing step and go straight into a lobby slide.‚Äù And finally admitting defeat she shoves the iPad back at me and says ‚Äúoh yea I guess I was still thinking about the bunn brewer I haven‚Äôt trained in a while‚Äù 

So me and my traumatized duckling get into it and the day is filled with the SSV coaching me on what to do and how to do things like I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing. We‚Äôre in the second half of our day when the next offense happens. My trainee and I are learning how to do backups and I realize I forgot 1 box of strawberry a√ßa√≠ when we had done our BOH haul so I tell him to stay and finish what he‚Äôs doing and I‚Äôll be right back. I go grab a strawberry base and when I turn around, my SSV has cornered me in the back and is like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry if it seems like I‚Äôm frustrated with you. I‚Äôm not. It‚Äôs not your fault you weren‚Äôt trained properly when you did your trainer training.‚Äù And to not make waves I just stood there and took it until she was done ranting at me about how I‚Äôm not doing my job correctly and my SM isn‚Äôt good at her job either because I was apparently not trained properly. One of the other SSV‚Äôs who I‚Äôm cool/close with since we close together almost every night saw her corner me but didn‚Äôt hear the conversation. The day finishes and I‚Äôm filled with anger. I‚Äôm angry that she coached me constantly in front of my trainee over nitpicky stuff, instilling doubt in him in me as his trainer, I‚Äôm mad that she said I‚Äôm not good at my job but it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot my fault‚Äù and I‚Äôm most mad that she insulted my trainee to his face on his second day in a new place. He‚Äôs 22 so a lot of things still get taken to heart. I‚Äôm 23 and I‚Äôm just now embodying the let it roll off mentality. 

So when I get home I send my SM an 11 minute long voice message about everything that happened. I ask her not to talk to the SSV about it right now since I had to close with her that coming Saturday and didn‚Äôt want it to be awkward. Let‚Äôs skip forward. It‚Äôs now Tuesday of this week and my SSV and my SM are both there and while my trainee does his modules I‚Äôm looking at the activity stuff for the day. Then I see the SSV and SM go outside and talk for 30 minutes so I‚Äôm like oh it‚Äôs happening today. When they come back in they‚Äôre laughing like old friends because they‚Äôre both very fake. But that‚Äôs beside the point. When my trainee and I get on the floor this SSV finally leaves me alone now. It was great. Stellar day training and I finally felt comfortable to just do what I do. Once I was done training and my trainee had gone home, my SM pulled me aside to let me know that she talked to the SSV and wanted to know how the day went. I happily told her it went a lot better and I felt a lot more comfortable because I wasn‚Äôt being hounded all day. She expresses that she‚Äôs happy it‚Äôs feeling better and then asks ‚ÄúI just wanted to make sure, but are you comfortable training? Do you feel confident?‚Äù And I said ‚Äúyes? Do you think I‚Äôm struggling?‚Äù And she says ‚Äúokay I just wanted to make sure. No I think you‚Äôre doing a great job but when I asked (SSV) about the you not being trained right thing she said omg I never said that. (OP) actually came to me and confided that they weren‚Äôt confident in the way they were trained and they were struggling.‚Äù Which is a BOLD FACED LIE. Why would I confide in you that I‚Äôm struggling and not confident in how I train and then go to my SM and lie about it? My SM believed me but said she wanted to make sure just in case. 

So this Saturday (yesterday) I had to close with her for the first time since this all happened. It felt like I was being retaliated against. I was walking back from the bathroom before my shift and the SSV goes ‚Äú(OP) are you on the floor???‚Äù And when I said ‚Äúno I was just going to the bathroom‚Äùshe was like ‚Äúif you‚Äôre not on the clock I can‚Äôt have you on the floor‚Äù so am I just not allowed to come out of the back now if I‚Äôm off the clock cause she‚Äôs mad at me? I guess. Then I got told to stay planted in the drive thru when I flexed to make a drip coffee because we were in a 2 person play so I became the worlds biggest drive thru princess. And the last thing I was coached for that was ridiculous was my coworker was making whips and then had to go help someone up front so I went to lid and charge the whips and she made me stop because ‚Äúthat‚Äôs (coworker)‚Äòs task not yours‚Äù like when ever has someone not been allowed to finish a backup. Idk I‚Äôm just regretting allowing my SM to talk to her because it didn‚Äôt change the SSV‚Äôs mindset, just made her mad at me. 

So sorry for the novel sized story, I just needed to get it off my chest to people who don‚Äôt have any involvement. If I am in the wrong please let me know but I don‚Äôt think I am. I‚Äôve talked to a couple of the closers and my mom and everyone agrees that the SSV is being ridiculous. If anyone actually reads this thank you! ",1,1728232905.0,starbucksbaristas,2,0.66,False

1fxklux,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fxklux,Unfortunate floorplan. I am looking for ideas to gut and remodel.,"Have been renting this house for almost 5 years and we are about to close on buying it. Love the house but it does need lots of work. It's livable. The kitchen is the bane of my existence though. I hate cooking but obviously do but the lack of storage and counter space makes it stressful for me. The lazy Susan is disgusting and we don't open that cupboard lol. Despite the 2 windows, it's dark in here which is ok with me, I don't like much light, I enjoy the darkness lol, so lots of light fixtures are not necessary. The window closest to the front door is also completely useless. Husband and I agree, we'd probably get rid of it or at a minimum make it smaller so it matches the over-the-sink one. The thing is I need as much counter and storage as possible. I use the instant pot constantly because I cook for my dogs but I would like it out of the way so maybe have it sit by the larger window if we just make it smaller so there can be counter? Microwave will either be ON counter with instant pot (absolutely no parking garages or built ins for it) or stays where it is now but gets an ""accent"" cabinet (most likely). I would also like a custom coffee bar that is counter height (where the buffet sits now) and the water dispenser would sit there too. The biggest issue with this kitchen is that window and the fact the brand new fridge we just bought can't really go anywhere else besides the main wall unless maybe where the stove is now but then the counter space there has to go and that's not convenient for a bunch of reasons. What would it look like if the fridge has counter next to it on BOTH sides? Would that look dumb? The other important thing is we need a space for coats, shoes, keys, etc. I would like something like a bench with storage and coat hanger). Right now it's a mess. See last 3 pics for ideas. Space is so limited though and I have a hard time visualizing. Any ideas are much appreciated and I look forward to what ya'll got! Thank you!",2,1728232517.0,kitchenremodel,0,1.0,False

Help?,"I (25F) went on a first date with a guy (29M) last weekend. We chatted for a few days before that, then had good conversation and decided to get coffee. He seems really sweet, and I had a great time with him but I'm feeling a bit suspicious. Since we had a nice time, I saw him again the next day to grab lunch, and earlier this week we met again to play pool and hangout. I told him it's important for me to move at a very slow pace, and he was okay with this. He kissed me goodnight for the first time on our third date playing pool, which I was also okay with. By the third date, we had been talking for a week.

These are some signs I've seen though that I'm feeling off about. I haven't really dated much, so I'm not sure if this is expected early-on in dating? I was hoping to get some opinions and other perspectives.

* After the third date, which at that point, we've been chatting for just about a week--he brought up exclusivity. He told me that I'm the only woman he's entertaining and he's just into me, which I was okay with. I told him I only really date one person at a time anyways, so I'm fine with that, but I re-emphasized that I don't want to rush into any sort of commitment without really getting to know each other. He said that's fine with him, as long as he knows that ""I'm his"" and ""only his."" It felt a bit soon for that, I told him I didn't want to rush into any commitment and even though commitment hasn't been officially declared, it feels like there's some kind of expectation attached now? He mentioned he's been cheated on in the past so I'm not sure if maybe he's just insecure.
* There's some signs of slight jealousy already I think. He plays it off in a cute way, like ""oh, you talk to a lot of those guys at the gym?"" or flirty comments like that. I didn't really think anything of it, until we had a conversation about men and women being friends. I told him I believe men and women can be friends, and I have guy friends in my life. He strongly disagreed, and told me men just want one thing and one thing only. He told me that he only talks to women with two goals in mind, either a romantic goal to start a long-term relationship if there's long-term potential, or a sexual goal (he said he had more of a sexual goal in his early 20s, and he's looking for something serious now.) I'm okay with differing views, but this kind of rubbed me the wrong way. It feels like he's just boxing women into a goal for him and there's not anything more to them, and that's why they wouldn't have anything to offer in friendship. It made me wonder how he views me, if I'm just some sort of goal.
* He already started with pet names a week in. ""Baby, babe, hun, etc."" He doesn't know me well enough yet at all, but he's calling me pet names and wanting me to only be his. He can just really be into me and excited, but calling someone pet names so soon just concerns me that it's not sincere. He was texting me good morning beautiful since the second chat we had, and since the first date.
* He was giving me more insight into how he was in his early 20s. He had one 7 year long relationship starting in high school, and another 1 year long relationship more recently, but during the few years he was single in his 20s, he said he ""knew exactly what to say to women to eventually get what he wanted"" and that ""a lot of it was similar to what he tells me, wanting a relationship and all, but the difference is he was young and he wouldn't mean any of it."" And explained that now that he's older, he knows what he wants and wants to settle down--and that just messing around doesn't mean anything to him anymore. I get it... I guess, but how do I know he isn't just telling me what I want to hear if he was once capable of manipulating other women that way?

That's pretty much the rundown of it. Don't get me wrong, there's also been positives, otherwise I would've just completely cut the chord already. He has been understanding with me and has reiterated to me that he'll be patient for whatever I need because I was honest with him that my last relationship ended pretty badly and that I need time to really build trust and vulnerability with someone. He's been very kind, and has made me laugh a lot. We have some things in common, like video games and martial arts, so it's been nice sharing in those together. We've had a lot of conversations even just texting where we can talk a lot and conversation flows easily. Aside from those signs I've listed out, he seems like a nice guy and has treated me with respect--and has been receptive to anything I've told him as far as what I need. So I'm not really sure how I feel about all of this, something in me is feeling a ton of caution and suspicion, and another part of me is wondering if that's more because of myself and if I should just go with it.",1,1728232318.0,dating,4,1.0,False

The K√ºrbisfest was very crowded this year, but we were a small group in comparison. 
5 people and 2 dogs. We saw everything there was to see. 
And we went afterwards to a coffee place nearby. 
Luck was on our side and we got a table rather quickly.
It was not to loud for conversations and topics ranging from smalltalk to the end and beginning of the universe were discussed.

I hope everybody was enjoying the time as I did.

Still not sure how to make it a permanent thing.

Help?,"I (25F) went on a first date with a guy (29M) last weekend. We chatted for a few days before that, then had good conversation and decided to get coffee. He seems really sweet, and I had a great time with him but I'm feeling a bit suspicious. Since we had a nice time, I saw him again the next day to grab lunch, and earlier this week we met again to play pool and hangout. I told him it's important for me to move at a very slow pace, and he was okay with this. He kissed me goodnight for the first time on our third date playing pool, which I was also okay with. By the third date, we had been talking for a week.

These are some signs I've seen though that I'm feeling off about. I haven't really dated much, so I'm not sure if this is expected early-on in dating? I was hoping to get some opinions and other perspectives.

* After the third date, which at that point, we've been chatting for just about a week--he brought up exclusivity. He told me that I'm the only woman he's entertaining and he's just into me, which I was okay with. I told him I only really date one person at a time anyways, so I'm fine with that, but I re-emphasized that I don't want to rush into any sort of commitment without really getting to know each other. He said that's fine with him, as long as he knows that ""I'm his"" and ""only his."" It felt a bit soon for that, I told him I didn't want to rush into any commitment and even though commitment hasn't been officially declared, it feels like there's some kind of expectation attached now? He mentioned he's been cheated on in the past so I'm not sure if maybe he's just insecure.
* There's some signs of slight jealousy already I think. He plays it off in a cute way, like ""oh, you talk to a lot of those guys at the gym?"" or flirty comments like that. I didn't really think anything of it, until we had a conversation about men and women being friends. I told him I believe men and women can be friends, and I have guy friends in my life. He strongly disagreed, and told me men just want one thing and one thing only. He told me that he only talks to women with two goals in mind, either a romantic goal to start a long-term relationship if there's long-term potential, or a sexual goal (he said he had more of a sexual goal in his early 20s, and he's looking for something serious now.) I'm okay with differing views, but this kind of rubbed me the wrong way. It feels like he's just boxing women into a goal for him and there's not anything more to them, and that's why they wouldn't have anything to offer in friendship. It made me wonder how he views me, if I'm just some sort of goal.
* He already started with pet names a week in. ""Baby, babe, hun, etc."" He doesn't know me well enough yet at all, but he's calling me pet names and wanting me to only be his. He can just really be into me and excited, but calling someone pet names so soon just concerns me that it's not sincere. He was texting me good morning beautiful since the second chat we had, and since the first date.
* He was giving me more insight into how he was in his early 20s. He had one 7 year long relationship starting in high school, and another 1 year long relationship more recently, but during the few years he was single in his 20s, he said he ""knew exactly what to say to women to eventually get what he wanted"" and that ""a lot of it was similar to what he tells me, wanting a relationship and all, but the difference is he was young and he wouldn't mean any of it."" And explained that now that he's older, he knows what he wants and wants to settle down--and that just messing around doesn't mean anything to him anymore. I get it... I guess, but how do I know he isn't just telling me what I want to hear if he was once capable of manipulating other women that way?

That's pretty much the rundown of it. Don't get me wrong, there's also been positives, otherwise I would've just completely cut the chord already. He has been understanding with me and has reiterated to me that he'll be patient for whatever I need because I was honest with him that my last relationship ended pretty badly and that I need time to really build trust and vulnerability with someone. He's been very kind, and has made me laugh a lot. We have some things in common, like video games and martial arts, so it's been nice sharing in those together. We've had a lot of conversations even just texting where we can talk a lot and conversation flows easily. Aside from those signs I've listed out, he seems like a nice guy and has treated me with respect--and has been receptive to anything I've told him as far as what I need. So I'm not really sure how I feel about all of this, something in me is feeling a ton of caution and suspicion, and another part of me is wondering if that's more because of myself and if I should just go with it.",1,1728231723.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

I was going out with this girl who was my college junior for one month as friends. We met in our current company only for the first time. Then we will go for coffee, comedy shows & pizza, momos and have burger together.

We also went together to a pub and came back to my place. We were both drunk and I kind of cuddled her respectfully (which I am not proud of), at first she removed my hand once and then went on with it me placing my hand on her stomach. 

She came back to my home one day later for 2 hrs & now, I started LIKING her (she has same eyes as of my ex) and kind of started wanting more. 

She went home after that and we only talked when I pinged first. One time she told me not to talk to her because her mood was really bad which kind of offended me and decided not to ping her again on that platform until a ping comes from that side.

She called me after that for some reason and then I asked, is everything okay between us to which said YES (haan mujhe koi problem nahi hai)  I needed to ask this because I was kind of ashamed of my things done on that night.

My feelings started to take over and I became desperate. She came back and put on a story with a book that I gave her. When I asked why didn't you told me that you are back to which she answered her parents are with her that's why. 

One day she called me tu instead of tum and the same day I asked her for a DATE which she said no and it seemed like she had a bad history in relationships. 

After that we see each other stories and don't communicate. It's been approx a month. One time she put a note on insta which said ""waffles?ü§ì"" Which I didn't responded thinking it was not for me. 

She is constantly in my mind and I kind of don't want to let her go. What's going on in her mind? What should I do next? Should I wait for her or should I let it go? pls advise me an action that doesn't make me a creep and desperate...

TLDR: I asked this girl for a date after going out a friend for a month, she said no. It's been a month and I don't want to loose her, should I ping her again? ",1,1728231693.0,self,0,1.0,False

So i break up","I'm a guy who was extrovert and had a big friends group, had 1-2 weekly parties, had the habit of alcohol (quit) and smoking(working on it). I travelled to delhi for my higher studies after graduation and 1 year of hectic work environment and hookup culture in my previous place(Hyderabad). After re entering into student life the parties and hookups intensified and was also the centre of the friends group of 10 people, always partying and trip and all that. I was studious from the beginning and was pretty much getting really good grades. Our class had 300 students and was in a casual relationship with one of my classmates that's when i was introduced to a girl from my hometown and something clicked in my heart, we started to get close as friends but never crossed the limit of formalities. The casual relationship lasted about a month and we went back to being friends. Thats when i asked the hometown girl(RK) for coffee (not for relationship but as a friend) and she accepted. We had a good talk but that's when i got to know that she was in a long distance relationship from her graduation. I didn't think much about it. few days goes by, she askes me to explain something from our subjects so i asked her to come to our flat as there was no where else to comfortably sit and study nearby our area. She asked her boyfriend, he was sceptical and hesitant to allow but followed through with a condition that another of her friend tags along, i didn't mind at the moment. They came and studied for a good 1.5 hours , that's when he facetimed her and asked her to show everything around, we were in the hall sitting on chair and sofa opposite of eachother. Nothing happened for a few minutes of the video call but he suddenly started to accuse her that he gave permission to test her and she failed and this was considered cheating and all that stuff. So I explained that the subject we were studying was tough for all except me as i had studied it in my graduation( tried to calm the situation). Few days later(FDL) she and her friend called asking for help to shift to a flat near my flat.  I accepted and helped. We became good friends. FDL her relationship was in turmoil as he was asking her to quit her studies to marriage or just let go of the relationship, she was ready for the marriage but then he dropped the bomb that his parents have already seen a girl for him and he is going to marry her instead, she was shattered. Me and her friend tried to calm her down, console her and cheer her up... A month went by, our friendship grew and also her resentment too towards her ex and kissed me. I thought it was the sadness pent up in her. I went ahead without thinking much but i cleared her from the beginning that it would be nothing for long run, and she should to some time to think about it but she was reluctant. everything happened, another month went by, she started to have feelings for me that I didn't want. But she finally expressed. I didn't jump to anything and calmly explained that we were complete opposites, have only the language in common and my habits, hookup, caste and no future together. She started persuading, i didn't want to be a rebound of anyone so i said to stay far for a month and think it over properly. That time came and her mind was firmly made up, i buckled, i had a crush on her from the beginning. (Idk if its still considered rebound). We started the relationship but my friends circle and her didn't have anything in common, so had to give both of them separately time, had the happiest time of my last 3 year in the first year of relationship and then the real story began.
__________________________________________
Her ex started calling and texting her ( he was already married). Harassing her, calling names, etc etc but she was scared when he said he had photos of them together, both of our stomach dropped, he continued to say he would send them to her parents if she didn't talk to him and if she gets into any other relationships. 
I asked her to clarify what kind of photos he was talking but was relieved to know none of them were intimate, and were just selfies together of those time. I strongly urged her to give a police complaint. But she didn't, saying she was scared, i told her to block him and she did but the harrasment didn't stop, the called and sent text from different numbers everytime. And once i picked up the phone and hit him hard in the face with reality and warned him if he continued, it won't be good for his future. That stopped for 2 years. 
______________________________________________
I have a best friend (girl)-MP my from my 10th class. She had a crush on me since graduation but i was in relationship, hence she didn't approach me ever and she moved on while being really close friends even now, my GF stared to argue with me that i should talk to her less now that i was in a relationship and i should maintain a distance from girls and be loyal.
That hit like a train, ""loyal"", after we stared our relationship i completely 180ed from a partying hookup guy from doing nothing but be with you!... From then everything started going downhill, I firmly explained to her that I'll be maintaining appropriate distance with all the girls but will continue my friendship with MP. That was not digestible to RK(GF). I didn't buckle and stood firm. Had a long argument with her, and kept my distance for 3-4 days for her to think properly. The real hell began from later.
She agreed. Everytime i had any casual/formal talks with any girl except MP was a spark for arguement and fights for hours/days long, i was fed up of it. 6 months passed by. Its not that we were not Happy, i was , i tried my best to keep her happy too, and she was. But these arguments and fights were at a breaking point. It clicked then to me, the relationship was getting toxic and everything was being blamed on me everytime. I had enough. The next fight i made it clear to go our separate ways from our 2 year relationship. She started crying... It turned into emotional blackmail about off-ing herself and went back to begging to be with me. I clearly defined the boundaries that she shouldn't cross, that boundary didn't stand for long... The torture started again in 2 months... Our post graduation was completed, I cleared a state PCS while in college and had a goal for UPSC and she did too. So all this relationship turmoil was messing with my head, i was exhausted all the time, started having short fuse, I gave her a final warning to stop the blames, doubts, and tortue. I know I'm loyal, my friends know I'm loyal, yet she was oblivious?? I was having a really hard time proving myself to this relationship. I never doubted her loyalty, I never checked her phone, but she did that constantly, i let her, so that she would trust me more, even after 2 years of relationship she had no trust?
What is a relationship without trust?
I gave up. I sat her down, explained her that i was exhausted proving myself over and over, I'm sick of it, and I'm not going to anymore.
If she doesn't trust me, its her problem from now on, if she want out, OK, but she agreed to trust me. I was on a breaking point so she was walking on egg shells around me, not to set me off, i can see how hard she was trying to make this relationship work. So i thought to loosen up a bit after 1 month. Now its been 2.5 years since our relationship. Everything was going smoothly for 5 months, we were happy again, few arguments and fights here and there but who doesn't in a relationship? 
I thought everything was good but last month was a nightmare... After 3rd anniversary of our relationship, she told me crying that her first ex texted her(not the freak from earlier). He too was preparing for UPSC and about exams, etc etc,. I thought it was a one time text and consoled her that its alright to text about studies and stuff but make a clear boundary that he shouldn't cross from the beginning. Than she hit me with, we were chatting for 40 days but was afraid to tell me.
WTH, i broke my back to build trust in this relationship and you were texting your ex for 40 days and didn't tell me?.. i tried grabbing her phone but she had already deleted the chat. I was furious. That was it for me. She went to home 30 days ago... Started texting him 10 days before that... Missed the connecting train in the city where he stayed. Everything connected in a flash in my head.
I feel like i lost everything & i wasted 3 years of my time. I had already convinced my parents about her. All my friends knew our relationship, now everything was shattering in my head. I went out of my room, and told her to pack her stuff and leave... I roamed the streets of delhi aimless for about 20 hours straight with all those things going around in my head.
She tried calling me, explaining me... But i was out of it... 
She went to her room, i blocked her and changed lock to my room.
3 days later our mutual friend called me and asked to talk to her once with calm mind. He didn't take sides. He said to do my research of what she would explain, and if i was convinced try to forgive her, if not go seperate ways, 2 days later i accepted and agreed to talk, she came running to my room. With all the proofs that she wasn't cheating. I combed through everything, i got the chatlogs from WhatsApp backup, yes they texted, but it was mostly one way texts... 4 texts for him, 1 from her 2 days later was the norm she was doing, she explained why her train was missed and had her friend (girl) from Hyderabad explain.
It was a relief but still it was paining me that she hid it for 40 days. I gave it a deep thought and accepted her back. Just 1 day had passed and her recent ex text her(the freak). I firmly told her to give a police complaint today or I'll handle things in a different way. She did register the complaint. 2 days later the investigating officer called to confirm few key details. We went. IO told me to stay outside as she wanted to discuss the case. I did. But behind my back GF told the IO to not be strict in their action against him, his wife shouldn't know, etc etc. ( it's India, police already don't do a good job on serious crimes here and you are saying to go easy on your ex? Why the concern, after all he has done for this long?). That was my final straw. We came to room, packed her stuff again as she sat dumbfounded as if she didn't know what she did wrong. I explained it to her and broke off everything, sent her to her room. I told MP( best friend) everything and my mom that i broke off. I never cried after 7th class as far as i can remember, even after 3 break ups. It this one was very real and very close to my heart. I couldn't control myself. I lost it and poured my heart out in the call with my mom.
MP called RK and gave her ear full of profanities. Mom called her to explain what had happened.
She was just crying at that point. I know why she said that to the IO. Thats because she is too soft. And people take advantage of that... I was the shield but that day that shield broke from 3 years of ware and tare. I didn't want to break up, the situation was such, she messed up so much in just 1 week that overwhelmed my tolerance and i just broke.
5 days of continuous convincing, begging, crying and staying hungry, i agreed to talk for a final time.
I gave her 2 choices, 
1) stay with me after giving a scar that would remind you every time of what you did wrong untill it heals completely 
Or
2) just walk out of my life

We sat there for 1 hour. Me with my ultimatum. And she without any thoughts.
She went to the washroom. I didn't think much but she drank the washroom cleaner!!!
I immediately made her throw-up, took her to the hospital, doctor filed a complaint (MLC) before he started to even treating her. The police came (i already knew him before), questioned me, 2 of my friends i called, i convinced him that we'll take care of her, I'll take the sole responsibility and requested him to hold off the legal procedure until she was stable... Which took 2 days... I called him and he came to my room where she was normal except she couldn't eat anything solid for the next week but no permanent damage. He questioned her, scolded both of us. Explained her the situation she was in, it's illegal in India to attempt to off. But he knew us. So suggested to me to take care of her for a few days until she recovers. I did. He came back a week later and warned her about all the different consequences and left it at that. I didn't have any time to think anything. There 20 days were the hell of my life time. I cannot continue to live like this. I love her, i do. But I'm thinking really hard of what to do. Should i continue this relationship? 
I feel like I'm in a toxic mess that I don't want to be in but cannot get out of.
What should i do?

Push yourself to get up before the rest of the world - start with 7am, then 6am, then 5:30am. go to the nearest hill with a big coat and a scarf and watch the sun rise.

 push yourself to fall asleep earlier - start with 11pm, then 10pm, then 9pm. wake up in the morning feeling re-energized and comfortable. lie in your garden, feel the sunshine on your skin. 

get into the habit of cooking yourself a beautiful breakfast. fry tomatoes and mushrooms in real butter and garlic, fry an egg, slice up a fresh avocado and squirt way too much lemon on it. sit and eat it and do nothing else. 

 stretch. start by reaching for the sky as hard as you can, then trying to touch your toes. roll your head. stretch your fingers. stretch everything.

 buy a 1L water bottle. start with pushing yourself to drink the whole thing in a day, then try drinking it twice.

buy a beautiful diary and a beautiful black pen. write down everything you do, including dinner dates, appointments, assignments, coffees, what you need to do that day. no detail is too small.

strip your bed of your sheets and empty your underwear draw into the washing machine. wash, then hang them in the sunshine with care. make your bed in full. 

dig your fingers into the earth, plant a seed. see your success as it grows everyday. 

organise your room. fold all your clothes (and bag what you don‚Äôt want), clean your mirror, your laptop, vacuum the floor. light a beautiful candle. breathe. practice your deep breathing. ground yourself. 

 have a luxurious shower with your favourite music playing. wash your hair, scrub your body, brush your teeth. lather your whole body in moisturiser, get familiar with the part between your toes, your inner thighs, the back of your neck.

push yourself to go for a walk. take your headphones, go to the beach and walk. smile at strangers walking the other way and be surprised how many smile back. bring your dog and observe the dog‚Äôs behaviour. realise you can learn from your dog.

message old friends with personal jokes. reminisce. suggest a catch up soon, even if you don‚Äôt follow through. push yourself to follow through.

 think long and hard about what interests you. crime? sex? boarding school? long-forgotten romance etiquette? find a book about it and read it. there is a book about literally everything. 

become the person you would ideally fall in love with. let cars merge into your lane when driving. pay double for parking tickets and leave a second one in the machine. stick your tongue out at babies. help an animal. compliment people on their cute clothes. challenge yourself to not ridicule anyone for a whole day. then two. then a week. walk with a straight posture. look people in the eye. ask people about their story. talk to acquaintances so they become friends.

 lie in the sunshine. daydream about the life you would lead if failure wasn‚Äôt a thing. open your eyes. 

take small steps to make it happen for you...‚Äù

Ship departed LA port terminal (San Pedro) with stops in Ensenada, Cabo San Lucas, and Puerto Vallarta with 3 full days at sea. 

First time on NOS and I really liked this ship, crew, and itinerary. Service was excellent, food great and plenty of activities. Dinner reservations were messed up upon arrival but for things worked out the first night. 

Did pay for 2 excursions, one in Cabo and one in PV. Well worth, especially in Cabo as you have to get tender tickets if you don‚Äôt have an excursion through the cruise ship. 

Great shows every night!  Plenty of game shows also. Bingo was held the 3 days we were at sea. I‚Äôm not a bingo person on land, but boy was this fun. 

I know ship prices are inflated but did have a massage treatment on the ship and it was excellent. 

I did purchase the coffee select card which gave 15 coffee purchases from the Cafe Promenade, they serve Starbucks brand. Didn‚Äôt buy the drink package or specialty restaurants. The coffee card was worth it as I didn‚Äôt think the coffee was that great that they served. 

Ships has a passenger load of about 3800 (or close to that number). First night is always chaotic and busy but after that, I never felt the ship was overcrowded.

Yes Jun'ichir≈ç is also a SA victim, who's the culprit? Would be Naomi of course. I've seen alot of people in the bsd fandom, TOO much people labeling it as 'incests' 'weird siblings' but is it really? Even if the new chapters (118) are implying that Jun'ichir≈ç and Naomi aren't family by pure blood. 
Does that makes it any better?

Naomi touches her 'brother' in places in front of others when he clearly looks uncomfortable with it in the frist few episode of Bungou stray dogs and even the frist chapters of the manga series. But honestly Naomi even threatened Jun'ichir≈ç to tell the other agency members what they 'did last night'. Is juni'chir≈ç happy about it? No obviously, he just looks nervous in general.

""But he didn't say no!""

He did show signs he was uncomfortable and didn't want this and even told Naomi that it wasn't the time/moment to do that if i remember correctly (do not hesitate to correct me if i'm wrong of left something out)
+if Naomi really believes that Jun'ichir≈ç is really her brother then that's even more disgusting, why would you do that to someone you see as your brother. Why would you do that to someone in general? And don't even let me mention that scene in the coffee shop below the ADA when she was doing yk what and there was some weird noises... i'm not even gonna describe more than that.

I also saw people call Naomi 'hated for nothing' and also a 'girlboss'
If that's what you call a girlboss i'm sorry but that's not normal, and just because she's a girl doesn't mean that she's always the victim and i'm saying that as a GIRL myself, not for every cases but for this one especially. 
The only reason Jun'ichir≈ç is not telling her to back off is because he wants to make her happy.

""But Naomi is younger than Tanizaki!! He should be the one in charge""

You don't get it honestly, that doesn't change a single thing. Just because you like the character doesn't mean that they are innocent. For exemple i am a Chuuya fan and i can admit in front of everyone that he is a bad person and k1ll‚Ç¨d people just like you need to admit Naomi isn't a good person either, she would have been a great character if she wasn't like this.

Honestly it's crazy how people are all around Dazai when it happened to him but who's here for Jun'ichir≈ç? Is it because you find Dazai more handsome than Jun'ichir≈ç or is more important than him? I'm not saying that Dazai isn't valid, that's not my intention. It's also always ""Mori"" ""Elise"" as if she's not the most spoiled ability in the bsd verse. The naomi glaze crazy, y'all gotta wake up and face the truth. I saw people on pinterest say that Naomi and Yuan were overhated, like.. okay but don't compare Naomi to Yuan please. And i also hate the fact that people says 'i love the Tanizaki siblings when they're not together' oh so you still love Naomi after what she did? It doesn't matter if you got SA by someone younger or older, it's still valid. Honestly i hope this post won't get blocked by the mod team because it is kinda a sensitive topic to talk about but i gotta do what i gotta do and make at least a part of the fandom aware of what's really Naomi, no she's not that 'cute overrhated innocent girl' and i hope you get my point of view, i'm not hating on anyone but i'm just speaking about the fandom's obliviousness and i do hope that at least a few people will read this post cause i spend alot of time writing this.
